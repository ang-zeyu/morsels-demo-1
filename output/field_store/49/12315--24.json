Treasurer.  The duties of this officer vary in different societies.  In probably the majority of cases he acts as a banker, merely holding  the funds deposited with him, and paying them out on the order of the  society signed by the secretary.  His annual report, which is always  required, in this case consists of merely a statement of the amount on  hand at the commencement of the year, the amount received during the  year (stating from what source received), the total amount paid out by  order of the society, and the balance on hand.  When this report is  presented it is referred to an \"auditing committee,\" consisting of one  or two persons, who examine the treasurer's books and vouchers, and  certify on his report that they \"have examined his accounts and vouchers  and find them correct, and the balance on hand is,\" etc., stating the  amount on hand.  The auditing committee's report being accepted is  equivalent to a resolution of the society to the same effect, namely,  that the treasurer's report is correct.    In the case here supposed, the real financial    === Page 124 ===========================================================    statement is made either by the board of trustees, or by the secretary  or some other officer, according to the Constitution of the society.  The principles involved, are, that every officer who receives money is  to account for it in a report to the society, and that whatever officer  is responsible for the disbursements, shall report them to the society.  If the secretary, as in many societies, is really responsible for the  expenses, the treasurer merely paying upon his order, then the secretary  should make a full report of these expenses, so classified as to enable  the society to readily see the amounts expended for various purposes.    It should always be remembered that the financial report is made for the  information of members.  The details of dates and separate payments for  the same object, are a hinderance to its being understood, and are  useless, as it is the duty of the auditing committee to examine into the  details and see if the report is correct.    Every disbursing officer should be careful to get a receipt whenever he  makes a payment; these receipts should be preserved in regular order, as  they are the vouchers for the payments, which must be examined by the  auditing committee.  Disbursing officers cannot be    === Page 125 ===========================================================    too careful in keeping their accounts, and they should insist upon  having their accounts audited every time they make a report, as by this  means any error is quickly detected and may be corrected.  When the  society has accepted the auditing committee's report that the financial  report is correct, the disbursing officer is relieved from the  responsibility of the past, and if his vouchers were lost afterwards, it  would cause no trouble.  The best form for these financial reports  depends upon the kind of society, and is best determined by examining  those made in similar societies.    The following form can be varied to suit most cases:  (when the  statement of receipts and expenses is very long, it is often desirable  to specify the amounts received from one or two particular sources,  which can be done immediately after stating the total receipts; the same  course can be taken in regard to the expenditures):    Treasurer's Report.    The undersigned, Treasurer of the M. L. Society, begs leave to submit  the following annual report:    The balance on hand at the commencement of the year was --- dollars and  --- cents.  There was received from all sources during the year, ---  dollars and --- cents; during the same time the    === Page 126 ===========================================================    expenses amounted to --- dollars and --- cents, leaving a balance on  hand of --- dollars and --- cents.  The annexed statement of receipts  and expenditures will show in detail the sources from which the receipts  were obtained, and the objects to which the expenditures have been  applied.  All of which is respectfully submitted.    S-- M--, Treasurer M. L. S.    The \"Statement of receipts and expenditures\" can be made, by simply  giving a list of receipts, followed by a list of expenses, and finishing  up with the balance on hand.  The auditing committee's certificate to  the correctness of the account should be written on the statement.  Often the statement is made out in the form of an account, as follows:    Dr.          The M. L. S. in acct. with S. M., Treas.

In small assemblies, especially in those where but  little business is done, there is not much need of committees.  But in  large assemblies, or in those doing a great deal of business, committees  are of the utmost importance.  When a committee is properly selected, in  nine cases out of ten its action decides that of the assembly.  A  committee for action should be small and consist only of those heartily  in favor of the proposed action.  A committee for deliberation or  investigation, on the contrary, should be larger and represent all  parties in the assembly, so that its opinion will carry with it as great  weight as possible.  The usefulness of the committee will be greatly  impaired, if any important faction of the assembly be unrepresented on  the committee.  The appointment of a committee is fully explained in Sec.  46 (c).    The first member named on a committee is their chairman, and it is his  duty to call together the committee, and preside at their meetings.  If  he is absent, or from any cause fails or declines to call a meeting, it  is the duty of the committee to assemble on the call of any two of their  members.  The committee are a miniature assembly, only being able to act  when    === Page 128 ===========================================================    a quorum is present.  If a paper is referred to them they must not  deface it in any way, but write their amendments on a separate sheet.  If they originate the paper, all amendments must be incorporated in it.  When they originate the paper, usually one member has previously  prepared a draft, which is read entirely through, and then read by  paragraphs, the chairman pausing after each paragraph and asking, \"Are  there any amendments proposed to this paragraph?\"  No vote is taken on  the adoption of the separate paragraphs, but after the whole paper has  been read in this way, it is open to amendment, generally, by striking  out any paragraph or inserting new ones, or by substituting an entirely  new paper for it.  When it has been amended to suit the committee, they  should adopt it as their report, and direct the chairman or some other  member to report it to the assembly.  It is then written out, usually  commencing in a style similar to this:  \"The committee to which was  referred [state the matter referred], beg leave to submit the following  report;\" or, \"Your committee appointed to [specify the object], would  respectfully report,\" etc.  It usually closes thus:  \"All of which is  respectfully submitted,\" followed by the signatures of    === Page 129 ===========================================================    all the members concurring in the report, or sometimes by only that of  the chairman.    If the minority submit a report, it commences thus:  \"The undersigned, a  minority of the committee appointed,\" etc., continuing as the regular  report of the committee.  After the committee's report has been read, it  is usual to allow the minority to present their report, but it cannot be  acted upon except by a motion to substitute it for the report of the  committee.  When the committee's report is read, they are discharged  without any motion.  A motion to refer the paper back to the same  committee (or to re-commit), if adopted, revives the committee.    Art. XI.  Introduction of Business.    54. Any member wishing to bring business before the assembly, should,  without it is very simple, write down in the form of a motion, what he  would like to have the assembly adopt, thus:    Resolved, That the thanks of this convention be tendered to the citizens  of this community for their hearty welcome and generous hospitality.    === Page 130 ===========================================================    When there is no other business before the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9104"],[0,"The Naval War of 1812 (#18)"],[1,"ronades. The  _United States_ threw nominally 360 and 486, and the _Constitution_  nominally 360 and 352; so the 74 was superior even to the former  nominally about as three is to two; while the _Constitution_, if  \"a line-of-battle ship,\" was disguised to such a degree that she  was in reality of but little more than _one half_ the force of one  of the smallest _true_ liners England possessed!

The _Wasp_,  18, was still at sea, on her return voyage from France; the  _Constellation_, 38, was lying in the Chesapeake river, unable to  receive a crew for several months to come; the _Chesapeake_, 38,  was lying in a similar condition in Boston harbor; the _Adams_,  28, was at Washington, being cut down and lengthened from a frigate  into a corvette. These three cruisers were none of them fit to go  to sea till after the end of the year. The _Essex_, 32, was in  New York harbor, but, having some repairs to make, was not yet  ready to put out. The _Constitution_, 44, was at Annapolis, without  all of her stores, and engaged in shipping a new crew, the time of  the old one being up. The _Nautilus_, 14, was cruising off New  Jersey, and the other small brigs were also off the coast. The  only vessels immediately available were those under the command  of Commodore Rodgers, at New York, consisting of his own ship, the  _President_, 44, and of the _United States_, 44, Commodore Decatur,  _Congress_, 38, Captain Smith, _Hornet_, 18, Captain Lawrence,  and _Argus_, 16, Lieut. Sinclair. It seems marvellous that any  nation should have permitted its ships to be so scattered, and  many of them in such an unfit condition, at the beginning of  hostilities. The British vessels cruising off the coast were not  at that time very numerous or formidable, consisting of the  _Africa_, 64, _Acasta_, 40, _Shannon_, 38, _Guerrière_, 38,  _Belvidera_, 36, _Aeolus_, 32, _Southampton_, 32, and _Minerva_,  32, with a number of corvettes and sloops; their force was,  however, strong enough to render it impossible for Commodore  Rodgers to make any attempt on the coast towns of Canada or the  West Indies. But the homeward bound plate fleet had sailed from  Jamaica on May 20th, and was only protected by the _Thalia_, 36,  Capt. Vashon, and _Reindeer_, 18, Capt. Manners. Its capture or  destruction would have been a serious blow, and one which there  seemed a good chance of striking, as the fleet would have to pass  along the American coast, running with the Gulf Stream. Commodore  Rodgers had made every preparation, in expectation of war being  declared, and an hour after official intelligence of it, together  with his instructions, had been received, his squadron put to sea,  on June 21st, and ran off toward the south-east [Footnote: Letter  of Commodore John Rodgers to the Secretary of the Navy, Sept. 1,  1812.] to get at the Jamaica ships. Having learned from an  American brig that she had passed the plate fleet four days before  in lat. 36° N., long. 67° W., the Commodore made all sail in that  direction. At 6 A.M. on June 23d a sail was made out in the N. E.,  which proved to be the British frigate _Belvidera_, 36, Capt.  Richard Byron. [Footnote: Brenton, v. 46.] The latter had sighted  some of Commodore Rodgers' squadron some time before, and stood  toward them, till at 6.30 she made out the three largest ships to  be frigates. Having been informed of the likelihood of war by a New  York pilot boat, the _Belvidera_ now stood away, going N. E. by E.,  the wind being fresh from the west. The Americans made all sail in  chase, the _President_, a very fast ship off the wind, leading,  and the _Congress_ coming next. At noon the _President_ bore S. W.,  distant 2 3/4 miles from the _Belvidera_, Nantucket shoals bearing  100 miles N. and 48 miles E [Footnote: Log of _Belvidera_, June 23,  1812.]. The wind grew lighter, shifting more toward the south-west,  while the ships continued steadily in their course, going N.E. by E.  As the _President_ kept gaining, Captain Byron cleared his ship  for action, and shifted to the stern ports two long eighteen-pounders  on the main-deck and two thirty-two pound carronades on the  quarter-deck.    At 4:30 [Footnote: Cooper, ii, 151. According to James, vi, 117,  the _President_ was then 600 yards distant from the _Belvidera_,  half a point on her weather or port quarter.] the _President's_  starboard forecastle bowgun was fired by Commodore Rodgers himself;  the corresponding main-deck gun was next discharged, and then  Commodore Rodgers fired again. These three shots all struck the  stern of the _Belvidera_, killing and wounding nine men,--one of  them went through the rudder coat, into the after gun-room, the  other two into the captain's cabin. A few more such shots would  have rendered the _Belvidera's_ capture certain, but when the  _President's_ main-deck gun was discharged for the second time it  burst, blowing up the forecastle deck and killing and wounding 16  men, among them the Commodore himself, whose leg was broken. This  saved the British frigate. Such an explosion always causes a half  panic, every gun being at once suspected. In the midst of the  confusion Captain Byron's stern-chasers opened with spirit and  effect, killing or wounding six men more. Had the _President_ still  pushed steadily on, only using her bow-chasers until she closed  abreast, which she could probably have done, the _Belvidera_ could  still have been taken; but, instead, the former now bore up and  fired her port broadside, cutting her antagonist's rigging slightly,  but doing no other damage, while the _Belvidera_ kept up a brisk  and galling fire, although the long bolts, breeching-hooks, and  breechings of the guns now broke continually, wounding several of  the men, including Captain Byron. The _President_ had lost ground  by yawing, but she soon regained it, and, coming up closer than  before, again opened from her bow-chasers a well-directed fire,  which severely wounded her opponent's main-top mast, cross-jack  yard, and one or two other spars; [Footnote: James, vi, 119. He  says the _President_ was within 400 yards.] but shortly afterward  she repeated her former tactics and again lost ground by yawing  to discharge another broadside, even more ineffectual than the  first. Once more she came up closer than ever, and once more yawed;  the single shots from her bow-chasers doing considerable damage,  but her raking broadsides none. [Footnote: Lord Howard Douglass,  \"Naval Gunnery,\" p. 419 (third edition).] Meanwhile the active  crew of the _Belvidera_ repaired every thing as fast as it was  damaged, while under the superintendence of Lieutenants Sykes,  Bruce, and Campbell, no less than 300 shot were fired from her  stern guns. [Footnote: James, vi, 118.] Finding that if the  _President_ ceased yawing she could easily run alongside, Captain  Byron cut away one bower, one stream, and two sheet anchors, the  barge, yawl, gig, and jolly boat, and started 14 tons of water.  The effect of this was at once apparent, and she began to gain;  meanwhile the damage the sails of the combatants had received had  enabled the _Congress_ to close, and when abreast of his consort  Captain Smith opened with his bow-chasers, but the shot fell short.  The _Belvidera_ soon altered her course to east by south, set her  starboard studding-sails, and by midnight was out of danger; and  three days afterward reached Halifax harbor.    Lord Howard Douglass' criticisms on this encounter seem very just.  He says that the President opened very well with her bow-chasers  (in fact the Americans seem to have aimed better and to have done  more execution with these guns than the British with their  stern-chasers); but that she lost so much ground by yawing and  delivering harmless broadsides as to enable her antagonist to  escape. Certainly if it had not been for the time thus lost to no  purpose, the Commodore would have run alongside his opponent, and  the fate of the little 36 would have been sealed. On the other hand  it must be remembered that it was only the bursting of the gun on  board the _President_, causing such direful confusion and loss,  and especially harmful in disabling her commander, that gave the  _Belvidera_ any chance of escape at all. At any rate, whether the  American frigate does, or does not, deserve blame, Captain Byron  and his crew do most emphatically deserve praise for the skill  with which their guns were served and repairs made, the coolness  with which measures to escape were adopted, and the courage with  which they resisted so superior a force. On this occasion Captain  Byron showed himself as good a seaman and as brave a man as he  subsequently proved a humane and generous enemy when engaged in  the blockade of the Chesapeake. [Footnote: Even Niles, unscrupulously  bitter as he is toward the British, does justice to the humanity  of Captains Byron and Hardy--which certainly shone in comparison  to some of the rather buccaneering exploits of Cockburn's followers  in Chesapeake Bay.]    This was not a very auspicious opening of hostilities for America.  The loss of the _Belvidera_ was not the only thing to be regretted,  for the distance the chase took the pursuers out of their course  probably saved the plate fleet. When the _Belvidera_ was first  made out, Commodore Rodgers was in latitude 39° 26' N., and  longitude 71° 10' W.; at noon the same day the"]]]
