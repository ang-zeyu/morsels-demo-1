So he followed after the little  girl.    As for the Princess, she hesitated a moment and then turned in the same  direction the others had taken, but going far more slowly. Soon she  heard footsteps pattering behind her, and up came Googly-Goo, a little  out of breath with running.    \"Stop, Gloria!\" he cried. \"I have come to take you back to my mansion,  where we are to be married.\"    She looked at him wonderingly a moment, then tossed her head  disdainfully and walked on. But Googly-Goo kept beside her.    \"What does this mean?\" he demanded. \"Haven't you discovered that you no  longer love that gardener's boy, who stood in my way?\"    \"Yes; I have discovered it,\" she replied. \"My heart is frozen to all  mortal loves. I cannot love you, or Pon, or the cruel King my uncle, or  even myself. Go your way, Googly-Goo, for I will wed no one at all.\"    He stopped in dismay when he heard this, but in another minute he  exclaimed angrily:    \"You must wed me, Princess Gloria, whether you want to or not! I paid  to have your heart frozen; I also paid the King to permit our marriage.  If you now refuse me it will mean that I have been  robbed--robbed--robbed of my precious money and jewels!\"    He almost wept with despair, but she laughed a cold, bitter laugh and  passed on. Googly-Goo caught at her arm, as if to restrain her, but she  whirled and dealt him a blow that sent him reeling into a ditch beside  the path. Here he lay for a long time, half covered by muddy water,  dazed with surprise.    Finally the old courtier arose, dripping, and climbed from the ditch.  The Princess had gone; so, muttering threats of vengeance upon her,  upon the King and upon Blinkie, old Googly-Goo hobbled back to his  mansion to have the mud removed from his costly velvet clothes.          Chapter Fifteen    Trot Meets the Scarecrow      Trot and Pon covered many leagues of ground, searching through forests,  in fields and in many of the little villages of Jinxland, but could  find no trace of either Cap'n Bill or Button-Bright. Finally they  paused beside a cornfield and sat upon a stile to rest. Pon took some  apples from his pocket and gave one to Trot. Then he began eating  another himself, for this was their time for luncheon. When his apple  was finished Pon tossed the core into the field.    \"Tchuk-tchuk!\" said a strange voice. \"What do you mean by hitting me in  the eye with an apple-core?\"    Then rose up the form of the Scarecrow, who had hidden himself in the  cornfield while he examined Pon and Trot and decided whether they were  worthy to be helped.    \"Excuse me,\" said Pon. \"I didn't know you were there.\"    \"How did you happen to be there, anyhow?\" asked Trot.    The Scarecrow came forward with awkward steps and stood beside them.    \"Ah, you are the gardener's boy,\" he said to Pon. Then he turned to  Trot. \"And you are the little girl who came to Jinxland riding on a big  bird, and who has had the misfortune to lose her friend, Cap'n Bill,  and her chum, Button-Bright.\"    \"Why, how did you know all that?\" she inquired.    \"I know a lot of things,\" replied the Scarecrow, winking at her  comically. \"My brains are the Carefully-Assorted, Double-Distilled,  High-Efficiency sort that the Wizard of Oz makes. He admits, himself,  that my brains are the best he ever manufactured.\"    \"I think I've heard of you,\" said Trot slowly, as she looked the  Scarecrow over with much interest; \"but you used to live in the Land of  Oz.\"    \"Oh, I do now,\" he replied cheerfully. \"I've just come over the  mountains from the Quadling Country to see if I can be of any help to  you.\"    \"Who, me?\" asked Pon.    \"No, the strangers from the big world. It seems they need looking  after.\"    \"I'm doing that myself,\" said Pon, a little ungraciously. \"If you will  pardon me for saying so, I don't see how a Scarecrow with painted eyes  can look after anyone.\"    \"If you don't see that, you are more blind than the Scarecrow,\"  asserted Trot. \"He's a fairy man, Pon, and comes from the fairyland of  Oz, so he can do 'most anything. I hope,\" she added, turning to the  Scarecrow, \"you can find Cap'n Bill for me.\"    \"I will try, anyhow,\" he promised. \"But who is that old woman who is  running toward us and shaking her stick at us?\"    Trot and Pon turned around and both uttered an exclamation of fear. The  next instant they took to their heels and ran fast up the path. For it  was old Blinkie, the Wicked Witch, who had at last traced them to this  place. Her anger was so great that she was determined not to abandon  the chase of Pon and Trot until she had caught and punished them. The  Scarecrow understood at once that the old woman meant harm to his new  friends, so as she drew near he stepped before her. His appearance was  so sudden and unexpected that Blinkie ran into him and toppled him  over, but she tripped on his straw body and went rolling in the path  beside him.    The Scarecrow sat up and said: \"I beg your pardon!\" but she whacked him  with her stick and knocked him flat again. Then, furious with rage, the  old witch sprang upon her victim and began pulling the straw out of his  body. The poor Scarecrow was helpless to resist and in a few moments  all that was left of him was an empty suit of clothes and a heap of  straw beside it. Fortunately, Blinkie did not harm his head, for it  rolled into a little hollow and escaped her notice. Fearing that Pon  and Trot would escape her, she quickly resumed the chase and  disappeared over the brow of a hill, following the direction in which  she had seen them go.    Only a short time elapsed before a gray grasshopper with a wooden leg  came hopping along and lit directly on the upturned face of the  Scarecrow's head.    \"Pardon me, but you are resting yourself upon my nose,\" remarked the  Scarecrow.    \"Oh! are you alive?\" asked the grasshopper.    \"That is a question I have never been able to decide,\" said the  Scarecrow's head. \"When my body is properly stuffed I have animation  and can move around as well as any live person. The brains in the head  you are now occupying as a throne, are of very superior quality and do  a lot of very clever thinking. But whether that is being alive, or not,  I cannot prove to you; for one who lives is liable to death, while I am  only liable to destruction.\"    \"Seems to me,\" said the grasshopper, rubbing his nose with his front  legs, \"that in your case it doesn't matter--unless you're destroyed  already.\"    \"I am not; all I need is re-stuffing,\" declared the Scarecrow; \"and if  Pon and Trot escape the witch, and come back here, I am sure they will  do me that favor.\"    \"Tell me! Are Trot and Pon around here?\" inquired the grasshopper, its  small voice trembling with excitement.    The Scarecrow did not answer at once, for both his eyes were staring  straight upward at a beautiful face that was slightly bent over his  head. It was, indeed, Princess Gloria, who had wandered to this spot,  very much surprised when she heard the Scarecrow's head talk and the  tiny gray grasshopper answer it.    \"This,\" said the Scarecrow, still staring at her, \"must be the Princess  who loves Pon, the gardener's boy.\"    \"Oh, indeed!\" exclaimed the grasshopper--who of course was Cap'n  Bill--as he examined the young lady curiously.    \"No,\" said Gloria frigidly, \"I do not love Pon, or anyone else, for the  Wicked Witch has frozen my heart.\"    \"What a shame!\" cried the Scarecrow. \"One so lovely should be able to  love. But would you mind, my dear, stuffing that straw into my body  again?\"    The dainty Princess glanced at the straw and at the well-worn blue  Munchkin clothes and shrank back in disdain. But she was spared from  refusing the Scarecrow's request by the appearance of Trot and Pon, who  had hidden in some bushes just over the brow of the hill and waited  until old Blinkie had passed them by. Their hiding place was on the  same side as the witch's blind eye, and she rushed on in the chase of  the girl and the youth without being aware that they had tricked her.    Trot was shocked at the Scarecrow's sad condition and at once began  putting the straw back into his body. Pon, at sight of Gloria, again  appealed to her to take pity on him, but the frozen-hearted Princess  turned coldly away and with a sigh the gardener's boy began to assist  Trot.    Neither of them at first noticed the small grasshopper, which at their  appearance had skipped off the Scarecrow's nose and was now clinging to  a wisp of grass beside the path, where he was not likely to be stepped  upon. Not until the Scarecrow had been neatly restuffed and set upon  his feet again--when he bowed to his restorers and expressed his  thanks--did the grasshopper move from his perch. Then he leaped lightly  into the path and called out:    \"Trot--Trot! Look at me. I'm Cap'n Bill! See what the Wicked Witch has  done to me.\"    The voice was small, to be sure, but it reached Trot's ears and  startled her greatly. She looked intently at the grasshopper, her eyes  wide with fear at first; then she knelt down and, noticing the wooden  leg, she began to weep sorrowfully.    \"Oh, Cap'n Bill--dear Cap'n Bill! What a cruel thing to do!\" she sobbed.    \"Don't cry, Trot,\" begged the grasshopper. \"It didn't hurt any, and it  doesn't hurt now. But it's mighty inconvenient an' humiliatin', to say  the least.\"    \"I wish,\" said the girl indignantly, while trying hard to restrain her  tears, \"that I was big 'nough an' strong 'nough to give that horrid  witch a good beating. She ought to be turned into a toad for doing this  to you, Cap'n Bill!\"    \"Never mind,\" urged the Scarecrow, in a comforting voice, \"such a  transformation doesn't last always, and as a general thing there's some  way"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/959"],[0,"The Lost Princess of Oz (#18)"],[1,"that I must be very wise.  I have learned more than a frog usually  knows, it is true, but I am not yet so wise as I hope to become at some  future time.\"    The King nodded, and when he did so, something squeaked in his chest.    \"Did Your Majesty speak?\" asked Cayke.    \"Not just then,\" answered the Lavender Bear, seeming to be somewhat  embarrassed.  \"I am so built, you must know, that when anything pushes  against my chest, as my chin accidentally did just then, I make that  silly noise.  In this city it isn't considered good manners to notice.  But I like your Frogman.  He is honest and truthful, which is more than  can be said of many others.  As for your late lamented dishpan, I'll  show it to you.\"    With this he waved three times the metal wand which he held in his paw,  and instantly there appeared upon the ground midway between the King  and Cayke a big, round pan made of beaten gold.  Around the top edge  was a row of small diamonds; around the center of the pan was another  row of larger diamonds; and at the bottom was a row of exceedingly  large and brilliant diamonds.  In fact, they all sparkled  magnificently, and the pan was so big and broad that it took a lot of  diamonds to go around it three times.    Cayke stared so hard that her eyes seemed about to pop out of her head.  \"O-o-o-h!\" she exclaimed, drawing a deep breath of delight.    \"Is this your dishpan?\" inquired the King.    \"It is, it is!\" cried the Cookie Cook, and rushing forward, she fell on  her knees and threw her arms around the precious pan.  But her arms  came together without meeting any resistance at all.  Cayke tried to  seize the edge, but found nothing to grasp.  The pan was surely there,  she thought, for she could see it plainly; but it was not solid; she  could not feel it at all.  With a moan of astonishment and despair, she  raised her head to look at the Bear King, who was watching her actions  curiously.  Then she turned to the pan again, only to find it had  completely disappeared.    \"Poor creature!\" murmured the King pityingly.  \"You must have thought,  for the moment, that you had actually recovered your dishpan.  But what  you saw was merely the image of it, conjured up by means of my magic.  It is a pretty dishpan, indeed, though rather big and awkward to  handle.  I hope you will some day find it.\"    Cayke was grievously disappointed.  She began to cry, wiping her eyes  on her apron.  The King turned to the throng of toy bears surrounding  him and asked, \"Has any of you ever seen this golden dishpan before?\"    \"No,\" they answered in a chorus.    The King seemed to reflect.  Presently he inquired, \"Where is the  Little Pink Bear?\"    \"At home, Your Majesty,\" was the reply.    \"Fetch him here,\" commanded the King.    Several of the bears waddled over to one of the trees and pulled from  its hollow a tiny pink bear, smaller than any of the others. A big,  white bear carried the pink one in his arms and set it down beside the  King, arranging the joints of its legs so that it would stand upright.    This Pink Bear seemed lifeless until the King turned a crank which  protruded from its side, when the little creature turned its head  stiffly from side to side and said in a small, shrill voice, \"Hurrah  for the King of Bear Center!\"    \"Very good,\" said the big Lavender Bear.  \"He seems to be working very  well today.  Tell me, my Pink Pinkerton, what has become of this lady's  jeweled dishpan?\"    \"U-u-u,\" said the Pink Bear, and then stopped short.    The King turned the crank again.    \"U-g-u the Shoemaker has it,\" said the Pink Bear.    \"Who is Ugu the Shoemaker?\" demanded the King, again turning the crank.    \"A magician who lives on a mountain in a wickerwork castle,\" was the  reply.    \"Where is the mountain?\" was the next question.    \"Nineteen miles and three furlongs from Bear Center to the northeast.\"    \"And is the dishpan still at the castle of Ugu the Shoemaker?\" asked  the King.    \"It is.\"    The King turned to Cayke.    \"You may rely on this information,\" said he.  \"The Pink Bear can tell  us anything we wish to know, and his words are always words of truth.\"    \"Is he alive?\" asked the Frogman, much interested in the Pink Bear.    \"Something animates him when you turn his crank,\" replied the King. \"I  do not know if it is life or what it is or how it happens that the  Little Pink Bear can answer correctly every question put to him.  We  discovered his talent a long time ago, and whenever we wish to know  anything--which is not very often--we ask the Pink Bear.  There is no  doubt whatever, madam, that Ugu the Magician has your dishpan, and if  you dare to go to him, you may be able to recover it.  But of that I am  not certain.\"    \"Can't the Pink Bear tell?\" asked Cayke anxiously.    \"No, for that is in the future.  He can tell anything that HAS  happened, but nothing that is going to happen.  Don't ask me why, for I  don't know.\"    \"Well,\" said the Cookie Cook after a little thought, \"I mean to go to  this magician, anyhow, and tell him I want my dishpan.  I wish I knew  what Ugu the Shoemaker is like.\"    \"Then I'll show him to you,\" promised the King.  \"But do not be  frightened.  It won't be Ugu, remember, but only his image.\"  With  this, he waved his metal wand, and in the circle suddenly appeared a  thin little man, very old and skinny, who was seated on a wicker stool  before a wicker table.  On the table lay a Great Book with gold clasps.  The Book was open, and the man was reading in it.  He wore great  spectacles which were fastened before his eyes by means of a ribbon  that passed around his head and was tied in a bow at the neck. His hair  was very thin and white; his skin, which clung fast to his bones, was  brown and seared with furrows; he had a big, fat nose and little eyes  set close together.    On no account was Ugu the Shoemaker a pleasant person to gaze at.  As  his image appeared before them, all were silent and intent until  Corporal Waddle, the Brown Bear, became nervous and pulled the trigger  of his gun.  Instantly, the cork flew out of the tin barrel with a loud  \"pop!\" that made them all jump.  And at this sound, the image of the  magician vanished.    \"So THAT'S the thief, is it?\" said Cayke in an angry voice. \"I should  think he'd be ashamed of himself for stealing a poor woman's diamond  dishpan!  But I mean to face him in his wicker castle and force him to  return my property.\"    \"To me,\" said the Bear King reflectively, \"he looked like a dangerous  person.  I hope he won't be so unkind as to argue the matter with you.\"    The Frogman was much disturbed by the vision of Ugu the Shoemaker, and  Cayke's determination to go to the magician filled her companion with  misgivings.  But he would not break his pledged word to assist the  Cookie Cook, and after breathing a deep sigh of resignation, he asked  the King, \"Will Your Majesty lend us this Pink Bear who answers  questions that we may take him with us on our journey?  He would be  very useful to us, and we will promise to bring him safely back to you.\"    The King did not reply at once.  He seemed to be thinking.    \"PLEASE let us take the Pink Bear,\" begged Cayke.  \"I'm sure he would  be a great help to us.\"    \"The Pink Bear,\" said the King, \"is the best bit of magic I possess,  and there is not another like him in the world.  I do not care to let  him out of my sight, nor do I wish to disappoint you; so I believe I  will make the journey in your company and carry my Pink Bear with me.  He can walk when you wind the other side of him, but so slowly and  awkwardly that he would delay you.  But if I go along, I can carry him  in my arms, so I will join your party.  Whenever you are ready to  start, let me know.\"    \"But Your Majesty!\" exclaimed Corporal Waddle in protest, \"I hope you  do not intend to let these prisoners escape without punishment.\"    \"Of what crime do you accuse them?\" inquired the King.    \"Why, they trespassed on your domain, for one thing,\" said the Brown  Bear.    \"We didn't know it was private property, Your Majesty,\" said the Cookie  Cook. \"And they asked if any of us had stolen the dishpan!\" continued  Corporal Waddle indignantly.  \"That is the same thing as calling us  thieves and robbers and bandits and brigands, is it not?\"    \"Every person has the right to ask questions,\" said the Frogman.    \"But the Corporal is quite correct,\" declared the Lavender Bear.  \"I  condemn you both to death, the execution to take place ten years from  this hour.\"    \"But we belong in the Land of Oz, where no one ever dies,\" Cayke  reminded him.    \"Very true,\" said the King.  \"I condemn you to death merely as a matter  of form.  It sounds quite terrible, and in ten years we shall have  forgotten all about it.  Are you ready to start for the wicker castle  of Ugu the Shoemaker?\"    \"Quite ready, Your Majesty.\"    \"But who will rule in your place while you are gone?\" asked a big  Yellow Bear.    \"I myself will rule while I am gone,\" was the reply.    \"A King isn't required to stay at home forever, and if he takes a  notion to travel, whose business is it but his own?  All I ask is that  you bears behave yourselves while I am away.  If any of you is naughty,  I'll send him to some girl or boy in America to play with.\"    This dreadful threat made all the toy bears look solemn.  They assured  the King in a chorus of growls that they would be good.  Then the big  Lavender Bear picked up the little Pink Bear, and after tucking it  carefully under one arm, he said, \"Goodbye till I come back!\" and  waddled along the path that led through the forest.  The Frogman and  Cayke the Cookie Cook also said goodbye to the bears and then followed  after the King, much to the regret of the little Brown Bear, who pulled  the trigger of his gun and popped the cork as a parting salute.
