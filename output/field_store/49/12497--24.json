I will now more minutely describe the actual mining operations. The mining  ground being selected, a tunnel is projected from the nearest and most  convenient ravine, so that the starting-point on the bed rock toward the  face of the ravine shall approach the center of the material to be removed  at a gradient of 1 in 10 to 1 in 30. The dimensions of such tunnels are  usually 6 feet in width by 7 in height, and continuing in contact with the  hard river-bed, for the greater ease of excavation, collection of gold,  and conservation of quicksilver amalgam.    These tunnels vary in length from a few hundred feet to a mile, and some  of the longer ones occupying from one to seven years in execution, at a  cost of from 10 to 60 dollars per foot of frontage. The tunnel of the Blue  Gravel Company, with length of 1,358 feet, cost in labor alone 70,000  dollars, but it could now be driven for 35,000 dollars, as skilled labor  is cheaper now than then. The grade in this tunnel is about 12 per cent.,  and the end of the tunnel is designed to be 170 feet of elevation, and  reaching to a point beneath the surface of the gravel which is being  operated upon, and where a shaft or incline is sunk to or through the bed  rock or gravel, until it intersects the tunnel.    The object of this laborious operation is obvious, as the long tunnel  becomes a sluiceway, and through the whole length of which sluice boxes  are laid, for the double motive of carrying off the material and saving  the gold, and for this purpose a trough of strong planks is placed in the  tunnel, 21/2 feet wide, and with sides high enough to contain the stream.  The pavement of the trough is generally laid of blocks of wood 6 inches in  thickness, cut across the grain, and placed on their ends, to the width of  the sluiceway. The wooden blocks are usually alternated with sections of  stone pavement, the stones being set endwise, and in the interstices  between the stones and wooden blocks quicksilver is distributed, and as  much as 2 tons of this metal is required to charge a long sluice. The  water in the canal is brought by aqueducts, or other means, to the head of  the mining ground, having an elevation of 100 to 200 ft. above the lowest  level of the mining ground, and is finally conveyed to it by iron pipes,  sometimes sustained on a strong incline of timber.    These pipes are of sheet iron, of adequate strength, riveted at the  joints, and measure from 12 to 20 inches in diameter, and communicate at  the bottom with a strong prismatic box of cast-iron, on the top and sides  of which are openings for the adaptation of flexible tubes, made of very  strong fabric of canvas, strengthened by cording, and terminating in  nozzles of metal of 21/2 to 3 inches in diameter. From these nozzles the  streams of water are directed against the face of the gravel to be washed,  exercising incredible effectivity.    The volume of water employed varies of course with the work to be done;  but it is not uncommon to see four such streams acting simultaneously on  the same bank, each conveying from 100 to 600 inches of water per  hour--1,000 miner's inches being equal to 106,600 cubic feet of water per  hour, constantly exerting its force under a pressure of 90 to 200 pounds  to the square inch, varying with the height of the column.    Under the continuous action of this enormous force, aided by the softening  power of the water, large sections of the gravelly mass are dislodged, and  fall with great violence, the _debris_ speedily disintegrating and  disappearing under the resistless force of the water, and is hurried  forward in the sluices to the mouth of the shaft, down which it is  precipitated with the whole volume of turbid water. Bowlders of 100 to 200  lb. in weight are dislodged and shot forward by the impetuous stream,  accompanied by masses of the harder cement which meet in the fall, and by  the concussion from the great bowlders the crushing and pulverizing agency  required is found to disintegrate it. The heavy banks, of 80 feet and  upward, are usually worked in two benches, the upper never being so rich  as the lower, and also less firm, and therefore worked away with greater  rapidity.    The lower section is much the more compact, as this stratum on the bed  rock being strongly cemented resists great pressure, and even sometimes  the full force of the streams of water, until it has been loosened by  gunpowder or other explosives. For this purpose adits are driven in on its  foundation-point of from 40 to 70 feet and more from the face of the bank,  and drifts are extended at right angles therefrom to a short distance on  each side of the adit, and in these drifts a large quantity of gunpowder  is placed (from 1 to 3 tons), and fired at one blast, having been  previously built in with masonry. And in this manner the compact  conglomerate is broken up, and then the water easily completes its work.  Sometimes in the soft, upper strata the systems of tunnel is extended, as  in a coal-mine, by cross alleys, leaving blocks which are afterward washed  away, and then the whole mass settles, and is disintegrated under the  influence of water. The wooden sluices in the tunnels already described  are often made double for the convenience of \"cleaning up\" one of them,  while the other remains in action. The process of cleaning up is performed  according to the quantity and richness of the material worked upon, at  intervals of twenty to forty days, and consists in removing the pavement  and blocks from the bed of the sluice, and then gathering all the amalgam  of gold and rich dirt collected, and replacing the locks in the same way  as at first. Advantage is taken on this occasion to reverse the position  of the blocks and stones when they are worn irregularly, or substitute new  ones for those which are worn through. The mechanical action of the  washing process on the blocks is of course very rapid and severe,  requiring complete renewal of them once in eight to ten weeks. Some miners  prefer a pavement of egg-shaped stones set like a cobble-stone flooring,  the gold being deposited in the interstices. Most of the sluiceways are,  however, paved with rectangular wooden blocks, with or without stones as  described. Standing at the mouth of one of the long tunnels in full  action, any person unaccustomed to the process is struck with  astonishment, amounting almost to terror, as the muddy mass sweeps onward,  bearing in its course the great rolling bowlders, which add their din to  the roar of the water, the whole being precipitated down a series of  falls, at each of which it is caught up again by new sluices of timber,  lined like the first, and so onward and downward many hundreds of feet  until the level of the river is reached, at a distance of about a half  mile or more from the mouth of the first tunnel.    At each of these new falls of 25 to 50 feet the process of comminution  begun in the first shaft is carried on, and a fresh portion of gold  obtained. Rude as this plan of saving gold appears to be, more gold is  procured by it than by any other method of washing yet devised for this  process of work, and the economical advantages obtained by it cannot be  surpassed, as it would be impossible to handle such vast quantities of  material in any other way, and we can compare the cost of washing and  handling a cubic yard of auriferous gravel by it as follows:                                            Dollars.  By manual labor with the pan              15.00      \"       \"   with rocker                3.75      \"       \"   with the long tom           .75  By the hydraulic process                    .15    But this process, even if effective or profitable as a mining operation,  may be prejudicial to the interests of the general public, if conducted on  a large scale, as the vast quantity of material which it so suddenly  removes is merely shifted into the shallows beneath, to be redistributed  by every freshet to points lower and lower down until it reaches the  sea-coast, creating bars at the mouths of rivers in its course, and  changing the hydrography of harbors--as it has done with the Bay of San  Francisco by its silt.    The hills behind, torn up and washed by the gold miner, are abandoned as  desolate and irredeemable; and the costly canals, constructed with  peculiar conveniences for mining purposes, eventually fall into disuse  from being too expensive to maintain or alter for general agricultural  uses.--_Journal of Science._           *       *       *       *       *          THE TREATMENT OF CHOLERA.      From the host of remedies and suggestions that are now deluging the  European medical press, we select the following from Dr. Henry A. Rawlins,  in the _London Med. Times_, July 12. 1884:    The man suffering from cholera has been suddenly deprived by diarrhoea of  an enormous quantity of the fluid part of his blood. This loss is one of  simple transudation, increasing as the powers of life decrease. This  _sudden_ loss produces intense prostration, and renders the heart  powerless to perfect the circulation. The body, thus deprived of oxygen,  speedily runs into decomposition, even before life is extinct. Have we any  agent by which we can collect and press forward these scattered and  lethargic drops of blood to the heart, and enable it to renew the  circulation, and with it the blessings of oxygen to the body? My reply is  emphatically--Yes! Flannel bandages from the toes to the trunk, around the  abdomen, and from the fingers to the body, will effect this object  perfectly. Remark that the effect is gradual, increasing with every turn  of the roller, but would be in full force in about twenty minutes."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14"],[0,"The 1990 CIA World Factbook (#19)"],[1,"able; 24 with permanent-surface runways;  none with runways over 3,659 m; 14 with runways 2,440-3,659 m; 3 with  runways 1,220-2,439 m    Telecommunications: excellent domestic and international telephone and  telegraph facilities; 4,560,000 telephones; stations--8 AM, 19 FM (41 relays),  25 TV (10 relays); 5 submarine cables; satellite earth stations operating  in INTELSAT 3 Atlantic Ocean and EUTELSAT systems    - Defense Forces  Branches: Army, Navy, Air Force    Military manpower: males 15-49, 2,512,681; 2,114,701 fit for military  service; 66,758 reach military age (19) annually    Defense expenditures: 2.7% of GDP, or $3.7 billion (1989 est.)  ----------------------------------------------------  Country:  Belize  - Geography  Total area: 22,960 km2; land area: 22,800 km2    Comparative area: slightly larger than Massachusetts    Land boundaries: 516 km total; Guatemala 266 km, Mexico 250 km    Coastline: 386 km    Maritime claims:    Territorial sea: 3 nm    Disputes: claimed by Guatemala, but boundary negotiations are  under way    Climate: tropical; very hot and humid; rainy season (May to February)    Terrain: flat, swampy coastal plain; low mountains in south    Natural resources: arable land potential, timber, fish    Land use: 2% arable land; NEGL% permanent crops; 2% meadows and pastures;  44% forest and woodland; 52% other; includes NEGL% irrigated    Environment: frequent devastating hurricanes (September to December)  and coastal flooding (especially in south); deforestation    Note: national capital moved 80 km inland from Belize City to  Belmopan because of hurricanes; only country in Central America without a  coastline on the North Pacific Ocean    - People  Population: 219,737 (July 1990), growth rate 3.7% (1990)    Birth rate: 38 births/1,000 population (1990)    Death rate: 6 deaths/1,000 population (1990)    Net migration rate: 4 migrants/1,000 population (1990)    Infant mortality rate: 35 deaths/1,000 live births (1990)    Life expectancy at birth: 67 years male, 72 years female (1990)    Total fertility rate: 4.8 children born/woman (1990)    Nationality: noun--Belizean(s); adjective--Belizean    Ethnic divisions: 39.7% Creole, 33.1% Mestizo, 9.5% Maya, 7.6%  Garifuna, 2.1% East Indian, 8.0% other    Religion: 60% Roman Catholic; 40% Protestant (Anglican, Seventh-Day  Adventist, Methodist, Baptist, Jehovah's Witnesses, Mennonite)    Language: English (official), Spanish, Maya, Garifuna (Carib)    Literacy: 93% (est.)

Agriculture accounts for more than 30% of GDP and provides 75%  of export earnings, while sugar, the chief crop, accounts for almost 40% of  hard currency earnings. The US, Belize's main trading partner, is assisting in  efforts to reduce dependency on sugar with an agricultural diversification  program. In 1987 the drop in income from sugar sales to the US because of quota  reductions was almost totally offset by higher world prices for sugar.
