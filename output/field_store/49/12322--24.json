For his body would be  evidence as damning as himself.    \"Nay, sir,\" said Johann, \"his Highness has thought of that. While the  two hold the outer room, the one who has killed the King unlocks the  bars in the square window (they turn on a hinge). The window now gives  no light, for its mouth is choked by a great pipe of earthenware; and  this pipe, which is large enough to let pass through it the body of  a man, passes into the moat, coming to an end immediately above the  surface of the water, so that there is no perceptible interval between  water and pipe. The King being dead, his murderer swiftly ties a weight  to the body, and, dragging it to the window, raises it by a pulley (for,  lest the weight should prove too great, Detchard has provided one) till  it is level with the mouth of the pipe. He inserts the feet in the pipe,  and pushes the body down. Silently, without splash or sound, it falls  into the water and thence to the bottom of the moat, which is twenty  feet deep thereabouts. This done, the murderer cries loudly, 'All's  well!' and himself slides down the pipe; and the others, if they can and  the attack is not too hot, run to the inner room and, seeking a moment's  delay, bar the door, and in their turn slide down. And though the King  rises not from the bottom, they rise and swim round to the other side,  where the orders are for men to wait them with ropes, to haul them out,  and horses. And here, if things go ill, the duke will join them and seek  safety by riding; but if all goes well, they will return to the Castle,  and have their enemies in a trap. That, sir, is the plan of his Highness  for the disposal of the King in case of need. But it is not to be used  till the last; for, as we all know, he is not minded to kill the King  unless he can, before or soon after, kill you also, sir. Now, sir, I  have spoken the truth, as God is my witness, and I pray you to shield me  from the vengeance of Duke Michael; for if, after he knows what I have  done, I fall into his hands, I shall pray for one thing out of all the  world--a speedy death, and that I shall not obtain from him!\"    The fellow's story was rudely told, but our questions supplemented  his narrative. What he had told us applied to an armed attack; but if  suspicions were aroused, and there came overwhelming force--such, for  instance, as I, the King, could bring--the idea of resistance would be  abandoned; the King would be quietly murdered and slid down the pipe.  And--here comes an ingenious touch--one of the Six would take his  place in the cell, and, on the entrance of the searchers, loudly demand  release and redress; and Michael, being summoned, would confess to hasty  action, but he would say the man had angered him by seeking the favour  of a lady in the Castle (this was Antoinette de Mauban) and he had  confined him there, as he conceived he, as Lord of Zenda, had right to  do. But he was now, on receiving his apology, content to let him go,  and so end the gossip which, to his Highness's annoyance, had arisen  concerning a prisoner in Zenda, and had given his visitors the trouble  of this enquiry. The visitors, baffled, would retire, and Michael could,  at his leisure, dispose of the body of the King.    Sapt, Fritz, and I in my bed, looked round on one another in horror and  bewilderment at the cruelty and cunning of the plan. Whether I went  in peace or in war, openly at the head of a corps, or secretly by a  stealthy assault, the King would be dead before I could come near him.  If Michael were stronger and overcame my party, there would be an end.  But if I were stronger, I should have no way to punish him, no means of  proving any guilt in him without proving my own guilt also. On the other  hand, I should be left as King (ah! for a moment my pulse quickened) and  it would be for the future to witness the final struggle between him and  me. He seemed to have made triumph possible and ruin impossible. At  the worst, he would stand as well as he had stood before I crossed  his path--with but one man between him and the throne, and that man an  impostor; at best, there would be none left to stand against him. I had  begun to think that Black Michael was over fond of leaving the fighting  to his friends; but now I acknowledged that the brains, if not the arms,  of the conspiracy were his.    \"Does the King know this?\" I asked.    \"I and my brother,\" answered Johann, \"put up the pipe, under the orders  of my Lord of Hentzau. He was on guard that day, and the King asked my  lord what it meant. 'Faith,' he answered, with his airy laugh, 'it's a  new improvement on the ladder of Jacob, whereby, as you have read, sire,  men pass from the earth to heaven. We thought it not meet that your  Majesty should go, in case, sire, you must go, by the common route. So  we have made you a pretty private passage where the vulgar cannot stare  at you or incommode your passage. That, sire, is the meaning of  that pipe.' And he laughed and bowed, and prayed the King's leave to  replenish the King's glass--for the King was at supper. And the King,  though he is a brave man, as are all of his House, grew red and then  white as he looked on the pipe and at the merry devil who mocked him.  Ah, sir\" (and the fellow shuddered), \"it is not easy to sleep quiet in  the Castle of Zenda, for all of them would as soon cut a man's throat  as play a game at cards; and my Lord Rupert would choose it sooner for  a pastime than any other--ay, sooner than he would ruin a woman, though  that he loves also.\"    The man ceased, and I bade Fritz take him away and have him carefully  guarded; and, turning to him, I added:    \"If anyone asks you if there is a prisoner in Zenda, you may answer  'Yes.' But if any asks who the prisoner is, do not answer. For all my  promises will not save you if any man here learns from you the truth as  to the prisoner of Zenda. I'll kill you like a dog if the thing be so  much as breathed within the house!\"    Then, when he was gone, I looked at Sapt.    \"It's a hard nut!\" said I.    \"So hard,\" said he, shaking his grizzled head, \"that as I think, this  time next year is like to find you still King of Ruritania!\" and he  broke out into curses on Michael's cunning.    I lay back on my pillows.    \"There seems to me,\" I observed, \"to be two ways by which the King can  come out of Zenda alive. One is by treachery in the duke's followers.\"    \"You can leave that out,\" said Sapt.    \"I hope not,\" I rejoined, \"because the other I was about to mention  is--by a miracle from heaven!\"          CHAPTER 14    A Night Outside the Castle      It would have surprised the good people of Ruritania to know of the  foregoing talk; for, according to the official reports, I had suffered a  grievous and dangerous hurt from an accidental spear-thrust, received in  the course of my sport. I caused the bulletins to be of a very serious  character, and created great public excitement, whereby three things  occurred: first, I gravely offended the medical faculty of Strelsau by  refusing to summon to my bedside any of them, save a young man, a friend  of Fritz's, whom we could trust; secondly, I received word from Marshal  Strakencz that my orders seemed to have no more weight than his, and  that the Princess Flavia was leaving for Tarlenheim under his unwilling  escort (news whereat I strove not to be glad and proud); and thirdly, my  brother, the Duke of Strelsau, although too well informed to believe the  account of the origin of my sickness, was yet persuaded by the reports  and by my seeming inactivity that I was in truth incapable of action,  and that my life was in some danger. This I learnt from the man Johann,  whom I was compelled to trust and send back to Zenda, where, by the way,  Rupert Hentzau had him soundly flogged for daring to smirch the morals  of Zenda by staying out all night in the pursuits of love. This, from  Rupert, Johann deeply resented, and the duke's approval of it did more  to bind the keeper to my side than all my promises.    On Flavia's arrival I cannot dwell. Her joy at finding me up and well,  instead of on my back and fighting with death, makes a picture that  even now dances before my eyes till they grow too dim to see it; and her  reproaches that I had not trusted even her must excuse the means I took  to quiet them. In truth, to have her with me once more was like a taste  of heaven to a damned soul, the sweeter for the inevitable doom that  was to follow; and I rejoiced in being able to waste two whole days with  her. And when I had wasted two days, the Duke of Strelsau arranged a  hunting-party.    The stroke was near now. For Sapt and I, after anxious consultations,  had resolved that we must risk a blow, our resolution being clinched  by Johann's news that the King grew peaked, pale, and ill, and that his  health was breaking down under his rigorous confinement. Now a man--be  he king or no king--may as well die swiftly and as becomes a gentleman,  from bullet or thrust, as rot his life out in a cellar! That thought  made prompt action advisable in the interests of the King; from my own  point of view, it grew more and more necessary. For Strakencz urged on  me the need of a speedy marriage, and my own inclinations seconded him  with such terrible insistence that I feared for my resolution. I do not  believe that I should have done the deed I dreamt of; but I might have  come to flight, and my flight would have ruined the cause. And--yes, I  am no saint (ask my little sister-in-law), and worse still might have  happened.    It is perhaps as strange a thing as has ever been in the history of a  country that the King's brother and the King's personator, in a time of  profound outward peace, near a placid, undisturbed country town, under  semblance of amity, should wage a desperate war for the person and life  of the King.

But once the open  country was reached Tom \"opened her up full,\" and the song the motor  sung was one of power. The vehicle quickly gathered headway and was  soon fairly whizzing along.    \"If we keep this up we'll be there and back in good time,\" remarked Mr.  Damon.    \"Yes, but we can't do it,\" replied his companion. \"The road to Clayton  is a poor one, and we'll soon be on it. Then we'll have to go slow. But  I'll make all the time I can until then.\"    So, for several miles more they crept along, at times having to reduce  to almost a walking pace, because of bad roads. Mr. Damon looked at his  watch almost every other minute.    \"Eleven o'clock,\" he remarked, as they passed a milestone, \"and we're  not half way there. Bless my gizzard, but I'm afraid we won't make it,  Tom. We left about ten, and we ought to be back by two o'clock to do  any good. That's four hours, and it will take some time to transfer the  securities, and get the cash. Every minute counts.\"    \"I know it,\" answered Tom, \"and I'm going to count every minute.\"    With eager eyes he watched every inch of the road, to steer to the best  advantage. His hands gripped the wheel until his knuckles showed white  with the strain, and, every now and then his right hand adjusted the  speed lever or the controller handle, while his foot was on the  emergency brake, ready to stop the car at the first sign of danger.    And there was danger, not infrequently, for the road was up and down  hill, over frail bridges, and along steep cliffs. It was no pleasure  tour they were on.    When a little over half the distance had been made they came to a  better road, and Tom was able to use full speed ahead. Then the  electric went so fast that, had it not been for the steel wind-shield  in front, Mr. Damon, at any rate, would have been short of breath.    \"This is going some!\" he cried to Tom. The lad nodded grimly, and  shoved the controller handle over to the last notch. Then came a bad  stretch and they had to slow down again. As they were about out of it  there came a little flash of fire and the motor stopped.    \"Bless my overshoes!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"What's that; a fuse blown out?\"    \"No,\" replied Tom, with a puzzled air. \"But something has gone wrong.\"  Hastily he got out, and made an examination. He found it was only one  of the unimportant wires which had short-circuited, and it was soon  adjusted. But they had lost five precious minutes. Tom tried to make up  for lost time, but came to a hill a little later, and this reduced  their speed.    \"Do you think we can make it before twelve?\" asked Mr. Damon anxiously.  \"We've got to, if we're to get back before three, Tom.\"    \"I'll try,\" was the calm answer, and Tom's jaw was shut still more  tightly. Once again came more favorable roads and pushing the car to  the limit the occupants were rejoiced, a little later, as they topped a  hill, to come in sight of a fairly large city.    \"There's Clayton!\" cried Mr. Damon.    Ten minutes later they were rolling through the main street, and as  they stopped in front of the bank, the noon whistles blew shrill and  noisily.    \"You did it, Tom!\" cried Mr. Damon, springing out with the valise of  securities. \"Now be ready for the return trip. I'll be with you as soon  as possible.\"    He went up the bank steps three at a time, like some boy instead of an  elderly man. Tom looked after him for a second and then got down to oil  up his car, and make some adjustments that had rattled loose from the  rough road. Unmindful of the curious throng that gathered he crawled  under the machine with his oil-can.    He had finished his work, and was back in his seat, ready to start, but  Mr. Damon had not reappeared.    \"It's taking him a good while to get that cash,\" thought Tom.  \"Maybe  the securities were no good.\"    But, a few minutes later, Mr. Damon came hurrying from the bank. The  valise he carried seemed much heavier than when he went in.    \"It's all right, Tom,\" he said. \"I've got it. Now for the trip home,  and I hope we don't have any accidents. It took longer than I thought  to check over the bonds and receipt for them. But I've got the cash.  Now to save the bank!\"    He took his place beside the young inventor, holding the valise between  his knees, while Tom turned on the power and sent his car dashing down  the street, and toward the road that led to Shopton.          CHAPTER XIX    STOPPED ON THE ROAD      \"Did Mr. Chase make any objection to giving you the cash?\" asked Tom,  as he shoved the controller over another notch, and caused the motor to  make a higher note in its song of speed.    \"Oh, no, he was very nice about it,\" replied Mr. Damon. \"He said he  hoped our bank would pull through. Said if we needed more cash we could  have it.\"    It was nearly one o'clock, and they had the worst part of the journey  yet to go. Thirty miles of stiff roads lay between them and Shopton,  the last five and the first five being fairly good, with, here and  there, soft spots.    Up hill and down went the electric auto. At every opportunity Tom let  out all the speed he could draw from the motor, but there were many  times when he had to slow down. He had just made the ascent of a steep  hill, and was turning into a fairly good road, skirting the edge of a  steep cliff, when there came a sharp report.    \"Bless my soul! That's a fuse, I'm sure of it!\" cried Mr. Damon.    \"No,\" announced Tom, as he quickly shut off the power. \"It's a  puncture. One of the inner tubes of the tire has been pierced. I was  afraid of that tube.\"    \"What have you got to do; put on a new tire?\" asked Mr. Damon.    \"No, I'm going to put on a new wheel. I carry two spare ones with tires  all ready inflated. It won't take long.\"    But the process of changing wheels consumed more time than Tom  anticipated for the nut was stuck, and he and Mr. Damon had to exert  all their strength before they could loosen it. When the new wheel was  in place ten minutes had been lost.    \"Hold on now, I'm going to speed her!\" cried Tom, when they were once  more in their seats, and speed the machine he did. The road was rough,  but despite this the lad turned on almost full power. Over the bumps  they went, around curves and into rain-washed ruts careening from side  to side, and throwing Mr. Damon about, as he expressed it afterward,  \"like a bean inside of a football.\" As for the young inventor his grasp  of the steering wheel, and the manner in which he could brace himself  against the foot pedals, held him more firmly in place. On and on they  rushed, covering mile after mile, and approaching Shopton where so much  depended on their arrival.    Good and bad stretches of the road alternated, but now that Tom had  seen of what mettle his car was made, he did not spare it as much as he  had on the first trip. He saw that his machine would stand hard knocks,  and the way the battery and motor was behaving was a joy to him. He  knew that if he could make that eighty-mile run in safety he stood a  good chance of winning the prize, for no harder test could have been  devised.    But the race was still far from won. There was a particularly unsafe  stretch of road yet to be covered, and then would come a smooth highway  into Shopton.    \"Ten miles more,\" observed Mr. Damon, snapping shut his big gold watch.  \"Ten miles more, and it's a quarter of two now. We ought to be there at  a quarter after, and that will be in good time, eh, Tom?\"    \"I think so, but I don't know about this piece of road we're coming to.  It seems worse than when we passed over it this morning.\"    As he spoke the auto began to slow up, for the wheels had struck some  heavy sand, and it was necessary to reduce the current. Tom turned back  the controller handle, but watched with eager eyes for a sign that the  roadbed was harder, so that he could increase speed.    As the car turned around a curve, passing through a lonely stretch of  country, with woods on either side of the highway, Tom glancing up,  uttered a cry of astonishment.    \"What's the matter; something gone wrong?\" asked his companion.    For answer Tom pointed. There, just ahead of them, was a big load of  hay, and it was evident that the driver, was in no particular hurry.    \"We can't pass that without getting in over our hubs!\" cried Tom. \"If  we turn out the side ditches are so soft that we'll need help to pull  out, and the road is so narrow for several miles that we'll have to  trail along behind that fellow.\"    \"Bless my check book!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"Are we going to lose, after  all, on account of a load of hay? No, I'll buy it from him first, at  double the market price, tip it over, set fire to it, toss it in the  ditch, and then we can go past!\"    \"Maybe that will answer,\" retorted Tom, smiling grimly.    He put on a little more speed, and was soon close up behind the load of  hay, ringing his electric bell as a warning.    \"I say!\" called Mr. Damon to the unseen driver, \"can't you turn out and  let us pass?\"    \"Ha! Hum! Wa'al I guess not!\" came the answer, in unmistakable farmer's  accents. \"You automobile fellers is too gol-hanged smart, racin' along  th' roads. I've got just as good a right here as you fellers have, by  heck!\" The driver did not show himself.    \"We know that,\" responded Tom, as quickly as he could, for he did not  want to anger the man. \"But our machine is so heavy that if we turn  into the ditch I'm afraid we'll be mired.\"    \"Huh! So'll I,\" was the retort from the unseen driver.. \"Think I want  t' spile my load of hay?\"    \"But you have wide tires on, and you wouldn't sink in far,\" answered  the young"]]]
