An  official took less of a chance, if he recommended a son of an  influential family, and he obliged such a candidate so that he could  later count on his help if he himself should come into difficulties.  When, towards the end of the second century B.C., a kind of examination  system was introduced, this attitude was not basically changed.    The country branch of the family by the fact that it controlled large  tracts of land, supplied also the logical tax collectors: they had the  standing and power required for this job. Even if they were appointed in  areas other than their home country (a rule which later was usually  applied), they knew the gentry families of the other district or were  related to them and got their support by appointing their members as  their assistants.    Gentry society continued from Kao Tsu's time to 1948, but it went  through a number of phases of development and changed considerably in  time. We will later outline some of the most important changes. In  general the number of politically leading gentry families was around one  hundred (texts often speak of \"the hundred families\" in this time) and  they were concentrated in the capital; the most important home seats of  these families in Han time were close to the capital and east of it or  in the plains of eastern China, at that time the main centre of grain  production.    We regard roughly the first one thousand years of \"Gentry Society\" as  the period of the Chinese \"Middle Ages\", beginning with the Han dynasty;  the preceding time of the Ch'in was considered as a period of  transition, a time in which the feudal period of \"Antiquity\" came to a  formal end and a new organization of society began to become visible.  Even those authors who do not accept a sociological classification of  periods and many authors who use Marxist categories, believe that with  Ch'in and Han a new era in Chinese history began.          2 _Situation of the Hsiung-nu empire; its relation to the Han empire.  Incorporation of South China_      In the time of the Ch'in dynasty there had already come into unpleasant  prominence north of the Chinese frontier the tribal union, then  relatively small, of the Hsiung-nu. Since then, the Hsiung-nu empire had  destroyed the federation of the Yueeh-chih tribes (some of which seem to  have been of Indo-European language stock) and incorporated their people  into their own federation; they had conquered also the less well  organized eastern pastoral tribes, the Tung-hu and thus had become a  formidable power. Everything goes to show that it had close relations  with the territories of northern China. Many Chinese seem to have  migrated to the Hsiung-nu empire, where they were welcome as artisans  and probably also as farmers; but above all they were needed for the  staffing of a new state administration. The scriveners in the newly  introduced state secretariat were Chinese and wrote Chinese, for at that  time the Hsiung-nu apparently had no written language. There were  Chinese serving as administrators and court officials, and even as  instructors in the army administration, teaching the art of warfare  against non-nomads. But what was the purpose of all this? Mao Tun, the  second ruler of the Hsiung-nu, and his first successors undoubtedly  intended ultimately to conquer China, exactly as many other northern  peoples after them planned to do, and a few of them did. The main  purpose of this was always to bring large numbers of peasants under the  rule of the nomad rulers and so to solve, once for all, the problem of  the provision of additional winter food. Everything that was needed, and  everything that seemed to be worth trying to get as they grew more  civilized, would thus be obtained better and more regularly than by  raids or by tedious commercial negotiations. But if China was to be  conquered and ruled there must exist a state organization of equal  authority to hers; the Hsiung-nu ruler must himself come forward as Son  of Heaven and develop a court ceremonial similar to that of a Chinese  emperor. Thus the basis of the organization of the Hsiung-nu state lay  in its rivalry with the neighbouring China; but the details naturally  corresponded to the special nature of the Hsiung-nu social system. The  young Hsiung-nu feudal state differed from the ancient Chinese feudal  state not only in depending on a nomad economy with only supplementary  agriculture, but also in possessing, in addition to a whole class of  nobility and another of commoners, a stratum of slavery to be analysed  further below. Similar to the Chou state, the Hsiung-nu state contained,  especially around the ruler, an element of court bureaucracy which,  however, never developed far enough to replace the basically feudal  character of administration.    Thus Kao Tsu was faced in Mao Tun not with a mere nomad chieftain but  with the most dangerous of enemies, and Kao Tsu's policy had to be  directed to preventing any interference of the Hsiung-nu in North  Chinese affairs, and above all to preventing alliances between Hsiung-nu  and Chinese. Hsiung-nu alone, with their technique of horsemen's  warfare, would scarcely have been equal to the permanent conquest of the  fortified towns of the north and the Great Wall, although they  controlled a population which may have been in excess of 2,000,000  people. But they might have succeeded with Chinese aid. Actually a  Chinese opponent of Kao Tsu had already come to terms with Mao Tun, and  in 200 B.C. Kao Tsu was very near suffering disaster in northern Shansi,  as a result of which China would have come under the rule of the  Hsiung-nu. But it did not come to that, and Mao Tun made no further  attempt, although the opportunity came several times. Apparently the  policy adopted by his court was not imperialistic but national, in the  uncorrupted sense of the word. It was realized that a country so thickly  populated as China could only be administered from a centre within  China. The Hsiung-nu would thus have had to abandon their home territory  and rule in China itself. That would have meant abandoning the flocks,  abandoning nomad life, and turning into Chinese. The main supporters of  the national policy, the first principle of which was loyalty to the old  ways of life, seem to have been the tribal chieftains. Mao Tun fell in  with their view, and the Hsiung-nu maintained their state as long as  they adhered to that principle--for some seven hundred years. Other  nomad peoples, Toba, Mongols, and Manchus, followed the opposite policy,  and before long they were caught in the mechanism of the much more  highly developed Chinese economy and culture, and each of them  disappeared from the political scene in the course of a century or so.    The national line of policy of the Hsiung-nu did not at all mean an end  of hostilities and raids on Chinese territory, so that Kao Tsu declared  himself ready to give the Hsiung-nu the foodstuffs and clothing  materials they needed if they would make an end of their raids. A treaty  to this effect was concluded, and sealed by the marriage of a Chinese  princess with Mao Tun. This was the first international treaty in the  Far East between two independent powers mutually recognized as equals,  and the forms of international diplomacy developed in this time remained  the standard forms for the next thousand years. The agreement was  renewed at the accession of each new ruler, but was never adhered to  entirely by either side. The needs of the Hsiung-nu increased with the  expansion of their empire and the growing luxury of their court; the  Chinese, on the other hand, wanted to give as little as possible, and no  doubt they did all they could to cheat the Hsiung-nu. Thus, in spite of  the treaties the Hsiung-nu raids went on. With China's progressive  consolidation, the voluntary immigration of Chinese into the Hsiung-nu  empire came to an end, and the Hsiung-nu actually began to kidnap  Chinese subjects. These were the main features of the relations between  Chinese and Hsiung-nu almost until 100 B.C.    In the extreme south, around the present-day Canton, another independent  empire had been formed in the years of transition, under the leadership  of a Chinese. The narrow basis of this realm was no doubt provided by  the trading colonies, but the indigenous population of Yueeh tribes was  insufficiently civilized for the building up of a state that could have  maintained itself against China. Kao Tsu sent a diplomatic mission to  the ruler of this state, and invited him to place himself under Chinese  suzerainty (196 B.C.). The ruler realized that he could offer no serious  resistance, while the existing circumstances guaranteed him virtual  independence and he yielded to Kao Tsu without a struggle.    3 _Brief feudal reaction. Consolidation of the gentry_    Kao Tsu died in 195 B.C. From then to 179 the actual ruler was his  widow, the empress Lue, while children were officially styled emperors.  The empress tried to remove all the representatives of the emperor's  family and to replace them with members of her own family. To secure her  position she revived the feudal system, but she met with strong  resistance from the dynasty and its supporters who already belonged in  many cases to the new gentry, and who did not want to find their  position jeopardized by the creation of new feudal lords.    On the death of the empress her opponents rose, under the leadership of  Kao Tsu's family. Every member of the empress's family was exterminated,  and a son of Kao Tsu, known later under the name of Wen Ti (Emperor  Wen), came to the throne. He reigned from 179 to 157 B.C. Under him  there were still many fiefs, but with the limitation which the emperor  Kao Tsu had laid down shortly before his death: only members of the  imperial family should receive fiefs, to which the title of King was  attached. Thus all the more important fiefs were in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11385"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 446, July 19, 1884 (#19)"],[1," and slate,  maintaining its peculiar character of ore and gangue throughout.    This and all similar veins have certainly been filled with material  brought from a distance, and not derived from the walls.      LEACHING OF IGNEOUS ROCKS.    The arguments against the theory that mineral veins have been produced  by the leaching of superficial _igneous_ rocks are in part the same as  those already cited against the general theory of lateral secretion.  They may be briefly summarized as follows:    1. Thousands of mineral veins in this and other countries occur in  regions remote from eruptive rocks. Into this category come most of  those of the eastern half of the Continent, viz., Canada, New England,  the Alleghany belt, and the Mississippi Valley. Among those I will refer  only to a few selected to represent the greatest range of character,  viz., the Victoria lead mine, near Sault Ste. Marie, the Bruce copper  mine on Lake Huron, the gold-bearing quartz veins of Madoc, the Gatling  gold vein of Marmora, the Acton and the Harvey Hill copper mines of  Canada, the copper veins of Ely, Vermont, and of Blue Hills, Maine, the  silver-bearing lead veins of Newburyport, Mass.; most of the segregated  gold veins of the Alleghany belt, the lead veins of Rossie, Ellenville,  and at other localities farther South; the copper bearing veins of  Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee; the veins carrying  argentiferous galena in Central Kentucky and in Southern Illinois; the  silver, copper, and antimony veins of Arkansas; and the lead and zinc  deposits of Missouri and the Upper Mississippi.    In these widely separated localities are to be found fissure,  segregated, and gash veins, and a great diversity of ores, which have  been derived, sometimes from the adjacent rocks--as in the segregated  veins of the Alleghany belt and the gash veins of the Mississippi  region--and in other cases--where they are contained in true fissure  veins--from a foreign source, but all deposited without the aid of  superficial igneous rocks, either as contributors of matter or force.    2. In the great mineral belt of the Far West, where volcanic emanations  are so abundant, and where they have certainly played an important part  in the formation of ore deposits, the great majority of veins are not in  immediate contact with trap rocks, and they could not, therefore, have  furnished the ores.    A volume might be formed by a list of the cases of this kind, but I can  here allude to a few only, most of which I have myself examined, viz.:    _(a.)_ The great ore chambers of the San Carlos Mountains in Chihuahua,  the largest deposits of ore of which I have any knowledge. These are  contained in heavy beds of limestone, which are cut in various places by  trap dikes, which, as elsewhere, have undoubtedly furnished the stimulus  to chemical action that has resulted in the formation of the ore bodies,  but are too remote to have supplied the material.    _(b.)_ The silver mines of Santa Eulalia, in Chihuahua, from which  during the last century one hundred and twelve millions of dollars were  taken, opened on ore deposits situated in Cretaceous limestones like  those of San Carlos, and apparently similar ore-filled chambers; an  igneous rock caps the hills in the vicinity, but is nowhere in contact  or even proximity to the ore bodies. (See Kimball, _Amer. Jour. Sci,_.  March, 1870.)    _(c.)_ The great chambers of Tombstone, and the copper veins of the  Globe District, the Copper Queen, etc., in Arizona.    _(d.)_ The large bodies of silver-ore at Lake Valley, New Mexico;  chambers in limestone, like _c_.    _(e.)_ The Black Hawk group of gold mines, the Montezuma, Georgetown,  and other silver mines in the granite belt of Colorado.    _(f.)_ The great group of veins and chambers in the Bradshaw, Lincoln,  Star, and Granite districts of Southern Utah, where we find a host of  veins of different character in limestone or granite, with no trap to  which the ores can be credited.    _(g.)_ The Crismon Mammoth vein of Tintic.    _(h.)_ The group of mines opened on the American Fork, on Big and Little  Cottonwood, and in Parley's Park, including the Silver Bell, the Emma,  the Vallejo, the Prince of Wales, the Kessler, the Bonanza, the Climax,  the Pinon, and the Ontario. (The latter, the greatest silver mine now  known in the country, lies in quartzite, and the trap is near, but not  in contact with the vein.)    _(i.)_ In Nevada, the ore deposits of Pioche, Tempiute, Tybo, Eureka,  White Pine, and Cherry Creek, on the east side of the State, with those  of Austin, Belmont, and a series too great for enumeration in the  central and western portions.    _(j.)_ In California, the Bodie, Mariposa, Grass Valley, and other  mines.[1]    _(k.)_ In Idaho, those of the Poor Man in the Owyhee district, the  principal veins of the Wood River region, the Ramshorn at Challis, the  Custer and Charles Dickens, at Bonanza City, etc.    [Footnote 1: See Redmond's Report _(California Geol. Survey Mining  Statistics, No 1),_ where seventy-seven mines are enumerated, of which  three are said to be in \"porphyritic schist,\" all the others in granite,  mica schist, clay, slate, etc.]    In nearly all these localities we may find evidence not only that the  ore deposits have not been derived from the leaching of igneous rocks,  but also that they have not come from those of any kind which form the  walls of the veins.    The gold-bearing quartz veins of Deadwood are so closely associated with  dikes of porphyry, that they may have been considered as illustrations  of the potency of trap dikes in producing concentration of metals. But  we have conclusive evidence that the gold was there in Archaean times,  while the igneous rocks are all of modern, probably of Tertiary, date.  This proof is furnished by the \"Cement mines\" of the Potsdam sandstone.  This is the beach of the Lower Silurian sea when it washed the shores of  an Archaean island, now the Black Hills. The waves that produced this  beach beat against cliffs of granite and slate containing quartz veins  carrying gold. Fragments of this auriferous quartz, and the gold beaten  out of them and concentrated by the waves, were in places buried in the  sand beach in such quantity as to form deposits from which a large  amount of gold is now being taken. Without this demonstration of the  origin and antiquity of the gold, it might very well have been supposed  to be derived from the eruptive rock.    Strong arguments against the theory that the leaching of superficial  igneous rocks has supplied the materials filling mineral veins, are  furnished by the facts observed in the districts where igneous rocks are  most prevalent, viz.: (1.) _Such districts are proverbially barren of  useful minerals_. (2.) _Where these occur, the same sheet of rock may  contain several systems of veins with different ores and gangues._    The great lava plain of Snake River, the Pedrigal country of eastern  Oregon, Northern California and Mexico are without valuable ore  deposits. The same may be said of the Pancake Range and other mountain  chains of igneous rock in Nevada, while the adjacent ranges composed of  sedimentary rocks are rich in ore deposits of various kinds. A still  stronger case is furnished by the Cascade Mountains, which, north of the  California line, are composed almost exclusively of erupted material,  and yet in all this belt, so far as now known, not a single valuable  mine has been opened. In contrast with this is the condition of things  in California, where the Sierra Nevada is composed of metamorphic rocks  which have been shown to be the repositories of vast quantities of gold,  silver, and copper. Cases belonging to this category may be found at  Rosita and Silver Cliff, where the diversity in the ores of the mines  already enumerated can hardly be reconciled with the theory of a common  origin. At Lake City the prevailing porphyry holds the veins of the Ute  and Ulay and the Ocean Wave mines, which are similar, and the Hotchkiss,  the Belle, etc., entirely different.    We have no evidence that any volcanic eruption has drawn its material  from zones or magmas especially rich in metals or their ores, and on the  contrary, volcanic districts, like those mentioned, and regions, such as  the Sandwich Islands, where the greatest, eruptions have taken place,  are poorest in metalliferous deposits.    All the knowledge we have of the subject justifies the inference that  most of the igneous rocks which have been poured out in our Western  Territories are but fused conditions of sediments which form the  substructure of that country. Over the great mineral belt which lies  between the Sierra Nevada and the front range of the Rocky Mountains,  and extends not only across the whole breadth of our territory, but far  into Mexico, the surface was once underlain by a series of Palaeozoic  sedimentary strata not less than twenty to thirty thousand feet in  thickness; and beneath these, at the sides, and doubtless below, were  Archaeun rocks, also metamorphosed sediments. Through these the ores of  the metals were generally though sparsely distributed. In the  convulsions which have in recent times broken up this so long quiet and  stable portion of the earth's crust (and which have resulted in  depositing in thousands of cracks and cavities the ores we now mine),  portions of the old table-land were in places set up at high angles  forming mountain chains, and doubtless extending to the zone of fusion  below. Between these blocks of sedimentary rocks oozed up through the  lines of fracture quantities of fused material, which also sometimes  formed mountain chains; and it is possible and even probable that the  rocks composing the volcanic ridges are but phases of the same materials  that form the sedimentary chains There is, therefore, no _a priori_  reason why the leaching of one group should furnish more ore than the"]]]
