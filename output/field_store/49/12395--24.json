Women like these demanded  something in return for the honor they conferred upon a man by marrying  him. Wealth? they had it. Position? that was theirs also. Consideration?  ah, what consideration had I to give? I turned from them with distaste.    \"My cousin Evelyn gave me no help. She was a proud woman and loved my  money and my expectations as much as she did me.    \"'If you must marry another woman to retain your wealth, marry, said  she, 'but do not marry one of my associates. I will have no rival in my  own empire; your wife must be a plainer and a less aspiring woman than  Evelyn Blake. Yet do not discredit your name,--which is mine,' she would  always add.    \"Meanwhile the days flew by. If my own conscience had allowed me to  forget the fact, my father's eagerly inquiring, but sternly unrelenting  gaze as I came each evening to his bedside, would have kept it  sufficiently in my mind. I began to feel like one in the power of  some huge crushing machine whose slowly descending weight he in vain  endeavors to escape.    \"How or when the thought of Luttra first crossed my mind I cannot  say. At first I recoiled at the suggestion and put it away from me in  disdain; but it ever recurred and with it so many arguments in her favor  that before long I found myself regarding it as a refuge. To be sure she  was a waif and a stray, but that seemed to be the kind of wife demanded  of me. She was allied to rogues if not villains, I knew; but then had  she not cut all connection with them, dropped away from them, planted  her feet on new ground which they would never invade? I commenced to  cherish the idea. With this friendless, grateful, unassuming protegee of  mine for a wife, I would be as little bound as might be. She would  ask nothing, and I need give nothing, beyond a home and the common  attentions required of a gentleman and a friend. Then she was not  disagreeable, nor was her beauty of a type to suggest the charms of  her I had lost. None of the graces of the haughty patrician lady whose  lightest gesture was a command, would appear in this humble girl, to  mock and constrain me. No, I should have a fair wife and an obedient  one, but no vulgarized shadow of Evelyn, thank God, or of any of her  fashionably dressed friends.    \"Advanced thus far towards the end, I went to see Luttra. I had not  beheld her since the morning we parted at the door of that little  cottage in Vermont, and her presence caused me a shock. This, the humble  waif with the appealing grateful eyes I had expected to encounter? this  tall and slender creature with an aureola of golden hair about a face  that it was an education to behold! I felt a half movement of anger as I  surveyed her. I had been cheated; I had planted a grape seed and a palm  tree had sprung up in its place. I was so taken aback, my salute lost  something of the benevolent condescension I had intended to infuse into  it. She seemed to feel my embarassment and a half smile fluttered to  her lips. That smile decided me. It was sweet but above all else it was  appealing.    \"How I won that woman to marry me in ten days time I care not to  state. Not by holding up my wealth and position before her. Something  restrained me from that. I was resolved, and perhaps it was the only  point of light in my conduct at that time, not to buy this young girl. I  never spoke of my expectations, I never alluded to my present advantages  yet I won her.    \"We were married, there, in Troy in the quietest and most unpretending  manner. Why the fact has never transpired I cannot say. I certainly took  no especial pains to conceal it at the time, though I acknowledge  that after our separation I did resort to such measures as I thought  necessary, to suppress what had become gall and wormwood to my pride.    \"My first move after the ceremony was to bring her immediately to New  York and to this house. With perhaps a pardonable bitterness of spirit,  I had refrained from any notification of my intentions, and it was as  strangers might enter an unprepared dwelling, that we stepped across the  threshold of this house and passed immediately to my father's room.    \"'I can give you no wedding and no honeymoon,' I had told her. 'My  father is dying and demands my care. From the altar to a death-bed may  be sad for you, but it is an inevitable condition of your marriage with  me.' And she had accepted her fate with a deep unspeakable smile it has  taken me long months of loneliness and suffering to understand.    \"'Father, I bring you my bride,' were my first words to him as the door  closed behind us shutting us in with the dread, invisible Presence that  for so long a time had been relentlessly advancing upon our home.    \"I shall never forget how he roused himself in his bed, nor with what  eager eyes he read her young face and surveyed her slight form swaying  towards him in her sudden emotion like a flame in a breeze. Nor while I  live shall I lose sight of the spasm of uncontrollable joy with which  he lifted his aged arms towards her, nor the look with which she sprang  from my side and nestled, yes nestled, on the breast that never to my  remembrance had opened itself to me even in the years of my earliest  childhood. For my father was a stern man who believed in holding love at  arm's length and measured affection by the depth of awe it inspired.    \"'My daughter!' broke from his lips, and he never inquired who she was  or what; no, not even when after a moment of silence she raised her head  and with a sudden low cry of passionate longing looked in his face and  murmured,    \"'I never had a father.'    \"Sirs, it is impossible for me to continue without revealing depths  of pride and bitterness in my own nature, from which I now shrink with  unspeakable pain. So far from being touched by this scene, I felt myself  grow hard under it. If he had been disappointed in my choice, queried  at it or even been simply pleased at my obedience, I might have accepted  the wife I had won, and been tolerably grateful. But to love her, admire  her, glory in her when Evelyn Blake had never succeeded in winning a  glance from his eyes that was not a public disapprobation! I could  not endure it; my whole being rebelled, and a movement like hate took  possession of me.    \"Bidding my wife to leave me with my father alone, I scarcely waited  for the door to close upon the poor young thing before all that had been  seething in my breast for a month, burst from me in the one cry,    \"'I have brought you a daughter as you commanded me. Now give me the  blessing you promised and let me go; for I cannot live with a woman I do  not love.'    \"Instantly, and before his lips could move, the door opened and the  woman I thus repudiated in the first dawning hour of her young bliss,  stood before us. My God! what a face! When I think of it now in the  night season--when from dreams that gloomy as they are, are often  elysian to the thoughts which beset me in my waking hours, I suddenly  arouse to see starting upon me from the surrounding shadows that young  fair brow with its halo of golden tresses, blotted, ay blotted by the  agony that turned her that instant into stone, I wonder I did not take  out the pistol that lay in the table near which I stood, and shoot her  lifeless on the spot as some sort of a compensation for the misery I had  caused her. I say I wonder now: then I only thought of braving it out.    \"Straight as a dart, but with that look on her face, she came towards  us. 'Did I hear aright?' were the words that came from her lips. 'Have  you married me, a woman beneath your station as I now perceive, because  you were commanded to do so? Have you not loved me? given me that which  alone makes marriage a sacrament or even a possibility? and must you  leave this house made sacred by the recumbent form of your dying father  if I remain within it?'    \"I saw my father's stiff and pallid lips move silently as though  he would answer for me if he could, and summoning up what courage I  possessed, I told her that I deeply regretted she had overheard my  inconsiderate words. That I had never meant to wound her, whatever  bitterness lay in my heart towards one who had thwarted me in my dearest  and most cherished hopes. That I humbly begged her pardon and would so  far acknowledge her claim upon me as to promise that I would not leave  my home at this time, if it distressed her; my desire being not to  injure her, only to protect myself.    \"O the scorn that mounted to her brow at these weak words. Not scorn of  me, thank God, worthy as I was of it that hour, but scorn of my slight  opinion of her.    \"'Then I heard aright,' she murmured, and waited with a look that would  not be gainsaid.    \"I could only bow my head, cursing the day I was born.    \"'Holman! Holman!' came in agonized entreaty from the bed, 'you will not  rob me of my daughter now?'    \"Startled, I looked up. Luttra was half way to the door.    \"'What are you going to do?' cried I, bounding towards her.    \"She stopped me with a look. 'The son must never forsake the father,'  said she. 'If either of us must leave the house this day, let it be I.'  Then in a softer tone, 'When you asked me to be your wife, I who had  worshipped you from the moment you entered my father's house on the  memorable night I left it, was so overcome at your condescension that  I forgot you did not preface it by the usual passionate, 'I love you,'  which more than the marriage ring binds two hearts together. In the  glamour and glow of my joy, I did not see that the smile that was in my  heart, was missing from your face. I was to be your wife and that was  enough, or so I thought then, for I loved you. Ah, and I do now, my  husband, love you so that I leave you. Were it for your happiness I  would do more than that, I would give you back your freedom, but from  what I hear, it seems that you need a wife in name and I will be but  fulfilling"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11692"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 03 (#19)"],[1,"at the inmost heart.  He can no longer trust me. Then no longer  Can I retreat--so come that which must come.  Still destiny preserves its due relations,  The heart within us is its absolute  Vicegerent.

[_To the _COUNTESS, _who cannot conceal her triumph_.]    No exultation! woman, triumph not!  For jealous are the Powers of Destiny.  Joy premature, and shouts ere victory,  Encroach upon their rights and privileges.  We sow the seed, and they the growth determine.

He sends me word from Linz that he lies sick;  But I have sure intelligence that he  Secretes himself at Frauenberg with Gallas.  Secure them both, and send them to me hither.  Remember, thou takest on thee the command  Of those same Spanish regiments,--constantly  Make preparation, and be never ready;  And if they urge thee to draw out against me,  Still answer YES, and stand as thou wert fetter'd;  I know that it is doing thee a service  To keep thee out of action in this business.  Thou lovest to linger on in fair appearances;  Steps of extremity are not thy province;  Therefore have I sought out this part for thee.  Thou wilt this time be of most service to me  By thy inertness. The mean time, if fortune  Declare itself on my side, thou wilt know  What is to do.    _Enter_ MAX PICCOLOMINI                     Now go, Octavio.  This night must thou be off, take my own horses  Him here I keep with me--make short farewell--  Trust me, I think, we all shall meet again  In joy and thriving fortunes.    OCTAVIO (_to his son_).                       I shall see you  Yet ere I go.      SCENE II    WALLENSTEIN, MAX PICCOLOMINI    MAX. (_advances to him_).    My General?    WALLENSTEIN.              That I am no longer, if  Thou stylest thyself the Emperor's officer.    MAX.    Then thou wilt leave the army, General?    WALLENST.    I have renounced the service of the Emperor.    MAX.    And thou wilt leave the army?    WALLENSTEIN.                         Rather hope I  To bind it nearer still and faster to me.    [_He seats himself_.]    Yes, Max, I have delay'd to open it to thee,  Even till the hour of acting 'gins to strike.  Youth's fortunate feeling doth seize easily  The absolute right, yea, and a joy it is  To exercise the single apprehension  Where the sums square in proof;  But where it happens that of two sure evils  One must be taken, where the heart not wholly  Brings itself back from out the strife of duties,  There 'tis a blessing to have no election,  And blank necessity is grace and favor.  --This is now present: do not look behind thee,--  It can no more avail thee. Look thou forwards!  Think not! judge not! prepare thyself to act!  The Court--it hath determined on my ruin,  Therefore I will be beforehand with them.  We'll join the Swedes--right gallant fellows are they,  And our good friends.    [_He stops himself, expecting_ PICCOLOMINI's _answer_.]    I have ta'en thee by surprise. Answer me not.  I grant thee time to recollect thyself.    [_He rises, retires at the back of the stage_. MAX _remains for a  long time motionless, in a trance of excessive anguish. At his  first motion_ WALLENSTEIN _returns, and places himself before  him_.]    MAX.    My General, this day thou makest me  Of age to speak in my own right and person,  For till this day I have been spared the trouble  To find out my own road. Thee have I follow'd  With most implicit unconditional faith,  Sure of the right path if I follow'd thee.  Today, for the first time, dost thou refer  Me to myself, and forcest me to make  Election between thee and my own heart.    WALLENST.    Soft cradled thee thy Fortune till today;  Thy duties thou couldst exercise in sport,  Indulge all lovely instincts, act forever  With undivided heart. It can remain  No longer thus. Like enemies, the roads  Start from each other. Duties strive with duties.  Thou must needs choose thy party in the war  Which is now kindling 'twixt thy friend and him  Who is thy Emperor.    MAX.                     War! is that the name?  War is as frightful as heaven's pestilence,  Yet it is good. Is it heaven's will as that is?  Is that a good war, which against the Emperor  Thou wagest with the Emperor's own army?  O God of heaven! what a change is this!  Beseems it me to offer such persuasion  To thee, who like the fix'd star of the pole  Wert all I gazed at on life's trackless ocean?  O! what a rent thou makest in my heart!  The ingrain'd instinct of old reverence,  The holy habit of obediency,  Must I pluck live asunder from thy name?  Nay, do not turn thy countenance upon me--  It always was as a god looking upon me!  Duke Wallenstein, its power has not departed.  The senses still are in thy bonds, although,  Bleeding, the soul hath freed itself.    WALLENSTEIN.                         Max, hear me.    MAX.    O! do it not, I pray thee, do it not!  There is a pure and noble soul within thee  Knows not of this unblest, unlucky doing.  Thy will is chaste, it is thy fancy only  Which hath polluted thee; and innocence--  It will not let itself be driven away  From that world-awing aspect. Thou wilt not,  Thou canst not, end in this. It would reduce  All human creatures to disloyalty  Against the nobleness of their own nature.  'Twill justify the vulgar misbelief  Which holdeth nothing noble in free will  And trusts itself to impotence alone  Made powerful only in an unknown power.    WALLENST.    The world will judge me sternly, I expect it.  Already have I said to my own self  All thou canst say to me. Who but avoids  The extreme, can he by going round avoid it?  But here there is no choice. Yes--I must use  Or suffer violence--so stands the case;  There remains nothing possible but that.    MAX.    O that is never possible for thee!  'Tis the last desperate resource of those  Cheap souls to whom their honor, their good name  Is their poor _saving_, their last worthless _keep_,  Which, having staked and lost, they stake themselves  In the mad rage of gaming. Thou art rich  And glorious; with an unpolluted heart  Thou canst make conquest of whate'er seems highest!  But he, who once hath acted infamy,  Does nothing more in this world.    WALLENSTEIN (_grasps his hand_).                             Calmly, Max!  Much that is great and excellent will we  Perform together yet. And if we only  Stand on the height with dignity, 'tis soon  Forgotten, Max, by what road we ascended.  Believe me, many a crown shines spotless now  That yet was deeply sullied in the winning.  To the evil spirit doth the earth belong,  Not to the good. All that the powers divine  Send from above are universal blessings,  Their light rejoices us, their air refreshes,  But never yet was man enrich'd by them  In their eternal realm no _property_  Is to be struggled for--all there is general  The jewel, the all-valued gold we win  From the deceiving Powers, depraved in nature,  That dwell beneath the day and blessed sun-light.  Not without sacrifices are they render'd  Propitious, and there lives no soul on earth  That e'er retired unsullied from their service.    MAX.    Whate'er is human, to the human being  Do I allow--and to the vehement  And striving spirit readily I pardon  The excess of action; but to thee, my General,  Above _all_ others make I large concession.  For thou must move a world, and be the master--  He kills thee who condemns thee to inaction.  So be it then! maintain thee in thy post  By violence. Resist the Emperor,  And, if it must be, force with force repel:  I will not praise it, yet I can forgive it.  But not--not to the _traitor_--yes!--the word  Is spoken out--  Not to the traitor can I yield a pardon.  That is no mere excess! that is no error  Of human nature--that is wholly different;  O that is black, black as the pit of hell!            [WALLENSTEIN _betrays a sudden agitation_.]    Thou canst not hear it _named_, and wilt thou _do_ it?  O, turn back to thy duty! That thou canst  I hold it certain. Send me to Vienna:  I'll make thy peace for thee with the Emperor.  He knows thee not. But I do know thee. He  Shall see thee, Duke, with my unclouded eye,  And I bring back his confidence to thee.    WALLENST.    It is too late! Thou knowest not what has happen'd.    MAX.    Were it too late, and were things gone so far,  That a crime only could prevent thy fall,  Then--fall! fall honorably, even as thou stood'st!  Lose the command. Go from the stage of war,  Thou canst with splendor do it--do it too  With innocence. Thou hast lived much for others,  At length live thou for thy own self. I follow thee;  My destiny I never part from thine.    WALLENST.    It is too late! Even now, while thou art losing  Thy words, one after the other are the milestones  Left fast behind by my post couriers  Who bear the order on to Prague and Egra.    [MAX _stands as convulsed, with a gesture and_ _countenance  expressing the most intense_ _anguish_.]    Yield thyself to it. We act as we are forced.  _I_ cannot give assent to my own shame  And ruin. _Thou_--no--thou canst not forsake me!  So let us do what must be done, with dignity,  With a firm step. What am I doing worse  Than did famed Caesar at the Rubicon,  When he the legions led against his country,  The which his country had delivered to him?  Had he thrown down the sword he had been lost,  As I were if I but disarm'd myself.  I trace out something in me of this spirit;  Give me his luck, _that other thing_ I'll bear.
