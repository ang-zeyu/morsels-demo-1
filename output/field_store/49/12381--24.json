To some extent these statues  bear out Vasari's tradition that the platform in the first design was  meant to sustain figures of the contemplative and active life of the  soul--Dante's Leah and Rachel.    This great scheme was never carried out. The fragments which may be  safely assigned to it are the Moses at S. Pietro in Vincoli and the  two bound captives of the Louvre; the Madonna and Child, Leah and  Rachel, and two seated statues also at S. Pietro in Vincoli, belong to  the plan, though these have undergone considerable alterations. Some  other scattered fragments of the sculptor's work may possibly be  connected with its execution. Four male figures roughly hewn, which  are now wrought into the rock-work of a grotto in the Boboli Gardens,  together with the young athlete trampling on a prostrate old man  (called the Victory) and the Adonis of the Museo Nazionale at  Florence, have all been ascribed to the sepulchre of Julius in one or  other of its stages. But these attributes are doubtful, and will be  criticised in their proper place and time. Suffice it now to say that  Vasari reports, beside the Moses, Victory, and two Captives at the  Louvre, eight figures for the tomb blocked out by Michelangelo at  Rome, and five blocked out at Florence.    Continuing the history of this tragic undertaking, we come to the year  1516. On the 8th of July in that year, Michelangelo signed a new  contract, whereby the previous deed of 1513 was annulled. Both of the  executors were alive and parties to this second agreement. \"A model  was made, the width of which is stated at twenty-one feet, after the  monument had been already sculptured of a width of almost twenty-three  feet. The architectural design was adhered to with the same pedestals  and niches and the same crowning cornice of the first story. There  were to be six statues in front, but the conquered provinces were now  dispensed with. There was also to be one niche only on each flank, so  that the projection of the monument from the wall was reduced more  than half, and there were to be only twelve statues beneath the  cornice and one relief, instead of twenty-four statues and three  reliefs. On the summit of this basement a shrine was to be erected,  within which was placed the effigy of the Pontiff on his sarcophagus,  with two heavenly guardians. The whole of the statues described in  this third contract amount to nineteen.\" Heath Wilson observes, with  much propriety, that the most singular fact about these successive  contracts is the departure from certain fixed proportions both of the  architectural parts and the statues, involving a serious loss of  outlay and of work. Thus the two Captives of the Louvre became  useless, and, as we know, they were given away to Ruberto Strozzi in a  moment of generosity by the sculptor. The sitting figures detailed in  the deed of 1516 are shorter than the Moses by one foot. The standing  figures, now at S. Pietro in Vincoli, correspond to the  specifications. What makes the matter still more singular is, that  after signing the contract under date July 8, 1516, Michelangelo in  November of the same year ordered blocks of marble from Carrara, with  measurements corresponding to the specifications of the deed of 1513.    The miserable tragedy of the sepulchre dragged on for another sixteen  years. During this period the executors of Julius passed away, and the  Duke Francesco Maria della Rovere replaced them. He complained that  Michelangelo neglected the tomb, which was true, although the fault  lay not with the sculptor, but with the Popes, his taskmasters. Legal  proceedings were instituted to recover a large sum of money, which, it  was alleged, had been disbursed without due work delivered by the  master. Michelangelo had recourse to Clement VII., who, being anxious  to monopolise his labour, undertook to arrange matters with the Duke.  On the 29th of April 1532 a third and solemn contract was signed at  Rome in presence of the Pope, witnessed by a number of illustrious  personages. This third contract involved a fourth design for the tomb,  which Michelangelo undertook to furnish, and at the same time to  execute six statues with his own hand. On this occasion the notion of  erecting it in S. Peter's was finally abandoned. The choice lay  between two other Roman churches, that of S. Maria del Popolo, where  monuments to several members of the Della Rovere family existed, and  that of S. Pietro in Vincoli, from which Julius II. had taken his  cardinal's title. Michelangelo decided for the latter, on account of  its better lighting. The six statues promised by Michelangelo are  stated in the contract to be \"begun and not completed, extant at the  present date in Rome or in Florence.\" Which of the several statues  blocked out for the monument were to be chosen is not stated; and as  there are no specifications in the document, we cannot identify them  with exactness. At any rate, the Moses must have been one; and it is  possible that the Leah and Rachel, Madonna, and two seated statues,  now at S. Pietro, were the other five.    It might have been thought that at last the tragedy had dragged on to  its conclusion. But no; there was a fifth act, a fourth contract, a  fifth design. Paul III. succeeded to Clement VII., and, having seen  the Moses in Michelangelo's workshop, declared that this one statue  was enough for the deceased Pope's tomb. The Duke Francesco Maria  della Rovere died in 1538, and was succeeded by his son, Guidobaldo  II. The new Duke's wife was a granddaughter of Paul III., and this may  have made him amenable to the Pope's influence. At all events, upon  the 20th of August 1542 a final contract was signed, stating that  Michelangelo had been prevented \"by just and legitimate impediments  from carrying out\" his engagement under date April 29, 1532, releasing  him from the terms of the third deed, and establishing new conditions.  The Moses, finished by the hand of Michelangelo, takes the central  place in this new monument. Five other statues are specified: \"to wit,  a Madonna with the child in her arms, which is already finished; a  Sibyl, a Prophet, an Active Life and a Contemplative Life, blocked out  and nearly completed by the said Michelangelo.\" These four were given  to Raffaello da Montelupo to finish. The reclining portrait-statue of  Julius, which was carved by Maso del Bosco, is not even mentioned in  this contract. But a deed between the Duke's representative and the  craftsmen Montelupo and Urbino exists, in which the latter undertakes  to see that Michelangelo shall retouch the Pope's face.    Thus ended the tragedy of the tomb of Pope Julius II. It is supposed  to have been finally completed in 1545, and was set up where it still  remains uninjured at S. Pietro in Vincoli.      IV    I judged it needful to anticipate the course of events by giving this  brief history of a work begun in 1505, and carried on with so many  hindrances and alterations through forty years of Michelangelo's life.  We shall often have to return to it, since the matter cannot be  lightly dismissed. The tomb of Julius empoisoned Michelangelo's  manhood, hampered his energy, and brought but small if any profit to  his purse. In one way or another it is always cropping up, and may be  said to vex his biographers and the students of his life as much as it  annoyed himself. We may now return to those early days in Rome, when  the project had still a fascination both for the sculptor and his  patron.    The old Basilica of S. Peter on the Vatican is said to have been built  during the reign of Constantine, and to have been consecrated in 324  A.D. It was one of the largest of those Roman buildings, measuring 435  feet in length from the great door to the end of the tribune. A  spacious open square or atrium, surrounded by a cloister-portico, gave  access to the church. This, in the Middle Ages, gained the name of the  Paradiso. A kind of tabernacle, in the centre of the square, protected  the great bronze fir-cone, which was formerly supposed to have crowned  the summit of Hadrian's Mausoleum, the Castle of S. Angelo. Dante, who  saw it in the courtyard of S. Peter's, used it as a standard for his  giant Nimrod. He says--      _La faccia sua ml parea lunga e grossa,    Come la pina di San Pietro a Roma.                                        --(Inf._ xxxi. 58.)    This mother-church of Western Christendom was adorned inside and out  with mosaics in the style of those which may still be seen at Ravenna.  Above the lofty row of columns which flanked the central aisle ran  processions of saints and sacred histories. They led the eye onward to  what was called the Arch of Triumph, separating this portion of the  building from the transept and the tribune. The concave roof of the  tribune itself was decorated with a colossal Christ, enthroned between  S. Peter and S. Paul, surveying the vast spaces of his house: the lord  and master, before whom pilgrims from all parts of Europe came to pay  tribute and to perform acts of homage. The columns were of precious  marbles, stripped from Pagan palaces and temples; and the roof was  tiled with plates of gilded bronze, torn in the age of Heraclius from  the shrine of Venus and of Roma on the Sacred Way.    During the eleven centuries which elapsed between its consecration and  the decree for its destruction, S. Peter's had been gradually enriched  with a series of monuments, inscriptions, statues, frescoes, upon  which were written the annals of successive ages of the Church. Giotto  worked there under Benedict II. in 1340. Pope after Pope was buried  there. In the early period of Renaissance sculpture, Mino da Fiesole,  Pollaiuolo, and Filarete added works in bronze and marble, which blent  the grace of Florentine religious tradition with quaint neo-pagan  mythologies. These treasures, priceless"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11252"],[0,"Martin Hewitt, Investigator (#19)"],[1," unusual thing for a casual caller to do,  before even knowing whether you were in. This made me watch him closely. I  perceived with increased interest that the stick was exactly of the same  kind and pattern as one already standing there, also a curious thing. I  kept my eyes carefully on those sticks, and was all the more interested  and edified to see, when he left, that he took the _other_ stick--not the  one he came with--from the stand, and carried it away, leaving his own  behind. I might have followed him, but I decided that more could be  learned by staying, as, in fact, proved to be the case. This, by the by,  is the stick he carried away with him. I took the liberty of fetching it  back from Westminster, because I conceive it to be Ritier's property.\"    Hewitt produced the stick. It was an ordinary, thick Malacca cane, with a  buck-horn handle and a silver band. Hewitt bent it across his knee and  laid it on the table.    \"Yes,\" Dixon answered, \"that is Ritter's stick. I think I have often seen  it in the stand. But what in the world----\"    \"One moment; I'll just fetch the stick Mirsky left behind.\" And Hewitt  stepped across the corridor.    He returned with another stick, apparently an exact fac-simile of the  other, and placed it by the side of the other.    \"When your assistants went into the inner room, I carried this stick off  for a minute or two. I knew it was not Worsfold's, because there was an  umbrella there with his initial on the handle. Look at this.\"    Martin Hewitt gave the handle a twist and rapidly unscrewed it from the  top. Then it was seen that the stick was a mere tube of very thin metal,  painted to appear like a Malacca cane.    \"It was plain at once that this was no Malacca cane--it wouldn't bend.  Inside it I found your tracings, rolled up tightly. You can get a  marvelous quantity of thin tracing-paper into a small compass by tight  rolling.\"    \"And this--this was the way they were brought back!\" the engineer  exclaimed. \"I see that clearly. But how did they get away? That's as  mysterious as ever.\"    \"Not a bit of it! See here. Mirsky gets hold of Ritter, and they agree to  get your drawings and photograph them. Ritter is to let his confederate  have the drawings, and Mirsky is to bring them back as soon as possible,  so that they sha'n't be missed for a moment. Ritter habitually carries  this Malacca cane, and the cunning of Mirsky at once suggests that this  tube should be made in outward fac-simile. This morning Mirsky keeps the  actual stick, and Ritter comes to the office with the tube. He seizes the  first opportunity--probably when you were in this private room, and  Worsfold was talking to you from the corridor--to get at the tracings,  roll them up tightly, and put them in the tube, putting the tube back into  the umbrella-stand. At half-past twelve, or whenever it was, Mirsky turns  up for the first time with the actual stick and exchanges them, just as he  afterward did when he brought the drawings back.\"    \"Yes, but Mirsky came half an hour after they were--Oh, yes, I see. What a  fool I was! I was forgetting. Of course, when I first missed the tracings,  they were in this walking-stick, safe enough, and I was tearing my hair  out within arm's reach of them!\"    \"Precisely. And Mirsky took them away before your very eyes. I expect  Ritter was in a rare funk when he found that the drawings were missed. He  calculated, no doubt, on your not wanting them for the hour or two they  would be out of the office.\"    \"How lucky that it struck me to jot a pencil-note on one of them! I might  easily have made my note somewhere else, and then I should never have  known that they had been away.\"    \"Yes, they didn't give you any too much time to miss them. Well, I think  the rest pretty clear. I brought the tracings in here, screwed up the sham  stick and put it back. You identified the tracings and found none missing,  and then my course was pretty clear, though it looked difficult. I knew  you would be very naturally indignant with Ritter, so, as I wanted to  manage him myself, I told you nothing of what he had actually done, for  fear that, in your agitated state, you might burst out with something that  would spoil my game. To Ritter I pretended to know nothing of the return  of the drawings or _how_ they had been stolen--the only things I did know  with certainty. But I _did_ pretend to know all about Mirsky--or  Hunter--when, as a matter of fact, I knew nothing at all, except that he  probably went under more than one name. That put Ritter into my hands  completely. When he found the game was up, he began with a lying  confession. Believing that the tracings were still in the stick and that  we knew nothing of their return, he said that they had not been away, and  that he would fetch them--as I had expected he would. I let him go for  them alone, and, when he returned, utterly broken up by the discovery that  they were not there, I had him altogether at my mercy. You see, if he had  known that the drawings were all the time behind your book-case, he might  have brazened it out, sworn that the drawings had been there all the time,  and we could have done nothing with him. We couldn't have sufficiently  frightened him by a threat of prosecution for theft, because there the  things were in your possession, to his knowledge.    \"As it was he answered the helm capitally: gave us Mirsky's address on the  envelope, and wrote the letter that was to have got him out of the way  while I committed burglary, if that disgraceful expedient had not been  rendered unnecessary. On the whole, the case has gone very well.\"    \"It has gone marvelously well, thanks to yourself. But what shall I do  with Ritter?\"    \"Here's his stick--knock him down-stairs with it, if you like. I should  keep the tube, if I were you, as a memento. I don't suppose the  respectable Mirsky will ever call to ask for it. But I should certainly  kick Ritter out of doors--or out of window, if you like--without delay.\"    Mirsky was caught, and, after two remands at the police-court, was  extradited on the charge of forging Russian notes. It came out that he had  written to the embassy, as Hewitt had surmised, stating that he had  certain valuable information to offer, and the letter which Hewitt had  seen delivered was an acknowledgment, and a request for more definite  particulars. This was what gave rise to the impression that Mirsky had  himself informed the Russian authorities of his forgeries. His real intent  was very different, but was never guessed.     *       *       *       *       *    \"I wonder,\" Hewitt has once or twice observed, \"whether, after all, it  would not have paid the Russian authorities better on the whole if I had  never investigated Mirsky's little note factory. The Dixon torpedo was  worth a good many twenty-ruble notes.\"          V.      THE QUINTON JEWEL AFFAIR.    It was comparatively rarely that Hewitt came into contact with members of  the regular criminal class--those, I mean, who are thieves, of one sort or  another, by exclusive profession. Still, nobody could have been better  prepared than Hewitt for encountering this class when it became necessary.  By some means, which I never quite understood, he managed to keep abreast  of the very latest fashions in the ever-changing slang dialect of the  fraternity, and he was a perfect master of the more modern and debased  form of Romany. So much so that frequently a gypsy who began (as they  always do) by pretending that he understood nothing, and never heard of a  gypsy language, ended by confessing that Hewitt could _rokker_ better than  most Romany _chals_ themselves.    By this acquaintance with their habits and talk Hewitt was sometimes able  to render efficient service in cases of especial importance. In the  Quinton jewel affair Hewitt came into contact with a very accomplished  thief.    The case will probably be very well remembered. Sir Valentine Quinton,  before he married, had been as poor as only a man of rank with an old  country establishment to keep up can be. His marriage, however, with the  daughter of a wealthy financier had changed all that, and now the Quinton  establishment was carried on on as lavish a scale as might be; and,  indeed, the extravagant habits of Lady Quinton herself rendered it an  extremely lucky thing that she had brought a fortune with her.    Among other things her jewels made quite a collection, and chief among  them was the great ruby, one of the very few that were sent to this  country to be sold (at an average price of somewhere about twenty thousand  pounds apiece, I believe) by the Burmese king before the annexation of his  country. Let but a ruby be of a great size and color, and no equally fine  diamond can approach its value. Well, this great ruby (which was set in a  pendant, by the by), together with a necklace, brooches, bracelets,  ear-rings--indeed, the greater part of Lady Quinton's collection--were  stolen. The robbery was effected at the usual time and in the usual way in  cases of carefully planned jewelry robberies. The time was early  evening--dinner-time, in fact--and an entrance had been made by the window  to Lady Quinton's dressing-room, the door screwed up on the inside, and  wires artfully stretched about the grounds below to overset anybody who  might observe and pursue the thieves.    On an investigation by London detectives, however, a feature of  singularity was brought to light. There had plainly been only one thief at  work at Radcot Hall, and no other had been inside the grounds. Alone he  had planted the wires, opened the window, screwed the door, and picked the  lock of the safe. Clearly this was a thief of the most accomplished  description.    Some few days passed, and, although the police had made various arrests,  they appeared to be all mistakes, and the suspected persons were released  one after another. I was talking of the robbery with"]]]
