[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12351"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 07 (#19)"],[1,"notion of a loose and indefinite election this  important matter is left to accident; every branch, however, has the  same right to be represented as every other. To view the delegates as  representatives has, then, an organic and rational meaning only if they  are not representatives of mere individuals, of the mere multitude, but  of one of the essential spheres of society and of its large interests.  Representation thus no longer means substitution of one person by  another, but it means, rather, that the interest itself is actually  present in the representative.    Of the elections by many separate individuals it may be observed that  there is necessarily an indifference, especially in large States, about  using one's vote, since one vote is of such slight importance; and those  who have the right to vote will not do so, no matter how much one may  extol the privilege of voting. Hence this institution turns into the  opposite of what it stands for. The election becomes the business of a  few, of a single party, of a special interest, which should, in fact, be  neutralized.    Through the publicity of the assembly of classes public opinion first  acquires true thoughts and an insight into the condition and the notion  of the State and its affairs, and thus develops the capacity of judging  more rationally concerning them; it learns, furthermore, to know and  respect the routine, talents, virtues, and skill of the authorities and  officers of the State. While publicity stimulates these talents in  their further development and incites their honorable display, it is  also an antidote for the pride of individuals and of the multitude, and  is one of the greatest opportunities for their education.    It is a widespread popular notion that everybody already knows what is  good for the State, and that it is this common knowledge which finds  expression in the assembly. Here, in the assembly, are developed  virtues, talents, skill, which have to serve as examples. To be sure,  the ministers may find these assemblies onerous, for ministers must  possess large resources of wit and eloquence to resist the attacks which  are hurled against them. Nevertheless, publicity is one of the best  means of instruction in the interests of the State generally, for where  publicity is found the people manifest an entirely different regard for  the State than in those places where there are no assemblies or where  they are not public. Only through the publication of every one of their  proceedings are the chambers related to the larger public opinion; and  it is shown that what one imagines at home with his wife and friends is  one thing, and what happens in a great assembly, where one feat of  eloquence wrecks another, is quite a different thing.      PUBLIC OPINION    Public opinion is the unorganized way in which what a people wants and  thinks is promulgated. That which is actually effective in the State  must be so in an organic fashion. In the constitution this is the case.  But at all times public opinion has been a great power, and it is  particularly so in our time, when the principle of subjective freedom  has such importance and significance. What shall now prevail, prevails  no longer through force, little through use and custom, but rather  through insight and reasons.    Public opinion contains, therefore, the eternal substantial principles  of justice, the true content, and the result of the whole constitution,  legislation, and the universal condition in general. The form  underlying public opinion is sound common sense, which is a fundamental  ethical principle winding its way through everything, in spite of  prepossessions. But when this inner character is formulated in the shape  of general propositions, partly for their own sake, partly for the  purpose of actual reasoning about events, institutions, relations, and  the recognized wants of the State, there appears also the whole  character of accidental opinion, with its ignorance and perversity, its  false knowledge and incorrect judgment.    It is therefore not to be regarded as merely a difference in subjective  opinion when it is asserted on the one hand--    \"Vox populi, vox dei\";    and on the other (in Ariosto, for instance)--[2]      \"Che'l Volgare ignorante ogn' un riprenda      E parli piue di quel che meno intenda.\"    Both sides co-exist in public opinion. Since truth and endless error are  so directly united in it, neither one nor the other side is truly in  earnest. Which one is in earnest, is difficult to decide--difficult,  indeed, if one confines oneself to the direct expression of public  opinion. But as the substantial principle is the inner character of  public opinion, this alone is its truly earnest aspect; yet this insight  cannot be obtained from public opinion itself, for a substantial  principle can only be apprehended apart from public opinion and by a  consideration of its own nature. No matter with what passion an opinion  is invested, no matter with what earnestness a view is asserted,  attacked, and defended, this is no criterion of its real essence. And  least of all could public opinion be made to see that its seriousness is  nothing serious at all.    A great mind has publicly raised the question whether it is permissible  to deceive a people. The answer is that a people will not permit itself  to be deceived concerning its substantial basis, the essence, and the  definite character of its spirit, but it deceives itself about the way  in which it knows this, and according to which it judges of its acts,  events, etc.    Public opinion deserves, therefore, to be esteemed as much as to be  despised; to be despised for its concrete consciousness and expression,  to be esteemed for its essential fundamental principle, which only  shines, more or less dimly, through its concrete expression. Since  public opinion possesses within itself no standard of discrimination, no  capacity to rise to a recognition of the substantial, independence of it  is the first formal condition of any great and rational enterprise (in  actuality as well as in science). Anything great and rational is  eventually sure to please public opinion, to be espoused by it, and to  be made one of its prepossessions.    In public opinion all is false and true, but to discover the truth in it  is the business of the great man. The great man of his time is he who  expresses the will and the meaning of that time, and then brings it to  completion; he acts according to the inner spirit and essence of his  time, which he realizes. And he who does not understand how to despise  public opinion, as it makes itself heard here and there, will never  accomplish anything great.      FREEDOM OF THE PRESS    The freedom of public utterance (of which the press is one means, having  advantage over speech in its more extended reach, though inferior to it  in vivacity), the gratification of that prickling impulse to express and  to have expressed one's opinion, is directly controlled by the police  and State laws and regulations, which partly hinder and partly punish  its excesses. The indirect guarantee lies in its innocuousness, and  this again is mainly based on the rationality of the constitution, the  stability of the government, and also on the publicity given to the  assemblies of the classes. Another security is offered by the  indifference and contempt with which insipid and malicious words are, as  a rule, quickly met.    The definition of the freedom of the press as freedom to say and write  what one pleases, is parallel to the one of freedom in general, viz., as  freedom to do what one pleases. Such views belong to the uneducated  crudity and superficiality of naive thinking. The press, with its  infinite variety of content and expression, represents what is most  transient, particular, and accidental in human opinion. Beyond the  direct incitation to theft, murder, revolt, etc., lies the art of  cultivating the expression which in itself seems general and indefinite  enough, but which, in a measure, conceals a perfectly definite meaning.  Such expressions are partly responsible for consequences of which, since  they are not actually expressed, one is never sure how far they are  contained in the utterances and really follow from them. It is this  indefiniteness of the content and form of the press which prevents the  laws governing it from assuming that precision which one demands of  laws. Thus the extreme subjectivity of the wrong, injury, and crime  committed by the press, causes the decision and sentence to be equally  subjective. The laws are not only indefinite, but the press can, by the  skill and subtlety of its expressions, evade them, or criticise the  judgment of the court as wholly arbitrary. Furthermore, if the utterance  of the press is treated as an offensive deed, one may retort that it is  not a deed at all, but only an opinion, a thought, a mere saying.  Consequently, impunity is expected for opinions and words, because they  are merely subjective, trivial, and insignificant, and, in the same  breath, great respect and esteem is demanded for these opinions and  words--for the opinions, because they are mine and my mental property,  and for the words, because they are the free expression and use of that  property. And yet the basic principle remains that injury to the honor  of individuals generally, abuse, libel, contemptuous caricaturing of the  government, its officers and officials, especially the person of the  prince, defiance of the laws, incitement to revolt, etc., are all  offenses and crimes of different grades.    However, the peculiar and dangerous effect of these acts for the  individuals, the community, and the State depends upon the nature of the  soil on which they are committed, just as a spark, if thrown upon a heap  of gunpowder, has a much more dangerous result than if thrown on the  mere ground, where it vanishes and leaves no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12380"],[0,"Two Thousand Miles on an Automobile (#19)"],[1,"and country is the \"stove  gasoline,\" because it is kept on hand principally for stoves and  torches, and they do not require higher than sixty-eight. In fact,  one is fortunate if the gasoline tests so high as that.    American machines, as a rule, get along very well with the low  grades, but many of the foreign machines require the better  grades. If a machine will not use commercial stove gasoline, the  only safe thing is to carry a supply of higher grade along, and  that is a nuisance.    It is difficult to find a genuine seventy-four even in the cities,  since it is commonly sold only in barrels. If the exhaust of a  gasoline stationary engine is heard anywhere along the road-side,  stop, for there will generally be found a barrel or two of the  high-grade, and a supply may be laid in.    The best plan, however, is to have a carburetor and motor that  will use the ordinary \"stove-grade;\" as a matter of fact, it  contains more carbon and more explosive energy if thoroughly  ignited, but it does not make gas so readily in cold weather and  requires a good hot spark.    All day we rode on through the valley, now far up on the  hill-sides, now down by the meadows; past Palatine Church,  Palatine Bridge; through Fonda and Amsterdam to Schenectady.    It was a glorious ride. The road winds along the side of the  valley, following the graceful curves and swellings of the hills.  The little towns are so lost in the recesses that one comes upon  them quite unexpectedly, and, whirling through their one long main  street, catches glimpses of quaint churches and buildings which  fairly overhang the highway, and narrow vistas of lawns, trees,  shrubbery, and flowers; then all is hidden by the next bend in the  road.    During the long summer afternoon we sped onward through this  beautiful valley. Far down on the tracks below trains would go  scurrying by; now and then a slow freight would challenge our  competition; trainmen would look up curiously; occasionally an  engineer would sound a note of defiance or a blast of victory with  his whistle.    The distant river followed lazily along, winding hither and  thither through the lowland, now skirting the base of the hills,  now bending far to the other side as if resentful of such rude  obstructions to its once impetuous will.    Far across on the distant slopes we could see the cattle grazing,  and farther still tiny specks that were human beings like  ourselves moving upon the landscape. Nature's slightest effort  dwarfs man's mightiest achievements. That great railroad with its  many tracks and rushing trains seemed a child's plaything,--a  noisy, whirring, mechanical toy beside the lazy river; for did not  that placid, murmuring, meandering stream in days gone by hollow  out this valley? did not nature in moments of play rear those  hills and carve out those distant mountains? Compared with these  traces of giant handiwork, what are the works of man? just little  putterings for our own convenience, just little utilizations of  waste energies for our own purposes.    One should view nature with the setting sun. It may gratify a  bustling curiosity to see nature at her toilet, but that is the  part of a \"Peeping Tom.\"    The hour of sunrise is the hour for work, it is the hour when  every living thing feels the impulse to do something. The birds do  not fly to the tree-tops to view the morning sun, the animals do  not rush forth from their lairs to watch the landscape lighten  with the morning's glow; no, all nature is refreshed and eager to  be doing, not seeing; acting, not thinking. Man is no exception to  this all-embracing rule; his innate being protests against  idleness; the most secret cells of his organization are charged to  overflowing with energy and demand relief in work.    Morning is not the hour for contemplation; but when evening comes,  as the sun sinks towards the west, and lengthening shadows make it  seem as if all nature were stretching herself in repose, then do  we love to rest and contemplate the rich loveliness of the earth  and the infinite tenderness of the heavens. Every harsh line,  every glare of light, every crude tone has disappeared. We stroke  nature and she purrs. We sink at our ease in a bed of moss and  nature nestles at our side; we linger beside the silvery brook and  it sings to us; we listen attentively to the murmuring trees and  they whisper to us; we gaze upon the frowning hills and they smile  upon us. And by and by as the shadows deepen all outlines are  lost, and we see vaguely the great masses of tone and color;  nature becomes heroic; the petty is dissolved; the insignificant  is lost; hills and trees and streams are blended in one mighty  composition, in the presence of which all but the impalpable soul  of man is as nothing.    We left Schenectady at nine o'clock, taking the Troy road as far  as Latham's Corners, then to the right into Albany.    We reached the city at half-past ten. Albany is not a convenient  place for automobiles. There are no special stations for the  storing of machines, and the stables are most inaccessible on  account of the hills and steep approaches.          CHAPTER ELEVEN THE VALLEY OF LEBANON  THE SICK TURKEY    It was four o'clock, next day, when we left Albany, going down  Green Street and crossing the long bridge, taking the straight  road over the ridges for Pittsfield.    Immediately on leaving the eastern end of the bridge the ascent of  a long steep grade is begun. This is the first ridge, and from  this on for fifteen miles is a succession of ridges, steep rocky  hills, and precipitous declines. These continue until Brainerd is  reached, where the valley of Lebanon begins.    These ridges can be partially avoided by turning down the Hudson  to the right after crossing the bridge and making a detour to  Brainerd; the road is about five miles longer, but is very  commonly taken by farmers going to the city with heavy loads, and  may well be taken by all who wish to avoid a series of stiff  grades.    Many farmers were amazed to hear we had come over the hills  instead of going around, and wondered how the machine managed to  do it.    Popular notions concerning the capabilities of a machine are  interesting; people estimate its strength and resources by those  of a horse. In speaking of roads, farmers seem to assume the  machine--like the horse--will not mind one or two hills, no matter  how steep, but that it will mind a series of grades, even though  none are very stiff.    Steam and electric automobiles do tire,--that is, long pulls  through heavy roads or up grades tell on them,--the former has  trouble in keeping up steam, the latter rapidly consumes its store  of electricity. The gasoline machine does not tire. Within its  limitations it can keep going indefinitely, and it is immaterial  whether it is up or down grade--save in the time made; it will go  all day through deep mud, or up steep hills, quite as smoothly,  though by no means so fast, as on the level; but let it come to  one hole, spot, or hill that is just beyond the limit of its  power, and it is stuck; it has no reserve force to draw upon. The  steam machine can stop a moment, accumulate two or three hundred  pounds of steam, open the throttle and, for a few moments, exert  twice its normal energy to get out of the difficulty.    It is not a series of hills that deters the gasoline operator, but  the one hill, the one grade, the one bad place, which is just  beyond the power he has available. The road the farmer calls good  may have that one bad place or hill in it, and must therefore be  avoided. The road that is pronounced bad may be, every foot of it,  well within the power of the machine, and is therefore the road to  take.    In actual road work the term \"horse-power\" is very misleading.    When steam-engines in early days began to take the place of  horses, they were rated as so many horse-power according to the  number of horses they displaced. It then became important to find  out what was the power of the horse. Observing the strong dray  horses used by the London breweries, Watt found that a horse could  go two and one-half miles per hour and at the same time raise a  weight of one hundred and fifty pounds suspended by a rope over a  pulley; this is equivalent to thirty-three thousand pounds raised  one foot in one minute, which is said to be one horse-power.    No horse, of course, could raise thirty-three thousand pounds a  foot or any portion of a foot in a minute or an hour, but the  horse can travel at the rate of two and one-half miles an hour  raising a weight of one hundred and fifty pounds, and the horse  can do more; while it cannot move so heavy a weight as  thirty-three thousand pounds, it can in an emergency and by sudden  strain move much more than one hundred and fifty pounds; with good  foothold it can pull more than its own weight along a road, out of a  hole, or up a hill. It could not lift or pull so great a weight very  far; in fact, no farther than the equivalent of approximately  thirty-three thousand pounds raised one foot in one minute; but for  the few seconds necessary a very great amount of energy is at the  command of the driver of the horse. Hence eight horses, or even  four, or two can do things on the road that an eight horse-power  gasoline machine cannot do; for the gasoline machine cannot  concentrate all its power into the exertion of a few moments. If it  is capable of lifting a given load up a given grade at a certain  speed on its lowest gear, it cannot lift twice the load up the same  grade, or the same load up a steeper grade in double the time, for  its resources are exhausted when the limit of the power developed  through the lowest gear is reached. The grade may be only a mud  hole, out of which the rear wheels have to rise only two feet to be  free, but it is as fatal to progress as a hill a mile long.    Of course it is always possible to race the"]]]
