As this place was somewhat out of the direct road, it is necessary to  observe, that I went thither to visit a Slatee, or Gambia trader, of  great note and reputation, named Salim Daucari. He was well known to Dr  Laidley, who had trusted him with effects to the value of five slaves,  and had given me an order for the whole of the debt. We luckily found him  at home, and he received me with great kindness and attention. It is  remarkable, however, that the King of Kasson was, by some means,  immediately apprised of my motions; for I had been at Soolo but a few  hours, before Sambo Sego, his second son, came thither with a party of  horse, to inquire what had prevented me from proceeding to Kooniakary,  and waiting immediately upon the king, who, he said, was impatient to see  me. Salim Daucari made my apology, and promised to accompany me to  Kooniakary the same evening: we accordingly departed from Soolo at  sunset, and in about an hour entered Kooniakary. But as the king had gone  to sleep, we deferred the interview till next morning, and slept at the  hut of Sambo Sego.    My interview with the king, and the incidents which occurred to me in the  kingdoms of Kasson and Kaarta, will be the subject of the ensuing  chapter.          CHAPTER VII.    _The Author admitted to an audience of the King of Kasson, whom he finds  well disposed towards him.--Incidents during the Author's stay at  Kooniakary.--Departs thence for Kemmoo, the capital of Kaarta.--Is  received with great kindness by the King of Kaarta, who dissuades him  from prosecuting his journey, on account of approaching hostilities with  the King of Bambarra.--The Author determines, notwithstanding, to  proceed: and the usual route being obstructed, takes the path to Ludamar,  a Moorish kingdom.--Is accommodated by the king with a guide to Jarra,  the frontier town of the Moorish territories; and sets out for that  place, accompanied by three of the king's sons, and 200 horsemen._      About eight o'clock in the morning of January 15, 1796, we went to an  audience of the king, (Demba Sego Jalla,) but the crowd of people to see  me was so great, that I could scarcely get admittance. A passage being at  length obtained, I made my bow to the monarch, whom we found sitting upon  a mat, in a large hut: he appeared to be a man of about sixty years of  age. His success in war, and the mildness of his behaviour in time of  peace, had much endeared him to all his subjects. He surveyed me with  great attention; and when Salim Daucari explained to him the object of my  journey, and my reasons for passing through his country, the good old  king appeared not only perfectly satisfied, but promised me every  assistance in his power. He informed me that he had seen Major Houghton,  and presented him with a white horse; but that, after crossing the  kingdom of Kaarta, he had lost his life among the Moors; in what manner  he could not inform me. When this audience was ended we returned to our  lodging, and I made up a small present for the king, out of the few  effects that were left me; for I had not yet received anything from Salim  Daucari. This present, though inconsiderable in itself, was well received  by the king, who sent me in return a large white bullock. The sight of  this animal quite delighted my attendants; not so much on account of its  bulk, as from its being of a white colour, which is considered as a  particular mark of favour. But although the king himself was well  disposed towards me, and readily granted me permission to pass through  his territories, I soon discovered that very great and unexpected  obstacles were likely to impede my progress. Besides the war which was on  the point of breaking out between Kasson and Kajaaga, I was told that the  next kingdom of Kaarta, through which my route lay, was involved in the  issue; and was furthermore threatened with hostilities on the part of  Bambarra. The king himself informed me of these circumstances, and  advised me to stay in the neighbourhood of Kooniakary, till such time as  he could procure proper information respecting Bambarra, which he  expected to do in the course of four or five days, as he had already, he  said, sent four messengers into Kaarta for that purpose. I readily  submitted to this proposal, and went to Soolo, to stay there till the  return of one of those messengers. This afforded me a favourable  opportunity of receiving what money Salim Daucari could spare me on Dr  Laidley's account. I succeeded in receiving the value of three slaves,  chiefly in gold dust; and being anxious to proceed as quickly as  possible, I begged Daucari to use his interest with the king to allow me  a guide by the way of Fooladoo, as I was informed that the war had  already commenced between the Kings of Bambarra and Kaarta. Daucari  accordingly set out for Kooniakary on the morning of the 20th, and the  same evening returned with the king's answer, which was to this purpose,  that the king had many years ago made an agreement with Daisy, King of  Kaarta, to send all merchants and travellers through his dominions; but  that if I wished to take the route through Fooladoo, I had his permission  so to do; though he could not, consistently with his agreement, lend me a  guide. Having felt the want of regal protection in a former part of my  journey, I was unwilling to hazard a repetition of the hardships I had  then experienced, especially as the money I had received was probably the  last supply that I should obtain; I therefore determined to wait for the  return of the messengers from Kaarta.    In the interim, it began to be whispered abroad, that I had received  plenty of gold from Salim Daucari; and on the morning of the 23d, Sambo  Sego paid me a visit with a party of horsemen. He insisted upon knowing  the exact amount of the money I had obtained; declaring, that whatever  the sum was, one half of it must go to the king; besides which, he  intimated that he expected a handsome present for himself, as being the  king's sons and for his attendants, as being the king's relations. The  reader will easily perceive, that if all these demands had been  satisfied, I should not have been overburdened with money; but though it  was very mortifying to me to comply with the demands of injustice, and so  arbitrary an exaction, yet, thinking it was highly dangerous to make a  foolish resistance, and irritate the lion when within the reach of his  paw, I prepared to submit; and if Salim Daucari had not interposed, all  my endeavours to mitigate this oppressive claim would have been of no  avail, Salim at last prevailed upon Sambo to accept sixteen bars of  European merchandize, and some powder and ball, as a complete payment of  every demand that could be made upon me in the kingdom of Kasson.    January 26th. In the forenoon, I went to the top of a high hill to the  southward of Soolo, where I had a most enchanting prospect of the  country. The number of towns and villages, and the extensive cultivation  around them, surpassed every thing I had yet seen in Africa. A gross  calculation may be formed of the number of inhabitants in this delightful  plain, by considering, that the King of Kasson can raise four thousand  fighting men by the sound of his war-drum. In traversing the rocky  eminences of this hill, which are almost destitute of vegetation, I  observed a number of large holes in the crevices and fissures of the  rocks, where the wolves and hyaenas take refuge during the day. Some of  these animals paid us a visit on the evening of the 27th: their approach  was discovered by the dogs of the village; and on this occasion it is  remarkable, that the dogs did not bark, but howl in the most dismal  manner. The inhabitants of the village no sooner heard them than, knowing  the cause, they armed themselves; and providing bunches of dry grass,  went in a body to the inclosure in the middle of the village where the  cattle were kept. Here they lighted the bunches of grass, and, waving  them to and fro, ran hooping and hallooing towards the hills. This  manoeuvre had the desired effect of frightening the wolves away from the  village; but, on examination, we found that they had killed five of the  cattle, and torn and wounded many others.    February 1st. The messengers arrived from Kaarta, and brought  intelligence that the war had not yet commenced between Bambarra and  Kaarta, and that I might probably pass through Kaarta before the Bambarra  army invaded that country.    Feb. 3d. Early in the morning, two guides on horseback came from  Kooniakary to conduct me to the frontiers of Kaarta. I accordingly took  leave of Salim Daucari, and parted for the last time from my  fellow-traveller the blacksmith, whose kind solicitude for my welfare had  been so conspicuous; and about ten o'clock departed from Soolo. We  travelled this day through a rocky and hilly country, along the banks of  the river Krieko, and at sunset came to the village of Soomo, where we  slept.    Feb. 4th. We departed from Soomo, and continued our route along the banks  of the Krieko, which are everywhere well cultivated, and swarm with  inhabitants. At this time they were increased by the number of people  that had flown thither from Kaarta, on account of the Bambarra war. In  the afternoon we reached Kimo, a large village, the residence of Madi  Konko, governor of the hilly country of Kasson, which is called Sorroma,  From hence the guides appointed by the King of Kasson returned, to join  in the expedition against Kajaaga; and I waited until the 6th, before I  could prevail on Madi Konko to appoint me a guide to Kaarta.    Feb. 7th. Departing from Kimo, with Madi Konko's son as a guide, we  continued our course along the banks of the Krieko until the afternoon,  when we arrived at Kangee, a considerable town."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8565"],[0,"A Book of German Lyrics (#18)"],[1,"of the  midnight sky, but the waters continue to sing, even in their sleep, of  the day that has just passed. This contest the poet has also portrayed  rhythmically: compare the measured trochaic movement of the first half of  each stanza with the lighter and more rapid dactylic movement of the  second half.        5. KECKER, since the noises of the day no longer interfere with their      song.        12. In apposition with _des Himmels Bläue_. The firmament is the yoke      along which the fleeting hours glide; GLEICHGESCHWUNGEN, _equally      arched_, i.e., perfectly circular.      80.--3. SCHLEIER, of mist.        5. HERBSTKRÄFTIG, full of autumnal vigor; GEDÄMPFT, because the mists      and the haze have softened all sharpness of outline and color.      81.--1. BLAUES BAND, metaphorical for blue sky.        7. HARFENTON, the symphony of spring, the heard and unheard stirring      of new life.      82. The stanza form is an adaptation of a famous Lutheran hymn: _Wie  schön leuchtet der Morgenstern_.      83. Of the character of the _Feuerreiter_, a creation of Mörike, only  this much is clear: he fights fire and has often used sinfully  (_freventlich_) holy means (_des heil'gen Kreuzes Span_) to charm fire.  Finally, however, he becomes a victim of the infernal powers.        21. DER ROTE HAHN, the symbol of fire.        26. FEIND, Satan.        40. As the refrain in the preceding stanzas has depicted the tolling      of the bell, so the sudden break here depicts the ceasing.        42. MÜßEN, old weak dative.      84. In its beautiful simplicity this song has become a folksong, Since it  presents many metrical irregularities, the following scansion may be  found useful. A dot is used to indicate pitch accent.[*]    [* Transcriber's note: Here represented by 'Y'.]        X -- X -- X --    -- XX -- X --      XX -- XX -- X     -- XX -- X      Y -- X -- X --    X -- X -- X --      X -- X -- X       X -- X -- X      Y -- X -- X --    -- XX -- X --      X -- XX -- X      -- XX -- X      X -- X -- --      X -- X -- X --      X -- X -- X       X -- X -- X    86. Mörike found the name _Rohtraut_ by chance in an old German lexicon.  The full vowel coloring appealed to him and called forth this ballad.        5. TUT etc., dialectic periphrastic conjugation = _fischt und jagt_.        19. WUNNIGLICH (_wonniglich_). 22. VERGUNNT (_vergönnt_)--these      archaic forms are in keeping with the tone of the ballad and the      patriarchal life at King Ringang's court.      87. Appropriately written in the stately Greek trimeter (iambic verse of  six feet). Compare with this poem the closing lines of Keats' _Ode to a  Grecian Urn_:      Beauty is truth, truth beauty, that is all    Ye know on earth and all ye need to know.      _Was aber schön ist, selig scheint es in ihm selbst._    _But beauty seems a thing all blessed within itself._        6. SCHLINGT DEN RINGELREIHN, circle about in a round dance.        10. IHM, old reflexive instead of _sich_.      88. The confession of Mörike's ideal.        1. WILLT = _willst_.        2. _A thing of joy or a thing of sorrow._        5-7. WOLLEST NICHT ÜBERSCHÜTTEN, _pray do not overwhelm with a flood      of_.      89. Lines of three and of two accents alternate, so that the poem is  really written in blank verse; its character is, however, entirely  changed, since the last word of each line stands out because of the  necessary rhythmical pause. Notice the change in the last two lines.          HEBBEL    Friedrich Hebbel, Germany's greatest master of tragedy since the days of  Schiller, was born March 18, 1813, in the little village of Wesselburen  in Holstein. Thus his first impression of nature was the infinite expanse  of the North Sea Plain. Bitterest poverty was his lot from childhood;  poverty and loneliness put their harsh imprint on his youth and early  manhood. Haunted by hunger, he battled for years to gain a mere living,  often on the brink of despair. His only help was a small stipend from the  king of Denmark, which enabled him to spend two years in Paris and Rome,  and the meager pennies that his devoted friend Elise Lensing, a poor  seamstress in Hamburg, sent him. His short stories, his dramas, although  they brought him fame, were of little avail in this struggle that seemed  all too hopeless. Then a sudden change for the better came. Stopping at  Vienna on his return from Rome, he found himself in a small circle of  ardent admirers. He met Christine Enghaus, at that time Germany's  greatest tragic actress, who became the most congenial interpreter of  Hebbel's heroines. The attraction was mutual and on May 26, 1846,  Friedrich Hebbel and Christine Enghaus were married. Now followed years  of calm maturity, the greatest period of Hebbel's dramatic production.  Hebbel died in Vienna December 13, 1863. His lyric poetry, for the most  part the product of his earlier years, is marked above all by a tendency  towards symbolism, these symbols usually of a rich sensuous beauty and  often of a rare delicacy. A homely realism is, however, by no means  lacking. The musical quality of his verse attracted the genius of Robert  Schumann, who set the _Nachtlied_ to music.      90. In the spring of 1836 Hebbel went to Heidelberg. A child of the North  Sea Plain, he came in contact here with a richer, softer beauty of a more  Southern landscape, a beauty which seemed to set free his latent powers.  A night in the month of May on the wooded summits near Heidelberg called  forth this song. The giant magnitude of the starry heavens awakened in  the poet to an overpowering degree the feeling of the greatness of cosmic  life; he feels the insignificance of his own individual existence, he  feels as if it were in danger of being extinguished by the vastness of  the great All; but then sleep comes as a kindly nurse and draws her  protecting circle about the meager flame of individual existence. Notice  the internal rhymes in the first and second stanzas that picture cosmic  life and its reflection in the individual, and the utterly different  effect of the third stanza, that returns to the narrower sphere of  individual life.      91.--3. SPIELT HEREIN, _comes playing into the room_.        6. GEFÄLLT IHM GAR ZU SEHR, _it likes all too well_.      92.--10. It was customary for the neighbors to perform the last kindly  offices for the dead.        16. WAS, _which_.      93.--1. DIE DU, _thou who_.        95.--6 ff. WIR STERBEN: because in this union, when even the last barrier  separating the \"I\" from the \"Thou\" has fallen, the aim of life has been  reached in utter harmony which overcomes the limitations of individual  existence. Thus these two souls may return into the All, as expressed in  the beautiful symbol of the last stanza.        11. ZERFLIEßEN IN EINS, _coalesce_.      97. Compare Keats' _Ode to Autumn_.      98. Addressed to Christine Hebbel, the poet's wife.        3, 4. IN FLAMMEN STEHEN, _to be aflame_. This passage could be      rendered, _that stands as if aflame with morning light at the      farthermost horizon_.        10. LÄßT = _verläßt_.          KELLER    Gottfried Keller, best known as the master of the _Novelle_, was born in  Zürich, July 19, 1819, as the son of a master turner. A love for the  concrete world of reality induced him to take up painting. Keller was not  without talent in this line, but achieving no signal success, he gave up  painting for letters. To secure for himself a stable footing in the civic  world, Keller, after a number of years spent in Germany, in 1861 assumed  the office of a municipal secretary of his native city, where he died  July 15, 1890. Early in life, Keller threw aside all conventional  beliefs, and his religion henceforth was a deep love of and a joyous  faith in all life. Although Keller was in many respects decidedly  matter-of-fact, a calm objective observer with a strong leaning toward  utilitarian ideals--he had all the homely virtues of his ancestry--he  nevertheless delighted in a myth-creating fancy. Thus Keller is very much  akin to his countryman Arnold Böcklin, whom the German world honors as  its greatest modern painter.      99. One of the finest expressions extant of love for one's native land.  The various national anthems pale before its beauty.        3. OB = _obgleich_.        9. HELVETIA, _Switzerland_.        13. GUT UND HAB (usually _Hab und Gut_), _possessions_; render, _all      that I have_.        15. OB, compare 3.      100. The grief and woe of Nature held by the fetters of winter  personified by this nymph climbing the \"_Seebaum_,\" whose branches are  held by the ice. A mythical creation such as Böcklin delighted in.        12. GLIED UM GLIED, _limb upon limb_, i.e., _each separate limb_.        14. HER UND HIN, _forth and back_.        16. The very sound of this line is a cry of pity.      101. Written 1879. Theodor Storm called it the best lyric poem since  Goethe. Compare C. F. Meyer's letter to Keller congratulating him on his  seventieth birthday. Meyer praises Keller's poetry because of its  \"_innere Heiterkeit_,\" and continues: \"_Auch meine ich, daß Ihr fester  Glaube an die Güte des Daseins die höchste Bedeutung Ihrer Schriften ist.  Ihnen ist wahrhaftig nichts zu wünschen als die Beharrung in Ihrem Wesen.  Weil Sie die Erde lieben, wird die Erde Sie auch so lange als möglich  festhalten._\"          STORM    Theodor Storm, like Friedrich Hebbel, is a child of the North Sea Plain;  but while in Hebbel's verse there is hardly any direct reference to his  native landscape, Storm again and again sings its chaste beauty; and  while Hebbel could find a home away from his native heath, Storm clung to  it with a jealous love. He was born in Husum (_die graue Stadt am grauen  Meer_) on the west coast of Schleswig-Holstein, September 14, 1817, of  well-to-do parents. While still a student of law, he published a first  volume of verse together with Tycho and Theodor Mommsen. His favorite  poets were "]]]
