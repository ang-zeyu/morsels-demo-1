It is interesting to observe that Miller's original purpose had been to  secure money to speculate with--for he had been bitten deep by the  tarantula of Wall Street, and his early experiences had led him to  believe that he could beat the market if only he had sufficient margin.  This margin he set out to secure. Then when he saw how easy it was to  get money for the asking, he dropped the idea of speculation and simply  became a banker. He did make one bona-fide attempt, but the stock went  down, he sold out and netted a small loss. Had Miller actually  _continued to speculate_ it is doubtful whether he could have been  convicted for any crime, since it was for that purpose that the money  was entrusted to him. He might have lost it all in the Street and gone  scot free. As it was, in failing to gamble with it, he became guilty of  embezzlement.    Ammon arrived in Sing Sing with a degree of eclat. He found numerous old  friends and clients among the inmates. He brought a social position  which had its value. Money, too, is no less desirable there than  elsewhere, and Ammon had plenty of it.    In due course, but not until he had served more than half his sentence  (less commutation), Miller a broken man, received his pardon, and went  back to his wife and child. When Governor Higgins performed this act of  executive clemency, many honest folk in Brooklyn and elsewhere loudly  expressed their indignation. District Attorney Jerome did not escape  their blame. Was this contemptible thief, this meanest of all mean  swindlers, who had stolen hundreds of thousands to be turned loose on  the community before he had served half his sentence? It was an outrage!  A disgrace to civilization! Reader, how say you?          VI    A Study in Finance      \"He that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.\"    --PROVERBS 28:20.    The victim of moral overstrain is the central figure in many novels and  countless magazine stories. In most of them he finally repents him fully  of his sins past and returns to his former or to some equally desirable  position, to lead a new and better life. The dangers and temptations of  the \"Street\" are, however, too real and terrible to be studied other  than in actuality, and the fall of hundreds of previously honest young  men owing to easily remedied conditions should teach its lesson, not  only to their comrades, but to their employers as well. The ball and  chain, quite as often as repentance and forgiveness, ends their  experience.    No young man takes a position in a banking-house with the deliberate  intention of becoming an embezzler. He knows precisely, as well as does  the reader, that if he listens to the whisper of temptation he is  lost--and so does his employer. Yet the employer, who would hold himself  remiss if he allowed his little boy to have the run of the jam-closet  and then discovered that the latter's lips bore evidence of petty  larceny, or would regard himself as almost criminally negligent if he  placed a priceless pearl necklace where an ignorant chimney-sweep might  fall under the hypnotism of its shimmer, will calmly allow a condition  of things in his own brokerage or banking office where a  fifteen-dollars-a-week clerk may have free access to a million dollars'  worth of negotiable securities, and even encourage the latter by  occasional \"sure\" tips to take a flyer in the market.    It is a deplorable fact that the officers of certain companies  occasionally \"unload\" undesirable securities upon their employees, and,  in order to boom or create a \"movement\" in a certain stock, will induce  the persons under their control to purchase it. It would be a rare case  in which a clerk who valued his situation would refuse to take a few  shares in an enterprise which the head of the firm was fathering. Of  course, such occurrences are the exceptions, but there are plenty of  houses not far from Wall Street where the partners know that their  clerks and messengers are \"playing the market,\" and exert not the  slightest influence to stop them. When these men find that they and  their customers, and not the clerks and messengers, are paying the loss  accounts of the latter, they are very much distressed, and tell the  District Attorney, with regret, that only by sending such wicked and  treacherous persons to State's prison can similar dishonesty be  prevented.    Not long ago the writer became acquainted with a young man who, as loan  clerk in a trust company, had misappropriated a large amount of  securities and had pleaded guilty to the crime of grand larceny in the  first degree. He was awaiting sentence, and in connection therewith it  became necessary to examine into the conditions prevailing generally in  the financial district. His story is already public property, for the  case attracted wide attention in the daily press; but, inasmuch as the  writer's object is to point a moral rather than adorn a tale, the  culprit's name and the name of the company with which he was connected  need not be given.    He is now serving a term in State's prison and is, the writer believes,  sincerely repentant and determined to make a man of himself upon his  release. For present purposes let him be called John Smith. He was born  in New York City, in surroundings rather better than the average. His  family were persons of good education and his home was a comfortable and  happy one. From childhood he received thorough religious instruction  and was always a straightforward, honest and obedient boy. His father,  having concluded from observation that the shortest route to success lay  in financial enterprise, secured a place in a broker's office for his  son after the latter's graduation from the high school. John began at  the bottom and gradually worked up to the position of assistant loan  clerk in a big trust company. This took fifteen years of hard work.    From the day that he started in filling inkwells and cleaning out ticker  baskets, he saw fortunes made and lost in a twinkling. He learned that  the chief business of a broker is acting as go-between for persons who  are trying to sell what they do not own to others who have not the money  to pay for what they buy. And he saw hundreds of such persons grow rich  on these fictitious transactions. He also saw others \"wiped out,\" but  they cheerfully went through bankruptcy and began again, many of them  achieving wealth on their second or third attempt. He was earning five  dollars a week and getting his lunch at a \"vegetarian health restaurant\"  for fifteen cents. The broker, for whom he ran errands, gave away  thirty-five-cent cigars to his customers and had an elaborate luncheon  served in the office daily to a dozen or more of the elect. John knew  one boy of about his own age, who, having made a successful turn, began  as a trader and cleaned up a hundred thousand dollars in a rising market  the first year. That was better than the cleaning up John was used to.  But he was a sensible boy and had made up his mind to succeed in a  legitimate fashion. Gradually he saved a few hundred dollars and, acting  on the knowledge he had gained in his business, bought two or three  shares in a security which quickly advanced in value and almost doubled  his money. The next time as well fortune favored him, and he soon had a  comfortable nest-egg--enough to warrant his feeling reasonably secure in  the event of accident or sickness.    He had worked faithfully, had given great satisfaction to his employers,  and presently had a clerical position in a prominent trust company  offered to him. It seemed an advance. The salary was larger, even if  absurdly small, and he gladly accepted the place.    Shortly after this he had his first experience in real finance. The  president of the company sent for him--the reader will remember that  this is a true story--and the boy entered his private office and came  into the august presence of the magnate. This man is to-day what is  commonly known as a \"power\" in Wall Street.    \"My boy,\" said the president, \"you have been doing very well. I have  noticed the excellence of your work. I want to commend you.\"    \"Thank you, sir,\" said John modestly, expecting to hear that his salary  was to be raised.    \"Yes,\" continued the great man. \"And I want you to have an interest in  the business.\"    The blood rushed to John's head and face. \"Thank you very much,\" he  gasped.    \"I have allotted you five shares in the trust company,\" said the  president. \"If you take them up and carry them you will feel that you  have a real connection with the house and it will net you a handsome  return. Have you any money?\"    It so happened that at this time John's savings were invested in a few  bonds of an old and conservatively managed railroad. His heart fell. He  didn't want to buy any bank stock.    \"No,\" he answered. \"My salary is small enough and I need it all. I don't  save any money.\"    \"Oh, well,\" said the magnate, \"I will try and fix it up for you. I will  arrange for a loan with the ---- Bank on the stock. Remember, I'm doing  this to help you. That is all. You may go back to your books.\"    Next day John was informed that he had bought five shares of ---- Trust  Company stock in the neighborhood of three hundred, and he signed a note  for one thousand four hundred and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1319"],[0,"Increasing Human Efficiency in Business (#19)"],[1,"he is not likely to impute evil  motives to the actions of others. As has been  <p 176>  well said by Dickens, when speaking from the  viewpoint of the defendant, ``A good, contented,  well-breakfasted juryman is a capital  thing to get hold of. Discontented or hungry  jurymen always find for the plaintiff.''    The salesman with a pleasing personality  is able to sell more goods than others less  happily endowed. Some salesmen try to supplement  this power--or supply the lack of a  pleasing personality--by ``jollying'' the possible  customer in various ways. Dinners,  theaters, cigars, and various other devices  are thus used, and in many instances with success.    Modern business employs such methods less  and less, chiefly because the customer recognizes  the purpose of the attempt, and either  refuses to accept the ``hospitality'' or is on  his guard to resist the effect. A pleasing  personality, however, inspires confidence, tends  to put the customer in a good humor and optimistic  mood, and results in sales.    A cold, formal manner, ill temper, or a  pessimistic outlook, on the contrary, will  <p 177>  handicap the sale of the best merchandise  made.    A man is said to be suggestible when he  comes to conclusions or acts without due  deliberation. Suggestion, then, is nothing but  the mental condition which causes us to believe  and respond without the normal amount  of weighing of evidence. While in a suggestible  condition we are credulous, responsive,  and impulsive. Such a mental condition is  favored and induced by pleasure. Discomfort  or dissatisfaction with the conditions or  surroundings prompts the opposing attitude;  we become suspicious and slow to act or believe.  While in a suggestible condition, we  place our orders freely and promptly. The  merchant who can please his customers and  bring them to a suggestible mood before he  displays his wares, therefore, has done much to  secure generous sales.    Advantageous results from suggestion are  not limited to the relationship between buyer  and seller.    _The pleased and satisfied employee is open_  <p 178>  _to the suggestions of foreman and manager and  responds with an enthusiasm impossible of  generation in one dissatisfied from any cause_.    Methods of insuring this pleasure in work  for employees are yet in the formative stage.  Until recently the want of such methods, indeed,  was not felt. The slave driver with the  most profane vocabulary and the greatest  recklessness in the use of fist and foot was  supposed to be the most effective type of boss.  The task system set an irreducible minimum  for the day's work; the employer exacted the  task and assumed that no better way of handling  men could be devised. Piecework rates  provided a better and more reasonable basis  for securing something like a maximum day's  work; bonus and premium systems have carried  the incentive of the wage in increasing efficiency  to the last point short of co<o:>perative  organization. But all of these systems fall  short in assuming that men are machines;  that their powers and capacities are fixed quantities;  that the efficiency of a well-disposed and  industrious employee ought to be proof against  <p 179>  varying conditions or environment; that a  man can achieve the desired standard, if only  he has the will to achieve it.    _Discipline has become less brutal if not less  strict. The laborer works, not alone to avoid  poverty and hunger, but to secure the means of  pleasure_.    It is not so long since harsh discipline was  common both in homes and in business. The  boy worked hard because he was afraid not to.  The man labored because poverty threatened  him if idle. We were in what might be called  a ``pain economy''; we worked to escape pain.  To-day this has largely been changed.    Employers, too, are experimenting boldly  with the idea of creating pleasure in work.  The first step has been taken in the very  general elimination of the old wasteful, neglectful  elements of factory and office environment.  Comfort, the first neutral element  of pleasure, is provided for employees just as  solid foundations are provided for the factory  buildings. There is light, heat, and ventilation  where a generation ago there were tiny windows,  <p 180>  shadows, lonely stoves, and foul air. Cleanliness  is provided and preserved; not a few of  the larger industries employ a regular corps of  janitors to keep floors, walls, and windows clean.  The walls are tinted; the lights are arranged  so as to provide the right illumination without  straining the workers' eyes. The departments  are symmetrically arranged; the aisles are  wide; the working space is ample; there is  no fear to haunt machine tenders that a mis-  step or a moment of forgetfulness will entangle  them in a neighboring machine. The factory  buildings themselves, without being pretentious,  have pleasing, simple lines and unobtrusive  ornamentation. They look like, and  are, when the human equation does not interfere,  _*pleasant_ places to work in.    This is the typical modern factory; thousands  can be found in America. On this  foundation of good working conditions and  pleasant environment, many companies have  built more or less elaborate systems of welfare  work, whose effectiveness in creating  pleasure and efficiency seem to depend on the  <p 181>  purpose and spirit of the men behind them.  These systems frequently begin with beautification  of the factory premises and workrooms  --window boxes, factory lawns, ivied walls,  trees, and shrubs--and advance by various  stages to lunch rooms for workers, factory  libraries, rest rooms for women workers, factory  nurses and physicians, and sometimes the  development of a social life among employees  through picnics, lectures, dances, night schools,  and like activities. The methods employed  are too diverse and too recent to permit an accurate  estimate of their work or a true analysis  of the elements of their success. It is incumbent  on the employer to find or work out for  himself the method best suited to his individual  needs.    _To understand how pleasure heightens the  suggestibility of the individual it is but necessary  to consider the well-known effects which pleasure  has on the various bodily and mental processes_.    The action of pleasure and displeasure upon  the muscles of the body is most apparent.  With displeasure the muscles of the forehead  <p 182>  contract; folds and wrinkles appear. The  corners of the mouth are drawn down; the  head bowed; the shoulders stoop and draw  together over the breast; the chest is contracted;  the fingers of the hand close, and there  is also a tendency to bend the arms so as to  protect the fore part of the body. In displeasure  the body is thus seen to contract and  to put itself on the defensive. It closes itself  to outside influences and attempts to ``withdraw  within its shell.''    With pleasure the forehead is smoothed  out; the corners of the mouth are lifted; the  head is held erect; the shoulders are thrown  back; the chest is expanded; the fingers of  the hand are opened, and the arm is ready to  go out to grasp any object. The whole body  is thrown into a receptive attitude. It is prepared  to be affected by outside stimulations  and is ready to profit by them.    That these characteristic bodily attitudes  of pleasure and displeasure have an effect  on the mind is evident. Bodily and mental attitudes  have developed together in the history  <p 183>  of the race. The conditions which cause a  receptive attitude of body cause also a suggestible  state of mind. The conditions which  call for bodily protection also demand a suspicious  and non-responsive attitude of mind.  The bodily and the mental attitudes have become  so intimately associated that the presence  of one assures the presence of the other.    _Pleasure and a particular attitude of body are  indissolubly united, and when these two are  present, a suggestible condition of mind seems of  necessity to follow_.    Thus by the subtle working of pleasant  impressions the customer is disarmed of his  suspicion and made ready to respond to the  suggestions of the merchant.    The effect of the suggestible attitude of the  body, as produced by pleasure, is increased  by certain other effects which pleasure produces  on the body.    Muscular strength is frequently measured  by finding the maximum grip on a recording  instrument. The amount of the grip varies  from time to time and is affected by various  <p 184>  conditions. One of the phenomena which has  been thoroughly investigated is the effect of  pleasure and of pain on the intensity of the  grip. It is well established that pleasure  increases the grip or the available amount of  energy. Displeasure reduces the strength.    The total volume of the body would seem  to be constant for any particular short interval  of time. Such, however, is not the case.    _With pleasure the lungs are filled with air  from deepened breathing; the volume of the  limbs is increased by the increased flow of blood.  Pleasure thus actually makes us larger and displeasure  smaller_.    This increase in muscular strength and bodily  volume due to pleasure has a very decided  effect upon the mind. The increase of muscular  strength gives us a feeling of power and  assurance, the increase in volume gives us a  feeling of expansion and importance. These  conditions produced by increase of muscular  strength and bodily volume contribute to the  general suggestible condition described above.    If I am in a suggestible condition and if I  <p 185>  also feel an unusual degree of assurance in my  own powers and importance, I shall have such  confidence in the wisdom of my intended acts  that there will seem to be no ground for delay.  Furthermore the increased action of the heart,  due to the effect of pleasure, gives me a feeling  of buoyancy and invigoration which adds appreciably"]]]
