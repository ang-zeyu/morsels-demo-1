The King agreed to go  to Berebee, and assist in the grand palaver to be held there; complying  with a proposal of the Commodore, to take passage thither in the  Macedonian. Matters being so far settled, the council was broken up, and  the party re-embarked.    Several of the boats having been anchored outside of the surf, the  officers and men were carried off to them in the native canoes. The scene  on the beach was quite animated. Hundreds of natives, having laid aside  their weapons, crowded around to watch the proceedings. The women and  children came from the woods in swarms, all talking, screaming, laughing,  and running hither and thither. The canoes were constantly passing from  the shore to the boats, carrying two persons at a time. Our men, being  unaccustomed to such rough water and unsteady conveyances, often capsized  the canoes and were tumbled ashore by the surf, perhaps with the loss of  hats, jackets, or weapons. Here was visible the head of a marine, swimming  to one of the boats, with his musket in his hand. Another, unable to swim,  was upheld by a Krooman. Here and there, an impatient individual plunged  into the surf and struck out for his boat, rather than await the tedious  process of embarkation. All reached the vessels in safety, but few with  dry jackets. His majesty of Rock Boukir, too, went on board the frigate,  according to agreement, and probably, by this mark of confidence, saved  his capital from the flames. If all stories be true, he little deserves  our clemency; and it is even said, that the different tribes held a grand  palaver at this place, for the division of the spoil of the Mary Carver.    We set sail immediately.    12.--Anchored at half past five P.M., off Little Berebee.          CHAPTER X.    Palaver at Little Berebee--Death of the Interpreter and King Ben Cracko,  and burning of the Town--Battle with the Natives, and Conflagration of  several Towns--Turkey Buzzards--A Love-Letter--Moral Reflections--Treaty  of Grand Berebee--Prince Jumbo and his Father--Native system of  Expresses--Curiosity of the Natives.      _December_ 13.--At nine A.M., the boats of the squadron repaired to the  flag-ship, where they were formed in line, and then pulled towards the  shore abreast. The landing-place is tolerably good, but contracted. Four  or five boats might easily approach it together; but when most of the  thirteen attempted it at once, so narrow was the space, that one or two of  them filled. They were hauled up, however, and secured. Our force, on  being disembarked, was stationed in line, opposite the town of Little  Berebee, and the wood in its immediate vicinity. Many of the officers went  up to the Palaver House, a temporary shed erected for the occasion, about  fifty yards from the town-gate. King Ben Cracko now making his appearance,  with five or six headmen or kings of the neighboring tribes, the palaver  began.    The interpreter, on this occasion, was well known to have been, in his own  person, a leading character in the act of piracy and murder, which it was  the object of the palaver to investigate. He had therefore a difficult  part to act; one that required great nerve, and such a talent of throwing  a fair semblance over foul facts, as few men, civilized or savage, are  likely to possess. With the consciousness of guilt upon him, causing him  to startle at the first aspect of peril, it is singular that the man  should have had the temerity to trust himself in so trying a position. His  version of the Mary Carver affair was a very wretched piece of fiction. He  declared that Captain Farwell had killed two natives, and that old King  Cracko, since deceased, had punished the captain by death, in the exercise  of his legitimate authority. He denied that the tribe had participated in  Captain Farwell's murder, or in those of the mate and crew, or in the  robbery of the vessel; affirming that the schooner had gone ashore, and  that everything was lost. All this was a tissue of falsehood; it being  notorious that a large quantity of goods from the wreck, and portions of  the vessel itself, were distributed among the towns along the coast. It  was well known, moreover, that these people had boasted of having \"caught\"  (to use their own phrase), an American vessel, and that the neighboring  tribes had threatened to follow Ben Cracko's example.    Governor Roberts, who conducted the examination on our part, expressed to  the man his utter disbelief of the above statements. The Commodore,  likewise, stept hastily towards him, sternly warning him to utter no more  falsehoods. The interpreter, perceiving that the impression was against  him, and probably expecting to be instantly made prisoner, or put to  death, now lost the audacity that had hitherto sustained him. At this  moment, it is said, a gun was fired at our party, from the town; and,  simultaneously with the report, the interpreter sprang away like a deer.  There was a cry to stop him--two or three musket-bullets whistled after  the fugitive as he ran--but he had nearly reached the town-gate, when his  limbs, while strained to their utmost energy, suddenly failed beneath him.  A rifle-shot had struck him in the vertebra of the neck, causing  instantaneous death. Meanwhile, King Ben Cracko had made a bolt to escape,  but was seized by his long calico robe; which, however, gave way, leaving  him literally naked in the midst of his enemies. A shot brought him to the  ground; but he sprang to his feet, still struggling to escape. He next  received two bayonet wounds, but fought like a wild beast, until two or  three men flung themselves upon him, and held him down by main force.  Finding himself overpowered, he pretended to be dead, but was securely  bound, and taken to the beach. A lion of the African deserts could not  have shown a fiercer energy than this savage King; and those who gazed at  him, as he lay motionless on the sand, confessed that they had never seen  a frame of such masculine vigor as was here displayed. His wounds proved  mortal.    The melee had been as sudden as the explosion of gunpowder; it was wholly  unexpected, but perhaps not to be wondered at, where two parties, with  weapons in their hands, had met to discuss a question of robbery and  murder. When the firing commenced, about two hundred natives were on the  spot, or in the vicinity; they were now flying in all directions, some  along the beach, a few into the sea itself, but by far the greatest number  to the woods. Many shots were fired, notwithstanding the Commodore's  orders to refrain. We were now directed to break down the palisades, and  set fire to the town. A breach of twenty or thirty feet was soon made in  the wall, by severing the withes that bound together the upright planks.  Before this could be effected, another party crept through the small  holes, serving the purpose of gates, and penetrated to the centre of the  town, where, assembling around the great council-tree, they gave three  cheers. The houses were then set on fire, and, within fifteen minutes,  presented one mass of conflagration. The palisades likewise caught the  flames, and were consumed, leaving an open space of blackened and smoking  ruins, where, half an hour before, the sun had shone upon a town.    The natives did not remain idle spectators of the destruction of their  houses. Advancing to the edge of the woods, they discharged their muskets  at us, loaded not with Christian bullets, but with copper-slugs, probably  manufactured out of the spikes of the Mary Carver. A marine was struck in  the side by one of these missiles, which tumbled him over, but without  inflicting a serious wound. A party from our ship penetrated the woods  behind the town, where one of them fired at an object which he perceived  moving in the underbrush. Going up to the spot, it proved to be a very  aged man, apparently on the verge of a century, much emaciated, and too  feeble to crawl further in company with his flying towns-people. He was  unharmed by the shot, but evidently expected instant death, and held up  his hand in supplication. Our party placed the poor old patriarch in a  more sheltered spot, and left him there, after supplying him with food; an  act of humanity which must have seemed to him very singular, if not  absurd, in contrast with the mischief which we had wrought upon his home  and people. Meantime, the ships were disposed to have a share in the  fight, and opened a cannonade upon the woods, shattering the great  branches of the trees, and adding to the terror, if not to the loss, of  the enemy. Little Berebee being now a heap of ashes, we re-embarked,  taking with us an American flag, probably that of the Mary Carver, which  had been found in the town. We also made prizes of several canoes, one of  which was built for war, and capable of carrying forty men. The wounded  King Cracko, likewise, was taken on board the frigate, where, next  morning, he breathed his last; thus expiating the outrage in which, two  years before, he had been a principal actor. We afterwards understood that  the natives suffered a loss of eight killed and two wounded.    15.--The season for palavers and diplomacy being now over, we landed at  seven o'clock this morning, ten or twelve miles below Berebee, in order to  measure out a further retribution to the natives. On approaching the  beach, we were fired upon from the bushes, but without damage, although  the enemy were sheltered within twenty yards of the water's edge. The  boat's crew first ashore, together with two or three marines, charged into  the shrubbery and drove off the assailants. All being disembarked, the  detachment was formed in line, and marched to the nearest town, which was  immediately attacked. Like the other native towns, it was protected by a  wall of high palisades, planted firmly in the soil, and bound"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7947"],[0,"The Diary of a U-boat Commander (#18)"],[1," damnable letter; she still refuses to marry me. I leave for Bruges  to-night on forty-eight hours' special leave.          _Kiel, 17th._      I hate Zoe, she has broken my heart.    After her preposterous letter of the 14th, I decided that in a matter  which so closely affected my happiness no stone ought to remain  unturned to ensure a satisfactory solution of the problem, so I  determined to have a personal interview. I arrived at Bruges after tea  and went at once to the flat.    I tackled her immediately on the subject of her letter, and told her  that naturally I understood that a decent interval must elapse before  we married; but, granted this fact, I told her that I failed to see  what prevented our marriage.    A most unpleasant and harrowing scene ensued, the details of which form  such painful recollections that I really cannot write them down here,  though in the passage of months I have acquired the habit of writing in  the pages of this journal with the same freedom as I would talk to that  wife whom I had hoped to possess. She maintained an obstinate silence  when I urged her to give me at least some tangible reason as to why she  would not marry me. She contented herself and maddened me by reflecting  in a kind of monotone: \"I love you, Karl! and am yours, but I cannot  marry you.\"    I could have beaten her till she was senseless, but I had enough sense  to realize that with Zoe, whose resolution, considering she is a woman,  amazes me, force is not the best method. As I continued to press her  (time was important: had I not journeyed far to see her?), those  glorious eyes of hers, which I love and whose power I dread, filled  with tears. I was a brute! I was heartless! I was inconsiderate! I  could not love her! I was cruel! And I know not what other accusation  crushed me down.    Broken-hearted and dispirited, I told her to choose there and then.    She collapsed on to a sofa in a storm of tears, and after a severe  mental struggle I took the only possible course, and leaving the  room--left her for ever. I have resumed my service life determined to  cast her out from my mind.    I will not deceive myself: it will be hard. Love and Logic are deadly  enemies, but Logic must and shall prevail. Though I have seen her for  the last time, I cannot escape the net of fascination which the girl  has thrown over me. Perhaps in the course of time I shall slowly emerge  and free myself from its entanglements. At present I hate her for this  blow she has dealt me, and yet, O Zoe! my darling, how I long to be  with you!           *       *       *       *       *    To-day I went through my final test for qualification as U-boat  commander.    At 9 a.m. I proceeded to sea in command of the U.11, one of the  instructional boats here. We proceeded out into Kiel Bay. On board and  watching my every movement was a committee consisting of a commander  and two lieutenant-commanders.    On arrival at the entrance lightship, I was ordered to attack a convoy  of camouflaged ships which were just visible about fifteen kilometres  away off the Spit Bank. I had a very shrewd idea as to the course they  would steer, and on coming up for my final observation I found myself  in an excellent position, 1,000 metres on the bow of the leading ship.  The rest was easy. I gave the leader the two bow torpedoes, and,  turning sixteen points, fired my stern tube at the third ship of the  line. Two hits were obtained, and I returned to harbour well pleased  with myself. There is not the slightest chance of having failed to  qualify.           *       *       *       *       *    My confidence in myself was not misplaced; I heard to-day that I am on  the command list, and anticipate in a few days being appointed to a  boat. I wonder which craft I shall get?           *       *       *       *       *    I met the A.D.C. to the Chief of the Staff at the school, at the  gardens, and in conversation with him discovered that he had heard that  three boats were being detached from the Flanders flotilla for an  unknown destination. This has given me an idea, for I feel that I can  never return to Bruges, and I was rather dreading being appointed to  one of the boats there. I have dropped a line to Fritz Regels, who is  on old Max's staff, and told him that I do not wish to return to  Bruges, and I further hinted that I understood a detached squadron was  proceeding somewhere, and, as far as I was concerned, the further the  better, if I could get into it.    I have tried the night life at this place at the Mascotte and  Trocadero, [1] in order to forget, but it is a poor consolation.    [Footnote 1: Two well-known cabarets at Kiel.--ETIENNE.]           *       *       *       *       *    A letter from Fritz, saying that he has an idea that Korting's boat  would suit me, though he could not of course give me further details in  a letter; however, he informs me positively that I shall not be at  Bruges.    On the strength of this I have wired to Fritz, and asked him to try and  fix up an exchange between me and Korting, provided the latter is  agreeable and the people in Max's office have no objection. I have a  recollection that Korting's boat is one of the U.40--U.60 class, which  would suit me admirably, and, as for destination, I care not where it  is, provided only that it be far from Bruges.          _At sea_.      I have quite neglected my poor old journal for several weeks. But I  have passed through an extraordinarily busy period.    It was approved that I should relieve Korting, whose boat, the U.59, I  discovered to be refitting at Wilhelmshaven. I was very pleased not to  go back to Bruges, though as we steam steadily north at this moment I  cannot escape a sense of deep disappointment that upon my return from  this trip I shall not enjoy as of old the fascination of Zoe. But I  shall have plenty of time to get accustomed to this idea, for this is  no ordinary trip.    We are bound for the North Cape and Murman Coast, where we remain until  well into the cold weather--at any rate, for three months.    Our mission is to work off that fogbound and desolate coast, and attack  the constant stream of traffic between England and Archangel. There are  two other boats besides ourselves on the job, but we shall all be  working far apart.    Our first billet is off the North Cape. In order to save time, we are  to be provisioned once a month in one of the fjords. I don't imagine  the Admiralty will have any difficulty in getting supplies up to us, as  at the moment we are off the Lofotens, and we actually have not had to  dive since we left the Bight!    There seems to be nothing on the sea except ourselves. Where is the  much vaunted and impenetrable web of blockade which the English are  supposed to have spread around us? And yet many raw materials are  getting very short with us. I see that in this boat they have replaced  several copper pipes with steel ones during her refit, and this will  lead to trouble unless we are careful--steel pipes corrode so badly  that I never feel ready to trust them for pressure work.    The truth about the blockade is that it is largely a paper blockade,  yet not ineffective for all that. Unfortunately for us, the damned  English and their hangers-on control the cables of the world, and hence  all the markets, and I don't suppose, to take the case of copper, that  a single pound of it is mined from the Rio Tinto without the British  Board of Trade knowing all about it. The neutral firms simply dare not  risk getting put on to the British Black List; it means ruination for  them. And then all these dollar-grabbing Yankees, enjoying all the  advantages of war without any of its dangers--they make me sick.    This seems a most profitable job. I have only been up seven days, but  I've bagged four steamers, all by gun-fire, and all fat ships, brimful  of stuff for the Russians. My practice has been to make the North Cape  every day or two to fix position, as the currents are the most abnormal  in these parts, and I should say that the \"Sailing Directions Pilotage  Handbook\" and \"Tidal Charts\" were compiled by a gentleman at a desk who  had never visited these latitudes.    At the moment I am standing well out to sea, as the immediate vicinity  of the North Cape has become rather unhealthy.    Yesterday afternoon (I had sunk number four in the morning, and the  crew were still pulling for the coast) four British trawlers turned up.  These damned little craft seem to turn up wherever one goes. I longed  to have a bang at them with my gun, but, apart from the uncertainty as  to what they carried in the way of armament, I have strict orders to  avoid all that sort of thing, so I dived and steamed slowly west, came  up at dusk and proceeded to charge up my batteries.    These U.60's are excellent boats, and I am very lucky to get one so  soon. I suppose Korting, being a married man, wants to stay near his  wife. I cannot write that word without painful memories of Zoe and idle  thoughts of what might have been. Well, perhaps it is for the best. I  am not sure that a member of the U-boat service has the right to get  married in war-time, for unless he is of exceptional mentality it must  affect his outlook under certain circumstances, though I think I should  have been an exception here. Then the anxiety to the woman must be  enormous; as every trip comes round a voice must cry within her, this  may be the last. The contrast between the times in harbour and the  trips is so violent, so shattering and clear cut.    With a soldier's wife, she merely knows that he is at the front; with  us, at 8 p.m. one may be kissing one's wife in Bruges, and at 6 a.m.  creeping with nerves on edge through the unknown dangers of the Dover  Barrage--but I have strayed from what I meant to write about--my first  command and her crew.    The quarters in this class are immensely superior to the U.C.-boats.  Here I have a little"]]]
