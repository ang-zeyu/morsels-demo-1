Nala dwells      In near Nishadha: oh, a noble Prince,      Not to be matched of men; an Aswin he,      For goodliness. Incomparable maid!      Wert thou but wife to that surpassing chief,      Rich would the fruit grow from such lordly birth,      Such peerless beauty. Slender-waisted one,      Gods, men, and Gandharvas have we beheld,      But never none among them like to him.      As thou art pearl of princesses, so he      Is crown of princes; happy would it fall,      One such perfection should another wed.\"        And when she heard that bird (O King of men!)      The Princess answered: \"Go, dear swan, and tell      This same to Nala;\" and the egg-born said,      \"I go\"--and flew; and told the Prince of all.        But Damayanti, having heard the bird,      Lived fancy-free no more; by Nala's side      Her soul dwelt, while she sat at home distraught,      Mournful and wan, sighing the hours away,      With eyes upcast, and passion-laden looks;      So that, eftsoons, her limbs failed, and her mind--      With love o'erweighted--found no rest in sleep,      No grace in company, no joy at feasts.      Nor night nor day brought peace; always she heaved      Sigh upon sigh, till all her maidens knew--      By glance and mien and moan--how changed she was,      Her own sweet self no more. Then to the King      They told how Damayanti loved the Prince.      Which thing when Bhima from her maidens heard,      Deep pondering for his child what should be done,      And why the Princess was beside herself,      That lord of lands perceived his daughter grown,      And knew that for her high Swayamvara      The time was come.                         So, to the Rajas all      The King sent word: \"Ye Lords of Earth, attend      Of Damayanti the Swayamvara.\"      And when these learned of her Swayamvara,      Obeying Bhima, to his court they thronged--      Elephants, horses, cars--over the land      In full files wending, bearing flags and wreaths      Of countless hues, with gallant companies      Of fighting men. And those high-hearted chiefs      The strong-armed King welcomed with worship fair,      As fitted each, and led them to their seats.        Now at that hour there passed towards Indra's heaven,      Thither from earth ascending, those twain saints--      The wise, the pure, the mighty-minded ones,      The self-restrained--Narad and Parvata.      The mansion of the Sovereign of the Gods      In honor entered they; and he, the Lord      Of Clouds, dread Indra, softly them salutes,      Inquiring of their weal, and of the world      Wherethrough their name was famous, how it fares.        Then Narad said: \"Well is it, Lord of Gods,      With us, and with our world; and well with those      Who rule the peoples, O thou King in Heaven!\"        But He that slew the Demons spake again:--      \"The princes of the earth, just-minded, brave,      Those who, in battle fearing not to fall,      See death on the descending blade, and charge      Full front against it, turning not their face--      Theirs is this realm eternal, as to me      The cow of plenty, Kamadhuk, belongs.      Where be my Kshatriya warriors? Wherefore now      See I none coming of those slaughtered lords,      Chiefs of mankind, our always honored guests?\"        And unto Indra Narad gave reply:--      \"King of the Air! no wars are waged below;      None fall in fight, to enter here. The Lord      Of high Vidarbha hath a daughter, famed      For loveliness beyond all earthly maids,      The Princess Damayanti, far-renowned.      Of her, dread Sakra! the Swayamvara      Shall soon befall, and thither now repair      The kings and princes of all lands, to woo--      Each for himself--this pearl of womanhood.      For oh, thou Slayer of the Demons, all      Desire the maid.\"                       Drew round, while Narad spake,      The Masters, th'Immortals, pressing in      With Agni and the Greatest, near the throne,      To listen to the speech of Narada;      Whom having heard, all cried delightedly,      \"We, too, will go.\" Thereupon those high gods,      With chariots, and with heavenly retinues,      Sped to Vidarbha, where the kings were met.      And Nala, knowing of this kingly tryst,      Went thither joyous, heart-full with the thought      Of Damayanti.                    Thus it chanced the gods      Beheld the Prince wending along his road,      Goodly of mien, as is the Lord of Love.      The world's Protectors saw him, like a sun      For splendor; and, in very wonder, paused      Some time irresolute, so fair he was;      Then in mid-sky their golden chariots stayed,      And through the clouds descending called to him:--      \"Abo! Nala of Nishadha! Noblest Prince,      Be herald for us; bear our message now.\"        \"Yea!\" Nala made reply, \"this will I do\"--      And then--palm unto palm in reverence pressed--      Asked: \"Shining Ones, who are ye? Unto whom,      And what words bearing, will ye that I go?      Deign to instruct me what it is ye bid.\"      Thus the Prince spake, and Indra answered him:--      \"Thou seest th'immortal gods. Indra am I,      And this is Agni, and the other here,      Varuna, Lord of Waters; and beyond,      Yama, the King of Death, who parteth souls      From mortal frames. To Damayanti go;      Tell our approach. Say this: 'The world's dread lords,      Wishful to see thee, come; desiring thee--      Indra, Varuna, Agni, Yama, all.      Choose of these powers to which thou wilt be given.'\"      But Nala, hearing that, joined palms again,      And cried: \"Ah, send me not, with one accord      For this, most mighty Gods! How should a man      Sue for another, being suitor too?      How bear such errand? Have compassion, Gods!\"        Then spake they: \"Yet thou saidst, 'This shall I do,'      Nishadha's Prince! and wilt thou do it not,      Forswearing faith? Nay, but depart, and soon!\"        So bid, but lingering yet again, he said:--      \"Well guarded are the gates; how shall I find      Speech with her?\"                        \"Thou shalt find,\" Indra replied.      And, lo! upon that word Nala was brought      To Damayanti's chamber. There he saw      Vidarbha's glory, sitting 'mid her maids,      In majesty and grace surpassing all;      So exquisite, so delicate of form,      Waist so fine-turned, such limbs, such lighted eyes,      The moon hath meaner radiance than she.      Love at the sight of that soft smiling face      Sprang to full passion, while he stood and gazed.      Yet, faith and duty urging, he restrained      His beating heart; but when those beauteous maids      Spied Nala, from their cushions they uprose,      Startled to see a man, yet startled more      Because he showed so heavenly bright and fair.      In wondering pleasure each saluted him,      Uttering no sound, but murmuring to themselves:--      \"Aho! the grace of him: aho! the brilliance;      Aho! what glorious strength lives in his limbs!      What is he? Is he God, Gandharva, Yaksha?\"      But this unspoken, for they dared not breathe      One syllable, all standing shyly there      To see him, and to see his youth so sweet.      Yet, softly glancing back to his soft glance,      The Princess, presently, with fluttering breath,      Accosted Nala, saying: \"Fairest Prince,      Who by thy faultless form hath filled my heart      With sudden joy, coming as come the gods,      Unstayed, I crave to know thee, who thou art;      How didst thou enter? how wert thou unseen?      Our palace is close-guarded, and the King      Hath issued mandates stern.\"                                  Tenderly spake      The Prince, replying to those tender words:--      \"Most lovely! I am Nala. I am come      A herald of the gods unto thee here.      The gods desire thee, the immortal Four--      Indra, Varuna, Yama, Agni. Choose,      O Brightest! one from these to be thy lord.      By their help is it I have entered in      Unseen; none could behold me at thy gates,      Nor stay me, passing; and to speak their will      They sent me, fairest one and best. Do thou,      Knowing the message, judge as seemeth well.\"        She bowed her head, hearing the great gods named,      And then, divinely smiling, said to him:--      \"Pledge thyself faithfully to me, and I      Will seek, O Raja, only how to pay      That debt with all I am, with all I have;      For I and mine are thine--in full trust thine.      Make me that promise, Prince. Thy gentle name--      Sung by the swan--first set my thoughts afire;      And for thy sake--only for thee--sweet Lord,      The kings were summoned hither. If, alas!      Fair Prince, thou dost reject my sudden love,      So proffered, then must poison, flame, or flood,      Or knitted cord, be my sad remedy.\"        So spake Vidarbha's Pride; and Nala said:--      \"With gods so waiting--with the world's dread lords      Hastening to woo, canst thou desire a man?      Bethink! I, unto these, that make and mar,      These all-wise ones, almighty, am like dust      Under their feet: lift thy heart to the height      Of what I bring. If mortal man offend      The most high gods, death is what springs of it.      Spare me to live, thou faultless lady! Choose      Which of these excellent great gods thou wilt;      Wear the unstained robes! bear on thy brows      The wreaths which never fade, of heavenly blooms!      Be, as thou mayest, a goddess, and enjoy      Godlike delights! Him who enfolds the earth,      Creating and consuming, Brightest Power,      Hutasa, Eater of the Sacrifice,      What woman would not take? Or him whose rod      Herds all the generations forward still      On virtue's path, Red Yama, King of Death,      What woman would affront? Or him, the all-good,      All-wise destroyer of the Demons, first      In heaven, Mahendra--who of womankind      Is there that would not wed? Or, if thy mind      Incline, doubt not to choose Varuna; he "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13272"],[0,"Beethoven's Letters 1790-1826, Volume 2 (#19)"],[1," entire restoration, still I greatly fear that this will never be the  case, and on this account I hope for Y.R.H.'s indulgence. As I can now at  length prove how gladly I place myself at Y.R.H.'s disposal, my most  anxious desire is that you would be pleased to make use of me.    [K.]      353.    TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.    1823.    I have just been enjoying a short walk and composing a Canon, \"Grossen  Dank, / / /,\" when, on returning home, with the intention of writing it out  for Y.R.H., I find a petitioner who is under the delusion that his request  will be better received if made through me. What can I do? A good action  cannot be too soon performed, and even a whim must be sometimes humored.  The bearer of this is Kapellmeister Drechsler, of the Josephstadt and Baden  Theatre; he wishes to obtain the situation of second Court organist. He has  a good knowledge of thorough bass, and is also a good organist, besides  being favorably known as a composer,--all qualities that recommend him for  this situation. He _rightly_ thinks that the best recommendation to secure  him the appointment is that of Y.R.H., who, being yourself so great a  connoisseur and performer, know better than any one how to appreciate true  merit; and assuredly H.I. Majesty would prefer such testimony to every  other. I therefore add my entreaties, though with some hesitation, to those  of Herr D., relying on the indulgence and kindness of Y.R.H., and in the  hope that the illustrious patron and protector of all that is good will do  what lies in his power to be of use on this occasion.    My Canon shall be sent to-morrow,[1] together with the confession of my  sins, intentional and unintentional, for which I beg your gracious  absolution. My eyes, alas! prevent me from saying to-day as I could wish my  hopes and desires that all good may attend you.    P.S. I ought also to mention that Herr Drechsler is the unsalaried  professor of thorough bass at St. Anna's, and has been so for the last ten  years.    [K.]    [Footnote 1: The Canon, _Grossen Dank, / / /_, is not to be found in either  Breitkopf & Haertel's or Thayer's catalogue, nor anywhere else.]      354.    TO F. RIES.    Baden, September 5, 1823.    MY DEAR FRIEND,--    You advise me to engage some one to look after my affairs; now I did so as  to the Variations; that is, my brother and Schindler took charge of them,  but how?    The Variations were not to have appeared here till after being published in  London; but everything went wrong. The dedication to Brentano [Antonie v.  Brentano, _nee_ Edlen von Birkenstock] was to be confined to Germany, I  being under great obligations to her, and having nothing else to spare at  the moment; indeed, Diabelli, the publisher, alone got it from me. But  everything went through Schindler's hands. No man on earth was ever more  contemptible,--an arch villain; but I soon sent him packing! I will  dedicate some other work to your wife in the place of this one. You, no  doubt, received my last letter [No. 346]. I think thirty ducats would be  enough for one of the _Allegri di Bravura_, but I should like to publish  them here at the same time, which might easily be arranged. Why should I  give up so much profit to these rogues here? It will not be published here  till I am told that it has arrived in London; moreover, you may yourself  fix the price, as you best know London customs.    The copyist to-day at last finished the score of the Symphony; so  Kirchhoffer and I are only waiting for a favorable opportunity to send it  off. I am still here, being very ill when I arrived, and my health still  continues in a most precarious condition, and, good heavens! instead of  amusing myself like others at these baths, my necessities compel me to  write every day. I am also obliged to drink the mineral waters besides  bathing. The copy will shortly be sent off; I am only waiting till I hear  of an opportunity from Kirchhoffer, for it is too bulky to forward by post.    My last letter must have given you an insight into everything. I will send  you some choruses; let me have any commissions for oratorios as soon as you  can, that I may fix the time at once. I am sorry about the Variations on  account of ----, as I wrote them more for London than here. This is not my  fault. Answer me very soon, both as to particulars and time. Kind regards  to your family.      355.    TO F. RIES,--LONDON.    Baden, September 5, 1823.    MY DEAR KIND RIES,--    I have still no tidings of the Symphony, but you may depend on its soon  being in London. Were I not so poor as to be obliged to live by my pen, I  would accept nothing from the Philharmonic Society; but as it is, I must  wait till the money for the Symphony is made payable here; though as a  proof of my interest and confidence in that Society, I have already sent  off the new Overture, and I leave it to them to settle the payment as they  please.    My brother, who keeps his carriage, wished also to profit by me; so without  asking my permission, he offered this Overture to Boosey, a London  publisher. Pray, tell him that my brother was mistaken with regard to the  Overture. I see now that he bought it from me in order to practise usury  with it. _O Frater!!_    I have never yet received the Symphony you dedicated to me. If I did not  regard this dedication as a kind of challenge to which I am bound to  respond, I would ere this have dedicated some work to you. I always,  however, wished first to see yours, and how joyfully would I then testify  my gratitude to you in one way or another.    I am, indeed deeply your debtor for your kind services and many proofs of  attachment. Should my health improve by my intended course of baths, I hope  to kiss your wife in London in 1824.    Yours, ever,    BEETHOVEN.      356.    TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.    1823.    I have just heard that Y.R.H. is expected here to-morrow. If I am still  unable to follow the impulse of my heart, I hope you will ascribe it to the  state of my eyes. I am better, but for some days to come I dare not breathe  the town air, so prejudicial to my eyes. I only wish that the next time  Y.R.H. returns from Baden, you would be so good as to let me know, and also  name the hour at which I am to present myself, and once more have the good  fortune to see my gracious master. But as it is probable Y.R.H. will not  long remain here, it is the more incumbent on us to take advantage of the  short time at our disposal to carry out our artistic discussions and  practice. I will myself bring \"Grossen Dank, / / /,\" as it must be sent to  Baden. Herr Drechsler thanked me to-day for the _liberty_ I had taken in  recommending him to Y.R.H., who received him so graciously that I beg to  express my warmest gratitude for your kindness. I trust that Y.R.H. will  continue firm, for it is said that Abbe Stadler is endeavoring to procure  the situation in question for some one else. It would also be very  beneficial to Drechsler if Y.R.H. would vouchsafe to speak to Count  Dietrichstein[1] on the subject. I once more request the favor of being  told the date of your return from Baden, when I will instantly hasten into  town to wait on the best master I have in this world. Y.R.H.'s health seems  to be good; Heaven be praised that it is so, for the sake of so many who  wish it, and among this number I may certainly be included.    [K.]    [Footnote 1: Count Moritz Dietrichstein was in 1823 Court director of the  royal band.]      357.    TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.    I was very much affected on receiving your gracious letter yesterday. To  flourish under the shade of a stately verdant fruit-tree is refreshing to  any one capable of elevated thought and feeling, and thus it is with me  under the aegis of Y.R.H. My physician assured me yesterday that my malady  was disappearing, but I am still obliged to swallow a whole bottle of some  mixture every day, which weakens me exceedingly, and compels me, as Y.R.H.  will see from the enclosed instructions of the physician, to take a great  deal of exercise. I have every hope, however, that soon, even if not  entirely recovered, I shall be able to be a great deal with Y.R.H. during  your stay here. This hope will tend to recruit my health sooner than usual.  May Heaven bestow its blessings on me through Y.R.H., and may the Lord ever  guard and watch over you! Nothing can be more sublime than to draw nearer  to the Godhead than other men, and to diffuse here on earth these godlike  rays among mortals. Deeply impressed by the gracious consideration of  Y.R.H. towards me, I hope very soon to be able to wait on you.    [K.]      358.    TO SCHINDLER.    Baden, September, 1823.    SIGNORE PAPAGENO,--    That your scandalous reports may no longer distress the poor Dresdener, I  must tell you that the money reached me to-day, accompanied by every  possible mark of respect to myself.    Though I should have been happy to offer you a _substantial_ acknowledgment  for the [illegible, effaced by Schindler] you have shown me, I cannot yet  accomplish to the full extent what I have so much at heart. I hope to be  more fortunate some weeks hence. [See No. 329.]    _Per il Signore Nobile, Papageno Schindler._      359.    TO SCHINDLER.    1823.    The occurrence that took place yesterday, which you will see in the police  reports, is only too likely to attract the notice of the established police  to this affair. The testimony of a person whose name is not given entirely  coincides with yours. In such a case private individuals cannot act; the  authorities alone are empowered to do so.[1]    Yours,    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: Schindler says, \"Brother Johann, the apothecary, was ill in  the summer of 1823, and during that time his disreputable wife visited her  lover, an officer, in the barracks, and was often seen walking with him in  the most frequented places, besides receiving him in her own house. Her  husband, though confined to bed,"]]]
