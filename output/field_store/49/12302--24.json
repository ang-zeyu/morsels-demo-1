The Onondaga  leader, after reciting the evidence which had been laid before him to  show that these lands had been sold to the colonists by the Delawares,  and severely rebuking the latter for their breach of faith in  repudiating the bargain, continued: \"But how came you to take upon you  to sell land at all? We conquered you. We made women of you. You know  you are women, and can no more sell land than women. Nor is it fit that  you should have the power of selling lands, since you would abuse it.  This very land that you now claim has been consumed by you. You have had  it in meat and drink and clothes, and now you want it again, like  children, as you are. But what makes you sell land in the dark? Did you  ever tell us that you had sold this land? Did we ever receive any part  of the price, even the value of a pipe-stem from you? You have told us a  blind story--that you sent a messenger to inform us of the sale; but he  never came among us, nor have we ever heard anything about it. And for  all these reasons we charge you to remove instantly. We don't give you  the liberty to think about it. We assign you two places to go, either to  Wyoming or Shamokin. You may go to either of those places, and then we  shall have you more under our eyes, and shall see how you behave. Don't  deliberate, but remove away; and take this belt of wampum.\" [Footnote:  Golden: _History of the Five Nations_, Vol. II, p. 36 (2d Edition).]    This imperious allocution, such as a Cinna or a Cornelius might have  delivered to a crowd of trembling and sullen Greeks, shows plainly  enough the relation in which the two communities stood to one another.  It proves also that the rule under which the conquered Delawares were  held was anything but oppressive. They seem to have been allowed almost  entire freedom, except only in making war and in disposing of their  lands without the consent of the Six Nations. In fact, the Iroquois, in  dealing with them, anticipated the very regulations which the  enlightened governments of the United States and England now enforce in  that benevolent treatment of the Indian tribes for which they justly  claim high credit. Can they refuse a like credit to their dusky  predecessors and exemplars, or deny them the praise of being, as has  been already said, the most clement of conquerors?    4. Finally, when a tribe within what may be called \"striking distance\"  of the Confederacy would neither join the League, nor enter into an  alliance with its members, nor come under their protection, there  remained nothing but a chronic state of warfare, which destroyed all  sense of security and comfort. The Iroquois hunter, fisherman, or  trader, returning home after a brief absence, could never be sure that  he would not find his dwelling a heap of embers, smoldering over the  mangled remains of his wife and children. The plainest dictates of  policy taught the Confederates that the only safe method in dealing with  such persistent and unappeasable foes was to crush them utterly. Among  the most dangerous of their enemies were the Hurons and the eastern  Algonkins, sustained and encouraged by the French colonists. It is from  them and their historians chiefly that the complaints of Iroquois  cruelties have descended to us; but the same historians have not omitted  to inform us that the first acquaintance of the Iroquois with triese  colonists was through two most wanton and butcherly assaults which  Champlain and his soldiers, in company with their Indian allies, made  upon their unoffending neighbors. No milder epithets can justly describe  these unprovoked invasions, in which the Iroquois bowmen, defending  their homes, were shot down mercilessly with firearms, by strangers whom  they had never before seen or perhaps even heard of. This stroke of evil  policy, which tarnished an illustrious name, left far-reaching  consequences, affecting the future of half a continent. Its first result  was the destruction of the Hurons, the special allies and instigators of  the colonists in their hostilities. The Attiwandaronks, or Neutrals,  with whom, till this time, the Iroquois had maintained peaceful  relations, shared the same fate; for they were the friends of the Hurons  and the French. The Eries perished in a war provoked, as the French  missionaries in their always trustworthy accounts inform us, by a  perverse freak of cruelty on their own part.    Yet, in all these destructive wars, the Iroquois never for a moment  forgot the principles which lay at the foundation of their League, and  which taught them to \"strengthen their house\" by converting enemies into  friends. On the instant that resistance ceased, slaughter ceased with  it. The warriors who were willing to unite their fortunes with the  Confederates were at once welcomed among them. Some were adopted into  the families of those who had lost children or brothers. Others had  lands allotted to them, on which they were allowed to live by  themselves, under their own chiefs and their native laws, until in two  or three generations, by friendly intercourse, frequent intermarriages,  and community of interests, they became gradually absorbed into the  society about them. Those who suppose that the Hurons only survive in a  few Wyandots, and that the Eries, Attiwandaronks, and Andastes have  utterly perished, are greatly mistaken. It is absolutely certain that of  the twelve thousand Indians who now, in the United States and Canada,  preserve the Iroquois name, the greater portion derive their descent, in  whole or in part, from those conquered nations. [Footnote: \"Ces  victoires lear caasant presque autant de perte qu'a leurs ennemis, elles  ont tellement depeuple leurs Bourgs, qu'on y compte plus d'Estfangers  que de naturels du pays. Onnontaghe a sept nations differentes qut s'y  sont venues establir, et il s'en trouve jusqu'a onze dans Sonnontoiian.\"  _Relation of_ 1657, p. 34. \"Qui feroit la supputation des francs  Iroquois, auroit de la peine d'en trouver plus de douze cents (i. e.  combattans) en toutes les cinq Nations, parce que le plus grand nombre  n'est compose que d'un ramas de divers peuples qu'ils ont conquestez,  commes des Hurons, des Tionnontateronnons, autrement Nation du Petun;  des Attiwendaronk, qu'on appelloit Neutres, quand ils estoient sur pied;  des Riquehronnons, qui sont ceux de la Nation des Chats; des Ontwaganha,  ou Nation du Feu; des Trakwaehronnons, et autres, qui, tout estrangers  qu'ils sont, font sans doute la plus grande et la meilleure parties des  Iroquois.\" _Ret. de_ 1660, p. 7. Yet, it was this \"conglomeration of  divers peoples\" that, under the discipline of Iroquois institutions and  the guidance of Iroquois statesmen and commanders, held high the name of  the Kanonsionni, and made the Confederacy a great power on the continent  for more than a century after this time; who again and again measured  arms and intellects with French generals and diplomatists, and came off  at least with equal fortune; who smote their Abenaki enemies in the far  east, punished the Illinois marauders in the far west, and thrust back  the intruding Cherokees into their southern mountains; who were a wall  of defence to the English colonies, and a strong protection to the many  broken bands of Indians which from every quarter clustered round the  shadow of the \"great pine tree\" of Onondaga.] No other Indian community,  so far as we know, has ever pursued this policy of incorporation to  anything near the same extent, or carried it out with anything like the  same humanity. Even towards the most determined and the most savage of  their foes, the Kanonsionni, when finally victorious, showed themselves  ever magnanimous and placable.    The common opinion of the cruelty of the Iroquois has arisen mainly from  the custom which they occasionally practiced, like some other Indians,  of burning prisoners at the stake. Out of the multitude of their  captives, the number subjected to this torture was really very  small,--probably not nearly as large in proportion as the number of  criminals and political prisoners who, in some countries of Europe, at  about the same time, were subjected to the equally cruel torments of the  rack and the wheel. These criminals and other prisoners were so tortured  because they were regarded as the enemies of society. The motives which  actuated the Iroquois were precisely the same. As has been before  remarked, the mode in which their enemies carried on their warfare with  them was chiefly by stealthy and sudden inroads. The prowling warrior  lurked in the woods near the Iroquois village through the day, and at  night fell with hatchet and club upon his unsuspecting victims. The  Iroquois lawgivers deemed it essential for the safety of their people  that the men who were guilty of such murderous attacks should have  reason to apprehend, if caught, a direful fate.    If the comparatively few instances of these political tortures which  occurred among the Iroquois are compared with the awful list of similar  and worse inflictions which stain the annals of the most enlightened  nations of Europe and Asia, ancient and modern,--the crucifixions, the  impalements, the dreadful mutilations--lopping of hands and feet,  tearing out of eyes--the tortures of the rack and wheel, the red-hot  pincers, the burning crown, the noisome dungeon, the slow starvation,  the lingering death in the Siberian mines,--it will become evident that  these barbarians were far inferior to their civilized contemporaries in  the temper and arts of inhumanity. Even in the very method of punishment  which they adopted the Indians were outdone in Europe, and that,  strangely enough, by the two great colonizing and conquering nations,  heirs of all modern enlightenment, who came to displace them,--the  English and the Spaniards.

I readily consent.'    Prince Ahmed went the next morning with the same attendants as  before, but much finer, and himself more magnificently mounted,  equipped, and dressed, and was received by the sultan with the same  joy and satisfaction. For several months he constantly paid him  visits, and always in a richer and more brilliant equipage.    At last some viziers, the sultan's favourites, who judged of Prince  Ahmed's grandeur and power by the figure he made, abused the  liberty the sultan gave them of speaking to him, to make him  jealous of his son. They represented to him that it was but common  prudence to know where the prince had retired, and how he could  afford to live at such a rate, since he had no revenue or income  assigned him; that he seemed to come to court only to brave him;  and that it was to be feared he might stir up the people's favour  and dethrone him.    The Sultan of the Indies was so far from thinking that Prince Ahmed  could be capable of so wicked a design as his favourites would make  him believe, that he said to them, 'You are mistaken; my son loves  me, and I am assured of his tenderness and fidelity. Be it as it  will, I do not believe my son Ahmed is so wicked as you would  persuade me he is; however, I am obliged to you for your good  advice, and do not doubt that it proceeds from a good intention.'    The Sultan of the Indies said this that his favourites might not  know the impression their hints had made on his mind. He was,  however, so much alarmed that he resolved to have Prince Ahmed  watched, unknown to his grand vizier. For this end he sent for a  sorceress, who was introduced by a private door into his room. 'My  son Ahmed comes to my court every month; but I cannot learn from  him where he resides, and I do not wish to force his secret out of  him; but I believe you are capable of satisfying my curiosity,  without letting him, or any of my court, know anything of the  matter. You know that at present he is here with me, and is used to  go away without taking leave of me, or any of my court. Go  immediately out on the road, find out where he retires, and bring  me word.'    The magician left the sultan, and knowing the place where Prince  Ahmed found his arrow, went thither and hid herself near the rocks,  so that nobody could see her.    The next morning Prince Ahmed set out by daybreak, without taking  leave either of the sultan or of any of his court, according to  custom. The magician, seeing him coming, followed him with her  eyes, till all of a sudden she lost sight of him and his  attendants.    The steepness of the rocks formed an insurmountable barrier to men,  whether on horseback or on foot, so that the magician judged that  there were but two ways; the prince had retired either into some  cavern, or into some place underground, the abode of genies or  fairies. When she thought the prince and his attendants were out of  sight, she came out of the place where she had hidden herself, and  went direct to the hollow where she had seen them go in. She  entered it, and proceeded to the spot where it terminated in many  windings, looking carefully about on all sides. But notwithstanding  all her diligence she could perceive no opening, nor the iron gate  which Prince Ahmed discovered. For this door was to be seen by and  opened to none but men, and only to men whose presence was  agreeable to the fairy Pari Banou, and not at all to women.    The magician, who saw it was in vain for her to search any further,  was obliged to be satisfied with the discovery she had made, and  returned to give the sultan an account. When she had told him what  she had done, she added, 'Your majesty may easily understand, after  what I have had the honour to tell you, that it will be no  difficult matter to give you the satisfaction you desire concerning  Prince Ahmed's conduct. To do this, I only ask time, and that you  will have patience, and give me leave to do it without inquiring  what measures I intend to take.'    The sultan was very well pleased with the magician's conduct, and  said to her, 'Do as you think fit: I will wait patiently,' and to  encourage her, he made her a present of a diamond of great value,  telling her it was only an earnest of the ample reward she should  receive when she had done him that important service, which he left  to her management.    As Prince Ahmed, after he had obtained the fairy Pari Banou's leave  to go to the Sultan of the Indies' court, never failed once a  month, and the magician knew the time, she went a day or two before  to the foot of the rock where she had lost sight of the prince and  his attendants, and waited there with a plan she had formed.    The next morning Prince Ahmed went out as usual at the iron gate  with the same attendants as before, and passed by the magician,  whom he knew not to be such. Seeing her lie with her head on the  rock, complaining as if she were in great pain, he pitied her,  turned his horse about and went and asked her what was the matter,  and what he could do to relieve her.    The artful sorceress, without lifting up her head, looked at the  prince, and answered in broken words and sighs, as if she could  hardly fetch her breath, that she was going to the city, but on the  way thither was taken with so violent a fever that her strength  failed her, and she was forced to stop and lie down, far from any  habitation, and without any hope of assistance.    'Good woman,' replied Prince Ahmed, 'you are not so far from help  as you imagine. I am ready to assist you, and to convey you where  you shall not only have all possible care taken of you, but where  you will find a speedy cure; only get up, and let one of my people  take you.'    At these words, the magician, who pretended illness only to know  where the prince lived, did not refuse the kind offer he made her  so freely, and to show her acceptance rather by action than by  word, she made many affected efforts to get up, pretending that her  illness prevented her. At the same time two of the prince's  attendants alighted off their horses, helped her up, and set her  behind another. They mounted their horses again, and followed the  prince, who turned back to the iron gate, which was opened by one  of his retinue who rode before. When he came into the outer court  of the fairy's palace, without dismounting, he sent to tell her he  wanted to speak to her.    The fairy Pari Banou came with all haste, not knowing what made  Prince Ahmed return so soon. Not giving her time to ask him, he  said, 'My princess, I desire you would have compassion on this good  woman,' pointing to the magician, who was taken off the horse by  two of his retinue: 'I found her in the condition you see, and  promised her the assistance she stands in need of. I commend her to  your care, and am persuaded that you will not abandon her.'    The fairy Pari Banou, who had her eyes fixed upon the pretended  sick woman all the time that the prince was talking, ordered two of  the women who followed her to take her from the two men that held  her up, and carry her into the palace, and take as much care of her  as they could.    Whilst the two women executed the fairy's commands, she went up to  Prince Ahmed, and whispering in his ear said, 'Prince, I commend  your compassion, which is worthy of you, but give me leave to tell  you that I am afraid it will be but ill rewarded. This woman is not  so ill as she pretends to be; and I am very much mistaken if she is  not sent hither on purpose to cause you great trouble. But do not  be concerned, let what will be devised against you; be persuaded  that I will deliver you out of all the snares that may be laid for  you. Go and pursue your journey.'    This discourse of the fairy's did not in the least alarm Prince  Ahmed. 'My princess,' said he, 'as I do not remember I ever did, or  designed to do, anybody an injury, I cannot believe anybody can  have a thought of doing me one; but if they have, I shall not  forbear doing good whenever I have an opportunity.' So saying, he  took leave of the fairy, and set out again for his father's  capital, where he soon arrived, and was received as usual by the  sultan, who restrained himself as much as possible, to disguise the  trouble arising from the suspicions suggested by his favourites.    In the meantime, the two women to whom the fairy Pari Banou had  given her orders carried the magician into a very fine apartment,  richly furnished. First they set her down upon a sofa, with her  back supported with a cushion of gold brocade, while they made a  bed, the quilt of which was finely embroidered with silk, the  sheets of the finest linen, and the coverlid cloth of gold. When  they had put her into bed (for the old sorceress pretended that her  fever was so violent that she could not help herself in the least),  one of the women went out and soon returned again with a china cup  in her hand full of a certain liquor, which she presented to the  magician, while the other helped her to sit up. 'Drink this,' said  she, 'it is the water of the fountain of lions, and a sovereign  remedy against all fevers whatsoever. You will find the effect of  it in less than an hour's time.'    The magician, to dissemble the better, took it after a great deal  of entreaty, as if she was very much averse to having it, but at  last taking the china cup, and shaking her head, as if she did  great violence to herself, swallowed the liquor. When she had lain  down again, the two women covered her up. 'Lie quiet,' said she who  brought her the china cup, 'and get a little sleep if you can; we  will leave you, and hope to find you perfectly cured when we come  an hour hence.'    The magician, who came not to act a sick part long, but only to  discover Prince Ahmed's retreat, and what made him leave his  father's court,"]]]
