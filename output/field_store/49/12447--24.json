On one occasion when a  party of German serenaders appeared at the hotel where the party was  stopping, before Mr. Schurz had completed a necessary change of toilet  Field stepped out on the veranda, and, waving the vociferous cornet and  trombone to silence, proceeded to address the crowd in broken English.  As he went on the cheering soon subsided into amazed silence at the  heterodox doctrines he uttered, until the bogus candidate was pushed  unceremoniously aside by the real one. Mr. Schurz had great difficulty  in saving Field from the just wrath of the crowd, which had resented  his broken English more than his political heresies.    On another occasion when there was a momentary delay on the part of the  gentleman who was to introduce Mr. Schurz, Field stepped to the front  and with a strong German accent addressed the gathering as follows:      LADIES AND SHENTLEMEN: I haf such a pad colt dot et vas not bossible    for me to make you a speedg to-night, but I haf die bleasure to    introduce to you my prilliant chournatistic friend Euchene Fielt, who    will spoke you in my blace.    It was all done so quickly and so seriously that the joke was complete  before Mr. Schurz could push himself into the centre of the stage.  Annoyance and mirth mingled in the explanations that followed. A love  of music common to both was the only thing that made Field tolerable to  his serious-minded elder.    Regarding Eugene Field's work upon the St. Jo Gazette, it was local in  character and of the most ephemeral nature. There is preserved in the  pocket-books of some old printers in the West the galley proof of a  doggerel rhyme read by him at the printers' banquet, at St. Joseph,  Mo., January 1st, 1876. It details the fate of a \"Rat\" printer, who,  in addition to the mortal offence of \"spacing out agate\" type with  brevier, sealed his doom by stepping on the tail of our old friend,  the French poodle McSweeny. The execution of the victim's sentence  was described as follows:      _His body in the fatal cannon then they force    Shouting erstwhile in accents madly hoarse,    \"Death to all Rats\"--the fatal match is struck,    The cannon pointed upwards--then kerchuck!    Fiz! Snap! Ker--boom! Slug 14's grotesque form    Sails out to ride a race upon the storm,    Up through the roof, and up into the sky--    As if he sought for \"cases\" up on high,    Till like a rocket, or like one who's trusted,    He fell again to earth--completely busted._    There is not much suggestion, or even promise, in this doggerel, of  the Eugene Field whose verses of occasion were destined within a dozen  years to be sought for in every newspaper office in America.    Long before Field learned the value of his time and writing, he began  to appreciate the value of printer's ink and showed much shrewdness in  courting its favor. He did not wait for chance to bring his wares into  notice, but early joined the circle of busy paragraphers who formed a  wider, if less distinguished, mutual admiration society than that  free-masonry of authorship which at one time almost limited literary  fame in the United States to Henry James, William Dean Howells, Charles  Dudley Warner, and Thomas Bailey Aldrich. Robert J. Burdette is about  the only survivor of the coterie of paragraphers, who, a quarter of a  century ago, made such papers as the Burlington Hawkeye, the Detroit  Free Press, the Oil City Derrick, the Danbury News, and the Cincinnati  Saturday Night, widely quoted throughout the Union for their clever  squibs and lively sallies. Field put himself in the way of the  reciprocating round of mutual quotation and spicy comment, and before  he left St. Louis his \"Funny Fancies\" in the Times-Journal had the  approval of his fellow-jesters if they could not save that paper from  its approaching doom.    Before leaving St. Louis, however, Eugene Field was to strike one of  the notes that was to vibrate so sweetly and surely to his touch unto  the end. He had lost one baby son in St. Jo, and Melvin was a mere  large-eyed infant when his father was moved at Christmas-time, 1878,  to write his \"Christmas Treasures,\" which he frequently, though  incorrectly, declared to be \"the first verse I ever wrote.\" He probably  meant by this that it was the first verse he ever wrote \"that he cared  to preserve,\" those specimens I have introduced being only given as  marking the steps crude and faltering by which he attained a facility  and technique in the art of versification seldom surpassed.    In Mr. Field's \"Auto-Analysis\" will be found the following reference to  this early specimen of his verse:      I wrote and published my first bit of verse in 1879: It was entitled    \"Christmas Treasures\" [see \"Little Book of Western Verse\"]. Just ten    years later I began suddenly to write verse very frequently.    Which merely indicates what little track Field kept of how, when, or  where he wrote the verse that attracted popular attention and by which  he is best remembered. I need hardly say that with a few noteworthy  exceptions his most highly-prized poems were written before 1888, as a  reference to the \"Little Book of Western Verse,\" above cited, and which  was published in 1889, will clearly show.    In the year 1880 Field received and accepted an offer of the managing  editorship of the Kansas City Times, a position which he filled with  singular ability and success, but which for a year put an almost  absolute extinguisher on his growth as a writer. Under his management  the Times became the most widely-quoted newspaper west of the  Mississippi. He made it the vehicle for every sort of quaint and  exaggerated story that the free and rollicking West could furnish or  invent. He was not particular whether the Times printed the first,  fullest, or most accurate news of the day so long as its pages were  racy with the liveliest accounts and comments on the daily comedy,  eccentricity, and pathos of life.    Right merrily did he abandon himself to the buoyant spirits of an  irrepressible nature. Never sparing himself in the duties of his  exacting position on the Times, neither did he spare himself in  extracting from life all the honey of comedy there was in it. His  salary did not begin to keep pace with his tastes and his pleasures.  But he faced debts with the calm superiority of a genius to whom the  world owed and was willing to pay a living.    There lived in Kansas City, when Field was at the height of his local  fame there, one George Gaston, whose cafe and bar was the resort of all  the choice spirits of the town. He fairly worshipped Field, who made  his place famous by entertainments there, and by frequent squibs in the  Times. Although George had a rule suspending credit when the checks  given in advance of pay day amounted to more than a customer's weekly  salary, he never thought of enforcing it in the case of 'Gene. More  than once some particularly fine story or flattering notice of the good  cheer at Gaston's sufficed to restore Field's credit on George's  spindle. At Christmas-time that credit was under a cloud of checks for  two bits (25 cents), four bits, and a dollar or more each to the total  of $135.50, when, touched by some simple piece that Field wrote in the  Times, Gaston presented his bill for the amount endorsed \"paid in  full.\" When the document was handed to Field he scanned it for a moment  and then walked over to the bar, behind which George was standing  smiling complacently and eke benevolently.    \"How's this, George?\" said Field.    \"Oh, that's all right,\" returned George.    \"But this is receipted,\" continued the ex-debtor.    \"Sure,\" said the gracious creditor.    \"Do I understand,\" said Field, with a gravity that should have warned  his friend, \"that I have paid this bill?\"    \"That's what,\" was George's laconic assurance.    \"In full?\"    \"In full's what I said,\" murmured the unsuspecting philanthropist,  enjoying to the full his own magnanimity.    \"Well, sir,\" said Field, raising his voice without relaxing a muscle,  \"Is it not customary in Missouri when one gentleman pays another  gentleman in full to set up the wine?\"    George could scarcely respire for a moment, but gradually recovered  sufficiently to mumble, \"Gents, this is one on yours truly. What'll you  have?\"    And with one voice Field's cronies, who were witnesses to the scene,  ejaculated, \"Make it a case.\" And they made a night of it, such as  would have rejoiced the hearts of the joyous spirits of the \"Noctes  Ambrosianae.\"    From such revels and such fooling Field often went to work next day  without an hour's sleep.    While in Kansas City Field wrote that pathetic tale of misplaced  confidence that records the fate of \"Johnny Jones and his sister Sue.\"  It was entitled \"The Little Peach\" and has had a vogue fully as wide,  if not as sentimental, as \"Little Boy Blue.\" Field's own estimate of  this production is somewhat bluntly set out in the following note upon  a script copy of it made in 1887:    Originally printed in the Kansas City Times, recited publicly by Henry  E. Dixey, John A. Mackey, Sol Smith Russell, and almost every comedian  in America. Popular but rotten.    The last word is not only harsh but unjust. The variation of the  closing exclamation of each verse is as skilful as anything Field ever  did. Different, indeed, from the refrain in \"Wynken, Blynken and Nod,\"  but touching the chords of mirth with certainty and irresistible  effect. Field might have added, that none of the comedians he has named  ever gave to the experience of \"Johnny Jones and His Sister Sue\" in  public recitation the same melancholy humor and pathetic conclusion as  did the author of their misfortunes and untimely end himself. As a  penance, perhaps, for the injustice done to \"The Little Peach\" in the  quoted comment, Field spent several days in 1887 in translating it, so  to speak, into "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12985"],[0,"Eugene Field, a Study in Heredity and Contradictions — Volume 2 (#19)"],[1,"to Moffett asking him whether we ought to    locate the children in Paris or in Germany. You know that my means    are very limited, and my desire to do the right thing is necessarily    hampered. I met Colonel John C. Reid for the first time to-night    [Mr. Reid was Mr. Bennett's manager]. He is in favor of Paris, but    of course he does not understand how really d----d poor I am.      The children have done Tussaud's and the Zoo, and will next make a    descent on the Crystal Palace. They sincerely lament your absence    from the city. When we were in Liverpool, Pinny was joshing Daisy    because he had no money, and Daisy said: \"I'll be all right when I    see Mr. Cowen.\" It has pained all three boys because you fled from    their approach.    Five days later, having secured a sheet of deckle-edged, water-marked  Wilmot linen letter-paper and colored inks, Field proceeded to write  an elaborately decorated note to his friend:      20 ALFRED PLACE, BEDFORD SQ., LONDON, W.C.      MY DEAR COWEN: We have waited a week to hear from Moffett, whom I    addressed in care of the Herald office in Paris, but in lieu of any    answer we are going to start the children off for Hanover in a few    days. Mrs. Field is going to take them over, and I am to remain in    London, since travel disagrees with me so severely. I don't like the    idea of separation, but this seems to be a sacrifice which I ought    to make. I doubt very much whether I visit any other European city    except Paris; I am greatly pleased with London, every sight    awakening such a flood of reminiscence. If I were not so    disgracefully poor. I could pick up a host of charming knick-knacks    here; as it is, I have to shut my eyes and groan, and pass by on the    other side.      I have just finished \"Yvytot,\" the first purely fanciful ballad I    ever wrote. I have been at work on it for two months, and I think it    is the best piece of literary work I have done, although it is    somewhat above the class of work that is popular. You will like it    for its rhythmical smoothness and for its weirdness. But Mrs. Field    prefers \"Krinken,\" \"Marthy's Younkit,\" _et id omne genus_. My next    verse will be \"John Smith, U.S.A.,\" a poem suggested by seeing this    autograph at Gilley's. In it I shall use the Yankee, the Hoosier,    the southern and the western dialect, wondering whether this Smith    is the Smith I knew in Massachusetts, or the Smith from Louisville,    or the Smith from Terry Hut, or (last of all) the Smith from the Red    Hoss Mountain district. I wish you were here to help me throw my    ideas into shape. How do you like this handsome paper?      Affectionately,      EUGENE FIELD.    Tuesday, October 29th, 1889.    Field may have thought that he spent only two months on \"Yvytot,\" but  as a matter of fact he had been mulling it over for twice that many  years; and he had hoped to finish it in time for his \"Little Book of  Western Verse.\" But it was one of those bits of verse upon which he  loved to putter, and he was loath to put it into type beyond the reach  of occasional revision. When the \"Little Book of Western Verse\" was  issued in popular form \"Yvytot\" was included in it in the place of the  list of subscribers and John Wilson & Son's colophon. Speaking of the  Hoosier dialect, Field was fond of telling the following story on his  friend James Whitcomb Riley:      James Whitcomb Riley went to Europe last summer. On the return    voyage an incident happened which is well worth telling of. To    beguile the tediousness of the voyage it was proposed to give a    concert in the saloon of the ship--an entertainment to which all    capable of amusing their fellow-voyagers should contribute. Mr.    Riley was asked to recite some of his original poems, and of course    he cheerfully agreed to do so. Among the number present at this    mid-ocean entertainment, over which the Rev. Myron Reed presided,    were two Scotchmen, very worthy gentlemen, _en route_ from the land    o' cakes to the land of biscuits upon a tour of investigation. These    twain shared the enthusiasm with which the auditors applauded Mr.    Riley's charming recitations. They marvelled that so versatile a    genius could have lived in a land reputed for uncouthness and    savagery.      \"Is it no wonderfu', Donal',\" remarked one of these Scots, \"that a    tradesman suld be sic a bonnie poet?\"      \"And is he indeed a tradesman?\" asked the other.      \"Indeed he is,\" answered the other. \"Did ye no hear the dominie    intryjuce him as the hoosier poet? Just think of it, mon!--just    think of sic a gude poet dividing his time at making hoosiery?\"    There is more of the old spirit of the genuine Eugene Field in the  next letter, written from London, November 13th, 1889, than in any of  his other correspondence after 1888:      MY DEAR COWEN: I am now (so to speak) in God's hands. Getting the    four children fitted out for school and paying a quarter's tuition    in advance has reduced me to a condition of financial weakness which    fills me with the gloomiest apprehension. You of fertile resource    must tell me what I am to do. I will not steal; to beg I am ashamed.    My bank account shows L15. Verily, I am in hell's hole.      Had I received your letter in time I should have gone to Paris with    the children. Not a word have I heard from Moffett, and your letter    reached me after my return from Germany. Instinct all along has told    me \"Paris,\" but reason has counselled \"Germany.\" I have yielded to    reason, and the children are in Hanover--Trotty at the school of    Fraulein Gensen, Allee Strasse, No. 1, and the three boys with    Professor C. Ruehle (prophetic name!), Heinrich Strasse, 26 A.    Parting from them was like plucking my heart from me; but they are    contented. The night before they went to live with the professor,    Pinny and Daisy were plotting to \"do\" that worthy man, but I do not    fear for him, as he is a very husky gentleman. It seems the smart    thing now to keep the children at Hanover for six months; then, if a    change be deemed advisable, I shall take them to Paris.      My health appears to be better. I have written five poems, which are    highly commended. My books are out, and, though I have not clapped    eyes on them yet, they are being highly praised by the American    press. I shall see that you get copies. So far, we have been about    but very little. Our finances are too cramped to admit of our doing    or seeing much. But we may be happy yet. Julia joins me in    affectionate assurances.      Ever sincerely yours,      EUGENE FIELD.    Of a different tone, and yet giving very much the same impression of  how Field was spending his time in London, is the following letter to  his quondam guardian, Mr. Gray, beginning with an illuminated initial  V, of date London, January 9th, 1890:      Very many times during the last three months, dear Mr. Gray, have I    thought of you and yours, and upon several occasions have I been at    the point of sitting down and writing to you. There is perhaps no    one to whom letter-writing is as a practice--I had almost said    habit--more of a horror than it is to me. The conventional letter    seems to me to be a dreadful thing--twice dreadful (as Portia's    quality of mercy was twice blessed)--an affliction to the sender and    equally an affliction to the recipient. But you and I seldom write    letters of this kind. I do not think I ever before received a letter    that moved me so deeply as did the letter you sent me just before I    left Chicago. I am not ashamed to admit that I like to know that I    have your regard, but the whole tone of this letter was that of a    kindly affection which was very comforting to me, and for which I    shall always feel deeply grateful to you. My health has improved    much since I last wrote to you. I am now feeling quite as I felt    when I was in my original condition--perhaps I should say my normal    condition of original sin. For a week past I have been confined to    the house with a catarrhal cold, but aside from this temporary local    ailment my health is vastly better. I should be in the mood to    return home at once were it not for a sense that being here I should    further improve the opportunity to gather material that may be of    value to me in my work when I get back into the rut again.      I have a very great desire to go to Norway and the Orkney Islands    for a month in order to see those countries and their people, for I    am much interested in North of Europe romance, and I am ambitious to    write tales about the folk of those particular points. I think it    possible that I shall find a way to gratify this urgent desire    before returning to America, although with the children at school I    am hardly prepared just now to say what further sacrifice I shall be    able to make in order to achieve my project.      The children are in school at Hanover. Trotty is at the girls'    school of a Miss Julia Gensen, No. 1 Allee Strasse, and the three    boys are with Prof. C. Ruehle, No. 26 Heinrich Strasse. I give the    exact localities, for the reason that Mrs. Gray may kindly take the    notion one of these days to write to the little exiles. The children    are healthy and happy; we have not seen them for nine weeks, but we    hear from them every week, and we are assured that they are making    desirable progress. In her last letter Trotty says, with a _naivete_    that is simply electric: \"Nobody would guess that the boys were your    boys--they are so gentlemanly!\" Prof. Ruehle is an old instructor of    boys, and for several years he was a professor at Woolwich    Academy.... Pinny is acquiring the German so rapidly that he is    accounted quite a marvel by his instructor and his associates.    Melvin and Trotty are not so quick; they progress slowly, but Daisy    seems to be doing admirably. Hanover is a"]]]
