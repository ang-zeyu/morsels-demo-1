[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/130"],[0,"Orthodoxy (#19)"],[1,"accounts of the faith, from Huxley to Bradlaugh,  a slow and awful impression grew gradually but graphically  upon my mind--the impression that Christianity must be a most  extraordinary thing.  For not only (as I understood) had Christianity  the most flaming vices, but it had apparently a mystical talent  for combining vices which seemed inconsistent with each other.  It was attacked on all sides and for all contradictory reasons.  No sooner had one rationalist demonstrated that it was too far  to the east than another demonstrated with equal clearness that it  was much too far to the west.  No sooner had my indignation died  down at its angular and aggressive squareness than I was called up  again to notice and condemn its enervating and sensual roundness.  In case any reader has not come across the thing I mean, I will give  such instances as I remember at random of this self-contradiction  in the sceptical attack.  I give four or five of them; there are  fifty more.         Thus, for instance, I was much moved by the eloquent attack  on Christianity as a thing of inhuman gloom; for I thought  (and still think) sincere pessimism the unpardonable sin.  Insincere pessimism is a social accomplishment, rather agreeable  than otherwise; and fortunately nearly all pessimism is insincere.  But if Christianity was, as these people said, a thing purely  pessimistic and opposed to life, then I was quite prepared to blow  up St. Paul's Cathedral.  But the extraordinary thing is this.  They did prove to me in Chapter I. (to my complete satisfaction)  that Christianity was too pessimistic; and then, in Chapter II.,  they began to prove to me that it was a great deal too optimistic.  One accusation against Christianity was that it prevented men,  by morbid tears and terrors, from seeking joy and liberty in the bosom  of Nature.  But another accusation was that it comforted men with a  fictitious providence, and put them in a pink-and-white nursery.  One great agnostic asked why Nature was not beautiful enough,  and why it was hard to be free.  Another great agnostic objected  that Christian optimism, \"the garment of make-believe woven by  pious hands,\" hid from us the fact that Nature was ugly, and that  it was impossible to be free.  One rationalist had hardly done  calling Christianity a nightmare before another began to call it  a fool's paradise.  This puzzled me; the charges seemed inconsistent.  Christianity could not at once be the black mask on a white world,  and also the white mask on a black world.  The state of the Christian  could not be at once so comfortable that he was a coward to cling  to it, and so uncomfortable that he was a fool to stand it.  If it falsified human vision it must falsify it one way or another;  it could not wear both green and rose-coloured spectacles.  I rolled on my tongue with a terrible joy, as did all young men  of that time, the taunts which Swinburne hurled at the dreariness of  the creed--         \"Thou hast conquered, O pale Galilaean, the world has grown  gray with Thy breath.\"    But when I read the same poet's accounts of paganism (as  in \"Atalanta\"), I gathered that the world was, if possible,  more gray before the Galilean breathed on it than afterwards.  The poet maintained, indeed, in the abstract, that life itself  was pitch dark.  And yet, somehow, Christianity had darkened it.  The very man who denounced Christianity for pessimism was himself  a pessimist.  I thought there must be something wrong.  And it did  for one wild moment cross my mind that, perhaps, those might not be  the very best judges of the relation of religion to happiness who,  by their own account, had neither one nor the other.         It must be understood that I did not conclude hastily that the  accusations were false or the accusers fools.  I simply deduced  that Christianity must be something even weirder and wickeder  than they made out.  A thing might have these two opposite vices;  but it must be a rather queer thing if it did.  A man might be too fat  in one place and too thin in another; but he would be an odd shape.  At this point my thoughts were only of the odd shape of the Christian  religion; I did not allege any odd shape in the rationalistic mind.         Here is another case of the same kind.  I felt that a strong  case against Christianity lay in the charge that there is something  timid, monkish, and unmanly about all that is called \"Christian,\"  especially in its attitude towards resistance and fighting.  The great sceptics of the nineteenth century were largely virile.  Bradlaugh in an expansive way, Huxley, in a reticent way,  were decidedly men.  In comparison, it did seem tenable that there  was something weak and over patient about Christian counsels.  The Gospel paradox about the other cheek, the fact that priests  never fought, a hundred things made plausible the accusation  that Christianity was an attempt to make a man too like a sheep.  I read it and believed it, and if I had read nothing different,  I should have gone on believing it.  But I read something very different.  I turned the next page in my agnostic manual, and my brain turned  up-side down.  Now I found that I was to hate Christianity not for  fighting too little, but for fighting too much.  Christianity, it seemed,  was the mother of wars.  Christianity had deluged the world with blood.  I had got thoroughly angry with the Christian, because he never  was angry.  And now I was told to be angry with him because his  anger had been the most huge and horrible thing in human history;  because his anger had soaked the earth and smoked to the sun.  The very people who reproached Christianity with the meekness and  non-resistance of the monasteries were the very people who reproached  it also with the violence and valour of the Crusades.  It was the  fault of poor old Christianity (somehow or other) both that Edward  the Confessor did not fight and that Richard Coeur de Leon did.  The Quakers (we were told) were the only characteristic Christians;  and yet the massacres of Cromwell and Alva were characteristic  Christian crimes.  What could it all mean?  What was this Christianity  which always forbade war and always produced wars?  What could  be the nature of the thing which one could abuse first because it  would not fight, and second because it was always fighting?  In what world of riddles was born this monstrous murder and this  monstrous meekness?  The shape of Christianity grew a queerer shape  every instant.         I take a third case; the strangest of all, because it involves  the one real objection to the faith.  The one real objection to the  Christian religion is simply that it is one religion.  The world is  a big place, full of very different kinds of people.  Christianity (it  may reasonably be said) is one thing confined to one kind of people;  it began in Palestine, it has practically stopped with Europe.  I was duly impressed with this argument in my youth, and I was much  drawn towards the doctrine often preached in Ethical Societies--  I mean the doctrine that there is one great unconscious church of  all humanity founded on the omnipresence of the human conscience.  Creeds, it was said, divided men; but at least morals united them.  The soul might seek the strangest and most remote lands and ages  and still find essential ethical common sense.  It might find  Confucius under Eastern trees, and he would be writing \"Thou  shalt not steal.\"  It might decipher the darkest hieroglyphic on  the most primeval desert, and the meaning when deciphered would  be \"Little boys should tell the truth.\"  I believed this doctrine  of the brotherhood of all men in the possession of a moral sense,  and I believe it still--with other things.  And I was thoroughly  annoyed with Christianity for suggesting (as I supposed)  that whole ages and empires of men had utterly escaped this light  of justice and reason.  But then I found an astonishing thing.  I found that the very people who said that mankind was one church  from Plato to Emerson were the very people who said that morality  had changed altogether, and that what was right in one age was wrong  in another.  If I asked, say, for an altar, I was told that we  needed none, for men our brothers gave us clear oracles and one creed  in their universal customs and ideals.  But if I mildly pointed  out that one of men's universal customs was to have an altar,  then my agnostic teachers turned clean round and told me that men  had always been in darkness and the superstitions of savages.  I found it was their daily taunt against Christianity that it was  the light of one people and had left all others to die in the dark.  But I also found that it was their special boast for themselves  that science and progress were the discovery of one people,  and that all other peoples had died in the dark.  Their chief insult  to Christianity was actually their chief compliment to themselves,  and there seemed to be a strange unfairness about all their relative  insistence on the two things.  When considering some pagan or agnostic,  we were to remember that all men had one religion; when considering  some mystic or spiritualist, we were only to consider what absurd  religions some men had.  We could trust the ethics of Epictetus,  because ethics had never changed.  We must not trust the ethics  of Bossuet, because ethics had changed.  They changed in two  hundred years, but not in two thousand.         This began to be alarming.  It looked not so much as if  Christianity was bad enough to include any vices, but rather  as if any stick was good enough to beat Christianity with.  What again could this astonishing thing be like which people  were so anxious to contradict, that in doing so they did not mind  contradicting themselves?  I saw the same thing on every side.  I can give no further space to this discussion of it in detail;  but lest any one supposes that I "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1300"],[0,"Riders of the Purple Sage (#19)"],[1," sorrel could not be gotten  into Surprise Valley. He would have to be left here.    Venters determined at once to lead the other horses out through the  thicket and turn them loose. The farther they wandered from this canyon  the better it would suit him. He easily descried Wrangle through the  gloom, but the others were not in sight. Venters whistled low for the  dogs, and when they came trotting to him he sent them out to search for  the horses, and followed. It soon developed that they were not in the  glade nor the thicket. Venters grew cold and rigid at the thought of  rustlers having entered his retreat. But the thought passed, for the  demeanor of Ring and Whitie reassured him. The horses had wandered away.    Under the clump of silver spruces a denser mantle of darkness, yet not  so thick that Venter's night-practiced eyes could not catch the white  oval of a still face. He bent over it with a slight suspension of breath  that was both caution lest he frighten her and chill uncertainty of  feeling lest he find her dead. But she slept, and he arose to renewed  activity.    He packed his saddle-bags. The dogs were hungry, they whined about  him and nosed his busy hands; but he took no time to feed them nor to  satisfy his own hunger. He slung the saddlebags over his shoulders and  made them secure with his lasso. Then he wrapped the blankets closer  about the girl and lifted her in his arms. Wrangle whinnied and thumped  the ground as Venters passed him with the dogs. The sorrel knew he was  being left behind, and was not sure whether he liked it or not. Venters  went on and entered the thicket. Here he had to feel his way in pitch  blackness and to wedge his progress between the close saplings. Time  meant little to him now that he had started, and he edged along with  slow side movement till he got clear of the thicket. Ring and Whitie  stood waiting for him. Taking to the open aisles and patches of the  sage, he walked guardedly, careful not to stumble or step in dust or  strike against spreading sage-branches.    If he were burdened he did not feel it. From time to time, when he  passed out of the black lines of shade into the wan starlight, he  glanced at the white face of the girl lying in his arms. She had not  awakened from her sleep or stupor. He did not rest until he cleared the  black gate of the canyon. Then he leaned against a stone breast-high to  him and gently released the girl from his hold. His brow and hair  and the palms of his hands were wet, and there was a kind of nervous  contraction of his muscles. They seemed to ripple and string tense. He  had a desire to hurry and no sense of fatigue. A wind blew the scent  of sage in his face. The first early blackness of night passed with the  brightening of the stars. Somewhere back on his trail a coyote yelped,  splitting the dead silence. Venters's faculties seemed singularly acute.    He lifted the girl again and pressed on. The valley better traveling  than the canyon. It was lighter, freer of sage, and there were no rocks.  Soon, out of the pale gloom shone a still paler thing, and that was the  low swell of slope. Venters mounted it and his dogs walked beside him.  Once upon the stone he slowed to snail pace, straining his sight to  avoid the pockets and holes. Foot by foot he went up. The weird cedars,  like great demons and witches chained to the rock and writhing in silent  anguish, loomed up with wide and twisting naked arms. Venters crossed  this belt of cedars, skirted the upper border, and recognized the tree  he had marked, even before he saw his waving scarf.    Here he knelt and deposited the girl gently, feet first and slowly laid  her out full length. What he feared was to reopen one of her wounds.  If he gave her a violent jar, or slipped and fell! But the supreme  confidence so strangely felt that night admitted no such blunders.    The slope before him seemed to swell into obscurity to lose its definite  outline in a misty, opaque cloud that shaded into the over-shadowing  wall. He scanned the rim where the serrated points speared the sky, and  he found the zigzag crack. It was dim, only a shade lighter than the  dark ramparts, but he distinguished it, and that served.    Lifting the girl, he stepped upward, closely attending to the nature of  the path under his feet. After a few steps he stopped to mark his line  with the crack in the rim. The dogs clung closer to him. While chasing  the rabbit this slope had appeared interminable to him; now, burdened as  he was, he did not think of length or height or toil. He remembered  only to avoid a misstep and to keep his direction. He climbed on, with  frequent stops to watch the rim, and before he dreamed of gaining the  bench he bumped his knees into it, and saw, in the dim gray light, his  rifle and the rabbit. He had come straight up without mishap or swerving  off his course, and his shut teeth unlocked.    As he laid the girl down in the shallow hollow of the little ridge with  her white face upturned, she opened her eyes. Wide, staring black, at  once like both the night and the stars, they made her face seem still  whiter.    \"Is--it--you?\" she asked, faintly.    \"Yes,\" replied Venters.    \"Oh! Where--are we?\"    \"I'm taking you to a safe place where no one will ever find you. I must  climb a little here and call the dogs. Don't be afraid. I'll soon come  for you.\"    She said no more. Her eyes watched him steadily for a moment and then  closed. Venters pulled off his boots and then felt for the little steps  in the rock. The shade of the cliff above obscured the point he wanted  to gain, but he could see dimly a few feet before him. What he had  attempted with care he now went at with surpassing lightness. Buoyant,  rapid, sure, he attained the corner of wall and slipped around it. Here  he could not see a hand before his face, so he groped along, found a  little flat space, and there removed the saddle-bags. The lasso he took  back with him to the corner and looped the noose over the spur of rock.    \"Ring--Whitie--come,\" he called, softly.    Low whines came up from below.    \"Here! Come, Whitie--Ring,\" he repeated, this time sharply.    Then followed scraping of claws and pattering of feet; and out of the  gray gloom below him swiftly climbed the dogs to reach his side and pass  beyond.    Venters descended, holding to the lasso. He tested its strength by  throwing all his weight upon it. Then he gathered the girl up, and,  holding her securely in his left arm, he began to climb, at every few  steps jerking his right hand upward along the lasso. It sagged at each  forward movement he made, but he balanced himself lightly during the  interval when he lacked the support of a taut rope. He climbed as if he  had wings, the strength of a giant, and knew not the sense of fear. The  sharp corner of cliff seemed to cut out of the darkness. He reached  it and the protruding shelf, and then, entering the black shade of the  notch, he moved blindly but surely to the place where he had left the  saddle-bags. He heard the dogs, though he could not see them. Once more  he carefully placed the girl at his feet. Then, on hands and knees,  he went over the little flat space, feeling for stones. He removed a  number, and, scraping the deep dust into a heap, he unfolded the outer  blanket from around the girl and laid her upon this bed. Then he went  down the slope again for his boots, rifle, and the rabbit, and, bringing  also his lasso with him, he made short work of that trip.    \"Are--you--there?\" The girl's voice came low from the blackness.    \"Yes,\" he replied, and was conscious that his laboring breast made  speech difficult.    \"Are we--in a cave?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Oh, listen!... The waterfall!... I hear it! You've brought me back!\"    Venters heard a murmuring moan that one moment swelled to a pitch almost  softly shrill and the next lulled to a low, almost inaudible sigh.    \"That's--wind blowing--in the--cliffs,\" he panted. \"You're far from  Oldring's--canyon.\"    The effort it cost him to speak made him conscious of extreme lassitude  following upon great exertion. It seemed that when he lay down and drew  his blanket over him the action was the last before utter prostration.  He stretched inert, wet, hot, his body one great strife of throbbing,  stinging nerves and bursting veins. And there he lay for a long while  before he felt that he had begun to rest.    Rest came to him that night, but no sleep. Sleep he did not want. The  hours of strained effort were now as if they had never been, and he  wanted to think. Earlier in the day he had dismissed an inexplicable  feeling of change; but now, when there was no longer demand on his  cunning and strength and he had time to think, he could not catch the  illusive thing that had sadly perplexed as well as elevated his spirit.    Above him, through a V-shaped cleft in the dark rim of the cliff, shone  the lustrous stars that had been his lonely accusers for a long, long  year. To-night they were different. He studied them. Larger, whiter,  more radiant they seemed; but that was not the difference he meant.  Gradually it came to him that the distinction was not one he saw, but  one he felt. In this he divined as much of the baffling change as he  thought would be revealed to him then. And as he lay there, with the  singing of the cliff-winds in his ears, the white stars above the dark,  bold vent, the difference which he felt was that he was no longer alone.        CHAPTER IX. SILVER SPRUCE AND ASPENS    The rest of that night seemed to Venters only a few moments of  starlight, a dark overcasting of sky, an hour or so of gray gloom, and  then the lighting of dawn.    When he had bestirred himself, feeding the hungry dogs and breaking  his long fast, and had repacked his saddle-bags, it was clear daylight,  though the sun had not tipped the yellow wall in the east. He concluded  to make the climb and descent into Surprise"]]]
