Similar marvels were told in the Midrash, of travellers like Father  Jacob, and in the lives of Christian saints.    But the Jew had a real means of shortening the way--by profitable and  edifying conversation. \"Do not travel with an Am ha-Arez,\" the olden Rabbis  advised. Such a one, they held, was careless of his own safety, and would  hardly be more careful of his companion's life. But, besides, an Am  ha-Arez, using the word in its later sense of ignoramus, would be too dull  for edifying conversation, and one might as well or as ill journey alone as  with a boor. But \"thou shalt speak of them by the way,\" says Deuteronomy of  the commandments, and this (to say nothing of the danger) was one of the  reasons why solitary travelling was disapproved. A man walking alone was  more likely to turn his mind to idle thoughts, than if he had a congenial  partner to converse with, and the Mishnah is severe against him who turns  aside from his peripatetic study to admire a tree or a fallow. This does  not imply that the Jews were indifferent to the beauties of nature. Jewish  travellers often describe the scenery of the parts they visit, and  Petachiah literally revels in the beautiful gardens of Persia, which he  paints in vivid colors. Then, again, few better descriptions of a storm at  sea have been written than those composed by Jehudah Halevi on his fatal  voyage to Palestine. Similarly, Charizi, another Jewish wayfarer, who  laughed himself over half the world, wrote verses as he walked, to relieve  the tedium. He is perhaps the most entertaining of all Jewish travellers.  Nothing is more amusing than his conscious habit of judging the characters  of the men he saw by their hospitality, or the reverse, to himself. A more  serious traveller, Maimonides, must have done a good deal of thinking on  horseback, to get through his ordinary day's work and write his great  books. In fact, he himself informs us that he composed part of his  Commentary to the Mishnah while journeying by land and sea. In Europe, the  Rabbis often had several neighboring congregations under their care, and on  their journeys to and fro took their books with them, and read in them at  intervals. Maharil, on such journeys, always took note of the Jewish  customs observed in different localities. He was also a most skilful and  successful Shadchan, or marriage-broker, and his extensive travels placed  this famous Rabbi in an excellent position for match-making. Certainly, the  marriages he effected were notoriously prosperous, and in his hands the  Shadchan system did the most good and the least harm of which it is  capable.    Another type of short-distance traveller was the Bachur, or student. Not  that his journeys were always short, but he rarely crossed the sea. In the  second century we find Jewish students in Galilee behaving as many Scotch  youths did before the days of Carnegie funds. These students would study in  Sepphoris in the winter, and work in the fields in summer. After the  impoverishment caused by the Bar-Cochba war, the students were glad to dine  at the table of the wealthy Patriarch Judah I. In the medieval period there  were also such. These Bachurim, who, young as they were, were often  married, accomplished enormous journeys on foot. They walked from the Rhine  to Vienna, and from North Germany to Italy. Their privations on the road  were indescribable. Bad weather was naturally a severe trial. \"Hearken not  to the prayers of wayfarers,\" was the petition of those who stayed at home.  This quaint Talmudic saying refers to the selfishness of travellers, who  always clamor for fine weather, though the farmer needs rain. Apart from  the weather, the Bachurim suffered much on the road. Their ordinary food  was raw vegetables culled from the fields; they drank nothing but water.  They were often accompanied by their teachers, who underwent the same  privations. Unlike their Talmudical precursors, they travelled much by  night, because it was safer, and also because they reserved the daylight  for study. The dietary laws make Jewish travelling particularly irksome. We  do, indeed, find Jews lodging at the ordinary inns, but they could not join  the general company at the _table d'hote_. The Sabbath, too, was the cause  of some discomfort, though the traveller always exerted his utmost efforts  to reach a Jewish congregation by Friday evening, sometimes, as we have  seen, with supernatural aid.    We must interrupt this account of the Bachur to record a much earlier  instance of the awkward situation in which a pious Jewish traveller might  find himself because of the Sabbath regulations. In the very last year of  the fourth century, Synesius, of Cyrene, writing to his brother of his  voyage from Alexandria to Constantinople, supplies us with a quaint  instance of the manner in which the Sabbath affected Jewish travellers.  Synesius uses a sarcastic tone, which must not be taken as seriously  unfriendly. \"His voyage homeward,\" says Mr. Glover, \"was adventurous.\" It  is a pity that space cannot be found for a full citation of Synesius's  enthralling narrative. His Jewish steersman is an entertaining character.  There were twelve members in the crew, the steersman making the thirteenth.  More than half, including the steersman, were Jews. \"It was,\" says  Synesius, \"the day which the Jews call the Preparation [Friday], and they  reckon the night to the next day, on which they are not allowed to do any  work, but they pay it especial honor, and rest on it. So the steersman let  go the helm from his hands, when he thought the sun would have set on the  land, and threw himself down, and 'What mariner should choose might trample  him!' We did not at first understand the real reason, but took it for  despair, and went to him and besought him not to give up all hope yet. For  in plain fact the big rollers still kept on, and the sea was at issue with  itself. It does this when the wind falls, and the waves it has set going do  not fall with it, but, still retaining in full force the impulse that  started them, meet the onset of the gale, and to its front oppose their  own. Well, when people are sailing in such circumstances, life hangs, as  they say, by a slender thread. But if the steersman is a Rabbi into the  bargain, what are one's feelings? When, then, we understood what he meant  in leaving the helm,--for when we begged him to save the ship from danger,  he went on reading his book,--we despaired of persuasion, and tried force.  And a gallant soldier (for we have with us a good few Arabians, who belong  to the cavalry) drew his sword, and threatened to cut his head off, if he  would not steer the ship. But in a moment he was a genuine Maccabee, and  would stick to his dogma. Yet when it was now midnight, he took his place  of his own accord, 'for now,' says he, 'the law allows me, as we are  clearly in danger of our lives.' At that the tumult begins again, moaning  of men and screaming of women. Everybody began calling on Heaven, and  wailing and remembering their dear ones. Amarantus alone was cheerful,  thinking he was on the point of ruling out his creditors.\" Amarantus was  the captain, who wished to die, because he was deep in debt. What with the  devil-may-care captain, the Maccabean steersman, and the critical onlooker,  who was a devoted admirer of Hypatia, rarely has wayfaring been conducted  under more delightful conditions. As is often the case in life, the humors  of the scene almost obscure the fact that the lives of the actors were in  real danger. But all ended well. \"As for us,\" says Synesius further on, \"as  soon as we reached the land we longed for, we embraced it as if it had been  a living mother. Offering, as usual, a hymn of gratitude to God, I added to  it the recent misadventure from which we had unexpectedly been saved.\"    To return to our travelling Bachur of later centuries than Synesius's  Rabbi-steersman. On the road, the student was often attacked, but, as  happened with the son of the great Asheri, who was waylaid by bandits near  Toledo, the robbers did not always get the best of the fight. The Bachur  could take his own part. One Jew gained much notoriety in 801 by conducting  an elephant all the way from Haroun al-Rashid's court as a present to  Charlemagne, the king of the Franks. But the Rabbi suffered considerably  from his religion on his journeys. Dr. Schechter tells us how the Gaon  Elijah got out of his carriage to say his prayer, and, as the driver knew  that the Rabbi would not interrupt his devotions, he promptly made off,  carrying away the Gaon's property.    But the account was not all on one side. If the Bachur suffered for his  religion, he received ample compensation. When he arrived at his  destination, he was welcomed right heartily. We read how cordially the  Sheliach Kolel was received in Algiers in the fifteenth to eighteenth  centuries. It was a great popular event, as is nowadays the visit of the  _Alliance_ inspector. This was not the case with all Jewish travellers,  some of whom received a very cold shoulder from their brethren. Why was  this? Chiefly because the Jews, as little as the rest of medieval peoples,  realized that progress and enlightenment are indissolubly bound up with the  right of free movement. They regarded the right to move here and there at  will as a selfish privilege of the few, not the just right of all. But more  than that. The Jews were forced to live in special and limited Ghettos. It  was not easy to find room for newcomers. When a crisis arrived, such as the  expulsion of the Jews from Spain, then, except here and there, the Jews  were generous to a fault in providing for the exiles. Societies all over  the Continent and round the coast of the Mediterranean spent their time and  money in ransoming the poor victims, who, driven from Spain, were enslaved  by the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9897"],[0,"Introductory American History (#18)"],[1,"the men of the Renaissance learn      about the Greeks and the Romans?        [Illustration: HUSBANDMAN AND COUNTRY WOMAN OF FIFTEENTH      CENTURY]        CHAPTER XIII      TRADERS, TRAVELERS, AND EXPLORERS IN THE LATER MIDDLE AGES    THE PERILS OF TRADERS. There was a time in the Middle Ages when    merchants scarcely dared to travel from one town to another for fear of    being plundered by some robber lord or common thief. If they traveled by    sea they might also be attacked by robbers. Some of these robbers, like    the Northmen, came from afar, but others were ordinary sailors who put    out from near-by ports when there seemed nothing better to do.      This state of things gradually changed. The kings or great lords    succeeded in protecting merchants on land, and the merchants armed    vessels of their own to drive the pirates from the sea. As trade grew    greater the towns became richer and stronger and the robbers and pirates    fewer, so that the number of merchant ships increased rapidly and long    voyages were attempted.    FAIRS. At first trade was carried on at great fairs, held in places    convenient for the merchants of England and western Europe. The fairs    lasted about six weeks, and one fair followed another. As soon as the    first was over the merchants packed their unsold wares and journeyed to    the next. At the fairs were found drugs and spices, cottons and silks    from the East, skins and furs from the North, wool from England, and    other products from Germany, Italy, France, and Spain.    THE TREASURES OF THE EAST. Men in the Middle Ages were dependent    for luxuries upon the lands of Asia which are commonly called the East.    By this name we may mean Persia, Arabia, India, China, or the Molucca    Islands, where the choicest spices still grow. Spices were a great    luxury, and were needed to flavor the food, because the manner of    cooking was poor and there was little variety in the kinds of food. Most    of the cotton cloth, the silks, the drugs, and the dyes were also    procured from the East.      [Illustration: TRADER'S CARAVAN CROSSING THE DESERT]    ROUTES TO THE EAST. No one knew that it was possible to reach Asia    by sailing around the southern point of Africa or through what is called    the Strait of Magellan. The products of the East were brought to Europe    by several routes, two reaching the Mediterranean at Alexandria, in    Egypt, a third at Antioch, in Syria, and a fourth on the southeastern    shore of the Black Sea.      The loads were carried by camels in long caravans across the deserts    from the Red Sea, or the Persian Gulf, or from northern India. Ships    from the Italian cities of Genoa, Pisa, and Venice struggled with one    another for the right to bring back these precious wares and sell them    to the merchants of Europe, who were ready to pay high prices.      [Illustration: MAP OF THE TRADE ROUTES IN THE MIDDLE AGES]    VENETIAN TRADERS. Merchants from Germany came to Venice to trade    the products of the North for spices, drugs, dyes, and silks, which they    carried back across the Alps. Once a year the Venetians sent a fleet of    vessels westward through the straits of Gibraltar and along the Atlantic    shore as far as Bruges and London. The voyage was long and dangerous,    and the Venetians traded in ports on the way. Spices in Bruges sold for    two or three times what they cost in Venice.    THE CRUSADES. One event that brought to the Venetians an    opportunity to enrich themselves was the Crusades. The Mohammedans had    long held a large part of Spain, and towards the end of the eleventh    century they threatened France and Italy. They also attacked what was    left of the Roman Empire in the East, and the emperors sent to the pope    and the western kings frantic appeals for help. Thousands of Frenchmen,    Germans, Englishmen, and Italians were suddenly seized with the desire    to go to Palestine and drive the Mohammedans from Jerusalem, the Holy    City, and from the tomb of Christ. For the next two centuries large    armies were sent there, sometimes gaining victories, sometimes being    defeated in battle or overcome by disease.    WHAT THE VENETIANS GAINED FROM THE CRUSADES. Most of the Crusaders    went to the Holy Land by sea, and when they had no ships of their own    they often took passage in Venetian ships. The Venetians asked large    sums for this, and also succeeded in obtaining all the rights of trade    in many of the seaports which were captured. Sometimes the Venetians    undertook to govern islands like Cyprus and Crete, or territories along    the coasts, but their main aim was to increase their trade rather than    to build up an empire.      THE NEW VENETIAN SHIPS. The Crusaders who returned to Europe brought    back a liking for the luxuries of the East, and their tales made other    men eager for them. For this reason more ships were built to sail in the    Mediterranean. The shipowners attempted to make their ships larger and    stronger. They were larger than those built by the English or by other    peoples along the Atlantic coast, but they would seem small to us. There    is an account of Venetian ships in the thirteenth century which tells us    that they were one hundred and ten feet long and carried crews of one    thousand men. They relied mainly upon the use of oars, but had a mast,    sometimes two masts, rigged with sails, which they could use if the wind    was favorable.      [Illustration: VENETIAN SHIPS]    DANGERS OF THE SEA. One difficulty about sailing was the lack of    any means in cloudy weather, and especially at night, of telling the    direction in which they were going. The sailors did not like to venture    far from shore, although the open sea is safer during a storm than a    wind-swept and rocky coast. At the time when the sailors of the    Mediterranean were building up their trade to Alexandria, Antioch, and    the Black Sea, two instruments came into use which enabled them to tell    just where they were.    THE COMPASS. One of these instruments was the compass, which the    Chinese had long used, and which was known to the Arabs before the    Europeans heard of it. If a boy will take a needle, rub its point with a    magnet, and lay the needle on a cork floating in water, he will have a    rough sort of compass. The point of the needle wherever it may be turned    will swing back towards the north, thus guiding the sailors.      [Illustration: MARINER'S COMPASS]      The compass was known in Europe about 1200. There is a story that at    first sailors thought its action due to magic and refused to sail under    a captain who used it. But a century later it was in general use, and    had been so much improved that even in the severest storms the needle    remained level and pointed steadily towards the north.      [Illustration: AN ASTROLABE]    THE ASTROLABE. The other instrument, called the astrolabe, was a    brass circle marked off into 360 degrees. To this circle were fastened    two movable bars, at the ends of which were sights, or projecting pieces    pierced by a hole. The astrolabe was hung on a mast in such a way that    one bar was horizontal and the other could be moved until through its    sights some known star could be seen. The number of degrees marked on    the circle between the two bars told how high the star was above the    horizon, and the sailors could reckon the latitude of the place where    they were. In a similar way their longitude could be found out.      The astrolabe was not so useful as the compass, for it could be used    only on clear days or nights. With these two instruments it was possible    to sail far out into the Atlantic. By the middle of the fourteenth    century ships from Genoa and Portugal had visited the Madeira and the    Canary Islands, and even the Azores which are a thousand miles from    the mainland.    WHAT MEN THOUGHT ABOUT A SEA ROUTE TO THE EAST. Men learned more    about other strange lands through a Venetian traveler, Marco Polo, who    wrote an account of his wonderful journey to the court of the Grand    Khan, or Emperor of the Mongols, of his travels through China, and of    his return to Persia by sea.      Many men in the Middle Ages had believed that east of Asia was a great    marsh, and that because of it even if they succeeded in sailing around    Africa it would be impossible to reach the region of the spices and    silks and jewels which they so much desired. They also thought that the    heat in the tropics was so intense that at a certain distance down the    coast of Africa they would find the water of the ocean boiling. These    things and the tales of strange monsters that inhabited the deep sea had    terrified them. The news which Marco Polo brought changed this feeling.    THE MONGOLS. The way Marco Polo happened to visit the court of the    Mongol emperor was this. The Mongol Tartars were great conquerors, and    they not only subdued the Chinese but marched westward, overrunning most    of Russia and stopping only when they were on the frontiers of Italy.    For a long time southern Russia remained under their rule. Their capital    was just north of the Great Wall of China.      The Mongol emperor did not hate Europeans, and even sent to the pope for    missionaries to teach his people. Marco Polo's father and uncle while on    a trading expedition had found their way to his court, and on a second    journey, in 1271, they took with them Marco, a lad of seventeen years.    The emperor was much interested in his western visitors and took young    Marco into his service.
