In this detailed and consistent form, the theory, outside of a small  school in Germany (followers of Herbart for the most part), has had  little currency. But the idea which underlies it is that education  is essentially retrospective; that it looks primarily to the past  and especially to the literary products of the past, and that mind  is adequately formed in the degree in which it is patterned upon the  spiritual heritage of the past. This idea has had such immense influence  upon higher instruction especially, that it is worth examination in its  extreme formulation.    In the first place, its biological basis is fallacious. Embyronic growth  of the human infant preserves, without doubt, some of the traits of  lower forms of life. But in no respect is it a strict traversing of  past stages. If there were any strict \"law\" of repetition, evolutionary  development would clearly not have taken place. Each new generation  would simply have repeated its predecessors' existence. Development, in  short, has taken place by the entrance of shortcuts and alterations in  the prior scheme of growth. And this suggests that the aim of education  is to facilitate such short-circuited growth. The great advantage of  immaturity, educationally speaking, is that it enables us to emancipate  the young from the need of dwelling in an outgrown past. The business of  education is rather to liberate the young from reviving and retraversing  the past than to lead them to a recapitulation of it. The social  environment of the young is constituted by the presence and action  of the habits of thinking and feeling of civilized men. To ignore the  directive influence of this present environment upon the young is simply  to abdicate the educational function. A biologist has said: \"The history  of development in different animals. . . offers to us. . . a series of  ingenious, determined, varied but more or less unsuccessful efforts to  escape from the necessity of recapitulating, and to substitute for the  ancestral method a more direct method.\" Surely it would be foolish if  education did not deliberately attempt to facilitate similar efforts in  conscious experience so that they become increasingly successful.    The two factors of truth in the conception may easily be disentangled  from association with the false context which perverts them. On the  biological side we have simply the fact that any infant starts with  precisely the assortment of impulsive activities with which he does  start, they being blind, and many of them conflicting with one another,  casual, sporadic, and unadapted to their immediate environment. The  other point is that it is a part of wisdom to utilize the products  of past history so far as they are of help for the future. Since they  represent the results of prior experience, their value for future  experience may, of course, be indefinitely great. Literatures produced  in the past are, so far as men are now in possession and use of them, a  part of the present environment of individuals; but there is an enormous  difference between availing ourselves of them as present resources and  taking them as standards and patterns in their retrospective character.    (1) The distortion of the first point usually comes about through misuse  of the idea of heredity. It is assumed that heredity means that past  life has somehow predetermined the main traits of an individual, and  that they are so fixed that little serious change can be introduced into  them. Thus taken, the influence of heredity is opposed to that of  the environment, and the efficacy of the latter belittled. But for  educational purposes heredity means neither more nor less than the  original endowment of an individual. Education must take the being as he  is; that a particular individual has just such and such an equipment of  native activities is a basic fact. That they were produced in such  and such a way, or that they are derived from one's ancestry, is not  especially important for the educator, however it may be with the  biologist, as compared with the fact that they now exist. Suppose one  had to advise or direct a person regarding his inheritance of  property. The fallacy of assuming that the fact it is an inheritance,  predetermines its future use, is obvious. The advisor is concerned with  making the best use of what is there--putting it at work under the most  favorable conditions. Obviously he cannot utilize what is not there;  neither can the educator. In this sense, heredity is a limit of  education. Recognition of this fact prevents the waste of energy and the  irritation that ensue from the too prevalent habit of trying to make  by instruction something out of an individual which he is not naturally  fitted to become. But the doctrine does not determine what use shall  be made of the capacities which exist. And, except in the case of the  imbecile, these original capacities are much more varied and potential,  even in the case of the more stupid, than we as yet know properly how to  utilize. Consequently, while a careful study of the native aptitudes  and deficiencies of an individual is always a preliminary necessity, the  subsequent and important step is to furnish an environment which will  adequately function whatever activities are present. The relation of  heredity and environment is well expressed in the case of language. If a  being had no vocal organs from which issue articulate sounds, if he had  no auditory or other sense-receptors and no connections between the two  sets of apparatus, it would be a sheer waste of time to try to teach him  to converse. He is born short in that respect, and education must accept  the limitation. But if he has this native equipment, its possession in  no way guarantees that he will ever talk any language or what language  he will talk. The environment in which his activities occur and by which  they are carried into execution settles these things. If he lived in a  dumb unsocial environment where men refused to talk to one another and  used only that minimum of gestures without which they could not get  along, vocal language would be as unachieved by him as if he had no  vocal organs. If the sounds which he makes occur in a medium of persons  speaking the Chinese language, the activities which make like sounds  will be selected and coordinated. This illustration may be applied to  the entire range of the educability of any individual. It places the  heritage from the past in its right connection with the demands and  opportunities of the present.    (2) The theory that the proper subject matter of instruction is found  in the culture-products of past ages (either in general, or more  specifically in the particular literatures which were produced in  the culture epoch which is supposed to correspond with the stage of  development of those taught) affords another instance of that divorce  between the process and product of growth which has been criticized. To  keep the process alive, to keep it alive in ways which make it easier  to keep it alive in the future, is the function of educational subject  matter. But an individual can live only in the present. The present  is not just something which comes after the past; much less something  produced by it. It is what life is in leaving the past behind it. The  study of past products will not help us understand the present, because  the present is not due to the products, but to the life of which they  were the products. A knowledge of the past and its heritage is of great  significance when it enters into the present, but not otherwise. And the  mistake of making the records and remains of the past the main material  of education is that it cuts the vital connection of present and past,  and tends to make the past a rival of the present and the present a more  or less futile imitation of the past. Under such circumstances, culture  becomes an ornament and solace; a refuge and an asylum. Men escape  from the crudities of the present to live in its imagined refinements,  instead of using what the past offers as an agency for ripening these  crudities. The present, in short, generates the problems which lead us  to search the past for suggestion, and which supplies meaning to what we  find when we search. The past is the past precisely because it does  not include what is characteristic in the present. The moving present  includes the past on condition that it uses the past to direct its own  movement. The past is a great resource for the imagination; it adds a  new dimension to life, but OD condition that it be seen as the past of  the present, and not as another and disconnected world. The principle  which makes little of the present act of living and operation of  growing, the only thing always present, naturally looks to the past  because the future goal which it sets up is remote and empty. But having  turned its back upon the present, it has no way of returning to it laden  with the spoils of the past. A mind that is adequately sensitive to the  needs and occasions of the present actuality will have the liveliest of  motives for interest in the background of the present, and will never  have to hunt for a way back because it will never have lost connection.    3. Education as Reconstruction. In its contrast with the ideas both  of unfolding of latent powers from within, and of the formation from  without, whether by physical nature or by the cultural products of the  past, the ideal of growth results in the conception that education is  a constant reorganizing or reconstructing of experience. It has all the  time an immediate end, and so far as activity is educative, it reaches  that end--the direct transformation of the quality of experience."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8537"],[0,"Lonesome Land (#18)"],[1,"stood in a brown oasis  of unburned grass and weeds, scanty enough, it is true, but yet a relief  from the dead black surroundings.    The woodpile had not suffered. A chopping block, a decrepit sawhorse,  an axe, and a rusty bucksaw marked the spot; also three ties, hacked  eloquently in places, and just five sticks of wood, evidently chopped from  a tie by a man in haste. Kent looked at that woodpile, and swore. He had  always known that Manley had an aversion to laboring with his hands, but he  was unprepared for such an exhibition of shiftlessness.    He savagely attacked the three ties, chopped them into firewood, and piled  them neatly, and then, walking upon his toes, he made a fire in the kitchen  stove, filled the woodbox, the teakettle, and the water pail, sat out in  the shade until he heard the kettle boiling over on the stove, took another  peep in at Val, and then, moving as quietly as he could, proceeded to cook  supper for them both.    He had been perfectly familiar with the kitchen arrangements in the days  when Manley was a bachelor, and it interested him and filled him with a  respectful admiration for woman in the abstract and for Val in particular,  to see how changed everything was, and how daintily clean and orderly.  Val's smooth, white hands, with their two sparkly rings and the broad  wedding band, did not suggest a familiarity with actual work about a house,  but the effect of her labor and thought confronted him at every turn.    \"You can see your face in everything you pick up that was made to shine,\"  he commented, standing for a moment while he surveyed the bottom of a  stewpan. \"She don't look it, but that yellow-eyed little dame sure knows  how to keep house.\" Then he heard her cough, and set down the stewpan  hurriedly and went to see if she wanted anything.    Val was sitting upon the couch, her two hands pushing back her hair, gazing  stupidly around her.    \"Everything's all ready but the tea,\" Kent announced, in a perfectly  matter-of-fact tone. \"I was just waiting to see how strong you want it.\"    Val turned her yellow-brown eyes upon him in bewilderment. \"Why, Mr.  Burnett--maybe I wasn't dreaming, then. I thought there was a fire. Was  there?\"    Kent grinned. \"Kinda. You worked like a son of a gun, too--till there  wasn't any more to do, and then you laid 'em down for fair. You were all  in, so I packed you in and put you there where you could be comfortable.  And supper's ready--but how strong do you want your tea? I kinda had an  idea,\" he added lamely, \"that women drink tea, mostly. I made coffee for  myself.\"    Val let herself drop back among the pretty pillows. \"I don't want any. If  there was a fire,\" she said dully, \"then it's true. Everything's all burned  up. I don't want any tea. I want to die!\"    Kent studied her for a moment. \"Well, in that case--shall I get the axe?\"    Val had closed her eyes, but she opened them again. \"I don't care what you  do,\" she said.    \"Well, I aim to please,\" he told her calmly. \"What _I'd_ do, in your place,  would be to go and put on something that ain't all smoked and scorched like  a--a ham, and then I'd sit up and drink some tea, and be nice about it.  But, of course, if you want to cash in--\"    Val gave a sob. \"I can't help it--I'd just as soon be dead as alive. It  was bad enough before--and now everything's burned up--and all Manley's  nice--ha-ay--\"    \"Well,\" Kent interrupted mercilessly, \"I've heard of women doing all kinds  of fool things--but this is the first time I ever knew one to commit  suicide over a couple of measly haystacks!\" He went out and slammed the  door so that the house shook, and tramped three times across the kitchen  floor. \"That'll make her so mad at me she won't think about anything else  for a while,\" he reasoned shrewdly. But all the while his eyes were shiny,  and when he winked, his lashes became unaccountably moist. He stopped and  looked out at the blackened coulee. \"Shut into this hole, week after week,  without a woman to speak to--it must be--damned tough!\" he muttered.    He tiptoed up and laid his ear against the inner door, and heard a  smothered sobbing inside. That did not sound as if she were \"mad,\" and he  promptly cursed himself for a fool and a brute. With his own judgment to  guide him, he brewed some very creditable tea, sugared and creamed it  lavishly, browned a slice of bread on top of the stove--blowing off the  dust beforehand--after Arline's recipe for making toast, buttered it until  it dripped oil, and carried it in to her with the air of a man who will  have peace even though he must fight for it. The forlorn picture she made,  lying there with her face buried in a pink-and-blue cushion, and with her  shoulders shaking with sobs, almost made him retreat, quite unnerved. As it  was, he merely spilled a third of the tea and just missed letting the toast  slide from the plate to the floor; when he had righted his burden he had  recovered his composure to a degree.    \"Here, this won't do at all,\" he reproved, pulling a chair to the couch by  the simple method of hooking his toe under a round and dragging it toward  him. \"You don't want Man to come and catch you acting like this. He's  liable to feel pretty blue himself, and he'll need some cheering up--don't  you think? I don't know for sure--but I've always been kinda under the  impression that's what a man gets a wife for. Ain't it? You don't want to  throw down your cards now. You sit up and drink this tea, and eat this  toast, and I'll gamble you'll feel about two hundred per cent better.    \"Come,\" he urged gently, after a minute. \"I never thought a nervy little  woman like you would give up so easy. I was plumb ashamed of myself, the  way you worked on that back fire. You had me going, for a while. You're  just tired out, is all ails you. You want to hurry up and drink this,  before it gets cold. Come on. I'm liable to feel, insulted if you pass up  my cooking this way.\"    Val choked back the tears, and, without taking her face from the pillow,  put out the burned hand gropingly until it touched his knee.    \"Oh, you--you're good,\" she said brokenly. \"I used to think you  were--horrid, and I'm a--ashamed. You're good, and I--\"    \"Well, I ain't going to be good much longer, if you don't get your head  outa that pillow and drink this tea!\" His tone was amused and half  impatient. But his face--more particularly his eyes--told another story,  which perhaps it was as well she did not read. \"I'll be dropping the blamed  stuff in another minute. My elbow's plumb getting a cramp in it,\" he added  complainingly.    Val made a sound half-way between a sob and a laugh, and sat up. With more  haste than the occasion warranted, Kent put the tea and toast on the chair  and started for the kitchen.    \"I was bound you'd eat before I did,\" he explained, \"and I could stand a  cup of coffee myself. And, say! If there's anything more you want, just  holler, and I'll come on the long lope.\"    Val took up the teaspoon, tasted the tea, and then regarded the cup  doubtfully. She never drank sugar in her tea. She wondered how much of it  he had put in. Her head ached frightfully, and she felt weak and utterly  hopeless of ever feeling different.    \"Everything all right?\" came Kent's voice from the kitchen.    \"Yes,\" Val answered hastily, trying hard to speak with some life and cheer  in her tone. \"It's lovely--all of it.\"    \"Want more tea?\" It sounded, out there, as though he was pushing back his  chair to rise from the table.    \"No, no, this is plenty.\" Val glanced fearfully toward the kitchen door,  lifted the teacup, and heroically drank every drop. It was, she considered,  the least that she could do.    When he had finished eating he came in, and found her nibbling  apathetically at the toast. She looked up at him with an apology in her  eyes.    \"Mr. Burnett, don't think I am always so silly,\" she began, leaning back  against the piled pillows with a sigh. \"I have always thought that I could  bear anything. But last night I didn't sleep much. I dreamed about fires,  and that Manley was--dead--and I woke up in a perfect horror. It was only  ten o'clock. So then I sat up and tried to read, and every five minutes I  would go out and look at the sky, to see if there was a glow anywhere.  It was foolish, of course. And I didn't sleep at all to-day, either. The  minute I would lie down I'd imagine I heard a fire roaring. And then it  came. But I was all used up before that, so I wasn't really--I must have  fainted, for I don't remember getting into the house--and I do think  fainting is the silliest thing! I never did such a thing before,\" she  finished abjectly.    \"Oh, well--I guess you had a license to faint if you felt that way,\" he  comforted awkwardly. \"It was the smoke and the heat, I reckon; they were  enough to put a crimp in anybody. Did Man say about when he would be back?  Because I ought to be moving along; it's quite a walk to the Wishbone.\"    \"Oh--you won't go till Manley comes! Please! I--I'd go crazy, here alone,  and--and he might not come--he's frequently detained. I--I've such a  horror of fires--\" She certainly looked as if she had. She was sitting up  straight, her hands held out appealingly to him, her eyes big and bright.    \"Sure I won't go if you feel that way about it.\" Kent was half frightened  at her wild manner. \"I guess Man will be along pretty soon, anyway. He'll  hit the trail as soon as he can get behind the fire, that's a cinch. He'll  be worried to death about you. And you don't need to be afraid of prairie  fires any more, Mrs. Fleetwood; you're safe. There can't be any more fires  till next year, anyway; there's nothing left to burn.\" He turned his face  to the window and stared out somberly at the ravaged hillside. \"Yes--you're  dead safe, now!\"    \"I'm such a fool,\" Val confessed, her eyes also turning to the window, \"If  you want to go, I--\" Her mouth was quivering, and she did"]]]
