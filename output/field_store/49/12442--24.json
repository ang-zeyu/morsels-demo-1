But at this time a good many  important events were happening in Europe; and it is these that we must  follow first.    William of Orange, the Washington of Holland, was assassinated at  Philip's instigation, while plots to kill Elizabeth and place Mary on  the throne began to multiply. The agents were executed, while a 'Bond of  Association' was signed by all Elizabeth's chief supporters, binding  them to hunt down and kill all who tried to kill her--a plain hint for  Mary Queen of Scots to stop plotting or stand the consequences.    But the merchants trading with Spain and Portugal were more than ever  for keeping on good terms with Philip because the failure of the Spanish  harvest had induced him to offer them special protection and  encouragement if they would supply his country's needs at once. Every  available ton of shipping was accordingly taken up for Spain. The  English merchant fleet went out, and big profits seemed assured. But  presently the _Primrose_, 'a tall ship of London,' came flying home to  say that Philip had suddenly seized the merchandise, imprisoned the  men, and taken the ships and guns for use with the Great Armada. That  was the last straw. The peaceful traders now saw that they were wrong  and that the fighting ones were right; and for the first time both could  rejoice over the clever trick by which John Hawkins had got his own  again from Philip. In 1571, three years after Don Martin's treachery at  San Juan de Ulna, Hawkins, while commanding the Scilly Island squadron,  led the Spanish ambassador to believe that he would go over to the  Spanish cause in Ireland if his claims for damages were only paid in  full and all his surviving men in Mexico were sent home. The cold and  crafty Philip swallowed this tempting bait; sent the men home with  Spanish dollars in their pockets, and paid Hawkins forty thousand  pounds, the worth of about two million dollars now. Then Hawkins used  the information he had picked up behind the Spanish scenes to unravel  the Ridolfi Plot for putting Mary on the throne in 1572, the year of St.  Bartholomew. No wonder Philip hated sea-dogs!    Things new and old having reached this pass, the whole of England, bar  the Marians, were eager for the great 'Indies Voyage' of 1585. Londoners  crowded down to Woolwich 'with great jolitie' to see off their own  contingent on its way to join Drake's flag at Plymouth. Very probably  Shakespeare went down too, for that famous London merchantman, the  _Tiger_, to which he twice alludes--once in _Macbeth_ and once in  _Twelfth Night_--was off with this contingent. Such a private fleet had  never yet been seen: twenty-one ships, eight smart pinnaces, and  twenty-three hundred men of every rank and rating. The Queen was  principal shareholder and managing director. But, as usual in colonial  attacks intended for disavowal if necessity arose, no prospectus or  other document was published, nor were the shareholders of this  joint-stock company known in any quite official way. It was the size of  the fleet and the reputation of the officers that made it a  national affair. Drake, now forty, was 'Admiral'; Frobisher, of  North-West-Passage fame, was 'Vice'; Knollys, the Queen's own cousin,  'Rear.' Carleill, a famous general, commanded the troops and sailed in  Shakespeare's _Tiger_. Drake's old crew from the _Golden Hind_ came  forward to a man, among them Wright, 'that excellent mathematician and  ingineer,' and big Tom Moone, the lion of all boarding-parties, each in  command of a ship.    But Elizabeth was just then weaving the threads of an unusually  intricate diplomatic pattern; so doubts and delays, orders and  counter-orders vexed Drake to the last. Sir Philip Sidney, too, came  down as a volunteer; which was another sore vexation, since his European  fame would have made him practically joint commander of the fleet,  although he was not a naval officer at all. But he had the good sense to  go back; whereupon Drake, fearing further interruptions from the court,  ordered everything to be tumbled into the nearest ships and hurried off  to sea under a press of sail.    The first port of call was Vigo in the northwestern corner of Spain,  where Drake's envoy told the astonished governor that Elizabeth wanted  to know what Philip intended doing about embargoes now. If the governor  wanted peace, he must listen to Drake's arguments; if war--well, Drake  was ready to begin at once. A three-days' storm interrupted the  proceedings; after which the English intercepted the fugitive townsfolk  whose flight showed that the governor meant to make a stand, though he  had said the embargo had been lifted and that all the English prisoners  were at liberty to go. Some English sailors, however, were still being  held; so Drake sent in an armed party and brought them off, with a good  pile of reprisal booty too. Then he put to sea and made for the Spanish  Main by way of the Portuguese African islands.    The plan of campaign drawn up for Burleigh's information still exists.  It shows that Drake, the consummate raider, was also an admiral of the  highest kind. The items, showing how long each part should take and what  loot each place should yield, are exact and interesting. But it is in  the relation of every part to every other part and to the whole that the  original genius of the born commander shines forth in all its glory.  After taking San Domingo he was to sack Margarita, La Hacha, and Santa  Marta, razing their fortifications as he left. Cartagena and Nombre de  Dios came next. Then Carleill was to raid Panama, with the help of the  Maroons, while Drake himself was to raid the coast of Honduras. Finally,  with reunited forces, he would take Havana and, if possible, hold it by  leaving a sufficient garrison behind. Thus he would paralyze New Spain  by destroying all the points of junction along its lines of  communication just when Philip stood most in need of its help for  completing the Great Armada.    But, like a mettlesome steeplechaser, Drake took a leap in his stride  during the preliminary canter before the great race. The wind being foul  for the Canaries, he went on to the Cape Verde archipelago and captured  Santiago, which had been abandoned in terror on the approach of the  English 'Dragon,' that sinister hero of Lope de Vega's epic onslaught  _La Dragontea_. As good luck would have it, Carleill marched in on the  anniversary of the Queen's accession, the 17th of November. So there was  a royal salute fired in Her Majesty's honor by land and sea. No treasure  was found, French privateers had sacked the place three years before and  had killed off everyone they caught; the Portuguese, therefore, were not  going to wait to meet the English 'Dragon' too. The force that marched  inland failed to unearth the governor. So San Domingo, Santiago, and  Porto Pravda were all burnt to the ground before the fleet bore away for  the West Indies.    San Domingo in Hispaniola (Hayti) was made in due course, but only after  a virulent epidemic had seriously thinned the ranks. San Domingo was the  oldest town in New Spain and was strongly garrisoned and fortified. But  Carleill's soldiers carried all before them. Drake battered down the  seaward walls. The Spaniards abandoned the citadel at night, and the  English took the whole place as a New Year's gift for 1586. But again  there was no treasure. The Spaniards had killed off the Caribs in war or  in the mines, so that nothing was now dug out. Moreover the citizens  were quite on their guard against adventurers and ready to hide what  they had in the most inaccessible places. Drake then put the town up to  ransom and sent out his own Maroon boy servant to bring in the message  from the Spanish officer proposing terms. This Spaniard, hating all  Maroons, ran his lance through the boy and cantered away. The boy came  back with the last ounce of his strength and fell dead at Drake's feet.  Drake sent to say he would hang two Spaniards every day if the murderer  was not hanged by his own compatriots. As no one came he began with two  friars. Then the Spaniards brought in the offender and hanged him in the  presence of both armies.    That episode cleared the air; and an interchange of courtesies and  hospitalities immediately followed. But no business was done. Drake  therefore began to burn the town bit by bit till twenty-five thousand  ducats were paid. It was very little for the capital. But the men picked  up a good deal of loot in the process and vented their ultra-Protestant  zeal on all the 'graven images' that were not worth keeping for sale.  On the whole the English were well satisfied. They had taken all the  Spanish ships and armament they wanted, destroyed the rest, liberated  over a hundred brawny galley-slaves--some Turks among them--all anxious  for revenge, and had struck a blow at Spanish prestige which echoed back  to Europe. Spain never hid her light under a bushel; and here, in the  Governor's Palace, was a huge escutcheon with a horse standing on the  earth and pawing at the sky. The motto blazoned on it was to the effect  that the earth itself was not enough for Spain--_Non sufficit orbis._  Drake's humor was greatly tickled, and he and his officers kept asking  the Spaniards to translate the motto again and again.    Delays and tempestuous head winds induced Drake to let intermediate  points alone and make straight for Cartagena on the South American  mainland. Cartagena had been warned and was on the alert. It was strong  by both nature and art. The garrison was good of its kind, though the  Spaniards' custom of fighting in quilted jackets instead of armor put  them at a disadvantage. This custom was due to the heat and to the fact  that the jackets were proof against the native arrows.    There was an outer and an inner harbor, with such an intricate and  well-defended passage that no one thought Drake would dare"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12888"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 05 (#19)"],[1,"not so  hazard; no spirit inspires them, but he is altogether inspired by a  fanatical spirit--that of his mighty and powerful self-conceit.    It follows from all this that the state, as mere governance of human  life proceeding in its normal peaceable course, is not a primal thing  and one existing for itself, but that it is simply the means to the  higher end of the eternally uniform development of the purely human in  this nation; that it is only the vision and the love of this eternal  development which is continually to guide the higher outlook upon the  administration of the state, even in periods of calm, and which alone  can save the independence of the nation when this is endangered. In  the case of the Germans, among whom, as being a primitive people, this  love of country was possible and, as we firmly believe, has actually  existed hitherto, such patriotism could, up to our own time, count  with a high degree of certainty upon the safety of its most important  interests. As was the case only among the Greeks in antiquity, among  the Germans the State and the nation were actually severed from  each other, and each was represented separately; the former in the  individual German kingdoms and principalities; the latter visibly in  the Federation of the Empire, and invisibly--valid not in consequence  of written law but as a sequence of a law living in the hearts of all,  and in its results striking the eyes at every turn--in a multitude  of customs and institutions. As far as the German language extended,  every one who saw the light within its domain could regard himself  as a citizen in a two-fold sense, partly of his natal city, to whose  immediate protection he was recommended; and partly of the entire  common fatherland of the German nation. Throughout the whole extent of  this fatherland each man might seek for himself that culture which was  most akin to his spirit, or he might search for the sphere of activity  most suited for it; and talent did not grow into its place, like a  tree, but he was permitted to search for that place. He who became  estranged from his immediate surroundings through the direction taken  by his culture, easily found welcome reception elsewhere; he found new  friends instead of those whom he had lost; he found time and quiet in  which to explain himself more accurately and perhaps to win over and  to reconcile the wrathful themselves, and thus to unite the whole. No  German-born prince could ever bring himself to mark off the fatherland  of his subjects within the mountains or rivers where he ruled, and to  regard them as bound to the soil. A truth which could not be uttered  in one place might be proclaimed in another, where, perhaps, on the  contrary, those truths were forbidden which were allowable in the  former district; and thus, despite many instances of partiality and  narrow-mindedness in the individual states, in Germany, taken as  a whole, was found the utmost freedom of investigation and of  communication that ever a nation possessed. Higher culture was, and  remained on every hand, the result of the reciprocity of the citizens  of all German states, and this higher culture then gradually descended  in this form to the greater masses, who, consequently, have always,  on the whole, continued to educate themselves. As has been said, no  German with a German heart, placed at the head of a government, has  ever diminished this essential pledge of the continuance of a German  nation; and even though, in view of other primitive decisions, what  the higher German patriotism must desire was not invariably to  be effected, yet at least there was no direct opposition to its  interests; no effort was made to undermine that love, to eradicate it,  and to replace it by an antagonistic love.    But if, now, the original guidance both of that higher culture and  of the national power--which should be used only in behalf of that  culture and to further its continuance--the employment of German  wealth and German blood is to pass from the supremacy of the German  spirit to that of another, what would then necessarily result?    Here is the place where there is special need of applying the policy  which we outlined in our first address, namely, to be unwilling to  be deceived in regard to our own interest, and to have the courage  willingly to see the truth and acknowledge it. Moreover, it is still  permissible, so far as I know, to talk with one another in German  about our fatherland, or at least to sigh in German, and, I  believe, we should not do well if we ourselves precipitated such an  interdiction and wished to lay the fetters of individual timidity on  the courage which, no doubt, will already have considered the risk of  the venture.    Well then, picture to yourself the presupposed new regime to be as  kind and as benevolent as you will; make it good as God; will you also  be able to invest it with divine understanding? Even though it may, in  all earnestness, desire the highest happiness and welfare of all,  will the best welfare that it can comprehend also be the welfare of  Germany? I accordingly hope that I shall be perfectly understood in  reference to the main point that I have presented to you today; I hope  that in the course of my remarks many have thought and felt that I  merely express clearly in words what has always lain within their  hearts; I hope the same will be the case with the other Germans  who will some day read this address. Several Germans have said  approximately the same things before me, and that sentiment has  lain obscurely at the basis of the opposition continually manifested  against a merely mechanical establishment and estimate of the State.  And now I challenge all who are acquainted with modern foreign  literature to prove to me what later sage, poet, or lawgiver among  them has ever given birth to a prophetic thought similar to this,  which regarded the human race as being in continual progress, and  which correlated all its temporal activity only with this progress;  whether any one of them, even in the period when they soared most  boldly to political creation, demanded from the state more than  equality, internal peace, external national fame, and, when their  demands reached the extreme limit, domestic happiness? If this is  their highest conception, as must be deduced from all that has been  said, they can attribute to us likewise no higher needs and no  higher demands upon life, and--always presupposing those beneficent  sentiments toward us and an absence of all selfishness and of all  desire to be more than we--they believe that they have made admirable  provision for us when they give us all that they alone recognize as  desirable. On the other hand, that for which alone the nobler soul  among us can live is then eradicated from public life, and the people,  who have always shown themselves receptive toward the impulses of  higher things, and the majority of whom, it might be hoped, could even  be raised to that nobility, are--in so far as it is treated as they  wish it to be treated--abased beneath its rank, dishonored, and  blotted out, since it coalesces with the populace of the baser sort.    If, now, those higher claims upon life, together with the sense of  their divine right, still remain living and potent in any one, he,  with deep indignation, feels himself crushed back into those first  ages of Christianity in which it was said: \"Resist not evil: but  whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other  also. And if any man will take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak  also.\" And rightly so, for as long as he still sees a cloak upon thee,  he seeks an opportunity to quarrel with thee in order to take this  also from thee; not until thou art utterly naked dost thou escape his  attention and art unmolested by him. Even his higher feelings, which  do him honor, make earth a hell and an abomination to him; he wishes  that he had not been born; he wishes that his eyes may close to the  light of day, the sooner the better; unceasing sorrow lays hold upon  his days until the grave claims him; he can wish for those dear to him  no better gift than a quiet and contented spirit, that with less pain  they may live on in expectation of an eternal life beyond the grave.    These addresses lay upon you the task of preventing, by the sole means  which still remains after the others have been tried in vain, the  destruction of every nobler impulse that may in the future possibly  arise among us and this debasement of our entire nation. They present  to you a true and omnipotent patriotism, which, in the conception  of our nation as of one that is eternal, and as citizens of our own  eternity, is to be deeply and ineradicably founded in the minds of  all, by means of education. What this education may be, and in what  way it may be achieved, we shall see in the following addresses.
