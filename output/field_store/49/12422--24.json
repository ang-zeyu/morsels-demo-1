It is often the  fashion to say that Parliamentary government is difficult to reconcile  with a strong foreign policy; the experiences of Prussia from the year  1815 to 1863 seem to shew that under monarchical government it is  equally difficult.    Meanwhile he had been maturing in his mind a bolder plan: Why should not  Prussia gain the support she required by alliance with Napoleon?    The Germans had watched the rise of Napoleon with suspicion and alarm;  they had long been taught that France was their natural enemy. When  Napoleon seized the power and assumed the name of Emperor, the old  distrust was revived; his very name recalled memories of hostility; they  feared he would pursue an ambitious and warlike policy; that he would  withdraw the agreements on which the peace of Europe and the security of  the weaker States depended, and that he would extend to the Rhine the  borders of France. He was the first ruler of France whose internal  policy awoke no sympathy in Germany; his natural allies, the Liberals,  he had alienated by the overthrow of the Republic, and he gained no  credit for it in the eyes of the Conservatives. The monarchical party in  Prussia could only have admiration for the man who had imprisoned a  Parliament and restored absolute government; they could not repudiate an  act which they would gladly imitate, but they could not forgive him that  he was an usurper. According to their creed the suppression of liberty  was the privilege of the legitimate King.    It was the last remnant of the doctrine of legitimacy, the belief that  it was the duty of the European monarchs that no State should change its  form of government or the dynasty by which it was ruled; the doctrine of  the Holy Alliance that kings must make common cause against the  Revolution. How changed were the times from the days when Metternich had  used this as a strong support for the ascendancy of the House of  Austria! Austria herself was no longer sound; the old faith lingered  only in St. Petersburg and Berlin; but how weak and ineffective it had  become! There was no talk now of interference, there would not be  another campaign of Waterloo or of Valmy; there was only a prudish  reserve; they could not, they did not dare, refuse diplomatic dealings  with the new Emperor, but they were determined there should be no  cordiality: the virgin purity of the Prussian Court should not be  deflowered by intimacy with the man of sin.[5] If there could not be a  fresh crusade against Buonapartism, at least, there should be no  alliance with it.    From the beginning Bismarck had little sympathy with this point of view;  he regarded the _coup d'etat_ as necessary in a nation which had left  the firm ground of legitimacy; France could not be governed except by an  iron hand. As a Prussian, however, he could not be pleased, for he saw  an enemy who had been weak strengthened, but he did not believe in  Napoleon's warlike desires. In one way it was an advantage,--the  overthrow of the Republic had broken the bond which joined the German  revolutionists to France. He did not much mind what happened in other  countries so long as Prussia was safe.    There is no ground for surprise that he soon began to go farther; he  warned his friends not to irritate the Emperor; on the occasion of the  Emperor's marriage the _Kreuz Zeitung_ published a violent article,  speaking of it as an insult and threat to Prussia. Bismarck's feelings  as a gentleman were offended by this useless scolding; it seemed,  moreover, dangerous. If Prussia were to quarrel with France, they would  be obliged to seek the support of the Eastern Powers: if Russia and  Austria should know this, Prussia would be in their hands. The only  effect of this attitude would be to cut off the possibility of a useful  move in the game of diplomacy:      \"There is no good in giving our opposition to France the stamp of    irrevocability; it would be no doubt a great misfortune if we    were to unite ourselves with France, but why proclaim this to all    the world? We should do wiser to act so that Austria and Russia    would have to court our friendship against France than treat us    as an ally who is presented to them.\"    It is a topic to which he often refers:      \"We cannot make an alliance with France without a certain degree    of meanness, but very admirable people, even German princes, in    the Middle Ages have used a sewer to make their escape, rather    than be beaten or throttled.\"    An alliance with Napoleon was, however, according to the code of honour  professed, if not followed, in every German State, the sin for which  there was no forgiveness. It was but a generation ago that half the  German princes had hurried to the Court of the first Napoleon to receive  at his hands the estates of their neighbours and the liberties of their  subjects. No one doubted that the new Napoleon would be willing to use  similar means to ensure the power of France; would he meet with willing  confederates? The Germans, at least, do not seem to have trusted one  another; no prince dared show ordinary courtesy to the ruling family of  France, no statesman could visit Paris but voices would be heard crying  that he had sold himself and his country. An accusation of this kind was  the stock-in-trade which the Nationalist press was always ready to bring  against every ruler who was obnoxious to them. It required moral  courage, if it also shewed political astuteness, when Bismarck proposed  deliberately to encourage a suspicion from which most men were anxious  that their country should be free. He had already plenty of enemies, and  reports were soon heard that he was in favour of a French alliance; they  did not cease for ten years; he often protests in his private letters  against these unworthy accusations; the protests seem rather absurd, for  if he did not really wish for an alliance between Prussia and France, he  at least wished that people should dread such an alliance. A man cannot  frighten his friends by the fear he will rob them, and at the same time  enjoy the reputation for strict probity.    He explains with absolute clearness the benefits which will come from a  French alliance:      \"The German States are attentive and attracted to us in the same    degree in which they believe we are befriended by France.    Confidence in us they will never have, every glance at the map    prevents that; and they know that their separate interests and    the misuse of their sovereignty always stand in the way of the    whole tendency of Prussian policy. They clearly recognise the    danger which lies in this; it is one against which the    unselfishness of our Most Gracious Master alone gives them a    temporary security. The opinions of the King, which ought at    least for a time to weaken their mistrust, will gain his Majesty    no thanks; they will only be used and exploited. In the hour of    necessity gratitude and confidence will not bring a single man    into the field. Fear, if it is used with foresight and clearness,    can place the whole Confederacy at our feet, and in order to    instil fear into them we must give clear signs of our good    relations with France.\"    He objected to Prussia following what was called a German policy, for,  as he said, by a national and patriotic policy is meant that Prussia  should do what was for the interest, not of herself, but of the smaller  States.    It was not till after the Crimean War that he was able to press this  policy. Napoleon had now won his position in Europe; Gerlach had seen  with pain and disgust that the Queen of England had visited his Court.  The Emperor himself desired a union with Prussia. In this, sympathy and  interest combined: he had much affection for Germany; his mind, as his  education, was more German than French; he was a man of ideas; he was  the only ruler of France who has sincerely desired and deliberately  furthered the interests of other countries; he believed that the nation  should be the basis of the State; his revolutionary antecedents made him  naturally opposed to the House of Austria; and he was ready to help  Prussia in resuming her old ambitious policy.    The affair of Neuchatel gave him an opportunity of earning the personal  gratitude of the King, and he did not neglect it, for he knew that in  the royal prejudice was the strongest impediment to an alliance. In 1857  Bismarck was sent to Paris to discuss this and other matters. Two years  before he had been presented to the Emperor, but it had been at the time  when he was opposed to the French policy. Now for the first time the two  men who were for ten years to be the leaders, now friends, then rivals,  in the realm of diplomacy, were brought into close connection. Bismarck  was not impressed by the Emperor's ability. He wrote:      \"People exaggerate his intellect, but underrate his heart.\"    Napoleon was very friendly; his wish to help the King went    farther than his duty to follow French policy. He said: \"Why    should we not be friends; let us forget the past; if everyone    were to attach himself to a policy of memories, two nations that    have once been at war must be at war to all eternity; statesmen    must occupy themselves with the future.\"    This was just Bismarck's opinion; he wrote home suggesting that he might  prepare the way for a visit of the Emperor to Prussia; he would like to  come and it would have a good effect. This was going farther than the  King, grateful though he was, would allow; he told Gerlach not to answer  this part of the letter at all while Bismarck was in Paris. Bismarck,  however, continued in his official reports and private letters to urge  again and again the political advantages of an understanding with  France; it is Austria that is the natural enemy, for it is Austria whose  interests are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12422"],[0,"Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation: 1838-1839 (#19)"],[1,"made ill by the double effort not to  laugh, and, if possible, not to breathe.           *       *       *       *       *      Monday, 20th.    My Dearest E----. A rather longer interval than usual has elapsed since I  last wrote to you, but I must beg you to excuse it. I have had more than a  usual amount of small daily occupations to fill my time; and, as a mere  enumeration of these would not be very interesting to you, I will tell you  a story which has just formed an admirable illustration for my observation  of all the miseries of which this accursed system of slavery is the cause,  even under the best and most humane administration of its laws and usages.  Pray note it, my dear friend, for you will find, in the absence of all  voluntary or even conscious cruelty on the part of the master, the best  possible comment on a state of things which, without the slightest desire  to injure and oppress, produces such intolerable results of injury and  oppression.    We have, as a sort of under nursemaid and assistant of my dear M----,  whose white complexion, as I wrote you, occasioned such indignation to my  southern fellow-travellers, and such extreme perplexity to the poor slaves  on our arrival here, a much more orthodox servant for these parts, a young  woman named Psyche, but commonly called Sack, not a very graceful  abbreviation of the divine heathen appellation: she cannot be much over  twenty, has a very pretty figure, a graceful gentle deportment, and a face  which, but for its colour (she is a dingy mulatto), would be pretty, and  is extremely pleasing, from the perfect sweetness of its expression; she  is always serious, not to say sad and silent, and has altogether an air of  melancholy and timidity, that has frequently struck me very much, and  would have made me think some special anxiety or sorrow must occasion it,  but that God knows the whole condition of these wretched people naturally  produces such a deportment, and there is no necessity to seek for special  or peculiar causes to account for it. Just in proportion as I have found  the slaves on this plantation intelligent and advanced beyond the general  brutish level of the majority, I have observed this pathetic expression of  countenance in them, a mixture of sadness and fear, the involuntary  exhibition of the two feelings, which I suppose must be the predominant  experience of their whole lives, regret and apprehension, not the less  heavy, either of them, for being, in some degree, vague and indefinite--a  sense of incalculable past loss and injury, and a dread of incalculable  future loss and injury.    I have never questioned Psyche as to her sadness, because, in the first  place, as I tell you, it appears to me most natural, and is observable in  all the slaves, whose superior natural or acquired intelligence allows of  their filling situations of trust or service about the house and family;  and, though I cannot and will not refuse to hear any and every tale of  suffering which these unfortunates bring to me, I am anxious to spare both  myself and them the pain of vain appeals to me for redress and help,  which, alas! it is too often utterly out of my power to give them. It is  useless, and indeed worse than useless, that they should see my impotent  indignation and unavailing pity, and hear expressions of compassion for  them, and horror at their condition, which might only prove incentives to  a hopeless resistance on their part to a system, under the hideous weight  of whose oppression any individual or partial revolt must be annihilated  and ground into the dust. Therefore, as I tell you, I asked Psyche no  questions, but, to my great astonishment, the other day M---- asked me if  I knew to whom Psyche belonged, as the poor woman had enquired of her with  much hesitation and anguish if she could tell her who owned her and her  children. She has two nice little children under six years old, whom she  keeps as clean and tidy, and who are sad and as silent, as herself. My  astonishment at this question was, as you will readily believe, not small,  and I forthwith sought out Psyche for an explanation. She was thrown into  extreme perturbation at finding that her question had been referred to me,  and it was some time before I could sufficiently reassure her to be able  to comprehend, in the midst of her reiterated entreaties for pardon, and  hopes that she had not offended me, that she did not know herself who  owned her. She was, at one time, the property of Mr. K----, the former  overseer, of whom I have already spoken to you, and who has just been  paying Mr. ---- a visit. He, like several of his predecessors in the  management, has contrived to make a fortune upon it (though it yearly  decreases in value to the owners, but this is the inevitable course of  things in the southern states), and has purchased a plantation of his own  in Alabama, I believe, or one of the south-western states. Whether she  still belonged to Mr. K---- or not she did not know, and entreated me if  she did to endeavour to persuade Mr. ---- to buy her. Now, you must know  that this poor woman is the wife of one of Mr. B----'s slaves, a fine,  intelligent, active, excellent young man, whose whole family are among  some of the very best specimens of character and capacity on the estate. I  was so astonished at the (to me) extraordinary state of things revealed by  poor Sack's petition, that I could only tell her that I had supposed all  the negroes on the plantation were Mr. ----'s property, but that I would  certainly enquire, and find out for her if I could to whom she belonged,  and if I could, endeavour to get Mr. ---- to purchase her, if she really  was not his.    Now, E----, just conceive for one moment the state of mind of this woman,  believing herself to belong to a man who, in a few days, was going down  to one of those abhorred and dreaded south-western states, and who would  then compel her, with her poor little children, to leave her husband and  the only home she had ever known, and all the ties of affection,  relationship, and association of her former life, to follow him thither,  in all human probability never again to behold any living creature that  she had seen before; and this was so completely a matter of course that  it was not even thought necessary to apprise her positively of the fact,  and the only thing that interposed between her and this most miserable  fate was the faint hope that Mr. ---- _might have_ purchased her and her  children. But if he had, if this great deliverance had been vouchsafed to  her, the knowledge of it was not thought necessary; and with this deadly  dread at her heart she was living day after day, waiting upon me and  seeing me, with my husband beside me, and my children in my arms in  blessed security, safe from all separation but the one reserved in God's  great providence for all His creatures. Do you think I wondered any more  at the woe-begone expression of her countenance, or do you think it was  easy for me to restrain within prudent and proper limits the expression  of my feelings at such a state of things? And she had gone on from day to  day enduring this agony, till I suppose its own intolerable pressure and  M----'s sweet countenance and gentle sympathising voice and manner had  constrained her to lay down this great burden of sorrow at our feet. I  did not see Mr. ---- until the evening; but in the meantime, meeting Mr.  O----, the overseer, with whom, as I believe I have already told you, we  are living here, I asked him about Psyche, and who was her proprietor,  when to my infinite surprise he told me that _he_ had bought her and her  children from Mr. K----, who had offered them to him, saying that they  would be rather troublesome to him than otherwise down where he was  going; 'and so,' said Mr. O----, 'as I had no objection to investing a  little money that way, I bought them.' With a heart much lightened I flew  to tell poor Psyche the news, so that at any rate she might be relieved  from the dread of any immediate separation from her husband. You can  imagine better than I can tell you what her sensations were; but she  still renewed her prayer that I would, if possible, induce Mr. ---- to  purchase her, and I promised to do so.    Early the next morning, while I was still dressing, I was suddenly  startled by hearing voices in loud tones in Mr. ----'s dressing-room,  which adjoins my bed-room, and the noise increasing until there was an  absolute cry of despair uttered by some man. I could restrain myself no  longer, but opened the door of communication, and saw Joe, the young man,  poor Psyche's husband, raving almost in a state of frenzy, and in a voice  broken with sobs and almost inarticulate with passion, reiterating his  determination never to leave this plantation, never to go to Alabama,  never to leave his old father and mother, his poor wife and children, and  dashing his hat, which he was wringing like a cloth in his hands, upon the  ground, he declared he would kill himself if he was compelled to follow  Mr. K----. I glanced from the poor wretch to Mr. ----, who was standing,  leaning against a table with his arms folded, occasionally uttering a few  words of counsel to his slave to be quiet and not fret, and not make a  fuss about what there was no help for. I retreated immediately from the  horrid scene, breathless with surprise and dismay, and stood for some time  in my own room, with my heart and temples throbbing to such a degree that  I could hardly support myself. As soon as I recovered myself I again  sought Mr. O----, and enquired of him if he knew the cause of poor Joe's  distress. He then told me that Mr. ----, who is highly pleased with Mr.  K----'s past administration of his property, wished, on his departure for  his newly-acquired slave plantation, to give him some token of his  satisfaction, and _had made him a present_ of the man Joe, who had"]]]
