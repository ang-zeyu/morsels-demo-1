I ought to have warned you; but it is not too late. There  will certainly be a fourth, who will follow the example of the others.  _Il n'y a que le premier pas qui coute_.\"    Saying this, Toubac took a seat on the corner of my trunk, struck his  match-box, lighted his pipe, and blew three or four powerful whiffs of  smoke with a meditative air.    \"My faith,\" said he, \"I am not fearful; but, if I had full permission  to pass the night in that chamber, I should much prefer to sleep  elsewhere.    \"Listen, Master Christian. Nine or ten months ago a good man of  Tuebingen, wholesale dealer in furs, dismounted at the Inn Boeuf-Gras.  He called for supper; he ate well; he drank well; and was finally  conducted to that room in the third story--it is called the Green Room.  Well, the next morning he was found hanging to the crossbeam of the  signboard.    \"Well, that might do _for once_; nothing could be said.    \"Every proper investigation was made, and the stranger was buried at  the bottom of the garden. But, look you, about six months afterwards a  brave soldier from Neustadt arrived; he had received his final  discharge, and was rejoicing in the thought of returning to his native  village. During the whole evening, while emptying his wine cups, he  spoke fondly of his little cousin who was waiting to marry him. At last  this big monsieur was conducted to his room--the Green Room--and, the  same night, the watchman, passing down the street Minnesaenger,  perceived something hanging to the crossbeam; he raised his lantern,  and lo! it was the soldier, with his final discharge in a bow on his  left hip, and his hands gathered up to the seam of his pantaloons, as  if on parade.    \"'Truth to say, this is extraordinary!' cried the burgomaster; 'the  devil's to pay.' Well, the chamber was much visited; the walls were  replastered, and the dead man was sent to Neustadt.    \"The registrar wrote this marginal note:    \"'Died of apoplexy.'    \"All Nuremberg was enraged against the innkeeper. There were many,  indeed, who wished to force him to take down his iron crossbeam, under  the pretext that it inspired people with dangerous ideas; but you may  well believe that old Michael Schmidt would not lend his ear to this  proposition.    \"'This crossbeam,' said he, 'was placed here by my grandfather; it has  borne the sign of Boeuf-Gras for one hundred and fifty years, from  father to son; it harms no one, not even the hay wagons which pass  beneath, for it is thirty feet above them. Those who don't like it can  turn their heads aside, and not see it.'    \"Well, gradually the town calmed down, and, during several months, no  new event agitated it. Unhappily, a student of Heidelberg, returning to  the university, stopped, day before yesterday, at the Inn Boeuf-Gras,  and asked for lodging. He was the son of a minister of the gospel.    \"How could anyone suppose that the son of a pastor could conceive the  idea of hanging himself on the crossbeam of a signboard, because a big  monsieur and an old soldier had done so? We must admit, Master  Christian, that the thing was not probable; these reasons would not  have seemed sufficient to myself or to you.\"    \"Enough, enough!\" I exclaimed; \"this is too horrible! I see a frightful  mystery involved in all this. It is not the crossbeam; it is not the  room--\"    \"What! Do you suspect the innkeeper, the most honest man in the world,  and belonging to one of the oldest families in Nuremberg?\"    \"No, no; may God preserve me from indulging in unjust suspicions! but  there is an abyss before me, into which I scarcely dare glance.\"    \"You are right,\" said Toubac, astonished at the violence of my  excitement. \"We will speak of other things. Apropos, Master Christian,  where is our landscape of 'Saint Odille'?\"    This question brought me back to the world of realities. I showed the  old man the painting I had just completed. The affair was soon  concluded, and Toubac, well satisfied, descended the ladder, entreating  me to think no more of the student of Heidelberg.    I would gladly have followed my good friend's counsel; but, when the  devil once mixes himself up in our concerns, it is not easy to  disembarrass ourselves of him.    In my solitary hours all these events were reproduced with frightful  distinctness in my mind.    \"This old wretch,\" I said to myself, \"is the cause of it all; she alone  has conceived these crimes, and has consummated them. But by what  means? Has she had recourse to cunning alone, or has she obtained the  intervention of invisible powers?\" I walked to and fro in my retreat.  An inward voice cried out: \"It is not in vain that Providence permitted  you to see Fledermausse contemplating the agonies of her victim. It is  not in vain that the soul of the poor young man came in the form of a  butterfly of the night to awake you. No, no; all this was not  accidental, Christian. The heavens impose upon you a terrible mission.  If you do not accomplish it, tremble lest you fall yourself into the  hands of the old murderess! Perhaps, at this moment, she is preparing  her snares in the darkness.\"    During several days these hideous images followed me without  intermission. I lost my sleep; it was impossible for me to do anything;  my brush fell from my hand; and, horrible to confess, I found myself  sometimes gazing at the crossbeam with a sort of complacency. At last I  could endure it no longer, and one evening I descended the ladder and  hid myself behind the door of Fledermausse, hoping to surprise her  fatal secret.    From that time no day passed in which I was not _en route_, following  the old wretch, watching, spying, never losing sight of her; but she  was so cunning, had a scent so subtile that, without even turning her  head, she knew I was behind her.    However, she feigned not to perceive this; she went to the market, to  the butcher's, like any good, simple woman, only hastening her steps  and murmuring confused words.    At the close of the month I saw that it was impossible for me to attain  my object in this way, and this conviction made me inexpressibly sad.    \"What can I do?\" I said to myself. \"The old woman divines my plans;  she is on her guard; every hope abandons me. Ah! old hag, you think  you already see me at the end of your rope.\" I was continually asking  myself this question: \"What can I do? what can I do?\" At last a  luminous idea struck me. My chamber overlooked the house of  Fledermausse; but there was no window on this side. I adroitly raised  a slate, and no pen could paint my joy when the whole ancient building  was thus exposed to me. \"At last, I have you!\" I exclaimed; \"you  cannot escape me now; from here I can see all that passes--your  goings, your comings, your arts and snares. You will not suspect this  invisible eye--this watchful eye, which will surprise crime at the  moment it blooms. Oh, Justice, Justice! She marches slowly; but she  arrives.\"    Nothing could be more sinister than the den now spread out before me--a  great courtyard, the large slabs of which were covered with moss; in  one corner, a well, whose stagnant waters you shuddered to look upon; a  stairway covered with old shells; at the farther end a gallery, with  wooden balustrade, and hanging upon it some old linen and the tick of  an old straw mattress; on the first floor, to the left, the stone  covering of a common sewer indicated the kitchen; to the right the  lofty windows of the building looked out upon the street; then a few  pots of dried, withered flowers--all was cracked, somber, moist. Only  one or two hours during the day could the sun penetrate this loathsome  spot; after that, the shadows took possession; then the sunshine fell  upon the crazy walls, the worm-eaten balcony, the dull and tarnished  glass, and upon the whirlwind of atoms floating in its golden rays,  disturbed by no breath of air.    I had scarcely finished these observations and reflections, when the  old woman entered, having just returned from market. I heard the  grating of her heavy door. Then she appeared with her basket. She  seemed fatigued--almost out of breath. The lace of her bonnet fell to  her nose. With one hand she grasped the banister and ascended the  stairs.    The heat was intolerable, suffocating; it was precisely one of those  days in which all insects--crickets, spiders, mosquitoes, etc.--make  old ruins resound with their strange sounds.    Fledermausse crossed the gallery slowly, like an old ferret who feels  at home. She remained more than a quarter of an hour in the kitchen,  then returned, spread out her linen, took the broom, and brushed away  some blades of straw on the floor. At last she raised her head, and  turned her little green eyes in every direction, searching,  investigating carefully.    Could she, by some strange intuition, suspect anything? I do not know;  but I gently lowered the slate, and gave up my watch for the day.    In the morning Fledermausse appeared reassured. One angle of light  fell upon the gallery. In passing, she caught a fly on the wing, and  presented it delicately to a spider established in a corner of the  roof. This spider was so bloated that, notwithstanding the distance, I  saw it descend from round to round, then glide along a fine web, like  a drop of venom, seize its prey from the hands of the old shrew, and  remount rapidly. Fledermausse looked at it very attentively, with her  eyes half closed; then sneezed, and said to herself, in a jeering  tone, \"God bless you, beautiful one; God bless you!\"    I watched during six weeks, and could discover nothing concerning the  power of Fledermausse. Sometimes, seated upon a stool, she peeled her  potatoes, then hung out her linen upon the balustrade.    Sometimes I saw her spinning; but she never sang, as good, kind old  women are accustomed to do, their trembling voices mingling well with  the humming of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12774"],[0,"Dave Darrin's First Year at Annapolis (#19)"],[1,"'s way to hold a grudge forever.  He extended  his own hand to take Brimmer's.    \"And I hope you'll let me know you better,\" continued Brimmer,  turning to Dan Dalzell.    \"Most people who know me at all think they know me too well,\"  laughed Dan, but he held out his hand.    Perhaps, in other walks of life, the chums might have been more  wary about accepting Brimmer's suddenly proffered friendship,  as they stood in the open air just after dinner one November day.  The weather was so fine and mild that it seemed a shame to be  cooped up between walls.  Back in the High School days, for instance,  Dave and Dan would have been more cautious in accepting such an  offer of friendship.  But at the U.S. Naval Academy the atmosphere  is wholly different.  The midshipmen are ranked as gentlemen,  and all are so taken on trust unless they betray themselves as  dishonorable.  Ninety-nine per cent of the young men are earnest,  honest and wholly aboveboard.    After that, during the next two or three weeks, Brimmer cultivated  the acquaintance of Darrin and Dalzell at every possible opportunity.  Often, in the evening, he came hastening to their room for a short  visit after the release bell had sounded at 9.30.  When he called,  Brimmer always remained until the warning call just before taps.    \"It took you a long while to find out that Dave Darrin is white  enough to shake hands with,\" laughed Farley, one day.    \"As I remember, it took you quite a little while, also, to find  it out,\" laughed Brimmer.  \"I admit that I am slow at forming  my friendships.  But there's no mistake about Darrin, when you get  to know him.  He's about the finest fellow in the class.\"    \"He certainly is,\" nodded Farley heartily.    Being shorn of the long list of unjustly-given demerits that had  stood against his name, Darrin was now in the first conduct grade.  So was Dan.  That gave to both considerable in the way of privileges.  On Saturdays and Sundays, for instance, they were at liberty  to accept invitations to call on or dine at the houses of officers  and their families.  This privilege, while pleasant to possess,  amounted to little, for Dave and Dan had been too busy over their  studies to have any opportunity to attract social notice.    As to dancing, fourth class men do not, by tradition, attend any  of the midshipmen's hops, which are reserved for upper class men.    Neither is a plebe midshipman expected to be seen escorting young  ladies.  In fact, the plebe has no social pleasures within the  academy walls.    Outside, however, it is different.  If the fourth class men are  acquainted with young ladies in the town of Annapolis they may  visit them on Saturday afternoons when so invited.    Here, again, Dave and Dan found no delight.  For they became acquainted  with none of the girls of Annapolis.    They could, however, on Saturday afternoon secure permission to  go into the town.  Any change outside of the Academy walls now  became welcome, though our young midshipmen had no other form  of pleasure than merely to stroll through the streets of the town  and occasionally regale themselves with a dish of ice-cream or  a glass of soda at Wiegard's.    Brimmer, one Saturday afternoon, when strolling through the town,  discovered a new little shop on Main Street.    This was a little store that had just been fitted up.  Some fruit  was displayed for sale, though the main business of the place  appeared to be the dispensing of various temperance drinks.    On the sign over the door the proprietor's first name was given  as \"Tony.\"  The second name was an unpronounceable Greek one.    Being thirsty Brimmer stepped inside.    \"Are you Tony?\" he asked of the swarthy young man behind the counter.    \"Yes, sare,\" grinned Tony.  \"What you drink?\"    Brimmer looked over the stock, selected a bottle of ginger ale  and paid for it.    \"Business good?\" asked the midshipman.    \"No, sare; ver' bad,\" replied Tony sadly.    \"Oh, well, it will pick up by-and-by.\"    \"I hope so, sare.  But when I come here I think maybe the midsheepmen  come see me offen.  You, sare, first midsheepman who came here.\"    \"You have a neat little place,\" continued Brimmer.  \"And this  ginger ale,\" holding up his glass, \"is good.  You'll have trade  enough by-and-by.\"    \"You tell other midsheepmen they come here, sare?\" asked Tony  hopefully.    \"Why, yes; I think perhaps I can send you a bit of trade,\" replied  Brimmer.  The young man's father was a politician, and a prosperous  one.  The son had learned the wisdom of making friends wherever  he could, since there could be no telling when a friend anywhere  might be useful.    \"You come with me, sare,\" urged Tony, taking a gentle hold on  Brimmer's arm, and leading him to the rear of the store.    Tony threw open a door, revealing a rear room in which were three  tables.    \"Maybe midsheepmen like play cards, sometimes,\" suggested Tony,  with a grin.    \"Great!\" cried Brimmer.  \"Yes; sometimes the fellows do like to  know a quiet little place where they can have a good game without  a discipline officer butting in.  Good enough; I'll tell some  of the fellows about this place; but you must keep it quiet, and  not let anyone else into that room.\"    \"For midsheepmen on'y,\" promised Tony solemnly.    \"Good enough, then,\" smiled Mr. Brimmer.  \"I'll bring you a party  as soon as possible.\"    \"Then you make me your frien', sare,\" protested the Greek.    As Brimmer went strolling along the street, after that, a plan  began rapidly to hatch in his mind.  He thought he saw how Tony  could made a most valuable ally.    As luck would have it, Brimmer was not long in meeting three midshipmen  of rather wild tendencies.  To them he proposed a quiet little  game of cards.  He led his classmates back to Tony's.  Here they  regaled themselves with ginger ale, then passed on into the rear  room.  For more than two hours the midshipmen remained here.  Occasionally they called for more of the temperance drinks.  As  they left Brimmer passed Tony a two-dollar bill, for this midshipman  disregarded the regulations in that he frequently received money  from home and was always well supplied.    \"Thank you, sare,\" cried Tony, bowing very low, indeed.    The following Saturday Brimmer returned to the little shop with  a small party of friends.    Late that afternoon Tony was richer by a few dollars.    \"You one ver' good frien', sare,\" protested the delighted Tony.  \"Me?  I your ver' good frien', too.  I do anything for you,  sare--try me!\"    \"I'm getting Tony about where I want him,\" thought Mr. Brimmer.  \"Just a little more help to him, and then I'll spring my idea  on him.\"    Thanksgiving had gone by, and now the Christmas Holidays were  nearing.  Brimmer was playing his game slowly, and without the  slightest risk to himself.  Tony must take all the risk.  If the  Greek got into any trouble Brimmer could deny all knowledge of  the matter.    One Saturday afternoon, just before Christmas Midshipman Brimmer  came down Main Street, looked in and found the Greek standing  alone in his shop.    \"Howdy, Tony,\" was the midshipman's greeting, as he sauntered  into the store.    \"Hullo, my good frien', sare.\"    \"Wish you a Merry Christmas, Tony.\"    \"I don' know, sare, I don' know,\" replied the Greek, shaking his  head.    \"Why, isn't business good now, Tony?\"    \"You do ver' much, my frien', to help make it better,\" replied  Tony, shaking his head, \"but still I not make much money.\"    \"Are you hard up at Christmas, Tony?\" asked Brimmer, with pretended  sympathy.    \"Oh, yes, sare; all time hard up.\"    At that moment Brimmer's gleaming eyes saw Dave Darrin and Dan  Dalzell passing on the other side of the street.    \"Quick, Tony!  Get a look at my friends over there!\" whispered  Brimmer.  \"Take such a good look that you will know them again  anywhere.  Now, it's the one on the inside, especially.  Note  him sharply, Tony.\"    \"I never mistake him again, sare, eff I see him,\" replied the  Greek gravely.    \"Do you see many of these ten-dollar bills nowadays, Tony?\" questioned  Brimmer, carelessly displaying a banknote.    The Greek shook his head wistfully.    \"This is yours now, Tony; and twice as much more afterwards, if  you do what I want of you.  It's a good joke that I want to play  on a midshipman down at the Academy.\"    \"A joke, eh?\" repeated the Greek.  \"Then, sare, my frien', it  can't be anything so ver' bad, eef it only a joke.\"    \"Oh, it isn't anything bad,\" Brimmer lied cheerfully.  \"But that  fellow played a warm one on me, and I want to pay him back.\"    \"I understand, sare, my ver' good frien'.\"    Inside of five minutes Tony understood very much better.  Still,  the Greek saw no real harm in what he now engaged himself to do.    That night Tony slept with Brimmer's ten-dollar note under his  pillow.  Dave Darrin slept as soundly as ever, unconscious of  harm hanging over his head.    Midshipman Brimmer did much gleeful chuckling after taps, as he  lay on the bed in the room that Henkel had once shared with him.    \"Now, let's see anyone get a chance to bring this job back to  me!\" laughed Brimmer.  \"And goodby, Darrin!  The Naval Academy  won't know you much longer!\"          CHAPTER XVII    TONY BAITS THE HOOK      Up to this time Darrin had dropped in at Tony's but once, and  Dan not at all.    The Saturday after Christmas was an anxious one for nearly all  of the midshipmen.  Only a few availed themselves of any privilege  of going into Annapolis this Saturday afternoon.  Most of the  young men remained in their rooms at Bancroft Hall, anxiously  going over the work in which they were soon to take their semi-annual  examinations.    Especially was this true of the fourth class men in the \"wooden\"  or lowest sections.  Most of these men knew that, if they succeeded  in staying on at all, it would be by a very small margin indeed.  Even the men in the \"savvy sections,\" with the highest marks  of their class,"]]]
