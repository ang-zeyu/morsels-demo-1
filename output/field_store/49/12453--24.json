It is, however, a mistake in  the _Bibliotheque Universelle_, tome xxxvi. p. 210, to state that Beethoven  during Rode's stay in Vienna composed the \"delicieuse Romance\" which was  played with so much expression by De Baillot on the violin. There are only  two Romances known for the violin by Beethoven, the one in G major, Op. 40,  in the year 1803, and the second in F major, Op. 50, published in 1805.  (Thayer, 102 and 104.)]      97.    TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.    1813.    I had just gone out yesterday when your gracious letter reached me. As for  my health, it is pretty much the same, particularly as moral causes affect  it, which do not seem likely to be removed; particularly as I can have  recourse to no one but myself for aid, and can find help in my own head  alone; and more particularly still, because in these days neither words,  nor honor, nor written pledges, seem binding on any one. As for my  occupations, I have come to an end with some of them, and, even without  your gracious invitation, I intended to appear at the usual hour to-day.  With regard to Rode [see No. 96], I beg Y.R.H. to be so good as to let me  have the part by the bearer of this, and I will send it to him at once,  with a polite note from me. _He certainly will not take amiss my sending  him the part. Oh! certainly not! Would to Heaven that I were obliged to ask  his forgiveness on this account! for in that case things would really be in  a better position._ Is it your pleasure that I should come to you this  evening at five o'clock as usual, or does Y.R.H. desire another hour? I  shall endeavor to arrange accordingly, and punctually to fulfil your  wishes.    [K.]      98.    TO PRINCESS KINSKY.    Vienna, Feb. 12, 1813.    YOUR HIGHNESS!--    You were so gracious as to declare with regard to the salary settled on me  by your deceased husband, that you saw the propriety of my receiving it in  Vienna currency, but that the authority of the court of law which has  assumed the guardianship of the estate must first be obtained. Under the  conviction that the authorities who represent their princely wards could  not fail to be influenced by the same motives that actuated the late Prince  in his conduct towards me, I think I am justified in expecting the  ratification of my claim from the aforesaid court, as I can prove, by the  testimony of well-known, respectable, and upright men, the promise and  intentions of H.H. in my behalf, which cannot fail to be binding on his  heirs and children. If, therefore, the proofs submitted should even be  found deficient in legal formality, I cannot doubt that this want will be  supplied by the noble mode of thinking of this illustrious house, and by  their own inclination to generous actions.    Possibly another question may at present arise from the condition of the  inheritance, which is no doubt heavily burdened, both owing to the  melancholy and sudden death of the late Prince, and by the state of the  times, which renders it equally just and indispensable to husband carefully  all possible resources. On this account it is far from my wish to claim  more than is absolutely necessary for my own livelihood, and grounded on  the contract itself,--the legality of such a claim on the heirs of the late  Prince not being in any way disputed.    I beg, then, that Y.H. will be pleased to direct the arrears of my salary,  due since the 1st September, 1811, calculated in Vienna currency, in  accordance with the scale of the contract, making in W.W. 1088 florins 42  kreuzers, to be paid, and _in the interim_, the question whether this  salary ought to be paid in Vienna currency can be deferred until the  affairs are settled, when the subject is again brought before the trustees,  and my claims admitted to be just by their consent and authority. The late  Prince having given me sixty ducats merely on account of my salary, which  was to be paid by agreement in Vienna currency, and as this agreement (as  every intelligent man will inform Y.H.) must be accepted to its full  extent, or at all events not cause me loss, it follows as a matter of  course that Y.H. will not object to my considering the sixty ducats as only  an instalment of the arrears due to me beyond the usual scale of payment,  agreed to be paid in Vienna currency, so that the amount must not be  deducted from the sum still due to me.    I feel sure that Y.H.'s noble feelings will do justice to the equity of my  proposal, and my wish to enter into every detail of this affair, so far as  circumstances permit, and also my readiness to postpone my claims to suit  your convenience. The same elevated sentiments which prompted you to fulfil  the engagement entered into by the late Prince, will also make Y.H.  apprehend the absolute necessity entailed on me by my position again to  solicit immediate payment of the arrears of my salary, which are  indispensable for my maintenance.    Anxiously hoping for a favorable answer to my petition, I have the honor to  remain, with profound respect,    Y.R.H.'s obedient servant,    LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.      99.    TO PRINCESS KINSKY.    HIGHLY HONORED PRINCESS!--    As the Prince's counsel declared that my claim could not be heard till the  choice of a guardian had been made, and as I now hear that Y.H. has been  graciously pleased yourself to assume that office, but decline receiving  any one, I present my humble petition in writing, requesting at the same  time your early consideration; for you can easily understand that, relying  on a thing as a certainty, it is painful to be so long deprived of it,  especially as I am obliged entirely to support an unfortunate sickly  brother and his whole family,[1] which (not computing my own wants) has  entirely exhausted my resources, having expected to provide for myself by  the payment of my salary. You may perceive the justice of my claims from  the fact of my faithfully naming the receipt of the sixty ducats, advanced  to me by the late Prince in Prague, the Prince's counsel himself declaring  that I might have said nothing about this sum, the late Prince not having  mentioned it either to him or to his cashier.    Forgive my being obliged to intrude this affair on you, but necessity  compels me to do so. Some days hence I shall take the liberty of making  inquiries on the subject from the Prince's counsel, or from any one Y.H.  may appoint.    I remain, most esteemed and illustrious Princess,    Your devoted servant,    LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: See a letter to Ries, Nov. 22d, 1815:--\"He was consumptive for  some years, and, in order to make his life easier, I can safely compute  what I gave him at 10,000 florins W.W.\"]      100.    TO ZMESKALL.    DEAR Z.,--    Forward the accompanying letter to-day without fail to Brunswick, that it  may arrive as soon and as safely as possible. Excuse the trouble I give  you. I have been again applied to, to send some of my works to Gratz, in  Styria, for a concert to be given in aid of the Ursuline convent and its  schools: last year they had very large receipts by this means. Including  this concert, and one I gave in Carlsbad for the benefit of the sufferers  from fire at Baden, three concerts have been given by me, and through me,  for benevolent purposes in one year; and yet if I ask a favor, people are  as deaf as a post. Your    BEETHOVEN.    I. Letter to Sclowonowitsch (Maitre des bureaux des postes) in Cassel. I  can no longer do without the books of Tiedge and Frau von der Recke, as I  am expected to give some opinion about them.      101.    TO HERR JOSEPH VARENNA,--GRATZ.    MY GOOD SIR,--    Rode was not quite correct in all that he said of me; my health is not  particularly good, and from no fault of my own,--my present condition being  the most unfortunate of my life. But neither this nor anything in the world  shall prevent me from assisting, so far as it lies in my power, the  innocent and distressed ladies of your convent by my poor works. I  therefore place at your disposal two new symphonies, a bass aria with  chorus, and several minor choruses; if you desire again to perform  \"Hungaria's Benefactors,\" which you gave last year, it is also at your  service. Among the choruses you will find a \"Dervise Chorus,\" a capital  bait for a mixed public.    In my opinion, your best plan would be to select a day when you could give  the \"Mount of Olives,\" which has been everywhere performed. This would  occupy one half of the concert, and the other half might consist of a new  symphony, the overtures, and various choruses, and likewise the above-named  bass aria and chorus; thus the evening would not be devoid of variety. But  you can settle all this more satisfactorily with the aid of your own  musical authorities. I think I can guess what you mean about a gratuity for  me from a _third person_. Were I in the same position as formerly, I would  at once say, \"Beethoven never accepts anything _where the benefit of  humanity is concerned_;\" but owing to my own too great benevolence I am  reduced to a low ebb, the cause of which, however, does not put me to  shame, being combined with other circumstances for which men devoid of  honor and principle are alone to blame; so I do not hesitate to say that I  would not refuse the contribution of the rich man to whom you allude.[1]  But there is no question here of any _claim_. If, however, the affair with  the _third person_ comes to nothing, pray rest assured that I shall be  equally disposed to confer the same benefit as last year on my friends the  respected Ursuline ladies, and shall at all times be ready to succor the  poor and needy so long as I live. And now farewell! Write soon, and I will  zealously strive to make all necessary arrangements. My best wishes for the  convent.    I am, with esteem, your friend,    LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: Reichardt, on the 1st March, 1809, writes in his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13097"],[0,"Lives of the Most Remarkable Criminals Who have been Condemned and Executed for (#19)"],[1,"Hawes,        The equity of the Law of England, more tender of the lives of its      subjects than any other in the world, allows no person to be put to      death, either unheard or without the positive proof against him of      the fact whereon he stands charged; and that proof, too, must be      such as shall satisfy twelve men who are his equals, and by whose      verdict he is to be tried. And surely no method can be devised      fuller than this is, as well of compassion, as of Justice. But then      it is required that the person to be tried shall aver his innocence      by pleading Not Guilty to his indictment, which contains the charge.      You have heard that which the grand jury have found against you. You      see here twelve honest men ready to enquire impartially into the      evidence that shall be given against you. The Court, such is the      humanity of our constitution, is counsel for you as you are a      prisoner. What hinders then, that you should submit to so fair, so      equal a trial; and wherefore will you, by a brutish obstinacy, draw      upon you that heavy judgement which the Law has appointed for those      who seem to have lost the rational faculties of men?    To this Hawes impudently made answer, that the Court was formerly a  place of Justice, but now it was become a place of injustice; that he  doubted not but that they would receive a severer sentence than that  which they had pronounced upon him; and that for his part, he made no  question of dying with the same resolution with which he had often  beheld death, and would leave the world with the same courage with which  he had lived in it.    Natt thought this a most glorious instance of his courage, and when some  of his companions said jestingly, that he chose pressing because the  Court would not let him have a good suit of clothes to be hanged in, he  replied, with a great deal of warmth, that it was no such thing, but  that as he had lived with the character of the boldest fellow of his  profession he was resolved to die with it, and leave his memory to be  admired by all the gentlemen of the road in succeeding ages. This was  the rant which took up the poor fellow's head, and induced him to bear  250 pound weight upon his breast for upwards of seven minutes, and was  much the same kind of bravery as that which induced the French lacquey  to dance a minuet immediately before he danced his last upon the wheel,  an action which made so much noise in France as engaged the Duke de  Rochefoucauld to compare it with the death of Cato.    Hawes, indeed, did not persist quite so long, but submitted to that  justice which he saw was unavoidable, after he had endured, as I have  said before, so great a weight in the press. The bruises he received on  the chest pained him so exceedingly during the short remainder of his  life that he was hardly able to perform those devotions which the near  approach of death made him desirous to offer up for so profligate a  life. He laid aside, then, those wild notions which had been so fatal to  him through the whole course of his days, and so remarkably unfortunate  to him in this last age of life. He confessed frankly what crimes he  could remember and seemed very desirous of acquitting some innocent  persons who were at that time imprisoned, or suspected, for certain  villainies which were committed by Hawes and his gang; particularly a  footman, then in the Poultry Compter, and a man's son at an alehouse,  who, though Hawes declared he knew no harm of him, yet at the place of  execution he said that as he desired his death might be a warning to all  in general, so he wished it might be particularly considered by him.  Though, as I have said, he was fully convinced of the folly of those  notions which he had formerly entertained, yet he did not, as most of  those braves do, go from one degree of extravagance to the other, that  is, from daring everything to sinking into the meanest cowardice, for  Hawes went to his death very composedly, as he had received the  Sacrament the day before, with all the outward marks of devotion. He  suffered on the 22nd day of September, 1721, at which time he was scarce  twenty years of age.    FOOTNOTES:       [14] This was the Clerkenwell House of Detention, where          prisoners were sent after being sentenced, pending their          disposal at a House of Correction. It was originally intended          for the overflow from Newgate. The prison stood in Clerkenwell          Close.          The Life of JOHN JONES, a Pickpocket      There is not, perhaps, a greater misfortune to young people than that  too great tenderness and compassion with which they are treated in their  youth, and those hopes of amendment which their relations flatter  themselves with as they grow up. If they could suffer themselves to be  guided by experience, they would quickly find that sagacious minds do  but increase in wickedness as they increase in years. Timely services,  therefore, and proper restraints are the only methods with which such  persons are to be treated, for minds disposed to such gross impurities  as those which lead to such wickednesses or are rendered capital by Law,  are seldom to be prevailed on by gentleness, or admonitions unseconded  by harsher means. I am very far from being an advocate for great  severities towards young people, but I confess in cases like these, I  think they are as necessary as amputations, where the distemper has  spread so far that no cure is to be hoped for by any other means. If the  relations of John Jones had known and practised these methods, it is  highly probable he had escaped the suffering and the shame of that  ignominious death to which, after a long persisting in his crimes, he at  last came.    [Illustration: A PRISONER UNDER PRESSURE IN NEWGATE    Accused men who refused to plead to their indictment might be pressed to  death. Edward Burnworth carried 424 lb. on his chest for an hour and  three minutes before he consented to plead    _(From the Newgate Calendar)_]    This malefactor was born in the parish of St. Andrew's, Holborn, of  parents in tolerable circumstances, who, while a boy, indulged him in  all his little humours from a wise expectation of their dropping from  him all at once when he grew up. But this expectation not succeeding, as  it must be owned there was no great probability it should, they were  then for persuading him to settle in business. That he might do this  with less reluctancy they were so kind as to put him out upon liking to  three or four trades; but it happening unluckily that there was work to  be done in all of them, Jones could not be brought to go apprentice to  any, but idled on amongst his companions, without ever thinking of  applying himself to any business whatever. His relations sent him to  sea, another odd academy to learn honesty at, and on his return from  thence, and refusing to go any more, his relations refused to support  him any longer.    Jack was very melancholy on this score, and having but eighteenpence in  the world when he received the comfortable message of his never being to  expect a farthing more from his friends, he went out to take a walk in  Hyde Park to divert his melancholy, when he ruminated on what he was to  do next for a livelihood. In the midst of these reflections he espied an  old schoolfellow of his, who used to have the same inclinations with  himself. There had been a great intimacy between them; it was quickly  renewed, and Jack Jones unburdened to him the whole budget of his  sorrows. _And is this all?_ says the young fellow. _Why, I will put you  in a way to ease this in a minute, if you will step along with me to a  house hard by, where I am to meet with some of my acquaintance._ Jones  readily consented, and to a little blind alehouse in a dark lane they  went. The woman of the house received them very kindly, and as soon as  Jack's companion had informed her that he was a newcomer, she conducted  him into a little room, where she entertained him with a good dinner and  a bowl of punch after it. Jack was mightily taken with the courtesy of  his landlady, who promised him he should never want such usage and his  friend would teach him in the evening how to earn it.    Evening came, and out walked the two young men. Jack was put upon  nothing at that time, but to observe how his companion managed. He was a  very dexterous youth, and at seven o'clock prayers picked up, in half an  hour's time, three good handkerchiefs, and a silver snuff-box. Having  this readily shown him the practice, he was no less courteous in  acquainting Jones with the theory of his profession, and two or three  night's work made Jones a very complete workman in their way.    He lived at this rate for some months, until going with his instructor  through King Street, Westminster, and passing by a woman pretty well  dressed, says the other fellow to Jones, _Now mind, Jack, and while  jostle her against the wall, do you whip off her pocket._ Jones  performed tolerably well, though the woman screamed out and people were  thick in the street. He gave the pocket, as soon as he had plucked it  off, to his comrade, but having felt it rather weighty, would trust him  no farther than the first by-alley before they stopped to examine its  contents.    They had scarce found their prize consisted of no more than a small  prayer-book, a needle case, and a silver thimble, when the woman with a  mob at her heels bolted upon them and seized them. Jones had the pocket  in his hand when they laid hold of him, and his associate no sooner  perceived the danger, but he clapped hold of him by the collar and cried  out as loud as any of the mob, _Ay, ay, this is he, good woman, is not  this your pocket?_ By this strategem he escaped, and Jones was left to  feel the whole weight of the punishment which was ready to fall upon  them. He was immediately committed to prison, and the"]]]
