I'd kill him again!\"    And he looked us fiercely in the face, a fine defiance in his  dissipated eyes; his breast heaving, his jaw like a rock.    \"Shall I tell you how it happened?\" he went passionately on.  \"He's  made my life a hell these weeks and months past.  You may know that.  A  perfect hell!  Well, to-night I met him in Bond Street.  Do you  remember when I met you fellows?  He wasn't twenty yards behind you; he  was on your tracks, Raffles; he saw me nod to you, and stopped me and  asked me who you were.  He seemed as keen as knives to know, I couldn't  think why, and didn't care either, for I saw my chance.  I said I'd  tell him all about you if he'd give me a private interview.  He said he  wouldn't.  I said he should, and held him by the coat; by the time I  let him go you were out of sight, and I waited where I was till he came  back in despair.  I had the whip-hand of him then.  I could dictate  where the interview should be, and I made him take me home with him,  still swearing to tell him all about you when we'd had our talk.  Well,  when we got here I made him give me something to eat, putting him off  and off; and about ten o'clock I heard the gate shut.  I waited a bit,  and then asked him if he lived alone.    \"'Not at all,' says he; 'did you not see the servant?'    \"I said I'd seen her, but I thought I'd heard her go; if I was mistaken  no doubt she would come when she was called; and I yelled three times  at the top of my voice.  Of course there was no servant to come.  I  knew that, because I came to see him one night last week, and he  interviewed me himself through the gate, but wouldn't open it. Well,  when I had done yelling, and not a soul had come near us, he was as  white as that ceiling. Then I told him we could have our chat at last;  and I picked the poker out of the fender, and told him how he'd robbed  me, but, by God, he shouldn't rob me any more.  I gave him three  minutes to write and sign a settlement of all his iniquitous claims  against me, or have his brains beaten out over his own carpet.  He  thought a minute, and then went to his desk for pen and paper.  In two  seconds he was round like lightning with a revolver, and I went for him  bald-headed.  He fired two or three times and missed; you can find the  holes if you like; but I hit him every time--my God!  I was like a  savage till the thing was done. And then I didn't care.  I went through  his desk looking for my own bills, and was coming away when you turned  up.  I said I didn't care, nor do I; but I was going to give myself up  to-night, and shall still; so you see I sha'n't give you fellows much  trouble!\"    He was done; and there we stood on the landing of the lonely house, the  low, thick, eager voice still racing and ringing through our ears; the  dead man below, and in front of us his impenitent slayer.  I knew to  whom the impenitence would appeal when he had heard the story, and I  was not mistaken.    \"That's all rot,\" said Raffles, speaking after a pause; \"we sha'n't let  you give yourself up.\"    \"You sha'n't stop me!  What would be the good?  The woman saw me; it  would only be a question of time; and I can't face waiting to be taken.  Think of it: waiting for them to touch you on the shoulder!  No, no,  no; I'll give myself up and get it over.\"    His speech was changed; he faltered, floundered. It was as though a  clearer perception of his position had come with the bare idea of  escape from it.    \"But listen to me,\" urged Raffles; \"We're here at our peril ourselves.  We broke in like thieves to enforce redress for a grievance very like  your own.  But don't you see?  We took out a pane--did the thing like  regular burglars.  Regular burglars will get the credit of all the  rest!\"    \"You mean that I sha'n't be suspected?\"    \"I do.\"    \"But I don't want to get off scotfree,\" cried Rutter hysterically.  \"I've killed him.  I know that.  But it was in self-defence; it wasn't  murder.  I must own up and take the consequences. I shall go mad if I  don't!\"    His hands twitched; his lips quivered; the tears were in his eyes.  Raffles took him roughly by the shoulder.    \"Look here, you fool!  If the three of us were caught here now, do you  know what those consequences would be?  We should swing in a row at  Newgate in six weeks' time!  You talk as though we were sitting in a  club; don't you know it's one o'clock in the morning, and the lights  on, and a dead man down below?  For God's sake pull yourself together,  and do what I tell you, or you're a dead man yourself.\"    \"I wish I was one!\" Rutter sobbed.  \"I wish I had his revolver to blow  my own brains out. It's lying under him.  O my God, my God!\"    His knees knocked together: the frenzy of reaction was at its height.  We had to take him downstairs between us, and so through the front door  out into the open air.    All was still outside--all but the smothered weeping of the unstrung  wretch upon our hands.  Raffles returned for a moment to the house;  then all was dark as well.  The gate opened from within; we closed it  carefully behind us; and so left the starlight shining on broken glass  and polished spikes, one and all as we had found them.    We escaped; no need to dwell on our escape.  Our murderer seemed set  upon the scaffold--drunk with his deed, he was more trouble than six  men drunk with wine.  Again and again we threatened to leave him to his  fate, to wash our hands of him.  But incredible and unmerited luck was  with the three of us.  Not a soul did we meet between that and  Willesden; and of those who saw us later, did one think of the two  young men with crooked white ties, supporting a third in a seemingly  unmistakable condition, when the evening papers apprised the town of a  terrible tragedy at Kensal Rise?    We walked to Maida Vale, and thence drove openly to my rooms.  But I  alone went upstairs; the other two proceeded to the Albany, and I saw  no more of Raffles for forty-eight hours.  He was not at his rooms when  I called in the morning; he had left no word.  When he reappeared the  papers were full of the murder; and the man who had committed it was on  the wide Atlantic, a steerage passenger from Liverpool to New York.    \"There was no arguing with him,\" so Raffles told me; \"either he must  make a clean breast of it or flee the country.  So I rigged him up at  the studio, and we took the first train to Liverpool.  Nothing would  induce him to sit tight and enjoy the situation as I should have  endeavored to do in his place; and it's just as well!  I went to his  diggings to destroy some papers, and what do you think I found.  The  police in possession; there's a warrant out against him already!  The  idiots think that window wasn't genuine, and the warrant's out.  It  won't be my fault if it's ever served!\"    Nor, after all these years, can I think it will be mine.        NINE POINTS OF THE LAW    \"Well,\" said Raffles, \"what do you make of it?\"    I read the advertisement once more before replying.  It was in the last  column of the Daily Telegraph, and it ran:    TWO THOUSAND POUNDS REWARD--The above sum may be earned by any one  qualified to undertake delicate mission and prepared to run certain  risk.--Apply by telegram, Security, London.      \"I think,\" said I, \"it's the most extraordinary advertisement that ever  got into print!\"    Raffles smiled.    \"Not quite all that, Bunny; still, extraordinary enough, I grant you.\"    \"Look at the figure!\"    \"It is certainly large.\"    \"And the mission--and the risk!\"    \"Yes; the combination is frank, to say the least of it.  But the really  original point is requiring applications by telegram to a telegraphic  address!  There's something in the fellow who thought of that, and  something in his game; with one word he chokes off the million who  answer an advertisement every day--when they can raise the stamp. My  answer cost me five bob; but then I prepaid another.\"    \"You don't mean to say that you've applied?\"    \"Rather,\" said Raffles.  \"I want two thousand pounds as much as any  man.\"    \"Put your own name?\"    \"Well--no, Bunny, I didn't.  In point of fact I smell something  interesting and illegal, and you know what a cautious chap I am.  I  signed myself Glasspool, care of Hickey, 38, Conduit Street; that's my  tailor, and after sending the wire I went round and told him what to  expect.  He promised to send the reply along the moment it came.  I  shouldn't be surprised if that's it!\"    And he was gone before a double-knock on the outer door had done  ringing through the rooms, to return next minute with an open telegram  and a face full of news.    \"What do you think?\" said he.  \"Security's that fellow Addenbrooke, the  police-court lawyer, and he wants to see me INSTANTER!\"    \"Do you know him, then?\"    \"Merely by repute.  I only hope he doesn't know me.  He's the chap who  got six weeks for sailing too close to the wind in the Sutton-Wilmer  case; everybody wondered why he wasn't struck off the rolls.  Instead  of that he's got a first-rate practice on the seamy side, and every  blackguard with half a case takes it straight to Bennett Addenbrooke.  He's probably the one man who would have the cheek to put in an  advertisement like that, and the one man who could do it without  exciting suspicion.  It's simply in his line; but you may be sure  there's something shady at the bottom of it.  The odd thing is that I  have long made up my mind to go to Addenbrooke myself if accidents  should happen.\"    \"And you're going to him now?\"    \"This minute,\" said Raffles, brushing his hat; \"and so are you.\"    \"But I came in to drag you out to lunch.\"    \"You shall lunch with me when we've seen this fellow.  Come on, Bunny,  and we'll choose your name on the way.  Mine's Glasspool, and don't you  forget it.\"    Mr. Bennett Addenbrooke occupied substantial offices in Wellington  Street, Strand, and was out when we arrived; but he had only just gone  \"over"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7060"],[0,"At Agincourt (#18)"],[1,"duke said. \"Can one  doubt that, with her by his side, her husband would open his gates to the  English, should they appear before it? He himself is a vassal both of  England and France, and should the balance be placed before him, there can  be little doubt that her weight would incline him to England. How well  these English women keep their youth! One might believe her to be but a  few years past twenty, and yet she is the mother of that girl, who is  well-nigh as tall as herself.\"    \"And who bids to be as fair, my lord duke.\"    \"And as English, De Porcelet. She would be a difficult eaglet to tame, if  I mistake not; and had she been the spokeswoman, methinks she would have  answered as haughtily as did her mother. But it might be no bad plan to  mate her to a Frenchman. It is true that there is the boy, but the fief  might well be bestowed upon her if so mated, on the ground that the boy  would likely take after his father and mother and hold Villeroy for  England rather than for France. However, she is young yet; in a couple of  years, De Porcelet, it will be time for you to urge your suit, if so  inclined.\"    There was a general smile from the circle standing round, but the young  knight said gravely, \"When the time comes, my lord duke, I may remind you  of what you have said. 'Tis a fair young face, honest and good, though at  present she must naturally feel with her mother at being thus haled away  from her home.\"    Sir Victor escorted Margaret to the court-yard. As they appeared at the  entrance a knight came up and saluted her.    \"I am intrusted by the duke with the honour of escorting you to your  lodgings,\" he said; \"I am Hugo de Chamfort, the duke's chamberlain.\"    After assisting her into the saddle he mounted a horse which an attendant  brought up and placed himself by her side. Two men-at-arms with their  surtouts embroidered with the cognizance of Burgundy led the way, and the  rest of the party followed in the same order in which they had come. The  distance was short, and beyond a few questions by the knight as to the  journey and how she had been cared for on the way, and Margaret's replies,  little was said until they reached the house of the provost of the  silversmiths. As they rode up to the door Maitre Leroux himself came out  from the house.    \"Welcome, lady,\" he said, \"to my abode. My wife will do all that she can  to make you comfortable.\"    \"I am sorry indeed, good sir,\" Margaret said, \"to be thus forced upon your  hospitality, and regret the trouble that my stay will impose upon you.\"    \"Say not so, lady,\" he said, \"we deem it an honour that his grace the Duke  of Burgundy should have selected us for the honour of entertaining you.  The house is large, and we have no family. Chambers are already prepared  for yourself, your daughter, and son, while there are others at your  disposal for your following.\"    \"I would not trespass too much upon you,\" she said. \"My daughter can sleep  with me, and I am sure that my esquire here, Master Guy Aylmer, will  gladly share a room with my boy. I can obtain lodgings for my four  followers without.\"    \"You will grieve me much if you propose it, lady. There is a large room  upstairs unoccupied, and I will place pallets for them there; and as for  their meals they can have them apart.\"    By this time they had mounted a fine flight of stairs, at the top of which  Dame Leroux was standing to receive her guests. She was a kindly-looking  woman between thirty and forty years of age.    \"Welcome, Lady Margaret,\" she said with a cordiality that made Margaret  feel at once that her visit was not regarded as an infliction. \"We are  quiet people, but will do our best to render your stay here a pleasant  one.\"    \"Thanks indeed, mistress!\" Margaret replied. \"I feared much that my  presence would be felt as a burden, and had hardly hoped for so kind a  welcome. This is my daughter Agnes, and my son Charles.\" Then she turned  to Sir Hugo: \"I pray you to give my thanks to his grace the Duke of  Burgundy, and to thank him for having so well bestowed me. I thank you  also for your courtesy for having conducted me here.\"    \"I will convey your message to the duke,\" he said, \"who will, I am sure,  be pleased to hear of your contentment.\"    Maitre Leroux accompanied the knight downstairs again, and when he had  mounted and ridden off he called two servitors, and bade one carry the  luggage upstairs, and the other conduct the men to the stables he had  taken for the horses.    \"After you have seen to their comfort,\" he said to Robert Picard, \"you  will return hither; you will find a meal prepared for you, and will be  bestowed together in a chamber upstairs.\"    In the meantime his wife had ushered Dame Margaret into a very handsomely  furnished apartment. \"This is at your entire service, Lady Margaret,\" she  said. \"The bedroom behind it is for yourself, the one next to it for your  daughter, unless you would prefer that she should sleep with you.\"    \"I thank you. I was telling your husband that I should prefer that; and my  son and esquire can therefore occupy the second room. But I fear greatly  that I am disturbing yourself and your husband.\"    \"No, indeed; our sitting-room and bedroom are on the other side of the  landing. These are our regular guest-chambers, and your being here will  make no change whatever in our arrangements. I only regret that the  apartments are not larger.\"    \"Do not apologize, I beg of you, madam. I can assure you that the room is  far handsomer than that to which I have been accustomed. You citizens of  Paris are far in advance of us in your ideas of comfort and luxury, and  the apartments both at Villeroy and in my English home cannot compare with  these, except in point of size. I never dreamt that my prison would be so  comfortable.\"    \"Say not prison, I pray you, lady. I heard, indeed, that your visit to the  court was not altogether one of your own choice; but, believe me, here at  least you will be but a guest, and an honoured and welcome one. I will  leave you now. If there is aught that you desire, I pray you to ring that  bell on the table; refreshments will be quickly served. Had I known the  precise hour at which you would come we should have been in readiness for  you, but I thought not that you would arrive till evening.\"    \"I hope that you will give me much of your company, mistress,\" Margaret  said warmly. \"We know no one in this great city, and shall be glad indeed  if, when you can spare time, you will sit with us.\"    \"Well, children, what do you think of this?\" she asked when their hostess  had left the room.    \"It is lovely, mother,\" Agnes said. \"Look at the inlaid cabinets, and the  couches and tables, and this great warm rug that covers all the floor, how  snug and comfortable it all is. Why, mother, I never saw anything like  this.\"    \"You might have seen something like it had you ever been in the house of  one of our rich London traders, Agnes; at least so I have heard, though in  truth I have never myself been in so luxuriously furnished a room. I only  hope that we may stay here for some time. The best of it is that these  good people evidently do not regard us as a burden. No doubt they are  pleased to oblige the Duke of Burgundy, but, beyond that, their welcome  seemed really sincere. Now let us see our bedroom. I suppose that is  yours, Charlie, through the door in the corner.\"    The valises had already been brought to the rooms by another entrance, and  Margaret and her daughter were charmed with their bedroom. A large ewer  and basin of silver stood on a table which was covered with a white cloth,  snowy towels hung beside it; the hangings of the bed were of damask silk,  and the floor was almost covered by an Eastern carpet. An exquisitely  carved wardrobe stood in one corner.    \"It is all lovely!\" Agnes said, clapping her hands. \"You ought to have  your room at home fitted up like this, mother.\"    \"It would take a large slice out of a year's revenue, Agnes,\" her mother  said with a smile, \"to furnish a room in this fashion. That wardrobe alone  is worth a knight's ransom, and the ewer and basin are fit for a king. I  would that your father could see us here; it would ease his anxiety about  us. I must ask how I can best despatch a messenger to him.\"    When they returned to the other apartment they found the table already  laid, and in a short time a dainty repast was served. To this Guy sat down  with them, for except when there were guests, when his place was behind  his lord's chair, he had always been treated as one of the family, and as  the son of Sir Aylmer rather than as a page.    \"Well, Master Guy, what think you of affairs?\"    \"They seem well to the eye, mistress, but I would not trust that Duke of  Burgundy for an hour. With that long face of his and the hooked nose and  his crafty look he resembles little a noble of France. He has an evil  face, and one which accords well with the foul murder of the king's  brother. However, as I see not that he has aught to gain by holding you  here,--save that he thinks it will ensure our lord's keeping his castle  for him,--there is no reason why he should not continue to treat you  honourably and courteously. We have yet to learn whether Master Leroux is  one of his party, or whether he is in favour of Armagnac.\"    \"I should think that he cannot be for Armagnac,\" she said, \"or Duke John  would hardly have quartered us upon him. No doubt it was done under the  semblance of goodwill, but most men would have considered it a heavy tax,  even though, as I expect, we shall not remain here long. Doubtless,  however, the trader considers that his complaisance in the matter would be  taken by the duke as a sign of his desire to show that at least he is not  hostile to him.\"    When they rose from the table Guy, at his mistress's suggestion, went  below and found the four men sitting in the great kitchen, where they had  just finished"]]]
