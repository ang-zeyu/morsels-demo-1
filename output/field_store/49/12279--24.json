The object of the expedition was accomplished and preparations were made  for the return to the states. No accident worth the mention had befallen  the explorers, and the Blackfeet, from whom so much was feared, did not  molest them. It may have been that when their scouts reconnoitred the  camp, they found the barricades so strong and the garrison so watchful  that they decided it would be too costly to make an attack upon them.  It is not impossible that some one or more of them recognized the daring  mountaineer who more than once years before had given their warriors  such severe defeat and punishment. If such was the truth, we cannot but  respect the discretion they showed.    Fort Laramie was reached in the month of September 1842. There as Kit  Carson's labors were ended, he bade his commander and friends goodbye  and started for New Mexico. Fremont and his men reached the states in  safety and thus ended his first exploring expedition.        CHAPTER XXI.       Carson Starts for the States--The Encampment of Captain Cook and his   Dragoons--Carson Undertakes a Delicate and Dangerous Mission--The   Perilous Journey--Return of Carson and the Mexican Boy--Encounter with   Four Utah Indians--Arrival at Bent's Fort.    Early in the year 1843, Kit Carson married his second wife and shortly  after agreed to accompany an expedition of Bent & St. Vrain's wagons to  the States. When part way across the plains, they struck the old Santa  Fe trail and came upon an encampment of Captain Cook with four companies  of United States Dragoons.    They were engaged in escorting a train of Mexican wagons to the boundary  line between New Mexico and the United States. The train was a very  valuable one and an escort of a hundred men were hired to accompany it  through the Indian country.    The situation of this train was an alarming one. It was the duty of  Captain Cook and his soldiers to guard it as far as the fording of the  Arkansas, at that time the boundary line between the two countries.  There was good reason for believing that a strong band of Texan rangers  were waiting beyond, with the intention of attacking and plundering the  train. Indeed the Mexican who had it in charge had received information  that left no possible doubt of the fact.    His face lighted up when he recognized Kit Carson. Hardly waiting until  they had greeted each other, he offered him a liberal reward if he  would ride post haste to Santa Fe and deliver a letter to the Governor,  containing an urgent request to send a strong force to escort the train  thither.    Carson unhesitatingly accepted the offer and with his usual promptness  started almost immediately on his delicate and dangerous business. The  journey was one of several hundred miles through a country swarming with  Indians, and all the skill, cunning and vigilance of the great scout  would be required to succeed. But he never faltered in the face of  peril.    A veteran mountaineer agreed to keep him company, but, when Bent's Fort  was reached he refused to go further, and Carson, as he had often done  before in critical situations, went on alone.    The news which he heard at the fort was of a startling nature. The Utah  Indians were hostile and his long journey led him directly through their  country. He could not censure his friend for declining to go further,  nor could he blame others whom he asked to accompany him, when they  shook their heads. Mr. Bent understood the peculiar danger in which Kit  would be placed, and though he was splendidly mounted, he loaned him a  magnificent steed which he led, ready to mount whenever the necessity  should arise for doing so.    That journey was one of the most remarkable of the many made by Kit  Carson. It would have been less so, had he possessed a companion of  experience, for they could have counselled together, and one would have  kept watch while the other slept. As it was, Carson was compelled to  scan every portion of the plain before him, on the constant lookout for  Indians, who would have spared no effort to circumvent and slay him, had  they known of his presence in their country. He was so placed, indeed,  that only by the most consummate skill could he hope to run the  continuous gauntlet, hundreds of miles in length.    He had gone but a short distance when he detected the trails of his  enemies, showing they were numerous and liable to be encountered at  any moment. When night came, he picketed his horses and lay down on the  prairie or in some grove, ready to leap to his feet, bound upon one of  his steeds and gallop away on a dead run. Where the hunter has no friend  to mount guard, he is often compelled to depend upon his horses, who  frequently prove the best kind of sentinels. They are quick to detect  the approach of strangers, and a slight neigh or stamp of the foot is  enough to give the saving warning.    A large portion of the country over which he rode, was a treeless plain  and the keen blue eyes of the matchless mountaineer were kept on a  continual strain. A moving speck in the distant horizon, the faint  column of thin smoke rising from the far off grove, or a faint yellow  dust against the blue sky, could only mean one thing--the presence of  enemies, for he was in a region which contained not a single friend.    One afternoon Carson discovered an Indian village directly ahead of him  and on the trail which he was following. He instantly withdrew beyond  sight of any who might be on guard, and, hunting a sparse grove of  timber, kept within it until dark; then he made a long circuit, and came  back to the trail far beyond it. He travelled a long distance that night  and by daylight was in no danger of detection.    By using such extreme caution and watchfulness, he succeeded in passing  the entire distance without exchanging a hostile shot with anyone. He  reached Taos, where he waited as agreed upon, until his message could  be sent to the Governor at Santa Fe. While in Taos he learned that  one hundred men had been sent out to meet the caravan and the Governor  himself was about ready to follow with six hundred more. It may be  stated in this place that the smaller company, while looking for the  train was attacked by the Texan rangers and with a single exception  every man was killed; but venturing into American territory, the rangers  were disarmed by Captain Cook and his dragoons, and the wealthy wagon  train, with its valuable cargo reached its destination in safety.    Having accomplished his mission, Carson set out on his return to Bent's  Fort. This time he took a Mexican boy with him. The mountaineer had  become strongly attached to the youth, who was a noble, high minded lad,  the fit companion of the prince among plainsmen.    Two days out from Taos, both were surprised to find themselves  confronted by four Utah Indians on the war path. They appeared  so suddenly, that the two friends were given little time to make  preparation; but, as some distance separated the parties, Kit and the  lad hastily consulted over what was best to do.    \"It is you whom they are seeking,\" said the youth, \"and your life is  worth a great deal more than mine; you have a swift horse; mount him  and dash off; perhaps they will spare me, but you cannot help me by  staying.\"    \"Your offer is a kind one,\" said Carson much touched by the words of his  young friend; \"but nothing in the world would induce me to leave you.  We will stick together and if we must die, why let's each take a warrior  with us.\"    The leading warrior sauntered toward the couple, while they were hastily  consulting together, after the manner of one who felt he was master of  the situation. A broad grin stretched across his painted face, as he  extended one hand to salute Carson, while he reached for his rifle with  the other. Just as his fingers were closing around the weapon of the  mountaineer, the latter struck him a violent blow in the face, which  sent him staggering several paces backward. The other Utahs instantly  ran forward to the help of their comrade.    When they were within a few rods, Carson brought his gun to his shoulder  and peremptorily ordered them to halt. They hesitated, as if uncertain  what to do, when he told them that if they advanced another step or made  any hostile demonstration, both he and his companion would fire. They  would be sure of hitting two of the warriors, when it would become  something like an even fight, with two on each side, and with the  prospect that the red men might suffer still further.    But the Indians were not to be bluffed in such an easy fashion. They  brandished their guns, shook powder in the pans and talked boastingly of  what they meant to do. They were double the number of their enemies and  they would teach them how brave Utah warriors were.    Neither Carson nor the lad was disturbed by these demonstrations, which  meant to intimidate them. The mountaineer whispered to his brave young  companion to keep on his guard against any sudden rush or demonstration.  But the lad scarcely needed the warning. He was as alert and vigilant  as his friend. Had the red men attempted anything hostile, the two would  have fired instantly and then drawn their pistols and been ready for the  others.    The Utahs finally saw it was useless to attempt to bluff the man and  boy, and they rode away without offering them the least harm. Carson and  his young companion instantly resumed their journey, still watchful  and alert; but they reached Bent's Fort without molestation, and the  dangerous venture was over.        CHAPTER XXII.       Kit Carson Hears Surprising News--He Visits Fremont--Is Re-engaged as   Guide--Fremont's Account of his Visit to Salt Lake.    Kit Carson was astonished on reaching Bent's Fort to learn that  Lieutenant Fremont had gone by on his second exploring expedition but a  few days before.

Ah, if you only knew what I have gone through for  you! When I got to the kitchen fire, looking for a sod of lighted turf,  what should be there but an old woman carding flax, and you may see the  marks she left on my face with the cards. I made to the room door as  fast as I could, and who should I stumble over but a cobbler and his  seat, and if he did not work at me with his awls and his pinchers you  may call me a rogue. Well, I got away from him somehow, but when I was  passing through the door, it must be the divel himself that pounced  down on me with his claws, and his teeth, that were equal to sixpenny  nails, and his wings--ill luck be in his road! Well, at last I reached  the stable, and there, by way of salute, I got a pelt from a  sledge-hammer that sent me half a mile off. If you don't believe me,  I'll give you leave to go and judge for yourselves.\"    \"Oh, my poor captain,\" says they, \"we believe you to the nines. Catch  us, indeed, going within a hen's race of that unlucky cabin!\"    Well, before the sun shook his doublet next morning, Jack and his  comrades were up and about. They made a hearty breakfast on what was  left the night before, and then they all agreed to set off to the  castle of the Lord of Dunlavin, and give him back all his gold and  silver. Jack put it all in the two ends of a sack and laid it across  Neddy's back, and all took the road in their hands. Away they went,  through bogs, up hills, down dales, and sometimes along the yellow high  road, till they came to the hall-door of the Lord of Dunlavin, and who  should be there, airing his powdered head, his white stockings, and his  red breeches, but the thief of a porter.    He gave a cross look to the visitors, and says he to Jack, \"What do you  want here, my fine fellow? there isn't room for you all.\"    \"We want,\" says Jack, \"what I'm sure you haven't to give us--and that  is, common civility.\"    \"Come, be off, you lazy strollers!\" says he, \"while a cat 'ud be  licking her ear, or I'll let the dogs at you.\"    \"Would you tell a body,\" says the cock that was perched on the ass's  head, \"who was it that opened the door for the robbers the other night?\"    Ah! maybe the porter's red face didn't turn the colour of his frill,  and the Lord of Dunlavin and his pretty daughter, that were standing at  the parlour window unknownst to the porter, put out their heads.    \"I'd be glad, Barney,\" says the master, \"to hear your answer to the  gentleman with the red comb on him.\"    \"Ah, my lord, don't believe the rascal; sure I didn't open the door to  the six robbers.\"    \"And how did you know there were six, you poor innocent?\" said the lord.    \"Never mind, sir,\" says Jack, \"all your gold and silver is there in  that sack, and I don't think you will begrudge us our supper and bed  after our long march from the wood of Athsalach.\"    \"Begrudge, indeed! Not one of you will ever see a poor day if I can  help it.\"    So all were welcomed to their heart's content, and the ass and the dog  and the cock got the best posts in the farmyard, and the cat took  possession of the kitchen. The lord took Jack in hands, dressed him  from top to toe in broadcloth, and frills as white as snow, and  turnpumps, and put a watch in his fob. When they sat down to dinner,  the lady of the house said Jack had the air of a born gentleman about  him, and the lord said he'd make him his steward. Jack brought his  mother, and settled her comfortably near the castle, and all were as  happy as you please.          THE SHEE AN GANNON AND THE GRUAGACH GAIRE    The Shee an Gannon was born in the morning, named at noon, and went in  the evening to ask his daughter of the king of Erin.    \"I will give you my daughter in marriage,\" said the king of Erin; \"you  won't get her, though, unless you go and bring me back the tidings that  I want, and tell me what it is that put a stop to the laughing of the  Gruagach Gaire, who before this laughed always, and laughed so loud  that the whole world heard him. There are twelve iron spikes out here  in the garden behind my castle. On eleven of the spikes are the heads  of kings' sons who came seeking my daughter in marriage, and all of  them went away to get the knowledge I wanted. Not one was able to get  it and tell me what stopped the Gruagach Gaire from laughing. I took  the heads off them all when they came back without the tidings for  which they went, and I'm greatly in dread that your head'll be on the  twelfth spike, for I'll do the same to you that I did to the eleven  kings' sons unless you tell what put a stop to the laughing of the  Gruagach.\"    The Shee an Gannon made no answer, but left the king and pushed away to  know could he find why the Gruagach was silent.    He took a glen at a step, a hill at a leap, and travelled all day till  evening. Then he came to a house. The master of the house asked him  what sort was he, and he said: \"A young man looking for hire.\"    \"Well,\" said the master of the house, \"I was going tomorrow to look for  a man to mind my cows. If you'll work for me, you'll have a good place,  the best food a man could have to eat in this world, and a soft bed to  lie on.\"    The Shee an Gannon took service, and ate his supper. Then the master of  the house said: \"I am the Gruagach Gaire; now that you are my man and  have eaten your supper, you'll have a bed of silk to sleep on.\"    Next morning after breakfast the Gruagach said to the Shee an Gannon:  \"Go out now and loosen my five golden cows and my bull without horns,  and drive them to pasture; but when you have them out on the grass, be  careful you don't let them go near the land of the giant.\"    The new cowboy drove the cattle to pasture, and when near the land of  the giant, he saw it was covered with woods and surrounded by a high  wall. He went up, put his back against the wall, and threw in a great  stretch of it; then he went inside and threw out another great stretch  of the wall, and put the five golden cows and the bull without horns on  the land of the giant.    Then he climbed a tree, ate the sweet apples himself, and threw the  sour ones down to the cattle of the Gruagach Gaire.    Soon a great crashing was heard in the woods,--the noise of young trees  bending, and old trees breaking. The cowboy looked around and saw a  five-headed giant pushing through the trees; and soon he was before him.    \"Poor miserable creature!\" said the giant; \"but weren't you impudent to  come to my land and trouble me in this way? You're too big for one  bite, and too small for two. I don't know what to do but tear you to  pieces.\"    \"You nasty brute,\" said the cowboy, coming down to him from the tree,  \"'tis little I care for you;\" and then they went at each other. So  great was the noise between them that there was nothing in the world  but what was looking on and listening to the combat.    They fought till late in the afternoon, when the giant was getting the  upper hand; and then the cowboy thought that if the giant should kill  him, his father and mother would never find him or set eyes on him  again, and he would never get the daughter of the king of Erin. The  heart in his body grew strong at this thought. He sprang on the giant,  and with the first squeeze and thrust he put him to his knees in the  hard ground, with the second thrust to his waist, and with the third to  his shoulders.    \"I have you at last; you're done for now!\", said the cowboy. Then he  took out his knife, cut the five heads off the giant, and when he had  them off he cut out the tongues and threw the heads over the wall.    Then he put the tongues in his pocket and drove home the cattle. That  evening the Gruagach couldn't find vessels enough in all his place to  hold the milk of the five golden cows.    But when the cowboy was on the way home with the cattle, the son of the  king of Tisean came and took the giant's heads and claimed the princess  in marriage when the Gruagach Gaire should laugh.    After supper the cowboy would give no talk to his master, but kept his  mind to himself, and went to the bed of silk to sleep.    On the morning the cowboy rose before his master, and the first words  he said to the Gruagach were:    \"What keeps you from laughing, you who used to laugh so loud that the  whole world heard you?\"    \"I'm sorry,\" said the Gruagach, \"that the daughter of the king of Erin  sent you here.\"    \"If you don't tell me of your own will, I'll make you tell me,\" said  the cowboy; and he put a face on himself that was terrible to look at,  and running through the house like a madman, could find nothing that  would give pain enough to the Gruagach but some ropes made of untanned  sheepskin hanging on the wall.    He took these down, caught the Gruagach, fastened him by the three  smalls, and tied him so that his little toes were whispering to his  ears. When he was in this state the Gruagach said: \"I'll tell you what  stopped my laughing if you set me free.\"    So the cowboy unbound him, the two sat down together, and the Gruagach  said:--    \"I lived in this castle here with my twelve sons. We ate, drank, played  cards, and enjoyed ourselves, till one day when my sons and I were  playing, a slender brown hare came rushing in, jumped on to the hearth,  tossed up the ashes to the rafters and ran away.    \"On another day he came again; but if he did, we were ready for him, my  twelve sons and myself. As soon as he tossed up the ashes and ran off,  we made after him, and followed him till nightfall, when he went into a  glen. We saw a light before us. I ran on, and came to a house with a  great apartment, where there was a man named Yellow Face with twelve  daughters, and the hare was tied to the side of the room near the women.    \"There was a large pot over the fire in the room, and a great stork  boiling in the pot. The man of the house said to me: 'There are bundles  of rushes at the end of the room, go there and sit down"]]]
