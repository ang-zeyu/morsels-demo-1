And yet the wall seemed to have an opening in it and in the  opening, as if it were in the frame of a picture, appeared the face Tom  had seen at his library the day Job Titus called on him--the face of  Waddington!    Tom sat up so quickly that he hit his head sharply on a projecting rock  spur, and, for the moment he \"saw stars.\" And with the appearance of  these twinkling points of light the face of Waddington seemed to fade  away, as might a vision in a dream.    \"Bless my salt mackerel, as Mr. Damon would say!\" cried Tom. \"What have  I discovered?\"    He rubbed his head where he had struck it, and then passed his hand  before his eyes, to make sure he was awake. But the vision, if vision  it was, had vanished, and he saw only the bare rock wall. However, the  echo of the voice remained in his ears, and, looking down toward the  tunnel floor Tom saw Serato, the Indian foreman.    \"Were you speaking to me?\" asked Tom, for the man understood and spoke  English fairly well.    \"No, sar. I not know you there!\" and the foreman seemed startled at  seeing Tom. Clearly he was in a fright.    \"You were speaking!\" insisted Tom.    \"No, sar!\" The man shook his head.    \"To some one up there!\" went on the young inventor, waving his hand  toward the spot where he had seen the face in the rock.    \"Me speak to roof? No, sar!\" Serato laughed.    Tom did not know what to believe.    \"You hear me tell um lazy man to much hurry,\" the Indian went on. \"Me  not know you sleep there, sar!\"    \"Oh, all right,\" Tom said, recollecting that he must keep up his  disguise. \"Maybe I was dreaming.\"    \"Yes, sar,\" and the foreman hurried on, with a backward glance over his  shoulder.    \"Now was I dreaming or not?\" thought Tom. \"I'm going to have a look at  that place though, where I saw Waddington's face. Or did I imagine it?\"    He got a long pole and a powerful flash lamp, and when he had a chance,  unobserved, he poked around in the vicinity where he had seen the face.    But there was only solid rock.    \"It must have been a dream,\" Tom concluded. \"I've been thinking too  much about this business. I'll have to give up.  I can't solve the  mystery of the missing men.\"    The next day, much disappointed, he resumed his own character as  explosive expert, and prepared for another blast. The net result of his  watch was that he became suspicious of Serato, and so informed the  Titus Brothers.    \"Oh, but you're mistaken,\" said Job.  \"We have had him for years, on  other contracts in Peru, and we trust him.\"    \"Well, I don't,\" Tom said, but he had to let it go at that.    Another blast was set off, but it was not very successful.    \"The rock seems to be getting harder the farther in we go,\" commented  Walter Titus. \"We're not up to where we ought to be.\"    \"I'll have to look into it,\" answered Tom. \"I may have to change the  powder mixture. Guess I'll go up the mountain a way, and see if there  are any outcroppings of rock there that would give me an idea of what  lies underneath.\"    Accordingly, while the men in the tunnel were clearing away the rock  loosened by the blast, Tom, one day, taking his electric rifle with  him, went up the mountain under which the big bore ran.    He located, by computation, the spot beneath which the end of the  tunnel then was, and began collecting samples of the outcropping ledge.  He wanted to analyze these pieces of stone later. Koku was with him,  and, giving the giant a bag of stones to carry, Tom walked on rather  idly.    It was a wild and desolate region in which he found himself on the side  of the mountain. Beyond him stretched towering and snow-clad peaks, and  high in the air were small specks, which he knew to be condors,  watching with their eager eyes for their offal food.    As Tom and Koku made their way along the mountain trail they came  unexpectedly upon an Indian workman who was gathering herbs and bark,  an industry by which many of the natives added to their scanty  livelihood. The woman was familiar with the appearance of the white  men, and nodded in friendly fashion.    Tom passed on, thinking of many things, when he was suddenly startled  by a scream from the woman. It was a scream of such terror and agony  that, for the moment, Tom was stunned into inactivity. Then, as he  turned, he saw a great condor sweeping down out of the air, the wind  fairly whistling through the big, outstretched wings.    \"Jove!\" ejaculated Tom. \"Can the bird be going to attack the woman?\"    But this was not the object of the condor. It was aiming to strike,  with its fierce talons, at a point some paces distant from where the  woman stood, and in the intervals between her screams Tom heard her  cry, in her native tongue:    \"My baby! My baby! The beast-bird will carry off my baby!\"    Then Tom understood. The woman herb-gatherer had brought her infant  with her on her quest, and had laid it down on a bed of soft grass  while she worked. And it was this infant, wrapped as Tom afterward saw  in a piece of deer-skin, at which the condor was aiming.    \"Master shoot!\" cried Koku, pointing to the down-sweeping bird.    \"You bet I'll shoot!\" cried Tom.    Throwing his electric rifle to his shoulder, Tom pressed the switch  trigger. The unseen but powerful force shot straight at the condor.    The outstretched wings fell limp, the great body seemed to shrivel up,  and, with a crash, the bird fell into the underbrush, breaking the  twigs and branches with its weight.  The electric rifle, a full account  of which was given in the volume entitled \"Tom Swift and His Electric  Rifle,\" had done its work well.    With a scream, in which was mingled a cry of thanks, the woman threw  herself on the sleeping child. The condor had fallen dead not three  paces from it.    Tom Swift had shot just in time.          Chapter XVIII    The Indian Strike      Snatching up in her arms the now awakened child, the woman gazed for a  moment into its face, which she covered with kisses. Then the  herb-gatherer looked over to the dead, limp body of the great condor,  and from thence to Tom.    In another moment the woman had rushed forward, and knelt at the feet  of the young inventor. Holding the baby in one arm, in her other hand  the woman seized Tom's and kissed it fervently, at the same time pouring  forth a torrent of impassioned language, of which Tom could only make  out a word now and then. But he gathered that the woman was thanking  him for having saved the child.    \"Oh, that's all right,\" Tom said, rather embarrassed by the  hand-kissing. \"It was an easy shot.\"    An Indian came bursting through the bushes, evidently the woman's  husband by the manner in which she greeted him, and Tom recognized the  newcomer as one of the tunnel workers.  There was some quick  conversation between the husband and wife, in which the latter made all  sorts of motions, including in their scope Tom, his rifle, the dead  condor and the now smiling baby.    The man took off his hat and approached Tom, genuflecting as he might  have done in church.    \"She say you save baby from condor,\" the man said in his halting  English. \"She t'ank you--me, I t'ank you. Bird see babe in deer  skin--t'ink um dead animal. Maybe so bird carry baby off, drop um on  sharp stone, baby smile no more. You have our lives, senor! We do  anyt'ing we can for you.\"    \"Thanks,\" said Tom, easily. \"I'm glad I happened to be around. I  supposed condors only went for things dead, but I reckon, as you say,  it mistook the baby in the deer skin for a dead animal. And I guess it  might have carried your little one off, or at least lifted it up, and  then it might have dropped it far enough to have killed it. It sure is  a big bird,\" and Tom strolled over to look at what he had bagged.    The condor of the Andes is the largest bird of prey in existence. One  in the Bronx Zoo, in New York, with his wings spread out, measured a  little short of ten feet from tip to tip. Measure ten feet out on the  ground and then imagine a bird with that wing stretch.    This same condor in the park was made angry by a boy throwing a feather  boa up into the air outside the cage. The condor raised himself from  the ground, and hurled himself against the heavy wire netting so that  the whole, big cage shook. And the breeze caused by the flapping wings  blew off the hats of several spectators. So powerful was the air force  from the condor's wings that it reminded one of the current caused when  standing behind the propellers of an aeroplane in motion. The condor  rarely attacks living persons or animals, though it has been known to  carry off big sheep when driven by hunger.    It was one of these animals Tom Swift had shot with his electric rifle.    \"We do anyt'ing you want,\" the man gratefully repeated.    \"Well, I've got about all I want,\" Tom said. \"But if you could tell me  where those ten missing men are, and how they got out of the tunnel,  I'd be obliged to you.\"    The woman did not seem to comprehend Tom's talk, but the man did. He  started, and fear seemed to come over him.    \"Me--I--I can not tell,\" he murmured.    \"No, I don't suppose you can,\" said Tom, musingly. \"Well, it doesn't  matter, I guess I'll have to cross it off my books. I'll never find  out.\"    Again the Indian and his wife expressed their gratitude, and Tom, after  letting the little brown baby cling to his finger, and patting its  chubby cheek, went on his way with Koku.    \"Well, that was some excitement,\" mused Tom, who made little of the  shot itself, for the condor was such a mark that he would have had to  aim very badly indeed to miss it.  And perhaps only the electric rifle  could have killed quickly enough to prevent the baby's being injured in  some way by the big bird, even though it was dying.    \"Master heap good shot!\" exclaimed Koku, admiringly.    The tunnel work went on, though not so well as when Tom's explosive was  first used. The rock was indeed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/954"],[0,"Tom Swift and His War Tank; Or, Doing His Bit for Uncle Sam (#18)"],[1,"work. But let's get this thing settled. He only wants to  hold your tank, and that will give the man, into whose hands he's  playing, a chance to inspect her.\"    \"I believe you. But if I have to leave her here I'll leave some men on  guard inside. It won't be any worse than being stalled in No Man's  Land. In fact, it won't be so bad. But I'll do that rather than be  gouged.\"    \"No, Tom, you won't. If you did leave some one on guard, there'd be too  much chance of their getting the best of him.  You must take your tank  away with you.\"    \"But how can I? I can't put up three thousand dollars in cash, and he  says he won't take a check for fear I'll stop payment. I see his game,  but I don't see how to block it.\"    \"But I do!\" cried Ned.    \"What!\" exclaimed Tom. \"You don't mean to say, even if you do work in a  bank, that you've got three thousand in cash concealed about your  person, do you?\"    \"Pretty nearly, Tom, or what is just as good. I have that amount in  Liberty Bonds. I was going to deliver them to a customer who has  ordered them but not paid for them. They are charged up against me at  the bank, but I'm good for that, I guess. Now I'll loan you these  bonds, and you can give them to this cranky old farmer as security for  damages.  Mind, don't make them as a payment. They're simply  security--the same as when an autoist leaves his car as bail. Only we  don't want to leave our car, we'd rather have it with us,\" and he  looked over at the tank, bristling with splinters from the demolished  barn.    \"Well, I guess that's the only way out,\" said Tom. \"Lucky you had those  bonds with you. I'll take them, and give you a receipt for them. In  fact, I'll buy them from you and let the farmer hold them as security.\"    And this, eventually, was done. After much hemming and hawing and  consultation with the men in the automobile, Mr. Kanker said he would  accept the bonds. It was made clear that they were not in payment of  any damages, though Tom admitted he was liable for some, but that Uncle  Sam's war securities were only a sort of bail, given to indicate that,  some time later, when a jury had passed on the matter, the young  inventor would pay Mr. Kanker whatever sum was agreed upon as just.    \"And now,\" said Tom, as politely as he could under the circumstances,  \"I suppose we will be allowed to depart.\"    \"Yes, take your old shebang offen my property!\" ordered Mr. Kanker,  with no very good grace. \"And if you go knocking down any more barns,  I'll double the price on you!\"    \"I guess he's a bit roiled because he couldn't hold the tank,\" observed  Ned to Tom, as they walked together to the big machine. \"His  friends--our enemies--evidently hoped that was what could be done. They  want to get at some of the secrets.\"    \"I suppose so,\" conceded Tom. \"Well, we're out of that, and I've proved  all I want to.\"    \"But I haven't--quite,\" said Ned.    \"What's missing?\" asked his chum, as they got back in the tank.    \"Well, I'd like to make sure that the fellow who ran from the factory  was the same one I saw sneaking out of the barn.  I believe he was, and  I believe that Simpson's crowd engineered this whole thing.\"    \"I believe so, too,\" Tom agreed. \"The next thing is to prove it. But  that will keep until later. The main thing is we've got our tank, and  now I'm going to get her ready for France.\"    \"Will she be in shape to ship soon?\" asked Ned.    \"Yes, if nothing more happens. I've got a few little changes and  adjustments to make, and then she'll be ready for the last test--one of  long distance endurance mainly.  After that, apart she comes to go to  the front, and we'll begin making 'em in quantities here and on the  other side.\"    \"Good!\" cried Ned. \"Down with the Huns!\"    Without further incident of moment they went back to the headquarters  of the tank, and soon the great machine was safe in the shop where she  had been made.    The next two weeks were busy ones for Tom, and in them he put the  finishing touches on his machine, gave it a long test over fields and  through woods, until finally he announced:    \"She's as complete as I can make her!  She's ready for France!\"          Chapter XIX    Tom is Missing      With Tom Swift's announcement, that his tank was at last ready for real  action, came the end of the long nights and days given over on the part  of his father, himself, and his men to the development and refinement  of the machine, to getting plans and specifications ready so that the  tanks could be made quickly and in large numbers in this country and  abroad and to the actual building of Tank A. Now all this was done at  last, and the first completed tank was ready to be shipped.    Meanwhile the matter of the demolished barn had been left for legal  action. Tom and Ned, it developed, had done the proper thing under the  circumstances, and they were sure they had foiled at least one plan of  the plotters.    \"But they won't stop there,\" declared Ned, who had constituted himself  a sort of detective. \"They're lying back and waiting for another  chance, Tom.\"    \"Well, they won't get it at my tank!\" declared the young inventor, with  a smile. \"I've finished testing her on the road. All I need do now is  to run her around this place if I have to; and there won't be much need  of that before she's taken apart for shipment. Did you get any trace of  Simpson or the men who are with him--Blakeson and the others?\"    \"No,\" Ned answered. \"I've been nosing around about that farmer, Kanker,  but I can't get anything out of him. For all that, I'm sure he was  egged on to his hold-up game by some of your enemies. Everything points  that way.\"    \"I think you're right,\" agreed Tom. \"Well, we won't bother any more  about him. When the trial comes on, I'll pay what the jury says is  right. It'll be worth it, for I proved that Tank A can eat up brick,  stone or wooden buildings and not get indigestion. That's what I set  out to do. So don't worry any more about it, Ned.\"    \"I'm not worrying, but I'd like to get the best of those fellows. The  idea of asking three thousand dollars for a shell of a barn!\"    \"Never mind,\" replied Tom. \"We'll come out all right.\"    Now that the Liberty Loan drive had somewhat slackened, Ned had more  leisure time, and he spent parts of his days and not a few of his  evenings at Tom Swift's. Mr. Damon was also a frequent visitor, and he  never tired of viewing the tank. Every chance he got, when they tested  the big machine in the large field, so well fenced in, the eccentric  man was on hand, with his \"bless my--!\" whatever happened to come most  readily to his mind.    Tom, now that his invention was well-nigh perfected, was not so worried  about not having the tank seen, even at close range, and the enclosure  was not so strictly guarded.    This in a measure was disappointing to Eradicate, who liked the  importance of strutting about with a nickel shield pinned to his coat,  to show that he was a member of the Swift & Company plant. As for the  giant Koku, he really cared little what he did, so long as he pleased  Tom, for whom he had an affection that never changed. Koku would as  soon sit under a shady tree doing nothing as watch for spies or  traitors, of whose identity he was never sure.    So it came that there was not so strict a guard about the place, and  Tom and Ned had more time to themselves. Not that the young inventor  was not busy, for the details of shipping Tank A to France came to him,  as did also the arrangements for making others in this country and  planning for the manufacture abroad.    It was one evening, after a particularly hard day's work, when Tom had  been making a test in turning the tank in a small space in the enclosed  yard, that the two young men were sitting in the machine shop,  discussing various matters.    The telephone bell rang, and Ned, being nearest, answered.    \"It's for you, Tom,\" he said, and there was a smile on the face of the  young bank clerk.    \"Um!\" murmured Tom, and he smiled also.    Ned could not repress more smiles as Tom took up the conversation over  the wire, and it did not take long for the chum of the youthful  inventor to verify his guess that Mary Nestor was at the other end of  the instrument.    \"Yes, yes,\" Tom was heard to say. \"Why, of course, I'll be glad to come  over. Yes, he's here. What? Bring him along? I will if he'll come. Oh,  tell him Helen is there! 'Nough said! He'll come, all right!\"    And Tom, without troubling to consult his friend, hung up the receiver.    \"What's that you're committing me to?\" asked Ned.    \"Oh, Mary wants us to come over and spend the evening.  Helen Sever is  there, and they say we can take them downtown if we like.\"    \"I guess we like,\" laughed Ned. \"Come along! We've had enough of musty  old problems,\" for he had been helping Tom in some calculations  regarding strength of materials and the weight-bearing power of  triangularly constructed girders as compared to the arched variety.    \"Yes, I guess it will do us good to get out,\" and the two friends were  soon on their way.    \"What's this?\" asked Mary, with a laugh, as Tom held out a package tied  with pink string. \"More dynamite?\" she added, referring to an incident  which had once greatly perturbed the excitable Mr. Nestor.    \"If she doesn't want it, perhaps Helen will take it,\" suggested Ned,  with a twinkle in his eyes. \"Halloran said they were just in fresh--\"    \"Oh, you delightful boy!\" cried Helen. \"I'm just dying for some  chocolates! Let me open them, Mary, if you're afraid of dynamite.\"    \"The only powder in them,\" said Tom, \"is the powdered sugar. That can't  blow you up.\"    And then the young people made merry, Tom, for the time being,  forgetting all about his tank.    It was rather late when the two young men strolled back toward the  Swift home, Ned walking that way with his chum.  Tom started out in the  direction of the building where the tank was housed.    \"Goi"]]]
