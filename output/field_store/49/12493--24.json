Notwithstanding  this, efforts are reported to be continuing for the ascertainment of  Colombia's contingent liability on account of Cerruti's debts under the  fifth article of the award.    A claim of an American citizen against the Dominican Republic for  a public bridge over the Ozama River, which has been in diplomatic  controversy for several years, has been settled by expert arbitration  and an award in favor of the claimant amounting to about $90,000. It,  however, remains unpaid, despite urgent demands for its settlement  according to the terms of the compact.    There is now every prospect that the participation of the United States  in the Universal Exposition to be held in Paris in 1900 will be on a  scale commensurate with the advanced position held by our products and  industries in the world's chief marts.    The preliminary report of Mr. Moses P. Handy, who, under the act  approved July 19, 1897, was appointed special commissioner with a view  to securing all attainable information necessary to a full and complete  understanding by Congress in regard to the participation of this  Government in the Paris Exposition, was laid before you by my message  of December 6, 1897, and showed the large opportunities opened to make  known our national progress in arts, science, and manufactures, as  well as the urgent need of immediate and adequate provision to enable  due advantage thereof to be taken. Mr. Handy's death soon afterwards  rendered it necessary for another to take up and complete his unfinished  work, and on January 11 last Mr. Thomas W. Cridler, Third Assistant  Secretary of State, was designated to fulfill that task. His report was  laid before you by my message of June 14, 1898, with the gratifying  result of awakening renewed interest in the projected display. By a  provision in the sundry civil appropriation act of July 1, 1898, a sum  not to exceed $650,000 was allotted for the organization of a commission  to care for the proper preparation and installation of American exhibits  and for the display of suitable exhibits by the several Executive  Departments, particularly by the Department of Agriculture, the Fish  Commission, and the Smithsonian Institution, in representation of the  Government of the United States.    Pursuant to that enactment I appointed Mr. Ferdinand W. Peck, of  Chicago, commissioner-general, with an assistant commissioner-general  and a secretary. Mr. Peck at once proceeded to Paris, where his success  in enlarging the scope and variety of the United States exhibit has  been most gratifying. Notwithstanding the comparatively limited area  of the exposition site--less than one-half that of the World's Fair at  Chicago--the space assigned to the United States has been increased from  the absolute allotment of 157,403 square feet reported by Mr. Handy to  some 202,000 square feet, with corresponding augmentation of the field  for a truly characteristic representation of the various important  branches of our country's development. Mr. Peck's report will be laid  before you. In my judgment its recommendations will call for your early  consideration, especially as regards an increase of the appropriation to  at least one million dollars in all, so that not only may the assigned  space be fully taken up by the best possible exhibits in every class,  but the preparation and installation be on so perfect a scale as to  rank among the first in that unparalleled competition of artistic and  inventive production, and thus counterbalance the disadvantage with  which we start as compared with other countries whose appropriations are  on a more generous scale and whose preparations are in a state of much  greater forwardness than our own.    Where our artisans have the admitted capacity to excel, where our  inventive genius has initiated many of the grandest discoveries of these  later days of the century, and where the native resources of our land  are as limitless as they are valuable to supply the world's needs, it is  our province, as it should be our earnest care, to lead in the march of  human progress, and not rest content with any secondary place. Moreover,  if this be due to ourselves, it is no less due to the great French  nation whose guests we become, and which has in so many ways testified  its wish and hope that our participation shall befit the place the two  peoples have won in the field of universal development.    The commercial arrangement made with France on the 28th of May, 1898,  under the provisions of section 3 of the tariff act of 1897, went into  effect on the 1st day of June following. It has relieved a portion of  our export trade from serious embarrassment. Further negotiations  are now pending under section 4 of the same act with a view to the  increase of trade between the two countries to their mutual advantage.  Negotiations with other governments, in part interrupted by the war with  Spain, are in progress under both sections of the tariff act. I hope to  be able to announce some of the results of these negotiations during the  present session of Congress.    Negotiations to the same end with Germany have been set on foot.  Meanwhile no effort has been relaxed to convince the Imperial Government  of the thoroughness of our inspection of pork products for exportation,  and it is trusted that the efficient administration of this measure by  the Department of Agriculture will be recognized as a guaranty of the  healthfulness of the food staples we send abroad to countries where  their use is large and necessary.    I transmitted to the Senate on the 10th of February last information  touching the prohibition against the importation of fresh fruits from  this country, which had then recently been decreed by Germany on the  ground of danger of disseminating the San Jose scale insect. This  precautionary measure was justified by Germany on the score of the  drastic steps taken in several States of the Union against the spread of  the pest, the elaborate reports of the Department of Agriculture being  put in evidence to show the danger to German fruit-growing interests  should the scale obtain a lodgment in that country. Temporary relief was  afforded in the case of large consignments of fruit then on the way by  inspection and admission when found noninfected. Later the prohibition  was extended to dried fruits of every kind, but was relaxed so as to  apply only to unpeeled fruit and fruit waste. As was to be expected, the  alarm reached to other countries, and Switzerland has adopted a similar  inhibition. Efforts are in progress to induce the German and Swiss  Governments to relax the prohibition in favor of dried fruits shown to  have been cured under circumstances rendering the existence of animal  life impossible.    Our relations with Great Britain have continued on the most friendly  footing. Assenting to our request, the protection of Americans and their  interests in Spanish jurisdiction was assumed by the diplomatic and  consular representatives of Great Britain, who fulfilled their delicate  and arduous trust with tact and zeal, eliciting high commendation.  I may be allowed to make fitting allusion to the instance of Mr. Ramsden,  Her Majesty's consul at Santiago de Cuba, whose untimely death after  distinguished service and untiring effort during the siege of that city  was sincerely lamented.    In the early part of April last, pursuant to a request made at the  instance of the Secretary of State by the British ambassador at this  capital, the Canadian government granted facilities for the passage of  four United States revenue cutters from the Great Lakes to the Atlantic  coast by way of the Canadian canals and the St. Lawrence River. The  vessels had reached Lake Ontario and were there awaiting the opening of  navigation when war was declared between the United States and Spain.  Her Majesty's Government thereupon, by a communication of the latter  part of April, stated that the permission granted before the outbreak of  hostilities would not be withdrawn provided the United States Government  gave assurance that the vessels in question would proceed direct to  a United States port without engaging in any hostile operation.  This Government promptly agreed to the stipulated condition, it being  understood that the vessels would not be prohibited from resisting any  hostile attack.    It will give me especial satisfaction if I shall be authorized to  communicate to you a favorable conclusion of the pending negotiations  with Great Britain in respect to the Dominion of Canada. It is the  earnest wish of this Government to remove all sources of discord and  irritation in our relations with the neighboring Dominion. The trade  between the two countries is constantly increasing, and it is important  to both countries that all reasonable facilities should be granted for  its development.    The Government of Greece strongly urges the onerousness of the duty here  imposed upon the currants of that country, amounting to 100 per cent or  more of their market value. This fruit is stated to be exclusively a  Greek product, not coming into competition with any domestic product.  The question of reciprocal commercial relations with Greece, including  the restoration of currants to the free list, is under consideration.    The long-standing claim of Bernard Campbell for damages for injuries  sustained from a violent assault committed against him by military  authorities in the island of Haiti has been settled by the agreement of  that Republic to pay him $10,000 in American gold. Of this sum $5,000  has already been paid. It is hoped that other pending claims of American  citizens against that Republic may be amicably adjusted.    Pending the consideration by the Senate of the treaty signed June 16,  1897, by the plenipotentiaries of the United States and of the Republic  of Hawaii, providing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/139"],[0,"The Lost World (#19)"],[1,"among loose rubble which slid from  beneath us.  Suddenly an exclamation broke from Lord Roxton.    \"It's blocked!\" said he.    Clustering behind him we saw in the yellow field of light a wall of  broken basalt which extended to the ceiling.    \"The roof has fallen in!\"    In vain we dragged out some of the pieces.  The only effect was that  the larger ones became detached and threatened to roll down the  gradient and crush us.  It was evident that the obstacle was far beyond  any efforts which we could make to remove it.  The road by which Maple  White had ascended was no longer available.    Too much cast down to speak, we stumbled down the dark tunnel and made  our way back to the camp.    One incident occurred, however, before we left the gorge, which is of  importance in view of what came afterwards.    We had gathered in a little group at the bottom of the chasm, some  forty feet beneath the mouth of the cave, when a huge rock rolled  suddenly downwards--and shot past us with tremendous force.  It was the  narrowest escape for one or all of us.  We could not ourselves see  whence the rock had come, but our half-breed servants, who were still  at the opening of the cave, said that it had flown past them, and must  therefore have fallen from the summit.  Looking upwards, we could see  no sign of movement above us amidst the green jungle which topped the  cliff.  There could be little doubt, however, that the stone was aimed  at us, so the incident surely pointed to humanity--and malevolent  humanity--upon the plateau.    We withdrew hurriedly from the chasm, our minds full of this new  development and its bearing upon our plans.  The situation was  difficult enough before, but if the obstructions of Nature were  increased by the deliberate opposition of man, then our case was indeed  a hopeless one.  And yet, as we looked up at that beautiful fringe of  verdure only a few hundreds of feet above our heads, there was not one  of us who could conceive the idea of returning to London until we had  explored it to its depths.    On discussing the situation, we determined that our best course was to  continue to coast round the plateau in the hope of finding some other  means of reaching the top.  The line of cliffs, which had decreased  considerably in height, had already begun to trend from west to north,  and if we could take this as representing the arc of a circle, the  whole circumference could not be very great.  At the worst, then, we  should be back in a few days at our starting-point.    We made a march that day which totaled some two-and-twenty miles,  without any change in our prospects.  I may mention that our aneroid  shows us that in the continual incline which we have ascended since we  abandoned our canoes we have risen to no less than three thousand feet  above sea-level.  Hence there is a considerable change both in the  temperature and in the vegetation.  We have shaken off some of that  horrible insect life which is the bane of tropical travel.  A few palms  still survive, and many tree-ferns, but the Amazonian trees have been  all left behind.  It was pleasant to see the convolvulus, the  passion-flower, and the begonia, all reminding me of home, here among  these inhospitable rocks.  There was a red begonia just the same color  as one that is kept in a pot in the window of a certain villa in  Streatham--but I am drifting into private reminiscence.    That night--I am still speaking of the first day of our  circumnavigation of the plateau--a great experience awaited us, and one  which for ever set at rest any doubt which we could have had as to the  wonders so near us.    You will realize as you read it, my dear Mr. McArdle, and possibly for  the first time that the paper has not sent me on a wild-goose chase,  and that there is inconceivably fine copy waiting for the world  whenever we have the Professor's leave to make use of it.  I shall not  dare to publish these articles unless I can bring back my proofs to  England, or I shall be hailed as the journalistic Munchausen of all  time.  I have no doubt that you feel the same way yourself, and that  you would not care to stake the whole credit of the Gazette upon this  adventure until we can meet the chorus of criticism and scepticism  which such articles must of necessity elicit.  So this wonderful  incident, which would make such a headline for the old paper, must  still wait its turn in the editorial drawer.    And yet it was all over in a flash, and there was no sequel to it, save  in our own convictions.    What occurred was this.  Lord John had shot an ajouti--which is a  small, pig-like animal--and, half of it having been given to the  Indians, we were cooking the other half upon our fire.  There is a  chill in the  air after dark, and we had all drawn close to the blaze.  The night was moonless, but there were some stars, and one could see  for a little distance across the plain.  Well, suddenly out of the  darkness, out of the night, there swooped something with a swish like  an aeroplane.  The whole group of us were covered for an instant by a  canopy of leathery wings, and I had a momentary vision of a long,  snake-like neck, a fierce, red, greedy eye, and a great snapping beak,  filled, to my amazement, with little, gleaming teeth.  The next instant  it was gone--and so was our dinner.  A huge black shadow, twenty feet  across, skimmed up into the air; for an instant the monster wings  blotted out the stars, and then it vanished over the brow of the cliff  above us.  We all sat in amazed silence round the fire, like the heroes  of Virgil when the Harpies came down upon them.  It was Summerlee who  was the first to speak.    \"Professor Challenger,\" said he, in a solemn voice, which quavered with  emotion, \"I owe you an apology.  Sir, I am very much in the wrong, and  I beg that you will forget what is past.\"    It was handsomely said, and the two men for the first time shook hands.  So much we have gained by this clear vision of our first pterodactyl.  It was worth a stolen supper to bring two such men together.    But if prehistoric life existed upon the plateau it was not  superabundant, for we had no further glimpse of it during the next  three days.  During this time we traversed a barren and forbidding  country, which alternated between stony desert and desolate marshes  full of many wild-fowl, upon the north and east of the cliffs.  From  that direction the place is really inaccessible, and, were it not for a  hardish ledge which runs at the very base of the precipice, we should  have had to turn back.  Many times we were up to our waists in the  slime and blubber of an old, semi-tropical swamp.  To make matters  worse, the place seemed to be a favorite breeding-place of the Jaracaca  snake, the most venomous and aggressive in South America.  Again and  again these horrible creatures came writhing and springing towards us  across the surface of this putrid bog, and it was only by keeping our  shot-guns for ever ready that we could feel safe from them.  One  funnel-shaped depression in the morass, of a livid green in color from  some lichen which festered in it, will always remain as a nightmare  memory in my mind.  It seems to have been a special nest of these  vermins, and the slopes were alive with them, all writhing in our  direction, for it is a peculiarity of the Jaracaca that he will always  attack man at first sight.  There were too many for us to shoot, so we  fairly took to our heels and ran until we were exhausted.  I shall  always remember as we looked back how far behind we could see the heads  and necks of our horrible pursuers rising and falling amid the reeds.  Jaracaca Swamp we named it in the map which we are constructing.    The cliffs upon the farther side had lost their ruddy tint, being  chocolate-brown in color; the vegetation was more scattered along the  top of them, and they had sunk to three or four hundred feet in height,  but in no place did we find any point where they could be ascended.  If  anything, they were more impossible than at the first point where we  had met them.  Their absolute steepness is indicated in the photograph  which I took over the stony desert.    \"Surely,\" said I, as we discussed the situation, \"the rain must find  its way down somehow.  There are bound to be water-channels in the  rocks.\"    \"Our young friend has glimpses of lucidity,\" said Professor Challenger,  patting me upon the shoulder.    \"The rain must go somewhere,\" I repeated.    \"He keeps a firm grip upon actuality.  The only drawback is that we  have conclusively proved by ocular demonstration that there are no  water channels down the rocks.\"    \"Where, then, does it go?\" I persisted.    \"I think it may be fairly assumed that if it does not come outwards it  must run inwards.\"    \"Then there is a lake in the center.\"    \"So I should suppose.\"    \"It is more than likely that the lake may be an old crater,\" said  Summerlee.  \"The whole formation is, of course, highly volcanic.  But,  however that may be, I should expect to find the surface of the plateau  slope inwards with a considerable sheet of water in the center, which  may drain off, by some subterranean channel, into the marshes of the  Jaracaca Swamp.\"    \"Or evaporation might preserve an equilibrium,\" remarked Challenger,  and the two learned men wandered off into one of their usual scientific  arguments, which were as comprehensible as Chinese to the layman.    On the sixth day we completed our first circuit of the cliffs, and  found ourselves back at the first camp, beside the isolated pinnacle of  rock.  We were a disconsolate party, for nothing could have been more  minute than our investigation, and it was absolutely certain that there  was no single point where the most active human being could possibly  hope to scale the cliff.  The place which Maple White's chalk-marks had  indicated as his own means of access was now entirely impassable.  "]]]
