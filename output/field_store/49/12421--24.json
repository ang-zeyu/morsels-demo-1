As frankly let us own--what it  would be unbecoming to parade were foreigners concerned--that our  triumph was won not more by skill and bravery than by superior resources  and crushing numbers; that it was a triumph, too, over a people for  years politically misled by designing men, and also by some  honestly-erring men, who from their position could not have been  otherwise than broadly influential; a people who, though indeed, they  sought to perpetuate the curse of slavery, and even extend it, were not  the authors of it, but (less fortunate, not less righteous than we) were  the fated inheritors; a people who, having a like origin with ourselves,  share essentially in whatever worthy qualities we may possess. No one  can add to the lasting reproach which hopeless defeat has now cast upon  Secession by withholding the recognition of these verities.    Surely we ought to take it to heart that that kind of pacification,  based upon principles operating equally all over the land, which lovers  of their country yearn for, and which our arms, though signally  triumphant, did not bring about, and which law-making, however anxious,  or energetic, or repressive, never by itself can achieve, may yet be  largely aided by generosity of sentiment public and private. Some  revisionary legislation and adaptive is indispensable; but with this  should harmoniously work another kind of prudence not unallied with  entire magnanimity. Benevolence and policy--Christianity and  Machiavelli--dissuade from penal severities toward the subdued.  Abstinence here is as obligatory as considerate care for our unfortunate  fellow-men late in bonds, and, if observed, would equally prove to be  wise forecast. The great qualities of the South, those attested in the  War, we can perilously alienate, or we may make them nationally  available at need.    The blacks, in their infant pupilage to freedom, appeal to the  sympathies of every humane mind. The paternal guardianship which for the  interval government exercises over them was prompted equally by duty and  benevolence. Yet such kindliness should not be allowed to exclude  kindliness to communities who stand nearer to us in nature. For the  future of the freed slaves we may well be concerned; but the future of  the whole country, involving the future of the blacks, urges a paramount  claim upon our anxiety. Effective benignity, like the Nile, is not  narrow in its bounty, and true policy is always broad. To be sure, it is  vain to seek to glide, with moulded words, over the difficulties of the  situation. And for them who are neither partisans, nor enthusiasts, nor  theorists, nor cynics, there are some doubts not readily to be solved.  And there are fears. Why is not the cessation of war now at length  attended with the settled calm of peace? Wherefore in a clear sky do we  still turn our eyes toward the South, as the Neapolitan, months after  the eruption, turns his toward Vesuvius? Do we dread lest the repose may  be deceptive? In the recent convulsion has the crater but shifted? Let  us revere that sacred uncertainty which forever impends over men and  nations. Those of us who always abhorred slavery as an atheistical  iniquity, gladly we join in the exulting chorus of humanity over its  downfall. But we should remember that emancipation was accomplished not  by deliberate legislation; only through agonized violence could so  mighty a result be effected. In our natural solicitude to confirm the  benefit of liberty to the blacks, let us forbear from measures of  dubious constitutional rightfulness toward our white countrymen  --measures of a nature to provoke, among other of the last evils,  exterminating hatred of race toward race. In imagination let us place  ourselves in the unprecedented position of the Southerners--their  position as regards the millions of ignorant manumitted slaves in their  midst, for whom some of us now claim the suffrage. Let us be Christians  toward our fellow-whites, as well as philanthropists toward the blacks  our fellow-men. In all things, and toward all, we are enjoined to do as  we would be done by. Nor should we forget that benevolent desires, after  passing a certain point, can not undertake their own fulfillment without  incurring the risk of evils beyond those sought to be remedied.  Something may well be left to the graduated care of future legislation,  and to heaven. In one point of view the co-existence of the two races in  the South--whether the negro be bond or free--seems (even as it did to  Abraham Lincoln) a grave evil. Emancipation has ridded the country of  the reproach, but not wholly of the calamity. Especially in the present  transition period for both races in the South, more or less of trouble  may not unreasonably be anticipated; but let us not hereafter be too  swift to charge the blame exclusively in any one quarter. With certain  evils men must be more or less patient. Our institutions have a potent  digestion, and may in time convert and assimilate to good all elements  thrown in, however originally alien.    But, so far as immediate measures looking toward permanent  Re-establishment are concerned, no consideration should tempt us to  pervert the national victory into oppression for the vanquished. Should  plausible promise of eventual good, or a deceptive or spurious sense of  duty, lead us to essay this, count we must on serious consequences, not  the least of which would be divisions among the Northern adherents of  the Union. Assuredly, if any honest Catos there be who thus far have  gone with us, no longer will they do so, but oppose us, and as  resolutely as hitherto they have supported. But this path of thought  leads toward those waters of bitterness from which one can only turn  aside and be silent.    But supposing Re-establishment so far advanced that the Southern seats  in Congress are occupied, and by men qualified in accordance with those  cardinal principles of representative government which hitherto have  prevailed in the land--what then? Why the Congressman elected by the  people of the South will--represent the people of the South. This may  seem a flat conclusion; but in view of the last five years, may there  not be latent significance in it? What will be the temper of those  Southern members? and, confronted by them, what will be the mood of our  own representatives? In private life true reconciliation seldom follows  a violent quarrel; but if subsequent intercourse be unavoidable, nice  observances and mutual are indispensable to the prevention of a new  rupture. Amity itelf can only be maintained by reciprocal respect, and  true friends are punctilious equals. On the floor of Congress North and  South are to come together after a passionate duel, in which the South  though proving her valor, has been made to bite the dust. Upon  differences in debate shall acrimonious recriminations be exchanged?  shall censorious superiority assumed by one section provoke defiant  self-assertion on the other? shall Manassas and Chickamauga be retorted  for Chattanooga and Richmond? Under the supposition that the full  Congress will be composed of gentlemen, all this is impossible. Yet if  otherwise, it needs no prophet of Israel to foretell the end. The  maintenance of Congressional decency in the future will rest mainly with  the North. Rightly will more forbearance be required from the North than  the South, for the North is victor.    But some there are who may deem these latter thoughts inapplicable, and  for this reason: Since the test-oath opertively excludes from Congress  all who in any way participated in Secession, therefore none but  Southerners wholly in harmony with the North are eligible to seats. This  is true for the time being. But the oath is alterable; and in the wonted  fluctuations of parties not improbably it will undergo alteration,  assuming such a form, perhaps, as not to bar the admission into the  National Legislature of men who represent the populations lately in  revolt. Such a result would involve no violation of the principles of  democratic government. Not readily can one perceive how the political  existence of the millions of late Secessionists can permanently be  ignored by this Republic. The years of the war tried our devotion to the  Union; the time of peace may test the sincerity of our faith in  democracy.    In no spirit of opposition, not by way of challenge, is any thing  here thrown out. These thoughts are sincere ones; they seem natural  --inevitable. Here and there they must have suggested themselves to many  thoughtful patriots. And, if they be just thoughts, ere long they must  have that weight with the public which already they have had with  individuals.    For that heroic band--those children of the furnace who, in regions like  Texas and Tennessee, maintained their fidelity through terrible  trials--we of the North felt for them, and profoundly we honor them. Yet  passionate sympathy, with resentments so close as to be almost domestic  in their bitterness, would hardly in the present juncture tend to  discreet legislation. Were the Unionists and Secessionists but as  Guelphs and Ghibellines? If not, then far be it from a great nation now  to act in the spirit that animated a triumphant town-faction in the  Middle Ages. But crowding thoughts must at last be checked; and, in  times like the present, one who desires to be impartially just in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1239"],[0,"The Spirit of the Border: A Romance of the Early Settlers in the Ohio Valley (#19)"],[1,"Indians was made one day during the  indisposition of Mr. Wells--who had been over-working himself--and  the absence of the other missionaries. He did not consider himself  at all ready for preaching, and confined his efforts to simple,  earnest talk, a recital of the thoughts he had assimilated while  living here among the Indians.    Amazement would not have described the state of his feelings when he  learned that he had made a powerful impression. The converts were  loud in his praise; the unbelievers silent and thoughtful. In spite  of himself, long before he had been prepared, he was launched on his  teaching. Every day he was called upon to speak; every day one  savage, at least, was convinced; every day the throng of interested  Indians was augmented. The elder missionaries were quite overcome  with joy; they pressed him day after day to speak, until at length  he alone preached during the afternoon service.    The news flew apace; the Village of Peace entertained more redmen  than ever before. Day by day the faith gained a stronger foothold. A  kind of religious trance affected some of the converted Indians, and  this greatly influenced the doubting ones. Many of them half  believed the Great Manitou had come.    Heckewelder, the acknowledged leader of the western Moravian  Mission, visited the village at this time, and, struck by the young  missionary's success, arranged a three days' religious festival.  Indian runners were employed to carry invitations to all the tribes.  The Wyandots in the west, the Shawnees in the south, and the  Delawares in the north were especially requested to come. No  deception was practiced to lure the distant savages to the Village  of Peace. They were asked to come, partake of the feasts, and listen  to the white man's teaching.        Chapter XII.    \"The Groves Were God's First Temples.\"    From dawn until noon on Sunday bands of Indians arrived at the  Village of Peace. Hundreds of canoes glided down the swift stream  and bumped their prows into the pebbly beach. Groups of mounted  warriors rode out of the forests into the clearing; squaws with  papooses, maidens carrying wicker baskets, and children playing with  rude toys, came trooping along the bridle-paths.    Gifts were presented during the morning, after which the visitors  were feasted. In the afternoon all assembled in the grove to hear  the preaching.    The maple grove wherein the service was to be conducted might have  been intended by Nature for just such a purpose as it now fulfilled.  These trees were large, spreading, and situated far apart. Mossy  stones and the thick carpet of grass afforded seats for the  congregation.    Heckewelder--a tall, spare, and kindly appearing man--directed the  arranging of the congregation. He placed the converted Indians just  behind the knoll upon which the presiding minister was to stand. In  a half circle facing the knoll he seated the chieftains and  important personages of the various tribes. He then made a short  address in the Indian language, speaking of the work of the mission,  what wonders it had accomplished, what more good work it hoped to  do, and concluded by introducing the young missionary.    While Heckewelder spoke, Jim, who stood just behind, employed the  few moments in running his eye over the multitude. The sight which  met his gaze was one he thought he would never forget. An  involuntary word escaped him.    \"Magnificent!\" he exclaimed.    The shady glade had been transformed into a theater, from which  gazed a thousand dark, still faces. A thousand eagle plumes waved,  and ten thousand bright-hued feathers quivered in the soft breeze.  The fantastically dressed scalps presented a contrast to the smooth,  unadorned heads of the converted redmen. These proud plumes and  defiant feathers told the difference between savage and Christian.    In front of the knoll sat fifty chiefs, attentive and dignified.  Representatives of every tribe as far west as the Scioto River were  numbered in that circle. There were chiefs renowned for war, for  cunning, for valor, for wisdom. Their stately presence gave the  meeting tenfold importance. Could these chiefs be interested, moved,  the whole western world of Indians might be civilized.    Hepote, a Maumee chief, of whom it was said he had never listened to  words of the paleface, had the central position in this circle. On  his right and left, respectively, sat Shaushoto and Pipe, implacable  foes of all white men. The latter's aspect did not belie his  reputation. His copper-colored, repulsive visage compelled fear; it  breathed vindictiveness and malignity. A singular action of his was  that he always, in what must have been his arrogant vanity, turned  his profile to those who watched him, and it was a remarkable one;  it sloped in an oblique line from the top of his forehead to his  protruding chin, resembling somewhat the carved bowl of his pipe,  which was of flint and a famed inheritance from his ancestors. From  it he took his name. One solitary eagle plume, its tip stained  vermilion, stuck from his scalp-lock. It slated backward on a line  with his profile.    Among all these chiefs, striking as they were, the figure of  Wingenund, the Delaware, stood out alone.    His position was at the extreme left of the circle, where he leaned  against a maple. A long, black mantle, trimmed with spotless white,  enveloped him. One bronzed arm, circled by a heavy bracelet of gold,  held the mantle close about his lofty form. His headdress, which  trailed to the ground, was exceedingly beautiful. The eagle plumes  were of uniform length and pure white, except the black-pointed  tips.    At his feet sat his daughter, Whispering Winds. Her maidens were  gathered round her. She raised her soft, black eyes, shining with a  wondrous light of surprise and expectation, to the young  missionary's face.    Beyond the circle the Indians were massed together, even beyond the  limits of the glade. Under the trees on every side sat warriors  astride their steeds; some lounged on the green turf; many reclined  in the branches of low-spreading maples.    As Jim looked out over the sea of faces he started in surprise. The  sudden glance of fiery eyes had impelled his gaze. He recognized  Silvertip, the Shawnee chief. The Indian sat motionless on a  powerful black horse. Jim started again, for the horse was Joe's  thoroughbred, Lance. But Jim had no further time to think of Joe's  enemy, for Heckewelder stepped back.    Jim took the vacated seat, and, with a far-reaching, resonant voice  began his discourse to the Indians.    \"Chieftains, warriors, maidens, children of the forest, listen, and  your ears shall hear no lie. I am come from where the sun rises to  tell you of the Great Spirit of the white man.    \"Many, many moons ago, as many as blades of grass grow on yonder  plain, the Great Spirit of whom I shall speak created the world. He  made the sparkling lakes and swift rivers, the boundless plains and  tangled forests, over which He caused the sun to shine and the rain  to fall. He gave life to the kingly elk, the graceful deer, the  rolling bison, the bear, the fox--all the beasts and birds and  fishes. But He was not content; for nothing He made was perfect in  His sight. He created the white man in His own image, and from this  first man's rib He created his mate--a woman. He turned them free in  a beautiful forest.    \"Life was fair in the beautiful forest. The sun shone always, the  birds sang, the waters flowed with music, the flowers cast sweet  fragrance on the air. In this forest, where fruit bloomed always,  was one tree, the Tree of Life, the apple of which they must not  eat. In all this beautiful forest of abundance this apple alone was  forbidden them.    \"Now evil was born with woman. A serpent tempted her to eat of the  apple of Life, and she tempted the man to eat. For their sin the  Great Spirit commanded the serpent to crawl forever on his belly,  and He drove them from the beautiful forest. The punishment for  their sin was to be visited on their children's children, always,  until the end of time. The two went afar into the dark forest, to  learn to live as best they might. From them all tribes descended.  The world is wide. A warrior might run all his days and not reach  the setting sun, where tribes of yellow-skins live. He might travel  half his days toward the south-wind, where tribes of black-skins  abound. People of all colors inhabited the world. They lived in  hatred toward one another. They shed each other's blood; they stole  each other's lands, gold, and women. They sinned.    \"Many moons ago the Great Spirit sorrowed to see His chosen tribe,  the palefaces, living in ignorance and sin. He sent His only Son to  redeem them, and said if they would listen and believe, and teach  the other tribes, He would forgive their sin and welcome them to the  beautiful forest.    \"That was moons and moons ago, when the paleface killed his brother  for gold and lands, and beat his women slaves to make them plant his  corn. The Son of the Great Spirit lifted the cloud from the  palefaces' eyes, and they saw and learned. So pleased was the Great  Spirit that He made the palefaces wiser and wiser, and master of the  world. He bid them go afar to teach the ignorant tribes.    \"To teach you is why the young paleface journeyed from the rising  sun. He wants no lands or power. He has given all that he had. He  walks among you without gun or knife. He can gain nothing but the  happiness of opening the redmen's eyes.    \"The Great Spirit of whom I teach and the Great Manitou, your idol,  are the same; the happy hunting ground of the Indian and the  beautiful forest of the paleface are the same; the paleface and the  redman are the same. There is but one Great Spirit, that is God; but  one eternal home, that is heaven; but one human being, that is man.    \"The Indian knows the habits of the beaver; he can"]]]
