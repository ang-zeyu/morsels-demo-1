The section  we will leave to Polton--as time is an object, Polton, you had better  imbed the hair in thick gum and freeze it hard on the microtome, and be  very careful to cut the section at right angles to the length of the  hair--meanwhile, we will get to work with the microscope.\"    The hairs proved on measurement to have the surprisingly large diameter  of 1/135 of an inch--fully double that of ordinary hairs, although they  were unquestionably human. As to the white dust, it presented a problem  that even Thorndyke was unable to solve. The application of reagents  showed it to be carbonate of lime, but its source for a time remained a  mystery.    \"The larger particles,\" said Thorndyke, with his eye applied to the  microscope, \"appear to be transparent, crystalline, and distinctly  laminated in structure. It is not chalk, it is not whiting, it is not  any kind of cement. What can it be?\"    \"Could it be any kind of shell?\" I suggested. \"For instance--\"    \"Of course!\" he exclaimed, starting up; \"you have hit it, Jervis, as you  always do. It must be mother-of-pearl. Polton, give me a pearl  shirt-button out of your oddments box.\"    The button was duly produced by the thrifty Polton, dropped into an  agate mortar, and speedily reduced to powder, a tiny pinch of which  Thorndyke placed under the microscope.    \"This powder,\" said he, \"is, naturally, much coarser than our specimen,  but the identity of character is unmistakable. Jervis, you are a  treasure. Just look at it.\"    I glanced down the microscope, and then pulled out my watch. \"Yes,\" I  said, \"there is no doubt about it, I think; but I must be off. Anstey  urged me to be in court by 11.30 at the latest.\"    With infinite reluctance I collected my notes and papers and departed,  leaving Thorndyke diligently copying addresses out of the Post Office  Directory.    My business at the court detained me the whole of the day, and it was  near upon dinner-time when I reached our chambers. Thorndyke had not yet  come in, but he arrived half an hour later, tired and hungry, and not  very communicative.    \"What have I done?\" he repeated, in answer to my inquiries. \"I have  walked miles of dirty pavement, and I have visited every pearl-shell  cutter's in London, with one exception, and I have not found what I  was looking for. The one mother-of-pearl factory that remains, however,  is the most likely, and I propose to look in there to-morrow morning.  Meanwhile, we have completed our data, with Polton's assistance. Here is  a tracing of our friend's skull taken from the mould; you see it is an  extreme type of brachycephalic skull, and markedly unsymmetrical. Here  is a transverse section of his hair, which is quite circular--unlike  yours or mine, which would be oval. We have the mother-of-pearl dust  from the outside of the hat, and from the inside similar dust mixed with  various fibres and a few granules of rice starch. Those are our data.\"    [Illustration: TRANSVERSE SECTIONS OF HUMAN HAIR: _A_, OF A NEGRO; _B_,  OF AN ENGLISHMAN; _C_, OF THE BURGLAR. ALL MAGNIFIED 600 DIAMETERS.]    \"Supposing the hat should not be that of the burglar after all?\" I  suggested.    \"That would be annoying. But I think it is his, and I think I can guess  at the nature of the art treasures that were stolen.\"    \"And you don't intend to enlighten me?\"    \"My dear fellow,\" he replied, \"you have all the data. Enlighten yourself  by the exercise of your own brilliant faculties. Don't give way to  mental indolence.\"    I endeavoured, from the facts in my possession, to construct the  personality of the mysterious burglar, and failed utterly; nor was I  more successful in my endeavour to guess at the nature of the stolen  property; and it was not until the following morning, when we had set  out on our quest and were approaching Limehouse, that Thorndyke would  revert to the subject.    \"We are now,\" he said, \"going to the factory of Badcomb and Martin,  shell importers and cutters, in the West India Dock Road. If I don't  find my man there, I shall hand the facts over to the police, and waste  no more time over the case.\"    \"What is your man like?\" I asked.    \"I am looking for an elderly Japanese, wearing a new hat or, more  probably, a cap, and having a bruise on his right cheek or temple. I am  also looking for a cab-yard; but here we are at the works, and as it is  now close on the dinner-hour, we will wait and see the hands come out  before making any inquiries.\"    We walked slowly past the tall, blank-faced building, and were just  turning to re-pass it when a steam whistle sounded, a wicket opened in  the main gate, and a stream of workmen--each powdered with white, like a  miller--emerged into the street. We halted to watch the men as they came  out, one by one, through the wicket, and turned to the right or left  towards their homes or some adjacent coffee-shop; but none of them  answered to the description that my friend had given.    The outcoming stream grew thinner, and at length ceased; the wicket was  shut with a bang, and once more Thorndyke's quest appeared to have  failed.    \"Is that all of them, I wonder?\" he said, with a shade of disappointment  in his tone; but even as he spoke the wicket opened again, and a leg  protruded. The leg was followed by a back and a curious globular head,  covered with iron-grey hair, and surmounted by a cloth cap, the whole  appertaining to a short, very thick-set man, who remained thus,  evidently talking to someone inside.    Suddenly he turned his head to look across the street; and immediately I  recognized, by the pallid yellow complexion and narrow eye-slits, the  physiognomy of a typical Japanese. The man remained talking for nearly  another minute; then, drawing out his other leg, he turned towards us;  and now I perceived that the right side of his face, over the prominent  cheekbone, was discoloured as though by a severe bruise.    \"Ha!\" said Thorndyke, turning round sharply as the man approached,  \"either this is our man or it is an incredible coincidence.\" He walked  away at a moderate pace, allowing the Japanese to overtake us slowly,  and when the man had at length passed us, he increased his speed  somewhat, so as to maintain the distance.    Our friend stepped along briskly, and presently turned up a side street,  whither we followed at a respectful distance, Thorndyke holding open his  pocket-book, and appearing to engage me in an earnest discussion, but  keeping a sharp eye on his quarry.    \"There he goes!\" said my colleague, as the man suddenly  disappeared--\"the house with the green window-sashes. That will be  number thirteen.\"    It was; and, having verified the fact, we passed on, and took the next  turning that would lead us back to the main road.    Some twenty minutes later, as we were strolling past the door of a  coffee-shop, a man came out, and began to fill his pipe with an air of  leisurely satisfaction. His hat and clothes were powdered with white  like those of the workmen whom we had seen come out of the factory.  Thorndyke accosted him.    \"Is that a flour-mill up the road there?\"    \"No, sir; pearl-shell. I work there myself.\"    \"Pearl-shell, eh?\" said Thorndyke. \"I suppose that will be an industry  that will tend to attract the aliens. Do you find it so?\"    \"No, sir; not at all. The work's too hard. We've only got one foreigner  in the place, and he ain't an alien--he's a Jap.\"    \"A Jap!\" exclaimed Thorndyke. \"Really. Now, I wonder if that would  chance to be our old friend Kotei--you remember Kotei?\" he added,  turning to me.    \"No, sir; this man's name is Futashima. There was another Jap in the  works, a chap named Itu, a pal of Futashima's, but he's left.\"    \"Ah! I don't know either of them. By the way, usen't there to be a  cab-yard just about here?\"    \"There's a yard up Rankin Street where they keep vans and one or two  cabs. That chap Itu works there now. Taken to horseflesh. Drives a van  sometimes. Queer start for a Jap.\"    \"Very.\" Thorndyke thanked the man for his information, and we sauntered  on towards Rankin Street. The yard was at this time nearly deserted,  being occupied only by an ancient and crazy four-wheeler and a very  shabby hansom.    \"Curious old houses, these that back on to the yard,\" said Thorndyke,  strolling into the enclosure. \"That timber gable, now,\" pointing to a  house, from a window of which a man was watching us suspiciously, \"is  quite an interesting survival.\"    \"What's your business, mister?\" demanded the man in a gruff tone.    \"We are just having a look at these quaint old houses,\" replied  Thorndyke, edging towards the back of the hansom, and opening his  pocket-book, as though to make a sketch.    \"Well, you can see 'em from outside,\" said the man.    [Illustration: THORNDYKE'S STRATEGY.]    \"So we can,\" said Thorndyke suavely, \"but not so well, you know.\"    At this moment the pocket-book slipped from his hand and fell,  scattering a number of loose papers about the ground under the hansom,  and our friend at the window laughed joyously.    \"No hurry,\" murmured Thorndyke, as I stooped to help him to gather up  the papers--which he did in the most surprisingly slow and clumsy  manner. \"It is fortunate that the ground is dry.\" He stood up with the  rescued papers in his hand, and, having scribbled down a brief note,  slipped the book in his pocket.    \"Now you'd better mizzle,\" observed the man at the window.    \"Thank you,\" replied Thorndyke, \"I think we had;\" and, with a pleasant  nod at the custodian, he proceeded to adopt the hospitable suggestion.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Mr. Marchmont has been here, sir, with Inspector Badger and another  gentleman,\" said Polton, as we entered our"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13888"],[0,"Bacon (#19)"],[1," been upon the head form. If your Majesty find any aptness in       me, or if you find any scarcity in others, whereby you may think it       fit for your service to remove me to business of State, although I       have a fair way before me for profit (and by your Majesty's grace       and favour for honour and advancement), and in a course less       exposed to the blasts of fortune, _yet now that he is gone, quo       vivente virtutibus certissimum exitium_, I will be ready as a       chessman to be wherever your Majesty's royal hand shall set me.       Your Majesty will bear me witness, I have not suddenly opened       myself thus far. I have looked upon others, I see the exceptions,       I see the distractions, and I fear Tacitus will be a prophet,       _magis alii homines quam alii mores_. I know mine own heart, and I       know not whether God that hath touched my heart with the affection       may not touch your royal heart to discern it. Howsoever, I shall at       least go on honestly in mine ordinary course, and supply the rest       in prayers for you, remaining, etc.\"    This is no hasty outburst. In a later paper on the true way of  retrieving the disorders of the King's finances, full of large and wise  counsel, after advising the King not to be impatient, and assuring him  that a state of debt is not so intolerable--\"for it is no new thing for  the greatest Kings to be in debt,\" and all the great men of the Court  had been in debt without any \"manner of diminution of their  greatness\"--he returns to the charge in detail against Salisbury and the  Great Contract.         \"My second prayer is, that your Majesty--in respect to the hasty       freeing of your state--would not descend to any means, or degree of       means, which carrieth not a symmetry with your Majesty and       greatness. _He is gone from whom those courses did wholly flow._ To       have your wants and necessities in particular as it were hanged up       in two tablets before the eyes of your lords and commons, to be       talked of for four months together; To have all your courses to       help yourself in revenue or profit put into printed books, which       were wont to be held _arcana imperii_; To have such worms of       aldermen to lend for ten in the hundred upon good assurance, and       with such entreaty (?) as if it should save the bark of your       fortune; To contract still where mought be had the readiest       payment, and not the best bargain; To stir a number of projects for       your profit, and then to blast them, and leave your Majesty nothing       but the scandal of them; To pretend even carriage between your       Majesty's rights and ease of the people, and to satisfy neither.       These courses and others the like I hope are gone with the deviser       of them; which have turned your Majesty to inestimable prejudice.\"    And what he thought of saying, but on further consideration struck out,  was the following. It is no wonder that he struck it out, but it shows  what he felt towards Cecil.        \"I protest to God, though I be not superstitious, when I saw your      M.'s book against Vorstius and Arminius, and noted your zeal to      deliver the majesty of God from the vain and indign comprehensions      of heresy and degenerate philosophy, as you had by your pen formerly      endeavoured to deliver kings from the usurpation of Rome, _perculsit      illico animum_ that God would set shortly upon you some visible      favour, _and let me not live if I thought not of the taking away of      that man_.\"    And from this time onwards he scarcely ever mentions Cecil's name in his  correspondence with James but with words of condemnation, which imply  that Cecil's mischievous policy was the result of private ends. Yet this  was the man to whom he had written the \"New Year's Tide\" letter six  months before; a letter which is but an echo to the last of all that he  had been accustomed to write to Cecil when asking assistance or offering  congratulation. Cecil had, indeed, little claim on Bacon's gratitude; he  had spoken him fair in public, and no doubt in secret distrusted and  thwarted him. But to the last Bacon did not choose to acknowledge this.  Had James disclosed something of his dead servant, who left some strange  secrets behind him, which showed his unsuspected hostility to Bacon?  Except on this supposition (but there is nothing to support it), no  exaggeration of the liberty allowed to the language of compliment is  enough to clear Bacon of an insincerity which is almost inconceivable in  any but the meanest tools of power.    \"I assure myself,\" wrote Bacon to the King, \"your Majesty taketh not me  for one of a busy nature; for my estate being free from all  difficulties, and I having such a large field for contemplation, as I  have partly and shall much more make manifest unto your Majesty and the  world, to occupy my thoughts, nothing could make me active but love and  affection.\" So Bacon described his position with questionable  accuracy--for his estate was not \"free from difficulties\"--in the new  time coming. He was still kept out of the inner circle of the Council;  but from the moment of Salisbury's death he became a much more important  person. He still sued for advancement, and still met with  disappointment; the \"mean men\" still rose above him. The lucrative place  of Master of the Wards was vacated by Salisbury's death. Bacon was  talked of for it, and probably expected it, for he drew up new rules for  it, and a speech for the new master; but the office and the speech went  to Sir George Carey. Soon after Sir George Carey died. Bacon then  applied for it through the new favourite, Rochester. \"He was so  confident of the place that he put most of his men into new cloaks;\" and  the world of the day amused itself at his disappointment, when the place  was given to another \"mean man,\" Sir Walter Cope, of whom the gossips  wrote that if the \"last two Treasurers could look out of their graves to  see those successors in that place, they would be out of countenance  with themselves, and say to the world _quantum mutatus_.\" But Bacon's  hand and counsel appear more and more in important matters--the  improvement of the revenue; the defence of extreme rights of the  prerogative in the case against Whitelocke; the great question of  calling a parliament, and of the true and \"princely\" way of dealing with  it. His confidential advice to the King about calling a parliament was  marked by his keen perception of the facts of the situation; it was  marked too by his confident reliance on skilful indirect methods and  trust in the look of things; it bears traces also of his bitter feeling  against Salisbury, whom he charges with treacherously fomenting the  opposition of the last Parliament. There was no want of worldly wisdom  in it; certainly it was more adapted to James's ideas of state-craft  than the simpler plan of Sir Henry Nevill, that the King should throw  himself frankly on the loyalty and good-will of Parliament. And thus he  came to be on easy terms with James, who was quite capable of  understanding Bacon's resource and nimbleness of wit. In the autumn of  1613 the Chief-Justiceship of the King's Bench became vacant. Bacon at  once gave the King reasons for sending Coke from the Common Pleas--where  he was a check on the prerogative--to the King's Bench, where he could  do less harm; while Hobart went to the Common Pleas. The promotion was  obvious, but the Common Pleas suited Coke better, and the place was more  lucrative. Bacon's advice was followed. Coke, very reluctantly, knowing  well who had given it, and why, \"not only weeping himself but followed  by the tears\" of all the Court of Common Pleas, moved up to the higher  post. The Attorney Hobart succeeded, and Bacon at last became Attorney  (October 27, 1613). In Chamberlain's gossip we have an indication, such  as occurs only accidentally, of the view of outsiders: \"There is a  strong apprehension that little good is to be expected by this change,  and that Bacon may prove a dangerous instrument.\"          CHAPTER V.    BACON ATTORNEY-GENERAL AND CHANCELLOR.      Thus, at last, at the age of fifty-two, Bacon had gained the place which  Essex had tried to get for him at thirty-two. The time of waiting had  been a weary one, and it is impossible not to see that it had been  hurtful to Bacon. A strong and able man, very eager to have a field for  his strength and ability, who is kept out of it, as he thinks unfairly,  and is driven to an attitude of suppliant dependency in pressing his  claim on great persons who amuse him with words, can hardly help  suffering in the humiliating process. It does a man no good to learn to  beg, and to have a long training in the art. And further, this long  delay kept up the distraction of his mind between the noble work on  which his soul was bent, and the necessities of that \"civil\" or  professional and political life by which he had to maintain his estate.  All the time that he was \"canvassing\" (it is his own word) for office,  and giving up his time and thoughts to the work which it involved, the  great _Instauration_ had to wait his hours of leisure; and his  exclamation, so often repeated, _Multum incola fuit anima mea_, bears  witness to the longings that haunted him in his hours of legal drudgery,  or in the service of his not very thankful employers. Not but that he  found compensation in the interest of public questions, in the company  of the great, in the excitement of state-craft and state employment, in  the pomp and enjoyment of court life. He found too much compensation; it  was one of his misfortunes. But his heart was always sound in its  allegiance to knowledge; and if he had been fortunate enough to have  risen earlier to the greatness which he aimed at as a vantage-ground for  his true work, or if he had had self-control to have dispensed with  wealth and position--if he"]]]
