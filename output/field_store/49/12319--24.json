How sad the groves and plains appear,        And sympathetic sheep:    Even pitying hills would drop a tear!        --If hills could learn to weep.      His bounty in exalted strain        Each bard might well display:    Since none implor'd relief in vain!        --That went reliev'd away.      And hark! I hear the tuneful throng;        His obsequies forbid.    He still shall live, shall live as long        --As ever dead man did.                              _Oliver Goldsmith_.          _AN ELEGY_      _On the Glory of her Sex, Mrs. Mary Blaize_      Good people all, with one accord,        Lament for Madam Blaize,    Who never wanted a good word--        From those who spoke her praise.      The needy seldom pass'd her door,        And always found her kind;    She freely lent to all the poor--        Who left a pledge behind.      She strove the neighborhood to please        With manners wondrous winning;    And never follow'd wicked ways--        Unless when she was sinning.      At church, in silks and satins new,        With hoop of monstrous size,    She never slumber'd in her pew--        But when she shut her eyes.      Her love was sought, I do aver,        By twenty beaux and more;    The King himself has follow'd her--        When she has walk'd before.      But now, her wealth and finery fled,        Her hangers-on cut short all;    The doctors found, when she was dead--        Her last disorder mortal.      Let us lament, in sorrow sore,        For Kent Street well may say,    That had she lived a twelvemonth more--        She had not died to-day.                              _Oliver Goldsmith_.          _PARSON GRAY_      A quiet home had Parson Gray,        Secluded in a vale;    His daughters all were feminine,        And all his sons were male.      How faithfully did Parson Gray        The bread of life dispense--    Well \"posted\" in theology,        And post and rail his fence.      'Gainst all the vices of the age        He manfully did battle;    His chickens were a biped breed,        And quadruped his cattle.      No clock more punctually went,        He ne'er delayed a minute--    Nor ever empty was his purse,        When he had money in it.      His piety was ne'er denied;        His truths hit saint and sinner;    At morn he always breakfasted;        He always dined at dinner.      He ne'er by any luck was grieved,        By any care perplexed--    No filcher he, though when he preached,        He always \"took\" a text.      As faithful characters he drew        As mortal ever saw;    But ah! poor parson! when he died,        His breath he could not draw!                              _Oliver Goldsmith_.          _AN ELEGY ON THE DEATH OF A MAD DOG_      Good people all, of every sort,        Give ear unto my song;    And if you find it wondrous short,--        It cannot hold you long.      In Islington there was a man,        Of whom the world might say    That still a godly race he ran,--        Whene'er he went to pray.      A kind and gentle heart he had,        To comfort friends and foes;    The naked every day he clad,--        When he put on his clothes.      And in that town a dog was found,        As many dogs there be,    Both mongrel, puppy, whelp, and hound,        And curs of low degree.      The dog and man at first were friends;        But when a pique began,    The dog, to gain some private ends,        Went mad, and bit the man.      Around from all the neighboring streets,        The wondering neighbors ran,    And swore the dog had lost his wits        To bite so good a man.      The wound it seemed both sore and sad        To every Christian eye;    And while they swore the dog was mad        They swore the man would die.      But soon a wonder came to light,        That showed the rogues they lied;    The man recovered of the bite,        The dog it was that died.                              _Oliver Goldsmith_.          _THE WONDERFUL OLD MAN_      There was an old man        Who lived on a common    And, if fame speaks true,        He was born of a woman.    Perhaps you will laugh,        But for truth I've been told    He once was an infant        Tho' age made him old.      Whene'er he was hungry        He longed for some meat;    And if he could get it        'T was said he would eat.    When thirsty he'd drink        If you gave him a pot,    And what he drank mostly        Ran down his throat.      He seldom or never        Could see without light,    And yet I've been told he        Could hear in the night.    He has oft been awake        In the daytime, 't is said,    And has fallen asleep        As he lay in his bed.      'T is reported his tongue        Always moved when he talk'd,    And he stirred both his arms        And his legs when he walk'd;    And his gait was so odd        Had you seen him you 'd burst,    For one leg or t' other        Would always be first.      His face was the drollest        That ever was seen,    For if 't was not washed        It seldom was clean;    His teeth he expos'd when        He happened to grin,    And his mouth stood across        'Twixt his nose and his chin.      When this whimsical chap        Had a river to pass,    If he couldn't get over        He stayed where he was.    'T is said he ne'er ventured        To quit the dry ground,    Yet so great was his luck        He never was drowned.      At last he fell sick,        As old chronicles tell,    And then, as folks say,        He was not very well.    But what was as strange        In so weak a condition,    As he could not give fees        He could get no physician.      What wonder he died!        Yet 't is said that his death    Was occasioned at last        By the loss of his breath.    But peace to his bones        Which in ashes now moulder.    Had he lived a day longer        He'd have been a day older.                              _Anonymous_          _A CHRONICLE_      Once--but no matter when--        There lived--no matter where--    A man, whose name--but then        I need not that declare.      He--well, he had been born,        And so he was alive;    His age--I details scorn--        Was somethingty and five.      He lived--how many years        I truly can't decide;    But this one fact appears        He lived--until he died.      \"He died,\" I have averred,        But cannot prove 't was so,    But that he was interred,        At any rate, I know.      I fancy he'd a son,        I hear he had a wife:    Perhaps he'd more than one,        I know not, on my life!      But whether he was rich,        Or whether he was poor,    Or neither--both--or which,        I cannot say, I'm sure.      I can't recall his name,        Or what he used to do:    But then--well, such is fame!        'T will so serve me and you.      And that is why I thus,        About this unknown man    Would fain create a fuss,        To rescue, if I can.      From dark oblivion's blow,        Some record of his lot:    But, ah! I do not know        Who--where--when--why--or what.      MORAL      In this brief pedigree        A moral we should find--    But what it ought to be        Has quite escaped my mind!                              _Anonymous_.          _ON THE OXFORD CARRIER_      Here lieth one, who did most truly prove    That he could never die while he could move;    So hung his destiny never to rot    While he might still jog on and keep his trot;    Made of sphere metal, never to decay    Until his revolution was at stay.    Time numbers motion, yet (without a crime    'Gainst old truth) motion number'd out his time,    And like an engine moved with wheel and weight,    His principles being ceased, he ended straight.    Rest, that gives all men life, gave him his death,    And too much breathing put him out of breath;    Nor were it contradiction to affirm,    Too long vacation hasten'd on his term.    Merely to drive the time away he sicken'd,    Fainted, and died, nor would with ale be quicken'd;    \"Nay,\" quoth he, on his swooning bed outstretch'd,    \"If I mayn't carry, sure I'll ne'er be fetch'd,    But vow, though the cross doctors all stood hearers,    For one carrier put down to make six bearers.\"    Ease was his chief disease; and to judge right,    He died for heaviness that his cart went light:    His leisure told him that his time was come,    And lack of load made his life burdensome.    That even to his last breath (there be that say't),    As he were press'd to death, he cried, \"More weight;\"    But, had his doings lasted as they were,    He had been an immortal carrier.    Obedient to the moon he spent his date    In course reciprocal, and had his fate    Link'd to the mutual flowing of the seas,    Yet (strange to think) his wane was his increase:    His letters are deliver'd all, and gone,    Only remains the superscription.                              _John Milton_.          _NEPHELIDIA_      From the depth of the dreamy decline of the dawn        through a notable nimbus of nebulous noonshine,    Pallid and pink as the palm of the flag-flower        that flickers with fear of the flies as they float,    Are they looks of our lovers that lustrously lean from a marvel        of mystic miraculous moonshine,    These that we feel in the blood of our blushes that thicken and        threaten with sobs from the throat?    Thicken and thrill as a theatre thronged at appeal of an actor's        appalled agitation,    Fainter with fear of the fires of the future than pale with the        promise of pride in the past;    Flushed with the  famishing fulness of fever that reddens with        radiance of rathe recreation,    Gaunt as the ghastliest of glimpses that gleam through the gloom        of the gloaming when ghosts go aghast?    Nay, for the nick of the tick of the time is a tremulous touch "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9408"],[0,"By Water to the Columbian Exposition (#18)"],[1,"ry. In this enormous collection we discovered a block of pure  nickel weighing 4,600 pounds as well as very large nuggets of native gold  and silver. Mexico made its most extensive contributions to this  departmental structure. Brazil, the Argentine Republic, Russia, Spain,  Greece, Italy, Japan, Belgium, Austria, Ecuador, and other foreign nations  were likewise well represented.    The most prominent exhibits were grouped in the eastern section of the  ground floor. They proved the unexcelled mineral wealth of the United  States, particularly in iron, the annual production exceeding 10,000,000  tons.    Pennsylvania took the leading place being pre-eminent in her iron and  steel industries. Her supremacy in the production of \"black diamonds\" was  manifested by a rich display; one trophy from her immense coal-mines was a  shaft of coal sixty-two feet high, and ten feet square. Colorado's fine  exhibit of precious metals had, as an appropriate frame, a beautiful  pavilion erected entirely from her local products. The abundance of gold  in this important mining state is evinced by the fact that twenty-one of  her thirty-three counties are producing that most desirable and malleable  of all metals.    California--nicknamed the \"Golden State\"--showed among her vast resources  gold, silver, platinum, quicksilver, copper, lead, zinc, iron, tin,  graphite, crystal, alabaster, corundum, chrysolites, tourmalines, garnets,  diamonds, and other gems. Montana had most largely contributed to this  departmental structure, and inclosed her display of precious metals in a  temple adorned by the famous statue of Justice. Cast from pure silver  valuing $315,000, and modeled after the celebrated actress--Mademoiselle  Rehan--it was set upon a pedestal of gold, forming altogether a work of  art of rare magnificence.    Michigan illustrated attractively her great copper industry; the deposits  of this metal among the primary rocks of her northern section being the  richest in the world.    Of special interest were the mining products of New Jersey. This state  furnished minerals not found anywhere else; for instance the  franklinite--a compound of iron, zinc, and manganese--named from Dr.  Franklin.    Missouri, the first state in the Union to place exhibits in the Mines  Building, environed the same with a beautiful pavilion built from local  products.    The curiosities included in the various State and Territorial displays,  were too numerous to give an account of them all.    Special features were--a miniature coal-mine shown by Iowa; a section of  the world-renowned Mammoth Cave in Kentucky; a statue of rock salt  representing Lot's wife, a contribution from Louisiana; a tunnel  containing a double tramway for the carrying of ore displayed by  Pennsylvania; a model of the largest lead-reducing works in the world from  Missouri; and a miner's cabin built of mineral specimens from the  different counties in the territory of New Mexico.    All the mining exhibits--in their selectness and profusion--gave evidence  of the inexhaustible wealth yet stored up for man's future uses  notwithstanding the geological fact, that the earth's crust has no great  profundity compared with its diameter.    The \"_Golden Door_\" an immense archway enriched to an extraordinary degree  with carvings, paintings, and overlaid with gold leaf, ushered us into the  TRANSPORTATION BUILDING. It was dedicated to present the origin, growth,  and development of the various methods of abridging distance used in all  parts of the inhabited globe--from remote antiquity up to the present day.    We were charmed with a striking vista of richly ornamented colonnades  which added considerably to the impressive effect of the exhibits. The  latter comprised three general divisions: the railway--marine--and  ordinary road vehicle transportation.    To the first mentioned--as most important--a space of over eight acres had  been devoted. About one-eighth of this area was covered with the \"Railways  of the World,\" an exhibit of the Baltimore and Ohio Railway Co., showing  the development of locomotives and cars from the earliest days to the  modern time. One of the unique features in the American Railroad Section  was the operation of air brakes on a train of a hundred cars, the longest  ever witnessed in a single series.    In the center aisle of the annex, we inspected the chief display of the  Pullman Company, a complete train sumptuously equipped. It embraced  specially built Pullman Cars of the most luxurious character. The  representation of the New York & Chicago Limited Express was, without  doubt, the finest railway train ever constructed.    We received a very adequate idea of the wonderful achievements--evincing  the genius of the age in which we live--in railway conveyance, by the  out-of-door exhibit of the N.Y. Central & Hudson R.R. Co., at the southern  extremity of the annex. Here, the contrast between past and present was  most sharply drawn: The first train, ever used for traffic in this  country, and running between Schenectady and Albany, N.Y.--the opening of  this road was celebrated on the 24th of September, 1831--with its simple  De Witt Clinton engine, was beside a locomotive of gigantic proportions,  the fastest in the world. This stupendous piece of machinery constituted a  portion of the Vanderbilt enterprise.    In the German Section, two locomotives and seven kinds of  _Eisenbahnwagen_, enabled us to decide upon the relative advantages of  this foreign system and the American method of railway transportation.  Great Britain contributed a complete train and locomotive, also a model of  one of the original Stephenson locomotives--the \"Rocket.\" The Railway  Division of France comprised exceedingly interesting French locomotives, a  car, and many models. In the Canadian exhibit, a complete transcontinental  train compelled admiration. Its cars built of solid mahogany, and lighted  by electricity, were constructed and equipped by the Canadian Pacific  Railroad Company. Other foreign nations made their contributions to the  railway division by models or illustrations of different kinds;  prominently Austria, Belgium, Mexico, New South Wales, Sweden, and Norway.    The means of water transportation were so diversified that their  multiplicity can distinctly be conceived by those only who have viewed  them _in persona_.    There were represented: the birch-bark canoe from Alaska--a Norwegian  steamship in miniature--the bimba or log canoe from Africa--the Bohemian  propeller--corials from British Guiana--the Japanese pleasure-boat  \"Hoomaru\"--the padda boats from Ceylon--the caique from Turkey;  furthermore, models of Spanish war-vessels--Malay boats--Swedish  ice-yachts--folding boats from Canada--Chinese war-ships--barges from  Burmah--French torpedo boats--characteristic coast-vessels from India--  Venetian gondolas--Dutch coast sailing boats--the caravels, Santa Maria,  Nina and Pinta, exhibited by Genoa--Siamese boats--life-boats--naptha  launches--and a great number of small craft shown by the United States.    Of historic interest was the old _bateau_ employed by early French traders  from Quebec, and a model of a boat showing the style used on the Sea of  Galilee in the time of Christ.    The artistic reproductions in miniature of various American, British, and  German ocean steamers played an attractive part in this division. Among  the models of war vessels was the representation of the ill-fated English  cruiser \"Victoria,\" considered to be the finest marine model ever  constructed.    A section from the center of a modern Transatlantic liner reached to the  top line of the gallery; exhibiting a complete interior of an American  steamer.    The development of wheeled vehicles from the first inceptive idea of the  wheel to the present appreciable methods of its use was comprehensively  illustrated. The exhibits were so arranged that the different stages of  improvement could be readily noticed.    The methods employed for conveyance on common roads were shown by  hand-barrows--carts--trucks--drays--farm wagons--sprinkling carts--freight  wagons--breaks, barges, wagonettes for pleasure parties--omnibuses--cabs--  hansoms--pleasure carriages, coaches for four or six horses, Victorias,  broughams, dog-carts, buggies, phaetons, etc.; besides sleighs--snow  shoes--steam and electric carriages--ambulances for the sick and  injured--hearses; furthermore, bicycles and tricycles--rolling chairs for  invalids--baby carriages; in short, vehicles of every possible description.    Almost all the nations on the globe had made their contributions to the  department of vehicle transportation. This rare collection embraced the  palanquin of Africa--the mandarin chair of China--the bullock cart of  Ceylon--the sedan chair of Colombia (South America)--the Sicilian cart of  Palermo--the heavy lumbering cart of India--the queer traveling kroba of  Turkey--the volante of Spain--the tarantass of Russia--the hackney coach  of France--and the dog-cart of England.    Among the relics of special interest to Americans because of their  association with historical personages, we beheld the well preserved  carriages of Daniel Webster and James Knox Polk.    A conspicuous feature in the central court was a model of the largest  steam hammer in the world, utilized in the manufacture of armor plate for  vessels.    On entering the PALACE OF HORTICULTURE north of the Transportation  Building, our organs of sight and olfactory nerves were equally affected  by the dazzling and odoriferous display of exuberant flowers and fruitage.  Had it been admissible, we would have been glad to put our organs of  tasting in active operation, likewise. For, we longed to try the relish of  some of the exquisite pomological exhibits, whose multiformity was too  immense to be portrayed in a pen-picture. Fruits of every form and  description, sent from all zones, climes, and countries were"]]]
