And when he had got him out, he told him that if he could answer him  three questions his life should be spared. So the first head asked: \"A  thing without an end, what's that?\" But the young man knew not. Then the  second head said: \"The smaller, the more dangerous, what's that?\" But  the young man knew it not. And then the third head asked: \"The dead  carrying the living; riddle me that?\" But the young man had to give it  up. The lad not being able to answer one of these questions, the Red  Ettin took a mallet and knocked him on the head, and turned him into a  pillar of stone.    On the morning after this happened, the younger brother took out the  knife to look at it, and he was grieved to find it all brown with rust.  He told his mother that the time was now come for him to go away upon  his travels also; so she requested him to take the can to the well for  water, that she might make a cake for him. And he went, and as he was  bringing home the water, a raven over his head cried to him to look, and  he would see that the water was running out. And he was a young man of  sense, and seeing the water running out, he took some clay and patched  up the holes, so that he brought home enough water to bake a large cake.  When his mother put it to him to take the half cake with her blessing,  he took it in preference to having the whole with her malison; and yet  the half was bigger than what the other lad had got.    So he went away on his journey; and after he had travelled a far way, he  met with an old woman that asked him if he would give her a bit of his  johnny-cake. And he said: \"I will gladly do that,\" and so he gave her a  piece of the johnny-cake; and for that she gave him a magical wand, that  she might yet be of service to him, if he took care to use it rightly.  Then the old woman, who was a fairy, told him a great deal that would  happen to him, and what he ought to do in all circumstances; and after  that she vanished in an instant out of his sight. He went on a great way  farther, and then he came up to the old man herding the sheep; and when  he asked whose sheep these were, the answer was:      \"The Red Ettin of Ireland      Once lived in Ballygan,    And stole King Malcolm's daughter,      The king of Fair Scotland.      \"He beats her, he binds her,      He lays her on a band;    And every day he strikes her      With a bright silver wand.    Like Julian the Roman,    He's one that fears no man.      \"But now I fear his end is near,      And destiny at hand;    And you're to be, I plainly see,      The heir of all his land.\"    When he came to the place where the monstrous beasts were standing, he  did not stop nor run away, but went boldly through amongst them. One  came up roaring with open mouth to devour him, when he struck it with  his wand, and laid it in an instant dead at his feet. He soon came to  the Ettin's castle, where he knocked, and was admitted. The old woman  who sat by the fire warned him of the terrible Ettin, and what had been  the fate of his brother; but he was not to be daunted. The monster soon  came in, saying:      \"Snouk but and snouk ben,    I find the smell of an earthly man;    Be he living, or be he dead,    His heart shall be kitchen to my bread.\"    He quickly espied the young man, and bade him come forth on the floor.  And then he put the three questions to him; but the young man had been  told everything by the good fairy, so he was able to answer all the  questions. So when the first head asked, \"What's the thing without an  end?\" he said: \"A bowl.\" And when the second head said: \"The smaller the  more dangerous; what's that?\" he said at once, \"A bridge.\" And last, the  third head said: \"When does the dead carry the living, riddle me that?\"  Then the young man answered up at once and said: \"When a ship sails on  the sea with men inside her.\" When the Ettin found this, he knew that  his power was gone. The young man then took up an axe and hewed off the  monster's three heads. He next asked the old woman to show him where the  king's daughter lay; and the old woman took him upstairs, and opened a  great many doors, and out of every door came a beautiful lady who had  been imprisoned there by the Ettin; and one of the ladies was the king's  daughter. She also took him down into a low room, and there stood a  stone pillar, that he had only to touch with his wand, when his brother  started into life. And the whole of the prisoners were overjoyed at  their deliverance, for which they thanked the young man. Next day they  all set out for the king's court, and a gallant company they made. And  the king married his daughter to the young man that had delivered  her, and gave a noble's daughter to his brother; and so they all lived  happily all the rest of their days.          THE GOLDEN ARM    Here was once a man who travelled the land all over in search of a wife.  He saw young and old, rich and poor, pretty and plain, and could not  meet with one to his mind. At last he found a woman, young, fair, and  rich, who possessed a right arm of solid gold. He married her at once,  and thought no man so fortunate as he was. They lived happily together,  but, though he wished people to think otherwise, he was fonder of the  golden arm than of all his wife's gifts besides.    At last she died. The husband put on the blackest black, and pulled the  longest face at the funeral; but for all that he got up in the middle of  the night, dug up the body, and cut off the golden arm. He hurried home  to hide his treasure, and thought no one would know.    The following night he put the golden arm under his pillow, and was just  falling asleep, when the ghost of his dead wife glided into the room.  Stalking up to the bedside it drew the curtain, and looked at him  reproachfully. Pretending not to be afraid, he spoke to the ghost, and  said: \"What hast thou done with thy cheeks so red?\"    \"All withered and wasted away,\" replied the ghost, in a hollow tone.    \"What hast thou done with thy red rosy lips?\"    \"All withered and wasted away.\"    \"What hast thou done with thy golden hair?\"    \"All withered and wasted away.\"    \"What hast thou done with thy _Golden Arm_?\"    \"THOU HAST IT!\"          THE HISTORY OF TOM THUMB    In the days of the great Prince Arthur, there lived a mighty magician,  called Merlin, the most learned and skilful enchanter the world has ever  seen.    This famous magician, who could take any form he pleased, was travelling  about as a poor beggar, and being very tired, he stopped at the cottage  of a ploughman to rest himself, and asked for some food.    The countryman bade him welcome, and his wife, who was a very  good-hearted woman, soon brought him some milk in a wooden bowl, and  some coarse brown bread on a platter.    Merlin was much pleased with the kindness of the ploughman and his  wife; but he could not help noticing that though everything was neat  and comfortable in the cottage, they seemed both to be very unhappy. He  therefore asked them why they were so melancholy, and learned that they  were miserable because they had no children.    The poor woman said, with tears in her eyes: \"I should be the happiest  creature in the world if I had a son; although he was no bigger than my  husband's thumb, I would be satisfied.\"    Merlin was so much amused with the idea of a boy no bigger than a man's  thumb, that he determined to grant the poor woman's wish. Accordingly,  in a short time after, the ploughman's wife had a son, who, wonderful to  relate! was not a bit bigger than his father's thumb.    The queen of the fairies, wishing to see the little fellow, came in at  the window while the mother was sitting up in the bed admiring him. The  queen kissed the child, and, giving it the name of Tom Thumb, sent for  some of the fairies, who dressed her little godson according to her  orders:      \"An oak-leaf hat he had for his crown;    His shirt of web by spiders spun;    With jacket wove of thistle's down;    His trowsers were of feathers done.    His stockings, of apple-rind, they tie    With eyelash from his mother's eye    His shoes were made of mouse's skin,    Tann'd with the downy hair within.\"    Tom never grew any larger than his father's thumb, which was only of  ordinary size; but as he got older he became very cunning and full of  tricks. When he was old enough to play with the boys, and had lost  all his own cherry-stones, he used to creep into the bags of his  playfellows, fill his pockets, and, getting out without their noticing  him, would again join in the game.    One day, however, as he was coming out of a bag of cherry-stones, where  he had been stealing as usual, the boy to whom it belonged chanced to  see him. \"Ah, ah! my little Tommy,\" said the boy, \"so I have caught you  stealing my cherry-stones at last, and you shall be rewarded for your  thievish tricks.\" On saying this, he drew the string tight round his  neck, and gave the bag such a hearty shake, that poor little Tom's legs,  thighs, and body were sadly bruised. He roared out with pain, and begged  to be let out, promising never to steal again.    A short time afterwards his mother was making a batter-pudding, and Tom,  being very anxious to see how it was made, climbed up to the edge of the  bowl; but his foot slipped, and he plumped over head and ears into  the batter, without his mother noticing him, who stirred him into the  pudding-bag, and put him in the pot to boil.    The batter filled Tom's mouth, and prevented him from crying; but, on  feeling the hot water, he kicked and struggled so much in the pot, that  his mother thought that the pudding was bewitched, and, pulling it  out of the pot, she threw it outside the door. A poor tinker, who was  passing by, lifted up the pudding, and, putting it into his budget, he  then walked off. As Tom had now got his mouth cleared of the batter, he  then"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7440"],[0,"The Koran (Al-Qur'an) (#18)"],[1," declining the matter, Ali at length rose up and declared that  he would be his assistant, and vehemently threatened those who should oppose  him.  Mohammed upon this embraced Ali with great demonstrations of affection,  and desired all who were present to hearken to and obey him as his deputy, at  which the company broke out into great laughter, telling Abu Tâleb that he  must now pay obedience to his son.     This repulse however was so far from discouraging Mohammed, that he began  to preach in public to the people, who heard him with some patience, till he  came to upbraid them with the idolatry, obstinacy, and perverseness of  themselves and their fathers, which so highly provoked them that they declared  themselves his enemies, and would soon have procured his ruin had he not been  protected by Abu Tâleb.  The chief of the Koreish warmly solicited this person  to desert his nephew, making frequent remonstrances against the innovations he  was attempting, which proving ineffectual, they at length threatened him with  an open rupture if he did not prevail on Mohammed to desist.  At this, Abu  Tâleb was so far moved that he earnestly dissuaded his nephew from pursuing  the affair any farther, representing the great danger he and his friends must  otherwise run.  But Mohammed was not to be intimidated, telling his uncle  plainly \"that if they set the sun against him on his right hand, and the moon  on his left, he would not leave his enterprise;\" and Abu Tâleb, seeing him so  firmly resolved to proceed, used no further arguments, but promised to stand  by him against all his enemies.6     The Koreish, finding they could prevail neither by fair words nor menaces,  tried what they could do by force and ill-treatment, using Mohammed's  followers so very injuriously that it was not safe for them to continue at  Mecca any longer: whereupon Mohammed gave leave to such of them as had not  friends to protect them, to seek for refuge elsewhere.  And accordingly, in  the fifth year of the prophet's mission, sixteen of them, four of whom were  women, fled into Ethiopia; and among them Othmân Ebn Affân and his wife  Rakîah, Mohammed's      5  Kor. c. 74.  See the notes thereon.  6  Abulfeda ubi  supra.        daughter.  This was the first flight; but afterwards several others followed  them, retiring one after another, to the number of eighty-three men and  eighteen women, besides children.1  These refugees were kindly received by the  Najâshi,2 or king of Ethiopia, who refused to deliver them up to those whom  the Koreish sent to demand them, and, as the Arab writers unanimously attest,  even professed the Mohammedan religion.     In the sixth year of his mission3 Mohammed had the pleasure of seeing his  party strengthened by the conversion of his uncle Hamza, a man of great valour  and merit, and of Omar Ebn al Khattâb, a person highly esteemed, and once a  violent opposer of the prophet.  As persecution generally advances rather than  obstructs the spreading of a religion, Islamism made so great a progress among  the Arab tribes, that the Koreish, to suppress it effectually, if possible, in  the seventh year of Mohammed's mission,4 made a solemn league or covenant  against the Hashemites and the family of al Motalleb, engaging themselves to  contract no marriages with any of them, and to have no communication with  them; and to give it the greater sanction, reduced it into writing, and laid  it up in the Caaba.  Upon this the tribe became divided into two factions; and  the family of Hashem all repaired to Abu Tâleb, as their head; except only  Abd'al Uzza, surnamed Abu Laheb, who, out of his inveterate hatred to his  nephew and his doctrine, went over to the opposite party, whose chief was Abu  Sofiân Ebn Harb, of the family of Ommeya.     The families continued thus at variance for three years; but in the tenth  year of his mission, Mohammed told his uncle Abu Tâleb that GOD had manifestly  showed his disapprobation of the league which the Koreish had made against  them, by sending a worm to eat out every word of the instrument except the  name of GOD.  Of this accident Mohammed had probably some private notice; for  Abu Tâleb went immediately to the Koreish and acquainted them with it;  offering, if it proved false, to deliver his nephew up to them; but in case it  were true, he insisted that they ought to lay aside their animosity, and annul  the league they had made against the Hashemites.  To this they acquiesced, and  going to inspect the writing, to their great astonishment found it to be as  Abu Tâleb had said; and the league was thereupon declared void.     In the same year Abu Tâleb died, at the age of above fourscore; and it is  the general opinion that he died an infidel, though others say that when he  was at the point of death he embraced Mohammedism, and produce some passages  out of his poetical compositions to confirm their assertion.  About a month,  or as some write, three days after the death of this great benefactor and  patron, Mohammed had the additional mortification to lose his wife Khadîjah,  who had so generously made his fortune.  For which reason this year is called  the year of mourning.5     On the death of these two persons the Koreish began to be more troublesome  than ever to their prophet, and especially some who had formerly been his  intimate friends; insomuch that he found himself       1  Idem, Ebn Shohnah.  2  Dr. Prideaux seems to take this word  for a proper name, but it is only the title the Arabs give to every king of  this country.  See his Life of Mahomet, p. 55  3  Ebn Shohnah   4  Al Jannâbi.  1  Abulfed. p. 28.  Ebn Shohnah.          obliged to seek for shelter elsewhere, and first pitched upon Tâyet, about  sixty miles east from Mecca, for the place of his retreat.  Thither therefore  he went, accompanied by his servant Zeid, and applied himself to two of the  chief of the tribe of Thakîf, who were the inhabitants of that place; but they  received him very coldly.  However, he stayed there a month; and some of the  more considerate and better sort of men treated him with a little respect: but  the slaves and inferior people at length rose against him, and bringing him to  the wall of the city, obliged him to depart and return to Mecca, where he put  himself under the protection of al Motáam Ebn Adi.2     This repulse greatly discouraged his followers: however, Mohammed was not  wanting to himself, but boldly continued to preach to the public assemblies at  the pilgrimage, and gained several proselytes, and among them six of the  inhabitants of Yathreb of the Jewish tribe of Khazraj, who on their return  home failed not to speak much in commendation of their new religion, and  exhorted their fellow-citizens to embrace the same.     In the twelfth year of his mission it was that Mohammed gave out that he he  had made his night journey from Mecca to Jerusalem and thence to heaven,3 so  much spoken of by all that write of him.  Dr. Prideaux4 thinks he invented it  either to answer the expectations of those who demanded some miracle as a  proof of his mission, or else, by pretending to have conversed with GOD, to  establish the authority of whatever he should think fit to leave behind by way  of oral tradition, and make his sayings to serve the same purpose as the oral  law of the Jews.  But I do not find that Mohammed himself ever expected so  great a regard should be paid to his sayings, as his followers have since  done; and seeing he all along disclaimed any power of performing miracles, it  seems rather to have been a fetch of policy to raise his reputation, by  pretending to have actually conversing with GOD in heaven, as Moses had  heretofore done in the mount, and to have received several institutions  immediately from him, whereas before he contented himself with persuading them  that he had all by the ministry of Gabriel.     However, this story seemed so absurd and incredible, that several of his  followers left him upon it, and it had probably ruined the whole design, had  not Abu Becr vouched for his veracity, and declared that if Mohammed affirmed  it to be true, he verily believed the whole.  Which happy incident not only  retrieved the prophet's credit, but increased it to such a degree, that he was  secure of being able to make his disciples swallow whatever he pleased to  impose on them for the future.  And I am apt to think this fiction,  notwithstanding its extravagance, was one of the most artful contrivances  Mohammed ever put in practice, and what chiefly contributed to the raising of  his reputation to that great height to which it afterwards arrived.     In this year, called by the Mohammedans the accepted year, twelve men of  Yathreb or Medina, of whom ten were of the tribe of Khazraj, and the other two  of that of Aws, came to Mecca, and took an oath of fidelity to Mohammed at al  Akaba, a hill on the north of that city.  This oath was called the women's  oath, not that any women were pre-       2  Ebn Shohnah.  3  See the notes on the 17th chapter of the  Korân.  4  Life o Mahomet, p. 41, 51, &c.          sent at this time, but because a man was not thereby obliged to take up arms  in defence of Mohammed or his religion; it being the same oath that was  afterwards exacted of the women, the form of which we have in the Korân,1 and  is to this effect, viz.: \"That they should renounce all idolatry; that they  should not steal, nor commit fornication, nor kill their children (as the  pagan Arabs used to do when they apprehended they should not be able to  maintain them2), nor forge calumnies; and that they should obey the prophet in  all things that were reasonable.\"  When they had solemnly engaged to do all  this, Mohammed sent one of his disciples, named Masáb Ebn Omair, home with  them, to instruct them more fully in the grounds and ceremonies of his new  religion.     Masáb, being arrived at Medina, by the assistance of those who had been"]]]
