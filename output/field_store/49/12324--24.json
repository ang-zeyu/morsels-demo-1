If he wants me, let him come here and get me. I'll  not go back to his den of my own accord; that's certain. Only one place  in the Land of Oz is fit to live in, and that's the Emerald City. It's  lovely! It's almost as beautiful as I am, Ojo.\"    \"In this country,\" remarked the Shaggy Man, \"people live wherever our  Ruler tells them to. It wouldn't do to have everyone live in the  Emerald City, you know, for some must plow the land and raise grains  and fruits and vegetables, while others chop wood in the forests, or  fish in the rivers, or herd the sheep and the cattle.\"    \"Poor things!\" said Scraps.    \"I'm not sure they are not happier than the city people,\" replied the  Shaggy Man. \"There's a freedom and independence in country life that  not even the Emerald City can give one. I know that lots of the city  people would like to get back to the land. The Scarecrow lives in the  country, and so do the Tin Woodman and Jack Pumpkinhead; yet all three  would be welcome to live in Ozma's palace if they cared to. Too much  splendor becomes tiresome, you know. But, if we're to reach the Emerald  City before sundown, we must hurry, for it is yet a long way off.\"    The entrancing sight of the city had put new energy into them all and  they hurried forward with lighter steps than before. There was much to  interest them along the roadway, for the houses were now set more  closely together and they met a good many people who were coming or  going from one place or another. All these seemed happy-faced, pleasant  people, who nodded graciously to the strangers as they passed, and  exchanged words of greeting.    At last they reached the great gateway, just as the sun was setting and  adding its red glow to the glitter of the emeralds on the green walls  and spires. Somewhere inside the city a band could be heard playing  sweet music; a soft, subdued hum, as of many voices, reached their  ears; from the neighboring yards came the low mooing of cows waiting to  be milked.    They were almost at the gate when the golden bars slid back and a tall  soldier stepped out and faced them. Ojo thought he had never seen so  tall a man before. The soldier wore a handsome green and gold uniform,  with a tall hat in which was a waving plume, and he had a belt thickly  encrusted with jewels. But the most peculiar thing about him was his  long green beard, which fell far below his waist and perhaps made him  seem taller than he really was.    \"Halt!\" said the Soldier with the Green Whiskers, not in a stern voice  but rather in a friendly tone.    They halted before he spoke and stood looking at him.    \"Good evening, Colonel,\" said the Shaggy Man. \"What's the news since I  left? Anything important?\"    \"Billina has hatched out thirteen new chickens,\" replied the Soldier  with the Green Whiskers, \"and they're the cutest little fluffy yellow  balls you ever saw. The Yellow Hen is mighty proud of those children, I  can tell you.\"    \"She has a right to be,\" agreed the Shaggy Man. \"Let me see; that's  about seven thousand chicks she has hatched out; isn't it, General?\"    \"That, at least,\" was the reply. \"You will have to visit Billina and  congratulate her.\"    \"It will give me pleasure to do that,\" said the Shaggy Man. \"But you  will observe that I have brought some strangers home with me. I am  going to take them to see Dorothy.\"    \"One moment, please,\" said the soldier, barring their way as they  started to enter the gate. \"I am on duty, and I have orders to execute.  Is anyone in your party named Ojo the Unlucky?\"    \"Why, that's me!\" cried Ojo, astonished at hearing his name on the lips  of a stranger.    The Soldier with the Green Whiskers nodded. \"I thought so,\" said he,  \"and I am sorry to announce that it is my painful duty to arrest you.\"    \"Arrest me!\" exclaimed the boy. \"What for?\"    \"I haven't looked to see,\" answered the soldier. Then he drew a paper  from his breast pocket and glanced at it. \"Oh, yes; you are to be  arrested for willfully breaking one of the Laws of Oz.\"    \"Breaking a law!\" said Scraps. \"Nonsense, Soldier; you're joking.\"    \"Not this time,\" returned the soldier, with a sigh. \"My dear  child--what are you, a rummage sale or a guess-me-quick?--in me you  behold the Body-Guard of our gracious Ruler, Princess Ozma, as well as  the Royal Army of Oz and the Police Force of the Emerald City.\"    \"And only one man!\" exclaimed the Patchwork Girl.    \"Only one, and plenty enough. In my official positions I've had nothing  to do for a good many years--so long that I began to fear I was  absolutely useless--until to-day. An hour ago I was called to the  presence of her Highness, Ozma of Oz, and told to arrest a boy named  Ojo the Unlucky, who was journeying from the Munchkin Country to the  Emerald City and would arrive in a short time. This command so  astonished me that I nearly fainted, for it is the first time anyone  has merited arrest since I can remember. You are rightly named Ojo the  Unlucky, my poor boy, since you have broken a Law of Oz.    \"But you are wrong,\" said Scraps. \"Ozma is wrong--you are all  wrong--for Ojo has broken no Law.\"    \"Then he will soon be free again,\" replied the Soldier with the Green  Whiskers. \"Anyone accused of crime is given a fair trial by our Ruler  and has every chance to prove his innocence. But just now Ozma's orders  must be obeyed.\"    With this he took from his pocket a pair of handcuffs made of gold and  set with rubies and diamonds, and these he snapped over Ojo's wrists.          Chapter Fifteen    Ozma's Prisoner      The boy was so bewildered by this calamity that he made no resistance  at all. He knew very well he was guilty, but it surprised him that Ozma  also knew it. He wondered how she had found out so soon that he had  picked the six-leaved clover. He handed his basket to Scraps and said:    \"Keep that, until I get out of prison. If I never get out, take it to  the Crooked Magician, to whom it belongs.\"    The Shaggy Man had been gazing earnestly in the boy's face, uncertain  whether to defend him or not; but something he read in Ojo's expression  made him draw back and refuse to interfere to save him. The Shaggy Man  was greatly surprised and grieved, but he knew that Ozma never made  mistakes and so Ojo must really have broken the Law of Oz.    The Soldier with the Green Whiskers now led them all through the gate  and into a little room built in the wall. Here sat a jolly little man,  richly dressed in green and having around his neck a heavy gold chain  to which a number of great golden keys were attached. This was the  Guardian of the Gate and at the moment they entered his room he was  playing a tune upon a mouth-organ.    \"Listen!\" he said, holding up his hand for silence. \"I've just composed  a tune called 'The Speckled Alligator.' It's in patch-time, which is  much superior to rag-time, and I've composed it in honor of the  Patchwork Girl, who has just arrived.\"    \"How did you know I had arrived?\" asked Scraps, much interested.    \"It's my business to know who's coming, for I'm the Guardian of the  Gate. Keep quiet while I play you 'The Speckled Alligator.'\"    It wasn't a very bad tune, nor a very good one, but all listened  respectfully while he shut his eyes and swayed his head from side to  side and blew the notes from the little instrument. When it was all  over the Soldier with the Green Whiskers said:    \"Guardian, I have here a prisoner.\"    \"Good gracious! A prisoner?\" cried the little man, jumping up from his  chair. \"Which one? Not the Shaggy Man?\"    \"No; this boy.\"    \"Ah; I hope his fault is as small as himself,\" said the Guardian of the  Gate. \"But what can he have done, and what made him do it?\"    \"Can't say,\" replied the soldier. \"All I know is that he has broken the  Law.\"    \"But no one ever does that!\"    \"Then he must be innocent, and soon will be released. I hope you are  right, Guardian. Just now I am ordered to take him to prison. Get me a  prisoner's robe from your Official Wardrobe.\"    The Guardian unlocked a closet and took from it a white robe, which the  soldier threw over Ojo. It covered him from head to foot, but had two  holes just in front of his eyes, so he could see where to go. In this  attire the boy presented a very quaint appearance.    As the Guardian unlocked a gate leading from his room into the streets  of the Emerald City, the Shaggy Man said to Scraps:    \"I think I shall take you directly to Dorothy, as the Scarecrow  advised, and the Glass Cat and the Woozy may come with us. Ojo must go  to prison with the Soldier with the Green Whiskers, but he will be well  treated and you need not worry about him.\"    \"What will they do with him?\" asked Scraps.    \"That I cannot tell. Since I came to the Land of Oz no one has ever  been arrested or imprisoned--until Ojo broke the Law.\"    \"Seems to me that girl Ruler of yours is making a big fuss over  nothing,\" remarked Scraps, tossing her yarn hair out of her eyes with a  jerk of her patched head. \"I don't know what Ojo has done, but it  couldn't be anything very bad, for you and I were with him all the  time.\"    The Shaggy Man made no reply to this speech and presently the Patchwork  Girl forgot all about Ojo in her admiration of the wonderful city she  had entered.    They soon separated from the Munchkin boy, who was led by the Soldier  with the Green Whiskers down a side street toward the prison. Ojo felt  very miserable and greatly ashamed of himself, but he was beginning to  grow angry because he was treated in such a disgraceful manner. Instead  of entering the splendid Emerald City as a respectable traveler who was  entitled to a welcome and to hospitality, he was being brought in as a  criminal, handcuffed and in a robe that told all he met of his deep  disgrace.    Ojo was by nature gentle and affectionate and if he had disobeyed the  Law of Oz it was to restore his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/956"],[0,"Tik-Tok of Oz (#18)"],[1,"hungry. If you'll give me  something to eat, I'll talk this killing business over with you  afterward; only, I warn you now that I don't approve of it, and never  will.\"    Her coolness and lack of fear impressed the Nome King, although he bore  an intense hatred toward all mortals.    \"What do you wish to eat?\" he asked gruffly.    \"Oh, a ham-sandwich would do, or perhaps a couple of hard-boiled eggs--\"    \"Eggs!\" shrieked the three nomes who were present, shuddering till  their teeth chattered.    \"What's the matter?\" asked Betsy wonderingly. \"Are eggs as high here as  they are at home?\"    \"Guph,\" said the King in an agitated voice, turning to his General,  \"let us destroy this rash mortal at once! Seize her and take her to the  Slimy Cave and lock her in.\"    Guph glanced at Tik-Tok, whose gun was still pointed, but just then  Kaliko stole softly behind the copper man and kicked his knee-joints so  that they suddenly bent forward and tumbled Tik-Tok to the floor, his  gun falling from his grasp.    Then Guph, seeing Tik-Tok helpless, made a grab at Betsy. At the same  time Hank's heels shot out and caught the General just where his belt  was buckled. He rose into the air swift as a cannon-ball, struck the  Nome King fairly and flattened his Majesty against the wall of rock on  the opposite side of the cavern. Together they fell to the floor in a  dazed and crumpled condition, seeing which Kaliko whispered to Betsy:    \"Come with me--quick!--and I will save you.\"    She looked into Kaliko's face inquiringly and thought he seemed honest  and good-natured, so she decided to follow him. He led her and the mule  through several passages and into a small cavern very nicely and  comfortably furnished.    \"This is my own room,\" said he, \"but you are quite welcome to use it.  Wait here a minute and I'll get you something to eat.\"    When Kaliko returned he brought a tray containing some broiled  mushrooms, a loaf of mineral bread and some petroleum-butter. The  butter Betsy could not eat, but the bread was good and the mushrooms  delicious.    \"Here's the door key,\" said Kaliko, \"and you'd better lock yourself in.\"    \"Won't you let Polychrome and the Rose Princess come here, too?\" she  asked.    \"I'll see. Where are they?\"    \"I don't know. I left them outside,\" said Betsy.    \"Well, if you hear three raps on the door, open it,\" said Kaliko; \"but  don't let anyone in unless they give the three raps.\"    \"All right,\" promised Betsy, and when Kaliko left the cosy cavern she  closed and locked the door.    In the meantime Ann and her officers, finding themselves prisoners in  the pit, had shouted and screamed until they were tired out, but no one  had come to their assistance. It was very dark and damp in the pit and  they could not climb out because the walls were higher than their heads  and the cover was on. The Queen was first angry and then annoyed and  then discouraged; but the officers were only afraid. Every one of the  poor fellows heartily wished he was back in Oogaboo caring for his  orchard, and some were so unhappy that they began to reproach Ann for  causing them all this trouble and danger.    Finally the Queen sat down on the bottom of the pit and leaned her back  against the wall. By good luck her sharp elbow touched a secret spring  in the wall and a big flat rock swung inward. Ann fell over backward,  but the next instant she jumped up and cried to the others:    \"A passage! A passage! Follow me, my brave men, and we may yet escape.\"    Then she began to crawl through the passage, which was as dark and dank  as the pit, and the officers followed her in single file. They crawled,  and they crawled, and they kept on crawling, for the passage was not  big enough to allow them to stand upright. It turned this way and  twisted that, sometimes like a corkscrew and sometimes zigzag, but  seldom ran for long in a straight line.    \"It will never end--never!\" moaned the officers, who were rubbing all  the skin off their knees on the rough rocks.    \"It _must_ end,\" retorted Ann courageously, \"or it never would have  been made. We don't know where it will lead us to, but any place is  better than that loathsome pit.\"    So she crawled on, and the officers crawled on, and while they were  crawling through this awful underground passage Polychrome and Shaggy  and Files and the Rose Princess, who were standing outside the entrance  to Ruggedo's domains, were wondering what had become of them.          Chapter Seventeen    A Tragic Transformation      \"Don't let us worry,\" said Shaggy to his companions, \"for it may take  the Queen some time to conquer the Metal Monarch, as Tik-Tok has to do  everything in his slow, mechanical way.\"    \"Do you suppose they are likely to fail?\" asked the Rose Princess.    \"I do, indeed,\" replied Shaggy. \"This Nome King is really a powerful  fellow and has a legion of nomes to assist him, whereas our bold Queen  commands a Clockwork Man and a band of faint-hearted officers.\"    \"She ought to have let Quox do the conquering,\" said Polychrome,  dancing lightly upon a point of rock and fluttering her beautiful  draperies. \"But perhaps the dragon was wise to let her go first, for  when she fails to conquer Ruggedo she may become more modest in her  ambitions.\"    \"Where is the dragon now?\" inquired Ozga.    \"Up there on the rocks,\" replied Files. \"Look, my dear; you may see him  from here. He said he would take a little nap while we were mixing up  with Ruggedo, and he added that after we had gotten into trouble he  would wake up and conquer the Nome King in a jiffy, as his master the  Jinjin has ordered him to do.\"    \"Quox means well,\" said Shaggy, \"but I do not think we shall need his  services; for just as soon as I am satisfied that Queen Ann and her  army have failed to conquer Ruggedo, I shall enter the caverns and show  the King my Love Magnet. That he cannot resist; therefore the conquest  will be made with ease.\"    This speech of Shaggy Man's was overheard by the Long-Eared Hearer, who  was at that moment standing by Ruggedo's side. For when the King and  Guph had recovered from Hank's kick and had picked themselves up, their  first act was to turn Tik-Tok on his back and put a heavy diamond on  top of him, so that he could not get up again. Then they carefully put  his gun in a corner of the cavern and the King sent Guph to fetch the  Long-Eared Hearer.    The Hearer was still angry at Ruggedo for breaking his ear, but he  acknowledged the Nome King to be his master and was ready to obey his  commands. Therefore he repeated Shaggy's speech to the King, who at  once realized that his Kingdom was in grave danger. For Ruggedo knew of  the Love Magnet and its powers and was horrified at the thought that  Shaggy might show him the magic talisman and turn all the hatred in his  heart into love. Ruggedo was proud of his hatred and abhorred love of  any sort.      \"Really,\" said he, \"I'd rather be conquered and lose my wealth and my  Kingdom than gaze at that awful Love Magnet. What can I do to prevent  the Shaggy Man from taking it out of his pocket?\"    Kaliko returned to the cavern in time to overhear this question, and  being a loyal nome and eager to serve his King, he answered by saying:    \"If we can manage to bind the Shaggy Man's arms, tight to his body, he  could not get the Love Magnet out of his pocket.\"    \"True!\" cried the King in delight at this easy solution of the problem.  \"Get at once a dozen nomes, with ropes, and place them in the passage  where they can seize and bind Shaggy as soon as he enters.\"    This Kaliko did, and meanwhile the watchers outside the entrance were  growing more and more uneasy about their friends.    \"I don't worry so much about the Oogaboo people,\" said Polychrome, who  had grown sober with waiting, and perhaps a little nervous, \"for they  could not be killed, even though Ruggedo might cause them much  suffering and perhaps destroy them utterly. But we should not have  allowed Betsy and Hank to go alone into the caverns. The little girl is  mortal and possesses no magic powers whatever, so if Ruggedo captures  her she will be wholly at his mercy.\"    \"That is indeed true,\" replied Shaggy. \"I wouldn't like to have  anything happen to dear little Betsy, so I believe I'll go in right  away and put an end to all this worry.\"    \"We may as well go with you,\" asserted Files, \"for by means of the Love  Magnet, you can soon bring the Nome King to reason.\"    So it was decided to wait no longer. Shaggy walked through the entrance  first, and after him came the others. They had no thought of danger to  themselves, and Shaggy, who was going along with his hands thrust into  his pockets, was much surprised when a rope shot out from the darkness  and twined around his body, pinning down his arms so securely that he  could not even withdraw his hands from the pockets. Then appeared  several grinning nomes, who speedily tied knots in the ropes and then  led the prisoner along the passage to the cavern. No attention was paid  to the others, but Files and the Princess followed on after Shaggy,  determined not to desert their friend and hoping that an opportunity  might arise to rescue him.    As for Polychrome, as soon as she saw that trouble had overtaken Shaggy  she turned and ran lightly back through the passage and out of the  entrance. Then she easily leaped from rock to rock until she paused  beside the great dragon, who lay fast asleep.    \"Wake up, Quox!\" she cried. \"It is time for you to act.\"    But Quox did not wake up. He lay as one in a trance, absolutely  motionless, with his enormous eyes tight closed. The eyelids had big  silver scales on them, like all the rest of his body.    Polychrome might have thought Quox was dead had she not known that  dragons do not die easily or had she not observed his huge body  swelling as he breathed. She picked up a piece of rock and pounded  against his eyelids with it, saying:    \"Wake up, Quox--wake"]]]
