There were an eighth, tenth, and eleventh  editions, and two others, described as \"New Editions,\" between this  date and 1806. The compiler dedicates her book to \"The honourable Lady  Elizabeth Warburton,\" in whose service she had been. She mentions that  the volume was published by subscription, and that she had obtained  eight hundred names. In the preface Mrs. Raffald begins by observing:  \"When I reflect upon the number of books already in print upon this  subject, and _with what contempt they are read_, I cannot but be  apprehensive that this may meet the same fate with some who will  censure before they either see it or try its value.\" She concludes by  saying that she had not meddled with physical receipts, \"leaving them  to the physician's superior judgment, whose proper province they are.\"  The author of the \"Experienced Housekeeper\" tells us that she had not  only filled that post in noble families during fifteen years, but  had travelled with her employers, and so widened her sphere of  observation.    18.

The staple food among the lower orders in Anglo-Saxon and the  immediately succeeding times was doubtless bread, butter, and  cheese, the aliment which goes so far even yet to support our rural  population, with vegetables and fruit, and occasional allowances of  salted bacon and pancakes, beef, or fish. The meat was usually boiled  in a kettle suspended on a tripod [Footnote: The tripod is still  employed in many parts of the country for a similar purpose] over a  wood-fire, such as is used only now, in an improved shape, for fish  and soup.      The kettle which is mentioned, as we observe, in the tale of \"Tom  Thumb,\" was the universal vessel for boiling purposes [Footnote: An  inverted kettle was the earliest type of the diving-bell], and the  bacon-house (or larder), so called from the preponderance of that  sort of store over the rest, was the warehouse for the winter stock of  provisions [Footnote: What is called in some places the keeping-room  also accommodated flitches on the walls, and hams ranged along the  beams overhead; and it served at the same time for a best parlour].  The fondness for condiments, especially garlic and pepper, among the  higher orders, possibly served to render the coarser nourishment of  the poor more savoury and flavorous. \"It is interesting to remark,\"  says Mr. Wright [Footnote: \"Domestic Manners and Sentiments,\" 1862,  p. 91], \"that the articles just mentioned (bread, butter, and cheese)  have preserved their Anglo-Saxon names to the present time, while all  kinds of meat--beef, veal, mutton, pork, even bacon--have retained  only the names given to them by the Normans; which seems to imply that  flesh-meat was not in general use for food among the lower classes of  society.\"    In Malory's compilation on the adventures of King Arthur and his  knights, contemporary with the \"Book of St. Alban's,\" we are expressly  informed in the sixth chapter, how the King made a great feast at  Caerleon in Wales; but we are left in ignorance of its character. The  chief importance of details in this case would have been the excessive  probability that Malory would have described an entertainment  consonant with the usage of his own day, although at no period of  early history was there ever so large an assemblage of guests at one  time as met, according to the fable, to do honour to Arthur.    In the tenth century Colloquy of Archbishop Alfric, the boy is made to  say that he is too young to eat meat, but subsists on cabbages,  eggs, fish, cheese, butter, beans, and other things, according to  circumstances; so that a vegetable diet was perhaps commoner in those  days even among the middle classes than at present. This youth, when  he is asked what he drinks, replies, water, or ale if he can get it.  The dish so deftly constructed by King Arthur, according to one of  his numerous biographers, exhibited that wedlock of fruit with animal  matter--fat and plums--which we post-Arthurians eye with a certain  fastidious repugnance, but which, notwithstanding, lingered on to  the Elizabethan or Jacobaean era--nay, did not make the gorge of our  grandsires turn rebellious. It survives among ourselves only in the  modified shape of such accessories as currant jelly and apple sauce.    But the nursery rhyme about Arthur and the bag-pudding of barley  meal with raisins and meat has a documentary worth for us beyond the  shadowy recital of the banquet "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12296"],[0,"Camps and Trails in China (#19)"],[1,"in the medicine shops. The scales of the  pangolin are considered to be of great value in the treatment of certain  diseases and the skins are usually sold by the pound as are the horns of  deer, wapiti, gorals, and serows.    Almost all of the fossil animals which have been obtained in China by  foreigners have been purchased in apothecary shops. If a Chinaman discovers  a fossil bed he guards it zealously for it represents an actual gold mine  to him. The bones are ground into a fine powder, mixed with an acid, and a  phosphate obtained which in reality has a certain value as a tonic. When a  considerable amount of faith and Chinese superstition is added its efficacy  assumes double proportions.    Every year a few tiger skins find their way to Hsia-kuan from the southern  part of the province along the Tonking border, but the good ones are  quickly sold at prices varying from twenty-five to fifty dollars (Mexican).  Ten dollars is the usual price for leopard skins.    Marco Polo visited Ta-li Fu in the thirteenth century and, among other  things, he speaks of the fine horses from this part of the province. We  were surprised to find that the animals are considerably larger and more  heavily built than those of Yün-nan Fu and appear to be better in every  way. A good riding horse can be purchased for seventy-five dollars  (Mexican) but mules are worth about one hundred and fifty dollars because  they are considered better pack animals.    On the advice of men who had traveled much in the interior of Yün-nan we  hired our caravan and riding animals instead of buying them outright, and  subsequent experience showed the wisdom of this course. Saddle ponies,  which are used only for short trips about the city, cannot endure continual  traveling over the execrable roads of the interior where often it is  impossible to feed them properly. If an entire caravan were purchased the  leader of the expedition would have unceasing trouble with the _mafus_ to  insure even ordinary care of the animals, an opportunity would be given for  endless \"squeeze\" in the purchase of food, and there are other reasons too  numerous to mention why in this province the plan is impracticable.    However, the caravan ponies do try one's patience to the limit. They are  trained only to follow a leader, and if one happens to be behind another  horse it is well-nigh impossible to persuade it to pass. Beat or kick the  beast as one will, it only backs up or crowds closely to the horse in  front. On the first day out Heller, who was on a particularly bad animal,  when trying to pass one of us began to cavort about like a circus rider,  prancing from side to side and backward but never going forward. We shouted  that we would wait for him to go on but he replied helplessly, \"I can't,  this horse isn't under my management,\" and we found very soon that our  animals were not under our management either!    In a town near Ta-li Fu we were in front of the caravan with Wu and Heller:  Wu stopped to buy a basket of mushrooms but his horse refused to move  ahead. Beat as he would, the animal only backed in a circle, ours followed,  and in a few moments we were packed together so tightly that it was  impossible even to dismount. There we sat, helpless, to the huge delight of  the villagers until rescued by a _mafu_. As soon as he led Wu's horse  forward the others proceeded as quietly as lambs.    We paid forty cents (Mexican) a day for each animal while traveling, and  fifteen or twenty cents when in camp, but the rate varies somewhat in  different parts of the province, and in the west and south, along the Burma  border fifty cents is the usual price. When a caravan is engaged the  necessary _mafus_ are included and they buy food for themselves and beans  and hay for the animals.    Ever since leaving Yün-nan Fu the cook we engaged at Paik-hoi had been a  source of combined irritation and amusement. He was a lanky, effeminate  gentleman who never before had ridden a horse, and who was physically and  mentally unable to adapt himself to camp life. After five months in the  field he appeared to be as helpless when the caravan camped for the night  as when we first started, and he would stand vacantly staring until someone  directed him what to do. But he was a good cook, when he wished to exert  himself, and had the great asset of knowing a considerable amount of  English. While we were in Ta-li Fu Mr. Evans overheard him relating his  experiences on the road to several of the other servants. \"Of course,\" said  the cook, \"it is a fine way to see the country, but the riding! My  goodness, that's awful! After the third day I didn't know whether to go on  or turn back--I was so sore I couldn't sit down even on a chair to say  nothing of a horse!\"    He had evidently fully made up his mind not to \"see the country\" that way  for the day after we left Ta-li Fu _en route_ to the Tibetan frontier he  became violently ill. Although we could find nothing the matter with him he  made such a good case for himself that we believed he really was quite sick  and treated him accordingly. The following morning, however, he sullenly  refused to proceed, and we realized that his illness was of the mind rather  than the body. As he had accepted two months' salary in advance and had  already sent it to his wife in Paik-hoi, we were in a position to use a  certain amount of forceful persuasion which entirely accomplished its  object and illness did not trouble him thereafter.    The loss of a cook is a serious matter to a large expedition. Good meals  and varied food must be provided if the personnel is to work at its highest  efficiency and cooking requires a vast amount of thought and time. In  Yün-nan natives who can cook foreign food are by no means easy to find and  when our Paik-hoi gentleman finally left us upon our return to Ta-li Fu we  were fortunate in obtaining an exceedingly competent man to take his place  through the good offices of Mr. Hanna.          CHAPTER XII      LI-CHIANG AND \"THE TEMPLE OF THE FLOWERS\"    We left a part of our outfit with Mr. Evans at Ta-li Fu and with a new  caravan of twenty-five animals traveled northward for six days to Li-chiang  Fu. By taking a small road we hoped to find good collecting in the pine  forests three days from Ta-li, but instead there was a total absence of  animal life. The woods were beautiful, parklike stretches which in a  country like California would be full of game, but here were silent and  deserted. During the fourth and fifth days we were still in the forests,  but on the sixth we crossed a pass 10,000 feet high and descended abruptly  into a long marshy plain where at the far end were the gray outlines of  Li-chiang dimly visible against the mountains.    Wu and I galloped ahead to find a temple for our camp, leaving Heller and  my wife to follow. A few pages from her journal tell of their entry into  the city.        We rode along a winding stone causeway and halted on the outskirts of      the town to wait until the caravan arrived. Neither Roy nor Wu was in      sight but we expected that the _mafus_ would ask where they had gone      and follow, for of course we could not speak a word of the language.      Already there was quite a sensation as we came down the street, for our      sudden appearance seemed to have stupefied the people with amazement.      One old lady looked at me with an indescribable expression and uttered      what sounded exactly like a long-drawn \"Mon Dieu\" of disagreeable      surprise.        I tried smiling at them but they appeared too astonished to appreciate      our friendliness and in return merely stared with open mouths and eyes.      We halted and immediately the street was blocked by crowds of men,      women, and children who poured out of the houses, shops, and      cross-streets to gaze in rapt attention. When the caravan arrived we      moved on again expecting that the _mafus_ had learned where Roy had      gone, but they seemed to be wandering aimlessly through the narrow      winding streets. Even though we did not find a camping place we      afforded the natives intense delight.        I felt as though I were the chief actor in a circus parade at home, but      the most remarkable attraction there could not have equaled our      unparalleled success in Li-chiang. On the second excursion through the      town we passed down a cross-street, and suddenly from a courtyard at      the right we heard feminine voices speaking English.        \"It's a girl. No, it's a boy. No, no, can't you see her hair, it's a      girl!\" Just then we caught sight of three ladies, unmistakably      foreigners although dressed in Chinese costume. They were Mrs. A. Kok,      wife of the resident Pentecostal Missionary, and two assistants, who      rushed into the street as soon as they had determined my sex and      literally \"fell upon my neck.\" They had not seen a white woman since      their arrival there four years ago and it seemed to them that I had      suddenly dropped from the sky.        While we were talking Wu appeared to guide us to the camp. They had      chosen a beautiful temple with a flower-filled courtyard on the summit      of a hill overlooking the city. It was wonderfully clean and when our      beds, tables, and chairs were spread on the broad stone porch it seemed      like a real home.        The next days were busy ones for us all, Roy and Heller setting traps,      and I working at my photography. We let it be known that we would pay      well for specimens, and there was an almost uninterrupted procession of      men and boys carrying long sticks, on which were strung frogs, rats,      toads, and snakes. They would simply beam with triumph and enthusiasm.      Our fame spread and more came, bringing the most ridiculous tame      things--pigeons, maltese cats, dogs, white rabbits, caged birds, and I      even believe we might have purchased a girl"]]]
