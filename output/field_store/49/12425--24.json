[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12436"],[0,"The Night Horseman (#19)"],[1,"slopes were bright, and  here and there at the distance the light turned and waned on upper  windows. Sleep was coming over the world, and eternal sleep had come for  Jerry Strann.    It did not seem possible.    Some night at sea, when clouds hurtled before the wind across the sky  and when the waves leaped up mast-high; when some good ship staggered  with the storm, when hundreds were shrieking and yelling in fear or  defiance of death; there would have been a death-scene for Jerry Strann.    Or in the battle, when hundreds rush to the attack with one man in front  like the edge before the knife--there would have been a death-scene for  Jerry Strann. Or while he rode singing, a bolt of lightning that slew  and obliterated at once--such would have been a death for Jerry Strann.    It was not possible that he could die like this, with a smile. There was  something incompleted. The fury of the death-struggle which had been  omitted must take place, and the full rage of wrath and destruction must  be vented. Can a bomb explode and make no sound and do no injury?    Yet Jerry Strann was dead and all the world lived on. Someone cantered  his horse down the street and called gayly to an acquaintance, and  afterwards the dust rose, invisible, and blew through the open window  and stung the nostrils of Mac Strann. A child cried, faintly, in the  distance, and then was hushed by the voice of the mother, making a  sound like a cackling hen. This was all!    There should have been wailing and weeping and cursing and praying, for  handsome Jerry Strann was dead. Or there might have been utter and  dreadful silence and waiting for the stroke of vengeance, for the  brightest eye was misted and the strongest hand was unnerved and the  voice that had made them tremble was gone.    But there was neither silence nor weeping. Someone in a nearby kitchen  rattled her pans and then cursed a dog away from her back-door. Not that  any of the sounds were loud. The sounds of living are rarely loud, but  they run in an endless river--a monotone broken by ugly ripples of noise  to testify that men still sleep or waken, hunger or feed. Another ripple  had gone down to the sea of darkness, yet all the ripples behind it  chased on their way heedlessly and babbled neither louder nor softer.    There should have been some giant voice to peal over the sleeping  village and warn them of the coming vengeance--for Jerry Strann was  dead!    The tall, gaunt figure of Haw-Haw Langley came on tiptoe from behind,  beheld the dead face, and grinned; a nervous convulsion sent a long  ripple through his body, and his Adam's-apple rose and fell. Next he  stole sideways, inch by inch, so gradual was his cautious progress,  until he could catch a glimpse of Mac Strann's face. It was like the  open face of a child; there was in it no expression except wonder.    At length a hoarse voice issued from between the grinning lips of  Haw-Haw.    \"Ain't you goin' to close the eyes, Mac?\"    At this the great head of Mac Strann rolled back and he raised his  glance to Haw-Haw, who banished the grin from his mouth by a vicious  effort.    \"Ain't he got to see his way?\" asked Mac Strann, and lowered his glance  once more to the dead man. As for Haw-Haw Langley, he made a long,  gliding step back towards the door, and his beady eyes opened in terror;  yet a deadly fascination drew him back again beside the bed.    Mac Strann said: \"Kind of looks like Jerry was ridin' the home trail,  Haw-Haw. See the way he's smilin'?\"    The vulture stroked his lean cheeks and seemed once more to swallow his  silent mirth.    \"And his hands,\" said Mac Strann, \"is just like life, except that they's  gettin' sort of chilly. He don't look changed, none, does he, Haw-Haw?  Except that he's seein' something off there--away off there. Looks like  he was all wrapped up in it, eh?\" He leaned closer, his voice fell to a  murmur that was almost soft. \"Jerry, what you seein'?\"    Haw-Haw Langley gasped in inaudible terror and retreated again towards  the door.    Mac Strann laid his giant hand on the shoulder of Jerry. He asked in a  raised voice: \"Don't you hear me, lad?\" Sudden terror caught hold of  him. He plunged to his knees beside the bed, and the floor quaked and  groaned under the shock. \"Jerry, what's the matter? Are you mad at me?  Ain't you going to speak to me? Are you forgettin' me, Jerry?\"    He caught the dead face between his hands and turned it strongly towards  his own. Then for a moment his eyes plumbed the shadows into which they  looked. He stumbled back to his feet and said apologetically to Haw-Haw  at the door: \"I kind of forgot he wasn't livin', for a minute.\" He  stared fixedly at the gaunt cowpuncher. \"Speakin' man to man, Haw-Haw,  d'you think Jerry will forget me?\"    The terror was still white upon the face of Haw-Haw, but something  stronger than fear kept him in the room and even drew him a slow step  towards Mac Strann; and his eyes moved from the face of the dead man to  the face of the living and seemed to draw sustenance from both. He  moistened his lips and was able to speak.    \"Forget you, Mac? Not if you get the man that fixed him.\"    \"Would you want me to get him, Jerry?\" asked Mac Strann. And he waited  for an answer.    \"I dunno,\" he muttered, after a moment. \"Jerry was always for fightin',  but he wasn't never for killin'. He never liked the way I done things.  And when he was lyin' here, Haw-Haw, he never said nothin' about me  gettin' Barry. Did he?\"    Astonishment froze the lips of Haw-Haw. He managed to stammer: \"Ain't  you going to get Barry? Ain't you goin' to bust him up, Mac?\"    \"I dunno,\" repeated the big man heavily. \"Seems like I've got no heart  for killing. Seems like they's enough death in the world.\" He pressed  his hand against his forehead and closed his eyes. \"Seems like they's  something dead in me. They's an ache that goes ringin' in my head.  They's a sort of hollow feelin' inside me. And I keep thinkin' about  times when I was a kid and got hurt and cried.\" He drew a deep breath.  \"Oh, my God, Haw-Haw, I'd give most anything if I could bust out cryin'  now!\"    While Mac Strann stood with his eyes closed, speaking his words slowly,  syllable by syllable, like the tolling of a bell, Haw-Haw Langley stood  with parted lips--like the spirit of famine drinking deep; joy  unutterable was glittering in his eyes.    \"If Jerry'd wanted me to get this Barry, he'd of said so,\" repeated Mac  Strann. \"But he didn't.\" He turned towards the dead face. \"Look at Jerry  now. He ain't thinkin' about killin's. Nope, he's thinkin' about some  quiet place for sleep. I know the place. They's a spring that come out  in a holler between two mountains; and the wind blows up the valley all  the year; and they's a tree that stands over the spring. That's where  I'll put him. He loved the sound of runnin' water; and the wind'll be on  his face; and the tree'll sort of mark the place. Jerry, lad, would ye  like that?\"    Now, while Mac Strann talked, inspiration came to Haw-Haw Langley, and  he stretched out his gaunt arms to it and gathered it in to his heart.    \"Mac,\" he said, \"don't you see no reason why Jerry wouldn't ask you to  go after Barry?\"    \"Eh?\" queried Mac Strann, turning.    But as he turned, Haw-Haw Langley glided towards him, and behind him, as  if he found it easier to talk when the face of Mac was turned away. And  while he talked his hands reached out towards Mac Strann like one who is  begging for alms.    \"Mac, don't you remember that Barry beat Jerry to the draw?\"    \"What's that to do with it?\"    \"But he beat him bad to the draw. I seen it. Barry _waited_ for Jerry.  Understand?\"    \"What of that?\"    \"Mac, you're blind! Jerry knowed you'd be throwing yourself away if you  went up agin Barry.\"    At this Mac Strann whirled with a suddenness surprising for one of his  bulk. Haw-Haw Langley flattened his gaunt frame against the wall.    \"Mac!\" he pleaded, \"_I_ didn't say you'd be throwin' yourself away. It  was Jerry's idea.\"    \"Did Jerry tell you that?\" he asked.    \"So help me God!\"    \"Did Jerry _want_ me to get Barry?\"    \"Why wouldn't he?\" persisted the vulture, twisting his bony hands  together in an agony of alarm and suspense. \"Ain't it nacheral, Mac?\"    Mac Strann wavered where he stood.    \"Somehow,\" he argued to himself, \"it don't seem like killin' is right,  here.\"    The long hand of Langley touched his shoulder.    He whispered rapidly: \"You remember last night when you was out of the  room for a minute? Jerry turned his head to me--jest the way he's lyin'  now--and I says: 'Jerry, is there anything I can do for you?'\"    Mac Strann reached up and his big fingers closed over those of Haw-Haw.    \"Haw-Haw,\" he muttered, \"you was his frien'. I know that.\"    Haw-Haw gathered assurance.    He said: \"Jerry answers to me: 'Haw-Haw, old pal, there ain't nothin'  you can do for me. I'm goin' West. But after I'm gone, keep Mac away  from Barry.'    \"I says: 'Why, Jerry?\"    \"'Because Barry'll kill him, sure,' says Jerry.    \"'I'll do what I can to keep him away from Barry,' says I, 'but don't  you want nothin' done to the man what killed you?'    \"'Oh, Haw-Haw,' says Jerry, 'I ain't goin' to rest easy, I ain't goin'  to sleep in heaven--until I know Barry's been sent to hell. But for  God's sake don't let Mac know what I want, or he'd be sure to go after  Barry and get what I got.'\"    Mac Strann crushed the hand of Haw-Haw in a terrible grip.    \"Partner,\" he said, \"d'you swear this is straight?\"    \"So help me God!\" repeated the perjurer.    \"Then,\" said Mac Strann, \"I got to leave the buryin' to other men what  I'll hire. Me--I've got business on hand. Where did Barry run to?\"    \"He ain't run,\" cried Haw-Haw, choking with a strange emotion. \"The  fool--the damned fool!--is waiting right down here in O'Brien's bar for  you to come. He's _darin'_ you to come!\"    Mac Strann made no answer. He cast a single glance "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12473"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 06 (#19)"],[1," grief, and my soul is sad!\" Meanwhile, the other had also  stretched out _his_ arms toward the wardrobe, while tears fell from his  eyes as he cried to a pair of yellow leather pantaloons which he mistook  for the moon, \"Fair art thou, daughter of heaven! Lovely and blessed is  the calm of thy countenance. Thou walkest in loveliness! The stars  follow thy blue path in the east! At thy glance the clouds rejoice, and  their dark forms gleam with light. Who is like unto thee in heaven, thou  the night-born? The stars are ashamed before thee, and turn away their  sparkling eyes. Whither, ah, whither, when morning pales thy face, dost  thou flee from thy path? Hast thou, like me, thy Halle? Dwellest thou  amid shadows of sorrow? Have thy sisters fallen from heaven? Are they  who joyfully rolled with thee through the night now no more? Yea, they  have fallen down, oh! lovely light, and thou hidest thyself often to  bewail them! Yet the night must come at last when thou too will have  passed away, and left thy blue path above in heaven. Then the stars,  that were once ashamed in thy presence, will raise their green heads and  rejoice. But now art clothed in thy beaming splendor and gazest down  from the gate of heaven. Tear aside the clouds, oh! ye winds, that the  night-born may shine forth and the bushy hills gleam, and that the  foaming waves of the sea may roll in light!\"           *       *       *       *       *    I can bear a tolerable quantity--modesty forbids me to say how many  bottles--and I consequently retired to my chamber in tolerably good  condition. The young merchant already lay in bed, enveloped in his  chalk-white night-cap and saffron yellow night-shirt of sanitary  flannel. He was not asleep, and sought to enter into conversation with  me. He was from Frankfurt-on-the-Main, and consequently spoke at once of  the Jews, declared that they had lost all feeling for the beautiful and  noble, and that they sold English goods twenty-five per cent. under  manufacturers' prices. A fancy to humbug him came over me, and I told  him that I was a somnambulist, and must beforehand beg his pardon should  I unwittingly disturb his slumbers. This intelligence, as he confessed  the following day, prevented him from sleeping a wink through the whole  night, especially since the idea had entered his head that I, while in a  somnambulistic state, might shoot him with the pistol which lay near my  bed. But in truth I fared no better myself, for I slept very little.  Dreary and terrifying fancies swept through my brain....    From this confusion I was rescued by the landlord of the Brocken, when  he awoke me to see the sun rise. On the tower I found several people  already waiting, and rubbing their freezing hands; others, with sleep  still in their eyes, stumbled up to us, until finally the whole silent  congregation of the previous evening was reassembled, and we saw how,  above the horizon, there rose a little carmine-red ball, spreading a  dim, wintry light. Far around, amid the mists, rose the mountains, as if  swimming in a white rolling sea, only their summits being visible, so  that we could imagine ourselves standing on a little hill in the midst  of an inundated plain, in which here and there rose dry clods of earth.  To retain what I saw and felt, I sketched the following poem:      In the east 'tis ever brighter,      Though the sun gleams fitfully;    Far and wide the mountain summits      Swim above the misty sea.      Had I seven-league boots for travel,      Like the fleeting winds I'd rove    Over valley, rock, and river,      To the home of her I love.      From the bed where now she's sleeping      Soft the curtain I would slip;    Softly kiss her childlike forehead,      Kiss the ruby of her lip.      Yet more softly would I whisper      In the little lily ear,    \"Think in dreams we still are loving,      Think I never lost thee, dear.\"    Meanwhile my longing for breakfast was also great, and, after paying a  few compliments to my ladies, I hastened down to drink coffee in the  warm public room. It was full time, for all within me was as sober and  as sombre as in the St. Stephen's Church at Goslar. But with the Arabian  beverage, the warm Orient thrilled through my limbs, Eastern roses  breathed forth their perfumes, sweet bulbul songs resounded, the  students were changed to camels, the Brocken housemaids, with their  Congreverocket-glances, became _houris_, the Philistine noses, minarets,  etc.    But the book which lay near me, though full of nonsense, was not the  Koran. It was the so-called \"Brocken-book,\" in which all travelers who  ascend the mountain write their names--most inscribing their thoughts,  or, in default thereof, their \"feelings.\" Many even express themselves  in verse. In this book one may observe the horrors which result when the  great Philistine host on opportune occasions, such as this on the  Brocken, becomes poetic. The palace of the Prince of Pallagonia never  contained such absurdities as are to be found in this book. Those who  shine in it with especial splendor are Messrs. the excise collectors,  with their moldy \"high inspirations;\" counter-jumpers, with their  pathetic outgushings of the soul; old German revolution dilettanti with  their Turner-Union phrases, and Berlin school-masters with their  unsuccessful efforts at enthusiasm. Mr. Snobbs will also for once show  himself as author. In one page the majestic splendor of the sunrise is  described, in another complaints occur of bad weather, of disappointed  hopes, and of the mists which obstruct the view. A \"Caroline\" writes  that in climbing the mountain her feet got wet, to which a naive  \"Nanny,\" who was impressed by this, adds, \"I too, got wet while doing  this thing.\" \"Went up wet without and came down wet within,\" is a  standing joke, repeated in the book hundreds of times. The whole volume  smells of beer, tobacco and cheese; we might fancy it one of Clauren's  novels.           *       *       *       *       *    And now the students prepared to depart. Knapsacks were buckled, the  bills, which were moderate beyond all expectation, were settled, the  susceptible housemaids, upon whose countenances the traces of successful  amours were plainly visible, brought, as is their custom, their  Brocken-bouquets, and helped some to adjust their caps; for all of which  they were duly rewarded with either kisses or coppers. Thus we all went  down the mountain, albeit one party, among whom were the Swiss and  Greifswalder, took the road toward Schierke, and the others, about  twenty men, among whom were my fellow \"countrymen\" and myself, led by a  guide, went through the so-called \"Snow Holes\" down to Ilsenburg.    Such a head-over-heels, break-neck piece of business! Halle students  travel quicker than the Austrian militia. Ere I knew where I was, the  bald summit of the mountain, with groups of stones strewed over it, was  behind us, and we went through the fir-wood which I had seen the day  before. The sun poured down a cheerful light on the merry Burschen, in  gaily colored garb, as they merrily pressed onward through the wood,  disappearing here, coming to light again there, running across marshy  places on trunks of trees, climbing over shelving steeps by grasping the  projecting tree-roots; while they thrilled all the time in the merriest  manner and received as joyous an answer from the twittering wood-birds,  the invisibly plashing rivulets, and the resounding echo. When cheerful  youth and beautiful nature meet, they mutually rejoice.    [Illustration: THE FALLS OF THE ILSE]    The lower we descend the more delightfully did subterranean waters  ripple around us; only here and there they peeped out amid rocks and  bushes, appearing to be reconnoitring if they might yet come to light,  until at last one little spring jumped forth boldly. Then followed the  usual show--the bravest one makes a beginning, and then to their own  astonishment the great multitude of hesitators, suddenly inspired with  courage, rush forth to join the first. Myriads of springs now leaped in  haste from their ambush, united with the leader, and finally formed  quite an important brook, which, with its innumerable waterfalls and  beautiful windings, ripples down the valley. This is now the Ilse--the  sweet, pleasant Ilse. She flows through the blest Ilse vale, on whose  sides the mountains gradually rise higher and higher, being clad even to  their base with beech-trees, oaks, and the usual shrubs, the firs and  other needle-covered evergreens having disappeared; for that variety of  trees grows preferably upon the \"Lower Harz,\" as the east side of the  Brocken is called in contradistinction to the west side or Upper Harz.  Being in reality much higher, it is therefore better adapted to the  growth of evergreens.    It is impossible to describe the merriment, simplicity, and charm with  which the Ilse leaps down over the fantastically shaped rocks which rise  in her path, so that the water strangely whizzes or foams in one place.  amid rifted rocks, and in another pours forth in perfect arches through  a thousand crannies, as if from a giant watering-pot, and then, lower  down, trips away again over the pebbles like a merry maiden. Yes, the  old legend is true; the Ilse is a princess, who, in the full bloom of  youth, runs laughing down the mountain side. How her white foam garment  gleams in the sunshine! How her silvered scarf flutters in the breeze!  How her diamonds flash! The high beech-trees gaze down on her like grave  fathers secretly smiling at the capricious self-will of a darling child;  the white birch-trees nod their heads like delighted aunts, who are,  however, anxious at such bold leaps; the proud oak looks on like a not  over-pleased uncle, who must pay for all the fine weather; the birds  joyfully sing their applause; the flowers on the bank whisper, \"Oh, take  us with thee, take us with thee, dear sister!\" But "]]]
