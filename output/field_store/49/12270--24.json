I can't play!\" beating her hands  together in terror.    \"You must,\" said Charlotte unsympathizingly.    \"I can't--I can't. Oh, I shall die! The hall is full, and they keep  coming in. Oh--Miss Pepper!\"    For Polly, in her soft white gown, was coming quickly into the  dressing-room.    \"Your hands are just as cold as ice,\" said Polly, gathering up Amy's  shaking little palms into her own. \"There now, we'll see if we can't  coax them into playing order,\" rubbing them between her own warm ones.    \"Oh, I can feel all those people's eyes staring through me,\" cried Amy,  huddling up against Polly.    \"You mustn't think of their eyes, child,\" laughed Polly. But there was a  little white line around her mouth. Just then a messenger came in with a  note.    \"Any answer?\" asked Polly. \"Oh, stay; I would better read it before you  go.\" And she tore it open.    \"I am so sorry that I cannot keep my engagement to play the duet with  Miss Porter, but the doctor has just been here, and he says I must not  go out. I should have written this morning that I had a sore throat, but  I thought I could manage to go. I'm so sorry--oh, Miss Pepper, I'm so  sorry!    \"JULIA ANDERSON.\"    [Illustration: \"I'LL NOT SING A NOTE!\"]    The note fell to Polly's lap, and for a minute she could not speak.  \"There is no answer,\" at last she said to the messenger.    \"Oh, Miss Pepper, what is it?\" cried Amy Loughead, brought out of her  own fright, by the dread of a new trouble.    \"Julia Anderson is sick and cannot be here,\" said Polly.    \"Oh, dear! and she was going to play with Miss Porter. What will you  do?\" cried Amy in consternation.    \"Why, I shall have to take her place,\" said Polly, forcing herself to  speak.    \"Oh, dear--dear!\" exclaimed Amy, trying not to burst into tears.  \"Everything is just as bad and horrid as it can be. Oh, dear, dear, and  I can't play; I should disgrace you!\"    \"Oh, no, no, Amy,\" said Polly, trying to smile, \"that you'll never do.\"  She threw the note on the floor now, and began to rub the cold little  hands again.    \"But--but, I'm so frightened,\" gasped Amy.    Charlotte Chatterton walked to the window.    \"I may be a stick, and an oyster, and an old sponge, and everybody wish  me out of the way, but I'm not such a villain as to bother her now by  telling her I won't sing. If they only won't applaud!\" She shut her  teeth tightly, and turned back again.    \"I wouldn't, Miss Loughead,\" she began. But her voice sounded cold and  unsympathetic, and Amy clung to Polly tighter than ever.    Ben now looked in. \"Come, Polly,\" he said. \"You really ought to be out  here, and it's almost three o'clock.\"    Amy gave a gasp. \"What shall I do?\"    \"You may stay in here, if you really wish,\" said Polly in a low voice,  Charlotte Chatterton looking on with all her eyes, \"and I will excuse  you.\"    \"And will--will you be disappointed in me?\" Amy brought out the question  shamefacedly.    \"Very much,\" said Polly.    \"And will you never try me again--and never give me music lessons?\"  asked Amy fearfully.    \"I do not seem to teach you successfully,\" said Polly very slowly, \"so  it would be no use to continue the lessons.\" And she put aside the  clinging hands. \"You may stay here, Amy; I am coming, Ben,\" looking over  at him.    \"I'll play,\" cried Amy Loughead desperately. \"I'd rather, oh, dear me,  if they were bears and gorillas looking on--and I just know I shall  die--but I'd rather, Miss Pepper, than to have you give me up.\"    Charlotte Chatterton drew a long breath.    \"What's the matter?\" asked Ben in dismay.    \"Miss Loughead was a little scared, I believe,\" said Charlotte, with a  touch of scorn in her manner.    Ben gave an uneasy exclamation. \"Everything seems to be all right now,\"  he said, in a relieved way, looking off at Polly and Amy.    \"Oh, yes; a scare don't amount to much if one has a mind to put it  down,\" said Charlotte.    \"I should think you'd be scared,\" said Ben, looking at her admiringly,  \"to stand up and sing before all those people. But I suppose you never  are; you don't seem to mind things like the rest of us.\"    Charlotte shrugged her shoulders, but said nothing.    \"We are all ready,\" said Polly cheerfully coming up with Amy. \"Oh,  Charlotte, you are such a comfort,\" she found time to whisper.    Charlotte clasped her hands tightly together so that an ominous rent  appeared in one of her pretty gloves. \"I'll sing,\" she kept saying to  herself all the way out to the platform, \"oh, I'll sing--I'll sing.\" And  later on, while looking down into the eyes of the girls waiting to  applaud, \"I'll sing--I'll sing,\" she had to declare to herself till her  name was announced.    As the last note died away, \"Who is that girl?\" went around the hall.  Charlotte Chatterton had made a sensation.    Alexia Rhys, angry at the effect of the song, still clapped steadily  together her soft-gloved hands, looking at Polly with the air of a  martyr all the while.    \"Charlotte--oh, I'm glad!\" whispered Polly radiantly, \"they want you to  sing again,\" trying to pull her forward, as the storm of applause went  on.    \"I'll not sing!\" cried Charlotte passionately. \"Never! Don't ask it,  Polly.\"    \"Why, Charlotte!\" implored Polly, astonished at the passion in the girl  usually so cold and indifferent. Still the applause continued, Polly's  set keeping at it like veterans.    Ben ran up the platform steps with shining eyes. \"Grandpapa requests  Charlotte to sing again,\" he whispered to Polly.    \"There, you hear, Charlotte.\" said Polly. \"Grandpapa wishes it.\"    \"Very well,\" said Charlotte, resuming her ordinary manner, and looking  as if it really made no difference to her whether she sang or was quiet,  she walked to her place.    Polly slipped back of the piano, and began the accompaniment, and again  Charlotte's singing carried all by storm.    Polly, looking down into Jasper's face, saw him smile over to his  father, and nod in a pleased surprise; and she was aghast to feel a  faint little wish begin to grow in her heart, that Charlotte Chatterton  had not been asked to sing.    \"Of course Jasper is surprised, as he has never heard her sing,\" said  Polly to herself, \"and her voice is so beautiful in this big hall, oh,  it's so very beautiful!\" as Charlotte came back, apparently not hearing  the expressions of delight that rang over the concert-room.    \"That Chatterton girl will be all the rage now,\" whispered Alexia  savagely to Clem who sat next to her. \"Look at Mrs. Cabot. She has her  'I'll-take-you-up-and-patronize-you air' on, and I know she's making up  her mind to give Charlotte a musicale.\"    Other people also, scattered here and there in the hall, were making up  their minds to introduce Miss Chatterton to their friends; as a girl  with such a wonderful voice, it would be quite worth one's while to  bring out.    Polly, by this time, explaining to the audience, the failure of Miss  Anderson to take her part in the duet, caught little ends of the  whispers going on beneath her, such as \"Perfectly exquisite.\" \"Most  wonderful range.\" \"Shall certainly ask her to sing.\" And again she saw  Jasper's beaming face, while Ben took no pains to conceal his delight.  And she sat down to the piano mechanically, and began in a dazed way to  help Miss Porter through with the duet that was to have been one of the  finest things on the carefully prepared programme.    [Illustration: \"FOR SHAME, POLLY, IF THE LITTLE BROWN HOUSE TEACHINGS  ARE FORGOTTEN LIKE THIS\"]    Suddenly, in the midst of a slow movement, Polly glanced down and caught  her mother's eye.    \"Polly,\" it said, just as plainly as if Mrs. Fisher had spoken, \"is this  my girl? For shame, if the Little Brown House teachings are forgotten  like this.\"    Polly straightened up, sent Mamsie down a bright smile that made Mrs.  Fisher nod, and flash back one in return, then bent all her energies to  making that duet speak its message through the concert-room. People who  had rather languished in their chairs, now gathered themselves up with  fresh interest, and clapped their hands at the brilliant passages, and  exclaimed over the ability of the music teacher who could change an  apparent failure to such a glorious success. Everybody said it was  wonderful; and when the duet was over, the house rang with the charming  noise by which the gratified friends tried to express their delight. But  Polly saw only Mamsie's eyes, filled with joy.    Meantime, Charlotte Chatterton had hurried out to the dressing-room,  tossing on her walking things with a quick hand; and held fast for a  minute as she crept out into the broad passage, by the duet now in full  progress, she went softly down the stairs.    When it was all over, everybody crowded around Polly.    \"Oh, Miss Pepper, your Recital is lovely! oh, how beautifully Miss  Chatterton sang!\" and,    \"Oh, Miss Pepper, I am delighted with your pupils' progress; and what an  exquisite voice Miss Chatterton has!\"    And then it was, \"Oh, it must have been so hard, Miss Pepper, for you to  excuse Miss Anderson at the last minute; and we can't thank you enough  for letting us hear Miss Chatterton sing.\"    \"Oh, I shall fly crazy to hear them go on,\" cried Alexia to a little  bunch of girls back of the crowd; \"will nothing stop them?\" wringing her  hands angrily together. \"It's all Chatterton, Chatterton now; and after  Polly's magnificent playing too. Oh dear me, I knew it would be so!\"    Polly turned, with a happy face, to pull Charlotte forward to hear the  kind things. \"Why, where\"--"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7499"],[0,"Through Five Republics on Horseback, Being an Account of Many Wanderings in (#18)"],[1,"South  America.] on shore had scented our presence, sleep was often broken by  angry roars coming from the beach, near which we lay at anchor; but  before dawn our noisy visitors always departed, leaving only their  footprints. Early next morning, while the green moon was still shining  (the color of this heavenly orb perplexed us, it was a pure bottle  green), each one arose to his work. This was no pleasure excursion, and  duties, many and arduous, lay before the explorers. The hunter sallied  forth with his gun, and returned laden with pheasant and mountain hen,  and over his shoulder a fine duck, which, unfortunately, however, had  already begun to smell--the heat was so intense. In his wanderings he  had come upon a huge tapir, half eaten by a tiger, and saw footprints  of that lord of the forest in all directions.    Let me here say, that to our hunter we were indebted for many a good  dish, and when not after game he lured from the depths of the lake many  a fine perch or turbot. Fishing is an art in which I am not very  skilled, but one evening I borrowed his line. After a few moments'  waiting I had a \"bite,\" and commenced to haul in my catch, which  struggled, kicked, and pulled until I shouted for help. My fish was one  of our Paraguayan sailors, who for sport had slipped down into the  water on the other side of the steamer, and, diving to my cord, had  grasped it with both hands. Not every fisher catches a man!    Lake Gaiba is a stretch of water ten miles long, with a narrow mouth  opening into the River Paraguay. The lake is surrounded by mountains,  clad in luxuriant verdure on the Bolivian side, and standing out in  bare, rugged lines on the Brazilian side. The boundary of the two  countries cuts the water into two unequal halves. The most prominent of  the mountains are now marked upon the exhaustive chart drawn out. Their  christening has been a tardy one, for who can tell what ages have  passed since they first came into being? Looking at Mount Ray, the  highest of these peaks, at sunset, the eye is startled by the strange  hues and rich tints there reflected. Frequently we asked ourselves: \"Is  that the sun's radiance, or are those rocks the fabled 'Cliffs of Opal'  men have searched for in vain?\" We often sat in a wonder of delight  gazing at the scene, until the sun sank out of sight, taking the \"opal  cliffs\" with it, and leaving us only with the dream.    On the shores of the lake the beach is covered with golden sand and  studded with innumerable little stones, clear as crystal, which  scintillate with all the colors of the rainbow. Among these pebbles I  found several arrowheads of jasper. In other parts the primeval forest  creeps down to the very margin, and the tree-roots bathe in the warm  waters. Looking across the quivering heat-haze, the eye rests upon  palms of many varieties, and giant trees covered with orchids and  parasites, the sight of which would completely intoxicate the  horticulturist. Butterflies, gorgeous in all the colors of the rainbow,  flit from flower to flower; and monkeys, with curiously human faces,  stare at the stranger from the tree-tops. White cotton trees,  tamarinds, and strangely shaped fruits grow everywhere, and round about  all are entwined festoons of trailing creepers, or the loveliest of  _scarlet_ mistletoe, in which humming-birds build their nests. Blue  macaws, parrots, and a thousand other birds fly to and fro, and the  black fire-bird darts across the sky, making lightning with every  flutter of his wings, which, underneath, are painted a bright, vivid  red. Serpents of all colors and sizes creep silently in the  undergrowth, or hang from the branches of the trees, their emerald eyes  ever on the alert; and the broad-winged eagle soars above all,  conscious of his majesty.    Here and there the coast is broken by silent streams flowing into the  lake from the unexplored regions beyond. These _riachos_ are covered  with lotus leaves and flowers, and also the Victoria Regia in all its  gorgeous beauty. Papyrusa, reeds and aquatic plants of all descriptions  grow on the banks of the streams, making a home for the white stork or  whiter _garza_. Looking into the clear warm waters you see little  golden and red fishes, and on the bed of the stream shells of pearl.    On the south side of the Gaiba, at the foot of the mountains, the beach  slopes gently down, and is covered with golden sand, in which crystals  sparkle as though set in fine gold by some cunning workman. A Workman,  yes--but not of earth, for nature is here untouched, unspoilt as yet by  man, and the traveller can look right away from it to its Creator.    During our stay in these regions the courses of several of the larger  streams were traced for some distance. On the Brazilian side there was  a river up which we steamed. Not being acquainted with the channel, we  had the misfortune to stick for two days on a tosca reef, which  extended a distance of sixty-five feet. [Footnote: The finding of tosca  at this point confirms the extent inland of the ancient Pampean  sea.--Colonel Church, in \"Proceedings of the Royal Geographical  Society,\" January, 1902.] During this time, a curious phenomenon  presented itself to our notice. In one day we clearly saw the river  flow for six hours to the north-west, and for another six hours to the  south-east. This, of course, proved to us that the river's course  depends on the wind.    On the bank, right in front of where we lay, was a gnarled old tree,  which seemed to be the home, or parliament house, of all the paroquets  in the neighborhood. Scores of them kept up an incessant chatter the  whole time. In the tree were two or three hanging nests, looking like  large sacks suspended from the boughs. Ten or twenty birds lay in the  same nest, and you might find in them, at the one time, eggs just laid,  birds recently hatched, and others ready to fly. Sitting and rearing go  on concurrently. I procured a tame pair of this lovely breed of  paroquets from the Guatos. Their prevailing color was emerald green,  while the wings and tail were made up of tints of orange, scarlet, and  blue, and around the back of the bird was a golden sheen rarely found  even in equatorial specimens. Whether the bird is known to  ornithologists or not I cannot tell. One night our camp was pitched  near an anthill, inhabited by innumerable millions of those insects.  None of us slept well, for, although our hammocks were slung, as we  thought, away from them, they troubled us much. What was my horror next  morning when the sun, instead of lighting up the rainbow tints of my  birds, showed only a black moving mass of ants! My parrots had  literally been eaten alive by them!    But I am wandering on and the ship is still aground on the reef! After  much hauling and pulling and breaking of cables, she at last was got  off into deep water. We had not proceeded far, however, when another  shock made the vessel quiver. Were we aground again? No, the steamer  had simply pushed a lazy alligator out of its way, and he resented the  insult by a diabolical scowl at us.    Continuing on our way, we entered another body of hitherto unexplored  water, a fairy spot, covered with floating islands of lotus, anchored  with aquatic cables and surrounded by palm groves. On the shallow,  pebbly shore might be seen, here and there, scarlet flamingoes. These  beautiful birds stood on one leg, knee deep, dreaming of their  enchanted home. Truly it is a perfect paradise, but it is almost as  inaccessible as the Paradise which we all seek. What long-lost  civilizations have ruled these now deserted solitudes? Penetrate into  the dark, dank forest, as I have done, and ask the question. The only  answer is the howling of the monkeys and the screaming of the  cockatoos. You may start when you distinctly hear a bell tolling, but  it is no call to worship in some stately old Inca temple with its  golden sun and silver moon as deities. It is the wonderful bell-bird,  which can make itself heard three miles away, but it is found only  where man is not. Ruins of the old Incan and older pre-Incan  civilizations are come across, covered now with dense jungle, but their  builders have disappeared. To have left behind them until this day  ruins which rank with the pyramids for extent, and Karnak for grandeur,  proves their intelligence.    The peculiar rasping noise you now hear in the undergrowth has nothing  to do with busy civilization--'tis only the rattlesnake drawing his  slimy length among the dead leaves or tangled reeds. No, all that is  past, and this is an old new world indeed, and romance must not rob you  of self possession, for the rattle means that in the encounter either  he dies--or you.    Meanwhile the work on shore progressed. Paths were cut in different  directions and the wonders of nature laid bare. The ring of the axe and  the sound of falling trees marked the commencement of civilization in  those far-off regions. Ever and anon a loud report rang out from the  woods, for it might almost be said that the men worked with the axe in  one hand and a rifle in the other. Once they started a giant tapir  taking his afternoon snooze. The beast lazily got up and made off, but  not before he had turned his piercing eyes on the intruders, as though  wondering what new animals they were. Surely this was his first sight  of the \"lords of creation,\" and probably his last, for a bullet quickly  whizzed after him. Another day the men shot a puma searching for its  prey, and numerous were the birds, beasts and reptiles that fell before  our arms. The very venomous _jaracucu_, a snake eight to twelve feet  long, having a double row of teeth in each jaw, is quite common here.    The forests are full of birds and beasts in infinite variety, as also  of those creatures which seem neither bird nor beast. There are large  black howling monkeys, and little black-faced ones with prehensile  tails, by "]]]
