His jaw hardened, and his glance sought the white hand upon  which the costly gems glittered. He coughed nervously.    \"Perhaps\"--his drawling manner of speech temporarily deserted him; he  spoke jerkily--\"perhaps--I can guess.\"    She watched him in a pathetic way, and there was a threat of tears in  her beautiful eyes; for whatever his earlier intentions may have  been, Sir Lucien had proved a staunch friend and, according to his own  peculiar code, an honorable lover.    \"Is it--Irvin?\" he asked jerkily.    Rita nodded, and a tear glistened upon her darkened lashes.    Sir Lucien cleared his throat again, then coolly extended his hand, once  more master of his emotions.    \"Congratulations, Rita,\" he said. \"The better man wins. I hope you will  be very happy.\"    He turned and walked quietly out of the dressing-room.        CHAPTER XVI. LIMEHOUSE    It was on the following Tuesday evening that Mrs. Sin came to the  theatre, accompanied by Mollie Gretna. Rita instructed that she should  be shown up to the dressing-room. The personality of this singular  woman interested her keenly. Mrs. Sin was well known in certain Bohemian  quarters, but was always spoken of as one speaks of a pet vice. Not  to know Mrs. Sin was to be outside the magic circle which embraced the  exclusively smart people who practiced the latest absurdities.    The so-called artistic temperament is compounded of great strength and  great weakness; its virtues are whiter than those of ordinary people and  its vices blacker. For such a personality Mrs. Sin embodied the idea of  secret pleasure. Her bold good looks repelled Rita, but the knowledge in  her dark eyes was alluring.    \"I arrange for you for Saturday night,\" she said. \"Cy Kilfane is coming  with Mollie, and you bring--\"    \"Oh,\" replied Rita hesitatingly, \"I am sorry you have gone to so much  trouble.\"    \"No trouble, my dear,\" Mrs. Sin assured her. \"Just a little matter of  business, and you can pay the bill when it suits you.\"    \"I am frightfully excited!\" cried Mollie Gretna. \"It is so nice of you  to have asked me to join your party. Of course Cy goes practically every  week, but I have always wanted another girl to go with. Oh, I shall  be in a perfectly delicious panic when I find myself all among funny  Chinamen and things! I think there is something so magnificently  wicked-looking about a pigtail--and the very name of Limehouse thrills  me to the soul!\"    That fixity of purpose which had enabled Rita to avoid the cunning  snares set for her feet and to snatch triumph from the very cauldron of  shame without burning her fingers availed her not at all in dealing with  Mrs. Sin. The image of Monte receded before this appeal to the secret  pleasure-loving woman, of insatiable curiosity, primitive and unmoral,  who dwells, according to a modern cynic philosopher, within every  daughter of Eve touched by the fire of genius.    She accepted the arrangement for Saturday, and before her visitors had  left the dressing-room her mind was busy with plausible deceits to  cover the sojourn in Chinatown. Something of Mollie Gretna's foolish  enthusiasm had communicated itself to Rita.    Later in the evening Sir Lucien called, and on hearing of the scheme  grew silent. Rita glancing at his reflection in the mirror, detected a  black and angry look upon his face. She turned to him.    \"Why, Lucy,\" she said, \"don't you want me to go?\"    He smiled in his sardonic fashion.    \"Your wishes are mine, Rita,\" he replied.    She was watching him closely.    \"But you don't seem keen,\" she persisted. \"Are you angry with me?\"    \"Angry?\"    \"We are still friends, aren't we?\"    \"Of course. Do you doubt my friendship?\"    Rita's maid came in to assist her in changing for the third act, and  Pyne went out of the room. But, in spite of his assurances, Rita could  not forget that fierce, almost savage expression which had appeared upon  his face when she had told him of Mrs. Sin's visit.    Later she taxed him on the point, but he suffered her inquiry with  imperturbable sangfroid, and she found herself no wiser respecting the  cause of his annoyance. Painful twinges of conscience came during the  ensuing days, when she found herself in her fiance's company, but she  never once seriously contemplated dropping the acquaintance of Mrs. Sin.    She thought, vaguely, as she had many times thought before, of cutting  adrift from the entire clique, but there was no return of that sincere  emotional desire to reform which she had experienced on the day that  Monte Irvin had taken her hand, in blind trust, and had asked her to be  his wife. Had she analyzed, or been capable of analyzing, her intentions  with regard to the future, she would have learned that daily they  inclined more and more towards compromise. The drug habit was sapping  will and weakening morale, insidiously, imperceptibly. She was caught in  a current of that \"sacred river\" seen in an opium-trance by Coleridge,  and which ran--        \"Through caverns measureless to man Down to a sunless sea.\"    Pyne's big car was at the stage-door on the fateful Saturday night, for  Rita had brought her dressing-case to the theatre, and having called for  Kilfane and Mollie Gretna they were to proceed direct to Limehouse.    Rita, as she entered the car, noticed that Juan Mareno, Sir Lucien's  man, and not the chauffeur with whom she was acquainted, sat at the  wheel. As they drove off:    \"Why is Mareno driving tonight, Lucy?\" she asked.    Sir Lucien glanced aside at her.    \"He is in my confidence,\" he replied. \"Fraser is not.\"    \"Oh, I see. You don't want Fraser to know about the Limehouse journey?\"    \"Naturally I don't. He would talk to all the men at the garage, and from  South Audley Street the tit-bit of scandal would percolate through every  stratum of society.\"    Rita was silent for a few moments, then:    \"Were you thinking about Monte?\" she asked diffidently.    Pyne laughed.    \"He would scarcely approve, would he?\"    \"No,\" replied Rita. \"Was that why you were angry when I told you I was  going?\"    \"This 'anger,' to which you constantly revert, had no existence outside  your own imagination, Rita. But\" he hesitated--\"you will have to  consider your position, dear, now that you are the future Mrs. Monte.\"  Rita felt her cheeks flush, and she did not reply immediately.    \"I don't understand you, Lucy,\" she declared at last. \"How odd you are.\"    \"Am I? Well, never mind. We will talk about my eccentricity later. Here  is Cyrus.\"    Kilfane was standing in the entrance to the stage door of the theatre at  which he was playing. As the car drew up he lifted two leather grips on  to the step, and Mareno, descending, took charge of them.    \"Come along, Mollie,\" said Kilfane, looking back.    Miss Gretna, very excited, ran out and got into the car beside Rita.  Pyne lowered two of the collapsible seats for Kilfane and himself, and  the party set out for Limehouse.    \"Oh!\" cried the fair-haired Mollie, grasping Rita's hand, \"my heart  began palpitating with excitement the moment I woke up this morning! How  calm you are, dear.\"    \"I am only calm outside,\" laughed Rita.    The joie de vivre and apparently unimpaired vitality, of this woman, for  whom (if half that which rumor whispered were true) vice had no secrets,  astonished Rita. Her physical resources were unusual, no doubt, because  the demand made upon them by her mental activities was slight.    As the car sped along the Strand, where theatre-goers might still be  seen making for tube, omnibus, and tramcar, and entered Fleet Street,  where the car and taxicab traffic was less, a mutual silence fell upon  the party. Two at least of the travellers were watching the lighted  windows of the great newspaper offices with a vague sense of foreboding,  and thinking how, bound upon a secret purpose, they were passing along  the avenue of publicity. It is well that man lacks prescience. Neither  Rita nor Sir Lucien could divine that a day was shortly to come when the  hidden presses which throbbed about them that night should be busy with  the story of the murder of one and disappearance of the other.    Around St. Paul's Churchyard whirled the car, its engine running  strongly and almost noiselessly. The great bell of St. Paul's boomed out  the half-hour.    \"Oh!\" cried Mollie Gretna, \"how that made me jump! What a beautifully  gloomy sound!\"    Kilfane murmured some inaudible reply, but neither Pyne nor Rita spoke.    Cornhill and Leadenhall Street, along which presently their route lay,  offered a prospect of lamp-lighted emptiness, but at Aldgate they found  themselves amid East End throngs which afforded a marked contrast to  those crowding theatreland; and from thence through Whitechapel and the  seemingly endless Commercial Road it was a different world into which  they had penetrated.    Rita hitherto had never seen the East End on a Saturday night, and the  spectacle afforded by these busy marts, lighted by naphtha flames, in  whose smoky glare Jews and Jewesses, Poles, Swedes, Easterns, dagoes,  and halfcastes moved feverishly, was a fascinating one. She thought how  utterly alien they were, the men and women of a world unknown to that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1183"],[0,"The Return of Dr. Fu-Manchu (#19)"],[1," the  thin, hairy arms of the strangling thing, and with a blood-red mist  dancing before my eyes, I seemed to be whirling madly round and round  until all became a blank. Evidently I used my nails pretty freely--and  there's the trophy.\"    For the twentieth time, I should think, I carried the ash-tray in my  hand and laid it immediately under the table-lamp in order to examine  its contents. In the little brass bowl lay a blood-stained fragment of  grayish hair attached to a tatter of skin. This fragment of epidermis  had an odd bluish tinge, and the attached hair was much darker at the  roots than elsewhere. Saving its singular color, it might have been  torn from the forearm of a very hirsute human; but although my thoughts  wandered unfettered, north, south, east and west; although, knowing the  resources of Fu-Manchu, I considered all the recognized Mongolian  types, and, in quest of hirsute mankind, even roamed far north among  the blubbering Esquimo; although I glanced at Australasia, at Central  Africa, and passed in mental review the dark places of the Congo,  nowhere in the known world, nowhere in the history of the human species,  could I come upon a type of man answering to the description suggested  by our strange clue.    Nayland Smith was watching me curiously as I bent over the little brass  ash-tray.    \"You are puzzled,\" he rapped in his short way.    \"So am I--utterly puzzled. Fu-Manchu's gallery of monstrosities clearly  has become reinforced; for even if we identified the type, we should not  be in sight of our explanation.\"    \"You mean,\" I began...    \"Fully four feet from the window, Petrie, and that window but a few  inches open! Look\"--he bent forward, resting his chest against the  table, and stretched out his hand toward me. \"You have a rule there;  just measure.\"    Setting down the ash-tray, I opened out the rule and measured the  distance from the further edge of the table to the tips of Smith's  fingers.    \"Twenty-eight inches--and I have a long reach!\" snapped Smith,  withdrawing his arm and striking a match to relight his pipe. \"There's  one thing, Petrie, often proposed before, which now we must do without  delay. The ivy must be stripped from the walls at the back. It's a  pity, but we can not afford to sacrifice our lives to our sense of the  aesthetic. What do you make of the sound like the cracking of a whip?\"    \"I make nothing of it, Smith,\" I replied, wearily. \"It might have been a  thick branch of ivy breaking beneath the weight of a climber.\"    \"Did it sound like it?\"    \"I must confess that the explanation does not convince me, but I have no  better one.\"    Smith, permitting his pipe to go out, sat staring straight before him,  and tugging at the lobe of his left ear.    \"The old bewilderment is seizing me,\" I continued. \"At first, when I  realized that Dr. Fu-Manchu was back in England, when I realized that  an elaborate murder-machine was set up somewhere in London, it seemed  unreal, fantastical. Then I met--Karamaneh! She, whom we thought to be  his victim, showed herself again to be his slave. Now, with Weymouth and  Scotland Yard at work, the old secret evil is established again in our  midst, unaccountably--our lives are menaced--sleep is a danger--every  shadow threatens death... oh! it is awful.\"    Smith remained silent; he did not seem to have heard my words. I knew  these moods and had learnt that it was useless to seek to interrupt  them. With his brows drawn down, and his deep-set eyes staring into  space, he sat there gripping his cold pipe so tightly that my own jaw  muscles ached sympathetically. No man was better equipped than this  gaunt British Commissioner to stand between society and the menace of  the Yellow Doctor; I respected his meditations, for, unlike my own, they  were informed by an intimate knowledge of the dark and secret things of  the East, of that mysterious East out of which Fu-Manchu came, of that  jungle of noxious things whose miasma had been wafted Westward with the  implacable Chinaman.    I walked quietly from the room, occupied with my own bitter reflections.        CHAPTER XV. BEWITCHMENT    \"You say you have two items of news for me?\" said Nayland Smith, looking  across the breakfast table to where Inspector Weymouth sat sipping  coffee.    \"There are two points--yes,\" replied the Scotland Yard man, whilst Smith  paused, egg-spoon in hand, and fixed his keen eyes upon the speaker.  \"The first is this: the headquarters of the Yellow group is no longer in  the East End.\"    \"How can you be sure of that?\"    \"For two reasons. In the first place, that district must now be too hot  to hold Dr. Fu-Manchu; in the second place, we have just completed a  house-to-house inquiry which has scarcely overlooked a rathole or a rat.  That place where you say Fu-Manchu was visited by some Chinese mandarin;  where you, Mr. Smith,\" and--glancing in my direction--\"you, Doctor, were  confined for a time--\"    \"Yes?\" snapped Smith, attacking his egg.    \"Well,\" continued the inspector, \"it is all deserted, now. There is not  the slightest doubt that the Chinaman has fled to some other abode. I am  certain of it. My second piece of news will interest you very much, I am  sure. You were taken to the establishment of the Chinaman, Shen-Yan, by  a certain ex-officer of New York Police--Burke...\"    \"Good God!\" cried Smith, looking up with a start; \"I thought they had  him!\"    \"So did I,\" replied Weymouth grimly; \"but they haven't! He got away in  the confusion following the raid, and has been hiding ever since with a  cousin, a nurseryman out Upminster way...\"    \"Hiding?\" snapped Smith.    \"Exactly--hiding. He has been afraid to stir ever since, and has  scarcely shown his nose outside the door. He says he is watched night  and day.\"    \"Then how...\"    \"He realized that something must be done,\" continued the inspector,  \"and made a break this morning. He is so convinced of this constant  surveillance that he came away secretly, hidden under the boxes of a  market-wagon. He landed at Covent Garden in the early hours of this  morning and came straight away to the Yard.\"    \"What is he afraid of exactly?\"    Inspector Weymouth put down his coffee cup and bent forward slightly.    \"He knows something,\" he said in a low voice, \"and they are aware that  he knows it!\"    \"And what is this he knows?\"    Nayland Smith stared eagerly at the detective.    \"Every man has his price,\" replied Weymouth with a smile, \"and Burke  seems to think that you are a more likely market than the police  authorities.\"    \"I see,\" snapped Smith. \"He wants to see me?\"    \"He wants you to go and see him,\" was the reply. \"I think he anticipates  that you may make a capture of the person or persons spying upon him.\"    \"Did he give you any particulars?\"    \"Several. He spoke of a sort of gipsy girl with whom he had a short  conversation one day, over the fence which divides his cousin's flower  plantations from the lane adjoining.\"    \"Gipsy girl!\" I whispered, glancing rapidly at Smith.    \"I think you are right, Doctor,\" said Weymouth with his slow smile; \"it  was Karamaneh. She asked him the way to somewhere or other and got him  to write it upon a loose page of his notebook, so that she should not  forget it.\"    \"You hear that, Petrie?\" rapped Smith.    \"I hear it,\" I replied, \"but I don't see any special significance in the  fact.\"    \"I do!\" rapped Smith; \"I didn't sit up the greater part of last night  thrashing my weary brains for nothing! But I am going to the British  Museum to-day, to confirm a certain suspicion.\" He turned to Weymouth.  \"Did Burke go back?\" he demanded abruptly.    \"He returned hidden under the empty boxes,\" was the reply. \"Oh! you  never saw a man in such a funk in all your life!\"    \"He may have good reasons,\" I said.    \"He has good reasons!\" replied Nayland Smith grimly; \"if that man really  possesses information inimical to the safety of Fu-Manchu, he can only  escape doom by means of a miracle similar to that which has hitherto  protected you and me.\"    \"Burke insists,\" said Weymouth at this point, \"that something comes  almost every night after dusk, slinking about the house--it's an old  farmhouse, I understand; and on two or three occasions he has been  awakened (fortunately for him he is a light sleeper) by sounds of  coughing immediately outside his window. He is a man who sleeps with a  pistol under his pillow, and more than once, on running to the window,  he has had a vague glimpse of some creature leaping down from the tiles  of the roof, which slopes up to his room, into the flower beds below...\"    \"Creature!\" said Smith, his gray eyes ablaze now--\"you said creature!\"    \"I used the word deliberately,\" replied Weymouth, \"because Burke seems  to have the idea that it goes on all fours.\"    There was a short and rather strained silence. Then:    \"In descending a sloping roof,\" I suggested, \"a human being would  probably employ his hands as well as his feet.\"    \"Quite so,\" agreed the inspector. \"I am merely reporting the impression  of Burke.\"    \"Has he heard no other sound?\" rapped Smith; \"one like the cracking of  dry branches, for instance?\"    \"He made no mention of it,\" replied Weymouth, staring.    \"And what is the plan?\"    \"One of his cousin's vans,\" said Weymouth, with his slight smile, \"has  remained behind at Covent Garden and will return late this afternoon.  I propose that you and I, Mr. Smith, imitate Burke and ride down to  Upminster under the empty boxes!\"    Nayland Smith stood up, leaving his breakfast half finished, and began  to wander up and down the room, reflectively tugging at his ear. Then he  began to fumble in the pockets of his dressing-gown and finally produced  the inevitable pipe, dilapidated pouch, and box of safety matches. He  began to load the much-charred agent of reflection.    \"Do I understand that Burke is actually too afraid to go out openly even  in daylight?\" he asked suddenly.    \"H"]]]
