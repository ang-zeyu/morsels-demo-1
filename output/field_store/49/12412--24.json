The layer nearest the  outer husk contains vegetable fibrin and fatty matter. The second layer  is largely composed of gluten cells; while the center comprising the  bulk of the grain, is chiefly made up of starch granules with a small  proportion of gluten.    The structure of a wheat kernel is well illustrated in the   accompanying cut. As will be seen, the different food elements are   situated in different parts of the grain, and not uniformly distributed  throughout its structure. The outer husk of the berry is composed wholly  of innutritious and indigestible matter, but the thin layers which lie  next this outer covering contain the larger proportion of the  nitrogenous elements to be found in the entire kernel. The central  portion consists almost wholly of farinaceous matter.    [Illustration: Sectional View of Wheat Kernel.]    Phosphates and other mineral matter are present to some extent  throughout the entire grain, but preponderates in the external part.  Here is also found a peculiar, soluble, active principle called  diastase, which possesses the power of converting starch into sugar. The  dark color and marked flavor of Graham bread is undoubtedly due to the  influence of this element.    Until within a few years the unground grain was rarely used as an  article of food, but people are beginning to appreciate its  wholesomeness, and cracked, rolled, and pearled wheats are coming  rapidly into favor. Cracked wheat is the grain cleaned and then cut into  two or more pieces; in rolled wheat the grains are mashed between  rollers, by which process they are thoroughly softened in every part,  and are then easily cooked. Pearl wheat is the whole grain cleaned and  dressed. The whole grain is also cooked sometimes in its natural state.    PREPARATION AND COOKING.--Few articles of food show greater  difference between good and poor cooking than the various grains. Dry,  harsh, or underdone, they are as unwholesome as unpalatable. Like most  of the grains, wheat, with the exception of new wheat boiled whole,  should be put into boiling water and allowed to cook continuously but  slowly until done. Any of the unground preparations require prolonged  cooking. The average length of time and the approximate amount of water  needed in cooking _one cupful_ of the various wheat preparations in a  double boiler is stated on page 82.    _RECIPES._    PEARL WHEAT.--Heat a quart of water to boiling in the inner dish of  a double boiler, and stir into it one cup or one-half pint of pearl  wheat. Let it boil rapidly until thickened and the wheat has ceased  settling, then place in the outer boiler, in which the water should be  boiling, and cook continuously from three to four hours.    CRACKED WHEAT.--Cracked wheat may be cooked in the same manner as  pearl wheat, by using four and one-half parts of water to one of grain.  The length of time required to cook it thoroughly is about the same as  for pearl wheat.    ROLLED WHEAT.--This preparation of wheat requires only three parts  water to one of wheat. It should be cooked in the same way as pearled  wheat, but requires only three hours' cooking.    BOILED WHEAT (sometimes called frumenty).--Select newly-cut wheat,  well rubbed or threshed out. Look it over carefully, wash, and put to  cook in five times its measure of cold water. Let it come to a boil, and  cook gently until the grains burst open, and it can be readily mashed  between the thumb and finger. This will require from four to ten hours,  depending upon the age and variety of the wheat used. When done, it  should be even full of a rich, thick liquor. If necessary, add more  boiling water, but stir as little as possible. It may be served with  cream, the same as other wheat preparations. It is also excellent served  with lemon and other fruit sauces.    WHEAT WITH RAISINS.--Raisins or Zante currants may be added to any  of the foregoing recipes, if desired. The raisins or currants should be  well steamed previously, however, and stirred in lightly and evenly just  before dishing. If cooked with the grain, they become soft, broken, and  insipid. Figs, well steamed and chopped, may be added in the same way.    WHEAT WITH FRESH FRUIT.--Fresh whortleberries, blueberries, and  blackberries stirred into any of the well-cooked wheat preparations just  before serving, make a very desirable addition. A most delicious dish  may be prepared by stirring into well-cooked cracked wheat a few  spoonfuls of rather thick cream and some fresh wild blackberries. Serve  hot.    MOLDED WHEAT.--Cracked wheat, rolled wheat, or pearl wheat, cooked  according to the foregoing recipes, and turned into molds until cold,  makes a very palatable dessert, and may be served with sugar and cream  or with fruit juice. Bits of jelly placed on top of the molds in the  form of stars or crosses, add to the appearance. Molded grains are also  very nice served with fresh berries, either mashed or whole, arranged  around the mold.      FINER MILL PRODUCTS OF WHEAT.    The grain of wheat is inclosed in a woody envelope. The cellular layers  just beneath contain the largest proportion of nitrogenous matter, in  the form of gluten, and are hard of pulverization, while the starchy  heart of the grain is easily crumbled into fine dust. Thus it will be  readily understood that when the grain is subjected to an equal  pulverizing force, the several portions will be likely to be crushed  into particles of different sizes. The outer husk being toughest, will  be the least affected, the nitrogenous or glutenous portion will be much  finer, while the brittle starch will be reduced to powder. This first  simple product of grinding is termed wheat meal, unbolted, or Graham  flour, and of course contains all the elements of the grain. In ordinary  milling, however, this is subjected to various siftings, boltings, or  dressings, to separate the finer from the coarser particles, and then  subdivided into various grades of flour, which vary much in composition  and properties. The coarser product contains the largest proportion of  nutrients, while in the finer portions there is an exclusion of a large  part of the nitrogenous element of the grain. The outer portions of the  wheat kernel, which contain the greater part of the nitrogenous element,  are darker in color than the central, starchy portion. It will be  apparent, then, that the finer and whiter the flour, the less nutriment  it is likely to contain, and that in the use of superfine white flour  the eye is gratified at the expense of the body.    A preparation called farina, is made from the central portion of wheat,  freed from bran, and crushed into granules. Another preparation, called  Graham grits, is prepared by granulating the outer layers of the kernel  together with the germ of the wheat. This preparation, comparatively a  new one, includes the most nutritious properties of the grain, and its  granular form renders it excellent for mushes as well as for other  purposes. Farina is scarcely more nutritious than white flour, and  should not be used as a staple food. Graham grits contains the best  elements of the wheat grain in good proportion, and is one of the best  preparations of wheat. Other preparations of wheat somewhat similar in  character are farinose, germlet, etc.      _RECIPES._    FARINA.--Heat a pint of milk and one of water, or if preferred, a  quart of milk, in the inner cup of a double boiler; and when boiling,  stir in five tablespoonfuls of farina, moistened evenly with a little  milk. Let it boil rapidly until well set, which will be in about five or  eight minutes; then place in the outer boiler, and cook one hour. Serve  cold or hot with a dressing of cream or fruit juices. Farina may be  cooked in water alone, but on account of its lack of nutritive elements,  it is more valuable if prepared with milk.    FARINA WITH FIG SAUCE.--Cook the farina as in the foregoing recipe,  and serve hot with a fig sauce prepared as follows:--    Carefully look over, washed, and chop or cut quite finally, enough good  figs to make a cupful. Stew in a pint of water, to which has been added  a tablespoonful of sugar, until they are one homogeneous mass. If the  figs are not of the best quality and do not readily soften, it is well,  after stewing for a time, to rub them through a colander or vegetable  press to break up the tough portions and make a smooth sauce. Put a  spoonful of the hot fig sauce on each individual dish of farina, and  serve with cream or without dressing.    FARINA WITH FRESH FRUIT.--Cook the farina as previously directed.  Have some sliced yellow peaches, mellow sweet apples, or bananas in a  dish, turn the farina over them, stir up lightly with a fork, and serve  hot with cream.    MOLDED FARINA.--Farina to be used cold may be cooked in the same  manner as before described, with two or three tablespoonfuls of sugar  added at the same time with the farina, and when done, molded in cups  previously wet with a little cold water. Serve with a dressing of fruit  juice, whipped cream flavored with lemon, or mock cream flavored with  cocoanut.    GRAHAM GRITS.--To four parts of water boiling in the inner dish of  a double boiler add slowly, so as not to stop the boiling of the water,  one part of Graham grits. Stir until thickened, then place in the outer  boiler, and steam from three to five hours. Serve hot with cream, or  mold in cups previously dipped in cold water, and serve with a dressing  of fruit juice. The fig sauce prepared as previously directed, is also  excellent with Graham grits.    GRAHAM MUSH NO. 1.--Good flour is the first requisite for making  good Graham mush. Poor Graham flour cannot be made into first-class  mush. Flour"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12242"],[0,"Poems (#19)"],[1,"a lonesome tone;    Is heaven then so sad?    That bells should joyful ring to tell    A soul had gone to heaven,  Would seem to me the proper way    A good news should be given.            XLIV.    If I may have it when it's dead    I will contented be;  If just as soon as breath is out    It shall belong to me,    Until they lock it in the grave,    'T is bliss I cannot weigh,  For though they lock thee in the grave,    Myself can hold the key.    Think of it, lover! I and thee    Permitted face to face to be;  After a life, a death we'll say, --    For death was that, and this is thee.            XLV.    Before the ice is in the pools,    Before the skaters go,  Or any cheek at nightfall    Is tarnished by the snow,    Before the fields have finished,    Before the Christmas tree,  Wonder upon wonder    Will arrive to me!    What we touch the hems of    On a summer's day;  What is only walking    Just a bridge away;    That which sings so, speaks so,    When there's no one here, --  Will the frock I wept in    Answer me to wear?            XLVI.    DYING.    I heard a fly buzz when I died;    The stillness round my form  Was like the stillness in the air    Between the heaves of storm.    The eyes beside had wrung them dry,    And breaths were gathering sure  For that last onset, when the king    Be witnessed in his power.    I willed my keepsakes, signed away    What portion of me I  Could make assignable, -- and then    There interposed a fly,    With blue, uncertain, stumbling buzz,    Between the light and me;  And then the windows failed, and then    I could not see to see.            XLVII.    Adrift! A little boat adrift!    And night is coming down!  Will no one guide a little boat    Unto the nearest town?    So sailors say, on yesterday,    Just as the dusk was brown,  One little boat gave up its strife,    And gurgled down and down.    But angels say, on yesterday,    Just as the dawn was red,  One little boat o'erspent with gales  Retrimmed its masts, redecked its sails    Exultant, onward sped!            XLVIII.    There's been a death in the opposite house    As lately as to-day.  I know it by the numb look    Such houses have alway.    The neighbors rustle in and out,    The doctor drives away.  A window opens like a pod,    Abrupt, mechanically;    Somebody flings a mattress out, --    The children hurry by;  They wonder if It died on that, --    I used to when a boy.    The minister goes stiffly in    As if the house were his,  And he owned all the mourners now,    And little boys besides;    And then the milliner, and the man    Of the appalling trade,  To take the measure of the house.    There'll be that dark parade    Of tassels and of coaches soon;    It's easy as a sign, --  The intuition of the news    In just a country town.            XLIX.    We never know we go, -- when we are going    We jest and shut the door;  Fate following behind us bolts it,    And we accost no more.          L.    THE SOUL'S STORM.    It struck me every day    The lightning was as new  As if the cloud that instant slit    And let the fire through.    It burned me in the night,    It blistered in my dream;  It sickened fresh upon my sight    With every morning's beam.    I thought that storm was brief, --    The maddest, quickest by;  But Nature lost the date of this,    And left it in the sky.            LI.    Water is taught by thirst;  Land, by the oceans passed;    Transport, by throe;  Peace, by its battles told;  Love, by memorial mould;    Birds, by the snow.          LII.    THIRST.    We thirst at first, -- 't is Nature's act;    And later, when we die,  A little water supplicate    Of fingers going by.    It intimates the finer want,    Whose adequate supply  Is that great water in the west    Termed immortality.            LIII.    A clock stopped -- not the mantel's;    Geneva's farthest skill  Can't put the puppet bowing    That just now dangled still.    An awe came on the trinket!    The figures hunched with pain,  Then quivered out of decimals    Into degreeless noon.    It will not stir for doctors,    This pendulum of snow;  The shopman importunes it,    While cool, concernless No    Nods from the gilded pointers,    Nods from the seconds slim,  Decades of arrogance between    The dial life and him.            LIV.    CHARLOTTE BRONTE'S GRAVE.    All overgrown by cunning moss,    All interspersed with weed,  The little cage of 'Currer Bell,'    In quiet Haworth laid.    This bird, observing others,    When frosts too sharp became,  Retire to other latitudes,    Quietly did the same,    But differed in returning;    Since Yorkshire hills are green,  Yet not in all the nests I meet    Can nightingale be seen.    Gathered from many wanderings,    Gethsemane can tell  Through what transporting anguish    She reached the asphodel!    Soft fall the sounds of Eden    Upon her puzzled ear;  Oh, what an afternoon for heaven,    When 'Bronte' entered there!            LV.    A toad can die of light!  Death is the common right    Of toads and men, --  Of earl and midge  The privilege.    Why swagger then?  The gnat's supremacy  Is large as thine.            LVI.    Far from love the Heavenly Father    Leads the chosen child;  Oftener through realm of briar    Than the meadow mild,    Oftener by the claw of dragon    Than the hand of friend,  Guides the little one predestined    To the native land.            LVII.    SLEEPING.    A long, long sleep, a famous sleep    That makes no show for dawn  By stretch of limb or stir of lid, --    An independent one.    Was ever idleness like this?    Within a hut of stone  To bask the centuries away    Nor once look up for noon?            LVIII.    RETROSPECT.    'T was just this time last year I died.    I know I heard the corn,  When I was carried by the farms, --    It had the tassels on.    I thought how yellow it would look    When Richard went to mill;  And then I wanted to get out,    But something held my will.    I thought just how red apples wedged    The stubble's joints between;  And carts went stooping round the fields    To take the pumpkins in.    I wondered which would miss me least,    And when Thanksgiving came,  If father'd multiply the plates    To make an even sum.    And if my stocking hung too high,    Would it blur the Christmas glee,  That not a Santa Claus could reach    The altitude of me?    But this sort grieved myself, and so    I thought how it would be  When just this time, some perfect year,    Themselves should come to me.            LIX.    ETERNITY.    On this wondrous sea,  Sailing silently,    Ho! pilot, ho!  Knowest thou the shore  Where no breakers roar,    Where the storm is o'er?    In the silent west  Many sails at rest,    Their anchors fast;  Thither I pilot thee, --  Land, ho! Eternity!    Ashore at last!"]]]
