It was during one of these frequent periods of utter exhaustion  that he heard the flap of dismal wings close above him.  With his  remaining strength he turned himself over on his back to see Ska  wheel quickly upward. With the sight Tarzan's mind cleared for a  while.    \"Is the end so near as that?\" he thought. \"Does Ska know that I am  so near gone that he dares come down and perch upon my carcass?\"  And even then a grim smile touched those swollen lips as into the  savage mind came a sudden thought--the cunning of the wild beast  at bay. Closing his eyes he threw a forearm across them to protect  them from Ska's powerful beak and then he lay very still and waited.    It was restful lying there, for the sun was now obscured by clouds  and Tarzan was very tired. He feared that he might sleep and something  told him that if he did he would never awaken, and so he concentrated  all his remaining powers upon the one thought of remaining awake.  Not a muscle moved--to Ska, circling above, it became evident that  the end had come--that at last he should be rewarded for his long  vigil.    Circling slowly he dropped closer and closer to the dying man. Why  did not Tarzan move? Had he indeed been overcome by the sleep of  exhaustion, or was Ska right--had death at last claimed that mighty  body? Was that great, savage heart stilled forever? It is unthinkable.    Ska, filled with suspicions, circled warily. Twice he almost alighted  upon the great, naked breast only to wheel suddenly away; but the  third time his talons touched the brown skin.  It was as though the  contact closed an electric circuit that instantaneously vitalized  the quiet clod that had lain motionless so long. A brown hand swept  downward from the brown forehead and before Ska could raise a wing  in flight he was in the clutches of his intended victim.    Ska fought, but he was no match for even a dying Tarzan, and  a moment later the ape-man's teeth closed upon the carrion-eater.  The flesh was coarse and tough and gave off an unpleasant odor and  a worse taste; but it was food and the blood was drink and Tarzan  only an ape at heart and a dying ape into the bargain--dying of  starvation and thirst.    Even mentally weakened as he was the ape-man was still master  of his appetite and so he ate but sparingly, saving the rest, and  then, feeling that he now could do so safely, he turned upon his  side and slept.    Rain, beating heavily upon his body, awakened him and sitting up he  cupped his hands and caught the precious drops which he transferred  to his parched throat. Only a little he got at a time; but that  was best. The few mouthfuls of Ska that he had eaten, together with  the blood and rain water and the sleep had refreshed him greatly  and put new strength into his tired muscles.    Now he could see the hills again and they were close and, though  there was no sun, the world looked bright and cheerful, for Tarzan  knew that he was saved. The bird that would have devoured him, and  the providential rain, had saved him at the very moment that death  seemed inevitable.    Again partaking of a few mouthfuls of the unsavory flesh of Ska,  the vulture, the ape-man arose with something of his old force  and set out with steady gait toward the hills of promise rising  alluringly ahead. Darkness fell before he reached them; but he  kept on until he felt the steeply rising ground that proclaimed  his arrival at the base of the hills proper, and then he lay down  and waited until morning should reveal the easiest passage to the  land beyond. The rain had ceased, but the sky still was overcast  so that even his keen eyes could not penetrate the darkness farther  than a few feet. And there he slept, after eating again of what  remained of Ska, until the morning sun awakened him with a new  sense of strength and well-being.    And so at last he came through the hills out of the valley of death  into a land of park-like beauty, rich in game. Below him lay a deep  valley through the center of which dense jungle vegetation marked  the course of a river beyond which a primeval forest extended  for miles to terminate at last at the foot of lofty, snow-capped  mountains. It was a land that Tarzan never had looked upon before,  nor was it likely that the foot of another white man ever had  touched it unless, possibly, in some long-gone day the adventurer  whose skeleton he had found bleaching in the canyon had traversed  it.          Chapter VIII    Tarzan and the Great Apes      Three days the ape-man spent in resting and recuperating, eating  fruits and nuts and the smaller animals that were most easily  bagged, and upon the fourth he set out to explore the valley and  search for the great apes. Time was a negligible factor in the  equation of life--it was all the same to Tarzan if he reached the  west coast in a month or a year or three years. All time was his and  all Africa. His was absolute freedom--the last tie that had bound  him to civilization and custom had been severed. He was alone but  he was not exactly lonely. The greater part of his life had been  spent thus, and though there was no other of his kind, he was at  all times surrounded by the jungle peoples for whom familiarity had  bred no contempt within his breast. The least of them interested  him, and, too, there were those with whom he always made friends  easily, and there were his hereditary enemies whose presence gave a  spice to life that might otherwise have become humdrum and monotonous.    And so it was that on the fourth day he set out to explore the  valley and search for his fellow-apes. He had proceeded southward  for a short distance when his nostrils were assailed by the scent  of man, of Gomangani, the black man. There were many of them, and  mixed with their scent was another-that of a she Tarmangani.    Swinging through the trees Tarzan approached the authors of these  disturbing scents. He came warily from the flank, but paying no  attention to the wind, for he knew that man with his dull senses  could apprehend him only through his eyes or ears and then only  when comparatively close. Had he been stalking Numa or Sheeta he  would have circled about until his quarry was upwind from him, thus  taking practically all the advantage up to the very moment that  he came within sight or hearing; but in the stalking of the dull  clod, man, he approached with almost contemptuous indifference,  so that all the jungle about him knew that he was passing--all but  the men he stalked.    From the dense foliage of a great tree he watched them pass--a  disreputable mob of blacks, some garbed in the uniform of German  East African native troops, others wearing a single garment of the  same uniform, while many had reverted to the simple dress of their  forbears--approximating nudity.  There were many black women with  them, laughing and talking as they kept pace with the men, all of  whom were armed with German rifles and equipped with German belts  and ammunition.    There were no white officers there, but it was none the less apparent  to Tarzan that these men were from some German native command,  and he guessed that they had slain their officers and taken to the  jungle with their women, or had stolen some from native villages  through which they must have passed. It was evident that they were  putting as much ground between themselves and the coast as possible  and doubtless were seeking some impenetrable fastness of the vast  interior where they might inaugurate a reign of terror among the  primitively armed inhabitants and by raiding, looting, and rape  grow rich in goods and women at the expense of the district upon  which they settled themselves.    Between two of the black women marched a slender white girl. She  was hatless and with torn and disheveled clothing that had evidently  once been a trim riding habit. Her coat was gone and her waist half  torn from her body. Occasionally and without apparent provocation  one or the other of the Negresses struck or pushed her roughly.  Tarzan watched through half-closed eyes. His first impulse was to  leap among them and bear the girl from their cruel clutches. He had  recognized her immediately and it was because of this fact that he  hesitated.    What was it to Tarzan of the Apes what fate befell this enemy  spy? He had been unable to kill her himself because of an inherent  weakness that would not permit him to lay hands upon a woman, all  of which of course had no bearing upon what others might do to  her. That her fate would now be infinitely more horrible than the  quick and painless death that the ape-man would have meted to her  only interested Tarzan to the extent that the more frightful the  end of a German the more in keeping it would be with what they all  deserved.    And so he let the blacks pass with Fraulein Bertha Kircher in their  midst, or at least until the last straggling warrior suggested to  his mind the pleasures of black-baiting--an amusement and a sport  in which he had grown ever more proficient since that long-gone day  when Kulonga, the son of Mbonga, the chief, had cast his unfortunate  spear at Kala, the ape-man's foster mother.    The last man, who must have stopped for some purpose, was fully a  quarter of a mile in rear of the party. He was hurrying to catch  up when Tarzan saw him, and as he passed beneath the tree in which  the ape-man perched above the trail, a silent noose dropped deftly  about his neck. The main body still was in plain sight, and as the  frightened man voiced a piercing shriek of terror, they looked back  to see his body rise as though by magic straight into the air and  disappear amidst the leafy foliage above.    For a moment the blacks stood paralyzed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14012"],[0,"Ice-Caves of France and Switzerland (#19)"],[1,"are a healthy and energetic  race. The beauties of the surrounding mountains, with their fitful  alternations of pasture and wood, and grey face of rock, are not  marred by the outward appearance, at least, of that which Bishop Heber  lamented in a country where 'every prospect pleases.' An old lady is  commemorated in the annals of Couvet as an example of the healthiness  of the situation, who saw seven generations of her family, having  known her great-grandfather in her early years, and living to nurse  great-grandchildren in her old age. The landlord of the inn informed  us, with much pride, that Couvet was the birthplace of the man who  invented a clock for telling the time at sea; by which, no doubt, he  meant the chronometer, invented by M. Berthoud. At Motiers, the next  village, Rousseau wrote his _Lettres de la Montagne_, and thence it  was that he fled from popular violence to the island on the Lake of  Bienne.    The 'Ecu' promised us dinner in half an hour, and we strolled about in  the garden of that unsophisticated hotel for an hour and a half,  reconciled to the delay by the beauty of the neighbouring hills, the  winding of the valley giving all the effect of a mountain-locked plain,  with barriers decked with firs. It will readily be conceived, however,  that three practical English people could not be satisfied to feed on  beauty alone for any very great length of time, and we caught the  landlady and became peremptory. She explained that dinner was quite  ready, but she had intended to give us the pleasure of an agreeable  society, consisting of sundry Swiss who were due in another half-hour or  so: she yielded, nevertheless, to our representations, and promised to  serve the meal at once. We were speedily summoned to the  _salle-a-manger,_ and entered a low smoke-stained wooden chamber, with  no floor to speak of, and with huge beams supporting the roof, dangerous  for tall heads. The date on the door was 1690, and the chamber fully  looked its age. There was a long table of the prevailing hue, with a  similar bench; and on the table three large basins, presumably  containing soup, were ranged, each covered with its plate, and  accompanied by a ricketty spoon of yellow metal and a hunch of black  bread. A., who was hungry enough and experienced enough to have known  better, began promptly a most pathetic 'Why surely!' but the landlady  stopped her by opening a side door, and displaying a comfortable room in  which a well-appointed table awaited us:--she had taken us through the  kitchen rather than through the _salon_, in which were peasants smoking.  We were somewhat disconcerted when we heard that the unwashed-looking  place was the kitchen; but the landlady had made up for it by scrubbing  her husband, who waited upon us, to a high pitch of presentability, and  further experience showed that the 'Ecu' is to be highly commended for  the excellence and abundance and cheapness of its foods.    There are many natural curiosities in and near the Val de Travers, which  well repay the labour that must be expended upon them. The _Temple des  Fees_, on the western side of the Valley of Verrieres, used to be called  the most beautiful grotto in Switzerland; and the great Cavern of La  Baume, near Motiers, is said to be exceedingly wonderful. We were shown  the entrance to a line of caverns in the hills above Couvet, and were  informed that it was possible to pierce completely through the range,  and pass out at the other side within sight of Yverdun. One of the  caverns in this valley had been explored by some of A. and M.'s Swiss  friends, and the account of what they had gone through was by no means  inviting, seeing that the prevailing material was damp clay of a solid  character, arranged in steep slopes, up which progression must be made  by inserting the fingers and toes as far as might be into the clay; and,  of course, when the handful of unpleasant mud came away, the result was  the reverse of progression. To anyone who has only known the rope up the  pure white side of some snow mountain, the idea of being roped for the  purpose of grappling with underground banks of adhesive mud and clay  must be horrible in the extreme. Another interesting natural phenomenon  is presented by the source of the Reuse, that river gushing out from the  rock in considerable volume, probably formed by the drainage of the Lake  of Etallieres, in the distant valley of La Brevine; while the  Longe-aigue, on the contrary, is lost in a gulf of such horror that the  people call the mill which stands on its edge the _Moulin d'enfer_.    As usual, we were assured that many of these remarkable sights were far  better worth a visit than the glaciere, of which no one seemed to know  anything. A guide was at length secured for the next morning, who had  made his way to the cave once in the winter-time and had been unable to  enter it, and we settled down quietly to an evening of perfect rest. The  windows of the bedrooms being guiltless of blinds and curtains, the  effect of waking, in the early morning, to find them blocked up, as it  were, by the green slopes of pasture and the dark bands of fir-woods  which clothed the limiting hills, seemed almost magical, the foreground  being occupied solely by the graceful curve of the dome of the  church-tower, glittering with intercepted rays, and forming a bright  omen for the day thus ushered in.    In due time the promised guide appeared, a sickly boy of unprepossessing  appearance, and of _patois_ to correspond. I was at first tempted to  propose that we should attack him stereoscopically, A. administering  French and I simultaneous German, in the hope that the combination  might convey some meaning to him; but, after a time, we succeeded with  French alone. Perhaps Latin would have made a more likely _melange_ than  German, and to give it him in three dimensions would not have been a bad  plan. The route for the glaciere runs straight up the face of the hill  along which the railway has been constructed; and as we passed through  woods of beech and fir, with fresh green glades rolling down below our  feet, or emerged from the woods to cross large undulating expanses of  meadow-land, we were almost inclined to believe that we had never done  so lovely a walk. The scenery through which we passed was thoroughly  that of the lower districts of the Alps, with nothing Jurane in its  character, and the elevation finally achieved was not very great:  indeed, at a short distance from the glaciere, we passed a collection of  very neat chalets, with gardens and garden-flowers, one of the chalets  rejoicing in countless beehives, with three or four 'ekes' apiece. Up to  the time of reaching this little village, which seemed to be called  Sagnette, our path had been that which leads to _La Brevine_, the  highest valley in the canton; but now we turned off abruptly up the  steeper face on the left hand, and in a very few minutes came upon a dry  wilderness of rock and grass, which we at once recognised as 'glaciere  country;' and when I told our guide that we must be near the place, he  replied by pointing to the trees round the mouth of the pit.    Shortly after we first left Couvet, a gaunt elderly female, with a  one-bullock char, had joined our party, and tried to bully us into  giving up the cave and going instead to a neighbouring summit, whence  she promised us a view of unrivalled extent and beauty. She told us that  there was nothing to be seen in the glaciere, and that it was a place  where people lost their lives. The guide said that was nonsense; but  she reduced him to silence by quoting a case in point. She said, too,  that if a man slipped and fell, there was nothing to prevent him from  going helplessly down a run of ice into a subterranean watercourse,  which would carry him for two or three leagues underground; and on this  head our boy had no counter-statement to make. She asserted that without  ladders it was utterly impossible to make the descent to the  commencement of the glaciere; and she vowed there was no ladder now, nor  had been for some time. Here the boy came in, stating that the cave  belonged to a mademoiselle of Neufchatel, who had a summer cottage at no  great distance, and loved to be supplied with ice during her residence  in the country, for which purpose she kept a sound ladder on the spot,  and had it removed in the winter that it might not be destroyed. There  was a circumstantial air about this statement which for the moment got  the better of the old woman; but she speedily recovered herself, and  repeated positively that there was no ladder of any description, adding,  somewhat inconsequently, that it was such a bad one, no Christian could  use it with safety. The boy retorted, that it was all very well for her  to run the glaciere down, as she lived near it, but for the world from a  distance it was a most wonderful sight; and, as for the ladder, he  happened to know that it was at this time in excellent preservation. The  event proved that in saying this he drew entirely upon his imagination.  It is, perhaps, only fair to suppose that they don't mean anything by  it, and it may be mere ignorance on their part; but the simple fact is,  that some of those Swiss rustics tell the most barefaced lies  conceivable,--_unblushing_ is an epithet that cannot be safely applied  without previous soap and water,--and tell them in a plodding systematic  manner which takes in all but the experienced and wary traveller. I have  myself learned to suspend my judgment regarding the most simple thing in  nature, until I have other grounds for forming an opinion than the  solemn asseverations of the most stolid and respectable Swiss, if it so  be that money depends upon his report.[51]    As in the case of two of the glacieres already described, the entrance  is by a deep pit, which has the appearance of having been at one time  two pits, one less deep than"]]]
