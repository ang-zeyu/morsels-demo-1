Oh, God, Tex, what c'n I  do to fight agin this here cold feelin' at my heart?\"    Dan slipped down beside the marshal and the latter dropped a  sympathetic hand over the lean, brown fingers. They returned the  pressure with a bone-crushing grip.    \"Fight, Dan! It will make you forget her.\"    \"Her skin is softer'n satin, Tex.\"    \"Ay, but you'll never touch it again, Dan.\"    \"Her eyes are deeper'n a pool at night an' her hair is all gold like  ripe corn.\"    \"You'll never look into her eyes again, Dan, and you'll never touch  the gold of that hair.\"    \"God!\"    The word was hardly more than a whisper, but it brought Black Bart  leaping to his feet.    Dan spoke again: \"Tex, I'm thankin' you for listenin' to me; I wanted  to talk. Bein' silent was burnin' me up. There's one thing more.\"    \"Fire it out, lad.\"    \"This evenin' I told you I hated no man but Jim Silent.\"    \"Yes.\"    \"An' now they's another of his gang. Sometime--when she's standin'  by--I'm goin' to take him by the throat till he don't breathe no more.  Then I'll throw him down in front of her an' ask her if she c'n kiss  the life back into his lips!\"    Calder was actually shaking with excitement, but he was wise enough  not to speak.    \"Tex!\"    \"Ay, lad.\"    \"But when I've choked his damned life away----\"    \"Yes?\"    \"Ay, lad.\"    \"There'll be five more that seen her shamin' me. Tex--all hell is  bustin' loose inside me!\"    For a moment Calder watched, but that stare of cold hate mastered him.  He turned his head.          CHAPTER XV      THE CROSS ROADS    As Black Bart raced away in answer to Dan's whistle, Kate recovered  herself from the daze in which she stood and with a sob ran towards  the willows, calling the name of Dan, but Silent sprang after her, and  caught her by the arm. She cried out and struggled vainly in his grip.    \"Don't follow him, boys!\" called Silent. \"He's a dog that can bite  while he runs. Stand quiet, girl!\"    Lee Haines caught him by the shoulder and jerked Silent around. His  hand held the butt of his revolver, and his whole arm trembled with  eagerness for the draw.    \"Take your hand from her, Jim!\" he said.    Silent met his eye with the same glare and while his left hand still  held Kate by both her wrists his right dropped to his gun.    \"Not when you tell me, Lee!\"    \"Damn you, I say let her go!\"    \"By God, Haines, I stand for too much from you!\"    And still they did not draw, because each of them knew that if the  crisis came it would mean death to them both. Bill Kilduff jumped  between them and thrust them back.    He cried, \"Ain't we got enough trouble without roundin' up work at  home? Terry Jordan is shot through the arm.\"    Kate tugged at the restraining hand of Silent, not in an attempt to  escape, but in order to get closer to Haines.    \"Was this your friendship?\" she said, her voice shaking with hate and  sorrow, \"to bring me here as a lure for Whistling Dan? Listen to me,  all of you! He's escaped you now, and he'll come again. Remember him,  for he shan't forget you!\"    \"You hear her?\" said Silent to Haines.    \"Is this what you want me to turn loose?\"    \"Silent,\" said Haines, \"it isn't the girl alone you've double crossed.  You've crooked me, and you'll pay me for it sooner or later!\"    \"Day or night, winter or summer, I'm willing to meet you an' fight it  out. Rhinehart and Purvis, take this girl back to the clearing!\"    They approached, Purvis still staring at the hand from which only a  moment before his gun had been knocked by the shot of Whistling Dan.  It was a thing which he could not understand--he had not yet lost a  most uncomfortable sense of awe. Haines made no objection when they  went off, with Kate walking between them. He knew, now that his blind  anger had left him, that it was folly to draw on a fight while the  rest of Silent's men stood around them.    \"An' the rest of you go back to the clearin'. I got somethin' to talk  over with Lee,\" said Silent.    The others obeyed without question, and the leader turned back to his  lieutenant. For a moment longer they remained staring at each other.  Then Silent moved slowly forward with outstretched hand.    \"Lee,\" he said quietly, \"I'm owin' you an apology an' I'm man enough  to make it.\"    \"I can't take your hand, Jim.\"    Silent hesitated.    \"I guess you got cause to be mad, Lee,\" he said. \"Maybe I played too  quick a hand. I didn't think about double crossin' you. I only seen  a way to get Whistlin' Dan out of our path, an' I took it without  rememberin' that you was the safeguard to the girl.\"    Haines eyed his chief narrowly.    \"I wish to God I could read your mind,\" he said at last, \"but I'll  take your word that you did it without thinking.\"    His hand slowly met Silent's.    \"An' what about the girl now, Lee?\"    \"I'll send her back to her father's ranch. It will be easy to put her  on the right way.\"    \"Don't you see no reason why you can't do that?\"    \"Are you playing with me?\"    \"I'm talkin' to you as I'd talk to myself. If she's loose she'll  describe us all an' set the whole range on our trail.\"    Haines stared.    Silent went on: \"If we can't turn her loose, they's only one thing  left--an' that's to take her with us wherever we go.\"    \"On your honour, do you see no other way out?\"    \"Do you?\"    \"She may promise not to speak of it.\"    \"There ain't no way of changin' the spots of a leopard, Lee, an' there  ain't no way of keepin' a woman's tongue still.\"    \"How can we take a girl with us.\"    \"It ain't goin' to be for long. After we pull the job that comes on  the eighteenth, we'll blow farther south an' then we'll let her go.\"    \"And no harm will come to her while she's with us?\"    \"Here's my hand on it, Lee.\"    \"How can she ride with us?\"    \"She won't go as a woman. I've thought of that. I brought out a new  outfit for Purvis from Elkhead--trousers, chaps, shirts, an' all. He's  small. They'll near fit the girl.\"    \"There isn't any other way, Jim?\"    \"I leave it to you. God knows I don't want to drag any damn calico  aroun' with us.\"    As they went back towards their clearing they arranged the details.  Silent would take the men aside and explain his purpose to them.  Haines could inform the girl of what she must do. Just before they  reached the camp Silent stopped short and took Haines by the shoulder.    \"They's one thing I can't make out, Lee, an' that's how Whistlin' Dan  made his getaway. I'd of bet a thousand bones that he would be dropped  before he could touch his shootin' irons. An' then what happened? Hal  Purvis jest flashed a gun--and that feller shot it out'n his hand.  I never seen a draw like that. His hand jest seemed to twitch--I  couldn't follow the move he made--an' the next second his gun went  off.\"    He stared at Lee with a sort of fascinated horror.    \"Silent,\" said Haines, \"can you explain how the lightning comes down  out of the sky?\"    \"Of course not.\"    \"Then don't ask me to explain how Whistling Dan made his getaway. One  minute I heard him talkin' with the girl. The next second there was  two shots and when I whirled he was gone. But he'll come back, Jim.  We're not through with him. He slipped away from you and your men like  water out of a sieve, but we won't slip away from him the same way.\"    Silent stared on again with bowed head.    \"He liked the girl, Lee?\"    \"Any one could see that.\"    \"Then while she's with us he'll go pretty slow. Lee, that's another  reason why she's got to stay with us. My frien', it's time we was  moving out from the willows. The next time he comes up with us he  won't be numb in the head. He'll be thinkin' fast an' he'll be  shootin' a damn sight faster. We got two jobs ahead of us--first to  get that Wells Fargo shipment, and then to get Whistling Dan. There  ain't room enough in the whole world for him and me.\"          CHAPTER XVI      THE THREE OF US    In the clearing of Whistling Dan and Tex Calder the marshal had turned  into his blankets once more. There was no thought of sleep in Dan's  mind. When the heavy breathing of the sleeper began he rose and  commenced to pace up and down on the farther side of the open space.  Two pairs of glowing eyes followed him in every move. Black Bart, who  trailed him up and down during the first few turns he made, now sat  down and watched his master with a wistful gaze. The black stallion,  who lay more like a dog than a horse on the ground, kept his ears  pricked forwards, as if expecting some order. Once or twice he  whinnied very softly, and finally Dan sat down beside Satan, his  shoulders leaned against the satiny side and his arms flung out along  the stallion's back. Several times he felt hot breath against his  cheek as the horse turned a curious head towards him, but he paid no  attention, even when the stallion whinnied a question in his ear. In  his heart was a numb, strange feeling which made him weak. He was even  blind to the fact that Black Bart at last slipped into the shadows of  the willows.    Presently something cold touched his chin. He found himself staring  into the yellow-green eyes of Black Bart, who panted from his run, and  now dropped from his mouth something which fell into Dan's lap. It  was the glove of Kate Cumberland. In the grasp of his long nervous  fingers, how small it was!; and yet the hand which had wrinkled the  leather was strong enough to hold the heart of a man. He slipped and  caught the shaggy black head of Bart between his hands. The wolf  knew--in some mysterious way he knew!    The touch of sympathy unnerved him. All his sorrow and his weakness  burst on his soul in a single wave. A big tear struck the shining nose  of the wolf.    \"Bart!\" he whispered. \"Did you figger on plumb bustin' my heart, pal?\"    To avoid those large melancholy eyes, Bart pressed his head inside of  his master's arms.    \"Delilah!\" whispered "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10890"],[0,"Dio's Rome, Volume 5 (#19)"],[1,"parties in search of water and harass scattered detachments. Consequently  Titus stopped them all up.]    [Sidenote:--5--] In the course of these operations many on both sides were  wounded and killed. Titus himself was struck on the left shoulder by a  stone, and as a result of this accident the arm was always weaker. After a  time the Romans managed to scale the outside circle, and, pitching their  camps between the two encompassing lines of fortification, assaulted the  second wall. Here, however, they found the conditions confronting them to  be different. When all the inhabitants had retired behind the second wall,  its defence proved an easier matter because the circuit to be guarded was  so much less. Titus, accordingly, made anew a proclamation offering them  immunity. They, however, even under these circumstances held out. And the  captives and deserters from the enemy so far as they could do so  unobserved spoiled the Roman water supply and slew many men that they  could cut off from the main force, so that Titus refused to receive any of  them. Meantime some of the Romans, too, growing disheartened, as often  happens in a prolonged siege, and furthermore suspecting that the city was  really, even as report declared, impregnable, went over to the other side.  The Jews although they were short of food treated them kindly, in order to  be able to exhibit deserters to their own ranks.    [Sidenote:--6--] Though a breach in the wall was effected by engines,  still the capture did not immediately follow; the defenders killed great  numbers that tried to crowd through the opening. Next they set fire to  some of the buildings near by, expecting in this way to check the onward  progress of the Romans, even should the latter make themselves masters of  the entire circuit. In this way they damaged the wall and unintentionally  burned down the barrier encompassing their sacred precinct. The entrance  to the temple was now laid open to the Romans. The soldiers on account of  their superstition would not immediately rush in, but at last, as Titus  forced them, they made their way inside. Then the Jews carried on a  defence much more vigorous than before, as if they had discovered a rare  and unexpected privilege in falling near the temple, while fighting to  save it. The populace was stationed in the outer court, the senators on  the steps, and the priests in the hall of worship itself. And though they  were but a handful fighting against a far superior force they were not  subdued until a section of the temple was fired. Then they went to meet  death willingly, some letting themselves be pierced by the swords of the  Romans, some slaughtering one another, others committing suicide, and  others leaping into the blaze. It looked to everybody, and most of all to  them, apparently, [that so far from being ruin, it was victory and  salvation and happiness to perish along with the temple]. [Sidenote:--7--]  Even under these conditions many captives were taken, among them Bargiora,  [Footnote: Properly Simon Bar-Giora (patronymic).] the commander of the  enemy: he was the only one punished in the course of the triumphal  celebration.    Thus was Jerusalem destroyed on the very day of Saturn, which even now the  Jews reverence most. To commemorate the event it was ordered that the  conquered, while still preserving their own ancestral customs should  annually pay a tribute of two denarii to Capitoline Jupiter. As a reward  for this success both generals received the title of imperator, but  neither had that of _Iudaicus_, although all the other privileges  (including arches bearing trophies) that were proper after so great a  victory were voted to them.    [Sidenote:--8--] Hard upon Vespasian's entrance into Alexandria the Nile  overflowed, and rose in one day a palm higher than usual; indeed, such an  occurrence, it was said, had taken place only once before. Vespasian  himself healed two persons who had come to him because of a vision seen in  dreams. One of them, who had a weak hand, he cured by treading upon that  member, and the other one, who was blind, by spitting upon his eyes. His  divine power herein shown gave him great repute, yet the Alexandrians, far  from enjoying his society, detested him heartily; not only in private but  in public they were forever making fun of and abusing him. They had  expected to receive some great reward from him because they had taken the  first steps in making him emperor, but instead of securing anything they  had additional contributions levied upon them. Large were the sums he  gathered from them, for he omitted not a single source of revenue, no, not  even the first that might offer itself, though its character were  reprehensible, but he sought money from everybody alike, of secular or  religious profession. As for taxes, he renewed many that had been  abolished and increased those that were usual [and introduced still other  new ones]. And he adopted this same course later in the rest of the  subject territory, [in Italy] and in Rome itself. Hence the Alexandrians  [both for the reasons mentioned and because most of the royal possessions  had been sold were vexed and] threw out various derogatory remarks about  him, one of them being: \"You want six obols more.\" Vespasian,  consequently, although the most affable of men, became indignant and gave  orders that the six obols per man should be levied, and thought seriously  about taking vengeance upon them. [The words themselves contained an  insult, and of their many undignified and anapaestic rhythms there was not  a single one but aroused his anger.] Titus, however, begged them off and  Vespasian accordingly spared them. Yet they would not let him alone, and  in some assembly they all together shouted at Titus these very words: \"We  forgive him. He doesn't understand being Caesar.\"    So they continued to be foolhardy, took their thorough fill of that  license which is always working to their detriment, and abused the good  nature of the emperor. [Sidenote:--9--] Vespasian soon ceased to notice  them. He sent a despatch to Rome rescinding the disfranchisement of such  persons as had been condemned for so-called acts of maiestas by Nero and  succeeding rulers. His action included living and dead alike, and he  moreover stopped the indictments made upon such complaints.--The  astrologers he banished from Rome, yet he consulted all of them who were  distinguished, and through the influence of Barbillus, a man of that  profession, allowed the Ephesians to celebrate some sacred games. This was  a privilege he granted to no other city.    He soon had Egypt subdued and sent from there a large supply of grain to  Rome. He had left his son Titus at Jerusalem to sack the town, and awaited  its capture that he might return to Rome in his son's company. But, as  time dragged in the conduct of the siege, he left Titus in Palestine and  took passage himself on a merchantman; he sailed in this manner as far as  Lycia, and from that country partly by overland journeys and partly by  seafaring he came to Brundusium.    After this he came to Rome, meeting Mucianus and other prominent men at  Brundusium and Domitian at Beneventum. In consequence of the consciousness  of his own designs and of what he had already done, Domitian was ill at  ease, and moreover he occasionally feigned madness. He spent most of his  time on the Alban estate and did many ridiculous things, one of them being  to impale flies on pencils. Even though this incident be unworthy of the  dignity of history, yet because it shows his character so well and  particularly in view of the fact that he continued the same practice after  he became emperor, I have been obliged to record it. Hence that answer was  not without wit which some one made to a person who enquired what Domitian  was doing. \"He is living in retirement,\" he said, \"without so much as a  fly to keep him company.\" [Sidenote:--10--] Vespasian though he humbled  this upstart's pride greeted all the rest not like an emperor but like a  private person, for he remembered his previous experience.    On reaching Rome he bestowed gifts upon both soldiers and populace; he  made repairs in the sacred precincts and upon those public works which  showed signs of wear and tear; such as had already crumbled to decay he  restored; and when they were completed he inscribed upon them not his own  name but the names of the persons who had originally reared them.    He immediately began to construct the temple on the Capitoline, being  himself the first to carry away some of the soil; and, as a matter of  course, he urged the other most prominent men to do this same thing in  order that the rest of the populace might have no excuse for shirking this  service.    The property of his opponents who had fallen in one conflict or another he  delivered to their children or to other kin of theirs; furthermore, he  destroyed contracts of long standing representing sums due and owing to  the public treasury.    Though he invariably expended in munificent fashion all that was requisite  for the public welfare and arranged the festivals on a most sumptuous  scale, his own living was very far from costly, and he sanctioned no  greater outlay than was absolutely necessary. Therefore even in the  taverns he allowed nothing cooked to be sold except pulse. Thus he made it  quite plainly evident that he was amassing riches not for his own  enjoyment but for the needs of the people.    Vespasian got laughed at every time that he would say, when spending  money: \"I am making this outlay from my own purse.\"    He was neither of noble family nor rich.    The general routine of life that he followed was this. He lived but little  in the palace, spending most of his time in the so-called Sallustian  Gardens. There he received anybody who desired to see him, not only  senators but people in general. With his intimate friends he would  converse "]]]
