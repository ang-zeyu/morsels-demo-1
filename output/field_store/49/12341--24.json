I looked at the little  dust-heap that had once been Pepper. Hours! and I laughed, a feeble,  bitter laugh; a shrill, cackling laugh, that shocked my dimming senses.    For a while, I must have dozed. Then I opened my eyes, with a start.  Somewhere across the room, there had been a muffled noise of something  falling. I looked, and saw, vaguely, a cloud of dust hovering above a  pile of _debris_. Nearer the door, something else tumbled, with a crash.  It was one of the cupboards; but I was tired, and took little notice. I  closed my eyes, and sat there in a state of drowsy, semi-unconsciousness.  Once or twice--as though coming through thick mists--I heard noises,  faintly. Then I must have slept.        _XVI_    THE AWAKENING    I awoke, with a start. For a moment, I wondered where I was. Then  memory came to me....    The room was still lit with that strange light--half-sun, half-moon,  light. I felt refreshed, and the tired, weary ache had left me. I went  slowly across to the window, and looked out. Overhead, the river of  flame drove up and down, North and South, in a dancing semi-circle of  fire. As a mighty sleigh in the loom of time it seemed--in a sudden  fancy of mine--to be beating home the picks of the years. For, so vastly  had the passage of time been accelerated, that there was no longer any  sense of the sun passing from East to West. The only apparent movement  was the North and South beat of the sun-stream, that had become so swift  now, as to be better described as a _quiver_.    As I peered out, there came to me a sudden, inconsequent memory of that  last journey among the Outer worlds. I remembered the sudden vision that  had come to me, as I neared the Solar System, of the fast whirling  planets about the sun--as though the governing quality of time had been  held in abeyance, and the Machine of a Universe allowed to run down an  eternity, in a few moments or hours. The memory passed, along with a,  but partially comprehended, suggestion that I had been permitted a  glimpse into further time spaces. I stared out again, seemingly, at the  quake of the sun-stream. The speed seemed to increase, even as I looked.  Several lifetimes came and went, as I watched.    Suddenly, it struck me, with a sort of grotesque seriousness, that I  was still alive. I thought of Pepper, and wondered how it was that I had  not followed his fate. He had reached the time of his dying, and had  passed, probably through sheer length of years. And here was I, alive,  hundreds of thousands of centuries after my rightful period of years.    For, a time, I mused, absently. 'Yesterday--' I stopped, suddenly.  Yesterday! There was no yesterday. The yesterday of which I spoke had  been swallowed up in the abyss of years, ages gone. I grew dazed with  much thinking.    Presently, I turned from the window, and glanced 'round the room. It  seemed different--strangely, utterly different. Then, I knew what it was  that made it appear so strange. It was bare: there was not a piece of  furniture in the room; not even a solitary fitting of any sort.  Gradually, my amazement went, as I remembered, that this was but the  inevitable end of that process of decay, which I had witnessed  commencing, before my sleep. Thousands of years! Millions of years!    Over the floor was spread a deep layer of dust, that reached half way  up to the window-seat. It had grown immeasurably, whilst I slept; and  represented the dust of untold ages. Undoubtedly, atoms of the old,  decayed furniture helped to swell its bulk; and, somewhere among it all,  mouldered the long-ago-dead Pepper.    All at once, it occurred to me, that I had no recollection of wading  knee-deep through all that dust, after I awoke. True, an incredible age  of years had passed, since I approached the window; but that was  evidently as nothing, compared with the countless spaces of time that, I  conceived, had vanished whilst I was sleeping. I remembered now, that I  had fallen asleep, sitting in my old chair. Had it gone ...? I glanced  toward where it had stood. Of course, there was no chair to be seen. I  could not satisfy myself, whether it had disappeared, after my waking,  or before. If it had mouldered under me, surely, I should have been  waked by the collapse. Then I remembered that the thick dust, which  covered the floor, would have been sufficient to soften my fall; so that  it was quite possible, I had slept upon the dust for a million years  or more.    As these thoughts wandered through my brain, I glanced again, casually,  to where the chair had stood. Then, for the first time, I noticed that  there were no marks, in the dust, of my footprints, between it and the  window. But then, ages of years had passed, since I had awaked--tens of  thousands of years!    My look rested thoughtfully, again upon the place where once had stood  my chair. Suddenly, I passed from abstraction to intentness; for there,  in its standing place, I made out a long undulation, rounded off with  the heavy dust. Yet it was not so much hidden, but that I could tell  what had caused it. I knew--and shivered at the knowledge--that it was a  human body, ages-dead, lying there, beneath the place where I had slept.  It was lying on its right side, its back turned toward me. I could make  out and trace each curve and outline, softened, and moulded, as it were,  in the black dust. In a vague sort of way, I tried to account for its  presence there. Slowly, I began to grow bewildered, as the thought came  to me that it lay just about where I must have fallen when the chair  collapsed.    Gradually, an idea began to form itself within my brain; a thought that  shook my spirit. It seemed hideous and insupportable; yet it grew upon  me, steadily, until it became a conviction. The body under that coating,  that shroud of dust, was neither more nor less than my own dead shell. I  did not attempt to prove it. I knew it now, and wondered I had not known  it all along. I was a bodiless thing.    Awhile, I stood, trying to adjust my thoughts to this new problem. In  time--how many thousands of years, I know not--I attained to some degree  of quietude--sufficient to enable me to pay attention to what was  transpiring around me.    Now, I saw that the elongated mound had sunk, collapsed, level with the  rest of the spreading dust. And fresh atoms, impalpable, had settled  above that mixture of grave-powder, which the aeons had ground. A long  while, I stood, turned from the window. Gradually, I grew more  collected, while the world slipped across the centuries into the future.    Presently, I began a survey of the room. Now, I saw that time was  beginning its destructive work, even on this strange old building. That  it had stood through all the years was, it seemed to me, proof that it  was something different from any other house. I do not think, somehow,  that I had thought of its decaying. Though, why, I could not have said.  It was not until I had meditated upon the matter, for some considerable  time, that I fully realized that the extraordinary space of time through  which it had stood, was sufficient to have utterly pulverized the very  stones of which it was built, had they been taken from any earthly  quarry. Yes, it was undoubtedly mouldering now. All the plaster had gone  from the walls; even as the woodwork of the room had gone, many  ages before.    While I stood, in contemplation, a piece of glass, from one of the  small, diamond-shaped panes, dropped, with a dull tap, amid the dust  upon the sill behind me, and crumbled into a little heap of powder. As I  turned from contemplating it, I saw light between a couple of the stones  that formed the outer wall. Evidently, the mortar was falling away....    After awhile, I turned once more to the window, and peered out. I  discovered, now, that the speed of time had become enormous. The lateral  quiver of the sun-stream, had grown so swift as to cause the dancing  semi-circle of flame to merge into, and disappear in, a sheet of fire  that covered half the Southern sky from East to West.    From the sky, I glanced down to the gardens. They were just a blur of a  palish, dirty green. I had a feeling that they stood higher, than in the  old days; a feeling that they were nearer my window, as though they had  risen, bodily. Yet, they were still a long way below me; for the rock,  over the mouth of the pit, on which this house stands, arches up to a  great height.    It was later, that I noticed a change in the constant color of the  gardens. The pale, dirty green was growing ever paler and paler, toward  white. At last, after a great space, they became greyish-white, and  stayed thus for a very long time. Finally, however, the greyness began  to fade, even as had the green, into a dead white. And this remained,  constant and unchanged. And by this I knew that, at last, snow lay upon  all the Northern world.    And so, by millions of years, time winged onward through eternity, to  the end--the end, of which, in the old-earth days, I had thought  remotely, and in hazily speculative fashion. And now, it was approaching  in a manner of which none had ever dreamed.    I recollect that, about this time, I began to have a lively, though  morbid, curiosity, as to what would happen when the end came--but I  seemed strangely without imaginings.    All this while, the steady process of decay was continuing. The few  remaining pieces of glass, had long ago vanished; and, every now and  then, a soft thud, and a little cloud of rising dust, would tell of some  fragment of fallen mortar or stone.    I looked up again, to the fiery sheet that quaked in the heavens above  me and far down into the Southern sky. As I looked, the impression was  borne in upon me, that it had lost some of its first brilliancy--that it  was duller, deeper hued.    I glanced down, once more, to the blurred white "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10023"],[0,"There's Pippins and Cheese to Come (#19)"],[1,"said. \"It crackles and spits.\" He  ranged the peel upon the log where the flame would get it, and then settled  himself in the big chair.    \"Perhaps you smoke?\" I asked, pushing toward him a box of cigarettes.    He smiled. \"I thought that you would know my habits. I don't smoke.\"    \"So you were going by and came up to see me?\" I asked.    \"Yes. I was not sure that I would know you. You are a little older than I  thought, a little--stouter, but dear me, how you have lost your hair! But  you have quite forgotten me.\"    \"My dear boy,\" I said, \"you have the advantage of me. Where have I seen  you? There is something familiar about you and I am sure that I have seen  that brown suit before.\"    \"We have never really known each other,\" the boy replied. \"We met once, but  only for an instant. But I have thought of you since that meeting a great  many times. I lay this afternoon on a hilltop and wondered what you would  be like. But I hoped that sometimes you would think of me. Perhaps you have  forgotten that I used to collect railway maps and time-tables.\"    \"Did you?\" I replied. \"So did I when I was a little younger than you are.  Perhaps if I might see your face, I would know you.\"    \"It's nothing for show,\" he replied, and he kept it still in shadow. \"Would  you mind,\" he said at length, \"if I ate an apple?\" He took one from his  pocket and broke it in his hands. \"You eat half,\" he said.    I accepted the part he offered me. \"Perhaps you would like a knife and  plate,\" I said. \"I can find them in the pantry.\"    \"Not for me,\" he replied. \"I prefer to eat mine this way.\" He took an  enveloping bite.    \"I myself care nothing for plates,\" I said. We ate in silence. Presently:  \"You have my habit,\" I said, \"of eating everything, skin, seeds and all.\"    \"Everything but the stem,\" he replied.    By this time the orange peel was hissing and exploding.    \"You are an odd boy,\" I said. \"I used to put orange peel away to dry in  order to burn it. We seem to be as like as two peas.\"    \"I wonder,\" he said, \"if that is so.\" He turned in his chair and faced me,  although his face was still in shadow. \"Doubtless, we are far different in  many things. Do you swallow grape seeds?\"    \"Hardly!\" I cried. \"I spit them out.\"    \"I am glad of that.\" He paused. \"It was a breezy hilltop where I lay. I  thought of you all afternoon. You are famous, of course?\"    \"Dear me, no!\"    \"Oh, I'm so sorry. I had hoped you might be. I had counted on it. It is  very disappointing. I was thinking about that as I lay on the hill. But  aren't you just on the point of doing something that will make you famous?\"    \"By no means.\"    \"Dear me, I am so sorry. Do you happen to be married?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"And would you mind telling me her name?\"    I obliged him.    \"I don't remember to have heard of her. I didn't think of that name once  as I lay upon the hill. Things don't turn out as one might expect. Now, I  would have thought--but it's no matter.\"    For a moment or so he was lost in thought, and then he spoke again: \"You  were writing when I came into the room?\"    \"Nothing important.\"    The boy ran his fingers in his hair and threw out his arms impatiently.  \"That's what I would like to do. I am in college, and I try for one of the  papers. But my stuff comes back. But this summer in the vacation, I am  working in an office. I run errands and when there is nothing else to do, I  study a big invoice book, so as to get the names of things that are bought.  There is a racket of drays and wagons outside the windows, and along in  the middle of the afternoon I get tired and thick in my head. But I write  Saturday afternoons and Sunday mornings.\"    The boy stopped and fixed his eyes on me. \"I don't suppose that you happen  to be a poet?\"    \"Not at all,\" I replied. \"But perhaps you are one. Tell me about it!\"    The boy took a turn at the fire with the poker, but it was chiefly in  embarrassment. Presently he returned to his chair. He stretched his long  arms upward above his head.    \"No, I'm not,\" he said. \"And yet sometimes I think that I have a kind of  poetry in me. Only I can't get it into words. I lay thinking about that,  too, on the hillside. There was a wind above my head, and I thought that I  could almost put words to the tune. But I have never written a single poem.  Yet, goodness me, what thoughts I have! But they aren't real thoughts--what  you would regularly call thoughts. Things go racing and tingling in my  head, but I can never get them down. They are just feelings.\"    As he spoke, the boy gazed intently through the chimney bricks out into  another world. The fireplace was its portal and he seemed to wait for the  fires to cool before entering into its possession. It was several moments  before he spoke again.    \"I don't want you to think me ridiculous, but so few understand. If only I  could master the tools! Perhaps my thoughts are old, but they come to me  with such freshness and they are so unexpected. Could I only solve the  frets and spaces inside me here, I could play what tune I chose. But my  feelings are cold and stale before I can get them into thoughts. I have no  doubt, however, that they are just as real as those other feelings that in  time, after much scratching, get into final form and become poetry. I  know of course that a man's reach should exceed his grasp--it's hackneyed  enough--but just for once I would like to pull down something when I have  been up on tiptoe for a while.    \"Sometimes I get an impression of pity--a glance up a dark hallway--an old  woman with a shawl upon her head--a white face at a window--a blind fiddler  in the street--but the impression is gone in a moment. Or a touch of beauty  gets me. It may be nothing but a street organ in the spring. Perhaps you  like street organs, too?\"    \"I do, indeed!\" I cried. \"There was one today outside my window and my feet  kept wiggling to it.\"    The boy clapped his hands. \"I knew that you would be like that. I hoped for  it on the hill. As for me, when I hear one, I'm so glad that I could cry  out. In its lilt there is the rhythm of life. It moves me more than a  hillside with its earliest flowers. Am I absurd? It is equal to the pipe of  birds, to shallow waters and the sound of wind to stir me to thoughts of  April. Today as I came downtown, I saw several merry fellows dancing on  the curb. There are tunes, too, upon the piano that send me off. I play a  little myself. I see you have a piano. Do you still play?\"    \"A little, rather sadly,\" I replied.    \"That's too bad, but perhaps you sing?\"    \"Even worse.\"    \"Dear me, that's too bad. I have rather a voice myself. Well, as I was  saying, when I hear those tunes, I curl up with the smoke and blow forth  from the chimney. If I walk upon the street when the wind is up, and see a  light fleece of smoke coming from a chimney top, I think that down below  someone is listening to music that he likes, and that his thoughts ride  upon the night, like those white streamers of smoke. And then I think of  castles and mountains and high places and the sounds of storm. Or in fancy  I see a tower that tapers to the moon with a silver gleam upon it.\"    The strange boy lay back and laughed. \"Musicians think that they are the  only ones that can hear the finer sounds. If one of us common fellows cocks  his ear, they think that only the coarser thumps get inside. And artists  think that they alone know the glory of color. I was thinking of that, this  afternoon. And yet I have walked under the blue sky. I have seen twilights  that these men of paint would botch on canvas. But both musicians and  artists have a vision that is greater than their product. The soul of a man  can hardly be recorded in black and white keys. Nor can a little pigment  which you rub upon your thumb be the measure of an artist. So I suppose  that is the way also with poets. It is not to be expected that they can  express themselves fully in words that they have borrowed from the kitchen.  When their genius flames up, it is only the lesser sparks that fall upon  their writing pads. It consoles me that a man should be greater than his  achievement. I who have done so little would otherwise be so forlorn.\"    \"It's odd,\" I said, when he had fallen into silence, \"that I used to feel  exactly as you do. It stirs an old recollection. If I am not mistaken, I  once wrote a paper on the subject.\"    The boy smiled dreamily. \"But if small persons like myself,\" he began, \"can  have such frenzies, how must it be with those greater persons who have  amazed the world? I have wondered in what kind of exaltation Shakespeare  wrote his storm in 'Lear.' There must have been a first conception greater  even than his accomplishment. Did he look from his windows at a winter  tempest and see miserable old men and women running hard for shelter? Did  a flash of lightning bare his soul to the misery, the betrayal and the  madness of the world? His supreme moment was not when he flung the  completed manuscript aside, or when he heard the actors mouth his lines,  but in the flash and throb of creation--in the moment when he knew that he  had the power in him to write 'Lear.' What we read is the cold forging,  wonderful and enduring, but not to be compared to the producing furnace.\"    The boy had spoken so fast that he was out of breath.    \"Hold a bit!\" I cried. \"What you have said sounds familiar. Where could I  have heard it before?\"    There was something almost like a sneer on the boy's face. \"What a memory  you have! And perhaps you recall this brown suit, too. It's ugly enough to  be remembered. Now please let me finish what came to me this afternoon on  the hill! Prometheus,\" he continued, \"scaled the heavens and brought back  fire to mortals. And he, as the story goes, clutched at a lightning bolt  and caught but a spark. And even that, glorious. Mankind properly accredits  him with a marvellous achievement. It is for this reason that I"]]]
