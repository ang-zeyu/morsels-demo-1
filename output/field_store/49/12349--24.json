[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10201"],[0,"The Desert of Wheat (#19)"],[1,", Chris Dorn, is in town. Can you tell me where I'll find  him?\"    \"So you're young Dorn,\" replied the other, with instant change to  friendliness. \"I've heard of you. Yes, the old man is here. He made a  big wheat deal to-day. He's eating his supper.\"    Kurt stepped to the door indicated, and, looking into the dining-room,  he at once espied his father's huge head with its shock of gray hair. He  appeared to be in earnest colloquy with a man whose bulk matched his  own. Kurt hesitated, and finally went back to the desk.    \"Who's the big man with my father?\" he asked.    \"He is a big man, both ways. Don't you know him?\" rejoined the  proprietor, in a lower voice.    \"I'm not sure,\" answered Kurt. The lowered tone had a significance that  decided Kurt to admit nothing.    \"That's Neuman from Ruxton, one of the biggest wheat men in Washington.\"    Kurt repressed a whistle of surprise. Neuman was Anderson's only rival  in the great, fertile valley. What were Neuman and Chris Dorn doing with  their heads together?    \"I thought he was Neuman,\" replied Kurt, feeling his way. \"Is he in on  the big deal with father?\"    \"Which one?\" queried the proprietor, with shrewd eyes, taking Kurt's  measure. \"You're in on both, of course.\"    \"Sure. I mean the wheat sale, not the I.W.W. deal,\" replied Kurt. He  hazarded a guess with that mention of the I.W.W. No sooner had the words  passed his lips than he divined he was on the track of sinister events.    \"Your father sold out to that Spokane miller. No, Neuman is not in on  that.\"    \"I was surprised to hear father had sold the wheat. Was it speculation  or guarantee?\"    \"Old Chris guaranteed sixty bushels. There were friends of his here who  advised against it. Did you have rain over there?\"    \"Fine. The wheat will go over sixty bushels. I'm sorry I couldn't get  here sooner.\"    \"When it rained you hurried over to boost the price. Well, it's too  late.\"    \"Is Glidden here?\" queried Kurt, hazarding another guess.    \"Don't talk so loud,\" warned the proprietor. \"Yes, he just got here in a  car with two other men. He's up-stairs having supper in his room.\"    \"Supper!\" Kurt echoed the word, and averted his face to hide the leap of  his blood. \"That reminds me, I'm hungry.\"    He went into the big, dimly lighted dining-room. There was a shelf on  one side as he went in, and here, with his back turned to the room, he  laid the disjointed gun and his hat. Several newspapers lying near  attracted his eye. Quickly he slipped them under and around the gun, and  then took a seat at the nearest table. A buxom German waitress came for  his order. He gave it while he gazed around at his grim-faced old father  and the burly Neuman, and his ears throbbed to the beat of his blood.  His hand trembled on the table. His thoughts flashed almost too swiftly  for comprehension. It took a stern effort to gain self-control.    Evil of some nature was afoot. Neuman's presence there was a strange,  disturbing fact. Kurt had made two guesses, both alarmingly correct. If  he had any more illusions or hopes, he dispelled them. His father had  been won over by this arch conspirator of the I.W.W. And, despite his  father's close-fistedness where money was concerned, that eighty  thousand dollars, or part of it, was in danger.    Kurt wondered how he could get possession of it. If he could he would  return it to the bank and wire a warning to the Spokane buyer that the  wheat was not safe. He might persuade his father to turn over the amount  of the debt to Anderson. While thinking and planning, Kurt kept an eye  on his father and rather neglected his supper. Presently, when old Dorn  and Neuman rose and left the dining-room, Kurt followed them. His father  was whispering to the proprietor over the desk, and at Kurt's touch he  glared his astonishment.    \"You here! What for?\" he demanded, gruffly, in German.    \"I had to see you,\" replied Kurt, in English.    \"Did it rain?\" was the old man's second demand, husky and serious.    \"The wheat is made, if we can harvest it,\" answered Kurt.    The blaze of joy on old Dorn's face gave Kurt a twinge of pain. He hated  to dispel it. \"Come aside, here, a minute,\" he whispered, and drew his  father over to a corner under a lamp. \"I've got bad news. Look at this!\"  He produced the cake of phosphorus, careful to hide it from other  curious eyes there, and with swift, low words he explained its meaning.  He expected an outburst of surprise and fury, but he was mistaken.    \"I know about that,\" whispered his father, hoarsely. \"There won't be any  thrown in my wheat.\"    \"Father! What assurance have you of that?\" queried Kurt, astounded.    The old man nodded his gray head wisely. He knew, but he did not speak.    \"Do you think these I.W.W. plotters will spare your wheat?\" asked Kurt.  \"You are wrong. They may lie to your face. But they'll betray you. The  I.W.W. is backed by--by interests that want to embarrass the  government.\"    \"What government?\"    \"Why, ours--the U.S. government!\"    \"That's not my government. The more it's embarrassed the better it will  suit me.\"    In the stress of the moment Kurt had forgotten his father's bitter and  unchangeable hatred.    \"But you're--you're stupid,\" he hissed, passionately. \"That government  has protected you for fifty years.\"    Old Dorn growled into his beard. His huge ox-eyes rolled. Kurt realized  then finally how implacable and hopeless he was--how utterly German.  Then Kurt importuned him to return the eighty thousand dollars to the  bank until he was sure the wheat was harvested and hauled to the  railroad.    \"My wheat won't burn,\" was old Dorn's stubborn reply.    \"Well, then, give me Anderson's thirty thousand. I'll take it to him at  once. Our debt will be paid. We'll have it off our minds.\"    \"No hurry about that,\" replied his father.    \"But there is hurry,\" returned Kurt, in a hot whisper. \"Anderson came to  see you to-day. He wants his money.\"    \"Neuman holds the small end of that debt. I'll pay him. Anderson can  wait.\"    Kurt felt no amaze. He expected anything. But he could scarcely contain  his fury. How this old man, his father, whom he had loved--how he had  responded to the influences that must destroy him!    \"Anderson shall not wait,\" declared Kurt. \"I've got some say in this  matter. I've worked like a dog in those wheat-fields. I've a right to  demand Anderson's money. He needs it. He has a tremendous harvest on his  hands.\"    Old Dorn shook his huge head in somber and gloomy thought. His broad  face, his deep eyes, seemed to mask and to hide. It was an expression  Kurt had seldom seen there, but had always hated. It seemed so old to  Kurt, that alien look, something not born of his time.    \"Anderson is a capitalist,\" said Chris Dorn, deep in his beard. \"He  seeks control of farmers and wheat in the Northwest. Ranch after ranch  he's gained by taking up and foreclosing mortgages. He's against labor.  He grinds down the poor. He cheated Neuman out of a hundred thousand  bushels of wheat. He bought up my debt. He meant to ruin me. He--\"    \"You're talking I.W.W. rot,\" whispered Kurt, shaking with the effort to  subdue his feelings. \"Anderson is fine, big, square--a developer of the  Northwest. Not an enemy! He's our friend. Oh! if only you had an  American's eyes, just for a minute!... Father, I want that money for  Anderson.\"    \"My son, I run my own business,\" replied Dorn, sullenly, with a pale  fire in his opaque eyes. \"You're a wild boy, unfaithful to your blood.  You've fallen in love with an American girl.... Anderson says he needs  money!\"... With hard, gloomy face the old man shook his head. \"He thinks  he'll harvest!\" Again that strange shake of finality. \"I know what I  know.... I keep my money.... We'll have other rule.... I keep my money.\"    Kurt had vibrated to those most significant words and he stared  speechless at his father.    \"Go home. Get ready for harvest,\" suddenly ordered old Dorn, as if he  had just awakened to the fact of Kurt's disobedience in lingering here.    \"All right, father,\" replied Kurt, and, turning on his heel, he strode  outdoors.    When he got beyond the light he turned and went back to a position where  in the dark he could watch without being seen. His father and the hotel  proprietor were again engaged in earnest colloquy. Neuman had  disappeared. Kurt saw the huge shadow of a man pass across a drawn blind  in a room up-stairs. Then he saw smaller shadows, and arms raised in  vehement gesticulation. The very shadows were sinister. Men passed in  and out of the hotel. Once old Dorn came to the door and peered all  around. Kurt observed that there was a dark side entrance to this hotel.  Presently Neuman returned to the desk and said something to old Dorn,  who shook his head emphatically, and then threw himself into a chair, in  a brooding posture that Kurt knew well. He had seen it so often that he  knew it had to do with money. His father was refusing demands of some  kind. Neuman again left the office, this time with the proprietor. They  were absent some little time.    During this period Kurt leaned against a tree, hidden in the shadow,  with keen eyes watching and with puzzled, anxious mind. He had  determined, in case his father left that office with Neuman, on one of  those significant disappearances, to slip into the hotel at the side  entrance and go up-stairs to listen at the door of the room with the  closely drawn blind. Neuman returned soon with the hotel man, and the  two of them half led, half dragged old Dorn out into the street. They  took the direction toward the railroad. Kurt followed at a safe distance  on the opposite side of the street. Soon they passed the stores with  lighted windows, then several dark houses, and at length the railroad  station. Perhaps they were bound for the train. Kurt heard rumbling in  the distance. But they went beyond the station, across the track, and  turned to the right.    Kurt was soft-"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10251"],[0,"Town Geology (#19)"],[1,"flour-bag with all the pannikins, gourds, and other hollow articles   it could muster, each of course with a due quantity of water from the   creek therein, and the chief began dealing out the flour by handfuls,   beginning of course with the boldest warriors.  But, horror of   horrors, each man's porridge swelled before his eyes, grew hot,   smoked, boiled over.  They turned and fled, man, woman, and child,   from before that supernatural prodigy; and the settlers coming back   to look for the dropped sack, saw a sight which told the whole tale.    For the poor creatures, in their terror, had thrown away their pans   and calabashes, each filled with that which it was likely to contain,   seeing that the sack itself had contained, not flour, but quick-lime.    In memory of which comi-tragedy, that creek is called to this day,   \"Flour-bag Creek.\"    Now I take for granted that you are all more learned than these black   fellows, and know quick-lime from flour.  But still you are not bound   to know what quick-lime is.  Let me explain it to you.    Lime, properly speaking, is a metal, which goes among chemists by the   name of calcium.  But it is formed, as you all know, in the earth,   not as a metal, but as a stone, as chalk or limestone, which is a   carbonate of lime; that is, calcium combined with oxygen and   carbonic-acid gases.    In that state it will make, if it is crystalline and hard, excellent   building stone.  The finest white marble, like that of Carrara in   Italy, of which the most delicate statues are carved, is carbonate of   lime altered and hardened by volcanic heat.  But to make mortar of   it, it must be softened and then brought into a state in which it can   be hardened again; and ages since, some man or other, who deserves to   rank as one of the great inventors, one of the great benefactors of   his race, discovered the art of making lime soft and hard again; in   fact of making mortar.  The discovery was probably very ancient; and   made, probably like most of the old discoveries, in the East,   spreading Westward gradually.  The earlier Greek buildings are   cyclopean, that is, of stone fitted together without mortar.  The   earlier Egyptian buildings, though the stones are exquisitely squared   and polished, are put together likewise without mortar.  So, long   ages after, were the earlier Roman buildings, and even some of the   later.  The famous aqueduct of the Pont du Gard, near Nismes, in the   south of France, has, if I recollect right, no mortar whatever in it.    The stones of its noble double tier of circular arches have been   dropped into their places upon the wooden centres, and stand unmoved   to this day, simply by the jamming of their own weight; a miracle of   art.  But the fact is puzzling; for these Romans were the best mortar   makers of the world.  We cannot, I believe, surpass them in the art   even now; and in some of their old castles, the mortar is actually to   this day harder and tougher than the stones which it holds together.    And they had plenty of lime at hand if they had chosen to make   mortar.  The Pont du Gard crosses a limestone ravine, and is itself   built of limestone.  But I presume the cunning Romans would not trust   mortar made from that coarse Nummulite limestone, filled with gritty   sand, and preferred, with their usual carefulness, no mortar at all   to bad.    But I must return, and tell my readers, in a few words, the chemical   history of mortar.  If limestone be burnt, or rather roasted, in a   kiln, the carbonic acid is given off--as you may discover by your own   nose; as many a poor tramp has discovered too late, when, on a cold   winter night, he has lain down by the side of the burning kiln to   keep himself warm, and woke in the other world, stifled to death by   the poisonous fumes.    The lime then gives off its carbonic acid, and also its water of   crystallisation, that is, water which it holds (as do many rocks)   locked up in it unseen, and only to be discovered by chemical   analysis.  It is then anhydrous--that is, waterless--oxide of lime,   what we call quick-lime; that which figured in the comi-tragedy of   \"Flour-bag Creek;\" and then, as you may find if you get it under your   nails or into your eyes, will burn and blister like an acid.    This has to be turned again into a hard and tough artificial   limestone, in plain words, into mortar; and the first step is to   slack it--that is, to give it back the water which it has lost, and   for which it is as it were thirsting.  So it is slacked with water,   which it drinks in, heating itself and the water till it steams and   swells in bulk, because it takes the substance of the water into its   own substance.  Slacked lime, as we all know, is not visibly wetter   than quick-lime; it crumbles to a dry white powder in spite of all   the water which it contains.    Then it must be made to set, that is, to return to limestone, to   carbonate of lime, by drinking in the carbonic acid from water and   air, which some sorts of lime will do instantly, setting at once, and   being therefore used as cements.  But the lime usually employed must   be mixed with more or less sand to make it set hard:  a mysterious   process, of which it will be enough to tell the reader that the sand   and lime are said to unite gradually, not only mechanically, that is,   by sticking together; but also in part chemically--that is, by   forming out of themselves a new substance, which is called silicate   of lime.    Be that as it may, the mortar paste has now to do two things; first   to dry, and next to take up carbonic acid from the air and water,   enough to harden it again into limestone:  and that it will take some   time in doing.  A thick wall, I am informed, requires several years   before it is set throughout, and has acquired its full hardness, or   rather toughness; and good mortar, as is well known, will acquire   extreme hardness with age, probably from the very same cause that it   did when it was limestone in the earth.  For, as a general rule, the   more ancient the strata is in which the limestone is found, the   harder the limestone is; except in cases where volcanic action and   earthquake pressure have hardened limestone in more recent strata, as   in the case of the white marbles of Carrara in Italy, which are of   the age of our Oolites, that is, of the freestone of Bath, etc.,   hardened by the heat of intruded volcanic rocks.    But now:  what is the limestone? and how did it get where it is--not   into the mortar, I mean, but into the limestone quarry?  Let me tell   you, or rather, help you to tell yourselves, by leading you, as   before, from the known to the unknown.  Let me lead you to places   unknown indeed to most; but there may be sailors or soldiers among my   readers who know them far better than I do.  Let me lead you, in   fancy, to some island in the Tropic seas.  After all, I am not   leading you as far away as you fancy by several thousand miles, as   you will see, I trust, ere I have done.    Let me take you to some island:  what shall it be like?  Shall it be   a high island, with cliff piled on cliff, and peak on peak, all rich   with mighty forests, like a furred mantle of green velvet, mounting   up and up till it is lost among white clouds above?  Or shall it be a   mere low reef, which you do not see till you are close upon it; on   which nothing rises above the water, but here and there a knot of   cocoa-nut palms or a block of stone, or a few bushes, swarming with   innumerable sea-fowl and their eggs?  Let it be which you will:  both   are strange enough; both beautiful; both will tell us a story.    The ship will have to lie-to, and anchor if she can; it may be a   mile, it may be only a few yards, from the land.  For between it and   the land will be a line of breakers, raging in before the warm trade-  wind.  And this, you will be told, marks the edge of the coral reef.    You will have to go ashore in a boat, over a sea which looks   unfathomable, and which may be a mile or more in depth, and search   for an opening in the reef, through which the boat can pass without   being knocked to pieces.    You find one:  and in a moment, what a change!  The deep has suddenly   become shallow; the blue white, from the gleam of the white coral at   the bottom.  But the coral is not all white, only indeed a little of   it; for as you look down through the clear water, you find that the   coral is starred with innumerable live flowers, blue, crimson, grey,   every conceivable hue; and that these are the coral polypes, each   with its ring of arms thrust out of its cell, who are building up   their common habitations of lime.  If you want to understand, by a   rough but correct description, what a coral polype is:  all who have   been to the sea-side know, or at least have heard of, sea-anemones.    Now coral polypes are sea-anemones, which make each a shell of lime,   growing with its growth.  As for their shapes, the variety of them,   the beauty of them, no tongue can describe them.  If you want to see   them, go to the Coral Rooms of the British or Liverpool Museums, and   judge for yourselves.  Only remember that you must re-clothe each of   those exquisite forms with a coating of live jelly of some delicate   hue, and put back into every one of the thousand cells its living   flower; and into the beds, or rather banks, of the salt-water flower   garden, the gaudiest of shell-less sea-anemones, such as we have on   our coasts, rooted in the cracks, and live shells and sea-slugs, as   gaudy as they, crawling about, with fifty other forms of fantastic   and exuberant life.  You must not overlook, too, the fish, especially   the parrot-fish, some of them of the gaudiest colours, who spend   their lives in browsing on the live coral, with strong clipping and   grinding teeth, just as a cow browses the grass, keeping the animal   matter, and "]]]
