Bischoff, Voit, and Hermann have shown that water increases, not alone  the elimination of urine, but also of sodium chloride, phosphoric acid,  etc. Grigoriantz observed augmentation of disintegration when the  quantity of beverage exceeded forty-six to eighty ounces (\"1,400 to  2,400 cubic centimeters\") per diem. Oppenheim, Fraenkel, and Debove,  while believing water has but little influence upon the exchanges, admit  it certainly need not diminish the latter; and Debove and Flament, after  administering water in quantities varying from two to eight pints per  diem, concluded that urine was diminished below the former figure, while  above the latter it increased somewhat, being dependent upon the amount  ingested. It was on the strength of the foregoing that Lallemand  declared water to have no influence upon the exchanges.    The results claimed by Oppenheim, Debove, et al. were immediately  challenged--and it is now generally admitted, not without some  justice--by Germain See. It seems certain, to say the least, that water  taken during the repast does tend to augment the quantity and facilitate  the elimination of urine. Abundance of beverage, moreover, presents  other advantages, in that it facilitates digestion by reason of its  diluent action, a fact well worth bearing in mind when treating the  obese who are possessed of gouty diathesis, and whose kidneys are  accordingly encumbered with uric and oxalic acids. The foregoing  presents the ground upon which Germain See permits an abundance of  beverage; but he also expresses strong reservation as regards beer and  alcohol, either of which (more especially the former) tends to the  production of adipose. In his opinion, the only beverage of the  alcoholic class that is at all permissible, and then only for cases  suffering from fatty heart, is a little _liqueur_ or diluted wine.  Coffee and tea he commends highly, and recommends the ingestion of large  quantities at high temperature, both during the repasts and their  intervals. Coffee in large doses is undoubtedly a means of de-nutrition,  and so, too, in no less extent, is tea; both act vigorously owing to the  contained alkaloids, though, to be sure, they sometimes, at first, tend  to insomnia and palpitation, to which no attention need be paid,  however. The treatment outlined by See is:    1. A physiological regimen comprising four to five ounces of nitrogenous  principles as derived from eight to ten ounces animal muscle and  albuminates; three to six ounces of fat; eight to ten ounces of  hydrocarbons as yielded by ten to twelve ounces of sugar or starch food.    These proportions to be modified in such manner that the  musculo-albuminates shall not sensibly exceed the normal ratio, for meat  in excess itself furnishes fat during transformation. The fatty  substances of easy digestion may, without inconvenience, be utilized in  doses of two to three ounces. The hydrocarbons should be reduced to a  minimum. As for the herbaceous elements, they contain nothing nutritive.    2. Beverage, far from being suppressed, should be augmented, in order to  facilitate stomachal digestion and promote general nutrition, though  alcoholic liquids must be inhibited; likewise mineral waters, except,  perhaps, for occasional use. Both should be replaced by infusions of  coffee or tea, taken as hot as can be drank.    Henrich Kisch insists that any method which promises rapid and marked  decrease of adipose must, _per se_, be objectionable, even if not  positively injurious, since it tends to provoke general troubles of  nutrition. He suggests that first the fats and hydrocarbons be reduced  as little as possible; that a moderate mixed regimen is required,  containing a preponderance of albumen, small quantities of hydrocarbons  and gelatinous matters, with but very little fat. Certain fatty meats,  however, should be generally interdicted, such as pork sausage, smoked  beef tongue, goose breast, smoked ham, fat salmon, and herring in any  form. Eggs, however, may be partaken of in moderation, giving preference  to the albumen over the yelk. Farinaceous foods, in the main, should be  rejected, even bread being allowed only in small quantities, and then  preferably in the form of toast. Cheese likewise contains too much fat;  and mushrooms are so rich in hydrocarbons that they should be rejected.  Condiments, water, vegetable acids (vinegars excepted) may be permitted;  especially pernicious is vinegar where there is any tendency to gout or  gravel. All fatty beverages--_bouillon_, unskimmed milk, chocolate, or  cacao--and all alcoholics, are hurtful; breakfast tea is undoubtedly the  best beverage, but, after a little, is advantageously replaced by light  white wine diluted with water.    Kisch believes in a free and abundant use of water by the obese,  especially where there is a tendency to plethora, since this fluid  facilitates oxidation as the result of absorption; thus he advocates the  inhibition of large quantities of cold water by all, save those  presenting evidence of cardiac insufficiency. In short, his regimen is  based upon the administration of a large quantity of albumen, like that  of Harvey-Banting.    E. Munk recommends an almost identical dietary, save that he prefers  great moderation in fluids employed as beverage.    M. Robin has sought to harmonize the opposing views regarding fluids,  and therefore declares obesity arises from two distinct sources: 1.  Augmentation of assimilation. 2. Reduced disassimilation. In the former,  he insists water must be interdicted, while in the latter it may be  allowed _ad libitum_.    Again, in order to recognize the exact variety of obesity, he divides  his patients into three classes, each recognizable by the volume of urea  excreted. In the first there is an increase above normal; in the second  the volume of urea is stationary; in the third decreased, increased, or  stationary.    When the urea is stationary, which is most frequently the case, it is  necessary to calculate the coefficient of oxidation; that is, the  relation existing between the solid matters of the urine and the urea.  The elevation of the coefficient is _prima facie_ evidence the obesity  is due to excess of assimilation, while depression of the coefficient  indicates default of assimilation. In the first case, water and liquids  must be denied as far as possible, the same as if there was no  augmentation of urea; in the second, the same as if there was diminution  of urea, the patients may be permitted to imbibe fluids at pleasure.    For the obese from default of disassimilation, Robin recommends a  regimen of green vegetables and bread chiefly--the latter in small  quantities, however, and fluids as may be desired. By this means, on one  occasion, he was able in the course of one month to diminish the weight  of a female patient by twelve and a half pounds, her measurement around  the waist at the same time decreasing 5.2 inches and across the stomach  4.8 inches.    M. De St. Germain achieved good results by combining judicious exercise  with moderate alimentation, excluding wine and bread.    M. Dujardin Beaumetz, who professes to have given most close and careful  study and attention to regimen for the obese, outlines the following,  provided there is no evidence of fatty degeneration of heart.    _Breakfast_ (at 8 a. m.)--Three-fourths of an ounce of bread \"_en  flute_\"--that is abounding with crust; one and a half ounces of cold  meat, ham or beef, six ounces weak black tea, _sans_ sugar.    _Lunch_ (at 1 p.m.)--An ounce and a half to two ounces of bread, or a  _ragout_, or two eggs; three ounces green vegetables; one-half ounce of  cheese; fruits at discretion.    _Dinner_ (at 7 p.m.)--An ounce and a half to two ounces of bread; three  to four ounces of meat, or _ragout_; ditto of green vegetables, salad,  half an ounce of cheese, fruit _ad libitum_.    At meal times the patient may take only a \"glass and a half\" of  liquid--approximately ten ounces--though a greater amount may be  permitted if he abstains during the intervals.    Special alimentary regimen, however, does not constitute the sole  treatment of obesity. Concurrently must be employed a number of  practical adjuvants which are oftentimes of the utmost assistance. For  one thing, exercise is indispensable; all authorities agree on this  point. The exercise taken in the gymnasium is one of the best, notably  the \"wall exercise,\" which is more particularly suited to those  afflicted with pendulous and protuberant abdomens as the result of  feebleness of the hypogastric muscles, to accumulation of fat under the  skin and in the omentum, and to dilation of the stomach and intestines.  In the \"wall exercise,\" the patient stands erect against an absolutely  straight and plumb wall, lifts his hands (carrying a weight) straight  over the head, and causes them to describe a semicircle forward. Zantz  particularly insists upon arm and leg exercise for the obese, especially  the former, since with the same amount of effort a larger amount of  oxygen is consumed than is possible by the latter.    However, of whatever character, the exercise should be continued to the  point of fatigue or dyspnoea--three thousand movements daily,  gradually increased to twenty-five thousand, if the system can bear it;  and under such conditions, not only is there consumption of  hydrocarbons, but there is provided a veritable greed for air that  augments waste. The experiments of Oertel indicate that loss of weight  due to fatiguing exercise arises more particularly from dehydration,  which is made good by absorption of the fluids employed as beverage; the  fluids are claimed by Germain See to act as accelerants of oxidation.    During exercise there is obviously more abundant absorption of oxygen,  and consequently greater elimination "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13642"],[0,"The Journal of Negro History, Volume 1, January 1916 (#19)"],[1,"general satisfaction; and  wherever a negro servant is to be admitted, their owners, after the  perusal of it, are better satisfied. We are this day raising the roof on  the walls of our meeting house; the height of the walls from the  foundation is seventeen feet. I have a right to praise God, and glorify  him for the manifold blessings I have received, and do still receive  from him. I have full liberty from _Spanish Town_, the capital of this  country, to preach the Gospel throughout the Island: the Lord is  blessing the work everywhere, and believers are added daily to the  church. My tongue is not able to express the goodness of the Lord. As  our meeting house is out of town \"(about a mile and a half),\" I have a  steeple on it, to have a bell to give notice to our people and more  particularly to the owners of Slaves that are in our society, that they  may know the hour on which we meet, and be satisfied that our servants  return in due time; for which reason I shall be greatly obliged to you  to send me out, as soon as possible, a bell that can be heard about two  _miles_ distance, with the price. I have one at present, but it is  rather small. The slaves may then be permitted to come and return in due  time, for at present we meet very irregular in respect to hours.

ACCOUNT OF THE NEGRO CHURCH AT SAVANNAH, AND OF TWO NEGRO MINISTERS      Savannah, Dec. 22, 1792.      _Dear Brother Rippon_,    By return of Capt. Parrot in the ship Hannah, opportunity offers to  acknowledge receipt of your kind favour with two boxes of books  agreeable to invoice, which were very thankfully acceptable to our  Brother Andrew, as well as to myself, and were delivered agreeable to  your request. Within a month past a few of our Christian friends  providentially collected at my house, when it was thought necessary we  should commence a subscription for the building of a Baptist  Meeting-house in this city, as the corporation has given us a lot for  that purpose. Mr. Ebenezer Hills and myself were appointed trustees, and  we have subscribed L35. 6s. if we can get as much more, we intend to  begin the work, please God to smile on our weak endeavours, and the  place will be made sufficiently large to accommodate the black people:  they have been frowned upon of late by some despisers of religion, who  have endeavoured to suppress their meeting together on Thursday evening  in the week which was their custom, but is now set aside; so that they  only continue worship from the sun rise to sun set on Sabbath days.    I copied brother Andrew's last return of members for brother Silas  Mercer, who was here since the association of Coosawhatchic, which is as  follows: Return made to the Georgia Association,         Supposed to be two or three years past..................  250       Baptized since (say 80 in this year 1792)...............  159 409                                                                 ---       Excommunicated..........................................    8       Dead....................................................   12  20                                                                 --- ---         Total remaining Nov. 26, 1792.........................      389    Brother Andrew lately brought me a letter from brother George Liele, of  Jamaica, expressive of the great increase of his church in that island.  Andrew is free only since the death of his old master, and purchased his  freedom of one of their heirs at the rate of 50 l. He was born at Goose  Creek, about 16 miles from Charleston, South Carolina; his mother was a  slave, and died in the service of his old master: his father, a slave,  yet living, but rendered infirm by age for ten years past. Andrew was  married nine years since, which was about the time he and his wife were  brought to the knowledge of their wretched state by nature: His wife is  named Hannah and remains a slave to the heirs of his older master; they  have no children; He was ordained by our Brother Marshall: he has no  assistant preacher but his Brother Sampson, who continues a faithful  slave, and occasionally exhorts. Some white ministers from the country  preach in his church. Jesse Peter, another Negro (whose present master  is Thomas Galphin), is now here, and has three or four places in the  country where he attends preaching alternately; a number of white people  admire him. While he is here, I propose to be informed more particularly  of his situation, etc. Although a slave his master indulges him in his  profession and gives him uncommon liberty. To return to Andrew, he has  four deacons appointed, but not regularly introduced. He supports  himself by his own labour. There are no white people that particularly  belong to his church, but we have reason to hope that he has been  instrumental in the conviction and converting of some whites. Amos, the  other Negro minister, mentioned by Brother George, resides at one of the  Bahama Islands, which is called New Providence, and is about four days  sail towards the southeast. There is one white church at Ogeechee, and  another at Effingham; each of these are about twenty miles from this,  which are the nearest and only ones. Perhaps fifty of Andrew's church  can read, but only three can write.    For the present, accept of the sincere love and kind respects of the  Black Society, with Andrew's particular thanks. My ears have heard their  petitions to the throne of grace for you particularly, which no doubt  they will continue; and let me entreat your prayers for them, and for  the connected societies of this State.

Our Meeting-house is now covered in and the lower floor was completed  the 24th of last month. We supposed we are indebted for lumber, lime,  bricks, &c. between 4 and 500 l. I am not able to express the thanks I  owe for your kind attention to me, and the cause of God. The  Schoolmaster, together with the members of our church, return their  sincere thanks for the books you have been pleased to send them, being  so well adapted to the society, they have given great satisfaction.    I hope shortly to send you a full account of the number of people in our  societies in different parts of this island. I have baptized near 500.    I have purchased a piece of land in Spanish Town, the capital of this  Island, for a burying ground, with a house upon it, which serves for a  Meeting-house. James Jones, Esq., one of the magistrates of this town,  and Secretary of the Island, told me, that the Hon. William Mitchell,  Esq., the Gustos, had empowered him to grant me license to preach the  Gospel, and they have given me liberty to make mention of their names in  any congregation where we are interrupted. Mr. Jones has given  permission for all his negroes to be taught the word of God. The gospel  is taking great effect in this town. My brethren and sisters in general,  most affectionately give their Christian love to you, and all the dear  lovers of Jesus Christ in your church at London, and beg that they, and  all the other churches, will remember the poor Ethiopian Baptists of  Jamaica in their prayers, I remain, dear Sir and brother, your unworthy  fellow labourer in Christ.    George Liele.    --_Baptist Annual Register_, 1790-1793, page 542.        Kingston, Jamaica, April 12, 1793.      _Rev. and Dear Sir_,    I am one of the poor, unworthy, helpless creatures born in this island,  whom our glorious master Jesus Christ was graciously pleased to call  from a state of darkness to the marvelous light of the gospel and since  our Lord has bestowed his mercy on my soul, our beloved minister, by  consent of the church, appointed me deacon, schoolmaster, and his  principal helper.    We have great reason in this island to praise and glorify the Lord for  his goodness and loving kindness, in sending his blessed Gospel amongst  us by our well-beloved minister, Brother Liele. We were living in  slavery to sin and satan, and the Lord hath redeemed our souls to a  state of happiness to praise his glorious and ever blessed name; and we  hope to enjoy everlasting peace by the promise of our Lord and master  Jesus Christ. The blessed Gospel is spreading wonderfully in this  island; believers are daily coming into the church and we hope, in a  little time, to see Jamaica become a Christian country.    I remain respectfully, Rev. and Dear Sir,    Your poor Brother in Christ,    Thomas Nichols Swigle.        Mr. George Gibbs Bailey, of Bristol, now at Kingston, in Jamaica, writes  thus, under date May 9, 1793. \"I have inquired of all those who I  thought could give me an account of Mr. Liele's conduct without  prejudice, and I can say with pleasure, what Pilate said, I can _find no  fault in this man_. The Baptist church abundantly thrives among the  Negroes, more than any denomination in Jamaica; but I am very sorry to  say the Methodist church is declining greatly.\"    Another sensible Gentleman, of Kingston, in Jamaica,"]]]
