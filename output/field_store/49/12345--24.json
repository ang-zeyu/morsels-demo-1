One I saw  In fashion like a lute, had but the groin  Been sever'd, where it meets the forked part.  Swoln dropsy, disproportioning the limbs  With ill-converted moisture, that the paunch  Suits not the visage, open'd wide his lips  Gasping as in the hectic man for drought,  One towards the chin, the other upward curl'd.       \"O ye, who in this world of misery,  Wherefore I know not, are exempt from pain,\"  Thus he began, \"attentively regard  Adamo's woe.  When living, full supply  Ne'er lack'd me of what most I coveted;  One drop of water now, alas!  I crave.  The rills, that glitter down the grassy slopes  Of Casentino, making fresh and soft  The banks whereby they glide to Arno's stream,  Stand ever in my view; and not in vain;  For more the pictur'd semblance dries me up,  Much more than the disease, which makes the flesh  Desert these shrivel'd cheeks.  So from the place,  Where I transgress'd, stern justice urging me,  Takes means to quicken more my lab'ring sighs.  There is Romena, where I falsified  The metal with the Baptist's form imprest,  For which on earth I left my body burnt.  But if I here might see the sorrowing soul  Of Guido, Alessandro, or their brother,  For Branda's limpid spring I would not change  The welcome sight.  One is e'en now within,  If truly the mad spirits tell, that round  Are wand'ring.  But wherein besteads me that?  My limbs are fetter'd.  Were I but so light,  That I each hundred years might move one inch,  I had set forth already on this path,  Seeking him out amidst the shapeless crew,  Although eleven miles it wind, not more  Than half of one across.  They brought me down  Among this tribe; induc'd by them I stamp'd  The florens with three carats of alloy.\"       \"Who are that abject pair,\" I next inquir'd,  \"That closely bounding thee upon thy right  Lie smoking, like a band in winter steep'd  In the chill stream?\"--\"When to this gulf I dropt,\"  He answer'd, \"here I found them; since that hour  They have not turn'd, nor ever shall, I ween,  Till time hath run his course.  One is that dame  The false accuser of the Hebrew youth;  Sinon the other, that false Greek from Troy.  Sharp fever drains the reeky moistness out,  In such a cloud upsteam'd.\"  When that he heard,  One, gall'd perchance to be so darkly nam'd,  With clench'd hand smote him on the braced paunch,  That like a drum resounded:  but forthwith  Adamo smote him on the face, the blow  Returning with his arm, that seem'd as hard.       \"Though my o'erweighty limbs have ta'en from me  The power to move,\" said he, \"I have an arm  At liberty for such employ.\"  To whom  Was answer'd:  \"When thou wentest to the fire,  Thou hadst it not so ready at command,  Then readier when it coin'd th' impostor gold.\"       And thus the dropsied:  \"Ay, now speak'st thou true.  But there thou gav'st not such true testimony,  When thou wast question'd of the truth, at Troy.\"       \"If I spake false, thou falsely stamp'dst the coin,\"  Said Sinon; \"I am here but for one fault,  And thou for more than any imp beside.\"       \"Remember,\" he replied, \"O perjur'd one,  The horse remember, that did teem with death,  And all the world be witness to thy guilt.\"       \"To thine,\" return'd the Greek, \"witness the thirst  Whence thy tongue cracks, witness the fluid mound,  Rear'd by thy belly up before thine eyes,  A mass corrupt.\"  To whom the coiner thus:  \"Thy mouth gapes wide as ever to let pass  Its evil saying.  Me if thirst assails,  Yet I am stuff'd with moisture.  Thou art parch'd,  Pains rack thy head, no urging would'st thou need  To make thee lap Narcissus' mirror up.\"       I was all fix'd to listen, when my guide  Admonish'd:  \"Now beware:  a little more.  And I do quarrel with thee.\"  I perceiv'd  How angrily he spake, and towards him turn'd  With shame so poignant, as remember'd yet  Confounds me.  As a man that dreams of harm  Befall'n him, dreaming wishes it a dream,  And that which is, desires as if it were not,  Such then was I, who wanting power to speak  Wish'd to excuse myself, and all the while  Excus'd me, though unweeting that I did.       \"More grievous fault than thine has been, less shame,\"  My master cried, \"might expiate.  Therefore cast  All sorrow from thy soul; and if again  Chance bring thee, where like conference is held,  Think I am ever at thy side.  To hear  Such wrangling is a joy for vulgar minds.\"        CANTO XXXI    THE very tongue, whose keen reproof before  Had wounded me, that either cheek was stain'd,  Now minister'd my cure.  So have I heard,  Achilles and his father's javelin caus'd  Pain first, and then the boon of health restor'd.       Turning our back upon the vale of woe,  W cross'd th' encircled mound in silence.  There  Was twilight dim, that far long the gloom  Mine eye advanc'd not:  but I heard a horn  Sounded aloud. The peal it blew had made  The thunder feeble.  Following its course  The adverse way, my strained eyes were bent  On that one spot.  So terrible a blast  Orlando blew not, when that dismal rout  O'erthrew the host of Charlemagne, and quench'd  His saintly warfare.  Thitherward not long  My head was rais'd, when many lofty towers  Methought I spied.  \"Master,\" said I, \"what land  Is this?\"  He answer'd straight:  \"Too long a space  Of intervening darkness has thine eye  To traverse:  thou hast therefore widely err'd  In thy imagining.  Thither arriv'd  Thou well shalt see, how distance can delude  The sense.  A little therefore urge thee on.\"       Then tenderly he caught me by the hand;  \"Yet know,\" said he, \"ere farther we advance,  That it less strange may seem, these are not towers,  But giants.  In the pit they stand immers'd,  Each from his navel downward, round the bank.\"       As when a fog disperseth gradually,  Our vision traces what the mist involves  Condens'd in air; so piercing through the gross  And gloomy atmosphere, as more and more  We near'd toward the brink, mine error fled,  And fear came o'er me.  As with circling round  Of turrets, Montereggion crowns his walls,  E'en thus the shore, encompassing th' abyss,  Was turreted with giants, half their length  Uprearing, horrible, whom Jove from heav'n  Yet threatens, when his mutt'ring thunder rolls.       Of one already I descried the face,  Shoulders, and breast, and of the belly huge  Great part, and both arms down along his ribs.       All-teeming nature, when her plastic hand  Left framing of these monsters, did display  Past doubt her wisdom, taking from mad War  Such slaves to do his bidding; and if she  Repent her not of th' elephant and whale,  Who ponders well confesses her therein  Wiser and more discreet; for when brute force  And evil will are back'd with subtlety,  Resistance none avails.  His visage seem'd  In length and bulk, as doth the pine, that tops  Saint Peter's Roman fane; and th' other bones  Of like proportion, so that from above  The bank, which girdled him below, such height  Arose his stature, that three Friezelanders  Had striv'n in vain to reach but to his hair.  Full thirty ample palms was he expos'd  Downward from whence a man his garments loops.  \"Raphel bai ameth sabi almi,\"  So shouted his fierce lips, which sweeter hymns  Became not; and my guide address'd him thus:  \"O senseless spirit!  let thy horn for thee  Interpret:  therewith vent thy rage, if rage  Or other passion wring thee.  Search thy neck,  There shalt thou find the belt that binds it on.  Wild spirit!  lo, upon thy mighty breast  Where hangs the baldrick!\"  Then to me he spake:  \"He doth accuse himself.  Nimrod is this,  Through whose ill counsel in the world no more  One tongue prevails.  But pass we on, nor waste  Our words; for so each language is to him,  As his to others, understood by none.\"       Then to the leftward turning sped we forth,  And at a sling's throw found another shade  Far fiercer and more huge.  I cannot say  What master hand had girt him; but he held  Behind the right arm fetter'd, and before  The other with a chain, that fasten'd him  From the neck down, and five times round his form  Apparent met the wreathed links.  \"This proud one  Would of his strength against almighty Jove  Make trial,\" said my guide; \"whence he is thus  Requited: Ephialtes him they call.  Great was his prowess, when the giants brought  Fear on the gods:  those arms, which then he piled,  Now moves he never.\"  Forthwith I return'd:  \"Fain would I, if 't were possible, mine eyes  Of Briareus immeasurable gain'd  Experience next.\"  He answer'd: \"Thou shalt see  Not far from hence Antaeus, who both speaks  And is unfetter'd, who shall place us there  Where guilt is at its depth.  Far onward stands  Whom thou wouldst fain behold, in chains, and made  Like to this spirit, save that in his looks  More fell he seems.\"  By violent earthquake rock'd  Ne'er shook a tow'r, so reeling to its base,  As Ephialtes.  More than ever then  I dreaded death, nor than the terror more  Had needed, if I had not seen the cords  That held him fast.  We, straightway journeying on,  Came to Antaeus, who five ells complete  Without the head, forth issued from the cave.       \"O thou, who in the fortunate vale, that made  Great Scipio heir of glory, when his sword  Drove back the troop of Hannibal in flight,  Who thence of old didst carry for thy spoil  An hundred lions; and if thou hadst fought  In the high conflict on thy brethren's side,  Seems as men yet believ'd, that through thine arm  The sons of earth had conquer'd, now vouchsafe  To place us down beneath, where numbing cold  Locks up Cocytus.

Being three-quarters dog, food was  more necessary to Kazan than to his mate. Nature has fitted the  wolf-breed for famine, and in ordinary temperature Gray Wolf could have  lived for a fortnight without food. At sixty degrees below zero she  could exist a week, perhaps ten days. Only thirty hours had passed  sinee they had devoured the last of the frozen rabbit, and she was quite  satisfied to remain in their snug retreat.    But Kazan was hungry. He began to hunt in the face of the wind,  traveling toward the burned plain. He nosed about every windfall that he  came to, and investigated the thickets. A thin shot-like snow had  fallen, and in this--from the windfall to the burn--he found but a  single trail, and that was the trail of an ermine. Under a windfall he  caught the warm scent of a rabbit, but the rabbit was as safe from him  there as were the partridges in the trees, and after an hour of futile  digging and gnawing he gave up his effort to reach it. For three hours  he had hunted when he returned to Gray Wolf. He was exhausted. While  Gray Wolf, with the instinct of the wild, had saved her own strength and  energy, Kazan had been burning up his reserve forces, and was hungrier  than ever.    The moon rose clear and brilliant in the sky again that night, and Kazan  set out once more on the hunt. He urged Gray Wolf to accompany him,  whining for her outside the windfall--returning for her twice--but  Gray Wolf laid her ears aslant and refused to move. The temperature had  now fallen to sixty-five or seventy degrees below zero, and with it  there came from the north an increasing wind, making the night one in  which human life could not have existed for an hour. By midnight Kazan  was back under the windfall. The wind grew stronger. It began to wail in  mournful dirges over the swamp, and then it burst in fierce shrieking  volleys, with intervals of quiet between. These were the first warnings  from the great barrens that lay between the last lines of timber and the  Arctic. With morning the storm burst in all its fury from out of the  north, and Gray Wolf and Kazan lay close together and shivered as they  listened to the roar of it over the windfall. Once Kazan thrust his head  and shoulders out from the shelter of the fallen trees, but the storm  drove him back. Everything that possessed life had sought shelter,  according to its way and instinct. The furred creatures like the mink  and the ermine were safest, for during the warmer hunting days they were  of the kind that cached meat. The wolves and the foxes had sought out  the windfalls, and the rocks. Winged things, with the exception of the  owls, who were a tenth part body and nine-tenths feathers, burrowed  under snow-drifts or found shelter in thick spruce. To the hoofed and  horned animals the storm meant greatest havoc. The deer, the caribou and  the moose could not crawl under windfalls or creep between rocks. The  best they could do was to lie down in the lee of a drift, and allow  themselves to be covered deep with the protecting snow. Even then they  could not keep their shelter long, for they had to _eat_. For eighteen  hours out of the twenty-four the moose had to feed to keep himself alive  during the winter. His big stomach demanded quantity, and it took him  most of his time to nibble from the tops of bushes the two or three  bushels he needed a day. The caribou required almost as much--the deer  least of the three.    And the storm kept up that day, and the next, and still a third--three  days and three nights--and the third day and night there came with it a  stinging, shot-like snow that fell two feet deep on the level, and in  drifts of eight and ten. It was the \"heavy snow\" of the Indians--the  snow that lay like lead on the earth, and under which partridges and  rabbits were smothered in thousands.    On the fourth day after the beginning of the storm Kazan and Gray Wolf  issued forth from the windfall. There was no longer a wind--no more  falling snow. The whole world lay under a blanket of unbroken white, and  it was intensely cold.    The plague had worked its havoc with men. Now had come the days of  famine and death for the wild things.          CHAPTER XIII    THE TRAIL OF HUNGER      Kazan and Gray Wolf had been a hundred and forty hours without food. To  Gray Wolf this meant acute discomfort, a growing weakness. To Kazan it  was starvation. Six days and six nights of fasting had drawn in their  ribs and put deep hollows in front of their hindquarters. Kazan's eyes  were red, and they narrowed to slits as he looked forth into the day.  Gray Wolf followed him this time when he went out on the hard snow.  Eagerly and hopefully they began the hunt in the bitter cold. They swung  around the edge of the windfall, where there had always been rabbits.  There were no tracks now, and no scent. They continued in a horseshoe  circle through the swamp, and the only scent they caught was that of a  snow-owl perched up in a spruce. They came to the burn and turned back,  hunting the opposite side of the swamp. On this side there was a ridge.  They climbed the ridge, and from the cap of it looked out over a world  that was barren of life. Ceaselessly Gray Wolf sniffed the air, but she  gave no signal to Kazan. On the top of the ridge Kazan stood panting.  His endurance was gone. On their return through the swamp he stumbled  over an obstacle which he tried to clear with a jump. Hungrier and  weaker, they returned to the windfall. The night that followed was  clear, and brilliant with stars. They hunted the swamp again. Nothing  was moving--save one other creature, and that was a fox. Instinct told  them that it was futile to follow him.    It was then that the old thought of the cabin returned to Kazan. Two  things the cabin had always meant to him--warmth and food. And far  beyond the ridge was the cabin, where he and Gray Wolf had howled at the  scent of death. He did not think of man--or of that mystery which he had  howled at. He thought only of the cabin, and the cabin had always meant  food. He set off in a straight line for the ridge, and Gray Wolf  followed. They crossed the ridge and the burn beyond, and entered the  edge of a second swamp. Kazan was hunting listlessly now. His head hung  low. His bushy tail dragged in the snow. He was intent on the  cabin--only the cabin. It was his last hope. But Gray Wolf was still  alert, taking in the wind, and lifting her head whenever Kazan stopped  to snuffle his chilled nose in the snow. At last it came--the scent!  Kazan had moved on, but he stopped when he found that Gray Wolf was not  following. All the strength that was in his starved body revealed itself  in a sudden rigid tenseness as he looked at his mate. Her forefeet were  planted firmly to the east; her slim gray head was reaching out for the  scent; her body trembled.    Then--suddenly--they heard a sound, and with a whining cry Kazan set out  in its direction, with Gray Wolf at his flank. The scent grew stronger  and stronger in Gray Wolf's nostrils, and soon it came to Kazan. It was  not the scent of a rabbit or a partridge. It was big game. They  approached cautiously, keeping full in the wind. The swamp grew  thicker, the spruce more dense, and now--from a hundred yards ahead of  them--there came a crashing of locked and battling horns. Ten seconds  more they climbed over a snowdrift, and Kazan stopped and dropped flat  on his belly. Gray Wolf crouched close at his side, her blind eyes  turned to what she could smell but could not see.    Fifty yards from them a number of moose had gathered for shelter in the  thick spruce. They had eaten clear a space an acre in extent. The trees  were cropped bare as high as they could reach, and the snow was beaten  hard under their feet. There were six animals in the acre, two of them  bulls--and these bulls were fighting, while three cows and a yearling  were huddled in a group watching the mighty duel. Just before the storm  a young bull, sleek, three-quarters grown, and with the small compact  antlers of a four-year-old, had led the three cows and the yearling to  this sheltered spot among the spruce. Until last night he had been  master of the herd. During the night the older bull had invaded his  dominion. The invader was four times as old as the young bull. He was  half again as heavy. His huge palmate horns, knotted and irregular--but  massive--spoke of age. A warrior of a hundred fights, he had not  hesitated to give battle in his effort to rob the younger bull of his  home and family. Three times they had fought since dawn, and the  hard-trodden snow was red with blood. The smell of it came to Kazan's  and Gray Wolf's nostrils. Kazan sniffed hungrily. Queer sounds rolled up  and down in Gray Wolf's throat, and she licked her jaws.    For a moment the two fighters drew a few yards apart, and stood with  lowered heads. The old bull had not yet won victory. The younger bull  represented youth and endurance; in the older bull those things were  pitted against craft, greater weight, maturer strength--and a head and  horns that were like a battering ram. But in that great hulk of the  older bull there was one other thing--age. His huge sides were panting.  His nostrils were as wide as bells. Then, as if some invisible spirit of  the arena had given the signal, the animals came together again. The  crash of their horns could have been heard half a mile away, and under  twelve hundred pounds of flesh and bone the younger hull went plunging  back upon his haunches. Then was when youth displayed itself. In an  instant he was up, and locking horns with his adversary. Twenty times he  had done this, and each attack had seemed filled with increasing  strength. And now, as if realizing that the last moments of the last  fight had come, he twisted the old bull's neck and fought as he had  never fought before. Kazan and"]]]
