She was still groping in the darkness. She  could not, however, banish the belief that the traitor was Brandt. She  blamed herself for this, because of having no good reasons for  suspicion; but the conviction was there, fixed by intuition. Because a  man's eyes were steely gray, sharp like those of a cat's, and capable  of the same contraction and enlargement, there was no reason to  believe their owner was a criminal. But that, Helen acknowledged with  a smile, was the only argument she had. To be sure Brandt had looked  capable of anything, the night Jonathan knocked him down; she knew he  had incited Case to begin the trouble at Metzar's, and had seemed  worried since that time. He had not left the settlement on short  journeys, as had been his custom before the affair in the bar-room.  And not a horse had disappeared from Fort Henry since that time.    Brandt had not discontinued his attentions to her; if they were less  ardent it was because she had given him absolutely to understand that  she could be his friend only. And she would not have allowed even so  much except for Jonathan's plan. She fancied it was possible to see  behind Brandt's courtesy, the real subtle, threatening man. Stripped  of his kindliness, an assumed virtue, the iron man stood revealed,  cold, calculating, cruel.    Mordaunt she never saw but once and then, shocking and pitiful, he lay  dead drunk in the grass by the side of the road, his pale, weary,  handsome face exposed to the pitiless rays of the sun. She ran home  weeping over this wreck of what had once been so fine a gentleman. Ah!  the curse of rum! He had learned his soft speech and courtly bearing  in the refinement of a home where a proud mother adored, and gentle  sisters loved him. And now, far from the kindred he had disgraced, he  lay in the road like a log. How it hurt her! She almost wished she  could have loved him, if love might have redeemed. She was more kind  to her other admirers, more tolerant of Brandt, and could forgive the  Englishman, because the pangs she had suffered through love had  softened her spirit.    During this long period the growing friendship of her cousin for Betty  had been a source of infinite pleasure to Helen. She hoped and  believed a romance would develop between the young widow and Will, and  did all in her power, slyly abetted by the matchmaking colonel, to  bring the two together.    One afternoon when the sky was clear with that intense blue peculiar  to bright days in early autumn, Helen started out toward Betty's,  intending to remind that young lady she had promised to hunt for  clematis and other fall flowers.    About half-way to Betty's home she met Brandt. He came swinging round  a corner with his quick, firm step. She had not seen him for several  days, and somehow he seemed different. A brightness, a flash, as of  daring expectation, was in his face. The poise, too, of the man  had changed.    \"Well, I am fortunate. I was just going to your home,\" he said  cheerily. \"Won't you come for a walk with me?\"    \"You may walk with me to Betty's,\" Helen answered.    \"No, not that. Come up the hillside. We'll get some goldenrod. I'd  like to have a chat with you. I may go away--I mean I'm thinking of  making a short trip,\" he added hurriedly.    \"Please come.\"    \"I promised to go to Betty's.\"    \"You won't come?\" His voice trembled with mingled disappointment and  resentment.    \"No,\" Helen replied in slight surprise.    \"You have gone with the other fellows. Why not with me?\" He was white  now, and evidently laboring under powerful feelings that must have had  their origin in some thought or plan which hinged on the acceptance of  his invitation.    \"Because I choose not to,\" Helen replied coldly, meeting his glance  fully.    A dark red flush swelled Brandt's face and neck; his gray eyes gleamed  balefully with wolfish glare; his teeth were clenched. He breathed  hard and trembled with anger. Then, by a powerful effort, he conquered  himself; the villainous expression left his face; the storm of rage  subsided. Great incentive there must have been for him thus to repress  his emotions so quickly. He looked long at her with sinister, intent  regard; then, with the laugh of a desperado, a laugh which might have  indicated contempt for the failure of his suit, and which was fraught  with a world of meaning, of menace, he left her without so much as  a salute.    Helen pondered over this sudden change, and felt relieved because she  need make no further pretense of friendship. He had shown himself to  be what she had instinctively believed. She hurried on toward Betty's,  hoping to find Colonel Zane at home, and with Jonathan, for Brandt's  hint of leaving Fort Henry, and his evident chagrin at such a slip of  speech, had made her suspicious. She was informed by Mrs. Zane that  the colonel had gone to a log-raising; Jonathan had not been in for  several days, and Betty went away with Will.    \"Where did they go?\" asked Helen.    \"I'm not sure; I think down to the spring.\"    Helen followed the familiar path through the grove of oaks into the  glade. It was quite deserted. Sitting on the stone against which  Jonathan had leaned the day she kissed him, she gave way to tender  reflection. Suddenly she was disturbed by the sound of rapid  footsteps, and looking up, saw the hulking form of Metzar, the  innkeeper, coming down the path. He carried a bucket, and meant  evidently to get water. Helen did not desire to be seen, and, thinking  he would stay only a moment, slipped into a thicket of willows behind  the stone. She could see plainly through the foliage. Metzar came into  the glade, peered around in the manner of a man expecting to see some  one, and then, filling his bucket at the spring, sat down on  the stone.    Not a minute elapsed before soft, rapid footsteps sounded in the  distance. The bushes parted, disclosing the white, set face and gray  eyes of Roger Brandt. With a light spring he cleared the brook and  approached Metzar.    Before speaking he glanced around the glade with the fugitive,  distrustful glance of a man who suspects even the trees. Then,  satisfied by the scrutiny he opened his hunting frock, taking forth a  long object which he thrust toward Metzar.    It was an Indian arrow.    Metzar's dull gaze traveled from this to the ominous face of Brandt.    \"See there, you! Look at this arrow! Shot by the best Indian on the  border into the window of my room. I hadn't been there a minute when  it came from the island. God! but it was a great shot!\"    \"Hell!\" gasped Metzar, his dull face quickening with some awful  thought.    \"I guess it is hell,\" replied Brandt, his face growing whiter and  wilder.    \"Our game's up?\" questioned Metzar with haggard cheek.    \"Up? Man! We haven't a day, maybe less, to shake Fort Henry.\"    \"What does it mean?\" asked Metzar. He was the calmer of the two.    \"It's a signal. The Shawnees, who were in hiding with the horses over  by Blueberry swamp, have been flushed by those bordermen. Some of them  have escaped; at least one, for no one but Ashbow could shoot that  arrow across the river.\"    \"Suppose he hadn't come?\" whispered Metzar hoarsely.    Brandt answered him with a dark, shuddering gaze.    A twig snapped in the thicket. Like foxes at the click of a trap,  these men whirled with fearsome glances.    \"Ugh!\" came a low, guttural voice from the bushes, and an Indian of  magnificent proportions and somber, swarthy features, entered  the glade.          CHAPTER XI    The savage had just emerged from the river, for his graceful,  copper-colored body and scanty clothing were dripping with water. He  carried a long bow and a quiver of arrows.    Brandt uttered an exclamation of surprise, and Metzar a curse, as the  lithe Indian leaped the brook. He was not young. His swarthy face was  lined, seamed, and terrible with a dark impassiveness.    \"Paleface-brother-get-arrow,\" he said in halting English, as his eyes  flashed upon Brandt. \"Chief-want-make-sure.\"    The white man leaned forward, grasped the Indian's arm, and addressed  him in an Indian language. This questioning was evidently in regard to  his signal, the whereabouts of others of the party, and why he took  such fearful risks almost in the village. The Indian answered with one  English word.    \"Deathwind!\"    Brandt drew back with drawn, white face, while a whistling breath  escaped him.    \"I knew it, Metz. Wetzel!\" he exclaimed in a husky voice.    The blood slowly receded from Metzar's evil, murky face, leaving it  haggard.    \"Deathwind-on-Chief's-trail-up-Eagle Rock,\" continued the Indian.  \"Deathwind-fooled-not-for-long. Chief-wait-paleface-brothers at  Two Islands.\"    The Indian stepped into the brook, parted the willows, and was gone as  he had come, silently.    \"We know what to expect,\" said Brandt in calmer tone as the daring  cast of countenance returned to him. \"There's an Indian for you! He  got away, doubled like an old fox on his trail, and ran in here to  give us a chance at escape. Now you know why Bing Legget can't  be caught.\"    \"Let's dig at once,\" replied Metzar, with no show of returning courage  such as characterized his companion.    Brandt walked to and fro with bent brows, like one in deep thought.  Suddenly he turned upon Metzar eyes which were brightly hard, and  reckless with resolve.    \"By Heaven! I'll do it! Listen. Wetzel has gone to the top of Eagle  Mountain, where he and Zane have a rendezvous. Even he won't suspect  the cunning of this Indian; anyway it'll be after daylight to-morrow  before he strikes the trail. I've got twenty-four hours, and more, to  get this girl, and I'll do it!\"    \"Bad move to have weight like her on a march,\" said Metzar.    \"Bah! The thing's easy. As for you, go on, push ahead after we're  started. All I ask is that you stay by me until the time to  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9935"],[0,"Woman's Institute Library of Cookery.
