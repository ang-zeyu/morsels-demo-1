Our analysis may seem a bit labored, but only because we are so  accustomed to our own well-worn grooves of expression that they have  come to be felt as inevitable. Yet destructive analysis of the familiar  is the only method of approach to an understanding of fundamentally  different modes of expression. When one has learned to feel what is  fortuitous or illogical or unbalanced in the structure of his own  language, he is already well on the way towards a sympathetic grasp of  the expression of the various classes of concepts in alien types of  speech. Not everything that is \"outlandish\" is intrinsically illogical  or far-fetched. It is often precisely the familiar that a wider  perspective reveals as the curiously exceptional. From a purely logical  standpoint it is obvious that there is no inherent reason why the  concepts expressed in our sentence should have been singled out,  treated, and grouped as they have been and not otherwise. The sentence  is the outgrowth of historical and of unreasoning psychological forces  rather than of a logical synthesis of elements that have been clearly  grasped in their individuality. This is the case, to a greater or less  degree, in all languages, though in the forms of many we find a more  coherent, a more consistent, reflection than in our English forms of  that unconscious analysis into individual concepts which is never  entirely absent from speech, however it may be complicated with or  overlaid by the more irrational factors.    A cursory examination of other languages, near and far, would soon show  that some or all of the thirteen concepts that our sentence happens to  embody may not only be expressed in different form but that they may be  differently grouped among themselves; that some among them may be  dispensed with; and that other concepts, not considered worth expressing  in English idiom, may be treated as absolutely indispensable to the  intelligible rendering of the proposition. First as to a different  method of handling such concepts as we have found expressed in the  English sentence. If we turn to German, we find that in the equivalent  sentence (_Der Bauer toetet das Entelein_) the definiteness of reference  expressed by the English _the_ is unavoidably coupled with three other  concepts--number (both _der_ and _das_ are explicitly singular), case  (_der_ is subjective; _das_ is subjective or objective, by elimination  therefore objective), and gender, a new concept of the relational order  that is not in this case explicitly involved in English (_der_ is  masculine, _das_ is neuter). Indeed, the chief burden of the expression  of case, gender, and number is in the German sentence borne by the  particles of reference rather than by the words that express the  concrete concepts (_Bauer_, _Entelein_) to which these relational  concepts ought logically to attach themselves. In the sphere of concrete  concepts too it is worth noting that the German splits up the idea of  \"killing\" into the basic concept of \"dead\" (_tot_) and the derivational  one of \"causing to do (or be) so and so\" (by the method of vocalic  change, _toet-_); the German _toet-et_ (analytically _tot-_+vowel  change+_-et_) \"causes to be dead\" is, approximately, the formal  equivalent of our _dead-en-s_, though the idiomatic application of this  latter word is different.[55]    [Footnote 55: \"To cause to be dead\" or \"to cause to die\" in the sense of  \"to kill\" is an exceedingly wide-spread usage. It is found, for  instance, also in Nootka and Sioux.]    Wandering still further afield, we may glance at the Yana method of  expression. Literally translated, the equivalent Yana sentence would  read something like \"kill-s he farmer[56] he to duck-ling,\" in which  \"he\" and \"to\" are rather awkward English renderings of a general third  personal pronoun (_he_, _she_, _it_, or _they_) and an objective  particle which indicates that the following noun is connected with the  verb otherwise than as subject. The suffixed element in \"kill-s\"  corresponds to the English suffix with the important exceptions that it  makes no reference to the number of the subject and that the statement  is known to be true, that it is vouched for by the speaker. Number is  only indirectly expressed in the sentence in so far as there is no  specific verb suffix indicating plurality of the subject nor specific  plural elements in the two nouns. Had the statement been made on  another's authority, a totally different \"tense-modal\" suffix would have  had to be used. The pronouns of reference (\"he\") imply nothing by  themselves as to number, gender, or case. Gender, indeed, is completely  absent in Yana as a relational category.    [Footnote 56: Agriculture was not practised by the Yana. The verbal idea  of \"to farm\" would probably be expressed in some such synthetic manner  as \"to dig-earth\" or \"to grow-cause.\" There are suffixed elements  corresponding to _-er_ and _-ling_.]    The Yana sentence has already illustrated the point that certain of our  supposedly essential concepts may be ignored; both the Yana and the  German sentence illustrate the further point that certain concepts may  need expression for which an English-speaking person, or rather the  English-speaking habit, finds no need whatever. One could go on and give  endless examples of such deviations from English form, but we shall have  to content ourselves with a few more indications. In the Chinese  sentence \"Man kill duck,\" which may be looked upon as the practical  equivalent of \"The man kills the duck,\" there is by no means present  for the Chinese consciousness that childish, halting, empty feeling  which we experience in the literal English translation. The three  concrete concepts--two objects and an action--are each directly  expressed by a monosyllabic word which is at the same time a radical  element; the two relational concepts--\"subject\" and \"object\"--are  expressed solely by the position of the concrete words before and after  the word of action. And that is all. Definiteness or indefiniteness of  reference, number, personality as an inherent aspect of the verb, tense,  not to speak of gender--all these are given no expression in the  Chinese sentence, which, for all that, is a perfectly adequate  communication--provided, of course, there is that context, that  background of mutual understanding that is essential to the complete  intelligibility of all speech. Nor does this qualification impair our  argument, for in the English sentence too we leave unexpressed a large  number of ideas which are either taken for granted or which have been  developed or are about to be developed in the course of the  conversation. Nothing has been said, for example, in the English,  German, Yana, or Chinese sentence as to the place relations of the  farmer, the duck, the speaker, and the listener. Are the farmer and the  duck both visible or is one or the other invisible from the point of  view of the speaker, and are both placed within the horizon of the  speaker, the listener, or of some indefinite point of reference \"off  yonder\"? In other words, to paraphrase awkwardly certain latent  \"demonstrative\" ideas, does this farmer (invisible to us but standing  behind a door not far away from me, you being seated yonder well out of  reach) kill that duckling (which belongs to you)? or does that farmer  (who lives in your neighborhood and whom we see over there) kill that  duckling (that belongs to him)? This type of demonstrative elaboration  is foreign to our way of thinking, but it would seem very natural,  indeed unavoidable, to a Kwakiutl Indian.    What, then, are the absolutely essential concepts in speech, the  concepts that must be expressed if language is to be a satisfactory  means of communication? Clearly we must have, first of all, a large  stock of basic or radical concepts, the concrete wherewithal of speech.  We must have objects, actions, qualities to talk about, and these must  have their corresponding symbols in independent words or in radical  elements. No proposition, however abstract its intent, is humanly  possible without a tying on at one or more points to the concrete world  of sense. In every intelligible proposition at least two of these  radical ideas must be expressed, though in exceptional cases one or even  both may be understood from the context. And, secondly, such relational  concepts must be expressed as moor the concrete concepts to each other  and construct a definite, fundamental form of proposition. In this  fundamental form there must be no doubt as to the nature of the  relations that obtain between the concrete concepts. We must know what  concrete concept is directly or indirectly related to what other, and  how. If we wish to talk of a thing and an action, we must know if they  are cooerdinately related to each other (e.g., \"He is fond of _wine and  gambling_\"); or if the thing is conceived of as the starting point, the  \"doer\" of the action, or, as it is customary to say, the \"subject\" of  which the action is predicated; or if, on the contrary, it is the end  point, the \"object\" of the action. If I wish to communicate an  intelligible idea about a farmer, a duckling, and the act of killing, it  is not enough to state the linguistic symbols for these concrete ideas  in any order, higgledy-piggledy, trusting that the hearer may construct  some kind of a relational pattern out of the general probabilities of  the case. The fundamental syntactic relations must be unambiguously  expressed. I can afford to be silent on the subject of time and place  and number and of a host of other possible types of concepts, but I can  find no way of dodging the issue as to who is doing the killing.

Engulfed in Coburgs, he failed to appreciate  the complexity of English affairs. There were difficulties about his  household. He had a notion that he ought not to be surrounded by  violent Whigs; very likely, but he would not understand that the only  alternatives to violent Whigs were violent Tories; and it would be  preposterous if his Lords and Gentlemen were to be found voting against  the Queen's. He wanted to appoint his own Private Secretary. But how  could he choose the right person? Lord M. was obviously best qualified  to make the appointment; and Lord M. had decided that the Prince should  take over his own Private Secretary--George Anson, a staunch Whig.  Albert protested, but it was useless; Victoria simply announced that  Anson was appointed, and instructed Lehzen to send the Prince an  explanation of the details of the case.    Then, again, he had written anxiously upon the necessity of maintaining  unspotted the moral purity of the Court. Lord M's pupil considered that  dear Albert was strait-laced, and, in a brisk Anglo-German missive, set  forth her own views. \"I like Lady A. very much,\" she told him, \"only she  is a little strict awl particular, and too severe towards others, which  is not right; for I think one ought always to be indulgent towards other  people, as I always think, if we had not been well taken care of, we  might also have gone astray. That is always my feeling. Yet it is always  right to show that one does not like to see what is obviously wrong; but  it is very dangerous to be too severe, and I am certain that as a rule  such people always greatly regret that in their youth they have not been  so careful as they ought to have been. I have explained this so badly  and written it so badly, that I fear you will hardly be able to make it  out.\"    On one other matter she was insistent. Since the affair of Lady Flora  Hastings, a sad fate had overtaken Sir James Clark. His flourishing  practice had quite collapsed; nobody would go to him any more. But the  Queen remained faithful. She would show the world how little she cared  for their disapproval, and she desired Albert to make \"poor Clark\" his  physician in ordinary. He did as he was told; but, as it turned out, the  appointment was not a happy one.    The wedding-day was fixed, and it was time for Albert to tear himself  away from his family and the scenes of his childhood. With an aching  heart, he had revisited his beloved haunts--the woods and the valleys  where he had spent so many happy hours shooting rabbits and collecting  botanical specimens; in deep depression, he had sat through the farewell  banquets in the Palace and listened to the Freischutz performed by  the State band. It was time to go. The streets were packed as he drove  through them; for a short space his eyes were gladdened by a sea of  friendly German faces, and his ears by a gathering volume of good  guttural sounds. He stopped to bid a last adieu to his grandmother.  It was a heartrending moment. \"Albert! Albert!\" she shrieked, and fell  fainting into the arms of her attendants as his carriage drove away. He  was whirled rapidly to his destiny. At Calais a steamboat awaited him,  and, together with his father and his brother, he stepped, dejected, on  board. A little later, he was more dejected still. The crossing was a  very rough one; the Duke went hurriedly below; while the two Princes,  we are told, lay on either side of the cabin staircase \"in an almost  helpless state.\" At Dover a large crowd was collected on the pier, and  \"it was by no common effort that Prince Albert, who had continued to  suffer up to the last moment, got up to bow to the people.\" His sense  of duty triumphed. It was a curious omen: his whole life in England was  foreshadowed as he landed on English ground.    Meanwhile Victoria, in growing agitation, was a prey to temper and to  nerves. She grew feverish, and at last Sir James Clark pronounced  that she was going to have the measles. But, once again, Sir James's  diagnosis was incorrect. It was not the measles that were attacking  her, but a very different malady; she was suddenly prostrated by alarm,  regret, and doubt. For two years she had been her own mistress--the two  happiest years, by far, of her life. And now it was all to end! She was  to come under an alien domination--she would have to promise that she  would honour and obey... someone, who might, after all, thwart her,  oppose her--and how dreadful that would be! Why had she embarked on this  hazardous experiment? Why had she not been contented with Lord M.? No  doubt, she loved Albert; but she loved power too. At any rate, one thing  was certain: she might be Albert's wife, but she would always be Queen  of England. He reappeared, in an exquisite uniform, and her hesitations  melted in his presence like mist before the sun. On February 10, 1840,  the marriage took place. The wedded pair drove down to Windsor; but  they were not, of course, entirely alone. They were accompanied by their  suites, and, in particular, by two persons--the Baron Stockmar and the  Baroness Lehzen.    III    Albert had foreseen that his married life would not be all plain  sailing; but he had by no means realised the gravity and the  complication of the difficulties which he would have to face.  Politically, he was a cipher. Lord Melbourne was not only Prime  Minister, he was in effect the Private Secretary of the Queen, and thus  controlled the whole of the political existence of the sovereign. A  queen's husband was an entity unknown to the British Constitution. In  State affairs there seemed to be no place for him; nor was Victoria  herself at all unwilling that this should be so. \"The English,\" she had  told the Prince when, during their engagement, a proposal had been made  to give him a peerage, \"are very jealous of any foreigner interfering in  the government of this country, and have already in some of the papers  expressed a hope that you would not interfere. Now, though I know you  never would, still, if you were a Peer, they would all say, the Prince  meant to play a political part. I know you never would!\" In reality, she  was not quite so certain; but she wished Albert to understand her views.  He would, she hoped, make a perfect husband; but, as for governing the  country, he would see that she and Lord M. between them could manage  that very well, without his help.    But it was not only in politics that the Prince discovered that the part  cut out for him was a negligible one. Even as a husband, he found, his  functions were to be of an extremely limited kind. Over the whole of  Victoria's private life the Baroness reigned supreme; and she had not  the slightest intention of allowing that supremacy to be diminished by  one iota. Since the accession, her power had greatly increased. Besides  the undefined and enormous influence which she exercised through her  management of the Queen's private correspondence, she was now the  superintendent of the royal establishment and controlled the important  office of Privy Purse. Albert very soon perceived that he was not master  in his own house. Every detail of his own and his wife's existence was  supervised by a third person: nothing could be done until the consent  of Lehzen had first been obtained. And Victoria, who adored Lehzen with  unabated intensity, saw nothing in all this that was wrong.    Nor was the Prince happier in his social surroundings. A shy young  foreigner, awkward in ladies' company, unexpansive and self-opinionated,  it was improbable that, in any circumstances, he would have been a  society success. His appearance, too, was against him. Though in the  eyes of Victoria he was the mirror of manly beauty, her subjects, whose  eyes were of a less Teutonic cast, did not agree with her. To them--and  particularly to the high-born ladies and gentlemen who naturally saw him  most--what was immediately and distressingly striking in Albert's face  and figure and whole demeanour was his un-English look. His features  were regular, no doubt, but there was something smooth and smug about  them; he was tall, but he was clumsily put together, and he walked with  a slight slouch. Really, they thought, this youth was more like  some kind of foreign tenor than anything else. These were serious  disadvantages; but the line of conduct which the Prince adopted from  the first moment of his arrival was far from calculated to dispel  them. Owing partly to a natural awkwardness, partly to a fear of undue  familiarity, and partly to a desire to be absolutely correct, his  manners were infused with an extraordinary stiffness and formality.  Whenever he appeared in company, he seemed to be surrounded by a thick  hedge of prickly etiquette. He never went out into ordinary society; he  never walked in the streets of London; he was invariably accompanied by  an equerry when he rode or drove. He wanted to be irreproachable and, if  that involved friendlessness, it could not be helped. Besides, he had no  very high opinion of the English. So far as he could see, they cared for  nothing but fox-hunting and Sunday observances; they oscillated between  an undue frivolity and an undue gloom; if you spoke to them of friendly  joyousness they stared; and they did not understand either the Laws of  Thought or the wit of a German University. Since it was clear that with  such people he could have very little in common, there was no reason  whatever for relaxing in their favour the rules of etiquette. In strict  privacy, he could be natural and charming; Seymour and Anson were  devoted to him, and he returned their affection; but they were  subordinates--the receivers of his confidences and the agents of his  will. From the support and the solace of true companionship he was  utterly cut off.    A friend, indeed, he had--or rather, a mentor. The Baron,"]]]
