All the horizontal pieces, B, should be beveled 45  degrees at the ends and drilled for 3/16 in. stove bolts. The  beveling may be done by roughing out with a hacksaw and finishing  with a file. After all the pieces are cut and beveled they should  be drilled at the ends for the 3/16-in. stove bolts, C. Drill all  the horizontal pieces, B, first and then mark the holes on the  upright pieces, A, through the holes already drilled, thus making  all the holes coincide. Mark the ends of each piece with a figure  or letter, so that when they are assembled, the same ends will  come together again. The upright pieces, A, should be countersunk  as shown in the detail, and then the frame is ready to assemble.    After the frame has been assembled take it to glazier and have a  bottom made of skylight glass, and sides and ends of double-thick  window glass. The bottom glass should be a good fit, but the sides  and ends should be made slightly shorter to allow the cement, E,  to form a dovetail joint as shown. When the glass is put in the  frame a space, D, will be found between the glass and the  horizontal pieces, B, of the frame. If this were allowed to remain  the pressure of the water would spring the glass and cause a leak  at E; so it is filled up with plaster of paris.    The cement, E, is made as follows: Take 1 gill of plaster of  paris, 1 gill of litharge, 1 gill of fine white sand, and 1/3 of a  gill of finely powdered rosin. Mix well and add boiled linseed oil  and turpentine until as thick as putty. Let    [Illustration: Detail of Aquarium Frame]    the cement dry three or four days before putting any water in the  aquarium.    In choosing stock for the aquarium it should be remembered that a  sufficient quantity of vegetable life is required to furnish  oxygen for the fish. In a well balanced aquarium the water  requires renewal only two or three times a year. It is well to  have an excess of plants and a number of snails, as the snails  will devour all the decaying vegetable matter which would  otherwise poison the water and kill the fish.    [Illustration: Aquarium Finished]    If desired, a centerpiece (A, Fig. 2) can be made of colored  stones held together by cement, and an inverted jar can be  supported in the position shown at B. If the mouth of the jar is  below the surface of the water it will stay filled and allow the  fish to swim up inside as shown. Some washed pebbles or gravel  should be placed on the bottom, and, if desired, a few Chinese  lilies or other plants may be placed on the centerpiece.        ** Homemade Pneumatic Lock [65]    Mount an old bicycle hand-pump, A, on the door by means of a metal  plate, B, having a swinging connection at C. Fasten the lever, D,  to the door knob, and make a hinge connection with the pump by  means of a piece of sheet    [Illustration: Pneumatic Door-Opener]    brass, E, soldered to the end of the cylinder. All this apparatus  is on the inside of the door and is connected by a small rubber  tube, F, to a secret mouthpiece placed at some convenient  location. A small piece of spring brass, screwed to the door  frame, will open the door about 1/2 in. when the operator blows in  the mouthpiece, or if the door is within reach of the mouthpiece,  the operator may push the door at the same time that he blows,  thus doing away with the spring, which is only used to keep the  door from relocking.    One way of making the air connection with the outside is to bend  the tube F around and stick it through the keyhole. Few burglars  would ever think to blow in the keyhole.  --Contributed by Orton E. White, Buffalo, N. Y.        ** A Homemade Water Motor [66]  By MRS. PAUL S. WINTER    In these days of modern improvements, most houses are equipped  with a washing machine, and the question that arises in the mind  of the householder is how to furnish the power to run it  economically. I referred this question to my husband, with the  result that he built a motor which proved so very satisfactory  that I prevailed upon him to give the readers of Amateur Mechanics  a description of it, hoping it may solve the same question for  them.    A motor of this type will develop about 1/2 hp. with a water  pressure of 70 lb. The power developed is correspondingly  increased or decreased as the pressure exceeds or falls below  this. In the latter case the power may be increased by using a  smaller pulley. Fig. 1 is the motor with one side removed, showing  the paddle-wheel in position; Fig. 2 is an end view; Fig. 3 shows  one of the paddles, and Fig. 4 shows the method of shaping the  paddles. To make the frame, several lengths of scantling 3 in.  wide by 1 in. thick (preferably of hard wood) are required. Cut  two of them 4 ft. long, to form the main supports of the frame,  AA, Fig. 1 ; another, 2 ft. 6 in. long, for the top, B, Fig. 1;  another, 26 in. long, to form the slanting part, C, Fig. 1; and  another, D, approximately 1 ft., according to the slant given C.  After nailing these together as shown in the illustration, nail  two short strips on each side of the outlet, as at E, to keep the  frame from spreading.    Cut two pieces 30 in. long. Lay these on the sides of the frame  with their center lines along the line FF, which is 15 in. from  the outside top of the frame. They are shown in Fig. 2 at GG. Do  not fasten these boards now, but mark their position on the frame.  Two short boards 1 in. wide    [Illustration: Detail of Homemade Waterwheel]    by 1 in. thick (HH, Fig. 2) and another 1 in. by 1-1/2 in. (I,  Fig. 2) form a substantial base.    Cut the wheel from sheet iron 1/16 in. thick, 24 in. in diameter.  This can be done roughly with hammer and chisel and then smoothed  up on an emery wheel, after which cut 24 radial slots 3/4 in. deep  on its circumference by means of a hacksaw. On each side of the  wheel at the center fasten a rectangular piece of 1/4-in. iron 3  by 4 in. and secure it to the wheel by means of four rivets; after  which drill a 5/8 in. hole through the exact center of the wheel.    Cut 24 pieces of 1/32-in. iron, 1-1/2 by 2-1/2 in. These are the  paddles. Shape them by placing one end over a section of 1-in.  pipe, and hammer bowl shaped with the peen of a hammer, as shown  in Fig. 4. Then cut them into the shape shown in Fig. 3 and bend  the tapered end in along the lines JJ, after which place them in  the slots of the wheel and bend the sides over to clamp the wheel.  Drill 1/8-in. holes through the wheel and sides of the paddles and  rivet paddles in place. Next secure a 5/8-in. steel shaft 12 in.  long to the wheel about 8 in. from one end by means of a key. This  is done by cutting a groove in the shaft and a corresponding  groove in the wheel and fitting in a piece of metal in order to  secure the wheel from turning independently of the shaft. Procure  two collars or round pieces of brass (KK, Fig. 2) with a 5/8-in.  hole through them, and fasten these to the shaft by means of set  screws to prevent it from moving lengthwise.    Make the nozzle by taking a piece of 1/2-in. galvanized pipe 3-1/2  in. long and filling it with babbitt metal; then drill a 3/16-in.  hole through its center. Make this hole conical, tapering from  3/16 in. to a full 1/2 in. This is best done by using a square  taper reamer. Then place the nozzle in the position shown in Fig.  1, which allows the stream of water to strike the buckets full in  the center when they reach the position farthest to the right.  Take the side pieces, GG, and drill a 1-in. hole through their  sides centrally, and a 1/4-in. hole from the tops to the 1-in.  holes. Fasten them in their proper position, with the wheel and  shaft in place, the shaft projecting through the holes just  mentioned. Now block the wheel; that is, fasten it by means of  wedges or blocks of wood until the shaft is exactly in the center  of the inch holes in the side pieces. Cut four disks of cardboard  to slip over the shaft and large enough to cover the inch holes.  Two of these are to be inside and two outside of the frames (one  to bear against each side of each crosspiece). Fasten these to the  crosspieces by means of tacks to hold them securely. Pour melted  babbitt metal into the 1/4-in. hole to form the bearings. When it  has cooled, remove the cardboard, take down the crosspieces, and  drill a 1/8-in. hole from the top of the crosspieces through the  babbitt for an oil-hole.    Secure sufficient sheet zinc to cover the sides of the frame. Cut  the zinc to the same shape as the frame and let it extend down to  the crosspieces EE. Tack one side on. (It is well to tack strips  of heavy cloth--burlap will do--along the edges under the zinc to  form a water-tight joint.) Fasten the crosspiece over the zinc in  its proper position. Drill a hole through the zinc, using the hole  in the crosspiece as a guide. Then put the wheel in a central  position in the frame, tack the other side piece of zinc in place  and put the other crosspiece in place. Place the two collars  mentioned before on the shaft, and fasten so as to bear against  the crosspieces, in order to prevent the wheel and shaft from  moving sidewise. If the bearings are now oiled, the shaft should  turn easily and smoothly. Fasten a pulley 4 or 6 in. in diameter  to the longest arm of the shaft.    Connect the nozzle to a water faucet by means of a piece of hose;  place the outlet over a drain, and belt the motor direct to the  washing-machine, sewing machine, ice-cream freezer, drill press,  dynamo or any other machinery requiring not more than 1/2 hp.    This motor has been in use in our house for two years in all of  the above ways, and has never once failed to give perfect  satisfaction. It is obvious that, had the wheel and paddles been  made of brass, it would be more durable, but as it would have cost  several times as much, it is a question whether it would be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12661"],[0,"Canada under British Rule 1760-1900 (#19)"],[1,"ple,  to whom Canada owes a deep debt of gratitude for the services they  rendered her in the most critical period of her chequered history.          CHAPTER IV.    DEVELOPMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE INSTITUTIONS (1784--1812).      SECTION I--Beginnings of the provinces of New Brunswick, Lower Canada  and Upper Canada.    On the 16th August, 1784, as a consequence of the coming of over ten  thousand Loyalists to the valley of the St. John River, a new province  was formed out of that portion of the ancient limits of Acadia, which  extended northward from the isthmus of Chignecto to the province of  Quebec, and eastward from the uncertain boundary of the St. Croix to the  Gulf of St. Lawrence. It received its present name in honour of the  Brunswick-Luneburg or Hanoverian line which had given a royal dynasty to  England, and its first governor was Colonel Thomas Carleton, a brother  of the distinguished governor-general, whose name is so intimately  associated with the fortunes of Canada during a most critical period of  its history. The first executive council, which was also the legislative  council, comprised some of the most eminent men of the Loyalist  migration. For instance, George Duncan Ludlow; who had been a judge of  the supreme court of New York; Jonathan Odell, the famous satirist and  divine; William Hazen, a merchant of high reputation, who had large  interests on the St. John River from 1763, and had proved his fidelity  to the crown at a time when his countrymen at Maugerville were disposed  to join the revolutionary party; Gabriel G. Ludlow, previously a colonel  in a royal regiment; Edward Winslow, Daniel Bliss and Isaac Allen, all  of whom had borne arms in the royal service and had suffered the loss of  valuable property, confiscated by the successful rebels.    The constitution of 1784 provided for an assembly of twenty-six members  who were elected in 1785, and met for the first time on the 3rd of  January, 1786, at the Mallard House, a plain two-storey building on the  north side of King Street. The city of St. John ceased to be the seat of  government in 1787, when the present capital, Fredericton, first known  as St. Anne's, was chosen. Of the twenty-six members elected to this  assembly, twenty-three were Loyalists, and the same class necessarily  continued for many years to predominate in the legislature. The first  speaker was Amos Botsford, the pioneer of the Loyalist migration to New  Brunswick, whose grandson occupied the same position for a short time in  the senate of the Dominion of Canada.    Coming to the province of Lower Canada we find it contained at this time  a population of about a hundred thousand souls, of whom six thousand  lived in Quebec and Montreal respectively. Only two thousand  English-speaking persons resided in the province, almost entirely in the  towns. Small as was the British minority, it continued that agitation  for an assembly which had been commenced long before the passage of the  Quebec act. A nominated council did not satisfy the political ambition  of this class, who obtained little support from the French Canadian  people. The objections of the latter arose from the working of the act  itself. Difficulties had grown up in the administration of the law,  chiefly in consequence of its being entrusted exclusively to men  acquainted only with English jurisprudence, and not disposed to comply  with the letter and intention of the imperial statute. As a matter of  practice, French law was only followed as equity suggested; and the  consequence was great legal confusion in the province. A question had  also arisen as to the legality of the issue of writs of _habeas corpus_,  and it was eventually necessary to pass an ordinance to remove all  doubts on this important point.    The Loyalist settlers on the St. Lawrence and Niagara Rivers sent a  petition in 1785 to the home government, praying for the establishment  of a new district west of the River Beaudette \"with the blessings of  British laws and British government, and of exemption from French tenure  of property.\" While such matters were under the consideration of the  imperial authorities, Sir Guy Carleton, once more governor-general of  Canada, and lately raised to the peerage as Lord Dorchester,  established, in 1788, five new districts for the express object of  providing for the temporary government of the territory where the  Loyalists had settled. These districts were known as Luneburg,  Mecklenburg, Nassau and Hesse, in the western country, and Gaspe in the  extreme east of the province of Quebec, where a small number of the same  class of people had also found new homes. Townships, ranging from eighty  to forty thousand acres each, were also surveyed within these districts  and parcelled out with great liberality among the Loyalists. Magistrates  wore appointed to administer justice with the simplest possible  machinery at a time when men trained in the law were not available.    The grants of land made to the Loyalists and their children were large,  and in later years a considerable portion passed into the hands of  speculators who bought them up at nominal sums. It was in connection  with these grants that the name of \"United Empire Loyalists\" originated.  An order-in-council was passed on the 9th of November, 1780, in  accordance with the wish of Lord Dorchester \"to put a mark of honour  upon the families who had adhered to the _unity of the empire_ and  joined the royal standard in America before the treaty of separation in  1783.\" Accordingly the names of all persons falling under this  designation were to be recorded as far as possible, in order that \"their  posterity may be discriminated from future settlers in the parish lists  and rolls of militia of their respective districts, and other public  remembrances of the province.\"    The British cabinet, of which Mr. Pitt, the famous son of the Earl of  Chatham, was first minister, now decided to divide the province of  Quebec into two districts, with separate legislatures and governments.  Lord Grenville, while in charge of the department of colonial affairs,  wrote in 1789 to Lord Dorchester that the \"general object of the plan is  to assimilate the constitution of the province to that of Great Britain  as nearly as the differences arising from the names of the people and  from the present situation of the province will admit.\" He also  emphatically expressed the opinion that \"a considerable degree of  attention is due to the prejudices and habits of the French inhabitants,  and every degree of caution should be used to continue to them the  enjoyment of those civil and religious rights which were secured to them  by the capitulation of the province, or have since been granted by the  liberal and enlightened spirit of the British government.\" When the bill  for the formation of the two provinces of Upper Canada and Lower Canada  came before the house of commons, Mr. Adam Lymburner, an influential  merchant of Quebec, appeared at the Bar and ably opposed the separation  \"as dangerous in every point of view to British interests in America,  and to the safety, tranquillity and prosperity of the inhabitants of the  province of Quebec\" He pressed the repeal of the Quebec act in its  entirety and the enactment of a perfectly new constitution \"unclogged  and unembarrassed with any laws prior to this period\" He professed to  represent the views \"of the most intelligent and respectable of the  French Canadians\"; but their antagonism was not directed against the  Quebec act in itself, but against the administration of the law,  influenced as this was by the opposition of the British people to the  French civil code. Nor does it appear, as Mr. Lymburner asserted, that  the western Loyalists were hostile to the formation of two distinct  provinces. He represented simply the views of the English-speaking  inhabitants of Lower Canada, who believed that the proposed division  would place them in a very small minority in the legislature and, as the  issue finally proved, at the mercy of the great majority of the French  Canadian representatives, while on the other hand the formation of one  large province extending from Gaspe to the head of the great lakes would  ensure an English representation sufficiently formidable to lessen the  danger of French Canadian domination. However, the British government  seems to have been actuated by a sincere desire to do justice to the  French Canadians and the Loyalists of the upper province at one and the  same time. When introducing the bill in the house of commons on the 7th  March, 1791, Mr. Pitt expressed the hope that \"the division would remove  the differences of opinion which had arisen between the old and new  inhabitants, since each province would have the right of enacting laws  desired in its own house of assembly.\" He believed a division to be  essential, as \"otherwise he could not reconcile the clashing interests  known to exist.\" Mr. Burke was of opinion that \"to attempt to amalgamate  two populations composed of races of men diverse in language, laws and  customs, was a complete absurdity\", and he consequently approved of the  division. Mr. Fox, from whom Burke became alienated during this debate,  looked at the question in an entirely different light and was strongly  of opinion that \"it was most desirable to see the French and English  inhabitants coalesce into one body, and the different distinctions of  people extinguished for ever.\"    The Constitutional act of 1791 established in each province a  legislative council and assembly, with powers to make laws. The  legislative council was to be appointed by the king for life, in Upper  Canada it was to consist of not less than seven, and in Lower Canada of  not less than fifteen members. The sovereign might, if he thought  proper, annex hereditary titles of honour to the right of being summoned  to the legislative council in either province--a"]]]
