Numa brought up upon his haunches, roaring terribly and striking at the  spear which protruded from his breast.  His great blows bent and  twisted the weapon.  Tarzan, crouching and with hunting knife in hand,  circled warily about the frenzied cat.  Momaya, wide-eyed, stood rooted  to the spot, watching, fascinated.    In sudden fury Numa hurled himself toward the ape-man, but the wiry  creature eluded the blundering charge, side-stepping quickly only to  rush in upon his foe.  Twice the hunting blade flashed in the air.  Twice it fell upon the back of Numa, already weakening from the spear  point so near his heart.  The second stroke of the blade pierced far  into the beast's spine, and with a last convulsive sweep of the  fore-paws, in a vain attempt to reach his tormentor, Numa sprawled upon  the ground, paralyzed and dying.    Bukawai, fearful lest he should lose any recompense, followed Momaya  with the intention of persuading her to part with her ornaments of  copper and iron against her return with the price of the medicine--to  pay, as it were, for an option on his services as one pays a retaining  fee to an attorney, for, like an attorney, Bukawai knew the value of  his medicine and that it was well to collect as much as possible in  advance.    The witch-doctor came upon the scene as Tarzan leaped to meet the  lion's charge.  He saw it all and marveled, guessing immediately that  this must be the strange white demon concerning whom he had heard vague  rumors before Momaya came to him.    Momaya, now that the lion was past harming her or hers, gazed with new  terror upon Tarzan.  It was he who had stolen her Tibo.  Doubtless he  would attempt to steal him again.  Momaya hugged the boy close to her.  She was determined to die this time rather than suffer Tibo to be taken  from her again.    Tarzan eyed them in silence.  The sight of the boy clinging, sobbing,  to his mother aroused within his savage breast a melancholy loneliness.  There was none thus to cling to Tarzan, who yearned so for the love of  someone, of something.    At last Tibo looked up, because of the quiet that had fallen upon the  jungle, and saw Tarzan.  He did not shrink.    \"Tarzan,\" he said, in the speech of the great apes of the tribe of  Kerchak, \"do not take me from Momaya, my mother.  Do not take me again  to the lair of the hairy, tree men, for I fear Taug and Gunto and the  others.  Let me stay with Momaya, O Tarzan, God of the Jungle! Let me  stay with Momaya, my mother, and to the end of our days we will bless  you and put food before the gates of the village of Mbonga that you may  never hunger.\"    Tarzan sighed.    \"Go,\" he said, \"back to the village of Mbonga, and Tarzan will follow  to see that no harm befalls you.\"    Tibo translated the words to his mother, and the two turned their backs  upon the ape-man and started off toward home.  In the heart of Momaya  was a great fear and a great exultation, for never before had she  walked with God, and never had she been so happy.  She strained little  Tibo to her, stroking his thin cheek.  Tarzan saw and sighed again.    \"For Teeka there is Teeka's balu,\" he soliloquized; \"for Sabor there  are balus, and for the she-Gomangani, and for Bara, and for Manu, and  even for Pamba, the rat; but for Tarzan there can be none--neither a  she nor a balu.  Tarzan of the Apes is a man, and it must be that man  walks alone.\"    Bukawai saw them go, and he mumbled through his rotting face, swearing  a great oath that he would yet have the three fat goats, the new  sleeping mat, and the bit of copper wire.                                     6               The Witch-Doctor Seeks Vengeance    LORD GREYSTOKE was hunting, or, to be more accurate, he was shooting  pheasants at Chamston-Hedding. Lord Greystoke was immaculately and  appropriately garbed--to the minutest detail he was vogue.  To be sure,  he was among the forward guns, not being considered a sporting shot,  but what he lacked in skill he more than made up in appearance.  At the  end of the day he would, doubtless, have many birds to his credit,  since he had two guns and a smart loader--many more birds than he could  eat in a year, even had he been hungry, which he was not, having but  just arisen from the breakfast table.    The beaters--there were twenty-three of them, in white smocks--had but  just driven the birds into a patch of gorse, and were now circling to  the opposite side that they might drive down toward the guns.  Lord  Greystoke was quite as excited as he ever permitted himself to become.  There was an exhilaration in the sport that would not be denied.  He  felt his blood tingling through his veins as the beaters approached  closer and closer to the birds.  In a vague and stupid sort of way Lord  Greystoke felt, as he always felt upon such occasions, that he was  experiencing a sensation somewhat akin to a reversion to a prehistoric  type--that the blood of an ancient forbear was coursing hot through  him, a hairy, half-naked forbear who had lived by the hunt.    And far away in a matted equatorial jungle another Lord Greystoke, the  real Lord Greystoke, hunted.  By the standards which he knew, he, too,  was vogue--utterly vogue, as was the primal ancestor before the first  eviction.  The day being sultry, the leopard skin had been left behind.  The real Lord Greystoke had not two guns, to be sure, nor even one,  neither did he have a smart loader; but he possessed something  infinitely more efficacious than guns, or loaders, or even twenty-three  beaters in white smocks--he possessed an appetite, an uncanny  woodcraft, and muscles that were as steel springs.    Later that day, in England, a Lord Greystoke ate bountifully of things  he had not killed, and he drank other things which were uncorked to the  accompaniment of much noise.  He patted his lips with snowy linen to  remove the faint traces of his repast, quite ignorant of the fact that  he was an impostor and that the rightful owner of his noble title was  even then finishing his own dinner in far-off Africa.  He was not using  snowy linen, though.  Instead he drew the back of a brown forearm and  hand across his mouth and wiped his bloody fingers upon his thighs.  Then he moved slowly through the jungle to the drinking place, where,  upon all fours, he drank as drank his fellows, the other beasts of the  jungle.    As he quenched his thirst, another denizen of the gloomy forest  approached the stream along the path behind him.  It was Numa, the  lion, tawny of body and black of mane, scowling and sinister, rumbling  out low, coughing roars.  Tarzan of the Apes heard him long before he  came within sight, but the ape-man went on with his drinking until he  had had his fill; then he arose, slowly, with the easy grace of a  creature of the wilds and all the quiet dignity that was his birthright.    Numa halted as he saw the man standing at the very spot where the king  would drink.  His jaws were parted, and his cruel eyes gleamed.  He  growled and advanced slowly.  The man growled, too, backing slowly to  one side, and watching, not the lion's face, but its tail.  Should that  commence to move from side to side in quick, nervous jerks, it would be  well to be upon the alert, and should it rise suddenly erect, straight  and stiff, then one might prepare to fight or flee; but it did neither,  so Tarzan merely backed away and the lion came down and drank scarce  fifty feet from where the man stood.    Tomorrow they might be at one another's throats, but today there  existed one of those strange and inexplicable truces which so often are  seen among the savage ones of the jungle.  Before Numa had finished  drinking, Tarzan had returned into the forest, and was swinging away in  the direction of the village of Mbonga, the black chief.    It had been at least a moon since the ape-man had called upon the  Gomangani.  Not since he had restored little Tibo to his grief-stricken  mother had the whim seized him to do so.  The incident of the adopted  balu was a closed one to Tarzan.  He had sought to find something upon  which to lavish such an affection as Teeka lavished upon her balu, but  a short experience of the little black boy had made it quite plain to  the ape-man that no such sentiment could exist between them.    The fact that he had for a time treated the little black as he might  have treated a real balu of his own had in no way altered the vengeful  sentiments with which he considered the murderers of Kala.  The  Gomangani were his deadly enemies, nor could they ever be aught else.  Today he looked forward to some slight relief from the monotony of his  existence in such excitement as he might derive from baiting the blacks.    It was not yet dark when he reached the village and took his place in  the great tree overhanging the palisade.  From beneath came a great  wailing out of the depths of a near-by hut.  The noise fell  disagreeably upon Tarzan's ears--it jarred and grated.  He did not like  it, so he decided to go away for a while in the hopes that it might  cease; but though he was gone for a couple of hours the wailing still  continued when he returned.    With the intention of putting a violent termination to the annoying  sound, Tarzan slipped silently from the tree into the shadows beneath.  Creeping stealthily and keeping well in the cover of other huts, he  approached that from which rose the sounds of lamentation.  A fire  burned brightly before the doorway as it did before other doorways in  the village.  A few females squatted about, occasionally adding their  own mournful howlings to those of the master artist within.    The ape-man smiled a slow smile as he thought of the consternation  which would follow the quick leap that would carry him among the  females and into the full light of the fire.  Then he would dart into  the hut during the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10601"],[0,"The Rangeland Avenger (#19)"],[1," He shook with his emotion; Riley Sinclair shook with controlled  laughter.    \"Would you do all of that, partner? Well, I believe you'd try. What I  mean to say is this: No matter what they say, you can lay to it that  Sinclair has tried to play square and clean according to his own  lights, which ain't always the best in the world. So long!\"    There was no answer. He found himself looking down into the quivering  face of the schoolteacher.    \"Why, kid, you look all busted up!\"    \"Riley,\" gasped Jig very faintly, \"I can't go!\"    \"And why not?\"    \"Because I can't meet Jude.\"    \"Cartwright, eh? But you got to, sooner or later.\"    \"I'll die first.\"    \"Would your nerve hold you up through that?\"    \"So easily,\" said Jig. There was such a simple gravity and despair in  his expression that Sinclair believed it. He grunted and stared hard.    \"This Cartwright gent is worse'n death to you?\"    \"A thousand, thousand times!\"    \"How come?\"    \"I can't tell you.\"    \"I kind of wish,\" said Sinclair thoughtfully, \"that I'd kept my grip a  mite longer.\"    \"No, no!\"    \"You don't wish him dead?\"    Jig shuddered.    \"You plumb beat me, partner. And now you want to come along with me?\"  Sinclair grinned. \"An outlaw's life ain't what it's cracked up to be,  son. You'd last about a day doing what I have to do.\"    \"You'll find,\" said the schoolteacher eagerly, \"that I can stand it  amazingly well. I'll--I'll be far, far stronger than you expect!\"    \"Somehow I kind of believe it. But it's for your own fool sake, son,  that I don't want you along.\"    \"Let me try,\" pleaded Jig eagerly.    The other shook his head and seemed to change his mind in the very  midst of the gesture.    \"Why not?\" he asked himself. \"You'll get enough of it inside of a day.  And then you'll find out that they's some things about as bad as  death--or Cartwright. Come on, kid!\"          16      It was a weary ride that brought them to the end of that day and to a  camping place. It seemed to Jig that the world was made up of nothing  but the ups and downs of that mountain trail. Now, as the sun went  down, they came out on a flat shoulder of the mountain. Far below them  lay Sour Creek, long lost in the shadow of premature night which filled  the valley.    \"Here we are, fixed up as comfortable as can be,\" said Sinclair  cheerily. \"There's water, and there's wood aplenty. What could a gent  ask for more? And here's my country!\"    For a moment his expression softened as he looked over the black peaks  stepping away to the north. Now he pointed out a grove of trees, and on  the other side of the little plateau was heard the murmur of a feeble  spring.    Riley swung down easily from the saddle, but when Jig dismounted his  knees buckled with weariness, and he slipped down on a rock. He was  unheeded for a moment by the cowpuncher, who was removing from his  saddle the quarters of a deer which he had shot at the foot of the  mountain. When this task was ended, a stern voice brought Jig to his  feet.    \"What's all this? How come? Going to let that hoss stand there all  night with his saddle on? Hurry up!\"    \"All right,\" replied the schoolteacher, but his voice quaked with  weariness, and the cinch knot, drawn taut by the powerful hand of Jerry  Bent, refused to loosen. He struggled with it until his fingers ached,  and his panicky breath came in gasps of nervous excitement.    Presently he was aware of the tall, dark form of Sinclair behind him,  his saddle slung across his arm.    \"By guns,\" muttered Sinclair, \"it ain't possible! Not enough muscle to  untie a knot? It's a good thing that your father can't see the sort of  a son that he turned out. Lemme at that!\"    Under his strong fingers the knot gave by magic.    \"Now yank that saddle off and put it yonder with mine.\"    Jig pulled back the saddle, but when the full weight jerked down on him  he staggered, and he began to drag the heavy load.    \"Hey,\" cut in the voice of the tyrant, \"want to spoil that saddle, kid?  Lift it, can't you?\"    Gaspar obeyed with a start and, having placed it in the required  position, turned and waited guiltily.    \"Time you was learning something about camping out,\" declared the  cowpuncher, \"and I'll teach you. Take this ax and gimme some wood,  pronto!\"    He handed over a short ax, heavy-headed and small of haft.    \"That bush yonder! That's dead, or dead enough for us.\"    Plainly Jig was in awe of that ax. He carried it well out from his  side, as if he feared the least touch against his leg might mean a cut.  Of all this, Riley Sinclair was aware with a gradually darkening  expression. He had been partly won to Jig that day, but his better  opinion of the schoolteacher was being fast undermined.    With a gloomy eye he watched John Gaspar drop on his knees at the base  of the designated shrub and raise the ax slowly--in both hands! Not  only that, but the head remained poised, hung over the schoolteacher's  shoulder. When the blow fell, instead of striking solidly on the trunk  of the bush, it crashed futilely through a branch. Riley Sinclair drew  closer to watch. It was excusable, perhaps, for a man to be unable to  ride or to shoot or to face other men. But it was inconceivable that  any living creature should be so clumsy with a common ax.    To his consummate disgust the work of Jig became worse and worse. No  two blows fell on the same spot. The trunk of the little tree became  bruised, but even when the edge of the ax did not strike on a branch,  at most it merely sliced into the outer surface of the wood and left  the heart untouched. It was a process of gnawing, not of chopping. To  crown the terrible exhibition, Jig now rested from his labors and  examined the palms of his hands, which had become a bright red.    \"Gimme the ax,\" said Sinclair shortly. He dared not trust himself to  more speech and, snatching it from the hands of Cold Feet, buried the  blade into the very heart of the trunk. Another blow, driven home with  equal power and precision on the opposite side, made the tree shudder  to its top, and the third blow sent it swishing to the earth.    This brought a short cry of admiration and wonder from the  schoolteacher, for which Sinclair rewarded him with one glance of  contempt. With sweeping strokes he cleared away the half-dead branches.  Presently the trunk was naked. On it Riley now concentrated his attack,  making the short ax whistle over his shoulders. The trunk of the shrub  was divided into handy portions as if by magic.    Still John Gaspar stood by, gaping, apparently finding nothing to do.  And this with a camp barely started!    It was easier to do oneself, however, than to give directions to such  stupidity. Sinclair swept up an armful of wood and strode off to the  spot he had selected for the campfire, near the place where the spring  water ran into a small pool. A couple of big rocks thrown in place  furnished a windbreak. Between them he heaped dead twigs, and in a  moment the flame was leaping.    As soon as the fire was lighted they became aware that the night was  well nigh upon them. Hitherto the day had seemed some distance from its  final end, for there was still color in the sky, and the tops of the  western mountains were still bright. But with the presence of fire  brightness, the rest of the world became dim. The western peaks were  ghostly; the sky faded to the ashes of its former splendor; and Jig  found himself looking down upon thick night in the lower valleys. He  saw the eyes of the horses glistening, as they raised their heads to  watch. The gaunt form of Sinclair seemed enormous. Stooping about the  fire, enormous shadows drifted above and behind him. Sometimes the  light flushed over his lean face and glinted in his eyes. Again his  head was lost in shadow, and perhaps only the active, reaching hands  were illuminated brightly.    He prepared the deer meat with incomprehensible swiftness, at the same  time arranging the fire so that it rapidly burned down to a firm,  strong, level bed of coals, and by the time the bed of coals were  ready, the meat was prepared in thick steaks to broil over it.    In a little time the rich brown of the cooking venison streaked across  to Jig. He had kept at a distance up to this time, realizing that he  was in disgrace. Now he drifted near. He was rewarded by an amiable  grin from Riley Sinclair, whose ugly humor seemed to have vanished at  the odor of the broiling meat.    \"Watch this meat cook, kid, will you? There's something you can do that  don't take no muscle and don't take no knowledge. All you got to do is  to keep listening with your _nose_, and if you smell it burning, yank  her off. Understand? And don't let the fire blaze. She's apt to flare  up at the corners, you see? And these here twigs is apt to burn  through--these ones that keep the meat off'n the coals. Watch them,  too. And that's all you got to do. Can you manage all them things at  once?\"    Jig nodded gravely, as though he failed to see the contempt.    \"I seen a fine patch of grass down the hill a bit. I'm going to take  the hosses down there and hobble 'em out.\" Whistling, Sinclair strode  off down the hill, leading the horses after him.    The schoolteacher watched him go, and when the forms had vanished, and  only the echo of the whistling blew back, he looked up. The last life  was gone from the sunset. The last time he glanced up, there had been  only a few dim stars; now they had come down in multitudes, great  yellow planets and whole rifts of steel-blue stars.    He took from his pocket the old envelope which Sinclair had given him,  examined the scribbled confession, chuckling at the crude labor with  which the writing had been drawn out, and then deliberately stuffed the  paper into a corner of the fire. It flamed up, singeing the cooking  meat, but John Gaspar paid no heed. He was staring off down the hill to  make sure that Sinclair should not return in time to see that"]]]
