Not  long after he cut off their heads and he went up to the town and  directly to the house of Giambolan. When he arrived at the house, he  said, \"Good morning, Giambolan. Go and get your shield, headaxe and  spear, and boar's tusk armlet for we are going to fight here in your  yard.\" Giambolan got his headaxe and spears for he wanted to fight. As  soon as he arrived where Aponitolau was he threw his spears at him and  Aponitolau soon got all the spears which he threw. Then he tried to cut  off Aponitolau's head, but Aponitolau got his headaxe and said to him,  \"Now I am next, for you did not injure me at all,\" and Giambolan said,  \"Yes.\" Aponitolau commanded his headaxe and spear to go to Giambolan's  side as soon as he threw them; so Giambolan laid down and the headaxe  went and cut off Giambolan's ten heads.    As soon as Aponitolau had killed Giambolan he again commanded his  spear and headaxe to cut off the heads of all the people in the houses  and the headaxe and spear went and Aponitolau sat by the town waiting  for them. As soon as the spear and headaxe had killed all the people  who lived in the town they went back to him and Aponitolau said, \"You  heads of the people gather in one place, but you heads of Giambolan  and you heads of the women be separate from the others. You gather  by the house of Giambolan.\" Not long after all the heads gathered  and he said again, \"You heads of Giambolango first, and you heads  of the men precede the women. As soon as you arrive in Kadalayapan  stop by the gate of the town. You house of Giambolango go directly  to my house in Kadalayapan. Go with the big storm.\" So the house  went. \"You oranges of Giambolan come and follow us.\" So the oranges  followed them. He told them to go in front of his house. They went  and Aponitolau followed them, and the oranges followed him.    Not long after Aponitolau looked back and he saw the _alzados_  following him, for they wished to kill him. As soon as he saw them he  commanded his strike-a-light to become a high bank so the _alzados_  could not follow him. [181] So the strike-a-light became a high bank,  and the _alzados_ were on the other side and could not follow him. Not  long after he was near to Kadalayapan. As soon as he arrived there  he found all the heads near the gate of the town and he said to them,  \"You heads of Giambolan stay by the well, and you heads of the people  who lived with him gather here by the gate.\" He went to the town and  told the people to gather by the gate and play the _gansas_ and dance,  and he commanded someone to invite their friends in other towns. Not  long after the people from the other towns arrived in Kadalayapan,  and the people who lived there were still dancing. Aponitolau danced  with Danay of Kabisilan. The next was his son Kanag Kabagbagowan who  danced with five young girls who never go outdoors. As soon as they  had all danced they went to their towns. Then they put the heads  around the town of Kadalayapan.    (Told by Magwati of Lagangilang.)        8    Aponibolinayen and Aponitolau were anxious to make _Sayang_, [182]  so Aponitolau asked Aponibolinayen about his clout and his striped  belt. \"Well, you go and get them, for I am going to get the head  of the old man To-odan of Kalaskigan before we make _Sayang_.\" So  Aponibolinayen went to get his clout and belt. After that he oiled  his hair and Aponibolinayen put a golden bead on each hair. Not long  after he went to get his headaxe and spear. As soon as Aponibolinayen  gave him his provisions for the journey, he started.    When he was in the middle of the way he became very tired, for it was  far. So he used magic and he said, \"I use my power so that I will  arrive at once at the town of To-odan of Kalaskigan.\" Soon after  he arrived in Kalaskigan. When he arrived at the yard beside the  _balaua_ the old man was lying down. The old man saw him and said,  \"Eb, I have a man to eat.\" And Aponitolau said, \"You will never eat  me. Go and get your headaxe and spear, for you must fight with me. I  will take your head before I make _Sayang_.\" The old man was angry  and he stood up and went to get his headaxe and spear. \"You are the  only person who ever came in my town. Go on, and throw your spear,  if you are brave,\" said To-odan. \"If I am the first to throw my spear  you will never have a chance to throw yours, for I will kill you at  once. You better throw yours first,\" said Aponitolau. The old man was  angry, and he threw his spear. But his spear glanced off from the body  of Aponitolau, for he used his power so that everything glanced away  from his body. The old man To-odan ran toward him and tried to cut  off his head, but the headaxe could not cut Aponitolau, and the old  man To-odan said to him, \"You, truly, are a brave man, that was why  you came to my town. Try and throw your spear at me, for if you can  hit me it is all right, for I have killed many people.\" Aponitolau  threw his spear at his side, and it went clear through his body and  To-odan laid down. Aponitolau cut off his head.    Not long after Aponitolau went back home and Don Carlos of Kabaiganan  (Vigan) [183] was anxious to go and see Aponibolinayen. So he commanded  his spirit companions to be ready to go with him to Kadalayapan. As  soon as they were ready he said to them, \"You go first, my companions,  we are going to the town of Aponibolinayen, for I have heard that she  is a pretty woman, and I wish to see her.\" Not long after they arrived  at the river, and they got on to the raft. Soon they arrived at the  well of Kadalayapan and Indiapan was dipping water from the well, and  Don Carlos spoke to her. \"Is this the well of Aponibolinayen?\" Indiapan  said, \"Yes.\" \"Will you go and tell her to come here and see what I  have to sell?\" Indiapan went up to the town and said \"Aponibolinayen,  Don Carlos wants you to see what he has to sell.\" \"I don't wish to  go and see what he has to sell.\" So Indiapan went back to the well  and said to Don Carlos \"Aponibolinayen does not wish to come, and  she does not wish to buy what you have to sell.\" So he pondered what  he should do. \"The best thing for me to do is to go to their house  to get a drink.\" So he went up to the town and said, \"Good morning,  Aponibolinayen, will you give me some water to drink? For a long time I  have wished to drink your water.\" Aponibolinayen answered, \"Why did you  come from the well? Why did you not drink while you were there?\" \"I did  not drink there, for I wished to drink of your water.\" Aponibolinayen  did not give him any for she was afraid; then Don Carlos used magic so  that she dropped her needle. The needle dropped and she said to him,  \"Will you hand the needle which I dropped to me, Don Carlos.\" So Don  Carlos picked up the needle and he put a love charm on it, and he gave  it to her. [184] Not long after Don Carlos wanted to go back home,  but Aponibolinayen would not let him go, and she said, \"Come up in  the house.\" So he went up into the house.    Not long after Aponitolau shouted near to the town and he did not hear  Aponibolinayen answer. As soon as he reached the gate of the town  he shouted again, and she did not answer, for Don Carlos was with  her. Not long after Don Carlos went home and Aponibolinayen saw his  belt which he had left, for he was in a hurry. So she ran and got the  ladder to the rice granary, and she hid the belt. Aponitolau met Don  Carlos at the gate of the town and he asked him why he had gone into  the town, and he answered, \"I want to sell something.\" Not long after  Aponitolau went to their house and asked Aponibolinayen why she did  not reply to him when he shouted two times. \"I did not answer, for I  have a headache.\" \"Why is the fastening on the door different from  before?\" \"I don't know. No one came in.\" Not long after Aponitolau  went up into the house. \"Now, Aponibolinayen, I have taken the head  of the old man To-odan of Kalaskigan. You command the people to begin  to pound rice, for we will make _Sayang_\"    Not long after Aponitolau saw a flame of fire in the rice granary  and he said, \"Why is there a fire in the rice granary?\" So he ran to  see. Not long after he went inside of the granary and he saw what it  was. As soon as he saw that it was a golden belt he said, \"I think  this is the belt of the man who came here while I was gone.\" So he  took it and hid it and did not let Aponibolinayen see it. Not long  after they commanded the people to go and get betel-nuts. When they  arrived with the fruit they oiled them and Aponitolau said, \"Tell me  whom we shall invite beside our relatives in the other towns.\" And  Aponibolinayen told him to invite Don Carlos of Kabaiganan, for she  wished always to see him. So they sent a betel-nut to go and get Don  Carlos, and they sent one to the old woman Alokotan of Nagbotobotan  and Awig of Natpangan and other towns.    Not long after the betel-nut reached the place where Don Carlos lived  and it met his spirit helpers. As soon as the betel-nut reached Don  Carlos, \"Aponitolau and Aponibolinayen are making _Sayang_, and I came  to invite you.\" \"All right, you go first. I will dress and go after  you,\" he said. Not long after he dressed up and went to follow the  betel-nuts. Not long after all the other people from the other towns  arrived where they were making _Sayang_ and Aponitolau tried to put  the belt on each person to see if it fitted and no one was the right  size. As soon as Don Carlos arrived Aponitolau tried the belt on him  and it was all right. So Aponitolau gave him the belt and he got a  golden chair and he put it in the middle of the party and made Don  Carlos sit on it. All of the people were dancing and Aponitolau went  and sharpened his headaxe. Not long after, \"Ala, you Aponibolinayen  take Kanag and Alama-an with you and dance with Don Carlos.\" Not  long after they danced. While they were dancing Aponitolau cut off  the head"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12561"],[0,"A Visit to the Holy Land, Egypt, and Italy (#19)"],[1,"kins, which my entertainers coolly  discussed rind and all, and burnt hazel-nuts.  The bread, which is  flat like pancakes, is not baked in ovens, but laid on metal plates  or hot stones, and turned when one side is sufficiently done.  It  tastes better than I should have expected. {101}    Our conversation during dinner was most interesting.  Some of the  family spoke a little Italian, but this little was pronounced with  such a strong Greek accent, that I was obliged to guess at the  greater portion of what was said.  No doubt they had to do the same  with me.  The worthy Consul, indeed, affirmed that he knew French  very well; but for this evening at least, his memory seemed to have  given him the slip.  Much was spoken, and little understood.  The  same thing is said often to be the case in learned societies; so it  was not of much consequence.    There are many different kinds of cucumber in Syria, where they are  a favourite dish with rich and poor.  I found numerous varieties,  but none that I found superior to our German one.  Another favourite  fruit is the water-melon, here called \"bastek.\"  These also I found  neither larger in size nor better flavoured than the melons I had  eaten in southern Hungary.    The Consul's house seems sufficiently large; but the architectural  arrangement is so irregular that the extended area contains but few  rooms and very little comfort.  The apartments are lofty and large,  extremely ill-furnished, and not kept in the best possible order.    I slept in the apartment of the married daughter; but had it not  been for the beds standing round, I should rather have looked upon  it as an old store-closet than a lady's sleeping-room.    May 28th.    At five o'clock in the morning Mr. Bartlett's servant came to fetch  me away, as we were at once to continue our journey.  I betook  myself to the house of the English Consul, where I found neither a  horse nor any thing else prepared for our departure.  It is  necessary to look calmly upon these irregularities here in the East,  where it is esteemed a fortunate occurrence if the horses and mukers  (as the drivers of horses and donkeys are called) are only a few  hours behind their time.  Thus our horses made their appearance at  half-past five instead of at four, the hour for which they had been  ordered.  Our baggage was soon securely fixed, for we left the  greater portion of our effects at Joppa, and took with us only what  was indispensably necessary.    As the clock struck six we rode out of the gate of Joppa, and  immediately afterwards reached a large well with a marble basin.  Near places of this description a great number of people are always  congregated, and more women and girls are seen than appear  elsewhere.    The dress of females belonging to the lower orders consists of a  long blue garment fastened round the throat, and reaching below the  ankle.  They completely cover the head and face, frequently without  even leaving openings for the eyes.  Some females, on the other  hand, go abroad with their faces totally uncovered.  These are,  however, exceptional cases.    The women carry their water-pitchers on their head or shoulder, as  their ancestors have done for thousands of years, in the manner we  find represented in the oldest pictures.  But unfortunately I could  discover neither the grace in their gait, the dignity in their  movements, nor the physical beauty in their appearance, that I had  been led to expect.  On the contrary, I found squalor and poverty  more prevalent than I had thought possible.  We rode on amid the  gardens, every moment meeting a little caravan of camels.  Immediately beyond the gardens we descry the fruitful valley of  Sharon, extending more than eight miles in length, and to a still  greater distance in breadth.  Here and there we find villages built  on hills, and the whole presents the appearance of an extremely  fertile and well-populated region.  In all directions we saw large  herds of sheep and goats; the latter generally of a black or brown  colour, with long pendent ears.    The foreground of the picture is formed by the Judaean mountains, a  range apparently composed of a number of barren rocks.    A ride of two hours through this plain, which is less sandy than the  immediate neighbourhood of Joppa, brought us to a mosque, where we  made halt for a quarter of an hour and ate our breakfast, consisting  of some hard-boiled eggs, a piece of bread, and a draught of  lukewarm water from the cistern.  Our poor beasts fared even worse  than ourselves--they received nothing but water.    On leaving this place to resume our journey across the plain, we not  only suffered dreadfully from the heat, which had reached 30 degrees  Reaumur, but were further persecuted by a species of minute gnats,  which hovered round us in large swarms, crept into our noses and  ears, and annoyed us in such a manner that it required the utmost of  our patience and determination to prevent us from turning back at  once.  Fortunately we only met with these tormentors in those parts  where the corn had been cut and was still in the fields.  They are  not much larger than a pin's head, and look more like flies than  gnats.  They are always met with in great swarms, and sting so  sharply that they frequently raise large boils.    The vegetation was at this season already in so forward a state that  we frequently passed stubble-fields, and found that the wheat had in  several cases been already garnered up.  Throughout the whole of  Syria, and in that part of Egypt whither my journey afterwards led  me, I never once saw corn or vegetables, wood or stores, carried in  wagons; they were invariably borne by horses or asses.  In Syria I  could understand the reason of this proceeding.  With the exception,  perhaps, of the eight or ten miles across the valley of Sharon, the  road is too stony and uneven to admit the passage of the lightest  and smallest carts.  In Egypt, however, this is not the case, and  yet wagons have not been introduced.    A most comical effect was produced when we met long processions of  small donkeys, so completely laden with corn, that neither their  heads nor their feet remained visible.  The sheaves seemed to be  moving spontaneously, or to be propelled by the power of steam.  Frequently after a train of this kind has passed, lofty grey heads  appear, surrounded by a load piled up to so great a height, that one  would suppose large corn-wagons were approaching rather than the  \"ship of the desert,\" the camel.  The traveller's attention is  continually attracted to some novel and curious object totally  dissimilar to any thing he has seen at home.    Towards ten o'clock we arrived at Ramla, a place situate on a little  hill, and discernible from a great distance.  Before reaching the  town, we had to pass through an olive-wood.  Leaving our horses  beneath a shady tree, we entered the coppice on the right:  a walk  of about a quarter of a mile brought us to the \"Tower of the Forty  Martyrs,\" which was converted into a church during the time of the  Knights Templars, and now serves as a dwelling for dervishes.  It is  a complete ruin, and I could scarcely believe that it was still  habitable.    We made no stay at Ramda, a place only remarkable for a convent  built, it is said, on the site of Joseph of Arimathea's house.    The Syrian convents are built more like fortresses than like  peaceful dwellings.  They are usually surrounded by strong and lofty  walls, furnished with loopholes for cannon.  The great gate is kept  continually closed, and barred and bolted from within for greater  security; a little postern is opened to admit visitors, but even  this is only done in time of peace, and when there is no fear of the  plague.    At length, towards noon, we approached the mountains of Judaea.  Here we must bid farewell to the beautiful fruitful valley and to  the charming road, and pursue our journey through a stony region,  which we do not pass without difficulty.    At the entrance of the mountain-chain lies a miserable village; near  this village is a well, and here we halted to refresh ourselves and  water our poor horses.  It was not without a great deal of trouble  and some expense that we managed to obtain a little water; for all  the camels, asses, goats, and sheep from far and wide were collected  here, eagerly licking up every drop of the refreshing element they  could secure.  Little did I think that I should ever be glad to  quench my thirst with so disgusting a beverage as the muddy, turbid,  and lukewarm water they gave me from this well.  We once more filled  our leathern bottles, and proceeded with fresh courage up the stony  path, which quickly became so narrow, that without great difficulty  and danger we could not pass the camels which we frequently met.  Fortunately a few camels out of every herd are generally provided  with bells, so that their approach is heard at some distance, and  one can prepare for them accordingly.    The Bedouins and Arabs generally wear no garment but a shirt barely  reaching to the knee.  Their head is protected by a linen cloth, to  which a thick rope wound twice round the head gives a very good  effect.  A few have a striped jacket over their shirt, and the rich  men or chiefs frequently wear turbans.    Our road now continues to wind upwards, through ravines between  rocks and mountains, and over heaps of stones.  Here and there  single olive-trees are seen sprouting from the rocky clefts.  Ugly  as this tree is, it still forms a cheerful feature in the desert  places where it grows.  Now and then we climbed hills whence we had  a distant view of the sea.  These glimpses increase the awe which  inspires the traveller when he considers on what ground he is  wandering, and whither he is bending his steps.  Every step we now  take leads us past places of religious importance; every ruin, every  fragment of a fortress or tower, above"]]]
