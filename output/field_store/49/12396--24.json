Ragusa, since the great  earthquake in 1667, had greatly declined in power and was no longer of  international importance. In Montenegro, on the other hand, there had  survived both a greater independence of spirit (Montenegro was, after all,  the ancient Zeta, and had always been a centre of national life) and a  number of at any rate eugenic if not exactly aristocratic Serb families;  these families naturally looked on themselves and on their bishop as  destined to play an important part in the resistance to and the eventual  overthrow of the Turkish dominion. The prince-bishop had to be consecrated  by the Patriarch of Pe['c], and in 1700 Patriarch Arsen III consecrated  one Daniel, of the house (which has been ever since then and is now still  the reigning dynasty of Montenegro) of Petrovi['c]-Njego[)s], to this  office, after he had been elected to it by the council of notables at  Cetinje. Montenegro, isolated from the Serbs in the north, and precluded  from participating with them in the wars between Austria and Turkey by the  intervening block of Bosnia, which though Serb by nationality was solidly  Mohammedan and therefore pro-Turkish, carried on its feuds with the Turks  independently of the other Serbs. But when Peter the Great initiated his  anti-Turkish policy, and, in combination with the expansion of Russia to  the south and west, began to champion the cause of the Balkan Christians,  he developed intercourse with Montenegro and laid the foundation of that  friendship between the vast Russian Empire and the tiny Serb principality  on the Adriatic which has been a quaint and persistent feature of eastern  European politics ever since. This intimacy did not prevent the Turks  giving Montenegro many hard blows whenever they had the time or energy to  do so, and did not ensure any special protective clauses in favour of the  mountain state whenever the various treaties between Russia and Turkey  were concluded. Its effect was rather psychological and financial. From  the time when the _Vladika_ (= Bishop) Daniel first visited Peter the  Great, in 1714, the rulers of Montenegro often made pilgrimages to the  Russian capital, and were always sure of finding sympathy as well as  pecuniary if not armed support. Bishops in the Orthodox Church are  compulsorily celibate, and the succession in Montenegro always descended  from uncle to nephew. When Peter I Petrovi['c]-Njego[)s] succeeded, in  1782, the Patriarchate of Pe['c] was no more, so he had to get permission  from the Austrian Emperor Joseph II to be consecrated by the Metropolitan  of Karlovci (Carlowitz), who was then head of the Serbian national Church.    About the same time (1787) an alliance was made between Russia and  Austria-Hungary to make war together on Turkey and divide the spoils  between them. Although a great rising against Turkey was organised at the  same time (1788) in the district of [)S]umadija, in Serbia, by a number of  Serb patriots, of whom Kara-George was one and a certain Captain Ko[)c]a,  after whom the whole war is called Ko[)c]ina Krajina (=Ko[)c]a's country),  another, yet the Austrians were on the whole unsuccessful, and on the  death of Joseph II, in 1790, a peace was concluded between Austria and  Turkey at Svishtov, in Bulgaria, by which Turkey retained the whole of  Bosnia and Serbia, and the Save and Danube remained the frontier between  the two countries. Meanwhile the Serbs of Montenegro had joined in the  fray and had fared better, inflicting some unpleasant defeats on the Turks  under their bishop, Peter I. These culminated in two battles in 1796 (the  Montenegrins, not being mentioned in the treaty of peace, had continued  fighting), in which the Turks were driven back to Scutari. With this  triumph, which the Emperor Paul of Russia signalized by decorating the  Prince-Bishop Peter, the independence of the modern state of Montenegro,  the first Serb people to recover its liberty, was _de facto_ established.        17    _The Liberation of Serbia under Kara-George_ (1804-13) _and Milo[)s]  Obrenovi['c]_ (1815-30): 1796-1830      The liberation of Serbia from the Turkish dominion and its establishment  as an independent state were matters of much slower and more arduous  accomplishment than were the same processes in the other Balkan countries.  One reason for this was that Serbia by its peculiar geographical position  was cut off from outside help. It was easy for the western powers to help  Greece with their fleets, and for Russia to help Rumania and, later,  Bulgaria directly with its army, because communication between them was  easy. But Serbia on the one hand was separated from the sea, first by  Dalmatia, which was always in foreign possession, and then by Bosnia,  Hercegovina, and the _sandjak_ (or province) of Novi-Pazar, all of which  territories, though ethnically Serb, were strongholds of Turkish influence  owing to their large Mohammedan population. The energies of Montenegro,  also cut off from the sea by Dalmatia and Turkey, were absorbed in  self-defence, though it gave Serbia all the support which its size  permitted. Communication, on the other hand, between Russia and Serbia was  too difficult to permit of military help being rapidly and effectively  brought to bear upon the Turks from that quarter. Bessarabia, Wallachia,  and Moldavia were then still under Turkish control, and either they had to  be traversed or the Danube had to be navigated from its mouth upwards  through Turkish territory. The only country which could have helped Serbia  was Austria, but as it was against their best interests to do so, the  Austrians naturally did all they could not to advance, but to retard the  Serbian cause. As a result of all this Serbia, in her long struggle  against the Turks, had to rely principally on its own resources, though  Russian diplomacy several times saved the renascent country from disaster.    Another reason for the slowness of the emancipation and development of  modern Serbia has been the proneness of its people to internal dissension.  There was no national dynasty on whom the leadership of the country would  naturally devolve after the first successful revolution against Turkish  rule, there was not even any aristocracy left, and no foreign ruler was  ever asked for by the Serbs or was ever imposed on them by the other  nations as in the case of Greece, Rumania, and Bulgaria. On the other hand  the rising against Turkey was a rising of the whole people, and it was  almost inevitable that as soon as some measure of independence was gained  the unity the Serbs had shown when fighting against their oppressors  should dissolve and be replaced by bitter rivalries and disputes amongst  the various local leaders who had become prominent during the rebellion.    These rivalries early in the nineteenth century resolved themselves into a  blood-feud between two families, the Karagjorgjevi['c] and the  Obrenovi['c], a quarrel that filled Serbian history and militated against  the progress of the Serb people throughout the nineteenth century.    The same reasons which restricted the growth of the political independence  of Serbia have also impeded, or rather made impossible, its economic  development and material prosperity. Until recent years Austria-Hungary  and Turkey between them held Serbia territorially in such a position that  whenever Serbia either demurred at its neighbours' tariffs or wished to  retaliate by means of its own, the screw was immediately applied and  economic strangulation threatened. Rumania and Bulgaria economically could  never be of help to Serbia, because the products and the requirements of  all three are identical, and Rumania and Bulgaria cannot be expected to  facilitate the sale of their neighbours' live stock and cereals, when  their first business is to sell their own, while the cost of transit of  imports from western Europe through those countries is prohibitive.    After the unsuccessful rebellion of 1788, already mentioned, Serbia  remained in a state of pseudo-quiescence for some years. Meanwhile the  authority of the Sultan in Serbia was growing ever weaker and the real  power was wielded by local Turkish officials, who exploited the country,  looked on it as their own property, and enjoyed semi-independence. Their  exactions and cruelties were worse than had been those of the Turks in the  old days, and it was against them and their troops, not against those of  the Sultan, that the first battles in the Serbian war of independence were  fought. It was during the year 1803 that the Serbian leaders first made  definite plans for the rising which eventually took place in the following  year. The ringleader was George Petrovi['c], known as Black George, or  Kara-George, and amongst his confederates was Milo[)s] Obrenovi['c]. The  centre of the conspiracy was at Topola, in the district of [)S]umadija in  central Serbia (between the Morava and the Drina rivers), the native place  of Kara-George. The first two years of fighting between the Serbians and,  first, the provincial janissaries, and, later, the Sultan's forces, fully  rewarded the bravery and energy of the insurgents. By the beginning of  1807 they had virtually freed all northern Serbia by their own unaided  efforts and captured the towns of Po[)z]arevac, Smederevo, Belgrade, and  [)S]abac. The year 1804 is also notable as the date of the formal opening  of diplomatic relations directly between Serbia and Russia. At this time  the Emperor Alexander I was too preoccupied with Napoleon to be able to  threaten the Sultan (Austerlitz took place in November 1805), but he gave  the Serbs financial assistance and commended their cause to the especial  care of his ambassador at Constantinople.    In 1807 war again broke out between Russia and Turkey, but after the Peace  of Tilsit (June 1807) fighting ceased also between the Turks and the  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11718"],[0,"The Camp Fire Girls at School; Or, The Wohelo Weavers (#19)"],[1,"when the  election came and went and he was not taken in. He knew from reliable  sources that his name was coming up to be voted on, and it was not very  flattering to realize that he had been blackballed. From an eager  interest in all Thessalonian doings his feeling changed to bitter  resentment against the society. Just now the Thessalonian play was the  topic of the hour, and the very mention of it almost made him ill. If he  had been elected he would have been an usher at the play with the other  new members and worn the club colors in his buttonhole to be admired by  the girls and envied by the other fellows. But now there was none of  that charmed fellowship for him. He nourished his feeling of bitterness  and hatred until his scheming mind began to grope for some way of  spoiling the success of the play. As usual, he turned to his friend,  Abraham Goldstein, who was about the only one who had not shown any  coolness. Together they watched their chance. The play progressed toward  perfection, the dress rehearsal had been held, the day of the \"First  Night\" had arrived. The stage was set and the statue of the Maid of  Orleans was in place. Joe, poking around the back of the stage, saw the  statue and received his evil inspiration.    Just about the time the play was given there was being held in the  school an exhibition of water-color paintings. A famous and very  valuable collection had been loaned by a friend of the school for the  benefit of the students of drawing. The paintings were on display in one  of the girls' club rooms on the fourth floor of the building. Hinpoha  took great pleasure in examining them and spent a long time over them  every day after school was closed. On the day of the play she went up as  usual to the club room for an hour before going home. Reluctantly she  tore herself away when she realized that the afternoon was passing. As  she returned to the cloakroom where her wraps were she was surprised to  find Emily Meeks there. Emily started guiltily when Hinpoha entered and  made a desperate effort to finish wrapping up something she had in her  hand. But her nervousness got into her fingers and made them tremble so  that the object she held fell to the floor. As it fell the wrapper came  open and Hinpoha could see what it was. It was one of the water colors  of the exhibition collection, one of the smallest and most exquisite  ones. Hinpoha gasped with astonishment when she caught Emily in the act  of stealing it. Emily Meeks was the last person in the world Hinpoha  would ever have accused of stealing anything.    Emily turned white and red by turns and leaned against the wall  trembling. \"Yes, I stole it,\" she said in a kind of desperation.    Something in her voice took the scorn out of Hinpoha's face. She looked  at her curiously. \"Why did you try to steal, Emily?\" she asked gently.    Emily burst into tears and sank to her knees. \"You wouldn't understand,\"  she sobbed.    \"Maybe I would,\" said Hinpoha softly, \"try it and see.\"    Haltingly Emily told her tale. In a moment's folly she had promised to  buy a set of books from an agent and had signed a paper pledging herself  to pay for it within three months. The price was five dollars. At the  time she thought she could save enough out of her meager wages to pay  it, but found that she could not. The time was up several months ago and  the agent was threatening her with a lawsuit if she did not pay up this  month. Fearing that the people with whom she lived would be angry if  they heard of the affair and would turn her out of her home into the  streets--for to her a lawsuit was something vague and terrible and she  thought she would have to go to jail when it was found she could not  pay--she grew desperate, and being alone in the room with the paintings  for an instant she had seized the opportunity and carried one out under  her middy blouse. She intended to sell it and pay for the books.    Hinpoha's eyes filled with tears at Emily's distress. She was very  tender hearted and was easily touched by other people's troubles. \"If I  lent you five dollars to pay for the books, would you take it?\" she  asked.    Emily started up like a condemned prisoner who is pardoned on the way to  execution. \"I'll pay it back,\" she cried, \"if I have to go out scrubbing  to earn the money. And you won't say anything about the picture,\" she  said, clasping her hands beseechingly, \"if I put it back where I got  it?\"    \"No,\" said Hinpoha, with all the conviction of her loyal young nature,  \"I give you my word of honor that I will never say anything about it.\"    \"Oh, you're an angel straight from heaven,\" exclaimed Emily.    \"First time I've heard of a red-headed angel,\" laughed Hinpoha.    Emily stooped to pick up the painting and restore it to its place, when  she caught her breath in dismay. She had dropped a tear on the picture  and made a light spot on the dark brown trunk of a tree. It was  conspicuously noticeable, and would be sure to call forth the strictest  inquiry. Emily covered her face with her hands. \"It's my punishment,\"  she groaned, \"for trying to steal. Now I've ruined the honor of the  school. We promised to send those pictures back unharmed if Mr. White  would let us have them.\" Her dismay was intense.    Hinpoha examined the spot carefully. \"Do you know,\" she said, \"I believe  I could fill in that place with dark color so it would never be noticed?  The bark of the tree has a rough appearance and the slight unevenness  around the edges of the spot will never be noticed. Don't worry, all  will yet be well.\" If Hinpoha would have let her, Emily would have gone  down on her knees to her. \"Come, we must make haste,\" said Hinpoha. \"You  go right home and I will take the picture into our club room and fix it  up and then slip upstairs with it and nobody will ever be any the wiser.  It's a good thing there's nobody up there now.\"    Emily took her departure, vowing undying gratitude to Hinpoha, and  Hinpoha took her paints from her desk and went into her own club room,  which was on the third floor, and with infinite pains matched the shade  of the tree trunk and repaired the damage. Her efforts were crowned with  better success even than she had hoped for, and with thankfulness in her  heart at the talent which could thus be turned to account to help a  friend out of trouble, she surveyed the little painting, looking just as  it did when loaned to the school. She carried it carefully upstairs, but  at the door of the exhibition room she paused in dismay. A whole group  of teachers and their friends were looking at the paintings and it was  impossible to put the one back without being noticed. Irresolutely she  turned away and retraced her steps to the third floor, intending to wait  in her club room until the coast was clear. But alas! In coming out  Hinpoha had left the door open. The club rooms were generally kept  locked. While she was going upstairs a number of students coming out  from late practice in the gymnasium spied the open door and went in to  look around. It was impossible for Hinpoha to go in there with that  picture in her hand. The only thing to do if she did not wish to get  into trouble, was to get rid of it immediately. Delay was getting  dangerous. She was standing near the back entrance of the stage when she  was looking for a place to hide the picture. Beside the stage entrance  there was a little room containing all the lighting switches for the  stage, various battery boxes and other electrical equipment, together  with a motley collection of stage properties. Quick as a flash Hinpoha  opened the door of this room, darted in and hid the picture in a roll of  cheesecloth. When she came out one of the teachers was standing directly  before the door, pointing out to a friend the construction of the stage.    \"Have we a new electrician?\" he inquired genially, as he saw her coming  out of the electric room. Hinpoha laughed at his pleasantry, but she was  flushed and uncomfortable from the excitement of the last moment.  Hinpoha was a poor dissembler. She went upstairs until the art room was  empty of visitors and then returned swiftly to the electric room for the  picture. She slipped it under her middy blouse, where it was safe from  detection, and sped upstairs with it. As she crossed the hall to the  stairs she met the same teacher the second time. \"Well, you must be an  electrician,\" he said; \"that's twice you've rushed out of there in such  a businesslike manner,\" Hinpoha laughed, but flushed painfully. It  seemed to her that his eyes could look right through her middy and see  the picture underneath. This time the coast was clear in the room where  the pictures were and she deposited the adventurous water color safely.  She heaved a great sigh of relief when she realized that the danger was  over and she had nothing more to conceal. She trudged home through the  snow light-heartedly, with a warm feeling that she had been the means of  saving a friend from disgrace.    Sahwah, who was in the play and had a right to go up on the stage, which  was all ready set for the first scene, ran in to see how things looked  late in the afternoon. The school was practically empty. All the rest of  the cast had gone home to get some sleep to fit them for the ordeal of  the coming performance, and the teachers who had been looking at the  paintings had also left. The rest of the building was in darkness, as  twilight had already fallen. One set of lights was burning on the stage.  Sahwah had no special business on the stage, she was simply curious to  see what it looked like. Sahwah never stopped to analyze her motives for  doing things. She paused to admire the statue of Joan of Arc, standing  in all the majesty of its nine-foot height. This was the first chance  she had had to examine it leisurely. In the rehearsal the night before  she had merely seen it in a general way as she whisked off and on the"]]]
