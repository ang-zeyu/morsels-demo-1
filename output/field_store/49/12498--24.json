Lincoln looked at the pig and the mud that enveloped  him, and then looked ruefully at some new clothes in which he had but a  short time before enveloped himself. Deciding against the claims of the  pig he rode on; but he could not get rid of the vision of the poor  brute, and at last, after riding two miles, he turned back, determined  to rescue the animal at the expense of his new clothes. Arrived at the  spot, he tied his horse, and coolly went to work to build of old rails a  passage to the bottom of the hole. Descending on these rails, he seized  the pig and dragged him out, but not without serious damage to the  clothes he wore. Washing his hands in the nearest brook and wiping them  on the grass, he mounted his gig and rode along. He then fell to  examining the motive that sent him back to the release of the pig. At  the first thought it seemed to be pure benevolence; but at length he  came to the conclusion that it was selfishness, for he certainly went to  the pig's relief in order (as he said to the friend to whom he related  the incident) to 'take a pain out of his own mind.'\"    Instances showing the integrity, candor, unselfishness, and humanity of  Lincoln's conduct in his law practice could be multiplied indefinitely.  The following are given by Dr. Holland: \"The lawyers of Springfield,  particularly those who had political aspirations, were afraid to  undertake the defense of anyone who had been engaged in helping off  fugitives slaves. It was a very unpopular business in those days and in  that locality; and few felt that they could afford to engage in it. One  who needed such aid went to Edward D. Baker, and was refused, distinctly  and frankly on the ground that as a political man he could not afford  it. The man applied to an ardent anti-slavery friend for advice. He  spoke of Mr. Lincoln, and said, 'He's not afraid of an unpopular case.  When I go for a lawyer to defend an arrested fugitive slave, other  lawyers will refuse me. But if Mr. Lincoln is at home he will always  take my case.'\"    An old woman of seventy-five years, the widow of a revolutionary  pensioner, came tottering into his law office one day, and told him that  a certain pension agent had charged her the exorbitant fee of two  hundred dollars for collecting her pension. Lincoln was satisfied by  her representations that she had been swindled, and finding that she was  not a resident of the town, and that she was poor, gave her money, and  set about the work of procuring restitution. He immediately entered suit  against the agent to recover a portion of his ill-gotten money. This  suit was one of the most remarkable that Lincoln ever conducted. The day  before the case came up he asked his partner, Mr. Herndon, to get him a  \"Life of Washington,\" and he spent the whole afternoon reading it. His  speech to the jury was long remembered. The whole court-room was in  tears as he closed with these words: \"Gentlemen of the jury. Time rolls  by. The heroes of '76 have passed away. They are encamped on the other  shore. This soldier has gone to his rest, and now, crippled, blinded,  and broken, his widow comes to you and to me, gentlemen of the jury, to  right her wrongs. She was not always as you see her now. Once her step  was elastic. Her face was fair. Her voice was as sweet as any that rang  in the mountains of old Virginia. Now she is old. She is poor and  defenceless. Out here on the prairies of Illinois, hundreds of miles  from the scenes of her childhood, she appeals to you and to me who enjoy  the privileges achieved for us by the patriots of the Revolution for our  sympathetic aid and manly protection. I have but one question to ask  you, gentlemen of the jury. Shall we befriend her?\" During the speech  the defendant sat huddled up in the court-room, writhing under the lash  of Lincoln's tongue. The jury returned a verdict for every cent that  Lincoln had asked. He became the old lady's surety for costs, paid her  hotel bill and sent her home rejoicing. He made no charges for his own  or his partner's services. A few days afterwards Mr. Herndon picked up a  little scrap of paper in the office. He looked at it a moment, and burst  into a roar of laughter. It was Lincoln's notes for the argument of this  case. They were unique:--\"No contract--Not professional  services--Unreasonable charges--Money retained by Deft not given by  Pl'ff.--Revolutionary War--Describe Valley Forge--Ice--Soldiers'  bleeding feet--Pl'ff's husband--Soldiers leaving home for the  army--_Skin Def't_--Close.\"    In his Autobiography, Joseph Jefferson tells how he visited Springfield  with a theatrical company in the early days (1839) and planned to open a  theatrical season in that godly town. But \"a religious revival was in  progress, and the fathers of the church not only launched forth against  us in their sermons, but got the city to pass a new law enjoining a  heavy license against our 'unholy' calling. I forget the amount, but it  was large enough to be prohibitory.\" The company had begun the building  of a new theatre; and naturally the situation was perplexing. In the  midst of their trouble, says Mr. Jefferson, \"a young lawyer called on  the Managers. He had heard of the injustice, and offered, if they would  place the matter in his hands, to have the license taken off,--declaring  that he only wanted to see fair play, and he would accept no fee whether  he failed or succeeded. The case was brought up before the council. The  young lawyer began his harangue. He handled the subject with tact,  skill, and humor, tracing the history of the drama from the time when  Thespis acted in a cart, to the stage of to-day. He illustrated his  speech with a number of anecdotes, and kept the council in a roar of  laughter. His good humor prevailed, and the exorbitant tax was taken  off. This young lawyer was very popular in Springfield, and was honored  and beloved by all who knew him; and after the time of which I write he  held rather an important position in the Government of the United  States. He now lies buried in Springfield, under a monument  commemorating his greatness and his virtues,--and his name was Abraham  Lincoln.\"    Judge Gillespie tells a good story, to the effect that Lincoln and  General U.P. Linder were once defending a man who was being tried on a  criminal charge before Judge David Davis, who said at dinner-time that  the case must be disposed of that night. Lincoln suggested that the best  thing they could do would be to run Benedict, the prosecuting attorney,  as far into the night as possible, in hopes that he might, in his rage,  commit some indiscretion that would help their case. Lincoln began, but  to save his life he could not speak one hour, and the laboring oar fell  into Linder's hands. \"But,\" said Lincoln, \"he was equal to the occasion.  He spoke most interestingly three mortal hours, about everything in the  world. He discussed Benedict from head to foot, and put in about  three-quarters of an hour on the subject of Benedict's whiskers.\"  Lincoln said he never envied a man so much as he did Linder on that  occasion. He thought he was inimitable in his capacity to talk  interestingly about everything and nothing, by the hour.    But if Lincoln had not General Linder's art of \"talking against time,\"  his wit often suggested some readier method of gaining advantage in a  case. On one occasion, a suit was on trial in the Circuit Court of  Sangamon County, in which Lincoln was attorney for the plaintiff, and  Mr. James C. Conkling, then a young man just entering practice, was  attorney for the defendant. It was a jury trial, and Lincoln waived the  opening argument to the jury, leaving Mr. Conkling to sum up his case  for the defense. The latter spoke at considerable length, in a  sophomoric style, laboring under the impression that unless he made an  extraordinary exertion to influence the jury he would be quite eclipsed  by Lincoln in his closing speech. But he was completely taken back by  the unlooked-for light manner in which Lincoln treated the case in his  closing. Lincoln proceeded to reply but, in doing so he talked on  without making the slightest reference to the case on hearing or to the  argument of Mr. Conkling. His summing-up to the jury was to the  following effect: \"Gentlemen of the jury: In early days there lived in  this vicinity, over on the Sangamon river, an old Indian of the Kickapoo  tribe by the name of Johnnie Kongapod. He had been taken in charge by  some good missionaries, converted to Christianity, and educated to such  extent that he could read and write. He took a great fancy to poetry and  became somewhat of a poet himself. His desire was that after his death  there should be placed at the head of his grave an epitaph, which he  prepared himself, in rhyme, in the following words:         \"'Here lies poor Johnnie Kongapod;         Have mercy on him, gracious God,         As he would do if he were God         And you were Johnnie Kongapod.'\"    Of course all this had no reference to the case, nor did Lincoln intend  it should have any. It was merely his way of ridiculing the eloquence of  his opponent. The verdict of the jury was for the plaintiff, as Lincoln  expected it would be; and this was the reason of his treating the case  as he did.    A story somewhat similar to the above was told by the late Judge John  Pearson shortly before his death. In the February term, 1850, of the  Circuit Court of Vermilion County, Illinois, a case was being tried in  which a young lady had brought suit for $10,000 against a recreant lover  who had married another girl. The amount sued for was thought to be an  enormous sum in those days, and the ablest talent to be found was  brought into requisition by both sides. Richard Thompson and Daniel W.

NOTE.--This use is noticed when, on opening a story, a person is       introduced by _a_, and afterwards referred to by _the_:--         By and by _a_ giant came out of the dark north, and lay down on       the ice near Audhumla.... _The_ giant frowned when he saw the       glitter of the golden hair.--_Heroes of Asgard._      [Sidenote: _With names of rivers._]    178. _The_ is often prefixed to the names of rivers; and when the  word _river_ is omitted, as \"_the_ Mississippi,\" \"_the_ Ohio,\" the  article indicates clearly that a river, and not a state or other  geographical division, is referred to.         No wonder I could face _the_ Mississippi with so much courage       supplied to me.--THACKERAY.         The Dakota tribes, doubtless, then occupied the country southwest       of _the_ Missouri.--G. BANCROFT.      [Sidenote: _To call attention to attributes._]    179. When _the_ is prefixed to a proper name, it alters the force of  the noun by directing attention to _certain qualities_ possessed by  the person or thing spoken of; thus,--         _The_ Bacon, _the_ Spinoza, _the_ Hume, Schelling, Kant, or       whosoever propounds to you a philosophy of the mind, is only a       more or less awkward translator of things in your       consciousness.--EMERSON.      [Sidenote: _With plural of abstract nouns._]    180. _The_, when placed before the pluralized abstract noun, marks  it as half abstract or a common noun.    [Sidenote: _Common._]         His messages to _the_ provincial _authorities_.--MOTLEY.    [Sidenote: _Half abstract._]         He was probably skilled in _the subtleties_ of Italian       statesmanship.--_Id._    [Sidenote: _With adjectives used as nouns._]    181. When _the_ precedes adjectives of the positive degree used  substantively, it marks their use as common and plural nouns when they  refer to persons, and as singular and abstract when they refer to  qualities.         1. _The simple_ rise as by specific levity, not into a particular       virtue, but into the region of all the virtues.--EMERSON.         2. If _the good_ is there, so is _the evil_.--_Id._    [Sidenote: _Caution._]    NOTE.--This is not to be confused with words that have shifted from  adjectives and become pure nouns; as,--         As she hesitated to pass on, _the gallant_, throwing his cloak       from his shoulders, laid it on the miry spot.--SCOTT.         But De Soto was no longer able to abate the confidence or punish       the temerity of _the natives_.--G. BANCROFT.    [Sidenote: _One thing for its class._]    182. _The_ before class nouns may mark one thing as a representative  of the class to which it belongs; for example,--         The faint, silvery warblings heard over the partially bare and       moist fields from _the bluebird_, _the song sparrow_, and _the       redwing_, as if the last flakes of winter tinkled as they       fell!--THOREAU.         In the sands of Africa and Arabia _the camel_ is a sacred and       precious gift.--GIBBON.    [Sidenote: _For possessive person pronouns._]    183. _The_ is frequently used instead of the possessive case of the  personal pronouns _his_, _her_, etc.         More than one hinted that a cord twined around _the head_, or a       match put between _the fingers_, would speedily extract the       required information.--KINGSLEY.         _The_ mouth, and the region of the mouth, were about the       strongest features in Wordsworth's face.--DE QUINCEY.      [Sidenote: The _for_ a.]    184. In England and Scotland _the_ is often used where we use _a_,  in speaking of measure and price; as,--         Wheat, the price of which necessarily varied, averaged in the       middle of the fourteenth century tenpence _the bushel_, barley       averaging at the same time three shillings _the       quarter_.--FROUDE.      [Sidenote: _A very strong restrictive._]    185. Sometimes _the_ has a strong force, almost equivalent to a  descriptive adjective in emphasizing a word,--         No doubt but ye are _the_ people, and wisdom shall die with       you.--_Bible._         As for New Orleans, it seemed to me _the_ city of the world where       you can eat and drink the most and suffer the least.--THACKERAY.         He was _the_ man in all Europe that could (if any could) have       driven six-in-hand full gallop over Al Sirat.--DE QUINCEY.      [Sidenote: _Mark of a substantive._]    186. _The_, since it belongs distinctively to substantives, is a  sure indication that a word of verbal form is not used participially,  but substantively.         In the hills of Sacramento there is gold for _the       gathering_.--EMERSON.         I thought _the writing_ excellent, and wished, if possible, to       imitate it.--FRANKLIN.      [Sidenote: _Caution._]    187. There is one use of _the_ which is different from all the  above. It is an adverbial use, and is spoken of more fully in Sec.  283. Compare this sentence with those above:--         There was something ugly and evil in his face, which they had not       previously noticed, and which grew still _the more obvious_ to       the sight _the oftener_ they looked upon him.--HAWTHORNE.    Exercise.--Find sentences with five uses of the definite article.        USES OF THE INDEFINITE ARTICLE.      [Sidenote: _Denotes any one of a class._]    188. The most frequent use of the indefinite article is to denote  any one of a class or group of objects: consequently it belongs to  singular words; as in the sentence,--         Near the churchyard gate stands _a_ poor-box, fastened to _a_       post by iron bands and secured by _a_ padlock, with _a_ sloping       wooden roof to keep off the rain.--LONGFELLOW    [Sidenote: _Widens the scope of proper nouns._]    189. When the indefinite article precedes proper names, it alters  them to class names. The qualities or attributes of the object are  made prominent, and transferred to any one possessing them; as,--         The vulgar riot and debauchery, which scarcely disgraced _an       Alcibiades_ or _a Caesar_, have been exchanged for the higher       ideals of _a Bayard_ or _a Sydney_.--PEARSON    [Sidenote: _With abstract nouns._]    190. _An_ or _a_ before abstract nouns often changes them to half  abstract: the idea of quality remains, but the word now denotes only  one instance or example of things possessing the quality.    [Sidenote: _Become half abstract._]         The simple perception of natural forms is _a delight_.--EMERSON         If thou hadst _a sorrow_ of thine own, the brook might tell thee       of it.--HAWTHORNE    In the first sentence, instead of the general abstract notion of  delight, which cannot be singular or plural, _a delight_ means one  thing delightful, and implies others having the same quality.    So _a sorrow_ means one cause of sorrow, implying that there are  other things that bring sorrow.    [Sidenote: _Become pure class nouns._]    NOTE.--Some abstract nouns become common class nouns with the  indefinite article, referring simply to persons; thus,--         If the poet of the \"Rape of the Lock\" be not _a wit_, who       deserves to be called so?--THACKERAY.         He had a little brother in London with him at this time,--as       great _a beauty_, as great a dandy, as great a villain.--_Id._         _A youth_ to fortune and to fame unknown.--GRAY.    [Sidenote: _Changes material to class nouns._]    191. _An_ or _a_ before a material noun indicates the change to a  class noun, meaning one kind or a detached portion; as,--         They that dwell up in the steeple,...          Feel a glory in so rolling       On the human heart _a stone_.       --POE.                 When God at first made man,       Having _a glass_ of blessings standing by.       --HERBERT.         The roofs were turned into arches of massy stone, joined by _a       cement_ that grew harder by time.--JOHNSON.    [Sidenote: _Like the numeral adjective_ one.]    192. In some cases _an_ or _a_ has the full force of the numeral  adjective _one_. It is shown in the following:--         To every room there was _an_ open and _a_ secret       passage.--JOHNSON.         In a short time these become a small tree, _an_ inverted pyramid       resting on the apex of the other.--THOREAU.         All men are at last of _a_ size.--EMERSON.         At the approach of spring the red squirrels got under my house,       two at _a_ time.--THOREAU.    [Sidenote: _Equivalent to the word_ each _or_ every.]    193. Often, also, the indefinite article has the force of _each_ or  _every_, particularly to express measure or frequency.         It would be so much more pleasant to live at his ease than to       work eight or ten hours _a day_.--BULWER    [Sidenote: _Compare to Sec. 184._]         Strong beer, such as we now buy for eighteenpence _a gallon_, was       then a penny _a gallon_.--FROUDE      [Sidenote: _With_ such, many, what.]    194. _An_ or _a_ is added to the adjectives _such_, _many_, and  _what_, and may be considered a part of these in modifying  substantives.         How was I to pay _such a_ debt?--THACKERAY.         _Many a_ one you and I have had here below.--THACKERAY.         _What a_ world of merriment then melody foretells!--POE.

A few of comparative form but not comparative meaning:--           After      Over      Under      Nether.    _Not_ and _never_ with _a_ or _an_ are numeral adjectives,  instead of adverbs, which they are in general.         _Not a_ drum was heard, _not a_ funeral note.--WOLFE         My Lord Duke was as hot as a flame at this salute, but said       _never a_ word.--THACKERAY"]]]
