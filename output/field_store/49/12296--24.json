This is what I have  principally to speak of now, but this whole first research is but  incidental to others upon the spectra before any absorption, which  though incomplete, I wish to briefly allude to later. The other curves  then indicate:    2d. The distribution of energy before absorption by our own atmosphere.    3d. This distribution at the photosphere of the sun. The extent of  the field, newly studied, is shown by this drawing [chart exhibited].  Between H in the extreme violet, and A in the furthest red, lies the  visible spectrum, with which we are familiar, its length being about  4,000 of Angstrom's units. If, then, 4,000 represent the length of the  visible spectrum, the chart shows that the region below extends through  24,000 more, and so much of this as lies below wave-length 12,000, I  think, is now mapped for the first time.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--PRISMATIC SPECTRUM.]    We have to pi = 12,000 relatively complete photographs, published by  Capt. Abney, but, except some very slight indications by Lamansky,  Desains, and Mouton, no further guide.    Deviations being proportionate to abscissae, and measured solar energies  to ordinates, we have here (1) the distribution of energy in the  prismatic, and (2) its distribution in the normal spectrum. The total  energy is in each case proportionate to the area of the curve (the two  very dissimilar curves inclosing the same area), and on each, if the  total energy be roughly divided into four parts, one of these will  correspond to the visible, and three to the invisible or ultra-red part.  The total energy at the ultra violet end is so small, then, as to be  here altogether negligible.    We observe that (owing to the distortion introduced by the prism) the  maximum ordinate representing the heat in the prismatic spectrum is, as  observed by Tyndall, below the red, while upon the normal scale this  maximum ordinate is found in the orange.    I would next ask your attention to the fact that in either spectrum,  below pi = 12,000 are most extraordinary depressions and interruptions  of the energy, to which, as will be seen, the visible spectrum offers  no parallel. As to the agent producing these great gaps, which so  strikingly interrupt the continuity of the curve, and, as you see,  in one place, cut it completely into two, I have as yet obtained no  conclusive evidence. Knowing the great absorption of water vapor in this  lowest region, as we already do, from the observations of Tyndall, it  would, _a priori_, seem not unreasonable to look to it as the cause. On  the other hand, when I have continued observations from noon to sunset,  making successive measures of each ordinate, as the sinking sun sent its  rays through greater depths of absorbing atmosphere, I have not found  these gaps increasing as much as they apparently should, if due to a  terrestrial cause, and so far as this evidence goes, they might be  rather thought to be solar. But my own means of investigation are not so  well adapted to decide this important point as those of photography, to  which we may yet be indebted for our final conclusion.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--NORMAL SPECTRUM. (At sea level.)]    I am led, from a study of Capt. Abney's photographs of the region  between pi = 8,000 and pi = 12,000, to think that these gaps are  produced by the aggregation of finer lines, which can best be  discriminated by the camera, an instrument which, where it can be used  at all, is far more sensitive than the bolometer; while the latter, I  think, has on the other hand some advantage in affording direct and  trustworthy measures of the amount of energy inhering in each ray.    One reason why the extent of this great region has been so singularly  underestimated, is the deceptively small space into which it appears to  be compressed by the distortion of the prism. To discriminate between  these crowded rays, I have been driven to the invention of a special  instrument. The bolometer, which I have here, is an instrument depending  upon principles which I need not explain at length, since all present  may be presumed to be familiar with the success which has before  attended their application in another field in the hands of the  President of this Association.    I may remark, however, that this special construction has involved very  considerable difficulties and long labor. For the instrument here shown,  platinum has been rolled by Messrs. Tiffany, of New York, into sheets,  which, as determined by the kindness of Professor Rood, reach the  surprising tenuity of less than one twenty-five-thousandth of an English  inch (I have also iron rolled to one fifteen-thousandth inch), and from  this platinum a strip is cut one one-hundred-and-twenty-fifth of an inch  wide. This minute strip, forming one arm of a Wheatstone's bridge, and  thus perfectly shielded from air currents, is accurately centered by  means of a compound microscope in this truly turned cylinder, and the  cylinder itself is exactly directed by the arms of this Y.    The attached galvanometer responds readily to changes of temperature, of  much less than one-ten-thousandth degree F. Since it is one and the same  solar energy whose manifestations we call \"light\" or \"heat,\" according  to the medium which interprets them, what is \"light\" to the eye is  \"heat\" to the bolometer, and what is seen as a dark line by the eye is  felt as a cold line by the sentient instrument. Accordingly, if lines  analogous to the dark \"Fraunhofer lines\" exist in this invisible region,  they will appear (if I may so speak) to the bolometer as cold bands, and  this hair-like strip of platina is moved along in the invisible part of  the spectrum till the galvanometer indicates the all but infinitesimal  change of temperature caused by its contact with such a \"cold band.\" The  whole work, it will be seen, is necessarily very slow; it is in fact a  long groping in the dark, and it demands extreme patience. A portion of  its results are now before you.    The most tedious part of the whole process has been the determination of  the wave-lengths. It will be remembered that we have (except through the  work of Capt. Abney already cited, and perhaps of M. Mouton) no direct  knowledge of the wave-lengths in the infra-red prismatic spectrum, but  have hitherto inferred them from formulas like the well-known one of  Cauchy's, all which known to me appear to be here found erroneous by the  test of direct experiment, at least in the case of the prism actually  employed.    I have been greatly aided in this part of the work by the remarkable  concave gratings lately constructed by Prof. Rowland, of Baltimore, one  of which I have the pleasure of showing you. [Instrument exhibited.]    The spectra formed by this fall upon a screen in which is a fine slit,  only permitting nearly homogeneous rays to pass, and these, which may  contain the rays of as many as four overlapping spectra, are next passed  through a rock-salt or glass prism placed with its refracting edge  parallel to the grating lines. This sorts out the different narrow  spectral images, without danger of overlapping, and after their passage  through the prism we find them again, and fix their position by means of  the bolometer, which for this purpose is attached to a special kind of  spectrometer, where its platinum thread replaces the reticule of the  ordinary telescope. This is very difficult work, especially in the  lowermost spectrum, where I have spent over two weeks of consecutive  labor in fixing a single wave-length.    The final result is, I think, worth, the trouble, however, for, as you  see here, we are now able to fix with approximate precision and by  direct experiment, the wave-length of every prismatic spectral ray. The  terminal ray of the solar spectrum, whose presence has been certainly  felt by the bolometer, has a wave-length of about 28,000 (or is nearly  two octaves below the \"great A\" of Fraunhofer).    So far, it appears only that we have been measuring _heat_, but I  have called the curve that of solar \"energy,\" because by a series of  independent investigations, not here given, the selective absorption  of the silver, the speculum-metal, the glass, and the lamp-black  (the latter used on the bolometer-strip), forming the agents of  investigation, has been separately allowed for. My study of lamp-black  absorption, I should add in qualification, is not quite complete. I have  found it quite transparent to certain infra-red rays, and it is very  possible that there may be some faint radiations yet to be discovered  even below those here indicated.    In view of the increased attention that is doubtless soon to be given  to this most interesting but strangely neglected region, and which by  photography and other methods is certain to be fully mapped hereafter, I  can but consider this present work less as a survey than as a sketch of  this great new field, and it is as such only that I here present it.    All that has preceded is subordinate to the main research, on which I  have occupied the past two years at Alleghany, in comparing the spectra  of the sun at high and low altitudes, but which I must here touch upon  briefly. By the generosity of a friend of the Alleghany Observatory, and  by the aid of Gen. Hazen, Chief Signal Officer of the U S. Army, I was  enabled last year to organize an expedition to Mount Whitney in South  California, where the most important of these latter observations were  repeated at an altitude of 13,000 feet. Upon my return I made a special  investigation upon the selective absorption of the sun's atmosphere,  with results which I can now only allude to.    By such observations, but by methods too elaborate for present  description, we can pass from the curve of energy actually observed to  that which would be seen if the observer were stationed wholly above the  earth's atmosphere, and freed from the effect of its absorption.

Even with relatives,  it is better to announce your coming, that your hostess may so  arrange her engagements and household as to leave her time to  really enjoy your visit.    A special invitation should specify who is invited, and no one not  mentioned should go. \"Love me, love my dog,\" is a proverb that  will not apply in such cases. A person who is invited to visit at  a friend's house is not at liberty to bring children and servants  who were not included in the invitation. A wife may, of course,  accompany her husband, unless there be special reason to the  contrary, and a husband must always have the opportunity of  accompanying his wife, or joining her.    If the length of your visit is not specified in your invitation, a  week is a good limit for your stay. At all events, make a move at  the end of that time, and if you are invited to stay longer, and  know that it is convenient for you to do so, the time can then be  definitely decided upon.    When you receive an invitation by letter, answer it at the  earliest possible moment, and say decidedly whether you accept or  decline it. To leave your friends in doubt may prevent the same  invitation being extended to others. As soon as possible after  accepting an invitation, write and let your friends know by what  train to expect you, and keep your engagement, that you may not  keep any one waiting for you at the station for nothing. If you  are unavoidably detained, write or telegraph and say so, naming  another hour for your arrival.    In inviting a friend to pay you a visit, name a season when will  you will be able to devote most of your time to their  entertainment. Have always a room devoted especially to your  guest, and be sure that no one intrudes there without a special  invitation, and never enter it yourself without an invitation to  do so. Before the arrival of a guest, see yourself that the room  is in perfect order, well warmed if in winter, shaded and cool if  in summer; let there be every convenience for bath and change of  dress, and writing materials and stamps ready to write if desired  before unpacking. Have always a feather bed and mattress, both  feather and hair pillows upon the bed, that your guest may have  the choice. Many prefer feathers in the warmest weather, others a  mattress even in winter. Let the fire, in winter, be made every  morning before your guest rises, and keep a good supply of fuel in  the room.    It is the duty of the host to send a carriage to the depot to meet  an expected visitor, and if possible to go himself. After a warm  welcome, show the guest at once to the room prepared, and give  ample time for a bath and change of dress, if it is in the day  time. If the arrival is late in the evening, have a substantial  supper prepared, and then allow the traveller to retire, being  careful that on the first arrival the breakfast can be ready at a  late hour, that your friend may not be disturbed to breakfast with  the family.    It is the duty of the hostess to share the meals of a guest, no  matter how irregular; but any truly polite person will pay strict  attention to the customary meal times.    When staying with friends, endeavor as much as possible to conform  to their regular habits. Be punctual at meal times. Ascertain  over-night the hour for breakfast, and be particular to be dressed  in time for it. After breakfast, it is customary to leave visitors  to their own devices, unless some special arrangement is made for  the forenoon; but the hostess should introduce her guests to the  piano, billiard-table, portfolios library-any device for passing  time at her command; and the visitor should accept this hint, and  expect no further attention during the forenoon.    It is, however, the duty of the host and hostess to accompany  their guests to any points of interest in their city or  neighborhood, to accompany them if they desire to do any shopping,  and if they have any special habit, as rising late, napping in the  afternoon, or other little self-indulgence, to see that they are  never disturbed in it.    It is also a kindly courtesy, if your friends have acquaintances  ill the city beside yourself, to inform them of their arrival,  even if strangers to yourself, and invite them to call, dine, or  take tea during the visit. If you give your guests a party, you  must invite all their friends in the city, even if they are  strangers to yourself. Invite them in your guest's name, enclosing  your own invitation in theirs.    Host and hostess should give up as much of their time as possible  to their guests, and should see that they are amused and taken  care of. It is a mistake, however, to suppose that visitors  require constant attention, and they should be careful not to  \"bore\" them by over-attention, which savors of fussiness. A guest  will often under such circumstances long for a lonely hour to  devote to music, reading, or sewing, but does not like to express  the desire.    The truest courtesy is for the host to make his visitor feel as  much at home as possible, and for the visitor to disturb the  host's household as little as possible.    Where a lady is visiting, she may with perfect propriety offer to  assist her hostess in her household duties or family sewing; but  if she declines, it is bad taste to insist. She should, however,  leave her hostess free for such duties in the morning, being  always ready to join her in the sitting-room when she is at  leisure.    It is a graceful way to acknowledge the kindness of your hostess  to work whilst with her upon some piece of embroidery, a  pianocover, a sofa-cushion, or some article of dress, which you  present to her when finished as a memento of your visit.    For a guest to make outside engagements, disregard the meal times,  visit without consulting the host or hostess, is to treat the  house of a friend as if it were a hotel, and is not only rude, but  positively insulting.    It is best, if you are visiting a large city, and desire to do  shopping or to transact business, to select the hours when you  know your entertainers are otherwise engaged for such business,  and not tax them to accompany you, unless they have similar  affairs requiring attention, when it may be pleasanter to have  company.    Neither hostess nor guest may accept any invitations which do not  include the other.    If either hostess or visitor is in mourning, the other must  decline all invitations during the visit, giving that as a reason.  It is always accepted in society as sufficient excuse.    If any sudden trouble comes into a house where you are visiting,  try to be of service. Let your friend feel that you have not  visited her for gayety alone, but are glad to sympathize in her  trouble. If sickness or death come, share the nursing, try to  relieve the hostess of some of her family cares, if it is only  taking the children into your own room or out for a walk; be ready  to do the shopping required for mourning, and take away every  painful detail you can. There is no comfort so great as a really  useful sympathizing friend in times of trouble; yet if relatives  come and require rooms, if you find you are a restraint and can be  of no use, it is the truest kindness to shorten your visit, and  leave the mourners free to comfort each other.    When visiting, never depend upon your host for writing or sewing  materials; but it is a delicate attention for you, if hostess, to  have your guest's room amply supplied with both.    It is extremely rude for visitors to make comparisons between the  house at which they are visiting and others where they have  enjoyed hospitality. To inform your hostess indirectly that her  house, furniture, table, or servants are inferior to those of  other friends, is insulting, and it is as much so to cast the slur  upon the first house visited by vaunting the superiority of the  second.    To a certain extent, use your friend's servants as your own wholly  so as far as your own personal wants require their services. Ask  for whatever you want in your own room, and give any requisite  directions to the servant who waits upon you. Do not trouble the  mistress of the house with matters which in your own house you  would give to a servant. At the same time, avoid being  troublesome; put out your own washing, and any extra work you  require done, and never call upon the servants at hours when they  are otherwise employed.    If you are unfortunate enough during a visit to injure any article  of furniture in your own room, have it repaired or replaced at  once at your own expense.    It is a graceful compliment for a gentleman during a visit to  bring flowers, fruit, books, or confectionery occasionally to the  hostess, and a lady friend will be gratefully remembered if she is  kind to the children.    If a gift is made, it must be to the hostess, or if there are  several children, to the youngest. If children are over twelve years  old, it is better to give any present to the mother; but you will  never give offence by a gift to the baby. A gentleman may give baby  jewelry, and a lady a piece of handsome needlework. You may be sure  the parents will find no fault with this acknowledgment of their  hospitality.    Always hold yourself at the disposal of those in whose house you  are staying. If they propose to ride, drive, walk, or other wise  occupy the day, you must take it for granted that these plans are  made with reference to your enjoyment. You should receive them  with cheerfulness and enter into them with alacrity, doing your  best to seem pleased, and be pleased, by the efforts made to  entertain you. Never mind if it is the twentieth time you have  driven to \"see the lovely view from the hill four miles from  here,\" or you have paid a dozen previous visits to \"that beautiful  waterfall just"]]]
