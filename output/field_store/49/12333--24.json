[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9806"],[0,"Mr. Justice Raffles (#18)"],[1,"those two men behind Teddy's net. They were not watching him;  that called my attention to them. It's my belief they were lying in wait  for Mr. Raffles; at any rate, when he came they moved away. But they  followed us afterwards across the ground.\"    \"You are sure of that?\"    \"I looked round to see,\" said Miss Belsize, avoiding my eyes for the  first time.    \"Did you think the men--detectives?\"    And I forced a laugh.    \"I was afraid they might be, Mr. Manders, though I have never seen one  off the stage.\"    \"Still,\" I pursued, with painfully sustained amusement, \"you were  ready to find A.J. Raffles being shadowed here at Lord's of all places  in the world?\"    \"I was ready for anything, anywhere,\" said Miss Belsize, \"after all I  heard yesterday afternoon.\"    \"You mean about poor Mr. Garland and his affairs?\"    It was an ingenuously disingenuous suggestion; it brought my companion's  eyes back to mine, with something of the scorn that I deserved.    \"No, Mr. Manders, I meant after what we all heard between Mr. Levy  and Mr. Raffles; and you knew very well what I meant,\" added Miss  Belsize severely.    \"But surely you didn't take all that seriously?\" said I, without denying  the just impeachment.    \"How could I help it? The insinuation was serious enough, in all  conscience!\" exclaimed Camilla Belsize.    \"That is,\" said I, since she was not to be wilfully misunderstood, \"that  poor old Raffles had something to do with this jewel robbery at  Carlsbad?\"    \"If it was a robbery.\"    She winced at the word.    \"Do you mean it might have been a trick?\" said I, recalling the victim's  own make-believe at the Albany. And not only did Camilla appear to  embrace that theory with open arms; she had the nerve to pretend that it  really was what she had meant.    \"Obviously!\" says she, with an impromptu superiority worthy of Raffles  himself. \"I wonder you never thought of that, Mr. Manders, when you know  what a trick you both played Mr. Levy only yesterday. Mr. Raffles himself  told us all about that; and I'm very grateful to you both; you must know  I am--for Teddy's sake,\" added Miss Belsize, with one quick remorseful  glance towards the great arena. \"Still it only shows what Mr. Raffles  is--and--and it's what I meant when we were talking about him yesterday.\"    \"I don't remember,\" said I, remembering fast enough.    \"In the rockery,\" she reminded me. \"When you asked what people said about  him, and I said that about living on his wits.\"    \"And being a paid amateur!\"    \"But the other was the worst.\"    \"I'm not so sure,\" said I. \"But his wits wouldn't carry him very far if  he only took necklaces and put them back again.\"    \"But it was all a joke,\" she reminded us both with a bit of a start.  \"It must have been a joke, if Mr. Raffles did it at all. And it would  be dreadful if anything happened to him because of a wretched  practical joke!\"    There was no mistake about her feeling now; she really felt that it would  be \"dreadful if anything happened\" to the man whom yesterday she had  seemed both to dislike and to distrust. Her voice vibrated with anxiety.  A bright film covered the fine eyes, and they were finer than ever as  they continued to face me unashamed; but I was fool enough to speak my  mind, and at that they flashed themselves dry.    \"I thought you didn't like him?\" had been my remark, and \"Who says I do?\"  was hers. \"But he has done a lot for Teddy,\" she went on, \"and never more  than yesterday,\" with her hand for an instant on my arm, \"when you helped  him! I am dreadfully sorry for Mr. Garland, sorrier than I am for poor  Teddy. But Mr. Raffles is more than sorry. I know he means to do what he  can. He seems to think there must be something wrong; he spoke of  bringing that brute to reason--if not to justice. It would be too  dreadful if such a creature could turn the tables on Mr. Raffles by  trumping up any charge against him!\"    There was an absolute echo of my own tone in \"trumping up any charge,\"  and I thought the echo sounded even more insincere. But at least it  showed me where we were. Miss Belsize was not deceived; she only wanted  me to think she was. Miss Belsize had divined what I knew, but neither  of us would admit to the other that the charge against Raffles would be  true enough.    \"But why should these men follow him?\" said I, really wondering why they  should. \"If there were anything definite against old Raffles, don't you  think he would be arrested?\"    \"Oh! I don't know,\" was the slightly irritable answer. \"I only think he  should be warned that he is being followed.\"    \"Whatever he has done?\" I ventured.    \"Yes!\" said she. \"Whatever he has done--after what he did for Teddy  yesterday!\"    \"You want me to warn him?\"    \"Yes--but not from me!\"    \"And suppose he really did take Mrs. Levy's necklace?\"    \"That's just what we are supposing.\"    \"But suppose it wasn't for a joke at all?\"    I spoke as one playfully plumbing the abysmally absurd; what I did desire  to sound was the loyalty of this new, unexpected, and still captious  ally. And I thought myself strangely successful at the first cast; for  Miss Belsize looked me in the face as I was looking her, and I trusted  her before she spoke.    \"Well, after yesterday,\" she said, \"I should warn him all the same!\"    \"You would back your Raffles right or wrong?\" I murmured, perceiving that  Camilla Belsize was, after all, like all the rest of us.    \"Against a vulgar extortioner, most decidedly!\" she returned, without  repudiating the possessive pronoun. \"It doesn't follow that I think  anything of him--apart from what you did between you for Teddy  yesterday.\"    We had continued our stroll some time ago, and now it was I who stood  still. I looked at my watch. It still wanted some minutes to the  luncheon interval.    \"If Raffles took a cab to his rooms,\" I said, \"he must be nearly there  and I must telephone to him.\"    \"Is there a call-office on the ground?\"    \"Only in the pavilion, I believe, for the use of the members.\"    \"Then you must go to the nearest one outside.\"    \"And what about you?\"    Miss Belsize brightened with her smile of perfect and unconscious  independence.    \"Oh, I shall be all right,\" she said. \"I know where to find Mr. Garland,  even if I don't pick up an escort on the way.\"    But it was she who escorted me to the tall turnstile nearest  Wellington Road.    \"And you do see why I want to put Mr. Raffles on his guard?\" she said  pointedly as we shook hands. \"It's only because you and he have done so  much for Teddy!\"    And because she did not end by reminding me of my promise, I was all the  more reluctantly determined to keep it to the letter, even though Raffles  should think as ill as ever of one who was at least beginning to think  better of him.          CHAPTER XI    A Dash in the Dark      In a few lines which I found waiting for me at the club, and have  somewhat imprudently preserved, Raffles professes to have known he was  being shadowed even before we met at Lord's: \"but it was no use talking  about it until the foe were in the cart.\" He goes on to explain the  simple means by which he reduced the gentlemen in billycocks to the pitch  of discomfiture implied in his metaphor. He had taken a hansom to the  Burlington Gardens entrance to the Albany, and kept it waiting while he  went in and changed his clothes; then he had sent Barraclough to pay off  the cab, and himself marched out into Piccadilly, what time the billycock  brims were still shading watchful eyes in Burlington Gardens. There, to  be sure, I myself had spotted one of the precious pair when I drove up  after vain exertions at the call-office outside Lord's; but by that time  his confederate was on guard at the Piccadilly end, and Raffles had not  only shown a clean pair of wings, but left the poor brutes to watch an  empty cage. He dismisses them not unfairly with the epithet  \"amateurish.\" Thus I was the more surprised, but not the less relieved,  to learn that he was \"running down into the country for the weekend, to  be out of their way\"; but he would be back on the Monday night, \"to keep  an engagement you wot of, Bunny. And if you like you may meet me under  the clock at Waterloo (in flannel kit and tennis-shoes for choice) at the  witching hour of twelve sharp.\"    If I liked! I had a premature drink in honour of an invitation more  gratifying to my vanity than any compliment old Raffles had paid me yet;  for I could still hear his ironical undertaking to let me know if he  could not do without me, and there was obviously no irony in this  delightfully early intimation of that very flattering fact. It altered my  whole view of the case. I might disapprove of the risks Raffles was  running for his other friends, but the more I was allowed to share in  them the less critical I was inclined to be. Besides I was myself clearly  implicated in the issue as between my own friend and the common enemy; it  was no more palatable to me than it was to Raffles, to be beaten by Dan  Levy after our initial victory over him. So I drank like a man to his  destruction, and subsequently stole forth to spy upon his foolish  myrmidons, who flattered themselves that they were spying on Raffles. The  imbeciles were at it still! The one hanging about Burlington Gardens  looked unutterably bored, but with his blots of whisker and his grimy  jowl, as flagrant a detective officer as ever I saw, even if he had not  so considerately dressed the part. The other bruiser was an equally  distinctive type, with a formidable fighting face and a chest like a  barrel; but in Piccadilly he seemed to me less occupied in taking notice  than in avoiding it. In innocuous futility one could scarcely excel the  other; and between them they raised my spirits to the zenith.    I spent the rest of the afternoon at their own game, dogging Miss Belsize  about Lord's until at last I had an opportunity of informing her that  Raffles was quite"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9845"],[0,"The Spy (#18)"],[1,"only the slighter fences of rails to be thrown down.  Their duty was hastily but effectually performed; and the guides  withdrew to the post assigned to them for the approaching fight.    Major Dunwoodie had received from his scouts all the intelligence  concerning his foe, which was necessary to enable him to make his  arrangements. The bottom of the valley was an even plain, that fell with  a slight inclination from the foot of the hills on either side, to the  level of a natural meadow that wound through the country on the banks of  a small stream, by whose waters it was often inundated and fertilized.  This brook was easily forded in any part of its course; and the only  impediment it offered to the movements of the horse, was in a place  where it changed its bed from the western to the eastern side of the  valley, and where its banks were more steep and difficult of access than  common. Here the highway crossed it by a rough wooden bridge, as it did  again at the distance of half a mile above the Locusts.    The hills on the eastern side of the valley were abrupt, and frequently  obtruded themselves in rocky prominences into its bosom, lessening the  width to half the usual dimensions. One of these projections was but a  short distance in the rear of the squadron of dragoons, and Dunwoodie  directed Captain Lawton to withdraw, with two troops, behind its cover.  The officer obeyed with a kind of surly reluctance, that was, however,  somewhat lessened by the anticipations of the effect his sudden  appearance would make on the enemy. Dunwoodie knew his man, and had  selected the captain for this service, both because he feared his  precipitation in the field, and knew, when needed, his support would  never fail to appear. It was only in front of the enemy that Captain  Lawton was hasty; at all other times his discernment and self-possession  were consummately preserved; but he sometimes forgot them in his  eagerness to engage. On the left of the ground on which Dunwoodie  intended to meet his foe, was a close wood, which skirted that side of  the valley for the distance of a mile. Into this, then, the guides  retired, and took their station near its edge, in such a manner as would  enable them to maintain a scattering, but effectual fire, on the  advancing column of the enemy.    It cannot be supposed that all these preparations were made unheeded by  the inmates of the cottage; on the contrary, every feeling which can  agitate the human breast, in witnessing such a scene, was actively  alive. Mr. Wharton alone saw no hopes to himself in the termination of  the conflict. If the British should prevail, his son would be liberated;  but what would then be his own fate! He had hitherto preserved his  neutral character in the midst of trying circumstances. The fact of his  having a son in the royal, or, as it was called, the regular army, had  very nearly brought his estates to the hammer. Nothing had obviated this  result, but the powerful interest of the relation who held a high  political rank in the state, and his own vigilant prudence. In his  heart, he was a devoted loyalist; and when the blushing Frances had  communicated to him the wishes of her lover, on their return from the  American camp the preceding spring, the consent he had given, to her  future union with a rebel, was as much extracted by the increasing  necessity which existed for his obtaining republican support, as by any  considerations for the happiness of his child. Should his son now be  rescued, he would, in the public mind, be united with him as a plotter  against the freedom of the States; and should he remain a captive and  undergo the impending trial, the consequences might be still more  dreadful. Much as he loved his wealth, Mr. Wharton loved his children  better; and he sat gazing on the movements without, with a listless  vacancy in his countenance, that fully denoted his imbecility of  character. Far different were the feelings of the son. Captain Wharton  had been left in the keeping of two dragoons, one of whom marched to and  fro on the piazza with a measured tread, and the other had been directed  to continue in the same apartment with his prisoner. The young man had  witnessed all the movements of Dunwoodie with admiration mingled with  fearful anticipations of the consequences to friends. He particularly  disliked the ambush of the detachment under Lawton, who could be  distinctly seen from the windows of the cottage, cooling his impatience,  by pacing on foot the ground in front of his men. Henry Wharton threw  several hasty and inquiring glances around, to see if no means of  liberation would offer, but invariably found the eyes of his sentinel  fixed on him with the watchfulness of an Argus. He longed, with the  ardor of youth, to join in the glorious fray, but was compelled to  remain a dissatisfied spectator of a scene in which he would so  cheerfully have been an actor. Miss Peyton and Sarah continued gazing  on the preparations with varied emotions, in which concern for the fate  of the captain formed the most prominent feeling, until the moment of  shedding of blood seemed approaching, when, with the timidity of their  sex, they sought the retirement of an inner room. Not so Frances; she  returned to the apartment where she had left Dunwoodie, and, from one of  its windows, had been a deeply interested spectator of all his  movements. The wheelings of the troops, the deadly preparations, had all  been unnoticed; she saw her lover only, and with mingled emotions of  admiration and dread that nearly chilled her. At one moment the blood  rushed to her heart, as she saw the young warrior riding through his  ranks, giving life and courage to all whom he addressed; and the next,  it curdled with the thought that the very gallantry she so much valued  might prove the means of placing the grave between her and the object of  her regard. Frances gazed until she could look no longer.    In a field on the left of the cottage, and at a short distance in the  rear of the troops, was a small group, whose occupation seemed to differ  from that of all around them. They were in number only three, being two  men and a mulatto boy. The principal personage of this party was a man,  whose leanness made his really tall stature appear excessive. He wore  spectacles--was unarmed, had dismounted, and seemed to be dividing his  attention between a cigar, a book, and the incidents of the field before  him. To this party Frances determined to send a note, directed to  Dunwoodie. She wrote hastily, with a pencil, \"Come to me, Peyton, if it  be but for a moment\"; and Caesar emerged from the cellar kitchen, taking  the precaution to go by the rear of the building, to avoid the sentinel  on the piazza, who had very cavalierly ordered all the family to remain  housed. The black delivered the note to the gentleman, with a request  that it might be forwarded to Major Dunwoodie. It was the surgeon of the  horse to whom Caesar addressed himself; and the teeth of the African  chattered, as he saw displayed upon the ground the several instruments  which were in preparation for the anticipated operations. The doctor  himself seemed to view the arrangement with great satisfaction, as he  deliberately raised his eyes from his book to order the boy to convey  the note to his commanding officer, and then dropping them quietly on  the page he continued his occupation. Caesar was slowly retiring, as the  third personage, who by his dress might be an inferior assistant of the  surgical department, coolly inquired \"if he would have a leg taken off?\"  This question seemed to remind the black of the existence of those  limbs, for he made such use of them as to reach the piazza at the same  instant that Major Dunwoodie rode up, at half speed. The brawny sentinel  squared himself, and poised his sword with military precision as he  stood on his post, while his officer passed; but no sooner had the door  closed, than, turning to the negro, he said, sharply,--    \"Harkee, blackee, if you quit the house again without my knowledge, I  shall turn barber, and shave off one of those ebony ears with  this razor.\"    Thus assailed in another member, Caesar hastily retreated into his  kitchen, muttering something, in which the words \"Skinner,\" and \"rebel  rascal,\" formed a principal part of speech.    \"Major Dunwoodie,\" said Frances to her lover as he entered, \"I may have  done you injustice; if I have appeared harsh--\"    The emotions of the agitated girl prevailed, and she burst into tears.    \"Frances,\" cried the soldier with warmth, \"you are never harsh, never  unjust, but when you doubt my love.\"    \"Ah! Dunwoodie,\" added the sobbing girl, \"you are about to risk your  life in battle; remember that there is one heart whose happiness is  built on your safety; brave I know you are: be prudent--\"    \"For your sake?\" inquired the delighted youth.    \"For my sake,\" replied Frances, in a voice barely audible, and dropping  on his bosom.    Dunwoodie folded her to his heart, and was about to speak, as a trumpet  sounded in the southern end of the vale. Imprinting one long kiss of  affection on her unresisting lips, the soldier tore himself from his  mistress, and hastened to the scene of strife.    Frances threw herself on a sofa, buried her head under its cushion, and  with her shawl drawn over her face, to exclude as much of sound as  possible, continued there until the shouts of the combatants, the  rattling of the firearms, and the thundering tread of the horses  had ceased.
