[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11128"],[0,"The Red Thumb Mark (#19)"],[1,"how completely you were in the right  when you allowed yourself to entertain this theory of the crime in spite  of its apparent improbability. By the light of these new facts it has  become quite a probable explanation of the whole affair, and if it could  only be shown that Mr. Hornby's memorandum block was among the papers on  the table, it would rise to a high degree of probability. The obvious  moral is, never disregard the improbable. By the way, it is odd that  Reuben failed to recall this occurrence when I questioned him. Of  course, the bloody finger-marks were not discovered until he had gone,  but one would have expected him to recall the circumstance when I asked  him, pointedly, if he had never left bloody finger-prints on any  papers.\"    \"I must try to find out if Mr. Hornby's memorandum block was on the  table and among the marked papers,\" I said.    \"Yes, that would be wise,\" he answered, \"though I don't suppose the  information will be forthcoming.\"    My colleague's manner rather disappointed me. He had heard my report  with the greatest attention, he had discussed it with animation, but yet  he seemed to attach to the new and--as they appeared to me--highly  important facts an interest that was academic rather than practical. Of  course, his calmness might be assumed; but this did not seem likely, for  John Thorndyke was far too sincere and dignified a character to  cultivate in private life the artifices of the actor. To strangers,  indeed, he presented habitually a calm and impassive exterior; but this  was natural to him, and was but the outward sign of his even and  judicial habit of mind.    No; there was no doubt that my startling news had left him unmoved, and  this must be for one of two reasons: either he already knew all that I  had told him (which was perfectly possible), or he had some other and  better means of explaining the crime. I was turning over these two  alternatives, not unobserved by my watchful colleague, when Polton  entered the room; a broad grin was on his face, and a drawing-board,  that he carried like a tray, bore twenty-four neatly turned boxwood  pieces.    Thorndyke at once entered into the unspoken jest that beamed from the  countenance of his subordinate.    \"Here is Polton with a problem for you, Jervis,\" he said. \"He assumes  that I have invented a new parlour game, and has been trying to work out  the moves. Have you succeeded yet, Polton?\"    \"No, sir, I haven't; but I suspect that one of the players will be a man  in a wig and gown.\"    \"Perhaps you are right,\" said Thorndyke; \"but that doesn't take you very  far. Let us hear what Dr. Jervis has to say.\"    \"I can make nothing of them,\" I answered. \"Polton showed me the drawing  this morning, and then was terrified lest he had committed a breach of  confidence, and I have been trying ever since, without a glimmer of  success, to guess what they can be for.\"    \"H'm,\" grunted Thorndyke, as he sauntered up and down the room, teacup  in hand, \"to guess, eh? I like not that word 'guess' in the mouth of a  man of science. What do you mean by a 'guess'?\"    His manner was wholly facetious, but I professed to take his question  seriously, and replied--    \"By a guess, I mean a conclusion arrived at without data.\"    \"Impossible!\" he exclaimed, with mock sternness. \"Nobody but an utter  fool arrives at a conclusion without data.\"    \"Then I must revise my definition instantly,\" I rejoined. \"Let us say  that a guess is a conclusion drawn from insufficient facts.\"    \"That is better,\" said he; \"but perhaps it would be better still to say  that a guess is a particular and definite conclusion deduced from facts  which properly yield only a general and indefinite one. Let us take an  instance,\" he continued. \"Looking out of the window, I see a man walking  round Paper Buildings. Now suppose I say, after the fashion of the  inspired detective of the romances, 'That man is a stationmaster or  inspector,' that would be a guess. The observed facts do not yield the  conclusion, though they do warrant a conclusion less definite and more  general.\"    \"You'd have been right though, sir!\" exclaimed Polton, who had stepped  forward with me to examine the unconscious subject of the demonstration.  \"That gent used to be the stationmaster at Camberwell. I remember him  well.\"  The little man was evidently greatly impressed.    \"I happen to be right, you see,\" said Thorndyke; \"but I might as easily  have been wrong.\"    \"You weren't though, sir,\" said Polton. \"You spotted him at a glance.\"    In his admiration of the result he cared not a fig for the correctness  of the means by which it had been attained.    \"Now why do I suggest that he is a stationmaster?\" pursued Thorndyke,  disregarding his assistant's comment.    \"I suppose you were looking at his feet,\" I answered. \"I seem to have  noticed that peculiar, splay-footed gait in stationmasters, now that you  mention it.\"    \"Quite so. The arch of the foot has given way; the plantar ligaments  have become stretched and the deep calf muscles weakened. Then, since  bending of the weakened arch causes discomfort, the feet have become  turned outwards, by which the bending of the foot is reduced to a  minimum; and as the left foot is the more flattened, so it is turned out  more than the right. Then the turning out of the toes causes the legs to  splay outward from the knees downwards--a very conspicuous condition in  a tall man like this one--and you notice that the left leg splays out  more than the other.    \"But we know that depression of the arch of the foot is brought about by  standing for long periods. Continuous pressure on a living structure  weakens it, while intermittent pressure strengthens it; so the man who  stands on his feet continuously develops a flat instep and a weak calf,  while the professional dancer or runner acquires a high instep and a  strong calf. Now there are many occupations which involve prolonged  standing and so induce the condition of flat foot: waiters,  hall-porters, hawkers, policemen, shop-walkers, salesmen, and station  officials are examples. But the waiter's gait is characteristic--a  quick, shuffling walk which enables him to carry liquids without  spilling them. This man walks with a long, swinging stride; he is  obviously not a waiter. His dress and appearance in general exclude the  idea of a hawker or even a hall-porter; he is a man of poor physique and  so cannot be a policeman. The shop-walker or salesman is accustomed to  move in relatively confined spaces, and so acquires a short, brisk step,  and his dress tends to rather exuberant smartness; the station official  patrols long platforms, often at a rapid pace, and so tends to take long  strides, while his dress is dignified and neat rather than florid. The  last-mentioned characteristics, you see, appear in the subject of our  analysis; he agrees with the general description of a stationmaster. But  if we therefore conclude that he _is_ a stationmaster, we fall into the  time-honoured fallacy of the undistributed middle term--the fallacy that  haunts all brilliant guessers, including the detective, not only of  romance, but too often also of real life. All that the observed facts  justify us in inferring is that this man is engaged in some mode of life  that necessitates a good deal of standing; the rest is mere guess-work.\"    \"It's wonderful,\" said Polton, gazing at the now distant figure;  \"perfectly wonderful. I should never have known he was a stationmaster.\"  With this and a glance of deep admiration at his employer, he took his  departure.    \"You will also observe,\" said Thorndyke, with a smile, \"that a fortunate  guess often brings more credit than a piece of sound reasoning with a  less striking result.\"    \"Yes, that is unfortunately the case, and it is certainly true in the  present instance. Your reputation, as far as Polton is concerned, is now  firmly established even if it was not before. In his eyes you are a  wizard from whom nothing is hidden. But to return to these little  pieces, as I must call them, for the lack of a better name. I can form  no hypothesis as to their use. I seem to have no 'departure,' as the  nautical phrase goes, from which to start an inquiry. I haven't even the  material for guess-work. Ought I to be able to arrive at any opinion on  the subject?\"    Thorndyke picked up one of the pieces, fingering it delicately and  inspecting with a critical eye the flat base on which it stood, and  reflected for a few moments.    \"It is easy to trace a connection when one knows all the facts,\" he said  at length, \"but it seems to me that you have the materials from which to  form a conjecture. Perhaps I am wrong, but I think, when you have had  more experience, you will find yourself able to work out a problem of  this kind. What is required is constructive imagination and a rigorous  exactness in reasoning. Now, you are a good reasoner, and you have  recently shown me that you have the necessary imagination; you merely  lack experience in the use of your faculties. When you learn my purpose  in having these things made--as you will before long--you will probably  be surprised that their use did not occur to you. And now let us go  forth and take a brisk walk to refresh ourselves (or perhaps I should  say myself) after the day's labour.          CHAPTER XI    THE AMBUSH      \"I am going to ask for your collaboration in another case,\" said  Thorndyke, a day or two later. \"It appears to be one of suicide, but the  solicitors to the 'Griffin' office have asked me to go down to the  place, which is in the neighbourhood of Barnet, and be present at the  _post-mortem_ and the inquest. They have managed to arrange that the  inquest shall take place directly after the _post-mortem_, so that we  shall be able to do the whole business in a single visit.\"    \"Is the case one of any intricacy?\" I asked.    \"I don't think so,\" he answered. \"It looks like a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11153"],[0,"No Hero (#19)"],[1,"really does serve you right!\"    I made no answer. I was looking at the suit-case on the bed. Bob seemed  to have lost all interest in his packing. I turned to leave him without  a word.    \"I am awfully sorry!\" he was the one to say again. I began to wonder  when he would see all round the point, and how it would affect his  feeling (to say nothing of his actions) when he did. Meanwhile it was  Bob who was holding out his hand.    \"So am I,\" I said, taking it.    And for once I, too, was not thinking about myself.          CHAPTER XII    A STERN CHASE      Where had Bob been going, and where was he going now? If these were not  the first questions that I asked myself on coming away from him, they  were at all events among my last thoughts that night, and as it  happened, quite my first next morning. His voice had reached me through  my bedroom window, on the head of a dream about himself. I got up and  looked out; there was Bob Evers seeing the suit-case into the tiny train  which brings your baggage (and yourself, if you like) to the very door  of the Riffel Alp Hotel. Bob did not like and I watched him out of sight  down the winding path threaded by the shining rails. He walked slowly,  head and shoulders bent, it might be with dogged resolve, it might be in  mere depression; there was never a glimpse of his face, nor a backward  glance as he swung round the final corner, with his great-coat over his  arm.    In spite of my curiosity as to his destination, I made no attempt to  discover it for myself, but on consideration I was guilty of certain  inquiries concerning that of Mrs. Lascelles. They had not to be very  exhaustive; she had made no secret of her original plans upon leaving  the Riffel Alp, and they did not appear to have undergone much change. I  myself left the same forenoon, and lay that night amid the smells of  Brigues, after a little tour of its hotels, in one of which I found the  name of Mrs. Lascelles in the register, while in every one I was  prepared to light upon Bob Evers in the flesh. But that encounter did  not occur.    In the early morning I was one of a shivering handful who awaited the  diligence for the Furka Pass; and an ominous drizzle made me thankful  that my telegram of the previous day had been too late to secure me an  outside seat. It was quite damp enough within. Nor did the day improve  as we drove, or the view attract me in the least. It was at its worst as  a sight, and I at mine as a sightseer. I have as little recollection of  my fellow-passengers; but I still see the page in the hotel register at  the Rhone Glacier, with the name I sought written boldly in its place,  just twenty-four hours earlier.    The Furka Pass has its European reputation; it would gain nothing from  my enthusiastic praises, had I any enthusiasm to draw upon, or the  descriptive powers to do it justice. But what I best remember is the  time it took us to climb those interminable zig-zags, and to shake off  the too tenacious sight of the hotel in the hollow where I had seen a  signature and eaten my lunch. Now I think of it, there were two couples  who had come so far with us, but at the Rhone Glacier they exchanged  their mutually demonstrative adieux, and I thought the couple who came  on would never have done waving to the couple who stayed behind. They  kept it up for at least an hour, and then broke out again at each of our  many last glimpses of the hotel, now hundreds of feet below. That was  the only diversion until these energetic people went to see the glacier  cave at the summit of the pass. I am glad to remember that I preferred  refreshment at the inn. After that, night fell upon a scene whose  desolation impressed me more than its grandeur, and so in the end we  rattled into Andermatt: here was a huge hotel all but empty, with a  perfect tome of a visitors' book, and in it sure enough the fine free  autograph which I was beginning to know so well.    \"Yes, sare,\" said the concierge, \"the season end suddenly mit the bad  vedder at the beginning of the veek. You know that lady? She has been  here last night; she go avay again to-day, on to Goeschenen and Zuerich.  Yes, sare, she shall be in Zuerich to-night.\"    I was in Zuerich myself the night after. I knew the hotel to go to, knew  it from Mrs. Lascelles herself, whose experience of continental hotels  was so pathetically extensive. This was the best in Switzerland, so she  had assured me in one of our talks: she could never pass through Zuerich  without making a night of it at the Baur au Lac. But one night of it  appeared to be enough, or so it had proved on this occasion, for again I  missed her by a few hours. I was annoyed. I agreed with Mrs. Lascelles  about this hotel. Since I had made up my mind to overtake her first or  last, it might as well have been a comfortable place like this, where  there was good cooking and good music and all the comforts which I may  or may not have needed, but which I was certainly beginning to desire.    What a contrast to the place at which I found myself the following  night. It was a place called Triberg, in the Black Forest, which I had  never penetrated before, and certainly never shall again. It seemed to  me an uttermost end of the earth, but it was raining when I arrived, and  the rain never ceased for an instant while I was there. About a dozen  hotel omnibuses met the train, from which only three passengers  alighted; the other two were a young married couple at whom I would not  have looked twice, though we all boarded the same lucky 'bus, had not  the young man stared very hard at me.    \"Captain Clephane,\" said he, \"I guess you've forgotten me; but you may  remember my best gurl?\"    It was our good-natured young American from the Riffel Alp, who had not  only joined in the daily laugh against himself up there, but must needs  raise it as soon as ever he met one of us again. I rather think his best  girl did not hear him, for she was staring through the streaming omnibus  windows into an absolutely deserted country street, and I feared that  her eyes would soon resemble the panes. She brightened, however, in a  very flattering way, as I thought, on finding a third soul for one or  both of them to speak to, for a change. I only wished I could have  returned the compliment in my heart.    \"Captain Clephane,\" continued the young bridegroom, \"we came down Monday  last. Say, who do you guess came down along with us?\"    \"A friend of yours,\" prompted the bride, as I put on as blank an  expression as possible.    I opened my eyes a little wider. It seemed the only thing to do.    \"Captain Clephane,\" said the bridegroom, beaming all over his  good-humoured face, \"it was a lady named Lascelles, and it's to her  advice we owe this pleasure. We travelled together as far as Loocerne.  We guess we'll put salt on her at this hotel.\"    \"So does the Captain,\" announced the bride, who could not look at me  without a smile, which I altogether declined to return. But I need  hardly confess that she was right. It was from Mrs. Lascelles that I  also had heard of the dismal spot to which we were come, as her own  ultimate objective after Switzerland. It was the only address with which  she had provided the concierge at the Riffel Alp. All day I had  regretted the night wasted at Zuerich, on the chance of saving a day; but  until this moment I had been sanguine of bringing my dubious quest to a  successful issue here in Triberg. Now I was no longer even anxious to do  so. I did not desire witnesses of a meeting which might well be of a  character humiliating to myself. Still less should I have chosen for  such witnesses a couple who were plainly disposed to put the usual  misconstruction upon the relations of any man with any woman.    My disappointment was consequently less than theirs when we drove up to  as gloomy a hostelry as I have ever beheld, with the blue-black forest  smoking wet behind it, to find that here also the foul weather had  brought the season to a premature and sudden end, literally emptying  this particular hotel. Nor did the landlord give us the welcome we might  have expected on a hasty consideration of the circumstances. He said  that he had been on the point of shutting up that house until next  season and hinted at less profit than loss upon three persons only.    \"But there's a fourth person coming,\" declared the disconsolate bride.  \"We figured on finding her right here!\"    \"A Mrs. Lascelles,\" her husband explained.    \"Been and gone,\" said the landlord, grinning sardonically. \"Too lonely  for the lady. She has arrived last night, and gone away again this  morning. You will find her at the Darmstaedterhof, in Baden-Baden,  unless she changes her mind on the way.\"    I caught his grin. It had been the same story, at every stage of my  journey; the chances were that it would be the same thing again at  Baden-Baden. There may have been something, however, of which I was  unaware in my smile; for I found myself under close observation by the  bride; and as our eyes met her hand slipped within her husband's arm.    \"I guess _we_ won't find her there,\" she said. \"I guess we'll just light  out for ourselves, and wish the captain luck.\"    A stern chase is proverbially protracted, but on dry land it has usually  one end. Mine ended in Baden on the fifth (and first fine) day, rather  early in the afternoon. On arrival I drove straight to the  Darmstaedterhof, and asked to see no visitors' books, for the five days  had taken the edge off my finesse, but inquired at once whether a Mrs.  Lascelles was staying there or not. She was. It seemed incredible. Were  they sure she had not just left? They were sure. But she was not in; at  my request they made equally sure of that. She had probably gone to the  Conversationshaus, to listen to the band. All Baden went there in the  afternoon, to listen to that band. It was a very good band. Baden-Baden  was a very good place. There was "]]]
