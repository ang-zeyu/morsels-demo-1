Some of them remind us of some of  the best Proverbs of Solomon. In general, we should say that to his mind  filial piety and fraternal submission were the foundation of all  virtuous practices, and absolute obedience to rulers the primal  principle of government. He was eminently a peace man, discouraging wars  and violence. He was liberal and tolerant in his views. He said that the  \"superior man is catholic and no partisan.\" Duke Gae asked, \"What should  be done to secure the submission of the people?\" The sage replied,  \"Advance the upright, and set aside the crooked; then the people will  submit. But advance the crooked, and set aside the upright, and the  people will not submit.\" Again he said, \"It is virtuous manners which  constitute the excellence of a neighborhood; therefore fix your  residence where virtuous manners prevail.\" The following sayings remind  me of Epictetus: \"A scholar whose mind is set on truth, and who is  ashamed of bad clothes and bad food, is not fit to be discoursed with. A  man should say, 'I am not concerned that I have no place,--I am  concerned how I may fit myself for one. I am not concerned that I am not  known; I seek to be worthy to be known.'\" Here Confucius looks to the  essence of things, not to popular desires. In the following, on the  other hand, he shows his prudence and policy: \"In serving a prince,  frequent remonstrances lead to disgrace; between friends, frequent  reproofs make the friendship distant.\" Thus he talks like Solomon.  \"Tsae-yu, one of his disciples, being asleep in the day-time, the master  said, 'Rotten wood cannot be carved. This Yu--what is the use of my  reproving him?'\" Of a virtuous prince, he said: \"In his conduct of  himself, he was humble; in serving his superiors, he was respectful; in  nourishing the people, he was kind; in ordering the people, he  was just.\"    It was discussed among his followers what it is to be distinguished. One  said: \"It is to be heard of through the family and State.\" The master  replied: \"That is notoriety, not distinction.\" Again he said: \"Though a  man may be able to recite three hundred odes, yet if when intrusted with  office he does not know how to act, of what practical use is his  poetical knowledge?\" Again, \"If a minister cannot rectify himself, what  has he to do with rectifying others?\" There is great force in this  saying: \"The superior man is easy to serve and difficult to please,  since you cannot please him in any way which is not accordant with  right; but the mean man is difficult to serve and easy to please. The  superior man has a dignified ease without pride; the mean man has pride  without a dignified ease.\" A disciple asked him what qualities a man  must possess to entitle him to be called a scholar. The master said: \"He  must be earnest, urgent, and bland,--among his friends earnest and  urgent, among his brethren bland.\" And, \"The scholar who cherishes a  love of comfort is not fit to be deemed a scholar.\" \"If a man,\" he said,  \"take no thought about what is distant, he will find sorrow near at  hand.\" And again, \"He who requires much from himself and little from  others, he will keep himself from being an object of resentment.\" These  proverbs remind us of Bacon: \"Specious words confound virtue.\" \"Want of  forbearance in small matters confound great plans.\" \"Virtue,\" the master  said, \"is more to man than either fire or water. I have seen men die  from treading on water or fire, but I have never seen a man die from  treading the course of virtue.\" This is a lofty sentiment, but I think  it is not in accordance with the records of martyrdom. \"There are three  things,\" he continued, \"which the superior man guards against: In youth  he guards against his passions, in manhood against quarrelsomeness, and  in old age against covetousness.\"    I do not find anything in the sayings of Confucius that can be called  cynical, such as we find in some of the Proverbs of Solomon, even in  reference to women, where women were, as in most Oriental countries,  despised. The most that approaches cynicism is in such a remark as this:  \"I have not yet seen one who could perceive his faults and inwardly  accuse himself.\" His definition of perfect virtue is above that of  Paley: \"The man of virtue makes the difficulty to be overcome his first  business, and success only a secondary consideration.\" Throughout his  writings there is no praise of success without virtue, and no  disparagement of want of success with virtue. Nor have I found in his  sayings a sentiment which may be called demoralizing. He always takes  the higher ground, and with all his ceremony ever exalts inward purity  above all external appearances. There is a quaint common-sense in some  of his writings which reminds one of the sayings of Abraham Lincoln. For  instance: One of his disciples asked, \"If you had the conduct of  armies, whom would you have to act with you?\" The master replied: \"I  would not have him to act with me who will unarmed attack a tiger, or  cross a river without a boat.\" Here something like wit and irony break  out: \"A man of the village said, 'Great is K'ung the philosopher; his  learning is extensive, and yet he does not render his name famous by any  particular thing.' The master heard this observation, and said to his  disciples: 'What shall I practise, charioteering or archery? I will  practise charioteering.'\"    When the Duke of Loo asked about government, the master said: \"Good  government exists when those who are near are made happy, and when those  who are far off are attracted.\" When the Duke questioned him again on  the same subject, he replied: \"Go before the people with your example,  and be laborious in their affairs.... Pardon small faults, and raise to  office men of virtue and talents.\" \"But how shall I know the men of  virtue?\" asked the duke. \"Raise to office those whom you do know,\" The  key to his political philosophy seems to be this: \"A man who knows how  to govern himself, knows how to govern others; and he who knows how to  govern other men, knows how to govern an empire.\" \"The art of  government,\" he said, \"is to keep its affairs before the mind without  weariness, and to practise them with undeviating constancy.... To  govern means to rectify. If you lead on the people with correctness,  who will not dare to be correct?\" This is one of his favorite  principles; namely, the force of a good example,--as when the reigning  prince asked him how to do away with thieves, he replied: \"If you, Sir,  were not covetous, although you should reward them to do it, they would  not steal.\" This was not intended as a rebuke to the prince, but an  illustration of the force of a great example. Confucius rarely openly  rebuked any one, especially a prince, whom it was his duty to venerate  for his office. He contented himself with enforcing principles. Here his  moderation and great courtesy are seen.    Confucius sometimes soared to the highest morality known to the Pagan  world. Chung-kung asked about perfect virtue. The master said: \"It is  when you go abroad, to behave to every one as if you were receiving a  great guest, to have no murmuring against you in the country and family,  and not to do to others as you would not wish done to yourself.... The  superior man has neither anxiety nor fear. Let him never fail  reverentially to order his own conduct, and let him be respectful to  others and observant of propriety; then all within the four seas will be  brothers.... Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles, and be  moving continually to what is right.\" Fan-Chi asked about benevolence;  the master said: \"It is to love all men.\" Another asked about  friendship. Confucius replied: \"Faithfully admonish your friend, and  kindly try to lead him. If you find him impracticable, stop. Do not  disgrace yourself.\" This saying reminds us of that of our great Master:  \"Cast not your pearls before swine.\" There is no greater folly than in  making oneself disagreeable without any probability of reformation. Some  one asked: \"What do you say about the treatment of injuries?\" The master  answered: \"Recompense injury with justice, and recompense kindness with  kindness.\" Here again he was not far from the greater Teacher on the  Mount \"When a man's knowledge is sufficient to attain and his virtue is  not sufficient to hold, whatever he may have gained he will lose again.\"  One of the favorite doctrines of Confucius was the superiority of the  ancients to the men of his day. Said he: \"The high-mindedness of  antiquity showed itself in a disregard of small things; that of the  present day shows itself in license. The stern dignity of antiquity  showed itself in grave reserve; that of the present shows itself in  quarrelsome perverseness. The policy of antiquity showed itself in  straightforwardness; that of the present in deceit.\" The following is a  saying worthy of Montaigne: \"Of all people, girls and servants are the  most difficult to behave to. If you are familiar with them, they lose  their humility; if you maintain reserve to them, they are discontented.\"    Such are some of the sayings of Confucius, on account of which he was  regarded as the wisest of his countrymen; and as his conduct was in  harmony with his principles, he was justly revered as a pattern of  morality. The greatest virtues which he enjoined were sincerity,  truthfulness, and obedience to duty whatever may be the sacrifice; to do  right because it is right and not because it is expedient; filial piety  extending to absolute reverence; and an equal reverence for rulers. He  had no theology; he confounded God with heaven and earth. He says  nothing about divine providence; he believed in nothing supernatural. He  thought little and said less about a future state of rewards and  punishments. His morality was elevated, but not supernal. We infer from  his writings that his age was degenerate and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10478"],[0,"Beacon Lights of History, Volume 02: Jewish Heroes and Prophets (#19)"],[1,"done for you; but if ye shall do wickedly, ye shall be  consumed,--both ye and your king.\"    Saul for a time gave no offence worthy of rebuke, but was a valiant  captain, smiting the Philistines, who were the most powerful enemies  that the Israelites had yet encountered. But in an evil day he forgot  his true vocation, and took upon himself the function of a priest by  offering burnt sacrifices, which was not lawful but for the priest  alone. For this he was rebuked by Samuel. \"Thou hast done foolishly,\" he  said to the King; \"for which thy kingdom shall not continue. The Lord  hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the Lord hath commanded  him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which  the Lord commanded thee.\" We here see the blending of the theocratic  with the kingly rule.    Nevertheless Saul was prospered in his wars. He fought successfully the  Moabites, the Ammonites, the Edomites, the Amalekites, and the  Philistines, aided by his cousin Abner, whom he made captain of his  host. He did much to establish the kingdom; but he was rather a great  captain than a great man. He did not fully perceive his mission, which  was to fight, but meddled with affairs which belonged to the priests.  Nor was he always true to his mission as a warrior. He weakly spared  Agag, King of the Amalekites, which again called forth the displeasure  and denunciation of Samuel, who regarded the conduct of the King as  direct rebellion against God, since he was commanded to spare none of  that people, they having shown an uncompromising hostility to the  Israelites in their days of weakness, when first entering Canaan. This,  and similar commands laid upon the Israelites at various times, to  \"utterly destroy\" certain tribes or individuals and all of their  possessions, have been justified on the ground of the bestial grossness  and corruption of those pagan idolaters and the vileness of their  religious rites and social customs, which unfortunately always found a  temptable side on the part of the Israelites, and repeatedly brought to  nought the efforts of Jehovah's prophets to bring up their people in the  fear of the Lord, to recognize Him, only, as God. It was not easy for  that sensual race to stand on the height of Moses, and \"endure as seeing  him who is invisible.\" They too easily fell into idolatry; hence the  necessity of the extermination of some of the nests of iniquity  in Canaan.    Whether Saul spared Agag because of his personal beauty, to grace his  royal triumph, or whatever the motive, it was a direct disobedience; and  when the king attempted to exculpate himself, inasmuch as he had made a  sacrifice of the spoil to the Lord, Samuel replied: \"Hath the Lord as  great delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices as in obeying his  voice?... Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than  the fat of rams,--for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and  stubbornness as an iniquity and idolatry.\" The prophet here sets forth,  as did Isaiah in later times, the great principles of moral obligation  as paramount over all ceremonial observances. He strikes a blow at all  pharisaism and all self-righteousness, and inculcates obedience to  direct commands as the highest duty of man.    Saul, perceiving that he had sinned, confessed his transgression, but  palliated it by saying that he feared the people. But this policy of  expediency had no weight with the prophet, although Saul repented and  sought pardon. Samuel continued his stern rebuke, and uttered his  fearful message, saying, \"Jehovah hath rent the kingdom of Israel from  thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbor of thine that is better  than thou.\" Furthermore Samuel demanded that Agag, whom Saul had spared,  should be brought before him; and he took upon himself with his aged  hand the work of executioner, and hewed the king of the Amalekites in  pieces in Gilgal. He then finally departed from Saul, and mournfully  went to his own house in Ramah, and Saul saw him no more. As the king  was the \"Lord's anointed,\" Samuel could not openly rebel against kingly  authority, but he would henceforth have nothing to do with the  headstrong ruler. He withdrew from him all spiritual guidance, and left  him to his follies and madness; for the inextinguishable jealousy of  Saul, that now began to appear, was a species of insanity, which  poisoned his whole subsequent life. The people continued loyal to a king  whom God had selected, but Samuel \"came no more to see Saul until the  day of his death.\" To be deserted by such a counsellor as Samuel, was no  small calamity.    Meanwhile, in obedience to instructions from God, Samuel proceeded to  Bethlehem, to the humble abode of Jesse, of the tribe of Judah, one of  whose sons he was required to anoint as the future king of Israel. He  naturally was about to select the largest and finest looking of the  seven sons; but God looketh on the heart rather than the outward  appearance, and David, a mere youth, and the youngest of the family, was  the one indicated by Jehovah, and was privately anointed by the prophet.    Saul, of course, did not know on whom the choice had fallen as his  successor, but from that day on which he was warned of the penalty of  his disobedience divine favor departed from him, and he became jealous,  fitful, and cruel. He presented a striking contrast to the character he  had shown in his early days,--being no longer modest and humble, but  proud and tyrannical. Prosperity and power had turned his head, and  developed all that was evil in him. Nero was not more unreasonable and  bloodthirsty than was Saul in his latter days. Prosperity developed in  Solomon a love of magnificence, in Nebuchadnezzar a towering vanity, but  in Saul a malignant envy of all extraordinary merit, and a sullen  determination to destroy the persons it adorned. The last person in his  kingdom of whom apparently he had reason to be jealous, was the ruddy  and beardless youth whom he had sent for to drive away his melancholy by  his songs and music. Nor was it until David killed Goliath that Saul  became jealous; before this he had no cause of envy, for kings do not  envy musicians, but reward them. David's reward was as extravagant as  that which Russian emperors shower upon singers and dancers: he was made  armor-bearer to the King,--an office bestowed only upon favorites and  those who were implicitly trusted and beloved. Little did the moody and  jealous King imagine that the youth whom he had brought from obscurity  to amuse his melancholy hours by his music, and probably his wit and  humor, would so soon, by his own sanction, become the champion of  Israel, and ultimately his successor on the throne.    In the latter part of the reign of Saul the enemies with whom he had to  contend were the various Canaanitish nations that had remained  unconquered during the hard struggle of four hundred years after the  Hebrews had been led by Joshua to the promised land. The most powerful  of these nations were the Philistines. \"Strong in their military  organization, fierce in their warlike spirit, and rich by their position  and commercial instincts, they even threatened the ancient supremacy of  the Phoenicians of the north. Their cities were the restless centres of  every form of activity. Ashdod and Gaza, as the keys of Egypt, commanded  the carrying trade to and from the Nile, and formed the great depots for  its imports and exports. All the cities, moreover, traded in slaves with  Edom and southern Arabia, and their commerce in other directions  flourished so greatly as to gain for the people at large the name of  Canaanites,--which was synonymous with 'merchant,' Even the word  'Palestine' is derived from the Philistines. Their skill as smiths and  armorers was noted; the strength of their cities attest their strength  as builders, and their idols and golden mice and emerods show their  respect for the arts of peace.\" It is supposed that they had settled in  Canaan about the time of Abraham, and were originally a pastoral people  in the neighborhood of Gesar, or emigrants from Crete. When the  Israelites under Joshua arrived, they were in full possession of the  southern part of Palestine, and had formed a confederacy of five  powerful cities,--Gaza, Ashdod, Askelon, Gath, and Ekron. In the time  of the Judges they had become so prosperous and powerful that they held  the Israelites in partial subjection, broken at intervals by heroes like  Shamgar and Samson. Under Eli there was an organized but unsuccessful  resistance to these prosperous and warlike heathen. Under Samuel the  tide of success was turned in Israel's favor at the battle of Mizpeh,  when the Israelites erected their pillar at Ebenezer as a token of  victory. The battle of Michmash, gained by Saul and Jonathan after an  immense slaughter of their foes, was so decisive that for twenty-five  years the Israelites were unmolested. In the latter part of the reign of  Saul the Philistines attempted to regain their ascendency, but on the  death of Goliath at the hand of David they were driven to their own  territories. The battle of Gilboa, where Saul and Jonathan were slain,  again turned the scale in favor of the Philistines. Under David the  Israelites resumed the aggressive, took Gath, and completely broke  forever the ascendency of their powerful foes. Under Solomon it would  appear that the whole of Philistia was incorporated with the Hebrew  monarchy, and remained so until the calamities of the Jews gave  Philistia to the Assyrian conquerors of Jerusalem, and finally it fell  into the hands of the Romans. The Philistines were zealous idolaters,  and in times of great religious apostasy they succeeded in introducing  the worship of their gods among the Israelites, especially that of Baal  and Ashtaroth.    Samuel did not live to see the complete humiliation of his nation which  succeeded the bloody battle"]]]
