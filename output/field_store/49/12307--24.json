And that on earth  Thou mayst bear tidings of me, know that I  Am Bertrand, he of Born, who gave King John  The counsel mischievous.  Father and son  I set at mutual war.  For Absalom  And David more did not Ahitophel,  Spurring them on maliciously to strife.  For parting those so closely knit, my brain  Parted, alas!  I carry from its source,  That in this trunk inhabits.  Thus the law  Of retribution fiercely works in me.\"          CANTO XXIX    SO were mine eyes inebriate with view  Of the vast multitude, whom various wounds  Disfigur'd, that they long'd to stay and weep.    But Virgil rous'd me: \"What yet gazest on?  Wherefore doth fasten yet thy sight below  Among the maim'd and miserable shades?  Thou hast not shewn in any chasm beside  This weakness.  Know, if thou wouldst number them  That two and twenty miles the valley winds  Its circuit, and already is the moon  Beneath our feet: the time permitted now  Is short, and more not seen remains to see.\"    \"If thou,\" I straight replied, \"hadst weigh'd the cause  For which I look'd, thou hadst perchance excus'd  The tarrying still.\"  My leader part pursu'd  His way, the while I follow'd, answering him,  And adding thus: \"Within that cave I deem,  Whereon so fixedly I held my ken,  There is a spirit dwells, one of my blood,  Wailing the crime that costs him now so dear.\"    Then spake my master: \"Let thy soul no more  Afflict itself for him.  Direct elsewhere  Its thought, and leave him.  At the bridge's foot  I mark'd how he did point with menacing look  At thee, and heard him by the others nam'd  Geri of Bello.  Thou so wholly then  Wert busied with his spirit, who once rul'd  The towers of Hautefort, that thou lookedst not  That way, ere he was gone.\"--\"O guide belov'd!  His violent death yet unaveng'd,\" said I,  \"By any, who are partners in his shame,  Made him contemptuous: therefore, as I think,  He pass'd me speechless by; and doing so  Hath made me more compassionate his fate.\"    So we discours'd to where the rock first show'd  The other valley, had more light been there,  E'en to the lowest depth.  Soon as we came  O'er the last cloister in the dismal rounds  Of Malebolge, and the brotherhood  Were to our view expos'd, then many a dart  Of sore lament assail'd me, headed all  With points of thrilling pity, that I clos'd  Both ears against the volley with mine hands.    As were the torment, if each lazar-house  Of Valdichiana, in the sultry time  'Twixt July and September, with the isle  Sardinia and Maremma's pestilent fen,  Had heap'd their maladies all in one foss  Together; such was here the torment: dire  The stench, as issuing steams from fester'd limbs.    We on the utmost shore of the long rock  Descended still to leftward.  Then my sight  Was livelier to explore the depth, wherein  The minister of the most mighty Lord,  All-searching Justice, dooms to punishment  The forgers noted on her dread record.    More rueful was it not methinks to see  The nation in Aegina droop, what time  Each living thing, e'en to the little worm,  All fell, so full of malice was the air  (And afterward, as bards of yore have told,  The ancient people were restor'd anew  From seed of emmets) than was here to see  The spirits, that languish'd through the murky vale  Up-pil'd on many a stack.  Confus'd they lay,  One o'er the belly, o'er the shoulders one  Roll'd of another; sideling crawl'd a third  Along the dismal pathway.  Step by step  We journey'd on, in silence looking round  And list'ning those diseas'd, who strove in vain  To lift their forms.  Then two I mark'd, that sat  Propp'd 'gainst each other, as two brazen pans  Set to retain the heat.  From head to foot,  A tetter bark'd them round. Nor saw I e'er  Groom currying so fast, for whom his lord  Impatient waited, or himself perchance  Tir'd with long watching, as of these each one  Plied quickly his keen nails, through furiousness  Of ne'er abated pruriency.  The crust  Came drawn from underneath in flakes, like scales  Scrap'd from the bream or fish of broader mail.    \"O thou, who with thy fingers rendest off  Thy coat of proof,\" thus spake my guide to one,  \"And sometimes makest tearing pincers of them,  Tell me if any born of Latian land  Be among these within: so may thy nails  Serve thee for everlasting to this toil.\"    \"Both are of Latium,\" weeping he replied,  \"Whom tortur'd thus thou seest: but who art thou  That hast inquir'd of us?\"  To whom my guide:  \"One that descend with this man, who yet lives,  From rock to rock, and show him hell's abyss.\"    Then started they asunder, and each turn'd  Trembling toward us, with the rest, whose ear  Those words redounding struck.  To me my liege  Address'd him: \"Speak to them whate'er thou list.\"    And I therewith began: \"So may no time  Filch your remembrance from the thoughts of men  In th' upper world, but after many suns  Survive it, as ye tell me, who ye are,  And of what race ye come.  Your punishment,  Unseemly and disgustful in its kind,  Deter you not from opening thus much to me.\"    \"Arezzo was my dwelling,\" answer'd one,  \"And me Albero of Sienna brought  To die by fire; but that, for which I died,  Leads me not here.  True is in sport I told him,  That I had learn'd to wing my flight in air.  And he admiring much, as he was void  Of wisdom, will'd me to declare to him  The secret of mine art: and only hence,  Because I made him not a Daedalus,  Prevail'd on one suppos'd his sire to burn me.  But Minos to this chasm last of the ten,  For that I practis'd alchemy on earth,  Has doom'd me.  Him no subterfuge eludes.\"    Then to the bard I spake: \"Was ever race  Light as Sienna's?  Sure not France herself  Can show a tribe so frivolous and vain.\"    The other leprous spirit heard my words,  And thus return'd: \"Be Stricca from this charge  Exempted, he who knew so temp'rately  To lay out fortune's gifts; and Niccolo  Who first the spice's costly luxury  Discover'd in that garden, where such seed  Roots deepest in the soil: and be that troop  Exempted, with whom Caccia of Asciano  Lavish'd his vineyards and wide-spreading woods,  And his rare wisdom Abbagliato show'd  A spectacle for all.  That thou mayst know  Who seconds thee against the Siennese  Thus gladly, bend this way thy sharpen'd sight,  That well my face may answer to thy ken;  So shalt thou see I am Capocchio's ghost,  Who forg'd transmuted metals by the power  Of alchemy; and if I scan thee right,  Thus needs must well remember how I aped  Creative nature by my subtle art.\"          CANTO XXX    WHAT time resentment burn'd in Juno's breast  For Semele against the Theban blood,  As more than once in dire mischance was rued,  Such fatal frenzy seiz'd on Athamas,  That he his spouse beholding with a babe  Laden on either arm, \"Spread out,\" he cried,  \"The meshes, that I take the lioness  And the young lions at the pass:\" then forth  Stretch'd he his merciless talons, grasping one,  One helpless innocent, Learchus nam'd,  Whom swinging down he dash'd upon a rock,  And with her other burden self-destroy'd  The hapless mother plung'd: and when the pride  Of all-presuming Troy fell from its height,  By fortune overwhelm'd, and the old king  With his realm perish'd, then did Hecuba,  A wretch forlorn and captive, when she saw  Polyxena first slaughter'd, and her son,  Her Polydorus, on the wild sea-beach  Next met the mourner's view, then reft of sense  Did she run barking even as a dog;  Such mighty power had grief to wrench her soul.  Bet ne'er the Furies or of Thebes or Troy  With such fell cruelty were seen, their goads  Infixing in the limbs of man or beast,  As now two pale and naked ghost I saw  That gnarling wildly scamper'd, like the swine  Excluded from his stye.  One reach'd Capocchio,  And in the neck-joint sticking deep his fangs,  Dragg'd him, that o'er the solid pavement rubb'd  His belly stretch'd out prone.  The other shape,  He of Arezzo, there left trembling, spake;  \"That sprite of air is Schicchi; in like mood  Of random mischief vents he still his spite.\"    To whom I answ'ring: \"Oh! as thou dost hope,  The other may not flesh its jaws on thee,  Be patient to inform us, who it is,  Ere it speed hence.\"--\"That is the ancient soul  Of wretched Myrrha,\" he replied, \"who burn'd  With most unholy flame for her own sire,    \"And a false shape assuming, so perform'd  The deed of sin; e'en as the other there,  That onward passes, dar'd to counterfeit  Donati's features, to feign'd testament  The seal affixing, that himself might gain,  For his own share, the lady of the herd.\"    When vanish'd the two furious shades, on whom  Mine eye was held, I turn'd it back to view  The other cursed spirits.  One I saw  In fashion like a lute, had but the groin  Been sever'd, where it meets the forked part.  Swoln dropsy, disproportioning the limbs  With ill-converted moisture, that the paunch  Suits not the visage, open'd wide his lips  Gasping as in the hectic man for drought,  One towards the chin, the other upward curl'd.    \"O ye, who in this world of misery,  Wherefore I know not, are exempt from pain,\"  Thus he began, \"attentively regard  Adamo's woe.  When living, full supply  Ne'er lack'd me of what most I coveted;  One drop of water now, alas!  I crave.  The rills, that glitter down the grassy slopes  Of Casentino, making fresh and soft  The banks whereby they glide to Arno's stream,  Stand ever in my view; and not in vain;  For more the pictur'd semblance dries me up,  Much more than the disease, which makes the flesh  Desert these shrivel'd cheeks.  So from the place,  Where I transgress'd, stern justice urging me,  Takes means to quicken more my lab'ring sighs.  There is Romena, where I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8795"],[0,"The Divine Comedy (#18)"],[1,"waters bent the grass,  That issued from its brink.  On earth no wave  How clean soe'er, that would not seem to have  Some mixture in itself, compar'd with this,  Transpicuous, clear; yet darkly on it roll'd,  Darkly beneath perpetual gloom, which ne'er  Admits or sun or moon light there to shine.    My feet advanc'd not; but my wond'ring eyes  Pass'd onward, o'er the streamlet, to survey  The tender May-bloom, flush'd through many a hue,  In prodigal variety: and there,  As object, rising suddenly to view,  That from our bosom every thought beside  With the rare marvel chases, I beheld  A lady all alone, who, singing, went,  And culling flower from flower, wherewith her way  Was all o'er painted.  \"Lady beautiful!  Thou, who (if looks, that use to speak the heart,  Are worthy of our trust), with love's own beam  Dost warm thee,\" thus to her my speech I fram'd:  \"Ah! please thee hither towards the streamlet bend  Thy steps so near, that I may list thy song.  Beholding thee and this fair place, methinks,  I call to mind where wander'd and how look'd  Proserpine, in that season, when her child  The mother lost, and she the bloomy spring.\"    As when a lady, turning in the dance,  Doth foot it featly, and advances scarce  One step before the other to the ground;  Over the yellow and vermilion flowers  Thus turn'd she at my suit, most maiden-like,  Valing her sober eyes, and came so near,  That I distinctly caught the dulcet sound.  Arriving where the limped waters now  Lav'd the green sward, her eyes she deign'd to raise,  That shot such splendour on me, as I ween  Ne'er glanced from Cytherea's, when her son  Had sped his keenest weapon to her heart.  Upon the opposite bank she stood and smil'd  through her graceful fingers shifted still  The intermingling dyes, which without seed  That lofty land unbosoms.  By the stream  Three paces only were we sunder'd: yet  The Hellespont, where Xerxes pass'd it o'er,  (A curb for ever to the pride of man)  Was by Leander not more hateful held  For floating, with inhospitable wave  'Twixt Sestus and Abydos, than by me  That flood, because it gave no passage thence.    \"Strangers ye come, and haply in this place,  That cradled human nature in its birth,  Wond'ring, ye not without suspicion view  My smiles: but that sweet strain of psalmody,  'Thou, Lord! hast made me glad,' will give ye light,  Which may uncloud your minds.  And thou, who stand'st  The foremost, and didst make thy suit to me,  Say if aught else thou wish to hear: for I  Came prompt to answer every doubt of thine.\"    She spake; and I replied: \"I know not how  To reconcile this wave and rustling sound  Of forest leaves, with what I late have heard  Of opposite report.\"  She answering thus:  \"I will unfold the cause, whence that proceeds,  Which makes thee wonder; and so purge the cloud  That hath enwraps thee.  The First Good, whose joy  Is only in himself, created man  For happiness, and gave this goodly place,  His pledge and earnest of eternal peace.  Favour'd thus highly, through his own defect  He fell, and here made short sojourn; he fell,  And, for the bitterness of sorrow, chang'd  Laughter unblam'd and ever-new delight.  That vapours none, exhal'd from earth beneath,  Or from the waters (which, wherever heat  Attracts them, follow), might ascend thus far  To vex man's peaceful state, this mountain rose  So high toward the heav'n, nor fears the rage  Of elements contending, from that part  Exempted, where the gate his limit bars.  Because the circumambient air throughout  With its first impulse circles still, unless  Aught interpose to cheek or thwart its course;  Upon the summit, which on every side  To visitation of th' impassive air  Is open, doth that motion strike, and makes  Beneath its sway th' umbrageous wood resound:  And in the shaken plant such power resides,  That it impregnates with its efficacy  The voyaging breeze, upon whose subtle plume  That wafted flies abroad; and th' other land  Receiving (as 't is worthy in itself,  Or in the clime, that warms it), doth conceive,  And from its womb produces many a tree  Of various virtue.  This when thou hast heard,  The marvel ceases, if in yonder earth  Some plant without apparent seed be found  To fix its fibrous stem.  And further learn,  That with prolific foison of all seeds,  This holy plain is fill'd, and in itself  Bears fruit that ne'er was pluck'd on other soil.    \"The water, thou behold'st, springs not from vein,  As stream, that intermittently repairs  And spends his pulse of life, but issues forth  From fountain, solid, undecaying, sure;  And by the will omnific, full supply  Feeds whatsoe'er On either side it pours;  On this devolv'd with power to take away  Remembrance of offence, on that to bring  Remembrance back of every good deed done.  From whence its name of Lethe on this part;  On th' other Eunoe: both of which must first  Be tasted ere it work; the last exceeding  All flavours else.  Albeit thy thirst may now  Be well contented, if I here break off,  No more revealing: yet a corollary  I freely give beside: nor deem my words  Less grateful to thee, if they somewhat pass  The stretch of promise.  They, whose verse of yore  The golden age recorded and its bliss,  On the Parnassian mountain, of this place  Perhaps had dream'd.  Here was man guiltless, here  Perpetual spring and every fruit, and this  The far-fam'd nectar.\"  Turning to the bards,  When she had ceas'd, I noted in their looks  A smile at her conclusion; then my face  Again directed to the lovely dame.          CANTO XXIX    Singing, as if enamour'd, she resum'd  And clos'd the song, with \"Blessed they whose sins  Are cover'd.\"  Like the wood-nymphs then, that tripp'd  Singly across the sylvan shadows, one  Eager to view and one to 'scape the sun,  So mov'd she on, against the current, up  The verdant rivage.  I, her mincing step  Observing, with as tardy step pursued.    Between us not an hundred paces trod,  The bank, on each side bending equally,  Gave me to face the orient.  Nor our way  Far onward brought us, when to me at once  She turn'd, and cried: \"My brother! look and hearken.\"  And lo! a sudden lustre ran across  Through the great forest on all parts, so bright  I doubted whether lightning were abroad;  But that expiring ever in the spleen,  That doth unfold it, and this during still  And waxing still in splendor, made me question  What it might be: and a sweet melody  Ran through the luminous air.  Then did I chide  With warrantable zeal the hardihood  Of our first parent, for that there were earth  Stood in obedience to the heav'ns, she only,  Woman, the creature of an hour, endur'd not  Restraint of any veil: which had she borne  Devoutly, joys, ineffable as these,  Had from the first, and long time since, been mine.    While through that wilderness of primy sweets  That never fade, suspense I walk'd, and yet  Expectant of beatitude more high,  Before us, like a blazing fire, the air  Under the green boughs glow'd; and, for a song,  Distinct the sound of melody was heard.    O ye thrice holy virgins! for your sakes  If e'er I suffer'd hunger, cold and watching,  Occasion calls on me to crave your bounty.  Now through my breast let Helicon his stream  Pour copious; and Urania with her choir  Arise to aid me: while the verse unfolds  Things that do almost mock the grasp of thought.    Onward a space, what seem'd seven trees of gold,  The intervening distance to mine eye  Falsely presented; but when I was come  So near them, that no lineament was lost  Of those, with which a doubtful object, seen  Remotely, plays on the misdeeming sense,  Then did the faculty, that ministers  Discourse to reason, these for tapers of gold  Distinguish, and it th' singing trace the sound  \"Hosanna.\"  Above, their beauteous garniture  Flam'd with more ample lustre, than the moon  Through cloudless sky at midnight in her full.    I turn'd me full of wonder to my guide;  And he did answer with a countenance  Charg'd with no less amazement: whence my view  Reverted to those lofty things, which came  So slowly moving towards us, that the bride  Would have outstript them on her bridal day.    The lady called aloud: \"Why thus yet burns  Affection in thee for these living, lights,  And dost not look on that which follows them?\"    I straightway mark'd a tribe behind them walk,  As if attendant on their leaders, cloth'd  With raiment of such whiteness, as on earth  Was never.  On my left, the wat'ry gleam  Borrow'd, and gave me back, when there I look'd.  As in a mirror, my left side portray'd.    When I had chosen on the river's edge  Such station, that the distance of the stream  Alone did separate me; there I stay'd  My steps for clearer prospect, and beheld  The flames go onward, leaving, as they went,  The air behind them painted as with trail  Of liveliest pencils! so distinct were mark'd  All those sev'n listed colours, whence the sun  Maketh his bow, and Cynthia her zone.  These streaming gonfalons did flow beyond  My vision; and ten paces, as I guess,  Parted the outermost.  Beneath a sky  So beautiful, came foul and-twenty elders,  By two and two, with flower-de-luces crown'd.    All sang one song: \"Blessed be thou among  The daughters of Adam! and thy loveliness  Blessed for ever!\"  After that the flowers,  And the fresh herblets, on the opposite brink,  Were free from that elected race; as light  In heav'n doth second light, came after them  Four animals, each crown'd with verdurous leaf.  With six wings each was plum'd, the plumage full  Of eyes, and th' eyes of Argus would be such,  Were they endued with life.  Reader, more rhymes  Will not waste in shadowing forth their form:  For other need no straitens, that in this  I may not give my bounty room.  But read  Ezekiel; for he paints them, from the north  How he beheld them come by Chebar's flood,  In whirlwind, cloud and fire; and even such  As thou shalt find them character'd by him,  Here were they; save"]]]
