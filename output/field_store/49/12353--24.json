And Miriam the sister of Aaron, a prophetess, took a timpane in her  hand, and all the women followed her with timpanes and chords, and she  went tofore singing Cantemus domino. Then Moses brought the children of  Israel from the sea into the desert of Sur, and walked with them three  days and three nights and found no water, and came into Marah, and the  waters there were so bitter that they might not drink thereof. Then the  people grudged against Moses, saying: What shall we drink? And he cried  unto our Lord which showed to him a tree which he took and put into the  waters, and anon they were turned into sweetness. There our Lord  ordained commandments and judgments, and there he tempted him saying: If  thou hearest the voice of thy Lord-God, and that thou do is rightful  before him, and obeyest his commandments, and keep his precepts, I shall  not bring none of the languors ne sorrows upon thee that I did in Egypt.  I am Lord thy saviour. Then the children of Israel came in to Elim,  where as were twelve fountains of water, and seventy palm trees, and  they abode by the waters. Then from thence went all the multitude of the  children of Israel into the desert of Sin, which is between Elim and  Sinai, and grudged against Moses and Aaron in that wilderness, and said:  Would God we had dwelled still in Egypt, whereas we sat and had plenty  of bread and flesh; why have ye brought us into the desert for to slay  all this multitude by hunger? Our Lord said then to Moses: I shall rain  bread to you from heaven, let the people go out and gather every day  that I may prove them whether they walk in my law or not; the sixth day  let them gather double as much as they gather in one day of the other.  Then said Moses and Aaron to all the children of Israel: At even ye  shall know that God hath brought you from the land of Egypt, and to-morn  ye shall see the glory of our Lord. I have well heard your murmur  against our Lord, what have ye mused against us? what be we? and yet  said Moses; Our Lord shall give you at even flesh for to eat and to-morn  bread unto your fill, for as much as ye have murmured against him; what  be we? Your murmur is not against us but against our Lord. As Aaron  spake to all the company of the children of Israel they beheld toward  the wilderness, and our Lord spake to Moses in a cloud and said: I have  heard the grudgings of the children of Israel; say to them: At even ye  shall eat flesh and to-morn ye shall be filled with bread, and ye shall  know that I am your Lord God. And when the even was come there came so  many curlews that it covered all their lodgings, and on the morn there  lay like dew all about in their circuit. Which when they saw and came  for to gather, it was small and white like to coriander. And they  wondered on it and said: Mahun, that is as much to say, what is this? To  whom Moses said: This is the bread that God hath sent you to eat, and  God commandeth that every man should gather as much for every head as is  the measure of gomor, and let nothing be left till on the morn. And the  sixth day gather ye double so much, that is two measures of gomor, and  keep that one measure for the Sabbath, which God hath sanctified and  commanded you to hallow it. Yet some of them brake God's commandment,  and gathered more than they ate and kept it till on the morn, and then  it began to putrify and be full of worms. And that they kept for the  Sabbath day was good and putrified not. And thus our Lord fed the  children of Israel forty years in the desert. And it was called Manna.  Moses took one gomor thereof and put it in the tabernacle for to be kept  for a perpetual memory and remembrance.    Then went they forth all the multitude of the children of Israel, in the  desert of Sin in their mansions and came, to Rephidim, where as they had  no water. Then all grudging they said to Moses, Give us water for to  drink. To whom Moses answered: What grudge ye against me, why tempt ye  our Lord? The people thirsted sore for lack and penury of water saying:  Why hast thou brought us out of Egypt for to slay us and our children  and beasts? Then Moses cried unto our Lord saying: What shall I do to  this people? I trow within a while they shall stone me to death. Then  our Lord said to Moses: Go before the people and take with thee the  older men and seniors of Israel, and take the rod that thou smotest with  the flood in thy hand, and I shall stand tofore upon the stone of Oreb,  and smite thou the stone with the rod and the waters shall come out  thereof that the people may drink. Moses did so tofore the seniors of  Israel and called that place Temptation, because of the grudge of the  children of Israel, and said: Is God with us or not? Then came Amalek  and fought against the children of Israel in Rephidim. Moses said then  to Joshua: Choose to thee men, and go out and fight against Amalek  to-morrow. I shall stand on the top of the hill having the rod of God in  my hand: Joshua did as Moses commanded him, and fought against Amalek.  Moses, Aaron, and Hur ascended into the hill, and when Moses held up  his hands, Israel won and overcame their enemies, and when he laid them  down then Amalek had the better. The hands of Moses were heavy; Aaron  and Hur took then a stone and put it under them, and they sustained his  hands on either side, and so his hands were not weary until the going  down of the sun. And so Joshua made Amalek to flee, and his people, by  strength of his sword. Our Lord said to Moses: Write this for a  remembrance in a book and deliver it to the ears of Joshua; I shall  destroy and put away the memory of Amalek under heaven. Moses then  edified an altar unto our Lord, and called there on the name of our  Lord, saying: The Lord is mine exaltation, for this is the hand only of  God, and the battle and God shall be against Amalek from generation to  generation.    When Jethro the priest of Midian, which was cousin of Moses, heard say  what our Lord had done to Moses and to the children of Israel his  people, he took Zipporah the wife of Moses, and his two sons, Gershom  and Eleazar and came with them to him into desert, whom Moses received  with worship and kissed him. And when they were together Moses told him  all what our Lord had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel,  and all the labor that they endured and how our Lord had delivered them.  Jethro was glad for all these things, that God had so saved them from  the hands of the Egyptians and said: Blessed be the Lord that hath  delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and of Pharaoh, and hath  saved his people; now I know that he is a great Lord above all gods,  because they did so proudly against them. And Jethro offered sacrifices  and offerings to our Lord. Aaron and all the seniors of Israel came and  eat with him tofore our Lord. The next day Moses sat and judged and  deemed the people from morning unto evening, which, when his cousin saw,  he said to him: What doest thou? Why sittest thou alone and all the  people tarry from the morning until evening? To whom Moses answered: The  people came to me demanding sentence and the doom of God; when there is  any debate or difference among them they come to me to judge them, and  to show to them the precepts and the laws of God. Then said Jethro: Thou  dost not well nor wisely, for by folly thou consumest thy self, and the  people with thee; thou dost above thy might, thou mayst not alone  sustain it, but hear me and do there after, and our Lord shall be with  thee. Be thou unto the people in those things that appertain to God,  that thou tell to them what they should do, and the ceremonies and rites  to worship God, and the way by which they should go, and what work they  shall do. Provide of all people wise men and dreading God, in whom is  truth, and them that hate avarice and covetise, and ordain of them  tribunes and centurions and deans that may in all times judge the  people. And if there be of a great charge and weight, let it be referred  to thee, and let them judge the small things; it shall be the easier to  thee to bear the charge when it is so parted. If thou do so, thou shalt  fulfil the commandment of God, and sustain his precepts, and the people  shall go home to their places in peace. Which things when Moses had  heard and understood, he did all that he had counselled him, and chose  out the strongest and wisest people of all Israel and ordained them  princes of the people, tribunes, centurions, quinquagenaries, and deans,  which at all times should judge and deem the people. And all the great  and weighty matters they referred to him, deeming and judging the small  causes. And then his cousin departed and went into his country.    The third month after the children of Israel departed out of Egypt, that  same day they came into the wilderness of Sinai, and there about the  region of the mount they fixed their tents. Moses ascended into the hill  unto God. God called him on the hill and said: This shalt thou say to  the house of Jacob and to the children of Israel. Ye yourselves have  seen what I have done to the Egyptians, and how I have borne you on the  wings of eagles and have taken you to me. If ye therefore hear my voice  and keep my covenant, ye shall be to me in the reign of priesthood and  holy people. These be the words that thou shalt say to the children of  Israel. Moses came down and gathered all the most of birth, and  expounded in them all the words that our Lord had commanded him. All the  people answered: All that ever our Lord hath said we shall do,    When Moses had showed the people the words of our Lord, our Lord said to  him: Now I shall come to thee in a cloud that the people may hear me  speaking to thee, that they believe thee ever after.

As long as there is any sap in the  pasturage they seldom need water. But should a traveler see the \"spoor\"  of a rhinoceros, or buffalo, or zebra, he would at once follow it up,  well assured that before he had gone many miles he would certainly reach  water.    In the evening of our second day at Serotli, a hyaena, appearing  suddenly among the grass, succeeded in raising a panic among our cattle.  This false mode of attack is the plan which this cowardly animal always  adopts. His courage resembles closely that of a turkey-cock. He will  bite, if an animal is running away; but if the animal stand still, so  does he. Seventeen of our draught oxen ran away, and in their flight  went right into the hands of Sekomi, whom, from his being unfriendly to  our success, we had no particular wish to see. Cattle-stealing, such as  in the circumstances might have occurred in Caffraria, is here unknown;  so Sekomi sent back our oxen, and a message strongly dissuading us  against attempting the Desert. \"Where are you going? You will be killed  by the sun and thirst, and then all the white men will blame me for not  saving you.\" This was backed by a private message from his mother. \"Why  do you pass me? I always made the people collect to hear the word that  you have got. What guilt have I, that you pass without looking at me?\"  We replied by assuring the messengers that the white men would attribute  our deaths to our own stupidity and \"hard-headedness\" (tlogo, e thata),  \"as we did not intend to allow our companions and guides to return till  they had put us into our graves.\" We sent a handsome present to Sekomi,  and a promise that, if he allowed the Bakalahari to keep the wells open  for us, we would repeat the gift on our return.    After exhausting all his eloquence in fruitless attempts to persuade us  to return, the under-chief, who headed the party of Sekomi's messengers,  inquired, \"Who is taking them?\" Looking round, he exclaimed, with a face  expressive of the most unfeigned disgust, \"It is Ramotobi!\" Our guide  belonged to Sekomi's tribe, but had fled to Sechele; as fugitives in  this country are always well received, and may even afterward visit the  tribe from which they had escaped, Ramotobi was in no danger, though  doing that which he knew to be directly opposed to the interests of his  own chief and tribe.    All around Serotli the country is perfectly flat, and composed of  soft white sand. There is a peculiar glare of bright sunlight from a  cloudless sky over the whole scene; and one clump of trees and bushes,  with open spaces between, looks so exactly like another, that if you  leave the wells, and walk a quarter of a mile in any direction, it is  difficult to return. Oswell and Murray went out on one occasion to get  an eland, and were accompanied by one of the Bakalahari. The perfect  sameness of the country caused even this son of the Desert to lose his  way; a most puzzling conversation forthwith ensued between them and  their guide. One of the most common phrases of the people is \"Kia  itumela\", I thank you, or I am pleased; and the gentlemen were both  quite familiar with it, and with the word \"metse\", water. But there is a  word very similar in sound, \"Kia timela\", I am wandering; its perfect  is \"Ki timetse\", I have wandered. The party had been roaming about,  perfectly lost, till the sun went down; and, through their mistaking the  verb \"wander\" for \"to be pleased\", and \"water\", the colloquy went on at  intervals during the whole bitterly cold night in somewhat the following  style:    \"Where are the wagons?\"    REAL ANSWER. \"I don't know. I have wandered. I never wandered before. I  am quite lost.\"    SUPPOSED ANSWER. \"I don't know. I want water. I am glad, I am quite  pleased. I am thankful to you.\"    \"Take us to the wagons, and you will get plenty of water.\"    REAL ANSWER (looking vacantly around). \"How did I wander? Perhaps the  well is there, perhaps not. I don't know. I have wandered.\"    SUPPOSED ANSWER. \"Something about thanks; he says he is pleased, and  mentions water again.\" The guide's vacant stare while trying to remember  is thought to indicate mental imbecility, and the repeated thanks were  supposed to indicate a wish to deprecate their wrath.    \"Well, Livingstone HAS played us a pretty trick, giving us in charge of  an idiot. Catch us trusting him again. What can this fellow mean by his  thanks and talk about water? Oh, you born fool! take us to the wagons,  and you will get both meat and water. Wouldn't a thrashing bring him to  his senses again?\" \"No, no, for then he will run away, and we shall be  worse off than we are now.\"    The hunters regained the wagons next day by their own sagacity, which  becomes wonderfully quickened by a sojourn in the Desert; and we enjoyed  a hearty laugh on the explanation of their midnight colloquies. Frequent  mistakes of this kind occur. A man may tell his interpreter to say that  he is a member of the family of the chief of the white men; \"YES, YOU  SPEAK LIKE A CHIEF,\" is the reply, meaning, as they explain it, that a  chief may talk nonsense without any one daring to contradict him.  They probably have ascertained, from that same interpreter, that this  relative of the white chief is very poor, having scarcely any thing in  his wagon.    I sometimes felt annoyed at the low estimation in which some of my  hunting friends were held; for, believing that the chase is eminently  conducive to the formation of a brave and noble character, and that the  contest with wild beasts is well adapted for fostering that coolness  in emergencies, and active presence of mind, which we all admire, I  was naturally anxious that a higher estimate of my countrymen should be  formed in the native mind. \"Have these hunters, who come so far and  work so hard, no meat at home?\"--\"Why, these men are rich, and could  slaughter oxen every day of their lives.\"--\"And yet they come here, and  endure so much thirst for the sake of this dry meat, none of which is  equal to beef?\"--\"Yes, it is for the sake of play besides\" (the idea of  sport not being in the language). This produces a laugh, as much as to  say, \"Ah! you know better;\" or, \"Your friends are fools.\" When they can  get a man to kill large quantities of game for them, whatever HE may  think of himself or of his achievements, THEY pride themselves in having  adroitly turned to good account the folly of an itinerant butcher.    The water having at last flowed into the wells we had dug in sufficient  quantity to allow a good drink to all our cattle, we departed from  Serotli in the afternoon; but as the sun, even in winter, which it now  was, is always very powerful by day, the wagons were dragged but slowly  through the deep, heavy sand, and we advanced only six miles before  sunset. We could only travel in the mornings and evenings, as a single  day in the hot sun and heavy sand would have knocked up the oxen. Next  day we passed Pepacheu (white tufa), a hollow lined with tufa, in which  water sometimes stands, but it was now dry; and at night our trocheamer*  showed that we had made but twenty-five miles from Serotli.       * This is an instrument which, when fastened on the wagon-wheel,     records the number of revolutions made.  By multiplying this number     by the circumference of the wheel, the actual distance traveled over     is at once ascertained.    Ramotobi was angry at the slowness of our progress, and told us that,  as the next water was three days in front, if we traveled so slowly we  should never get there at all. The utmost endeavors of the servants,  cracking their whips, screaming and beating, got only nineteen miles out  of the poor beasts. We had thus proceeded forty-four miles from Serotli;  and the oxen were more exhausted by the soft nature of the country, and  the thirst, than if they had traveled double the distance over a hard  road containing supplies of water: we had, as far as we could judge,  still thirty miles more of the same dry work before us. At this season  the grass becomes so dry as to crumble to powder in the hands; so  the poor beasts stood wearily chewing, without taking a single fresh  mouthful, and lowing painfully at the smell of water in our vessels in  the wagons. We were all determined to succeed; so we endeavored to save  the horses by sending them forward with the guide, as a means of making  a desperate effort in case the oxen should fail. Murray went forward  with them, while Oswell and I remained to bring the wagons on their  trail as far as the cattle could drag them, intending then to send the  oxen forward too.    The horses walked quickly away from us; but, on the morning of the third  day, when we imagined the steeds must be near the water, we discovered  them just alongside the wagons. The guide, having come across the fresh  footprints of some Bushmen who had gone in an opposite direction to that  which we wished to go, turned aside to follow them. An antelope had been  ensnared in one of the Bushmen's pitfalls. Murray followed Ramotobi most  trustingly along the Bushmen's spoor, though that led them away from  the water we were in search of; witnessed the operation of slaughtering,  skinning, and cutting up the antelope; and then, after a hard day's  toil, found himself close upon the wagons! The knowledge still retained  by Ramotobi of the trackless waste of scrub, through which we were now  passing, seemed admirable. For sixty or seventy miles beyond Serotli,  one clump of bushes and trees seemed exactly like another; but, as we  walked together this morning, he remarked, \"When we come to that hollow  we shall light upon the highway of Sekomi; and beyond that again  lies the River Mokoko;\" which, though we passed along it, I could not  perceive to be a river-bed at all.    After breakfast, some of the men, who had gone forward on a little path  with some footprints of water-loving"]]]
