It is  possible, too, that guided by the second-sight of her affection, she saw  clearer into Augustin's heart than he did himself. She was plunged in  sorrow that he mistook himself to this extent, and refused the Grace which  desired to win him to the Catholic unity. And as he was not content with  losing himself, but also drew others into peril--disputing, speech-making  before his friends, abusing his power of language to throw trouble into  consciences--Monnica finally made up her mind. She forbade her son to eat  at her table, or to sleep under her roof. She drove him from the house.    This must have been a big scandal in Thagaste. It does not appear, however,  that Augustin cared much. In all the conceit of his false knowledge, he had  that kind of inhumanity which drives the intellectual to make litter of the  sweetest and deepest feelings as a sacrifice to his abstract idol. Not only  did he not mind very much if his apostasy made his mother weep, but he did  not trouble, either, to reconcile the chimeras of his brain with the living  reality of his soul and the things of life. Whatever he found inconvenient,  he tranquilly denied, content if he had talked well and entangled his  adversary in the net of his syllogisms.    Put in interdict by Monnica, he simply went and quartered himself on  Romanianus. The sumptuous hospitality he received there very soon consoled  him for his exile from his home. And if his self-esteem had been affronted,  the pride of living familiarly with so important a personage was, for a  vain young man, a very full compensation.    In fact, this Romanianus roused the admiration of the whole country by his  luxury and lavish expenditure. He was bound to ruin himself in the long  run, or, at any rate, to raise up envious people bent upon his ruin. Being  at the head of the Decurions, he was the protector, not only of Thagaste,  but of the neighbouring towns. He was the great patron, the influential  man, who had nearly the whole country for his dependents. The town council,  through gratitude and flattery, had had his name engraved upon tables of  brass, and had put up statues to him. It had even conferred powers on him  wider than municipal powers. The truth is that Romanianus did not dole  out his benefactions to his fellow-citizens. He gave them bear-fights and  other spectacles till then unknown at Thagaste. He did not grudge public  banquets, and every day a free meal was to be got at his house. The guests  were served plentifully. After having eaten his dinner, they dipped in  the purse of the host. Romanianus knew the art of doing an obliging thing  discreetly, and even how to anticipate requests which might be painful. So  he was proclaimed unanimously, \"the most humane, the most liberal, the most  polite and happiest of men.\"    Generous to his dependents, he did not forget himself. He built a villa  which, by the space it occupied, was a real palace, with _thermae_ walled  in precious marbles. He passed his time in the baths, or gaming, or  hunting--in short, he led the life of a great landed proprietor of those  days.    No doubt these villas had neither the beauty nor the art-value of the great  Italian villas, which were a kind of museums in a pretty, or grand, natural  frame; but they did not lack charm. Some of them, like that of Romanianus,  were built and decorated at lavish expense. Immensely large, they took  in sometimes an entire village; and sometimes, also, the villa, properly  speaking, the part of the building where the master dwelt, was fortified,  closed in by walls and towers like a feudal castle. Upon the outer gates  and the entrance door might be read in big letters: \"The Property of  So-and-so.\" Often, the inscription was repeated upon the walls of an  enclosure or of a farm, which really belonged to a dependent of the great  man. Under the shelter of the lord's name, these small-holders defended  themselves better against fiscal tyranny, or were included in the  immunities of their patrons. So was formed, under the cover of patronage,  a sort of African feudalism. Augustin's father, who owned vineyards, was  certainly a vassal of Romanianus.    As the African villa was a centre of agricultural activity, it maintained  on the estate a whole population of slaves, workmen, and small-holders.  The chief herdsman's house neighboured that of the forester. Through  deer-parks, enclosed by latticed fences, wandered gazelles. Oil factories,  vats and cellars for wine, ran on from the bath-buildings and the offices.  Then there was the main building with its immense doorway, its belvedere of  many stories, as in the Roman villas, its interior galleries, and wings to  the right and left of the _atrium_. In front lay the terraces, the gardens  with straight walks formed by closely-clipped hedges of box which led to  pools and jets of water, to arbours covered with ivy, to nymph-fountains  ornamented with columns and statues. In these gardens was a particular  place called the \"philosopher's corner.\" The mistress of the house used to  go there to read or dream. Her chair, or folding-seat, was placed under the  shade of a palm tree. Her \"philosopher\" followed her, holding her parasol  and leading her little favourite dog.    It is easy to realize that Augustin managed to stand his mother's severity  without overmuch distress in one of these fine country houses. To be  comfortable there, he had only to follow his natural inclination, which  was, he tells us, epicureanism. It is most certain that at this period  the only thing he cared about and sought after was pleasure. Staying  with Romanianus, he took his share in all the pleasant things of life,  _suavitates illius vitae_--shared the amusements of his host, and only  bothered about his pupils when he had nothing better to do. He must have  been as little of a grammarian as possible--he hadn't the time. With  the tyrannical friendship of rich people, who are hard put to it to  find occupation, Romanianus doubtless monopolized him from morning till  night. They hunted together, or dined, or read poetry, or discussed in  the evergreen alleys of the garden or \"the philosopher's corner.\" And  naturally, the recent convert to Manicheeism did his best to indoctrinate  and convert his patron--so far at least as a careless man like Romanianus  could be converted. Augustin accuses himself of having \"flung\" Romanianus  into his own errors. Augustin probably was not so guilty. His wealthy  friend does not seem to have had any very firm convictions. In all  likelihood, he was a pagan, a sceptical or hesitating pagan, such  as existed in numbers at that time. Led by Augustin, he drew near to  Manicheeism. Then, when Augustin gave up Manicheeism for Platonic  philosophy, we see Romanianus take the airs of a philosopher. Later, when  Augustin came back to Catholicism, he drew Romanianus in his wake towards  that religion. This man of fashion was one of those frivolous people who  never go deep into things, for whom ideas are only a pastime, and who  consider philosophers or men of letters as amusers. But it is certain  that he liked to listen to Augustin, and let himself be influenced. If he  trifled with Manicheeism, the reason was that Augustin dazzled him with his  arguments and fine phrases. This orator of twenty had already extraordinary  charm.    So Augustin led a delightful life with Romanianus. Everything pleased  him--his talking triumphs, the admiration of his hearers, the flattery  and luxury which surrounded him. Meanwhile, Monnica was plunged in grief  at his conduct, and implored God to draw him from his errors. She began  to be sorry that she had sent him away, and with the clear-sightedness of  the Christian, she perceived that Romanianus' house was not good for the  prodigal. It would be better to have him back. Near her he would run less  risk of being corrupted. Through intense praying, came to her a dream  which quickened her determination. \"She dreamed that she was weeping and  lamenting, with her feet planted on a wooden rule, when she saw coming  towards her a radiant youth who smiled upon her cheerfully. He asked the  reason of her sorrow and her daily tears ... and when she told him she was  bewailing my perdition, he bade her be of good comfort, look and see, for  where she was, there was I also. She looked, and saw me standing by her  side on the same rule.\"    Filled with joy by this promise from on high, Monnica asked her son to  come home. He did come back, but with the quibbles of the Sophist, the  rhetorician cavilled against his mother. He tried to upset her happiness.  He said to her:    \"Since, according to your dream, we are to be both standing on the same  rule, that means that you are going to be a Manichean.\"    \"No,\" answered Monnica. \"_He_ did not say, where he is you will be, but  where you are he will be.\"    Augustin confesses that this strong good sense made a certain impression  on him. Nevertheless he did not change. For still nine years he remained a  Manichee.    As a last resource, Monnica begged a bishop she knew, a man deeply read in  the Scriptures, to speak with her son and refute his errors. But so great  was the reputation of Augustin as an orator and dialectician that the holy  man dared not try a fall with such a vigorous jouster. He answered the  mother very wisely, that a mind so subtle and acute could not long continue  in such gross sophisms. And he offered his own example, for he, too, had  been a Manichee. But Monnica pressed him with entreaties and tears. At last  the bishop, annoyed by her persistence, but at the same time moved by her  tears, answered with a roughness mingled with kindness and compassion:    \"Go, go! Leave me alone. Live on as you are living. It cannot be that the  son of such tears should be lost.\"    _Filius istarum lacrymarum_: the son of such tears!...

So superest ager, § 26.    _Vel_. Pro _sive_, Ciceroni inauditum. Gün. Cf. note, 17.    _Frameas_. The word is still found in Spain, as well as Germany.  _Lancea_. is also a Spanish word, cf. Freund.    _Nudi_. Cf. § 17, 20, and 24. Also Caes., B.G. 6, 21: magna corporis  parte nuda.    _Sagulo_. Dim. of sago. A small short cloak.--_Leves_==Leviter induti.

Cultus complectitur omnia, quae studio et  arte eis, quae natura instituit, adduntur. K.    _Cassis aut galea_. _Cassis_, properly of metal; _galea_ of leather (Gr.:  galen); though the distinction is not always observed.    _Equi--conspicui_. Cf. Caes. B.G. 4, 2, 7, 65.    _Sed nec variare_. _But_ (i.e. on the other hand) _they are not even_  (for _nec_ in this sense see Ritter in loc.) _taught to vary their  curves_ (i.e. as the antithesis shows, to bend now towards the right and  now towards the left in their gyrations), _but they drive them straight  forward or by a constant bend towards the right in so connected a circle_  (i.e. a complete ring), _that no one is behind_ (for the obvious reason,  that there is neither beginning nor end to such a ring). Such is on the  whole the most satisfactory explanation of this difficult passage, which  we can give after a careful examination. A different version was given in  the first edition. It refers not to battle, but to equestrian exercises,  cf. Gerlach, as cited by Or. in loc.    _Aestimanti_. Greek idiom. Elliptical dative, nearly equivalent to the  abl. abs. (nobis aestimantibus), and called by some the dat. abs. In A.  II. the ellipsis is supplied by _credibile est_. Cf. Bötticher's Lex.  Tac. sub _Dativus_.    _Eoque mixti. Eo_, causal particle==for that reason. Caesar adopted this  arrangement in the battle of Pharsalia. B.C. 3, 84. The Greeks also had  [Greek: pezoi amippoi]. Xen. Hellen. 7, 5.    _Centeni_. A hundred is a favorite number with the Germans and their  descendants. Witness the hundred _pagi_ of the Suevi (Caes. B.G. 4, 1),  and of the Semnones (G. 39), the _cantons_ of Switzerland, and the  _hundreds_ of our Saxon ancestors in England. The _centeni_ here are a  military division. In like manner, Caesar (B.G. 4, 1) speaks of a  _thousand_ men drafted annually from each _pagus_ of the Suevi, for  military service abroad.    _Idque ipsum_. Predicate nominative after a verb of calling, H. 362,  2. 2; Z. 394. The division was called a _hundred_, and each man in it a  _hundreder_; and such was the estimation in which this service was held,  that to be a hundreder, became an honorable distinction, _nomen et  honor_==honorificum nomen.    _Cuneos_. A body of men arranged in the form of a wedge, i.e. narrow in  front and widening towards the rear; hence peculiarly adapted to break  the lines of the enemy.    _Consilii quam formidinis_. Supply _magis_. The conciseness of T.  leads him often to omit one of two correlative particles, cf. note on  _minime_, 4.    _Referunt. Carry into the rear_, and so secure them for burial.    _Etiam in dubiis proeliis_. Even while the battle remains undecided. Gün.    _Finierunt_. In a present or aorist sense, as often in T. So  _prohibuerunt_, § 10; _placuit_ and _displicuit_, 11. cf. Lex. Tac. Böt.      VII. _Reges_, civil rulers; _duces_, military commanders. _Ex_==  secundum. So _ex ingenio_, § 3. The government was elective, yet not  without some regard to hereditary distinctions. They _chose (sumunt)_  their sovereign, but chose him from the royal family, or at least one of  noble extraction. They chose also their commander--the king, if he was  the bravest and ablest warrior; if not, they were at liberty to choose  some one else. And among the Germans, as among their descendants, the  Franks, the authority of the commander was quite distinct from, and  sometimes (in war) paramount to, that of the king. Here Montesquieu and  others find the original of the kings of the first race in the French  monarchy, and the _mayors of the palace_, who once had so much power in  France. Cf. Sp. of Laws, B. 31, chap. 4.    _Nec_ is correlative to _et. The kings on the one hand do not possess  unlimited or unrestrained authority, and the commanders on the other, &c.  Infinita_==sine modo; _libera_==sine vinculo. Wr. _Potestas_==rightful  power, authority; _potentia_==power without regard to right, ability,  force, cf. note, 42. Ad rem, cf. Caes. B.G. 5, 27. Ambiorix tells Caesar,  that though he governed, yet the people made laws for him, and the  supreme power was shared equally between him and them.    _Exemplo--imperio_. \"_Dative_ after _sunt==are to set an example, rather  than to give command_.\" So Grüber and Död. But Wr. and Rit. with more  reason consider them as ablatives of means limiting a verb implied in  _duces: commanders_ (command) _more by example, than by authority_  (official power). See the principle well stated and illustrated in  Döderlein's Essay on the style of Tacitus, p. 15, in my edition of the  Histories.    _Admiratione praesunt. Gain influence, or ascendency, by means of the  admiration which they inspire_, cf. note on metus, § 2.    _Agant_. Subj., ut ad judicium admirantium, non mentem scriptoris  trahatur. Gün.    _Animadvertere_==interficere. Cf. H. 1, 46. 68. _None but the priests are  allowed to put to death, to place in irons, nor even_ (ne quidem) _to  scourge_. Thus punishment was clothed with divine authority.    _Effigies et signa. Images and standards_, i.e. images, which serve for  standards. Images of wild beasts are meant, cf. H. 4, 22: depromptae  silvis lucisve ferarum imagines.--_Turmam_, cavalry. _Cuneum_, infantry,  but sometimes both. _Conglobatio_ is found only in writers after the  Augustan age and rarely in them. It occurs in Sen. Qu. Nat. 1, 15, cf.  Freund.    _Familiae_ is less comprehensive than _propinquitates. Audiri_, sc.  solent. Cf. A. 34 _ruere_. Wr. calls it histor. inf., and Rit. pronounces  it a gloss.    _Pignora_. Whatever is most dear, particularly mothers, wives, and  children.--_Unde_, adv. of place, referring to _in proximo_.    _Vulnera ferunt_, i.e. on their return from battle.    _Exigere. Examine_, and compare, to see who has the most and the most  honorable, or perhaps to soothe and dress them.--_Cibos et hortamina_.  Observe the singular juxtaposition of things so unlike. So 1: _metu aut  montibus_; A. 25: _copiis et laetitia_; 37: _nox et satietas_; 38:  _gaudio praedaque_.      VIII. _Constantia precum==importunate entreaties_.    _Objectu pectorum. By opposing their breasts_, not to the enemy but to  their retreating husbands, praying for death in preference to captivity.    _Monstrata--captivitate_. _Cominus_ limits _captivitate_, pointing to  captivity as just before them.--_Impatientius_. _Impatienter_ and  _impatientia_ (the adv. and the subst.) are post-Augustan words. The adj.  (impatiens) is found earlier. Cf. Freund.    _Feminarum--nomine_, i.e. propter feminas suas. Gün. So Cic.: tuo nomine  et reipublicae==on your account and for the sake of the republic. But it  means perhaps more than that here, viz. in the person of. They dreaded  captivity more for their women than for themselves. _Adeo==insomuch  that_.    _Inesse_, sc. feminis. _They think, there is in their women something  sacred and prophetic_. Cf. Caes. B.G. 1, 50, where Caesar is informed by  the prisoners, that Ariovistus had declined an engagement because the  _women_ had declared against coming to action before the new moon.--  _Consilia, advice_ in general; _responsa, inspired answers_, when  consulted.    _Vidimus_, i.e. she lived in our day--under the reign of Vespasian.--  _Veledam_. Cf. H. 4, 61. 65.    _Auriniam_. Aurinia seems to have been a common name in Germany for  prophetess or wise woman. Perhaps==Al-runas, women knowing all things. So  _Veleda_==wise woman. Cf. Wr. in loc.    _Non adulatione_, etc. \"Not through adulation, nor as if they were  raising mortals to the rank of goddesses.\" Ky. This is one of those  oblique censures on Roman customs in which the treatise abounds. The  Romans in the excess of their adulation to the imperial family _made_  ordinary women goddesses, as Drusilla, sister of Caligula, the infant  daughter of Poppaea (Ann. 15, 23), and Poppaea herself (Dio 63, 29). The  Germans, on the other hand, really thought some of their wise women to be  divine. Cf. His. 4, 62, and my note ibid. Reverence and affection for  woman was characteristic of the German Tribes, and from them has diffused  itself throughout European society.      IX. _Deorum_. T. here, as elsewhere, applies Roman names, and puts a  Roman construction (Romana interpretatione, § 43), upon the gods of other  nations, cf. § 3.    _Mercurium_. So Caes. B.G. 6, 17: Deum maxime Mercurium colunt. Probably  the German _Woden_, whose name is preserved in our Wednesday, as that of  Mercury is in the French name of the same day, and who with a name  slightly modified (Woden, Wuotan, Odin), was a prominent object of  worship among all the nations of Northern Europe. _Mars_ is perhaps the  German god of war (Tiw, Tiu, Tuisco) whence Tuesday, French Mardi, cf.  Tur. His. Ang. Sax. App. to B. 2. chap. 3. _Herculem_ is omitted by  Ritter on evidence (partly external and partly internal) which is  entitled to not a little consideration. Hercules is the god of strength,  perhaps Thor.    _Certis diebus_. Statis diebus. Gün.    _Humanis--hostiis_. Even _facere_ in the sense of _sacrifice_ is  construed "]]]
