The top-sail-yards, gaff, and jib-boom, however, were left in their  places. The topsails and courses were kept bent to the yards, the sheets  being unrove and the clews tucked in. The rest of the binding-sails were  stowed on deck to prevent their thawing during winter; and the spare  spars were lashed over the ship's sides, to leave a clear space for  taking exercise in bad weather.    The stores, in order to relieve the strain on the ship, were removed to  Store Island, and snugly housed under the tent erected there, and then a  thick bank of snow was heaped up round it. After this was accomplished,  all the boats were hauled up beside the tent, and covered with snow,  except the two quarter-boats, which were left hanging at the davits all  winter. When the thermometer fell below zero, it was found that the  vapours below, and the breath of the men, condensed on the beams of the  lower deck and in the cabin near the hatchway. It was therefore resolved  to convert some sheet-iron, which they fortunately possessed, into  pipes, which, being conducted from the cooking-stove through the length  of the ship, served in some degree to raise the temperature and  ventilate the cabins. A regular daily allowance of coal was served out,  and four steady men appointed to attend to the fire in regular watches,  for the double purpose of seeing that none of the fuel should be wasted  and of guarding against fire. They had likewise charge of the fire-pumps  and buckets, and two tanks of water, all of which were kept in the  hatchway in constant readiness in case of accidents. In addition to  this, a fire-brigade was formed, with Joseph West, a steady, quiet,  active young seaman, as its captain, and their stations in the event of  fire were fixed beforehand; also, a hole was kept constantly open in the  ice alongside to insure at all times a sufficient supply of water.    Strict regulations as to cleanliness and the daily airing of the  hammocks were laid down, and adhered to throughout the winter. A regular  allowance of provisions was appointed to each man, so that they should  not run the risk of starving before the return of the wild-fowl in  spring. But those provisions were all salt, and the captain trusted much  to their hunting-expeditions for a supply of fresh food, without which  there would be little hope of their continuing in a condition of good  health. Coffee was served out at breakfast and cocoa at supper, besides  being occasionally supplied at other times to men who had been engaged  in exhausting work in extremely cold weather. Afterwards, when the dark  season set in, and the crew were confined by the intense cold more than  formerly within the ship, various schemes were set afoot for passing the  time profitably and agreeably. Among others, a school was started by the  captain for instructing such of the crew as chose to attend in reading,  writing, and arithmetic, and in this hyperborean academy Fred Ellice  acted as the writing master, and Tom Singleton as the accountant. The  men were much amused at first at the idea of \"goin' to school,\" and some  of them looked rather shy at it; but O'Riley, after some consideration,  came boldly forward and said, \"Well, boys, bad luck to me if I don't  think I'll be a scholard afther all. My old gran'mother used to tell me,  whin I refused to go to the school that was kip be an owld man as tuck  his fees out in murphies and potheen,--says she, 'Ah! ye spalpeen, ye'll  niver be cliverer nor the pig, ye won't.' 'Ah, then, I hope not,' says  I, 'for sure she's far the cliverest in the house, an' ye wouldn't have  me to be cliverer than me own gran'mother, would ye?' says I. So I niver  wint to school, and more be token, I can't sign me name, and if it was  only to larn how to do that, I'll go and jine; indeed I will.\" So  O'Riley joined, and before long every man in the ship was glad to join,  in order to have something to do.    The doctor also, twice a-week, gave readings from Shakespeare, a copy of  which he had fortunately brought with him. He also read extracts from  the few other books they happened to have on board; and after a time,  finding unexpectedly that he had a talent that way, he began to draw  upon his memory and his imagination, and told long stories (which were  facetiously called _lectures_) to the men, who listened to them with  great delight. Then Fred started an illustrated newspaper once a-week,  which was named the _Arctic Sun_, and which was in great favour during  the whole course of its brief existence. It is true, only one copy was  issued each morning of publication, because, besides supplying the  greater proportion of the material himself, and executing the  illustrations in a style that would have made Mr. Leech of the present  day envious, he had to transcribe the various contributions he received  from the men and others in a neat, legible hand. But this _one_ copy was  perused and re-perused, as no single copy of any paper extant--not  excepting _The Times_ or _Punch_--has ever yet been perused; and when it  was returned to the editor, to be carefully placed in the archives of  the _Dolphin_, it was emphatically the worse for wear. Besides all this,  a theatre was set agoing, of which we shall have more to say hereafter.    In thus minutely recounting the various expedients which these banished  men fell upon to pass the long dark hours of an Arctic winter, we may,  perhaps, give the reader the impression that a great deal of thought and  time were bestowed upon _amusement_, as if that were the chief end and  object of their life in those regions. But we must remind him that  though many more pages might be filled in recounting all the  particulars, but a small portion of their time was, after all, taken up  in this way; and it would have been well for them had they been able to  find more to amuse them than they did, for the depressing influence of  the long-continued darkness, and the want of a sufficiency of regular  employment for so many months added to the rigorous nature of the  climate in which they dwelt, well-nigh broke their spirits at last.    In order to secure warmth during winter, the deck of the ship was padded  with moss about a foot deep, and down below the walls were lined with  the same material. The floors were carefully plastered with common paste  and covered with oakum a couple of inches deep, over which a carpet of  canvas was spread. Every opening in the deck was fastened down and  covered deeply over with moss, with the exception of one hatch, which  was their only entrance, and this was kept constantly closed except when  it was desirable to ventilate. Curtains were hung up in front of it to  prevent draughts. A canvas awning was also spread over the deck from  stem to stern, so that it was confidently hoped the _Dolphin_ would  prove a snug tenement even in the severest cold.    As has been said before, the snow-drift almost buried the hull of the  ship, and as snow is a good _non-conductor_ of heat, this further helped  to keep up the temperature within. A staircase of snow was built up to  the bulwarks on the larboard quarter, and on the starboard side an  inclined plane of snow was sloped down to the ice to facilitate the  launching of the sledges when they had to be pulled on deck.    Such were the chief arrangements and preparations that were made by our  adventurers for spending the winter; but although we have described them  at this point in our story, many of them were not completed until a much  later period.        CHAPTER XI.    _A hunting-expedition, in the course of which the hunters meet with many  interesting, dangerous, peculiar, and remarkable experiences, and make  acquaintance with seals, walruses, deer, and rabbits_.      We must now return to Fred Ellice and his companions, Meetuck the  Esquimau, O'Riley, and Joseph West, whom we left while they were on the  point of starting on a hunting-expedition.    They took the direction of the ice-hummocks out to sea, and, seated  comfortably on a large sledge, were dragged by the team of dogs over the  ice at the rate of ten miles an hour.    \"Well! did I iver expect to ride a carriage and six?\" exclaimed O'Riley  in a state of great glee as the dogs dashed forward at full speed, while  Meetuck nourished his awful whip, making it crack like a pistol-shot  ever and anon.    The sledge on which they travelled was of the very curious and simple  construction peculiar to the Esquimaux, and was built by Peter Grim  under the direction of Meetuck. It consisted of two runners of about ten  feet in length, six inches high, two inches broad, and three feet apart.  They were made of tough hickory, slightly curved in front, and were  attached to each other by cross-bars. At the stern of the vehicle there  was a low back composed of two uprights and a single bar across. The  whole machine was fastened together by means of tough lashings of raw  seal-hide, so that, to all appearance, it was a rickety affair, ready to  fall to pieces. In reality, however, it was very strong. No metal nails  of any kind could have held in the keen frost--they would have snapped  like glass at the first jolt--but the sealskin fastenings yielded to the  rude shocks and twistings to which the sledge was subjected, and seldom  gave way, or if they did, were easily and speedily renewed without the  aid of any other implement than a knife.    But the whip was the most remarkable part of the equipage. The handle  was only sixteen inches in length, but the lash was twenty _feet_ long,  made of the toughest seal-skin, and as thick as a man's wrist near the  handle, whence it tapered off to a fine point. The labour of using such  a formidable weapon is so great that Esquimaux usually, when  practicable, travel in couples, one sledge behind the other. The dogs of  the last sledge follow mechanically and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11615"],[0,"The Grammar of English Grammars (#19)"],[1,"opinions which the  compiler thought proper to support by regular quotations; and, now and  then, in other instances, the name of an author appears. The two positions  thus distinguished, are these: _First_, That the noun _means_ is  necessarily singular as well as plural, so that one cannot with propriety  use the singular form, _mean_, to signify that by which an end is attained;  _Second_, That the subjective mood, to which he himself had previously  given all the tenses without inflection, is not different in form from the  indicative, except in the present tense. With regard to the later point, I  have shown, in its proper place, that he taught erroneously, both before  and after he changed his opinion; and concerning the former, the most that  can be proved by quotation, is, that both _mean_ and _means_ for the  singular number, long have been, and still are, in good use, or sanctioned  by many elegant writers; so that either form may yet be considered  grammatical, though the irregular can claim to be so, only when it is used  in this particular sense. As to his second reason for the suppression of  names, to wit, \"the _uncertainty to whom_ the passages originally  belonged,\"--to make the most of it, it is but partial and relative; and,  surely, no other grammar ever before so multiplied the difficulty in the  eyes of teachers, and so widened the field for commonplace authorship, as  has the compilation in question. The origin of a sentiment or passage may  be uncertain to one man, and perfectly well known to an other. The  embarrassment which a _compiler_ may happen to find from this source, is  worthy of little sympathy. For he cannot but know from what work he is  taking any particular sentence or paragraph, and those parts of a  _grammar_, which are new to the eye of a great grammarian, may very well be  credited to him who claims to have written the book. I have thus disposed  of his second reason for the omission of names and references, in  compilations of grammar.    12. There remains one more: \"A work of this nature _would derive no  advantage from it_, equal to the inconvenience of crowding the pages with a  repetition of names and references.\" With regard to a small work, in which  the matter is to be very closely condensed, this argument has considerable  force. But Murray has in general allowed himself very ample room,  especially in his two octavoes. In these, and for the most part also in his  duodecimoes, all needful references might easily have been added without  increasing the size of his volumes, or injuring their appearance. In nine  cases out of ten, the names would only have been occupied what is now blank  space. It is to be remembered, that these books do not differ much, except  in quantity of paper. His octavo Grammar is but little more than a reprint,  in a larger type, of the duodecimo Grammar, together with his Exercises and  Key. The demand for this expensive publication has been comparatively  small; and it is chiefly to the others, that the author owes his popularity  as a grammarian. As to the advantage which Murray or his work might have  derived from an adherence on his part to the usual custom of compilers,  _that_ may be variously estimated. The remarks of the best grammarians or  the sentiments of the best authors, are hardly to be thought the more  worthy of acceptance, for being concentrated in such a manner as to merge  their authenticity in the fame of the copyist. Let me not be understood to  suggest that this good man sought popularity at the expense of others; for  I do not believe that either fame or interest was his motive. But the right  of authors to the credit of their writings, is a delicate point; and,  surely, his example would have been worthier of imitation, had he left no  ground for the foregoing objections, and carefully barred the way to any  such interference.    13. But let the first sentence of this apology be now  considered. It is here suggested, that because this work is a compilation,  even such an acknowledgement as the author makes, is \"scarcely necessary.\"  This is too much to say. Yet one may readily admit, that a compilation,  \"from the nature and design of it, must consist chiefly\"--nay,  _wholly_--\"of materials selected from the writings of others.\" But what  able grammarian would ever willingly throw himself upon the horns of such a  dilemma! The nature and design _of a book_, whatever they may be, are  matters for which the author alone is answerable; but the nature and design  _of grammar_, are no less repugnant to the strain of this apology, than to  the vast number of errors and defects which were overlooked by Murray in  his work of compilation. It is the express purpose of this practical  science, to enable a man to write well himself. He that cannot do this,  exhibits no excess of modesty when he claims to have \"done all that could  reasonably be expected in a work of this nature.\"--_L. Murray's Gram.,  Introd._, p. 9. He that sees with other men's eyes, is peculiarly liable to  errors and inconsistencies: uniformity is seldom found in patchwork, or  accuracy in secondhand literature. Correctness of language is in the mind,  rather than in the hand or the tongue; and, in order to secure it, some  originality of thought is necessary. A delineation from new surveys is not  the less original because the same region has been sketched before; and how  can he be the ablest of surveyors, who, through lack of skill or industry,  does little more than transcribe the field-notes and copy the projections  of his predecessors?    14. This author's oversights are numerous. There is no part of the volume  more accurate than that which he literally copied from Lowth. To the Short  Introduction alone, he was indebted for more than a hundred and twenty  paragraphs; and even in these there are many things obviously erroneous.  Many of the best practical notes were taken from Priestley; yet it was he,  at whose doctrines were pointed most of those \"positions and discussions,\"  which alone the author claims as original. To some of these reasonings,  however, his own alterations may have given rise; for, where he \"persuades  himself he is not destitute of originality,\" he is often arguing against  the text of his own earlier editions. Webster's well-known complaints of  Murray's unfairness, had a far better cause than requital; for there was no  generosity in ascribing them to peevishness, though the passages in  question were not worth copying. On perspicuity and accuracy, about sixty  pages were extracted from Blair; and it requires no great critical acumen  to discover, that they are miserably deficient in both. On the law of  language, there are fifteen pages from Campbell; which, with a few  exceptions, are well written. The rules for spelling are the same as  Walker's: the third one, however, is a gross blunder; and the fourth, a,  needless repetition.    15. Were this a place for minute criticism, blemishes almost innumerable  might be pointed out. It might easily be shown that almost every rule laid  down in the book for the observance of the learner, was repeatedly violated  by the hand of the master. Nor is there among all those who have since  abridged or modified the work, an abler grammarian than he who compiled it.  Who will pretend that Flint, Alden, Comly, Jaudon, Russell, Bacon, Lyon,  Miller, Alger, Maltby, Ingersoll, Fisk, Greenleaf, Merchant, Kirkham,  Cooper, R. G. Greene, Woodworth, Smith, or Frost, has exhibited greater  skill? It is curious to observe, how frequently a grammatical blunder  committed by Murray, or some one of his predecessors, has escaped the  notice of all these, as well as of many others who have found it easier to  copy him than to write for themselves. No man professing to have copied and  improved Murray, can rationally be supposed to have greatly excelled him;  for to pretend to have produced an _improved copy of a compilation_, is to  claim a sort of authorship, even inferior to his, and utterly unworthy of  any man who is able to prescribe and elucidate the principles of English  grammar.    16. But Murray's grammatical works, being extolled in the reviews, and made  common stock in trade,--being published, both in England and in America, by  booksellers of the most extensive correspondence, and highly commended even  by those who were most interested in the sale of them,--have been eminently  successful with the public; and in the opinion of the world, success is the  strongest proof of merit. Nor has the force of this argument been  overlooked by those who have written in aid of his popularity. It is the  strong point in most of the commendations which have been bestowed upon  Murray as a grammarian. A recent eulogist computes, that, \"at least five  millions of copies of his various school-books have been printed;\"  particularly commends him for his \"candour and liberality towards rival  authors;\" avers that, \"he went on, examining and correcting his Grammar,  through all its forty editions, till he brought it to a degree of  perfection which will render it as permanent as the English language  itself;\" censures (and not without reason) the \"presumption\" of those  \"superficial critics\" who have attempted to amend the work, and usurp his  honours; and, regarding the compiler's confession of his indebtedness to  others, but as a mark of \"his exemplary diffidence of his own merits,\"  adds, (in very bad English,) \"Perhaps there never was an author whose  success and fame were more _unexpected by himself than Lindley  Murray_.\"--_The Friend_, Vol. iii, p. 33.    17. In a New-York edition of Murray's Grammar, printed in 1812, there was  inserted a \"Caution to the Public,\" by Collins & Co., his American  correspondents and publishers, in which are set forth the unparalleled  success and merit of the work, \"as it came _in purity_ from the pen of the  author;\" with an earnest remonstrance against"]]]
