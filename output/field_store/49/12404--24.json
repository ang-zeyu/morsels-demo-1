Her uncle gave way, and on the 13th of May, 1428, he  did take her to Vaucouleurs.  \"I come on behalf of my Lord,\" said she to  Sire de Baudricourt, \"to bid you send word to the _dauphin_ to keep  himself well in hand, and not give battle to his foes, for my Lord will  presently give him succor.\"  \"Who is thy lord?\"  asked Baudricourt.  \"The  King of Heaven,\" answered Joan.  Baudricourt set her down for mad, and  urged her uncle to take her back to her parents \"with a good slap o' the  face.\"    In July, 1428, a fresh invasion of Burgundians occurred at Domremy, and  redoubled the popular excitement there.  Shortly afterwards, the report  touching the siege of Orleans arrived there.  Joan, more and more  passionately possessed with her idea, returned to Vaucouleurs.  \"I must  go,\" said she to Sire de Baudricourt, \"for to raise the siege of Orleans.  I will go, should I have to wear off my legs to the knee.\"  She had  returned to Vaucouleurs without taking leave of her parents.  \"Had I  possessed,\" said she, in 1431, to her judges at Rouen, \"a hundred fathers  and a hundred mothers, and had I been a king's daughter, I should have  gone.\"  Baudricourt, impressed without being convinced, did not oppose  her remaining at Vaucouleurs, and sent an account of this singular young  girl to Duke Charles of Lorraine, at Nancy, and perhaps even, according  to some chronicles, to the king's court.  Joan lodged at Vaucouleurs in a  wheelwright's house, and passed three weeks there, spinning with her  hostess, and dividing her time between work and church.  There was much  talk in Vaucouleurs of her, and her visions, and her purpose.  John of  Metz [also called John of Novelompont], a knight serving with Sire de  Baudricourt, desired to see her, and went to the wheelwright's.  \"What do  you here, my dear?\"  said he; \"must the king be driven from his kingdom,  and we become English?\"  \"I am come hither,\" answered Joan, \"to speak to  Robert de Baudricourt, that he may be pleased to take me or have me taken  to the king; but he pays no heed to me or my words.  However, I must be  with the king before the middle of Lent, for none in the world, nor  kings, nor dukes, nor daughter of the Scottish king can recover the  kingdom of France; there is no help but in me.  Assuredly I would far  rather be spinning beside my poor mother, for this other is not my  condition; but I must go and do the work because my Lord wills that I  should do it.\"  \"Who is your lord?\"  \"The Lord God.\"  \"By my faith,\"  said the knight, seizing Joan's hands, \"I will take you to the king, God  helping.  When will you set out?\"  \"Rather now than to-morrow; rather  to-morrow than later.\"  Vaucouleurs was full of the fame and the sayings  of Joan.  Another knight, Bertrand de Poulengy, offered, as John of Metz  had, to be her escort, Duke Charles of Lorraine wished to see her, and  sent for her to Nancy.  Old and ill as he was, he had deserted the  duchess his wife, a virtuous lady, and was leading anything but a regular  life.  He asked Joan's advice about his health.  \"I have no power to cure  you,\" said Joan, \"but go back to your wife and help me in that for which  God ordains me.\"  The duke ordered her four golden crowns, and she  returned to Vaucouleurs, thinking of nothing but her departure.  There  was no want of confidence and good will on the part of the inhabitants of  Vaucouleurs in forwarding her preparations.  John of Metz, the knight  charged to accompany her, asked her if she intended to make the journey  in her poor red rustic petticoats.  \"I would like to don man's clothes,\"  answered Joan.  Subscriptions were made to give her a suitable costume.  She was supplied with a horse, a coat of mail, a lance, a sword, the  complete equipment, indeed, of a man-at-arms; and a king's messenger and  an archer formed her train.  Baudricourt made them swear to escort her  safely, and on the 25th of February, 1429, he bade her farewell, and all  he said was, \"Away then, Joan, and come what may.\"    Charles VII. was at that time residing at Chinon, in Touraine.  In order  to get there Joan had nearly a hundred and fifty leagues to go, in a  country occupied here and there by English and Burgundians, and  everywhere a theatre of war.  She took eleven days to do this journey,  often marching by night, never giving up man's dress, disquieted by no  difficulty and no danger, and testifying no desire for a halt save to  worship God.  \"Could we hear mass daily,\" said she to her comrades, \"we  should do well.\"  They only consented twice, first in the abbey of St.  Urban, and again in the principal church of Auxerre.  As they were full  of respect, though at the same time also of doubt, towards Joan, she  never had to defend herself against their familiarities, but she had  constantly to dissipate their disquietude touching the reality or the  character of her mission.  \"Fear nothing,\" she said to them; \"God shows  me the way I should go; for thereto was I born.\"  On arriving at the  village of St. Catherine-de-Fierbois, near Chinon, she heard three masses  on the same day, and had a letter written thence to the king, to announce  her coming and to ask to see him; she had gone, she said, a hundred and  fifty leagues to come and tell him things which would be most useful to  him.  Charles VII. and his councillors hesitated.  The men of war did not  like to believe that a little peasant-girl of Lorraine was coming to  bring the king a more effectual support than their own.  Nevertheless  some, and the most heroic amongst them,--Dunois, La Hire, and  Xaintrailles,--were moved by what was told of this young girl.  The  letters of Sire de Baudricourt, though full of doubt, suffered a gleam of  something like a serious impression to peep out; and why should not the  king receive this young girl whom the captain of Vaucouleurs had thought  it a duty to send?  It would soon be seen what she was and what she would  do.  The politicians and courtiers, especially the most trusted of them,  George de la Tremoille, the king's favorite, shrugged their shoulders.  What could be expected from the dreams of a young peasant-girl of  nineteen?  Influences of a more private character and more disposed  towards sympathy--Yolande of Arragon, for instance, Queen of Sicily and  mother-in-law of Charles VII., and perhaps, also, her daughter, the young  queen, Mary of Anjou, were urgent for the king to reply to Joan that she  might go to Chinon.  She was authorized to do so, and, on the 6th of  March, 1429, she with her comrades arrived at the royal residence.    At the very first moment two incidents occurred to still further increase  the curiosity of which she was the object.  Quite close to Chinon some  vagabonds, it is said, had prepared an ambuscade for the purpose of  despoiling her, her and her train.  She passed close by them without the  least obstacle.  The rumor went that at her approach they were struck  motionless, and had been unable to attempt their wicked purpose.  Joan  was rather tall, well shaped, dark, with a look of composure, animation,  and gentleness.  A man-at-arms, who met her on her way, thought her  pretty, and with an impious oath expressed a coarse sentiment.  \"Alas!\"  said Joan, \"thou blasphemest thy God, and yet thou art so near thy  death!\"  He drowned himself, it is said, soon after.  Already popular  feeling was surrounding her marvellous mission with a halo of  instantaneous miracles.    [Illustration: CHINON CASTLE----95]    On her arrival at Chinon she at first lodged with an honest family near  the castle.  For three days longer there was a deliberation in the  council as to whether the king ought to receive her.  But there was bad  news from Orleans.  There were no more troops to send thither, and there  was no money forthcoming: the king's treasurer, it was said, had but four  crowns in the chest.  If Orleans were taken, the king would perhaps be  reduced to seeking a refuge in Spain or in Scotland.  Joan promised to  set Orleans free.  The Orleannese themselves were clamorous for her;  Dunois kept up their spirits with the expectation of this marvellous  assistance.  It was decided that the king should receive her.  She had  assigned to her for residence an apartment in the tower of the Coudray, a  block of quarters adjoining the royal mansion, and she was committed to  the charge of William Bellier, an officer of the king's household, whose  wife was a woman of great piety and excellent fame.  On the 9th of March,  1429, Joan was at last introduced into the king's presence by the Count  of Vendome, high steward, in the great hall on the first story, a portion  of the wall and the fireplace being still visible in the present day.  It  was evening, candle-light; and nearly three hundred knights were present.  Charles kept himself a little aloof, amidst a group of warriors and  courtiers more richly dressed than he.  According to some chroniclers,  Joan had demanded that \"she should not be deceived, and should have  pointed out to her him to whom she was to speak;\" others affirm that she  went straight to the king, whom she had never seen, \"accosting him humbly  and simply, like a poor little shepherdess,\" says an eye-witness, and,  according to another account, \"making the usual bends and reverences as  if she had been brought up at court.\"  Whatever may have been her outward  behavior, \"Gentle _dauphin_,\" she said to the king (for she did not think  it right to call him king so long as he was not crowned), \"my name is Joan  the maid; the King of Heaven sendeth you word by me that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11954"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 4 (#19)"],[1,"entering Pavia, that he might not be  a gazing-stock in a town that he had so nearly taken.  He was,  accordingly, conducted to Pizzighittone, a little fortress between Milan  and Cremona.  He wrote thence two letters, one to his mother the regent  and the other to Charles V., which are here given word for word, because  they so well depict his character and the state of his mind in his hour  of calamity:--         1.  \"To the Regent of France: Madame, that you may know how stands       the rest of my misfortune: there is nothing in the world left to me       but honor and my life, which is safe.  And in order that, in your       adversity, this news might bring you some little comfort, I prayed       for permission to write you this letter, which was readily granted       me; entreating you, in the exercise of your accustomed prudence, to       be pleased not to do anything rash, for I have hope, after all, that       God will not forsake me.  Commending to you my children your       grandchildren, and entreating you to give the bearer a free passage,       going and returning, to Spain, for he is going to the emperor to       learn how it is his pleasure that I should be treated.\"         2.  \"To the Emperor Charles V.: If liberty had been sooner granted       me by my cousin the viceroy, I should not have delayed so long to do       my duty towards you, according as the time and the circumstances in       which I am placed require; having no other comfort under my       misfortune than a reliance on your goodness, which, if it so please,       shall employ the results of victory with honorableness towards me;       having steadfast hope that your virtue would not willingly constrain       me to anything that was not honorable; entreating you to consult       your own heart as to what you shall be pleased to do with me;       feeling sure that the will of a prince such as you are cannot be       coupled with aught but honor and magnanimity.  Wherefore, if it       please you to have so much honorable pity as to answer for the       safety which a captive King of France deserves to find, whom there       is a desire to render friendly and not desperate, you may be sure of       obtaining an acquisition instead of a useless prisoner, and of       making a King of France your slave forever.\"    The former of these two letters has had its native hue somewhat altered  in the majority of histories, in which it has been compressed into those  eloquent words, \"All is lost save honor.\"  The second needs no comment to  make apparent what it lacks of kingly pride and personal dignity.  Beneath the warrior's heroism there was in the qualities of Francis I.  more of what is outwardly brilliant and winning than of real strength and  solidity.    But the warrior's heroism, in conjunction with what is outwardly  brilliant and winning in the man, exercises a great influence over  people.  The Viceroy of Naples perceived and grew anxious at the  popularity of which Francis I. was the object at Pizzighittone.  The  lanzknechts took an open interest in him and his fortunes; the Italians  fixed their eyes on him; and Bourbon, being reconciled to him, might  meditate carrying him off.  Lannoy resolved to send him to Naples, where  there would be more certainty of guarding him securely.  Francis made no  objection to this design.  On the 12th of May, 1525, he wrote to his  mother, \"Madame, the bearer has assured me that he will bring you this  letter safely; and, as I have but little time, I will tell you nothing  more than I shall be off to Naples on Monday--, and so keep a lookout at  sea, for we shall have only fourteen galleys to take us and eighteen  hundred Spaniards to man them; but those will be all their arquebusiers.  Above all, haste: for, if that is made, I am in hopes that you may soon  see your most humble and most obedient son.\"  There was no opportunity  for even attempting to carry off the king as he went by sea to Naples;  instead of taking him to Naples, Lannoy transported him straight to  Spain, with the full assent of the king and the regent themselves, for it  was in French galleys manned by Spanish troops that the voyage was made.  Instead of awaiting the result of such doubtful chances of deliverance as  might occur in Italy, Francis I., his mother, and his sister Margaret,  entertained the idea that what was of the utmost importance for him was  to confer and treat in person with Charles V., which could not be done  save in Spain itself.  In vain did Bourbon and Pescara, whose whole  influence and ambitious hopes lay in Italy, and who, on that stage,  regarded Francis I. as their own prisoner rather than Charles V.'s, exert  themselves to combat this proposal; the Viceroy of Naples, in concert, no  doubt, with Charles V.  himself as well as with Francis I. and his  mother, took no heed of their opposition; and Francis I., disembarking at  the end of June at Barcelona first and then at Valentia, sent, on the 2d  of July, to Charles V. the Duke de Montmorency, with orders to say that  he had desired to approach the emperor, \"not only to obtain peace and  deliverance in his own person, but also to establish and confirm Italy in  the state and fact of devotion to the emperor, before that the potentates  and lords of Italy should have leisure to rally together in opposition.\"  The regent, his mother, and his sister Margaret congratulated him  heartily on his arrival in Spain, and Charles V.  himself wrote to him,  \"It was a pleasure to me to hear of your arrival over here, because that,  just now, it will be the cause of a happy general peace for the great  good of Christendom, which is what I most desire.\"    It is difficult to understand how Francis I. and Charles V. could rely  upon personal interviews and negotiations for putting an end to their  contentions and establishing a general peace.  Each knew the other's  pretensions, and they knew how little disposed they were, either of them,  to abandon them.  On the 28th of March, 1525, a month after the battle of  Pavia, Charles V. had given his ambassadors instructions as to treating  for the ransom and liberation of the King of France.  His chief  requirements were, that Francis I. should renounce all attempts at  conquest in Italy, that he should give up the suzerainty of the  countships of Flanders and Artois, that he should surrender to Charles V.  the duchy of Burgundy with all its dependencies, as derived from Mary of  Burgundy, daughter of the last duke, Charles the Rash; that the Duke of  Bourbon should be reinstated in possession of all his domains, with the  addition thereto of Provence and Dauphiny, which should form an  independent state; and, lastly, that France should pay England all the  sums of money which Austria owed her.  Francis I., on hearing, at  Pizzighittone, these proposals read out, suddenly drew his sword as if to  stab himself, saying, \"It were better for a king to end thus.\"  His  custodian, Alancon, seized his arm, whilst recalling him to his senses.  Francis recovered calmness, but without changing his resolution; he would  rather, he said, bury himself in a prison forever than subscribe to  conditions destructive of his kingdom, and such as the States General of  France would never accept.  When Francis I. was removed to Spain he had  made only secondary concessions as to these requirements of Charles V.,  and Charles V. had not abandoned any one of his original requirements.  Marshal de Montmorency, when sent by the king to the emperor on the 2d of  July, 1525, did not enter at all into the actual kernel of the  negotiation; after some conventional protestations of a pacific kind, he  confined himself to demanding \"a safe conduct for Madame Marguerite of  France, the king's only sister, Duchess of Alencon and Berry, who would  bring with her such and so full powers of treating for peace, the  liberation of the king, and friendly alliance to secure the said peace,  that the emperor would clearly see that the king's intentions were pure  and genuine, and that he would be glad to conclude and decide in a month  what might otherwise drag on for a long while to the great detriment of  their subjects.\"  The marshal was at the same time to propose the  conclusion of a truce during the course of the negotiations.    Amongst the letters at that time addressed to Francis I., a prisoner of  war, is the following, dated March, 1525, when he was still in Italy:--         \"My lord, the joy we are still feeling at the kind letters which you       were pleased to write yesterday to me and to your mother, makes us       so happy with the assurance of your health, on which our life       depends, that it seems to me that we ought to think of nothing but       of praising God and desiring a continuance of your good news, which       is the best meat we can have to live on.  And inasmuch as the       Creator bath given us grace that our trinity should be always       united, the other two do entreat you that this letter, presented to       you, who are the third, may be accepted with the same affection with       which it is cordially offered you by your most humble and most       obedient servants, your mother and sister--       LOUISE, MARGUERITE.\"    This close and tender union of the three continued through all  separations and all trials; the confidence of the captive king was  responsive to the devotion of his mother the regent and of his sister who  had become his negotiatrix.  When the news came of the king's captivity,  the regency threatened for a moment to become difficult and stormy; all  the ambition and the hatred that lay dormant in the court awoke; an  attempt was made to excite in the Duke of Vendome, the head of the  younger branch of the House of Bourbon, a desire to take the regent's  place; the Parliament of Paris attacked the chancellor, Duprat, whom they  hated--not without a cause; but the Duke of Vendome was proof"]]]
