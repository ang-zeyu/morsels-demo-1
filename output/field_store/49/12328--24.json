Then the prisoner prayed a copy of the indictment.    _L.C.J._ (Sir George Jeffreys). What is this? Sure you know that is never  allowed. Besides, here is a plain indictment as ever I heard; you have  nothing to do but to plead to it.    _Pris._ My lord, I apprehend there may be matter of law arising out of  the indictment, and I would humbly beg the court to assign me counsel to  consider of it. Besides, my lord, I believe it was done in another case:  copy of the indictment was allowed.    _L.C.J._ What case was that?    _Pris._ Truly, my lord, I have been kept close prisoner ever since I came  up from Exeter Castle, and no one allowed to come at me and no one to  advise with.    _L.C.J._ But I say, what was that case you allege?    _Pris._ My lord, I cannot tell your lordship precisely the name of the  case, but it is in my mind that there was such an one, and I would humbly  desire--    _L.C.J._ All this is nothing. Name your case, and we will tell you  whether there be any matter for you in it. God forbid but you should have  anything that may be allowed you by law: but this is against law, and we  must keep the course of the court.    _Att.-Gen._ (Sir Robert Sawyer). My lord, we pray for the King that he  may be asked to plead.    _Cl. of Ct._ Are you guilty of the murder whereof you stand indicted, or  not guilty?    _Pris._ My lord, I would humbly offer this to the court. If I plead now,  shall I have an opportunity after to except against the indictment?    _L.C.J._ Yes, yes, that comes after verdict: that will be saved to you,  and counsel assigned if there be matter of law: but that which you have  now to do is to plead.    Then after some little parleying with the court (which seemed strange  upon such a plain indictment) the prisoner pleaded _Not Guilty_.    _Cl. of Ct._ Culprit.  How wilt thou be tried?    _Pris._ By God and my country.    _Cl. of Ct._ God send thee a good deliverance.    _L.C.J._ Why, how is this? Here has been a great to-do that you should  not be tried at Exeter by your country, but be brought here to London,  and now you ask to be tried by your country. Must we send you to Exeter  again?    _Pris._ My lord, I understood it was the form.    _L.C.J._ So it is, man: we spoke only in the way of pleasantness. Well,  go on and swear the jury.    So they were sworn. I omit the names. There was no challenging on the  prisoner's part, for, as he said, he did not know any of the persons  called. Thereupon the prisoner asked for the use of pen, ink, and paper,  to which the L. C. J. replied: 'Ay, ay, in God's name let him have it.'  Then the usual charge was delivered to the jury, and the case opened by  the junior counsel for the King, Mr Dolben.    The Attorney-General followed:    May it please your lordship, and you gentlemen of the jury, I am of  counsel for the King against the prisoner at the bar. You have heard that  he stands indicted for a murder done upon the person of a young girl.  Such crimes as this you may perhaps reckon to be not uncommon, and,  indeed, in these times, I am sorry to say it, there is scarce any fact so  barbarous and unnatural but what we may hear almost daily instances of  it. But I must confess that in this murder that is charged upon the  prisoner there are some particular features that mark it out to be such  as I hope has but seldom if ever been perpetrated upon English ground.  For as we shall make it appear, the person murdered was a poor country  girl (whereas the prisoner is a gentleman of a proper estate) and,  besides that, was one to whom Providence had not given the full use of  her intellects, but was what is termed among us commonly an innocent or  natural: such an one, therefore, as one would have supposed a gentleman  of the prisoner's quality more likely to overlook, or, if he did notice  her, to be moved to compassion for her unhappy condition, than to lift up  his hand against her in the very horrid and barbarous manner which we  shall show you he used.    Now to begin at the beginning and open the matter to you orderly: About  Christmas of last year, that is the year 1683, this gentleman, Mr Martin,  having newly come back into his own country from the University of  Cambridge, some of his neighbours, to show him what civility they could  (for his family is one that stands in very good repute all over that  country), entertained him here and there at their Christmas merrymakings,  so that he was constantly riding to and fro, from one house to another,  and sometimes, when the place of his destination was distant, or for  other reason, as the unsafeness of the roads, he would be constrained to  lie the night at an inn. In this way it happened that he came, a day or  two after the Christmas, to the place where this young girl lived with  her parents, and put up at the inn there, called the New Inn, which is,  as I am informed, a house of good repute. Here was some dancing going on  among the people of the place, and Ann Clark had been brought in, it  seems, by her elder sister to look on; but being, as I have said, of weak  understanding, and, besides that, very uncomely in her appearance, it was  not likely she should take much part in the merriment; and accordingly  was but standing by in a corner of the room. The prisoner at the bar,  seeing her, one must suppose by way of a jest, asked her would she dance  with him. And in spite of what her sister and others could say to prevent  it and to dissuade her--    _L.C.J._ Come, Mr Attorney, we are not set here to listen to tales of  Christmas parties in taverns. I would not interrupt you, but sure you  have more weighty matters than this. You will be telling us next what  tune they danced to.    _Att._ My lord, I would not take up the time of the court with what is  not material: but we reckon it to be material to show how this unlikely  acquaintance begun: and as for the tune, I believe, indeed, our evidence  will show that even that hath a bearing on the matter in hand.    _L.C.J._ Go on, go on, in God's name: but give us nothing that is  impertinent.    _Att._ Indeed, my lord, I will keep to my matter. But, gentlemen, having  now shown you, as I think, enough of this first meeting between the  murdered person and the prisoner, I will shorten my tale so far as to say  that from then on there were frequent meetings of the two: for the young  woman was greatly tickled with having got hold (as she conceived it) of  so likely a sweetheart, and he being once a week at least in the habit of  passing through the street where she lived, she would be always on the  watch for him; and it seems they had a signal arranged: he should whistle  the tune that was played at the tavern: it is a tune, as I am informed,  well known in that country, and has a burden, '_Madam, will you walk,  will you talk with me?_'    _L.C.J._ Ay, I remember it in my own country, in Shropshire. It runs  somehow thus, doth it not? [Here his lordship whistled a part of a tune,  which was very observable, and seemed below the dignity of the court. And  it appears he felt it so himself, for he said:] But this is by the mark,  and I doubt it is the first time we have had dance-tunes in this court.  The most part of the dancing we give occasion for is done at Tyburn.  [Looking at the prisoner, who appeared very much disordered.] You said  the tune was material to your case, Mr Attorney, and upon my life I think  Mr Martin agrees with you. What ails you, man? staring like a player that  sees a ghost!    _Pris._ My lord, I was amazed at hearing such trivial, foolish things as  they bring against me.    _L.C.J._ Well, well, it lies upon Mr Attorney to show whether they be  trivial or not: but I must say, if he has nothing worse than this he has  said, you have no great cause to be in amaze. Doth it not lie something  deeper? But go on, Mr Attorney.    _Att._ My lord and gentlemen--all that I have said so far you may indeed  very reasonably reckon as having an appearance of triviality. And, to be  sure, had the matter gone no further than the humouring of a poor silly  girl by a young gentleman of quality, it had been very well. But to  proceed. We shall make it appear that after three or four weeks the  prisoner became contracted to a young gentlewoman of that country, one  suitable every way to his own condition, and such an arrangement was on  foot that seemed to promise him a happy and a reputable living. But  within no very long time it seems that this young gentlewoman, hearing of  the jest that was going about that countryside with regard to the  prisoner and Ann Clark, conceived that it was not only an unworthy  carriage on the part of her lover, but a derogation to herself that he  should suffer his name to be sport for tavern company: and so without  more ado she, with the consent of her parents, signified to the prisoner  that the match between them was at an end. We shall show you that upon  the receipt of this intelligence the prisoner was greatly enraged against  Ann Clark as being the cause of his misfortune (though indeed there was  nobody answerable for it but himself), and that he made use of many  outrageous expressions and threatenings against her, and subsequently  upon meeting with her both abused her and struck at her with his whip:  but she, being but a poor innocent, could not be persuaded to desist from  her attachment to him, but would often run after him testifying with  gestures and broken words the affection she had to him: until she was  become, as he said, the very plague of his life. Yet, being that affairs  in which he was now engaged necessarily took him by the house in which  she lived, he could not (as I am willing to believe he would otherwise  have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/964"],[0,"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood (#18)"],[1,"longer than thine, and I would not take vantage of thee by even  so much as an inch.\"    \"Nay, I pass not for length,\" answered the Tanner. \"My staff is long  enough to knock down a calf; so look to thyself, fellow, I say again.\"    So, without more ado, each gripped his staff in the middle, and, with  fell and angry looks, they came slowly together.      Now news had been brought to Robin Hood how that Little John, instead of  doing his bidding, had passed by duty for pleasure, and so had stopped  overnight with merry company at the Blue Boar Inn, instead of going  straight to Ancaster. So, being vexed to his heart by this, he set forth  at dawn of day to seek Little John at the Blue Boar, or at least to  meet the yeoman on the way, and ease his heart of what he thought of the  matter. As thus he strode along in anger, putting together the words he  would use to chide Little John, he heard, of a sudden, loud and angry  voices, as of men in a rage, passing fell words back and forth from one  to the other. At this, Robin Hood stopped and listened. \"Surely,\" quoth  he to himself, \"that is Little John's voice, and he is talking in anger  also. Methinks the other is strange to my ears. Now Heaven forfend that  my good trusty Little John should have fallen into the hands of the  King's rangers. I must see to this matter, and that quickly.\"    Thus spoke Robin Hood to himself, all his anger passing away like a  breath from the windowpane, at the thought that perhaps his trusty  right-hand man was in some danger of his life. So cautiously he made his  way through the thickets whence the voices came, and, pushing aside the  leaves, peeped into the little open space where the two men, staff in  hand, were coming slowly together.    \"Ha!\" quoth Robin to himself, \"here is merry sport afoot. Now I would  give three golden angels from my own pocket if yon stout fellow would  give Little John a right sound drubbing! It would please me to see him  well thumped for having failed in my bidding. I fear me, though, there  is but poor chance of my seeing such a pleasant sight.\" So saying, he  stretched himself at length upon the ground, that he might not only see  the sport the better, but that he might enjoy the merry sight at his  ease.    As you may have seen two dogs that think to fight, walking slowly round  and round each other, neither cur wishing to begin the combat, so those  two stout yeomen moved slowly around, each watching for a chance to take  the other unaware, and so get in the first blow. At last Little John  struck like a flash, and--\"rap!\"--the Tanner met the blow and turned it  aside, and then smote back at Little John, who also turned the blow; and  so this mighty battle began. Then up and down and back and forth they  trod, the blows falling so thick and fast that, at a distance, one would  have thought that half a score of men were fighting. Thus they fought  for nigh a half an hour, until the ground was all plowed up with the  digging of their heels, and their breathing grew labored like the ox in  the furrow. But Little John suffered the most, for he had become unused  to such stiff labor, and his joints were not as supple as they had been  before he went to dwell with the Sheriff.    All this time Robin Hood lay beneath the bush, rejoicing at such a  comely bout of quarterstaff. \"By my faith!\" quoth he to himself, \"never  had I thought to see Little John so evenly matched in all my life.  Belike, though, he would have overcome yon fellow before this had he  been in his former trim.\"    At last Little John saw his chance, and, throwing all the strength  he felt going from him into one blow that might have felled an ox,  he struck at the Tanner with might and main. And now did the Tanner's  cowhide cap stand him in good stead, and but for it he might never have  held staff in hand again. As it was, the blow he caught beside the head  was so shrewd that it sent him staggering across the little glade, so  that, if Little John had had the strength to follow up his vantage, it  would have been ill for stout Arthur. But he regained himself quickly  and, at arm's length, struck back a blow at Little John, and this time  the stroke reached its mark, and down went Little John at full length,  his cudgel flying from his hand as he fell. Then, raising his staff,  stout Arthur dealt him another blow upon the ribs.    \"Hold!\" roared Little John. \"Wouldst thou strike a man when he is down?\"    \"Ay, marry would I,\" quoth the Tanner, giving him another thwack with  his staff.    \"Stop!\" roared Little John. \"Help! Hold, I say! I yield me! I yield me,  I say, good fellow!\"    \"Hast thou had enough?\" asked the Tanner grimly, holding his staff  aloft.    \"Ay, marry, and more than enough.\"    \"And thou dost own that I am the better man of the two?\"    \"Yea, truly, and a murrain seize thee!\" said Little John, the first  aloud and the last to his beard.    \"Then thou mayst go thy ways; and thank thy patron saint that I am a  merciful man,\" said the Tanner.    \"A plague o' such mercy as thine!\" said Little John, sitting up and  feeling his ribs where the Tanner had cudgeled him. \"I make my vow, my  ribs feel as though every one of them were broken in twain. I tell thee,  good fellow, I did think there was never a man in all Nottinghamshire  could do to me what thou hast done this day.\"    \"And so thought I, also,\" cried Robin Hood, bursting out of the thicket  and shouting with laughter till the tears ran down his cheeks. \"O man,  man!\" said he, as well as he could for his mirth, \"'a didst go over  like a bottle knocked from a wall. I did see the whole merry bout, and  never did I think to see thee yield thyself so, hand and foot, to any  man in all merry England. I was seeking thee, to chide thee for leaving  my bidding undone; but thou hast been paid all I owed thee, full  measure, pressed down and overflowing, by this good fellow. Marry, 'a  did reach out his arm full length while thou stood gaping at him, and,  with a pretty rap, tumbled thee over as never have I seen one tumbled  before.\" So spoke bold Robin, and all the time Little John sat upon the  ground, looking as though he had sour curds in his mouth. \"What may be  thy name, good fellow?\" said Robin, next, turning to the Tanner.    \"Men do call me Arthur a Bland,\" spoke up the Tanner boldly, \"and now  what may be thy name?\"    \"Ha, Arthur a Bland!\" quoth Robin, \"I have heard thy name before, good  fellow. Thou didst break the crown of a friend of mine at the fair at  Ely last October. The folk there call him Jock o' Nottingham; we call  him Will Scathelock. This poor fellow whom thou hast so belabored is  counted the best hand at the quarterstaff in all merry England. His name  is Little John, and mine Robin Hood.\"    \"How!\" cried the Tanner, \"art thou indeed the great Robin Hood, and is  this the famous Little John? Marry, had I known who thou art, I would  never have been so bold as to lift my hand against thee. Let me help  thee to thy feet, good Master Little John, and let me brush the dust  from off thy coat.\"    \"Nay,\" quoth Little John testily, at the same time rising carefully,  as though his bones had been made of glass, \"I can help myself, good  fellow, without thy aid; and let me tell thee, had it not been for that  vile cowskin cap of thine, it would have been ill for thee this day.\"    At this Robin laughed again, and, turning to the Tanner, he said, \"Wilt  thou join my band, good Arthur? For I make my vow thou art one of the  stoutest men that ever mine eyes beheld.\"    \"Will I join thy band?\" cried the Tanner joyfully. \"Ay, marry, will I!  Hey for a merry life!\" cried he, leaping aloft and snapping his fingers,  \"and hey for the life I love! Away with tanbark and filthy vats and foul  cowhides! I will follow thee to the ends of the earth, good master, and  not a herd of dun deer in all the forest but shall know the sound of the  twang of my bowstring.\"    \"As for thee, Little John,\" said Robin, turning to him and laughing,  \"thou wilt start once more for Ancaster, and we will go part way with  thee, for I will not have thee turn again to either the right hand or  the left till thou hast fairly gotten away from Sherwood. There are  other inns that thou knowest yet, hereabouts.\" Thereupon, leaving the  thickets, they took once more to the highway and departed upon their  business.          Robin Hood and Will Scarlet    THUS THEY traveled along the sunny road, three stout fellows such as you  could hardly match anywhere else in all merry England. Many stopped to  gaze after them as they strode along, so broad were their shoulders and  so sturdy their gait.    Quoth Robin Hood to Little John, \"Why didst thou not go straight to  Ancaster, yesterday, as I told thee? Thou hadst not gotten thyself into  such a coil hadst thou done as I ordered.\"    \"I feared the rain that threatened,\" said Little John in a sullen tone,  for he was vexed at being so chaffed by Robin with what had happened to  him.    \"The rain!\" cried Robin, stopping of a sudden in the middle of the road,  and looking at Little John in wonder. \"Why, thou great oaf! not a drop  of rain has fallen these three days, neither has any threatened, nor  hath there been a sign of foul weather in earth or sky or water.\"    \"Nevertheless,\" growled Little John, \"the holy Saint Swithin holdeth the  waters of the heavens in his pewter pot, and he could have poured them  out, had he chosen, even from a clear sky; and wouldst thou have had me  wet to the skin?\"    At this Robin Hood burst into a roar of laughter. \"O Little John!\" said  he, \"what butter wits hast thou in that head of thine! Who could hold  anger against such a one as thou art?\"    So saying, they all stepped out once more, with the right foot foremost,  as the saying is.    After they had traveled some distance, the day being warm and the road  dusty, Robin Hood waxed thirsty; so, there being a fountain of water as  cold as ice, just"]]]
