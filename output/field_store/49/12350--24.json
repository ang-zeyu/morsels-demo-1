I reckon about two days' ride. Poor stock country, so you  ain't liable to meet rustlers. All the same, better hit the trail at  night an' go careful.\"    At sunset two days later Duane and Jennie mounted their horses and said  good-by to the rancher and his wife. Andrews would not listen to Duane's  thanks.    \"I tell you I'm beholden to you yet,\" he declared.    \"Well, what can I do for you?\" asked Duane. \"I may come along here again  some day.\"    \"Get down an' come in, then, or you're no friend of mine. I reckon there  ain't nothin' I can think of--I just happen to remember--\" Here he led  Duane out of earshot of the women and went on in a whisper. \"Buck, I  used to be well-to-do. Got skinned by a man named Brown--Rodney Brown.  He lives in Huntsville, an' he's my enemy. I never was much on fightin',  or I'd fixed him. Brown ruined me--stole all I had. He's a hoss an'  cattle thief, an' he has pull enough at home to protect him. I reckon I  needn't say any more.\"    \"Is this Brown a man who shot an outlaw named Stevens?\" queried Duane,  curiously.    \"Shore, he's the same. I heard thet story. Brown swears he plugged  Stevens through the middle. But the outlaw rode off, an' nobody ever  knew for shore.\"    \"Luke Stevens died of that shot. I buried him,\" said Duane.    Andrews made no further comment, and the two men returned to the women.    \"The main road for about three miles, then where it forks take the  left-hand road and keep on straight. That what you said, Andrews?\"    \"Shore. An' good luck to you both!\"    Duane and Jennie trotted away into the gathering twilight. At the moment  an insistent thought bothered Duane. Both Luke Stevens and the rancher  Andrews had hinted to Duane to kill a man named Brown. Duane wished  with all his heart that they had not mentioned it, let alone taken for  granted the execution of the deed. What a bloody place Texas was! Men  who robbed and men who were robbed both wanted murder. It was in the  spirit of the country. Duane certainly meant to avoid ever meeting this  Rodney Brown. And that very determination showed Duane how dangerous  he really was--to men and to himself. Sometimes he had a feeling of how  little stood between his sane and better self and a self utterly wild  and terrible. He reasoned that only intelligence could save him--only a  thoughtful understanding of his danger and a hold upon some ideal.    Then he fell into low conversation with Jennie, holding out hopeful  views of her future, and presently darkness set in. The sky was overcast  with heavy clouds; there was no air moving; the heat and oppression  threatened storm. By and by Duane could not see a rod in front of him,  though his horse had no difficulty in keeping to the road. Duane was  bothered by the blackness of the night. Traveling fast was impossible,  and any moment he might miss the road that led off to the left. So  he was compelled to give all his attention to peering into the thick  shadows ahead. As good luck would have it, he came to higher ground  where there was less mesquite, and therefore not such impenetrable  darkness; and at this point he came to where the road split.    Once headed in the right direction, he felt easier in mind. To his  annoyance, however, a fine, misty rain set in. Jennie was not well  dressed for wet weather; and, for that matter, neither was he. His coat,  which in that dry warm climate he seldom needed, was tied behind his  saddle, and he put it on Jennie.    They traveled on. The rain fell steadily; if anything, growing thicker.  Duane grew uncomfortably wet and chilly. Jennie, however, fared somewhat  better by reason of the heavy coat. The night passed quickly despite the  discomfort, and soon a gray, dismal, rainy dawn greeted the travelers.    Jennie insisted that he find some shelter where a fire could be built to  dry his clothes. He was not in a fit condition to risk catching cold.  In fact, Duane's teeth were chattering. To find a shelter in that barren  waste seemed a futile task. Quite unexpectedly, however, they happened  upon a deserted adobe cabin situated a little off the road. Not only did  it prove to have a dry interior, but also there was firewood. Water  was available in pools everywhere; however, there was no grass for the  horses.    A good fire and hot food and drink changed the aspect of their condition  as far as comfort went. And Jennie lay down to sleep. For Duane,  however, there must be vigilance. This cabin was no hiding-place. The  rain fell harder all the time, and the wind changed to the north. \"It's  a norther, all right,\" muttered Duane. \"Two or three days.\" And he felt  that his extraordinary luck had not held out. Still one point favored  him, and it was that travelers were not likely to come along during the  storm. Jennie slept while Duane watched. The saving of this girl meant  more to him than any task he had ever assumed. First it had been partly  from a human feeling to succor an unfortunate woman, and partly a motive  to establish clearly to himself that he was no outlaw. Lately, however,  had come a different sense, a strange one, with something personal and  warm and protective in it.    As he looked down upon her, a slight, slender girl with bedraggled dress  and disheveled hair, her face, pale and quiet, a little stern in sleep,  and her long, dark lashes lying on her cheek, he seemed to see her  fragility, her prettiness, her femininity as never before. But for him  she might at that very moment have been a broken, ruined girl lying  back in that cabin of the Blands'. The fact gave him a feeling of his  importance in this shifting of her destiny. She was unharmed, still  young; she would forget and be happy; she would live to be a good  wife and mother. Somehow the thought swelled his heart. His act,  death-dealing as it had been, was a noble one, and helped him to hold  on to his drifting hopes. Hardly once since Jennie had entered into his  thought had those ghosts returned to torment him.    To-morrow she would be gone among good, kind people with a possibility  of finding her relatives. He thanked God for that; nevertheless, he felt  a pang.    She slept more than half the day. Duane kept guard, always alert,  whether he was sitting, standing, or walking. The rain pattered steadily  on the roof and sometimes came in gusty flurries through the door.  The horses were outside in a shed that afforded poor shelter, and they  stamped restlessly. Duane kept them saddled and bridled.    About the middle of the afternoon Jennie awoke. They cooked a meal  and afterward sat beside the little fire. She had never been, in his  observation of her, anything but a tragic figure, an unhappy girl, the  farthest removed from serenity and poise. That characteristic capacity  for agitation struck him as stronger in her this day. He attributed it,  however, to the long strain, the suspense nearing an end. Yet sometimes  when her eyes were on him she did not seem to be thinking of her  freedom, of her future.    \"This time to-morrow you'll be in Shelbyville,\" he said.    \"Where will you be?\" she asked, quickly.    \"Me? Oh, I'll be making tracks for some lonesome place,\" he replied.    The girl shuddered.    \"I've been brought up in Texas. I remember what a hard lot the men of my  family had. But poor as they were, they had a roof over their heads,  a hearth with a fire, a warm bed--somebody to love them. And you,  Duane--oh, my God! What must your life be? You must ride and hide and  watch eternally. No decent food, no pillow, no friendly word, no clean  clothes, no woman's hand! Horses, guns, trails, rocks, holes--these must  be the important things in your life. You must go on riding, hiding,  killing until you meet--\"    She ended with a sob and dropped her head on her knees. Duane was  amazed, deeply touched.    \"My girl, thank you for that thought of me,\" he said, with a tremor in  his voice. \"You don't know how much that means to me.\"    She raised her face, and it was tear-stained, eloquent, beautiful.    \"I've heard tell--the best of men go to the bad out there. You won't.  Promise me you won't. I never--knew any man--like you. I--I--we may  never see each other again--after to-day. I'll never forget you. I'll  pray for you, and I'll never give up trying to--to do something. Don't  despair. It's never too late. It was my hope that kept me alive--out  there at Bland's--before you came. I was only a poor weak girl. But if  I could hope--so can you. Stay away from men. Be a lone wolf. Fight for  your life. Stick out your exile--and maybe--some day--\"    Then she lost her voice. Duane clasped her hand and with feeling as deep  as hers promised to remember her words. In her despair for him she had  spoken wisdom--pointed out the only course.    Duane's vigilance, momentarily broken by emotion, had no sooner  reasserted itself than he discovered the bay horse, the one Jennie rode,  had broken his halter and gone off. The soft wet earth had deadened the  sound of his hoofs. His tracks were plain in the mud. There were clumps  of mesquite in sight, among which the horse might have strayed. It  turned out, however, that he had not done so.    Duane did not want to leave Jennie alone in the cabin so near the road.  So he put her up on his horse and bade her follow. The rain had ceased  for the time being, though evidently the storm was not yet over. The  tracks led up a wash to a wide flat where mesquite, prickly pear, and  thorn-bush grew so thickly that Jennie could not ride into it. Duane was  thoroughly concerned. He must have her horse. Time was flying. It would  soon be night. He could not expect her to scramble quickly through that  brake on foot. Therefore he decided to risk leaving her at the edge of  the thicket and go in alone.    As he went in a sound startled him.

Betty managed to turn aside her chum's curiosity and to get away to  Libbie and give her the note. They burned it in the flame of a candle,  and counted the money. It was all there, folded just as Libbie had  placed it in the bottle. Evidently Ada had never carried it.    Libbie paid Louise the money she had borrowed of her and gave Betty the  amount she owed her, most of which was Bob's.    \"Now do try to be more sensible, Libbie,\" pleaded Betty, turning to go  back to Bobby. \"When you want to do something romantic think twice and  count a hundred.\"    \"I will!\" promised Libbie fervently. \"I'll never be so silly  again, Betty.\"    But dear me, she was, a hundred times! But in a different way each time.  Libbie would be Libbie to the end of the chapter.    Betty, rushing back to brush her hair for dinner, heard a sound  suspiciously like a sob as she passed Norma Guerin's door. It was  unlatched, and as no one answered when she tapped Betty gently pushed it  open and stepped into the room.    Norma lay on her bed crying as though her heart would break, and Alice,  looking very forlorn and solemn, was holding a letter in her hand.          CHAPTER XX    THE SECOND DEGREE      \"My patience, what a world of trouble this is!\" sighed Betty to herself,  but aloud she said cheerily: \"What's the matter with Norma?\"    Norma sat up, mopping her eyes.    \"Oh, Betty,\" she choked, \"I don't believe Alice and I can come back  after Christmas! They've had a fire in Glenside and a house dad owns  there burned. He hasn't a cent of insurance, and the mortgagee takes  the ground. So that's the rental right out of our income. Besides,  grandma has had an operation on her eyes and she has to spend weeks in  an expensive Philadelphia hospital. Even with the small fees the  surgeons charge because of dad, the board will amount to more than he  can afford to pay. Alice and I ought to be learning stenography or  something useful.\"    \"Well, now, your father would say,\" suggested Betty, with determined  optimism, \"that the Christmas vacation is too far off to make any plans  about what you're going to do afterward. You know Bobby Littell has set  her heart on you and Alice spending the recess with them in Washington.  Anyway, lots of things can turn up before Christmas, Norma--even the  treasure!\"    Norma tried to smile.    \"I dream about that chasm nearly every night,\" she said. \"Sometimes I  think the Indians came back and got the stuff, Betty. They're so clever  about climbing, and I know they wouldn't easily give up.\"    \"Nonsense!\" chided Betty. \"The treasure is there, and we've just got to  think up a way to get it out. At all costs you mustn't cry yourself sick  about the future--you'll spoil all the fun awaiting you in the weeks  before Christmas. And you know you can't study as well when you're  depressed, and, goodness knows! one has to study at Shadyside.\"    \"I've a headache now,\" confessed Norma, pushing her tumbled hair out  of her eyes. \"I can't go down to dinner--I'm a perfect sight. There's  the bell!\"    \"Just lie down and try to rest,\" advised Betty, smoothing the tangled  covers with a deft hand. \"I'll bring you up some supper on a tray. Aunt  Nancy thinks you're an angel on general principles, and she has a special  soft spot in her heart for you because her mother used to cook for your  grandmother. Come on, Alice, we'll turn the light out and let her rest  her eyes.\"    \"I do wish some one would think up a way to get those pearls and the  gold,\" fretted Betty, turning restlessly on her pillow that night. \"If  Norma and Alice are ever going to be well-off now is the time. When  they're so old they can't walk, money won't do 'em any good!\"    Which showed that Betty, for all her sound sense, was still a little  girl. Very old ladies, who can not walk, certainly need money to make  them comfortable and keep them so.    The next night was Friday, and Betty welcomed the prospect of the second  degree necessary to stamp the freshmen as full-fledged members of the  Mysterious For. The week had been noticeably tinged with indigo for at  least two of Betty's friends, and she hoped the initiation might take  their minds from their troubles.    The second degree, it was whispered about among the girls, was bound to  be a \"hummer.\"    \"They say it's a test of your character,\" said Bobby, with a shiver.  \"Somehow, Betty, my character oozes out of my shoes when it knows it  should be prancing up to the firing line.\"    \"I guess you imagine that,\" smiled Betty. \"Speak sternly to it, Bobby,  and explain that funking is out of the question.\"    However, more girls than Bobby found it necessary to clutch at their  oozing courage when, upon assembling in the large hall, the lights  suddenly went out. In the shadows, four white veiled figures were seen  slowly to mount the platform.    \"To-night,\" said one of them, stretching out a long arm and pointing  toward the fascinated and expectant audience, \"we are your fates! You  have come to the final tests. We have no choice in these tests, nor have  you. You are to come forward, one at a time, and take a slip from this  basket here on the table. Go directly to your room after drawing your  slip, and there open it and follow the directions explicitly. Come to the  platform in the order in which you are seated, please.\"    The lights did not come on, and one by one the girls stumbled up the  steps to the platform, felt around in the basket, and drew a slip. Then  they hurried away to their rooms to see what was to happen next.    Bobby and Betty could hardly wait to open their notes, and before they  had them fairly digested, Frances and Libbie and Constance and Louise and  the Guerin girls were crowding in to compare notes.    \"I have to go and ask Miss Prettyman if I may telephone to Salsette  Academy and ask for a lost-and-found notice on their bulletin board,\"  wailed Bobby. \"I'm supposed to have lost a pair of gloves at the last  football game. I always have the worst luck! Can't you imagine how Miss  Prettyman will lecture me? She'll say that at my age I ought to have  something in my head besides excuses to talk to the boys!\"    The girls laughed, recognizing the ring of prophecy in Bobby's speech.    \"That's nothing--I'm to row Dora Estabrooke twice around the lake,\"  mourned Louise. \"She weighs two hundred, if she weighs a pound. Thank  goodness, I don't have to do it to-night.\"    Norma was instructed to walk three times around the cellar, chanting  \"Little Boy Blue\" before ten o'clock that night. Frances Martin, to her  horror, was enjoined to produce six live angle worms the following  morning--\"and you know I despise the wiggling things,\" she wailed. Alice  Guerin, the silent member of the octette, was condemned to recite \"The  Children's Hour\" in the dining room \"between cereal and eggs.\" And  Constance Howard was told she must add up an unbelievably long column of  figures and present the correct answer within half an hour. Constance's  _bete noir_ was figures, and already these long columns danced dizzily  before her eyes.    \"You needn't tell me that chance made such canny selections,\" observed  Betty. \"One of those girls manipulated the right notes into our hands.  Libbie, what does yours say?\"    Libbie handed her slip of paper to Betty without a word.    \"Go to bed at once,\" the latter read aloud.    There was a gale of laughter. Libbie, the curious, who dearly loved to  hear and see, to be sent off to bed in the middle of the most wildly  exciting night they had known in weeks!    \"Hurry,\" admonished Bobby. \"You're disobeying by staying up this long.  Where's your character, Libbie?\"    Libbie scowled, but departed, grumbling that she didn't see why she  couldn't stay up and watch Norma walk down in the cellar.    \"Mine is the most spooky,\" said Betty, when the door had closed behind  Libbie. \"Listen--I'm to climb the water tower at midnight and leave this  card there to show I have complied.\"    She held out a little plain white card in a green envelope.    \"Hark! was that somebody at the door?\" asked Bobby, and she ran over to  it lightly and jerked it open.    The corridor was empty.    \"We're all nervous,\" remarked Betty lightly. \"I'll set the alarm for  eleven-forty-five and put the clock under my pillow so Miss Lacey won't  hear it. I'll lie down all dressed, and then I won't have to use a light.  She might see that through the transom.\"    \"Don't you want some of us to go with you?\" asked Constance. \"We needn't  go up into the tower, if you say not. But at least we could go that far  with you; you might fall off the roof.\"    \"No, please, I'd rather go alone,\" said Betty firmly. \"It's a test, you  see, and the idea isn't to make it easy. I'll be all right, and in the  morning the girls will find the card and know I didn't flunk.\"    After the girls had gone away to their own rooms the clock was set for a  quarter of twelve, but Betty and Bobby decided that they might as well  stay awake till midnight. They would lie down on their beds--Betty  insisted that Bobby should undress and go to bed \"right\"--and wait for  the time to come. Within twenty minutes they were both sound asleep.    The muffled whir of her alarm clock awakened Betty. For a moment she was  dazed, then recollection cleared her mind. She slipped to the floor  without waking Bobby and softly tiptoed from the room.    A dim light burned in the corridor, and Betty knew the way to the water  tower. To reach it, one had to mount to the roof of the dormitory  building. Betty experienced a little difficulty with the obstinate catch  of the scuttle cover, but she finally mastered it and stepped out on the  tarred graveled roof. The water tower, a huge tank on an iron framework,  had a little enclosed room built directly under it reached by an iron  ladder. Here the engineer kept various plumbing tools. It "]]]
