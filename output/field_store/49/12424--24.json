In the same year also, he joined  himself with two others of the Society to visit such members of it, as  possessed slaves in Chester county. In this journey he describes himself to  have met with several, who were pleased with his visit but to have found  difficulties with others, towards whom however he felt a sympathy and  tenderness on account of their being entangled by the spirit of the world.    In the year 1759, he visited several of the Society who held slaves in  Philadelphia. In about three months afterwards, he travelled there again,  in company with John Churchman, to see others under similar circumstances.  He then went to different places on the same errand. In this last journey  he went alone. After this he joined himself to John Churchman again, but he  confined his labours to his own province. Here he had the pleasure of  finding that the work prospered. Soon after this he took Samuel Eastburne  as a coadjutor, and pleaded the cause of the poor Africans with many of the  Society in Bucks county, who held them in bondage there.    In the year 1760, he travelled, in company with his friend Samuel  Eastburne, to Rhode Island, to promote the same object. This island had  been long noted for its trade to Africa for slaves. He found at Newport,  the great sea-port town belonging to it, that a number of them had been  lately imported. He felt his mind deeply impressed on this account. He was  almost overpowered in consequence of it, and became ill. He thought once of  promoting a petition to the legislature, to discourage all such  importations in future. He then thought of going and speaking to the House  of Assembly, which was then sitting; but he was discouraged from both these  proceedings. He held, however, a conference with many of his own Society in  the meeting-house-chamber, where the subject of his visit was discussed on  both sides, with a calm and peaceable spirit. Many of those present  manifested the concern they felt at their former practices, and others a  desire of taking suitable care of their slaves at their decease. From  Newport he proceeded to Nantucket; but observing the members of the Society  there to have few or no slaves, he exhorted them to persevere in abstaining  from the use of them, and returned home.    In the year 1761, he visited several families in Pennsylvania, and, in  about three months afterwards, others about Shrewsbury and Squan in New  Jersey. On his return he added a second part to the treatise before  published on the keeping of slaves, a care which had been growing upon him  for some years.    In the year 1762, he printed, published, and distributed this treatise.    In 1767, he went on foot to the western shores of the same province on a  religious visit. After having crossed the Susquehanna, his old feelings  returned to him; for coming amongst people living in outward ease and  greatness, chiefly on the labour of slaves, his heart was much affected,  and he waited with humble resignation, to learn how he should further  perform his duty to this injured people. The travelling on foot, though it  was agreeable to the state of his mind, he describes to have been wearisome  to his body. He felt himself weakly at times, in consequence of it, but yet  continued to travel on. At one of the quarterly meetings of the Society,  being in great sorrow and heaviness, and under deep exercise on account of  the miseries of the poor Africans, he expressed himself freely to those  present, who held them in bondage. He expatiated on the tenderness and  loving-kindness of the apostles, as manifested in labours, perils, and  sufferings, towards the poor Gentiles, and contrasted their treatment of  the Gentiles with it, whom he described in the persons of their slaves: and  was much satisfied with the result of his discourse.    From this time we collect little more from his journal concerning him, than  that, in 1772, he embarked for England on a religious visit. After his  arrival there, he travelled through many counties, preaching in different  meetings of the Society, till he came to the city of York. But even here,  though he was far removed from the sight of those whose interests he had so  warmly espoused, he was not forgetful of their wretched condition. At the  quarterly meeting for that county, he brought their case before those  present in an affecting manner. He exhorted these to befriend their cause.  He remarked that as they, the Society, when under outward sufferings, had  often found a concern to lay them before the legislature, and thereby, in  the Lord's time, had obtained relief; so he recommended this oppressed part  of the creation to their notice, that they might, as the way opened,  represent their sufferings as individuals, if not as a religious society,  to those in authority in this land. This was the last opportunity that he  had of interesting himself in behalf of this injured people; for soon  afterwards he was seized with the small-pox at the house of a friend in the  city of York, where he died.    The next person belonging to the Society of the Quakers, who laboured in  behalf of the oppressed Africans, was Anthony Benezet. He was born before,  and he lived after, John Woolman; of course he was cotemporary with him. I  place him after John Woolman, because he was not so much known as a  labourer, till two or three years after the other had begun to move in the  same cause.    Anthony Benezet was born at St. Quintin in Picardy, of a respectable  family, in the year 1713. His father was one of the many protestants, who,  in consequence of the persecutions which followed the revocation of the  edict of Nantz, sought an asylum in foreign countries. After a short stay  in Holland, he settled, with his wife and children, in London, in 1715.    Anthony Benezet, having received from his father a liberal education,  served an apprenticeship in an eminent mercantile house in London. In 1731,  however, he removed with his family to Philadelphia, where he joined in  profession with the Quakers. His three brothers then engaged in trade, and  made considerable pecuniary acquisitions in it. He himself might have  partaken both of their concerns and of their prosperity; but he did not  feel himself at liberty to embark in their undertakings. He considered the  accumulation of wealth as of no importance, when compared with the  enjoyment of doing good; and he chose the humble situation of a  schoolmaster, as according best with this notion, believing, that by  endeavouring to train up youth in knowledge and virtue, he should become  more extensively useful than in any other way to his fellow-creatures.    He had not been long in his new situation, before he manifested such an  uprightness of conduct, such a courtesy of manners, such a purity of  intention, and such a spirit of benevolence, that he attracted the notice,  and gained the good opinion, of the inhabitants among whom he lived. He had  ready access to them, in consequence, upon all occasions; and, if there  were any whom he failed to influence at any of these times, he never went  away without the possession of their respect.    In the year 1756, when a considerable number of French families were  removed from Acadia into Pennsylvania, on account of some political  suspicions, he felt deeply interested about them. In a country where few  understood their language, they were wretched and helpless; but Anthony  Benezet endeavoured to soften the rigour of their situation, by his kind  attention towards them. He exerted himself also in their behalf, by  procuring many contributions for them, which, by the consent of his  fellow-citizens, were entrusted to his care.    As the principle of benevolence, when duly cultivated, brings forth fresh  shoots, and becomes enlarged, so we find this amiable person extending the  sphere of his usefulness, by becoming an advocate for the oppressed African  race. For this service he seems to have been peculiarly qualified. Indeed,  as in all great works a variety of talents is necessary to bring them to  perfection, so Providence seems to prepare different men as instruments,  with dispositions and qualifications so various, that each, in pursuing  that line which seems to suit him best, contributes to furnish those parts,  which, when put together, make up a complete whole. In this point of view,  John Woolman found, in Anthony Benezet, the coadjutor, whom, of all others,  the cause required. The former had occupied himself principally on the  subject of Slavery. The latter went to the root of the evil, and more  frequently attacked the Trade. The former chiefly confined his labours to  America, and chiefly to those of his own Society there. The latter, when he  wrote, did not write for America only, but for Europe also, and endeavoured  to spread a knowledge and hatred of the traffic through the great society  of the world.    One of the means which Anthony Benezet took to promote the cause in  question, (and an effectual one it proved, as far as it went,) was to give  his scholars a due knowledge and proper impressions concerning it. Situated  as they were likely to be, in after-life, in a country where slavery was a  custom, for the promotion of his plans.    To enlighten others, and to give them a similar bias, he had recourse to  different measures from time to time. In the almanacs published annually in  Philadelphia, he procured articles to be inserted, which he believed would  attract the notice of the reader, and make him pause, at least for a while,  as to the licitness of the Slave-trade. He wrote, also, as he saw occasion,  in the public papers of the day. From small things he proceeded to greater.  He collected, at length, further information on the subject, and, winding  it up with observations and reflections, he produced several little tracts,  which he circulated successively (but generally at his own expense), as he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12434"],[0,"Twelve Studies on the Making of a Nation: The Beginnings of Israel's History (#19)"],[1,"his conscience,  to violate a law that has been adopted by the representatives of  his fellow citizens as just and beneficial.  Thus the individual,  in later even more than in earlier times, obeys the laws not merely  from selfish, but from social and religious motives.      _Questions for Further Consideration_.    Can you name any modern laws that you think have been framed in the  interests of a special social class?    Do you think that the people of to-day are recreant in their  respect for or adherence to law?    What do you consider to be the value of such institutions as those  at West Point and Annapolis in their influence on the enforcement  of law and discipline?    When we speak of \"Government of the people, by the people, and for  the people,\" whom exactly do we mean by \"people\"?  Does the word  have the same meaning in each of these phrases?    Is it ever right to violate a law of the land?  Some people contend  that an individual ought to break a human law, provided that it is  contrary to divine law.  What is divine law?  Who decides?  Shall  the individual decide, or is that the duty of the community?  Or of  the clergy? Was it right for the Abolitionists to violate the  provisions of the fugitive slave law?  Were this handful of men,  able and conscientious as they were, as likely to be right  regarding the welfare of society as the large majority of citizens  whose representatives had enacted the fugitive slave law?  If a  person believes our tariff laws to be unjust, is it right for him  to smuggle goods?    Under what circumstances, if any, is it one's duty to disobey a law  of the state?  Would the fact that an individual believed it his  duty to violate the law justify a judge in declining to punish him?  Thoreau declined to pay a tax that he believed unjust and accepted  his punishment, declaring that if he paid the penalty he might thus  arouse public sentiment and secure the repeal of the law.  Was John  Brown justified in attempting illegally to free slaves by force of  arms?    In Great Britain the House of Lords--one of the law-making  bodies--is also the highest court of appeal, although the judicial  business is mostly done by law lords specially appointed for that  purpose.  Ought the same men to make and interpret the law?  Why?      _Subjects for Further Study_.    (1) Origin and Growth of Hebrew Law.  Hastings, _Dict. of Bible_,  III, 64-67; _Ency.

THE HISTORY OF THE PROPHETIC DECALOGUE.    The decalogues of Exodus 20-23 clearly represent the earliest canon  of the Old Testament.  These are intended to define clearly the  obligations of the nation to Jehovah, and to place these  obligations before the people so definitely that they would be  understood and met.  As the term \"decalogue,\" that is \"ten words,\"  indicates, the Biblical decalogue originally contained ten brief  sententious commands, easily memorized even by children.  Each of  the decalogues is divided into two groups of five laws or pentads.  This division of five and ten was without reasonable doubt intended  to aid the memory by associating each law with a finger or thumb of  the two hands.  Exodus 20-23 and its parallels in Deuteronomy  contain ten decalogues, that is a decalogue of decalogues,  suggesting that originally a decalogue was associated with each of  the fingers and thumbs of the two hands even as were the individual  words or commands.  This system of mnemonics was useful in teaching  a child nation.  It is still useful to-day.  It is important to  impress upon the child in this concrete way certain of the  fundamental obligations to God and man.  The form of the ten  commandments in part explains the commanding place which they still  hold in religious education throughout Christendom.    The Biblical accounts of the two decalogues in Exodus 20 and 34  vary in details.  The early Judean prophetic narrative in Exodus 34  states that these commands were inscribed by Moses himself on two  stone tablets.  In the later versions of the story Jehovah  inscribes them with his own fingers on the two tablets which he  gave to Moses.  That the older decalogue was written on two tablets  and set up in the temple of Solomon is exceedingly probable, for by  the days of the United Kingdom the Hebrews were beginning to become  acquainted with the art of writing and therefore could read the  laws in written form.  The recently discovered code of Hammurabi,  which comes from the twentieth century B.C., was inscribed in  parallel columns on a stone monument.  In the epilogue to this  wonderful code the king states: \"By the order of Shamash, the judge  supreme of heaven and earth, that judgment may shine in the land, I  set up a bas-relief to preserve my likeness in the great temple  that I love, to commemorate my name forever in gratitude.  The  oppressed who has a suit to prosecute may come before my image,  that of a righteous king, and read my inscription and understand my  precious words and let my stele elucidate his case.  Let him see  the law he seeks, and may he draw in his breath and say: 'This  Hammurabi was to his people like the father that begot them!'\"  Thus this devout king of ancient Babylonia graphically defines the  motive which, at a later period, led Israel's spiritual leaders to  set before the people those principles which made for the welfare  both of the nation and of the individual.  Each was keenly  conscious that the laws which brought social and spiritual health  to mankind emanated from the divine power that was guiding the  destinies of men.    Hebrew tradition has described in a great variety of narratives the  way in which God made known his will to the people.  The scene in  each case was Mount Sinai, which the ancient Hebrews as well as the  Kenites regarded as Jehovah's abode.  In the early Judean version,  as some writers classify the accounts, Moses alone ascends the  mountain, while the people are forbidden to approach.  In the  Northern Israelite version, the people approach, but being  terrified by the thunder and lightnings they request Moses to  receive for them the divine message.  This later version implies  that a raging thunder storm shrouded the sacred mountain, while the  early Judean and late priestly narratives apparently suggest an  active volcano.    The element common to all these accounts is that under the  direction of their prophetic leader, Moses, a solemn covenant was  established between the nation and Jehovah, and that the  obligations of the people were defined in the decalogue with its  ten short commands.  The problem is, however, complicated by the  presence of two decalogues, one now preserved in Exodus 34 and the  other, the familiar ten commandments of Exodus 20.  Both agree in  emphasizing as primary the nation's obligation to be loyal to  Jehovah.  The decalogue in Exodus 34, however, goes on to describe  in succeeding laws the ways in which the nation may show its  loyalty.  This was through the observation of certain ceremonial  customs and especially the great annual feasts.  Did most ancient  peoples show their loyalty to the gods by their lives and deeds or  by the ceremonies of the ritual and the offerings which they  brought to the altars?  The first great prophet Amos declared that  Jehovah hated and despised feasts and ceremonies unless accompanied  by deeds of justice and mercy.    The decalogue in Exodus 34 may well represent the original commands  which Moses laid upon the nation, but the higher moral sense of  later editors has truly recognized the superiority of the ethical  commands of the familiar decalogue in Exodus 20 and given it the  commanding place which it richly deserves.  (For a probable  literary history of this decalogue see _Hist.  Bible_ I, 194-5.)  The two decalogues of Exodus 20 and 34 are not duplicates the one  of the other, but rather supplement each other.  The one defines  the obligation of the nation, the other of the individual.  The  Hebrews long continued to retain in their homes the family images  inherited from their Semitic ancestors.  Not until the days of Amos  and Isaiah did the prophets begin to protest against the calves or  bulls and the cherubim in the sanctuaries of Northern Israel, and  even in the temple at Jerusalem.
