Sunday lunch at a public-school house is probably one of the longest  functions in existence. It drags its slow length along like a languid  snake, but it finishes in time. In due course Mr. Downing, after sitting  still and eyeing with acute dislike everybody who asked for a second  helping, found himself at liberty.    Regardless of the claims of digestion, he rushed forth on the trail.    Sergeant Collard lived with his wife and a family of unknown dimensions  in the lodge at the school front gate. Dinner was just over when Mr.  Downing arrived, as a blind man could have told.    The sergeant received his visitor with dignity, ejecting the family, who  were torpid after roast beef and resented having to move, in order to  ensure privacy.    Having requested his host to smoke, which the latter was about to do  unasked, Mr. Downing stated his case.    \"Mr. Outwood,\" he said, \"tells me that last night, Sergeant, you saw a  boy endeavoring to enter his house.\"    The sergeant blew a cloud of smoke. \"Oo-oo-oo, yer,\" he said; \"I did,  sir--spotted 'im, I did. Feeflee good at spottin', I am, sir. Dook of  Connaught, he used to say, ''Ere comes Sergeant Collard,' 'e used to  say, ''e's feeflee good at spottin'.'\"    \"What did you do?\"    \"Do? Oo-oo-oo! I shouts 'Oo-oo-oo yer, yer young monkey, what yer doin'  there?'\"    \"Yes?\"    \"But 'e was off in a flash, and I doubles after 'im prompt.\"    \"But you didn't catch him?\"    \"No, sir,\" admitted the sergeant reluctantly.    \"Did you catch sight of his face, Sergeant?\"    \"No, sir, 'e was doublin' away in the opposite direction.\"    \"Did you notice anything at all about his appearance?\"    \"'E was a long young chap, sir, with a pair of legs on him--feeflee fast  'e run, sir. Oo-oo-oo, feeflee!\"    \"You noticed nothing else?\"    \"'E wasn't wearing no cap of any sort, sir.\"    \"Ah!\"    \"Bare'eaded, sir,\" added the sergeant, rubbing the point in.    \"It was undoubtedly the same boy, undoubtedly! I wish you could have  caught a glimpse of his face, Sergeant.\"    \"So do I, sir.\"    \"You would not be able to recognize him again if you saw him, you  think?\"    \"Oo-oo-oo! Wouldn't go as far as to say that, sir, 'cos yer see, I'm  feeflee good at spottin', but it was a dark night.\"    Mr. Downing rose to go.    \"Well,\" he said, \"the search is now considerably narrowed down,  considerably! It is certain that the boy was one of the boys in Mr.  Outwood's house.\"    \"Young monkeys!\" interjected the sergeant helpfully    \"Good afternoon, Sergeant.\"    \"Good afternoon to you, sir.\"    \"Pray do not move, Sergeant.\"    The sergeant had not shown the slightest inclination of doing anything  of the kind.    \"I will find my way out. Very hot today, is it not?\"    \"Feeflee warm, sir; weather's goin' to break' workin' up for thunder.\"    \"I hope not. The school plays the M.C.C. on Wednesday, and it would be a  pity if rain were to spoil our first fixture with them. Good afternoon.\"    And Mr. Downing went out into the baking sunlight, while Sergeant  Collard, having requested Mrs. Collard to take the children out for a  walk at once, and furthermore to give young Ernie a clip side of the  'ead, if he persisted in making so much noise, put a handkerchief over  his face, rested his feet on the table, and slept the sleep of the just.        19    THE SLEUTH-HOUND      For the Doctor Watsons of this world, as opposed to the Sherlock  Holmeses, success in the province of detective work must be, to a very  large extent, the result of luck. Sherlock Holmes can extract a clue  from a wisp of straw or a flake of cigar ash. But Doctor Watson has got  to have it taken out for him, and dusted, and exhibited clearly, with a  label attached.    The average man is a Doctor Watson. We are wont to scoff in a  patronizing manner at that humbler follower of the great investigator,  but, as a matter of fact, we should have been just as dull ourselves. We  should not even have risen to the modest level of a Scotland Yard  bungler. We should simply have hung around, saying: \"My dear Holmes,  how...?\" and all the rest of it, just as the downtrodden medico did.    It is not often that the ordinary person has any need to see what he can  do in the way of detection. He gets along very comfortably in the  humdrum round of life without having to measure footprints and smile  quiet, tight-lipped smiles. But if ever the emergency does arise, he  thinks naturally of Sherlock Holmes, and his methods.    Mr. Downing had read all the Holmes stories with great attention, and  had thought many times what an incompetent ass Doctor Watson was; but,  now that he had started to handle his own first case, he was compelled  to admit that there was a good deal to be said in extenuation of  Watson's inability to unravel tangles. It certainly was uncommonly hard,  he thought, as he paced the cricket field after leaving Sergeant  Collard, to detect anybody, unless you knew who had really done the  crime. As he brooded over the case in hand, his sympathy for Doctor  Watson increased with every minute, and he began to feel a certain  resentment against Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It was all very well for Sir  Arthur to be so shrewd and infallible about tracing a mystery to its  source, but he knew perfectly well who had done the thing before  he started!    Now that he began really to look into this matter of the alarm bell and  the painting of Sammy, the conviction was creeping over him that the  problem was more difficult than a casual observer might imagine. He had  got as far as finding that his quarry of the previous night was a boy in  Mr. Outwood's house, but how was he to get any further? That was the  thing. There was, of course, only a limited number of boys in Mr.  Outwood's house as tall as the one he had pursued; but even if there had  been only one other, it would have complicated matters. If you go to a  boy and say, \"Either you or Jones were out of your house last night at  twelve o'clock,\" the boy does not reply, \"Sir, I cannot tell a lie--I  was out of my house last night at twelve o'clock.\" He simply assumes the  animated expression of a stuffed fish, and leaves the next move to you.  It is practically stalemate.    All these things passed through Mr. Downing's mind as he walked up and  down the cricket field that afternoon.    What he wanted was a clue. But it is so hard for the novice to tell what  is a clue and what isn't. Probably, if he only knew, there were clues  lying all over the place, shouting to him to pick them up.    What with the oppressive heat of the day and the fatigue of hard  thinking, Mr. Downing was working up for a brainstorm when Fate once  more intervened, this time in the shape of Riglett, a junior member of  his house.    Riglett slunk up in the shamefaced way peculiar to some boys, even when  they have done nothing wrong, and, having \"capped\" Mr. Downing with the  air of one who had been caught in the act of doing something  particularly shady, requested that he might be allowed to fetch his  bicycle from the shed.    \"Your bicycle?\" snapped Mr. Downing. Much thinking had made him  irritable. \"What do you want with your bicycle?\"    Riglett shuffled, stood first on his left foot, then on his right,  blushed, and finally remarked, as if it were not so much a sound reason  as a sort of feeble excuse for the low and blackguardly fact that he  wanted his bicycle, that he had got leave for tea that afternoon.    Then Mr. Downing remembered. Riglett had an aunt resident about three  miles from the school, whom he was accustomed to visit occasionally on  Sunday afternoons during the term.    He felt for his bunch of keys, and made his way to the shed, Riglett  shambling behind at an interval of two yards.    Mr. Downing unlocked the door, and there on the floor was the Clue!    A clue that even Doctor Watson could not have overlooked.    Mr. Downing saw it, but did not immediately recognize it for what it  was. What he saw at first was not a clue, but just a mess. He had a tidy  soul and abhorred messes. And this was a particularly messy mess. The  greater part of the flooring in the neighborhood of the door was a sea  of red paint. The tin from which it had flowed was lying on its side in  the middle of the shed. The air was full of the pungent scent.    \"Pah!\" said Mr. Downing.    Then suddenly, beneath the disguise of the mess, he saw the clue. A  footmark! No less. A crimson footmark on the gray concrete!    Riglett, who had been waiting patiently two yards away, now coughed  plaintively. The sound recalled Mr. Downing to mundane matters.    \"Get your bicycle, Riglett,\" he said, \"and be careful where you tread.  Somebody has upset a pot of paint on the floor.\"    Riglett, walking delicately through dry places, extracted his bicycle  from the rack, and presently departed to gladden the heart of his aunt,  leaving Mr. Downing, his brain fizzing with the enthusiasm of the  detective, to lock the door and resume his perambulation of the  cricket field.    Give Doctor Watson a fair start, and he is a demon at the game. Mr.  Downing's brain was now working with a rapidity and clearness which a  professional sleuth might have envied.    Paint. Red paint. Obviously the same paint with which Sammy had been  decorated. A footmark. Whose footmark? Plainly that of the criminal who  had done the deed of decoration.    Yoicks!    There were two things, however, to be considered. Your careful detective  must consider everything. In the first place, the paint might have been  upset by the groundsman. It was the groundsman's paint. He had been  giving a fresh coating to the woodwork in front of the pavilion scoring  box at the conclusion of yesterday's match. (A labor of love which was  the direct outcome of the enthusiasm for work which Adair had instilled  into him.) In that case the footmark might be his.

Mr. Dryden in his dedication  of Juvenal, thus proceeds: The English have only to boast of Spenser  and Milton in heroic poetry, who neither of them wanted either genius  or learning to have been perfect poets, and yet both of them are  liable to many censures; for there is no uniformity in the design of  Spenser; he aims at the accomplishment of no one action; he raises up  a hero for every one of his adventures, and endows each of them with  some particular moral virtue, which renders them all equal, without  subordination or preference: Every one is valiant in his own legend;  only we must do him the justice to observe, that magnanimity, which is  the character of prince Arthur, shines throughout the whole poem, and  succours the rest when they are in distress. The original of every  knight was then living in the court of Queen Elizabeth; and he  attributed to each of them that virtue which he thought was most  conspicuous in them; an ingenious piece of flattery, tho' it turned  not much to his account. Had he lived to finish his poem in the  remaining legends, it had certainly been more of a piece; but could  not have been perfect because the model was not true. But prince  Arthur, or his chief patron Sir Philip Sidney, dying before him,  deprived the poet both of means and spirit to accomplish his design.  For the rest, his obsolete language, and ill choice of his stanza, are  faults both of the second magnitude; for notwithstanding the first, he  is still intelligible, at least after a little practice, and for  the last he is more to be admired, that labouring under such  disadvantages, his verses are so numerous, so various, and so  harmonious, that only Virgil, whom he has professedly imitated, has  surpassed him among the Romans, and only Waller among the English.\"    Mr. Hughes in his essay on allegorical poetry prefixed to Spenser's  works, tells us, that this poem is conceived, wrought up, and coloured  with stronger fancy, and discovers more the particular genius of  Spenser, than any of his other writings; and having observed that  Spenser in a letter to Sir Walter Raleigh calls it, a continued  allegory, or dark conceit, he gives us some remarks on allegorical  poetry in general, defining allegory to be a fable or story, in which,  under imaginary persons or things, is shadowed some real action or  instructive moral, or as I think, says he, it is somewhere very  shortly defined by. Plutarch; it is that, in which one thing is,  related, and another thing understood; it is a kind of poetical  picture, or hieroglyphick, which by its apt resemblance, conveys  instruction to the mind, by an analogy to the senses, and so amuses  the fancy while it informs the understanding. Every allegory has  therefore two senses, the literal and mystical, the literal sense  is like a dream or vision, of which the mystical sense is the true  meaning, or interpretation. This will be more clearly apprehended  by considering, that as a simile is a more extended metaphor, so  an allegory is a kind of continued simile, or an assemblage of  similitudes drawn out at full length.    The chief merit of this poem, no doubt, consists in that surprising  vein of fabulous invention, which runs through it, and enriches it  every where with imagery and descriptions, more than we meet with in  any other modern poem. The author seems to be possessed of a kind of  poetical magic, and the figures he calls up to our view rise so  thick upon us, that we are at once pleased and distracted with the  exhaustless variety of them; so that his faults may in a manner be  imputed to his excellencies. His abundance betrays him into excess,  and his judgment is over-born by the torrent of his imagination. That  which seems the most liable to exception in this work is the model of  it, and the choice the author has made of so romantic a story. The  several books rather appear like so many several poems, than one  entire fable. Each of them has its peculiar knight, and is independent  of the rest; and tho' some of the persons make their appearance in  different books, yet this has very little effect in concealing them.  Prince Arthur is indeed the principal person, and has therefore a  share given him in every legend; but his part is not considerable  enough in any one of them. He appears and vanishes again like a  spirit, and we lose sight of him too soon to consider him as the hero  of the poem. These are the most obvious defects in the fable of the  Fairy Queen. The want of unity in the story makes it difficult for the  reader to carry it in his mind, and distracts too much his attention  to the several parts of it; and indeed the whole frame of it would  appear monstrous, were it to be examined by the rules of epic poetry,  as they have been drawn from the practice of Homer and Virgil; but as  it is plain, the author never designed it by these rules, I think it  ought rather to be called a poem of a particular kind, describing in a  series of allegorical adventures, or episodes, the most noted virtues  and vices. To compare it therefore with the models of antiquity, would  be like drawing a parallel between the Roman and Gothic architecture.  In the first, there is doubtless a more natural grandeur and  simplicity; in the latter, we find great mixtures of beauty and  barbarism, yet assisted by the invention of a variety of inferior  ornaments; and tho' the former is more majestic in the whole, the  latter may be very surprizing and agreeable in its parts.      [Footnote 1: Hughes's Life of Spencer, prefixed to the edition of our  author's works.]    [Footnote 2: Hughes ubi supra,]    [Footnote 3: Winst. p. 88.]    [Footnote 4: Dublin]    [Footnote 5: The General of the English army in Ireland.]           *       *       *       *       *      JASPER HEYWOOD,    the son of the celebrated epigramatist, was born in London, and in the  12th year of his age, 1517, was sent to the University, where he was  educated in grammar and logic. In 1553 he took a degree in Arts, and  was immediately elected Probationer fellow of Merton College, where he  gained a superiority over all his fellow students in disputations at  the public school. Wood informs us, that upon a third admonition, from  the warden and society of that house, he resigned his fellowship, to  prevent expulsion, on the 4th of April, 1558; he had been guilty of  several misdemeanors, such as are peculiar to youth, wildness and  rakishness, which in those days it seems were very severely punished.  Soon after this he quitted England, and entered himself into the  society of Jesus at St. Omer's [1]; but before he left his native  country, he writ and translated (says Wood), these things following.    Various Poems and Devices; some of which are printed in a book called  the Paradise of Dainty Devices, 1574, 4to.    Hercules Furens, a Tragedy, which some have imputed to Seneca, and  others have denied to be his, but it is thought by most learned men to  be an imitation of that play of Euripides, which bears the same name,  and tho, in contrivance and economy, they differ in some things, yet  in others they agree, and Scaliger scruples not to prefer the Latin to  the Greek Tragedy [2].    Troas, a Tragedy of Seneca's, which the learned Farnaby, and Daniel  Heinsius very much commend; the former stiling it a divine tragedy,  the other preferring it to one of the same name by Euripides, both in  language and contrivance, but especially he says it far exceeds it in  the chorus. In this tragedy the author has taken the liberty of adding  several things, and altering others, as thinking the play imperfect:  First as to the additions, he has at the end of the chorus after  the first act, added threescore verses of his own invention: In the  beginning of the second act he has added a whole scene, where he  introduces the ghost of Achilles rising from hell, to require the  sacrifice of Polyxena! to the chorus of this act he added three  stanza's. As to his alterations, instead of translating the chorus  of the third act, which is wholly taken up with the names of foreign  countries, the translation of which without notes he thought would  be tiresome to the English reader, he has substituted in its stead  another chorus of his own invention. This tragedy runs in verses of  fourteen syllables, and for the most part his chorus is writ in verse  of ten syllables, which is called heroic.    Thyestes, another tragedy of Seneca's, which in the judgment of  Hiensius, is not inferior to any other of his dramatic pieces. Our  author translated this play when he was at Oxford; it is wrote in  the same manner of verse as the other, only the chorus is written in  alternate rhime. The translator has added a scene at the end of the  fifth act, spoken by Thyestes alone; in which he bewails his misery,  and implores Heaven's vengeance on Atreus. These plays are printed in  a black letter in 4to. 1581.    Langbain observes, that tho' he cannot much commend the version of  Heywood, as poetically elegant, as he has chosen a measure of fourteen  syllables, which ever sounds harsh to the ears of those that are used  to heroic poetry, yet, says he, I must do the author this justice, to  acquaint the world, that he endeavours to give Seneca's sense, and  likewise to imitate his verse, changing his measure, as often as his  author, the chorus of each act being different from the act itself, as  the reader may observe, by comparing the English copy with the Latin  original.    After our author had spent two years in the study of divinity amongst  the priests, he was sent to Diling in Switzerland, where he continued  about seventeen years, in explaining and discussing controverted  questions, among those he called Heretics, in which time, for his zeal  for the holy mother, he was promoted to the degree of Dr. of Divinity,  and of the Four Vows.
