THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS    With Drawings by L. Leslie Brooke                [Illustration]          THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.      Once upon a time there was an old Sow with three little Pigs,  and as she had not enough to keep them, she sent them out to seek their  fortune.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    The first that went off met a Man with a bundle of straw, and said to  him, \"Please, Man, give me that straw to build me a house\"; which the  Man did, and the little Pig built a house with it. Presently came along  a Wolf, and knocked at the door, and said, \"Little Pig, little Pig, let  me come in.\"    To which the Pig answered, \"No, no, by the hair of my chinny chin chin.\"    [Illustration]    \"Then I'll huff and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house  in!\" said the Wolf. So he huffed and he puffed, and he blew his house  in, and ate up the little Pig.    The second Pig met a Man with a bundle of furze, and said, \"Please, Man,  give me that furze to build a house\"; which the Man did, and the Pig  built his house.    [Illustration]    Then along came the Wolf and said, \"Little Pig, little Pig, let me come  in.\"    \"No, no, by the hair of my chinny chin chin.\"    \"Then I'll puff and I'll huff, and I'll blow your house in!\" So he  huffed and he puffed, and he puffed and he huffed, and at last he blew  the house down, and ate up the second little Pig.    [Illustration]    The third little Pig met a Man with a load of bricks, and said, \"Please,  Man, give me those bricks to build a house with\"; so the Man gave him  the bricks, and he built his house with them. So the Wolf came, as he  did to the other little Pigs, and said, \"Little Pig, little Pig, let me  come in.\"    \"No, no, by the hair of my chinny chin chin.\"    \"Then I'll huff and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in.\"    Well, he huffed and he puffed, and he huffed and he puffed, and he  puffed and he huffed; but he could _not_ get the house down. When he  found that he could not, with all his huffing and puffing, blow the  house down, he said, \"Little Pig, I know where there is a nice field of  turnips.\"    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    \"Where?\" said the little Pig.    \"Oh, in Mr. Smith's home-field; and if you will be ready to-morrow  morning, I will call for you, and we will go together and get some for  dinner.\"    \"Very well,\" said the little Pig, \"I will be ready. What time do you  mean to go?\"    \"Oh, at six o'clock.\"    [Illustration]    Well, the little Pig got up at five, and got the turnips and was home  again before six. When the Wolf came he said, \"Little Pig, are you  ready?\"    \"Ready!\" said the little Pig, \"I have been and come back again, and got  a nice pot-full for dinner.\"    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    The Wolf felt very angry at this, but thought that he would be _up to_  the little Pig somehow or other; so he said, \"Little Pig, I know where  there is a nice apple-tree.\"    \"Where?\" said the Pig.    \"Down at Merry-garden,\" replied the Wolf; \"and if you will not deceive  me I will come for you, at five o'clock to-morrow, and we will go  together and get some apples.\"    [Illustration]    Well, the little Pig woke at four the next morning, and bustled up, and  went off for the apples, hoping to get back before the Wolf came; but  he had farther to go, and had to climb the tree, so that just as he was  coming down from it, he saw the Wolf coming, which, as you may suppose,  frightened him very much. When the Wolf came up he said, \"Little Pig,  what! are you here before me? Are they nice apples?\"    [Illustration]    \"Yes, very,\" said the little Pig; \"I will throw you down one.\" And he  threw it so far that, while the Wolf was gone to pick it up, the  little Pig jumped down and ran home.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    The next day the Wolf came again, and said to the little Pig, \"Little  Pig, there is a Fair in the Town this afternoon: will you go?\"    \"Oh, yes,\" said the Pig, \"I will go; what time shall you be ready?\"    \"At three,\" said the Wolf.    [Illustration]    So the little Pig went off before the time, as usual, and got to the  Fair, and bought a butter churn, and was on his way home with it when he  saw the Wolf coming. Then he could not tell what to do. So he got into  the churn to hide, and in doing so turned it round, and it began to  roll, and rolled down the hill with the Pig inside it, which frightened  the Wolf so much that he ran home without going to the Fair.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    He went to the little Pig's house, and told him how frightened he had  been by a great round thing which came down the hill past him.    Then the little Pig said, \"Hah! I frightened you, did I? I had been to  the Fair and bought a butter churn, and when I saw you I got into it,  and rolled down the hill.\"    [Illustration]    Then the Wolf was very angry indeed, and declared he _would_ eat up the  little Pig, and that he would get down the chimney after him.    [Illustration]    When the little Pig saw what he was about, he hung on the pot full of  water, and made up a blazing fire, and, just as the Wolf was coming  down, took off the cover of the pot, and in fell the Wolf. And the  little Pig put on the cover again in an instant, boiled him up, and ate  him for supper, and lived happy ever after.

She spent almost all of her time  walking about the barnyard in her picketty-pecketty fashion,  scratching everywhere for worms.    [Illustration: ]    [Illustration: ]    She dearly loved fat, delicious worms and felt they were absolutely  necessary to the health of her children. As often as she found a worm  she would call \"Chuck-chuck-chuck!\" to her chickies.    [Illustration: ]    [Illustration: ]    When they were gathered about her, she would distribute choice morsels  of her tid-bit. A busy little body was she!    [Illustration: ]    A cat usually napped lazily in the barn door, not even bothering  herself to scare the rat who ran here and there as he pleased. And as  for the pig who lived in the sty--he did not care what happened so  long as he could eat and grow fat.    [Illustration: ]    One day the Little Red Hen found a Seed. It was a Wheat Seed, but the  Little Red Hen was so accustomed to bugs and worms that she supposed  this to be some new and perhaps very delicious kind of meat. She bit  it gently and found that it resembled a worm in no way whatsoever as  to taste although because it was long and slender, a Little Red Hen  might easily be fooled by its appearance.    [Illustration: ]    [Illustration: ]    [Illustration: ]    Carrying it about, she made many inquiries as to what it might be. She  found it was a Wheat Seed and that, if planted, it would grow up and  when ripe it could be made into flour and then into bread.    [Illustration: ]    When she discovered that, she knew it ought to be planted. She was so  busy hunting food for herself and her family that, naturally, she  thought she ought not to take time to plant it.    [Illustration: ]    [Illustration: ]    So she thought of the Pig--upon whom time must hang heavily and of the  Cat who had nothing to do, and of the great fat Rat with his idle  hours, and she called loudly:    [Illustration: ]    \"Who will plant the Seed?\"    [Illustration: ]    But the Pig said, \"Not I,\" and the Cat said, \"Not I,\" and the Rat  said, \"Not I.\"    [Illustration]    \"Well, then,\" said the Little Red Hen, \"I will.\"    And she did.    [Illustration: ]    [Illustration: ]    Then she went on with her daily duties through the long summer days,  scratching for worms and feeding her chicks, while the Pig grew fat,  and the Cat grew fat, and the Rat grew fat, and the Wheat grew tall  and ready for harvest.    [Illustration: ]    [Illustration: ]    So one day the Little Red Hen chanced to notice how large the Wheat  was and that the grain was ripe, so she ran about calling briskly:  \"Who will cut the Wheat?\"    The Pig said, \"Not I,\" the Cat said, \"Not I,\" and the Rat said, \"Not  I.\"    [Illustration: ]    \"Well, then,\" said the Little Red Hen, \"I will.\"    And she did.    [Illustration: ]    She got the sickle from among the farmer's tools in the barn and  proceeded to cut off all of the big plant of Wheat.    On the ground lay the nicely cut Wheat, ready to be gathered and  threshed, but the newest and yellowest and downiest of Mrs. Hen's  chicks set up a \"peep-peep-peeping\" in their most vigorous fashion,  proclaiming to the world at large, but most particularly to their  mother, that she was neglecting them.    [Illustration: ]    [Illustration: ]    Poor Little Red Hen! She felt quite bewildered and hardly knew where  to turn.    Her attention was sorely divided between her duty to her children and  her duty to the Wheat, for which she felt responsible.    So, again, in a very hopeful tone, she called out, \"Who will thresh  the Wheat?\"    But the Pig, with a grunt, said, \"Not I,\"  and the Cat, with a meow, said, \"Not I,\" and  the Rat, with a squeak, said, \"Not I.\"    So the Little Red Hen, looking, it must be admitted, rather  discouraged, said, \"Well, I will, then.\"    And she did.    Of course, she had to feed her babies first, though, and when she had  gotten them all to sleep for their afternoon nap, she went out and  threshed the Wheat. Then she called out: \"Who will carry the Wheat to  the mill to be ground?\"    [Illustration: ]    Turning their backs with snippy glee,  that Pig said, \"Not I,\"    [Illustration: ]    [Illustration: ]    [Illustration: ]    [Illustration: ]    and that Cat said, \"Not I,\" and that Rat said, \"Not I.\"    [Illustration]    So the good Little Red Hen could do nothing but say, \"I will then.\"  And she did.    Carrying the sack of Wheat, she trudged off to the distant mill. There  she ordered the Wheat ground into beautiful white flour. When the  miller brought her the flour she walked slowly back all the way to her  own barnyard in her own picketty-pecketty fashion.    [Illustration: ]    [Illustration: ]    [Illustration: ]    She even managed, in spite of her load, to catch a nice juicy worm now  and then and had one left for the babies when she reached them. Those  cunning little fluff-balls were _so_ glad to see their mother. For the  first time, they really appreciated her.    [Illustration: ]    [Illustration:]    After this really strenuous day Mrs. Hen retired to her slumbers  earlier than usual--indeed, before the colors came into the sky to  herald the setting of the sun, her usual bedtime hour.    She would have liked to sleep late in the morning, but her chicks,  joining in the morning chorus of the hen yard, drove away all hopes of  such a luxury.    Even as she sleepily half opened one eye, the thought came to her that  to-day that Wheat must, somehow, be made into bread.    [Illustration]    She was not in the habit of making bread, although, of course, anyone  can make it if he or she follows the recipe with care, and she knew  perfectly well that she could do it if necessary.    So after her children were fed and made sweet and fresh for the day,  she hunted up the Pig, the Cat and the Rat.    [Illustration]    Still confident that they would surely help her some day she sang out,  \"Who will make the bread?\"    [Illustration: ]    Alas for the Little Red Hen! Once more her hopes were dashed! For the  Pig said, \"Not I,\"    [Illustration: ]    the Cat said, \"Not I,\" and the Rat said, \"Not I.\"    [Illustration: ]    [Illustration: ]    So the Little Red Hen said once more, \"I will then,\" and she did.    Feeling that she might have known all the time that she would have to  do it all herself, she went and put on a fresh apron and spotless  cook's cap. First of all she set the dough, as was proper. When it was  time she brought out the moulding board and the baking tins, moulded  the bread, divided it into loaves, and put them into the oven to bake.  All the while the Cat sat lazily by, giggling and chuckling.    [Illustration: ]    And close at hand the vain Rat powdered his nose and admired himself  in a mirror.    [Illustration]    In the distance could be heard the long-drawn snores of the dozing  Pig.    [Illustration: ]    At last the great moment arrived. A delicious odor was wafted upon the  autumn breeze. Everywhere the barnyard citizens sniffed the air with  delight.    [Illustration: ]    [Illustration: ]    The Red Hen ambled in her picketty-pecketty way toward the source of  all this excitement.    [Illustration: ]    Although she appeared to be perfectly calm, in reality she could only  with difficulty restrain an impulse to dance and sing, for had she not  done all the work on this wonderful bread?    [Illustration: ]    [Illustration: ]    Small wonder that she was the most excited person in the barnyard!    She did not know whether the bread would be fit to eat, but--joy of  joys!--when the lovely brown loaves came out of the oven, they were  done to perfection.    [Illustration: ]    Then, probably because she had acquired the habit, the Red Hen called:  \"Who will eat the Bread?\"    [Illustration: ]    All the animals in the barnyard were watching hungrily and smacking  their lips in anticipation, and the Pig said, \"I will,\" the Cat said,  \"I will,\" the Rat said, \"I will.\"    But the Little Red Hen said,    [Illustration:]    [Illustration:]    \"No, you won't. I will.\"    And she did.
