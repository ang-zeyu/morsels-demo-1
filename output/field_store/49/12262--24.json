I have successively  passed over the three regions that succeed each other from north to  south; from the Mediterranean of the West Indies to the forests of the  Upper Orinoco and of the Amazon. The fertile land of the shore, the  centre of agricultural riches, is succeeded by the Llanos, inhabited  by pastoral tribes. These Llanos are in their turn bordered by the  region of forests, the inhabitants of which enjoy, I will not say  liberty, which is always the result of civilization, but a sort of  savage independence. On the limit of these two latter zones the  struggle now exists which will decide the emancipation and future  prosperity of America. The changes which are preparing cannot efface  the individual character of each region; but the manners and condition  of the inhabitants will assume a more uniform colour. This  consideration perhaps adds interest to a tour made in the beginning of  the nineteenth century. We like to see, traced in the same picture,  the civilized nations of the sea-shore, and the feeble remains of the  natives of the Orinoco, who know no other worship than that of the  powers of nature; and who, like the ancient Germans, deify the  mysterious object which excites their simple admiration.* (* Deorum  nominibus appellant secretum illud, quod sola reverentia vident.  Tacitus Germania 9.)      CHAPTER 3.26.    THE LLANOS DEL PAO, OR EASTERN PART OF THE PLAINS OF VENEZUELA.  MISSIONS OF THE CARIBS.  LAST VISIT TO THE COAST OF NUEVA BARCELONA, CUMANA, AND ARAYA.    Night had set in when we crossed for the last time the bed of the  Orinoco. We purposed to rest near the little fort San Rafael, and on  the following morning at daybreak to set out on our journey through  the plains of Venezuela. Nearly six weeks had elapsed since our  arrival at Angostura; and we earnestly wished to reach the coast, with  the view of finding, at Cumana, or at Nueva Barcelona, a vessel in  which we might embark for the island of Cuba, thence to proceed to  Mexico. After the sufferings to which we had been exposed during  several months, whilst sailing in small boats on rivers infested by  mosquitos, the idea of a sea voyage was not without its charms. We had  no idea of ever again returning to South America. Sacrificing the  Andes of Peru to the Archipelago of the Philippines (of which so  little is known), we adhered to our old plan of remaining a year in  New Spain, then proceeding in a galleon from Acapulco to Manila, and  returning to Europe by way of Bassora and Aleppo. We imagined that,  when we had once left the Spanish possessions in America, the fall of  that ministry which had procured for us so many advantages, could not  be prejudicial to the execution of our enterprise.    Our mules were in waiting for us on the left bank of the Orinoco. The  collection of plants, and the different geological series which we had  brought from the Esmeralda and Rio Negro, had greatly augmented our  baggage; and, as it would have been dangerous to lose sight of our  herbals, we expected to make a very slow journey across the Llanos.  The heat was excessive, owing to the reverberation of the soil, which  was almost everywhere destitute of vegetation; yet the centigrade  thermometer during the day (in the shade) was only from thirty to  thirty-four degrees, and during the night, from twenty-seven to  twenty-eight degrees. Here, therefore, as almost everywhere within the  tropics, it was less the absolute degree of heat than its duration  that affected our sensations. We spent thirteen days in crossing the  plains, resting a little in the Caribbee (Caraibes) missions and in  the little town of Pao. The eastern part of the Llanos through which  we passed, between Angostura and Nueva Barcelona, presents the same  wild aspect as the western part, through which we had passed from the  valleys of Aragua to San Fernando de Apure. In the season of drought,  (which is here called summer,) though the sun is in the southern  hemisphere, the breeze is felt with greater force in the Llanos of  Cumana, than in those of Caracas; because those vast plains, like the  cultivated fields of Lombardy, form an inland basin, open to the east,  and closed on the north, south and west by high chains of primitive  mountains. Unfortunately, we could not avail ourselves of this  refreshing breeze, of which the Llaneros, or the inhabitants of the  plains, speak with rapture. It was now the rainy season north of the  equator; and though it did not rain in the plains, the change in the  declination of the sun had for some time caused the action of the  polar currents to cease. In the equatorial regions, where the  traveller may direct his course by observing the direction of the  clouds, and where the oscillations of the mercury in the barometer  indicate the hour almost as well as a clock, everything is subject to  a regular and uniform rule. The cessation of the breezes, the  setting-in of the rainy season, and the frequency of electric  explosions, are phenomena which are found to be connected together by  immutable laws.    On entering the Llanos of Nueva Barcelona, we met with a Frenchman, at  whose house we passed the first night, and who received us with the  kindest hospitality. He was a native of Lyons, and he had left his  country at a very early age. He appeared extremely indifferent to all  that was passing beyond the Atlantic, or, as they say here,  disdainfully enough, when speaking of Europe, on the other side of the  great pool (al otro lado del charco). Our host was employed in joining  large pieces of wood by means of a kind of glue called guayca. This  substance, which is used by the carpenters of Angostura, resembles the  best animal glue. It is found perfectly prepared between the bark and  the alburnum of a creeper* of the family of the Combretaceae. (*  Combretum guayca.) It probably resembles in its chemical properties  birdlime, the vegetable principle obtained from the berries of the  mistletoe, and the internal bark of the holly. An astonishing  abundance of this glutinous matter issues from the twining branches of  the vejuco de guayca when they are cut. Thus we find within the  tropics a substance in a state of purity and deposited in peculiar  organs, which in the temperate zone can be procured only by artificial  means.    We did not arrive until the third day at the Caribbee missions of  Cari. We observed that the ground was less cracked by the drought in  this country than in the Llanos of Calabozo. Some showers had revived  the vegetation. Small gramina and especially those herbaceous  sensitive-plants so useful in fattening half-wild cattle, formed a  thick turf. At great distances one from another, there arose a few  fan-palms (Corypha tectorum), rhopalas* (chaparro (* The Proteaceae  are not, like the Araucaria, an exclusively southern form. We found  the Rhopala complicata and the R. obovata, in 2 degrees 30 minutes,  and in 10 degrees of north latitude.)), and malpighias* with  coriaceous and glossy leaves. (* A neighbouring genus, Byrsonima  cocollobaefolia, B. laurifolia, near Matagorda, and B. ropalaefolia.)  The humid spots are recognized at a distance by groups of mauritia,  which are the sago-trees of those countries. Near the coast this  palm-tree constitutes the whole wealth of the Guaraon Indians; and it  is somewhat remarkable that we also found it one hundred and sixty  leagues farther south, in the midst of the forests of the Upper  Orinoco, in the savannahs that surround the granitic peak of Duida.*  (* The moriche, like the Sagus Rumphii, is a palm-tree of the marshes,  not a palm-tree of the coast, like the Chamaerops humilis, the common  cocoa-tree, and the lodoicea.) It was loaded at this season with  enormous clusters of red fruit, resembling fir-cones. Our monkeys were  extremely fond of this fruit, which has the taste of an over-ripe  apple. The monkeys were placed with our baggage on the backs of the  mules, and they made great efforts to reach the clusters that hung  over their heads. The plain was undulating from the effects of the  mirage; and when, after travelling for an hour, we reached the trunks  of the palm-trees, which appeared like masts in the horizon, we  observed with astonishment how many things are connected with the  existence of a single plant. The winds, losing their velocity when in  contact with the foliage and the branches, accumulate sand around the  trunk. The smell of the fruit and the brightness of the verdure  attract from afar the birds of passage, which love to perch on the  slender, arrow-like branches of the palm-tree. A soft murmuring is  heard around; and overpowered by the heat, and accustomed to the  melancholy silence of the plains, the traveller imagines he enjoys  some degree of coolness on hearing the slightest sound of the foliage.  If we examine the soil on the side opposite to the wind, we find it  remains humid long after the rainy season. Insects and worms,  everywhere else so rare in the Llanos, here assemble and multiply.  This one solitary and often stunted tree, which would not claim the  notice of the traveller amid the forests of the Orinoco, spreads life  around it in the desert.    On the 13th of July we arrived at the village of Cari, the first of  the Caribbee missions that are under the Observantin monks of the  college of Piritu. We lodged as usual at the convent, that is, with  the clergyman. Our host could scarcely comprehend how natives of the  north of Europe could arrive at his dwelling from the frontiers of  Brazil by the Rio Negro, and not by way of the coast of Cumana. He  behaved to us in the most affable manner, at the same time manifesting  that somewhat importunate curiosity which the appearance of a  stranger, not a Spaniard, always excites in South America. He"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7297"],[0,"The Vedanta-Sutras with the Commentary (#18)"],[1,"'Scripture is' is false, and hence the knowledge resting on  false Scripture being false likewise, the object of that knowledge, i.e.  Brahman itself, is false. If the cognition of fire which rests on mist  being mistaken for smoke is false, it follows that the object of that  cognition, viz. fire itself, is likewise unreal. Nor can it be shown  that (in the case of Brahman) there is no possibility of ulterior  sublative cognition; for there may be such sublative cognition, viz. the  one expressed in the judgment 'the Reality is a Void.' And if you say  that this latter judgment rests on error, we point out that according to  yourself the knowledge of Brahman is also based on error. And of our  judgment (viz. 'the Reality is a Void') it may truly be said that all  further negation is impossible.--But there is no need to continue this  demolition of an altogether baseless theory.    [FOOTNOTE 77:1. And those manifestations of sound by means of various  tones are themselves something real.]          No scriptural texts teach a Brahman devoid of all difference.    We now turn to the assertion that certain scriptural texts, as e.g.  'Being only was this in the beginning,' are meant to teach that there  truly exists only one homogeneous substance, viz. Intelligence free from  all difference.--This we cannot allow. For the section in which the  quoted text occurs, in order to make good the initial declaration that  by the knowledge of one thing all things are known, shows that the  highest Brahman which is denoted by the term 'Being' is the substantial  and also the operative cause of the world; that it is all-knowing,  endowed with all powers; that its purposes come true; that it is the  inward principle, the support and the ruler of everything; and that  distinguished by these and other good qualities it constitutes the Self  of the entire world; and then finally proceeds to instruct Svetaketu  that this Brahman constitutes his Self also ('Thou art that'). We have  fully set forth this point in the Vedârtha-samgraha and shall establish  it in greater detail in the present work also, in the so-called  ârambhana-adhikarana.--In the same way the passage 'the higher knowledge  is that by which the Indestructible is apprehended, &c.' (Mu. Up. I, 1,  5) first denies of Brahman all the evil qualities connected with Prakriti,  and then teaches that to it there belong eternity, all-pervadingness,  subtilty, omnipresence, omniscience, imperishableness, creativeness with  regard to all beings, and other auspicious qualities. Now we maintain  that also the text 'True, knowledge, infinite is Brahman', does not  prove a substance devoid of all difference, for the reason that the  co-ordination of the terms of which it consists explains itself in so  far only as denoting one thing distinguished by several attributes. For  'co-ordination' (sâmânâdhikaranya, lit.'the abiding of several things in  a common substrate') means the reference (of several terms) to one  thing, there being a difference of reason for the application (of  several terms to one thing). Now whether we take the several terms,'  True','Knowledge','Infinite', in their primary sense, i. e. as denoting  qualities, or as denoting modes of being opposed to whatever is contrary  to those qualities; in either case we must needs admit a plurality of  causes for the application of those several terms to one thing. There is  however that difference between the two alternatives that in the former  case the terms preserve their primary meaning, while in the latter case  their denotative power depends on so-called 'implication' (lakshanâ).  Nor can it be said that the opposition in nature to non-knowledge,  &c.(which is the purport of the terms on the hypothesis of lakshanâ),  constitutes nothing more than the essential nature (of one  non-differenced substance; the three terms thus having one purport  only); for as such essential nature would be sufficiently apprehended  through one term, the employment of further terms would be purposeless.  This view would moreover be in conflict with co-ordination, as it would  not allow of difference of motive for several terms applied to one  thing. On the other hand it cannot be urged against the former  alternative that the distinction of several attributes predicated of one  thing implies a distinction in the thing to which the attributes belong,  and that from this it follows that the several terms denote several  things--a result which also could not be reconciled with  'co-ordination'; for what 'co-ordination' aims at is just to convey the  idea of one thing being qualified by several attributes. For the  grammarians define 'coordination' as the application, to one thing, of  several words, for the application of each of which there is a different  motive.    You have further maintained the following view:--In the text 'one only  without a second', the phrase 'without a second' negatives all duality  on Brahman's part even in so far as qualities are concerned. We must  therefore, according to the principle that all Sâkhâs convey the same  doctrine, assume that all texts which speak of Brahman as cause, aim at  setting forth an absolutely non-dual substance. Of Brahman thus  indirectly defined as a cause, the text 'The True, knowledge, infinite  is Brahman,' contains a direct definition; the Brahman here meant to be  defined must thus be devoid of all qualities. Otherwise, moreover, the  text would be in conflict with those other texts which declare Brahman  to be without qualities and blemish.--But this also cannot be admitted.  What the phrase 'without a second' really aims at intimating is that  Brahman possesses manifold powers, and this it does by denying the  existence of another ruling principle different from Brahman. That  Brahman actually possesses manifold powers the text shows further on,  'It thought, may I be many, may I grow forth,' and 'it sent forth fire,'  and so on.--But how are we to know that the mere phrase 'without a  second' is meant to negative the existence of all other causes in  general?--As follows, we reply. The clause 'Being only this was in the  beginning, one only,' teaches that Brahman when about to create  constitutes the substantial cause of the world. Here the idea of some  further operative cause capable of giving rise to the effect naturally  presents itself to the mind, and hence we understand that the added  clause 'without a second' is meant to negative such an additional cause.  If it were meant absolutely to deny all duality, it would deny also the  eternity and other attributes of Brahman which you yourself assume. You  in this case make just the wrong use of the principle of all the--Sâkhâs  containing the same doctrine; what this principle demands is that the  qualities attributed in all--Sâkhâs to Brahman as cause should be taken  over into the passage under discussion also. The same consideration  teaches us that also the text 'True, knowledge', &c., teaches Brahman to  possess attributes; for this passage has to be interpreted in agreement  with the texts referring to Brahman as a cause. Nor does this imply a  conflict with the texts which declare Brahman to be without qualities;  for those texts are meant to negative the evil qualities depending on  Prakriti.--Those texts again which refer to mere knowledge declare  indeed that knowledge is the essential nature of Brahman, but this does  not mean that mere knowledge constitutes the fundamental reality. For  knowledge constitutes the essential nature of a knowing subject only  which is the substrate of knowledge, in the same way as the sun, lamps,  and gems are the substrate of Light. That Brahman is a knowing subject  all scriptural texts declare; cp. 'He who is all knowing' (Mu. Up. I, 1,  9); 'It thought' (Ch. Up. VI, 2, 3); 'This divine being thought' (Ch. Up.  VI, 3, 2); 'He thought, let me send forth the worlds' (Ait. Âr. II,4, 1,  2); 'He who arranges the wishes--as eternal of those who are not eternal,  as thinker of (other) thinkers, as one of many' (Ka. Up. II, 5, 13);  'There are two unborn ones--one who knows, one who does not know--one  strong, the other weak' (Svet. Up. I, 9); 'Let us know Him, the highest  of Lords, the great Lord, the highest deity of deities, the master of  masters, the highest above the god, the lord of the world, the adorable  one' (Svet. Up. VI, 7); 'Of him there is known no effect (body) or  instrument; no one is seen like unto him or better; his high power is  revealed as manifold, forming his essential nature, as knowledge,  strength, and action' (Svet. Up. VI, 8); 'That is the Self, free from  sin, ageless, deathless, griefless, free from hunger and thirst, whose  wishes are true, whose purposes are true' (Ch. Up. VIII, 1, 5). These  and other texts declare that to Brahman, whose essential nature is  knowledge, there belong many excellent qualities--among which that of  being a knowing subject stands first, and that Brahman is free from all  evil qualities. That the texts referring to Brahman as free from  qualities, and those which speak of it as possessing qualities, have  really one and the same object may be inferred from the last of the  passages quoted above; the earlier part of which--'free from sin,' up to  'free from thirst'--denies of Brahman all evil qualities, while its  latter part--'whose wishes are true,' and so on--asserts of its certain  excellent qualities. As thus there is no contradiction between the two  classes of texts, there is no reason whatever to assume that either of  them has for its object something that is false.--With regard to the  concluding passage of the Taittiriya-text, 'from whence all speech,  together with the mind, turns away, unable to reach it [FOOTNOTE 82:1],'  we point out that with the passage 'From terror of it the wind blows,'  there begins a declaration of the qualities of Brahman, and that the  next section 'one hundred times that"]]]
