Influenced by these  things, they do not discharge Viridovix and the other leaders from the  council, before they gained permission from them to take up arms and  hasten to [our] camp; which being granted, rejoicing as if victory were  fully certain, they collected faggots and brushwood, with which to fill  up the Roman trenches, and hasten to the camp.    XIX.--The situation of the camp was a rising ground, gently sloping from  the bottom for about a mile. Thither they proceeded with great speed (in  order that as little time as possible might be given to the Romans to  collect and arm themselves), and arrived quite out of breath. Sabinus  having encouraged his men, gives them the signal, which they earnestly  desired. While the enemy were encumbered by reason of the burdens which  they were carrying, he orders a sally to be suddenly made from two gates  [of the camp]. It happened, by the advantage of situation, by the  unskilfulness and the fatigue of the enemy, by the valour of our  soldiers, and their experience in former battles, that they could not  stand one attack of our men, and immediately turned their backs: and our  men with full vigour followed them while disordered, and slew a great  number of them; the horse pursuing the rest, left but few, who escaped  by flight. Thus at the same time, Sabinus was informed of the naval  battle and Caesar of victory gained by Sabinus; and all the states  immediately surrendered themselves to Titurius: for as the temper of the  Gauls is impetuous and ready to undertake wars, so their mind is weak,  and by no means resolute in enduring calamities.    XX.--About the same time, P. Crassus, when he had arrived in Aquitania  (which, as has been before said, both from its extent of territory and  the great number of its people, is to be reckoned a third part of Gaul),  understanding that he was to wage war in these parts, where a few years  before L. Valerius Praeconinus, the lieutenant, had been killed, and his  army routed, and from which L. Manilius, the proconsul, had fled with  the loss of his baggage, he perceived that no ordinary care must be used  by him. Wherefore, having provided corn, procured auxiliaries and  cavalry, [and] having summoned by name many valiant men from Tolosa,  Carcaso, and Narbo, which are the states of the province of Gaul, that  border on these regions [Aquitania], he led his army into the  territories of the Sotiates. On his arrival being known, the Sotiates  having brought together great forces and [much] cavalry, in which their  strength principally lay, and assailing our army on the march, engaged  first in a cavalry action, then when their cavalry was routed, and our  men pursuing, they suddenly display their infantry forces, which they  had placed in ambuscade in a valley. These attacked our men [while]  disordered, and renewed the fight.    XXI.--The battle was long and vigorously contested, since the Sotiates,  relying on their former victories, imagined that the safety of the whole  of Aquitania rested on their valour; [and] our men, on the other hand,  desired it might be seen what they could accomplish without their  general and without the other legions, under a very young commander; at  length the enemy, worn out with wounds, began to turn their backs, and a  great number of them being slain, Crassus began to besiege the  [principal] town of the Sotiates on his march. Upon their valiantly  resisting, he raised vineae and turrets. They at one time attempting a  sally, at another forming mines to our rampart and vineae (at which the  Aquitani are eminently skilled, because in many places amongst them  there are copper mines); when they perceived that nothing could be  gained by these operations through the perseverance of our men, they  send ambassadors to Crassus, and entreat him to admit them to a  surrender. Having obtained it, they, being ordered to deliver up their  arms, comply.    XXII.--And while the attention of our men is engaged in that matter, in  another part Adcantuannus, who held the chief command, with 600 devoted  followers, whom they call soldurii (the conditions of whose association  are these,--that they enjoy all the conveniences of life with those to  whose friendship they have devoted themselves: if anything calamitous  happen to them, either they endure the same destiny together with them,  or commit suicide: nor hitherto, in the memory of men, has there been  found any one who, upon his being slain to whose friendship he had  devoted himself, refused to die); Adcantuannus, [I say] endeavouring to  make a sally with these, when our soldiers had rushed together to arms,  upon a shout being raised at that part of the fortification, and a  fierce battle had been fought there, was driven back into the town, yet  he obtained from Crassus [the indulgence] that he should enjoy the same  terms of surrender [as the other inhabitants].    XXIII.--Crassus, having received their arms and hostages, marched into  the territories of the Vocates and the Tarusates. But then, the  barbarians being alarmed, because they had heard that a town fortified  by the nature of the place and by art had been taken by us in a few days  after our arrival there, began to send ambassadors into all quarters, to  combine, to give hostages one to another, to raise troops. Ambassadors  also are sent to those states of Hither Spain which are nearest to  Aquitania, and auxiliaries and leaders are summoned from them; on whose  arrival they proceed to carry on the war with great confidence, and with  a great host of men. They who had been with Q. Sertorius the whole  period [of his war in Spain] and were supposed to have very great skill  in military matters, are chosen leaders. These, adopting the practice of  the Roman people, begin to select [advantageous] places, to fortify  their camp, to cut off our men from provisions, which, when Crassus  observes, [and likewise] that his forces, on account of their small  number, could not safely be separated; that the enemy both made  excursions and beset the passes, and [yet] left sufficient guard for  their camp; that on that account, corn and provision could not very  conveniently be brought up to him, and that the number of the enemy was  daily increased, he thought that he ought not to delay in giving battle.  This matter being brought to a council, when he discovered that all  thought the same thing, he appointed the next day for the fight.    XXIV.--Having drawn out all his forces at the break of day, and  marshalled them in a double line, he posted the auxiliaries in the  centre, and waited to see what measures the enemy would take. They,  although on account of their great number and their ancient renown in  war, and the small number of our men, they supposed they might safely  fight, nevertheless considered it safer to gain the victory without any  wound, by besetting the passes [and] cutting off the provisions: and if  the Romans, on account of the want of corn, should begin to retreat,  they intended to attack them while encumbered in their march and  depressed in spirit [as being assailed while] under baggage. This  measure being approved of by the leaders and the forces of the Romans  drawn out, the enemy [still] kept themselves in their camp. Crassus  having remarked this circumstance, since the enemy, intimidated by their  own delay, and by the reputation [_i.e._ for cowardice arising thence]  had rendered our soldiers more eager for fighting, and the remarks of  all were heard [declaring] that no longer ought delay to be made in  going to the camp, after encouraging his men, he marches to the camp of  the enemy, to the great gratification of his own troops.    XXV.--There, while some were filling up the ditch, and others, by  throwing a large number of darts, were driving the defenders from the  rampart and fortifications, and the auxiliaries, on whom Crassus did not  much rely in the battle, by supplying stones and weapons [to the  soldiers], and by conveying turf to the mound, presented the appearance  and character of men engaged in fighting; while also the enemy were  fighting resolutely and boldly, and their weapons, discharged from their  higher position, fell with great effect; the horse, having gone round  the camp of the enemy, reported to Crassus that the camp was not  fortified with equal care on the side of the Decuman gate, and had an  easy approach.    XXVI.--Crassus, having exhorted the commanders of the horse to animate  their men by great rewards and promises, points out to them what he  wished to have done. They, as they had been commanded, having brought  out the four cohorts, which, as they had been left as a guard for the  camp, were not fatigued by exertion, and having led them round by a  somewhat longer way, lest they could be seen from the camp of the enemy,  when the eyes and minds of all were intent upon the battle, quickly  arrived at those fortifications which we have spoken of, and, having  demolished these, stood in the camp of the enemy before they were seen  by them, or it was known what was going on. And then, a shout being  heard in that quarter, our men, their strength having been recruited  (which usually occurs on the hope of victory), began to fight more  vigorously. The enemy, surrounded on all sides, [and] all their affairs  being despaired of, made great attempts to cast themselves down over the  ramparts and to seek safety in flight. These the cavalry pursued over  the very open plains, and after leaving scarcely a fourth part out of  the number of 50,000, which it was certain had assembled out of  Aquitania and from the Cantabri,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10661"],[0,"A Selection from the Discourses of Epictetus with the Encheiridion (#19)"],[1,"some inquiry into your opinions and have taken  some pains about them. And as now you are sailing to Rome in order to  become governor of the Cnossians, and you are not content to stay at  home with the honors which you had, but you desire something greater and  more conspicuous, so when did you ever make a voyage for the purpose of  examining your own opinions, and casting them out, if you have any that  are bad? Whom have you approached for this purpose? What time have you  fixed for it? What age? Go over the times of your life by yourself, if  you are ashamed of me (knowing the fact) when you were a boy, did you  examine your own opinions? and did you not then, as you do all things  now, do as you did do? and when you were become a youth and attended the  rhetoricians, and yourself practised rhetoric, what did you imagine that  you were deficient in? And when you were a young man and engaged in  public matters, and pleaded causes yourself, and were gaining  reputation, who then seemed your equal? And when would you have  submitted to any man examining and showing that your opinions are bad?  What then do you wish me to say to you? Help me in this matter. I have  no theorem (rule) for this. Nor have you, if you came to me for this  purpose, come to me as a philosopher, but as to a seller of vegetables  or a shoemaker. For what purpose then have philosophers theorems? For  this purpose, that whatever may happen, our ruling faculty may be and  continue to be conformable to nature. Does this seem to you a small  thing? No; but the greatest. What then? does it need only a short time?  and is it possible to seize it as you pass by? If you can, seize it.    Then you will say, I met with Epictetus as I should meet with a stone or  a statue: for you saw me and nothing more. But he meets with a man as a  man, who learns his opinions, and in his turn shows his own. Learn my  opinions: show me yours; and then say that you have visited me. Let us  examine one another: if I have any bad opinion, take it away; if you  have any, show it. This is the meaning of meeting with a philosopher.  Not so (you say): but this is only a passing visit, and while we are  hiring the vessel, we can also see Epictetus. Let us see what he says.  Then you go away and say: Epictetus was nothing; he used solecisms and  spoke in a barbarous way. For of what else do you come as judges? Well,  but a man may say to me, if I attend to such matters (as you do), I  shall have no land as you have none; I shall have no silver cups as you  have none, nor fine beasts as you have none. In answer to tins it is  perhaps sufficient to say: I have no need of such things; but if you  possess many things you have need of others: whether you choose or not,  you are poorer than I am. What then have I need of? Of that which you  have not? of firmness, of a mind which is conformable to nature, of  being free from perturbation.           *       *       *       *       *    IN WHAT MANNER WE OUGHT TO BEAR SICKNESS.--When the need of each opinion  comes, we ought to have it in readiness: on the occasion of breakfast,  such opinions as relate to breakfast; in the bath, those that concern  the bath; in bed, those that concern bed.      Let sleep not come upon thy languid eyes    Before each daily action thou hast scann'd;    What's done amiss, what done, what left undone;    From first to last examine all, and then    Blame what is wrong, in what is right rejoice.    And we ought to retain these verses in such way that we may use them,  not that we may utter them aloud, as when we exclaim, \"Paean Apollo.\"  Again in fever we should have ready such opinions as concern a fever;  and we ought not, as soon as the fever begins, to lose and forget all. A  man who has a fever may say: If I philosophize any longer, may I be  hanged: wherever I go, I must take care of the poor body, that a fever  may not come. But what is philosophizing? Is it not a preparation  against events which may happen? Do you not understand that you are  saying something of this kind? \"If I shall still prepare myself to bear  with patience what happens, may I be hanged.\" But this is just as if a  man after receiving blows should give up the Pancratium. In the  Pancratium it is in our power to desist and not to receive blows.    But in the other matter if we give up philosophy, what shall we gain?  What then should a man say on the occasion of each painful thing? It was  for this that I exercised myself, for this I disciplined myself. God  says to you: Give me a proof that you have duly practised athletics,  that you have eaten what you ought, that you have been exercised, that  you have obeyed the aliptes (the oiler and rubber). Then do you show  yourself weak when the time for action comes? Now is the time for the  fever. Let it be borne well. Now is the time for thirst, bear it well.  Now is the time for hunger, bear it well. Is it not in your power? Who  shall hinder you? The physician will hinder you from drinking; but he  cannot prevent you from bearing thirst well: and he will hinder you from  eating; but he cannot prevent you from bearing hunger well.    But I cannot attend to my philosophical studies. And for what purpose do  you follow them? Slave, is it not that you may be happy, that you may be  constant, is it not that you may be in a state conformable to nature and  live so? What hinders you when you have a fever from having your ruling  faculty conformable to nature? Here is the proof of the thing, here is  the test of the philosopher. For this also is a part of life, like  walking, like sailing, like journeying by land, so also is fever. Do you  read when you are walking? No. Nor do you when you have a fever. But if  you walk about well, you have all that belongs to a man who walks. If  you bear a fever well, you have all that belongs to a man in a fever.  What is it to bear a fever well? Not to blame God or man; not to be  afflicted at that which happens, to expect death well and nobly, to do  what must be done: when the physician comes in, not to be frightened at  what he says; nor if he says you are doing well, to be overjoyed. For  what good has he told you? and when you were in health, what good was  that to you? And even if he says you are in a bad way, do not despond.  For what is it to be ill? is it that you are near the severance of the  soul and the body? what harm is there in this? If you are not near now,  will you not afterwards be near? Is the world going to be turned upside  down when you are dead? Why then do you flatter the physician? Why do  you say if you please, master, I shall be well? Why do you give him an  opportunity of raising his eyebrows (being proud; or showing his  importance)? Do you not value a physician, as you do a shoemaker when he  is measuring your foot, or a carpenter when he is building your house,  and so treat the physician as to the body which is not yours, but by  nature dead? He who has a fever has an opportunity of doing this: if he  does these things, he has what belongs to him. For it is not the  business of a philosopher to look after these externals, neither his  wine nor his oil nor his poor body, but his own ruling power. But as to  externals how must he act? so far as not to be careless about them.  Where then is there reason for fear? where is there then still reason  for anger, and of fear about what belongs to others, about things which  are of no value? For we ought to have these two principles in readiness,  that except the will nothing is good nor bad; and that we ought not to  lead events, but to follow them. My brother ought not to have behaved  thus to me. No, but he will see to that; and, however he may behave, I  will conduct myself towards him as I ought. For this is my own business;  that belongs to another: no man can prevent this, the other thing can be  hindered.           *       *       *       *       *    ABOUT EXERCISE.--We ought not to make our exercises consist in means  contrary to nature and adapted to cause admiration, for if we do so, we  who call ourselves philosophers, shall not differ at all from jugglers.  For it is difficult even to walk on a rope; and not only difficult, but  it is also dangerous. Ought we for this reason to practice walking on a  rope, or setting up a palm-tree, or embracing statues? By no means.  Every thing which is difficult and dangerous is not suitable for  practice; but that is suitable which conduces to the working out of that  which is proposed to us. And what is that which is proposed to us as a  thing to be worked out? To live with desire and aversion (avoidance of  certain things) free from restraint. And what is this? Neither to be  disappointed in that which you desire, nor to fall into anything which  you would avoid. Towards this object then exercise (practice) ought to  tend. For since it is not possible to have your desire not disappointed  and your aversion free from falling into that which you would avoid,  without great and constant practice, you must know that if you allow  your desire and aversion to turn to things which are not within the  power of the will, you will neither have your desire capable of  attaining your object, nor your aversion free from the power of avoiding  that which you would avoid. And since strong habit leads (prevails), and  we are accustomed to employ desire and aversion only to things which are  not within the power of our will, we ought to oppose to this habit a  contrary habit, and where there is great slipperiness in the  appearances, there to oppose the habit of exercise. Then at last, if  occasion presents itself, for the purpose of trying yourself at a proper  time you will descend into the arena to know if appearances overpower  you as they did formerly. But at first fly far from that which is  stronger than yourself; the contest is unequal between a charming young  girl and a beginner in philosophy. The earthen pitcher, as"]]]
