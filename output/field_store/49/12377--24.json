Near the camp of the Sixth Virginia was that of the Tenth Immune  Regiment, in which were many Virginia boys, some of whom had been  members of some of the companies of the Sixth.    Some irresponsible persons cut down a tree upon which several men had  been lynched. The blame naturally fell upon the Sixth Virginia. The  regiment was placed under arrest and remained so for nineteen days.  The first day the Third Engineers guarded the camp, but General  Wilson, the Corps commander, removed them and put colored soldiers to  guard them. On the night of November 20th, at a late hour, the camp  was surrounded by all the troops available while the men were asleep  and the regiment was disarmed.    While all this was going on the Thirty-first Michigan Regiment had  been deployed into line behind a hill on the north and the Fourth  Tennessee had been drawn up in line on the east side of the camp ready  to fire should any resistance be offered.    The men quietly submitted to this strange procedure, and did not know  that Gatling guns had been conveniently placed at hand to mow them  down had they shown any resistance. The Southern papers called them  the mutinous Sixth, and said and did every thing to place discredit  upon them.    They were reviewed by General Breckinridge, General Alger, Secretary  of War, and President McKinley, who applauded them for their fine and  soldierly appearance.            COMMENTS ON THE THIRD NORTH CAROLINA REGIMENT.      Of all the volunteer regiments the Third North Carolina seemed to be  picked out as the target for attack by the Georgia newspapers. The  Atlanta Journal, under large headlines, \"A Happy Riddance,\" has the  following to say when the Third North Carolina left Macon. But  the Journal's article was evidently written in a somewhat of a  wish-it-was-so-manner, and while reading this article we ask our  readers to withhold judgment until they read Prof. C.F. Meserve on the  Third North Carolina, who wrote after investigation.    The Journal made no investigation to see what the facts were, but  dwells largely on rumors and imagination. It will be noted that  President Meserve took the pains to investigate the subject before  writing about it.    The Atlanta Journal says:    A HAPPY RIDDANCE.    The army and the country are to be congratulated on the mustering out  of the Third North Carolina Regiment.    A tougher and more turbulent set of Negroes were probably never gotten  together before. Wherever this regiment went it caused trouble.    While stationed in Macon several of its members were killed, either by  their own comrades in drunken brawls or by citizens in self-defense.    Last night the mustered-out regiment passed through Atlanta on its way  home and during its brief stay here exhibited the same ruffianism and  brutality that characterized it while in the service. But for the  promptness and pluck of several Atlanta policemen these Negro  ex-soldiers would have done serious mischief at the depot. Those who  undertook to make trouble were very promptly clubbed into submission,  and one fellow more obstreperous than the rest, was lodged in the  station house.    With the exception of two or three regiments the Negro volunteers in  the recent war were worse than useless. The Negro regulars, on the  contrary, made a fine record, both for fighting and conduct in camp.    [Illustration: THIRD NORTH CAROLINA VOLUNTEERS AND OFFICERS.]    The mustering out of the Negro volunteers should have begun sooner and  have been completed long ago.           *       *       *       *       *    WHAT PRESIDENT CHARLES FRANCIS MESERVE SAYS.    President Charles Francis Meserve, of Shaw University, says:    \"I spent a part of two days the latter part of December at Camp  Haskell, near Macon, Ga., inspecting the Third North Carolina colored  regiment and its camp and surroundings. The fact that this regiment  has colored officers and the knowledge that the Colonel and quite  a number of officers, as well as many of the rank and file, were  graduates or former students of Shaw University, led me to make  a visit to this regiment, unheralded and unannounced. I was just  crossing the line into the camp when I was stopped by a guard, who  wanted to know who I was and what I wanted. I told him I was a very  small piece of Shaw University, and that I wanted to see Col. Young.  After that sentence was uttered, and he had directed me to the  headquarters of the colonel, the regiment and the camp might have been  called mine, for the freedom of everything was granted me.\"    The camp is admirably located on a sandy hillside, near pine woods,  and is dry and well-drained. It is well laid out, with a broad avenue  in the centre intersected by a number of side streets. On one side of  the avenue are the tents and quarters of the men and the canteen,  and on the opposite side the officers' quarters, the hospital, the  quartermasters stores, the Y.M.C.A. tent, etc.    Although the weather was unfavorable, the camp was in the best  condition, and from the standpoint of sanitation was well-nigh  perfect. I went everywhere and saw everything, even to the sinks and  corral. Part of the time I was alone and part of the time an officer  attended me. There was an abundant supply of water from the Macon  water works distributed in pipes throughout the camp. The clothing was  of good quality and well cared for. The food was excellent, abundant  in quantity and well prepared. The beef was fresh and sweet, for it  had not been \"embalmed.\" The men were not obliged to get their fresh  meat by picking maggots out of dried apples and dried peaches as has  been the case sometimes in the past on our \"Wild West Frontier.\" There  were potatoes, Irish and sweet, navy beans, onions, meat, stacks of  light bread, canned salmon, canned tomatoes, etc. These were not all  served at one meal, but all these articles and others go to make up  the army ration list.    The spirit and discipline of officers and men was admirable, and  reflected great credit upon the Old North State. There was an  enthusiastic spirit and buoyancy that made their discipline and  evolutions well nigh perfect. The secret of it all was confidence in  their leader. They believe in their colonel, and the colonel in turn  believes in his men. Col. James H. Young possesses in a marked degree  a quality of leadership as important as it is rare. He probably knows  by name at least three-quarters of his regiment, and is on pleasant  terms with his staff and the men in the ranks, and yet maintains a  proper dignity, such as befits his official rank.    [Illustration: PROF. CHARLES F. MESERVE, OF SHAW UNIVERSITY, RALEIGH,  N.C. (Who investigated and made report on the Third N.C. Volunteers.)]    On the last afternoon of my visit of inspection Col. Young ordered  the regiment drawn up in front of his headquarters, and invited me to  address them. The Colonel and his staff were mounted, and I was given  a position of honor on a dry goods box near the head of the beautiful  horse upon which the Colonel was mounted. Besides Colonel James  H. Young, of Raleigh, were near me Lieutenant Colonel Taylor, of  Charlotte; Major Walker, of Wilmington; Major Hayward, of Raleigh;  Chief Surgeon Dellinger, of Greensboro; Assistant Surgeons Pope, of  Charlotte, and Alston, of Asheville; Capt. Durham, of Winston; Capt.  Hamlin, of Raleigh; Capt. Hargraves, of Maxton; Capt. Mebane, of  Elizabeth City; Capt. Carpenter, of Rutherfordton; Capt. Alexander,  of Statesville; Capt. Smith, of Durham; Capt. Mason, of Kinston;  who served under Colonel Shaw at Fort Wagner; Capt. Leatherwood,  Asheville; Capt. Stitt, of Charlotte; Capt. York, of Newbern; and  Quartermaster Lane, of Raleigh. That highly respected citizen of  Fayetteville, Adjutant Smith, was in the hospital suffering from a  broken leg. I told them they were on trial, and the success or failure  of the experiment must be determined by themselves alone; that  godliness, moral character, prompt and implicit obedience, as well as  bravery and unflinching courage, were necessary attributes of the true  soldier.    The Y.M.C.A. tent is a great blessing to the regiment, and is very  popular, and aids in every possible way the work of Chaplain Durham.    The way Col. Young manages the canteen cannot be too highly  recommended. Ordinarily the term canteen is another name for a  drinking saloon, though a great variety of articles, such as soldiers  need, are on sale and the profits go to the soldiers. But the canteen  of the Third North Carolina is a dry one. By that I mean that  spiritous or malt liquors are not sold. Col. Young puts into practice  the principles that have always characterized his personal habits, and  with the best results to his regiment.    I had the pleasure of meeting Capt. S. Babcock, Assistant Adjutant  General of the Brigade, who has known this regiment since it was  mustered into the service. He speaks of it in the highest terms. I  also met Major John A. Logan, the Provost Marshal, and had a  long interview with him. He said the Third North Carolina was a  well-behaved regiment and that he had not arrested a larger per cent  of men from this regiment than from any other regiment, and that I was  at liberty to publicly use this statement.    While in the sleeper on my way home I fell in with Capt. J.C. Gresham,  of the Seventh Cavalry. Capt. Gresham is a native of Virginia, a  graduate of Richmond College and West Point, and has served many years  in the regular army. He was with Colonel Forsyth in the battle with  the Sioux at Wounded Knee, South Dakota. I had met him previously,  when I was in the United States Indian service in Kansas. He informed  me that he mustered in the first four companies of the Third North  Carolina, and the Colonel and his staff, and that he had never met a  more capable man than Colonel Young.    The Third North Carolina has never seen"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11114"],[0,"Debate on Woman Suffrage in the Senate of the United States, (#19)"],[1,"     hearth-priestesshood; not as politicians, bred and hardened in the      public arenas.        That the family is the heart of the state, and that the state      is but the widened family, is the fact which the old vestal      consecration, power, and honor set forth and kept in mind.        The voice which has of late been so generally conceded to women in      town, decisions as regarding public schools, is an instance of the      fittingness of relegating to them certain interests of which they      should know more than men, because--applying the key-test with      which we have started--it has direct relation to and springs from      their motherhood. But can one help suggesting that if the movement      had been to place women, merely and directly, upon the committees,      by votes of men who saw that this work might be in great part best      done by them; if women had asked and offered for the place without      the jostle of the town-meeting, or putting in that wedge for      the ballot--the thing might have been as readily done, and the      objection, or political precedent, avoided.        It is not the real opportunity, when that arises or shows itself      in the line of her life-law, that is to be refused for woman. It      is the taking from internal power to add to external complication      of machinery and to the friction of strife. Let us just touch      upon some of the current arguments concerning these external      impositions which one set is demanding and the other entreating      against.        If voting is to be the chief power in woman's hands, or even a      power of half the moment that is contended for it, it will grow to      be the motive and end, the all-absorbing object, with women that      it is with men.        The gubernatorial canvass, the presidential year, these will      interrupt and clog all home business, suspend decisions, paralyze      plans, as they do with men, or else we shall not be much, as      thorough politicians, after all. And if we talk of mending all      that, of putting politics in their right place, and governing      by pure principle instead of party trick, and stumping and      electioneering, we go back in effect to the acknowledgment that      only in the interior work, and behind politics, can women do      better things at all; which, precisely, was to be demonstrated.        Think, simply, of election day for women.        Would it be so invariably easy a thing for a home-keeper to do,      at the one opportunity of the year, or the four years, on a      particular day, her duty in this matter? It is easy to say that it      takes no more time than a hundred other things that some do; but      setting apart all the argument that previous time and strength      must have been spent in properly qualifying, how many of      the hundred other things are done now without interruption,      postponement, hindrance, through domestic contingencies? or are      there a hundred other things done when the home contingencies are      really met by a woman? A woman's life is not like a man's. That      a man's life may be--that he may transact his out-door business;      keep his hours and appointments; may cast his vote on election      day; may represent wife and children in all wherein the community      cares for, or might injure him and them--the woman, some woman,      must be at the home post, that the home order may go on, from      which he derives that command of time, and freedom from hindering      necessities, which leave him to his work. And so, as the old      proverb says, while man's work is from sun to sun--made definite,      a matter to which he can go forth, and from which he can come      in--a woman's work, of keeping the place of the forthgoing and      incoming, is never done, from the very nature and ceaseless      importance of it.        Must she go to the polls, sick or well, baby or no baby, servant      or no servant, strength or no strength, desire or no desire? If      she have cook and housemaid they are to go also, and number her      two to one, anyway; probably on election day, which they would      make a holiday, they would--as at other crises, of birth,      sickness, death, house-cleaning, which should occur in no      first-class families--come down upon her with their appropriate      _coup d'etat_, and \"leave;\" making the State-stroke, in this      instance, of scoring three votes, two dropped and one lost, for      the irrepressible side.        How will it be when Norah, and Maggie, and Katie have not only      their mass and confession, their Fourth-of-July and Christmas,      their mission-weeks, their social engagements and family plans,      and their appointments with their dress-makers, to curtail your      claims upon their bargained time and service, but their share in      the primary meetings and caucuses, committees, and torch-light      processions, and mass meetings? For what shall prevent the      excitements, the pleasurings, the runnings hither and thither,      that men delight in from following in the train of politics and      parties with the common woman? Perhaps it may even be discovered,      to the still further detriment of our already painfully hampered      and perplexed domestic system, that the pursuit of fun, votes,      offices, is more remunerative, as well as gentlewomanly--as      Micawber might express it--than the cleansing of pots and pans,      the weekly wash, or the watching of the roast. Perhaps in that      enfranchised day there will be no Katies and Maggies' and the      Norahs will know their place no more. Then the enlightened      womanhood may have to begin at the foundation and glorify the      kitchen again. And good enough for her, in the wide as well as      primitive sense of the phrase, and a grand turn in the history      that repeats itself toward the old, forgotten, peaceful side of      the cycle it may be!        But the argument does not rest upon any such points as these. It      rests upon the inside nature of a woman's work; upon the need      there is to begin again to-day at the heart of things and make      that right; upon the evident fact that this can be done none too      soon or earnestly, if the community and the country are not to      keep on in the broad way to a threatened destruction; and upon the      certainty that it can never be done unless it is done by woman,      and with all of woman's might. Not by struggles for new and      different place, but by the better, more loving, more intelligent,      deep-seeing, and deep-feeling filling of her own place, that none      will dispute and none can take from her. We are not where woman      was in the old brutal days that are so often quoted; and we shall      not, need not, return to that. Christianity has disposed of that      sort of argument. We are on a vantage ground for the doing of our      real, essential work better than it has been done ever before in      the history of the world; and we are madly leaving our work and      our vantage together.        The great step made by woman was in the generation preceding this      one of restlessness--the restlessness that has come through the      first feeling of great power. It was made in the time when women      learned physiology, that they might rear and nurse their families      and help their neighborhoods understandingly; science, that they      might teach and answer little children, and share the joy of      knowledge that was spreading swiftly in the earth; political      history and economy, that they might listen and talk to their      brothers and husbands and sons, and leaven the life of the age as      the bread in the mixing; business figures, rules, and principles,      that they might sympathize, counsel, help, and prudentially work      with and honestly strengthen the bread-winners. The good work was      begun in the schools where girls were first told, as George B.      Emerson used to tell us Boston girls, that we were learning      everything he could teach us, in order to be women: wives,      mothers, friends, social influencers, in the best and largest way      possible. Women grew strong and capable under such instruction and      motive. Are their daughters and grand-daughters about to leap      the fence, leave their own realm little cared for--or doomed to      be--undertake the whole scheme of outside creation, or contest      it with the men? Then God help the men! God save the Commonwealth!        We are past the point already where homes are suffering, or liable      to suffer, neglect or injury; they are already left unmade. Shall      this go on? Between frivolities and ambitions, between social      vanities, and shows, and public meddling's and mixings--for where      one woman is needed and doing really brave, true work, there are      a hundred rushing forth for the mere sake of rushing--is the      primitive home, the power of heaven upon earth to slip away from      among us? Let us not build outsides which have no insides, let us      not put a face upon things which has no reality behind it. Beware      lest we make the confusion that we need the suffrage to help us      unmake; lest we tear to pieces that we may patch again. Crazy      patchwork that would be, indeed!        Are women's votes required because men will not legislate away      evils that they do not heartily wish away? Is government      corrupted because men desire shield and opportunity for dishonest      speculation; authority and countenance for nefarious combinations?      The more need to go to work at the beginning rather than to plunge      into the pitch and be defiled; more need to make haste and educate      a better generation of men, if it be so we can not, except _vi et      armis_, influence the generation that is. But do you think that if      women are in earnest--enough in earnest to give"]]]
