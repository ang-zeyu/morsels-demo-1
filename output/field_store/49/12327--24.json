[_And stalking turrets_. l. 478. \"At one o'clock we alighted among some  acacia trees at Waadi el Halboub, having gone twenty-one miles. We were  here at once surprised and terrified by a sight surely one of the most  magnificent in the world. In that vast expanse of desert, from W. to  N.W. of us, we saw a number of prodigious pillars of sand at different  distances, at times moving with great celerity, at others stalking on  with a majestic slowness; at intervals we thought they were coming in a  very few minutes to overwhelm us; and small quantities of sand did  actually more than once reach us. Again they would retreat so as to be  almost out of sight, their tops reaching to the very clouds. There the  tops often separated from the bodies; and these, once disjoined,  dispersed in the air, and did not appear more. Sometimes they were  broken in the middle, as if struck with large cannon-shot. About noon  they began to advance with considerable swiftness upon us, the wind  being very strong at north. Eleven of them ranged along side of us about  the distance of three miles. The greatest diameter of the largest  appeared to me at that distance as if it would measure ten feet. They  retired from us with a wind at S.E. leaving an impression upon my mind  to which I can give no name, though surely one ingredient in it was  fear, with a considerable deal of wonder and astonishment. It was in  vain to think of flying; the swiftest horse, or fastest sailing ship,  could be of no use to carry us out of this danger; and the full  persuasion of this rivetted me as if to the spot where I stood.    \"The same appearance of moving pillars of sand presented themselves to  us this day in form and disposition like those we had seen at Waadi  Halboub, only they seemed to be more in number and less in size. They  came several times in a direction close upon us, that is, I believe,  within less than two miles. They began immediately after sun rise like a  thick wood and almost darkened the sun. His rays shining through them  for near an hour, gave them an appearance of pillars of fire. Our people  now became desperate, the Greeks shrieked out and said it was the day of  judgment; Ismael pronounced it to be hell; and the Turcorories, that the  world was on fire.\" Bruce's Travels, Vol. IV. p. 553,-555.    From this account it would appear, that the eddies of wind were owing to  the long range of broken rocks, which bounded one side of the sandy  desert, and bent the currents of air, which struck against their sides;  and were thus like the eddies in a stream of water, which falls against  oblique obstacles. This explanation is probably the true one, as these  whirl-winds were not attended with rain or lightening like the tornadoes  of the West-Indies.]             IX. \"GNOMES! whose fine forms, impassive as the air,  500  Shrink with soft sympathy for human care;       Who glide unseen, on printless slippers borne,       Beneath the waving grass, and nodding corn;       Or lay your tiny limbs, when noon-tide warms,       Where shadowy cowslips stretch their golden arms,--  505  So mark'd on orreries in lucid signs,       Star'd with bright points the mimic zodiac shines;       Borne on fine wires amid the pictured skies       With ivory orbs the planets set and rise;       Round the dwarf earth the pearly moon is roll'd,  510  And the sun twinkling whirls his rays of gold.--       Call your bright myriads, march your mailed hosts,       With spears and helmets glittering round the coasts;       Thick as the hairs, which rear the Lion's mane,       Or fringe the Boar, that bays the hunter-train;  515  Watch, where proud Surges break their treacherous mounds,       And sweep resistless o'er the cultured grounds;       Such as erewhile, impell'd o'er Belgia's plain,       Roll'd her rich ruins to the insatiate main;       With piles and piers the ruffian waves engage,  520  And bid indignant Ocean stay his rage.

[_The granite-cliffs._ l. 523. On long exposure to air the granites or  porphories of this country exhibit a ferrugenous crust, the iron being  calcined by the air first becomes visible, and is then washed away from  the external surface, which becomes white or grey, and thus in time  seems to decompose. The marbles seem to decompose by loosing their  carbonic acid, as the outside, which has been long exposed to the air,  does not seem to effervesce so hastily with acids as the parts more  recently broken. The immense quantity of carbonic acid, which exists in  the many provinces of lime-stone, if it was extricated and decomposed  would afford charcoal enough for fuel for ages, or for the production of  new vegetable or animal bodies. The volcanic slaggs on Mount Vesuvius  are said by M. Ferber to be changed into clay by means of the sulphur-  acid, and even pots made of clay and burnt or vitrified are said by him  to be again reducible to ductile clay by the volcanic steams. Ferber's  Travels through Italy, p. 166.]    [_Wooden wedges wound_. l. 524. It is usual in seperating large mill-  stones from the siliceous sand-rocks in some parts of Derbyshire to bore  horizontal holes under them in a circle, and fill these with pegs made  of dry wood, which gradually swell by the moisture of the earth, and in  a day or two lift up the mill-stone without breaking it.]    [_With fires and acids_. l. 534. Hannibal was said to erode his way over  the Alps by fire and vinegar. The latter is supposed to allude to the  vinegar and water which was the beverage of his army. In respect to the  former it is not improbable, but where wood was to be had in great  abundance, that fires made round limestone precipices would calcine them  to a considerable depth, the night-dews or mountain-mists would  penetrate these calcined parts and pulverize them by the force of the  steam which the generated heat would produce, the winds would disperse  this lime-powder, and thus by repeated fires a precipice of lime-stone  might be destroyed and a passage opened. It should be added, that  according to Ferber's observations, these Alps consist of lime-stone.

This is a homely dish, but is by many persons much liked. It is  customary to bring it to table in the pan in which it is baked.      PORK STEAKS.    Pork steaks or chops should be taken from the neck, or the loin.  Cut them about half an inch thick, remove the skin, trim them  neatly, and beat them. Season them with pepper, salt, and powdered  sage-leaves or sweet marjoram, and broil them over a clear fire  till quite done all through, turning them once. They require much  longer broiling than beef-steaks of mutton chops. When you think  they are nearly done, take up one on a plate and try it. If it is  the least red inside, return it to the gridiron. Have ready a  gravy made of the trimmings, or any coarse pieces of pork stewed  in a little water with chopped onions and sage, and skimmed  carefully. When all the essence is extracted, take out the bits of  meat, &c., and serve up the gravy in a boat to eat with the  steaks.    They should be accompanied with apple-sauce.      PORK CUTLETS.    Cut them from the leg, and remove the skin; trim them and beat  them, and sprinkle on salt and pepper. Prepare some beaten egg in  a pan; and on a flat dish a mixture of bread-crumbs, minced onion,  and sage. Put some lard or drippings into a frying-pan over the  fire; and when it boils, put in the cutlets; having dipped every  one first in the egg, and then in the seasoning. Fry them twenty  or thirty minutes, turning them often. After you have taken them  out of the frying-pan, skim the gravy, dredge in a little flour,  give it one boil, and then pour it on the dish round the cutlets.    Have apple-sauce to eat with them.    Pork cutlets prepared in this manner may be stewed instead of  being fried. Add to them a little water, and stew them slowly till  thoroughly done, keeping them closely covered except when you  remove the lid to skim them.      PORK PIE.    Take the lean of a leg or loin of fresh pork, and season it with  pepper, salt, and nutmeg. Cover the bottom and sides of a deep  dish, with, a good paste, made with a pound of butter to two  pounds of flour, and rolled out thick. Put in a layer of pork, and  then a layer of pippin apples, pared, cored, and cut small. Strew  over the apples sufficient sugar to make them very sweet. Then  place another layer of pork, and so on till the dish is full. Pour  in half a pint or more of water, or of white wine. Cover the pie  with a thick lid of paste, and notch and ornament it according to  your taste.    Set it in a brisk oven, and bake it well.      HAM PIE.    Cover the sides and bottom of a dish with a good pasts rolled out  thick. Have ready some slices of cold boiled ham, about half an  inch thick, some eggs boiled hard and sliced, and a large young  fowl cleaned and Cut up. Put a layer of ham at the bottom, then  the fowl, then the eggs, and then another layer of ham. Shake on  some pepper, and pour in some water, or what will be much better,  some veal gravy. Cover the pie with a crust, notch and ornament  it, and bake it well.    Some mushrooms will greatly improve it.    Small button mushrooms will keep very well in a bottle of sweet  oil--first peeling the skin, and cutting off the stalks.      HAM SANDWICHES    Cut some thin slices of bread very neatly, having slightly  buttered them; and, if you choose, spread on a very little  mustard. Have ready some very thin slices of cold boiled ham, and  lay one between two slices of bread. You may either roll them up,  or lay them flat on the plates. They are used at supper, or at  luncheon.    You may substitute for the ham, cold smoked tongue, shred or  grated.      BROILED HAM.    Cut the ham into very thin slices, (the thinner the better.) Soak  them in hot water at least half an hour, (a whole hour is better,)  to draw out some of the salt; changing the water several times,  and always pouring it on scalding hot. This process will not only  extract the superfluous salt (which would otherwise ooze out in  broiling and remain sticking about the surface of the meat) but it  makes the ham more tender and mellow. After soaking, dry the  slices in a cloth, and then heat your gridiron, and broil them  over a clear fire.    If you have cold boiled ham, it is better for broiling than that  which is raw; and being boiled, will require no soaking before you  put it on the gridiron.    If you wish to serve up eggs with the ham, put some lard into a  very clean frying-pan, and make it boiling hot. Break the eggs  separately into a saucer, that in case a bad one should be among  them it may not mix with the rest. Slip each egg gently into the  frying-pan. Do not turn them while they are frying, but keep  pouring some of the hot lard over them with an iron spoon; this  will do them sufficiently on the upper side. They will be done  enough in about three minutes; the white must retain its  transparency so that the yolk will be seen through it. When done,  take them up with a tin slice, drain off the lard, and if any part  of the white is discoloured or ragged, trim it off. Lay a fried  egg upon each slice of the broiled ham, and send them to table  hot.    This is a much nicer way than the common practice of frying the  ham or bacon with the eggs. Some persons broil or fry the ham  without eggs, and send it to table cut into little slips or  mouthfuls.    To curl small pieces of ham for garnishing, slice as thin as  possible some that has been boiled or parboiled. The pieces should  be about two inches square. Roll it up round little wooden  skewers, and put it into a cheese toaster, or into a tin oven, and  set it before the fire for eight or ten minutes. When it is done,  slip out the skewers.      TO BOIL A HAM.    Hams should always be soaked in water previous to boiling, to draw  out a portion of the salt, and to make them tender. They will  soften more easily if soaked in lukewarm water. If it is a new  ham, and not very salt or hard, you need not put it in water till  the evening before you intend to cook it. An older one will  require twenty-four hours' soaking; and one that is very old and  hard should be kept in soak two or three days, frequently changing  the water, which must be soft. Soak it in a tub, and keep it well  covered. When you take it out of the water to prepare it for  boiling, scrape and trim it nicely, and pare off all the bad  looking parts.    Early in the morning put it into a large pot or kettle with plenty  of cold water. Place it over a slow fire that it may heat  gradually; it should not come to a boil in less than an hour and a  half, or two hours. When it boils, quicken the fire, and skim the  pot carefully. Then simmer it gently four or fire hours or more,  according to its size. A ham weighing fifteen pounds should simmer  five hours after it has come to a boil. Keep the pot well skimmed.    When it is done, take it up, carefully strip off the skin, and  reserve it to cover the ham when it is put away cold. Rub the ham  all over with some beaten egg, and strew on it fine bread-raspings  shaken through the lid of a dredging box. Then place it in an oven  to brown and crisp, or on a hot dish set over the pot before the  fire. Cut some writing paper into a handsome fringe, and twist it  round the shank-bone before you send the ham to table. Garnish the  edge of the dish with little piles or spots of rasped crust of  bread.    In carving a ham, begin not quite in the centre, but a little  nearer to the hock. Cut the slices very thin. It is not only a  most ungenteel practice to cut ham in thick slices, but it much  impairs the flavour.    When you put it away after dinner, skewer on again the skin. This  will make it keep the better.    Ham should always be accompanied by green vegetables, such as  asparagus, peas, beans, spinach, cauliflower, brocoli, &c.    Bacon also should be well soaked before it is cooked; and it  should be boiled very slowly, and for a long time. The greens may  be boiled with the meat. Take care to skim the pot carefully, and  to drain and squeeze the greens very well before you send them to  table. If there are yellow streaks in the lean of the bacon, it is  rusty, and unfit to eat.      TO ROAST A HAM.    Take a very fine ham (a Westphalia one if you can procure it) and  soak it in lukewarm water for a day or two, changing the water  frequently. The day before you intend cooking it, take the ham out  of the water, and (having removed the skin) trim it nicely, and  pour over it a bottle of Madeira or sherry. Let it steep till next  morning, frequently during the day washing the wine over it. Put  it on the spit in time to allow at least six hours for slowly  roasting it. Baste it continually with hot water. When it is done,  dredge it all over with fine bread-raspings shaken on through the  top of the dredging box; and set it before the fire to brown.    For gravy, take the wine in which the ham was steeped, and add to  it the essence or juice which flowed from the meat when taken from  the spit. Squeeze in the juice of two lemons. Put it into a sauce-pan,  and boil and skim it. Send it to table in a boat. Cover the  shank of the ham (which should have been sawed short) with bunches  of double parsley, and ornament it with a cluster of flowers cut  out with a penknife from raw carrots, beets, and turnips; and made  to imitate marygolds, and red and white roses.      DIRECTIONS FOR CURING HAM OR BACON.    Ham or bacon, however well cured, will never be good unless the  pork of which it is made has been properly fed. The hogs should be  well fattened on corn, and fed with it about eight weeks, allowing  ten bushels to each hog. They are best for curing when from two to  four years old, and should not weigh more than one hundred and  fifty or one hundred and sixty pounds. The first four weeks they  may be fed on mush, or on Indian meal moistened with water; the  remaining four on corn unground; giving them always as much as  they will eat. Soap-suds may be"]]]
