D. 1700, and in occasional  instances a hundred years later. An elderly Seneca woman informed  the writer, thirty years ago, that when she was a girl she lived in  one of these joint tenement houses (called by them long-houses),  which contained eight families and two fires, and that her mother  and her grandmother, in their day, had acted as matrons over one of  these large households. [Footnote: The late Mrs. William Parker, of  Tonawanda.]    This mere glimpse at the ancient Iroquois plan of life, now entirely  passed away, and of which remembrance is nearly lost, is highly  suggestive. It shows that their domestic economy was not without  method, and it displays the care and management of woman, low down  in barbarism, for husbanding their resources and for improving their  condition. A knowledge of these houses, and how to build them, is  not even yet lost among the Senecas. Some years ago Mr. William  Parker, a Seneca chief, constructed for the writer a model of one of  these long-houses, showing in detail its external and internal  mechanism.    The late Rev. Ashur Wright, DD., for many years a missionary among  the Senecas, and familiar with their language and customs, wrote to  the author in 1873 on the subject of these households, as follows:  \"As to their family system, when occupying the old long-houses, it  is probable that some one clan predominated, the women taking in  husbands, however, from the other clans; and sometimes, for a novelty,  some of their sons bringing in their young wives until they felt  brave enough to leave their mothers. Usually, the female portion  ruled the house, and were doubtless clannish enough about it. The  stores were in common; but woe to the luckless husband or lover who  was too shiftless to do his share of the providing. No matter how  many children or whatever goods he might have in the house, he might  at any time be ordered to pick up his blanket and budge; and after  such orders it would not be healthful for him to attempt to disobey;  the house would be too hot for him; and unless saved by the  intercession of some aunt or grandmother he must retreat to his own  clan, or as was often done, go and start a new matrimonial alliance  in some other. The women wore the great power among the clans, as  everywhere else. They did not hesitate, when occasion required, to  'knock off the horns,' as it was technically called, from the head  of a chief and send him back to the ranks of the warriors. The  original nomination of the chiefs also always rested with them.\"    The mother-right and gyneocracy among the Iroquois here plainly  indicated is not overdrawn. The mothers and their children, as we  have seen, were of the same gens, and to them the house belonged. It  was a gentile house. In case of the death of father or mother, the  apartments they occupied could not be detached from the kinship, but  remained to its members. The position of the mother was eminently  favorable to her influence in the household, and tended to  strengthen the maternal bond. We may see in this an ancient phase of  human life which has had a wide prevalence in the tribes of  mankind, Asiatic, European, African, American, and Australian. Not  until after civilization had begun among the Greeks, and gentile  society was superseded by political society, was the influence  of this old order of society overthrown. It left behind, at least  among the Grecian tribes, deep traces of its previous existence.    [Footnote: These statements illustrate the gyneocracy and  mother-right among the ancient Grecian tribes discussed by Bachofen  in \"Das Mutterrecht.\" The phenomena discovered by Bachofen owes  its origin, probably, to descent in the female line, and to the  junction of several families in one house, on the principle of kin,  as among the Iroquois.]    Among the Iroquois, those who formed a household and cultivated  gardens gathered the harvest and stored it in their dwelling as a  common stock. There was more or less of individual ownership of  these products, and of their possession by different families. For  example, the corn, after stripping back the husk, was braided by the  husk in bunches and hung up in the different apartments; but when  one family had exhausted its supply, their wants were supplied by  other families so long as any remained. Each hunting and fishing  party made a common stock of the capture, of which the surplus, on  their return, was divided among the several families of each  household, and, having been cured, was reserved for winter use The  village did not make a common stock of their provisions, and thus  offer a bounty to imprudence It was confined to the household But  the principle of hospitality then came in to relieve the  consequences of destitution We can speak with some confidence of the  ancient usages and customs of the Iroquois; and when any usage is  found among them in a definite and positive form, it renders  probable the existence of the same usage in other tribes in the same  condition, because their necessities were the same.    In the History of Virginia, by Capt. John Smith, the houses of the  Powhatan Indians are partially described, and are found to be much  the same as those of the Iroquois We have already quoted from this  work the description of a house on Roanoke Island containing five  chambers. Speaking of the houses in the vicinity of James River in  1606-1608, he remarks, \"Their houses are built like our arbors, of  small young sprigs bowed and tied, and so close covered with mats,  or the bark of trees, very handsomely, that notwithstanding either  wind, rain, or weather, they are as warm as stoves but very smoky,  yet at the top of the house there is a hole made for the smoke to go  into right over the fire. Against the fire they lie on little  hurdles of reeds covered with a mat, borne from the ground a foot  and more by a hurdle of wood On these, round about the house, they  lie, heads and points, one by the other, against the fire, some  covered with mats, some with skins, and some stark naked lie on the  ground, from six to twenty in a house.... In some places are from  two to fifty of these houses together, or but little separated by  groves of trees.\" [Footnote: Smith's History of Virginia, Richmond  ed., 1819, i, 130]    The noticeable fact in this statement is the number of persons in  the house, which shows a household consisting of several families  Their communism in living may be inferred Elsewhere he speaks of  \"houses built after their manner, some thirty, some forty yards long,\"  and speaking of one of the houses of Powhatan he says, \"This house  is fifty or sixty yards in length,\" and again, at Pamunk, \"A great  fire was made in a long-house, a mat was spread on one side as on  the other, and on one side they caused him to sit.\" [Footnote: 5,  Ib, 1, 142, 143; Smith's Hist. Va., Richmond ed., 1819, i, 160.]    We here find among the Virginia Indians at the epoch of their  discovery long-houses very similar to the long-houses of the Iroquois,  with the same evidence of a large household. It may safely be taken  as a rule that every Indian household in the aboriginal period,  whether large or small, lived from common stores.    Mr. Caleb Swan, who visited the Creek Indians of Georgia in 1790,  found the people living in small houses or cabins, but in clusters,  each cluster being occupied by a part of a gens or clan. He remarks  that \"the smallest of their towns have from ten to forty houses, and  some of the largest from fifty to two hundred, that are tolerably  compact. These houses stand in clusters of four, five, six,  seven, and eight together.... Each cluster of houses contains  a clan or family of relations who eat and live in common.\"  [Footnote: Schoolcraft's Hist. Cond. and Pros. of Indian Tribes,  vol. v. 262.]    Here the fact of several families uniting on the principle of kin,  living in a cluster of houses, and practicing communism, is  expressly stated.    James Adair, writing still earlier of the southern Indians of the  United States generally, remarks in a passage before quoted, as  follows: \"I have observed, with much inward satisfaction, the  community of goods that prevailed among them.... And though they do  not keep one promiscuous common stock, yet it is to the very same  effect, for every one has his own family or tribe, and when any one  is speaking either of the individuals or habitations of his own  tribe, he says, 'He is of my house,' or, 'It is my house.'\"  [Footnote: History of the American Indians, p. 17.]    It is singular that this industrious investigator did not notice,  what is now known to be the fact, that all these tribes were  organized in gentes and phratries. It would have rendered his  observations upon their usages and customs more definite. Elsewhere  he remarks further that \"formerly the Indian law obliged every town  to work together in one body, in sewing or planting their crops,  though their fields were divided by proper marks, and their harvest  is gathered separately. The Cherokees and Muscogees [Creeks] still  observe that old custom, which is very necessary for such idle people.\"  [Footnote: ib., p. 430.]    They cultivated, like the Iroquois, three kinds of maize, an  \"early variety,\" the \"hominy corn,\" and the \"bread corn,\" also beans,  squashes, pumpkins, and tobacco. [Footnote: History of the American  Indians, p. 430] Chestnuts, a tuberous root something like the  potato but gathered in the marshes, berries, fish, and game, entered  into their subsistence. Like the Iroquois, they made unleavened  bread of maize flour, which was boiled in earthen vessels, in the  form of cakes, about six inches in diameter and an inch thick.  [Footnote: ib. pp. 406, 408.] Among the tribes of the plains, who  subsist almost exclusively upon animal food, their usages in the  hunt indicate the same tendency to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8115"],[0,"Authors of Greece (#18)"],[1,"fuller details. Very soon he enters with a band of  captive maidens, telling how his master had been kept in slavery in  Lydia; shaking off the yoke, he had sacked and destroyed the city of  Eurytus who had caused his captivity, the girls were Heracles' offering  of the spoils to Deianeira. Filled with pity at their lot, she looked  closely at them and was attracted by one of them, a silent girl of noble  countenance. Lichas when questioned denied all knowledge of her identity  and departed. When he had gone, the messenger desired private speech  with Deianeira. Lichas had lied; the girl was Iole, daughter of Eurytus;  it was for her sake that his master destroyed the city, for he loved  the maid and intended to keep her in his home to be a rival to his wife.  Lichas on coming out was confronted by the messenger, and attempted to  dissemble, but Deianeira appealed to him thus:--        \"Nay, deceive me not. Thou shalt not speak to a woman of evil heart,      who knoweth not the ways of men, how that they by a law of their      own being delight not always in the same thing. 'Tis a fool who      standeth up to battle against Love who ruleth even gods as he will,      and me too; then why not another such as I? Therefore if I revile      my lord when taken with this plague, I am crazed indeed--or this      woman is, who hath brought me no shame or sorrow. If my lord      teacheth thee to lie, thy lesson is no good one; if thou art      schooling thyself to falsehood in a desire to be kind to me, thou      shalt prove unkind. Speak all the truth; it is an ignoble lot for a      man of honour to be called false.\"    Completely won by this appeal, Lichas confesses the truth.    During the singing of a choral ode Deianeira has had time to reflect.  The reward of her loyalty is to take a second place. The girl is young  and her beauty is fast ripening; she herself is losing her charm. But no  prudent woman should fly into a passion; happily she has a remedy,  for in the first days of her wedded life Heracles had shot Nessus, a  half-human monster, for insulting her. Before he died Nessus bade her  steep her robe in his blood and treasure it as a certain charm for  recovering his waning affection. Summoning Lichas, she gives him strict  orders to take the robe to Heracles who was to allow no light of the sun  or fire to fall upon it before wearing it. After a short interval, she  returns in the greatest agitation; a little tuft of wool which she had  anointed with the monster's blood had caught the sunlight and shrivelled  up to dust. If the robe proved a means of death, she determined to slay  herself rather than live in disgrace. At that moment Hyllus bursts in to  describe the horrible tortures which seized Heracles when he put on the  poisoned mantle; the hero commanded his son to ferry him across from  Euboea to witness the curse which his mother's evil deed would bring  with it. Hearing these tidings Deianeira leaves the scene without  uttering a word.    The old nurse quickly rushes in from the palace to tell how Deianeira  had killed herself--while Hyllus was kissing her dead mother's lips  in vain self-reproach, bereft of both his parents. Heracles himself  is borne in on a litter, tormented with the slow consuming poison. In  agony, he prays for death; when he learns of the decease of his wife and  her beguilement by Nessus into an unintentional crime, his resentment  softens. In a flash of inspiration the double meaning of the oracle  comes over him, his labour is indeed over. Commanding Hyllus to wed Iole  he passes on his last journey to the lonely top of Oeta, to be consumed  on the funeral pyre.    The Sophoclean marks are clear enough in this play--the tragic moment,  the life and movement, the splendid pathos, breadth of outlook and  fascination of language. Yet there is a serious fault as well, for  Sophocles, like the youngest of dramatists, can strangely enough make  mistakes. The entry of Heracles practically makes the play double,  marring its continuity. The necessary and remorseless sequence of events  which is looked for in dramatic writing is absent. This tendency to  disrupt a whole into parts brilliant but unrelated is a feature of  Euripides' work; it may perhaps find a readier pardon exactly because  Sophocles himself is not able to avoid it always. But the greatest  triumph is the character of Deianeira. It is such as one would rarely  find in warm-blooded Southern peoples. She dreads that loss of her power  over her husband which her waning beauty brings; she is grossly insulted  in being forced to countenance a rival living in the same house after  she has given her husband the best years of her life; yet she hopes on,  and perhaps she would have won him back by her very gentleness. This  creation of a type of almost perfect human nature is the justification  of a poet's existence; it was a saying of Sophocles that he painted men  as they ought to be, Euripides painted them as they are.    The rivalry of the younger poet produced its effect on another play with  which Sophocles gained the first prize in 409. _Philoctetes_, the hero  after whom it is named, had lit the funeral pyre of Heracles on Oeta and  had received from him his unconquerable bow and arrows. When he went  to Troy he was bitten in the foot by a serpent in Tenedos. As the wound  festered and made him loathsome to the army he was left in Lemnos in the  first year of the war. An oracle declared that Troy could not be taken  without him and his arrows; at the end of the siege, as Achilles and  Ajax were dead, Philoctetes, outraged and abandoned, became necessary to  the Greeks. How could they win him over to rejoin them?    Odysseus his bitterest foe takes with him Neoptolemus, the young son  of Achilles. Landing at Lemnos, they find the cave in which Philoctetes  lives, see his rude bed, rough-hewn cup and rags of clothing, and lay  their plot. Neoptolemus is to say that he is Achilles' son, homeward  bound in anger with the Greeks for the loss of his father's arms. As he  was not one of the original confederacy, Philoctetes will trust him. He  is then to obtain the bow and arrows by treachery, for violence will be  useless. The young man's soul rises against the idea of foul play  but Odysseus bids him surrender to shamelessness for one day, to reap  eternal glory. Left alone with the Chorus, composed of sailors from  his ship, Neoptolemus pities the hero's deserted existence, wretched,  famished and half-brutalised. He comes along towards them, creeping  and crying in agony. Seeing them he inquires who they are; Neoptolemus  answers as he had been bidden and wins the heart of Philoctetes who  describes the misery of his life, his desertion and the unquenchable  malady that feeds on him. In return Neoptolemus tells how he was  beguiled to Troy by the prophecy that he should capture it after his  father's death; arriving there he obtained possession of all Achilles'  property except the arms, which Odysseus had won. He pretends to return  to his ship, but Philoctetes implores him to set him once more in  Greece. The great pathos of his appeal wins the youth's consent; they  prepare to depart when a merchant enters with a sailor; from him they  learn that Odysseus with Diomedes are on the way to bring Philoctetes by  force or persuasion to Troy which cannot fall without his aid. The mere  mention of Odysseus' name fills Philoctetes with anger and he retires to  the cave, taking Neoptolemus with him.    When they reappear, a violent attack of the malady prostrates  Philoctetes who gives his bow to Neoptolemus, praying him to burn him  and put an end to his agony. Noticing a strange silence in the youth,  suspicions seem to be aroused in him, but when he falls into a slumber  the Chorus takes a decided part in the action, advising the youth to fly  with the bow and to talk in a whisper for fear of waking the sleeper.  The latter unexpectedly starts out of slumber, again begging to be taken  on board. Again Neoptolemus' heart smites him at the villainy he is  about to commit; he reveals that his real objective is Troy. Betrayed  and defenceless, Philoctetes appeals to Heaven, to the wild things, to  Neoptolemus' better self to restore the bow which is his one means of  procuring him food. A profound pity overcomes Neoptolemus, who is in  the act of returning the weapon when Odysseus appears. Seeing him  Philoctetes knows he is undone. Odysseus invites him to come to Troy of  his own freewill, but is met with a curse; as he refuses to rejoin the  Greeks, Odysseus and Neoptolemus depart bearing with them the bow for  Teucer to use.    Left without that which brought him his daily food Philoctetes bursts  out into a wild lyric dialogue with the Chorus. They advise him to make  terms with Odysseus, but he bids them begone. When they obey, he recalls  them to ask one little boon, a sword. At this moment Neoptolemus runs  in, Odysseus close behind him. He has come to restore the bow he got  by treachery. A violent quarrel ends in the temporary retirement of  Odysseus. Advancing to Philoctetes, Neoptolemus gives him his property;  Philoctetes takes it and is barely restrained from shooting at Odysseus  who appears for a moment, only to take refuge in flight. Neoptolemus  then tells him the whole truth about the prophecy, promising him great  glory if he will go back to Troy which can fall only through him. In  vain Neoptolemus assures him of a perfect cure; nothing will satisfy the  broken man but a full redemption of the promise he had to be landed once  more in Greece. When Neoptolemus tells him that such action will earn  him the hatred of the Greeks, Philoctetes promises him the succour of  his unerring shafts in a conflict.    The action has thus reached a deadlock. The problem is solved by the  sudden appearance of the deified Heracles. He commands his old friend  to go to Troy which he is to sack, and return home in"]]]
