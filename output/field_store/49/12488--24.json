The result of this sudden change in the American horizon was to alter,  almost as quickly, the previous delay in outlining a British policy,  though, presumably, the British Government, while waiting the turn of  events, had given careful consideration to the steps required of it in  just such a situation as had now arisen. Certainly both Lyons and  Russell had been deeply anxious for some time, and had visualized a  proper British policy. The movement in Great Britain now became rapid.  On April 29, Malmesbury, in the Lords, spoke of the news of civil war  which had arrived \"this morning,\" and asked if the Government had tried  to prevent it, or had set on foot negotiations with other powers to  check it. Wodehouse, replying for the Government, stated that the United  States as an independent State would have resented any suggestions from  Great Britain, and that Lyons had been instructed to be extremely  careful about offering advice unless \"asked for by the contending  parties themselves.\" Both speakers commented on the \"ties of blood\"  rendering Britain especially anxious in this American quarrel, and  regretted the conflict[136]. Malmesbury's query as to the approach to  another government, meaning France, was evaded. That some such approach,  in accordance with the earlier advice of Lyons[137], had already been  made, is evident from the fact that three days later, on May 1, Dallas  learned from Russell of the plan of joint action with France, though  what that action would be was not made clear[138]. As Dallas' report was  soon the basis of an American complaint shortly to be considered, the  paragraph referring to this matter is important:         \"The solicitude felt by Lord John Russell as to the effect of       certain measures represented as likely to be adopted by the       President induced him to request me to call at his private       residence yesterday. I did so. He told me that the three       representatives of the Southern confederacy were here[139];       that he had not seen them, but was not unwilling to do so,       _unofficially_; that there existed an understanding between       this government and that of France which would lead both to       take the same course as to recognition, whatever that course       might be; and he then referred to the rumour of a meditated       blockade of Southern ports and their discontinuance as ports       of entry--topics on which I had heard nothing. But as I       informed him that Mr. Adams had apprised me of his intention       to be on his way hither, in the steamship 'Niagara,' which       left Boston on the 1st May, and that he would probably arrive       in less than two weeks, by the 12th or 15th instant, his       lordship acquiesced in the expediency of disregarding mere       rumour, and waiting the full knowledge to be brought by my       successor. The motion, therefore, of Mr. Gregory may be       further postponed, at his lordship's suggestion.\"    May 3rd, Russell held an unofficial interview with the two Southern  commissioners in fact arrived, Yancey and Rost. As reported by  them[140], Russell listened with attention to their representation, but  made no informing comment. They argued the constitutional right of  secession, depicted the firm determination of the South, were confident  of early acquiescence by the North, and especially laid stress on the  Southern desire for free trade. Russell's own report to Lyons on this  interview and on one held six days later, May 9, is in substantial  agreement, but much more is made by him than by the Commissioners of a  question put by Russell as to a Southern plan of reviving the African  slave-trade[141]. Yancey and Rost denied this and asserted \"that they  had prohibited the slave-trade, and did not mean to revive it.\" Their  report to Richmond does not depict this matter as of special  significance in the interview; Russell's report to Lyons lays stress  upon it. The general result of the interview was that Russell listened,  but refused, as to Dallas, to make any pledge on recognition. But the  Southern Commissioners came away with a feeling of confidence and were  content to wait on British action[142].    On this same day, May 3, Russell received from the Attorney-General a  memorandum in reply to a query as to recognizing the belligerency of the  South and as to the right of the South to issue letters of marque and  reprisal. The memorandum notes that Southern privateering would be  dangerous to British commerce with the North, but sees no help for it.  \"The best solution,\" wrote the Attorney-General, \"would be for the  European nations to determine that the war between the two Confederacies  shall be carried on on the principles of 'Justum Bellum,' and shall be  conducted according to the rules of the Treaty of Paris. Recognize the  Southern States as a Belligerent on this condition only[143].\" The next  day, referring to this memorandum, Russell wrote Lyons that the law  officers \"are of opinion that we must consider the Civil War in America  as regular war[144],\" but he does _not_ comment on the legal advice to  press the South to abandon privateering before recognizing her  belligerent rights, for this is the only meaning that can be attached to  the last sentence quoted from the Attorney-General's memorandum. This  advice, however, in view of the opinion that there was \"no help for it,\"  was presumably but a suggestion as to a possible diplomatic manoeuvre  with little confidence that it would succeed. The \"best solution\" was  not the probable one, for the South, without a navy, would not readily  yield its only naval weapon.    In these few days British policy was rapidly matured and announced. The  letter of May 4 to Lyons, stating the Civil War to be a \"regular war\"  was followed on May 6 by a formal instruction giving Lyons advance  notice of the determination reached by the Cabinet to recognize the  belligerent rights of the South. Russell indulged in many expressions of  regret and sympathy, but Lyons was not to conceal that this British  action represented the Government's view of the actualities of the  American situation. Yet while Lyons was not to conceal this opinion he  was not instructed to notify Seward, officially, of the recognition of  Southern belligerency[145]. Here was a correct understanding of the  difficulty of the diplomatic position at Washington, and a permitted  avoidance by Lyons of dangerous ground[146]. Russell was not then aware  of the tenacity with which Seward was to cling to a theory, not yet  clearly formulated for foreign governments, that the Civil War was a  rebellion of peoples rather than a conflict of governments, but he does  appear to have understood the delicacy of formal notification to the  constituted government at Washington[147]. Moreover his instructions  were in line with the British policy of refusing, at present, a  recognition of Southern sovereignty.    On the same day, May 6, a copy of the instructions to Lyons was sent to  Cowley, British Ambassador at Paris, directing him to request France to  join, promptly, in recognizing Southern belligerent rights. Cowley was  also instructed that the blockade and privateering required precautions  by European governments, and it was suggested that France and England  unite in requesting both belligerents to accede to the second and third  articles of the Declaration of Paris[148]. These articles refer to the  exemption from capture, except contraband, of enemy's goods under a  neutral flag, and of neutral goods under an enemy's flag[149]. This day,  also, Russell stated in Parliament that England was about to recognize  the belligerent rights of the South, and spoke of the measure as a  necessary and inevitable one. May 7, Cowley notified Russell that  Thouvenel, the French Foreign Minister, was in complete agreement with  England's policy[150], and on May 9, in a more extended communication,  Cowley sent word of Thouvenel's suggestion that both powers issue a  declaration that they \"intended to abstain from all interference,\" and  that M. de Flahault, French Ambassador at London, had been given  instructions to act in close harmony with Russell[151].    The rapidity of movement in formulating policy in the six days from May  1 to May 6, seems to have taken the British public and press somewhat by  surprise, for there is a lack of newspaper comment even after Russell's  parliamentary announcement of policy on the last-named date. But on May  9 the _Times_ set the fashion of general approval in an editorial  stating that Great Britain was now coming to see the American conflict  in a new light--as a conflict where there were in fact no such ideals  involved as had been earlier attributed to it. Southern rights were now  more clearly understood, and in any case since war, though greatly to be  regretted, was now at hand, it was England's business to keep strictly  out of it and to maintain neutrality[152]. This generalization was no  doubt satisfactory to the public, but in the Government and in  Parliament men who were thinking seriously of specific difficulties  realized that the two main problems immediately confronting a British  neutral policy were privateering and blockade. The South had declared  its _intention_ to use privateers. The North had declared its  _intention_, first to hang those who engaged in privateering, and second  to establish a blockade. Neither declaration had as yet been put  into effect.    The first action of the British Government was directed toward  privateering. On May 1, Russell sent a note to the Lords Commissioners  of the Admiralty calling attention to the Southern plan to issue letters  of marque and reprisal and directing that reinforcements be "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13796"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science - Volume 1, No. (#19)"],[1,"visit and roam over. Such as, like ourselves,  may not hope to sport a caique on the Bosphorus, will do well to  acquaint themselves with the information Aubrey de Vere can give them,  and to suffer their imagination to transport them to scenes among  the fairest and the loveliest on the earth's surface, and which are  presented to them in these volumes as graphically as words can paint  them.    By the possessor of Wordsworth's Greece, where every spot almost, of  the slightest historical interest, is given in a picture on its  pages, these \"Picturesque Sketches\" will be read with the highest  gratification that scenes and descriptions together can supply.

FROM THE GERMAN OF KRUMMACHER.    In brotherly embrace walked the Angel of Sleep and the Angel of Death  upon the earth.    It was evening. They laid themselves down upon a hill not far from the  dwelling of men. A melancholy silence prevailed around, and the chimes  of the evening-bell in the distant hamlet ceased.    Still and silent, as was their custom, sat these two beneficent Genii  of the human race, their arms entwined with cordial familiarity, and  soon the shades of night gathered around them.    Then arose the Angel of Sleep from his moss-grown couch, and strewed  with a gentle hand the invisible grains of slumber. The evening breeze  wafted them to the quiet dwelling of the tired husbandman, infolding  in sweet sleep the inmates of the rural cottage--from the old man upon  the staff, down to the infant in the cradle. The sick forgot their  pain: the mourners their grief; the poor their care. All eyes closed.    His task accomplished, the benevolent Angel of Sleep laid himself  again by the side of his grave brother. \"When Aurora awakes,\"  exclaimed he, with innocent joy, \"men praise me as their friend and  benefactor. Oh! what happiness, unseen and secretly to confer such  benefits! How blessed are we to be the invisible messengers of the  Good Spirit! How beautiful is our silent calling!\"    So spake the friendly Angel of Slumber.    The Angel of Death sat with still deeper melancholy on his brow, and  a tear, such as mortals shed, appeared in his large dark eyes. \"Alas!\"  said he, \"I may not, like thee, rejoice in the cheerful thanks of  mankind; they call me upon the earth their enemy, and joy-killer.\"    \"Oh! my brother,\" replied the gentle Angel of Slumber, \"and will  not the good man, at his awakening, recognize in thee his friend and  benefactor, and gratefully bless thee in his joy? Are we not brothers,  and ministers of one Father?\"    As he spake, the eyes of the Death-Angel beamed with pleasure, and  again did the two friendly Genii cordially embrace each other.           *       *       *       *       *    THE MODERN SCHOOLS OF ATHENS.--I visited, with equal surprise and  satisfaction, an Athenian school, which contained seven hundred  pupils, taken from every class of society. The poorer classes were  gratuitously instructed in reading, writing, and arithmetic, and the  girls in needlework likewise. The progress which the children had made  was very remarkable; but what particularly pleased me was that air of  bright alertness and good-humored energy which belonged to them, and  which made every task appear a pleasure, not a toil. The greatest  punishment which can be inflicted on an Athenian child is exclusion  from school, though but for a day. About seventy of the children  belonged to the higher classes, and were instructed in music, drawing,  the modern languages, the ancient Greek, and geography. Most of them  were at the moment reading Herodotus and Homer. I have never seen  children approaching them in beauty; and was much struck by their  Oriental cast of countenance, their dark complexions, their flashing  eyes, and that expression, at once apprehensive and meditative, which  is so much more remarkable in children than in those of a more mature  age.--_De Vere_.           *       *       *       *       *    At Berlin, the Academy of Sciences has been holding a sitting,  according to its statutes, in honor of the memory of Leibnitz. In the  course of the oration delivered on the occasion, it was stated that  the 4th of August being the fiftieth anniversary of the admission  of Alexander Von Humboldt as a member of the Academy, it had been  resolved, in celebration of the event, to place a marble bust of the  \"Nestor of Science\" in the lecture room of the society."]]]
