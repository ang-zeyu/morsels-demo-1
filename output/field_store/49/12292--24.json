The king awoke in surprise.    57. He said, \"What is the reason for carrying away a sleeping man?\" He  asked them whether they intended to throw away their sovereign.    58. At once he summoned the guards of the palace and ordered the  arrest of the servants; but they protested that they were merely  obeying the orders of the queen.    59. Then the king asked where the queen was who had ordered that. He  had her brought before him, and demanded of her why she wished to  cast him away.    60. The queen answered, reminding him thus: \"My husband, my beloved,  what did you tell me some time ago when you were driving me away?    61. \"Did you not tell me to select whatever I might desire, including  gold and silver, and take it with me? You are my choice.    62. \"Even if I should become very good and very rich, I should still  be without honor before God and the people.    63. \"It would be shameful to the Divine Word for us married people to  separate. You would be taunted by your counsellors for having married  some one beneath you.\"    64. Her reply reminded the king that whatever might happen, they were  married, and should remain together all their lives.    65. \"Forgive me, my wife, light of my eyes! Forgive the wrongs I have  done! I am to blame for the mistake [i.e., for my thoughtlessness].\"    66. From then on, they loved each other the more, and were happy  because they never quarrelled further.        TALE B    THE STORY OF RODOLFO.      Rodolfo was the only son of Felizardo and Prisca, who lived in  Valencia. When Rodolfo was seven years old, he was sent to school,  and proved to be an apt scholar; but his father died within a few  years, and the boy was obliged to abandon his studies because of  poverty. At the suggestion of his mother, Rodolfo one day set out for  the capital, where he sought a place in the palace as servant. In time  he was appointed head steward (mayor-domo) in the royal household. The  king became so fond of this trusty servant, whose bravery, executive  ability, and cleverness he could not help noticing, that finally he  determined to make him his son-in-law by marrying him to the princess  Leocadia. When Rodolfo was offered Leocadio's hand by her father,  however, he respectfully declined the honor, saying that though he  admired the beauty of the princess, he did not admire her character,  and could not take her as his wife. The king was so angry that he  ordered Rodolfo cast into prison; but after a few days' consideration,  he had him released, and promised to pardon him for the insult if  within a month he could bring before the king as his wife just such  a virtuous woman as he had stipulated his wife should be.    Rodolfo left the palace, taking with him only a pair of shoes and  an umbrella. On his way he saw an old man, whom he invited to go  along with him. Shortly afterwards they saw a funeral procession, and  Rodolfo asked his companion whether the man that was to be buried was  still alive. The old man did not reply, because he thought that his  companion was a fool. Outside the city they met many persons planting  highland rice on a mountain-clearing (kaingin). Again Rodolfo spoke,  and asked if the rice that the farmers were planting was already eaten;  but the old man remained silent. In the course of their journey  they reached a shallow river. Rodolfo put on his shoes and waded  across. When he reached the other bank, he removed his shoes again  and carried them in his hand. Next they passed a great plain. When  they became tired from the heat, they rested by the side of the road  under a big tree. Here Rodolfo opened his umbrella, which he had not  used when they were crossing the hot plain. Once more the old man  believed that his companion was crazy.    At last the travellers reached the old man's house, but the old man did  not invite Rodolfo to spend the night with him. Rodolfo went into the  house, however, for he saw that a young woman lived in the house. This  was Estela, the old man's daughter, who received the stranger very  kindly. That night, when Estela set the table for supper, she gave  to her father the head and neck of the chicken, the wings to her  mother, the body to Rodolfo, and the legs to herself. After eating  their meal, the old man and his wife left Estela and Rodolfo together  in the dining-room. Rodolfo expressed his love for her, for he had  already recognized her worth. When she found that he was in earnest,  she said that she would accept him if her parents consented to the  marriage. Then they joined the old couple in the main room; but there  the father scolded her for showing hospitality to a visitor whom he  considered a fool. He also felt insulted for having been given only  the head and neck of the chicken. Accordingly the old man told his  daughter how Rodolfo had foolishly asked him if the person to be buried  was still alive, and whether the rice that the farmers were planting  on the mountain-clearing had already been eaten. He also mentioned  the fact that Rodolfo wore his shoes only when crossing the river,  and that he had opened his umbrella only when they were in the shade  of the tree. Estela, in reply, cleverly explained to her father the  meaning of all Rodolfo had said and done. \"The memory of a man who has  done good during his lifetime will never be forgotten. Rodolfo wished  to know whether the man to be buried was kind to his fellow-men. If  he was, he will always be remembered, and he is not dead. When Rodolfo  asked you whether the rice which the farmers were planting was already  eaten, he wished to know if those farmers had borrowed so much rice  from their landlords that the next harvest would only be enough to pay  it back. In a river it is impossible to see the thorns which may hurt  one's feet, so it is wise to wear shoes while crossing a river. The  idea of opening an umbrella under a tree is a very good one, because  it forms a protection against falling branches and fruits. I will  tell you why I divided the chicken as I did. I gave you the head  and neck because you are the head of the family; the wings I gave my  mother because she took care of me in my childhood; the body I gave  to Rodolfo, because it is courteous to please a visitor; the legs I  kept myself, because I am your feet and hands.\"    The anger of Estela's father was pacified by her explanation. He  was now convinced that Rodolfo was not a fool, but a wise man, and  he invited Rodolfo to live with them. Rodolfo staid and helped with  all the work about the house and in the field. At last, when the old  man realized that Rodolfo loved Estela, he gave his consent to their  marriage; and the next day they became husband and wife.    After his marriage, Rodolfo returned to Valencia, leaving Estela at  her home in Babilonia, and reported to the king that he had found and  taken as his wife a virtuous woman,--The rest of the story turns on the  \"chastity-wager\" motif, and ends with the establishment of the purity  of Rodolfo's wife. (For this motif, constituting a whole story, see  \"The Golden Lock,\" No. 30.)      An examination of the five representatives of this cycle of the \"Clever  Lass\" in the Philippines reveals at least nine distinct problems  (tasks or riddles) to be solved. For most of these, parallels may be  found in other Oriental and in Occidental stories.    (1) Problem: catching waves of the sea. Solution: demanding rope of  sand for the work. This identical problem and solution are found in  a North Borneo story, \"Ginas and the Rajah\" (Evans, 468-469). In the  \"Maha-ummagga-jataka,\" No. 546, a series of nineteen tasks is set the  young sage Mahosadha. One of these is to make a rope of sand. The wise  youth cleverly sent some spokesmen to ask the king for a sample of the  old rope, so that the new would not vary from the old. See also Child,  1 : 10-11, for a South Siberian story containing the counter-demand  for thread of sand to make shoes from stone.    (2) Problem: making many kinds of food from one small bird, or twelve  portions from mosquito. Solution: requiring king to make stove, pan,  and bolo (or twelve forks) from needle (pin). Analogous to this task  is Bolte and Polivka's motif B3 (2 : 349), the challenge to weave  a cloth out of two threads. Bolte and Polivka enumerate thirty-five  European folk-tales containing their motif B3.    (3) Problem: putting large squash whole into narrow-necked  jar. Solution: hero grows squash in the jar (and sometimes demands  that king remove the squash without breaking either it or the jar). I  know of no other folk-tale occurrences of this task; it is not found  in any of the European stories of this cycle, and may be an addition  of the Tagalog narrators. It is a common enough trick, however,  to grow a squash or cucumber in a small-necked bottle.    (4) Problem: getting milk from bull. Solution: hero tells king that  his father has given birth to a child. Compare \"Jataka,\" No. 546  (tr. by Cowell and Rouse, 6 : 167-168), in which the king sends his  fattened bull to East Market-town with this message: \"Here is the  king's royal bull, in calf. Deliver him, and send him back with the  calf, or else there is a fine of a thousand pieces.\" The solution  of this difficulty is the same as above. See also Child, 1 : 10-11,  for almost identical situation. This problem and No. 1 are to be  found in a Tibetan tale (Ralston 2, 138, 140-141).    (5) Problem: selling lamb for a specified sum of money, and returning  both animal and coin. Solution: heroine sells only the wool.    Two of these problems, (3) and (5), are soluble, and belong in kind  with the \"halb-geritten\" motif, where the heroine is ordered to come  to the king not clothed and not naked, not walking and not riding,  not in the road and not out of the road, etc. The other three problems  are not solved at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/830"],[0,"The Argonautica (#18)"],[1,"not, if thou wilt strike with thy  shaft Aeetes' daughter.\"    (ll. 154-166) She spoke, and he gathered up his dice, and having  well counted them all threw them into his mother's gleaming lap. And  straightway with golden baldric he slung round him his quiver from where  it leant against a tree-trunk, and took up his curved bow. And he fared  forth through the fruitful orchard of the palace of Zeus. Then he passed  through the gates of Olympus high in air; hence is a downward path from  heaven; and the twin poles rear aloft steep mountain tops the highest  crests of earth, where the risen sun grows ruddy with his first beams.  And beneath him there appeared now the life-giving earth and cities of  men and sacred streams of rivers, and now in turn mountain peaks and the  ocean all around, as he swept through the vast expanse of air.    (ll. 167-193) Now the heroes apart in ambush, in a back-water of the  river, were met in council, sitting on the benches of their ship. And  Aeson's son himself was speaking among them; and they were listening  silently in their places sitting row upon row: \"My friends, what pleases  myself that will I say out; it is for you to bring about its fulfilment.  For in common is our task, and common to all alike is the right of  speech; and he who in silence withholds his thought and his counsel, let  him know that it is he alone that bereaves this band of its home-return.  Do ye others rest here in the ship quietly with your arms; but I will  go to the palace of Aeetes, taking with me the sons of Phrixus and two  comrades as well. And when I meet him I will first make trial with  words to see if he will be willing to give up the golden fleece for  friendship's sake or not, but trusting to his might will set at nought  our quest. For so, learning his frowardness first from himself, we will  consider whether we shall meet him in battle, or some other plan shall  avail us, if we refrain from the war-cry. And let us not merely  by force, before putting words to the test, deprive him of his own  possession. But first it is better to go to him and win his favour by  speech. Oftentimes, I ween, does speech accomplish at need what prowess  could hardly catty through, smoothing the path in manner befitting. And  he once welcomed noble Phrixus, a fugitive from his stepmother's wiles  and the sacrifice prepared by his father. For all men everywhere, even  the most shameless, reverence the ordinance of Zeus, god of strangers,  and regard it.\"    (ll. 194-209) Thus he spake, and the youths approved the words of  Aeson's son with one accord, nor was there one to counsel otherwise.  And then he summoned to go with him the sons of Phrixus, and Telamon and  Augeias; and himself took Hermes' wand; and at once they passed forth  from the ship beyond the reeds and the water to dry land, towards the  rising ground of the plain. The plain, I wis, is called Circe's; and  here in line grow many willows and osiers, on whose topmost branches  hang corpses bound with cords. For even now it is an abomination with  the Colchians to burn dead men with fire; nor is it lawful to place  them in the earth and raise a mound above, but to wrap them in untanned  oxhides and suspend them from trees far from the city. And so earth has  an equal portion with air, seeing that they bury the women; for that is  the custom of their land.    (ll. 210-259) And as they went Hera with friendly thought spread a thick  mist through the city, that they might fare to the palace of Aeetes  unseen by the countless hosts of the Colchians. But soon when from  the plain they came to the city and Aeetes' palace, then again Hera  dispersed the mist. And they stood at the entrance, marvelling at the  king's courts and the wide gates and columns which rose in ordered lines  round the walls; and high up on the palace a coping of stone rested on  brazen triglyphs. And silently they crossed the threshold. And close by  garden vines covered with green foliage were in full bloom, lifted  high in air. And beneath them ran four fountains, ever-flowing, which  Hephaestus had delved out. One was gushing with milk, one with wine,  while the third flowed with fragrant oil; and the fourth ran with water,  which grew warm at the setting of the Pleiads, and in turn at their  rising bubbled forth from the hollow rock, cold as crystal. Such then  were the wondrous works that the craftsman-god Hephaestus had fashioned  in the palace of Cytaean Aeetes. And he wrought for him bulls with feet  of bronze, and their mouths were of bronze, and from them they breathed  out a terrible flame of fire; moreover he forged a plough of unbending  adamant, all in one piece, in payment of thanks to Helios, who had taken  the god up in his chariot when faint from the Phlegraean fight. [1301]  And here an inner-court was built, and round it were many well-fitted  doors and chambers here and there, and all along on each side was  a richly-wrought gallery. And on both sides loftier buildings stood  obliquely. In one, which was the loftiest, lordly Aeetes dwelt with his  queen; and in another dwelt Apsyrtus, son of Aeetes, whom a Caucasian  nymph, Asterodeia, bare before he made Eidyia his wedded wife, the  youngest daughter of Tethys and Oceanus. And the sons of the Colchians  called him by the new name of Phaethon, [1302] because he outshone  all the youths. The other buildings the handmaidens had, and the two  daughters of Aeetes, Chalciope and Medea. Medea then [they found] going  from chamber to chamber in search of her sister, for Hera detained her  within that day; but beforetime she was not wont to haunt the palace,  but all day long was busied in Hecate's temple, since she herself was  the priestess of the goddess. And when she saw them she cried aloud,  and quickly Chalciope caught the sound; and her maids, throwing down at  their feet their yarn and their thread, rushed forth all in a throng.  And she, beholding her sons among them, raised her hands aloft through  joy; and so they likewise greeted their mother, and when they saw her  embraced her in their gladness; and she with many sobs spoke thus:    (ll. 260-267) \"After all then, ye were not destined to leave me in  your heedlessness and to wander far; but fate has turned you back. Poor  wretch that I am! What a yearning for Hellas from some woeful madness  seized you at the behest of your father Phrixus. Bitter sorrows for  my heart did he ordain when dying. And why should ye go to the city of  Orchomenus, whoever this Orchomenus is, for the sake of Athamas' wealth,  leaving your mother alone to bear her grief?\"    (ll. 268-274) Such were her words; and Aeetes came forth last of all  and Eidyia herself came, the queen of Aeetes, on hearing the voice of  Chalciope; and straightway all the court was filled with a throng. Some  of the thralls were busied with a mighty bull, others with the axe were  cleaving dry billets, and others heating with fire water for the baths;  nor was there one who relaxed his toil, serving the king.    (ll. 275-298) Meantime Eros passed unseen through the grey mist, causing  confusion, as when against grazing heifers rises the gadfly, which  oxherds call the breese. And quickly beneath the lintel in the porch  he strung his bow and took from the quiver an arrow unshot before,  messenger of pain. And with swift feet unmarked he passed the threshold  and keenly glanced around; and gliding close by Aeson's son he laid the  arrow-notch on the cord in the centre, and drawing wide apart with both  hands he shot at Medea; and speechless amazement seized her soul. But  the god himself flashed back again from the high-roofed hall, laughing  loud; and the bolt burnt deep down in the maiden's heart like a flame;  and ever she kept darting bright glances straight up at Aeson's son, and  within her breast her heart panted fast through anguish, all remembrance  left her, and her soul melted with the sweet pain. And as a poor woman  heaps dry twigs round a blazing brand--a daughter of toil, whose task is  the spinning of wool, that she may kindle a blaze at night beneath her  roof, when she has waked very early--and the flame waxing wondrous great  from the small brand consumes all the twigs together; so, coiling round  her heart, burnt secretly Love the destroyer; and the hue of her soft  cheeks went and came, now pale, now red, in her soul's distraction.    (ll. 299-303) Now when the thralls had laid a banquet ready before  them, and they had refreshed themselves with warm baths, gladly did they  please their souls with meat and drink. And thereafter Aeetes questioned  the sons of his daughter, addressing them with these words:    (ll. 304-316) \"Sons of my daughter and of Phrixus, whom beyond all  strangers I honoured in my halls, how have ye come returning back to  Aea? Did some calamity cut short your escape in the midst? Ye did not  listen when I set before you the boundless length of the way. For I  marked it once, whirled along in the chariot of my father Helios, when  he was bringing my sister Circe to the western land and we came to the  shore of the Tyrrhenian mainland, where even now she abides, exceeding  far from Colchis. But what pleasure is there in words? Do ye tell  me plainly what has been your fortune, and who these men are, your  companions, and where from your hollow ship ye came ashore.\"    (ll. 317-319) Such were his questions, and Argus, before all his  brethren, being fearful for the mission of Aeson's son, gently replied,  for he was the elder-born:    (ll. 320-366) \"Aeetes, that ship forthwith stormy blasts tore asunder,  and ourselves, crouching on the beams, a wave drove on to the beach of  the isle of Enyalius [1303] in the murky night; and some god preserved  us. For even the birds of Ares that haunted the desert isle beforetime,  not even them did we find. But these men had driven them off, having  landed from their ship on the day before; and the will of Zeus taking"]]]
