I sold that because it was too confining and returned to the  carpenter's trade. I still practice my trade some now.    \"I have not had to ask help from anyone. I have helped others. I own my  home and I sent my daughter to Fisk University where she was graduated.  While there she met a young man and they were later married and now live  in Chicago. They own their home and are doing well.    \"In my work in the ministry I am trying to teach my people to have  higher ideals. We have to bring our race to that high ideal of race  integrity. I am trying to keep the negro from thinking he is hated by  the upper class of white people. What the negro needs is  self-consciousness to the extent that he aspires to the higher  principles in order to stand on an equal plane in attainment but not in  a social way.    \"At present, the negro's ideals are too low for him to visualize the  evils involved in race mixture. He needs to be lifted in his own  estimation and learn that a race cannot be estimated by other races--by  anything else but their own ideals.    \"The younger generation is off on a tangent. They'll have to hit  something before they stop.    \"The salvation of our people--of all people--white and colored, is  leadership. We've got to have vision and try to give the people vision.  Not to live for ourselves but for all. The present generation is  selfish. The life should flow out and as it flows out it makes room for  more life. If it does not flow out, it congeals and ferments.  Selfishness is just like damming a stream.    \"I think Woodrow Wilson won the World War with his fourteen points of  democracy.

In the room where I interviewed him, were a piano, a radio,  many ferns, a wool rug, chairs, divan, and a table on which were books  including a set of the Standard History of the World. I asked if he had  read the history and he replied, \"Not all of it but I have read the  volumes pertaining to the neolithic age.\"    On the walls were several pictures and two tapestries.    The house was a good frame one and electric current was used.

I wer born in  Hardman County, Tennessee. My own daddy was a Union soldier and my mama  was a cook fer the mistress. We belonged to Miss Viney and Dr. Jim Mass.  My daddy drawed a pension fer bein a soldier till he die. He went off to  wait on some men he know. Then he met some men wanted him to join the  army. They said then he get paid and get a bounty. No maam he never got  a red cent. He come back broke as he went off. He say he turned loose  soon as he could and mustered out and lef them right now. He had no time  to ax em no questions. That what he said! We stayed on that place till I  was big nuf to do a days work. We had no other place to go. There was  plenty land and no stock. Houses to stay in got scarce. If a family had  a place to stay at when that war ended he counted hisself lucky I tell  you. Heap of black an white jes ramlin round through the woods an over  the roads huntin a little to eat or a little sumpin to do. If you stay  in the field workin about puttin back the fences an round yo own house  you wouldn't be hurt.    \"The Ku Kluxes war not huntin work theirselves. They was keepin order at  the gatherins and down the public roads. Folks had came toted off all  the folks made in the crops till they don't call nuthin stealin'. They  whooped em and made em ride on rails. I don't know all the carrings on  did take place. I sho would been scared if I seed em comin to me. We  left Dr. Mass and went to Grain, Tennessee. I had three sisters and  half-brothers. I don't remember how many, some dead. I farmed all my  life. Everybody said the land was so much better and newer out in  Arkansas. When I married I come to Tomberlin and worked fer Sam Dardnne  bout twelve years. Then I rented from Jim Hicks at England. I rented  from one of the Carlley boys and Jim Neelam.

Belle, Forrest City, Arkansas  Age: 77      \"I was born near Knoxville, Georgia. My mother was a professional pastry  cook. She was a house woman during slavery. She was owned by Lewis Hicks  and Ann Hicks. They had Saluda, Mary, Lewis, and Oscar.    \"Mother was never sold. Mr. Hicks reared her. She was three-fourths  Indian. Her father was George Hicks. Gordon carried him to Texas. Mr.  Bob Gordon was mean. He asked Mr. Hicks to keep mother and auntie while  he went to Texas, Mr. Gordon was so mean. My mother had two little girls  but my sister died while small.    \"I never saw any one sold. I never saw a soldier. But I noticed the  grown people whispering many times. Mother explained it to me, they had  some news from the War. Aunt Jane said she saw them pass in gangs. I  heard her say, 'Did you see the soldiers pass early this morning?' I was  asleep. Sometimes I was out at play when they passed.    \"Master Hicks called us all up at dinner one day to the big house. He  told us, 'You are free as I am.' I never had worked any then. No, they  cried and went on to their homes. Aunt Jane was bad to speak out, she  was so much Indian. She had three children. She went to another place to  live. She was in search of her husband and thought he might be there at  Ft. Valley.    \"Mother stayed on another year. Mr. Hicks was good to us. None of the  children ever worked till they was ten or twelve years old. He had a lot  of slaves and about twenty-five children on the place growing. He had  just a big plantation. He had a special cook, Aunt Mariah, to cook for  the field hands. They eat like he did. Master Hicks would examine their  buckets and a great big split basket. If they didn't have enough to eat  he would have her cook more and send to them. They had nice victuals to  eat. He had a bell to ring for all the children to be put to bed at  sundown and they slept late. He said, 'Let them grow.' Their diet was  milk and bread and eggs. We had duck eggs, guinea eggs, goose eggs, and  turkey eggs.    \"I don't know what all the slaves had but mother had feather beds. They  saved all kind of feathers to make pillows and bed and chair cushions.  We always had a pet pig about our place. Master Hicks kept a drove of  pea-fowls. He had cows, goats, sheep. We children loved the lambs.  Elvira attended to the milk. She had some of the girls and boys to milk.  Uncle Dick, mother's brother, was Mr. Hicks' coachman. He was raised on  the place too.    \"I think Master Hicks and his family was French, but, though they were  light-skin people. They had light hair too, I think.    \"One day a Frenchman (white) that was a doctor come to call. My Aunt  Jane said to me, 'He is your papa. That is your papa.' I saw him many  times after that. I am considered eight-ninth white race. One little  girl up at the courthouse asked me a question and I told her she was too  young to know about such sin. (This girl was twenty-four years old and  the case worker's stenographer.)    \"Master Hicks had Uncle Patrick bury his silver and gold in the woods.  It was in a trunk. The hair and hide was still on the trunk when the War  ceased. He used his money to pay the slaves that worked on his place  after freedom.    \"I went to school to a white man from January till May and mother paid  him one dollar a month tuition. After I married I went to school three  terms. I married quite young. Everyone did that far back.    \"I married at Aunt Jane's home. We got married and had dinner at one or  two o'clock. Very quiet. Only a few friends and my relatives. I wore a  green wool traveling dress. It was trimmed in black velvet and black  beads. I married in a hat. At about seven o'clock we went to ny  husband's home at Perry, Georgia. He owned a new buggy. We rode thirty  miles. We had a colored minister to marry us. He was a painter and a  fine provider. He died. I had no children.    \"I came to Forrest City 1874. There was three dry-goods and grocery  stores and two saloons here--five stores in all. I come alone. Aunt Jane  and Uncle Sol had migrated here. My mother come with me. There was one  railroad through here. I belong to the Baptist church.    \"I married the second time at Muskogee, Oklahoma. My husband lived out  there. He was Indian-African. He was a Baptist minister. We never had  any children. I never had a child. They tell me now if I had married  dark men I would maybe had children. I married very light men both  times.    \"I washed and ironed, cooked and kept house. I sewed for the public,  black and white.

Let my soul be called [into the presence], and let it be    found by the side of the lords of right and truth. I have come into    the City of God, the region which existed in primeval time, with [my]    soul, and with [my] double, and with [my] translucent form, to dwell    in this land. The God thereof is the lord of right and truth, he is    the lord of the _tchefau_ food of the gods, and he is most holy. His    land draweth unto itself every land; the South cometh sailing down the    river thereto, and the North, steered thither by winds, cometh daily    to make festival therein according to the command of the God thereof,    who is the Lord of peace therein. And doth he not say, 'The happiness    thereof is a care unto me'? The god who dwelleth therein worketh right    and truth; unto him that doeth these things he giveth old age, and to    him that followeth after them rank and honour, until at length he    attaineth unto a happy funeral and burial in the Holy Land\" (_i.e._,    the underworld).    The deceased, having recited these words of prayer and adoration to  R[=a], the symbol of Almighty God, and to his son Osiris, next \"cometh  forth into the Hall of Ma[=a]ti, that he may be separated from every sin  which he hath done, and may behold the faces of the gods.\" [Footnote:  This quotation is from the title of Chapter CXXV. of the Book of the  Dead.] From the earliest times the Ma[=a]ti were the two goddesses Isis  and Nephthys, and they were so called because they represented the ideas  of straightness, integrity, righteousness, what is right, the truth, and  such like; the word Ma[=a]t originally meant a measuring reed or stick.  They were supposed either to sit in the Hall of Ma[=a]t outside the  shrine of Osiris, or to stand by the side of this god in the shrine; an  example of the former position will be seen in the Papyrus of Ani (Plate  31), and of the latter in the Papyrus of Hunefer (Plate 4). The original  idea of the Hall of Ma[=a]t or Ma[=a]ti was that it contained forty-two  gods; a fact which we may see from the following passage in the  Introduction to Chapter CXXV. of the Book of the Dead. The deceased says  to Osiris:--      \"Homage to thee, O thou great God, thou Lord of the two Ma[=a]t    goddesses! I have come to thee, O my Lord, and I have made myself to    come hither that I may behold thy beauties. I know thee, and I know    thy name, and I know the names of the two and forty gods who live with    thee in this Hall of Ma[=a]ti, who live as watchers of sinners and who    feed upon their blood on that day when the characters (_or_ lives) of    men are reckoned up (_or_ taken into account) in the presence of the    god Un-nefer. Verily, God of the Rekhti-Merti (_i.e._, the twin    sisters of the two eyes), the Lord of the city of Ma[=a]ti is thy    name. Verily I have come to thee, and I have brought Ma[=a]t unto    thee, and I have destroyed wickedness.\"    The deceased then goes on to enumerate the sins or offences which he has  not committed; and he concludes by saying: \"I am pure; I am pure; I am  pure; I am pure. My purity is the purity of the great Bennu which is in  the city of Suten-henen (Heracleopolis), for, behold., I am the nostrils  of the God of breath, who maketh all mankind to live on the day when the  Eye of R[=a] is full in Annu (Heliopolis) at the end of the second month  of the season PERT. [Footnote: _i.e._, the last day of the sixth month  of the Egyptian year, called by the Copta Mekhir.] I have seen the Eye  of R[=a] when it was full in Annu; [Footnote: The allusion here seems to  be to the Summer or Winter Solstice.] therefore let not evil befall me  either in this land or in this Hall of Ma[=a]ti, because I, even I, know  the names of the gods who are therein.\"    Now as the gods who live in the Hall of Ma[=a]t with Osiris are two and  forty in number, we should expect that two and forty sins or offences  would be mentioned in the addresses which the deceased makes to them;  but this is not the case, for the sins enumerated in the Introduction  never reach this number. In the great illustrated papyri of the XVIIIth  and XIXth dynasties we find, however, that notwithstanding the fact that  a large number of sins, which the deceased declares he has not  committed, are mentioned in the Introduction, the scribes and artists  added a series of negative statements, forty-two in number, which they  set out in a tabular form. This, clearly, is an attempt to make the sins  mentioned equal in number to the gods of the Hall of Ma[=a]t, and it  would seem as if they preferred to compose an entirely new form of this  section of the one hundred and twenty-fifth chapter to making any  attempt to add to or alter the older section. The artists, then,  depicted a Hall of Ma[=a]t, the doors of which are wide open, and the  cornice of which is formed of uraei and feathers, symbolic of Ma[=a]t.  Over the middle of the cornice is a seated deity with hands extended,  the right over the Eye of Horus, and the left over a pool. At the end of  the Hall are seated the goddesses of Ma[=a]t, _i.e._, Isis and Nephthys,  the deceased adoring Osiris who is seated on a throne, a balance with  the heart of the deceased in one scale, and the feather, symbolic of  Ma[=a]t, in the other, and Thoth painting a large feather. In this Hall  sit the forty-two gods, and as the deceased passes by each, the deceased  addresses him by his name and at the same time declares that he has not  committed a certain sin. An examination of the different papyri shows  that the scribes often made mistakes in writing this list of gods and  list of sins, and, as the result, the deceased is made to recite before  one god the confession which strictly belongs to another. Inasmuch, as  the deceased always says after pronouncing the name of each god, \"I have  not done\" such and such a sin, the whole group of addresses has been  called the \"Negative Confession.\" The fundamental ideas of religion and  morality which underlie this Confession are exceedingly old, and we may  gather from it with tolerable clearness what the ancient Egyptian  believed to constitute his duty towards God and towards his neighbour.    It is impossible to explain, the fact that forty-two gods only are  addressed, and equally so to say why this number was adopted. Some have  believed that the forty-two gods represented each a name of Egypt, and  much support is given to this view by the fact that most of the lists of  names make the number to be forty-two; but then, again, the lists do not  agree. The classical authors differ also, for by some of these writers  the names are said to be thirty-six in number, and by others forty-six  are enumerated. These differences may, however, be easily explained, for  the central administration may at any time have added to or taken from  the number of names for fiscal or other considerations, and we shall  probably be correct in assuming that at the time the Negative Confession  was drawn up in the tabular form in which we meet it in the XVIIIth  dynasty the names were forty-two in number. Support is also lent to this  view by the fact that the earliest form of the Confession, which forms  the Introduction to Chapter CXXV., mentions less than forty sins.  Incidentally we may notice that the forty-two gods are subservient to  Osiris, and that they only occupy a subordinate position in the Hall of  Judgment, for it is the result of the weighing of the heart of the  deceased in the balance that decides his future. Before passing to the  description of the Hall of Judgment where the balance is set, it is  necessary to give a rendering of the Negative Confession which,  presumably, the deceased recites before his heart is weighed in the  balance; it is made from the Papyrus of Nu.
