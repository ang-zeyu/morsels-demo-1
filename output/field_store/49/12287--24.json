Wind North-East, East-North-East;  course South 60 degrees 30 minutes West; distance 59 miles; latitude 23  degrees 6 minutes South; Isle of Cape Frio North 60 degrees East, 4  leagues.    Sunday, 13th. First and Latter parts a Genteel Sea breeze and Clear  weather, the Middle Calm. P.M. standing along Shore for Rio De Janeiro  observed that the land on the Sea Coast is high and Mountainous, and the  shore forms some small Bays or Coves wherein are Sandy Beaches. At 8  Shortned Sail; the Sugar Loaf Hill at the West Entrance to Rio De Janeiro  West-North-West, distant 4 or 5 leagues, at the same time was abreast of  2 Small rocky Islands, that lie about 4 Miles from the Shore. At 9 a.m.  Sprung up a light breeze at South-East, at which time we made Sail for  the Harbour, and sent the Pinnace with a Lieutenant before us up to the  city of Rio De Janeiro, to acquaint the Vice Roy with the reason that  induced us to put in here, which was to procure Water and other  refreshments, and to desire the Assistance of a Pilot to bring us into  proper Anchoring ground; at Noon Standing in for the Harbour.    [At Rio Janeiro.]    ARRIVAL AT RIO DE JANEIRO, Monday, 14th. Moderate Sea and Low breezes and  fine pleasant weather. At 5 p.m. Anchored in 5 fathoms just above the  Isle of Cobras, which lies before the City of Rio De Janeiro. A little  before we Anchor'd the Pinnace return'd and informed me that the Vice Roy  had thought proper to detain the Officer until I went ashore. Soon after  we Anchored a Boat came on board bringing several of the Vice Roy's  Officers, who asked many Questions in respect to the Ship: Cargo, from  whence she came, Number of Guns, Men, etc., all of which was Answered to  their satisfaction. They told me it was the Custom of the Port to Detain  the first Officer that came from any Ship on her first Arrival until a  Boat from the Vice Roy had Visited her; that my Officer would be sent on  board as soon as they got on shore, which was accordingly done. About  this time a Boat filled with Soldiers kept rowing about the Ship, which  had orders, as I afterwards understood, not to Suffer any one of the  Officers or Gentlemen, except myself, to go out of the Ship. In the  Morning I waited upon the Vice Roy and obtained leave to purchase  Provisions, Refreshments, etc., for the Ship, but obliged me to employ a  person to buy them for me under a pretence that it was the Custom of the  Place, and he likewise insisted (notwithstanding all I could say to the  contrary), on putting a Soldier into the Boats that brought anything to  or from the Ship, alledging that it was the Orders of his Court, and they  were such as he could not Dispence with, and this indignity I was obliged  to submit to, otherwise I could not have got the supplys I wanted; being  willing, as much as in me lay, to avoid all manner of Disputes that might  cause the least delay, and at the same time to Convince him that we did  not come here to Trade, as I believe he imagined--for he Certainly did  not believe a word about our being bound to the Southward to observe the  Transit of Venus, but looked upon it only as an invented story to cover  some other design we must be upon, for he could form no other Idea of  that Phenomenon (after I had explained it to him), than the North Star  Passing through the South Pole; these were his own words. He would not  permit the Gentlemen to reside ashore during our Stay here, nor permit  Mr. Banks to go into the country to gather plants, etc.; but not the  least hint was given me at this time that no one of the Gentlemen was to  come out of the Ship but myself, or that I was to be put under a Guard  when I did come; but this I was soon Convinced of after I took my leave  of His Excellency and found that an Officer was to attend upon me  whereever I went, which at first the Vice Roy pretended was only meant as  a Complement, and to order me all the Assistance I wanted. This day the  People were Employed in unbending the Sails, in fitting and rigging the  Spare Topmasts in the room of the others, and getting on shore Empty  Water Casks.    Tuesday, 15th. Fine pleasant weather. Received on board fresh Beef and  Greens for the Ship's Company, with which they was served every Day  During our Stay here. Got all the Empty Casks on shore, and set the  Coopers to Work to repair them; Heeld and Boot Topt the Starboard side.    Wednesday, 16th. Set up the Forge to repair the Iron Work; the People  employed in Heeling and Boot Topping the Larboard side, Blacking the  Yards, etc.    Thursday, 17th. Set some People to repair the Sails and the Caulkers to  Caulk the Ship; the rest of the People employed in the Hold and about the  Rigging. For 3 days past I have remonstrated to the Vice Roy and his  Officers against his putting a Guard into my Boat, thinking I could not  Answer it to the Admiralty the tamely submitting to such a Custom, which,  when practiced in its full force, must bring Disgrace to the British  Flag. On the other hand, I was loath to enter into Disputes, seeing how  much I was like to be delay'd and imbarrassed in getting the supplys I  wanted, for it was with much difficulty that I obtained leave for one of  my People to attend the Market to buy necessaries for my Table and to  assist the Agent to buy the things for the Ship. Having gained this Point  and settled everything with the Agent in regard to what was wanting for  the Ship, I resolved, rather than be made a Prisoner in my own Boat, not  to go any more ashore unless I could do it without having a Soldier put  into the Boat, as had hitherto been done; and thinking that the Vice Roy  might lay under some Mistake, which on proper Application might be  clear'd up, I therefore drew up a Memorial stating the whole case and  sent to the Vice Roy this afternoon; and thus a Paper War commenced  between me and His Excellency, wherein I had no other Advantage than the  racking his invention to find reasons for treating us in the manner he  did, for he never would relax the least from any one point.    Friday, 18th. This day I received an Answer to my Memorial, wherein he  tells me, amongst other things, that if I think it hard submitting to the  Customs of this Port I may leave it when I please; but this did not suit  my purpose at present, but I resolved to make my stay as short as  possible. I must own that the Memorial of the Vice Roy's was well drawn  up and very much to the Purpose, which is more than I can say of any of  the subsequent ones.    Saturday, 19th. Close cloudy weather. Employed getting aboard Rum, Water,  and other necessaries. Caulking and refitting the Ship. Punished John  Thurman, Seaman, with 12 Lashes for refusing to assist the Sailmaker in  repairing the Sails.    Sunday, 20th. First part cloudy weather; the Middle very hard Storms of  Wind and Rain; the Latter moderate, with rain. This Afternoon sent  Lieutenant Hicks in the Pinnace with an Answer to the Vice Roy's  Memorial, with orders not to Suffer a Soldier to be put into the Boat;  upon which the Guard Boat attended him to the Landing Place and reported  it to the Vice Roy, who refused to receive the Memorial, and ordered Mr.  Hicks on board Again; but in the Meantime they had put a Guard into the  Boat, which Mr. Hicks insisted should be order'd out, that he might  return on board in the same manner as he came, without a Guard; and upon  his refusing to return other way, all the Crew were by Arm'd force taken  out of the Boat (though they gave no provocation nor made the least  resistance) and hurried to Prison, where they remained until the next  day. Mr. Hicks was then put into one of their Boats, and brought on board  under the Custody of a Guard. Immediately upon my hearing of this I wrote  to the Vice Roy demanding my Boat and Crew and his Excellency's reason  for detaining her, and inclosed the Memorial he had before refused to  receive. This I sent by a petty Officer, as I had never objected against  a Guard being put into any of my Boats wherein was no Commissioned  Officer. He was admitted ashore and delivered the Letter, and was told an  Answer would be sent the next day. This evening, between 8 and 9 o'Clock,  came on an Excessive hard storm of Wind and Rain, the Longboat coming on  board the same time with 4 Pipes of Rum in her. The rope they got hold of  broke, and she went a Drift. The Yawl was immediately sent after her; but  the Longboat filling with Water, they brought her to a Grapnel and left  her, and the Yawl with the People got on board about 3 in the morning.  Early this Morning I sent to the Vice Roy to acquaint him with the loss  of our Boat, to desire leave and the Assistance of a Shore Boat to look  after her, and at the same time to demand the Pinnace and her Crew. After  some time the whole was granted, and we was so fortunate as to find the  Longboat the same Day, and likewise the 4 Pipes of Rum; but every other  thing that was in her was lost.    Monday, 21st. This Morning I received his Excellency's Answer to my last  Memorial and Letter. In his Letter he owns there was some indecency in  Detaining the Boat, but lays the Blame to my Officer, who only Executed  the orders I gave him with Spirit. In one part of his Memorial he says  that from the Built of the Ship and other Circumstances he Doubts that  she is the King's. This I thought proper to Answer in Writing by telling  his Excellency that I was ready to produce my Commission. Rain the most  part of this Day.    Tuesday, 22nd. Moderate breezes, with frequent Showers of Rain. Employed  getting on board Water, Provisions, etc. Caulking the Ship and repairing  the Sails.    Wednesday, 23rd. Fine pleasant weather. Employed as before and setting up  the Rigging. This day I received from the Vice-Roy an Answer to my last  Memorial, wherein he still keeps up his Doubts that she is not a King's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8107"],[0,"The Principal Navigations, Voyages, Traffiques and Discoveries of the English (#18)"],[1,"felles of beastes. Their women ware prety wealtes of leather,  euery one a greate manye whiche (as it is sayde) they begge of suche menne  as haue lien with them. So that the moe she hath, the more she is estemed,  as a deinty derling beloued of many. The Machlies dwelling aboute the  mershe of Tritonides, vse to shaue their fore parte of their heade, and the  Anses their hindre parte. The maydens of the Anses, at the yerely feastes  of Minerua, in the honoure of the goddesse their country woman: deuiding  them selues into two companies, vse to giue battaile, one parte to another  with staues, and with stones: sayeng that thei obserue the maner of their  country in the honour of her that we calle Minerua. And the maiden that  departeth the battayle without wounde, thei holde her for no maide. But  before ther battayle be fought, they determine that what mayden so euer  beareth her selfe mooste valeaunte in the fielde, all the other maydens  with commune consente shall garnishe her, and arme her, both with the  armour of Grecia, and the helmet of Corinthe. And shal sette her in a  chariot, and carye her rounde about the mershe. The same menne vsen their  women as indifferently commune, as kyen to the bulle. The children remaine  with the women vntil they be of some strengthe. Ones in a quartre the men  do assemble wholy together, and then looke with whome the childe fantasieth  mooste to abide, him do they compte for his father.    There is a people named Atlantes, of the mounte Athlas, by the whiche they  dwell. These giue no names one to another as other peoples do, but echeman  is namelesse. When the sonne passeth ouer their heades, they curse him, and  reuyle him with all woordes of mischiefe: for that he is so broiling hote,  that he destroieth bothe them and ther countrye.    They eate of no kinde of beaste, neither dreame in their sliepe. The Aphres  (whice are all brieders of catteile) liue with flesshe and milke, and yet  absteine they fro cowes milke, and all cowe fleshe, according to the maner  of the Egiptians, and therefore kepe they none vp. The women of Cyrene  thincke it not lawfull to strike a cowe, for Isis sake that is honoured in  Egipt, to whome also they appoincte fasting, and feastefull daies, and  obserue them solempnly. But the women of Barcea absteine bothe from cowe  fleshe and sowe flesh. When their children are iiii. yeare olde they vse to  cauterise them on the coron [Footnote: Query, frontal.] vaine (and some on  the temple also) with a medecine for that purpose, made of woolle as it is  plucked fro the shiepe: because thie should not at any time be troubled  with rheumes or poses, [Footnote: A local name for a cold in the head. (See  N. Bailey's Dict., vol. i.)] and by that meanes they say they liue in very  good health. Thei sacrifie after this maner. When in the name of their  firste frutes they haue cutte of the eare of the beaste, they throwe it  ouer the house. That done, they wring the necke on the one side. Of all the  goddes they offre sacrifice to no more but Sonne and Mone. All the Aphres  burye their deade as the Grecians doe, sauing the Nasamones, which bury  them as thoughe they ware sitting: wayting well when any man lieth in  drawing on, to set him on his taile, leaste he should giue vp the ghoste  lieng vpright. Their houses are made of wickers, and withes, wrought aboute  trees, moch like vnto those that we calle frankencence trees, and in suche  sorte that they may tourne them rounde euery waye. The Maries, shaue the  lefte side of their heade, and lette the heare growe on the right. They die  their bodie in redde, and vaunte that they come of the Troianes. The women  of the Zabiques (which are the next neighbours to the Maries) driue the  cartes in the warres, in the which the men fight. Ther are a people called  Zigantes, wher beside the great plentye of hony that they gather fro the  Bies, they haue also certeine men that are makers of honye. They all die  them selues with red, and eate apes fleshe, wherof thei that dwel in the  mounteines haue great plentye. These al being of the part called Libye,  liue for the moste parte a wilde lyfe abrode in the fieldes like beastes,  making no household prouision of meate, ne wearing any maner of appareil  but gotes felles. The gentlemen, and men of honour emong them, haue neither  cities nor townes, but Turrettes builte vpon the waters side, in the which  they laye vp the ouerplus of that that they occupy. They sweare their  people euery yere to obeye their Prince, and that they that obey in diede,  shoulde loue together as felowes and companions: but that the disobediente  shoulde be pursued like felons and traitours. Their armour and weapon, are  bothe acording to the nature of the country and contrimen: for wher thei of  themselues are very quicke, and deliure [Footnote: Nimble. \"All of them  being tall, quicke, and deliver persons.\" _Hollinshed_, vol. ii., ccc. 5.]  of bodye, and the country champaigne, and playne, they neither vse swearde,  dagger, ne harneis, but onely cary thre Iauelines in their hande, and a  nombre of piked and chosen stones, in a case of stiffe leather hanging  aboute them. With these they vse bothe to fight and to skirmishe. In his  coming towarde the ennemy, he throweth his stone, fetching his ronne, and  maketh lightlye a narowe mysse, thoughe it be a good waye of: suche  continuall practise they haue of it. They kiepe neither lawe ne faithe.    The Troglodites (whiche are also named of the Grecians pastours, for their  fieding and brieding of catteille) a people of Ethiope, do lyue in  companies, and haue their heade ouer them, whome they call Tiraunte. But  not meaninge in him so much tirany in diede, as some time some of our  gouernours vnder a fayrer name do execute. None of them hathe any seuerall  wife, and therfore no seueral children, but bothe those in commune, the  tiraunte excepted: Who hathe but one wyfe onely. To the which yf any manne  do but approach or drawe nighe: he is condempned in a certeine nombre of  cattaile to be paied to the Tiraunte. From the beginning of Iuly vntle  about middle August (at the which time thei haue great plenty of raine)  thei nourishe them selues with milke, and bloude, sodden a litle together.  The pasture vplond being, dried away with the heate of the Sonne: They  sieke downe to the marshe, and lowe groundes, for the whiche onely they be  often at debate. When their catteil waxeth olde or sicke, they kyll them,  and eate them, and altogether liue vpon such. They do not giue the childe  the name of the father, but name him aftre a bull, a rambe or an eawe. And  those call thei father (the beastes I meane of the masle kinde) and thother  of the femel kynde, they call mother, because their daily fode is giuen by  them. The people called Idiote, vse for their drincke the iuyce of a whinne  named Paliurus. But the men of worshyp and gentlemen vse the iuce of a  certeine floure they haue emonge them, whiche maketh drincke moche like the  worste of the Renishe muste. And because thei cary great droues of catteile  with them, they chaunge their soile often. Their bodies are all naked,  sauing their priuities, whiche they hide with felles of beastes. All the  Troglodites are circumcised aftre the maner of the Egiptians, sauing only  the Claudians: whiche they so terme of claudicacion or limping. They onely,  dwellinge from their childe hode within the country of the Hesternes, are  not touched with rasour or knife. The Troglodites that are called  Magaueres, carye for theyr armour and weapon, a rounde buckler of a rawe  oxe hide, and a clubbe shodde with yron. Other haue bowes, and Iauelines.  As for graues or places of buriall, they passe not. For they binde the  heade, and the fiete of the dead together with witthes of Paliurus, and  then setting it vp vpon some hilly place, haue a good sporte to all to  bethwacke it with stones, vntle they lie heaped ouer the corps. Then laye  they a goates horne on the toppe and departe, biddinge sorrowe go plaie  him. They warre one with another, not as the Griekes vpon rancour and  Ambicion, but onely for foode sake. In their skirmishes, firste they go to  it with stones, as afore ye haue hearde, vntle it fortune some nombre to be  hurte. Then occupieng the bowe (wherin they are very sure handed) thei  kille one another vpon hepes. Those battayles are attoned by the women of  mooste auncient age. For when they be ones comen into the middle emong them  (as they maye do withoute harme, for that is compted abhominacion in any  wise to hurte one of them) the battaille sodenly ceaseth. They that are  nowe so fiebled with age, that they can no longer followe the heard:  winding the tayle of an oxe aboute their throte choke vp and die. But he  that differreth to rydde him selfe in this sorte: It is laweful for another  (aftre a warninge) to doe it. And it is there compted a friendly  benefaicte. Men also diseased of feures, oranye other incurable malady,  they doe in lyke maner dispatche: iudginge it of all griefes the woorste,  for that manne to liue, that canne nowe nothinge doe, why he shoulde desyre  to lyue. Herodote writeth, that the Troglodites myne them selues caues in  the grounde, wherin to dwell. Men not troubled with anye desire of riches,  but raither giuing them selues to wilfull pouertie. They glory in nothing  but in one litle stone, wherin appere thre skore sondry colours: which we  therfore calle Exaconthalitus. They eate sondry kindes of venemous vermyne.  And speake any distincte worde they cannot, but sieme rather to busse or  thurre betwene thetiethe, then to speake.    There is another people dwelling in that Ethiope that lyeth aboue Egipte,  called Ryzophagi, whiche bestowe muche time in digging vp of the rootes of  Riedes growing niere aboute them, and in wasshing and clensing of the same,  whiche afterward they bruse betwixt stones till thei become clammie, and so  makes wiete cakes of them,"]]]
