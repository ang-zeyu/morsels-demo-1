The space, surrounded by the four, enclos'd  A car triumphal: on two wheels it came  Drawn at a Gryphon's neck; and he above  Stretch'd either wing uplifted, 'tween the midst  And the three listed hues, on each side three;  So that the wings did cleave or injure none;  And out of sight they rose.  The members, far  As he was bird, were golden; white the rest  With vermeil intervein'd.  So beautiful  A car in Rome ne'er grac'd Augustus pomp,  Or Africanus': e'en the sun's itself  Were poor to this, that chariot of the sun  Erroneous, which in blazing ruin fell  At Tellus' pray'r devout, by the just doom  Mysterious of all-seeing Jove.  Three nymphs  at the right wheel, came circling in smooth dance;  The one so ruddy, that her form had scarce  Been known within a furnace of clear flame:  The next did look, as if the flesh and bones  Were emerald: snow new-fallen seem'd the third.    Now seem'd the white to lead, the ruddy now;  And from her song who led, the others took  Their treasure, swift or slow.  At th' other wheel,  A band quaternion, each in purple clad,  Advanc'd with festal step, as of them one  The rest conducted, one, upon whose front  Three eyes were seen.  In rear of all this group,  Two old men I beheld, dissimilar  In raiment, but in port and gesture like,  Solid and mainly grave; of whom the one  Did show himself some favour'd counsellor  Of the great Coan, him, whom nature made  To serve the costliest creature of her tribe.  His fellow mark'd an opposite intent,  Bearing a sword, whose glitterance and keen edge,  E'en as I view'd it with the flood between,  Appall'd me.  Next four others I beheld,  Of humble seeming: and, behind them all,  One single old man, sleeping, as he came,  With a shrewd visage.  And these seven, each  Like the first troop were habited, but wore  No braid of lilies on their temples wreath'd.  Rather with roses and each vermeil flower,  A sight, but little distant, might have sworn,  That they were all on fire above their brow.    Whenas the car was o'er against me, straight.  Was heard a thund'ring, at whose voice it seem'd  The chosen multitude were stay'd; for there,  With the first ensigns, made they solemn halt.          CANTO XXX    Soon as the polar light, which never knows  Setting nor rising, nor the shadowy veil  Of other cloud than sin, fair ornament  Of the first heav'n, to duty each one there  Safely convoying, as that lower doth  The steersman to his port, stood firmly fix'd;  Forthwith the saintly tribe, who in the van  Between the Gryphon and its radiance came,  Did turn them to the car, as to their rest:  And one, as if commission'd from above,  In holy chant thrice shorted forth aloud:  \"Come, spouse, from Libanus!\" and all the rest  Took up the song--At the last audit so  The blest shall rise, from forth his cavern each  Uplifting lightly his new-vested flesh,  As, on the sacred litter, at the voice  Authoritative of that elder, sprang  A hundred ministers and messengers  Of life eternal.  \"Blessed thou! who com'st!\"  And, \"O,\" they cried, \"from full hands scatter ye  Unwith'ring lilies;\" and, so saying, cast  Flowers over head and round them on all sides.    I have beheld, ere now, at break of day,  The eastern clime all roseate, and the sky  Oppos'd, one deep and beautiful serene,  And the sun's face so shaded, and with mists  Attemper'd at lids rising, that the eye  Long while endur'd the sight: thus in a cloud  Of flowers, that from those hands angelic rose,  And down, within and outside of the car,  Fell showering, in white veil with olive wreath'd,  A virgin in my view appear'd, beneath  Green mantle, rob'd in hue of living flame:    And o'er my Spirit, that in former days  Within her presence had abode so long,  No shudd'ring terror crept.  Mine eyes no more  Had knowledge of her; yet there mov'd from her  A hidden virtue, at whose touch awak'd,  The power of ancient love was strong within me.    No sooner on my vision streaming, smote  The heav'nly influence, which years past, and e'en  In childhood, thrill'd me, than towards Virgil I  Turn'd me to leftward, panting, like a babe,  That flees for refuge to his mother's breast,  If aught have terrified or work'd him woe:  And would have cried: \"There is no dram of blood,  That doth not quiver in me.  The old flame  Throws out clear tokens of reviving fire:\"  But Virgil had bereav'd us of himself,  Virgil, my best-lov'd father; Virgil, he  To whom I gave me up for safety: nor,  All, our prime mother lost, avail'd to save  My undew'd cheeks from blur of soiling tears.    \"Dante, weep not, that Virgil leaves thee: nay,  Weep thou not yet: behooves thee feel the edge  Of other sword, and thou shalt weep for that.\"    As to the prow or stern, some admiral  Paces the deck, inspiriting his crew,  When 'mid the sail-yards all hands ply aloof;  Thus on the left side of the car I saw,  (Turning me at the sound of mine own name,  Which here I am compell'd to register)  The virgin station'd, who before appeared  Veil'd in that festive shower angelical.    Towards me, across the stream, she bent her eyes;  Though from her brow the veil descending, bound  With foliage of Minerva, suffer'd not  That I beheld her clearly; then with act  Full royal, still insulting o'er her thrall,  Added, as one, who speaking keepeth back  The bitterest saying, to conclude the speech:  \"Observe me well.  I am, in sooth, I am  Beatrice.  What! and hast thou deign'd at last  Approach the mountainnewest not, O man!  Thy happiness is whole?\"  Down fell mine eyes  On the clear fount, but there, myself espying,  Recoil'd, and sought the greensward: such a weight  Of shame was on my forehead.  With a mien  Of that stern majesty, which doth surround  mother's presence to her awe-struck child,  She look'd; a flavour of such bitterness  Was mingled in her pity.  There her words  Brake off, and suddenly the angels sang:  \"In thee, O gracious Lord, my hope hath been:\"  But went no farther than, \"Thou Lord, hast set  My feet in ample room.\"  As snow, that lies  Amidst the living rafters on the back  Of Italy congeal'd when drifted high  And closely pil'd by rough Sclavonian blasts,  Breathe but the land whereon no shadow falls,  And straightway melting it distils away,  Like a fire-wasted taper: thus was I,  Without a sigh or tear, or ever these  Did sing, that with the chiming of heav'n's sphere,  Still in their warbling chime: but when the strain  Of dulcet symphony, express'd for me  Their soft compassion, more than could the words  \"Virgin, why so consum'st him?\"  then the ice,  Congeal'd about my bosom, turn'd itself  To spirit and water, and with anguish forth  Gush'd through the lips and eyelids from the heart.    Upon the chariot's right edge still she stood,  Immovable, and thus address'd her words  To those bright semblances with pity touch'd:  \"Ye in th' eternal day your vigils keep,  So that nor night nor slumber, with close stealth,  Conveys from you a single step in all  The goings on of life: thence with more heed  I shape mine answer, for his ear intended,  Who there stands weeping, that the sorrow now  May equal the transgression.  Not alone  Through operation of the mighty orbs,  That mark each seed to some predestin'd aim,  As with aspect or fortunate or ill  The constellations meet, but through benign  Largess of heav'nly graces, which rain down  From such a height, as mocks our vision, this man  Was in the freshness of his being, such,  So gifted virtually, that in him  All better habits wond'rously had thriv'd.  The more of kindly strength is in the soil,  So much doth evil seed and lack of culture  Mar it the more, and make it run to wildness.  These looks sometime upheld him; for I show'd  My youthful eyes, and led him by their light  In upright walking.  Soon as I had reach'd  The threshold of my second age, and chang'd  My mortal for immortal, then he left me,  And gave himself to others.  When from flesh  To spirit I had risen, and increase  Of beauty and of virtue circled me,  I was less dear to him, and valued less.  His steps were turn'd into deceitful ways,  Following false images of good, that make  No promise perfect.  Nor avail'd me aught  To sue for inspirations, with the which,  I, both in dreams of night, and otherwise,  Did call him back; of them so little reck'd him,  Such depth he fell, that all device was short  Of his preserving, save that he should view  The children of perdition.  To this end  I visited the purlieus of the dead:  And one, who hath conducted him thus high,  Receiv'd my supplications urg'd with weeping.  It were a breaking of God's high decree,  If Lethe should be past, and such food tasted  Without the cost of some repentant tear.\"          CANTO XXXI    \"O Thou!\"  her words she thus without delay  Resuming, turn'd their point on me, to whom  They but with lateral edge seem'd harsh before,  \"Say thou, who stand'st beyond the holy stream,  If this be true.  A charge so grievous needs  Thine own avowal.\"  On my faculty  Such strange amazement hung, the voice expir'd  Imperfect, ere its organs gave it birth.    A little space refraining, then she spake:  \"What dost thou muse on?  Answer me.  The wave  On thy remembrances of evil yet  Hath done no injury.\"  A mingled sense  Of fear and of confusion, from my lips  Did such a \"Yea\" produce, as needed help  Of vision to interpret.  As when breaks  In act to be discharg'd, a cross-bow bent  Beyond its pitch, both nerve and bow o'erstretch'd,  The flagging weapon feebly hits the mark;  Thus, tears and sighs forth gushing, did I burst  Beneath the heavy load, and thus my voice  Was slacken'd on its way.  She straight began:  \"When my desire invited thee to love  The good, which sets a bound to our aspirings,  What bar of thwarting foss or linked chain  Did meet thee, that thou so should'st quit the hope  Of further progress, or what bait of ease  Or promise of allurement led thee on  Elsewhere, that thou"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10065"],[0,"The Constitution of the United States (#19)"],[1,"very obvious reason that all these symptoms were  in existence and apparent to a few discerning men for decades before the  war. Indeed, it is possible that the world war, far from causing the  _malaise_ of the age, was, in itself, but one of its many symptoms.    Undoubtedly, there are many contributing causes which have swollen the  turbid tide of this world-wide revolution against the spirit of  authority.    Thus, the multiplicity of laws does not tend to develop a law-abiding  spirit. This fact has often been noted. Thus Napoleon, on the eve of the  18th Brumaire, complained that France, with a thousand folios of law,  was a lawless nation. Unquestionably, the political state suffers in  authority by the abuse of legislation, and especially by the appeal to  law to curb evils that are best left to individual conscience.    In this age of democracy, the average individual is too apt to recognize  two constitutions--one, the constitution of the State, and the second,  an unwritten constitution, to him of higher authority, under which he  believes that no law is obligatory which he regards as in excess of the  true powers of government. Of this latter spirit, the widespread  violation of the prohibition law is a familiar illustration.    A race of individualists obey reluctantly, when they obey at all, any  laws which they regard as unreasonable or vexatious. Indeed, they are  increasingly opposed to any law, which affects their selfish interests.  Thus many good women are involuntary smugglers. They deny the authority  of the state to impose a tax upon a Paquin gown. The law's delays and  laxity in administration breed a spirit of contempt, and too often  invite men to take the law into their own hands. These causes are so  familiar that their statement is a commonplace.    Proceeding to deeper and less recognized causes, some would attribute  this spirit of lawlessness to the rampant individualism, which began in  the eighteenth century, and which has steadily and naturally grown with  the advance of democratic institutions. Undoubtedly, the excessive  emphasis upon the rights of man, which marked the political upheaval of  the close of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century,  has contributed to this malady of the age. Men talked, and still talk,  loudly of their rights, but too rarely of their duties. And yet if we  were to attribute the malady merely to excessive individualism, we would  again err in mistaking a symptom for a cause.    To diagnose truly this malady we must look to some cause that is  coterminous in time with the disease itself and which has been operative  throughout civilization. We must seek some widespread change in social  conditions, for man's essential nature has changed but little, and the  change must, therefore, be of environment.    I know of but one such change that is sufficiently widespread and  deep-seated to account adequately for this malady of our time.    Beginning with the close of the eighteenth century, and continuing  throughout the nineteenth, a prodigious transformation has taken place  in the environment of man, which has done more to revolutionize the  conditions of human life than all the changes that had taken place in  the 500,000 preceding years which science has attributed to man's life  on the planet. Up to the period of Watt's discovery of steam vapour as a  motive power, these conditions, so far as the principal facilities of  life, were substantially those of the civilization which developed  eighty centuries ago on the banks of the Nile and later on the  Euphrates. Man had indeed increased his conquest over Nature in later  centuries by a few mechanical inventions, such as gunpowder, telescope,  magnetic needle, printing-press, spinning jenny, and hand-loom, but the  characteristic of all those inventions, with the exception of gunpowder,  was that they still remained a subordinate auxiliary to the physical  strength and mental skill of man. In other words, man still dominated  the machine, and there was still full play for his physical and mental  faculties. Moreover, all the inventions of preceding ages, from the  first fashioning of the flint to the spinning-wheel and the hand-lever  press, were all conquests of the tangible and visible forces of Nature.    With Watt's utilization of steam vapour as a motive power, man suddenly  passed into a new and portentous chapter of his varied history.  Thenceforth, he was to multiply his powers a thousandfold by the  utilization of the invisible powers of Nature--such as vapour and  electricity. This prodigious change in his powers, and therefore his  environment, has proceeded with ever-accelerating speed.    Man has suddenly become the superman. Like the giants of the ancient  fable, he has stormed the very ramparts of Divine power, or, like  Prometheus, he has stolen fire of omnipotent forces from Heaven itself  for his use. His voice can now reach from the Atlantic to the Pacific,  and, taking wing in his aeroplane, he can fly in one swift flight from  Nova Scotia to England, or he can leave Lausanne and, resting upon the  icy summit of Mont Blanc--thus, like \"the herald, Mercury, new-lighted  on a heaven-kissing hill\"--he can again plunge into the void, and thus  outfly the eagles themselves.    In thus acquiring from the forces of Nature almost illimitable power, he  has minimized the necessity for his own physical exertion or even  mental skill. The machine now not only acts for him, but too often  _thinks_ for him.    Is it surprising that so portentous a change should have fevered his  brain and disturbed his mental equilibrium? A new ideal, which he  proudly called \"progress,\" obsessed him, the ideal of quantity and not  quality. His practical religion became that of acceleration and  facilitation--to do things more quickly and easily--and thus to minimize  exertion became his great objective. Less and less he relied upon the  initiative of his own brain and muscle, and more and more he put his  faith in the power of machinery to relieve him of labour. The evil of  our age is that its values are all false. It overrates speed, it  underrates sureness; it overrates the new, it underrates the old; it  overrates automatic efficiency, it underrates individual craftsmanship;  it overrates rights, it underrates duties; it overrates political  institutions, it underrates individual responsibility. We glory in the  fact that we can talk a thousand miles, but we ignore the greater  question, whether when we thus out-do Stentor, we have anything worth  saying. We have now made the serene spaces of the upper Heavens our  media to transmit market reports and sporting news, second-rate music  and worse oratory and in the meantime the great masters of thought,  Homer and Shakespeare, Bach and Beethoven remain unbidden on our library  shelves. What a sordid Vanity Fair is our modern Civilization!    This incalculable multiplication of power has intoxicated man. The lust  has obsessed him, without regard to whether it be constructive or  destructive. Quantity, not quality, becomes the great objective. Man  consumes the treasures of the earth faster than he produces them,  deforesting its surface and disembowelling its hidden wealth. As he  feverishly multiplied the things he desired, even more feverishly he  multiplied his wants.    To gain these, man sought the congested centres of human life. While  the world, as a whole, is not over-populated, the leading countries of  civilization were subjected to this tremendous pressure. Europe, which,  at the beginning of the nineteenth century, barely numbered 100,000,000  people, suddenly grew nearly five-fold. Millions left the farms to  gather into the cities to exploit their new and seemingly easy conquest  over Nature.    In the United States, as recently as 1880, only 15 per cent. of the  people were crowded in the cities, 85 per cent. remained upon the farms  and still followed that occupation, which, of all occupations, still  preserves, in its integrity, the dominance of human labour over the  machine. To-day, 52 per cent. of the population is in the cities, and  with many of them existence is both feverish and artificial. While they  have employment, many of them do not themselves work, but spend their  lives in watching machines work.    The result has been a minute subdivision of labour that has denied to  many workers the true significance and physical benefit of labour.    The direct results of this excessive tendency to specialization, whereby  not only the work but the worker becomes divided into mere fragments,  are threefold. Hobson, in his work on John Ruskin, thus classifies them.  In the first place, _narrowness_, due to the confinement to a single  action in which the elements of human skill or strength are largely  eliminated; secondly, _monotony_, in the assimilation of man to a  machine, whereby seemingly the machine dominates man and not man the  machine, and, thirdly, _irrationality_, in that work became dissociated  in the mind of the worker with any complete or satisfying achievement.  The worker does not see the fruit of his travail, and cannot therefore  be truly satisfied. To spend one's life in opening a valve to make a  part of a pin is, as Ruskin pointed out, demoralizing in its  tendencies. The clerk who only operates an adding machine has little  opportunity for self-expression.    Thus, millions of men have lost both the opportunity for real physical  exertion, the incentive to work in the joyous competition of skill, and  finally the reward of work in the sense of achievement.    More serious than this, however, has been the destructive effort of  quantity, the great object of the mechanical age, at the expense of  quality.    Take, for example, the printing-press: No one can question the immense  advantages which have flowed from the increased facility for  transmitting ideas. But may it not be true that the"]]]
