The animal is usually weak, in poor flesh and unfit  for work. In other cases, symptoms of broken wind are noticed. Severe  coughing spells on getting up from the bed, or on moving about are  characteristic of bronchitis in hogs. Verminous bronchitis in calves and  lambs is characterized by severe spells of coughing, difficult and labored  breathing and a weak, emaciated condition.    _The preventive treatment_ is the same as for \"colds.\" In the acute form  the treatment consists largely in careful nursing. Properly ventilated,  clean quarters that are free from dust should be provided. The animal  should be covered with a light or heavy blanket, depending on the  temperature of the stable, and the limbs bandaged. A light diet should be  fed for a few days. It is advisable to give the animal a physic of oil. The  inhalation of steam every few hours during the first few days should be  practised. Glycoheroin may be given three or four times a day.    Animals affected with chronic bronchitis should not be exercised or worked.  We should guard against their taking cold, give nourishing feeds, and a  tonic if necessary.    CONGESTION OF THE LUNGS.--Pulmonary congestion is generally due to  overexertion and exposure to extreme heat or cold. It may occur if the  animal is exercised when sick or exhausted. Hogs that are heated from  exercise and allowed access to cold water, may suffer from a congestion or  engorgement of the lungs. It may be present at the beginning of an attack  of pneumonia or pleurisy.    _The symptoms_ are difficult breathing and the animal fights for its  breath. The body temperature may be several degrees above the normal. In  the mild form, the above symptoms are not so marked. The onset and course  of the disease are rapid, recovery, pneumonia, or death often occurring  within twenty-four hours.    _Pulmonary haemorrhage_ is not uncommon. The discharge from the nostrils  may be slightly tinged with blood, or there may be an intermittent  discharge of blood from the nostrils or mouth. The mucous membranes are  pale, the animal trembles and shows marked dyspnoea.    _The preventive treatment_ consists in using the proper judgment in caring  for, and in working or exercising animals. This is especially true if the  animal is affected with acute or chronic disease. At the very beginning,  bleeding should be practised. Hot blankets renewed frequently and bandages  to the limbs is a very necessary part of the treatment. In case of severe  pulmonary haemorrhage, treatment is of little use.    PNEUMONIA.--Inflammation of the lungs is more common in horses than in any  of the other domestic animals. The croupous form is the most common. The  inflammation may affect one or both lungs, one or more lobes, or scattered  lobules of lung tissue. The inflammation may be acute, subacute or chronic.    _The causes_ are very much the same as in other respiratory diseases.  Exposure to cold and wet, stable draughts, becoming chilled after  perspiring freely and washing the animal with cold water are the common  causes of pneumonia. Inflammation of the lungs is especially apt to occur  if the animal is not accustomed to such exposure. Animals affected with  other respiratory diseases are predisposed to pneumonia. Drenching animals  by way of the nostril and irritating drenches, or regurgitated feed passing  into the air passages and lungs are the traumatic causes of pneumonia.    _The symptoms_ vary in the different forms of pneumonia. In case pneumonia  occurs secondarily, the earliest symptoms are confounded with those of the  primary disease. The first symptoms noticed may be a high body temperature,  as indicated by chills, and refusing to eat. The visible mucous membranes  are red and congested, the nostrils dilated, the respirations quickened and  difficult, the expired air hot and the pulse beats accelerated. The animal  coughs, and in the horse, a rusty discharge may be noticed adhering to the  margins of the nostrils. The horse refuses to lie down if both lungs are  inflamed. In severe cases the expression of the face indicates pain, the  respirations are labored, the general symptoms aggravated, and the animal  stands with the front feet spread apart. Cattle are inclined to lie down,  unless the lungs are seriously affected. Hogs like to burrow under the  litter.    _The course of croupous pneumonia_ is typical, and unless it terminates  fatally in the first stage, the periods of congestion, hepatization and  resolution follow each other in regular manner. Auscultation of the lungs  is of great value in diagnosing and watching the progress of the disease.  It is more difficult to determine the character of the lung sounds in the  horse and cow than it is in the small animals. This is especially difficult  if the animal is fat. During the period of _congestion_ which lasts about a  day, one can hear both healthy and crepitating sounds. The period of  _hepatization_ is characterized by an absence of sound over the diseased  area. The inflammatory exudates become organized at the beginning of this  stage, and the air can not enter the air cells. This period lasts several  days. _Resolution_ marks the beginning of recovery or convalescence. Toward  the end of the second period, the inflammatory exudate in the air cells has  begun to degenerate. In the last stage, these exudates undergo liquefaction  and are absorbed, or expelled by coughing, in from seven days to two weeks,  depending on the extent of the inflammation and the general condition of  the animal.    _In the subacute form_ the symptoms are mild and may subside within a week.  Sometimes _abscesses_ form in the lung. _Gangrenous inflammation_ of the  lung can be recognized by the odor of the expired air and the severity of  the symptoms. This form of pneumonia terminates fatally. If the larger  portion of the lung tissue is inflamed, death from asphyxia may occur in  the second stage.    The success in the _treatment_ of pneumonia depends largely on the care.  Properly ventilated, clean, comfortable quarters and careful nursing are  highly important. Large animals should be given a roomy box stall. Cold  does not aggravate pneumonia, providing the animal's body is well protected  with blankets and the limbs bandaged. Wet, damp quarters and draughts are  injurious. Hogs should be given plenty of bedding to burrow in. A light,  easily digested diet should be fed. Very little roughage should be fed. If  the animal does not eat well, it may be given eggs and milk. Weak pulse  beats should be treated by giving digitalis and strychnine.  Counterirritation to the chest wall is indicated. During convalescence,  bitter tonics may be given. Constipation should be treated by giving the  animal castor or linseed oil.    PLEURISY.--Inflammation of the pleura is most common in horses. It occurs  in all farm animals and is frequently unilateral. There are two forms of  pleurisy, acute and chronic. Pleuropneumonia is common when the cause is a  specific germ. This occurs in tuberculosis, pleuropneumonia of horses and  pneumococcus infection.    _The common causes_ are exposure to cold, chilling winds, draughty, damp  quarters, and drinking cold water when perspiring. Injuries to the costal  pleura by fractured ribs and punctured wounds may cause it to become  inflamed.    The early symptoms of acute pleurisy are chills, rise in body temperature,  pain and abdominal breathing. The most characteristic symptom is the ridge  extending along the lower extremities of the ribs (pleuritic ridge). The  animal does not stand still as in pneumonia, but changes its position  occasionally, its movements in many cases being accompanied by a grunt.  Pressure on the wall of the chest causes the animal to flinch and show  evidence of severe pain. Large animals rarely lie down. The cough is short  and painful. On placing the ear against the wall of the chest and listening  to the respirations, we are able to hear friction sounds. After a few days  effusion occurs in the pleural cavity. Although the animal may have refused  to eat up to this time, it now appears greatly relieved and may offer to  eat its feed. This relief may be only temporary. If the fluid exudate forms  in sufficient quantity to cause pressure on the heart and lungs and  interfere with their movement, the pulse beat is weak, the respirations  quick and labored, the elbows are turned out and the feet are spread apart.  All of the respiratory muscles may be used. The expression of the face may  indicate threatened asphyxia. We may determine the extent of the pleural  exudate by auscultation. There is no evidence of respiratory sounds in that  portion of the chest below the surface of the fluid. Dropsical swellings  may occur on the under surface of the breast and abdomen.    _In subacute cases_ evidence of recovery is noted in from four to ten days.  _Acute pleurisy_ very often terminates fatally. Under the most favorable  conditions, recovery takes place very slowly, sometimes extending over a  period of several months. It is not uncommon for the horse to continue  having \"defective wind.\"    _The treatment_ consists in good care, well ventilated quarters and careful  nursing, the same as recommended in the treatment of pneumonia. At the very  beginning, the pain may be relieved by the administration of small doses of  morphine. If the conditions in the stable permit, a hot blanket that has  been dipped in hot water and wrung out as dry as possible, may be applied  to the chest wall and covered with a rubber blanket. This treatment should  be continued during the first few days of the inflammation.

In support of all  naturalistic conjectures concerning man's origin, there is not, at  this time, a _shadow of scientific evidence_.\"    Prof. Virchow, of Berlin, a naturalist of world wide fame, said: \"The  attempt to find the transition from the animal to man has ended in  total failure. The middle link has not been found and never will  be. Evolution is all nonsense. It can not be proved by science that  man descended from the ape or from any other animal.\"    Prof. Fleishman, of Erlangen, who once accepted Darwinism, but after  further investigation repudiated it, said: \"The Darwinian theory of  descent has not a single fact to confirm it, in the realm of  nature. It is not the result of scientific research, but is purely the  product of the imagination.\"    Prof. Agassiz, one of the greatest scientists of any age, said: \"The  theory [of the transmutation of species] is a scientific mistake,  untrue in its facts, unscientific in its method, and mischievous in  its tendency.... There is not a fact known to science, tending to show  that a single kind has ever been transmuted into any other.\"    Dr. W. H. Thompson, former president of N. Y.  Academy of Medicine,  said: \"The Darwinian theory is now rejected by the majority of  biologists, as absurdly inadequate.  It is absurd to rank man among  the animals.  His so called fellow animals, the primates--gorilla,  orang and chimpanzee--can do nothing truly human.\"    Sir William Dawson, an eminent geologist, of Canada, said: \"The record  of the rocks is decidedly against evolutionists, especially in the  abrupt appearance of new forms under specific types, and without  apparent predecessors.... Paleontology furnishes no evidence as to the  actual transformation of one species into another. No such case is  certainly known. Nothing is known about the origin of man except what  is told in Scripture.\"    The foremost evolutionists, Spencer, Huxley and Romanes, before their  death, repudiated Darwinism.  Haeckel alone supported the theory and  that by forged evidence.    Dr. St. George Mivert, late professor of biology in the University  College of Kensington, calls Darwinism a \"puerile hypothesis.\"    Dr. James Orr, of Edinburg University, says: \"The greatest scientists  and theologians of Europe are now pronouncing Darwinism to be  absolutely dead.\"    Dr. Traas, a famous palaeontologist, concludes: \"The idea that mankind  is descended from any simian species whatever, is certainly the most  foolish ever put forth by a man writing on the history of man.\" Does  this apply to H. G. Wells?    Dr. N. S. Shaler, professor of Geol., in Harvard University, said: \"It  is not yet proved that a single species of the two or three millions,  now inhabiting the earth had been established solely or mainly, by the  operation of natural selection.\"    Prof. Haeckel, a most extreme evolutionist, confesses: \"Most modern  investigators of science have come to the conclusion that the doctrine  of evolution, and particularly Darwinism, is an error, and can not be  maintained.\"    Prof. Huxley, said that evolution is \"not proved and not provable.\"    Sir Charles Bell, Prof, of the University College of London, says:  \"Everything declares the species to have their origin in a distinct  creation, not in a gradual variation from some original type.\"    These testimonies of scientists of the first rank are a part of a  large number. Many of them and many more, are given in Prof.  Townsend's \"Collapse of Evolution,\" McCann's \"God or Gorilla,\" Philip  Mauro's \"Evolution At the Bar,\" and other anti-evolution books. Alfred  McCann, in his great work, \"God or Gorilla,\" mentions 20 of the most  prominent scholars, who do not accept Darwinism. Yet they say, \"All  scholars accept evolution\"!!

PALEONTOLOGY      1. The PITHECANTHROPUS, which is a high sounding name for an  ape-man (from Grk. pithekos, ape, and anthropos, man) was found by  Dr. Dubois, an ardent evolutionist, in 1892, in Trinil in the island  of Java. It lived, it is said, 750,000 years ago. He found, buried in  the Pleistocene beds, 40 feet below the surface in the sand, _the  upper portion of a skull, a tooth and a thigh bone_. \"It was  fortunate,\" says Dr. Chapin, \"that the most distinctive portions of  the human (sic) frame should have been preserved, because from these  specimens, we are able to reconstruct (?) the being, and to say with  assurance (!)  that his walk was erect in manlike posture, that he had  mental power considerably above the ape, (it will not do to be too  definite) and his powers of speech were somewhat limited. (A string of  guesses wholly unwarranted.)  This man stood half way between the  anthropoid and the existing men.\"--Social Evolution, p. 61.    A high authority declares,--\"Shortly after this discovery, 24 of the  most eminent scientists of Europe met.  Ten said that the bones  belonged to an ape; 7, to a man; and 7 (less than one-third) said they  were a missing link.\"  Some of the most eminent scientists say that  some of the bones belong to a man, and some to an ape, baboon, or  monkey. The great Prof. Virchow says: \"There is no evidence at all  that these bones were parts of the same creature.\" But such adverse  opinions do not weigh much with modern evolutionists determined to win  at all hazards.    The small section of the brain pan, weighing but a few ounces, was  found about 50 feet from the thigh bone. One tooth was found 3 feet  from the fragment of skull, and one near the thigh bone, _50 feet  away_. Since the small section of the brain pan belonged to a  chimpanzee, and the thigh bone is that of a man, is it likely that  these scattered bones belonged to the same creature? Even if they did,  is it likely that these bones would be preserved in the sand 750,000  years, or even 375,000 years according to a later estimate? We know  that petrified skeletons, encased in rock, may be millions of years  old, but where are the unpetrified skeletons of men who lived even  5,000 years ago? If unpetrified skeletons could last 750,000 years,  there would be millions of them. Without a doubt, this skull of a  chimpanzee, and femur of a man, belong to a modern beast and a modern  man, buried by"]]]
