And remember, also, how  one woman may pass another woman on the street, and without seeming to  give her more than a careless glance, may be able to relate in detail  every feature of the other woman's apparel, including its color, texture,  style of fashioning, probable price of the material, etc., etc. And a  mere man would have noticed scarcely anything about it--because he would  not have given it any attention. But how soon would that man learn to  equal his sister in attention and observation of women's wearing apparel,  if his business success depended upon it, or if his speculative instinct  was called into play by a wager with some friend as to who could remember  the most about a woman's clothing, seen in a passing glance? You see it  is all a matter of Interest and Attention.    But we forget that the Attention may be developed and cultivated, and we  complain that we \"cannot remember things,\" or that we do not seem to be  able to \"take notice.\" A little practice will do wonders in this  direction.    Now, while the above exercises will develop your memory and powers of  observation, still that is not the main reason that we have given them to  you. We have an ulterior object, that will appear in time. We aim to  develop your Will-power, and we know that Attention stands at the gate of  Will-power. In order to be able to use your Will, you must be able to  focus the Attention forcibly and distinctly. And these childish exercises  will help you to develop the mental muscles of the Attention. If you  could but realize the childish games the young Yogi students are required  to play, in order to develop the mental faculties, you would change your  minds about the Yogi Adepts whom you have been thinking about as mere  dreamers, far removed from the practical. These men, and their students,  are intensely practical. They have gained the mastery of the Mind, and  its faculties, and are able to use them as sharp edged tools, while the  untrained man finds that he has but a dull, unsharpened blade that will  do nothing but hack and hew roughly, instead of being able to produce the  finished product.    The Yogi believes in giving the \"I\" good tools with which to work, and he  spends much time in tempering and sharpening these tools. Oh, no, the  Yogi are not idle dreamers. Their grasp of \"practical things\" would  surprise many a practical, matter-of-fact Western business man, if he  could but observe it.    And so, we ask you to practice \"observing things.\" The two exercises we  have given are but indications of the general line. We could give you  thousands, but you can prepare them yourselves as well as could we.  The little Hindu boy is taught Attention by being asked to note and  remember the number, color, character and other details of a number of  colored stones, jewelry, etc., shown for an instant in an open palm,  the hand being closed the moment after. He is taught to note and  describe passing travelers, and their equipages--houses he sees on his  journeys--and thousands of other everyday objects. The results are almost  marvelous. In this way he is prepared as a _chela_ or student, and he  brings to his _guru_ or teacher a brain well developed--a mind thoroughly  trained to obey the Will of the \"I\"--and with faculties quickened to  perceive instantly that which others would fail to see in a fortnight. It  is true that he does not turn these faculties to \"business\" or other  so-called \"practical\" pursuits, but prefers to devote them to abstract  studies and pursuits outside of that which the Western man considers to  be the end and aim of life. But remember that the two civilizations are  quite different--following different ideals--having different economic  conditions--living in different worlds, as it were. But that is all a  matter of taste and ideals--the faculty for the \"practical life\" of the  West is possessed by the _chela_, if he saw fit to use it. But all Hindu  youths are not _chelas_, remember--nor are all Western youths \"captains  of industry,\" or Edisons.      MANTRAM (AFFIRMATION).    I am using my Attention to develop my mental faculties, so as to give the  \"I\" a perfect instrument with which to work. The mind is _My_ instrument  and I am bringing it to a state of capacity for perfect work.      MANTRAM (OR AFFIRMATION).    There is but One Life--One Life Underlying. This Life is manifesting  through ME, and through every other shape, form, and thing. I am resting  on the bosom of the Great Ocean of Life, and it is supporting me, and  will carry me safely, though the waves rise and fall--though the storms  rage and the tempests roar. I am safe on the Ocean of Life, and rejoice  as I feel the sway of its motion. Nothing can harm me--though changes may  come and go, I am Safe. I am One with the All Life, and its Power,  Knowledge, and Peace are behind, underneath, and within Me. O! One Life!  express Thyself through me--carry me now on the crest of the wave, now  deep down in the trough of the ocean--supported always by Thee--all is  good to me, as I feel Thy life moving in and through me. I am Alive,  through thy life, and I open myself to thy full manifestation and inflow.          THE SIXTH LESSON.    CULTIVATION OF PERCEPTION.      Man gains his knowledge of the outside world through his senses. And,  consequently, many of us are in the habit of thinking of these senses as  if _they_ did the sensing, instead of being merely carriers of the  vibrations coming from the outside world, which are then presented to the  Mind for examination. We shall speak of this at greater length a little  later on in this lesson. Just now we wish to impress upon you the fact  that it is the Mind that perceives, not the senses. And, consequently, a  development of Perception is really a development of the Mind.    The Yogis put their students through a very arduous course of practice  and exercises designed to develop their powers of perception. To many  this would appear to be merely a development of the Senses, which might  appear odd in view of the fact that the Yogis are constantly preaching  the folly of being governed and ruled by the senses. But there is nothing  paradoxical about all this, for the Yogis, while preaching the folly of  sense life, and manifesting the teaching in their lives, nevertheless  believe in any and all exercises calculated to \"sharpen\" the Mind, and  develop it to a keen state and condition.    They see a great difference between having a sharpened perception, on the  one hand, and being a slave to the senses on the other. For instance,  what would be thought of a man who objected to acquiring a keen eyesight,  for fear it would lead him away from higher things, by reason of his  becoming attached to the beautiful things he might see. To realize the  folly of this idea, one may look at its logical conclusion, which would  be that one would then be much better off if all their senses were  destroyed. The absurdity, not to say wickedness, of such an idea will be  apparent to everyone, after a minute's consideration.    The secret of the Yogi theory and teachings regarding the development of  the Mental powers, lies in the word \"_Mastery_.\" The Yoga student  accomplishes and attains this mastery in two ways. The first way is by  subordinating all the feelings, sense-impressions, etc., to the Mastery  of the \"I,\" or Will, the Mastery being obtained in this way by the  assertion of the dominancy of the \"I\" over the faculties and emotions,  etc. The second step, or way, lies in the Yogi, once having asserted the  mastery, beginning to develop and perfect the Mental instrument, so as to  get better work and returns from it. In this way he increases his kingdom  and is Master over a much larger territory.    In order for one to gain knowledge, it is necessary to use to the best  advantage the mental instruments and tools that he finds at his disposal.  And again, one must develop and improve such tools--put a keen edge upon  them, etc. Not only does one gain a great benefit from a development of  the faculties of perception, but he also acquires an additional benefit  from the training of the whole mind arising from the mental discipline  and training resulting from the former exercises, etc. In our previous  lessons we have pointed out some of the means by which these faculties  might be greatly improved, and their efficiency increased. In this lesson  we shall point out certain directions in which the Perceptive faculties  may be trained. We trust that the simplicity of the idea may not cause  any of our students to lose interest in the work. If they only knew just  what such development would lead to they would gladly follow our  suggestions in the matter. Every one of the ideas and exercises given by  us are intended to lead up to the strengthening of the Mind, and the  attainment of powers and the unfoldment of faculties. There is no royal  road to Raja Yoga, but the student will be well repaid for the work of  climbing the hill of Attainment.    In view of the above, let us examine the question of The Senses. Through  the doors of the senses Man receives all his information regarding the  outside world. If he keeps these doors but half open, or crowded up with  obstacles and rubbish, he may expect to receive but few messages from  outside. But if he keeps his doorways clear, and clean, he will obtain  the best that is passing his way.    If one were born without sense-organs--no matter how good a Mind he might  have--he would be compelled to live his life in a dreamy plant-life stage  of existence, with little or no consciousness. The Mind would be like a  seed in the earth, that for some reason was prevented from growing.    One may object that the highest ideas do not come to us through the  senses, but the reply is that the things obtained through the senses are  the \"raw material\" upon which the mind works, and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1366"],[0,"The Cloister and the Hearth (#19)"],[1,"Yes, I am strong,\" thundered Perpusillus; then, catching sight of her  meaning, \"but I hate to go on foot,\" he added sulkily.    \"Alas! alas! who will help me if you will not? Dear Giles, do you not  love Gerard?\"    \"Yes, I like him best of the lot. I'll go to Sevenbergen on Peter  Buyskens his mule. Ask you him, for he won't lend her me.\"    Kate remonstrated. The whole town would follow him. It would be known  whither he was gone, and Gerard be in worse danger than before.    Giles parried this by promising to ride out of the town the opposite  way, and not turn the mule's head towards Sevenbergen till he had got  rid of the curious.    Kate then assented and borrowed the mule. She charged Giles with a short  but meaning message, and made him repeat it after her over and over,  till he could say it word for word.    Giles started on the mule, and little Kate retired, and did the last  thing now in her power for her beloved brother--prayed on her knees long  and earnestly for his safety.        CHAPTER XIII    Gerard and Margaret went gaily to Sevenbergen in the first flush of  recovered liberty and successful adventure. But these soon yielded  to sadder thoughts. Gerard was an escaped prisoner, and liable to be  retaken and perhaps punished; and therefore he and Margaret would have  to part for a time. Moreover, he had conceived a hatred to his native  place. Margaret wished him to leave the country for a while, but at  the thought of his going to Italy her heart fainted. Gerard, on the  contrary, was reconciled to leaving Margaret only by his desire to visit  Italy, and his strong conviction that there he should earn money and  reputation, and remove every obstacle to their marriage. He had already  told her all that the demoiselle Van Eyck had said to him. He repeated  it, and reminded Margaret that the gold pieces were only given him to go  to Italy with. The journey was clearly for Gerard's interest. He was a  craftsman and an artist, lost in this boorish place. In Italy they would  know how to value him. On this ground above all the unselfish girl gave  her consent; but many tender tears came with it, and at that Gerard,  young and loving as herself, cried bitterly with her, and often they  asked one another what they had done, that so many different persons  should be their enemies, and combine, as it seemed, to part them.    They sat hand in hand till midnight, now deploring their hard fate, now  drawing bright and hopeful pictures of the future, in the midst of which  Margaret's tears would suddenly flow, and then poor Gerard's eloquence  would die away in a sigh.    The morning found them resigned to part, but neither had the courage to  say when; and much I doubt whether the hour of parting ever would have  struck.    But about three in the afternoon, Giles, who had made a circuit of many  miles to avoid suspicion, rode up to the door. They both ran out to him,  eager with curiosity.    \"Brother Gerard,\" cried he, in his tremendous tones, \"Kate bids you run  for your life. They charge you with theft; you have given them a handle.  Think not to explain. Hope not for justice in Tergou. The parchments you  took, they are but a blind. She hath seen your death in the men's eyes;  a price is on your head. Fly! For Margaret's sake and all who love you,  loiter not life away, but fly!\"    It was a thunder-clap, and left two white faces looking at one another,  and at the terrible messenger.    Then Giles, who had hitherto but uttered by rote what Catherine bade  him, put in a word of his own.    \"All the constables were at our house after you, and so was Dirk Brower.  Kate is wise, Gerard. Best give ear to her rede, and fly!\"    \"Oh, yes, Gerard,\" cried Margaret wildly. \"Fly on the instant. Ah! those  parchments; my mind misgave me: why did I let you take them?\"    \"Margaret, they are but a blind: Giles says so. No matter: the old  caitiff shall never see them again; I will not go till I have hidden  his treasure where he shall never find it.\" Gerard then, after thanking  Giles warmly, bade him farewell, and told him to go back and tell Kate  he was gone. \"For I shall be gone ere you reach home,\" said he. He then  shouted for Martin; and told him what had happened, and begged him to go  a little way towards Tergou, and watch the road.    \"Ay!\" said Martin, \"and if I see Dirk Brower or any of his men, I will  shoot an arrow into the oak-tree that is in our garden; and on that  you must run into the forest hard by, and meet me at the weird hunter's  spring. Then I will guide you through the wood.\"    Surprise thus provided against, Gerard breathed again. He went with  Margaret, and while she watched the oak-tree tremblingly, fearing every  moment to see an arrow strike among the branches, Gerard dug a deep hole  to bury the parchments in.    He threw them in, one by one. They were nearly all charters and records  of the burgh; but one appeared to be a private deed between Floris  Brandt, father of Peter, and Ghysbrecht.    \"Why, this is as much yours as his,\" said Gerard. \"I will read this.\"    \"Oh, not now, Gerard, not now,\" cried Margaret. \"Every moment you lose  fills me with fear; and see, large drops of rain are beginning to fall,  and the clouds lower.\"    Gerard yielded to this remonstrance; but he put the deed into his bosom,  and threw the earth in over the others, and stamped it down. While thus  employed there came a flash of lightning followed by a peal of distant  thunder, and the rain came down heavily. Margaret and Gerard ran into  the house, whither they were speedily followed by Martin.    \"The road is clear,\" said he, \"and a heavy storm coming on.\"    His words proved true. The thunder came nearer and nearer till it  crashed overhead: the flashes followed one another close, like the  strokes of a whip, and the rain fell in torrents. Margaret hid her face  not to see the lightning. On this, Gerard put up the rough shutter and  lighted a candle. The lovers consulted together, and Gerard blessed  the storm that gave him a few hours more with Margaret. The sun set  unperceived, and still the thunder pealed, and the lightning flashed,  and the rain poured. Supper was set; but Gerard and Margaret could not  eat: the thought that this was the last time they should sup together  choked them. The storm lulled a little. Peter retired to rest. But  Gerard was to go at peep of day, and neither he nor Margaret could  afford to lose an hour in sleep. Martin sat a while, too; for he was  fitting a new string to his bow, a matter in which he was very nice.    The lovers murmured their sorrows and their love beside him.    Suddenly the old man held up his hand to them to be silent.    They were quiet and listened, and heard nothing. But the next moment a  footstep crackled faintly upon the autumn leaves that lay strewn in the  garden at the back door of the house. To those who had nothing to fear  such a step would have said nothing; but to those who had enemies it was  terrible. For it was a foot trying to be noiseless.    Martin fitted an arrow to his string and hastily blew out the candle. At  this moment, to their horror, they heard more than one footstep approach  the other door of the cottage, not quite so noiselessly as the other,  but very stealthily--and then a dead pause.    Their blood froze in their veins.    \"Oh, Kate, oh, Kate! You said fly on the instant.\" And Margaret moaned  and wrung her hands in anguish and terror and wild remorse for having  kept Gerard.    \"Hush, girl!\" said Martin, in a stern whisper.    A heavy knock fell on the door.    And on the hearts within.        CHAPTER XIV    As if this had been a concerted signal, the back door was struck as  rudely the next instant. They were hemmed in. But at these alarming  sounds Margaret seemed to recover some share of self-possession. She  whispered, \"Say he was here, but is gone.\" And with this she seized  Gerard and almost dragged him up the rude steps that led to her father's  sleeping-room. Her own lay next beyond it.    The blows on the door were repeated.    \"Who knocks at this hour?\"    \"Open, and you will see!\"    \"I open not to thieves--honest men are all abed now.\"    \"Open to the law, Martin Wittenhaagen, or you shall rue it.\"    \"Why, that is Dirk Brower's voice, I trow. What make you so far from  Tergou?\"    \"Open, and you will know.\"    Martin drew the bolt very slowly, and in rushed Dierich and four more.  They let in their companion who was at the back door.    \"Now, Martin, where is Gerard Eliassoen?\"    \"Gerard Eliassoen? Why, he was here but now!\"    \"Was here?\" Dierich's countenance fell. \"And where is he now?\"    \"They say he has gone to Italy. Why, what is to do?\"    \"No matter. When did he go? Tell me not that he went in such a storm as  this!\"    \"Here is a coil about Gerard Eliassoen,\" said Martin contemptuously.  Then he lighted the candle, and seating himself coolly by the fire,  proceeded to whip some fine silk round his bow-string at the place where  the nick of the arrow frets it.    \"I'll tell you,\" said he carelessly. \"Know you his brother Giles?--a  little misbegotten imp, all head and arms? Well, he came tearing over  here on a mule, and bawled out something, I was too far off to hear the  creature's words, but only its noise. Any way, he started Gerard. For as  soon as he was gone, there was such crying and kissing, and then Gerard  went away. They do tell me he has gone to Italy--mayhap you know where  that is, for I don't.\"    Dierich's countenance fell lower and lower at this account. There was  no flaw in it, A cunninger man than Martin would perhaps have told a  lie too many and raised suspicion. But Martin did his task well. He only  told the one falsehood he was bade to tell, and of his own head invented  nothing.    \"Mates,\" said Dierich, \"I doubt he speaks sooth. I told the burgomaster  how 'twould be. He met the dwarf galloping Peter Buyskens's mule from  Sevenbergen. 'They have sent that "]]]
