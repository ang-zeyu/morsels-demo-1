[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8642"],[0,"Woman in the Nineteenth Century (#18)"],[1," was not unheroic--to see that woman, true to humanity and  her own nature, a centre of rude eyes and tongues, even gentlemen  feeling licensed to make part of a species of mob around a female out  of her sphere. As she took her seat in the desk amid the great noise,  and in the throng, full, like a wave, of something to ensue, I saw her  humanity in a gentleness and unpretension, tenderly open to the sphere  around her, and, had she not been supported by the power of the will  of genuineness and principle, she would have failed. It led her to  prayer, which, in Woman especially, is childlike; sensibility and will  going to the side of God and looking up to him; and humanity was  poured out in aspiration.    \"She acted like a gentle hero, with her mild decision and womanly  calmness. All heroism is mild, and quiet, and gentle, for it is life  and possession; and combativeness and firmness show a want of  actualness. She is as earnest, fresh and simple, as when she first  entered the crusade. I think she did much good, more than the men in  her place could do, for Woman feels more as being and reproducing--this  brings the subject more into home relations. Men speak through, and  mostly from intellect, and this addresses itself to that in others  which is combative.\"    Not easily shall we find elsewhere, or before this time, any written  observations on the same subject, so delicate and profound.    The late Dr. Channing, whose enlarged and tender and religious nature  shared every onward impulse of his tune, though his thoughts followed  his wishes with a deliberative caution which belonged to his habits  and temperament, was greatly interested in these expectations for  women. His own treatment of them was absolutely and thoroughly  religious. He regarded them as souls, each of which had a destiny of  its own, incalculable to other minds, and whose leading it must  follow, guided by the light of a private conscience. He had sentiment,  delicacy, kindness, taste; but they were all pervaded and ruled by  this one thought, that all beings had souls, and must vindicate their  own inheritance. Thus all beings were treated by him with an equal,  and sweet, though solemn, courtesy. The young and unknown, the woman  and the child, all felt themselves regarded with an infinite  expectation, from which there was no reaction to vulgar prejudice. He  demanded of all he met, to use his favorite phrase, \"great truths.\"    His memory, every way dear and reverend, is, by many, especially  cherished for this intercourse of unbroken respect.    At one time, when the progress of Harriet Martineau through this  country, Angelina Grimke's appearance in public, and the visit of Mrs.  Jameson, had turned his thoughts to this subject, he expressed high  hopes as to what the coming era would bring to Woman. He had been much  pleased with the dignified courage of Mrs. Jameson in taking up the  defence of her sex in from which women usually shrink, because, if  they express themselves on such subjects with sufficient force and  clearness to do any good, they are exposed to assaults whose vulgarity  makes them painful. In intercourse with such a woman, he had shared  her indignation at the base injustice, in many respects, and in many  regions, done to the sex; and been led to think of it far more than  ever before. He seemed to think that he might some time write upon the  subject. That his aid is withdrawn from the cause is a subject of  great regret; for, on this question as on others, he would have known  how to sum up the evidence, and take, in the noblest spirit, middle  ground. He always furnished a platform on which opposing parties could  stand and look at one another under the influence of his mildness and  enlightened candor.    Two younger thinkers, men both, have uttered noble prophecies,  auspicious for Woman. Kinmont, all whose thoughts tended towards the  establishment of the reign of love and peace, thought that the  inevitable means of this would be an increased predominance given to  the idea of Woman. Had he lived longer, to see the growth of the Peace  Party, the reforms in life and medical practice which seek to  substitute water for wine and drugs, pulse for animal food, he would  have been confirmed in his view of the way in which the desired  changes are to be effected.    In this connection I must mention Shelley, who, like all men of  genius, shared the feminine development, and, unlike many, knew it.  His life was one of the first pulse-beats in the present  reform-growth. He, too, abhorred blood and heat, and, by his system  and his song, tended to reinstate a plant-like gentleness in the  development of energy. In harmony with this, his ideas of marriage  were lofty, and, of course, no less so of Woman, her nature, and  destiny.    For Woman, if, by a sympathy as to outward condition, she is led to  aid the enfranchisement of the slave, must be no less so, by inward  tendency, to favor measures which promise to bring the world more  thoroughly and deeply into harmony with her nature. When the lamb  takes place of the lion as the emblem of nations, both women and men  will be as children of one spirit, perpetual learners of the word and  doers thereof, not hearers only.    A writer in the New York Pathfinder, in two articles headed  \"Femality,\" has uttered a still more pregnant word than any we have  named. He views Woman truly from the soul, and not from society, and  the depth and leading of his thoughts are proportionably remarkable.  He views the feminine nature as a harmonizer of the vehement elements,  and this has often been hinted elsewhere; but what he expresses most  forcibly is the lyrical, the inspiring and inspired apprehensiveness  of her being.    This view being identical with what I have before attempted to  indicate, as to her superior susceptibility to magnetic or electric  influence, I will now try to express myself more fully.    There are two aspects of Woman's nature, represented by the ancients  as Muse and Minerva. It is the former to which the writer in the  Pathfinder looks. It is the latter which Wordsworth has in mind, when  he says,                          \"With a placid brow,    Which woman ne'er should forfeit, keep thy vow.\"      The especial genius of Woman I believe to be electrical in movement,  intuitive in function, spiritual in tendency. She excels not so easily  in classification, or recreation, as in an instinctive seizure of  causes, and a simple breathing out of what she receives, that has the  singleness of life, rather than the selecting and energizing of art.    More native is it to her to be the living model of the artist than to  set apart from herself any one form in objective reality; more native  to inspire and receive the poem, than to create it. In so far as soul  is in her completely developed, all soul is the same, but in so far as  it is modified in her as Woman, it flows, it breathes, it sings,  rather than deposits soil, or finishes work; and that which is  especially feminine flushes, in blossom, the face of earth, and  pervades, like air and water, all this seeming solid globe, daily  renewing and purifying its life. Such may be the especially feminine  element spoken of as Femality. But it is no more the order of nature  that it should be incarnated pure in any form, than that the masculine  energy should exist unmingled with it in any form.    Male and female represent the two sides of the great radical dualism.  But, in fact, they are perpetually passing into one another. Fluid  hardens to solid, solid rushes to fluid. There is no wholly masculine  man, no purely feminine woman.    History jeers at the attempts of physiologists to bind great original  laws by the forms which flow from them. They make a rule; they say  from observation what can and cannot be. In vain! Nature provides  exceptions to every rule. She sends women to battle, and sets Hercules  spinning; she enables women to bear immense burdens, cold, and frost;  she enables the man, who feels maternal love, to nourish his infant  like a mother. Of late she plays still gayer pranks. Not only she  deprives organizations, but organs, of a necessary end. She enables  people to read with the top of the head, and see with the pit of the  stomach. Presently she will make a female Newton, and a male Syren.    Man partakes of the feminine in the Apollo, Woman of the masculine as  Minerva.    What I mean by the Muse is that unimpeded clearness of the intuitive  powers, which a perfectly truthful adherence to every admonition of  the higher instincts would bring to a finely organized human being. It  may appear as prophecy or as poesy. It enabled Cassandra to foresee  the results of actions passing round her; the Seeress to behold the  true character of the person through the mask of his customary life.  (Sometimes she saw a feminine form behind the man, sometimes the  reverse.) It enabled the daughter of Linnaeus to see the soul of the  flower exhaling from the flower. [Footnote: The daughter of Linnaeus  states, that, while looking steadfastly at the red lily, she saw its  spirit hovering above it, as a red flame. It is true, this, like many  fair spirit-stories, may be explained away as an optical illusion, but  its poetic beauty and meaning would, even then, make it valuable, as  an illustration of the spiritual fact.] It gave a man, but a poet-man,  the power of which he thus speaks: \"Often in my contemplation of  nature, radiant intimations, and as it were sheaves of light, appear  before me as to the facts of cosmogony, in which my mind has, perhaps,  taken especial part.\" He wisely adds, \"but it is necessary with  earnestness to verify the knowledge we gain by these flashes of  light.\" And none should forget this. Sight must be verified by light  before it can deserve the honors of piety and genius.

Ye cud say nothin' to help me, an' yet ye niver knew  what cause I had to be what I am.\"    \"Begin at the beginning and go on to the end,\" I said, royally. \"But rake  up the fire a bit first.\"    I passed Ortheris's bayonet for a poker.    \"That shows how little we know what we do,\" said Mulvaney, putting it  aside. \"Fire takes all the heart out av the steel, an' the next time, may  be, that our little man is fighting for his life his bradawl 'll break,  an' so you'll ha' killed him, manin' no more than to kape yourself warm.  'Tis a recruity's thrick that. Pass the clanin'-rod, sorr.\"    I snuggled down abased; and after an interval the voice of Mulvaney began.    \"Did I iver tell you how Dinah Shadd came to be wife av mine?\"    I dissembled a burning anxiety that I had felt for some months--ever since  Dinah Shadd, the strong, the patient, and the infinitely tender, had of  her own good love and free will washed a shirt for me, moving in a barren  land where washing was not.    \"I can't remember,\" I said, casually. \"Was it before or after you made  love to Annie Bragin, and got no satisfaction?\"    The story of Annie Bragin is written in another place. It is one of the  many less respectable episodes in Mulvaney's checkered career.    \"Before--before--long before, was that business av Annie Bragin an' the  corp'ril's ghost. Niver woman was the worse for me whin I had married  Dinah. There's a time for all things, an' I know how to kape all things in  place--barrin' the dhrink, that kapes me in my place wid no hope av comin'  to be aught else.\"    \"Begin at the beginning,\" I insisted. \"Mrs. Mulvaney told me that you  married her when you were quartered in Krab Bokhar barracks.\"    \"An' the same is a cess-pit,\" said Mulvaney, piously. \"She spoke thrue,  did Dinah. 'Twas this way. Talkin' av that, have ye iver fallen in love,  sorr?\"    I preserved the silence of the damned. Mulvaney continued--    \"Thin I will assume that ye have not. _I_ did. In the days av my youth, as  I have more than wanst tould you, I was a man that filled the eye an'  delighted the sowl av women. Niver man was hated as I have bin. Niver man  was loved as I--no, not within half a day's march av ut! For the first  five years av my service, whin I was what I wud give my sowl to be now, I  tuk whatever was within my reach an' digested ut--an' that's more than  most men can say. Dhrink I tuk, an' ut did me no harm. By the Hollow av  Hiven, I cud play wid four women at wanst, an' kape them from findin' out  anythin' about the other three, an' smile like a fullblown marigold  through ut all. Dick Coulhan, av the battery we'll have down on us  to-night, could drive his team no better than I mine, an' I hild the  worser cattle! An' so I lived, an' so I was happy till afther that  business wid Annie Bragin--she that turned me off as cool as a meat-safe,  an' taught me where I stud in the mind av an honest woman. 'Twas no sweet  dose to swallow.    \"Afther that I sickened awhile an' tuk thought to my reg'mental work;  conceiting mesilf I wud study an' be a sargint, an' a major-gineral twinty  minutes afther that. But on top av my ambitiousness there was an empty  place in my sowl, an' me own opinion av mesilf cud not fill ut. Sez I to  mesilf, 'Terence, you're a great man an' the best set-up in the reg'mint.  Go on an' get promotion.' Sez mesilf to me, 'What for?' Sez I to mesilf,  'For the glory av ut!' Sez mesilf to me, 'Will that fill these two strong  arrums av yours, Terence?' 'Go to the devil,' sez I to mesilf, 'Go to the  married lines,' sez mesilf to me. 'Tis the same thing,' sez I to mesilf.  'Av you're the same man, ut is,' said mesilf to me; an' wid that I  considhered on ut a long while. Did you iver feel that way, sorr?\"    I snored gently, knowing that if Mulvaney were uninterrupted he would go  on. The clamor from the bivouac fires beat up to the stars, as the rival  singers of the companies were pitted against each other.    \"So I felt that way an' a bad time ut was. Wanst, bein' a fool, I wint  into the married lines more for the sake av spakin' to our ould  color-sergint Shadd than for any thruck wid womenfolk. I was a corp'ril  then--rejuced aftherward, but a corp'ril then. I've got a photograft av  mesilf to prove ut. 'You'll take a cup av tay wid us?' sez Shadd. 'I will  that,' I sez, 'tho' tay is not my divarsion.'    \"''Twud be better for you if ut were,' sez ould Mother Shadd, an' she had  ought to know, for Shadd, in the ind av his service, dhrank bung-full each  night.    \"Wid that I tuk off my gloves--there was pipe-clay in thim, so that they  stud alone--an' pulled up my chair, lookin' round at the china ornaments  an' bits av things in the Shadds' quarters. They were things that belonged  to a man, an' no camp-kit, here to-day an' dishipated next. 'You're  comfortable in this place, sergint,' sez I. ''Tis the wife that did ut,  boy,' sez he, pointin' the stem av his pipe to ould Mother Shadd, an' she  smacked the top av his bald head apon the compliment. 'That manes you want  money,' sez she.    \"An' thin--an' thin whin the kettle was to be filled, Dinah came in--my  Dinah--her sleeves rowled up to the elbow an' her hair in a winkin' glory  over her forehead, the big blue eyes beneath twinklin' like stars on a  frosty night, an' the tread av her two feet lighter than wastepaper from  the colonel's basket in ord'ly-room whin ut's emptied. Bein' but a shlip  av a girl she went pink at seein' me, an' I twisted me moustache an'  looked at a picture forninst the wall. Niver show a woman that ye care the  snap av a finger for her, an' begad she'll come bleatin' to your  boot-heels!\"    \"I suppose that's why you followed Annie Bragin till everybody in the  married quarters laughed at you,\" said I, remembering that unhallowed  wooing and casting off the disguise of drowsiness.    \"I'm layin' down the gin'ral theory av the attack,\" said Mulvaney, driving  his boot into the dying fire. \"If you read the _Soldier's Pocket Book_,  which niver any soldier reads, you'll see that there are exceptions. Whin  Dinah was out av the door (an' 'twas as tho' the sunlight had shut  too)--'Mother av Hiven, sergint,' sez I, 'but is that your  daughter?'--'I've believed that way these eighteen years,' sez ould Shadd,  his eyes twinklin'; 'but Mrs. Shadd has her own opinion, like iv'ry  woman,'--'Tis wid yours this time, for a mericle,' sez Mother Shadd. 'Thin  why in the name av fortune did I niver see her before?' sez I. 'Bekaze  you've been thrapesin' round wid the married women these three years past.  She was a bit av a child till last year, an' she shot up wid the spring,'  sez ould Mother Shadd, 'I'll thrapese no more,' sez I. 'D'you mane that?'  sez ould Mother Shadd, lookin' at me side-ways like a hen looks at a hawk  whin the chickens are runnin' free. 'Try me, an' tell,' sez I. Wid that I  pulled on my gloves, dhrank off the tay, an' went out av the house as  stiff as at gin'ral p'rade, for well I knew that Dinah Shadd's eyes were  in the small av my back out av the scullery window. Faith! that was the  only time I mourned I was not a cav'lry man for the pride av the spurs to  jingle.    \"I wint out to think, an' I did a powerful lot av thinkin', but ut all  came round to that shlip av a girl in the dotted blue dhress, wid the blue  eyes an' the sparkil in them. Thin I kept off canteen, an' I kept to the  married quarthers, or near by, on the chanst av meetin' Dinah. Did I meet  her? Oh, my time past, did I not; wid a lump in my throat as big as my  valise an' my heart goin' like a farrier's forge on a Saturday morning?  'Twas 'Good day to ye, Miss Dinah,' an' 'Good day t'you, corp'ril,' for a  week or two, and divil a bit further could I get bekaze av the respect I  had to that girl that I cud ha' broken betune finger an' thumb.\"    Here I giggled as I recalled the gigantic figure of Dinah Shadd when she  handed me my shirt.    \"Ye may laugh,\" grunted Mulvaney. \"But I'm speakin' the trut', an' 'tis  you that are in fault. Dinah was a girl that wud ha' taken the  imperiousness out av the Duchess av Clonmel in those days. Flower hand,  foot av shod air, an' the eyes av the livin' mornin' she had that is my  wife to-day--ould Dinah, and niver aught else than Dinah Shadd to me.    \"'Twas after three weeks standin' off an' on, an' niver makin' headway  excipt through the eyes, that a little drummer boy grinned in me face whin  I had admonished him wid the buckle av my belt for riotin' all over the  place, 'An' I'm not the only wan that doesn't kape to barricks,' sez he. I  tuk him by the scruff av his neck,--my heart was hung on a hair-thrigger  those days, you will onderstand--an' 'Out wid ut,' sez I, 'or I'll lave no  bone av you unbreakable,'--'Speak to Dempsey,' sez he howlin'. 'Dempsey  which?' sez I, 'ye unwashed limb av Satan.'--'Av the Bob-tailed  Dhragoons,' sez he, 'He's seen her home from her aunt's house in the civil  lines four times this fortnight,'--'Child!' sez I, dhroppin' him, 'your  tongue's stronger than your body. Go to your quarters. I'm sorry I  dhressed you down.'    \"At that I went four ways to wanst huntin' Dempsey. I was mad to think  that wid all my airs among women I shud ha' been chated by a basin-faced  fool av a cav'lryman not fit to trust on a trunk. Presintly I found him in  our lines--the Bobtails was quartered next us--an' a tallowy, topheavy son  av a she-mule he was wid his big brass spurs an' his plastrons on his  epigastrons an' all. But he niver flinched a hair.    \"'A word wid you, Dempsey,' sez I. 'You've walked wid Dinah Shadd four  times this fortnight gone.'    \"'What's that to you?' sez he. 'I'll walk forty times more, an' forty on  top av that, ye shovel-futted clod-breakin' infantry lance-corp'ril.'    \"Before I cud gyard he had his gloved fist home on my cheek an' down I  went full-sprawl. 'Will that content you?' "]]]
