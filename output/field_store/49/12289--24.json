Three more were killed as they went up the  slope, and two as they passed near the terrible cavern. Fate let the rest  go some way down the mountain upon the other side, and then took three of  them. Camorak and Arleon alone were left alive. And night came down on the  valley to which they had come, and was lit by flashes from the fatal  mountain; and the two mourned for their comrades all night long.    But when the morning came they remembered their war with Fate, and their  old resolve to come to Carcassonne, and the voice of Arleon rose in a  quavering song, and snatches of music from his old harp, and he stood up  and marched with his face southwards as he had done for years, and behind  him Camorak went. And when at last they climbed from the third valley, and  stood on the hill's summit in the golden sunlight of evening, their aged  eyes saw only miles of forest and the birds going to roost.    Their beards were white, and they had travelled very far and hard; it was  the time with them when a man rests from labours and dreams in light sleep  of the years that were and not of the years to come.    Long they looked southwards; and the sun set over remoter forests, and  glow-worms lit their lamps, and the inspiration of Arleon rose and flew  away for ever, to gladden, perhaps, the dreams of younger men.    And Arleon said: \"My King, I know no longer the way to Carcassonne.\"    And Camorak smiled, as the aged smile, with little cause for mirth, and  said: \"The years are going by us like huge birds, whom Doom and Destiny  and the schemes of God have frightened up out of some old grey marsh. And  it may well be that against these no warrior may avail, and that Fate has  conquered us, and that our quest has failed.\"    And after this they were silent.    Then they drew their swords, and side by side went down into the forest,  still seeking Carcassonne.    I think they got not far; for there were deadly marshes in that forest,  and gloom that outlasted the nights, and fearful beasts accustomed to its  ways. Neither is there any legend, either in verse or among the songs of  the people of the fields, of any having come to Carcassonne.          IN ZACCARATH      \"Come,\" said the King in sacred Zaccarath, \"and let our prophets prophesy  before us.\"    A far-seen jewel of light was the holy palace, a wonder to the nomads on  the plains.    There was the King with all his underlords, and the lesser kings that did  him vassalage, and there were all his queens with all their jewels upon  them.    Who shall tell of the splendour in which they sat; of the thousand lights  and the answering emeralds; of the dangerous beauty of that hoard of  queens, or the flash of their laden necks?    There was a necklace there of rose-pink pearls beyond the art of the  dreamer to imagine. Who shall tell of the amethyst chandeliers, where  torches, soaked in rare Bhyrinian oils, burned and gave off a scent of  blethany?    (This herb marvellous, which, growing near the summit of Mount Zaumnos,  scents all the Zaumnian range, and is smelt far out on the Kepuscran  plains, and even, when the wind is from the mountains, in the streets of  the city of Ognoth. At night it closes its petals and is heard to breathe,  and its breath is a swift poison. This it does even by day if the snows  are disturbed about it. No plant of this has ever been captured alive by a  hunter.)    Enough to say that when the dawn came up it appeared by contrast pallid  and unlovely and stripped bare of all its glory, so that it hid itself  with rolling clouds.    \"Come,\" said the King, \"let our prophets prophesy.\"    Then the heralds stepped through the ranks of the King's silk-clad  warriors who lay oiled and scented upon velvet cloaks, with a pleasant  breeze among them caused by the fans of slaves; even their casting-spears  were set with jewels; through their ranks the heralds went with mincing  steps, and came to the prophets, clad in brown and black, and one of them  they brought and set him before the King. And the King looked at him and  said, \"Prophesy unto us.\"    And the prophet lifted his head, so that his beard came clear from his  brown cloak, and the fans of the slaves that fanned the warriors wafted  the tip of it a little awry. And he spake to the King, and spake thus:    \"Woe unto thee, King, and woe unto Zaccarath. Woe unto thee, and woe unto  thy women, for your fall shall be sore and soon. Already in Heaven the  gods shun thy god: they know his doom and what is written of him: he sees  oblivion before him like a mist. Thou hast aroused the hate of the  mountaineers. They hate thee all along the crags of Droom. The evilness of  thy days shall bring down the Zeedians on thee as the suns of springtide  bring the avalanche down. They shall do unto Zaccarath as the avalanche  doth unto the hamlets of the valley.\" When the queens chattered or  tittered among themselves, he merely raised his voice and still spake on:  \"Woe to these walls and the carven things upon them. The hunter shall know  the camping-places of the nomads by the marks of the camp-fires on the  plain, but he shall not know the place of Zaccarath.\"    A few of the recumbent warriors turned their heads to glance at the  prophet when he ceased. Far overhead the echoes of his voice hummed on  awhile among the cedarn rafters.    \"Is he not splendid?\" said the King. And many of that assembly beat with  their palms upon the polished floor in token of applause. Then the prophet  was conducted back to his place at the far end of that mighty hall, and  for a while musicians played on marvellous curved horns, while drums  throbbed behind them hidden in a recess. The musicians were sitting  crosslegged on the floor, all blowing their huge horns in the brilliant  torchlight, but as the drums throbbed louder in the dark they arose and  moved slowly nearer to the King. Louder and louder drummed the drums in  the dark, and nearer and nearer moved the men with the horns, so that  their music should not be drowned by the drums before it reached the King.    A marvellous scene it was when the tempestuous horns were halted before  the King, and the drums in the dark were like the thunder of God; and the  queens were nodding their heads in time to the music, with their diadems  flashing like heavens of falling stars; and the warriors lifted their  heads and shook, as they lifted them, the plumes of those golden birds  which hunters wait for by the Liddian lakes, in a whole lifetime killing  scarcely six, to make the crests that the warriors wore when they feasted  in Zaccarath. Then the King shouted and the warriors sang--almost they  remembered then old battle-chants. And, as they sang, the sound of the  drums dwindled, and the musicians walked away backwards, and the drumming  became fainter and fainter as they walked, and altogether ceased, and they  blew no more on their fantastic horns. Then the assemblage beat on the  floor with their palms. And afterwards the queens besought the King to  send for another prophet. And the heralds brought a singer, and placed him  before the King; and the singer was a young man with a harp. And he swept  the strings of it, and when there was silence he sang of the iniquity of  the King. And he foretold the onrush of the Zeedians, and the fall and the  forgetting of Zaccarath, and the coming again of the desert to its own,  and the playing about of little lion cubs where the courts of the palace  had stood.    \"Of what is he singing?\" said a queen to a queen.    \"He is singing of everlasting Zaccarath.\"    As the singer ceased the assemblage beat listlessly on the floor, and the  King nodded to him, and he departed.    When all the prophets had prophesied to them and all the singers sung,  that royal company arose and went to other chambers, leaving the hall of  festival to the pale and lonely dawn. And alone were left the lion-headed  gods that were carven out of the walls; silent they stood, and their rocky  arms were folded. And shadows over their faces moved like curious thoughts  as the torches flickered and the dull dawn crossed the fields. And the  colours began to change in the chandeliers.    When the last lutanist fell asleep the birds began to sing.    Never was greater splendour or a more famous hall. When the queens went  away through the curtained door with all their diadems, it was as though  the stars should arise in their stations and troop together to the West at  sunrise.    And only the other day I found a stone that had undoubtedly been a part of  Zaccarath, it was three inches long and an inch broad; I saw the edge of  it uncovered by the sand. I believe that only three other pieces have been  found like it.          THE FIELD      When one has seen Spring's blossom fall in London, and Summer appear and  ripen and decay, as it does early in cities, and one is in London still,  then, at some moment or another, the country places lift their flowery  heads and call to one with an urgent, masterful clearness, upland behind  upland in the twilight like to some heavenly choir arising rank on rank to  call a drunkard from his gambling-hell. No volume of traffic can drown the  sound of it, no lure of London can weaken its appeal. Having heard it  one's fancy is gone, and evermore departed, to some coloured pebble agleam  in a rural brook, and all that London can offer is swept from one's mind  like some suddenly smitten metropolitan Goliath.    The call is from afar both in leagues and years, for the hills that call  one are the hills that were, and their voices are the voices of long ago,  when the elf-kings still had horns.    I see them now, those hills of my infancy (for it is they that call), with  their faces upturned to the purple twilight, and the faint diaphanous  figures of the fairies peering out from under the bracken to see if  evening is come.

It cannot be for any particular  protection to the tongue, as the tongue is a perfect feather.    The flight of the toucan is by jerks: in the action of flying it seems  incommoded by this huge disproportioned feature, and the head seems as  if bowed down to the earth by it against its will. If the extraordinary  form and size of the bill expose the toucan to ridicule, its colours  make it amends. Were a specimen of each species of the toucan presented  to you, you would pronounce the bill of the bouradi the most rich and  beautiful: on the ridge of the upper mandible a broad stripe of most  lovely yellow extends from the head to the point; a stripe of the same  breadth, though somewhat deeper yellow, falls from it at right angles  next the head down to the edge of the mandible; then follows a black  stripe, half as broad, falling at right angles from the ridge and  running narrower along the edge to within half an inch of the point.  The rest of the mandible is a deep bright red. The lower mandible has  no yellow: its black and red are distributed in the same manner as on  the upper one, with this difference, that there is black about an inch  from the point. The stripe corresponding to the deep yellow stripe on  the upper mandible is sky-blue. It is worthy of remark that all these  brilliant colours of the bill are to be found in the plumage of the  body and the bare skin round the eye.    All these colours, except the blue, are inherent in the horn: that part  which appears blue is in reality transparent white, and receives its  colour from a thin piece of blue skin inside. This superb bill fades in  death, and in three or four days' time has quite lost its original  colours.    Till within these few years no idea of the true colours of the bill  could be formed from the stuffed toucans brought to Europe. About eight  years ago, while eating a boiled toucan, the thought struck me that the  colours in the bill of a preserved specimen might be kept as bright as  those in life. A series of experiments proved this beyond a doubt. If  you take your penknife and cut away the roof of the upper mandible, you  will find that the space betwixt it and the outer shell contains a  large collection of veins and small osseous fibres running in all  directions through the whole extent of the bill. Clear away all these  with your knife, and you will come to a substance more firm than skin,  but of not so strong a texture as the horn itself. Cut this away also,  and behind it is discovered a thin and tender membrane: yellow where it  has touched the yellow part of the horn, blue where it has touched the  red part, and black towards the edge and point; when dried this thin  and tender membrane becomes nearly black; as soon as it is cut away  nothing remains but the outer horn, red and yellow, and now become  transparent. The under mandible must undergo the same operation. Great  care must be taken and the knife used very cautiously when you are  cutting through the different parts close to where the bill joins on to  the head: if you cut away too much the bill drops off; if you press too  hard the knife comes through the horn; if you leave too great a portion  of the membrane it appears through the horn and, by becoming black when  dried, makes the horn appear black also, and has a bad effect.  Judgment, caution, skill and practice will ensure success.    You have now cleared the bill of all those bodies which are the cause  of its apparent fading, for, as has been said before, these bodies dry  in death and become quite discoloured, and appear so through the horn;  and reviewing the bill in this state, you conclude that its former  bright colours are lost.    Something still remains to be done. You have rendered the bill  transparent by the operation, and that transparency must be done away  to make it appear perfectly natural. Pound some clean chalk and give it  enough water till it be of the consistency of tar, add a proportion of  gum-arabic to make it adhesive, then take a camel-hair brush and give  the inside of both mandibles a coat; apply a second when the first is  dry, then another, and a fourth to finish all. The gum-arabic will  prevent the chalk from cracking and falling off. If you remember, there  is a little space of transparent white in the lower mandible which  originally appeared blue, but which became transparent white as soon as  the thin piece of blue skin was cut away: this must be painted blue  inside. When all this is completed the bill will please you: it will  appear in its original colours. Probably your own abilities will  suggest a cleverer mode of operating than the one here described. A  small gouge would assist the penknife and render the operation less  difficult.    The houtou ranks high in beauty amongst the birds of Demerara. His  whole body is green, with a bluish cast in the wings and tail; his  crown, which he erects at pleasure, consists of black in the centre,  surrounded with lovely blue of two different shades; he has a  triangular black spot, edged with blue, behind the eye extending to the  ear, and on his breast a sable tuft consisting of nine feathers edged  also with blue. This bird seems to suppose that its beauty can be  increased by trimming the tail, which undergoes the same operation as  our hair in a barber's shop, only with this difference, that it uses  its own beak, which is serrated, in lieu of a pair of scissors. As soon  as his tail is full grown, he begins about an inch from the extremity  of the two longest feathers in it and cuts away the web on both sides  of the shaft, making a gap about an inch long. Both male and female  adonise their tails in this manner, which gives them a remarkable  appearance amongst all other birds. While we consider the tail of the  houtou blemished and defective, were he to come amongst us he would  probably consider our heads, cropped and bald, in no better light. He  who wishes to observe this handsome bird in his native haunts must be  in the forest at the morning's dawn. The houtou shuns the society of  man: the plantations and cultivated parts are too much disturbed to  engage it to settle there; the thick and gloomy forests are the places  preferred by the solitary houtou.    In those far-extending wilds, about daybreak, you hear him articulate,  in a distinct and mournful tone, \"houtou, houtou.\" Move cautious on to  where the sound proceeds from, and you will see him sitting in the  underwood about a couple of yards from the ground, his tail moving up  and down every time he articulates \"houtou.\" He lives on insects and  the berries amongst the underwood, and very rarely is seen in the lofty  trees, except the bastard siloabali-tree, the fruit of which is  grateful to him. He makes no nest, but rears his young in a hole in the  sand, generally on the side of a hill.    While in quest of the houtou, you will now and then fall in with the  jay of Guiana, called by the Indians ibibirou. Its forehead is black,  the rest of the head white, the throat and breast like the English  magpie; about an inch of the extremity of the tail is white, the other  part of it, together with the back and wings, a greyish changing  purple; the belly is white. There are generally six or eight of them in  company: they are shy and garrulous, and tarry a very short time in one  place. They are never seen in the cultivated parts.    Through the whole extent of the forest, chiefly from sunrise till nine  o'clock in the morning, you hear a sound of \"wow, wow, wow, wow.\" This  is the bird called boclora by the Indians. It is smaller than the  common pigeon, and seems, in some measure, to partake of its nature:  its head and breast are blue; the back and rump somewhat resemble the  colour on the peacock's neck; its belly is a bright yellow. The legs  are so very short that it always appears as if sitting on the branch:  it is as ill-adapted for walking as the swallow. Its neck, for above an  inch all round, is quite bare of feathers, but this deficiency is not  seen, for it always sits with its head drawn in upon its shoulders. It  sometimes feeds with the cotingas on the guava- and hitia-trees, but  its chief nutriment seems to be insects, and, like most birds which  follow this prey, its chaps are well armed with bristles: it is found  in Demerara at all times of the year, and makes a nest resembling that  of the stock-dove. This bird never takes long nights, and when it  crosses a river or creek it goes by long jerks.    The boclora is very unsuspicious, appearing quite heedless of danger:  the report of a gun within twenty yards will not cause it to leave the  branch on which it is sitting, and you may often approach it so near as  almost to touch it with the end of your bow. Perhaps there is no bird  known whose feathers are so slightly fixed to the skin as those of the  boclora. After shooting it, if it touch a branch in its descent, or if  it drop on hard ground, whole heaps of feathers fall off: on this  account it is extremely hard to procure a specimen for preservation. As  soon as the skin is dry in the preserved specimen the feathers become  as well fixed as those in any other bird.    Another species, larger than the boclora, attracts much of your notice  in these wilds: it is called cuia by the Indians, from the sound of its  voice. Its habits are the same as those of the boclora, but its colours  different: its head, breast, back and rump are a shining, changing  green; its tail not quite so bright; a black bar runs across the tail  towards the extremity, and the outside feathers are partly white, as in  the boclora; its belly is entirely vermilion, a bar of white separating  it from the green on the breast.    There are diminutives of both these birds: they have the same habits,  with a"]]]
