Every one,  panic-stricken, fled before them. Every one but this old lady, who  stood there bidding defiance to all the Kaiser's horses and all the  Kaiser's men.    \"I saw them smashing in the door of the house across the way,\"  said Madame Callebaut, \"and when the flames burst forth they  rushed over here, and I fell down on my knees before them, crying  out, 'For the love of Heaven, spare an old woman's house!'\"    It must have been a dramatic, soul-curdling sight, with the wail of  the woman rising above the crashing walls and the roaring flames.  And it must have been effective pleading to stop men in their wild  rush lusting to destroy. But Madame Callebaut was endowed with  powerful emotions. Carried away in her recital of the events, she  fell down on her knees before me, wringing her hands and  pleading so piteously that I felt for a moment as if I were a fiendish  Teuton with a firebrand about to set the old lady's house afire. I  can understand how the wildest men capitulated to such pleadings,  and how they came down the steps to write, in big, clear words,    \"NICHT ANBRENNEN\"  (Do not set fire)    Only they unwittingly wrote it upon her neighbor's walls, thus  saving both houses.    How much a savior of other homes Madame Callebaut had been  Termonde will never know. Certainly she made the firing squad  first pause in the wild debauch of destruction. For frequently now  an undamaged house stood with the words chalked on its front,  \"Only harmless old woman lives here; do not burn down.\"  Underneath were the numbers and initials of the particular corps of  the Kaiser's Imperial Army. Often the flames had committed Lese  majeste by leaping onto the forbidden house, and there amidst the  charred ruins stood a door or a wall bearing the mocking  inscription, \"Nicht Anbrennen.\"    Another house, belonging to Madame Louise Bal, bore the words,  \"Protected; Gute alte Leute hier\" (good old people here). A great  shell from a distant battery had totally disregarded this sign and  had torn through the parlor, exploding in the back yard, ripping the  clothes from the line, but touching neither of the inmates. As the  Chinese ambassador pertinently remarked when reassured by  Whitlock that the Germans would not bombard the embassies,  \"Ah! but a cannon has no eyes.\"    These houses stood up like lone survivors above the wreckage  wrought by fire and shell, and by contrast served to emphasize the  dismal havoc everywhere. \"So this was once a city,\" one mused to  himself; \"and these streets, now sounding with the footfalls of  some returning sentry, did they once echo with the roar of traffic?  And those demolished shops, were they once filled with the babble  of the traders? Over yonder in that structure, which looks so much  like a church, did the faithful once come to pray and to worship  God? Can it be that these courtyards, now held in the thrall of  death-like silence, once rang to the laughter of the little children?\"  One said to himself, \"Surely this is some wild dream. Wake up.\"    But hardly a dream, for here were the ruins of a real city, and fresh  ruins, too. Still curling up from the church was smoke from the  burning rafters, and over there the hungry dogs, and the stragglers  mournfully digging something out of the ruins. However preposterous  it seemed, none the less it was a city that yesterday ran high with  the tide of human life. And thousands of people, when they recall  the lights and shadows, the pains and raptures, which make up the  thing we call life, will think of Termonde. Thousands of people,  when they think of home and all the tender memories that cluster  round that word, say \"Termonde.\"' And now where Termonde was  there is a big black ragged spot--an ugly gaping wound in the  landscape. There are a score of other wounds like that.    There are thousands of them.    There is one bleeding in every Belgian heart.    The sight of their desolated cities cut the soldiers to the quick.    They turned the names of those cities into battle cries. Shouting  \"Remember Termonde and Louvain,\" these Belgians sprang from  the trenches and like wild men flung themselves upon the foe.          Chapter XI    Atrocities And The Socialist        \"With these sentries holding us up at every cross-roads, there is no  use trying to get to Antwerp,\" said the free-lance.    \"Yes, there is,\" retorted the chauffeur. \"Watch me the next time.\"  He beckoned to the first sentry barring the way, and, leaning over,  whispered into the man's ear a single word. The sentry saluted,  and, stepping to one side, motioned us on in a manner almost  deferential. We had hardly been compelled to stop.    After our tedious delays this was quite exhilarating. How our  chauffeur obtained the password we did not know, nor did we  challenge the inclusion of 8 francs extra in his memorandum of  expenses. As indicated, he was a man of parts. The magic word of  the day, \"France,\" now opened every gate to us.    Behind the Antwerp fortifications the Belgian sappers and miners  were on an organized rampage of destruction. On a wide zone  every house, windmill and church was either going up in flames or  being hammered level to the ground.    We came along as the oil was applied to an old house and saw  the flames go crackling up through the rafters. The black smoke  curled away across the wasted land and the fire glowed upon the  stolid faces of the soldiers and the trembling woman who owned it.  To her it was a funeral pyre. Her home endeared by lifetime  memories was being offered up on the altar of Liberty and  Independence. Starting with the invaders on the western frontier,  clear through to Antwerp by the sea, a wild black swathe had been  burnt.    By such drastic methods space was cleared for the guns in the  Belgian forts, and to the advancing besiegers no protection would  be offered from the raking fire. The heart of a steel-stock owner  would have rejoiced to see the maze of wire entanglement that ran  everywhere. In one place a tomato-field had been wired; the green  vines, laden with their rich red fruit, were intertwined with the steel  vines bearing their vicious blood-drawing barbs whose intent was  to make the red field redder still. We had just passed a gang  digging man-holes and spitting them with stakes, when an officer  cried:    \"Stop! No further passage here. You must turn back.\"    \"Why?\" we asked protestingly.    \"The entire road is being mined,\" he replied.    Even as he spoke we could see a liquid explosive being poured  into a sort of cup, and electric wires connected. The officer  pictured to us a regiment of soldiers advancing, with the full tide of  life running in their veins, laughing and singing as they marched in  the smiling sun. Suddenly the road rocks and hell heaves up  beneath their feet; bodies are blown into the air and rained back to  the earth in tiny fragments of human flesh; while brains are  spattered over the ground, and every crevice runs a rivulet of  blood. He sketched this in excellent English, adding:    \"A magnificent climax for Christian civilzation, eh! And that's my  business. But what else can one do?\"    For the task of setting this colossal stage for death, the entire  peasant population had been mobilized to assist the soldiers. In  self-defense Belgium was thus obliged to drive the dagger deep  into her own bosom. It seemed indeed as if she suffered as much  at her own hands, as at the hands of the enemy. To arrest the  advancing scourge she impressed into her service dynamite, fire  and flood. I saw the sluice-gates lifted and meadows which had  been waving with the golden grain of autumn now turned into silver  lakes. So suddenly had the waters covered the land that hay-  cocks bobbed upon the top of the flood, and peasants went out in  boats to dredge for the beets and turnips which lay beneath the  waters.    The roads were inundated and so we ran along an embankment  which, like a levee, lifted itself above the water wastes. The sun,  sinking down behind the flaming poplars in the west, was touching  the rippling surface into myriad colors. It was like a trip through  Fairyland, or it would have been, were not men on all sides busy  preparing for the bloody shambles.    After these elaborate defensive works the Belgians laughed at any  one taking Antwerp, the impregnable fortress of Western Europe.  The Germans laughed, too. But it was the bass, hollow laugh of  their great guns placed ten to twenty miles away, and pouring into  the city such a hurricane of shell and shrapnel that they forced its  evacuation by the British and the Belgians. Through this vast array  of works which the reception committee had designed for their  slaughter, the Germans came marching in as if on dress parade.    A few shells were even now crashing through Malines and had  played havoc with the carillon in the cathedral tower. During a lull  in the bombardment we climbed a stairway of the belfry where,  above us, balanced great stones which a slight jar would send  tumbling down. On and up we passed vents and jagged holes  which had been ripped through these massive walls as if they  were made of paper. It was enough to carry the weight of one's  somber reflections without the addition of cheerful queries of the  movie-man as to \"how would you feel if the German gunners  suddenly turned loose again?\"    We gathered in a deal of stone ornaments that had been shot  down and struggled with a load of them to our car. Later they  became a weight upon our conscience. When Cardinal Mercier  starts the rebuilding of his cathedral, we might surprise him with  the return of a considerable portion thereof. To fetch these  souvenirs through to England, we were compelled to resort to all  the tricks of a gang of smugglers.

One day,  seeing the devil writing in his pocket-book some sin committed by the  pope, he jumped upon his back and commanded his Satanic majesty to  carry him to Rome. The devil tried to make the bishop pronounce the  name of Jesus, which would break the spell, and then the devil would  have tossed his unwelcome burden into the sea, but the bishop only  cried, \"Gee up, devil!\" and when he reached Rome he was covered with  Alpine snow. The chronicler naively adds, \"the hat is still shown at  Rome in confirmation of this miracle.\"--_General Chronicle of King  Alphonso the Wise_.    ANTIG'ONE (4 _syl._), daughter of Oe'dipos and Jocas'te, a noble  maiden, with a truly heroic attachment to her father and brothers.  When Oedipos had blinded himself, and was obliged to quit Thebes,  Antigone accompanied him, and remained with him till his death, when  she returned to Thebes. Creon, the king, had forbidden any one to bury  Polyni'ces, her brother, who had been slain by his elder brother in  battle; but Antigone, in defiance of this prohibition, buried the dead  body, and Creon shut her up in a vault under ground, where she killed  herself. Haemon, her lover, killed himself also by her side. Sophocles  has a Greek tragedy on the subject, and it has been dramatized for the  English stage.    _The Modern Antigone_, Marie Therese Charlotte duchesse d'Angouleme,  daughter of Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette (1778-1851).    ANTIG'ONUS, a Sicilian lord, commanded by king Leontes to take his  infant daughter to a desert shore and leave her to perish. Antigonus  was driven by a storm to the coast of Bohemia, where he left the  babe; but on his way back to the ship, he was torn to pieces by a  bear.--Shakespeare, _The Winter's Tale_ (1604).    _Antig'onus (King)_, an old man with a young man's amorous passions.  He is one of the four kings who succeeded to the divided empire of  Alexander the Great.--Beaumont and Fletcher, _The Humorous Lieutenant_  (1647).    ANTIN'OUS (4 _syl_.), a page of Hadrian, the Roman emperor, noted for  his beauty.    _Antin'ous_ (4 _syl_.), son of Cas'silane (3 _syl_.) general of Candy,  and brother of An'no-phel, in _The Laws of Candy_ a drama by Beaumont  and Fletcher (1647).

ANTI'OPE (4 _syl_.), daughter of Idom'e-neus (4 _syl_.), for whom  Telem'achus had a _tendresse_. Mentor approved his choice, and assured  Telemachus that the lady was designed for him by the gods. Her charms  were \"the glowing modesty of her countenance, her silent diffidence,  and her sweet reserve; her constant attention to tapestry or to some  other useful and elegant employment; her diligence in household  affairs, her contempt of finery in dress, and her ignorance of her own  beauty,\" Telemachus says, \"She encourages to industry by her example,  sweetens labor by the melody of her voice, and excels the best of  painters in the elegance of her embroidery.\"--Fenelon, _Telemaque_,  xxii.

ANTIPH'OLUS, the name of two brothers, twins, the sons of Aege'on, a  merchant of Syracuse. The two brothers were shipwrecked in infancy,  and, being picked up by different cruisers, one was carried to  Syracuse, and the other to Ephesus. The Ephesian entered the service  of the duke, and, being fortunate enough to save the duke's life,  became a great man and married well. The Syracusian Antipholus, going  in search of his brother, came to Ephesus, where a series of blunders  occurs from the wonderful likeness of the two brothers and their  two servants called Dromio. The confusion becomes so great that the  Ephesian is taken up as a madman. It so happened that both brothers  appeared before the duke at the same time; and the extraordinary  likeness being seen by all, the cause of the blunders was evident,  and everything was satisfactorily explained.--Shakespeare, _Comedy of  Errors_ (1593).    ANTON (_Sir_). Tennyson says that Merlin gave Arthur, when an infant,  to sir Anton and his lady to bring up, and they brought him up as  their own son. This does not correspond with the _History of Prince  Arthur_, which states that he was committed to the care of sir Ector  and his lady, whose son, sir Key, is over and over again called the  prince's foster-brother. The _History_ furthermore states that Arthur  made sir Key his seneschal _because_ he was his foster-brother.      So the child was delivered unto Merlin, and he    bare him forth unto sir Ector, and made a holy    man christen him, and named him \"Arthur.\"    And so sir Ector's wife nourished him with her    own breast.--Part i. 3.      So sir Ector rode to the justs, and with him    rode sir Key, his son, and young Arthur that    was his nourished brother.--Ditto.      \"Sir,\" said sir Ector, \"I will ask no more of    you but that you will make my son, sir Key,    your foster-brother, seneschal of all your lands.\"    \"That shall be done,\" said Arthur (ch. 4).--Sir    T.

ANTONY _(Saint)_ lived in a cavern on the summit of Cavadonga, in  Spain, and was perpetually annoyed by devils.

Macbeth says that \"under Banquo his own genius was  rebuked [or snubbed], as it is said Mark Antony's was by Caesar\" (act  iii. sc. 1), and in _Antony and Cleopatra_ this passage is elucidated  thus--      Thy daemon, that's thy spirit which keeps thee, is    Noble, courageous, high, unmatchable,    Where Caesar's is not; but near him thy angel    Becomes a fear, as being overpowered.      Act ii. sc. 3.    ANVIL (_The Literary_). Dr. Mayo was so called, because he bore the  hardest blows of Dr. Johnson without flinching.    AODH, last of the Culdees, or primitive clergy of Io'na, an island  south of Staffa. His wife was Reullu'ra. Ulvfa'gre the Dane, having  landed on the island and put many to the sword, bound Aodh in  chains of iron, then dragging him to the church, demanded where the  \"treasures were concealed.\" A mysterious figure now appeared, which  not only released the priest, but took the Dane by the arm to the  statue of St. Columb, which fell on him and crushed him to death.  After this the \"saint\" gathered the remnant of the islanders together,  and went to Ireland.--Campbell, _Reullura_.    APE (1 _syl._), the pseudonym of M. Pellegrini, the caricaturist of  _Vanity Fair_. Dr. Johnson says \"_to ape_ is to imitate ludicrously;\"  whence the adoption of the name.    APEL'LES AND THE COBBLER. A cobbler found fault with the shoe-latchet  of one of Apelles' paintings, and the artist rectified the fault. The  cobbler, thinking himself very wise, next ventured to criticise the  legs; but Apelles said, _Ne sutor ultra crepidam_ (\"Let not the  cobbler go beyond his last\").    Within that range of criticism where all are equally judges, and where  Crispin is entitled to dictate to Apelles.--_Encyc. Brit._, Art.  \"Romance.\"    _Apelles_. When his famous painting of Venus rising out of the sea  (hung by Augustus in the temple of Julius Caesar) was greatly injured  by time, Nero replaced it by a copy done by Dorotheus. This Venus  by Apelles is called \"Venus Anadyom'-ene,\" his model (according to  tradition) being Campaspe (afterwards his wife).    APEMAN'TUS, a churlish Athenian philosopher, who snarled at men  systematically, but showed his cynicism to be mere affectation, when  Timon attacked him with his own weapons.--Shakespeare, _Timon of  Athens_ (1600).
