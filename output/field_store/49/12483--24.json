We stopped at Mustapha's house for a  cup of coffee and a discussion of events. The information which we secured  from him afterward proved unusually correct. I took him on with us to the  town so that he could identify the head man and see that we got hold of  the right people. Our reception was by no means cordial, although after we  had talked a little and explained what we were after, the mayor became  cheerful and expansive. He had a jovial, rotund face, covered in large  part by a bushy beard, and would have done excellently as a model for  Silenus. In the town were a handful of Turkish stragglers--among them a  stalwart Greek who spoke a little English. He said that he had been  impressed into service by the Turks and was most anxious to join our  forces.    We found large stores of ammunition and other supplies, among them a  wireless set. What interested us most, I am afraid, was the quantity of  chickens that we saw strutting about. A few of them and a good supply of  eggs found their way to the automobiles in short order. We were always  very particular about paying for whatever we took, and seeing that the men  did likewise; our reputation went before us, and the native, as a rule,  took it for granted that we would pay. It was up to the officers to see  that the prices were not exorbitant. We always used Indian currency--the  rupee and the anna. In normal times a rupee is about a third of a dollar.  Throughout the occupied area Turkish currency also circulated, but the  native invariably preferred to be paid in Indian. Curiously enough, even  on entering towns like Tauq, we found the inhabitants eager for payment in  rupees. I was told that in the money market in Baghdad a British advance  would be heralded by a slump in Turkish exchange. Paper rupees were almost  everywhere as readily accepted as silver, but paper liras and piasters  were soon of so little value that they were no longer in circulation.    When we got back to camp I found a wire informing me that I had been  transferred to the American army, and ordering me to report at once to  Baghdad to be sent to France. Major Thompson asked me if I would delay my  return until the end of the advance. It was rumored that we would continue  to push on and would attack Kirkuk. Many felt that the difficulty that was  already being experienced in rationing us would preclude our thrusting  farther. Still, I made up my mind that as long as the major wished it and  would wire for permission I would stay a few days longer on the chance of  the attack continuing.    On the morning of the 3d we moved camp to the far side of the Tauq Chai  bridge. When the tenders were unloaded I started back to bring up a supply  of gasolene, with the purpose of making a dump in case we were called upon  for a further advance. I was told that the nearest supply from which I  could draw was at Umr Maidan; and the prospect of running back, a distance  of seventy miles, was not cheerful. When I got as far as Tuz I found a  friend in charge of the dump there, and he let me draw what I wanted, so I  turned back to try to get to the bridge by dark. One car after another  got in trouble; first it was a puncture, then it was a tricky carburetor  that refused to be put to rights; towing-ropes were called into  requisition, but the best had been left behind, and those we had were  rotted, and broke on every hill. Lastly a broken axle put one of the  tenders definitely out of commission, and, of course, I had to wait behind  with it. To add to everything, a veritable hurricane set in, with thunder  and lightning and torrents of rain. The wind blew so hard that I thought  the car would be toppled over. What made us more gloomy than anything else  was the thought of all the dry river courses that would be roaring floods  by morning, and probably hold up the ration supply indefinitely.    Two days later the orders for which we had been waiting came through. We  were to march upon a town called Taza Khurmatli, lying fifteen miles  beyond Tauq and ten short of Kirkuk. If we met with no opposition there we  were to push straight on. From all we could hear Taza was occupied only by  cavalry, which would probably fall back without contesting our advance.  The cars had been out on reconnaissance near the town for the last two  days, and had come in for artillery and machine-gun fire; but it was  believed that the Turks had everything ready to withdraw their guns on our  approach.    In the gray light that preceded dawn we saw shadowy columns of infantry  and artillery and cavalry passing by our camp. The costumes of the  different regiments made a break in the drab monotony. The Mesopotamian  Expeditionary Force was composed of varied components. Steel helmets could  be worn only in winter. In many of the native regiments the British  officers wore tasselled pugrees, and long tunics that were really shirts,  and an adaption of the native custom of wearing the shirt-tails outside  the trousers. The Gurkhas were supplied with pith helmets. It was  generally claimed that this was unnecessary, but the authorities felt that  coming from a cold, high climate they would be as much affected by the  Mesopotamian sun as were Europeans. The presence of the Indian troops  brought about unusual additions to the dry \"General Routine Orders\" issued  by general headquarters. One of them, referring to a religious festival of  the Sikhs, ran:    \"The following cable message received from Sunder Signh Hagetha,  Amritsar, addressed to Sikhs in Mesopotamian force:    \"To our most Dear Brothers now serving the Benign King-Emperor oversea,  the chief Khalsa Dewan tenders hearty and sincere greetings on the  auspicious Gurpurb of First Guru. You are upholding the name and fame of  Gurupurb. Our hearts are with you and our prayers are that Satguru and  Akalpurkh may ever be with you and lead you to victory and return home  safe, after vanquishing the King-Emperor's foes, with honor and flying  colors.\"    The British Empire was well and loyally served by her Indian subjects, and  by none more faithfully than the Sikhs.    We let the column get well started before we shoved off in our cars. The  trail was wide enough to pass without interfering; and long before we were  in sight of Taza we had taken our place ahead. As was foreseen, the enemy  evacuated the town with scarce a show of resistance. I set off to  interview the local head man. In the spring all the upper Mesopotamian  towns are inundated by flocks of storks, but I have never seen them in  greater force than in Taza. On almost every housetop were a couple,  throwing their heads back and clattering their beaks in the odd way that  gives them their onomatopoetic Arabic name of Lak-Lak. It sounded like the  rattle of machine-guns; so much so that on entering the village, for the  first second I thought that the Turks were opening up on us. No native  will molest a stork; to do so is considered to the last degree  inauspicious.    There was but little water in the river running by Taza, and we managed to  get the cars through under their own power. A few miles farther on lay a  broad watercourse, dry in the main, but with the centre channel too deep  to negotiate, so there was nothing to be done without the help of the  artillery horses. The Turks were shelling the vicinity of the crossing, so  we drew back a short distance and sent word that we were held up waiting  for assistance to get us over.    Once we had reached the far side we set out to pick our way round Kirkuk  to get astride the road leading thence to Altun Kupri. This is the main  route from Baghdad to Mosul, the chief city on the upper Tigris, across  the river from the ruins of Nineveh. It was a difficult task finding a way  practicable for the cars, as the ground was still soft from the recent  rains. It was impossible to keep defiladed from Turkish observation, but  we did not supply them with much in the way of a target. At length we got  round to the road, and started to advance down it to Kirkuk. The town, in  common with so many others in that part of the country, is built on a  hill. The Hamawand Kurds are inveterate raiders, and good fortifications  are needed to withstand them. As we came out upon the road we caught sight  of our cavalry preparing to attack. The Turks were putting up a stout  resistance, with darkness fast coming to their aid. After approaching  close to the town, we were ordered to return to a deserted village for the  night, prepared to go through in the early morning.    The co-ordinates of the village were given, and we easily found it on the  map; but it was quite another proposition to locate it physically. To add  to our difficulties, the sky clouded over and pitchy blackness settled  down. It soon started to rain, so we felt that the best we could do was  select as likely a spot as came to hand and wait for morning. I made up my  mind that the front seat of a van, uncomfortable and cramped as it was,  would prove the best bed for the night. My estimate was correct, for at  midnight the light drizzle, that was scarcely more than a Scotch mist,  turned into a wild, torrential downpour that all but washed away my  companions. The waterproof flap that I had rigged withstood the onslaughts  of wind and rain in a fashion that was as gratifying as it was unexpected.  The vivid flashes of lightning showed the little dry ravine beside us  converted into a roaring, swirling torrent. The water was rushing past  beneath the cars, half-way up to their hubs. A large field hospital had  been set up close to the banks of the stream at Taza. We afterward heard  that the river had risen so rapidly that many of the tents and a few  ambulances were washed away.    By morning it had settled down into a steady, businesslike downpour. We  found that we were inextricably caught in among some low"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13670"],[0,"The Happy Family (#19)"],[1,"and wondered if  he would stand among them on the morrow and make remarks. He was not  worrying about it, though. He said hello to Weary, Pink and Cal  Emmett, and saddled a kicking, striking brute from up Sweetgrass way.    On this day the horses were wickeder, and one man came near getting  his neck broken. As it was, his collar-bone snapped and he was carried  off the infield on a stretcher and hurried to the hospital; which did  not tend to make the other riders feel more cheerful. Andy noted that  it was the HS sorrel which did the mischief, and glanced meaningly  across at Billy Roberts.    Then it was his turn with the striking, kicking gray, and he mounted  and prepared for what might come. The gray was an artist in his line,  and pitched \"high, wide and crooked\" in the most approved fashion. But  Andy, being also an artist of a sort, rode easily and with a grace  that brought much hand-clapping from the crowd. Only the initiated  reserved their praise till further trial; for though the gray was not  to say gentle, and though it took skill to ride him, there were a  dozen, probably twice as many, men in the crowd who could have done as  well.    The Happy Family, drawn together from habit and because they could  speak their minds more freely, discussed Andy gravely among  themselves. Betting was growing brisk, and if their faith had not been  so shaken they could have got long odds on Andy.    \"I betche he don't win out,\" Happy Jack insisted with characteristic  gloom. \"Yuh wait till he goes up agin that blue roan. They're savin'  that roan till the las' day--and I betche Andy'll git him. If he hangs  on till the las' day.\" Happy Jack laughed ironically as he made the  provision.    \"Any you fellows got money yuh want to put up on this deal?\" came the  voice of Andy behind them.    They turned, a bit shamefaced, toward him.    \"Aw, I betche--\" began Happy.    \"That's what I'm here for,\" cut in Andy. \"What I've got goes  up--saddle, spurs--_all_ I've got. You've done a lot uh mourning, now  here's a chance to break even on _me_. Speak up.\"    The Happy Family hesitated.    \"I guess I'll stay out,\" dimpled Pink. \"I don't just savvy your play,  Andy, and if I lose on yuh--why, it won't be the first time I ever  went broke.\"    \"Well, by golly, _I'll_ take a chance,\" bellowed Slim, whose voice was  ever pitched to carry long distances in a high wind. \"I'll bet yuh  fifty dollars yuh don't pull down that belt or purse. By golly,  there's two or three men here that can _ride_.\"    \"There's only one that'll be the real star,\" smiled Andy with  unashamed egotism. \"Happy, how rich do _you_ want to get off me?\"    Happy said a good deal and \"betche\" several things would  happen--things utterly inconsistent with one another. In the end, Andy  pinned him down to twenty dollars against Andy's silver-mounted  spurs--which was almost a third more than the spurs were worth; but  Andy had no sympathy for Happy Jack and stuck to the price doggedly  until Happy gave in.    Jack Bates advertised his lack of faith in Andy ten dollars worth, and  Cal Emmett did the same. Irish, coming in on the afternoon train and  drifting instinctively to the vicinity of the Happy Family, cursed  them all impartially for a bunch of quitters, slapped Andy on the back  and with characteristic impetuosity offered a hundred dollars to  anybody who dared take him up, that Andy would win. And this after he  had heard the tale of the blue roan and before they told him about the  two rides already made in the contest.    It is true that Happy Jack endeavored to expostulate, but Irish glared  at him in a way to make Happy squirm and stammer incoherently.    \"I've heard all about it,\" Irish cut in, \"and I don't have to hear any  more. I know a rider when I see one, and my money's on Andy from start  to finish. You make me sick. Weary, have _you_ gone against our man?\"  The tone was a challenge in itself.    Weary grinned goodnaturedly. \"I haven't pulled down any bets,\" he  answered mildly, \"and I haven't put up my last cent and don't intend  to. I'm an engaged young man.\" He shrugged his shoulders to point the  moral. \"I sure do hope Andy'll win out,\" he added simply.    \"_Hope_? Why, damn it, yuh _know_ he'll win!\" stormed Irish.    Men in their vicinity caught the belligerence of the tone and turned  about, thinking there was trouble, and the Happy Family subsided into  quieter discussion. In the end Irish, discovering that Andy had for  the time being forsworn the shelter of the Flying U tents, stuck by  him loyally and forswore it also, and went with Andy to share the  doubtful comfort of the obscure lodging house. For Irish was all or  nothing, and to find the Happy Family publicly opposed--or at most  neutral--to a Flying U man in a rough-riding contest like this,  incensed him much.    The Happy Family began to feel less sure of themselves and a bit  ashamed--though of just what, they were not quite clear, for surely  they had reason a-plenty for doubting Andy Green.    The last day found the Happy Family divided against itself and growing  a bit venomous in its remarks. Andy had not as yet done anything  remarkable, except perhaps keep in the running when the twenty had  been culled to three: Billy Roberts, Andy and a man from the  Yellowstone Valley, called Gopher by his acquaintances. Accident and  untoward circumstances had thrown out the others--good riders all of  them, or they would not have been there. Happy Jack proclaimed loudly  in camp that Andy was still in because Andy had not had a real bad  horse. \"I seen Coleman looking over the blue roan and talkin' to them  guys that runs things; they're goin' t' put Andy on him t-day, I  betche--and we seen how he can _ride_ him! Piled in a heap--\"    \"Not exactly,\" Pink interrupted. \"I seem to remember Andy lighting on  his feet; and he was smoking when he started, and smoking when he  quit. It didn't strike me at the time, but that's kinda funny, don't  yuh think?\"    So Pink went back to his first faith, and the Happy Family straightway  became loud and excited over the question of whether Andy did really  light upon his feet, or jumped up immediately, and whether he kept his  cigarette or made a new one. The discussion carried them to the fair  grounds and remained just where it started, so far as any amicable  decision was concerned.    Now this is a fair and true report of that last day's riding: There  being but the three riders, and the excitement growing apace, the  rough-riding was put first on the program and men struggled for the  best places and the best view of the infield.    In the beginning, Andy drew the HS sorrel and Billy Roberts the blue  roan. Gopher, the Yellowstone man, got a sulky little buckskin that  refused to add one whit to the excitement, so that he was put back and  another one brought. This other proved to be the wicked-eyed brown  which Andy had ridden the first day. Only this day the brown was in  different mood and pitched so viciously that Gopher lost control in  the rapid-fire changes, and rode wild, being all over the horse and  everywhere but on the ground. He did not pull leather, however though  he was accused by some of riding on his spurs at the last. At any  rate, Andy and Billy Roberts felt that the belt lay between  themselves, and admitted as much privately.    \"You've sure got to ride like a wild man if yuh beat me to it,\"  grinned Billy.    \"By gracious, I'm after it like a wolf myself,\" Andy retorted. \"Yuh  know how I'm fixed--I've just got to have it, Bill.\"    Billy, going out to ride, made no reply except a meaning head-shake.  And Billy certainly rode, that day; for the blue roan did his worst  and his best. To describe the performance, however, would be to invent  many words to supply a dearth in the language. Billy rode the blue  roan back to the corral, and he had broken none of the stringent rules  of the contest--which is saying much for Billy.    When Andy went out--shot out, one might say--on the sorrel, the Happy  Family considered him already beaten because of the remarkable riding  of Billy. When the sorrel began pitching the gaping populace, grown  wise overnight in these things, said that he was _e-a-s-y_--which he  was not. He fought as some men fight; with brain as well as muscle,  cunningly, malignantly. He would stop and stand perfectly still for a  few seconds, and then spring viciously whichever way would seem to him  most unexpected; for he was not bucking from fright as most horses do  but because he hated men and would do them injury if he could.    When the crowd thought him worn out, so that he stood with head  drooping all that Andy would permit, then it was that Andy grew most  wary. It was as he had said. Of a sudden, straight into the air leaped  the sorrel, reared and went backward in a flash of red. But as he  went, his rider slipped to one side, and when he struck the ground  Andy struck also--on his feet. \"Get up, darn yuh,\" he muttered, and  when the sorrel gathered himself together and jumped up, he was much  surprised to find Andy in the saddle again.    Then it was that the HS sorrel went mad and pitched as he had never,  even when building his record, pitched before. Then it was that Andy,  his own temper a bit roughened by the murderous brute, rode as he had  not ridden for many a day; down in the saddle, his quirt keeping time  with the jumps. He was just settling himself to \"drag it out of him  proper,\" when one of the judges, on horseback in the field, threw up  his hand.    \"Get off!\" he shouted, galloping closer. \"That horse's got to be rode  again to-day. You've done enough this time.\"    So Andy, watching his chance, jumped off when the sorrel stopped for a  few seconds of breath, and left him unconquered and more murderous  than ever. A man with a megaphone was announcing that the contest was  yet undecided, and that Green and Roberts would ride again later in  the afternoon.    Andy"]]]
