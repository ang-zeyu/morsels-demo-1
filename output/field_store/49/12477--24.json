She argues that among the mass of      the population to-day, while in the home-life there is every      opportunity for coarse familiarity with sexual matters, there is      no opportunity for a pure and enlightened introduction to them,      parents being for the most part both morally and intellectually      incapable of aiding their children here. That the school should      assume the leading part in this task is, she believes, in      accordance with the whole tendency of modern civilized life. She      would have the instruction graduated in such a manner that during      the fifth or sixth year of school life the pupil would receive      instruction, with the aid of diagrams, concerning the sexual      organs and functions of the higher mammals, the bull and cow      being selected by preference. The facts of gestation would of      course be included. When this stage was reached it would be easy      to pass on to the human species with the statement: \"Just in the      same way as the calf develops in the cow so the child develops in      the mother's body.\"        It is difficult not to recognize the force of Maria Lischnewska's      argument, and it seems highly probable that, as she asserts, the      instruction proposed lies in the course of our present path of      progress. Such instruction would be formal, unemotional, and      impersonal; it would be given not as specific instruction in      matters of sex, but simply as a part of natural history. It would      supplement, so far as mere knowledge is concerned, the      information the child had already received from its mother. But      it would by no means supplant or replace the personal and      intimate relationship of confidence between mother and child.      That is always to be aimed at, and though it may not be possible      among the ill-educated masses of to-day, nothing else will      adequately take its place.    There can be no doubt, however, that while in the future the school will  most probably be regarded as the proper place in which to teach the  elements of physiology--and not as at present a merely emasculated and  effeminated physiology--the introduction of such reformed teaching is as  yet impracticable in many communities. A coarse and ill-bred community  moves in a vicious circle. Its members are brought up to believe that sex  matters are filthy, and when they become adults they protest violently  against their children being taught this filthy knowledge. The teacher's  task is thus rendered at the best difficult, and under democratic  conditions impossible. We cannot, therefore, hope for any immediate  introduction of sexual physiology into schools, even in the unobtrusive  form in which alone it could properly be introduced, that is to say as a  natural and inevitable part of general physiology.    This objection to animal physiology by no means applies, however, to  botany. There can be little doubt that botany is of all the natural  sciences that which best admits of this incidental instruction in the  fundamental facts of sex, when we are concerned with children below the  age of puberty. There are at least two reasons why this should be so. In  the first place botany really presents the beginnings of sex, in their  most naked and essential forms; it makes clear the nature, origin, and  significance of sex. In the second place, in dealing with plants the facts  of sex can be stated to children of either sex or any age quite plainly  and nakedly without any reserve, for no one nowadays regards the botanical  facts of sex as in any way offensive. The expounder of sex in plants also  has on his side the advantage of being able to assert, without question,  the entire beauty of the sexual process. He is not confronted by the  ignorance, bad education, and false associations which have made it so  difficult either to see or to show the beauty of sex in animals. From the  sex-life of plants to the sex-life of the lower animals there is, however,  but a step which the teacher, according to his discretion, may take.        An early educational authority, Salzmann, in 1785 advocated the      sexual enlightenment of children by first teaching them botany,      to be followed by zooelogy. In modern times the method of      imparting sex knowledge to children by means, in the first place,      of botany, has been generally advocated, and from the most      various quarters. Thus Marro (_La Puberta_, p. 300) recommends      this plan. J. Hudrey-Menos (\"La Question du Sexe dans      l'Education,\" _Revue Socialiste_, June, 1895), gives the same      advice. Rudolf Sommer, in a paper entitled \"Maedchenerziehung oder      Menschenbildung?\" (_Geschlecht und Gesellschaft_, Jahrgang I,      Heft 3) recommends that the first introduction of sex knowledge      to children should be made by talking to them on simple natural      history subjects; \"there are endless opportunities,\" he remarks,      \"over a fairy-tale, or a walk, or a fruit, or an egg, the sowing      of seed or the nest-building of birds.\" Canon Lyttelton      (_Training of the Young in Laws of Sex_, pp. 74 et seq.) advises      a somewhat similar method, though laying chief stress on personal      confidence between the child and his mother; \"reference is made      to the animal world just so far as the child's knowledge extends,      so as to prevent the new facts from being viewed in isolation,      but the main emphasis is laid on his feeling for his mother and      the instinct which exists in nearly all children of reverence due      to the maternal relation;\" he adds that, however difficult the      subject may seem, the essential facts of paternity must also be      explained to boys and girls alike. Keyes, again (_New York      Medical Journal_, Feb. 10, 1906), advocates teaching children      from an early age the sexual facts of plant life and also      concerning insects and other lower animals, and so gradually      leading up to human beings, the matter being thus robbed of its      unwholesome mystery. Mrs. Ennis Richmond (_Boyhood_, p. 62)      recommends that children should be sent to spend some of their      time upon a farm, so that they may not only become acquainted      with the general facts of the natural world, but also with the      sexual lives of animals, learning things which it is difficult to      teach verbally. Karina Karin (\"Wie erzieht man ein Kind zuer      wissenden Keuschheit?\" _Geschlecht und Gesellschaft_, Jahrgang I,      Heft 4), reproducing some of her talks with her nine-year old      son, from the time that he first asked her where children came      from, shows how she began with telling him about flowers, to pass      on to fish and birds, and finally to the facts of human      pregnancy, showing him pictures from an obstetrical manual of the      child in its mother's body. It may be added that the advisability      of beginning the sex teaching of children with the facts of      botany was repeatedly emphasized by various speakers at the      special meeting of the German Congress for Combating Venereal      Disease devoted to the subject of sexual instruction      (_Sexualpaedagogik_, especially pp. 36, 47, 76).    The transition from botany to the elementary zooelogy of the lower animals,  to human anatomy and physiology, and to the science of anthropology based  on these, is simple and natural. It is not likely to be taken in detail  until the age of puberty. Sex enters into all these subjects and should  not be artificially excluded from them in the education of either boys or  girls. The text-books from which the sexual system is entirely omitted  ought no longer to be tolerated. The nature and secretion of the  testicles, the meaning of the ovaries and of menstruation, as well as the  significance of metabolism and the urinary excretion, should be clear in  their main lines to all boys and girls who have reached the age of  puberty.    At puberty there arises a new and powerful reason why boys and girls  should receive definite instruction in matters of sex. Before that age it  is possible for the foolish parent to imagine that a child may be  preserved in ignorant innocence.[25] At puberty that belief is obviously  no longer possible. The efflorescence of puberty with the development of  the sexual organs, the appearance of hair in unfamiliar places, the  general related organic changes, the spontaneous and perhaps alarming  occurrence in boys of seminal emissions, and in girls of menstruation, the  unaccustomed and sometimes acute recognition of sexual desire accompanied  by new sensations in the sexual organs and leading perhaps to  masturbation; all these arouse, as we cannot fail to realize, a new  anxiety in the boy's or girl's mind, and a new curiosity, all the more  acute in many cases because it is carefully concealed as too private, and  even too shameful, to speak of to anyone. In boys, especially if of  sensitive temperament, the suffering thus caused may be keen and  prolonged.        A doctor of philosophy, prominent in his profession, wrote to      Stanley Hall (_Adolescence_, vol. i, p. 452): \"My entire youth,      from six to eighteen, was made miserable from lack of knowledge      that any one who knew anything of the nature of puberty might      have given; this long sense of defect, dread of operation, shame      and worry, has left an indelible mark.\" There are certainly many      men who could say the same. Lancaster (\"Psychology and Pedagogy      of Adolescence,\" _Pedagogical Seminary_, July, 1897, pp. 123-5)      speaks strongly regarding the evils of ignorance of sexual      hygiene, and the terrible fact that millions of youths are always      in the hands of quacks who dupe them into the belief that they      are on the road to an awful destiny merely because they have      occasional emissions during sleep. \"This is "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13618"],[0,"The Cathedral Church of Peterborough (#19)"],[1,"on the Cross; but the details are not identical.    [Illustration: Church of S. John the Baptist and Guildhall.]    =The Guild Hall=, in the Market Place, is an effective little building,  dated 1671. The lower part is open, and is used for the butter market.  While sufficient for the transaction of borough business 100 years ago,  it is altogether inadequate now to the requirements of a corporation.    Until a very few years ago there was a mediaeval building at  Peterborough of the greatest interest. This was the old =Tithe Barn= of  the Abbey, situated in the Manor of Boroughbury, on the Lincoln Road. It  was much the finest in the kingdom. Unhappily the \"enterprising builder\"  has obtained possession of it, and it has been pulled down, the  materials, all Barnack stone, having been employed in building houses.  It was of good thirteenth century work, and in perfect condition. On the  east side were two large porches, by which a waggon fully laden could  enter the barn. The roof was supported by very massive timbers rising  from the ground, the whole arrangement resembling a wooden church with  aisles.    =The Museum= in Queen Street is noted for its collection of Roman and  Saxon antiquities from the city and district; amongst the former are the  noted coffin tile stamped LEG IX. HISP.; the vase showing a coursing  match with the hare and hounds in relief, coins, pottery, brooches, and  other jewellery. The Saxon specimens consist of pottery, jewellery, and  weapons chiefly exhumed at Woodston, about one mile south-west of the  river bridge.    The interesting collection of bone, wood, horn, and straw marquetry work  made at Norman Cross (5 miles) by the French prisoners during the years  1797 to 1814, is unique. MSS. of the Northamptonshire poet, John Clare,  are preserved in this institution, together with a large number of other  local works.          CHAPTER V.    HISTORY OF THE MONASTERY.      The inhabitants of the Fen country, when first distinguished by a  special name, were known as the Gyrvii. Their district included the  south part of Lincolnshire, the north part of Northamptonshire, and the  greater part of Cambridgeshire. The southern Gyrvii were a province of  East Anglia; the Gyrvii of the north appear to have been allied to the  East Anglians, and perhaps inclined to become united with them; but they  were ultimately absorbed in the great Midland Kingdom of Mercia. Bishop  Stubbs,[29] speaking of the early Fasti of Peterborough, says: \"Mercia,  late in its formation as a kingdom, sprang at once into a great state  under Penda; late in its adoption of Christianity, it seems from the  period of its conversion to have taken a prominent place at once among  the Christian powers. The Chronicle places the conversion in 655, and a  very few years saw it the best governed and best organised province of  the Church. In less than thirty years it was divided into five dioceses,  amongst which the place of the Fen country is more clearly definable.  The bishopric of Lindsey occupied the north of Lincolnshire, reaching to  the Witham: a line drawn from the south point of Nottinghamshire to the  Cam would probably represent the western border of the Gyrvii; the  border of Cambridgeshire was the boundary of the dioceses of Elmham and  Dunwich. The Fen country thus falls into the eastern portion of the  great Lichfield diocese, which for a few years after 680 had its own  bishop at Leicester, but was not finally separated from the mother see  until 737.\"    The date given above for the conversion of Mercia, 655, is the date of  the laying of the foundation of the monastery of Medeshamstede. Penda  had been succeeded on the throne of Mercia by his eldest son, Peada; and  he, in conjunction with Oswy, brother of King Oswald, determined to  \"rear a minster to the glory of Christ and honour of Saint Peter.\"    =Saxulf= (656-675), was the first Abbot. In Bede no mention is made of  royal patronage, and the whole credit of founding the abbey is given to  Saxulf. Another account represents him as having been a thane of great  wealth and renown, and that this abbey was dedicated by him \"as the  first fruits of the Mercian church.\" He was made Bishop of Lichfield in  675, but continued to take an active part in the affairs of the abbey.  He died in 691.    =Cuthbald= (675), is named in the Chronicle as having been second Abbot.  One of this name, possibly the same, was ruling the monastery at Oundle  in 709, when S. Wilfrid died there. Nothing further is known of him; and  nothing at all of =Egbald=, who appears in the usual lists as his  successor.    The chroniclers give for the fourth Abbot one Pusa. But Bishop Stubbs  has proved that =Bothwin= was Abbot from 758 to 789; and concludes that  the introduction of Pusa into the list is a mistake, if not a mere  invention.    Abbot =Beonna= came next, probably in 789 or very soon afterwards.  \"Possibly this Beonna is the same who was made Bishop of Hereford in  823, and died in 830.\"    =Ceolred= succeeded, and in the year 852 signs a grant of land as Abbot.  Patrick conjectures that he became a bishop, but does not name his  diocese. There is no certainty about the dates at which these early  abbots entered upon their office; and possibly some names have been  altogether lost. But all accounts agree that the last Abbot of  Medeshamstede was =Hedda=; and that he perished when the monastery was  destroyed and its inmates killed by the Danes in 870. A graphic account  of the circumstances attending this attack is given by Ingulf; but as  authentic historians like Orderic and Malmesbury have no reference  whatever to the occurrences described by Ingulf, Bishop Stubbs  unwillingly is obliged to consider his version to be a pure romance. But  of the fact itself, the utter destruction of the monastery, there is no  question; nor of the fact that all the inmates, or nearly all, perished.  We read that at Crowland some monks escaped the general slaughter, and  met again, after the departure of the Danes, and elected a fresh abbot.  They then came to Medeshamstede, and buried the bodies of those that had  been murdered, in one vast tomb. It has been commonly supposed that the  Monks' Stone, before described, was the stone erected at the time in  commemoration of the disaster. The arguments against this supposition  have been already given.    The Fen monasteries remained desolate for 100 years. During that period  the lands were constantly being seized by different intruders. It was  not till the time of Alfred the Great, who came to the throne in 871,  that the invasions of the Danes were finally checked, and tranquillity  restored to the kingdom. Security being assured, the people began again  to improve their public buildings and the religious houses. Crowland was  the first in the neighbourhood to be restored. This restoration was  effected by Thurketyl. Instigated probably by his example, Ethelwold,  Bishop of Winchester, encouraged and supported by King Edgar, rebuilt  the monastery of Medeshamstede after the old model. The rebuilding was  completed in 972; and the name of Burgh was given to the place, and the  old name went altogether out of use.    The first Abbot, after the re-establishment of the monastery, was  =Aldulf= (971-992), formerly Chancellor to the King. He is said to have  accidentally caused the death of his only son, and feeling that he could  no longer live happily in the midst of earthly vanities, he endowed this  monastery with all his possessions, and was appointed to govern it.  Gunton declares that the prosperous and wealthy condition of the abbey  under the rule of Aldulf caused its name to be improved into  Gildenburgh, the Golden Borough. At this time most of the neighbouring  woods were cut down and the land brought into cultivation. Aldulf became  Bishop of Worcester after remaining twenty years at Burgh; and in 995  was made Archbishop of York. He died in May 1002, and is buried at  Worcester. He held indeed the See of Worcester with that of York till  his death.    He was succeeded at Burgh by =Kenulf= (992-1005). He is described as  famous for his wisdom and learning, and as having governed his abbey  \"most admirably and sweetly.\" In 1005 he was made Bishop of Winchester,  not without suspicion of a corrupt purchase (_episcopatum nummis  nundinatus fuerat_), and died the following year.    The next Abbot, =Elsinus= (1006-1055), was remarkable chiefly for the  number of relics he collected, designing thereby to increase the fame  and wealth of the monastery. Dean Patrick thinks that before Elsinus  there was an abbot named KINSINUS, whose name he found in one record;  but he adds that if he were really abbot it could at most have been for  a few days or months. The list of relics gathered together by Elsinus is  extensive. At least eighty are enumerated. It speaks volumes for the  credulity of the age when we find in this list such things as the  following:--A portion of Aaron's rod that budded; a portion of one of  the five loaves that fed the five thousand; a shoulder-blade of one of  the Holy Innocents; two pieces of the Virgin Mary's veil; part of the  stone paten of the Evangelist S. John. The great relic of the house was  the arm of S. Oswald. The date when this was acquired is not certainly  known, some thinking that this period is too early a date to assign to  its acquisition. Bede relates[30] \"that this Oswald, King of  Northumberland, was very free and liberal in giving of alms to the poor;  and one day whilst he sate at meat, one of his servants told him of a  great number of poor people come to his gate for relief; whereupon King  Oswald sent them meat from his own table, and there not being enough to  serve them all, he caused one of his silver dishes to be cut in pieces,  and to be distributed amongst the rest; which Aydanus, a Bishop (who  came out of Scotland to convert, and instruct those Northern parts of  England), "]]]
