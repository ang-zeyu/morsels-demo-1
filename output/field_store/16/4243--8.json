CHAPTER VI    JELLIES, JAMS, PRESERVES, MARMALADES, FRUIT JUICES AND SIRUPS      For jelly making select firm, slightly underripe fruit that is fairly  acid and contains a large amount of pectin. Fruit that is just a  little underripe contains more pectin than the mature or overripe  fruits. Pectin is the substance that makes jelly harden. This  fundamental jelly-making quality does not exist in all fruits. Such  fruits as currants, crab apples and grapes contain much pectin and  are, therefore, considered excellent jelly-making fruits.    The white inner skin of grapefruit is also a prolific source of  pectin, but as it has a bitter taste we seldom use it for jellies,  though we find it valuable in making orange, grapefruit and other  marmalades.    Rhubarb, strawberries and cherries all lack pectin, but can be made  into good jellies if we add the white skins of oranges and lemons to  them while cooking.    So the very first thing we must know about jelly making is whether or  not a fruit contains pectin. There will be no tears shed over jelly  that will not \"jell\" if all young housewives will learn the simple  test for pectin; to find out whether a juice contains pectin or not is  a very easy matter.    Take one tablespoonful of grain alcohol--90 to 95 per cent.--and add  to it one tablespoonful of _cooked_ juice that has been cooled. The  effect of the alcohol is to bring together the pectin in a jelly-like  mass. If a large quantity of pectin is present it will appear in one  mass or clot which may be gathered up on a spoon. You will notice I  said _cooked_ juice. It is peculiar that this pectin frequently is not  found in the juices of raw fruits, though it is very plentiful in the  cooked juices. Therefore the test must be made with cooked juice.    There is little pectin in the juice of raw apples, raw quince, raw  grapes, and yet the cooked juices are full of pectin.    This test not only indicates the amount of pectin present, but it also  gives some idea of the proper proportions of sugar to juice. If  three-fourths or more of the juice forms a gelatinous mass or clot  this indicates that you should use three-fourths as much sugar as  juice. If the pectin is slightly gelatinous or is less than  three-fourths of the whole volume of juice, use less sugar. If the  pectin is less than one-half add some form of pectin to make the  jelly, or can the juice for use as a beverage, for flavoring ice cream  or some form of cooking.    By employing this test, sugar can often be reduced, and thus the jelly  texture will be fine, less rubbery and the flavor will be better.    After the fruit has been selected and prepared as usual by washing,  stemming, and so forth, it is ready to be heated in an acid-proof  kettle. With juicy fruits use just enough water to prevent  burning--about one cup of water to every four or five quarts of fruit.  The juicy fruits are currants, raspberries, and so forth. With less  juicy fruits, as apples or quinces, use enough water to cover, or  follow the rule, half as much water as fruit. Use the cores, skins and  seeds; these improve the flavor and color of the jelly.    Berries can be mashed. Heat the fruit slowly in a covered kettle,  stirring once in a while to obtain an even cooking. When the simmering  point is reached, crush the fruit with a well-soaked wooden masher.  When the fruit is tender or has a transparent appearance, it is ready  to strain.    The jelly bag must be of closely woven material; one with a large  mouth is advisable. If cheesecloth is used double it and tie opposite  corners together. When a very clear jelly is desired use a flannel or  felt bag for straining the juice.    What drips into the dish or pan is called Extraction One. When this  Extraction One is fairly drained out, which takes about thirty  minutes, do not squeeze the pulp for a second grade jelly as so many  housewives do; instead, make another juice extraction. To do this,  empty the contents or pulp in the bag into the preserving kettle,  cover with water, and stir until thoroughly mixed; then cover, bring  slowly to a boil as before and drain again. The juice that drips out  is called Extraction Two.    The pectin-alcohol test can be used here again to find out whether  there is much or little or no pectin left. If much pectin is present,  you can repeat the operation and get Extraction Three.    Three extractions usually exhaust the pectin, but sometimes you can  get as many as five extractions.    You may say, \"Why bother with extractions--why not squeeze the juice  and be done with it?\" You will get clearer, better-flavored and more  glasses of jelly if you will make the extractions than if you squeeze  the jelly bag.    I always make the jelly from Extraction One by itself, but usually  combine Extraction Two and Three.    The next step in jelly making is vitally important--that is, how much  sugar to use to a given amount of fruit juice. This is where many  housewives \"fall down\" on jelly making. They use the same proportion  of sugar to all juices.    To make jelly that does not crystallize the right proportion of sugar  must be added to the juice. To make jelly that is not tough or  unpleasantly sour, the right proportion of sugar and juice must be  used.    Currants and unripe or partly ripened grapes are so rich in pectin  that they require equal amounts of sugar and juice--that is, to every  cup of extracted currant and grape juice we add"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13789"],[0,"Great Britain and the American Civil War (#12)"],[1," war, and no clear  formulation of British policy[72].    In fact up to the middle of March, 1861, both public and official  British opinion discounted armed conflict, or at least any determined  Northern effort to recover the South. Early British attitude was,  therefore, based on a misconception. As this became clear, public  opinion began to break from a united humanitarian pro-Northern sentiment  and to show, in some quarters, quite another face. Even as early as  January the _Economist_ expressed wonder that the Northern States had  not availed themselves gladly of the chance to \"shake off such an  incubus, and to purify themselves of such a stain[73].\" and a month  later professed to believe that Great Britain would willingly permit the  North to secure compensation for loss of territory by annexing  Canada--provided the Canadians themselves desired it. This, it was  argued, would directly benefit England herself by cutting down military  expenditures[74]. The _London Press_ indulged in similar speculation,  though from the angle of a Canadian annexation of the Northern States,  whose more sober citizens must by now be weary of the sham of American  democracy, and disgusted with the rowdyism of political elections, which  \"combine the morals of a horse race, the manners of a dog fight, the  passions of a tap-room, and the emotions of a gambling house[75].\"  Probably such suggestions had little real purpose or meaning at the  moment, but it is interesting that this idea of a \"compensation\" in  Canada should have been voiced thus early. Even in the United States the  same thought had occurred to a few political leaders. Charles Sumner  held it, though too wise, politically, to advance it in the face of the  growing Northern determination to preserve the Union. It lay at the  bottom of his increasing bitterness toward his old friend Charles  Francis Adams, now busy in schemes intended, apparently, to restore the  Union by compromise, and it led Sumner to hope for appointment as  Minister to England[76].    The chief organ of British upper-class opinion, the _Times_, was one of  the first to begin the process of \"face about,\" as civil war in America  seemed imminent[77]. Viewed from the later attitude of the _Times_, the  earlier expressions of that paper, and in truth of many British  journals, seem merely the customary platitudinous British holding up of  horrified hands at American slavery. On January 19, 1861, a strong  editorial still proclaimed the folly of South Carolina, as acting  \"without law, without justice,\" but displayed a real dismay at the  possible consequences of war to British trade and commerce. On January  22, the _Times_ reprinted an article from the _Economist_, on a probable  cessation of cotton supply and editorially professed great alarm, even  advocating an early recognition of the Southern confederacy if needed to  maintain that supply. From this time on there is no further note in the  _Times_ of the righteousness of the Northern cause; but while it is  still asserted that war would be folly, the strength of the South, its  superiority as a military nation, are depicted.    A long break of nearly six weeks follows with little editorial comment.  Soon the correspondence from New York, previously written by Bancroft  Davis, and extremely favourable to the Northern cause, was discontinued.  W.H. Russell, the famous war correspondent of the Crimea, was summoned  to London and, according to his own story, upon being given papers,  clippings, and correspondence (largely articles from the _New York  Herald_) supporting the right of the South to secede, hastily took his  departure for America to report upon the situation[78]. He sailed from  Queenstown on March 3, and arrived in New York on March 16. At last on  March 12, the _Times_ took positive ground in favour of the justice of  the Southern cause.         \"No treachery has been at work to produce the disruption, and       the principles avowed are such as to command the sympathies       of every free and enlightened people. Such are the widely       different auspices under which the two rival Republics start       into existence. But mankind will not ultimately judge these       things by sympathies and antipathies; they will be greatly       swayed by their own interest, and the two Republics must be       weighed, not by their professions or their previous history,       but by the conduct they pursue and the position they maintain       among the Powers of the earth. Their internal institutions       are their own affair; their financial and political       arrangements are emphatically ours. Brazil is a slave-holding       Empire, but by its good faith and good conduct it has       contrived to establish for itself a place in the hierarchy of       nations far superior to that of many Powers which are free       from this domestic contamination. If the Northern Confederacy       of America evinces a determination to act in a narrow,       exclusive, and unsocial spirit, while its Southern       competitor extends the hand of good fellowship to all       mankind, with the exception of its own bondsmen, we must not       be surprised to see the North, in spite of the goodness of       its cause and the great negative merit of the absence of       Slavery, sink into a secondary position, and lose the       sympathy and regard of mankind.\"    This to Northern view, was a sad relapse from that high moral tone  earlier addressed to the South notifying slave-holders that England  would not \"stultify the policy of half a century for the sake of an  extended cotton trade[79].\"    The _Economist_, with more consistency, still reported the violence and  recklessness of the South, yet in logical argument proved to its own  satisfaction the impossibility of Northern reconquest, and urged a  peaceful separation[80]. The _Spectator_, even though pro-Northern, had  at first small hope of reunion by force, and offered consolation in the  thought that there would still remain a United States of America  \"strong, powerful and free; all the stronger for the loss of the Black  South[81].\" In short from all quarters the public press, whatever its  sympathy, united in decrying war as a useless effort doomed to failure  if undertaken in the hope of restoring the Union. Such public opinion,  however, was not necessarily governmental opinion. The latter was indeed  more slow to make up its mind and more considerate in expressing itself.  When it became clear that in all probability the North would fight,  there was still no conception, any more than in the United States  itself, of the duration and intensity of the conflict. Indeed, Russell  yet hoped, as late as the end of January, that no protracted war would  occur. Nevertheless he was compelled to face the situation in its  relation to British commerce.    On February 16, Russell addressed Lyons on that aspect of possible war  which would at once call for a determination of British policy. \"Above  all things,\" he wrote, \"endeavour to prevent a blockade of the Southern  coast. It would produce misery, discord, and enmity incalculable[82].\"  Within a week Forster, a thorough friend of the North throughout the  whole war, was interrogating the Ministry in the House of Commons in  regard to the situation at Charleston, and expressing the hope that  England would not in any way attempt to interfere[83]. This was the  first reference in Parliament, its sittings but just renewed after the  long vacation, to the American conflict, but British commercial  interests were being forced to a keener attention, and already men in  many circles were asking themselves what should be the proper  governmental attitude; how soon this new Southern Confederacy could  justly claim European recognition; how far and how fast European  governments ought to go in acknowledging such a claim; what ought to be  the proper policy and position of a neutral power; whether, indeed, a  declaration of neutrality ought to be issued.    With these questions rapidly coming to the front, it became important  for British statesmen to know something about the leaders in this new  Southern movement, the attitude of the people in general, and the  purposes of the new Government. Here, unfortunately, Lord Lyons could  be no guide. The consuls in the South, however, were in a position to  give their impressions. On February 28, 1861, Bunch wrote to Russell,  describing the election of Davis and Stephens[84], to the Presidency and  Vice-Presidency of the Confederacy, and giving a personal  characterization of many members of the Government. He was rather  caustic. Davis, he said, was the only _able_ man, and he, unfortunately,  was a confirmed \"manifest destiny\" leader, so much so in fact that Bunch  prophesied a renewal of filibustering when once the North had acquiesced  in a Southern State and the fear of the North had passed. Bunch had no  faith in any future greatness of the South, asserting that it would be a  State despised among nations for its maintenance of slavery, and that it  could not hope for any encouragement or sympathy from the humane nations  of Europe; in fact, his entire characterization was wholly damning to  the South. Yet it is to be noted that he never for a moment questioned  that the South had already actually established its independence. This  he seems to take for granted. Thus again, and from another quarter,  there was presented the double difficulty of England in regard to the  Civil War--the difficulty of reconciling sentiments of humanity long  preached by Great Britain, with her commercial interests and her  certainty that a new State was being born.    For men in the Northern Government Lyons was in a position to report,  but up to the end of January he had not written in any great detail with  regard to the new administration and its make-up, though on January 7,  he had informed Russell that Seward would"]]]
