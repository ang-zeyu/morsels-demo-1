I was appointed and went up  there in '82 and '83 from my district. It took about eight years to  finish Branch Normal at that time. I stayed there two years. I roomed  with old man John Young.    \"You couldn't go to school without paying unless you were sent by the  Board. We lived in the country and I would go home in the winter and  study in the summer. Professor J.C. Corbin was principal of the Pine  Bluff Branch Normal at that time. Dr. A.H. Hill, Professor Booker, and  quite a number of the people we consider distinguished were in school  then. They finished, but I didn't. I had to go to my mother because she  was ill. I don't claim to have no schooling at all.      \"Forty Acres and a Mule\"    \"My mother received forty acres of land when freedom came. Her master  gave it to her. She was given forty acres of land and a colt. There is  no more to tell about that. It was just that way--a gift of forty acres  of land and a colt from her former master.    \"My mother died. There is a woman living now that lost it (the home).  Mother let Malinda live on it. Mother lived with the white folks  meanwhile. She didn't need the property for herself. She kept it for us.  She built a nice log house on it. Fifteen acres of it was under  cultivation when it was given to her. My sister lived on it for a long  time. She mortgaged it in some way I don't know how. I remember when the  white people ran me down there some years back to get me to sign a title  to it. I didn't have to sign the paper because the property had been  deeded to Susan Badgett and HEIRS; lawyers advised me not to sign it.  But I signed it for the sake of my sister.      Father and Master    \"My mother's master was named Badgett--Captain John Badgett. He was a  Methodist preacher. Some of the Badgetts still own property on Main  Street. My mother's master's father was my daddy.      Marriage    \"I was married July 12, 1889. Next year I will have been married fifty  years. My wife's name was Elizabeth Owens. She was born in Batesville,  Mississippi. I met her at Brinkley when she was visiting her aunt. We  married in Brinkley. Very few people in this city have lived together  longer than we have. July 12, 1938, will make forty-nine years. By July  1939, we will have reached our fiftieth anniversary.      Patrollers, Jayhawkers, Ku Klux, and Ku Klux Klan    \"Pateroles, Jayhawkers, and the Ku Klux came before the war. The Ku Klux  in slavery times were men who would catch Negroes out and keep them if  they did not collect from their masters. The Pateroles would catch  Negroes out and return them if they did not have a pass. They whipped  them sometimes if they did not have a pass. The Jayhawkers were highway  men or robbers who stole slaves among other things. At least, that is  the way the people regarded them. The Jayhawkers stole and pillaged,  while the Ku Klux stole those Negroes they caught out. The word 'Klan'  was never included in their name.    \"The Ku Klux Klan was an organization which arose after the Civil War.  It was composed of men who believed in white supremacy and who regulated  the morals of the neighborhood. They were not only after Jews and  Negroes, but they were sworn to protect the better class of people. They  took the law in their own hands.      Slave Work    \"I'm not so certain about the amount of work required of slaves. My  mother says she picked four hundred pounds of cotton many a day. The  slaves were tasked and given certain amounts to accomplish. I don't know  the exact amount nor just how it was determined.      Opinions    \"It is too bad that the young Negroes don't know what the old Negroes  think and what they have done. The young folks could be helped if they  would take advice.\"      Interviewer's Comment    Badgett's distinctions between jayhawkers, Ku Klux, patrollers, and Ku  Klux Klan are most interesting.    I have been slow to catch it. All my life, I have heard persons with  ex-slave background refer to the activities of the Ku Klux among slaves  prior to 1865. I always thought that they had the Klux Klan and the  patrollers confused.    Badgett's definite and clear-cut memories, however, lead me to believe  that many of the Negroes who were slaves used the word Ku Klux to denote  a type of persons who stole slaves. It was evidently in use before it  was applied to the Ku Klux Klan.    The words \"Ku Klux\" and \"Ku Klux Klan\" are used indiscriminately in  current conversation and literature. It is also true that many persons  in the present do, and in the past did, refer to the Ku Klux Klan simply  as \"Ku Klux.\"    It is a matter of record that the organization did not at first bear the  name \"Ku Klux Klan\" throughout the South. The name \"Ku Klux\" seems to  have grown in application as the organization changed from a moral  association of the best citizens of the South and gradually came under  the control of lawless persons with lawless methods--whipping and  murdering. It is antecedently reasonable that the change in names  accompanying a change in policy would be due to a fitness in the prior  use of the name.    The recent use of the name seems mostly imitation and propaganda.    Histories, encyclopedias, and dictionaries, in general, do not record a  meaning of the term Ku Klux as prior to the Reconstruction period.

[HW: A Hostler's Story]    \"I was born in Monticello. I was raised there. Then I came up to Pine  Bluff and stayed there thirty-two years. Then I came up here and been  here thirty-two years. That is the reason the white folks so good to me  now. I been here so long, I been a hostler all my life. I am the best  hostler in this State. I go down to the post office they give me money.  These white folks here is good to me.    \"What you writing down? Yes, that's what I said. These white folks like  me and they good to me. They give me anything I want. You want a drink?  That's the best bonded whiskey money can buy. They gives it to me. Well,  if you don't want it now, come in when you do.    \"I lost my wife right there in that corner. I was married just once.  Lived with her forty-three years. She died here five months ago. Josie  Bailey! The white folks thought the world and all of her. That is  another reason they give me so much. She was one of the best women I  ever seen.    \"I gits ten dollars a month. The check comes right up to the house. I  used to work with all them money men. Used to handle all them horses at  the post office. They ought to give me sixty-five dollars but they  don't. But I gits along. God is likely to lemme live ten years longer. I  worked at the post office twenty-two years and don't git but ten dollars  a month. They ought to gimme more.    \"My father's name was Jeff Wells. My mother's name was Tilda Bailey. She  was married twice. I took her master's name. Jeff Wells was my father's  name. Governor Bailey ought to give me somethin'. I got the same name he  has. I know him.    \"My father's master was Stanley--Jeff Stanley. That was in slavery time.  That was my slave time people. I was just a little bit of a boy. I am  glad you are gittin' that to help the colored people out. Are they goin'  to give the old slaves a pension? What they want to ask all these  questions for then? Well, I guess there's somethin' else besides money  that's worth while.    \"My father's master was a good man. He was good to him. Yes Baby! Jeff  Wells, that my father's name. I was a little baby settin' in the basket  'round in the yard and they would put the cotton all 'round me. They  carried me out where they worked and put me in the basket. I couldn't  pick no cotton because I was too young. When they got through they would  put me in that big old wagon and carry me home. There wasn't no trucks  then. Jeff Wells (that was my father), when they got through pickin' the  cotton, he would say, 'Put them children in the wagon; pick 'em up and  put 'em in the wagon.' I was a little bitty old boy. I couldn't pick no  cotton then. But I used to pick it after the surrender.    \"I remember what they said when they freed my father. They said, 'You're  free. You children are free. Go on back there and work and let your  children work. Don't work them children too long. You'll git pay for  your work.' That was in the Monticello courthouse yard. They said,  'You're free! Free!'    \"My mistress said to me when I got back home, 'Yo"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11277"],[0,"Egyptian Ideas of the Future Life (#12)"],[1,"who created  Osiris and his company of gods, says:--      \"I am the god Khepera, and my members shall have an everlasting    existence. I shall not decay, I shall not rot, I shall not putrefy, I    shall not turn into worms, and I shall not see corruption under the    eye of the god Shu. I shall have my being, I shall have my being; I    shall live, I shall live; I shall germinate, I shall germinate, I    shall germinate; I shall wake up in peace. I shall not putrefy; my    bowels shall not perish; I shall not suffer injury; mine eye shall not    decay; the form of my countenance shall not disappear; mine ear shall    not become deaf; my head shall not be separated from my neck; my    tongue shall not be carried away; my hair shall not be cut off; mine    eyebrows shall not be shaved off, and no baleful injury shall come    upon me. My body shall be stablished, and it shall neither fall into    ruin, nor be destroyed on this earth.\"    Judging from such passages as those given above we might think that  certain of the Egyptians expected a resurrection of the physical body,  and the mention of the various members of the body seems to make this  view certain. But the body of which the incorruption and immortality are  so strongly declared is the S[=A]HU; or spiritual body, that sprang into  existence out of the physical body, which had become transformed by  means of the prayers that had been recited and the ceremonies that had  been performed on the day of the funeral, or on that wherein it was laid  in the tomb. It is interesting to notice that no mention is made of meat  or drink in the CLIVth Chapter, and the only thing which the deceased  refers to as necessary for his existence is air, which he obtains  through, the god Temu, the god who is always depicted in human form; the  god is here mentioned in his aspect of the night Sun as opposed to R[=a]  the day Sun, and a comparison of the Sun's daily death with the death of  the deceased is intended to be made. The deposit of the head of the God-man  Osiris at Abydos has already been mentioned, and the belief that it  was preserved there was common throughout Egypt. But in the text quoted  above the deceased says, \"My head shall not be separated from my neck,\"  which seems to indicate that he wished to keep his body whole,  notwithstanding that Osiris was almighty, and could restore the limbs  and reconstitute the body, even as he had done for his own limbs and  body which had been hacked to pieces by Set. Chapter XLIII of the Book  of the Dead [Footnote: See _The Chapters of Coming Forth by Day_, p.  98.] also has an important reference to the head of Osiris. It is  entitled \"The Chapter of not letting the head of a man be cut off from  him in the underworld,\" and must be of considerable antiquity. In it the  deceased says: \"I am the Great One, the son of the Great One; I am Fire,  and the son of the Fire, to whom was given his head after it had been  cut off. The head of Osiris was not taken away from him, let not the  head of the deceased be taken away from him. I have knit myself together  (_or_ reconstituted myself); I have made myself whole and complete; I  have renewed my youth; I am Osiris, the lord of eternity.\"    From the above it would seem that, according to one version of the  Osiris story, the head of Osiris was not only cut off, but that it was  passed through the fire also; and if this version be very ancient, as it  well may be and probably is, it takes us back to prehistoric times in  Egypt when the bodies of the dead were mutilated and burned. Prof.  Wiedemann thinks [Footnote: See J. de Morgan, _Ethnographie  Prehistorique_, p. 210.] that the mutilation and breaking of the bodies  of the dead were the results of the belief that in order to make the KA,  or \"double,\" leave this earth, the body to which it belonged must be  broken, and he instances the fact that objects of every kind were broken  at the time when they were placed in the tombs. He traces also a  transient custom in the prehistoric graves of Egypt where the methods of  burying the body whole and broken into pieces seem to be mingled, for  though in some of them the body has been broken into pieces, it is  evident that successful attempts have been made to reconstitute it by  laying the pieces as far as possible in their proper places. And it may  be this custom which is referred to in various places in the Book of the  Dead, when the deceased declares that he has collected his limbs \"and  made his body whole again,\" and already in the Vth dynasty King Teta is  thus addressed--\"Rise up, O thou Teta! Thou hast received thy head, thou  hast knitted together thy bones, [Footnote: _Recueil de Travaux_, tom.  v. p. 40 (I. 287).] thou hast collected thy members.\"    The history of Osiris, the god of the resurrection, has now been traced  from the earliest times to the end of the period of the rule of the  priests of Amen (about B.C. 900), by which time Amen-R[=a] had been  thrust in among the gods of the underworld, and prayers were made, in  some cases, to him instead of to Osiris. From this time onwards Amen  maintained this exalted position, and in the Ptolemaic period, in an  address to the deceased Ker[=a]sher we read. \"Thy face shineth before  R[=a], thy soul liveth before Amen, and thy body is renewed before  Osiris.\" And again it is said, \"Amen is nigh unto thee to make thee to  live again.... Amen cometh to thee having the breath of life, and he  causeth thee to draw thy breath within thy funeral house.\" But in spite  of this, Osiris kept and held the highest place in the minds of the  Egyptians, from first to last, as the God-man, the being who was both  divine and human; and no foreign invasion, and no religious or political  disturbances, and no influence which any outside peoples could bring to  bear upon them, succeeded in making them regard the god as anything less  than the cause and symbol and type of the resurrection, and of the life  everlasting. For about five thousand years men were mummified in  imitation of the mummied form of Osiris; and they went to their graves  believing that their bodies would vanquish the powers of death, and the  grave, and decay, because Osiris had vanquished them; and they had  certain hope of the resurrection in an immortal, eternal, and spiritual  body, because Osiris had risen in a transformed spiritual body, and had  ascended into heaven, where he had become the king and the judge of the  dead, and had attained unto everlasting life therein.    The chief reason for the persistence of the worship of Osiris in Egypt  was, probably, the fact that it promised both resurrection and eternal  life to its followers. Even after the Egyptians had embraced  Christianity they continued to mummify their dead, and for long after  they continued to mingle the attributes of their God and the \"gods\" with  those of God Almighty and Christ. The Egyptians of their own will never  got away from the belief that the body must be mummified if eternal life  was to be assured to the dead, but the Christians, though preaching the  same doctrine of the resurrection as the Egyptians, went a step further,  and insisted that there was no need to mummify the dead at all. St.  Anthony the Great besought his followers not to embalm his body and keep  it in a house, but to bury it and to tell no man where it had been  buried, lest those who loved him should come and draw it forth, and  mummify it as they were wont to do to the bodies of those whom they  regarded as saints. \"For long past,\" he said, \"I have entreated the  bishops and preachers to exhort the people not to continue to observe  this useless custom\"; and concerning his own body, he said, \"At the  resurrection of the dead I shall receive it from the Saviour  incorruptible.\" [Footnote: See Rosweyde, _Vitae Patrum_, p. 59; _Life of  St. Anthony_, by Athanusius (Migne), _Patrologiae_, Scr. Graec, tom. 26,  col. 972.] The spread of this idea gave the art of mummifying its  death-blow, and though from innate conservatism, and the love of having  the actual bodies of their beloved dead near them, the Egyptians  continued for a time to preserve their dead as before, yet little by  little the reasons for mummifying were forgotten, the knowledge of the  art died out, the funeral ceremonies were curtailed, the prayers became  a dead letter, and the custom of making mummies became obsolete. With  the death of the art died also the belief in and the worship of Osiris,  who from being the god of the dead became a dead god, and to the  Christians of Egypt, at least, his place was filled by Christ, \"the  firstfruits of them that slept,\" Whose resurrection and power to grant  eternal life were at that time being preached throughout most of the  known world. In Osiris the Christian Egyptians found the prototype of  Christ, and in the pictures and statues of Isis suckling her son Horus,  they perceived the prototypes of the Virgin Mary and her Child. Never  did Christianity find elsewhere in the world a people whose minds were  so thoroughly well prepared to receive its doctrines as the Egyptians.    This chapter may be fittingly ended by a few extracts from, the _Songs  of Isis and Nephthys_, which were sung in the Temple of Amen-R[=a] at  Thebes by two priestesses who personified the two goddesses. [Footnote  1: See my _Hieratic Papyrus of Nesi-Amsu (Archaeologia, vol. III_)]      \"Hail, thou lord of the underworld, thou Bull of those who are    therein, thou Image of R[=a]-Harmachis, thou Babe of beautiful    appearance, come thou to us in peace. Thou didst repel thy disasters,    thou didst drive away evil hap; Lord, come to us in peace.
