The afternoon had come when the Sheriff mounted his horse and joined  Robin Hood, who stood outside the gateway of the paved court waiting for  him, for he had sold his horse and cart to a trader for two marks. Then  they set forth upon their way, the Sheriff riding upon his horse and  Robin running beside him.  Thus they left Nottingham Town and traveled  forward along the dusty highway, laughing and jesting together as though  they had been old friends.  But all the time the Sheriff said within  himself, \"Thy jest to me of Robin Hood shall cost thee dear, good  fellow, even four hundred pounds, thou fool.\" For he thought he would  make at least that much by his bargain.    So they journeyed onward till they came within the verge of Sherwood  Forest, when presently the Sheriff looked up and down and to the right  and to the left of him, and then grew quiet and ceased his laughter.  \"Now,\" quoth he, \"may Heaven and its saints preserve us this day from a  rogue men call Robin Hood.\"    Then Robin laughed aloud.  \"Nay,\" said he, \"thou mayst set thy mind at  rest, for well do I know Robin Hood and well do I know that thou art in  no more danger from him this day than thou art from me.\"    At this the Sheriff looked askance at Robin, saying to himself, \"I like  not that thou seemest so well acquainted with this bold outlaw, and I  wish that I were well out of Sherwood Forest.\"    But still they traveled deeper into the forest shades, and the deeper  they went, the more quiet grew the Sheriff.  At last they came to where  the road took a sudden bend, and before them a herd of dun deer went  tripping across the path.  Then Robin Hood came close to the Sheriff and  pointing his finger, he said, \"These are my horned beasts, good Master  Sheriff.  How dost thou like them? Are they not fat and fair to see?\"    At this the Sheriff drew rein quickly.  \"Now fellow,\" quoth he, \"I would  I were well out of this forest, for I like not thy company. Go thou  thine own path, good friend, and let me but go mine.\"    But Robin only laughed and caught the Sheriff's bridle rein. \"Nay,\"  cried he, \"stay awhile, for I would thou shouldst see my brothers, who  own these fair horned beasts with me.\" So saying, he clapped his bugle  to his mouth and winded three merry notes, and presently up the path  came leaping fivescore good stout yeomen with Little John at their head.    \"What wouldst thou have, good master?\" quoth Little John.    \"Why,\" answered Robin, \"dost thou not see that I have brought goodly  company to feast with us today?  Fye, for shame! Do you not see our good  and worshipful master, the Sheriff of Nottingham?  Take thou his bridle,  Little John, for he has honored us today by coming to feast with us.\"    Then all doffed their hats humbly, without smiling or seeming to be in  jest, while Little John took the bridle rein and led the palfrey still  deeper into the forest, all marching in order, with Robin Hood walking  beside the Sheriff, hat in hand.    All this time the Sheriff said never a word but only looked about him  like one suddenly awakened from sleep; but when he found himself going  within the very depths of Sherwood his heart sank within him, for he  thought, \"Surely my three hundred pounds will be taken from me, even if  they take not my life itself, for I have plotted against their lives  more than once.\" But all seemed humble and meek and not a word was said  of danger, either to life or money.    So at last they came to that part of Sherwood Forest where a noble oak  spread its branches wide, and beneath it was a seat all made of moss, on  which Robin sat down, placing the Sheriff at his right hand. \"Now busk  ye, my merry men all,\" quoth he, \"and bring forth the best we have, both  of meat and wine, for his worship the Sheriff hath feasted me in  Nottingham Guild Hall today, and I would not have him go back empty.\"    All this time nothing had been said of the Sheriff's money, so presently  he began to pluck up heart.  \"For,\" said he to himself, \"maybe Robin  Hood hath forgotten all about it.\"    Then, while beyond in the forest bright fires crackled and savory smells  of sweetly roasting venison and fat capons filled the glade, and brown  pasties warmed beside the blaze, did Robin Hood entertain the Sheriff  right royally.  First, several couples stood forth at quarterstaff, and  so shrewd were they at the game, and so quickly did they give stroke and  parry, that the Sheriff, who loved to watch all lusty sports of the  kind, clapped his hands, forgetting where he was, and crying aloud,  \"Well struck! Well struck, thou fellow with the black beard!\" little  knowing that the man he called upon was the Tinker that tried to serve  his warrant upon Robin Hood.    Then several yeomen came forward and spread cloths upon the green grass,  and placed a royal feast; while others still broached barrels of sack  and Malmsey and good stout ale, and set them in jars upon the cloth,  with drinking horns about them. Then all sat down and feasted and drank  merrily together until the sun was low and the half-moon glimmered with  a pale light betwixt the leaves of the trees overhead.    Then the Sheriff arose and said, \"I thank you all, good yeomen, for the  merry entertainment ye have given me this day. Right courteously have ye  used me, showing therein that ye have much respect for our glorious King  and his deputy in brave Nottinghamshire.  But the shadows grow long, and  I must away before darkness comes, lest I lose myself within the  forest.\"    Then Robin Hood and all his merry men arose also, and Robin said to the  Sheriff, \"If thou must go, worshipful sir, go thou must; but thou hast  forgotten one thing.\"    \"Nay, I forgot nought,\" said the Sheriff; yet all the same his heart  sank within him.    \"But I say thou hast forgot something,\" quoth Robin.  \"We keep a merry  inn here in the greenwood, but whoever becometh our guest must pay his  reckoning.\"    Then the Sheriff laughed, but the laugh was hollow.  \"Well, jolly boys,\"  quoth he, \"we have had a merry time together today, and even if ye had  not asked me, I would have given you a score of pounds for the sweet  entertainment I have had.\"    \"Nay,\" quoth Robin seriously, \"it would ill beseem us to treat Your  Worship so meanly.  By my faith, Sir Sheriff, I would be ashamed to show  my face if I did not reckon the King's deputy at three hundred pounds.  Is it not so, my merry men all?\"    Then \"Ay!\" cried all, in a loud voice.    \"Three hundred devils!\" roared the Sheriff.  \"Think ye that your  beggarly feast was worth three pounds, let alone three hundred?\"    \"Nay,\" quoth Robin gravely.  \"Speak not so roundly, Your Worship.  I do  love thee for the sweet feast thou hast given me this day in merry  Nottingham Town; but there be those here who love thee not so much.  If  thou wilt look down the cloth thou wilt see Will Stutely, in whose eyes  thou hast no great favor; then two other stout fellows are there here  that thou knowest not, that were wounded in a brawl nigh Nottingham  Town, some time ago--thou wottest when; one of them was sore hurt in one  arm, yet he hath got the use of it again. Good Sheriff, be advised by  me; pay thy score without more ado, or maybe it may fare ill with thee.\"    As he spoke the Sheriff's ruddy cheeks grew pale, and he said nothing  more but looked upon the ground and gnawed his nether lip. Then slowly  he drew forth his fat purse and threw it upon the cloth in front of him.    \"Now take the purse, Little John,\" quoth Robin Hood, \"and see that the  reckoning be right.  We would not doubt our Sheriff, but he might not  like it if he should find he had not paid his full score.\"    Then Little John counted the money and found that the bag held three  hundred pounds in silver and gold.  But to the Sheriff it seemed as if  every clink of the bright money was a drop of blood from his veins. And  when he saw it all counted out in a heap of silver and gold, filling a  wooden platter, he turned away and silently mounted his horse.    \"Never have we had so worshipful a guest before!\" quoth Robin, \"and, as  the day waxeth late, I will send one of my young men to guide thee out  of the forest depths.\"    \"Nay, Heaven forbid!\" cried the Sheriff hastily.  \"I can find mine own  way, good man, without aid.\"    \"Then I will put thee on the right track mine own self,\" quoth Robin,  and, taking the Sheriff's horse by the bridle rein, he led him into the  main forest path.  Then, before he let him go, he said, \"Now, fare thee  well, good Sheriff, and when next thou thinkest to despoil some poor  prodigal, remember thy feast in Sherwood Forest.  'Ne'er buy a horse,  good friend, without first looking into its mouth,' as our good gaffer  Swanthold says.  And so, once more, fare thee well.\" Then he clapped his  hand to the horse's back, and off went nag and Sheriff through the  forest glades.    Then bitterly the Sheriff rued the day that first he meddled with Robin  Hood, for all men laughed at him and many ballads were sung by folk  throughout the country, of how the Sheriff went to shear and came home  shorn to the very quick. For thus men sometimes overreach themselves  through greed and guile.          Little John Goes to Nottingham Fair    SPRING HAD GONE since the Sheriff's feast in Sherwood, and summer also,  and the mellow month of October had come. All the air was cool and  fresh; the harvests were gathered home, the young birds were full  fledged, the hops were plucked, and apples were ripe.  But though time  had so smoothed things over that men no longer talked of the horned  beasts that the Sheriff wished to buy, he was still sore about the  matter and could not bear to hear Robin Hood's name spoken in his  presence.    With October had come the time for holding the great Fair which was  celebrated every five years at Nottingham Town, to which folk came from  far and near throughout the country. At such"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1015"],[0,"The Oregon Trail: Sketches of Prairie and Rocky-Mountain Life (#12)"],[1," utmost precaution, kept aloof from the firelight, and sat watching  intently on all sides. At length he was aware of a dark, crouching  figure, stealing noiselessly into the circle of the light. He hastily  cocked his rifle, but the sharp click of the lock caught the ear of  Blackfoot, whose senses were all on the alert. Raising his arrow,  already fitted to the string, he shot in the direction of the sound. So  sure was his aim that he drove it through the throat of the unfortunate  guard, and then, with a loud yell, bounded from the camp.    As I looked at the partner of my watch, puffing and blowing over his  fire, it occurred to me that he might not prove the most efficient  auxiliary in time of trouble.    \"Delorier,\" said I, \"would you run away if the Pawnees should fire at  us?\"    \"Ah! oui, oui, monsieur!\" he replied very decisively.    I did not doubt the fact, but was a little surprised at the frankness of  the confession.    At this instant a most whimsical variety of voices--barks, howls, yelps,  and whines--all mingled as it were together, sounded from the prairie,  not far off, as if a whole conclave of wolves of every age and sex were  assembled there. Delorier looked up from his work with a laugh, and  began to imitate this curious medley of sounds with a most ludicrous  accuracy. At this they were repeated with redoubled emphasis, the  musician being apparently indignant at the successful efforts of a  rival. They all proceeded from the throat of one little wolf, not  larger than a spaniel, seated by himself at some distance. He was of  the species called the prairie wolf; a grim-visaged, but harmless little  brute, whose worst propensity is creeping among horses and gnawing the  ropes of raw hide by which they are picketed around the camp. But  other beasts roam the prairies, far more formidable in aspect and in  character. These are the large white and gray wolves, whose deep howl we  heard at intervals from far and near.    At last I fell into a doze, and, awakening from it, found Delorier  fast asleep. Scandalized by this breach of discipline, I was about to  stimulate his vigilance by stirring him with the stock of my rifle; but  compassion prevailing, I determined to let him sleep awhile, and then to  arouse him, and administer a suitable reproof for such a forgetfulness  of duty. Now and then I walked the rounds among the silent horses, to  see that all was right. The night was chill, damp, and dark, the dank  grass bending under the icy dewdrops. At the distance of a rod or two  the tents were invisible, and nothing could be seen but the obscure  figures of the horses, deeply breathing, and restlessly starting as they  slept, or still slowly champing the grass. Far off, beyond the black  outline of the prairie, there was a ruddy light, gradually increasing,  like the glow of a conflagration; until at length the broad disk of the  moon, blood-red, and vastly magnified by the vapors, rose slowly upon  the darkness, flecked by one or two little clouds, and as the light  poured over the gloomy plain, a fierce and stern howl, close at hand,  seemed to greet it as an unwelcome intruder. There was something  impressive and awful in the place and the hour; for I and the beasts  were all that had consciousness for many a league around.    Some days elapsed, and brought us near the Platte. Two men on horseback  approached us one morning, and we watched them with the curiosity and  interest that, upon the solitude of the plains, such an encounter always  excites. They were evidently whites, from their mode of riding, though,  contrary to the usage of that region, neither of them carried a rifle.    \"Fools!\" remarked Henry Chatillon, \"to ride that way on the prairie;  Pawnee find them--then they catch it!\"    Pawnee HAD found them, and they had come very near \"catching it\";  indeed, nothing saved them from trouble but the approach of our party.  Shaw and I knew one of them; a man named Turner, whom we had seen at  Westport. He and his companion belonged to an emigrant party encamped  a few miles in advance, and had returned to look for some stray oxen,  leaving their rifles, with characteristic rashness or ignorance behind  them. Their neglect had nearly cost them dear; for just before we  came up, half a dozen Indians approached, and seeing them apparently  defenseless, one of the rascals seized the bridle of Turner's fine  horse, and ordered him to dismount. Turner was wholly unarmed; but the  other jerked a little revolving pistol out of his pocket, at which  the Pawnee recoiled; and just then some of our men appearing in the  distance, the whole party whipped their rugged little horses, and made  off. In no way daunted, Turner foolishly persisted in going forward.    Long after leaving him, and late this afternoon, in the midst of a  gloomy and barren prairie, we came suddenly upon the great Pawnee trail,  leading from their villages on the Platte to their war and hunting  grounds to the southward. Here every summer pass the motley concourse;  thousands of savages, men, women, and children, horses and mules, laden  with their weapons and implements, and an innumerable multitude of  unruly wolfish dogs, who have not acquired the civilized accomplishment  of barking, but howl like their wild cousins of the prairie.    The permanent winter villages of the Pawnees stand on the lower Platte,  but throughout the summer the greater part of the inhabitants are  wandering over the plains, a treacherous cowardly banditti, who by a  thousand acts of pillage and murder have deserved summary chastisement  at the hands of government. Last year a Dakota warrior performed a  signal exploit at one of these villages. He approached it alone in the  middle of a dark night, and clambering up the outside of one of the  lodges which are in the form of a half-sphere, he looked in at the round  hole made at the top for the escape of smoke. The dusky light from the  smoldering embers showed him the forms of the sleeping inmates; and  dropping lightly through the opening, he unsheathed his knife, and  stirring the fire coolly selected his victims. One by one he stabbed and  scalped them, when a child suddenly awoke and screamed. He rushed from  the lodge, yelled a Sioux war-cry, shouted his name in triumph and  defiance, and in a moment had darted out upon the dark prairie, leaving  the whole village behind him in a tumult, with the howling and baying of  dogs, the screams of women and the yells of the enraged warriors.    Our friend Kearsley, as we learned on rejoining him, signalized himself  by a less bloody achievement. He and his men were good woodsmen, and  well skilled in the use of the rifle, but found themselves wholly out of  their element on the prairie. None of them had ever seen a buffalo and  they had very vague conceptions of his nature and appearance. On the  day after they reached the Platte, looking toward a distant swell, they  beheld a multitude of little black specks in motion upon its surface.    \"Take your rifles, boys,\" said Kearslcy, \"and we'll have fresh meat for  supper.\" This inducement was quite sufficient. The ten men left their  wagons and set out in hot haste, some on horseback and some on foot, in  pursuit of the supposed buffalo. Meanwhile a high grassy ridge shut the  game from view; but mounting it after half an hour's running and riding,  they found themselves suddenly confronted by about thirty mounted  Pawnees! The amazement and consternation were mutual. Having nothing but  their bows and arrows, the Indians thought their hour was come, and  the fate that they were no doubt conscious of richly deserving about  to overtake them. So they began, one and all, to shout forth the most  cordial salutations of friendship, running up with extreme earnestness  to shake hands with the Missourians, who were as much rejoiced as they  were to escape the expected conflict.    A low undulating line of sand-hills bounded the horizon before us. That  day we rode ten consecutive hours, and it was dusk before we entered the  hollows and gorges of these gloomy little hills. At length we gained the  summit, and the long expected valley of the Platte lay before us. We  all drew rein, and, gathering in a knot on the crest of the hill, sat  joyfully looking down upon the prospect. It was right welcome; strange  too, and striking to the imagination, and yet it had not one picturesque  or beautiful feature; nor had it any of the features of grandeur, other  than its vast extent, its solitude, and its wilderness. For league after  league a plain as level as a frozen lake was outspread beneath us;  here and there the Platte, divided into a dozen threadlike sluices, was  traversing it, and an occasional clump of wood, rising in the midst like  a shadowy island, relieved the monotony of the waste. No living thing  was moving throughout the vast landscape, except the lizards that darted  over the sand and through the rank grass and prickly-pear just at our  feet. And yet stern and wild associations gave a singular interest to  the view; for here each man lives by the strength of his arm and the  valor of his heart. Here society is reduced to its original elements,  the whole fabric of art and conventionality is struck rudely to pieces,  and men find themselves suddenly brought back to the wants and resources  of their original natures.    We had passed the more toilsome and monotonous part of the journey; but  four hundred miles still intervened between us and Fort Laramie; and to  reach that point cost us the travel of three additional weeks. During  the whole of this time we were passing up the center of a long narrow  sandy plain, reaching like an outstretched belt nearly to the Rocky  Mountains. Two lines of sand-hills, broken often into the wildest and  most fantastic forms, flanked the valley at the distance of a mile or  two on the right and left; while beyond them lay a barren, trackless  waste--The"]]]
