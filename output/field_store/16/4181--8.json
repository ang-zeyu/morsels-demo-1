The five men returned to the starting point, where the victor was  greeted by loud whoops. The groom got the first drink from the  bottle, then came the attendants, and others in order, after which  the bottle was put away to be kept as a memento of the occasion.    The party now repaired to the village and marched to the home of the  bride. The hour for the observance of the marriage rites was just  before the midday meal. When the groom reached the bride's home he  found her in readiness. Sweet and pretty Alice looked in her gray  linsey gown, perfectly plain and simple though it was, without an  ornament or a ribbon. Proud indeed looked her lover as he took her  hand and led her up to the waiting minister. When the whisperings  had ceased the minister asked who gave this woman to be married.  Alice's father answered.    \"Will you take this woman to be your wedded wife, to love, cherish  and protect her all the days of her life?\" asked the minister.    \"I will,\" answered a deep bass voice.    \"Will you take this man to be your wedded husband, to love, honor  and obey him all the days of your life?\"    \"I will,\" said Alice, in a low tone.    \"I pronounce you man and wife. Those whom God has joined together  let no man put asunder.\"    There was a brief prayer and the ceremony ended. Then followed the  congratulations of relatives and friends. The felicitations were apt  to be trying to the nerves of even the best tempered groom. The hand  shakes, the heavy slaps on the back, and the pommeling he received  at the hands of his intimate friends were as nothing compared to the  anguish of mind he endured while they were kissing his wife. The  young bucks would not have considered it a real wedding had they  been prevented from kissing the bride, and for that matter, every  girl within reach. So fast as the burly young settlers could push  themselves through the densely packed rooms they kissed the bride,  and then the first girl they came to.    Betty and Lydia had been Alice's maids of honor. This being Betty's  first experience at a frontier wedding, it developed that she was  much in need of Lydia's advice, which she had previously disdained.  She had rested secure in her dignity. Poor Betty! The first man to  kiss Alice was George Martin, a big, strong fellow, who gathered his  brother's bride into his arms and gave her a bearish hug and a  resounding kiss. Releasing her he turned toward Lydia and Betty.  Lydia eluded him, but one of his great hands clasped around Betty's  wrist. She tried to look haughty, but with everyone laughing, and  the young man's face expressive of honest fun and happiness she  found it impossible. She stood still and only turned her face a  little to one side while George kissed her. The young men now made a  rush for her. With blushing cheeks Betty, unable to stand her ground  any longer, ran to her brother, the Colonel. He pushed her away with  a laugh. She turned to Major McColloch, who held out his arms to  her. With an exclamation she wrenched herself free from a young man,  who had caught her hand, and flew to the Major. But alas for Betty!  The Major was not proof against the temptation and he kissed her  himself.    \"Traitor!\" cried Betty, breaking away from him.    Poor Betty was in despair. She had just made up her mind to submit  when she caught sight of Wetzel's familiar figure. She ran to him  and the hunter put one of his long arms around her.    \"I reckon I kin take care of you, Betty,\" he said, a smile playing  over his usually stern face. \"See here, you young bucks. Betty don't  want to be kissed, and if you keep on pesterin' her I'll have to  scalp a few of you.\"    The merriment grew as the day progressed. During the wedding feast  great hilarity prevailed. It culminated in the dance which followed  the dinner. The long room of the block-house had been decorated with  evergreens, autumn leaves and goldenrod, which were scattered  profusely about, hiding the blackened walls and bare rafters.  Numerous blazing pine knots, fastened on sticks which were stuck  into the walls, lighted up a scene, which for color and animation  could not have been surpassed.    Colonel Zane's old slave, Sam, who furnished the music, sat on a  raised platform at the upper end of the hall, and the way he sawed  away on his fiddle, accompanying the movements of his arm with a  swaying of his body and a stamping of his heavy foot, showed he had  a hearty appreciation of his own value.    Prominent among the men and women standing and sitting near the  platform could be distinguished the tall forms of Jonathan Zane,  Major McColloch and Wetzel, all, as usual, dressed in their hunting  costumes and carrying long rifles. The other men had made more or  less effort to improve their appearance. Bright homespun shirts and  scarfs had replaced the everyday buckskin garments. Major McColloch  was talking to Colonel Zane. The genial faces of both reflected the  pleasure they felt in the enjoyment of the younger people. Jonathan  Zane stood near the door. Moody and silent he watched the dance.  Wetzel leaned against the wall. The black barrel of his rifle lay in  the hollow of his arm. The hunter was gravely contemplating the  members of the bridal party who were dancing in front of him. When  the dance ended Lydia and Betty stopped before Wetzel and Betty  said: \"Lew, aren't you going to ask us to dance?\"    The hunter looked down into the happy, gleaming faces, and smiling  in his half sad way, answered: \"Every man to his gifts.\"    \"But you can dance. I want you to put aside your gun long enough to  dance with me. If I waited for you to ask me, I fear I should have  to wait a long time. Come, Lew, here I am asking you, and I know the  other men are dying to dance with me,\" said Betty, coaxingly, in a  roguish voice.    Wetzel never refused a request of Betty's, and so, laying aside his  weapons, he danced with her, to the wonder and admiration of all.  Colonel Zane clapped his hands, and everyone stared in amazement at  the unprecedented sight Wetzel danced not ungracefully. He was  wonderfully light on his feet. His striking figure, the long black  hair, and the fancifully embroidered costume he wore contrasted  strangely with Betty's slender, graceful form and pretty gray dress.    \"Well, well, Lewis, I would not have believed anything but the  evidence of my own eyes,\" said Colonel Zane, with a laugh, as Betty  and Wetzel approached him.    \"If all the men could dance as well as Lew, the girls would be  thankful, I can assure you,\" said Betty.    \"Betty, I declare you grow prettier every day,\" said old John  Bennet, who was standing with the Colonel and the Major. \"If I were  only a young man once more I should try my chances with you, and I  wouldn't give up very easily.\"    \"I do not know, Uncle John, but I am inclined to think that if you  were a young man and should come a-wooing you would not get a rebuff  from me,\" answered Betty, smiling on the old man, of whom she was  very fond.    \"Miss Zane, will you dance with me?\"    The voice sounded close by Betty's side. She recognized it, and an  unaccountable sensation of shyness suddenly came over her. She had  firmly made up her mind, should Mr. Clarke ask her to dance, that  she would tell him she was tired, or engaged for that  number--anything so that she could avoid dancing with him. But, now  that the moment had come she either forgot her resolution or lacked  the courage to keep it, for as the music commenced, she turned and  without saying a word or looking at him, she placed her hand on his  arm. He whirled her away. She gave a start of surprise and delight  at the familiar step and then gave herself up to the charm of the  dance. Supported by his strong arm she floated around the room in a  sort of dream. Dancing as they did was new to the young people at  the Fort--it was a style then in vogue in the east--and everyone  looked on with great interest and curiosity. But all too soon the  dance ended and before Betty had recovered her composure she found  that her partner had led her to a secluded seat in the lower end of  the hall. The bench was partly obscured from the dancers by masses  of autumn leaves. \"That was a very pleasant dance,\" said Alfred.  \"Miss Boggs told me you danced the round dance.\"    \"I was much surprised and pleased,\" said Betty, who had indeed  enjoyed it.    \"It has been a delightful day,\" went on Alfred, seeing that Betty  was still confused. \"I almost killed myself in that race for the  bottle this morning. I never saw such logs and brush heaps and  ditches in my life. I am sure that if the fever of recklessness  which seemed in the air had not suddenly seized me I would never  have put my horse at such leaps.\"    \"I heard my brother say your horse was one of the best he had ever  seen, and that you rode superbly,\" murmured Betty.    \"Well, to be honest, I would not care to take that ride again. It  certainly was not fair to the horse.\"    \"How do you like the fort by this time?\"    \"Miss Zane, I am learning to love this free, wild life. I really  think I was made for the frontier. The odd customs and manners which  seemed strange at first have become very acceptable to me now. I  find everyone so honest and simple and brave. Here one must work to  live, which is right. Do you know, I never worked in my life until I  came to Fort Henry. My life was all uselessness, idleness.\"    \"I can hardly believe that,\" answered Betty. \"You have learned to  dance and ride and--\"    \"What?\" asked Alfred, as Betty hesitated.    \"Never mind. It was an accomplishment with which the girls credited  you,\" said Betty, with a little laugh.    \"I suppose I did not deserve it. I heard I had a singular aptitude  for discovering young ladies in distress.\"    \"Have you become well acquainted with the boys?\" asked Betty,  hastening to change the subject.    \"Oh, yes,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1262"],[0,"The Heritage of the Desert: A Novel (#12)"],[1,"a garden.    \"Get the forty-four,\" concluded Naab, \"and we'll go out and break it  in.\"    With the long rifle in the hollow of his arm Jack forgot that he was a  sick man. When he came within gunshot of the flock the smell of sheep  effectually smothered the keen, tasty odor of black sage and juniper.  Sheep ranged everywhere under the low cedars. They browsed with noses in  the frost, and from all around came the tinkle of tiny bells on the  curly-horned rams, and an endless variety of bleats.    \"They're spread now,\" said August. \"Mescal drives them on every little  while and Piute goes ahead to pick out the best browse. Watch the dog,  Jack; he's all but human. His mother was a big shepherd dog that I got  in Lund. She must have had a strain of wild blood. Once while I was  hunting deer on Coconina she ran off with timber wolves and we thought  she was killed. But she came back, and had a litter of three puppies.  Two were white, the other black. I think she killed the black one. And  she neglected the others. One died, and Mescal raised the other. We  called him Wolf. He loves Mescal, and loves the sheep, and hates a wolf.  Mescal puts a bell on him when she is driving, and the sheep know the  bell. I think it would be a good plan for her to tie something red round  his neck--a scarf, so as to keep you from shooting him for a wolf.\"    Nimble, alert, the big white dog was not still a moment. His duty was to  keep the flock compact, to head the stragglers and turn them back; and  he knew his part perfectly. There was dash and fire in his work. He  never barked. As he circled the flock the small Navajo sheep, edging  ever toward forbidden ground, bleated their way back to the fold, the  larger ones wheeled reluctantly, and the old belled rams squared  themselves, lowering their massive horns as if to butt him. Never,  however, did they stand their ground when he reached them, for there was  a decision about Wolf which brooked no opposition. At times when he was  working on one side a crafty sheep on the other would steal out into the  thicket. Then Mescal called and Wolf flashed back to her, lifting his  proud head, eager, spirited, ready to take his order. A word, a wave of  her whip sufficed for the dog to rout out the recalcitrant sheep and  send him bleating to his fellows.    \"He manages them easily now,\" said Naab, \"but when the lambs come they  can't be kept in. The coyotes and wolves hang out in the thickets and  pick up the stragglers. The worst enemy of sheep, though, is the old  grizzly bear. Usually he is grouchy, and dangerous to hunt. He comes  into the herd, kills the mother sheep, and eats the milk-bag--no more!  He will kill forty sheep in a night. Piute saw the tracks of one up on  the high range, and believes this bear is following the flock. Let's get  off into the woods some little way, into the edge of the thickets--for  Piute always keeps to the glades--and see if we can pick off a few  coyotes.\"    August cautioned Jack to step stealthily, and slip from cedar to cedar,  to use every bunch of sage and juniper to hide his advance.    \"Watch sharp, Jack. I've seen two already. Look for moving things. Don't  try to see one quiet, for you can't till after your eye catches him  moving. They are gray, gray as the cedars, the grass, the ground. Good!  Yes, I see him, but don't shoot. That's too far. Wait. They sneak away,  but they return. You can afford to make sure. Here now, by that stone--  aim low and be quick.\"    In the course of a mile, without keeping the sheep near at hand, they  saw upward of twenty coyotes, five of which Jack killed in as many  shots.    \"You've got the hang of it,\" said Naab, rubbing his hands. \"You'll kill  the varmints. Piute will skin and salt the pelts. Now I'm going up on  the high range to look for bear sign. Go ahead, on your own hook.\"    Hare was regardless of time while he stole under the cedars and through  the thickets, spying out the cunning coyotes. Then Naab's yell pealing  out claimed his attention; he answered and returned. When they met he  recounted his adventures in mingled excitement and disappointment.    \"Are you tired?\" asked Naab.    \"Tired? No,\" replied Jack.    \"Well, you mustn't overdo the very first day. I've news for you. There  are some wild horses on the high range. I didn't see them, but found  tracks everywhere. If they come down here you send Piute to close the  trail at the upper end of the bench, and you close the one where we came  up. There are only two trails where even a deer can get off this  plateau, and both are narrow splits in the wall, which can be barred by  the gates. We made the gates to keep the sheep in, and they'll serve a  turn. If you get the wild horses on the bench send Piute for me at  once.\"    They passed the Indian herding the sheep into a corral built against an  uprising ridge of stone. Naab dispatched him to look for the dead  coyotes. The three burros were in camp, two wearing empty pack-saddles,  and Noddle, for once not asleep, was eating from Mescal's hand.    \"Mescal, hadn't I better take Black Bolly home?\" asked August.    \"Mayn't I keep her?\"    \"She's yours. But you run a risk. There are wild horses on the range.  Will you keep her hobbled?\"    \"Yes,\" replied Mescal, reluctantly. \"Though I don't believe Bolly would  run off from me.\"    \"Look out she doesn't go, hobbles and all. Jack, here's the other bit of  news I have for you. There's a big grizzly camping on the trail of our  sheep. Now what I want to know is--shall I leave him to you, or put off  work and come up here to wait for him myself?\"    \"Why--\" said Jack, slowly, \"whatever you say. If you think you can  safely leave him to me--I'm willing.\"    \"A grizzly won't be pleasant to face. I never knew one of those sheep-  killers that wouldn't run at a man, if wounded.\"    \"Tell me what to do.\"    \"If he comes down it's more than likely to be after dark. Don't risk  hunting him then. Wait till morning, and put Wolf on his trail. He'll be  up in the rocks, and by holding in the dog you may find him asleep in a  cave. However, if you happen to meet him by day do this. Don't waste any  shots. Climb a ledge or tree if one be handy. If not, stand your ground.  Get down on your knee and shoot and let him come. Mind you, he'll grunt  when he's hit, and start for you, and keep coming till he's dead. Have  confidence in yourself and your gun, for you can kill him. Aim low, and  shoot steady. If he keeps on coming there's always a fatal shot, and  that is when he rises. You'll see a bare spot on his breast. Put a  forty-four into that, and he'll go down.\"    August had spoken so easily, quite as if he were explaining how to shear  a yearling sheep, that Jack's feelings fluctuated between amazement and  laughter. Verily this desert man was stripped of all the false fears of  civilization.    \"Now, Jack, I'm off. Good-bye and good luck. Mescal, look out for  him.... So-ho! Noddle! Getup! Biscuit!\" And with many a cheery word and  slap he urged the burros into the forest, where they and his tall form  soon disappeared among the trees.    Piute came stooping toward camp so burdened with coyotes that he could  scarcely be seen under the gray pile. With a fervent \"damn\" he tumbled  them under a cedar, and trotted back into the forest for another load.  Jack insisted on assuming his share of the duties about camp; and Mescal  assigned him to the task of gathering firewood, breaking red-hot sticks  of wood into small pieces, and raking them into piles of live coals.  Then they ate, these two alone. Jack did not do justice to the supper;  excitement had robbed him of appetite. He told Mescal how he had crept  upon the coyotes, how so many had eluded him, how he had missed a gray  wolf. He plied her with questions about the sheep, and wanted to know if  there would be more wolves, and if she thought the \"silvertip\" would  come. He was quite carried away by the events of the day.    The sunset drew him to the rim. Dark clouds were mantling the desert  like rolling smoke from a prairie-fire. He almost stumbled over Mescal,  who sat with her back to a stone. Wolf lay with his head in her lap, and  he growled.    \"There's a storm on the desert,\" she said. \"Those smoky streaks are  flying sand. We may have snow to-night. It's colder, and the wind is  north. See, I've a blanket. You had better get one.\"    He thanked her and went for it. Piute was eating his supper, and the  peon had just come in. The bright campfire was agreeable, yet Hare did  not feel cold. But he wrapped himself in a blanket and returned to  Mescal and sat beside her. The desert lay indistinct in the foreground,  inscrutable beyond; the canyon lost its line in gloom. The solemnity of  the scene stilled his unrest, the strange freedom of longings unleashed  that day. What had come over him? He shook his head; but with the  consciousness of self returned a feeling of fatigue, the burning pain in  his chest, the bitter-sweet smell of black sage and juniper.    \"You love this outlook?\" he asked.    \"Yes.\"    \"Do you sit here often?\"    \"Every evening.\"    \"Is it the sunset that you care for, the roar of the river, just being  here high above it all?\"    \"It's that last, perhaps; I don't know.\"    \"Haven't you been lonely?\"    \"No.\"    \"You'd rather be here with the sheep than be in Lund, or Salt Lake City,  as Esther and Judith want to be?\"    \"Yes.\"    Any other reply from her would not have been consistent with the  impression she was making on him. As yet he had hardly regarded her as a  young girl; she had been part of this beautiful desert-land. But he  began to see in her a responsive being, influenced by his presence. If  the situation was wonderful to him what must it be for her? Like a shy,  illusive creature, unused to men, she was troubled by questions, fearful  of the sound of her own voice. Yet in repose, as she watched the lights  and shadows, she was serene, unconscious; her"]]]
