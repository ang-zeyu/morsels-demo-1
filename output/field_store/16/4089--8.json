[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10114"],[0,"The Great Events (#12)"],[1," in the Grecian world: at length it  passed to Athens, and first showed itself in the Piraeus. The progress  of the disease was as rapid and destructive as its appearance had been  sudden; while the extraordinary accumulation of people within the city  and long walls, in consequence of the presence of the invaders in the  country, was but too favorable to every form of contagion. Families  crowded together in close cabins and places of temporary  shelter--throughout a city constructed, like most of those in Greece,  with little regard to the conditions of salubrity and in a state of  mental chagrin from the forced abandonment and sacrifice of their  properties in the country, transmitted the disorder with fatal facility  from one to the other. Beginning as it did about the middle of April,  the increasing heat of summer further aided the disorder, the symptoms  of which, alike violent and sudden, made themselves the more remarked  because the year was particularly exempt from maladies of every other  description.    Of this plague--or, more properly, eruptive typhoid fever, distinct  from, yet analogous to, the smallpox--a description no less clear than  impressive has been left by the historian Thucydides, himself not only a  spectator but a sufferer. It is not one of the least of his merits, that  his notice of the symptoms, given at so early a stage of medical science  and observation, is such as to instruct the medical reader of the  present age, and to enable the malady to be understood and identified.  The observations with which that notice is ushered in deserve particular  attention. \"In respect to this distemper (he says), let every man,  physician or not, say what he thinks respecting the source from whence  it may probably have arisen, and respecting the causes which he deems  sufficiently powerful to have produced so great a revolution. But I,  having myself had the distemper, and having seen others suffering under  it, will state _what it actually was_, and will indicate in addition  such other matters as will furnish any man, who lays them to heart, with  knowledge and the means of calculation beforehand, in case the same  misfortune should ever occur again.\"    To record past facts, as a basis for rational prevision in regard to the  future--the same sentiment which Thucydides mentions in his preface, as  having animated him to the composition of his history--was at that time  a duty so little understood that we have reason to admire not less the  manner in which he performs it in practice than the distinctness with  which he conceives it in theory. We infer from his language that  speculation in his day was active respecting the causes of this plague,  according to the vague and fanciful physics, and scanty stock of  ascertained facts, which was all that could then be consulted. By  resisting the itch of theorizing from one of those loose hypotheses  which then appeared plausibly to explain everything, he probably  renounced the point of view from which most credit and interest would be  derivable at the time. But his simple and precise summary of observed  facts carries with it an imperishable value, and even affords grounds  for imagining that he was no stranger to the habits and training of his  contemporary Hippocrates, and the other Asclepiads of Cos.    It is hardly within the province of a historian of Greece to repeat  after Thucydides the painful enumeration of symptoms, violent in the  extreme and pervading every portion of the bodily system, which marked  this fearful disorder. Beginning in Piraeus, it quickly passed into the  city, and both the one and the other was speedily filled with sickness  and suffering, the like of which had never before been known. The  seizures were sudden, and a large proportion of the sufferers perished  after deplorable agonies on the seventh or on the ninth day. Others,  whose strength of constitution carried them over this period, found  themselves the victims of exhausting and incurable diarrhoea afterward;  with others again, after traversing both these stages, the distemper  fixed itself in some particular member, the eyes, the genitals, the  hands, or the feet, which were rendered permanently useless, or in some  cases amputated, even where the patient himself recovered.    There were also some whose recovery was attended with a total loss of  memory, so that they no more knew themselves or recognized their  friends. No treatment or remedy appearing, except in accidental cases,  to produce any beneficial effect, the physicians or surgeons whose aid  was invoked became completely at fault. While trying their accustomed  means without avail, they soon ended by catching the malady themselves  and perishing. The charms and incantations, to which the unhappy patient  resorted, were not likely to be more efficacious. While some asserted  that the Peloponnesians had poisoned the cisterns of water, others  referred the visitation to the wrath of the gods, and especially to  Apollo, known by hearers of the _Iliad_ as author of pestilence in the  Greek host before Troy. It was remembered that this Delphian god had  promised the Lacedaemonians, in reply to their application immediately  before the war, that he would assist them whether invoked or uninvoked;  and the disorder now raging was ascribed to the intervention of their  irresistible ally; while the elderly men further called to mind an  oracular verse sung in the time of their youth: \"The Dorian war will  come, and pestilence along with it.\" Under the distress which suggested,  and was reciprocally aggravated by these gloomy ideas, prophets were  consulted, and supplications with solemn procession were held at the  temples, to appease the divine wrath.    When it was found that neither the priest nor the physician could retard  the spread or mitigate the intensity of the disorder, the Athenians  abandoned themselves to despair, and the space within the walls became a  scene of desolating misery. Every man attacked with the malady at once  lost his courage--a state of depression itself among the worst features  of the case, which made him lie down and die, without any attempt to  seek for preservatives. And although at first friends and relatives lent  their aid to tend the sick with the usual family sympathies, yet so  terrible was the number of these attendants who perished, \"like sheep,\"  from such contact, that at length no man would thus expose himself;  while the most generous spirits, who persisted longest in the discharge  of their duty, were carried off in the greatest numbers. The patient was  thus left to die alone and unheeded. Sometimes all the inmates of a  house were swept away one after the other, no man being willing to go  near it: desertion on the one hand, attendance on the other, both tended  to aggravate the calamity. There remained only those who, having had the  disorder and recovered, were willing to tend the sufferers.    These men formed the single exception to the all-pervading misery of the  time--for the disorder seldom attacked anyone twice, and when it did the  second attack was never fatal. Elate with their own escape, they deemed  themselves out of the reach of all disease, and were full of  compassionate kindness for others whose sufferings were just beginning.  It was from them too that the principal attention to the bodies of  deceased victims proceeded: for such was the state of dismay and sorrow  that even the nearest relatives neglected the sepulchral duties, sacred  beyond all others in the eyes of a Greek. Nor is there any circumstance  which conveys to us so vivid an idea of the prevalent agony and despair  as when we read, in the words of an eyewitness, that the deaths took  place among this close-packed crowd without the smallest decencies of  attention--that the dead and the dying lay piled one upon another not  merely in the public roads, but even in the temples, in spite of the  understood defilement of the sacred building--that half-dead sufferers  were seen lying round all the springs, from insupportable thirst--that  the numerous corpses thus unburied and exposed were in such a condition  that the dogs which meddled with them died in consequence, while no  vultures or other birds of the like habits ever came near.    Those bodies which escaped entire neglect were burnt or buried without  the customary mourning, and with unseemly carelessness. In some cases  the bearers of a body, passing by a funeral pile on which another body  was burning, would put their own there to be burnt also; or perhaps, if  the pile was prepared ready for a body not yet arrived, would deposit  their own upon it, set fire to the pile, and then depart. Such indecent  confusion would have been intolerable to the feelings of the Athenians  in any ordinary times.    To all these scenes of physical suffering, death, and reckless despair  was superadded another evil, which affected those who were fortunate  enough to escape the rest. The bonds both of law and morality became  relaxed, amid such total uncertainty of every man both for his own life  and that of others. Men cared not to abstain from wrong, under  circumstances in which punishment was not likely to overtake them, nor  to put a check upon their passions, and endure privations, in obedience  even to their strongest conviction, when the chance was so small of  their living to reap reward or enjoy any future esteem. An interval,  short and sweet, before their doom was realized--before they became  plunged in the widespread misery which they witnessed around, and which  affected indiscriminately the virtuous and the profligate--was all that  they looked to enjoy; embracing with avidity the immediate pleasures of  sense, as well as such positive gains, however ill-gotten, as could be  made the means of procuring them, and throwing aside all thought both of  honor and of long-sighted advantage. Life and property being alike  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10136"],[0,"The Book of Household Management (#12)"],[1,"at first,    Thrives against hope, and, in the rudest scene,    Storms but enliven its unfading green;    Exub'rant is the shadow it supplies,    Its fruit on earth, its growth above the skies.        Visiting the houses of the poor is the only practical way really      to understand the actual state of each family; and although      there may be difficulties in following out this plan in the      metropolis and other large cities, yet in country towns and      rural districts these objections do not obtain. Great advantages      may result from visits paid to the poor; for there being,      unfortunately, much ignorance, generally, amongst them with      respect to all household knowledge, there will be opportunities      for advising and instructing them, in a pleasant and unobtrusive      manner, in cleanliness, industry, cookery, and good management.    15. IN MARKETING, THAT THE BEST ARTICLES ARE THE CHEAPEST, may be laid  down as a rule; and it is desirable, unless an experienced and  confidential housekeeper be kept, that the mistress should herself  purchase all provisions and stores needed for the house. If the mistress  be a young wife, and not accustomed to order \"things for the house,\" a  little practice and experience will soon teach her who are the best  tradespeople to deal with, and what are the best provisions to buy.  Under each particular head of FISH, MEAT, POULTRY, GAME, &c., will be  described the proper means of ascertaining the quality of these  comestibles.    16. A HOUSEKEEPING ACCOUNT-BOOK should invariably be kept, and kept  punctually and precisely. The plan for keeping household accounts, which  we should recommend, would be to make an entry, that is, write down into  a daily diary every amount paid on that particular day, be it ever so  small; then, at the end of the month, let these various payments be  ranged under their specific heads of Butcher, Baker, &c.; and thus will  be seen the proportions paid to each tradesman, and any one month's  expenses may be contrasted with another. The housekeeping accounts  should be balanced not less than once a month; so that you may see that  the money you have in hand tallies with your account of it in your  diary. Judge Haliburton never wrote truer words than when he said, \"No  man is rich whose expenditure exceeds his means, and no one is poor  whose incomings exceed his outgoings.\"        When, in a large establishment, a housekeeper is kept, it will      be advisable for the mistress to examine her accounts regularly.      Then any increase of expenditure which may be apparent, can      easily be explained, and the housekeeper will have the      satisfaction of knowing whether her efforts to manage her      department well and economically, have been successful.    17. ENGAGING DOMESTICS is one of those duties in which the judgment of  the mistress must be keenly exercised. There are some respectable  registry-offices, where good servants may sometimes be hired; but the  plan rather to be recommended is, for the mistress to make inquiry  amongst her circle of friends and acquaintances, and her tradespeople.  The latter generally know those in their neighbourhood, who are wanting  situations, and will communicate with them, when a personal interview  with some of them will enable the mistress to form some idea of the  characters of the applicants, and to suit herself accordingly.        We would here point out an error--and a grave one it is--into      which some mistresses fall. They do not, when engaging a      servant, expressly tell her all the duties which she will be      expected to perform. This is an act of omission severely to be      reprehended. Every portion of work which the maid will have to      do, should be plainly stated by the mistress, and understood by      the servant. If this plan is not carefully adhered to, domestic      contention is almost certain to ensue, and this may not be      easily settled; so that a change of servants, which is so much      to be deprecated, is continually occurring.    18. IN OBTAINING A SERVANT'S CHARACTER, it is not well to be guided by a  written one from some unknown quarter; but it is better to have an  interview, if at all possible, with the former mistress. By this means  you will be assisted in your decision of the suitableness of the servant  for your place, from the appearance of the lady and the state of her  house. Negligence and want of cleanliness in her and her household  generally, will naturally lead you to the conclusion, that her servant  has suffered from the influence of the bad example.        The proper course to pursue in order to obtain a personal      interview with the lady is this:--The servant in search of the      situation must be desired to see her former mistress, and ask      her to be kind enough to appoint a time, convenient to herself,      when you may call on her; this proper observance of courtesy      being necessary to prevent any unseasonable intrusion on the      part of a stranger. Your first questions should be relative to      the honesty and general morality of her former servant; and if      no objection is stated in that respect, her other qualifications      are then to be ascertained. Inquiries should be very minute, so      that you may avoid disappointment and trouble, by knowing the      weak points of your domestic.    19. THE TREATMENT OF SERVANTS is of the highest possible moment, as well  to the mistress as to the domestics themselves. On the head of the house  the latter will naturally fix their attention; and if they perceive that  the mistress's conduct is regulated by high and correct principles, they  will not fail to respect her. If, also, a benevolent desire is shown to  promote their comfort, at the same time that a steady performance of  their duty is exacted, then their respect will not be unmingled with  affection, and they will be still more solicitous to continue to deserve  her favour.    20. IN GIVING A CHARACTER, it is scarcely necessary to say that the  mistress should be guided by a sense of strict justice. It is not fair  for one lady to recommend to another, a servant she would not keep  herself. The benefit, too, to the servant herself is of small advantage;  for the failings which she possesses will increase if suffered to be  indulged with impunity. It is hardly necessary to remark, on the other  hand, that no angry feelings on the part of a mistress towards her late  servant, should ever be allowed, in the slightest degree, to influence  her, so far as to induce her to disparage her maid's character.    21. THE FOLLOWING TABLE OF THE AVERAGE YEARLY WAGES paid to domestics,  with the various members of the household placed in the order in which  they are usually ranked, will serve as a guide to regulate the  expenditure of an establishment:--                          When not found in          When found in                            Livery.

All the domestics mentioned in the above      table would enter into the establishment of a wealthy nobleman.      The number of servants, of course, would become smaller in      proportion to the lesser size of the establishment; and we may      here enumerate a scale of servants suited to various incomes,      commencing with--      About L1,000 a year--A cook, upper housemaid, nursemaid, under                  housemaid,         and a man servant.    About L750 a year--A cook, housemaid, nursemaid, and footboy.    About L500 a year--A cook, housemaid, and nursemaid.    About L300 a year--A maid-of-all-work and nursemaid.    About L200 or L150 a year--A maid-of-all-work (and girl occasionally).    22.
