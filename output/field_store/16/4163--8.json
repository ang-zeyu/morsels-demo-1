The next day the army having passed the Elbe at Wittenberg, and joined  the Saxon army near Torgau, his Majesty caused both armies to draw  up in battalia, giving every brigade the same post in the lines as he  purposed to fight in. I must do the memory of that glorious general  this honour, that I never saw an army drawn up with so much variety,  order, and exact regularity since, though I have seen many armies  drawn up by some of the greatest captains of the age. The order by  which his men were directed to flank and relieve one another, the  methods of receiving one body of men if disordered into another, and  rallying one squadron without disordering another was so admirable;  the horse everywhere flanked lined and defended by the foot, and the  foot by the horse, and both by the cannon, was such that if those  orders were but as punctually obeyed, 'twere impossible to put an army  so modelled into any confusion.    The view being over, and the troops returned to their camps, the  captain with whom we drank the day before meeting me told me I must  come and sup with him in his tent, where he would ask my pardon for  the affront he gave me before. I told him he needed not put himself  to the trouble, I was not affronted at all; that I would do myself the  honour to wait on him, provided he would give me his word not to speak  any more of it as an affront.    We had not been a quarter of an hour in his tent but Sir John Hepburn  came in again, and addressing to me, told me he was glad to find me  there; that he came to the captain's tent to inquire how to send to  me; and that I must do him the honour to go with him to wait on the  king, who had a mind to hear the account I could give him of the  Imperial army from my own mouth. I must confess I was at some loss in  my mind how to make my address to his Majesty, but I had heard so much  of the conversable temper of the king, and his particular sweetness of  humour with the meanest soldier, that I made no more difficulty, but  having paid my respects to Colonel Hepburn, thanked him for the honour  he had done me, and offered to rise and wait upon him. \"Nay,\" says  the Colonel, \"we will eat first, for I find Gourdon,\" which was the  captain's name, \"has got something for supper, and the king's order is  at seven o'clock.\" So we went to supper, and Sir John, becoming very  friendly, must know my name; which, when I had told him, and of what  place and family, he rose from his seat, and embracing me, told me he  knew my father very well, and had been intimately acquainted with  him, and told me several passages wherein my father had particularly  obliged him. After this we went to supper, and the king's health being  drank round, the colonel moved the sooner because he had a mind to  talk with me.    When we were going to the king he inquired of me where I had been, and  what occasion brought me to the army. I told him the short history of  my travels, and that I came hither from Vienna on purpose to see the  King of Sweden and his army. He asked me if there was any service he  could do me, by which he meant, whether I desired an employment.  I pretended not to take him so, but told him the protection his  acquaintance would afford me was more than I could have asked, since I  might thereby have opportunity to satisfy my curiosity, which was the  chief end of my coming abroad. He perceiving by this that I had no  mind to be a soldier, told me very kindly I should command him in  anything; that his tent and equipage, horses and servants should  always have orders to be at my service; but that as a piece of  friendship, he would advise me to retire to some place distant from  the army, for that the army would march to-morrow, and the king was  resolved to fight General Tilly, and he would not have me hazard  myself; that if I thought fit to take his advice, he would have me  take that interval to see the court at Berlin, whither he would send  one of his servants to wait on me.    His discourse was too kind not to extort the tenderest acknowledgment  from me that I was capable of. I told him his care of me was so  obliging, that I knew not what return to make him, but if he pleased  to leave me to my choice I desired no greater favour than to trail a  pike under his command in the ensuing battle. \"I can never answer it  to your father,\" says he, \"to suffer you to expose yourself so far.\"  I told him my father would certainly acknowledge his friendship in the  proposal made me; but I believed he knew him better than to think he  would be well pleased with me if I should accept of it; that I was  sure my father would have rode post five hundred miles to have been  at such a battle under such a general, and it should never be told  him that his son had rode fifty miles to be out of it. He seemed to  be something concerned at the resolution I had taken, and replied very  quickly upon me, that he approved very well of my courage; \"but,\" says  he, \"no man gets any credit by running upon needless adventures, nor  loses any by shunning hazards which he has no order for. 'Tis enough,\"  says he, \"for a gentleman to behave well when he is commanded upon any  service; I have had fighting enough,\" says he, \"upon these points  of honour, and I never got anything but reproof for it from the king  himself.\"    \"Well, sir,\" said I, \"however if a man expects to rise by his valour,  he must show it somewhere; and if I were to have any command in an  army, I would first try whether I could deserve it. I have never yet  seen any service, and must have my induction some time or other. I  shall never have a better schoolmaster than yourself, nor a better  school than such an army.\" \"Well,\" says Sir John, \"but you may have  the same school and the same teaching after this battle is over; for  I must tell you beforehand, this will be a bloody touch. Tilly has  a great army of old lads that are used to boxing, fellows with  iron faces, and 'tis a little too much to engage so hotly the first  entrance into the wars. You may see our discipline this winter, and  make your campaign with us next summer, when you need not fear but  we shall have fighting enough, and you will be better acquainted with  things. We do never put our common soldiers upon pitched battles the  first campaign, but place our new men in garrisons and try them in  parties first.\" \"Sir,\" said I, with a little more freedom, \"I believe  I shall not make a trade of the war, and therefore need not serve an  apprenticeship to it; 'tis a hard battle where none escapes. If I  come off, I hope I shall not disgrace you, and if not, 'twill be some  satisfaction to my father to hear his son died fighting under the  command of Sir John Hepburn, in the army of the King of Sweden, and I  desire no better epitaph upon my tomb.\"    \"Well,\" says Sir John, and by this time we were just come to the  king's quarters, and the guards calling to us interrupted his reply;  so we went into the courtyard where the king was lodged, which was in  an indifferent house of one of the burghers of Dieben, and Sir John  stepping up, met the king coming down some steps into a large room  which looked over the town wall into a field where part of the  artillery was drawn up. Sir John Hepburn sent his man presently to me  to come up, which I did; and Sir John without any ceremony carries me  directly up to the king, who was leaning on his elbow in the window.  The king turning about, \"This is the English gentleman,\" says Sir  John, \"who I told your Majesty had been in the Imperial army.\" \"How  then did he get hither,\" says the king, \"without being taken by the  scouts?\" At which question, Sir John saying nothing, \"By a pass,  and please your Majesty, from the English ambassador's secretary at  Vienna,\" said I, making a profound reverence. \"Have you then been at  Vienna?\" says the king. \"Yes, and please your Majesty,\" said I; upon  which the king, folding up a letter he had in his hand, seemed much  more earnest to talk about Vienna than about Tilly. \"And, pray, what  news had you at Vienna?\" \"Nothing, sir,\" said I, \"but daily accounts  one in the neck of another of their own misfortunes, and your  Majesty's conquests, which makes a very melancholy court there.\" \"But,  pray,\" said the king, \"what is the common opinion there about these  affairs?\" \"The common people are terrified to the last degree,\" said  I, \"and when your Majesty took Frankfort-upon-Oder, if your army had  marched but twenty miles into Silesia, half the people"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1226"],[0,"The Journal of Abnormal Psychology, Volume 10 (#12)"],[1,"  important books: \"Die Traumdeutung?\"  (First edition 1900, third edition  1912); \"Zur Psychopathologie des Alltagslebens\" (1901-1907); \"Der Witz und  seine Bedeutung zum Unbewussten\" (1905).    Because of the discovery of the repressed and the forbidden in the soul  life, the instructions contained in the three last-named works are of great  importance and of help to us in the study of the spontaneous ideas of the  patient brought to light by free association. But what is of more importance  for analysis is the study of what may well be termed Freud's masterpiece,  \"Die Traumdeutung.\"    Jung expresses himself as follows in regard to Freud's ingenious discovery.    \"It can be said of the dream that the stone which was despised by the  architect has become the corner-stone. The acorn of the dream, of the  ephemeral and inconsiderable product of our soul, dates from the earliest  times.  Before that, men saw in the dream a prophecy for the future, a  warning spirit, a comforter, a messenger of the gods. Now we join forces  with it in order to explore the subconscious, to unravel the mysteries which  it jealously guards and conceals. The dream does this with a completeness  which amazes us. Freud's exact analysis has taught that the dream as it  presents itself to us, exhibits merely a facade, which betrays nothing of  the inmost part of the house.  But where, by attention to certain rules we  are able to bring the dreamer to express the sudden ideas awakened in him in  talking over the sub-division of his dream, then it very quickly appears  that the sudden ideas follow a determined direction, and are centralized  about certain subjects, possessing a personal significance and betraying a  meaning, which in the beginning would not have been suspected back of the  dream, but which stand in a very close symbolical relation, even to details,  to the dream facade. This peculiar thought-complex, in which all the threads  of the dream are united, is the looked-for conflict in a certain variation  which is determined by the circumstances.  What is painful and contradictory  in the conflict is so confused here that one can speak of a  wish-fulfillment; let us, however, immediately add that the fulfilled wishes  apparently are not wishes, but are such as frequently are contradictory to  them. As an example let us use the case of a daughter who inwardly loves her  mother and dreams that the latter is dead, much to her sorrow. Dreams like  this are frequent.  The contents make us think as little as possible of a  wish-fulfillment, and so one might perhaps get the idea that Freud's  assertion--that the dream presents in dramatic form a subconscious wish of  the dreamer--is unjust.    That happens because the non-initiated does not know how to differentiate  between manifest and latent (evident and hidden) dream contents. Where the  conflict worked over in the dream is unconscious, the solution, the wish  arising from it, is also unconscious. In the chosen example, the dreamer  wished to have the mother out of the way; in the language of the  subconscious it says: I wish that mother would die.  We are aware that a  certain part of the subconscious possesses everything which we can no longer  remember consciously, and especially an entirely thoughtless, childish wish.  One can confidently say that most of what arises from the subconscious has  an infantile character, as does this so simple sounding wish: \"Tell me,  father, if mother died would you marry me?\"  The infantile expression of a  wish is the predecessor of a recent wish for marriage, which in this case we  discover is painful to the dreamer. This thought, the seriousness of the  included meaning is, as we say, \"repressed into the subconscious\" and can  there necessarily express itself only awkwardly and childishly, because the  subconscious limits the material at its disposal, preferably, to memories of  childhood and, as recent researches of the Zurich school have shown, to  \"Memories of the race,\" stretching far beyond the limits of the individual.    It is not the place here to explain by examples the territory of  dream-analysis so extraordinary composed; we must be satisfied with the  results of the study; dreams are a symbolical compensation for a personally  important wish of the daytime, one which had had too little attention (or  which had been repressed).    As a result of the dominant morals, wishes which are not sufficiently  noticed by our waking consciousness and which attempt to realize themselves  symbolically in the dream are as a rule of an erotic nature. Therefore it is  advisable not to tell individual dreams in the presence of the initiated,  because dream symbolism is transparent to one acquainted with its  fundamental rules.  Therefore we have always to conquer in ourselves a  certain resistance before we seriously can be fitted for the task of  unraveling the symbolical composition by patient work. When we finally  comprehend the true meaning of a dream then we at once find ourselves  transposed into the very midst of the secrets of the dreamer and to our  amazement we see that even an apparently meaningless dream is full of sense  and really bears witness of extremely important and serious things  concerning the soul-life. This knowledge obliges us to have more respect for  the old superstition concerning the meaning of dreams, a respect which is  far to seek in our present-day rationalistic era.    Freud correctly terms dream-analysis the royal road which leads to the  subconscious; it leads us into the most deeply hidden personal mysteries  and, therefore, in the hand of the physician and the educator is an  instrument not to be too highly valued.    The opposition to this method makes use of arguments which chiefly (as we  will observe, from personal motives) originate in the still strongly  scholastic bent, which the learned thought of the present-day exhibits. And  dream-analysis is precisely what inexorably lays bare the lying morals and  the hypocritical pose of men, and now for once makes them see the reverse  side of their character.  Is it to be wondered at that many therefore feel  as if some one were stepping on their toes?    Dream-analysis always makes me think of the striking statue of worldly  pleasure which stands before the cathedral at Basel.  The front presents an  archaic sweet smile, but the back is covered with toads and snakes.  Dream-analysis reverses things and allows the back side to be seen. That  this correct picture of reality possesses an ethical value is what no one  can contradict.  It is a painful but very useful operation, which demands a  great deal from the physician as well as from the patient. Psychoanalysis  seen from the standpoint of therapeutic technic consists chiefly of numerous  analyses of dreams; these in the course of treatment, little by little,  bring what is evil out of the subconsciousness to the light and submit it to  the disinfecting light of day, and thereby find again many valuable and  pretendedly lost portions of the past. It represents a cathartic of especial  worth, which has a similarity to the Socratic \"maieutike,\" the \"obstetric.\"  From this state of affairs one can only expect that psychoanalysis for many  people who have taken a certain pose, in which they firmly believe, is a  real torture, because according to the ancient mystic saying: \"Give what you  have, then shall you receive!\"  They must of their own free will offer as a  price their beloved illusions if they wish to allow something deeper, more  beautiful and more vast to enrich them. Only through the mystery of  self-sacrifice does the self succeed in finding itself again renewed.    There are proverbs of very old origin which through the psychoanalytical  treatment again come to light.  It is surely very remarkable that at the  height to which our present-day culture has attained this particular kind of  psychic education seems necessary, an education which may be compared in  more than one respect with the technic of Socrates, although psychoanalysis  goes much deeper.    We always discover in the patient a conflict which at a certain point is  connected with the great social problems, and when the analysis has  penetrated to that point, the seemingly individual conflict of the patient  is disclosed as the conflict, common to his environment and his time.    Thus the neurosis is really nothing but an individual (unsuccessful to be  sure) attempt to solve a common problem It must be so, because a common  problem, a \"Question\" which plunges the sick man into misery is--I can't  help it--\"the sexual question,\" more properly termed the question of the  present-day sexual moral.    His increased claim upon life and the joy of life, upon colored, brilliant  reality, must endure the inevitable limitations, placed by reality, but not  the arbitrary, wrong, indefensable limitations which put too many chains  upon the creative spirit mounting from out the depths of animal darkness.  The nervous sufferer possesses the soul of a child, that arbitrary  limitation which represses and the reason for which is not understood. To be  sure it attempts to identify itself with the morals, but by this it is  brought into great conflict and disharmony with itself. On one side it  wishes to submit, on the other to free itself--and this conflict we speak of  as the neurosis.    If this conflict in all its parts were clearly a conscious one, then  naturally no nervous phenomena would arise from it. These phenomena arise  only when man cannot see the reverse side of his being and the urgency of  his problem. Only under these circumstances does the phenomena occur which  allows expression to the non-conscious side of the soul.    The symptom is thus an indirect expression of the nonconscious wishes,  which, were they conscious to us, would come into a violent conflict with  our conceptions of morals.
