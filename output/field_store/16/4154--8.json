Francis I., in the name of the crown, and in  respect of the constable's other possessions, joined his claims to those  of his mother.  Thus the lawsuit with which the duke was threatened  affected him in every part of his fortune.  It was in vain that more or  less direct overtures, on behalf of Madame Louise and of the king  himself, were made to induce him to accept the bargain offered: his  refusal was expressed and given with an open contempt that verged upon  coarseness.  \"I will never,\" said he, \"marry a woman devoid of modesty.\"    The lawsuit was begun and prosecuted with all the hatred of a great lady  treated with contempt, and with all the knowingness of an unscrupulous  lawyer eager to serve, in point of fact, his patroness, and to  demonstrate, in point of law, the thesis he had advanced.  Francis I.,  volatile, reckless, and ever helpless as he was against the passions of  his mother, who whilst she adored, beguiled him, readily lent himself to  the humiliation of a vassal who was almost his rival in puissance, and  certainly was in glory.  Three lawyers of renown entered upon the  struggle.  Poyet maintained the pretensions of the queen-mother; Lizet  developed Duprat's argument in favor of the king's claims; Montholon  defended the constable.  The Parliament granted several adjournments,  and the question was in suspense for eleven months.  At last, in August,  1523, the court interest was triumphant; Parliament, to get rid of direct  responsibility, referred the parties, as to the basis of the question, to  the king's council; but it placed all the constable's possessions under  sequestration, withdrawing the enjoyment of them wholly from him.  A few  years afterwards Poyet became chancellor, and Lizet premier-president of  Parliament.  \"Worth alone,\" say the historians, \"carved out for Montholon  at a later period the road to the office of keeper of the seals.\"    The constable's fall and ruin were complete.  He at an early stage had a  presentiment that such would be the issue of his lawsuit, and sought for  safeguards away from France.  The affair was causing great stir in  Europe.  Was it, however, Charles V. who made the first overtures as the  most efficient supporter the constable could have?  Or was it the  constable himself who, profiting by the relations he had established  after the capture of Hesdin with the Croys, persons of influence with the  emperor, made use of them for getting into direct communication with  Charles V., and made offer of his services in exchange for protection  against his own king and his own country?  In such circumstances and in  the case of such men the sources of crime are always surrounded with  obscurity.  One is inclined to believe that Charles V., vigilant and  active as he was, put out the first feelers.  As soon as he heard that  Bourbon was a widower, he gave instructions to Philibert Naturelli, his  ambassador in France, who said, \"Sir, you are now in a position to marry,  and the emperor, my master, who is very fond of you, has a sister  touching whom I have orders to speak to you if you will be pleased to  hearken.\"  It was to Charles V.'s eldest sister, Eleanor, widow of Manuel  the Fortunate, King of Portugal, that allusion was made.  This overture  led to nothing at the time; but the next year, in 1522, war was declared  between Francis I. and Charles V.; the rupture between Francis I. and the  Duke of Bourbon took place; the Bourbon lawsuit was begun; and the duke's  mother-in-law, Anne of France, daughter of Louis XI., more concerned for  the fate of her House than for that of her country, and feeling herself  near her end, said one day to her son-in-law, \"My son, reflect that the  House of Bourbon made alliance with the House of Burgundy, and that  during that alliance it always prospered.  You see at the present moment  what is the state of our affairs, and the lawsuit in which you are  involved is proceeded with only for want of alliances.  I do beg and  command you to accept the emperor's alliance.  Promise me to use thereto  all the diligence you can, and I shall die more easy.\"  She died on the  14th of November, 1522, bequeathing all her possessions to the constable,  who was day by day more disposed to follow her counsels.  In the summer  of 1522, he had, through the agency of Adrian de Croy, Lord of Beaurain,  entered into negotiations not only with Charles V., but also with Henry  VIII., King of England, deploring the ill behavior of Francis I. and the  enormity of existing abuses, and proposing to set on foot in his own  possessions a powerful movement for the reformation of the kingdom and  the relief of the poor people, if the two sovereigns would send \"persons  of trust and authority into the vicinity of his principality of Dombes,  to Bourg-en-Bresse, whither he on his side would send his chancellor to  come to an agreement with them and act in common.\"  In the month of  March, 1523, whilst the foreign negotiations thus commenced and the  home-process against the constable were pursuing a parallel course,  Bourbon one day paid a visit to Queen Claude of France at the hour when  she was dining alone.  She was favorably disposed towards him, and would  have liked to get him married to her sister Renee, who subsequently  became Duchess of Ferrara.  She made him sit down.  Francis I., who was  at dinner in an adjacent room, came in.  Bourbon rose to take leave.  \"Nay, keep your seat,\" said the king; \"and so it is true that you are  going to be married?\"  \"Not at all, sir.\"  \"O, but I know it; I am sure  of it; I know of your dealings with the emperor.  And bear well in mind  what I have to say to you on the subject.\"  \"Sir! is this a threat, pray?  I have not deserved such treatment.\"  After dinner he departed and went  back to his hotel hard by the Louvre; and many gentlemen who happened to  be at court accompanied him by way of escort.  He was as yet a powerful  vassal, who was considered to be unjustly persecuted.    Charles V. accepted eagerly the overtures made to him by Bourbon in  response to his own; but, before engaging in action, he wished to be  certified about the disposition of Henry VIII., King of England, and he  sent Beaurain to England to take accurate soundings.  Henry at first  showed hesitation. When, Beaurain set before him all the advantages that  would accrue to their coalition from the Duke of Bourbon's alliance: \"And  I,\" said the king, brusquely, \"what, pray, shall I get?\" \"Sir,\" answered  Beaurain, \"you will be King of France.\"  \"Ah!\" rejoined Henry, \"it will  take a great deal to make M. de Bourbon obey me.\"  Henry remembered the  cold and proud bearing which the constable had maintained towards him at  the Field of Cloth of Gold.  He, nevertheless, engaged to supply half the  expenses and a body of troops for the projected invasion of France.  Charles V.  immediately despatched Beaurain to the Duke of Bourbon, who  had removed to Montbrison, in the most mountainous part of his domains,  on pretext of a pilgrimage to Notre-Dame du Puy.  Beaurain was conducted  thither, in great secrecy, on the 17th July, 1523, by two of the duke's  gentlemen, and passed two days there shut up in a room adjoining the  constable's apartment, never emerging save at night to transact business  with him.  On the 18th of July, in the evening, he put into Bourbon's  hands his letters of credit, running thus: \"My dear cousin, I send to you  Sieur de Beaurain, my second chamberlain.  I pray you to consider him as  myself, and, so doing, you will find me ever your good cousin and  friend.\"  The negotiation was speedy.  Many historians have said that it  was confined to verbal conventions, and that there was nothing in writing  between the two contracting parties.  That is a mistake.  A treaty was  drawn up in brief terms by Beaurain's secretary, and two copies were  made, of which one was to be taken to Charles V.  and the other to be  left with the Duke of Bourbon.  It stipulated the mutual obligations of  the three contracting parties in their offensive and defensive league.  Bourbon engaged to attack Francis I. but he would not promise to  acknowledge Henry VIII. as King of France.  \"I am quite willing to be his  ally,\" he said, \"but his subject, his vassal, no!  All I can do is to  leave myself, as to my relations towards him, in the emperor's hands.\"  A strange and noble relic of patriotism in that violent and haughty soul,  more concerned for its rights than its duties, and driven to extremity by  the acts of ungrateful and unthoughtful injustice, to which the great  lord and the valiant warrior had been subjected.  The treaty having been  signed with this reservation, Bourbon sent, about midnight, for  Saint-Bonnet, Lord of Branon, whom he intended to despatch to Charles  V., and, after having sworn him, \"I send you,\" said he, \"to the emperor,  to whom you will say that I commend myself humbly to his good graces,  that I beg him to give me his sister in marriage, and that, doing me  this honor, he will find me his servant, his good brother, and friend.\"    The fatal step was taken.  Bourbon was now engaged in revolt against his  king and his country, as well as in falsehood and treason--preliminary  conditions of such a course.  He needed tools and accomplices; and though  he had a numerous and devoted following, he could not feel sure of them  all for such a purpose.  The very day after the conclusion of his treaty  with Charles V., one of his most intimate and important confidants, John  of Poitiers, Lord of St. Vallier, who was present at Montbrison during  the negotiation of the treaty, said to him in the morning, \"Sir, it was  your wish; I heard all; and I spent the whole night thinking about it;  tell me, I pray you, do you feel sure of your friend?\"  \"I was not more  fond of the brother I lost at Melegnano,\" said the constable; \"I should  not have felt more sure of him.\"  \"Well, then,\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11956"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 6 (#12)"],[1," mind; partly from  compassion, partly from shameful cupidity, all the courtiers set  themselves to work to obtain grace for the prosecuted financiers.  The  finest ladies sold their protection with brazen faces; the Regent, who  had sworn to show no favor to anybody, yielded to the solicitations of  his friends, to the great disgust of M. Rouille-Ducoudray, member of the  council of finance, who directed the operations of the Chamber of Justice  with the same stern frankness which had made him not long before say to a  body of tax-farmers (_traitants_) who wanted to put at his disposal a  certain number of shares in their enterprise, \"And suppose I were to go  shares with you, how could I have you hanged, in case you were rogues?\"  Nobody was really hanged, although torture and the penalty of death had  been set down in the list of punishments to which the guilty were liable;  out of four thousand five hundred amenable cases, nearly three thousand  had been exempted from the tax.  \"The corruption is so wide-spread,\" says  the preamble to the edict of March, 1727, which suppressed the Chamber of  Justice, \"that nearly all conditions have been infected by it in such  sort that the most righteous severities could not be employed to punish  so great a number of culprits without causing a dangerous interruption to  commerce, and a kind of general shock in the system of the state.\"  The  resources derived from the punishment of the tax-farmers (_traitants_),  as well as from the revision of the state's debts, thus remaining very  much below expectation, the deficit went on continually increasing.  In  order to re-establish the finances, the Duke of Noailles demanded fifteen  years' impracticable economy, as chimerical as the increment of the  revenues on which he calculated; and the Duke of Orleans finally suffered  himself to bo led away by the brilliant prospect which was flashed before  his eyes by the Scotsman, Law, who had now for more than two years been  settled in France.    [Illustration: John Law----62]    Law, born at Edinburgh, in 1611, son of a goldsmith, had for a long time  been scouring Europe, seeking in a clever and systematic course of  gambling a source of fortune for himself, and the first foundation of the  great enterprises he was revolving in his singularly inventive and daring  mind.  Passionately devoted to the financial theories he had conceived,  Law had expounded them to all the princes of Europe in succession.  \"He  says that of all the persons to whom he has spoken about his system, he  has found but two who apprehended it, to wit, the King of Sicily and my  son,\" wrote Madame, the Regent's mother.  Victor Amadeo, however, had  rejected Law's proposals.  \"I am not powerful enough to ruin myself,\" he  had said.  Law had not been more successful with Louis XIV.  The Regent  had not the same repugnance for novelties of foreign origin; so soon as  he was in power, he authorized the Scot to found a circulating and  discount bank (_banque de circulation et d'escompte_), which at once had  very great success, and did real service.  Encouraged by this first step,  Law reiterated to the Regent that the credit of bankers and merchants  decupled their capital; if the state became the universal banker, and  centralized all the values in circulation, the public fortune would  naturally be decupled.  A radically false system, fated to plunge the  state, and consequently the whole nation, into the risks of speculation  and trading, without the guarantee of that activity, zeal, and prompt  resolution which able men of business can import into their private  enterprises.  The system was not as yet applied; the discreet routine of  the French financiers was scared at such risky chances, the pride of the  great lords sitting in the council was shocked at the idea of seeing the  state turning banker, perhaps even trader.  St. Simon maintained that  what was well enough for a free state, could not take place under an  absolute government.  Law went on, however; to his bank he had just added  a great company.  The king ceded to him Louisiana, which was said to be  rich in gold and silver mines, superior to those of Mexico and Peru.  People vaunted the fertility of the soil, the facility offered for trade  by the extensive and rapid stream of the Mississippi; it was by the name  of that river that the new company was called at first, though it soon  took the title of _Compagnie d' Occident,_ when it had obtained the  privilege of trading in Senegal and in Guinea; it became the _Compagnie  des Indes,_ on forming a fusion with the old enterprises which worked the  trade of the East.  For the generality, and in the current phraseology,  it remained the Mississippi; and that is the name it has left in history.  New Orleans was beginning to arise at the mouth of that river.  Law had  bought Belle-Isle-en-Mer and was constructing the port of Lorient.    The Regent's councillors were scared and disquieted; the chancellor  proclaimed himself loudly against the deception or illusion which made of  Louisiana a land of promise; he called to mind that Crozat had been  ruined in searching for mines of the precious metals there.  \"The worst  of him was his virtue,\" said Duclos.  The Regent made a last effort to  convert him, as well as the Duke of Noailles, to the projects of Law.  It was at a small house in the faubourg St. Antoine, called La Roquette,  belonging to the last named, that the four interlocutors discussed the  new system thoroughly.  \"With the use of very sensible language Law had  the gift of explaining himself so clearly and intelligibly that he left  nothing to desire as concerned making himself comprehended.  The Duke of  Orleans liked him and relished him.  He regarded him and all he did as  work of his own creation.  He liked, moreover, extraordinary and  out-of-the-way methods, and he embraced them the more readily in that he  saw the resources which had become so necessary for the state and all the  ordinary operations of finance vanishing away.  This liking of the  Regent's wounded Noailles, as being adopted at his expense.  He wanted to  be sole master in the matter of finance, and all the eloquence of Law  could not succeed in convincing him.\"  The chancellor stood firm; the  Parliament, which ever remained identified in his mind with his country,  was in the same way opposed to Law.  The latter declared that the  obstacles which arrested him at every step through the ill will of the  Council and of the magistrates, were ruining all the fruits of his  system.  The representations addressed by the Parliament to the king, on  the 20th of January, touching a re-coinage of all moneys, which had been  suggested by Law, dealt the last blow at the chancellor's already  tottering favor.  On the morning of the 23d M. de La Vrilliere went to  him on behalf of the Regent and demanded the return of the seals.  D'Aguesseau was a little affected and surprised.  \"Monseigneur,\" he wrote  to the Duke of Orleans, \"you gave me the seals without any merit on my  part, you take them away without any demerit.\"  He had received orders to  withdraw to his estate at Fresnes; the Regent found his mere presence  irksome.  D'Aguesseau set out at once.  \"He had taken his elevation like  a sage,\" says St. Simon, \"and it was as a sage too that he fell.\"  \"The  important point,\" wrote the disgraced magistrate to his son, \"is to be  well with one's self.\"    The Duke of Noailles had resigned his presidency of the council of  finance; but, ever adroit, even in disgrace, he had managed to secure  himself a place in the council of regency.  The seals were intrusted to  M. d'Argenson, for some years past chief of police at Paris.  \"With a  forbidding face, which reminded one of the three judges of Hades, he made  fun out of everything with excellence of wit, and he had established such  order amongst that innumerable multitude of Paris, that there was no  single inhabitant of whose conduct and habits he was not cognizant from  day to day, with exquisite discernment in bringing a heavy or light hand  to bear on every matter that presented itself, ever leaning towards the  gentler side, with the art of making the most innocent tremble before  him.\"  [St. Simon, t. xv.  p. 387.]  Courageous, bold, audacious in  facing riots, and thereby master of the people, he was at the same time  endowed with prodigious activity.  \"He was seen commencing his audiences  at three in the morning, dictating to four secretaries at once on various  subjects, and making his rounds at night whilst working in his carriage  at a desk lighted with wax candles.  For the rest, without any dread of  Parliament, which had often attacked him, he was in his nature royal and  fiscal; he cut knots, he was a foe to lengthiness, to useless forms or  such as might be skipped, to neutral or wavering conditions.\"  [Lemontey,  _Histoire de la Regence,_ t. i.  p. 77.]  The Regent considered that he  had secured to himself an effective instrument of his views; acceptance  of the system had been the condition _sine qua non_ of M. d'Argenson's  elevation.    He, however, like his predecessors, attempted before long to hamper the  march of the audacious foreigner; but the die had been cast, and the Duke  of Orleans outstripped Law himself in the application of his theories.  A company, formed secretly, and protected by the new keeper of the seals,  had bought up the general farmings (_fermes generales_), that is to say,  all the indirect taxes, for the sum of forty-eight million fifty-two  thousand livres; the _Compagnie des Indes_ re-purchased them for fifty-  two millions; the general receipts were likewise conceded to it, and  Law's bank was proclaimed a Royal Bank; the company's shares already  amounted to the supposed value of all the coin circulating in the  kingdom, estimated at seven or eight millions.  Law thought he might risk  everything in the intoxication which"]]]
