It would be near the  top, farthest from the friendly kitchen, that the attack might come, for  there the stairs yielded to the darkness of the attic. There it was best  to look sharp and to turn the corners wide. A brave whistling kept out the  other noises.    It was after Aladdin had been in town that the fires burned hottest in us.  My grandfather and I went together to the matinee, his great thumb within  my fist. We were frequent companions. Together we had sat on benches in the  park and poked the gravel into patterns. We went to Dime Museums. Although  his eyes had looked longer on the world than mine, we seemed of an equal  age.    The theatre was empty as we entered. We carried a bag of candy against a  sudden appetite--colt's foot, a penny to the stick. Here and there ushers  were clapping down the seats, sounds to my fancy not unlike the first corn  within a popper. Somewhere aloft there must have been a roof, else the day  would have spied in on us, yet it was lost in the gloom. It was as though  a thrifty owner had borrowed the dusky fabrics of the night to make his  cover. The curtain was indistinct, but we knew it to be the Stratford  Church and we dimly saw its spire.    Now, on the opening of a door to the upper gallery, there was a scampering  to get seats in front, speed being whetted by a long half hour of waiting  on the stairs. Ghostly, unbodied heads, like the luminous souls of lost  mountaineers--for this was the kind of fiction, got out of the Public  Library, that had come last beneath my thumb--ghostly heads looked down  upon us across the gallery rail.    And now, if you will tip back your head like a paper-hanger--whose Adam's  apple would seem to attest a life of sidereal contemplation--you will see  in the center of the murk above you a single point of light. It is the  spark that will ignite the great gas chandelier. I strain my neck to the  point of breaking. My grandfather strains his too, for it is a game between  us which shall announce the first spurting of the light. At last! We cry  out together. The spark catches the vent next to it. It runs around the  circle of glass pendants. The whole blazes up. The mountaineers come to  life. They lean forward on their elbows.    From the wings comes the tuning of the violins. A flute ripples up and down  in a care-free manner as though the villain Kazrac were already dead and  virtue had come into its own. The orchestra emerges from below. Their  calmness is but a pretense. Having looked on such sights as lie behind the  curtain, having trod such ways, they should be bubbling with excitement.  Yet observe the bass viol! How sodden is his eye! How sunken is his gaze!  With what dull routine he draws his bow, as though he knew naught but  sleepy tunes! If there be any genie in the place, as the program says, let  him first stir this sad fellow from his melancholy!    We consult our programs. The first scene is the magician's cave where he  plans his evil schemes. The second is the Chinese city where he pretends to  be Aladdin's uncle. And for myself, did a friendly old gentleman offer me  lollypops and all-day-suckers--for so did the glittering baubles present  themselves across the footlights--like Aladdin I, too, would not have  squinted too closely on his claim. Gladly I would have gone off with him on  an all-day picnic toward the Chinese mountains.    We see a lonely pass in the hills, the cave of jewels (splendid to the eye  of childhood) where the slave of the lamp first appears, and finally the  throne-room with Aladdin seated safely beside his princess.    Who knows how to dip a pen within the twilight? Who shall trace the figures  of the mist? The play is done. We come out in silence. Our candy is but a  remnant. Darkness has fallen. The pavements are wet and shining, so that  the night might see his face, if by chance the old fellow looked our way.    All about there are persons hurrying home with dinner-pails, who, by their  dull eyes, seem never to have heard what wonders follow on the rubbing of a  lamp.    But how the fires leaped up--how ambition beat within us--how our attic  theatre was wrought to perfection--how the play came off and wracked the  neighborhood of its pins--with what grace I myself acted Aladdin--these  things must be written by a vain and braggart pen.          Mr. Pepys Sits in the Pit      When it happens that a man has risen to be a member of Parliament, the  Secretary of the British Navy and the President of the Royal Society, when  he has become the adviser of the King and is moreover the one really bright  spot in that King's reign, it is amazing that considerably more than one  hundred years after his death, when the navy that he nurtured dominates the  seven seas, that he himself on a sudden should be known, not for his larger  accomplishments, but as a kind of tavern crony and pot-companion. When he  should be standing with fame secure in a solemn though dusty niche in the  Temple of Time, it is amazing that he should be remembered chiefly for  certain quarrels with his wife and as a frequenter of plays and summer  gardens.    Yet this is the fate of Samuel Pepys. Before the return of the Stuarts he  held a poor clerkship in the Navy Office and cut his quill obscurely at  the common desk. At the Restoration, partly by the boost of influence, but  chiefly by his substantial merit, he mounted to several successively higher  posts. The Prince of Wales became his friend and patron and when he became  Lord High Admiral he took Pepys with him in his advancement. Thus in 1684,  Pepys became Secretary of the Navy. When later the Prince of Wales became  King James II, Pepys, although his office remained the same, came to quite  a pinnacle of administrative power. He was shrewd and capable in the  conduct of his position and brought method to the Navy Office. He was a  prime factor in the first development of the British Navy. Later victories  that were to sweep the seas may be traced in part to him. Nelson rides upon  his shoulders. These achievements should have made his fame secure. But  on a sudden he gained for posterity a less dignified although a more  interesting and enduring renown.    In life, Samuel Pepys walked gravely in majestical robe with full-bottomed  wig and with ceremonial lace flapping at his wrists. Every step, if his  portrait is to be believed, was a bit of pageantry. Such was his fame, that  if his sword but clacked a warning on the pavement, it must have brought  the apprentices to the windows. Tradesmen laid down their wares to get a  look at him. Fat men puffed and strained to gain the advantage of a sill.  Fashionable ladies peeped from brocaded curtains and ogled for his regard.  Or if he went by chair, the carriers held their noses up as though offended  by the common air. When he spoke before the Commons, the galleries were  hushed. He gave his days to the signing of stiff parchments--Admiralty  Orders or what not. He checked the King himself at the council table. In  short, he was not only a great personage, but also he was quite well aware  of the fact and held himself accordingly.    But now many years have passed, and Time, that has so long been at bowls  with reputations, has acquired a moderate skill in knocking them down. Let  us see how it fares with Pepys! Some men who have been roguish in their  lives have been remembered by their higher accomplishments. A string  of sonnets or a novel or two, if it catches the fancy, has wiped out a  tap-room record. The winning of a battle has obliterated a meanly spent  youth. It is true that for a while an old housewife who once lived on the  hero's street will shake a dubious finger on his early pranks. Stolen  apples or cigarettes behind the barn cram her recollection. But even a  village reputation fades. In time the sonnets and glorious battle have the  upper place. But things went the other way with Pepys. Rather, his fate  is like that of Zeus, who--if legend is to be trusted--was in his life a  person of some importance whose nod stirred society on Olympus, but who is  now remembered largely for his flirtations and his braggart conduct. A not  unlike evil has fallen on the magnificent Mr. Pepys.    This fate came to him because--as the world knows--it happened that for  a period of ten years in comparative youth, he wrote an interesting and  honest diary. He began this diary in 1659, while he was still a poor clerk  living with his wife in a garret, and ended it in 1669, when, although he  had emerged from obscurity, his greater honors had not yet been set on him.  All the facts of his life during this period are put down, whether good or  bad, small or large, generous or mean. He writes of his mornings spent in  work at his office, of his consultations with higher officials. There  is much running to and fro of business. The Dutch war bulks to a proper  length. Parliament sits through a page at a stretch. Pepys goes upon the  streets in the days of the plague and writes the horror of it--the houses  marked with red crosses and with prayers scratched beneath--the stench and  the carrying of dead bodies. He sees the great fire of London from his  window on the night it starts; afterwards St. Paul's with its roofs fallen.  He is on the fleet that brings Charles home from his long travels, and  afterwards when Charles is crowned, he records the processions and the  crowds. But also Pepys quarrels with his wife and writes it out on paper.  He debauches a servant and makes a note of it. He describes a supper at an  ale-house, and how he plays on the flute. He sings \"Beauty Retire,\" a song  of his own making, and tells how his listeners \"cried it up.\"    In consequence of this, Samuel Pepys is now known chiefly for his  attentions to the pretty actresses of Drury Lane, for kissing Nell Gwynne  in her tiring-room, for his suppers with \"the"]]]
