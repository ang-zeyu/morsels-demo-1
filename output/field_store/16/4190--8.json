Epistle To J. Lapraik, An Old Scottish Bard         April 1, 1785         While briers an' woodbines budding green,       An' paitricks scraichin loud at e'en,       An' morning poussie whiddin seen,       Inspire my muse,       This freedom, in an unknown frien',       I pray excuse.         On Fasten--e'en we had a rockin,       To ca' the crack and weave our stockin;       And there was muckle fun and jokin,       Ye need na doubt;       At length we had a hearty yokin       At sang about.         There was ae sang, amang the rest,       Aboon them a' it pleas'd me best,       That some kind husband had addrest       To some sweet wife;       It thirl'd the heart-strings thro' the breast,       A' to the life.         I've scarce heard ought describ'd sae weel,       What gen'rous, manly bosoms feel;       Thought I \"Can this be Pope, or Steele,       Or Beattie's wark?\"       They tauld me 'twas an odd kind chiel       About Muirkirk.         It pat me fidgin-fain to hear't,       An' sae about him there I speir't;       Then a' that kent him round declar'd       He had ingine;       That nane excell'd it, few cam near't,       It was sae fine:         That, set him to a pint of ale,       An' either douce or merry tale,       Or rhymes an' sangs he'd made himsel,       Or witty catches--       'Tween Inverness an' Teviotdale,       He had few matches.         Then up I gat, an' swoor an aith,       Tho' I should pawn my pleugh an' graith,       Or die a cadger pownie's death,       At some dyke-back,       A pint an' gill I'd gie them baith,       To hear your crack.         But, first an' foremost, I should tell,       Amaist as soon as I could spell,       I to the crambo-jingle fell;       Tho' rude an' rough--       Yet crooning to a body's sel'       Does weel eneugh.         I am nae poet, in a sense;       But just a rhymer like by chance,       An' hae to learning nae pretence;       Yet, what the matter?       Whene'er my muse does on me glance,       I jingle at her.         Your critic-folk may cock their nose,       And say, \"How can you e'er propose,       You wha ken hardly verse frae prose,       To mak a sang?\"       But, by your leaves, my learned foes,       Ye're maybe wrang.         What's a' your jargon o' your schools--       Your Latin names for horns an' stools?       If honest Nature made you fools,       What sairs your grammars?       Ye'd better taen up spades and shools,       Or knappin-hammers.         A set o' dull, conceited hashes       Confuse their brains in college classes!       They gang in stirks, and come out asses,       Plain truth to speak;       An' syne they think to climb Parnassus       By dint o' Greek!         Gie me ae spark o' nature's fire,       That's a' the learning I desire;       Then tho' I drudge thro' dub an' mire       At pleugh or cart,       My muse, tho' hamely in attire,       May touch the heart.         O for a spunk o' Allan's glee,       Or Fergusson's the bauld an' slee,       Or bright Lapraik's, my friend to be,       If I can hit it!       That would be lear eneugh for me,       If I could get it.         Now, sir, if ye hae friends enow,       Tho' real friends, I b'lieve, are few;       Yet, if your catalogue be fu',       I'se no insist:       But, gif ye want ae friend that's true,       I'm on your list.         I winna blaw about mysel,       As ill I like my fauts to tell;       But friends, an' folk that wish me well,       They sometimes roose me;       Tho' I maun own, as mony still       As far abuse me.         There's ae wee faut they whiles lay to me,       I like the lasses--Gude forgie me!       For mony a plack they wheedle frae me       At dance or fair;       Maybe some ither thing they gie me,       They weel can spare.         But Mauchline Race, or Mauchline Fair,       I should be proud to meet you there;       We'se gie ae night's discharge to care,       If we forgather;       An' hae a swap o' rhymin-ware       Wi' ane anither.         The four-gill chap, we'se gar him clatter,       An' kirsen him wi' reekin water;       Syne we'll sit down an' tak our whitter,       To cheer our heart;       An' faith, we'se be acquainted better       Before we part.         Awa ye selfish, war'ly race,       Wha think that havins, sense, an' grace,       Ev'n love an' friendship should give place       To catch--the--plack!       I dinna like to see your face,       Nor hear your crack.         But ye whom social pleasure charms       Whose hearts the tide of kindness warms,       Who hold your being on the terms,       \"Each aid the others,\"       Come to my bowl, come to my arms,       My friends, my brothers!         But, to conclude my lang epistle,       As my auld pen's worn to the gristle,       Twa lines frae you wad gar me fissle,       Who am, most fervent,       While I can either sing or whistle,       Your friend and servant.          Second Epistle To J. Lapraik         April 21, 1785         While new-ca'd kye rowte at the stake       An' pownies reek in pleugh or braik,       This hour on e'enin's edge I take,       To own I'm debtor       To honest-hearted, auld Lapraik,       For his kind letter.         Forjesket sair, with weary legs,       Rattlin the corn out-owre the rigs,       Or dealing thro' amang the naigs       Their ten-hours' bite,       My awkart Muse sair pleads and begs       I would na write.

And some folks claim that seven is a lucky number; there were  seven boys in our family and nary one ever married.\"    \"That experience of Fox's,\" remarked Honeyman, after a short silence,  \"is almost similar to one I had. Before Lovell and Flood adopted me, I  worked for a horse man down on the Nueces. Every year he drove up the  trail a large herd of horse stock. We drove to the same point on the  trail each year, and I happened to get acquainted up there with a  family that had several girls in it. The youngest girl in the family  and I seemed to understand each other fairly well. I had to stay at  the horse camp most of the time, and in one way and another did not  get to see her as much as I would have liked. When we sold out the  herd, I hung around for a week or so, and spent a month's wages  showing her the cloud with the silver lining. She stood it all easy,  too. When the outfit went home, of course I went with them. I was  banking plenty strong, however, that next year, if there was a good  market in horses, I'd take her home with me. I had saved my wages and  rustled around, and when we started up the trail next year, I had  forty horses of my own in the herd. I had figured they would bring me  a thousand dollars, and there was my wages besides.    \"When we reached this place, we held the herd out twenty miles, so it  was some time before I got into town to see the girl. But the first  time I did get to see her I learned that an older sister of hers, who  had run away with some renegade from Texas a year or so before, had  drifted back home lately with tears in her eyes and a big fat baby boy  in her arms. She warned me to keep away from the house, for men from  Texas were at a slight discount right then in that family. The girl  seemed to regret it and talked reasonable, and I thought I could see  encouragement. I didn't crowd matters, nor did her folks forget me  when they heard that Byler had come in with a horse herd from the  Nueces. I met the girl away from home several times during the summer,  and learned that they kept hot water on tap to scald me if I ever  dared to show up. One son-in-law from Texas had simply surfeited that  family--there was no other vacancy. About the time we closed out and  were again ready to go home, there was a cattleman's ball given in  this little trail town. We stayed over several days to take in this  ball, as I had some plans of my own. My girl was at the ball all easy  enough, but she warned me that her brother was watching me. I paid no  attention to him, and danced with her right along, begging her to run  away with me. It was obviously the only play to make. But the more I'd  'suade her the more she'd 'fuse. The family was on the prod bigger  than a wolf, and there was no use reasoning with them. After I had had  every dance with her for an hour or so, her brother coolly stepped in  and took her home. The next morning he felt it his duty, as his  sister's protector, to hunt me up and inform me that if I even spoke  to his sister again, he'd shoot me like a dog.    \"'Is that a bluff, or do you mean it for a real play?' I inquired,  politely.    \"'You'll find that it will be real enough,' he answered, angrily.    \"'Well, now, that's too bad,' I answered; 'I'm really sorry that I  can't promise to respect your request. But this much I can assure you:  any time that you have the leisure and want to shoot me, just cut  loose your dog. But remember this one thing--that it will be my second  shot.'\"    \"Are you sure you wasn't running a blazer yourself, or is the wind  merely rising?\" inquired Durham, while I was shuffling the cards for  the next deal.    \"Well, if I was, I hung up my gentle honk before his eyes and ears and  gave him free license to call it. The truth is, I didn't pay any more  attention to him than I would to an empty bottle. I reckon the girl  was all right, but the family were these razor-backed, barnyard  savages. It makes me hot under the collar yet when I think of it.  They'd have lawed me if I had, but I ought to have shot him and  checked the breed.\"    \"Why didn't you run off with her?\" inquired Fox, dryly.    \"Well, of course a man of your nerve is always capable of advising  others. But you see, I'm strong on the breed. Now a girl can't show  her true colors like the girl's brother did, but get her in the  harness once, and then she'll show you the white of her eye, balk, and  possibly kick over the wagon tongue. No, I believe in the  breed--blood'll tell.\"    \"I worked for a cowman once,\" said Bull, irrelevantly, \"and they told  it on him that he lost twenty thousand dollars the night he was  married.\"    \"How, gambling?\" I inquired.    \"No. The woman he married claimed to be worth twenty thousand dollars  and she never had a cent. Spades trump?\"    \"No; hearts,\" replied The Rebel. \"I used to know a foreman up in  DeWitt County,--'Honest' John Glen they called him. He claimed the  only chance he ever had to marry was a widow, and the reason he didn't  marry her was, he was too honest to take advantage of a dead man.\"    While we paid little attention to wind or weather, this was an ideal  night, and we were laggard in seeking our blankets. Yarn followed  yarn; for nearly every one of us, either from observation or from  practical experience, had a slight acquaintance with the great  mastering passion. But the poetical had not been developed in us to an  appreciative degree, so we discussed the topic under consideration  much as we would have done horses or cattle.    Finally the game ended. A general yawn went the round of the loungers  about the fire. The second guard had gone on, and when the first rode  in, Joe Stallings, halting his horse in passing the fire, called out  sociably, \"That muley steer, the white four year old, didn't like to  bed down amongst the others, so I let him come out and lay down by  himself. You'll find him over on the far side of the herd. You all  remember how wild he was when we first started? Well, you can ride  within three feet of him to-night, and he'll grunt and act sociable  and never offer to get up. I promised him that he might sleep alone as  long as he was good; I just love a good steer. Make down our bed,  pardner; I'll be back as soon as I picket my horse.\"        CHAPTER VII    THE COLORADO    The month of May found our Circle Dot herd, in spite of all drawbacks,  nearly five hundred miles on its way. For the past week we had been  traveling over that immense tableland which skirts the arid portion of  western Texas. A few days before, while passing the blue mountains  which stand as a southern sentinel in the chain marking the headwaters  of the Concho River, we had our first glimpse of the hills. In its  almost primitive condition, the country was generous, supplying every  want for sustenance of horses and cattle. The grass at this stage of  the season was well matured, the herd taking on flesh in a very  gratifying manner, and, while we had crossed some rocky country, lame  and sore-footed cattle had as yet caused us no serious trouble.    One morning when within one day's drive of the Colorado River, as our  herd was leaving the bed ground, the last guard encountered a bunch of  cattle drifting back down the trail. There were nearly fifty head of  the stragglers; and as one of our men on guard turned them to throw  them away from our herd, the road brand caught his eye, and he  recognized the strays as belonging to the Ellison herd which had  passed us at the Indian Lakes some ten days before. Flood's attention  once drawn to the brand, he ordered them thrown into our herd. It was  evident that some trouble had occurred with the Ellison cattle,  possibly a stampede; and it was but a neighborly act to lend any  assistance in our power. As soon as the outfit could breakfast, mount,  and take the herd, Flood sent Priest and me to scout the country to  the westward of the trail, while Bob Blades and Ash Borrowstone  started on a similar errand to the eastward, with orders to throw in  any drifting cattle in the Ellison road brand. Within an hour after  starting, the herd encountered several straggling bands, and as Priest  and I were on the point of returning to the herd, we almost overrode a  bunch of eighty odd head lying down in some broken country. They were  gaunt and tired, and The Rebel at once pronounced their stiffened  movements the result of a stampede.    We were drifting them back towards the trail, when Nat Straw and two  of his men rode out from our herd and met us. \"I always did claim that  it was better to be born lucky than handsome,\" said Straw as he rode  up. \"One week Flood saves me from a dry drive, and the very next one,  he's just the right distance behind to catch my drift from a nasty  stampede. Not only that, but my peelers and I are riding Circle Dot  horses, as well as reaching the wagon in time for breakfast and lining  our flues with Lovell's good chuck. It's too good luck to last, I'm  afraid.    \"I'm not hankering for the dramatic in life, but we had a run last  night that would curl your hair. Just about midnight a bunch of range  cattle ran into us, and before you could say Jack Robinson, our dogies  had vamoosed the ranch and were running in half a dozen different  directions. We rounded them up the best we could in the dark, and then  I took a couple of men and came back down the trail about twenty miles  to catch any drift when day dawned. But you see there's nothing like  being lucky and having good neighbors,--cattle caught, fresh horses,  and a warm breakfast all waiting for you. I'm such a lucky dog, it's a  wonder some one didn't steal me when I was little. I can't help it,  but some day I'll marry a banker's daughter, or fall heir to a ranch  as big as old McCulloch County.\"    Before meeting us, Straw had"]]]
