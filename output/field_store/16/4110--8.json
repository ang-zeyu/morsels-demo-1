And Sir Launcelot rushed Sir Turquine's helmet from off his head. And he  lifted his sword and smote Sir Turquine's head from off his shoulders, so  that it rolled down upon the ground.    Then for a while Sir Launcelot stood there panting for to catch his breath  after that sore battle, for he was nearly stifled with the heat and fury  thereof. Then he went down into the water, and he staggered like a drunken  man as he went, and the water ran all red at his coming. And Sir Launcelot  stooped and slaked his thirst, which was very furious and hot.    Thereafter he came up out of the water again, all dripping, and he went to  where the damsel was and he said to her; \"Damsel, lo, I have overcome Sir  Turquine; now I am ready to go with thee upon that other adventure, as I  promised thee I would.\"    At this the damsel was astonished beyond measure, wherefore she cried:  \"Sir, thou art sorely hurt, and in need of rest for two or three days, and  maybe a long time more, until thy wounds are healed.\"    \"Nay,\" said Sir Launcelot, \"no need to wait; I will go with thee now.\"    Then Sir Launcelot went to Sir Gaheris--for Sir Gaheris had been sitting  for all that while upon that slab of stone. Sir Launcelot said to Sir  Gaheris: \"Fair Lord, be not angry if I take your horse, for I must  presently go with this damsel, and you see mine own horse hath broke his  back.\"    \"Sir Knight,\" said Sir Gaheris, \"this day you have saved both me and my  horse, wherefore it is altogether fitting that my horse or anything that is  mine should be yours to do with as you please. So I pray you take my horse,  only tell me your name and what knight you are; for I swear by my sword  that I never saw any knight in all the world do battle so wonderfully as  you have done to-day.\"    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot makes himself known to Sir Gaheris] \"Sir,\" said  Sir Launcelot, \"I am called Sir Launcelot of the Lake, and I am a knight of  King Arthur's. So it is altogether fitting that I should do such service  unto you as this, seeing that you are the brother of that dear knight, Sir  Gawaine. For if I should not do this battle that I have done for your sake,  I should yet do it for the sake of my lord, King Arthur, who is your uncle  and Sir Gawaine's uncle.\"    Now when Sir Gaheris heard who Sir Launcelot was, he made great exclamation  of amazement. \"Ha, Sir Launcelot!\" he cried, \"and is it thou! Often have I  heard of thee and of thy prowess at arms! I have desired to meet thee more  than any knight in the world; but never did I think to meet thee in such a  case as this.\" Therewith Sir Gaheris arose, and went to Sir Launcelot, and  Sir Launcelot came to him and they met and embraced and kissed one another  upon the face; and from that time forth they were as brethren together.    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot bids Sir Gaheris to free the castle captives]  Then Sir Launcelot said to Sir Gaheris: \"I pray you, Lord, for to go up  unto yonder castle, and bring succor to those unfortunates who lie therein.  For I think you will find there many fellow-knights of the Round Table. And  I believe that you will find therein my brother, Sir Ector, and my cousin,  Sir Lionel. And if you find any other of my kindred I pray you to set them  free and to do what you can for to comfort them and to put them at their  ease. And if there is any treasure in that castle, I bid you give it unto  those knights who are prisoners there, for to compensate them for the pains  they have endured. Moreover, I pray you tell Sir Ector and Sir Lionel not  to follow after me, but to return to court and wait for me there, for I  have two adventures to undertake and I must essay them alone.\"    Then Sir Gaheris was very much astonished, and he cried out upon Sir  Launcelot: \"Sir! Sir! Surely you will not go forth upon another adventure  at this time, seeing that you are so sorely wounded.\"    But Sir Launcelot said: \"Yea, I shall go now; for I do not think that my  wounds are so deep that I shall not be able to do my devoirs when my time  cometh to do them.\"    At this Sir Gaheris was amazed beyond measure, for Sir Launcelot was very  sorely wounded, and his armor was much broken in that battle, wherefore Sir  Gaheris had never beheld a person who was so steadfast of purpose as to do  battle in such a case.    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot departs with the damsel] So Sir Launcelot mounted  Sir Gaheris' horse and rode away with that young damsel, and Sir Gaheris  went to the castle as Sir Launcelot had bidden him to do.    [Sidenote: Sir Gaheris frees the castle captives] In that castle he found  five score and eight prisoners in dreadful case, for some who were there  had been there for a long time, so that the hair of them had grown down  upon their shoulders, and their beards had grown down upon their breasts.  And some had been there but a short time, as was the case of Sir Lionel and  Sir Ector. But all were in a miserable sorry plight; and all of those sad  prisoners but two were knights of King Arthur's court, and eight of them  were knights of the Round Table. All these crowded around Sir Gaheris, for  they saw that he was wounded and they deemed that it was he had set them  free, wherefore they gave him thanks beyond measure.    \"Not so,\" said Sir Gaheris, \"it was not I who set you free; it was Sir  Launcelot of the Lake. He overcame Sir Turquine in such a battle as I never  before beheld. For I saw that battle with mine own eyes, being at a little  distance seated upon a stone slab and wounded as you see. And I make my  oath that I never beheld so fierce and manful a combat in all of my life.  But now your troubles are over and done, and Sir Launcelot greets you all  with words of good cheer and bids me tell you to take all ease and comfort  that you can in being free, and in especial he bids me greet you, Sir  Ector, and you, Sir Lionel, and to tell you that you are to follow him no  farther, but to return to court and bide there until he cometh; for he  goeth upon an adventure which he must undertake by himself.\"    [Sidenote: Sir Lionel and Sir Ector and Sir Kay follow after Sir  Launcelot] \"Not so,\" said Sir Lionel, \"I will follow after him, and find  him.\" And so said Sir Ector likewise, that he would go and find Sir  Launcelot. Then Sir Kay the Seneschal said that he would ride with those  two; so the three took horse and rode away together to find Sir Launcelot.    As for those others, they ransacked throughout the castle of Sir Turquine,  and they found twelve treasure-chests full of treasure, both of silver and  of gold, together with many precious jewels; and they found many bales of  cloth of silk and of cloth of gold. So, as Sir Launcelot had bid them do  so, they divided the treasure among themselves, setting aside a part for  Sir Ector and a part for Sir Lionel and a part for Sir Kay. Then, whereas  before they had been mournful, now they were joyful at having been made so  rich with those precious things.    Thus happily ended that great battle with Sir Turquine which was very  likely the fiercest and most dolorous fight that ever Sir Launcelot had in  all of his life. For, unless it was Sir Tristram, he never found any other  knight so big as Sir Turquine except Sir Galahad, who was his own son.    And now it shall be told how Sir Launcelot fared upon that adventure which  he had promised the young damsel to undertake.    [Illustration: Sir Launcelot sits with Sir Hilaire and Croisette]          Chapter Fifth      _How Sir Launcelot Went Upon an Adventure with the Damsel Croisette as  Companion, and How He Overcame Sir Peris of the Forest Sauvage._    Now after Sir Launcelot had finished that battle with Sir Turquine as  aforetold, and when he had borrowed the horse of Sir Gaheris, he rode away  from that place of combat with the young damsel, with intent to carry out  the other adventure which he had promised her to undertake.    [Sidenote: How Sir Launcelot's wounds pain him] But though he rode with  her, yet, for a while, he said very little to her, for his wounds ached him  sorely and he was in a great deal of pain. So, because of this, he had  small mind to talk, but only to endure what he had to endure with as much  patience as he might command. And the damsel upon her part was somewhat  aware of what Sir Launcelot was suffering and she was right sorry for him,  wherefore she did not trouble him with idle discourse at that moment, but  waited for a while before she spake.    Then by and by she said to him: \"Messire, I would that thou wouldst rest  for some days, and take thine ease, and have thy wounds searched and  dressed, and have thy armor looked to and redded. Now there is a castle at  some distance from this, and it is my brother's castle, and thither we may  go in a little pass. There thou mayst rest for this night and take thine  ease. For I know that my brother will be wonderfully glad to see thee  because thou art so famous.\"    Then Sir Launcelot turned his eyes upon the damsel: \"Fair maiden,\" quoth  he, \"I make confession that I do in sooth ache a very great deal, and that  I am somewhat aweary with the battle I have endured this day. Wherefore I  am very well content to follow thy commands in this matter. But I prithee,  damsel, tell me what is thy name, for I know not yet how thou art called.\"    \"Sir,\" she said, \"I am called Croisette of the Dale, and my brother is  called Sir Hilaire of the Dale, and it is to his castle that I am about to  take thee to rest for this time.\"    Then Sir Launcelot said: \"I go with thee, damsel, wherever it is thy will  to take me.\"    [Sidenote: Of how Sir Launcelot and the damsel ride together] So they two  rode through that valley at a slow pace and very easily. And toward the  waning of the afternoon they left the valley by a narrow side way, and so  in a little while came"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10751"],[0,"Oregon, Washington and Alaska; Sights and Scenes for the Tourist (#12)"],[1,"sacred quiet pervades the whole  building. There were no seats, for the Russians remain standing during  the worship. Service is held every Sabbath by a Russian priest in his  native language, and the church is still supported by the Russian  Government. Indeed, Russia does more for the advancement of religion than  does our own Government for Alaska.    The walk through the Indian ranch was but a repetition of the other  towns, only that they were wealthier and uglier, if possible, than the  other tribes. The Hydahs are very powerfully built, tall, large boned,  and stout.    Two days were spent in visiting and trafficking with these people. Then  the anchor came up, and soon a silver trail like a huge sea serpent moved  among the green isles, and followed us once more--now on the homeward  sail.    But one new place of importance was made on the home trip, and that was at    KILLISNOO.    When the steamer arrived, the evening after leaving Sitka, the city  policeman met us at the wharf and invited us to visit his hut. Of course,  he was a native, who expected to sell some curios. Over his door was the  following:        \"By the Governor's commission,      And the company's permission,      I am made the grand tyhee      Of this entire illahee.        \"Prominent in song and story,      I've attained the top of glory.      As Saginaw I am known to fame,      Jake is but my common name.\"    The time when he attained his fame and glory must have been when he and  his wife were both drunk one night, and he put the handcuffs on his wife  and could not get them off, and she had to go to Sitka to be released. He  appears in at least a dozen different suits while the steamer is in port,  and stands ready to be photographed every time.    Killisnoo used to be a point where 100,000 barrels of herring oil were  put up annually. The industry is now increasing again.    NATURAL WEALTH.    And this reminds me that I am almost neglecting a reference to Alaska's  vast resources in forests, metals, furs, and fish. There are 300,000,000  of acres densely wooded with spruce, red and yellow cedar, Oregon pine,  hemlock, fir, and other useful varieties of timber. Canoes are made from  single trees, sixty feet long, with eight-feet beams.    Gold, silver, lead, iron, coal, and copper are encountered in various  localities. Though but little prospected or developed, Alaska is now  yielding gold at the rate of about $2,000,000 per year. There is a  respectable area of island and mainland country well adapted to  stock-raising, and the production of many cereals and vegetables. The  climate of much of the coast country is milder than that of Colorado, and  stock can feed on the pastures the year round.    But, if Alaska had no mines, forests, or agriculture, its seal and salmon  fisheries would remain alone an immense commercial property. The salmon  are found in almost any part of these northern waters where fresh water  comes in, as they always seek those streams in the spawning season. There  are different varieties that come at stated periods and are caught in  fabulous numbers, sometimes running solid ten feet deep, and often  retarding steamers when a school of them is overtaken. At Idaho Inlet Mr.  Van Gasken brought up a seine for the Ancon tourists containing 350 salmon  for packing. At nearly every port the steamer landed there was either one  or more canning or salt-packing establishments for salmon. Of these,  11,500,000 pounds were marketed last year.    Besides the salmon there is the halibut, black and white cod, rock cod,  herring, sturgeon, and many other fish, while the waters are whipped by  porpoises and whales in large numbers all along the way. Governor  Swineford estimates the products of the Alaska fisheries last year at  $3,000,000.    THE SEAL FISHERIES    are still 1,800 miles west of Sitka. St. Paul and St. George Islands are  the best breeding places of the seals, sea lions, sea otter, and walrus.  These islands are in a continuous fog in summer, and are swept by icy  blasts in winter. There are many interesting facts connected with these  islands and the habits of these phocine kindred, but space is limited.  Suffice that 100,000 seals are killed each year for commercial purposes.  Over 1,000,000 seal pups are born every year, and when they leave for  winter quarters they go in families and not altogether. An average seal  is about six feet long, but some are found eight feet long and weigh from  400 to 800 pounds. The work of catching is all done between the middle of  June and the first of August. The fur company are supposed to pay our  Government $2 for each pelt. These hides are at once shipped to London to  be dyed and made ready to be put on the market in the United States.    In fact, Alaska seems full to overflowing with offerings to seekers of  fortune or pleasure. Its coast climate is mild, with no extreme heat,  because of the snow-clad peaks which temper the humid air, and never  extreme cold, because of the Japan current that bathes its mossy slopes  and destroys the frigid wave before it does its work.    Three thousand miles along this inland sea has revealed scenes of  matchless grandeur--majestic mountains (think of snow-crowned St. Elias,  rising 19,500 feet from the ocean's edge), the mightiest glaciers,  world's of inimitable, indescribable splendor. It is a trip of a  lifetime. There is none other like it, and our party unanimously resolves  that the tourist who fails to take it misses very much.           *       *       *       *       *    _Fifth Tour_.--From Portland to San Francisco by steamer is one of the  most enjoyable trips offered the tourist in point of safety and comfort,  and the service is exceptionally fine.
