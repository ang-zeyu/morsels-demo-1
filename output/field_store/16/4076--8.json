Among their greatest buildings were the amphitheaters,    from the benches of which crowds watched gladiators fighting one another    or struggling with wild beasts. The largest of these amphitheaters was    the Colosseum, the ruins of which still exist. Its outer walls were one    hundred and sixty feet high. In one direction it measured six hundred    and seventeen feet and in another five hundred and twelve. There were    seats enough for forty-five thousand persons. The lowest seats were    raised fifteen feet above the arena or central space where men or wild    beasts fought. Through an arrangement of underground pipes the arena    could be flooded so that the spectators might enjoy the excitement of a    real naval battle.      Another great building was the Circus Maximus, built to hold the crowds    that watched the chariot-races, and at one time having seats for two    hundred thousand persons. In their amusements the Romans became more and    more vulgar, excitable, and cruel. Some equally splendid buildings were    used for better things.      [Illustration: The Pantheon]    THE PANTHEON. One of these was the Pantheon, a temple which was    afterward a Christian church. It still stands, and is now used as the    burial-place of the Italian kings. The most remarkable part of it is the    dome, which has a width of a little over one hundred and forty-two feet.    No other dome in the world is so wide. The Romans were very successful    in covering large spaces with arched or vaulted ceilings. All later    builders of domes and arches are their pupils.      [Illustration: THE ARCH OF TITUS]    BASILICAS. The Romans had other large buildings called basilicas.    These were porticoes or promenades, with the space in the center covered    by a great roof. They were used as places for public meetings. One of    them had one hundred and eight pillars arranged in a double row around    the sides and ends of this central space. The name basilica is Greek and    means \"royal.\" Some of these basilicas were used as Christian churches    when the Romans accepted the Christian religion. The central space was    then called the \"nave,\" and the spaces between the columns the aisles.    TRIUMPHAL ARCHES. The Romans built beautiful arches to celebrate    their victories. Several of these still remain, with sentences cut into    their stone tablets telling of the triumphs of their builders. Modern    people have taken them as models for similar memorial arches.      [Illustration: A ROMAN AQUEDUCT Still in good repair, the Pont    du Gard, near Nimes, France]    ROMAN LAW. The Romans did much for the world by their laws. They    showed little regard for the rights of men captured in war and were    cruel in their treatment of slaves, but they considered carefully the    rights of free men and women. Under the emperors the lawyers and judges    worked to make the laws clearer and fairer to all. Finally the Emperor    Justinian, who ruled at the time when the empire was already half ruined    by the attacks of barbarian enemies, ordered the lawyer Tribonian to    gather into a single code all the statutes and decrees. These laws    lasted long after the empire was destroyed, and out of them grew many of    the laws used in Europe to-day. They have also influenced our laws    in America.

[Illustration: TEMPLUM JOVIS CAPITOLINI (Medallion)]          CHAPTER IX      CHRISTIANITY AND THE ROMAN EMPIRE    THE RELIGION OF THE JEWS. Among the cities captured by the Romans    was Jerusalem, about which cluster so many stories from the Old    Testament. There, hundreds of years before, lived David, the shepherd    boy who, after wonderful adventures, became king of his people. There    his son Solomon built a temple of dazzling splendor. Among this people    had arisen great preachers,--Isaiah, Jeremiah, Micah,--who declared that    religion did not consist in the sacrifice of bulls and goats, but in    justice, in mercy, and in humility. They had a genius for religion, just    as the Greeks had a genius for art, and the Romans a genius for    government.    THE JEWS CONQUERED BY THE ROMANS. When the Jews first heard of the    Romans they admired these citizens of a republic who made and unmade    kings. In later years they learned that the Romans were hard masters and    they feared and hated them. The Jewish kingdom was one of the last    countries along the shores of the Mediterranean which the Romans    conquered, but like all the others it finally became a Roman province.    JESUS OF NAZARETH. A few years before the Jewish kingdom became a    Roman province there was born in a village near Jerusalem a child named    Jesus. After he had grown to manhood in Nazareth he gathered about him    followers or disciples whom he taught to live and act as is told in the    books of the New Testament.      [Illustration: A VIEW OF JERUSALEM Showing the Mount of Olives    in the distance]      This was the beginning of the Christian religion. It was first held by a    little band of Jews, but Paul, a Jew born in Tarsus, a city of Asia    whose inhabitants had received the rights of Roman citizenship, believed    that the message of the new religion was meant for all nations. He    taught it in many cities of Asia Minor and Greece, and even went as far    west as Rome. Several of the epistles or letters in the New Testament    were written by Paul to churches which he had founded or where he had    taught. So it happens that from Palestine came religious teachings which    multitudes consider even more important than the art and literature of    the Greeks or the laws and political methods of the Romans.    WHY THE CHRISTIANS WERE PERSECUTED. The Romans at first refused to    permit any one in their empire to call himself a Christian. They    disliked the Jews because the Jews denied that the Roman gods were real    gods, asserting that these gods were mere images in wood and stone. The    Christians did this also, but in the eyes of the Roman rulers the worst    offense of the Christians was that they appeared to form a sort of    secret society and held meetings to which other persons were not    admitted. The emperor had forbidden such societies.      The Romans also disliked the Christians because of their refusal to join    in the public ceremonies which honored the emperor as if he were a god    who had given peace and order to the world and who was able to reward    the good and punish the evil. The Christians believed it to be wrong to    join in the worship of an emperor, whether he were alive or dead.    CHRISTIANS PUT TO DEATH. The Romans were cruel in their manner of    punishing disobedience, and many Christians suffered death in its most    horrible forms. Some were burned, others were tortured, others were torn    to pieces by wild animals in the great amphitheaters to satisfy the    fierce Roman crowd. Nero, the worst of the Roman emperors, who, many    thought, set Rome on fire in order that he might enjoy the sight of the    burning city, tried to turn suspicion from himself by accusing the    Christians of the crime. He punished them by tying them to poles,    smearing their bodies with pitch, and burning them at night as torches.    THE CHRISTIANS ALLOWED TO WORSHIP. The new religion spread rapidly    from province to province in spite of these persecutions. At first the    Christians worshiped secretly, but later they ventured to build    churches. Finally, three centuries after the birth of Christ, the    emperors promised that the persecutions should cease and that the    Christians might worship undisturbed.      [Illustration: A VIEW OF CONSTANTINOPLE]    THE ROMAN EMPIRE BECOMES CHRISTIAN ABOUT 325 A.D. Constantine was    the first emperor to become Christian.

Seems there was a young gent in Martindale--all you boys know  old Jasper Lanning?\" There was an answering chorus. \"Well, he's got a  nephew, Andrew Lanning. This kid was sort of a bashful kind, they say.  But yesterday he up and bashed a fellow in the jaw, and the man went  down. Whacked his head on a rock, and young Lanning thought his man was  dead. So he holds off the crowd with a gun, hops a horse, and beats it.\"    \"Pretty, pretty!\" murmured Larry. \"But what's that got to do with that  hyena, Bill Dozier?\"    \"I don't get it all hitched up straight. Most of the news come from  Martindale to town by telephone. Seems this young Lanning was follered  by Bill Dozier. He was always a hound for a job like that, eh?\"    There was a growl of assent.    \"He hand-picked five rough ones and went after Lanning. Chased him all  night. Landed at John Merchant's place. The kid had dropped in there to  call on a girl. Can you beat that for cold nerve, him figuring that he'd  killed a man, and Bill Dozier and five more on his trail to bring him  back to wait and see whether the buck he dropped lived or died--and then  to slide over and call on a lady? No, you can't raise that!\"    But the tidings were gradually breaking in upon the mind of Andrew  Lanning. Buck Heath had not been dead; the pursuit was simply to bring  him back on some charge of assault; and now--Bill Dozier--the head of  Andrew swam.    \"Seems he didn't know her, either. Just paid a call round about dawn and  then rode on. Bill comes along a little later on the trail, gets new  horses from Merchant, and runs down Lanning early this morning. Runs him  down, and then Lanning turns in the saddle and drills Bill through the  head at five hundred yards.\" Henry came to life. \"How far?\" he said.    \"That's what they got over the telephone,\" said Scottie apologetically.    \"Then the news got to Hal Dozier from Merchant's house. Hal hops on the  wire and gets in touch with the governor, and in about ten seconds they  make this Lanning kid an outlaw and stick a price on his head--five  thousand, I think, and they say Merchant is behind it. The telephone was  buzzing with it when I left town, and most of the boys were oiling up  their gats and getting ready to make a play. Pretty easy money, eh, for  putting the rollers under a kid?\"    Andrew Lanning muttered aloud: \"An outlaw!\"    \"Not the first time Bill Dozier has done it,\" said Henry calmly. \"That's  an old maneuver of his--to hound a man from a little crime to a  big one.\"    The throat of Andrew was dry. \"Did you get a description of young  Lanning?\" he asked.    \"Sure,\" nodded Scottie. \"Twenty-three years old, about five feet ten,  black hair and black eyes, good looking, big shoulders, quiet spoken.\"    Andrew made a gesture and looked carelessly out the back window, but,  from the corner of his eyes, he was noting the five men. Not a line of  their expressions escaped him. He was seeing, literally, with eyes in  the back of his head; and if, by the interchange of one knowing glance,  or by a significant silence, even, these fellows had indicated that they  remotely guessed his identity, he would have been on his feet like a  tiger, gun in hand, and backing for the door. Five thousand dollars!  What would not one of these men do for that sum?    Andy had been keyed to the breaking point before; but his alertness was  now trebled, and, like a sensitive barometer, he felt the danger of  Larry, the brute strength of Jeff, the cunning of Henry, the grave poise  of Joe, to say nothing of Scottie--an unknown force. But Scottie was  running on in his talk; he was telling of how he met the storekeeper in  town; he was naming everything he saw; these fellows seemed to hunger  for the minutest news of men. They broke into admiring laughter when  Scottie told of his victorious tilt of jesting with the storekeeper's  daughter; even Henry came out of his patient gloom long enough to smile  at this, and the rest were like children. Larry was laughing so heartily  that his eyes began to twinkle. He even invited Andrew in on the mirth.    At this point Andy stood up and stretched elaborately--but in stretching  he put his arms behind him, and stretched them down rather than up, so  that his hands were never far from his hips.    \"I'll be turning in,\" said Andy, and stepping back to the door so that  his face would be toward them until the last instant of his exit, he  waved good night.    There was a brief shifting of eyes toward him, and a grunt from Jeff;  that was all. Then the eye of every one reverted to Scottie. But the  latter broke off his narrative.    \"Ain't you sleepin' in?\" he asked. \"We could fix you a bunk upstairs, I  guess.\"    Once more the glance of Andrew flashed from face to face, and then he  saw the first suspicious thing. Scottie was looking straight at Henry,  in the corner, as though waiting for a direction, and, from the corner  of his eye, Andrew was aware that Henry had nodded ever so slightly.    \"Here's something you might be interested to know,\" said Scottie. \"This  young Lanning was riding a pinto hoss.\" He added, while Andrew stood  rooted to the spot: \"You seemed sort of interested in the description. I  allowed maybe you'd try your hand at findin' him.\"    Andy understood perfectly that he was known, and, with his left hand  frozen against the knob of the door, he flattened his shoulders against  the wall and stood ready for the draw. In the crisis, at the first  hostile move, he decided that he would dive straight for the table,  low. It would tumble the room into darkness as the candles fell--a  semidarkness, for there would be a sputtering lantern still.    Then he would fight for his life. And looking at the others, he saw that  they were changed, indeed. They were all facing him, and their faces  were alive with interest; yet they made no hostile move. No doubt they  awaited the signal of Henry; there was the greatest danger; and now  Henry stood up.    His first word was a throwing down of disguises. \"Mr. Lanning,\" he said,  \"I think this is a time for introductions.\"    That cold exultation, that wild impulse to throw himself into the arms  of danger, was sweeping over Andrew. He made no gesture toward his gun,  though his fingers were curling, but he said: \"Friends, I've got you all  in my eye. I'm going to open this door and go out. No harm to any of  you. But if you try to stop me, it means trouble, a lot of  trouble--quick!\"    Just a split second of suspense. If a foot stirred, or a hand raised,  Andrew's curling hand would jerk up and bring out a revolver, and every  man in the room knew it. Then the voice of Henry, \"You'd plan on  fighting us all?\"    \"Take my bridle off the wall,\" said Andrew, looking straight before him  at no face, and thereby enabled to see everything, just as a boxer looks  in the eye of his opponent and thereby sees every move of his gloves.  \"Take my bridle off the wall, you, Jeff, and throw it at my feet.\"    The bridle rattled at his feet.    \"This has gone far enough,\" said Henry. \"Lanning, you've got the wrong  idea. I'm going ahead with the introductions. The red-headed fellow we  call Jeff is better known to the public as Jeff Rankin. Does that mean  anything to you?\" Jeff Rankin acknowledged the introduction with a broad  grin, the corners of his mouth being lost in the heavy fold of his  jowls. \"I see it doesn't,\" went on Henry. \"Very well. Joe's name is Joe  Clune. Yonder sits Scottie Macdougal. There is Larry la Roche. And I am  Henry Allister.\"    The edge of Andrew's alertness was suddenly dulled. The last name swept  into his brain a wave of meaning, for of all words on the mountain  desert there was none more familiar than Henry Allister. Scar-faced  Allister, they called him. Of those deadly men who figured in the tales  of Uncle Jasper, Henry Allister was the last and the most grim. A  thousand stories clustered about him: of how he killed Watkins; of how  Langley, the famous Federal marshal, trailed him for five years and was  finally killed in the duel which left Allister with that scar; of how he  broke jail at Garrisonville and again at St. Luke City. In the  imagination of Andrew he had loomed like a giant, some seven-foot  prodigy, whiskered, savage of eye, terrible of voice. And, turning  toward him, Andrew saw him in profile with the scar obscured--and his  face was of almost feminine refinement.    Five thousand dollars?    A dozen rich men in the mountain desert would each pay more than that  for the apprehension of Allister, dead or alive. And bitterly it came  over Andrew that this genius of crime, this heartless murderer as story  depicted him, was no danger to him but almost a friend. And the other  four ruffians of Allister's band were smiling cordially at him, enjoying  his astonishment. The day before his hair would have turned white in  such a place among such men; tonight they were his friends.          CHAPTER 14      After that things happened to Andrew in a swirl. They were shaking hands  with him. They were congratulating him on the killing of Bill Dozier.  They were patting him on the back. Larry la Roche, who had been so  hostile, now stood up to the full of his ungainly height and proposed  his health. And the other men drank it standing. Andy received a tin cup  half full of whisky, and he drank the burning stuff in acknowledgment.  The unaccustomed drink went to his head, his muscles began to relax, his  eyes swam. Voices boomed at him out of a haze. \"Why, he's only a young  kid. One shot put him under the weather.\"    \"Shut up, Larry. He'll learn fast enough.\"    \"Ah, yes,\" said Larry to himself, \"he'll learn fast enough!\"    Presently he was lifted and carried by strong arms up a creaking stairs.  He looked up, and he saw the red hair of the mighty Jeff, who carried  him as if he had been a child, and deposited him among some blankets.    \"I didn't know,\" Larry la Roche was saying. \"Ho"]]]
