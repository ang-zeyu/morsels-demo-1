In the first place, the life was very hard,  and, in the second, the American seaman was very patriotic. He had  an honest and deep affection for his own flag; while, on the contrary,  he felt a curiously strong hatred for England, as distinguished from  Englishmen. This hatred was partly an abstract feeling, cherished  through a vague traditional respect for Bunker Hill, and partly  something very real and vivid, owing to the injuries he, and others  like him, had received. Whether he lived in Maryland or Massachusetts,  he certainly knew men whose ships had been seized by British cruisers,  their goods confiscated, and the vessels condemned. Some of his  friends had fallen victims to the odious right of search, and had  never been heard of afterward. He had suffered many an injury to  friend, fortune, or person, and some day he hoped to repay them  all; and when the war did come, he fought all the better because  he knew it was in his own quarrel. But, as I have said, this hatred  was against England, not against Englishmen. Then, as now, sailors  were scattered about over the world without any great regard for  nationality; and the resulting intermingling of natives and  foreigners in every mercantile marine was especially great in those  of Britain and America, whose people spoke the same tongue and wore  the same aspect. When chance drifted the American into Liverpool  or London, he was ready enough to ship in an Indiaman or whaler,  caring little for the fact that he served under the British flag;  and the Briton, in turn, who found himself in New York or  Philadelphia, willingly sailed in one of the clipper-built barques,  whether it floated the stars and stripes or not. When Captain Porter  wrought such havoc among the British whalers in the South Seas,  he found that no inconsiderable portion of their crews consisted  of Americans, some of whom enlisted on board his own vessel; and  among the crews of the American whalers were many British. In fact,  though the skipper of each ship might brag loudly of his nationality,  yet in practical life he knew well enough that there was very little  to choose between a Yankee and a Briton. [Footnote: What choice  there was, was in favor of the American. In point of courage there  was no difference whatever. The _Essex_ and the _Lawrence_, as  well as the _Frolic_ and the _Reindeer_, were defended with the  same stubborn, desperate, cool bravery that marks the English race  on both sides of the Atlantic. But the American was a free citizen,  any one's equal, a voter with a personal interest in his country's  welfare, and, above all, without having perpetually before his eyes  the degrading fear of the press-gang. In consequence, he was more  tractable than the Englishman, more self-reliant, and possessed  greater judgment. In the fight between the _Wasp_ and the _Frolic_,  the latter's crew had apparently been well trained at the guns, for  they aimed well; but they fired at the wrong time, and never  corrected the error; while their antagonists, delivering their  broadsides far more slowly, by intelligently waiting until the  proper moment, worked frightful havoc. But though there was a  certain slight difference between the seamen of the two nations,  it must never be forgotten that it was very much less than that  between the various individuals of the same nation; and when the  British had been trained for a few years by such commanders as  Broke and Manners, it was impossible to surpass them, and it needed  our best men to equal them.] Both were bold and hardy, cool and  intelligent, quick with their hands, and showing at their best in  an emergency. They looked alike and spoke alike; when they took  the trouble to think, they thought alike; and when they got drunk,  which was not an infrequent occurrence, they quarrelled alike.    Mingled with them were a few seamen of other nationalities. The  Irishman, if he came from the old Dano-Irish towns of Waterford,  Dublin, and Wexford, or from the Ulster coast, was very much like  the two chief combatants; the Celto-Turanian kern of the west did  not often appear on shipboard. The French, Danes, and Dutch were  hemmed in at home; they had enough to do on their own seaboard,  and could not send men into foreign fleets. A few Norse, however,  did come in, and excellent sailors and fighters they made. With  the Portuguese and Italians, of whom some were to be found serving  under the union-jack, and others under the stars and stripes, it  was different; although there were many excellent exceptions they  did not, as a rule, make the best of seamen. They were treacherous,  fond of the knife, less ready with their hands, and likely to lose  either their wits or their courage when in a tight place.    In the American navy, unlike the British, there was no impressment;  the sailor was a volunteer, and he shipped in whatever craft his  fancy selected. Throughout the war there were no \"picked crews\" on  the American side, [Footnote: James' statements to the contrary  being in every case utterly without foundation. He is also wrong  in his assertion that the American ships had no boys; they had nearly  as many in proportion as the British. The _Constitution_ had 31,  the _Adams_ 15, etc. So, when he states that our midshipmen were  generally masters and mates of merchantmen; they were generally  from eleven to seventeen years old at the beginning of the war,  and besides, had rarely or never been in the merchant marine.]  excepting on the last two cruises of the _Constitution_. In fact  (as seen by the letter of Captains Stewart and Bainbridge to  Secretary Hamilton), there was often much difficulty in getting  enough men. [Footnote: Reading through the volumes of official  letters about this war, which are preserved in the office of the  Secretary of the Navy, one of the most noticeable things is the  continual complaints about the difficulty of getting men. The  _Adams_ at one time had a crew of but nineteen men--\"fourteen of  whom are marines,\" adds the aggrieved commander. A log-book of  one of the gun-boats records the fact that after much difficulty  _two_ men were enlisted--from the jail, with a parenthetical  memorandum to the effect that they were both very drunk. British  ships were much more easily manned, as they could always have  recourse to impressment.    The _Constitution_ on starting out her last cruises had an  extraordinary number of able seamen aboard, viz., 218, with but 92  ordinary seamen, 12 boys, and 44 marines, making, with the officers,  a total of 440 men. (See letter of Captain Bainbridge, Oct. 16,  1814; it is letter No. 51, in the fortieth volume of \"Captains'  Letters,\" in the clerk's office of the Secretary of the Navy.)]  Many sailors preferred to serve in the innumerable privateers, and,  the two above-mentioned officers, in urging the necessity of  building line-of-battle ships, state that it was hard work to  recruit men for vessels of an inferior grade, so long as the enemy  had ships of the line.    One of the standard statements made by the British historians about  this war is that our ships were mainly or largely manned by British  sailors. This, if true, would not interfere with the lessons which  it teaches; and, besides that, it is _not_ true.    In this, as in every thing else, all the modern writers have merely  followed James or Brenton, and I shall accordingly confine myself  to examining their assertions. The former begins (vol. iv, p. 470)  by diffidently stating that there is a \"similarity\" of language between  the inhabitants of the two countries--an interesting philological  discovery that but few will attempt to controvert. In vol. vi, p.  154, he mentions that a number of blanks occur in the American Navy  List in the column \"Where Born\"; and in proof of the fact that these  blanks are there because the men were not Americans, he says that  their names \"are all English and Irish.\" [Footnote: For example,  James writes: \"Out of the 32 captains one only, Thomas Tingey, had  England marked as his birthplace.... Three blanks occur, and we  consider it rather creditable to Captains John Shaw, Daniel S.  Patterson, and John Ord Creighton, that they were ashamed to tell  where they were born.\" I have not been able to find out the latter's  birth-place, but Captain Shaw was born in New York, and I have seen  Captain Patterson incidentally alluded to as \"born and bred in  America.\" Generally, whenever I have been able to fill up the  vacancies in the column \"Where Born,\" I have found that it was in  America. From these facts it would appear that James was somewhat  hasty in concluding that the omission of the birth-place proved the  owner of the name to be a native of Great Britain.] They certainly  are; and so are all the other names in the list. It could not well  be otherwise, as the United States Navy was not officered by Indians.  In looking over this same Navy List (of 1816) it will be seen that  but a little over 5 per cent, of the officers were born abroad--a  smaller proportion by far than would exist in the population of the  country at large--and most of these had come to America when under  ten years of age. On p. 155 James adds that the British sailors  composed \"one third in number and one half in point of effectiveness\"  of the American crews. Brenton in his \"Naval History\" writes: \"It  was said, and I have no reason to doubt the fact, that there were  200 British seamen aboard the _Constitution_.\" [Footnote: New  edition, London, 1837, vol. ii, p. 456.] These statements are mere  assertions unsupported by proof, and of such a loose character as  to be difficult to refute. As our navy was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/917"],[0,"Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of 'Eighty (#11)"],[1,"there was wildness and vacancy, in hers  there was the patient composure of long effort and quiet resignation.    One thing about this face was very strange and startling. You could not  look upon it in its most cheerful mood without feeling that it had some  extraordinary capacity of expressing terror. It was not on the surface.  It was in no one feature that it lingered. You could not take the  eyes or mouth, or lines upon the cheek, and say, if this or that were  otherwise, it would not be so. Yet there it always lurked--something for  ever dimly seen, but ever there, and never absent for a moment. It was  the faintest, palest shadow of some look, to which an instant of intense  and most unutterable horror only could have given birth; but indistinct  and feeble as it was, it did suggest what that look must have been, and  fixed it in the mind as if it had had existence in a dream.    More faintly imaged, and wanting force and purpose, as it were, because  of his darkened intellect, there was this same stamp upon the son.  Seen in a picture, it must have had some legend with it, and would have  haunted those who looked upon the canvas. They who knew the Maypole  story, and could remember what the widow was, before her husband's and  his master's murder, understood it well. They recollected how the change  had come, and could call to mind that when her son was born, upon the  very day the deed was known, he bore upon his wrist what seemed a smear  of blood but half washed out.    'God save you, neighbour!' said the locksmith, as he followed her, with  the air of an old friend, into a little parlour where a cheerful fire  was burning.    'And you,' she answered smiling. 'Your kind heart has brought you  here again. Nothing will keep you at home, I know of old, if there are  friends to serve or comfort, out of doors.'    'Tut, tut,' returned the locksmith, rubbing his hands and warming them.  'You women are such talkers. What of the patient, neighbour?'    'He is sleeping now. He was very restless towards daylight, and for  some hours tossed and tumbled sadly. But the fever has left him, and the  doctor says he will soon mend. He must not be removed until to-morrow.'    'He has had visitors to-day--humph?' said Gabriel, slyly.    'Yes. Old Mr Chester has been here ever since we sent for him, and had  not been gone many minutes when you knocked.'    'No ladies?' said Gabriel, elevating his eyebrows and looking  disappointed.    'A letter,' replied the widow.    'Come. That's better than nothing!' replied the locksmith. 'Who was the  bearer?'    'Barnaby, of course.'    'Barnaby's a jewel!' said Varden; 'and comes and goes with ease where we  who think ourselves much wiser would make but a poor hand of it. He is  not out wandering, again, I hope?'    'Thank Heaven he is in his bed; having been up all night, as you know,  and on his feet all day. He was quite tired out. Ah, neighbour, if I  could but see him oftener so--if I could but tame down that terrible  restlessness--'    'In good time,' said the locksmith, kindly, 'in good time--don't be  down-hearted. To my mind he grows wiser every day.'    The widow shook her head. And yet, though she knew the locksmith sought  to cheer her, and spoke from no conviction of his own, she was glad to  hear even this praise of her poor benighted son.    'He will be a 'cute man yet,' resumed the locksmith. 'Take care, when we  are growing old and foolish, Barnaby doesn't put us to the blush, that's  all. But our other friend,' he added, looking under the table and  about the floor--'sharpest and cunningest of all the sharp and cunning  ones--where's he?'    'In Barnaby's room,' rejoined the widow, with a faint smile.    'Ah! He's a knowing blade!' said Varden, shaking his head. 'I should  be sorry to talk secrets before him. Oh! He's a deep customer. I've no  doubt he can read, and write, and cast accounts if he chooses. What was  that? Him tapping at the door?'    'No,' returned the widow. 'It was in the street, I think. Hark! Yes.  There again! 'Tis some one knocking softly at the shutter. Who can it  be!'    They had been speaking in a low tone, for the invalid lay overhead, and  the walls and ceilings being thin and poorly built, the sound of their  voices might otherwise have disturbed his slumber. The party without,  whoever it was, could have stood close to the shutter without hearing  anything spoken; and, seeing the light through the chinks and finding  all so quiet, might have been persuaded that only one person was there.    'Some thief or ruffian maybe,' said the locksmith. 'Give me the light.'    'No, no,' she returned hastily. 'Such visitors have never come to this  poor dwelling. Do you stay here. You're within call, at the worst. I  would rather go myself--alone.'    'Why?' said the locksmith, unwillingly relinquishing the candle he had  caught up from the table.    'Because--I don't know why--because the wish is so strong upon me,' she  rejoined. 'There again--do not detain me, I beg of you!'    Gabriel looked at her, in great surprise to see one who was usually so  mild and quiet thus agitated, and with so little cause. She left the  room and closed the door behind her. She stood for a moment as if  hesitating, with her hand upon the lock. In this short interval the  knocking came again, and a voice close to the window--a voice the  locksmith seemed to recollect, and to have some disagreeable association  with--whispered 'Make haste.'    The words were uttered in that low distinct voice which finds its way so  readily to sleepers' ears, and wakes them in a fright. For a moment  it startled even the locksmith; who involuntarily drew back from the  window, and listened.    The wind rumbling in the chimney made it difficult to hear what passed,  but he could tell that the door was opened, that there was the tread of  a man upon the creaking boards, and then a moment's silence--broken by a  suppressed something which was not a shriek, or groan, or cry for help,  and yet might have been either or all three; and the words 'My God!'  uttered in a voice it chilled him to hear.    He rushed out upon the instant. There, at last, was that dreadful  look--the very one he seemed to know so well and yet had never seen  before--upon her face. There she stood, frozen to the ground, gazing  with starting eyes, and livid cheeks, and every feature fixed and  ghastly, upon the man he had encountered in the dark last night. His  eyes met those of the locksmith. It was but a flash, an instant, a  breath upon a polished glass, and he was gone.    The locksmith was upon him--had the skirts of his streaming garment  almost in his grasp--when his arms were tightly clutched, and the widow  flung herself upon the ground before him.    'The other way--the other way,' she cried. 'He went the other way.  Turn--turn!'    'The other way! I see him now,' rejoined the locksmith,  pointing--'yonder--there--there is his shadow passing by that light.  What--who is this? Let me go.'    'Come back, come back!' exclaimed the woman, clasping him; 'Do not  touch him on your life. I charge you, come back. He carries other lives  besides his own. Come back!'    'What does this mean?' cried the locksmith.    'No matter what it means, don't ask, don't speak, don't think about it.  He is not to be followed, checked, or stopped. Come back!'    The old man looked at her in wonder, as she writhed and clung about him;  and, borne down by her passion, suffered her to drag him into the house.  It was not until she had chained and double-locked the door, fastened  every bolt and bar with the heat and fury of a maniac, and drawn him  back into the room, that she turned upon him, once again, that stony  look of horror, and, sinking down into a chair, covered her face, and  shuddered, as though the hand of death were on her.        Chapter 6      Beyond all measure astonished by the strange occurrences which had  passed with so much violence and rapidity, the locksmith gazed upon the  shuddering figure in the chair like one half stupefied, and would have  gazed much longer, had not his tongue been loosened by compassion and  humanity.    'You are ill,' said Gabriel. 'Let me call some neighbour in.'    'Not for the world,' she rejoined, motioning to him with her trembling  hand, and holding her face averted. 'It is enough that you have been by,  to see this.'    'Nay, more than enough--or less,' said Gabriel.    'Be it so,' she returned. 'As you like. Ask me no questions, I entreat  you.'    'Neighbour,' said the locksmith, after a pause. 'Is this fair, or  reasonable, or just to yourself? Is it like you, who have known me so  long and sought my advice in all matters--like you, who from a girl have  had a strong mind and a staunch heart?'    'I have need of them,' she replied. 'I am growing old, both in years and  care. Perhaps that, and too much trial, have made them weaker than they  used to be. Do not speak to me.'    'How can I see what I have seen, and hold my peace!' returned the  locksmith. 'Who was that man, and why has his coming made this change in  you?'    She was silent, but held to the chair as though to save herself from  falling on the ground.    'I take the licence of an old acquaintance, Mary,' said the locksmith,  'who has ever had a warm regard for you, and maybe has tried to prove it  when he could. Who is this ill-favoured man, and what has he to do with  you? Who is this ghost, that is only seen in the black nights and bad  weather? How does he know, and why does he haunt this house, whispering  through chinks and crevices, as if there was that between him and you,  which neither durst so much as speak aloud of? Who is he?'    'You do well to say he haunts this house,' returned the widow, faintly.  'His shadow has been upon it and me, in light and darkness, at noonday  and midnight. And now, at last, he has come in the body!'    'But he wouldn't have gone in the body,' returned the"]]]
