Boxtel, once more worsted by the superiority of his hated rival, was  now completely disgusted with tulip-growing, and, being driven half mad,  devoted himself entirely to observation.    The house of his rival was quite open to view; a garden exposed to the  sun; cabinets with glass walls, shelves, cupboards, boxes, and ticketed  pigeon-holes, which could easily be surveyed by the telescope. Boxtel  allowed his bulbs to rot in the pits, his seedlings to dry up in their  cases, and his tulips to wither in the borders and henceforward occupied  himself with nothing else but the doings at Van Baerle's. He breathed  through the stalks of Van Baerle's tulips, quenched his thirst with the  water he sprinkled upon them, and feasted on the fine soft earth which  his neighbour scattered upon his cherished bulbs.    But the most curious part of the operations was not performed in the  garden.    It might be one o'clock in the morning when Van Baerle went up to his  laboratory, into the glazed cabinet whither Boxtel's telescope had such  an easy access; and here, as soon as the lamp illuminated the walls and  windows, Boxtel saw the inventive genius of his rival at work.    He beheld him sifting his seeds, and soaking them in liquids which were  destined to modify or to deepen their colours. He knew what Cornelius  meant when heating certain grains, then moistening them, then combining  them with others by a sort of grafting,--a minute and marvellously  delicate manipulation,--and when he shut up in darkness those which were  expected to furnish the black colour, exposed to the sun or to the  lamp those which were to produce red, and placed between the endless  reflections of two water-mirrors those intended for white, the pure  representation of the limpid element.    This innocent magic, the fruit at the same time of child-like musings  and of manly genius--this patient untiring labour, of which Boxtel knew  himself to be incapable--made him, gnawed as he was with envy, centre  all his life, all his thoughts, and all his hopes in his telescope.    For, strange to say, the love and interest of horticulture had not  deadened in Isaac his fierce envy and thirst of revenge. Sometimes,  whilst covering Van Baerle with his telescope, he deluded himself into a  belief that he was levelling a never-failing musket at him; and then he  would seek with his finger for the trigger to fire the shot which was  to have killed his neighbour. But it is time that we should connect with  this epoch of the operations of the one, and the espionage of the other,  the visit which Cornelius de Witt came to pay to his native town.          Chapter 7. The Happy Man makes Acquaintance with Misfortune      Cornelius de Witt, after having attended to his family affairs, reached  the house of his godson, Cornelius van Baerle, one evening in the month  of January, 1672.    De Witt, although being very little of a horticulturist or of an  artist, went over the whole mansion, from the studio to the green-house,  inspecting everything, from the pictures down to the tulips. He thanked  his godson for having joined him on the deck of the admiral's ship \"The  Seven Provinces,\" during the battle of Southwold Bay, and for having  given his name to a magnificent tulip; and whilst he thus, with the  kindness and affability of a father to a son, visited Van Baerle's  treasures, the crowd gathered with curiosity, and even respect, before  the door of the happy man.    All this hubbub excited the attention of Boxtel, who was just taking his  meal by his fireside. He inquired what it meant, and, on being informed  of the cause of all this stir, climbed up to his post of observation,  where in spite of the cold, he took his stand, with the telescope to his  eye.    This telescope had not been of great service to him since the autumn of  1671. The tulips, like true daughters of the East, averse to cold, do  not abide in the open ground in winter. They need the shelter of the  house, the soft bed on the shelves, and the congenial warmth of the  stove. Van Baerle, therefore, passed the whole winter in his laboratory,  in the midst of his books and pictures. He went only rarely to the room  where he kept his bulbs, unless it were to allow some occasional rays  of the sun to enter, by opening one of the movable sashes of the glass  front.    On the evening of which we are speaking, after the two Corneliuses had  visited together all the apartments of the house, whilst a train of  domestics followed their steps, De Witt said in a low voice to Van  Baerle,--    \"My dear son, send these people away, and let us be alone for some  minutes.\"    The younger Cornelius, bowing assent, said aloud,--    \"Would you now, sir, please to see my dry-room?\"    The dry-room, this pantheon, this sanctum sanctorum of the  tulip-fancier, was, as Delphi of old, interdicted to the profane  uninitiated.    Never had any of his servants been bold enough to set his foot there.  Cornelius admitted only the inoffensive broom of an old Frisian  housekeeper, who had been his nurse, and who from the time when he  had devoted himself to the culture of tulips ventured no longer to put  onions in his stews, for fear of pulling to pieces and mincing the idol  of her foster child.    At the mere mention of the dry-room, therefore, the servants who were  carrying the lights respectfully fell back. Cornelius, taking the  candlestick from the hands of the foremost, conducted his godfather into  that room, which was no other than that very cabinet with a glass front  into which Boxtel was continually prying with his telescope.    The envious spy was watching more intently than ever.    First of all he saw the walls and windows lit up.    Then two dark figures appeared.    One of them, tall, majestic, stern, sat down near the table on which Van  Baerle had placed the taper.    In this figure, Boxtel recognised the pale features of Cornelius de  Witt, whose long hair, parted in front, fell over his shoulders.    De Witt, after having said some few words to Cornelius, the meaning of  which the prying neighbour could not read in the movement of his lips,  took from his breast pocket a white parcel, carefully sealed, which  Boxtel, judging from the manner in which Cornelius received it, and  placed it in one of the presses, supposed to contain papers of the  greatest importance.    His first thought was that this precious deposit enclosed some newly  imported bulbs from Bengal or Ceylon; but he soon reflected that  Cornelius de Witt was very little addicted to tulip-growing, and that  he only occupied himself with the affairs of man, a pursuit by far less  peaceful and agreeable than that of the florist. He therefore came to  the conclusion that the parcel contained simply some papers, and that  these papers were relating to politics.    But why should papers of political import be intrusted to Van Baerle,  who not only was, but also boasted of being, an entire stranger to  the science of government, which, in his opinion, was more occult than  alchemy itself?    It was undoubtedly a deposit which Cornelius de Witt, already threatened  by the unpopularity with which his countrymen were going to honour him,  was placing in the hands of his godson; a contrivance so much the more  cleverly devised, as it certainly was not at all likely that it should  be searched for at the house of one who had always stood aloof from  every sort of intrigue.    And, besides, if the parcel had been made up of bulbs, Boxtel knew his  neighbour too well not to expect that Van Baerle would not have lost one  moment in satisfying his curiosity and feasting his eyes on the present  which he had received.    But, on the contrary, Cornelius had received the parcel from the hands  of his godfather with every mark of respect, and put it by with the same  respectful manner in a drawer, stowing it away so that it should not  take up too much of the room which was reserved to his bulbs.    The parcel thus being secreted, Cornelius de Witt got up, pressed the  hand of his godson, and turned towards the door, Van Baerle seizing the  candlestick, and lighting him on his way down to the street, which was  still crowded with people who wished to see their great fellow citizen  getting into his coach.    Boxtel had not been mistaken in his supposition. The deposit intrusted  to Van Baerle, and carefully locked up by him, was nothing more nor less  than John de Witt's correspondence with the Marquis de Louvois, the war  minister of the King of France; only the godfather forbore giving to his  godson the least intimation concerning the political importance of the  secret, merely desiring him not to deliver the parcel to any one but to  himself, or to whomsoever he should send to claim it in his name.    And Van Baerle, as we have seen, locked it up with his most precious  bulbs, to think no more of it, after his godfather had left him; very  unlike Boxtel, who looked upon this parcel as a clever pilot does on the  distant and scarcely perceptible cloud which is increasing on its way  and which is fraught with a storm.    Little dreaming of the jealous hatred of his neighbour, Van Baerle  had proceeded step by step towards gaining the prize offered by the  Horticultural Society of Haarlem. He had progressed from hazel-nut shade  to that of roasted coffee, and on the very day when the frightful events  took place at the Hague which we have related in the preceding chapters,  we find him, about one o'clock in the day, gathering from the border the  young suckers raised from tulips of the colour of roasted coffee; and  which, being expected to flower for the first time in the spring of  1675, would undoubtedly produce the large black tulip required by the  Haarlem Society.    On the 20th of August, 1672, at one o'clock, Cornelius was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9650"],[0,"Independent Bohemia (#11)"],[1,"and  starving of the prisoners. All rights of the prisoners were suspended and  they depended entirely on the will of the commander: many of these  political prisoners were imprisoned together with ordinary murderers; they  were not allowed to read books or to write letters; their families were not  permitted to visit them or even to send them provisions from home, so they  starved in prison. Such cruel treatment did not affect only political  prisoners but even people on remand, and it was nothing extraordinary for  them to be imprisoned for years on remand only. The deputies asked whether  the authorities wanted these prisoners to die from starvation.    The most interesting document is the interpellation of deputies _Stanek,  Tobolka and Co_. on the persecutions against the Czech nation during the  war. The interpellation has been published as a book of 200 pages which has  been prohibited by Austria to be sent abroad, but a copy of which we have  nevertheless been able to secure. The following are short extracts from  the volume:      The Behaviour of the Austrian Government towards the Czech Nation during  the War          \"YOUR EXCELLENCY,--At a time when it proved impossible to continue to      rule in an absolute way in this empire and when after more than three      years the Reichsrat is sitting again, we address to you the following      interpellation in order to call your attention to the persecutions      which during the past three years have been perpetrated on our nation,      and to demand emphatically that these persecutions shall be      discontinued. They were not done unintentionally or accidentally, but,      as will be shown from the following survey, this violence was committed      deliberately and systematically by the Austrian Government on our      nation, which took the abominable view that the present war is the most      suitable period for realising the plans and aims of German centralism      in the Habsburg Monarchy by curing the Czechs forever of all      hallucinations about equality among nations, and about the glorious      past of Bohemia and her relationship with other Slav nations. A general      attack was made upon the Czech nation during the critical situation      created by the war: our participation in civil service was curtailed,      German was made the official language of the state, the press was      muzzled, schools persecuted, the Sokol idea declared to be high      treason, men distinguished for service in the state arrested,      imprisoned, persecuted and sentenced to death, everything reminding the      population of the famous past of Bohemia removed, the ancient Czech      aspirations for political independence or even aims for a mere      reorganisation of the Habsburg Monarchy on a federal basis were not      allowed and were suppressed, even the name of the ancient kingdom of      Bohemia, which was the foundation stone to the Habsburg Monarchy in      1526, was to disappear for ever.        \"The persecutions against our nation were very cruel indeed.        \"In the first place, _Dr. Kramar_ was attacked as the veritable leader      of the Czech nation. In return for his valuable services for this state      and for his nation, in return for his endeavours to educate the Czech      nation towards realism in politics, he was recompensed by being      arrested, imprisoned and sentenced to death, although a member of the      delegations and therefore enjoying immunity. He was not brought up      before the ordinary tribunal, but before a judge who was absolutely      ignorant of Czech or foreign politics, so that his condemnation might      be assured.        \"The same fate also met his political friends, deputy Dr. Rasin and the      editor of _Narodni Listy_, V. Cervinka.        \"Incredible proceedings were taken against the deputy Klofac. Although      being a member of the delegations and therefore enjoying immunity, he      was arrested on September 7, 1914, and has been imprisoned ever since.      A charge was hurriedly prepared against him on May 24, 1917, that is      when the Reichsrat was to be opened. Both Dr. Kramar and Klofac were      prosecuted by the Vienna court-martial under the direction of Colonel      Gliwitzki and Dr. Preminger in such a way that no ordinary judge would      dare to act.        \"The way in which the military tribunals treated the ordinary      uneducated people is apparent from the following examples:        \"The tailor Smejkal in Vienna was sentenced to six months' hard labour      for saying, 'The government does not want to give us Czech schools in      Vienna.'        \"For saying, 'I do not know whether the Emperor Francis Joseph was ever      crowned King of Bohemia or not,' a boy gardener named Tesar was      sentenced to six months' hard labour, which sentence was altered to      sixteen months by the High Court of Justice (the poor boy died in      prison).        \"The shoemaker's assistant Hamouz, of Vienna, sixty-seven years of age,      ill and mentally stunted, served in his youth with the 28th Regiment.      He defended this regiment, therefore, by saying, 'It is a good      regiment.' He was sentenced to six months' imprisonment.        \"Private Cepera from Moravia was sentenced to three years' hard labour      for saying, 'The German Kaiser is responsible for the war.'        \"For saying that 'those of the 28th Regiment are our \"boys,\"' gunner      Purs, of Benatky, was sentenced to four years' imprisonment. He was      sent in chains to the military prison in Moellersdorf.        \"The wilfulness of military tribunals, culminating in many cases in      apparent hatred against everything that is Czech, is shown by the      following, out of many examples:        \"The editor of _Ceske Slovo_, E. Spatny, of Prague, was arrested on      September 26, 1914, and interned in Prague, without being told the      reason. In March, 1915, he was transferred to the internment camp at      Goellersdorf, in Lower Austria. The Czechs interned there arranged on      July 5 a Hus anniversary at which the editor E. Spatny and Dr. Vrbensky      spoke about the life and importance of Hus. Being accused by a certain      fellow-prisoner, Davidovsky, that they had been speaking against the      Germans and that 'the speakers expected deliverance by a certain state      but were disappointed,' they were transferred to the military prison in      Vienna, and charged with high treason according to Par. 58_c_. The      latter was discharged for want of proofs, but the editor Spatny was      sentenced to fourteen years' hard labour.        \"The Sarajevo prisoners were not allowed to be visited by their      relatives in contravention of the orders of the official statutes D 6.      Out of five of those prisoners, three have already died, the fourth is      dying, and the last one, a student Cubulic, was allowed a visit after      two years when it became certain that the Reichsrat would meet.        \"The extent to which starvation and inhuman treatment is raging in the      state prisons is best shown by the conditions prevailing in the prison      of Moellersdorf. In the years 1915-16, 61 prisoners died there out of      350 to 450 prisoners on the roll. Between January 1, 1917, and May,      1917, 101 prisoners were doomed to death. The majority belong to the      sixth category of prisoners. The thieves, criminals and impostors, if      they had served previously in the army, enjoy special treatment in      Moellersdorf prison. They wear civilian clothes, and are treated with      consideration and well fed. On the other hand, political prisoners,      especially those classed as second category, are dying from      ill-treatment and insufficient nourishment. The judge, auditor A.      Koenig, famous for his arbitrary verdicts against the Czech people, was      a solicitor's clerk in civil life, and now recommends to his wealthy      defendants his Vienna lawyer friends as splendid specialists and      advocates in political matters. Thus, for instance, he forced Dr.      Glaser upon Mr. Kotik as the counsel. Kotik was sentenced to death by      Koenig, and Glaser sent him a bill for 10,000 kronen (L400) for the      'successful defence.'    _The Persecutions of the Sokols_        \"Terrible persecutions were inflicted on the Sokol Gymnastic      Association during the war. The sphere of the Sokols' activity does not      touch political affairs at all, being reserved to gymnastics and      spiritual education. Their activity was public, open to official      inquiries and supervision. But this did not save them from      persecutions. The first persecution was already committed in 1914 in      Moravia, when some branches of the Sokol Association were dissolved for      various reasons. Numerous societies were afterwards dissolved      throughout Bohemia and Moravia.        \"_On November_ 23, 1915, _the Central Czech Sokol Association (Ceska      Obec Sokolska) was dissolved_ as the centre of the Czech Sokol      movement, which before the war kept up lively relations with foreign      countries and manifested brotherly feelings of sympathy towards Serbia      and Russia. It was alleged that the Central Sokol Association had had      relations with the American Sokol branches during the war through its      president, Dr. J. Scheiner, and conducted an active propaganda against      Austria. The alleged relations were founded on a communication of the      American branches to the president, Dr. Scheiner, asking him whether he      would be willing to distribute money collected in America to people in      Bohemia afflicted by the war. Dr. Scheiner was arrested and kept in      prison for two months.        \"Very characteristic was the way in which the military authorities      treated the members of Sokol societies.
