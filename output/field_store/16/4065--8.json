[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/956"],[0,"Tik-Tok of Oz (#11)"],[1,"ggedo's Chief Magician  had they known that danger lay in their pathway; for the Rainbow's  Daughter was a fairy and as Oogaboo is a part of the Land of Oz its  inhabitants cannot easily be deceived by such common magic as the Nome  King could command. But no one suspected any especial danger until  after they had entered Ruggedo's cavern, and so they were journeying  along in quite a contented manner when Tik-Tok, who marched ahead,  suddenly disappeared.    The officers thought he must have turned a corner, so they kept on  their way and all of them likewise disappeared--one after another.  Queen Ann was rather surprised at this, and in hastening forward to  learn the reason she also vanished from sight.    Betsy Bobbin had tired her feet by walking, so she was now riding upon  the back of the stout little mule, facing backward and talking to  Shaggy and Polychrome, who were just behind. Suddenly Hank pitched  forward and began falling and Betsy would have tumbled over his head  had she not grabbed the mule's shaggy neck with both arms and held on  for dear life.    All around was darkness, and they were not falling directly downward  but seemed to be sliding along a steep incline. Hank's hoofs were  resting upon some smooth substance over which he slid with the  swiftness of the wind. Once Betsy's heels flew up and struck a similar  substance overhead. They were, indeed, descending the \"Hollow Tube\"  that led to the other side of the world.    \"Stop, Hank--stop!\" cried the girl; but Hank only uttered a plaintive  \"Hee-haw!\" for it was impossible for him to obey.    After several minutes had passed and no harm had befallen them, Betsy  gained courage. She could see nothing at all, nor could she hear  anything except the rush of air past her ears as they plunged downward  along the Tube. Whether she and Hank were alone, or the others were  with them, she could not tell. But had some one been able to take a  flash-light photograph of the Tube at that time a most curious picture  would have resulted. There was Tik-Tok, flat upon his back and sliding  headforemost down the incline. And there were the Officers of the Army  of Oogaboo, all tangled up in a confused crowd, flapping their arms and  trying to shield their faces from the clanking swords, which swung back  and forth during the swift journey and pommeled everyone within their  reach. Now followed Queen Ann, who had struck the Tube in a sitting  position and went flying along with a dash and abandon that thoroughly  bewildered the poor lady, who had no idea what had happened to her.  Then, a little distance away, but unseen by the others in the inky  darkness, slid Betsy and Hank, while behind them were Shaggy and  Polychrome and finally Files and the Princess.    When first they tumbled into the Tube all were too dazed to think  clearly, but the trip was a long one, because the cavity led straight  through the earth to a place just opposite the Nome King's dominions,  and long before the adventurers got to the end they had begun to  recover their wits.    \"This is awful, Hank!\" cried Betsy in a loud voice, and Queen Ann heard  her and called out: \"Are you safe, Betsy?\"    \"Mercy, no!\" answered the little girl. \"How could anyone be safe when  she's going about sixty miles a minute?\" Then, after a pause, she  added: \"But where do you s'pose we're going to, Your Maj'sty?\"    \"Don't ask her that, please don't!\" said Shaggy, who was not too far  away to overhear them. \"And please don't ask me why, either.\"    \"Why?\" said Betsy.    \"No one can tell where we are going until we get there,\" replied  Shaggy, and then he yelled \"Ouch!\" for Polychrome had overtaken him and  was now sitting on his head.    The Rainbow's Daughter laughed merrily, and so infectious was this  joyous laugh that Betsy echoed it and Hank said \"Hee haw!\" in a mild  and sympathetic tone of voice.    \"I'd like to know where and when we'll arrive, just the same,\"  exclaimed the little girl.    \"Be patient and you'll find out, my dear,\" said Polychrome. \"But isn't  this an odd experience? Here am I, whose home is in the skies, making a  journey through the center of the earth--where I never expected to be!\"    \"How do you know we're in the center of the earth?\" asked Betsy, her  voice trembling a little through nervousness.    \"Why, we can t be anywhere else,\" replied Polychrome. \"I have often  heard of this passage, which was once built by a Magician who was a  great traveler. He thought it would save him the bother of going around  the earth's surface, but he tumbled through the Tube so fast that he  shot out at the other end and hit a star in the sky, which at once  exploded.\"    \"The star exploded?\" asked Betsy wonderingly.    \"Yes; the Magician hit it so hard.\"    \"And what became of the Magician?\" inquired the girl.    \"No one knows that,\" answered Polychrome. \"But I don't think it matters  much.\"    \"It matters a good deal, if we also hit the stars when we come out,\"  said Queen Ann, with a moan.    \"Don't worry,\" advised Polychrome. \"I believe the Magician was going  the other way, and probably he went much faster than we are going.\"    \"It's fast enough to suit me,\" remarked Shaggy, gently removing  Polychrome's heel from his left eye. \"Couldn't you manage to fall all  by yourself, my dear?\"    \"I'll try,\" laughed the Rainbow's Daughter.    All this time they were swiftly falling through the Tube, and it was  not so easy for them to talk as you may imagine when you read their  words. But although they were so helpless and altogether in the dark as  to their fate, the fact that they were able to converse at all cheered  them, considerably.    Files and Ozga were also conversing as they clung tightly to one  another, and the young fellow bravely strove to reassure the Princess,  although he was terribly frightened, both on her account and on his own.    An hour, under such trying circumstances, is a very long time, and for  more than an hour they continued their fearful journey. Then, just as  they began to fear the Tube would never end, Tik-Tok popped out into  broad daylight and, after making a graceful circle in the air, fell  with a splash into a great marble fountain.    Out came the officers, in quick succession, tumbling heels over head  and striking the ground in many undignified attitudes.    \"For the love of sassafras!\" exclaimed a Peculiar Person who was hoeing  pink violets in a garden. \"What can all this mean?\"    For answer, Queen Ann sailed up from the Tube, took a ride through the  air as high as the treetops, and alighted squarely on top of the  Peculiar Person's head, smashing a jeweled crown over his eyes and  tumbling him to the ground.    The mule was heavier and had Betsy clinging to his back, so he did not  go so high up. Fortunately for his little rider he struck the ground  upon his four feet. Betsy was jarred a trifle but not hurt and when she  looked around her she saw the Queen and the Peculiar Person struggling  together upon the ground, where the man was trying to choke Ann and she  had both hands in his bushy hair and was pulling with all her might.  Some of the officers, when they got upon their feet, hastened to  separate the combatants and sought to restrain the Peculiar Person so  that he could not attack their Queen again.    By this time, Shaggy, Polychrome, Ozga and Files had all arrived and  were curiously examining the strange country in which they found  themselves and which they knew to be exactly on the opposite side of  the world from the place where they had fallen into the Tube. It was a  lovely place, indeed, and seemed to be the garden of some great Prince,  for through the vistas of trees and shrubbery could be seen the towers  of an immense castle. But as yet the only inhabitant to greet them was  the Peculiar Person just mentioned, who had shaken off the grasp of the  officers without effort and was now trying to pull the battered crown  from off his eyes.    Shaggy, who was always polite, helped him to do this and when the man  was free and could see again he looked at his visitors with evident  amazement.    \"Well, well, well!\" he exclaimed. \"Where did you come from and how did  you get here?\"    Betsy tried to answer him, for Queen Ann was surly and silent.    \"I can't say, exac'ly where we came from, 'cause I don't know the name  of the place,\" said the girl, \"but the way we got here was through the  Hollow Tube.\"    \"Don't call it a 'hollow' Tube, please,\" exclaimed the Peculiar Person  in an irritated tone of voice. \"If it's a tube, it's sure to be hollow.\"    \"Why?\" asked Betsy.    \"Because all tubes are made that way. But this Tube is private property  and everyone is forbidden to fall into it.\"    \"We didn't do it on purpose,\" explained Betsy, and Polychrome added: \"I  am quite sure that Ruggedo, the Nome King, pushed us down that Tube.\"    \"Ha! Ruggedo! Did  you say Ruggedo?\" cried the man, becoming much  excited.    \"That is what she said,\" replied Shaggy, \"and I believe she is right.  We were on our way to conquer the Nome King when suddenly we fell into  the Tube.\"    \"Then you are enemies of Ruggedo?\" inquired the peculiar Person.    \"Not exac'ly enemies,\" said Betsy, a little puzzled by the question,  \"'cause we don't know him at all; but we started out to conquer him,  which isn't as friendly as it might be.\"    \"True,\" agreed the man. He looked thoughtfully from one to another of  them for a while and then he turned his head over his shoulder and  said: \"Never mind the fire and pincers, my good brothers. It will be  best to take these strangers to the Private Citizen.\"    \"Very well, Tubekins,\" responded a Voice, deep and powerful, that  seemed to come out of the air, for the speaker was invisible.    All our friends gave a jump, at this. Even Polychrome was so startled  that her gauze draperies fluttered like a banner in a breeze. Shaggy  shook his head and sighed; Queen Ann looked very unhappy; the officers  clung to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/957"],[0,"The Scarecrow of Oz (#11)"],[1,"favor, but it's the only way we can think of--excep' walkin',  an' I'm not much good at that because I've a wooden leg. Besides, Trot  an' Button-Bright are too small to undertake a long and tiresome  journey. Now, tell me: Which three of you birds will consent to carry  us?\"    The birds looked at one another as if greatly astonished. Then one of  them replied: \"You must be crazy, old man. Not one of us is big enough  to fly with even the smallest of your party.\"    \"I'll fix the matter of size,\" promised Cap'n Bill. \"If three of you  will agree to carry us, I'll make you big an' strong enough to do it,  so it won't worry you a bit.\"    The birds considered this gravely.  Living in a magic country, they had  no doubt but that the strange one-legged man could do what he said.  After a little, one of them asked:    \"If you make us big, would we stay big always?\"    \"I think so,\" replied Cap'n Bill.    They chattered a while among themselves and then the bird that had  first spoken said: \"I'll go, for one.\"    \"So will I,\" said another; and after a pause a third said: \"I'll go,  too.\"    Perhaps more would have volunteered, for it seemed that for some reason  they all longed to be bigger than they were; but three were enough for  Cap'n Bill's purpose and so he promptly released all the others, who  immediately flew away.    The three that remained were cousins, and all were of the same  brilliant plumage and in size about as large as eagles. When Trot  questioned them she found they were quite young, having only abandoned  their nests a few weeks before. They were strong young birds, with  clear, brave eyes, and the little girl decided they were the most  beautiful of all the feathered creatures she had ever seen.    Cap'n Bill now took from his pocket the wooden box with the sliding  cover and removed the three purple berries, which were still in good  condition.    \"Eat these,\" he said, and gave one to each of the birds. They obeyed,  finding the fruit very pleasant to taste. In a few seconds they began  to grow in size and grew so fast that Trot feared they would never  stop. But they finally did stop growing, and then they were much larger  than the Ork, and nearly the size of full-grown ostriches.    Cap'n Bill was much pleased by this result.    \"You can carry us now, all right,\" said he.    The birds strutted around with pride, highly pleased with their immense  size.    \"I don't see, though,\" said Trot doubtfully, \"how we're going to ride  on their backs without falling off.\"    \"We're not going to ride on their backs,\" answered Cap'n Bill. \"I'm  going to make swings for us to ride in.\"    He then asked the Bumpy Man for some rope, but the man had no rope. He  had, however, an old suit of gray clothes which he gladly presented to  Cap'n Bill, who cut the cloth into strips and twisted it so that it was  almost as strong as rope. With this material he attached to each bird a  swing that dangled below its feet, and Button-Bright made a trial  flight in one of them to prove that it was safe and comfortable. When  all this had been arranged one of the birds asked:    \"Where do you wish us to take you?\"    \"Why, just follow the Ork,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"He will be our leader,  and wherever the Ork flies you are to fly, and wherever the Ork lands  you are to land. Is that satisfactory?\"    The birds declared it was quite satisfactory, so Cap'n Bill took  counsel with the Ork.    \"On our way here,\" said that peculiar creature, \"I noticed a broad,  sandy desert at the left of me, on which was no living thing.\"    \"Then we'd better keep away from it,\" replied the sailor.    \"Not so,\" insisted the Ork. \"I have found, on my travels, that the most  pleasant countries often lie in the midst of deserts; so I think it  would be wise for us to fly over this desert and discover what lies  beyond it. For in the direction we came from lies the ocean, as we well  know, and beyond here is this strange Land of Mo, which we do not care  to explore. On one side, as we can see from this mountain, is a broad  expanse of plain, and on the other the desert.  For my part, I vote for  the desert.\"    \"What do you say, Trot?\" inquired Cap'n Bill.    \"It's all the same to me,\" she replied.    No one thought of asking Button-Bright's opinion, so it was decided to  fly over the desert. They bade good-bye to the Bumpy Man and thanked  him for his kindness and hospitality. Then they seated themselves in  the swings--one for each bird--and told the Ork to start away and they  would follow.    The whirl of the Ork's tail astonished the birds at first, but after he  had gone a short distance they rose in the air, carrying their  passengers easily, and flew with strong, regular strokes of their great  wings in the wake of their leader.          Chapter Nine    The Kingdom of Jinxland      Trot rode with more comfort than she had expected, although the swing  swayed so much that she had to hold on tight with both hands. Cap'n  Bill's bird followed the Ork, and Trot came next, with Button-Bright  trailing behind her. It was quite an imposing procession, but  unfortunately there was no one to see it, for the Ork had headed  straight for the great sandy desert and in a few minutes after starting  they were flying high over the broad waste, where no living thing could  exist.    The little girl thought this would be a bad place for the birds to lose  strength, or for the cloth ropes to give way; but although she could  not help feeling a trifle nervous and fidgety she had confidence in the  huge and brilliantly plumaged bird that bore her, as well as in Cap'n  Bill's knowledge of how to twist and fasten a rope so it would hold.    That was a remarkably big desert. There was nothing to relieve the  monotony of view and every minute seemed an hour and every hour a day.  Disagreeable fumes and gases rose from the sands, which would have been  deadly to the travelers had they not been so high in the air. As it  was, Trot was beginning to feel sick, when a breath of fresher air  filled her nostrils and on looking ahead she saw a great cloud of  pink-tinted mist. Even while she wondered what it could be, the Ork  plunged boldly into the mist and the other birds followed. She could  see nothing for a time, nor could the bird which carried her see where  the Ork had gone, but it kept flying as sturdily as ever and in a few  moments the mist was passed and the girl saw a most beautiful landscape  spread out below her, extending as far as her eye could reach.    She saw bits of forest, verdure clothed hills, fields of waving grain,  fountains, rivers and lakes; and throughout the scene were scattered  groups of pretty houses and a few grand castles and palaces.    Over all this delightful landscape--which from Trot's high perch seemed  like a magnificent painted picture--was a rosy glow such as we  sometimes see in the west at sunset. In this case, however, it was not  in the west only, but everywhere.    No wonder the Ork paused to circle slowly over this lovely country. The  other birds followed his action, all eyeing the place with equal  delight. Then, as with one accord, the four formed a group and slowly  sailed downward. This brought them to that part of the newly-discovered  land which bordered on the desert's edge; but it was just as pretty  here as anywhere, so the Ork and the birds alighted and the three  passengers at once got out of their swings.    \"Oh, Cap'n Bill, isn't this fine an' dandy?\" exclaimed Trot  rapturously. \"How lucky we were to discover this beautiful country!\"    \"The country seems rather high class, I'll admit, Trot,\" replied the  old sailor-man, looking around him, \"but we don't know, as yet, what  its people are like.\"    \"No one could live in such a country without being happy and good--I'm  sure of that,\" she said earnestly. \"Don't you think so, Button-Bright?\"    \"I'm not thinking, just now,\" answered the little boy. \"It tires me to  think, and I never seem to gain anything by it. When we see the people  who live here we will know what they are like, and no 'mount of  thinking will make them any different.\"    \"That's true enough,\" said the Ork. \"But now I want to make a proposal.  While you are getting acquainted with this new country, which looks as  if it contains everything to make one happy, I would like to fly  along--all by myself--and see if I can find my home on the other side  of the great desert. If I do, I will stay there, of course. But if I  fail to find Orkland I will return to you in a week, to see if I can do  anything more to assist you.\"    They were sorry to lose their queer companion, but could offer no  objection to the plan; so the Ork bade them good-bye and rising swiftly  in the air, he flew over the country and was soon lost to view in the  distance.    The three birds which had carried our friends now begged permission to  return by the way they had come, to their own homes, saying they were  anxious to show their families how big they had become. So Cap'n Bill  and Trot and Button-Bright all thanked them gratefully for their  assistance and soon the birds began their long flight toward the Land  of Mo. Being now left to themselves in this strange land, the three  comrades selected a pretty pathway and began walking along it. They  believed this path would lead them to a splendid castle which they  espied in the distance, the turrets of which towered far above the tops  of the trees which surrounded it. It did not seem very far away, so  they sauntered on slowly, admiring the beautiful ferns and flowers that  lined the pathway and listening to the singing of the birds and the  soft chirping of the grasshoppers.    Presently the path wound over a little hill. In a valley that lay  beyond the hill was a tiny cottage surrounded by flower beds and fruit  trees. On the shady porch of the cottage they saw, as they approached,  a pleasant faced woman sitting amidst a group of children, to whom she"]]]
