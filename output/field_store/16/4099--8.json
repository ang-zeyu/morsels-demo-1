[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10479"],[0,"Our Churches and Chapels: Their Parsons, Priests, & Congregations (#12)"],[1,"  Augustine's \"district\" is a very large one; it embraces 8,000 or  9,000 persons, and their characters, like their faces, are of every  colour and size. Much honest industry, much straight-forwardness and  every day kindness, much that smells of gin, and rascality, and  heathenism may be seen in the district. There is plenty of room for  all kinds of reformers in the locality; and if any man can do any  good in it, whatever may be his creed or theory, let him do it. The  priests in connection with St. Augustine's Catholic Church are doing  their share in this matter, and it is about them, their church, and  their congregation that we have now a few words to say. The church  we name is not a very old one. It was formally projected in 1836;  the first stone of it was laid on the 13th of November, 1838; and it  was opened on the 30th of July, 1840, by Dr. Briggs, afterwards  first bishop of the Catholic diocese of Beverley. It has a plain yet  rather stately exterior. Nothing fanciful, nor tinselled, nor  masonically smart characterises it. Four large stone pillars,  flanked with walls of the same material surmounted with brick, a  flight of steps, a portico, a broad gable with massive coping, and a  central ornament at the angle, are all which the facade presents.  The doors are lateral, and are left open from morning till night  three hundred and sixty-five days every year.    The interior of the church is spacious, wonderfully clean, and  decorated at the high altar end in most tasteful style. We have not  inquired whether charity begins at home or not in this place;  perhaps it does not; but it is certain that painting does; for all  the fine colouring, with its many formed classical devices, at the  sanctuary was executed by one of the members of the congregation.  The principal altar is a very fine one, and a fair amount of pious  pleasure may be derived from looking at a tremendous pastoral  candlestick which stands on one side. It is, when charged with a  full-sized candle, perhaps five feet ten high, and it has a very  patriarchal and decorous appearance--looks grave and authoritative,  and seems to think itself a very important affair. And it has a  perfect right to its opinion. We should like to see it in a  procession, with Zaccheus, the sacristian, carrying it. Three fine  paintings, which however seem to have lost their colour somewhat,  are placed in the particular part of the church we are now at. The  central one represents the \"Adoration of the Magi,\" and was painted  and given by Mr. H. Taylor Bulmer, who formerly resided in Preston.  The second picture to the left is a representation of \"Christ's  agony in the Garden;\" and the third on the opposite side is \"Christ  carrying the Cross.\" In front of the altar there is the usual lamp  with a crimson spirit flame, burning day and night, and reminding  one of the old vestal light, watched by Roman virgins, who were  whipped in the dark by a wrathful pontifex if they ever let it go  out. At the northern end of the church there is a large gallery,  with one of the neatest artistic designs in front of it we ever saw.  The side walls are surmounted with a chaste frieze, and running  towards the base are \"stations\" and statues of saints. A small altar  within a screen, surmounted with statuary, is placed on each side of  the sanctuary, and not far from one of them there is a bright  painting which looks well at a distance, but nothing extra two yards  off. It represents Christ preaching out of a boat to some Galileans,  amongst whom may be seen the Rev. Canon Walker. If the painting is  correct, the worthy canon has deteriorated none by age, for he seems  to look just as like himself now as he did eighteen hundred years  since, and to be not a morsel fonder of spectacles and good snuff  now than he was then. His insertion, however, into this picture, was  a whim of the artist, whose cosmopolitan theory led him to believe  that one man is, as a rule, quite as good as another, and that  paintings are always appreciated best when they refer to people whom  you know.    There are three of those very terrible places called confessionals  at St. Augustine's, and one day not so long since we visited all of  them. It is enough for an ordinary sinner to patronise one  confessional in a week, or a month, or a quarter of a year, and then  go home and try to behave himself. But we went to three in one  forenoon with a priest, afterwards had the courage to get into the  very centre of a neighbouring building wherein were two and twenty  nuns, and then reciprocated compliments with an amiable young lady  called the \"Mother Superior.\" Terrible places to enter, and most  unworldly people to visit, we fancy some of our Protestant friends  will say; but we saw nothing very agonising or dreadful--not even in  the confessionals. Like other folk we had heard grim tales about,  such places--about trap doors, whips, manacles, and all sorts of  cruel oddities; but in the confessionals visited we beheld nothing  of any of them. Number one is a very small apartment, perhaps two  yards square, with a seat and a couple of sacred pictures in it. In  front there is an aperture filled in with a slender grating and  backed by a curtain which can be removed at pleasure by the priest  who officiates behind. On one side of the grating there is a small  space like a letter-box slip, and through this communications in  writing, of various dimensions, are handed. Everything is plain and  simple where the penitent is located; and the apartment behind,  occupied by the priest who hears confession, is equally simple.  There is no weird paraphernalia, no mysterious contrivances, no  bolts, bars, pullies, or strings for either working miracles, or  making the hair of sinners stand on end. Number two confessional is  similarly arranged and equally plain. We examined this rather more  minutely than the other, and whilst we could find nothing dreadful  in the penitents' apartment, we fancied, on entering the priest's  side, that, we had met with something belonging the realm of  confessional torture as depicted by the Hogans, Murphys, and Maria  Monk showmen, and which the officials had forgot to put by in some  of their secret drawers. It was hung upon a nail, had a semi-  circular, half viperish look, and was cupped at each end as if  intended for some curious business of incision or absorption. We  were relieved on getting nearer it and on being informed that it was  merely an ear trumpet through which questions have to be put to deaf  penitents who now and then turn up for general unravelment and  absolution. The two confessionals described are contiguous to a  passage at the rear of the church; the third we are now coming to is  near one of the subsidiary altars, nod looks specifically snug. It  is a particularly small confessional, and a very stout penitent  would find it as difficult to get into it as to reveal all his sins  afterwards. There is nothing either harrowing or cabalistic in the  place; and you can see nothing but two forms, a screen, and a  crucifix.    There are many services at St. Augustine's. On Monday mornings at a  quarter past seven, and again at half-past eight, mass is said; on  Tuesdays and Thursdays there is benediction at half-past seven; on  Fridays and Saturdays and on the eve of holidays there is  confession; on Sundays there is mass at half-past seven, half-past  eight, half-past nine, and at 11, when regular service takes place;  on Sunday afternoons, at three, the children are instructed, and at  half-past six in the evening there are vespers, a sermon, and  benediction. The church has a capacity for about 1,000 persons,  without crushing. The average number hearing mass on a Sunday is  3,290. On four consecutive Sundays recently--from February 14 to  March 14--upwards of 13,100 heard mass within the walls of the  church.    The congregation is almost entirely made up of working people. A few  middle class and wealthy persons attend the place--some sitting in  the gallery, and others at the higher end of the church--but the  general body consists of toiling every-day folk. The poorest  section, including the Irish--who, in every Catholic Church, do a  great stroke of business on a Sunday with holy water, beads and  crucifixes--are located in the rear. It is a source of sacred  pleasure to quietly watch some of these poor yet curious beings.  They are all amazingly in earnest while the fit is on them; they  bow, and kneel, and make hand motions with a dexterity which nothing  but long years of practice could ensure; and they drive on with  their prayers in a style which, whatever may be the character of its  sincerity, has certainly the merit of fastness. How to get through  the greatest number of words in the shortest possible time may be a  problem which they are trying, to solve. The great bulk of the  congregation are calm and unostentatious, evincing a quiet demeanour  in conjunction with a determined devotion. There are several very  excellent sleepers in the multitude of worshippers; but they are  mainly at the entrance end where they are least seen. We happened to  be at the church the other Sunday morning and in ten minutes after  the sermon had been commenced about 16 persons, all within a  moderate space, were fast asleep. Their number increased slowly till  the conclusion. Several appeared to be struggling very severely  against the Morphean deity dining the whole service; a few might be  seen at intervals rescuing themselves from his grasp--getting upon  the very edge of a snooze, starting suddenly with a shake and waking  up, dropping down their heads to a certain point of calmness and  then retracing their steps to consciousness.    There are five men at St. Augustine's called collectors--parties who  show strangers, &c., their seats, and look after the pennies which  attendants have to pay on taking them. Not one of these collectors  has"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10484"],[0,"Beacon Lights of History, Volume 03: Ancient Achievements (#12)"],[1,"outline of the moulding is a gracefully flowing cyma, or  wave, concave at one end and convex at the other, like an Italic _f_,  the concavity and convexity being exactly in the same curve, according  to the line of beauty which Hogarth describes.    The most beautiful application of Greek architecture was in the temples,  which were very numerous and of extraordinary grandeur, long before the  Persian War. Their entrance was always from the west or the east. They  were built either in an oblong or round form, and were mostly adorned  with columns. Those of an oblong form had columns either in the front  alone, or in the eastern and western fronts, or on all the four sides.  They generally had porticos attached to them, and were without windows,  receiving their light from the door or from above. The friezes were  adorned with various sculptures, as were sometimes the pediments, and no  expense was spared upon them. The most important part of the temple was  the cell (_cella,_ or temple proper, a square chamber), in which the  statue of the deity was kept, generally surrounded with a balustrade. In  front of the cella was the vestibule, and in the rear or back a chamber  in which the treasures of the temple were kept. Names were applied to  the temples as well as to the porticos, according to the number of  columns in the portico at either end of the temple,--such as the  tetrastyle (four columns in front), or hexastyle (when there were six).  There were never more than ten columns across the front. The Parthenon  had eight, but six was the usual number. It was the rule to have twice  as many columns along the sides as in front. Some of the temples had  double rows of columns on all sides, like that of Diana at Ephesus and  of Quirinus at Rome. The distance between the columns varied from one  diameter and a half to four diameters. About five eighths of a Doric  temple were occupied by the cella, and three eighths by the portico.    That which gives to the Greek temples so much simplicity and  harmony,--the great elements of beauty in architecture,--is the simple  outline in parallelogrammic and pyramidal forms, in which the lines are  uninterrupted through their entire length. This simplicity and harmony  are more apparent in the Doric than in any of the other orders, but  pertain to all the Grecian temples of which we have knowledge. The Ionic  and Corinthian, or the voluted and foliated orders, do not possess that  severe harmony which pervades the Doric; but the more beautiful  compositions are so consummate that they will ever be taken as models  of study.    There is now no doubt that the exteriors of the Grecian temples were  ornamented in color,--perhaps with historical pictures, etc.,--although  as the traces have mostly disappeared it is impossible to know the  extent or mode of decoration. It has been thought that the mouldings  also may have been gilded or colored, and that the background of the  sculptures had some flat color laid on as a relief to the raised  figures. We may be sure, however it was done, that the effect was not  gaudy or crude, but restrained within the limits of refinement and good  taste by the infallible artistic instinct of those masters of the  beautiful.    It is not the magnitude of the Greek temples and other works of art  which most impresses us. It is not for this that they are important  models; it is not for this that they are copied and reproduced in all  the modern nations of Europe. They were generally small compared with  the temples of Egypt, and with the vast dimensions of Roman  amphitheatres; only three or four would compare in size with a Gothic  cathedral,--the Parthenon, the Temple of Olympian Zeus at Athens, and  the Temple of Diana at Ephesus; even the Pantheon at Rome is small,  compared with the later monuments of the Caesars. The traveller is  always disappointed in contemplating the ruins of Greek buildings so far  as size is concerned. But it is their matchless proportions, their  severe symmetry, the grandeur of effect, the undying beauty, the  graceful form which impress us, and make us feel that they are perfect.  By the side of the Colosseum they are insignificant in magnitude; they  do not cover acres, like the baths of Caracalla. Yet who has copied the  Flavian amphitheatre; who erects an edifice after the style of the  Thermae? All artists, however, copy the Parthenon. That, and not the  colossal monuments of the Caesars, reappears in the capitals of Europe,  and stimulates the genius of a Michael Angelo or a Christopher Wren.    The flourishing period of Greek architecture was during the period from  Pericles to Alexander,--one hundred and thirteen years. The Macedonian  conquest introduced more magnificence and less simplicity. The Roman  conquest accelerated the decline in severe taste, when different orders  began to be used indiscriminately.    In this state the art passed into the hands of the masters of the world,  and they inaugurated a new era in architecture. The art was still  essentially Greek, although the Romans derived their first knowledge  from the Etruscans. The Cloaca Maxima, or Great Sewer, was built during  the reign of the second Tarquin,--the grandest monument of the reign of  the kings. It is not probable that temples and other public buildings in  Rome were either beautiful or magnificent until the conquest of Greece,  after which Grecian architects were employed. The Romans adopted the  Corinthian style, which they made even more ornamental; and by the  successful combination of the Etruscan arch with the Grecian column they  laid the foundation of a new and original style, susceptible of great  variety and magnificence. They entered into architecture with the  enthusiasm of their teachers, but in their passion for novelty lost  sight of the simplicity which is the great fascination of a Doric  temple. Says Memes:--    \"They [the Romans] deemed that lightness and grace were to be attained  not so much by proportion between the vertical and the horizontal as by  the comparative slenderness of the former. Hence we see a poverty in  Roman architecture in the midst of profuse ornament. The great error was  a constant aim to lessen the diameter while they increased the elevation  of the columns. Hence the massive simplicity and severe grandeur of the  ancient Doric disappear in the Roman, the characteristics of the order  being frittered down into a multiplicity of minute details.\"    When the Romans used the Doric at all, they used a base for the column,  which was never done at Athens. They also altered the Doric capital,  which cannot be improved. Again, most of the Grecian Doric temples were  peripteral,--surrounded with pillars on all the sides. But the Romans  built with porticos on one front only, which had a greater projection  than the Grecian. They generally were projected three columns, while the  Greek portico had usually but a single row. Many of the Roman temples  are circular, like the Pantheon, which has a portico of eight columns  projected to the depth of three. Nor did the Romans construct hypaethral  or uncovered temples with internal columns, like the Greeks. The  Pantheon is an exception, since the dome has an open eye; and one great  ornament of this beautiful structure is in the arrangement of internal  columns placed in the front of niches, composed of antae, or pier-formed  ends of walls, to carry an entablature round under an attic on which the  cupola rests. The Romans also adopted coupled columns, broken and  recessed entablatures, and pedestals, which are considered blemishes.  They again paid more attention to the interior than to the exterior  decoration of their palaces and baths,--as we may infer from the ruins  of Hadrian's villa at Tivoli and the excavations of Pompeii.    The pediments (roof-angles) used in Roman architectural works are  steeper than those made by the Greeks, varying in inclination from  eighteen to twenty-five degrees, instead of fourteen. The mouldings are  the same as the Grecian in general form, although they differ from them  in contour; they are less delicate and graceful, but were used in great  profusion. Roman architecture is overdone with ornament, every moulding  carved, and every straight surface sculptured with foliage or historical  subjects in relief. The ornaments of the frieze consist of foliage and  animals, with a variety of other things. The great exuberance of  ornament is considered a defect, although when applied to some  structures it is exceedingly beautiful. In the time of the first Caesars  Roman architecture had, from the huge size of the buildings, a character  of grandeur and magnificence. Columns and arches appeared in all the  leading public buildings,--columns generally forming the external and  arches the internal construction. Fabric after fabric arose on the ruins  of others. The Flavii supplanted the edifices of Nero, which ministered  to debauchery, by structures of public utility.    The Romans invented no new principle in architecture, unless it be the  arch, which was known, though not practically applied, by the Assyrians,  Egyptians, and Greeks. The Romans were a practical and utilitarian  people, and needed for their various structures greater economy of  material than was compatible with large blocks of stone, especially for  such as were carried to great altitudes. The arch supplied this want,  and is perhaps the greatest invention ever made in architecture. No  instance of its adoption occurs in the construction of Greek edifices  before Greece became a part of the Roman empire. Its application dates  back to the Cloaca Maxima, and may have been of Etrurian invention. Some  maintain that Archimedes of Sicily was the inventor of the arch; but to  whomsoever the glory of the invention is due, it is certain that the  Romans were the first of European nations to make a practical  application of its wonderful qualities.
