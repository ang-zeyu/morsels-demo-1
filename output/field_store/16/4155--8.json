Art, Brady.]           *       *       *       *       *          GEORGE STEPNEY, Esq;      This poet was descended of the family of the Stepneys of Pindigrast in  Pembrokeshire, but born in Westminster in the year 1693. He received  the rudiments of his education in Westminster school, and after making  some progress in literature there, he was removed to Trinity College  in Cambridge, where he was cotemporary with Charles Montague, esq;  afterwards earl of Halifax; and being of the same college with him,  a very strict friendship was contracted between them. To this lucky  accident of being early known to Mr. Montague, was owing all the  preferment Mr. Stepney afterwards enjoyed; for he seems not to have  had parts sufficient to have risen to any distinction, without the  immediate patronage of so great a man, as the lord Hallifax. When  Stepney first set out in life, he was perhaps attached to the Tory  interest, for one of the first poems he wrote, was an Address to  king James the Second, on his Accession to the Throne. In this little  piece, in which there is as little poetry, he compares that monarch to  Hercules, but with what propriety let the reader judge. Soon after  the accession of James II. when Monmouth's rebellion broke out, the  university of Cambridge, to demonstrate their zeal for the King,  thought proper to burn the picture of that rash Prince, who had  formerly been their chancellor. Upon this occasion Stepney wrote some  good verses, in answer to this question;      ----Sed quid    Turba Remi? sequitur fortunam, ut semper    et odit damnatos.    Upon the revolution he embraced another interest, and procured himself  to be nominated for several foreign embassies. In the year 1692 he  went to the elector of Brandenburgh's court in quality of envoy, and,  in the year following, to the Imperial court in the same character. In  1694 he was sent to the elector of Saxony, and two years after to the  electors of Mentz, Cologn, &c. and the congress at Francfort. He was  employed in several other embassies, and in the year 1706 Queen Anne  sent him envoy to the States General. He was very successful in his  negotiations, which occasioned his constant employment in the most  weighty affairs. At his leisure hours he composed several other pieces  of poetry besides those already mentioned; which are chiefly these,      An Epistle to the Earl of Hallifax, on his Majesty's    Voyage to Holland.      A Translation of the Eighth Satire of Juvenal.      To the Earl of Carlisle upon the Death of his    Son.      Some Imitations of Horace's Odes.      The Austrian Eagle.      The Nature of Dreams.      A Poem to the Memory of Queen Mary.    These performances are not very long, nor are the subjects upon  which they are written very considerable. It seems probable that the  eminence to which Stepney rose, must have been more owing to some  personal kindness lord Hallifax had for him, than to his merit as a  writer. In raising Stepney, his lordship might act as the friend  of the man, but not as a patron of the poet. Friendship, in many  respects, participates of the nature of love; it begins, we know  not how, it strengthens by imperceptible degrees, and grows into an  established firmness. Such might be the regard lord Hallifax had for  Stepney, but we may venture to assert, from his lordship's exquisite  taste in poetry, that he never could highly admire the pretty trifles  which compose the works of this author; and which are printed amongst  the works of the Minor Poets, published some years ago by Mr. Tonson  in two volumes 12mo.[A]    Our author died at Chelsea in the year 1707, and was buried in  Westminster-Abbey, where a fine monument is erected over him, with the  following inscription upon the pedestal;      H.S.E.      GEORGIUS STEPNEIUS, Armiger,      viz.

On the right hand is a particular account of all his employments  abroad.    As a specimen of Mr. Stepney's poetry, we shall quote the following  lines on the Nature of Dreams,      At dead of night imperial reason sleeps,    And fancy with her train loose revels keeps:    Then airy phantoms a mixt scene display,    Of what we heard, or saw, or wish'd by day;    For memory those images retains    Which passion form'd, and still the strongest reigns,    Huntsmen renew the chase they lately run;    And generals fight again their battles won.    Spectres and furies haunt the murth'rers dreams;    Grants, or disgraces, are the courtiers themes.    The miser spies a thief, or some new hoard,    The cit's a knight, the sycophant a lord.    Thus fancy's in the wild distraction lost    With what we most abhor, or covet most.    But of all passions that our dreams controul,    Love prints the deepest image in the soul;    For vigorous fancy, and warm blood dispense    Pleasures so lively, that they rival sense.    Such are the transports of a willing maid,    Not yet by time and place to act betray'd.    Whom spies, or some faint virtue force to fly    That scene of joy, which yet she dies to try.    'Till fancy bawds, and by mysterious charms    Brings the dear object to her longing arms;    Unguarded then she melts, acts fierce delight,    And curses the returns of envious light.    In such bless'd dreams Biblis enjoys a flame;    Which waking she detests, and dares not name.    Ixion gives a loose to his wild love,    And in his airy visions cuckolds Jove.    Honours and state before this phantom fall;    For sleep, like death its image, equals all.    Our author likewise wrote some political pieces in prose, particularly  an Essay on the present Interest of England, 1701. To which are added,  The Proceedings of the House of Commons in 1677, upon the French  King's Progress in Flanders. This piece is reprinted in Cogan's  Collection of Tracts, called Lord Somers's Collection.      [Footnote A: And likewise of another work of the same kind, in two  volumes also, published by one Cogan.]           *       *       *       *       *          Major RICHARDSON PACK,      This gentleman was the son of John Pack, of Stocke-Ash in Suffolk,  esq; who in the year 1697 was high sheriff of that county. He had  his early education at a private country school, and was removed from  thence to Merchant Taylor's, where he received his first taste of  letters; for he always reckoned that time which he spent at the former  school as lost, since he had only contracted bad habits, and was  obliged to unlearn what had been taught him there.    At the age of sixteen he was removed to St. John's College in Oxford.  About eighteen his father entered him of the Middle Temple, designing  him for the profession of the Law; and by the peculiar indulgence  of the treasurer, and benchers of that honourable society, he was at  eight Terms standing admitted barrister, when he had not much exceeded  the age of 20. But a sedentary studious life agreeing as ill with his  health, as a formal one with his inclinations, he did not long  pursue those studies. After some wavering in his thoughts, he at last  determined his views to the army, as being better suited to the gaiety  of his temper, and the sprightliness of his genius, and where he hoped  to meet with more freedom, as well as more action. His first command  was that of a company of foot in March 1705. In November 1710 the  regiment in which he served was one of those two of English foot, that  were with the marshal Staremberg at the battle of Villa Viciosa, the  day after general Stanhope, and the troops under his command were  taken at Brighuega[A], where the major being killed, and our author's  behaviour being equal to the occasion on which he acted, his grace the  duke of Argyle confirmed his pretensions to that vacancy, by giving  him the commission of the deceased major, immediately on his arrival  in Spain. It was this accident which first introduced our gallant  soldier to the acquaintance of that truly noble and excellent person,  with whose protection and patronage he was honoured during the  remaining part of his life.    The ambition he had to celebrate his grace's heroic virtues (at a  time when there subsisted a jealousy between him and the duke of  Marlborough, and it was fashionable by a certain party to traduce him)  gave birth to some of the best of his performances.    What other pieces the major has written in verse, are, for the most  part,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12019"],[0,"Queen Hortense: A Life Picture of the Napoleonic Era (#12)"],[1," into the world of society, and every  one who knows her speaks well of her. I confess, Bourrienne, that the  sight of her moved me deeply, and the sobbing of those two poor children  made me sad as well. I said to myself, 'Shall they be the victims of  their mother's fault?' I called Eugene back. Hortense turned round and,  along with Josephine, followed her brother. I saw the movement, and said  nothing. What could I do? One cannot be a mortal man without having his  hours of weakness!\"    \"Be assured, general,\" exclaimed Bourrienne, \"that your adopted children  will reward you for it!\"    \"They must do so, Bourrienne--they must do so; for it is a great  sacrifice that I have made for them[11]!\"    [Footnote 11: Bourrienne, vol. iv., p. 119.]    This sacrifice, however, had its recompense immediately, for Josephine  had been able to set herself right, and Bonaparte had joyfully become  convinced that the accusations of his jealous brothers had been unjust.    Hence it was that Bonaparte's brothers wished to re move Hortense, since  they knew that she was her mother's main stay; that she, with her  gentle, amiable disposition, her tact and good sense, her penetrating  and never-failing sagacity, stood like a wise young Mentor at the side  of her beautiful, attractive, impulsive, somewhat vain, and very  extravagant mother.    It would be easier to set Josephine aside were Hortense first removed;  and Josephine they wanted to get out of the way because she interfered  with the ambitious designs of Bonaparte's brothers. Since they could not  become great and celebrated by their own merits, they desired to be so  through their illustrious brother; and, in order that they might become  kings, Bonaparte must, above all things, wear a crown. Josephine was  opposed to this project; she loved Bonaparte enough to fear the dangers  that a usurpation of the crown must bring with it, and she had so little  ambition as to prefer her present brilliant and peaceful lot to the  proud but perilous exaltation to a throne.    For this reason, then, Josephine was to be removed, and Bonaparte must  choose another wife--a wife in whose veins there should course  legitimate royal blood, and who would, therefore, be content to see a  crown upon the head of her consort.        CHAPTER II.    LOUIS BONAPARTE AND DUROC.    The brothers of Bonaparte went diligently to work then, above all  things, to get Hortense out of the way. They told Bonaparte of the  burning love of the young couple, of the letters which they sent to each  other, and proposed to him that Duroc should be transferred to the  Italian army with a higher command, and that Hortense should then be  given to him. They persuaded the unsuspecting, magnanimous hero, who was  easy to deceive in these minor matters and thus easy because he was  occupied with grand designs and grand things; they persuaded him to keep  the proposed union a secret for the present, and then on Duroc's early  return to surprise the young couple and Josephine alike.    But Josephine had, this time, seen through the plans of her hostile  brothers-in-law. She felt that her whole existence, her entire future,  was imperilled, should she not succeed in making friends and allies in  the family of Bonaparte itself. There was only one of Bonaparte's  brothers who was not hostile to her, but loved her as the wife of his  brother, to whom he was, at that time, still devoted with the most  enthusiastic and submissive tenderness.    This one was Bonaparte's brother Louis, a young man of serious and  sedate disposition, more of a scholar than a warrior, more a man of  science than fit for the council-chamber and the drawing-room. His was  a reserved, quiet, somewhat timid character, which, notwithstanding its  apparent gentleness, developed an inflexible determination and energy at  the right, decisive moment, and then could not be shaken by either  threats or entreaties. His external appearance was little calculated to  please, nay, was even somewhat sinister, and commanded the respect of  others only in moments of excitement, through the fierce blaze of his  large blue eyes, that seemed rather to look inward than outward.    Louis Bonaparte was one of those deep, self-contained, undemonstrative,  and by no means showy natures which are too rarely understood, because,  in the noisy bustle of life, we have not the time and do not take the  pains to analyze them. Only a sister or a mother is in a position to  comprehend and love men of this stamp, because the confidential home  relations of long years have revealed to them the hidden bloom of these  sensitive plants which shrink back and close their leaves at every rude  contact of the world. But rarely, however, do they find a loving heart  outside, for, since their own hearts are too timid to seek for love, no  one gives himself the trouble to discover them.    The young brother of her husband, now scarcely twenty-four, was the one  who seemed destined in Josephine's eyes to afford her a point of support  in the Bonaparte family.    Madame Letitia loved him more tenderly than she did any of them, next to  her Napoleon, since he was the petted darling of the whole family of  brothers, who had no fear of him, because he was neither egotistical nor  ambitious enough to cross their plans, but quietly allowed them to have  their way, and only asked that they would also leave him undisturbed to  follow out his own quiet and unobtrusive inclinations. He was the  confidant of his young and beautiful sisters, who were always sure to  find in him a discreet counsellor, and never a betrayer. Finally, he was  the one of the whole circle of brothers toward whom Napoleon felt the  sincerest and warmest inclination, because he could not help esteeming  him for his noble qualities, and because he was never annoyed by him as  he was by his other brothers; for the ambition and the avarice of  Jerome, Joseph, and Lucien, were even then a source of displeasure and  chagrin to Bonaparte.    \"Were any one to hear with what persistency my brothers demand fresh  sums of money from me, every day, he would really think that I had  consumed from them the inheritance their father left,\" said Bonaparte,  one day, to Bourrienne, after a violent scene between him and Jerome,  which had ended, as they all did, in Jerome getting another draft on the  private purse of the first consul.    Louis, however, never asked for money, but always appeared thankfully  content with whatever Bonaparte chose to give him, unsolicited, and  there never were any wranglings with tradesmen on his account, or any  debts of his to pay.    This last circumstance was what filled Josephine with a sort of  respectful deference for her young step-brother. He understood how to  manage his affairs so well as never to run up debts, and this was a  quality that was so sorely lacking in Josephine, that she could never  avoid incurring debt. How many bitter annoyances, how much care and  anxiety had not her debts cost her already; how often Bonaparte had  scolded her about them; how often she had promised to do differently,  and make no more purchases until she should be in a condition to pay  at once!    But this reform was to her thoughtless and magnanimous nature an  impossibility; and however greatly she may have feared the flashing eyes  and thundering voice of her husband when he was angered, she could not  escape his wrath in this one point, for in that point precisely was it  that the penitent sinner continually fell into fresh transgression--and  again ran into debt!    Louis, however, never had debts. He was as cautious and regular as her  own Hortense, and therefore, thought Josephine, these two young,  careful, thoughtful temperaments would be well adapted to each other,  and would know how to manage their hearts as discreetly as they did  their purses.    So she wished to make a step-son of Louis Bonaparte, in order to  strengthen her own position thereby. Josephine already had a premonitory  distrust of the future, and it may sometimes have happened that she took  the mighty eagle that fluttered above her head for a bird of evil omen  whose warning cry she frequently fancied that she heard in the stillness  of the night.    The negress at Martinique had said to her, \"You will be more than a  queen.\" But now, Josephine had visited the new fortune-teller, Madame  Villeneuve, in Paris, and she had said to her, \"You will wear a crown,  but only for a short time.\"    Only for a short time! Josephine was too young, too happy, and too  healthful, to think of her own early death. It must, then, be something  else that threatened her--a separation, perhaps. She had no children,  yet Bonaparte so earnestly desired to have a son, and his brothers  repeated to him daily that this was for him a political necessity.    Thus Josephine trembled for her future; she stretched out her hands for  help, and in the selfishness of her trouble asked her daughter to give  up her own dreams of happiness, in order to secure the real happiness of  her mother.    Yet Hortense was in love; her young heart throbbed painfully at the  thought of not only relinquishing her own love, but of marrying an  unloved man, whom she had never even thought of, and had scarcely  noticed. She deemed it impossible that she could be asked to sacrifice  her own beautiful and blessed happiness, to a cold-blooded calculation,  an artificial family intrigue; and so, with all the enthusiasm of a  first love, she swore rather to perish than to forego her lover.    \"But Duroc has no fortune and no future to offer you,\" said Josephine.  \"What he is, he is only through the friendship of Bonaparte. He has no  estate, no importance, no celebrity. Were Bonaparte to abandon him he  would fall back into nothingness and obscurity again.\"    Hortense replied, smiling through her tears: \"I love him, and have no  other ambition than to be his wife.\"    \"But he? Do you"]]]
