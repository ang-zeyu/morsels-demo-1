Of all things, you know, I wished for a wife with an  imposing appearance, and I don't care about love. I find it's not  fashionable, and only exists in the exalted imagination of poets.\"    \"Surely people are in love with one another sometimes,\" said the  sister.    \"Sometimes,\" repeated Anielka, inaudibly. The dialogue had painfully  affected her, and she knew not why. Her heart beat quickly, and her  face was flushed, and made her look more lovely than ever.    \"Perhaps. Of course we profess to adore every pretty woman,\" Leon  added abruptly. \"But, my dear sister, what a charming ladies' maid you  have!\" He approached the corner, where Anielka sat, and bent on her a  coarse familiar smile. Anielka, although a serf, was displeased, and  returned it with a glance full of dignity. But when her eyes rested  on the youth's handsome face, a feeling, which had been gradually and  silently growing in her young and inexperienced heart, predominated  over her pride and displeasure. She wished ardently to recall herself  to Leon's memory, and half unconsciously raised her hand to the little  purse which always hung round her neck. She took from it the rouble he  had given her.    \"See!\" shouted Leon, \"what a droll girl; how proud she is of her  riches! Why, girl, you are a woman of fortune, mistress of a whole  rouble!\"    \"I hope she came by it honestly,\" said the old Countess, who at this  moment entered.    At this insinuation, shame and indignation kept Anielka, for a time,  silent. She replaced the money quickly in its purse, with the bitter  thought that the few happy moments which had been so indelibly stamped  upon her memory, had been utterly forgotten by Leon. To clear herself,  she at last stammered out, seeing they all looked at her inquiringly,  \"Do you not remember, M. Leon, that you gave me this coin two years  ago in the garden\"?\"    \"How odd!\" exclaimed Leon, laughing, \"do you expect me to remember  all the pretty girls to whom I have given money? But I suppose you are  right, or you would not have treasured up this unfortunate rouble as  if it were a holy relic. You should not be a miser, child; money is  made to be spent.\"    \"Pray put an end to these jokes,\" said Constantia impatiently; \"I like  this girl, and I will not have her teased. She understands my ways  better than any one, and often puts me in a good humor with her  beautiful voice.\"    \"Sing something for me pretty damsel,\" said Leon, \"and I will give you  another rouble, a new and shining one.\"    \"Sing instantly,\" said Constantia imperiously.    At this command Anielka could no longer stifle her grief; she covered  her face with her hands, and wept violently.    \"Why do you cry?\" asked her mistress impatiently; \"I cannot bear it; I  desire you to do as you are bid.\"    It might have been from the constant habit of slavish obedience, or a  strong feeling of pride, but Anielka instantly ceased weeping. There  was a moment's pause, during which the old Countess went grumbling out  of the room. Anielka chose the Hymn to the Virgin she had warbled in  the garden, and as she sung, she prayed fervently;--she prayed for  peace, for deliverance from the acute emotions which had been aroused  within her. Her earnestness gave an intensity of expression to the  melody, which affected her listeners. They were silent for some  moments after its conclusion. Leon walked up and down with his arms  folded on his breast. Was it agitated with pity for the accomplished  young slave? or by any other tender emotion? What followed will show.    \"My dear Constantia,\" he said, suddenly stopping before his sister and  kissing her hand, \"will you do me a favor?\"    Constantia looked inquiringly in her brother's face without speaking.    \"Give me this girl\"    \"Impossible!\"    \"I am quite in earnest,\" continued Leon, \"I wish to offer her to my  future wife. In the Prince her father's private chapel they are much  in want of a solo soprano.\"    \"I shall not give her to you,\" said Constantia.\"    \"Not as a free gift, but in exchange. I will give you instead a  charming young negro--so black. The women in St. Petersburgh and in  Paris raved about him: but I was inexorable: I half refused him to my  princess.\"    \"No, no,\" replied Constantia; \"I shall be lonely without this girl, I  am so used to her.\"    \"Nonsense! you can get peasant girls by the dozen; but a black  page, with teeth whiter than ivory, and purer than pearls; a perfect  original in his way; you surely cannot withstand. You will kill half  the province with envy. A negro servant is the most fashionable thing  going, and yours will be the first imported into the province.\"    This argument was irresistible. \"Well,\" replied Constantia, \"when do  you think of taking her?\"    \"Immediately; to-day at five o'clock,\" said Leon; and he went merrily  out of the room.    This then was the result of his cogitation--of Anielka's Hymn to the  Virgin. Constantia ordered Anielka to prepare herself for the journey,  with as little emotion as if she had exchanged away a lap-dog, or  parted with parrot.    She obeyed in silence. Her heart was full. She went into the garden  that she might relieve herself by weeping unseen. With one hand  supporting her burning head, and the other pressed tightly against her  heart, to stifle her sobs, she wandered on mechanically till she found  herself by the side of the river. She felt quickly for her purse,  intending to throw the rouble into the water, but as quickly thrust it  back again, for she could not bear to part with the treasure. She felt  as if without it she would be still more an orphan. Weeping bitterly,  she leaned against the tree which had once before witnessed her tears.    By degrees the stormy passion within her gave place to calm  reflection. This day she was to go away; she was to dwell beneath  another roof, to serve another mistress. Humiliation! always  humiliation! But at least it would be some change in her life. As she  thought of this, she returned hastily to the palace that she might  not, on the last day of her servitude, incur the anger of her young  mistress.    Scarcely was Anielka attired in her prettiest dress, when Constantia  came to her with a little box, from which she took several gay-colored  ribbons, and decked her in them herself, that the serf might do her  credit in the new family. And when Anielka, bending down to her feet,  thanked her, Constantia, with marvelous condescension, kissed her on  her forehead. Even Leon cast an admiring glance upon her. His servant  soon after came to conduct her to the carriage, and showing her where  to seat herself, they rolled off quickly toward Radapol.    For the first time in her life Anielka rode in a carriage. Her head  turned quite giddy, she could not look at the trees and fields as they  flew past her; but by degrees she became more accustomed to it, and  the fresh air enlivening her spirits, she performed the rest of the  journey in a tolerably happy state of mind. At last they arrived in  the spacious court-yard before the Palace of Radapol, the dwelling  of a once rich and powerful Polish family, now partly in ruin. It was  evident, even to Anielka, that the marriage was one for money on the  one side, and for rank on the other.    Among other renovations at the castle, occasioned by the approaching  marriage, the owner of it, Prince Pelazia, had obtained singers  for the chapel, and had engaged Signer Justiniani, an Italian, as  chapel-master. Immediately on Leon's arrival, Anielka was presented  to him. He made her sing a scale, and pronounced her voice to be  excellent.    Anielka found that, in Radapol, she was treated with a little more  consideration than at Olgogrod, although she had often to submit to  the caprices of her new mistress, and she found less time to read. But  to console herself, she gave all her attention to singing, which she  practiced several hours a day. Her naturally great capacity, under  the guidance of the Italian, began to develop itself steadily. Besides  sacred, he taught her operatic music. On one occasion Anielka sung  an aria in so impassioned and masterly style, that the enraptured  Justiniani clapped his hands for joy, skipped about the room, and not  finding words enough to praise her, exclaimed several times, \"Prima  Donna! Prima Donna!\"    But the lessons were interrupted. The Princess's wedding-day was  fixed upon, after which event she and Leon were to go to Florence, and  Anielka was to accompany them. Alas! feelings which gave her poignant  misery still clung to her. She despised herself for her weakness; but  she loved Leon. The sentiment was too deeply implanted in her bosom to  be eradicated; too strong to be resisted. It was the first love of a  young and guileless heart, and had grown in silence and despair.    Anielka was most anxious to know something of her adopted parents.  Once, after the old prince had heard her singing, he asked her with  great kindness about her home. She replied, that she was an orphan,  and had been taken by force from those who had so kindly supplied the  place of parents, Her apparent attachment to the old bee-keeper and  his wife so pleased the prince, that he said, \"You are a good child.  Anielka, and to-morrow I will send you to visit them. You shall take  them some presents.\"    Anielka, overpowered with gratitude, threw herself at the feet of the  prince. She dreamed all night of the happiness that was in store for  her, and the joy of the poor, forsaken, old people; and when the next  morning she set off, she could scarcely restrain her impatience. At  last they approached the cabin; she saw the forest, with its tall  trees, and the meadows covered with flowers. She leaped from the  carriage, that she might be nearer these trees and flowers, every  one of which she seemed to recognize.
