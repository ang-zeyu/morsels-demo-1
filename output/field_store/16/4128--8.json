The nose, however, being what it is, bears a proper  proportion to the forehead and the rest of the face. The lips are  thin, but the lower is slightly thicker than the upper; so that, seen  in profile, it projects a little. The chin is well in harmony with the  features I have described. The forehead, in a side-view, almost hangs  over the nose; and this looks hardly less than broken, were it not for  a trifling proturberance in the middle. The eyebrows are not thick  with hair; the eyes may even be called small, of a colour like horn,  but speckled and stained with spots of bluish yellow. The ears in good  proportion; hair of the head black, as also the beard, except that  both are now grizzled by old age; the beard double-forked, about five  inches long, and not very bushy, as may partly be observed in his  portrait.\"    We have no contemporary account of Michelangelo in early manhood; but  the tenor of his life was so even, and, unlike Cellini, he moved so  constantly upon the same lines and within the same sphere of patient  self-reserve, that it is not difficult to reconstruct the young and  vigorous sculptor out of this detailed description by his loving  friend and servant in old age. Few men, notably few artists, have  preserved that continuity of moral, intellectual, and physical  development in one unbroken course which is the specific  characterisation of Michelangelo. As years advanced, his pulses beat  less quickly and his body shrank. But the man did not alter. With the  same lapse of years, his style grew drier and more abstract, but it  did not alter in quality or depart from its ideal. He seems to me in  these respects to be like Milton: wholly unlike the plastic and  assimilative genius of a Raphael.        CHAPTER III      I    Michelangelo returned to Florence in the spring of 1501. Condivi says  that domestic affairs compelled him to leave Rome, and the  correspondence with his father makes this not improbable. He brought a  heightened reputation back to his native city. The Bacchus and the  Madonna della Febbre had placed him in advance of any sculptor of his  time. Indeed, in these first years of the sixteenth century he may be  said to have been the only Tuscan sculptor of commanding eminence.  Ghiberti, Della Quercia, Brunelleschi, Donatello, all had joined the  majority before his birth. The second group of distinguished  craftsmen--Verocchio, Luca della Robbia, Rossellino, Da Maiano,  Civitali, Desiderio da Settignano--expired at the commencement of the  century. It seemed as though a gap in the ranks of plastic artists had  purposely been made for the entrance of a predominant and tyrannous  personality. Jacopo Tatti, called Sansovino, was the only man who  might have disputed the place of preeminence with Michelangelo, and  Sansovino chose Venice for the theatre of his life-labours. In these  circumstances, it is not singular that commissions speedily began to  overtax the busy sculptor's power of execution. I do not mean to  assert that the Italians, in the year 1501, were conscious of  Michelangelo's unrivalled qualities, or sensitive to the corresponding  limitations which rendered these qualities eventually baneful to the  evolution of the arts; but they could not help feeling that in this  young man of twenty-six they possessed a first-rate craftsman, and one  who had no peer among contemporaries.    The first order of this year came from the Cardinal Francesco  Piccolomini, who was afterwards elected Pope in 1503, and who died  after reigning three weeks with the title of Pius III. He wished to  decorate the Piccolomini Chapel in the Duomo of Siena with fifteen  statues of male saints. A contract was signed on June 5, by which  Michelangelo agreed to complete these figures within the space of  three years. One of them, a S. Francis, had been already begun by  Piero Torrigiano; and this, we have some reason to believe, was  finished by the master's hand. Accounts differ about his share in the  remaining fourteen statues; but the matter is of no great moment,  seeing that the style of the work is conventional, and the scale of  the figures disagreeably squat and dumpy. It seems almost impossible  that these ecclesiastical and tame pieces should have been produced at  the same time as the David by the same hand. Neither Vasari nor  Condivi speaks about them, although it is certain that Michelangelo  was held bound to his contract during several years. Upon the death of  Pius III., he renewed it with the Pope's heirs, Jacopo and Andrea  Piccolomini, by a deed dated September 15, 1504; and in 1537 Anton  Maria Piccolomini, to whom the inheritance succeeded, considered  himself Michelangelo's creditor for the sum of a hundred crowns, which  had been paid beforehand for work not finished by the sculptor.    A far more important commission was intrusted to Michelangelo in  August of the same year, 1501. Condivi, after mentioning his return to  Florence, tells the history of the colossal David in these words:  \"Here he stayed some time, and made the statue which stands in front  of the great door of the Palace of the Signory, and is called the  Giant by all people. It came about in this way. The Board of Works at  S. Maria del Fiore owned a piece of marble nine cubits in height,  which had been brought from Carrara some hundred years before by a  sculptor insufficiently acquainted with his art. This was evident,  inasmuch as, wishing to convey it more conveniently and with less  labour, he had it blocked out in the quarry, but in such a manner that  neither he nor any one else was capable of extracting a statue from  the block, either of the same size, or even on a much smaller scale.  The marble being, then, useless for any good purpose, Andrea del Monte  San Savino thought that he might get possession of it from the Board,  and begged them to make him a present of it, promising that he would  add certain pieces of stone and carve a statue from it. Before they  made up their minds to give it, they sent for Michelangelo; then,  after explaining the wishes and the views of Andrea, and considering  his own opinion that it would be possible to extract a good thing from  the block, they finally offered it to him. Michelangelo accepted,  added no pieces, and got the statue out so exactly, that, as any one  may see, in the top of the head and at the base some vestiges of the  rough surface of the marble still remain. He did the same in other  works, as, for instance, in the Contemplative Life upon the tomb of  Julius; indeed, it is a sign left by masters on their work, proving  them to be absolute in their art. But in the David it was much more  remarkable, for this reason, that the difficulty of the task was not  overcome by adding pieces; and also he had to contend with an  ill-shaped marble. As he used to say himself, it is impossible, or at  least extraordinarily difficult in statuary to set right the faults of  the blocking out. He received for this work 400 ducats, and carried it  out in eighteen months.\"    The sculptor who had spoiled this block of marble is called \"Maestro  Simone\" by Vasari; but the abundant documents in our possession, by  aid of which we are enabled to trace the whole history of  Michelangelo's David with minuteness, show that Vasari was  misinformed. The real culprit was Agostino di Antonio di Duccio, or  Guccio, who had succeeded with another colossal statue for the Duomo.  He is honourably known in the history of Tuscan sculpture by his  reliefs upon the facade of the Duomo at Modena, describing episodes in  the life of S. Gemignano, by the romantically charming reliefs in  marble, with terracotta settings, on the Oratory of S. Bernardino at  Perugia, and by a large amount of excellent surface-work in stone upon  the chapels of S. Francesco at Rimini. We gather from one of the  contracts with Agostino that the marble was originally blocked out for  some prophet. But Michelangelo resolved to make a David; and two wax  models, now preserved in the Museo Buonarroti, neither of which  corresponds exactly with the statue as it exists, show that he felt  able to extract a colossal figure in various attitudes from the  damaged block. In the first contract signed between the Consuls of the  Arte della Lana, the Operai del Duomo, and the sculptor, dated August  16, 1501, the terms are thus settled: \"That the worthy master  Michelangelo, son of Lodovico Buonarroti, citizen of Florence, has  been chosen to fashion, complete, and finish to perfection that male  statue called the Giant, of nine cubits in height, now existing in the  workshop of the cathedral, blocked out aforetime by Master Agostino of  Florence, and badly blocked; and that the work shall be completed  within the term of the next ensuing two years, dating from September,  at a salary of six golden florins per month; and that what is needful  for the accomplishment of this task, as workmen, timbers, &c., which  he may require, shall be supplied him by the Operai; and when the  statue is finished, the Consuls and Operai who shall be in office  shall estimate whether he deserve a larger recompense, and this shall  be left to their consciences.\"      II    Michelangelo began to work on Monday morning, September 13, in a  wooden shed erected for the purpose, not far from the cathedral. On  the 28th of February 1502, the statue, which is now called for the  first time \"the Giant, or David,\" was brought so far forward that the  judges declared it to be half finished, and decided that the sculptor  should be paid in all 400 golden florins, including the stipulated  salary. He seems to have laboured assiduously during the next two  years, for by a minute of the 25th of January 1504 the David is said  to be almost entirely finished.

The full  stretch, toe to finger, is seven feet three inches. I have measured it. An  active gymnast, or a sailor, could catch the gutter with a slight spring,  and by it draw himself upon the roof. You will say he would have to be  _very_ active, dexterous, and cool. So he would. And that very fact helps  us, because it narrows the field of inquiry. We know the sort of man to  look for. Because, being certain (as I am) that the man was in the room, I  _know_ that he left in the way I am telling you. He must have left in some  way, and, all the other ways being impossible, this alone remains,  difficult as the feat may seem. The fact of his shutting the window behind  him further proves his coolness and address at so great a height from the  ground.\"    All this was very plain, but the main point was still dark.    \"You say you _know_ that another man was in the room,\" I said; \"how do you  know that?\"    \"As I said, by an obvious inference. Come, now, you shall guess how I  arrived at that inference. You often speak of your interest in my work,  and the attention with which you follow it. This shall be a simple  exercise for you. You saw everything in the room as plainly as I myself.  Bring the scene back to your memory, and think over the various small  objects littering about, and how they would affect the case. Quick  observation is the first essential for my work. Did you see a newspaper,  for instance?\"    \"Yes. There was an evening paper on the floor, but I didn't examine it.\"    \"Anything else?\"    \"On the table there was a whisky decanter, taken from the tantalus-stand  on the sideboard, and one glass. That, by the by,\" I added, \"looked as  though only one person were present.\"    \"So it did, perhaps, although the inference wouldn't be very strong. Go  on!\"    \"There was a fruit-stand on the sideboard, with a plate beside it  containing a few nutshells, a piece of apple, a pair of nut-crackers, and,  I think, some orange peel. There was, of course, all the ordinary  furniture, but no chair pulled up to the table, except that used by  Foggatt himself. That's all I noticed, I think. Stay--there was an  ash-tray on the table, and a partly burned cigar near it--only one cigar,  though.\"    \"Excellent--excellent, indeed, as far as memory and simple observation go.  You saw everything plainly, and you remember everything. Surely _now_ you  know how I found out that another man had just left?\"    \"No, I don't; unless there were different kinds of ash in the ash-tray.\"    \"That is a fairly good suggestion, but there were not--there was only a  single ash, corresponding in every way to that on the cigar. Don't you  remember everything that I did as we went down-stairs?\"    \"You returned a bottle of oil to the housekeeper's daughter, I think.\"    \"I did. Doesn't that give you a hint? Come, you surely have it now?\"    \"I haven't.\"    \"Then I sha'n't tell you; you don't deserve it. Think, and don't mention  the subject again till you have at least one guess to make. The thing  stares you in the face; you see it, you remember it, and yet you _won't_  see it. I won't encourage your slovenliness of thought, my boy, by telling  you what you can know for yourself if you like. Good-by--I'm off now.  There's a case in hand I can't neglect.\"    \"Don't you propose to go further into this, then?\"    Hewitt shrugged his shoulders. \"I'm not a policeman,\" he said. \"The case  is in very good hands. Of course, if anybody comes to me to do it as a  matter of business, I'll take it up. It's very interesting, but I can't  neglect my regular work for it. Naturally, I shall keep my eyes open and  my memory in order. Sometimes these things come into the hands by  themselves, as it were; in that case, of course, I am a loyal citizen, and  ready to help the law. _Au revoir_!\"           *       *       *       *       *    I am a busy man myself, and thought little more of Hewitt's conundrum for  some time; indeed, when I did think, I saw no way to the answer. A week  after the inquest I took a holiday (I had written my nightly leaders  regularly every day for the past five years), and saw no more of Hewitt  for six weeks. After my return, with still a few days of leave to run, one  evening we together turned into Luzatti's, off Coventry Street, for  dinner.    \"I have been here several times lately,\" Hewitt said; \"they feed you very  well. No, not that table\"--he seized my arm as I turned to an unoccupied  corner--\"I fancy it's draughty.\" He led the way to a longer table where a  dark, lithe, and (as well as could be seen) tall young man already sat,  and took chairs opposite him.    We had scarcely seated ourselves before Hewitt broke into a torrent of  conversation on the subject of bicycling. As our previous conversation had  been of a literary sort, and as I had never known Hewitt at any other time  to show the slightest interest in bicycling, this rather surprised me. I  had, however, such a general outsider's grasp of the subject as is usual  in a journalist-of-all-work, and managed to keep the talk going from my  side. As we went on I could see the face of the young man opposite  brighten with interest. He was a rather fine-looking fellow, with a dark,  though very clear skin, but had a hard, angry look of eye, a prominence of  cheek-bone, and a squareness of jaw that gave him a rather uninviting  aspect. As Hewitt rattled on, however, our neighbor's expression became  one of pleasant interest merely.    \"Of course,\" Hewitt said, \"we've a number of very capital men just now,  but I believe a deal in the forgotten riders of five, ten, and fifteen  years back. Osmond, I believe, was better than any man riding now, and I  think it would puzzle some of them to beat Furnivall as he was, at his  best. But poor old Cortis--really, I believe he was as good as anybody.  Nobody ever beat Cortis--except--let me see--I think somebody beat Cortis  once--who was it now? I can't remember.\"    \"Liles,\" said the young man opposite, looking up quickly.    \"Ah, yes--Liles it was; Charley Liles. Wasn't it a championship?\"    \"Mile championship, 1880; Cortis won the other three, though.\"    \"Yes, so he did. I saw Cortis when he first broke the old 2.46 mile  record.\" And straightway Hewitt plunged into a whirl of talk of bicycles,  tricycles, records, racing cyclists, Hillier, and Synyer and Noel Whiting,  Taylerson and Appleyard--talk wherein the young man opposite bore an  animated share, while I was left in the cold.    Our new friend, it seems, had himself been a prominent racing bicyclist a  few years back, and was presently, at Hewitt's request, exhibiting a neat  gold medal that hung at his watch-guard. That was won, he explained, in  the old tall bicycle days, the days of bad tracks, when every racing  cyclist carried cinder scars on his face from numerous accidents. He  pointed to a blue mark on his forehead, which, he told us, was a track  scar, and described a bad fall that had cost him two teeth, and broken  others. The gaps among his teeth were plain to see as he smiled.    Presently the waiter brought dessert, and the young man opposite took an  apple. Nut-crackers and a fruit-knife lay on our side of the stand, and  Hewitt turned the stand to offer him the knife.    \"No, thanks,\" he said; \"I only polish a good apple, never peel it. It's a  mistake, except with thick-skinned foreign ones.\"    And he began to munch the apple as only a boy or a healthy athlete can.  Presently he turned his head to order coffee. The waiter's back was  turned, and he had to be called twice. To my unutterable amazement Hewitt  reached swiftly across the table, snatched the half-eaten apple from the  young man's plate and pocketed it, gazing immediately, with an abstracted  air, at a painted Cupid on the ceiling.    Our neighbor turned again, looked doubtfully at his plate and the  table-cloth about it, and then shot a keen glance in the direction of  Hewitt. He said nothing, however, but took his coffee and his bill,  deliberately drank the former, gazing quietly at Hewitt as he did it, paid  the latter, and left.    Immediately Hewitt was on his feet and, taking an umbrella, which stood  near, followed. Just as he reached the door he met our late neighbor, who  had turned suddenly back.    \"Your umbrella, I think?\" Hewitt asked, offering it.    \"Yes, thanks.\" But the man's eye had more than its former hardness, and  his jaw muscles tightened as I looked. He turned and went. Hewitt came  back to me. \"Pay the bill,\" he said, \"and go back to your rooms; I will  come on later. I must follow this man--it's the Foggatt case.\" As he went  out I heard a cab rattle away, and immediately after it another.    I paid the bill and went home. It was ten o'clock before Hewitt turned up,  calling in at his office below on his way up to me.    \"Mr. Sidney Mason,\" he said, \"is the gentleman the police will be wanting  to-morrow, I expect, for the Foggatt murder. He is as smart a man as I  remember ever meeting, and has done me rather neatly twice this evening.\"    \"You mean the man we sat opposite at Luzatti's, of course?\"    \"Yes, I got his name, of course, from the reverse of that gold medal he  was good enough to show me. But I fear he has bilked me over the address.  He suspected me, that was plain, and left his umbrella by way of  experiment to see if I were watching him sharply enough to notice the  circumstance, and to avail myself of it to follow him. I was hasty and  fell into the trap. He cabbed it away from Luzatti's, and I cabbed it  after him. He has led me a pretty dance up and down London to-night, and  two cabbies have made quite a stroke of business out of us. In the end he  entered a house of which, of course, I have taken the address, but I  expect he doesn't live there. He is too smart a man to lead me to his"]]]
