In a land where clear, crisp air and delightful scenery  are abundant, he turned his back upon them both and passed away. Is it not  sad to contemplate?          More Paternal Correspondence.    My dear son.--I tried to write to you last week, but didn't get around to  it, owing to circumstances. I went away on a little business tower for a  few days on the cars, and then when I got home the sociable broke loose in  our once happy home.    While on my commercial tower down the Omehaw railroad buying a new  well-diggin' machine of which I had heard a good deal pro and con, I had  the pleasure of riding on one of them sleeping-cars that we read so much  about.    I am going on 50 years old, and that's the first time I ever slumbered at  the rate of forty-five miles per hour, including stops.    I got acquainted with the porter, and he blacked my boots in the night  unbeknownst to me, while I was engaged in slumber. He must have thought  that I was your father, and that we rolled in luxury at home all the time,  and that it was a common thing for us to have our boots blacked by  menials. When I left the car this porter brushed my clothes till the hot  flashes ran up my spinal column, and I told him that he had treated me  square, and I rung his hand when he held it out toards me, and I told him  that at any time he wanted a good, cool drink of buttermilk, to just  holler through our telephone. We had the sociable at our house last week,  and when I got home your mother set me right to work borryin' chairs and  dishes. She had solicited some cakes and other things. I don't know  whether you are on the skedjule by which these sociables are run or not.  The idea is a novel one to me.    The sisters in our set, onct in so often, turn their houses wrong side out  for the purpose of raising four dollars to apply on the church debt. When  I was a boy we worshiped with less frills than they do now. Now it seems  that the debt is a part of the worship.    Well, we had a good time and used up 150 cookies in a short time. Part of  these cookies was devoured and the balance was trod into our all-wool  carpet. Several of the young people got to playing Copenhagen in the  setting-room and stepped on the old cat in such a way as to disfigure him  for life. They also had a disturbance in the front room and knocked off  some of the plastering.    So your mother is feeling slim and I am not very chipper myself. I hope  that you are working hard at your books so that you will be an ornament to  society. Society is needing some ornaments very much. I sincerely hope  that you will not begin to monkey with rum. I should hate to have you with  a felon's doom or fill a drunkard's grave. If anybody has got to fill a  drunkard's grave, let him do it himself. What has the drunkard ever done  for you, that you should fill his grave for him?    [Illustration: ROUGH ON THE OLD CAT.]    I expect you to do right, as near as possible. You will not do exactly  right all the time, but try to strike a good average. I do not expect you  to let your studies encroach, too much on your polo, but try to unite the  two so that you will not break down under the strain. I should feel sad  and mortified to have you come home a physical wreck. I think one physical  wreck in a family is enough, and I am rapidly getting where I can do the  entire physical wreck business for our neighborhood.    I see by your picture that you have got one of them pleated coats with a  belt around it, and short pants. They make you look as you did when I used  to spank you in years gone by, and I feel the same old desire to do it now  that I did then. Old and feeble as I am, it seems to me as though I could  spank a boy that wears knickerbocker pants buttoned onto a Garabaldy waist  and a pleated jacket. If it wasn't for them cute little camel's hair  whiskers of yours I would not believe that you had grown to be a large,  expensive boy, grown up with thoughts. Some of the thoughts you express in  your letters are far beyond your years. Do you think them yourself, or is  there some boy in the school that thinks all the thoughts for the rest?    Some of your letters are so deep that your mother and I can hardly grapple  with them. One of them, especially, was so full of foreign stuff that you  had got out of a bill of fare, that we will have to wait till you come  home before we can take it in. I can talk a little Chippewa, but that is  all the foreign language I am familiar with. When I was young we had to  get our foreign languages the best we could, so I studied Chippewa without  a master. A Chippewa chief took me into his camp and kept me there for  some time while I acquired his language. He became so much attached to me  that I had great difficulty in coming away. I wish you would write in the  United States dialect as much as possible, and not try to paralize your  parents with imported expressions that come too high for poor people.    Remember that you are the only boy we've got, and we are only going  through the motions of living here for your sake. For us the day is  wearing out, and it is now way long into the shank of the evening. All we  ask of you is to improve on the old people. You can see where I fooled  myself, and you can do better. Read and write, and sifer, and polo, and  get nolledge, and try not to be ashamed of your uncultivated parents.    When you get that checkered little sawed-off coat on, and that pair of  knee panties, and that poker-dot necktie, and the sassy little boys holler  \"rats\" when you pass by, and your heart is bowed down, remember that, no  matter how foolish you may look, your parents will never sour on you.    Your Father.          Twombley's Tale.    My name is Twombley, G.O.P. Twombley is my full name and I have had a  checkered career. I thought it would be best to have my career checked  right through, so I did so.    My home is in the Wasatch Mountains. Far up, where I can see the long,  green, winding valley of the Jordan, like a glorious panorama below me, I  dwell. I keep a large herd of Angora goats. That is my business. The  Angora goat is a beautiful animal--in a picture. But out of a picture he  has a style of perspiration that invites adverse criticism.    Still, it is an independent life, and one that has its advantages, too.    When I first came to Utah, I saw one day, in Salt Lake City, a young girl  arrive. She was in the heyday of life, but she couldn't talk our language.  Her face was oval; rather longer than it was wide, I noticed, and, though  she was still young, there were traces of care and other foreign  substances plainly written there.    She was an emigrant, about seventeen years of age, and, though she had  been in Salt Lake City an hour and a half, she was still unmarried.    She was about the medium height, with blue eyes, that somehow, as you  examined them carefully in the full, ruddy light of a glorious September  afternoon, seemed to resemble each other. Both of them were that way,    I know not what gave me the courage, but I stepped to her side, and in a  low voice told her of my love and asked her to be mine.    She looked askance at me. Nobody ever did that to me before and lived to  tell the tale. But her sex made me overlook it. Had she been any other sex  that I can think of, I would have resented it. But I would not strike a  woman, especially when I had not been married to her and had no right to  do so.    I turned on my heel and I went away. I most always turn on my heel when I  go away. If I did not turn on my own heel when I went away, whose heel  would a lonely man like me turn upon?    Years rolled by. I did nothing to prevent it. Still that face came to me  in my lonely hut far up in the mountains. That look still rankled in my  memory. Before that my memory had been all right. Nothing had ever rankled  in it very much. Let the careless reader who never had his memory rankle  in hot weather, pass this by. This story is not for him.    After our first conversation we did not meet again for three years, and  then by the merest accident. I had been out for a whole afternoon, hunting  an elderly goat that had grown childish and irresponsible. He had wandered  away, and for several days I had been unable to find him. So I sought for  him till darkness found me several miles from my cabin. I realized at once  that I must hurry back, or lose my way and spend the night in the  mountains. The darkness became more rapidly obvious. My way became more  and more uncertain.    Finally I fell down an old prospect shaft. I then resolved to remain where  I was until I could decide what was best to be done. If I had known that  the prospect shaft was there, I would have gone another way. There was  another way that I could have gone, but it did not occur to me until too  late.    I hated to spend the next few weeks in the shaft, for I had not locked up  my cabin when I left it, and I feared that someone might get in while I  was absent and play on the piano. I had also set a batch of bread and two  hens that morning, and all of these would be in sad knead of me before I  could get my business into such shape that I could return.    I could not tell accurately how long I had been in the shaft, for I had no  matches by which to see my watch. I also had no watch.    All at once, someone fell down the shaft. I knew that it was a woman,  because she did not swear when she landed at the bottom. Still, this could  be accounted for in another way. She was unconscious when I picked her up.    I did not know what to do, I was perfectly beside myself, and so was she.  I had read in novels that when a woman became unconscious people generally  chafed her hands, but I did not know whether I ought to chafe"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8299"],[0,"Filipino Popular Tales (#11)"],[1,"to eat when they  returned from the hunt. After the monkey and the dog had departed,  the carabao began to fry the meat. Unfortunately the noise of the  frying was heard by the Bungisngis in the forest. Seeing this chance  to fill his stomach, the Bungisngis went up to the carabao, and said,  \"Well, friend, I see that you have prepared food for me.\"    For an answer, the carabao made a furious attack on him. The Bungisngis  was angered by the carabao's lack of hospitality, and, seizing him  by the horn, threw him knee-deep into the earth. Then the Bungisngis  ate up all the food and disappeared.    When the monkey and the dog came home, they saw that everything was  in disorder, and found their friend sunk knee-deep in the ground. The  carabao informed them that a big strong man had come and beaten him  in a fight. The three then cooked their food. The Bungisngis saw  them cooking, but he did not dare attack all three of them at once,  for in union there is strength.    The next day the dog was left behind as cook. As soon as the food  was ready, the Bungisngis came and spoke to him in the same way he  had spoken to the carabao. The dog began to snarl; and the Bungisngis,  taking offence, threw him down. The dog could not cry to his companions  for help; for, if he did, the Bungisngis would certainly kill him. So  he retired to a corner of the room and watched his unwelcome guest  eat all of the food. Soon after the Bungisngis's departure, the monkey  and the carabao returned. They were angry to learn that the Bungisngis  had been there again.    The next day the monkey was cook; but, before cooking, he made a  pitfall in front of the stove. After putting away enough food for  his companions and himself, he put the rice on the stove. When the  Bungisngis came, the monkey said very politely, \"Sir, you have come  just in time. The food is ready, and I hope you'll compliment me by  accepting it.\"    The Bungisngis gladly accepted the offer, and, after sitting down in  a chair, began to devour the food. The monkey took hold of a leg of  the chair, gave a jerk, and sent his guest tumbling into the pit. He  then filled the pit with earth, so that the Bungisngis was buried  with no solemnity.    When the monkey's companions arrived, they asked about the  Bungisngis. At first the monkey was not inclined to tell them what had  happened; but, on being urged and urged by them, he finally said that  the Bungisngis was buried \"there in front of the stove.\" His foolish  companions, curious, began to dig up the grave. Unfortunately the  Bungisngis was still alive. He jumped out, and killed the dog and  lamed the carabao; but the monkey climbed up a tree, and so escaped.    One day while the monkey was wandering in the forest, he saw a beehive  on top of a vine.    \"Now I'll certainly kill you,\" said some one coming towards the monkey.    Turning around, the monkey saw the Bungisngis. \"Spare me,\" he said,  \"and I will give up my place to you. The king has appointed me to  ring each hour of the day that bell up there,\" pointing to the top  of the vine.    \"All right! I accept the position,\" said the Bungisngis. \"Stay  here while I find out what time it is,\" said the monkey. The monkey  had been gone a long time, and the Bungisngis, becoming impatient,  pulled the vine. The bees immediately buzzed about him, and punished  him for his curiosity.    Maddened with pain, the Bungisngis went in search of the monkey,  and found him playing with a boa-constrictor. \"You villain! I'll not  hear any excuses from you. You shall certainly die,\" he said.    \"Don't kill me, and I will give you this belt which the king has  given me,\" pleaded the monkey.    Now, the Bungisngis was pleased with the beautiful colors of the belt,  and wanted to possess it: so he said to the monkey, \"Put the belt  around me, then, and we shall be friends.\"    The monkey placed the boa-constrictor around the body of the  Bungisngis. Then he pinched the boa, which soon made an end of  his enemy.      Notes.    The pugut, among the Ilocanos and Pampangos, is a nocturnal spirit,  usually in the form of a gigantic Negro, terrifying, but not  particularly harmful. It corresponds to the Tagalog cafre. [20]  Its power of rapid transformation, however, makes it a more or less  formidable opponent. Sometimes it takes the form of a cat with fiery  eyes, a minute later appearing as a large dog. Then it will turn into  an enormous Negro smoking a large cigar, and finally disappear as a  ball of fire. It lives either in large trees or in abandoned houses  and ruined buildings.    Bungisngis is defined by the narrator as meaning \"a large strong man  that is always laughing.\" The word is derived from the root ngisi,  \"to show the teeth\" (Tag.). This giant has been described to me as  being of herculean size and strength, sly, and possessing an upper  lip so large that when it is thrown back it completely covers the  demon's face. The Bungisngis can lift a huge animal as easily as if  it were a feather.    Obviously these two superhuman demons have to be overcome with  strategy, not muscle. The heroes, consequently, are beings endowed with  cleverness. After Suac has killed Pugut and has come into possession  of his victim's magic club, he easily slays a man-eating giant (see  F4 in notes to preceding tale). The tricks played on the Bungisngis  by the monkey (\"ringing the bell\" and the \"king's belt\") are found in  the Ilocano story \"Kakarangkang\" and in \"The Monkey and the Turtle,\"  but in the latter tale the monkey is the victim. It would thus seem  that a precedent for the mixture of two old formulas by the narrator  of \"Kakarangkang\" already existed among the Tagalogs (cf. the end of  the notes to No. 3).    We have not a large enough number of variants to enable us to determine  the original form of the separate incidents combined to form the cycles  represented by stories Nos. 3, 4, and 55; but the evidence we have  leads to the supposition that Carancal motifs ABCDF1 are very old in  the Islands, and that these taken together probably constituted the  prototype of the \"Carancal\" group. I cannot but believe that the  \"interrupted-cooking\" episode, as found in the Philippines, owes  nothing to European forms of \"John the Bear;\" for nowhere in the  Islands have I found it associated with the subsequent adventures  comprising the \"John the Bear\" norm,--the underground pursuit of the  demon, the rescue of the princesses by the hero, the treachery of the  companions, the miraculous escape of the hero from the underworld,  and the final triumph of justice and the punishment of the traitors  (see No. 17 and notes).    For a Borneo story of a \"Deer, Pig, and Plandok (Mouse-Deer),\" see  Roth, 1 : 346. In this tale, as well as in another from British  North Borneo (Evans, 471-473, \"The Plandok and the Gergasi\"), it  is the clever plandok who alone is able to outwit the giant. In the  latter story there are seven animals,--carabao, ox, dog, stag, horse,  mouse-deer, and barking-deer. The carabao and horse in turn try in  vain to guard fish from the gergasi (a mythical giant who carries  a spear over his shoulder). The plandok takes his turn now, after  his two companions have been badly mishandled, and tricks the giant  into letting himself be bound and pushed into a well, because the  \"sky is falling.\" There he is killed by the other animals when they  return. With this last incident compare the trick of the fox in the  Mongolian story in our notes to No. 48. In two other stories of the  cunning of the plandok, \"The Plandok and the Tiger\" (Evans, 474) and  \"The Plandok and the Bear\" (ibid.), we meet with the \"king's belt\"  trick and the \"king's gong\" trick respectively. For an additional  record from Borneo, see Edwin H. Gomes, \"Seventeen Years among the  Sea Dyaks of Borneo\" (Lond., 1911), 255-261.        TALE 5    HOW SUAN BECAME RICH.      Narrated by Bonifacio Ynares, a Tagalog living in Pasig, Rizal.      Pedro and Suan were friends. Pedro inherited a great fortune from his  parents, who had recently died; but Suan was as poor as the poorest  of beggars that ever lived. Early one morning Suan went to his friend,  and said, \"I wonder if you have a post that you do not need.\"    \"Yes, I have one,\" said Pedro. \"Why? Do you need it?\"    \"Yes, I need one badly, to build my house.\"    \"Very well, take it,\" said Pedro. \"Do not worry about paying for it.\"    Suan, who had not thought evil of his friend, took the post and built  his house. When it was finished, his house was found to surpass that  of his friend. This fact made Pedro so envious of Suan, that at last  he went to him and asked Suan for the post back again.    \"Why, if I take it from its place, my house will be destroyed. So  let me pay you for it, or let me look for another post in the town  and get it for you!\"    \"No,\" said Pedro, \"I must have my own post, for I wish to use it.\"    Finally Suan became so greatly annoyed by his friend's insistence,  that he exclaimed, \"I will not give you back your post.\"    \"Take heed, Suan! for I will accuse you before the king.\"    \"All right! do as you please.\"    \"We will then go to the king Monday,\" said Pedro.    \"Very well; I am always ready.\"    When Monday came, both prepared to go to the palace. Pedro, who cared  for his money more than for anything else, took some silver coins along  with him for the journey. Suan took cooked rice and fish instead. Noon  came while they were still on the road. Suan opened his package of  food and began to eat. Pedro was also very hungry at this time, but  no food could be bought on the way. So Suan generously invited Pedro  to eat with him, and they dined together.    After eating, the two resumed their journey. At last they came to a  river. The bridge over it was broken in the middle, and one had to jump  in order to get to the other side. Pedro jumped. Suan followed him,  but unfortunately fell. It so happened that an old man was"]]]
