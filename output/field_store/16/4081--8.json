It would make him very angry with Arthur.\"    \"Which Arthur richly deserves. I think your father should know, in  order that he may take measures for your protection. Still, if you  promise not to ride or walk out alone until Arthur has left the  neighborhood, it shall be as you wish. But you must try to recover  your composure, or your papa will be sure to ask the cause of your  agitation. You are trembling very much, and the color has quite  forsaken your cheeks.\"    \"I'll try,\" She said, making a great effort to control herself, \"and I  give you the promise.\"    \"This is a very pleasant place to sit with book or work,\" he remarked,  \"but I would advise you not even to come here alone again till Arthur  has gone.\"    \"Thank you, sir, I think I shall follow your advice. It will be only a  few weeks now till he and Walter both go North to college.\"    \"I see you have your book with you,\" he said, taking it up from the  seat where it lay. \"How do you like it?\"    \"Oh, so much! How I pity poor Ellen for having such a father, so  different from my dear papa; and because she had to be separated from  her mamma, whom she loved so dearly. I can't read about her troubles  without crying, Mr. Travilla.\"    \"Shall I tell you a secret,\" he said, smiling; \"I shed some tears  over it myself.\" Then he went on talking with her about the different  characters of the story, thus helping her to recover her composure by  turning her thoughts from herself and Arthur.    When, half an hour later, a servant came to summon her to the house,  with the announcement that her father had returned and was ready to  hear her recitations, all signs of agitation had disappeared; she had  ceased to tremble, and her fair face was as sweet, bright, and rosy as  its wont.    She rose instantly on hearing the summons. \"You'll excuse me, I know,  Mr. Travilla. But will you not go in with me? We are always glad to  have you with us. I have no need to tell you that, I am sure.\"    \"Thank you,\" he said, \"but I must return to Ion now. I shall walk to  the house with you though, if you will permit me,\" he added, thinking  that Arthur might be still lurking somewhere within the grounds.    She answered gayly that she would be very glad of his company. She had  lost none of her old liking for her father's friend, and was wont to  treat him with the easy and affectionate familiarity she might have  used had he been her uncle.    They continued their talk till they had reached the lawn at the side  of the house on which her apartments were; then he turned to bid her  good-bye.    \"I'm much obliged!\" she said, taking his offered hand, and looking up  brightly into his face.    \"Welcome, fair lady; but am I to be dismissed without any reward for  my poor services?\"    \"I have none to offer, sir knight, but you may help yourself if you  choose,\" she said, laughing and blushing, for she knew very well what  he meant.    He stooped and snatched a kiss from her ruby lips, then walked away  sighing softly to himself, \"Ah, little Elsie, if I were but ten years  younger!\"    She tripped across the lawn, and entering the open door of her  boudoir, found herself in her father's arms. He had witnessed the  little scene just enacted between Mr. Travilla and herself, had  noticed something in his friend's look and manner that had never  struck him before. He folded his child close to his heart for an  instant then held her off a little, gazing fondly into her face.    \"You are mine; you belong to me; no other earthly creature has the  least shadow of a right or title in you; do you know that?\"    \"Yes, papa, and rejoice to know it,\" she murmured, putting her arms  about his neck and laying her head against his breast.    \"Ah!\" he said, sighing, \"you will not always be able to say that, I  fear. One of these days you will--\" He broke off abruptly, without  finishing his sentence.    She looked up inquiringly into his face.    He answered her look with a smile and a tender caress. \"I had better  not put the nonsense into your head: it will get there soon enough  without my help. Come now, let us have the lessons. I expect to find  them well prepared, as usual.\"    \"I hope so, papa,\" she answered, bringing her books and seating  herself on a stool at his feet, he having taken possession of an  easy-chair.    The recitations seemed a source of keen enjoyment to both; the one  loving to impart, and the other to receive, knowledge.    Mr. Dinsmore gave the deserved meed of warm praise for the faithful  preparation of each allotted task, prescribed those for the coming  day, and the books were laid aside.    \"Come here, daughter,\" he said, as she closed her desk upon them, \"I  have something to say to you.\"    \"What is it, papa?\" she asked, seating herself upon his knee. \"How  very grave you look.\" But there was not a touch of the old fear in her  face or voice, as there had been none in his of the old sternness.    \"Yes, for I am about to speak of a serious matter,\" he answered,  gently smoothing back the clustering curls from her fair brow, while  he looked earnestly into the soft brown eyes. \"You have not been  lending money to Arthur, Elsie?\"    The abrupt, unexpected question startled her, and a crimson tide  rushed over her face and neck; but she returned her father's gaze  steadily: \"No, papa; how could you think I would disobey so?\"    \"I did not, darling, and yet I felt that I must ask the question  and repeat my warning, my command to you--never to do so without my  knowledge and consent. Your grandfather and I are much troubled about  the boy.\"    \"I am so sorry, papa; I hope he has not been doing anything very bad.\"    \"He seems to have sufficient cunning to hide many of his evil deeds,\"  Mr. Dinsmore said, with a sigh; \"yet enough has come to light to  convince us that he is very likely to become a shame and disgrace to  his family. We know that he is profane, and to some extent, at  least, intemperate and a gambler. A sad, sad beginning for a boy of  seventeen. And to furnish him with money, Elsie, would be only to  assist him in his downward course.\"    \"Yes, papa, I see that. Poor grandpa, I'm so sorry for him! But, papa,  God can change Arthur's heart, and make him all we could wish.\"    \"Yes, daughter, and we will agree together to ask Him to do this great  work, so impossible to any human power; shall we not?\"    \"Yes, papa.\" They were silent a moment; then she turned to him again,  told of Lucy Carrington's call and its object, and asked if she might  accept the invitation.    He considered a moment. \"Yes,\" he said kindly, \"you may if you wish.  You quite deserve a holiday, and I think perhaps would really be the  better of a week's rest from study. Go and enjoy yourself as much as  you can, my darling.\"    \"Thank you, you dearest, kindest, and best of papas,\" she said, giving  him a hug and kiss. \"But I think you look a little bit sorry. You  would rather I should stay at home, if I could content myself to do  so, and it would be a strange thing if I could not.\"    \"No, my pet, I shall miss you, I know; the house always seems lonely  without you; but I can spare you for a week, and would rather have you  go, because I think the change will do you good. Besides, I am willing  to lend my treasure for a few days to our friends at Ashlands. I  would gladly do more than that, if I could, for that poor suffering  Herbert.\"          CHAPTER VII.      How many pleasant faces shed their light on every side.      --TUPPER.      \"Remember it is for only one week; you must be back again next  Wednesday by ten o'clock; I can't spare you an hour longer,\" Mr.  Dinsmore said, as the next morning, shortly after breakfast, he  assisted his daughter to mount her pony.    \"Ten o'clock at night, papa?\" asked Elsie in a gay, jesting tone, as  she settled herself in the saddle, and took a little gold-mounted  riding whip from his hand.    \"No, ten A.M., precisely.\"    \"But what if it should be storming, sir?\"    \"Then come as soon as the storm is over.\"    \"Yes, sir; and may I come sooner if I get homesick?\"    \"Just as soon as you please. Now, good-bye, my darling. Don't go into  any danger. I know I need not remind you to do nothing your father  would disapprove.\"    \"I hope not, papa,\" she said, with a loving look into the eyes that  were gazing so fondly upon her. Then kissing her hand to him and her  mamma and little Horace, who stood on the veranda to see her off, she  turned her horse's head and cantered merrily away, taking the road to  Ashlands on passing out at the gate.    It was a bright, breezy morning, and her heart felt so light and  gay that a snatch of glad song rose to her lips. She warbled a few  bird-like notes, then fell to humming softly to herself.    At a little distance down the road a light wagon was rumbling along,  driven by one of the man-servants from the Oaks, and carrying Aunt  Chloe and her young mistress' trunks.    \"Come, Jim,\" said Elsie, glancing over her shoulder at her attendant  satellite, \"we must pass them. Glossy and I are in haste to-day. Ah,  mammy, are you enjoying your ride?\" she called to her old nurse as she  cantered swiftly by.    \"Yes, dat I is, honey!\" returned the old woman. Then sending a loving,  admiring look after the retreating form so full of symmetry and grace,  \"My bressed chile!\" she murmured, \"you's beautiful as de mornin', your  ole mammy tinks, an' sweet as de finest rose in de garden; bright an'  happy as de day am long, too.\"    \"De beautifullest in all de country, an' de finest,\" chimed in her  charioteer.    The young people at Ashlands were all out on the veranda enjoying the  fresh morning air--Herbert lying on a lounge with a book in his hand;  Harry and Lucy seated on opposite sides of a small round table and  deep in a game of chess; two"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9966"],[0,"The Spartan Twins (#11)"],[1,"very gate we came  through this morning! The luck is surely with us now.\"    \"Let's stay here and speak to the first person that comes along,\" said  Daphne. \"I'm sure it will be the right one.\"    The two children waited with beating hearts. A tall figure now appeared  walking toward the gate, followed by a slave carrying a torch. As the man  drew near, the children went boldly out to meet him.    \"Can you tell us the way to the house of Hipponicus?\" asked Dion  politely.    The man stopped, and the slave held the torch so his master could see the  faces of the children.    \"By all the Gods,\" said the man, \"what are you children doing out here at  this time of the night?\"    \"The Stranger! Anaxagoras!\" cried Daphne. \"Oh, I knew Athena would help  us!\" and the two children threw themselves into his arms, so great was  their relief and joy.    They told him the whole story of their adventure on the Acropolis and why  they wanted to find the house of Hipponicus.    \"Well,\" said Anaxagoras, when they had finished, \"I live in the Piraeus.  I was on my way home, but now I shall go with you to the house of  Hipponicus, and you shall tell your story to Pericles himself.\"          VII    HOME AGAIN      Under the guidance and protection of Anaxagoras and the slave, the  children were soon ushered into the court of the richest house in Athens,  and then Anaxagoras sent a message to Pericles, who was dining with a  group of men in a large room opening off the court. When the slave opened  the door of the banquet-room, the children caught a glimpse of men  reclining on couches, with wreaths about their heads, and heard for an  instant the sound of laughter and gay voices. The smell of food came  also, and the Twins sniffed the delicious odor hungrily. Soon Pericles  appeared, wearing a wreath upon his brow, and, as Daphne thought, looking  more like a God than ever. Anaxagoras told him the story which the Twins  had told to him.    \"A very neat plot! Is it not?\" said Pericles gravely, when Anaxagoras had  finished.    \"They said something about you too,\" said Daphne, lifting her eyes to  Anaxagoras.    \"Indeed!\" said Anaxagoras. \"So I am in it, too! What did they say?\"    \"They said you were an old fox,\" said Daphne. The two men laughed.    \"I trust I may live up to their opinion of me,\" said Anaxagoras.    Then Pericles looked at the children and laid his hand gently upon their  tousled heads.    \"So you ran alone through Athens at night to warn me, did you?\" he said.  \"And you have been in great danger for my sake? I shall know how to deal  with those two pious old serpents of the Acropolis. Thanks to you, I  shall not fall into their coils. And Pericles does not forget an  obligation. Now, my little Spartans,\" he added, tipping up their chins  and looking at their pale and pinched faces, \"it's time you had something  to eat!\"    He clapped his hands and a slave appeared. \"Say to Hipponicus that two  friends of Pericles are in the court, and he begs that they may be served  there with the best the house affords.\"    The slave disappeared and soon returned bringing such a feast as the  Twins had never tasted in their whole lives before. Pericles waited,  talking quietly with Anaxagoras, until their hunger was partly appeased,  and then he spoke to them again.    \"Now, my brave Spartans,\" he said, \"since you have been so considerate of  my safety, it is well that I should look after yours. Have you any idea  where your Father may be found? He is probably searching the town for  you.\"    \"We were to spend the night at the house of my Uncle Phaon, the  stone-cutter,\" said Dion, \"but we don't know where he lives.\"    \"Phaon,\" said Pericles, stroking his beard. \"Is he not a workman in the  shop of Phidias the sculptor? He has a stone-cutter of that name, and,  now I think of it, he is called Phaon the Spartan.\"    \"That must be my uncle,\" said Dion, \"but I don't know where he lives. I  have never been to Athens before, and Uncle Phaon does not come to the  farm.\"    \"We can find out from Phidias,\" said Anaxagoras, and, turning to his  slave, he said, \"Run quickly to the house of Phidias and say to him that  Pericles the Archon wishes to know where to find the house of Phaon the  stone-cutter.\"    The slave sped away and returned in a short time with the message that  Phaon lived near the northwest gate. \"And I know the way there,\" added  the slave.    \"Very well,\" said Anaxagoras. \"We will take these children there. Then I  will await you at your house, Pericles, for I wish to hear the end of the  story, and to know how you deal with those two old traitors.\"    \"Now that I know their purpose,\" said Pericles, \"it is easy to defeat it!  I shall return no word to their abuse. When I reach my house, I shall  politely offer my assailant the escort of my slave, to light him home  with his torch.\"    Anaxagoras laughed heartily.    \"Good,\" he cried, \"and humorous as well. A torch to light up their evil  faces is the last thing in the world they would wish to have. You could  not devise a more perfect plan to foil their wicked schemes.\"    \"I wish all plots might be as easily frustrated,\" said Pericles gravely.  Then, turning to the children, he added kindly: \"You have nothing further  to fear. My good friend Anaxagoras and his slave will see you safely to  your uncle's house, and he will surely know where to find your Father.\"    \"You won't let Lampon catch us and sell us for slaves, will you?\" begged  Daphne, shuddering. \"They said they would sell us in Alexandria.\"    Pericles' brow darkened. \"They threatened that, did they?\" he exclaimed.  \"The wretches shall not lay a finger on you! Pericles the Archon has said  it. And now you must hurry away. Your Father will be torn with anxiety  until he sees you again. To-morrow morning I shall send a messenger to  your uncle's house with a package for you, which you must not open until  you are safe at home again. And when you grow up to be strong, brave  men, I shall expect you to be generals in the army of Athens at the very  least.\"    \"I can't grow up to be a strong, brave man,\" said Daphne in a very small  voice. \"I wish I could. But I'm a girl.\"    \"A girl!\" cried Pericles in amazement, \"and so brave! Surely then you  will at least be the mother of heroes some time. But after this stay more  quietly at home, my child. Women should have no history.\" And he  disappeared through the door into the banquet-hall.    When the Twins, accompanied by Anaxagoras and the slave, finally reached  the house of their uncle, they found the door open and people hurrying  excitedly to and fro, carrying torches in their hands. In the court of  the house stood Melas, talking with Phaon and his wife.    \"I have searched every nook and cranny of the Acropolis,\" Melas was  saying. \"I do not see how they could have escaped me.\"    \"It's a punishment of the Gods,\" said the wife of Phaon. \"You should not  have let Daphne run the streets like a boy. It's against nature. No  decent Athenian girl would be allowed to. I never put my nose out of my  Mother's house exeept on the days of women's festivals until I was  married.\"    \"But, my dear,\" said Phaon mildly, \"you forget the Spartans are  different.\"    \"I should say they were!\" snapped the wife of Phaon, \"and now they may  see what comes of it. It's my opinion these wild children have fallen off  the cliffs on the north side of the Acropolis.\"    Melas shuddered, sank down upon a stool, and hid his face. Just at that  moment there was a sudden rush of feet behind him and he felt four arms  flung about his neck. Spartan though he was, Melas trembled, and his eyes  were wet as he clasped his children in his arms, Anaxagoras stood in the  doorway a moment smiling at the happy group, and then gently slipped away  without waiting for any thanks.    Early the next morning a basket addressed to the \"brave children of Melas  the Spartan, from Pericles the Archon,\" was delivered by a slave at the  door of Phaon. The Twins had been eagerly expecting it, and when it  arrived they were no less eager to start for home, since Pericles had  told them not to open it until they were under their own roof once more.  Their aunt, the wife of Phaon, was filled with curiosity to know the  contents. Moreover, since she had learned the whole story of the night  before and knew that the children had won the favor and were now under  the avowed protection of Pericles, her respect for them and for Spartans  in general had greatly increased.    \"Let us see what gifts the great Pericles has sent you!\" she cried, when  the package came.    \"No, no,\" said Daphne hastily. \"He said we should not open it until we  got home.\"    \"Very well, then,\" said the wife of Phaon, sulkily, \"only then I shall  never see what's in it.\"    \"Well,\" said Daphne piously, \"you remember about Pandora, don't you? I  wouldn't dare open it until the time comes!\"    To this the aunt could make no reply, Melas, too, had no wish to linger  in Athens after the experience of the day before. The children were in  terror of meeting Lampon, and Melas himself felt it would be a great  load off his mind to get them safely back to their quiet house on Salamis  once more and into their Mother's care. So they bade Phaon and his wife  good-bye and started before noon for the Piraeus.    At the dock they found the boat ready for its return journey across the  bay. Nearby was the large black hull of an African ship, bound for  Alexandria. Dion pointed to it.    \"Suppose we were on that this minute,\" he said to Daphne, and Daphne  covered her eyes and shook with horror at the mere thought of it.    It was nearly night when the three weary wanderers climbed the last  hill and turned from the roadway into the path which led to the old  farm-house. Lydia was standing in the doorway with Chloe behind her,  smiling, and Argos came bounding out to meet them, wagging his tail and  barking for joy.    It was a happy party that"]]]
