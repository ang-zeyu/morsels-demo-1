Most of the men he had kept on, for he liked them well and they had  faith to believe that success would not spoil him. The Pilgrim he had  promised himself the pleasure of firing bodily off the ranch within an  hour of his first taking control--but the Pilgrim had not waited.  He had left the ranch with the Old Man and where he had gone did not  concern Billy at the time. For there was the shipment of young stock  from the South to meet and drive up to the home range, and there was  the calf round-up to start on time, and after all the red tape of  buying the outfit and turning over the stock had been properly wound  up, time was precious in the extreme through May and June and well  into July.    But habit is strong upon a man even after the conditions which bred  the habit have utterly changed. One privilege had been always kept  inviolate at the Double-Crank, until it had come to be looked upon as  an inalienable right. The Glorious Fourth had been celebrated, come  rain, come shine. Usually the celebration was so generous that it  did not stop at midnight; anywhere within a week was considered  permissible, a gradual tapering off--not to say sobering up--being the  custom with the more hilarious souls.    When Dill with much solemnity tore off June from the calendar in the  dining room--the calendar with Custer's Last Charge rioting redly  above the dates--Billy, home for a day from the roundup, realized  suddenly that time was on the high lope; at least, that is how he put  it to Dill.    \"Say, Dilly, we sure got to jar loose from getting rich long enough  to take in that picnic over to Bluebell Grove. Didn't know there was  a picnic or a Bluebell Grove? Well now, there is. Over on Horned-Toad  Creek--nice, pretty name to go with the grove, ain't it?--they've got  a patch uh shade big over as my hat. Right back up on the hill is the  schoolhouse where they do their dancing, and they've got a table or  two and a swing for the kids to fall outa--and they call it Bluebell  Grove because yuh never saw a bluebell within ten mile uh the place.  That's where the general round-up for the Fourth is pulled off this  year--so Jim Bleeker was telling me this morning. We sure got to be  present, Dilly.\"    \"I'm afraid I'm not the sort of man to shine in society, William,\"  dissented the other modestly. \"You can go, and--\"    \"Don't yuh never _dance_?\" Billy eyed him speculatively. A man under  fifty--and Dill might be anywhere between thirty and forty--who had  two sound legs and yet did not dance!    \"Oh, I used to, after a fashion. But my feet are so far off that I  find communication with them necessarily slow, and they have a habit  of embarking in wild ventures of their own. I do not believe they  are really popular with the feminine element, William. And so I'd  rather--\"    \"Aw, you'll have to go and try it a whirl, anyhow. We ain't any of us  experts. Yuh see, the boys have been accustomed to having the wheels  of industry stop revolving on the Fourth, and turning kinda wobbly for  four or five days after. I don't feel like trying to break 'em in to  keep on working--do you?\"    \"To use your own term,\" said Dill, suddenly reckless of his diction,  \"you're sure the doctor.\"    \"Well, then, the proper dope for this case is, all hands show up at  the picnic.\" He picked up his hat from the floor, slapped it twice  against his leg to remove the dust, pinched the crown into four dents,  set it upon his head at a jaunty angle and went out, singing softly:    \"She's a young thing, and cannot leave her mother.\"    Dill, looking after him, puckered his face into what passed with him  for a smile. \"I wonder now,\" he meditated aloud, \"if William is not  thinking of some particular young lady who--er--who 'cannot leave her  mother'.\" If he had only known it, William was; he was also wondering  whether she would be at the picnic. And if she were at the picnic,  would she remember him? He had only seen her that one night--and to  him it seemed a very long while ago. He thought, however, that  he might be able to recall himself to her mind--supposing she had  forgotten. It was a long time ago, he kept reminding himself, and  the light was poor and he hadn't shaved for a week--he had always  afterward realized that with much mental discomfort--and he really did  look a lot different when he had on his \"war-togs,\" by which he meant  his best clothes. He wouldn't blame her at all if she passed him up  for a stranger, just at first. A great deal more he thought on the  same subject, and quite as foolishly.    Because of much thinking on the subject, when he and Dill rode down  the trail which much recent passing had made unusually dusty, with the  hot sunlight of the Fourth making the air quiver palpably around them;  with the cloudless blue arching hotly over their heads and with the  four by six cotton flag flying an involuntary signal of distress--on  account of its being hastily raised bottom-side-up and left that  way--and beckoning them from the little clump of shade below, the  heart of Charming Billy Boyle beat unsteadily under the left pocket of  his soft, cream-colored silk shirt, and the cheeks of him glowed red  under the coppery tan. Dill was not the sort of man who loves fast  riding and they ambled along quite decorously--\"like we was headed  for prayer-meeting with a singing-book under each elbow,\" thought  Billy, secretly resentful of the pace.    \"I reckon there'll be quite a crowd,\" he remarked wistfully. \"I see a  good many horses staked out already.\"    Dill nodded absently, and Billy took to singing his pet ditty; one  must do something when one is covering the last mile of a journey  toward a place full of all sorts of delightful possibilities--and  covering that mile at a shambling trot which is truly maddening.         \"She can make a punkin pie quick's a cat can wink her eye,       She's a young thing, and cannot leave her mother!\"    \"But, of course,\" observed Mr. Dill quite unexpectedly, \"you know,  William, time will remedy that drawback.\"    Billy started, looked suspiciously at the other, grew rather red and  shut up like a clam. He did more; he put the spurs to his horse and  speedily hid himself in a dust-cloud, so that Dill, dutifully keeping  pace with him, made a rather spectacular arrival whether he would or  no.    Charming Billy, his hat carefully dimpled, his blue tie fastidiously  knotted and pierced with the Klondyke nugget-pin which was his only  ornament, wandered hastily through the assembled groups and  slapped viciously at mosquitoes. Twice he shied at a flutter of  woman-garments, retreated to a respectable distance and reconnoitred  with a fine air of indifference, to find that the flutter accompanied  the movements of some girl for whom he cared not at all.    In his nostrils was the indefinable, unmistakable picnic odor--the  odor of crushed grasses and damp leaf-mould stirred by the passing of  many feet, the mingling of cheap perfumes and starched muslin and iced  lemonade and sandwiches; in his ears the jumble of laughter and of  holiday speech, the squealing of children in a mob around the swing,  the protesting squeak of the ropes as they swung high, the snorting  of horses tied just outside the enchanted ground. And through the  tree-tops he could glimpse the range-land lying asleep in the hot  sunlight, unchanged, uncaring, with the wild range-cattle feeding  leisurely upon the slopes and lifting heads occasionally to snuff  suspiciously the unwonted sounds and smells that drifted up to them on  vagrant breezes.    He introduced Dill to four or five men whom he thought might  be congenial, left him talking solemnly with a man who at some  half-forgotten period had come from Michigan, and wandered aimlessly  on through the grove. Fellows there were in plenty whom he knew, but  he passed them with a brief word or two. Truth to tell, for the most  part they were otherwise occupied and had no time for him.    He loitered over to the swing, saw that the enthusiasts who were  making so much noise were all youngsters under fifteen or so and that  they hailed his coming with a joy tinged with self-interest. He rose  to the bait of one dark-eyed miss who had her hair done in two braids  crossed and tied close to her head with red-white-and-blue ribbon, and  who smiled alluringly and somewhat toothlessly and remarked that she  liked to go 'way, '_way_ up till it most turned over, and that  it didn't scare her a bit. He swung her almost into hysterics  and straightway found himself exceedingly popular with other  braided-and-tied young misses. Charming Billy never could tell  afterward how long or how many he swung 'way, '_way_ up; he knew that  he pushed and pushed until his arms ached and the hair on his forehead  became unpleasantly damp under his hat.    \"That'll just about have to do yuh, kids,\" he rebelled suddenly and  left them, anxiously patting his hair and generally resettling himself  as he went. Once more in a dispirited fashion he threaded the crowd,  which had grown somewhat larger, side-stepped a group which called  after him, and went on down to the creek.    \"I'm about the limit, I guess,\" he told himself irritably. \"Why the  dickens didn't I have the sense and nerve to ride over and ask her  straight out if she was coming? I coulda drove her over, maybe--if  she'd come with me. I coulda took the bay team and top-buggy, and done  the thing right. I coulda--hell, there's a _heap_ uh things I coulda  done that would uh been a lot more wise than what I did do! Maybe she  ain't coming at all, and--\"    On the heels of that he saw a spring-wagon, come rattling down the  trail across the creek. There were two seats full, and two parasols  were bobbing seductively, and one of them was blue. \"I'll bet a dollar  that's them now,\" murmured Billy, and once more felt anxiously of his  hair where it had gone limp under his hat. \"Darned kids--the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12225"],[0,"Tales of lonely trails (#12)"],[1,"n, violent; they did not  know what was in the air; now they filed after Don in an orderly trot.    We struck out of the pines at half past five. Floating mist hid the  lower end of the plateau. The morning had a cool touch but there was  no frost. Crossing Middle Canyon about half way down we jogged on.  Cedar trees began to show bright green against the soft gray sage. We  were nearing the dark line of the cedar forest when Jim, who led, held  up his hand in a warning check. We closed in around him.    \"Watch Don,\" he said.    The hound stood stiff, head well up, nose working, and the hair on his  back bristling. All the other hounds whined and kept close to him.    \"Don scents a lion,\" whispered Jim. \"I've never known him to do that  unless there was the scent of a lion on the wind.\"    \"Hunt 'em up Don, old boy,\" called Jones.    The pack commenced to work back and forth along the ridge. We neared  a hollow when Don barked eagerly. Sounder answered and likewise Jude.  Moze's short angry \"bow-wow\" showed the old gladiator to be in line.    \"Ranger's gone,\" cried Jim. \"He was farthest ahead. I'll bet he's  struck it. We'll know in a minute, for we're close.\"    The hounds were tearing through the sage, working harder and harder,  calling and answering one another, all the time getting down into the  hollow.    Don suddenly let out a string of yelps. I saw him, running head up,  pass into the cedars like a yellow dart. Sounder howled his deep, full  bay, and led the rest of the pack up the slope in angry clamor.    \"They're off!\" yelled Jim, and so were we.    In less than a minute we had lost one another. Crashings among the dry  cedars, thud of hoofs and yells kept me going in one direction. The  fiery burst of the hounds had surprised me. I remembered that Jim had  said Emett and his charger might keep the pack in sight, but that none  of the rest of us could.    It did not take me long to realize what my mustang was made of. His  name was Foxie, which suited him well. He carried me at a fast pace on  the trail of some one; and he seemed to know that by keeping in this  trail part of the work of breaking through the brush was already done  for him. Nevertheless, the sharp dead branches, more numerous in a  cedar forest than elsewhere, struck and stung us as we passed. We  climbed a ridge, and found the cedars thinning out into open patches.  Then we faced a bare slope of sage and I saw Emett below on his big  horse.    Foxie bolted down this slope, hurdling the bunches of sage, and  showing the speed of which Emett had boasted. The open ground, with  its brush, rock and gullies, was easy going for the little mustang. I  heard nothing save the wind singing in my ears. Emett's trail, plain  in the yellow ground showed me the way. On entering the cedars again  I pulled Foxie in and stopped twice to yell \"waa-hoo!\" I heard the  baying of the hounds, but no answer to my signal. Then I attended to  the stern business of catching up. For what seemed a long time, I  threaded the maze of cedar, galloped the open sage flats, always on  Emett's track.    A signal cry, sharp to the right, turned me. I answered, and with the  exchange of signal cries found my way into an open glade where Jones  and Jim awaited me.    \"Here's one,\" said Jim. \"Emett must be with the hounds. Listen.\"    With the labored breathing of the horses filling our ears we could  hear no other sound. Dismounting, I went aside and turned my ear to  the breeze.    \"I hear Don,\" I cried instantly.    \"Which way?\" both men asked.    \"West.\"    \"Strange,\" said Jones. \"The hound wouldn't split, would he, Jim?\"    \"Don leave that hot trail? Shore he wouldn't,\" replied Jim. \"But his  runnin' do seem queer this morning.\"    \"The breeze is freshening,\" I said. \"There! Now listen! Don, and  Sounder, too.\"    The baying came closer and closer. Our horses threw up long ears. It  was hard to sit still and wait. At a quick cry from Jim we saw Don  cross the lower end of the flat.    No need to spur our mounts! The lifting of bridles served, and away  we raced. Foxie passed the others in short order. Don had long  disappeared, but with blended bays, Jude, Moze, and Sounder broke out  of the cedars hot on the trail. They, too, were out of sight in a  moment.    The crash of breaking brush and thunder of hoofs from where the hounds  had come out of the forest, attracted and even frightened me. I saw  the green of a low cedar tree shake, and split, to let out a huge,  gaunt horse with a big man doubled over his saddle. The onslaught  of Emett and his desert charger stirred a fear in me that checked  admiration.    \"Hounds running wild,\" he yelled, and the dark shadows of the cedars  claimed him again.    A hundred yards within the forest we came again upon Emett,  dismounted, searching the ground. Moze and Sounder were with him,  apparently at fault. Suddenly Moze left the little glade and venting  his sullen, quick bark, disappeared under the trees. Sounder sat on  his haunches and yelped.    \"Now what the hell is wrong?\" growled Jones tumbling off his saddle.    \"Shore something is,\" said Jim, also dismounting.    \"Here's a lion track,\" interposed Emett.    \"Ha! and here's another,\" cried Jones, in great satisfaction. \"That's  the trail we were on, and here's another crossing it at right angles.  Both are fresh: one isn't fifteen minutes old. Don and Jude have split  one way and Moze another. By George! that's great of Sounder to hang  fire!\"    \"Put him on the fresh trail,\" said Jim, vaulting into his saddle.    Jones complied, with the result that we saw Sounder start off on the  trail Moze had taken. All of us got in some pretty hard riding, and  managed to stay within earshot of Sounder. We crossed a canyon, and  presently reached another which, from its depth, must have been Middle  Canyon. Sounder did not climb the opposite slope, so we followed the  rim. From a bare ridge we distinguished the line of pines above us,  and decided that our location was in about the center of the plateau.    Very little time elapsed before we heard Moze. Sounder had caught up  with him. We came to a halt where the canyon widened and was not so  deep, with cliffs and cedars opposite us, and an easy slope leading  down. Sounder bayed incessantly; Moze emitted harsh, eager howls, and  both hounds, in plain sight, began working in circles.    \"The lion has gone up somewhere,\" cried Jim. \"Look sharp!\"    Repeatedly Moze worked to the edge of a low wall of stone and looked  over; then he barked and ran back to the slope, only to return. When  I saw him slide down a steep place, make for the bottom of the stone  wall, and jump into the low branches of a cedar I knew where to look.  Then I descried the lion a round yellow ball, cunningly curled up in a  mass of dark branches. He had leaped into the tree from the wall.    \"There he is! Treed! Treed!\" I yelled. \"Moze has found him.\"    \"Down boys, down into the canyon,\" shouted Jones, in sharp voice.  \"Make a racket, we don't want him to jump.\"    How he and Jim and Emett rolled and cracked the stone! For a moment I  could not get off my horse; I was chained to my saddle by a strange  vacillation that could have been no other thing than fear.    \"Are you afraid?\" called Jones from below.    \"Yes, but I am coming,\" I replied, and dismounted to plunge down the  hill. It may have been shame or anger that dominated me then; whatever  it was I made directly for the cedar, and did not halt until I was  under the snarling lion.    \"Not too close!\" warned Jones. \"He might jump. It's a Tom, a  two-year-old, and full of fight.\"    It did not matter to me then whether he jumped or not. I knew I had to  be cured of my dread, and the sooner it was done the better.    Old Moze had already climbed a third of the distance up to the lion.    \"Hyar Moze! Out of there, you rascal coon chaser!\" Jones yelled as he  threw stones and sticks at the hound. Moze, however, replied with his  snarly bark and climbed on steadily.    \"I've got to pull him out. Watch close boys and tell me if the lion  starts down.\"    When Jones climbed the first few branches of the tree, Tom let out an  ominous growl.    \"Make ready to jump. Shore he's comin',\" called Jim.    The lion, snarling viciously, started to descend. It was a ticklish  moment for all of us, particularly Jones. Warily he backed down.    \"Boys, maybe he's bluffing,\" said Jones, \"Try him out. Grab sticks and  run at the tree and yell, as if you were going to kill him.\"    Not improbably the demonstration we executed under the tree would  have frightened even an African lion. Tom hesitated, showed his white  fangs, returned to his first perch, and from there climbed as far as  he could. The forked branch on which he stood swayed alarmingly.    \"Here, punch Moze out,\" said Jim handing up a long pole.    The old hound hung like a leech to the tree, making it difficult to  dislodge him. At length he fell heavily, and venting his thick battle  cry, attempted to climb again.    Jim seized him, made him fast to the rope with which Sounder had  already been tied.    \"Say Emett, I've no chance here,\" called Jones. \"You try to throw at  him from the rock.\"    Emett ran up the rock, coiled his lasso and cast the noose. It sailed  perfectly in between the branches and circled Tom's head. Before it  could be slipped tight he had thrown it off. Then he hid behind the  branches.    \"I'm going farther up,\" said Jones.    \"Be quick,\" yelled Jim.    Jones evidently had that in mind. When he reached the middle fork of  the cedar, he stood erect and extended the noose of his lasso on the  point of his pole. Tom, with a hiss and snap, struck at it savagely.  The second trial tempted the lion to saw the rope with his teeth. In  a flash Jones withdrew the pole, and lifted a loop of the slack rope  over the lion's ears.    \"Pull!\" he yelled.    Emett, at the other end of the lasso, threw his great strength into  action, pulling the"]]]
