So  the children were free.    Then the dog was glad, and danced about and barked and ran round and  round. Pretty soon he came up to the little girl, and looked up in her  face, and then started away, trotting. Every little while he would stop  and look back. The girl thought he wanted her to follow him. She did so,  and he took her to where the bundle of dried meat was, and showed it to  her. Then, when he had done this, he jumped up on her, and licked the  baby's face, and then started off, running as hard as he could along the  trail of the camp, never stopping to look back. The girl did not follow  him. She now knew that it was no use to go to the camp again. Their  parents would not receive them, and the chief would perhaps order them to  be killed.    She went on her way, carrying her little brother and the bundle of dried  meat. She travelled for many days, and at last came to a place where she  thought she would stop. Here she built a little lodge of poles and brush,  and stayed there. One night she had a dream, and an old woman came to her  in the dream, and said to her, \"To-morrow take your little brother, and tie  him to one of the lodge poles, and the next day tie him to another, and so  every day tie him to one of the poles, until you have gone all around the  lodge and have tied him to each pole. Then you will be helped, and will no  more have bad luck.\"    When the girl awoke in the morning, she remembered what the dream had told  her, and she bound her little brother to one of the lodge poles; and each  day after this she tied him to one of the poles. Each day he grew larger,  until, when she had gone all around the lodge, he was grown to be a fine  young man.    Now the girl was glad, and proud of her young brother who was so large and  noble-looking. He was quiet, not speaking much, and sometimes for days he  would not say anything. He seemed to be thinking all the time. One morning  he told the girl that he had a dream and that he wished her to help him  build a pis'kun. She was afraid to ask him about the dream, for she thought  if she asked questions he might not like it. So she just said she was ready  to do what he wished. They built the pis'kun, and when it was finished, the  boy said to his sister: \"The buffalo are to come to us, and you are not to  see them. When the time comes, you are to cover your head and to hold your  face close to the ground; and do not lift your head nor look, until I throw  a piece of kidney to you.\" The girl said, \"It shall be as you say.\"    When the time came, the boy told her where to go; and she went to the  place, a little way from the lodge, not far from the corral, and sat down  on the ground, and covered her head, holding her face close to the  earth. After she had sat there a little while, she heard the sound of  animals running, and she was excited and curious, and raised her head to  look; but all she saw was her brother, standing near, looking at  her. Before he could speak, she said to him: \"I thought I heard buffalo  coming, and because I was anxious for food, I forgot my promise and  looked. Forgive me this time, and I will try again.\" Again she bent her  face to the ground, and covered her head.    Soon she heard again the sound of animals running, at first a long way off,  and then coming nearer and nearer, until at last they seemed close, and she  thought they were going to run over her. She sprang up in fright and looked  about, but there was nothing to be seen but her brother, looking sadly at  her. She went close to him and said: \"Pity me. I was afraid, for I thought  the buffalo were going to run over me.\" He said: \"This is the last time. If  again you look, we will starve; but if you do not look, we will always have  plenty, and will never be without meat.\" The girl looked at him, and said,  \"I will try hard this time, and even if those animals run right over me, I  will not look until you throw the kidney to me.\" Again she covered her  head, pressing her face against the earth and putting her hands against her  ears, so that she might not hear. Suddenly, sooner than she thought, she  felt the blow from the meat thrown at her, and, springing up, she seized  the kidney and began to eat it. Not far away was her brother, bending over  a fat cow; and, going up to him, she helped him with the butchering. After  that was done, she kindled a fire and cooked the best parts of the meat,  and they ate and were satisfied.    The boy became a great hunter. He made fine arrows that went faster than a  bird could fly, and when he was hunting, he watched all the animals and all  the birds, and learned their ways, and how to imitate them when they  called. While he was hunting, the girl dressed buffalo hides and the skins  of deer and other animals. She made a fine new lodge, and the boy painted  it with figures of all the birds and the animals he had killed.    One day, when the girl was bringing water, she saw a little way off a  person coming. When she went in the lodge, she told her brother, and he  went out to meet the stranger. He found that he was friendly and was  hunting, but had had bad luck and killed nothing. He was starving and in  despair, when he saw this lone lodge and made up his mind to go to it. As  he came near it, he began to be afraid, and to wonder if the people who  lived there were enemies or ghosts; but he thought, \"I may as well die here  as starve,\" so he went boldly to it. The strange person was very much  surprised to see this handsome young man with the kind face, who could  speak his own language. The boy took him into the lodge, and the girl put  food before him. After he had eaten, he told his story, saying that the  game had left them, and that many of his people were dying of hunger. As  he talked, the girl listened; and at last she remembered the man, and knew  that he belonged to her camp. She asked him questions, and he talked about  all the people in the camp, and even spoke of the old woman who owned the  dog. The boy advised the stranger, after he had rested, to return to his  camp, and tell the people to move up to this place, that here they would  find plenty of game. After he had gone, the boy and his sister talked of  these things. The girl had often told him what she had suffered, what the  chief had said and done, and how their own parents had turned against her,  and that the only person whose heart had been good to her was this old  woman. As the young man heard all this again, he was angry at his parents  and the chief, but he felt great kindness for the old woman and her  dog. When he learned that those bad people were living, he made up his mind  that they should suffer and die.    When the strange person reached his own camp, he told the people how well  he had been treated by these two persons, and that they wished him to bring  the whole camp to where they were, and that there they should have plenty.  This made great joy in the camp, and all got ready to move. When they  reached the lost children's camp, they found everything as the stranger had  said. The brother gave a feast; and to those whom he liked he gave many  presents, but to the old woman and the dog he gave the best presents of  all. To the chief nothing at all was given, and this made him very much  ashamed. To the parents no food was given, but the boy tied a bone to the  lodge poles above the fire, and told the parents to eat from it without  touching it with their hands. They were very hungry, and tried to eat from  this bone; and as they were stretching out their necks to reach it--for it  was above them--the boy cut off their heads with his knife. This frightened  all the people, the chief most of all; but the boy told them how it all  was, and how he and his sister had survived.    When he had finished speaking, the chief said he was sorry for what he had  done, and he proposed to his people that this young man should be made  their chief. They were glad to do this. The boy was made the chief, and  lived long to rule the people in that camp.        MIK-A'PI--RED OLD MAN      I    It was in the valley of \"It fell on them\"[1] Creek, near the mountains,  that the Pik[)u]n'i were camped when Mik-a'pi went to war. It was far back,  in the days of stone knives, long before the white people had come. This  was the way it happened.    [Footnote 1: Armells Creek in Northern Montana is called  _Et-tsis-ki-ots-op_, \"It fell on them.\" A longtime ago a number of  Blackfeet women were digging in a bank near this creek for the red clay  which they use for paint, when the bank gave way and fell on them, burying  and killing them.]    Early in the morning a band of buffalo were seen in the foot-hills of the  mountains, and some hunters went out to get meat. Carefully they crawled  along up the coulees and drew near to the herd; and, when they had come  close to them, they began to shoot, and their arrows pierced many fat  cows. But even while they were thus shooting, they were surprised by a war  party of Snakes, and they began to run back toward the camp. There was one  hunter, named Fox-eye, who was very brave. He called to the others to stop,  saying: \"They are many and we are few, but the Snakes are not brave. Let us  stop and fight them.\" But the other hunters would not listen. \"We have no  shields,\" they said, \"nor our war medicine. There are many of the  enemy. Why should we foolishly die?\"    They hurried on to camp, but Fox-eye would not turn back. He drew his  arrows from the quiver, and prepared to fight. But, even as he placed an  arrow, a Snake had crawled up by his side, unseen. In the still air, the  Piegan heard the sharp twang of a bow string, but, before he could turn his  head, the long, fine-pointed arrow pierced him through and through.

So I watch and listen for the knock at the door,  and do you believe me, brother, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I  hears a knock and opens the door, and a strange lady was there, one I  never saw before, and asked me if Mrs. H---- lived here; and said she  had been looking for us before, but could not find us; 'when, to-day I  felt I must try again, and I am so glad I have found you. I heard of you  through a friend who has known you a long time.' She spoke many kind  words, and when she took my hand to say good-by, she left a little roll  of notes, and when she is gone I count it, and _it was just three  dollars._ I is been so happy ever since. I loves to tell how good the  Lord has been to us; every time I does so I feels so happy.\"      INCIDENTS IN THE LIFE OF AN INVALID.--HOW GOD CARES AND COMFORTS IN  SMALL THINGS.      The following incidents are from the life of an invalid, personally  known to the editor of this book, and can be depended upon as authentic  in every particular. They illustrate most beautifully the blessed way in  which the Savior's everlasting arms are around, strengthening, and His  presence comforting His weak and helpless ones, in all their little as  well as great trials of life. The ways in which he sent relief, and the  many hundred promises which he has given; will encourage other Christian  hearts to trust the same _Omnipotent, ever Helping Friend._      GIVING HER LAST MONEY TO THE LORD.      \"'The first money the Lord gives me I will send to you,' were the last  words I said to my old father, as I stood waiting for the train to bear  me to distant friends. So the weeks passed on, but I remembered my  promise and waited patiently for the Lord to enable me to fulfill that  promise. I had two dollars, but thought I must not give it away until  more came. But this feeling did not last long; something seemed to tell  me the Lord would not send me any until that was gone. One day I  received a letter from a friend containing this sentence: 'I have not  had three cents in five weeks.' My whole nature responded in a moment. I  put part of my money into a letter for him, the rest into a letter for  my father. Now I felt clear. Then I told the Lord all about it. A week  passed, and $5 came to me from my mother to pay my return fare. A few  days longer, and another $5 came from a lady friend, so I was provided  for. I needed a certain article of clothing, and one night made all  arrangements to get it next day. Morning came, and I went to the Bible  for my orders for the day; my eyes rested on these words: 'Be content  with what ye have.' This seemed so strange, because the Lord knew I  needed the dress; I was obliged to stay out of society on this account.  'But the Lord knows best,' I thought, and gave up all idea of getting  it. Nor did it trouble me further. I gave it all into his hands, feeling  He knew best. And afterwards it was made clear to my own heart I had not  trusted in vain. _'Commit all thy ways unto the Lord, for He careth for  thee.'\"_      MONEY WANTED TO PAY RAILROAD FARE.      \"Once, on a visit, I left the company below, and went up stairs for an  hour's quiet and prayer. I was to return the coming week and I had only  just enough to pay my fare. For several days I had been anxious how I  was to get some money. This afternoon I had to pray very earnestly,  because the need was great. An hour passed; I felt weary and  unrefreshed, when a voice clear and near said unto me: 'Trust in the  Lord and do good, and verily thou shalt be fed.' It was not a human  voice, for no one was near me, but I started and looked around, _almost_  expecting to see an angel visitant. I saw nothing, but the sun shone  brighter outside, and the room seemed brighter than before. And why  should it not? The Lord had been there with words of cheer and comfort  for his little child. I arose and went below, where I found other  company had called, and I was introduced to the lady and her husband,  whom I had met five years before. A pleasant chat and they left, after  giving me an invitation to visit them. At the door, as I learned from my  friend who attended them, Mrs. N---- said: 'I should like to give Miss  B---- something,' and handed my friend _a five dollar bill for me_. I  was more than surprised. I cannot tell you the emotions of my heart.  While I was yet asking, even, the messenger had brought my answer. I  could yet hear the soft sound of the voice up-stairs, and the soothing  influence of the unseen presence still lingered round me. How quickly  our needs flow on the wings of prayer into the very presence of our  Friend and Master.\"      PRAYER SAVES THE LIFE OF A LITTLE CHILD.      \"A year ago this Summer, my sister's little baby, only five months old,  was taken very ill with that distressing complaint which often proves so  fatal, and takes so many sweet little ones out of loving hearts and  homes. I loved baby Ernest, but never so well as when he lay so sick he  could not know it. We all loved him, and everything was done that could  be thought of to ease the little sufferer all those long, close, hot  days. Day after day, for four long weeks, we tenderly cared for him.  Sometimes his mother would watch his every breath, fearing each would be  the last. One Sunday he lay just where we put him, so quiet and still,  with the sweet baby face so white and calm, we thought we should lose  him soon, the little hands and feet were so cold. All through his  illness, I kept asking the Lord to let his parents keep the tender bud  he had sent them. We could not let him die, and to-day I prayed very  earnestly all the time--even when we could not warm the little body at  all--we could not let him go. Well, Ernnie passed over the fearful day  and became a happy, well boy. He was saved. No physician saved him. Our  tender care did not save him. Prayer saved our Ernnie. Precious baby! He  is such a jolly, happy boy now, filling every heart and the whole house  with his sunshine. How I love the little fellow. When I am here at his  home, he always comes to Auntie for love and tenderness. When I am  resting on the lounge, he comes every few moments to kiss me, giving and  receiving real heart-love. We know God only lends these little treasures  to their human friends. But oh, they bring so much love with them, it is  hard to give them up.\"      THE LOST THIMBLE.      \"One day I lost my silver thimble, a gift from my mother when I was a  young girl. I prized it _very highly_. I looked everywhere, long and  faithfully. The tears would come, at the best, it had been so long a  constant companion. I gave up the search after a while, thinking some  one had taken it, or a child had lost it--any way, it was gone. Feeling  sad over it, I sat down to console myself, and the thought came--pray  about it; so I did, and while I knelt there something whispered, 'Look  on the bed,' so plainly that I arose and went into my sister's  sleeping-room where I had turned the spread aside, and there nestled, in  a fold of the quilt, _my thimble_. I involuntarily said, 'Thank God!'  out of the depths of my glad heart. I had lain down a moment on this bed  with baby Ernest, early in the morning, and the thimble had fallen out  of my pocket.\"      A PRAYER FOR $25.        \"God moves in a mysterious way      His wonders to perform.\"      \"I had a present of twenty-five dollars once, which was a direct answer  to earnest, pleading prayer. I was entirely out of money for months--I  could not earn a dollar. I had those who might have assisted me, but  they did not. I could have borrowed, but I might never be able to return  it; I knew not what to do. One evening, thinking it all over, scanning  the dark cloud with anxious eyes, I said, 'If the Lord cannot help me,  no one else can; I will ask Him.' And so I did, bringing all the  previous promises before Him, pleading my unworthiness, but my great  need; asking first for _ten dollars_; then, as I grew more earnest, I  asked for _twenty-five,_ feeling almost frightened as the words came  from my lips. Sometimes the thought would intrude, 'How can you ask for  any given sum--how do you expect it will come?' so I said, one day, to  the Lord, 'Any sum you choose; you know best; I will be content.'  Several weeks passed, and a sweet feeling of rest and assurance came,  that, whatever came of it, would be all for the best. But, by-and-by,  when the anxious pleading feeling was all gone, one morning came a  letter from one I had never seen, with $25--just what I had asked for. I  cannot tell you just how I felt; I only know I held the check long in my  hand, scarcely realizing it could be for me.\"      PRAYING FOR OTHERS.      \"My sister's husband wished to raise a certain sum of interest money by  a given time, but could see no way; was very much troubled about it;  said he knew no one to whom he could apply. I told him to pray for it.  He answered, 'God won't hear the prayer of the wicked; suppose you ask  him yourself.' I did ask Him, earnestly and faithfully, and it was even  given me the idea who my brother could ask to loan it him. I spoke of  the man to him--said I thought he might get it; so he called on him one  evening, and the way was made plain for my brother to introduce the  subject; and when he came home that night, he brought with him the three  hundred dollars.\"      A VISIT TO FRIENDS.         \"I will hold thee by thy right hand, saying unto thee, fear       not, I will help thee.\"      \"Once I held in my hand an open letter, containing an invitation to  visit friends I had never seen. My heart bounded with pleasure at  thought of the journey, and the pleasant visit to follow; but, on second  thought, it almost stood still--where could I get money and proper  clothing? Several weeks passed in thought. I could see no way, and so I  wrote my friends I could not come at present; but, in my heart, I could  not give it up. My parents were visiting in the"]]]
