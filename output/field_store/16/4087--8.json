To the door of this pleasure emporium came Donnegan. He had transformed  himself into the ragged hobo by the jerking down of his cap again, and  the hunching of his shoulders. And shrinking past the bar with a hungry  sidewise glance, as one who did not dare present himself for free  liquor, he entered Milligan's.    That is, he had put his foot across the threshold when he was caught  roughly by the shoulder and dragged to one side. He found himself  looking up into the face of a strapping fellow who served Milligan as  bouncer. Milligan had an eye for color. Andy Lewis was tolerably well  known as a fighting man of parts, who not only wore two guns but could  use them both at once, which is much more difficult than is generally  understood. But far more than for his fighting parts Milligan hired his  bouncer for the sake of his face. It was a countenance made to  discourage trouble makers. A mule had kicked Lewis in the chin, and a  great white welt deformed his lower lip. Scars of smallpox added to his  decorative effect, and he had those extremely bushy brows which for some  reason are generally considered to denote ferocity. Now, Donnegan was  not above middle height at best, and in his present shrinking attitude  he found himself looking up a full head into the formidable face of the  bouncer.    \"And what are you doing in here?\" asked the genial Andy. \"Don't you know  this joint is for white folks?\"    \"I ain't colored,\" murmured Donnegan.    \"You took considerable yaller to me,\" declared Lewis. He straightway  chuckled, and his own keen appreciation of his wit softened his  expression. \"What you want?\"    Donnegan shivered under his rags.    \"I want to see Jack Landis,\" he said.    It had a wonderful effect upon the doorkeeper. Donnegan found that the  very name of Landis was a charm of power in The Corner.    \"You want to see him?\" he queried in amazement. \"You?\"    He looked Donnegan over again, and then grinned broadly, as if in  anticipation. \"Well, go ahead. There he sits--no, he's dancing.\"    The music was in full swing; it was chiefly brass; but now and then, in  softer moments, one could hear a violin squeaking uncertainly. At least  it went along with a marked, regular rhythm, and the dancers swirled  industriously around the floor. A very gay crowd; color was apparently  appreciated in The Corner. And Donnegan, standing modestly out of sight  behind a pillar until the dance ended, noted twenty phases of life in  twenty faces. And Donnegan saw the flushes of liquor, and heard the loud  voices of happy fellows who had made their \"strikes\"; but in all that  brilliant crew he had no trouble in picking out Jack Landis and Nelly  Lebrun.    They danced together, and where they passed, the others steered a little  off so as to give them room on the dance floor, as if the men feared  that they might cross the formidable Landis, and as if the women feared  to be brought into too close comparison with Nelly Lebrun. She was,  indeed, a brilliant figure. She had eyes of the Creole duskiness, a  delicate olive skin, with a pastel coloring. The hand on the shoulder of  Landis was a thing of fairy beauty. And her eyes had that peculiar  quality of seeming to see everything, and rest on every face  particularly. So that, as she whirled toward Donnegan, he winced,  feeling that she had found him out among the shadows.    She had a glorious partner to set her off. And Donnegan saw bitterly  why Lou Macon could love him. Height without clumsiness, bulk and a  light foot at once, a fine head, well poised, blond hair and a Grecian  profile--such was Jack Landis. He wore a vest of fawn skin; his boots  were black in the foot and finished with the softest red leather for the  leg. And he had yellow buckskin trousers, laced in a Mexican fashion  with silver at the sides; a narrow belt, a long, red silk handkerchief  flying from behind his neck in cowboy fashion. So much flashing  splendor, even in that gay assembly, would have been childishly  conspicuous on another man. But in big Jack Landis there was patently a  great deal of the unaffected child. He was having a glorious time on  this evening, and his eye roved the room challenging admiration in a  manner that was amusing rather than offensive. He was so overflowingly  proud of having the prettiest girl in The Corner upon his arm and so  conscious of being himself probably the finest-looking man that he  escaped conceit, it might almost be said, by his very excess of it.    Upon this splendid individual, then, the obscure Donnegan bent his gaze.  He saw the dancers pause and scatter as the music ended, saw them drift  to the tables along the edges of the room, saw the scurry of waiters  hurrying drinks up in the interval, saw Nelly Lebrun sip a lemonade, saw  Jack Landis toss off something stronger. And then Donnegan skirted  around the room and came to the table of Jack Landis at the very moment  when the latter was tossing a gold piece to the waiter and giving a new  order.    Prodigal sons in the distance of thought are apt to be both silly: and  disgusting, but at close hand they usually dazzle the eye. Even the cold  brain of Donnegan was daunted a little as he drew near.    He came behind the chair of the tall master of The Corner, and while  Nelly Lebrun stopped her glass halfway to her lips and stared at the  ragged stranger, Donnegan was whispering in the ear of Jack Landis:  \"I've got to see you alone.\"    Landis turned his head slowly and his eye darkened a little as he met  the reddish, unshaven face of the stranger. Then, with a careless shrug  of distaste, he drew out a few coins and poured them into Donnegan's  palm; the latter pocketed them.    \"Lou Macon,\" said Donnegan.    Jack Landis rose from his chair, and it was not until he stood so close  to Donnegan that the latter realized the truly Herculean proportions of  the young fellow. He bowed his excuses to Nelly Lebrun, not without  grace of manner, and then huddled Donnegan into a corner with a wave of  his vast arm.    \"Now what do you want? Who are you? Who put that name in your mouth?\"    \"She's in The Corner,\" said Donnegan, and he dwelt upon the face of Jack  Landis with feverish suspense. A moment later a great weight had slipped  from his heart. If Lou Macon loved Landis it was beyond peradventure  that Landis was not breaking his heart because of the girl. For at her  name he flushed darkly, and then, that rush of color fading, he was left  with a white spot in the center of each cheek.          13      First his glance plunged into vacancy; then it flicked over his shoulder  at Nelly Lebrun and he bit his lip. Plainly, it was not the most welcome  news that Jack Landis had ever heard.    \"Where is she?\" he asked nervously of Donnegan, and he looked over the  ragged fellow again.    \"I'll take you to her.\"    The big man swayed back and forth from foot to foot, balancing in his  hesitation. \"Wait a moment.\"    He strode to Nelly Lebrun and bent over her; Donnegan saw her eyes flash  up--oh, heart of the south, what eyes of shadow and fire! Jack Landis  trembled under the glance; yes, he was deeply in love with the girl. And  Donnegan watched her face shade with suspicion, stiffen with cold anger,  warm and soften again under the explanations of Jack Landis.    Donnegan, looking from the distance, could read everything; it is  nearness that bewitches a man when he talks to a woman. When Odysseus  talked to Circe, no doubt he stood on the farther side of the room!    When Landis came again, he was perspiring from the trial of fire  through which he had just passed.    \"Come,\" he ordered, and set out at a sweeping stride.    Plainly he was anxious to get this matter done with as soon as possible.  As for Donnegan, he saw a man whom Landis had summoned to take his place  sit down at the table with Nelly Lebrun. She was laughing with the  newcomer as though nothing troubled her at all, but over his shoulder  her glance probed the distance and followed Jack Landis. She wanted to  see the messenger again, the man who had called her companion away; but  in this it was fox challenging fox. Donnegan took note and was careful  to place between him and the girl every pillar and every group of  people. As far as he was concerned, her first glance must do to read and  judge and remember him by.    Outside Landis shot several questions at him in swift succession; he  wanted to know how the girl had happened to make the trip. Above all,  what the colonel was thinking and doing and if the colonel himself had  come. But Donnegan replied with monosyllables, and Landis, apparently  reconciling himself to the fact that the messenger was a fool, ceased  his questions. They kept close to a run all the way out of the camp and  up the hillside to the two detached tents where Donnegan and the girl  slept that night. A lantern burned in both the tents.    \"She has made things ready for me,\" thought Donnegan, his heart opening.  \"She has kept house for me!\"    He pointed out Lou's tent to his companion and the big man, with a  single low word of warning, threw open the flap of the tent and strode  in.    There was only the split part of a second between the rising and the  fall of the canvas, but in that swift interval, Donnegan saw the girl  starting up to receive Landis. Her calm was broken at last. Her cheeks  were flushed; her eyes were starry with what? Expectancy? Love?    It stopped Donnegan like a blow in the face and turned his heart to  lead; and then, shamelessly, he glided around the tent and dropped down  beside it to eavesdrop. After all, there was some excuse. If she loved  the man he, Donnegan, would let him live; if she did not love him, he,  Donnegan, would kill him like a worthless rat under heel. That is, if he  could. No wonder that the wanderer listened with heart and soul!    He missed the first greeting.

Ye host of heaven! whose glory I survey!  O beg ye grace for those, that are on earth  All after ill example gone astray.  War once had for its instrument the sword:  But now 't is made, taking the bread away  Which the good Father locks from none.  --And thou,  That writes but to cancel, think, that they,  Who for the vineyard, which thou wastest, died,  Peter and Paul live yet, and mark thy doings.  Thou hast good cause to cry, \"My heart so cleaves  To him, that liv'd in solitude remote,  And from the wilds was dragg'd to martyrdom,  I wist not of the fisherman nor Paul.\"          CANTO XIX    Before my sight appear'd, with open wings,  The beauteous image, in fruition sweet  Gladdening the thronged spirits.  Each did seem  A little ruby, whereon so intense  The sun-beam glow'd that to mine eyes it came  In clear refraction.  And that, which next  Befalls me to portray, voice hath not utter'd,  Nor hath ink written, nor in fantasy  Was e'er conceiv'd.  For I beheld and heard  The beak discourse; and, what intention form'd  Of many, singly as of one express,  Beginning: \"For that I was just and piteous,  l am exalted to this height of glory,  The which no wish exceeds: and there on earth  Have I my memory left, e'en by the bad  Commended, while they leave its course untrod.\"    Thus is one heat from many embers felt,  As in that image many were the loves,  And one the voice, that issued from them all.  Whence I address them: \"O perennial flowers  Of gladness everlasting! that exhale  In single breath your odours manifold!  Breathe now; and let the hunger be appeas'd,  That with great craving long hath held my soul,  Finding no food on earth.  This well I know,  That if there be in heav'n a realm, that shows  In faithful mirror the celestial Justice,  Yours without veil reflects it.  Ye discern  The heed, wherewith I do prepare myself  To hearken; ye the doubt that urges me  With such inveterate craving.\"  Straight I saw,  Like to a falcon issuing from the hood,  That rears his head, and claps him with his wings,  His beauty and his eagerness bewraying.  So saw I move that stately sign, with praise  Of grace divine inwoven and high song  Of inexpressive joy.  \"He,\" it began,  \"Who turn'd his compass on the world's extreme,  And in that space so variously hath wrought,  Both openly, and in secret, in such wise  Could not through all the universe display  Impression of his glory, that the Word  Of his omniscience should not still remain  In infinite excess.  In proof whereof,  He first through pride supplanted, who was sum  Of each created being, waited not  For light celestial, and abortive fell.  Whence needs each lesser nature is but scant  Receptacle unto that Good, which knows  No limit, measur'd by itself alone.  Therefore your sight, of th' omnipresent Mind  A single beam, its origin must own  Surpassing far its utmost potency.  The ken, your world is gifted with, descends  In th' everlasting Justice as low down,  As eye doth in the sea; which though it mark  The bottom from the shore, in the wide main  Discerns it not; and ne'ertheless it is,  But hidden through its deepness.  Light is none,  Save that which cometh from the pure serene  Of ne'er disturbed ether: for the rest,  'Tis darkness all, or shadow of the flesh,  Or else its poison.  Here confess reveal'd  That covert, which hath hidden from thy search  The living justice, of the which thou mad'st  Such frequent question; for thou saidst--'A man  Is born on Indus' banks, and none is there  Who speaks of Christ, nor who doth read nor write,  And all his inclinations and his acts,  As far as human reason sees, are good,  And he offendeth not in word or deed.  But unbaptiz'd he dies, and void of faith.  Where is the justice that condemns him?  where  His blame, if he believeth not?'--What then,  And who art thou, that on the stool wouldst sit  To judge at distance of a thousand miles  With the short-sighted vision of a span?  To him, who subtilizes thus with me,  There would assuredly be room for doubt  Even to wonder, did not the safe word  Of scripture hold supreme authority.    \"O animals of clay!  O spirits gross I  The primal will, that in itself is good,  Hath from itself, the chief Good, ne'er been mov'd.  Justice consists in consonance with it,  Derivable by no created good,  Whose very cause depends upon its beam.\"    As on her nest the stork, that turns about  Unto her young, whom lately she hath fed,  While they with upward eyes do look on her;  So lifted I my gaze; and bending so  The ever-blessed image wav'd its wings,  Lab'ring with such deep counsel.  Wheeling round  It warbled, and did say: \"As are my notes  To thee, who understand'st them not, such is  Th' eternal judgment unto mortal ken.\"    Then still abiding in that ensign rang'd,  Wherewith the Romans over-awed the world,  Those burning splendours of the Holy Spirit  Took up the strain; and thus it spake again:  \"None ever hath ascended to this realm,  Who hath not a believer been in Christ,  Either before or after the blest limbs  Were nail'd upon the wood.  But lo! of those  Who call 'Christ, Christ,' there shall be many found,   In judgment, further off from him by far,  Than such, to whom his name was never known.  Christians like these the Ethiop shall condemn:  When that the two assemblages shall part;  One rich eternally, the other poor.    \"What may the Persians say unto your kings,  When they shall see that volume, in the which  All their dispraise is written, spread to view?  There amidst Albert's works shall that be read,  Which will give speedy motion to the pen,  When Prague shall mourn her desolated realm.  There shall be read the woe, that he doth work  With his adulterate money on the Seine,  Who by the tusk will perish: there be read  The thirsting pride, that maketh fool alike  The English and Scot, impatient of their bound.  There shall be seen the Spaniard's luxury,  The delicate living there of the Bohemian,  Who still to worth has been a willing stranger.  The halter of Jerusalem shall see  A unit for his virtue, for his vices  No less a mark than million.  He, who guards  The isle of fire by old Anchises honour'd  Shall find his avarice there and cowardice;  And better to denote his littleness,  The writing must be letters maim'd, that speak  Much in a narrow space.  All there shall know  His uncle and his brother's filthy doings,  Who so renown'd a nation and two crowns  Have bastardized.  And they, of Portugal  And Norway, there shall be expos'd with him  Of Ratza, who hath counterfeited ill  The coin of Venice.  O blest Hungary!  If thou no longer patiently abid'st  Thy ill-entreating! and, O blest Navarre!  If with thy mountainous girdle thou wouldst arm thee  In earnest of that day, e'en now are heard  Wailings and groans in Famagosta's streets  And Nicosia's, grudging at their beast,  Who keepeth even footing with the rest.\"          CANTO XX    When, disappearing, from our hemisphere,  The world's enlightener vanishes, and day  On all sides wasteth, suddenly the sky,  Erewhile irradiate only with his beam,  Is yet again unfolded, putting forth  Innumerable lights wherein one shines.  Of such vicissitude in heaven I thought,  As the great sign, that marshaleth the world  And the world's leaders, in the blessed beak  Was silent; for that all those living lights,  Waxing in splendour, burst forth into songs,  Such as from memory glide and fall away.    Sweet love! that dost apparel thee in smiles,  How lustrous was thy semblance in those sparkles,  Which merely are from holy thoughts inspir'd!    After the precious and bright beaming stones,  That did ingem the sixth light, ceas'd the chiming  Of their angelic bells; methought I heard  The murmuring of a river, that doth fall  From rock to rock transpicuous, making known  The richness of his spring-head: and as sound  Of cistern, at the fret-board, or of pipe,  Is, at the wind-hole, modulate and tun'd;  Thus up the neck, as it were hollow, rose  That murmuring of the eagle, and forthwith  Voice there assum'd, and thence along the beak  Issued in form of words, such as my heart  Did look for, on whose tables I inscrib'd them.    \"The part in me, that sees, and bears the sun,,  In mortal eagles,\" it began, \"must now  Be noted steadfastly: for of the fires,  That figure me, those, glittering in mine eye,  Are chief of all the greatest.  This, that shines  Midmost for pupil, was the same, who sang  The Holy Spirit's song, and bare about  The ark from town to town; now doth he know  The merit of his soul-impassion'd strains  By their well-fitted guerdon.  Of the five,  That make the circle of the vision, he  Who to the beak is nearest, comforted  The widow for her son: now doth he know  How dear he costeth not to follow Christ,  Both from experience of this pleasant life,  And of its opposite.  He next, who follows  In the circumference, for the over arch,  By true repenting slack'd the pace of death:  Now knoweth he, that the degrees of heav'n  Alter not, when through pious prayer below  Today's is made tomorrow's destiny.  The other following, with the laws and me,  To yield the shepherd room, pass'd o'er to Greece,  From good intent producing evil fruit:  Now knoweth he, how all the ill, deriv'd  From his well doing, doth not helm him aught,  Though it have brought destruction on the world.  That, which thou seest in the under bow,  Was William, whom that land bewails, which weeps  For Charles and Frederick living: now he knows  How well is lov'd in heav'n the righteous king,  Which he betokens by his radiant seeming.  Who in the erring world beneath would deem,  That Trojan Ripheus in this round was set  Fifth of the saintly splendours?  now he knows  Enough"]]]
