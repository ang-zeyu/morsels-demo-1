Who  is mighty?  He who controls his passions, as it is said, 'He that is  slow to anger is better than the mighty, and he that ruleth over his  spirit than he that taketh a city' (3).  Who is rich?  He who rejoices  in his portion, as it is said, 'When thou eatest the labor of thine  hands, happy art thou, and it shall be well with thee' (4); happy art  thou in this world, and it shall be well with thee in the world to  come.  Who is honored?  He who honors others, as it is said, 'For them  that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be held in  contempt'\" (5).          (1) Simon ben Zoma and Simon ben Azzai, _Tannaim_ of the        second century, were generally known as ben Zoma and ben        Azzai, as they never received the title of Rabbi, according to        one view.  According to another opinion, they were called by        their fathers' names, because they both died young.  Together        with Akiba and Elisha ben Abuyah (_Acher_), they entered,        legend says, into the paradise of esoteric knowledge.  \"Four        (sages),\" we are told, \"entered paradise, ben Azzai, ben Zoma,        Acher, and Akiba.  Ben Azzai looked and died; ben Zoma went        mad; Acher destroyed the plants; Akiba alone came out unhurt\"        (_Chagigah_, 14b).  The interpretation of this passage is that        ben Azzai died prematurely, worn out by his activities in        mystical and theosophic speculation; ben Zoma became demented        thereby; Elisha, contemptuously referred to as Acher (the        other), became an apostate; but Akiba was unaffected.  Ben        Zoma was famous for his wisdom, it being said of him, \"Whoever        sees ben Zoma in his dream is assured of scholarship\"        (_Berachot_, 57b).  With him, it was said, the last of the        interpreters of the Law (_darshanim_) died (_Sotah_, 49b).        His interpretation of the biblical passage \"that thou mayest        remember when thou camest forth out of Egypt\" is found in the        _Haggadah_ of Passover eve.  See Bacher, _Agada der Tanaiten_,        pp. 425-532; Schechter, _Studies_, I, pp. 129-130; H.        Sperling, in _Aspects of the Hebrew Genius_, p. 150.          (2) Ps. CXIX, 9.          (3) Prov. XVI, 32.          (4) Ps. CXXVIII, 2.  The discontented rich man, even, is poor.          (5) I Sam. II, 30.    2. Ben Azzai (6) said, \"Hasten to do even a slight precept (7), and  flee from transgression; for one virtue leads to another, and  transgression draws transgression in its train; for the recompense of  a virtue is a virtue, and the recompense of a transgression is a  transgression\" (8).  3. He used to say, \"Despise not any man, and carp  not at any thing (9); for there is not a man that has not his hour,  and there is not a thing that has not its place.\"          (6) Simon ben Azzai (see n. 1) was a very assiduous student        and a man of great piety.  He was betrothed to the daughter of        Akiba, but separated from his prospective wife in order to        devote all of his time to study.  It was said of him, \"At the        death of ben Azzai, the last industrious man passed away\"        (_Sotah_ IX, 15), and \"He who sees ben Azzai in a dream might        hope for saintliness.\"  He declared that the greatest        principle of Judaism is the belief in the common brotherhood        of all mankind, which he derived from the passage, Genesis VI,        1, \"This is the generation of Adam (man).\"  See Bacher,        _ibid._, 409-424.          (7) Cf. chapter II, 1.          (8) Well-doing is the fruit of well-doing, and evil-doing the        fruit of evil-doing.          (9) Or \"do not consider anything as being impossible.\"    4. R. Levitas of Jabneh said, \"Be exceedingly lowly of spirit (10),  since the hope of man is but the worm.\"          (10) R. Levitas lived probably about 120 C.E.  Maimonides        declares that the medium way between the extremes of the _too        little_ and the _too much_ is the path of virtue, but he makes        an exception in the case of humility, and, in accordance with        this passage, considers the extreme of being very humble the        virtue.  See Gorfinkle, _The Eight Chapters_, p. 60, n. 2.    5. R. Jochanan, the son of Berokah (11), said, \"Whosoever profanes the  Name of Heaven (12) in secret will suffer the penalty for it in  public; and this, whether the Heavenly Name be profaned in ignorance  or in wilfulness.\"          (11) A contemporary of Akiba.          (12) \"Name of Heaven\" is a common substitute for the \"name of        God.\"    6. R. Ishmael (13), his son, said, \"He who learns in order to teach  (14), to him the means will be granted both to learn and to teach; but  he who learns in order to practise, to him the means will be granted  to learn, and to teach, to observe, and to practise.\"          (13) He lived about 150 C.E.          (14) To one who learns _Torah_ and does not teach it are        applied the words in Num. XV, 31: \"he hath despised the word        of the Lord\" (_Sanhedrin_, 99a).    7. R. Zadok said, \"Separate not thyself from the congregation; (in the  judge's office) act not the counsel's part (15); make not of the  _Torah_ a crown wherewith to aggrandize thyself, nor a spade wherewith  to dig\" (16).  So also used Hillel to say, \"He who makes a worldly use  of the crown (of the _Torah_) shall waste away\" (17).  Hence thou  mayest infer that whosoever derives a profit for himself from the  words of the _Torah_ is helping on his own destruction.          (15) Cf. chapter I, 8.          (16) _I.e._, for material and selfish ends.          (17) Cf. chapter I, 13.    8. R. Jose (18) said, \"Whoso honors the _Torah_ will himself be  honored by mankind, but whoso dishonors the _Torah_ will himself be  dishonored by mankind.\"          (18) R. Jose ben Chalafta was a contemporary of R. Meir.    9. R. Ishmael (19), his son, said, \"He who shuns the judicial office  rids himself of hatred, robbery, and vain swearing (20); but he who  presumptuously lays down decisions is foolish, wicked, and of an  arrogant spirit.\"  10. He used to say, \"Judge not alone, for none may  judge alone save One; neither say (to thy judicial colleagues),  'Accept my view,' for the choice is theirs (to concur); and it is not  for thee (to compel concurrence).\"          (19) He lived about 160-220 C.E.          (20) The judge brings upon himself the hatred of the one who        is disappointed by his judgment.  An erroneous judgment is        equivalent to robbery.  When the judge exacts an unnecessary        oath, perjury may result.    11. R. Jonathan (21) said, \"Whoso fulfils the _Torah_ in the midst of  poverty shall in the end fulfil it in the midst of wealth; and whoso  neglects the _Torah_ in the midst of wealth shall in the end neglect  it in the midst of poverty.\"          (21) He lived about the middle of the second century C.E.  He        was a pupil of R. Ishmael (verse 9).    12. R. Meir (22) said, \"Lessen thy toil for worldly goods, and be busy  in the _Torah_; be humble of spirit before all men; if thou neglectest  the _Torah_, many causes for neglecting it will be present themselves  to thee, but if thou laborest in the _Torah_, He has abundant  recompense to give thee.\"          (22) See chapter III, n. 32.    13. R. Elieser (23), the son of Jacob, said, \"He who does one precept  has gotten himself one advocate; and he who commits one transgression  has gotten himself one accuser.  Repentance and good deeds are as a  shield against punishment.\"          (23) He lived about 140 C.E.    14. R. Jochanan, the sandal-maker (24), said, \"Every assembly which is  in the Name of Heaven will in the end be established, but that which  is not in the Name of Heaven will not in the end be established.\"          (24) Most of the Rabbis believed with Rabban Gamaliel that the        study of the _Torah_ without employment brings transgression        (chapter II, 2).  Consequently, each invariably followed some        vocation.  Hillel, the senior, gained his livelihood as a        wood-chopper; Shammai was a builder; R. Joshua, a blacksmith;        R. Chanina, a shoemaker; R. Huna, a water-carrier; R. Abba, a        tailor; R. Pappa, a brewer, etc.  Other Rabbis whose names        indicate their trades, as R. Jochanan ha-Sandalar (lived about        150 C.E.), were Isaac Nappacha (the smith) and R. Abin Naggara        (the carpenter).  Many were merchants and others        agriculturists.  Generally, the Rabbi studied during        two-thirds of the day, and worked at his trade during the        remainder.  Those engaged in agriculture would study in the        winter and till the soil in the summer.  Consult Franz        Delitzch, _Jewish Artisan Life in the Time of Christ_; and S.        Meyer, _Arbeit und Handwerk im Talmud_, Berlin, 1878.    15. R. Eleazer, the son of Shammua (25), said, \"Let the honor of thy  disciple be as dear to thee as thine own, and the honor of thine  associate be like the fear of thy master, and the fear of thy master  like the fear of Heaven.\"          (25) He lived about 150 C.E.    16. R. Judah (26) said, \"Be cautious in study, for an error in study  may amount to presumptuous sin\" (27).          (26) R. Judah ben Ilai lived about 140 C.E.          (27) Cf. Chapter III, 10.    17. R. Simeon (28) said, \"There are three crowns: the crown of  _Torah_, the crown of priesthood, and the crown of royalty; but the  crown of a good name excels them all.\"          (28) On R. Simeon ben Yochai, see chapter III, n. 12.    18. R. Nehorai (29) said, \"Betake thyself to a home of the _Torah_  (30), and say not that the _Torah_ will come after thee; for there thy  associates will establish thee in the possession of it; and lean not  upon thine own understanding\" (31).          (29) He lived about 130 C.E.          (30) If there is no teacher where you live.

Christmas was near at hand when William had finished this business, and  he celebrated at York the nativity of the Prince of Peace, doubtless with  no suspicion of inconsistency. Soon after Christmas, by a short but  difficult expedition, William drove the Danes from a position on the  coast which they had believed impregnable, and forced them to take to  their ships, in which, after suffering greatly from lack of supplies,  they drifted southward as if abandoning the land. During this expedition  also, we are told, Gospatric, who had rebelled the year before, and  Waltheof who had \"gone out\" on the coming of the Danes, made renewed  submission and were again received into favour by the king. The hopes  which the coming of foreign assistance had awakened were at an end.    One thing remained to be done. The men of the Welsh border must be taught  the lesson which the men of the Scottish border had learned. The  insurrection which had called William into Staffordshire the previous  autumn seems still to have lingered in the region. The strong city of  Chester, from which, or from whose neighbourhood at least, men had joined  the attack on Shrewsbury, and which commanded the north-eastern parts of  Wales, was still unsubdued. Soon after his return from the coast William  determined upon a longer and still more difficult winter march, across  the width of England, from York to Chester. It is no wonder that his army  murmured and some at least asked to be dismissed. The country through  which they must pass was still largely wilderness. Hills and forests,  swollen streams and winter storms, must be encountered, and the strife  with them was a test of endurance without the joy of combat. One  expedition of the sort in a winter ought to be enough. But William  treated the objectors with contempt. He pushed on as he had planned,  leaving those to stay behind who would, and but few were ready for open  mutiny. The hazardous march was made with success. What remained of the  insurrection disappeared before the coming of the king; it has left to us  at least no traces of any resistance. Chester was occupied without  opposition. Fortified posts were established and garrisons left there and  at Stafford. Some things make us suspect that a large district on this  side of England was treated as northern Yorkshire had been, and homeless  fugitives in crowds driven forth to die of hunger. The patience which  pardoned the faithlessness of Edwin and Waltheof was not called for in  dealing with smaller men.    From Chester William turned south. At Salisbury he dismissed with rich  rewards the soldiers who had been faithful to him, and at Winchester he  celebrated the Easter feast. There he found three legates who had been  sent from the pope, and supported by their presence he at last took up  the affairs of the English Church. The king had shown the greatest  caution in dealing with this matter. It must have been understood, almost  if not quite from the beginning of the Norman plan of invasion, that if  the attempt were successful, one of its results should be the revolution  of the English Church, the reform of the abuses which existed in it,  as the continental churchman regarded them, and as indeed they were.  During the past century a great reform movement, emanating from the  monastery of Cluny, had transformed the Catholic world, but in this  England had but little part. Starting as a monastic reformation, it  had just succeeded in bringing the whole Church under monastic control.  Henceforth the asceticism of the monk, his ideals in religion and  worship, his type of thought and learning, were to be those of the  official Church, from the papal throne to the country parsonage. It  was for that age a true reformation. The combined influence of the two  great temptations to which the churchmen of this period of the Middle  Ages were exposed--ignorance so easy to yield to, so hard to overcome,  and property, carrying with it rank and power and opening the way to  ambition for oneself or one's posterity--was so great that a rule of  strict asceticism, enforced by a powerful organization with fearful  sanctions, and a controlling ideal of personal devotion, alone could  overcome it. The monastic reformation had furnished these conditions,  though severe conflicts were still to be fought out before they would  be made to prevail in every part of western Europe. Shortly before the  appointment of Stigand to the archbishopric of Canterbury, these new  ideas had obtained possession of the papal throne in the person of Leo  IX, and with them other ideas which had become closely and almost  necessarily associated with them, of strict centralization under the  pope, of a theocratic papal supremacy, in line certainly with the  history of the Church, but more self-consciously held and logically  worked out than ever before.    In this great movement England had had no permanent share. Cut off from  easy contact with the currents of continental thought, not merely by the  channel but by the lack of any common interests and natural incentives to  common life, it stood in an earlier stage of development in  ecclesiastical matters, as in legal and constitutional. In organization,  in learning, and in conduct, ecclesiastical England at the eve of the  Norman Conquest may be compared not unfairly to ecclesiastical Europe of  the tenth century. There was the same loosening of the bonds of a common  organization, the same tendency to separate into local units shut up to  interest in themselves alone. National councils had practically ceased to  meet. The legislative machinery of the Church threatened to disappear in  that of the State. An outside body, the witenagemot, seemed about to  acquire the right of imposing rules and regulations upon the Church, and  another outside power, the king, to acquire the right of appointing its  officers. Quite as important in the eyes of the Church as the lack of  legislative independence was the lack of judicial independence, which was  also a defect of the English Church. The law of the Church as it bore  upon the life of the citizen was declared and enforced in the hundred or  shire court, and bishop and ealdorman sat together in the latter. Only  over the ecclesiastical faults of his clergy did the bishop have  exclusive jurisdiction, and this was probably a jurisdiction less well  developed than on the continent. The power of the primate over his  suffragans and of the bishop within his diocese was ill defined and  vague, and questions of disputed authority or doubtful allegiance  lingered long without exact decision, perhaps from lack of interest,  perhaps from want of the means of decision.    In learning, the condition was even worse. The cloister schools had  undergone a marked decline since the great days of Theodore and Alcuin.  Not merely were the parish priests ignorant men, but even bishops and  abbots. The universal language of learning and faith was neglected, and  in England alone, of all countries, theological books were written in the  local tongue, a sure sign of isolation and of the lack of interest in the  common philosophical life of the world. In moral conduct, while the  English clergy could not be held guilty of serious breaches of the  general ethical code, they were far from coming up to the special  standard which the canon law imposed upon the clergy, and which the  monastic reformation was making the inflexible law of the time. Married  priests abounded; there were said to be even married bishops. Simony was  not infrequent. Every churchman of high rank was likely to be a  pluralist, holding bishoprics and abbacies together, like Stigand, who  held with the primacy the bishopric of Winchester and many abbeys. That  such a man as Stigand, holding every ecclesiastical office that he could  manage to keep, depriving monasteries of their landed endowments with no  more right than the baron after him, refused recognition by every legally  elected pope, and thought unworthy to crown a king, or even in most cases  to consecrate a bishop, should have held his place for so many years as  unquestioned primate in all but the most important functions, is evidence  enough that the English Church had not yet been brought under the  influence of the great religious reformation of the eleventh century.    This was the chief defect of the England of that time--a defect upon all  sides of its life, which the Conquest remedied. It was an isolated land.  It stood in danger of becoming a Scandinavian land, not in blood merely,  or in absorption in an actual Scandinavian empire, but in withdrawal from  the real world, and in that tardy, almost reluctant, civilization which  was possibly a necessity for Scandinavia proper, but which would have  been for England a falling back from higher levels. It was the mission of  the Norman Conquest--if we may speak of a mission for great historical  events--to deliver England from this danger, and to bring her into the  full current of the active and progressive life of Christendom.    It was more than three years after the coronation of William before the  time was come for a thorough overhauling of the Church. So far as we  know, William, up to that time, had given no sign of his intentions. The  early adhesion of Stigand had been welcomed. The Normans seem to have  believed that he enjoyed great consideration and influence among the  Saxons, and he had been left undisturbed. He had even been allowed to  consecrate the new Norman bishop of Dorchester, which looks like an act  of deliberate policy. It had not seemed wise to alarm the Church so long  as the military issue of the invasion could be considered in any sense  doubtful, and not until the changes could be made with the powerful  support of the head of the Church directly expressed. It is a natural  guess, though we have no means of knowing, that Lanfranc's mission to  Rome "]]]
