Volume 5: Fruit and Fruit Desserts; (#11)"],[1," the acids and flavors are intended to serve as an  appetizer, or the same purpose for which the hot and highly seasoned  soups are taken. Therefore, they are seldom made sweet and are not taken  for their food value. Besides being refreshing appetizers, they afford a  hostess an opportunity to carry out a certain color scheme in a meal.  Many kinds of fruit may be combined into cocktails, but directions for  the cocktails that are usually made are here given. Fruit cocktails  should always be served ice cold.    116. GRAPEFRUIT COCKTAIL.--The cocktail here explained may be served in  stemmed glasses or in the shells of the grapefruit. If the fruit shells  are to be used, the grapefruit should be cut into two parts, half way  between the blossom and the stem ends, the fruit removed, and the edges  of the shell then notched. This plan of serving a cocktail should be  adopted only when small grapefruits are used, for if the shells are  large more fruit will have to be used than is agreeable for a cocktail.    GRAPEFRUIT COCKTAIL  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    2 grapefruits  2 oranges  1 c. diced pineapple, fresh or canned  Powdered sugar    Remove the pulp from the grapefruits and oranges in the manner  previously explained. However, if the grapefruit shells are to be used  for serving the cocktail, the grapefruit should be cut in half and the  pulp then taken out of the skin with a sharp knife. With the sections of  pulp removed, cut each one into several pieces. Add the diced pineapple  to the other fruits, mix together well and set on ice until thoroughly  chilled. Put in cocktail glasses or grapefruit shells, pour a spoonful  or two of orange juice over each serving, sprinkle with powdered sugar,  garnish with a cherry, and serve ice cold.    117. SUMMER COCKTAIL.--As strawberries and pineapples can be obtained  fresh at the same time during the summer, they are often used together  in a cocktail. When sweetened slightly with powdered sugar and allowed  to become ice cold, these fruits make a delicious combination.    SUMMER COCKTAIL  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    2 c. diced fresh pineapple  2 c. sliced strawberries  Powdered sugar    Prepare a fresh pineapple in the manner previously explained, and cut  each slice into small pieces or dice. Wash and hull the strawberries and  slice them into small slices. Mix the two fruits and sprinkle them with  powdered sugar. Place in cocktail glasses and allow to stand on ice a  short time before serving.    118. FRUIT COCKTAIL.--A fruit cocktail proper is made by combining a  number of different kinds of fruit, such as bananas, pineapple, oranges,  and maraschino cherries. As shown in Fig. 20, such a cocktail is served  in a stemmed glass set on a small plate. Nothing more delicious than  this can be prepared for the first course of a dinner or a luncheon that  is to be served daintily. Its advantage is that it can be made at almost  any season of the year with these particular fruits.    [Illustration: FIG. 20]    FRUIT COCKTAIL  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    2 bananas  1 c. canned pineapple  2 oranges  1 doz. maraschino cherries  Lemon juice  Powdered sugar    Peel the bananas and dice them. Dice the pineapple. Remove the pulp from  the oranges in the manner previously explained, and cut each section  into several pieces. Mix these three fruits. Cut the cherries in half  and add to the mixture. Set on ice until thoroughly chilled. To serve,  put into cocktail glasses as shown in the illustration, and add to each  glass 1 tablespoonful of maraschino juice from the cherries and 1  teaspoonful of lemon juice. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve.           *       *       *       *       *    DRIED FRUITS    VARIETIES OF DRIED FRUITS    119. The fruits that have been discussed up to this point are fresh  fruits; that is, they are placed on the markets, and consequently can be  obtained, in their fresh state. However, there are a number of fruits  that are dried before they are put on the market, and as they can be  obtained during all seasons they may be used when fresh fruits are out  of season or as a substitute for canned fruits when the household supply  is low. The chief varieties of dried fruits are dates, figs, prunes,  which are dried plums, and raisins, which are dried grapes. Apples,  apricots, and peaches are also dried in large quantities and are much  used in place of these fruits when they cannot be obtained in their  fresh form. Discussions of the different varieties of dried fruits are  here given, together with recipes showing how some of them may be used.      DATES    120. DATES, which are the fruit of the date palm, are not only very  nutritious but well liked by most persons. They are oblong in shape and  have a single hard seed that is grooved on one side. As dates contain  very little water and a great deal of sugar, their food value is high,  being more than five times that of apples and oranges. They are also  valuable in the diet because of their slightly laxative effect. When  added to other food, such as cakes, hot breads, etc., they provide a  great deal of nutriment.    121. The finest dates on the market come from Turkey and the Eastern  countries. They are prepared for sale at the places where they grow,  being put up in packages that weigh from 1/2 to 1 pound, as well as in  large boxes from which they can be sold in bulk. It is very important  that all dates, whether bought in packages or in bulk, be thoroughly  washed before they are eaten. While those contained in packages do not  collect dirt after they are packed, they are contaminated to a certain  extent by the hands of the persons who pack them. To be most  satisfactory, dates should first be washed in hot water and then have  cold water run over them. If they are to be stuffed, they should be  thoroughly dried between towels or placed in a single layer on pans to  allow the water to evaporate. While the washing of dates undoubtedly  causes the loss of a small amount of food material, it is, nevertheless,  a wise procedure.    122. Dates can be put to many valuable uses in the diet. They are much  used in cakes, muffins, and hot breads and in fillings for cakes and  cookies. Several kinds of delicious pastry, as well as salads and  sandwiches, are also made with dates. Their use as a confection is  probably the most important one, as they are very appetizing when  stuffed with nuts, candy, and such foods.      FIGS    123. FIGS are a small pear-shaped fruit grown extensively in Eastern  countries and to some extent in the western part of the United States.  The varieties grown in this country are not especially valuable when  they are dried, but they can be canned fresh in the localities where  they are grown. Fresh figs cannot be shipped, as they are too  perishable, but when dried they can be kept an indefinite length of time  and they are highly nutritious, too. In fact, dried figs are nearly as  high in food value as dates, and they are even more laxative.    124. Dried figs are found on the market both as pressed and pulled figs.  _Pressed figs_ are those which are pressed tightly together when they  are packed and are so crushed down in at least one place that they are  more or less sugary from the juice of the fig. _Pulled figs_ are those  which are dried without being pressed and are suitable for such purposes  as stewing and steaming.    125. STEWED FIGS.--If pulled figs can be secured, they may be stewed to  be served as a sauce. When prepared in this way, they will be found to  make a highly nutritious and delightful breakfast fruit or  winter dessert.    STEWED FIGS  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    2 c. pulled figs  3 c. water    Wash the figs and remove the stems. Put them into a preserving kettle  with the water and allow them to come slowly to the boiling point.  Simmer gently over the fire until the figs become soft. If they are  desired very sweet, sugar may be added before they are removed from the  heat and the juice then cooked until it is as thick as is desirable.  Serve cold.    126. STEAMED FIGS.--When figs are steamed until they are soft and then  served with plain or whipped cream, they make a delightful dessert. To  prepare them in this way, wash the desired number and remove the stems.  Place them in a steamer over boiling water and steam them until they are  soft. Remove from the stove, allow them to cool, and serve with cream.      PRUNES    127. PRUNES are the dried fruit of any one of several varieties of plum  trees and are raised mostly in Southern Europe and California. In their  fresh state, they are purple in color, but they become darker during  their drying. They are priced and purchased according to size, being  graded with a certain number to the pound, just as lemons and oranges  are graded with a certain number to the case. In food value they are  about equal to dates and figs. They contain very little acid, but are  characterized by a large quantity of easily digested sugar. They also  have a laxative quality that makes them valuable in the diet.    128. STEWED PRUNES.--A simple way in which to prepare prunes is to stew  them and then add sugar to sweeten them. Stewed prunes may be served as  a sauce with cake of some kind or they may be used as a breakfast fruit.    STEWED PRUNES  (Sufficient to Serve Six)    1 lb. prunes  1 c. sugar    Look the prunes over carefully, wash them thoroughly in hot water, and  soak them in warm water for about 6 hours. Place them on the stove in  the same water in which they were soaked and which should well cover  them. Cook slowly until they can be easily pierced with a fork or until  the seeds separate from the pulp upon being crushed. Add the sugar,  continue to cook until it is completely dissolved, and then remove from  the stove and cool. If desired, more sweetening may be used or a few  slices of lemon or a small amount of lemon peel may be added to give an  agreeable flavor.    129.

This day we had  completed the repair of the wheels of half the drays. Many of the tire-  rings had been cut, rewelded, and again fixed and bolted on the wheels;  the wood of these having contracted so much in the intense heat, as to  have rendered these repairs indispensable. The same repairs were required  by the wheels of the remaining drays and those of the light carts, and  the smith and wheelwright continued their work with activity and zeal.  Meanwhile the cattle were daily regaining strength and vigour for another  effort. Thermometer at sunrise, 61 deg.; at noon, 89 deg.; at 4 P.M., 89 deg.; at 9,  72 deg.;--with wet bulb, 62 deg..    5TH FEBRUARY.--This morning the mercurial column stood higher than I had  yet observed it here, and clouds of cirrus lay in long streaks across the  sky, ranging from east to west, but these were most abundant towards the  northern horizon. The day was comparatively cool and pleasant, the  thermometer never having risen above 96 deg.. By 6 P.M., the barometer had  fallen nearly four millimetres, and even upon this apparently trivial  circumstance, I could build some hope of rain; such was my anxiety for a  change of weather at that time, when the earth was so parched as not only  to preclude our travelling, but almost to deprive us of sight.  Thermometer at sunrise, 60 deg.; at noon, 94 deg.; at 4 P.M., 96 deg.; at 9, 73 deg.;  with wet bulb, 64 deg..    6TH FEBRUARY.--Dark stratus-shaped clouds wholly covered the sky, and  shut out the sun, to my unspeakable delight. A most decided change seemed  to have taken place; still the barometer remained as low as on the  previous evening. A slight breeze from south-east changed to north, and  at about 7 A.M. the rain began to fall. Clouds of nimbus closed on the  woody horizon, and we had a day of rain. In the evening the barometer had  fallen still lower, and it was probable that the rain might continue  through the night. Range of thermometer from 74 deg. to 72 deg..    7TH FEBRUARY.--Some heavy showers fell during the night, and the  mercurial column stood exactly at the same point as on the last evening.  About 10 A.M. a very heavy shower fell, after which the sun broke  through, and the mass of vapour separated into vast clouds of nimbus.  Much rain seemed to be still falling in the east, where the Macquarie,  Bogan, and other rivers had their sources. At noon, the barometer had  risen one millimetre. The rain had penetrated the clay soil of the plains  about five inches.    Mr. Kennedy returned in the afternoon, having duly provided for Piper's  conveyance by the mounted police to Bathurst, and brought back a good  bull-dog, and also some useful information respecting the various water-  courses, and the river Macquarie, which he had gathered from the natives  about the stations along the banks of that river. Thermometer at sunrise,  74 deg.; at noon, 86 deg.; at 4 P.M., 90 deg.; at 9, 80 deg.;--with wet bulb, 75 deg..    8TH FEBRUARY.--The moisture recently imbibed by the earth and air made us  much more sensible of the high temperature in which we had been living,  although it had been reduced by the late rains. The night air,  especially, breathed no refreshing coolness as heretofore during the dry  heat. The drier earth below seemed to be steaming the wet soil above it  (as Brown, our cook, justly observed). Thermometer at sunrise, 80 deg.; at  noon, 96 deg.; at 4 P.M., 95 deg.; at 9, 80 deg.;--with wet bulb, 75 deg..    9TH FEBRUARY.--The leisure we enjoyed at this camp, enabled us to bestow  more attention on the vegetable and animal productions of these  remarkable plains, than had been given during my former journey. It  appeared that the saltwort plants, which were numerous, were not only  efficacious in keeping the cattle that fed on them in the best possible  condition; but as wholly preventing cattle and sheep from licking clay, a  vicious habit to which they are so prone, that grassy runs in the higher  country nearer Sydney are sometimes abandoned only on account of the  \"licking holes\" they contain. It is chiefly to take off that taste for  licking the saline clay, that rock-salt is in such request for sheep,  lumps of it being laid in their pens for this purpose. At all events, it  is certain that by this licking of clay both sheep and cattle are much  injured in health and condition, losing their appetite for grass, and  finally passing clay only, as may be seen near such places. In the salt  plants on these plains, nature has amply provided for this taste of these  large herbivora for salt. Our sheep nibbled at the mesembryanthemum, and  the cattle ate greedily of various bushes whereof the leaf was sensibly  salt to the taste. The colour of the leaves of such bushes is usually a  very light bluish green, and there are many species. That with the  largest leaves, called salt-bush by stockmen, and by Dr. Brown RHAGODIA  PARABOLICA, was very useful as a vegetable after extracting the salt  sufficiently from it. This we accidentally discovered from some  experiments made by Mr. Stephenson, for the purpose of ascertaining the  proportion of salt contained in the leaves. The leaves contained as much  as a twentieth part of salt, nearly two ounces having been obtained from  two pounds of the leaves.[*] We also found that after twice boiling the  leaves a few minutes in water to extract the salt, and then an hour in a  third water, the leaves formed a tender and palatable vegetable, somewhat  resembling spinach. As the superior excellence of these runs for  fattening cattle is admitted on all hands, as compared with others more  abundant in grass on the eastern side of the great range, would it not be  advisable for the colonists to cultivate this salt-supplying bush, and  thereby to produce a vegetable substitute for the rock salt, which is not  only expensive, but only a very imperfect remedy for the clay-licking  propensities of sheep and cattle on many runs? Thermometer at sunrise,  70 deg.; at noon, 94 deg.; at 4 P.M., 98 deg.; at 9, 86 deg.;--with wet bulb, 75 deg..    [* The process of Mr. Stephenson was as follows:--\"Two pounds of the  green leaf were boiled in eight quarts of water for half an hour, then  strained and evaporated nearly to dryness. The mass was then submitted to  a red heat for half an hour. The residuum was next digested in one pint  of water, filtered, and again evaporated to six ounces. It was then  exposed to the sun's rays, which completed the desiccation; crystals of a  cubic shape having previously been formed.\"]    10TH FEBRUARY.--This morning the natives caught, in a hollow tree, an  animal apparently of the same genus as the DIPUS MITCHELLII, and which  seemed to live solely on vegetables. The barometer had fallen three  millimetres last evening, and by noon this day it had declined three  more. A fresh breeze blew from N. N. E., and at 2 P.M. a dark thunder  cloud came from the S. S. W. and passed over the camp. The thunder was  very loud, the lightning close and vivid; the wind for some time high,  and rain heavy. The sky was, however, clear by 4 P.M., except in the N.  E. where the thunder continued. Thermometer at sunrise, 75 deg..    11TH FEBRUARY.--The real \"Duck Creek\" was still to the northeastward of  our camp, as Mr. Kennedy had ascertained when on the Macquarie. I hoped  to find in it water sufficient at least to serve the party halting on it  one night, on its way to the Macquarie, by which line alone I was now  convinced water enough might be obtained to supply the party until it  could arrive at the Darling; I therefore rode this day to examine it,  with the elder native. I followed the bearing of N. N. E. from our camp,  a direction in which it was likely to be met with, so as equally to  divide the journey of the drays to the Macquarie, into two days. I  crossed plains covered with luxuriant crops of very rich grass, and at  length obtained a sight of Mount Foster bearing east. I reached Duck  Creek (that of Sturt), or the \"Marra\" of the natives, ascertained by the  bearing of Mount Foster, the native name of which is Narrab. I examined  the bed of the Marra downwards for about two miles, without seeing  therein the least indication of water, and returned to the camp fully  resolved to proceed next day to the Macquarie, so as to reach it a little  way below Mount Foster, a distance in that direction rather too great for  the cattle to travel over in one day. Thermometer at sunrise, 59 deg.; at  noon, 73 deg.; at 4 P.M., 76 deg.; at 9, 61 deg.;--with wet bulb, 57 deg.. From an  average of twenty-five observations of the mercurial column, the height  of this station has been determined to be 566 English feet above the  level of the sea.    12TH FEBRUARY.--We broke up our encampment on Cannonba ponds, where we  had greatly recruited ourselves, both men and cattle, and crossing the  channel of the water-course near our camping ground, we travelled over  open grassy plains towards the river Macquarie. At thirteen miles we  reached the western branch of Duck Creek, or \"Marra,\" a name by which it  is universally known to natives and stockmen. Of this we crossed several  branches, from which it would appear as if the name was derived from that  of the hand, which is the same, especially as natives sometimes hold up  the hand and extend the fingers, when they would express that a river has  various branches or sources. I went on with an advanced party towards the  Macquarie, and encamped on the bank of that river at 5 P. M. The thick  grass, low forests of yarra trees, and finally the majestic blue gum  trees along the river margin, reminded me of the northern rivers seen  during my journey of 1831. Still even the bed of this was dry, and I  found only two water holes on examining the channel for two miles. One of  these was, however, deep, and we encamped near it, surrounded by  excellent grass in great"]]]
