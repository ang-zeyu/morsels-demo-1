Volume 1: Essentials of Cookery; Cereals; (#11)"],[1,"extent on the selection of materials and the proper cooking  methods, as well as on an understanding of the stove and fuel employed,  the importance of the utensils that are to be used must not be  overlooked. As is well known, each cooking utensil is fitted to its  particular use; in fact, the wrong kind of pan, dish, or other utensil  will not bring about the same result as the right one. This does not  mean, however, that the housewife must possess a large supply of every  kind of utensil, for, really, the expert cook is known by the small  number of utensils she uses. Of course, the proper handling of utensils,  as well as the right selection of them, will come with experience, but  before she starts to cook the beginner should endeavor to plan  definitely what must be provided. She should likewise remember that the  use of an unnecessary number of utensils not only will increase the  labor involved in preparing a dish, but will affect considerably the  amount of work required to clear them away and wash them after the  cooking is done.    2. The materials of which cooking utensils are made, as well as their  shape and size, have also a great bearing on the success with which  cooking may be done. As no one material is suitable for all utensils,  they are made of various materials, such as wood, tin, glass, enamel,  aluminum, sheet iron, and earthenware. In the purchase of a utensil,  therefore, it is well to have in mind the use to which the utensil will  be put, and then to select one that is made of durable material, that  can be easily cleaned, and that will not affect the food that is cooked  in it. Likewise, the shape of the utensil should receive consideration,  for much depends on it. To be satisfactory, a utensil should be without  seams or curved edges, because it is difficult to remove particles of  food that collect in such places. A vessel that is hard to wash should  be avoided, and one that will tip easily is not desirable, either.    The size of utensils must be determined by the number of persons for  whom food is to be cooked, for the amount of food to be prepared  indicates whether a large or a small utensil should be selected. On the  other hand, the length of time required for foods to cook depends to a  large extent on the size and shape of the utensil. When food is to be  cooked a long time, a deep vessel with a comparatively small surface  exposed for evaporation should be chosen; but for quick cooking, use  should be made of a shallow utensil that will allow a great deal of  surface to be exposed, as the evaporation will be accomplished  more rapidly.    In furnishing a kitchen, it is well to begin with a few essential  utensils of the best quality that can be obtained, and then, as needed,  to add other well-selected utensils to the equipment.      MATERIALS USED FOR UTENSILS    3. ALUMINUM.--Because of the properties of aluminum, this metal is used  extensively for cooking utensils. It is more costly than most of the  materials employed for this purpose, but while the first cost of  aluminum pans and kettles may seem large, the extra expense is justified  by the durability of the utensils. They last much longer than utensils  made of many other materials, for when aluminum is hammered and rolled  it becomes extremely hard. Some aluminum utensils are very thin, and  since they melt and dent very easily they are suitable for only light,  careful handling. Although heavier aluminum utensils are more expensive  than the lighter ones on account of the metal required and the  manufacturing process involved, they are harder and more durable. Cast  aluminum is used for large vessels, such as those required in  institutions where large quantities of food are cooked and where pots  and kettles are subjected to extremely hard wear, but this is the most  expensive kind, for in order to make the aluminum hard enough for  casting some harder metal must be mixed with it. One of the  disadvantages of aluminum is that it is not always easy to clean, but  this is overbalanced by the fact that foods do not burn so readily in  aluminum utensils as in other kinds, since the heat is evenly  distributed by this metal.    4. ENAMEL.--Good enamel cooking utensils are desirable for some purposes  and are only moderately expensive. Utensils made of enamel are not so  durable as those made of metal, because excessive heat or a sharp blow  will cause the enamel to chip. Enamel utensils come in various colors,  and all can be kept clean easily, but the gray enamel is considered to  be the best for wear.    5. IRON AND STEEL.--Utensils made of iron and steel are usually  inexpensive, but some, especially those of iron, are heavy. These metals  are used principally for such utensils as frying pans, or skillets,  griddles, waffle irons, and kettles for deep-fat frying. Sheet iron  makes excellent shallow pans for baking cookies and other cakes, very  satisfactory bread pans, and the best kind of pans for omelet and  other frying.    6. EARTHENWARE.--A certain number of fairly durable earthenware utensils  are necessary in a kitchen equipment. Mixing bowls are usually made of  earthenware, as are also casseroles, which are covered dishes used for  the baking of foods that require long cooking, and other baking  utensils. Meat, fowl, and some vegetables, such as dried beans, are  delicious when prepared in a casserole, as very little flavor or food is  lost in such a dish.    7. TIN.--The cheapest metal from which cooking utensils are made is tin,  but it is not generally used for utensils in which food is to be cooked,  because it melts at too low a temperature. Tin is used, however, for  such small articles as measures, cutters, apple corers, sieves,  strainers, and other things of this kind, and it is especially  desirable for them.    8. COPPER.--Before iron was known copper was the principal material for  cooking utensils. The chief point in favor of copper is its durability,  but utensils made of it are not practical for use in the ordinary  kitchen because they are expensive, heavy, and very difficult to  keep clean.    9. GLASS.--Utensils made of heavy glassware are much used for cooking.  Glass utensils are especially desirable for custards and other dishes  that the cook likes to watch while cooking or that are to be served in  the baking dish. Glass cooking utensils possess the advantage of  retaining the heat well.    10. WOOD.--Certain utensils made of wood are required in a cooking  outfit, a molding board of hardwood and a smaller wooden cutting board  being particularly necessary in every kitchen. Bowls in which to chop  foods, rolling pins, and mixing spoons are usually made of hardwood, and  when such wood is used for them they are entirely satisfactory.      LABOR-SAVING DEVICES    11. A LABOR-SAVING DEVICE is any apparatus that will permit a certain  piece of work to be accomplished with less exertion than would be  necessary to do the same thing without it. A sink and a dustpan are  labor-saving devices just as truly as are a bread mixer and a vacuum  cleaner, but because a sink and a dustpan are necessities as well, they  are not usually thought of as true labor-saving devices. The newer  appliances for saving labor are often considered to be quite  unnecessary, and indeed some of them are. It is only when such apparatus  will, with less labor involved and less time consumed in the process,  secure results as good as or better than will another device, and when  the cleaning and care of it do not consume so much time and labor as is  saved by using it, that it may be considered a true labor-saving device.  Each housewife must decide for herself whether the expense of a  so-called labor-saving device is greater than the value of the time and  strength she would use without such a device.    [Illustration: Fig. 1 (_a_) (_b_)]    [Illustration: Fig. 2]    [Illustration: Fig. 3]    12. COMMON LABOR-SAVING DEVICES. Every housewife does not have occasion  to use all the devices that have been invented to save labor, but a  number of these are in such common use, produce such good results, and  save so much time and effort that they should be found in every kitchen.  Among them is the _rotary egg beater_ shown in Fig. 1 (_a_). This is so  made that one revolution of the wheel to which the crank is attached  does about five times as much work as can be done with a fork or with an  _egg whip_, which is shown in (_b_). Another inexpensive device that is  a real help is the _potato ricer_. This device, one style of which is  shown in Fig. 2, is really a press through which any fruit or vegetable  can be put to make a puree. It is used considerably for mashing  potatoes, as it makes them perfectly smooth and saves considerable time  and labor. Still another useful device is the _meat chopper_, or  _grinder_, which is shown in Fig. 3. Such a device clamped to the edge  of a table takes the place of a chopping bowl and knife, and in addition  to being more sanitary it permits the work to be done in a shorter time  and with less effort. Besides the devices mentioned, there are many  small labor-saving devices, such as the _apple corer_, the _berry  huller_, the _mayonnaise mixer_, etc., the merits of which every busy  housewife will do well to consider.    [Illustration: Fig. 4]    13. BREAD AND CAKE MIXERS. Where baking is done for only a small number  of persons, bread and cake mixers are not indispensable, but they save  much labor where baking is done on a large scale. It is comparatively  easy, for instance, to knead dough for three or four loaves of bread,  but the process becomes rather difficult when enough dough for eight to  sixteen loaves must be handled. For large quantities of bread and cake,  mixers, when properly used, are labor-saving. In addition, such devices  are sanitary, and for this reason they are used in many homes where the  bakings are comparatively small.    14.

If desired, spread with salad dressing, or merely  season the onion with salt and pepper. Place the second slice of bread  on top, trim the edges, and serve.      FRUIT SANDWICHES    118. Sandwiches that have fruit for their filling appeal to many  persons. For the most part, dried fruits are used for this purpose and  they usually require cooking. Another type of fruit sandwich is that  which has jelly or marmalade for its filling. As fruit sandwiches are  sweet and not very hearty, they are much served for afternoon tea or to  provide variety when another kind of sandwich is being served.    119. DATE SANDWICHES.--To any one who desires a sweet sandwich, the date  sandwich in the accompanying recipe will be found to be very agreeable.  Not all sandwich fillings seem to be satisfactory with other bread than  white, but the filling here given can be utilized with white, graham, or  whole-wheat bread.    DATE FILLING    3/4 c. dates  1/4 c. nut meats  1/2 lemon    Wash the dates and remove the seeds. Steam them over hot water or in a  double boiler until they are soft, and then mash them thoroughly.  Squeeze the juice from the lemon, grate the yellow part of the rind and  mix with the juice, and add both to the steamed dates. Then add the nut  meats chopped very fine.    To make the sandwiches, cut thin slices of bread and spread one slice  with butter and the corresponding slice with the date filling. Place the  two together, trim the crusts if desired, and serve.    120. FRUIT SANDWICHES.--The three fruits mentioned in the accompanying  recipe may be used in equal proportions as here given, only two of them  may be utilized, or the proportions may be changed to suit the supply  on hand. This sandwich may be made with white bread, brown bread, graham  bread, or whole-wheat bread.    FRUIT FILLING    1/2 c. dates  1/2 c. raisins  1/2 c. figs  1 orange    Wash the dates, figs, and raisins, and remove the stones from the dates.  Steam all together until they are soft, mash thoroughly, and add the  juice and the grated rind of the orange.    Cut thin slices of bread, spread one slice with butter, and spread the  opposite slice with this filling. Place the two together, trim the edges  if desired, and serve.    121. APRICOT SANDWICHES.--To people who are fond of apricots, sandwiches  containing apricot filling are very delicious. If jelly or marmalade is  plentiful, it may be used in place of the apricots to make the sandwich.    APRICOT FILLING    1/2 c. dried apricots  1/4 tsp. cinnamon  1/2 c. sugar  1 Tb. lemon juice    Wash and soak the apricots, and when they are thoroughly softened cook  them until tender in just enough water to keep them from burning. Put  them through a sieve or a colander and add the sugar, cinnamon, and  lemon juice to the pulp. Place over the fire and cook until the mixture  becomes thick, stirring constantly to keep it from scorching. Set  aside to cool.    Cut bread into thin slices, butter one slice, and spread the other of  each pair of slices with the apricot filling. Put each two slices  together and trim the edges if desired. Serve.    122. JELLY AND MARMALADE SANDWICHES.--Jelly and marmalade always make  acceptable filling for sandwiches, and as these foods are usually in  supply sandwiches containing them require less trouble to prepare than  do most sandwiches. Then, too, if two kinds of sandwiches are to be  served for a tea or a little lunch, sandwiches of this kind are very  nice for the second one. They are made in the usual way, but if the  jelly or marmalade is very thin, it is an excellent plan to spread each  slice of bread used for the sandwich thinly with butter so that the  filling will not soak into the bread.    Slices of Boston brown bread steamed in small round cans, such as  baking-powder cans, and a filling of jelly or marmalade make dainty  little sandwiches for afternoon tea.      HIGH-PROTEIN SANDWICHES    123. When sandwiches of a substantial nature are desired, those in which  high-protein foods are used as fillings will be found very acceptable.  Here considerable variety may be had, for there are a number of these  foods that make excellent fillings. Some sandwiches of this kind are  suitable for serving with salads while others, such as those containing  meat or chicken, are very satisfactory for picnics or light lunches.    124. JELLY-AND-CREAM-CHEESE SANDWICHES.--A sandwich that is very dainty  as well as unusually good is made by using both jelly and cream cheese  for filling. Sandwiches of this kind are shown on the plate to the right  in Fig. 25. If a red jelly, such as currant jelly, is used, the  appearance of the sandwich will be better than if a light jelly or a  very dark jelly is used.    Cut the bread very thin and match three slices for the sandwich instead  of two. Spread the first piece thinly with butter and spread the  opposite side of the second piece with jelly. Place this on the buttered  bread and spread the other side with cream cheese. Spread another piece  with butter and place this on top of the cream cheese. Trim the edges if  desired, and cut into narrow strips. Serve.    125. RYE-BREAD-AND-CHEESE SANDWICHES.--Rye bread and cheese make a  favored combination with many persons. Swiss cheese is an excellent kind  to serve with rye bread, but the American-made Cheddar cheese does very  nicely if the other cannot be procured.    Cut rye bread into slices about 1/4 inch thick. Spread them very thinly  with butter, and between each two slices place a thin slice of the  cheese. Serve mustard with sandwiches of this kind for any one who may  desire it.    126. CHEESE SANDWICHES.--Cheese combined with pimiento, sweet pickles,  olives, and nuts makes a filling that has an excellent flavor.  Sandwiches containing this filling will be found to be very good for  picnics or lunches. Their food value, which, of course, is high, depends  somewhat on the amount of filling used.    CHEESE FILLING    1/4 lb. cheese  1/4 c. English walnut meats  1 pimiento  1/2 doz. olives, cut from stones  2 sweet pickles    Put the cheese through a grinder unless it is soft enough to mash. Chop  the pimiento, pickles, nuts, and olives quite fine and add the cheese.  Work together with a spoon. Cut bread into thin slices, spread one piece  with butter, the other one with the cheese filling, place the two  together, trim if desired, and serve.    127. CHEESE-AND-NUT SANDWICHES.--Cream cheese is used in the  accompanying recipe, but other cheese may be substituted for it if  desired. Sandwiches containing this filling are high in both protein and  fat, and may be served very nicely with a vegetable salad.    CHEESE-AND-NUT FILLING    1 pkg. cream cheese  1/3 c. English walnut meats  4 Tb. salad dressing    Mash the cheese with a spoon and add the salad dressing. Just before  making the sandwiches, add the nut meats, which have been chopped very  fine. If this mixture is put together and allowed to stand for any  length of time before serving, the filling will grow dark.    Cut bread thinly, butter one slice, place filling on the opposite slice,  put together, trim if desired, and serve.    128. PEANUT-BUTTER SANDWICHES.--Peanut butter alone makes a rather dry  sandwich, as it has a peculiar consistency that makes it difficult to  swallow without moistening. This condition can be overcome by adding a  little salad dressing to the peanut butter.    Place a few tablespoonfuls of peanut butter in a bowl and pour a  sufficient amount of salad dressing into it to moisten it enough to  spread. Season with salt. Cut slices of bread thin, spread one piece  with butter, the opposite piece with peanut butter, place together, trim  if desired, and serve.    129. HARD-COOKED-EGG SANDWICHES.--An excellent sandwich filling can be  made by seasoning hard-cooked eggs and combining them with vinegar. To  make this filling, cook the desired number of eggs until they are hard.  Remove them from the shells and put them through a sieve. Season well  with salt and pepper and then add sufficient vinegar to make them of a  good consistency to spread. Cut bread thin, spread one piece with  butter, and the opposite piece with the egg mixture. Put them together,  trim the edges if desired, and serve.    130. MEAT SANDWICHES.--Cold cooked meat may be used in sandwiches in  the usual way by putting thin slices between buttered bread, or it may  be put through the grinder or chopped finely and then mixed with salad  dressing until thin enough to spread. With the meat may also be chopped  pickles, olives, a small amount of onion, green pepper, pimiento, or  anything desired for flavoring. Left-over roast meat that will not slice  very well and trimmings from ham may be utilized in this way.    When a filling of chopped meat is to be used, slice bread thin, spread  one slice with butter and the opposite slice with the meat filling. Put  together, trim if desired, and serve.    131. CHICKEN SANDWICHES.--Cold chicken sliced thinly, put between pieces  of crisp toast, and spread with salad dressing, makes a sandwich that is  most delicious and offers a pleasant change from the usual plain-bread  sandwich. Cut bread 1/4 inch thick and toast it a delicate brown on both  sides. Spread thinly with butter when it comes from the toaster. Between  each two pieces place thin slices of chicken. Spread the chicken with a  small amount of salad dressing, place a lettuce leaf on top of this, and  cover with a second piece of toast. Serve.    132. CHICKEN-SALAD SANDWICHES.--When there is on hand only a small  amount of chicken that is perhaps not in the right condition for  slicing, it is a good plan to make a salad of it and use this for  sandwich filling. If necessary, a little veal or pork may be used with  the chicken.    CHICKEN-SALAD FILLING    1 c. cold meat  1 hard-cooked egg  1/2 c. chopped celery  Salad dressing  1 small onion    Chop all the ingredients very fine, mix together, and"]]]
