This committee advised  that two observers should be sent to Hudson's Bay, two to the South  Pacific and, if Sweden did not send there, two to the North Cape. They  also advised that the Government should be asked to supply a ship to  convey the party to some island to be decided on in the South Seas, and  several gentlemen were suggested as observers, Mr. Maskelyne, President  of the Society, especially recommending Mr. Dalrymple as \"a proper person  to send to the South Seas, having a particular turn for discoveries, and  being an able navigator and well skilled in observation.\" Mr. Maskelyne  estimated the voyage would take about two years, and that a sum of ten  shillings and six pence per day would be a reasonable allowance for  expenses, together with a gratuity the amount of which was to be settled  hereafter. A Memorial on the subject was prepared and forwarded to the  King, setting forth that as a Transit of Venus over the Sun's disc was  expected to occur, and that other nations were intending to take  observations thereof in the interests of navigation, it would be  desirable that as the British Nation had been justly celebrated for its  knowledge of Astronomy, and an Englishman, Mr. Jeremiah Horrox, had been  the first person who calculated the passage of the planet over the sun,  in 1639, the Government should support the Royal Society in its attempt  to take a proper position in the matter, by a grant of money and a ship  to take a party to the South Seas. Four thousand pounds was the sum  named, and on 24th March the President was able to inform the Council  that the King had been pleased to order that it should be placed in his  hands, \"clear of fees,\" for the purpose of defraying the expenses of the  expedition. In the end, after paying all accounts, there was a  considerable balance left, which the King placed at the disposal of the  Society, and a portion of it was expended on the bust of His Majesty, by  Nollekins, now in its possession.    The gentlemen whose names had been suggested as observers were asked to  appear before the Council if they were willing to accept the position,  and Mr. Dalrymple wrote in reply to say there was only one part of the  world where he would go to take observations, that was the South Seas,  and he would only go if he had \"the management of the ship intended for  the service.\" Mr. Maskelyne told the Council he had recommended Mr.  Dalrymple to the Admiralty for the command of the ship, the use of which  had been granted, but had been informed that such an appointment would be  \"entirely repugnant to the regulations of the Navy.\" It is said that Sir  Edward Hawke, having in his mind the disastrous result of giving Halley  the command of a King's ship in 1698, when a serious mutiny occurred,  positively refused to sign such a commission, saying that he would  \"rather cut off his right hand than permit any one but a King's officer  to command one of the ships of His Majesty's Navy.\"    Dalrymple, originally a clerk in the East India Company's service, had  spent some years trading amongst the islands of the Malay Archipelago and  China, returned to England and published a couple of pamphlets on the  East Indies, and in 1767 a book on the discoveries in the South Pacific  Ocean, which brought him to the notice of the Royal Society. He was  afterwards for a time hydrographer to the East India Company, and was  then appointed the first hydrographer to the Admiralty. He was dismissed  from this position for exceeding his powers, and soon afterwards died. He  appears to have been a clever man, but of an extremely overbearing  disposition and a very high opinion of himself. In writing to Dr.  Hawkesworth on one occasion, he said: \"I never write on any subject I do  not thoroughly understand.\" What makes the remark more interesting is  that he was quite in the wrong on the subject under discussion. He  appears never to have forgiven Cook for having been successful in  obtaining the command of the expedition to observe the Transit of Venus,  and for completely upsetting his pet theory of a large continent in the  Southern Ocean.    PURCHASE OF THE ENDEAVOUR.    The Navy Board, having been ordered by the Admiralty to propose a proper  vessel to convey the observers to the South Seas, first suggested the  Tryal Sloop, and then the Rose, but both being found unsuitable they were  ordered to purchase one. On 29th March the Board wrote to Stephens that  they had bought:    \"a cat-built Bark, in Burthen 368 Tuns and of the age of three years and  nine months, for conveying such persons as shall be thought proper to the  Southward...\"    At the same time, instructions were sought as to fitting and arming her  for the service, and as to the name under with she was to be registered  on the list of the Navy. A cat-built ship is described in the  Encyclopaedias as one with round bluff bows, a wide deep waist, and  tapering towards the stern. The name is derived from the Norwegian kati,  a ship.    The cat-built bark, the now immortal Endeavour, was built by Messrs.  Fishburn of Whitby, and owned by Mr. William Milner of that port. Dr.  Young says that her original name was the Earl of Pembroke, but Sir Evan  Macgregor wrote to Mr. Waddington in 1888 that she was purchased \"under  the name of the Endeavour, and was entered as a barque.\" The Warrant  Entry Book from Board of Trade proves that Dr. Young was right, as the  following entries will show:    \"Deptford, March 23rd 1768. Two cats called the Valentine and the Earl of  Pembroke to be surveyed and report which is the properest to be  purchased.\"    \"Deptford, March 28th 1768. Ship Earl of Pembroke to be received.\"    \"Deptford, April 7th 1768. Ship purchased to be sheathed, filled, and  fitted for a voyage to the southward. To be called The Endeavour Bark.\"    From the Records of the Survey Office, List of H.M. Navy, 1771 to 1776,  it has been ascertained that her price was 2,800 pounds, and the cost of  fitting her for the voyage was 2,294 pounds. The reason she was named  officially either the Bark Endeavour or Endeavour Bark, was that there  was another Endeavour in the Navy, stationed at that time at the Nore.  Kippis says that Pallisser was entrusted with the selection of the ship,  and that he called on Cook for assistance in the matter, and the fact  that a Whitby-built ship was chosen, of a kind in which Cook had had  considerable experience, adds to the probability of his statement.  Dalrymple enters a claim, in letters to Dr. Hawkesworth, to having chosen  the Endeavour for the voyage, but as she was not ordered to be surveyed,  with a view to purchase, till 23rd March, when it was well-known the  Admiralty had refused to allow him the command of the expedition, there  is little force in his claim.    COPPER SHEATHING.    Admiral Wharton assumes that as Cook expresses himself averse from having  exploring ships sheathed in copper, owing to the difficulty of making  repairs in case of accident far from proper facilities, and from the  frequent mention of \"heeling and boot-topping\" in the Journal of the  Endeavour, it is most probable that she was sheathed in wood. This  assumption is correct, for there is no mention of copper sheathing in the  Surveyor's books, nor at the time of her being repaired at the Endeavour  River, nor at Batavia, when it is impossible that any account of her  damaged bottom could be given without the mention of copper if any such  sheathing had been used. The Naval Chronicle says the first ship of the  Royal Navy to be sheathed with copper was the Alarm frigate in 1758; and  it is also said that the Dolphin, the ship in which Captain Wallis sailed  round the world, was the only coppered ship in the service at this time,  and she remained the only one for some years.    On 5th May, at a Council Meeting of the Royal Society, Captain John  Campbell, R.N., proposed that Cook, who was in attendance, and had been  appointed by the Admiralty to the command of the Endeavour, was a fit and  proper person to be one of the observers for the Society in the Southern  Seas. Cook was called in, and accepted the position in consideration of  such a gratuity as the Society should think proper, and an allowance of  120 pounds per year \"for victualling himself and another observer in  every particular.\" Mr. Green was also called in, and accepted the place  as the other observer for the gratuity of 200 guineas for the two years  the voyage was expected to take, and at the rate of 100 guineas a year  afterwards. A list of the instruments to be supplied by the Society was  also prepared at the same meeting, and the workmen engaged on them were  ordered to show them to Messrs. Green and Cook, and give any desired  information. A portable observatory, said to have been designed by  Smeaton, the builder of the Eddystone Lighthouse, framed of wood and  covered with canvas, was also prepared. Mr. Maskelyne, knowing the value  of a good watch when observing for longitude, lent the Society one of his  own, made by Graham, to be entrusted to Mr. Green, and it was signed for  with the other instruments supplied. Chronometers, of course, at that  time were in process of evolution, several makers were endeavouring to  gain the prize which had been offered for a reliable timekeeper. Shortly  after, at a second meeting, Cook agreed to accept a gratuity from the  Society of 100 guineas for taking the observations, and was paid 120  pounds sustenance money for Mr. Green and himself, with authority to draw  on the Society during the voyage for a further amount not exceeding 120  pounds.    In the Commissions and Warrants Book, under date 26th May 1768, appears  the following entry:    MR. JAMES COOK (2nd) 1st Lieutenant Endeavour Bark. E.H., C.T., C.S.    The initials signify Edward Hawke, Charles Townshend, and Lord Charles  Spencer. The \"(2nd)\" evidently refers to the fact that there was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10843"],[0,"The Mental Life of Monkeys and Apes: A Study of Ideational Behavior (#12)"],[1,"to the formerly established method of choosing the first door at  the right. This relapse was characteristic of what happened during the  many days which intervened between the definite appearance of this habit  and the final solution of the problem.    Especially in connection with such relapses, Skirrl showed extreme  fatigue or ennui and often would refuse to work and simply sit before  the open doors yawning. This happened even when he was extremely hungry  and evidently eager enough for food.    From July 12 on the hunger motive was increased by feeding the monkey  only in the apparatus and by so regulating the amount of food given in  each trial that he should obtain barely enough to keep him in good  physical condition. An increase in the number of correct choices  promptly resulted, and continued until on July 14 the ratio of choices  was 1 to .54. It appeared from these data that a relatively small number  of choices, say not more than ten a day, the rewards in connection with  which supplied the only food received by the animal, yielded most  favorable results.    On July 16, the period of confinement in wrong boxes was increased to  sixty seconds, and it was so continued for a number of days. But in the  end, it became clear that the period of thirty seconds, combined with a  liberal reward in the shape of desired food and a single series of ten  trials per day, was most satisfactory. The detailed data of table 2  indicate that at this time Skirrl was making his choices by memory of  the particular setting.    Skirrl, on July 17 was evidently hungry and eager to locate food, but  seemingly unable to select the right box. In trial 5 (765th) of the  series, he was punished by confinement in box 8. When the doors were  unlocked in order that the entrance door might be raised to release him,  the lock-bar, sliding under the floor, made a slight grating noise, and  the instant the entrance door was opened, he jumped out excitedly. _He  made no outcry, but as soon as he was out of the box, sat down, and  taking up his right hind foot, examined it for a few seconds._ Having  apparently assured himself that nothing serious had happened, he went on  unconcernedly about his task. The presumption is that the sound of the  lock-bar, associated as it was with his painful experience in box 1,  revived the strongly affective experience of stepping on the nail.  Psychologically described, the sound induced an imaginal complex  equivalent to the earlier painful experience. The behavior seems to the  writer a most important bit of evidence of imagery in the monkey.  Finally, on August 9, after ten hundred and seventy trials, Skirrl  succeeded in choosing correctly in the ten trials of a series, and he  was therefore considered to have solved the problem of the second door  from the right end of the group.    On the following day, he was given a control series with the settings  which are presented on page 19 and also at the bottom of table 2. In  this series he chose correctly five times,--in other words, as often  correctly as incorrectly. An analysis of the choices indicates, however,  that two of the five correct choices were made in box 8, which, as it  happened, had proved a peculiarly easy one for him throughout the  training, since from the first he tended to avoid door 9. Consequently,  it is only fair to conclude, from the results for this control series  and for those given on August 11 and 12, that the animal chose not on  the basis of anything remotely resembling a general idea of secondness  from the right end, but instead on the basis of gradually acquired modes  of reaction to the particular settings. This conclusion is strengthened  by the fact that he had failed to learn to react appropriately and  readily to most of the settings of the regular series.    The curve which represents the course of the learning process in this  problem is presented in figure 19. For this and all other curves which  involve more than a single series of observations a day, the method of  construction was as follows: The first series for each day of training  is indicated on the curve by a dot, while the second or third series on  a given day, although space is allowed for them, are not so indicated.  Consequently, the form of the curve is determined chiefly by the first  series per day. The extreme irregularities of this curve are most  interesting and puzzling, as are also the variations in the daily ratios  of right to wrong first choices. Three times in the course of the  training, this ratio rose to 1 to 9, or higher. The causes for such  extreme variations are not easily enumerated, but a few of the most  obvious contributory causes are variations in the weather, especially  cloudiness or fogginess, which rendered the apparatus dark; variations  in the degree of hunger or eagerness for food; differences in the  activities of the animals in the cages outside of the laboratory  (sometimes they were noisy and distracted the subject), and finally,  differences in the physical fitness and attitude of the animal from day  to day.    The more or less incidental behavior in connection with this experiment  more strongly than the statistical results of the work on problem 2  indicate the existence of imagery. That ideas played a part in the  solution of the problem is probable, but at best they functioned very  ineffectively. The small number of methods used in the selection of the  right box, and the slight variations from the chief method, that of  choosing the first box at the right end and then the one next to it,  apparently justify Doctor Hamilton's characterization of this monkey as  defective.      [Illustration: FIGURE 19.--Error curves of learning for the solution of  problem 2 (second box from right end).]      _Problem 3. Alternately First at Left and First at Right_    Following the control series given in connection with problem 1, an  interval of rest lasting from August 12 to August 19 was allowed in  order that Skirrl might in part at least lose the effects of his  training and regain his customary interest in the apparatus by being  allowed to obtain food easily instead of by dint of hard labor,--labor  which was harder by far, apparently, than physical activity because it  demanded of the animal certain mental processes which were either  lacking or but imperfectly functional. The difficultness of the daily  tasks appears to be reliably indicated by the tendency to yawn.    Systematic work on problem 3, which has been defined as alternately the  first door at the left and the first door at the right of the group, was  begun August 19, and for nine days a single series of ten trials per day  was given. Work then had to cease because of the experimenter's return  to Cambridge.    The results of the work on this problem demand but brief analysis and  comment. The expected ratio of one right to four wrong choices per  series appears (see table 3) for the first series of trials, and _this  in spite of the fact that Skirrl had been trained for several weeks to  choose the second door from the right end_. One would ordinarily have  predicted a much larger number of incorrect choices. The right choices  were due to the monkey's strong tendency to go first to the first door  at the right and thence to the one next to it. Indeed in the series  given on August 24; this method was followed without variation. In other  words, in every one of the ten trials Skirrl entered first the box at  the extreme right end of the group. This necessarily resulted in as many  right as wrong first choices. Consequently, the ratio reads 1 to 1. But  the method was not adhered to, and at no time either before or after  that date did he succeed in equalling this achievement. There was, as a  matter of fact, no steady improvement, and so far as one may judge from  the records which were obtained, the course of events in the solution of  this problem would have been similar to those in problem 2.
