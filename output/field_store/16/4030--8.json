But when they saw him they gathered round and marvelled. And  he at last drew laboured breath from the depths of his chest and spoke  among them with prophetic utterance:    (ll. 209-239) \"Listen, bravest of all the Hellenes, if it be truly ye,  whom by a king's ruthless command Jason is leading on the ship Argo in  quest of the fleece. It is ye truly. Even yet my soul by its divination  knows everything. Thanks I render to thee, O king, son of Leto, plunged  in bitter affliction though I be. I beseech you by Zeus the god of  suppliants, the sternest foe to sinful men, and for the sake of Phoebus  and Hera herself, under whose especial care ye have come hither, help  me, save an ill-fated man from misery, and depart not uncaring and  leaving me thus as ye see. For not only has the Fury set her foot on my  eyes and I drag on to the end a weary old age; but besides my other woes  a woe hangs over me the bitterest of all. The Harpies, swooping down  from some unseen den of destruction, ever snatch the food from my mouth.  And I have no device to aid me. But it were easier, when I long for  a meal, to escape my own thoughts than them, so swiftly do they fly  through the air. But if haply they do leave me a morsel of food it reeks  of decay and the stench is unendurable, nor could any mortal bear  to draw near even for a moment, no, not if his heart were wrought of  adamant. But necessity, bitter and insatiate, compels me to abide  and abiding to put food in my cursed belly. These pests, the oracle  declares, the sons of Boreas shall restrain. And no strangers are they  that shall ward them off if indeed I am Phineus who was once renowned  among men for wealth and the gift of prophecy, and if I am the son of my  father Agenor; and, when I ruled among the Thracians, by my bridal gifts  I brought home their sister Cleopatra to be my wife.\"    (ll. 240-243) So spake Agenor's son; and deep sorrow seized each of the  heroes, and especially the two sons of Boreas. And brushing away a tear  they drew nigh, and Zetes spake as follows, taking in his own the hand  of the grief-worn sire:    (ll. 244-253) \"Unhappy one, none other of men is more wretched than  thou, methinks. Why upon thee is laid the burden of so many sorrows?  Hast thou with baneful folly sinned against the gods through thy skill  in prophecy? For this are they greatly wroth with thee? Yet our spirit  is dismayed within us for all our desire to aid thee, if indeed the god  has granted this privilege to us two. For plain to discern to men of  earth are the reproofs of the immortals. And we will never check the  Harpies when they come, for all our desire, until thou hast sworn that  for this we shall not lose the favour of heaven.\"    (ll. 254-255) Thus he spake; and towards him the aged sire opened his  sightless eyes, and lifted them up and replied with these words:    (ll. 256-261) \"Be silent, store not up such thoughts in thy heart, my  child. Let the son of Leto be my witness, he who of his gracious will  taught me the lore of prophecy, and be witness the ill-starred doom  which possesses me and this dark cloud upon my eyes, and the gods of the  underworld--and may their curse be upon me if I die perjured thus--no  wrath from heaven will fall upon you two for your help to me.\"    (ll. 262-287) Then were those two eager to help him because of the oath.  And quickly the younger heroes prepared a feast for the aged man, a last  prey for the Harpies; and both stood near him, to smite with the sword  those pests when they swooped down. Scarcely had the aged man touched  the food when they forthwith, like bitter blasts or flashes of  lightning, suddenly darted from the clouds, and swooped down with a  yell, fiercely craving for food; and the heroes beheld them and shouted  in the midst of their onrush; but they at the cry devoured everything  and sped away over the sea after; and an intolerable stench remained.  And behind them the two sons of Boreas raising their swords rushed in  pursuit. For Zeus imparted to them tireless strength; but without Zeus  they could not have followed, for the Harpies used ever to outstrip the  blasts of the west wind when they came to Phineus and when they left  him. And as when, upon the mountain-side, hounds, cunning in the chase,  run in the track of horned goats or deer, and as they strain a little  behind gnash their teeth upon the edge of their jaws in vain; so Zetes  and Calais rushing very near just grazed the Harpies in vain with their  finger-tips. And assuredly they would have torn them to pieces, despite  heaven's will, when they had overtaken them far off at the Floating  Islands, had not swift Iris seen them and leapt down from the sky from  heaven above, and cheeked them with these words:    (ll. 288-290) \"It is not lawful, O sons of Boreas, to strike with your  swords the Harpies, the hounds of mighty Zeus; but I myself will give  you a pledge, that hereafter they shall not draw near to Phineus.\"    (ll. 291-300) With these words she took an oath by the waters of Styx,  which to all the gods is most dread and most awful, that the Harpies  would never thereafter again approach the home of Phineus, son of  Agenor, for so it was fated. And the heroes yielding to the oath, turned  back their flight to the ship. And on account of this men call them  the Islands of Turning though aforetime they called them the Floating  Islands. And the Harpies and Iris parted. They entered their den in  Minoan Crete; but she sped up to Olympus, soaring aloft on her swift  wings.    (ll. 301-310) Meanwhile the chiefs carefully cleansed the old man's  squalid skin and with due selection sacrificed sheep which they had  borne away from the spoil of Amycus. And when they had laid a huge  supper in the hall, they sat down and feasted, and with them feasted  Phineus ravenously, delighting his soul, as in a dream. And there, when  they had taken their fill of food and drink, they kept awake all night  waiting for the sons of Boreas. And the aged sire himself sat in the  midst, near the hearth, telling of the end of their voyage and the  completion of their journey:    (ll. 311-315) \"Listen then. Not everything is it lawful for you to  know clearly; but whatever is heaven's will, I will not hide. I was  infatuated aforetime, when in my folly I declared the will of Zeus  in order and to the end. For he himself wishes to deliver to men the  utterances of the prophetic art incomplete, in order that they may still  have some need to know the will of heaven.\"    (ll. 316-340) \"First of all, after leaving me, ye will see the twin  Cyanean rocks where the two seas meet. No one, I ween, has won his  escape between them. For they are not firmly fixed with roots beneath,  but constantly clash against one another to one point, and above a huge  mass of salt water rises in a crest, boiling up, and loudly dashes upon  the hard beach. Wherefore now obey my counsel, if indeed with prudent  mind and reverencing the blessed gods ye pursue your way; and perish not  foolishly by a self-sought death, or rush on following the guidance of  youth. First entrust the attempt to a dove when ye have sent her forth  from the ship. And if she escapes safe with her wings between the rocks  to the open sea, then no more do ye refrain from the path, but grip  your oars well in your hands and cleave the sea's narrow strait, for the  light of safety will be not so much in prayer as in strength of hands.  Wherefore let all else go and labour boldly with might and main, but  ere then implore the gods as ye will, I forbid you not. But if she flies  onward and perishes midway, then do ye turn back; for it is better to  yield to the immortals. For ye could not escape an evil doom from the  rocks, not even if Argo were of iron.\"    (ll. 341-359) \"O hapless ones, dare not to transgress my divine warning,  even though ye think that I am thrice as much hated by the sons of  heaven as I am, and even more than thrice; dare not to sail further  with your ship in despite of the omen. And as these things will fall, so  shall they fall. But if ye shun the clashing rocks and come scatheless  inside Pontus, straightway keep the land of the Bithynians on your right  and sail on, and beware of the breakers, until ye round the swift  river Rhebas and the black beach, and reach the harbour of the Isle of  Thynias. Thence ye must turn back a little space through the sea and  beach your ship on the land of the Mariandyni lying opposite. Here is  a downward path to the abode of Hades, and the headland of Acherusia  stretches aloft, and eddying Acheron cleaves its way at the bottom, even  through the headland, and sends its waters forth from a huge ravine. And  near it ye will sail past many hills of the Paphlagonians, over whom  at the first Eneteian Pelops reigned, and of his blood they boast  themselves to be.\"    (ll. 360-406) \"Now there is a headland opposite Helice the Bear, steep  on all sides, and they call it Carambis, about whose crests the blasts  of the north wind are sundered. So high in the air does it rise turned  towards the sea. And when ye have rounded it broad Aegialus stretches  before you; and at the end of broad Aegialus, at a jutting point of  coast, the waters of the river Halys pour forth with a terrible roar;  and after it his flowing near, but smaller in stream, rolls into the sea  with white eddies. Onward from thence the bend of a huge and towering  cape reaches out from the land, next Thermodon at its mouth flows into a  quiet bay at the Themiscyreian headland, after wandering through a broad  continent. And here is the plain of Doeas, and near are the three cities  of the Amazons, and after them the Chalybes, most wretched of men,  possess a soil rugged and unyielding sons of toil, they busy themselves  with working iron. And near them dwell the Tibareni,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/831"],[0,"Four Arthurian Romances (#11)"],[1," sing and dance, and outdo each  other in the merry-making. At the wedding that day everything was  done which can give joy and incline man's heart to gladness. Drums are  beaten, large and small, and there is playing of pipes, fifes, horns,  trumpets, and bagpipes. What more shall I say? There was not a wicket or  a gate kept closed; but the exits and entrances all stood ajar, so that  no one, poor or rich, was turned away. King Arthur was not miserly, but  gave orders to the bakers, the cooks, and the butlers that they should  serve every one generously with bread, wine, and venison. No one asked  anything whatever to be passed to him without getting all he desired.    (Vv. 2069-2134.) There was great merriment in the palace. But I will  pass over the rest, and you shall hear of the joy and pleasure in the  bridal chamber. Bishops and archbishops were there on the night when  the bride and groom retired. At this their first meeting, Iseut was not  filched away, nor was Brangien put in her place. [123] The Queen herself  took charge of their preparations for the night; for both of them were  dear to her. The hunted stag which pants for thirst does not so long for  the spring, nor does the hungry sparrow-hawk return so quickly when he  is called, as did these two come to hold each other in close embrace.  That night they had full compensation for their long delay. After the  chamber had been cleared, they allow each sense to be gratified: the  eyes, which are the entrance-way of love, and which carry messages to  the heart, take satisfaction in the glance, for they rejoice in all they  see; after the message of the eyes comes the far surpassing sweetness of  the kisses inviting love; both of them make trial of this sweetness, and  let their hearts quaff so freely that hardly can they leave off. Thus,  kissing was their first sport. And the love which is between them  emboldened the maid and left her quite without her fears; regardless of  pain, she suffered all. Before she rose, she no longer bore the name  of maid; in the morning she was a new-made dame. That day the minstrels  were in happy mood, for they were all well paid. They were fully  compensated for the entertainment they had given, and many a handsome  gift was bestowed upon them: robes of grey squirrel skin and ermine, of  rabbit skins and violet stuffs, scarlets and silken stuffs. Whether  it be a horse or money, each one got what he deserved according to his  skill. And thus the wedding festivities and the court lasted almost  a fortnight with great joy and magnificence. For his own glory and  satisfaction, as well as to honour Erec the more, King Arthur made all  the knights remain a full fortnight. When the third week began, all  together by common consent agreed to hold a tournament. On the one  side, my lord Gawain offered himself as surety that it would take place  between Evroic and Tenebroc: and Meliz and Meliadoc were guarantors on  the other side. Then the court separated.    (Vv. 2135-2292.) A month after Pentecost the tournament assembled, and  the jousting began in the plain below Tenebroc. Many an ensign of red,  blue, and white, many a veil and many a sleeve were bestowed as tokens  of love. Many a lance was carried there, flying the colours argent and  green, or gold and azure blue. There were many, too, with different  devices, some with stripes and some with dots. That day one saw laced on  many a helmet of gold or steel, some green, some yellow, and others red,  all aglowing in the sun; so many scutcheons and white hauberks; so many  swords girt on the left side; so many good shields, fresh and new, some  resplendent in silver and green, others of azure with buckles of gold;  so many good steeds marked with white, or sorrel, tawny, white, black,  and bay: all gather hastily. And now the field is quite covered with  arms. On either side the ranks tremble, and a roar rises from the fight.  The shock of the lances is very great. Lances break and shields are  riddled, the hauberks receive bumps and are torn asunder, saddles go  empty and horsemen ramble, while the horses sweat and foam. Swords are  quickly drawn on those who tumble noisily, and some run to receive the  promise of a ransom, others to stave off this disgrace. Erec rode a  white horse, and came forth alone at the head of the line to joust, if  he may find an opponent. From the opposite side there rides out to meet  him Orguelleus de la Lande, mounted on an Irish steed which bears  him along with marvellous speed. On the shield before his breast Erec  strikes him with such force that he knocks him from his horse: he leaves  him prone and passes on. Then Raindurant opposed him, son of the old  dame of Tergalo, covered with blue cloth of silk; he was a knight of  great prowess. Against one another now they charge and deal fierce blows  on the shields about their neck. Erec from lance's length lays him over  on the hard ground. While riding back he met the King of the Red City,  who was very valiant and bold. They grasp their reins by the knots and  their shields by the inner straps. They both had fine arms, and strong  swift horses, and good shields, fresh and new. With such fury they  strike each other that both their lances fly in splinters. Never was  there seen such a blow. They rush together with shields, arms, and  horses. But neither girth nor rein nor breast-strap could prevent the  king from coming to earth. So he flew from his steed, carrying with him  saddle and stirrup, and even the reins of his bridle in his hand. All  those who witnessed the jousting were filled with amazement, and said it  cost him dear to joust with such a goodly knight. Erec did not wish  to stop to capture either horse or rider, but rather to joust and  distinguish himself in order that his prowess might appear. He thrills  the ranks in front of him. Gawain animates those who were on his side  by his prowess, and by winning horses and knights to the discomfiture  of his opponents. I speak of my lord Gawain, who did right well and  valiantly. In the fight he unhorsed Guincel, and took Gaudin of the  Mountain; he captured knights and horses alike: my lord Gawain did well.  Girtlet the son of Do, and Yvain, and Sagremor the Impetuous, so evilly  entreated their adversaries that they drove them back to the gates,  capturing and unhorsing many of them. In front of the gate of the town  the strife began again between those within and those without. There  Sagremor was thrown down, who was a very gallant knight. He was on the  point of being detained and captured, when Erec spurs to rescue him,  breaking his lance into splinters upon one of the opponents. So hard he  strikes him on the breast that he made him quit the saddle. Then he  made of his sword and advances upon them, crushing and splitting their  helmets. Some flee, and others make way before him, for even the boldest  fears him. Finally, he distributed so many blows and thrusts that he  rescued Sagremor from them, and drove them all in confusion into the  town. Meanwhile, the vesper hour drew to a close. Erec bore himself so  well that day that he was the best of the combatants. But on the morrow  he did much better yet: for he took so many knights and left so many  saddles empty that none could believe it except those who had seen it.  Every one on both sides said that with his lance and shield he had won  the honours of the tournament. Now was Erec's renown so high that no one  spoke save of him, nor was any one of such goodly favour. In countenance  he resembled Absalom, in language he seemed a Solomon, in boldness he  equalled Samson, [124] and in generous giving and spending he was the  equal of Alexander. On his return from the tourney Erec went to speak  with the King. He went to ask him for leave to go and visit his own  land; but first he thanked him like a frank, wise, and courteous man for  the honour which he had done him; for very deep was his gratitude.  Then he asked his permission to leave, for he wished to visit his own  country, and he wished to take his wife with him. This request the King  could not deny, and yet he would have had him stay. He gives him leave  and begs him to return as soon as possible: for in the whole court there  was no better or more gallant knight, save only his dear nephew Gawain;  [125] with him no one could be compared. But next after him, he prized  Erec most, and held him more dear than any other knight.    (Vv. 2293-2764.) Erec wished to delay no longer. As soon as he had the  King's leave, he bid his wife make her preparations, and he retained as  his escort sixty knights of merit with horses and with dappled and grey  furs. As soon as he was ready for his journey, he tarried little further  at court, but took leave of the Queen and commended the knights to God.  The Queen grants him leave to depart. At the hour of prime he set out  from the royal palace. In the presence of them all he mounted his steed,  and his wife mounted the dappled horse which she had brought from her  own country; then all his escort mounted. Counting knights and squires,  there were full seven score in the train. After four long days' journey  over hills and slopes, through forests, plains, and streams, they  came on the fifth day to Camant, where King Lac was residing in a very  charming town. No one ever saw one better situated; for the town was  provided with forests and meadow-land, with vineyards and farms, with  streams and orchards, with ladies and knights, and fine, lively youths,  and polite, well-mannered clerks who spent their incomes freely, with  fair and charming maidens, and with prosperous burghers. Before Erec  reached the town, he sent two knights ahead to announce his arrival  to the King. When he heard the news, the King had clerks, knights, and  damsels quickly mount, and ordered the bells to be rung, and the streets  to be hung with tapestries and silken stuffs, that his son might be"]]]
