For instance, they placed six  pebbles at equal distances to intimate that Massachusetts Bay was  occupied by six tribes and governed by as many chiefs. By drawings of  growing maize and other plants they intimated that all these people  lived by agriculture.    [Footnote 13: The pigeons referred to by Champlain were probably the  Passenger pigeon (_Ectopistes_) which at one time was extraordinarily  abundant in parts of North America, though it has now been nearly  killed out by man. It would arrive in flocks of millions on its  migratory journeys in search of food.]    Champlain thought Massachusetts (in his first voyage) a most  attractive region in the summer, what with the blue water of the  enclosed arms of the sea, the lofty forest trees, and the fields of  Indian corn and other crops.    When these French explorers reached the harbour of Boston, the islands  and mainland were swarming with the native population. The Amerindians  were intensely interested in the arrival of the first sailing vessel  they had ever seen. Although it was only a small barque, its size was  greater than any canoe known to them. As it seemed to spread huge  white wings and to glide silently through the water without the use of  paddles or oars, it filled them with surprise and admiration. They  manned all their canoes[14] and came out in a flotilla to express  their honour and reverence for the wonderful white men. But when the  French took their leave, it was equally obvious that the natives  experienced a sense of relief, for they were disquieted as well as  filled with admiration at the arrival of these wonderful beings from  an unknown world.    [Footnote 14: It is interesting to learn from his accurate notes that  in Massachusetts (and from thence southwards) there were no more bark  canoes, but that the canoes were \"dug-outs\"--trunks of tall trees  burnt and chipped till they were hollowed into a narrow vessel of  considerable length.]    Champlain describes the wigwams or native huts as being cone-shaped,  heavily thatched with reeds, with an opening at the top of the roof  for the smoke to escape. Inside the huts was a low bed raised a foot  from the ground and made of short posts driven into the ground, with a  surface made of boards split from trees. On these boards were laid  either the dressed skins of deer or bear, or thick mattresses made of  reeds or rushes. The beds were large enough for several people to lie  on. Champlain describes the huts as being full of fleas, and likewise  the persons of the nearly naked Indians, who carried these fleas out  with them into the fields when they were working, so that the  Frenchmen by stopping to talk to the natives became covered with  fleas to such an extent that they were obliged to change their  clothes.    In the fields were cultivated not only maize, but beans similar to the  beans grown by the natives of Brazil, vegetable marrows or pumpkins,  Jerusalem artichokes[15], radishes, and tobacco. The woods were filled  with oaks, walnut trees[16], and the red \"cedar\" of North America,  really a very large juniper, the foliage of which in the summertime  often assumes a reddish colour, together with the trunk. This  Virginian juniper or \"red cedar\" is now quite a common tree in  England. In warm weather it exhales a delicious aromatic scent.    [Footnote 15: This tuber, which is a well-known and very useful  vegetable in England, comes from the root of a species of sunflower  (_Helianthus tuberosus_). It has nothing to do with the real  artichoke, which is a huge and gorgeous thistle, and it has equally  nothing to do with Jerusalem. The English people have always taken a  special delight in mispronouncing and corrupting words in order to  produce as much confusion as possible in their names for things.  Jerusalem is a corruption of _Girasole_, which is the Italian name  given to this sunflower with the edible roots, because its flower is  supposed always to turn towards the sun. The Jerusalem artichoke was  originally a native of North America.]    [Footnote 16: These walnut trees were afterwards known in modern  American speech as hickories, butter-nuts, and pig-nuts, all of which  are allied to, but distinct from, the European walnut.]    All these natives of the Massachusetts coast were described by  Champlain as being almost naked in the summertime, wearing at most a  small piece of leather round the waist, and a short robe of spun hemp  which hung down over the shoulders. Their faces were painted red,  black and yellow. The men pulled out any hairs which might come on the  chin, and thus were beardless. They were armed with pikes, clubs,  bows, and arrows. The pikes were probably made of wood with the ends  hardened by being burnt to a point in the fire, and the arrow tips  were made of the sharp termination of the tail of the great  king-crab[17].    [Footnote 17: _Limulus polyphemus_. This extraordinary crustacean is  one of the oldest of living animals in its history, as it is closely  related to the Xiphosura and even the Trilobites of the Primary Epoch,  which existed millions of years ago. In a rough way it is a kind of  connecting link between the Crustacea, or crabs and lobsters, and the  Scorpions and spiders.]    These Massachusetts \"Indians\" described to Champlain a wonderful bird  which at some seasons of the year they caught in snares and ate. This  Champlain at once guessed was the wild turkey, now, of course, quite  extinct in that region. This wild turkey of the eastern half of North  America (including southern Canada) was quite a distinct form from the  Mexican bird, which last is the origin of our domestic turkey.    In July, 1606, as De Monts had not returned from France, and the  little colony at Port Royal was without supplies, they decided to  leave two Frenchmen in charge of the local chief of the Mikmak  Indians, and find their way along the coast to Cape Breton, where they  might get a fishing vessel to take them back to France. But after  travelling in an open boat--a chaloupe--round the coast of Nova Scotia  they met another small boat off Cape Sable, under the charge of the  secretary of De Monts, and learnt that Lieutenant-General DE  POUTRINCOURT[18] (one of the great names amongst the pioneers of  Canada, and the man who had really chosen Port Royal for the French  headquarters at Nova Scotia) had already returned from France with  fresh supplies. Consequently, Champlain and his companions returned to  Port Royal, and all set to work with eagerness to develop the  settlement. Champlain relates in his book how he created vegetable  gardens, trout streams and ponds, and a reservoir of salt water for  sea fish; but he was soon off again on a fresh journey of exploration,  because De Monts was not satisfied with Nova Scotia on account of the  cold in winter. Accordingly Champlain examined the whole coast round  the Bay of Fundy, and down to Cape Cod, and the islands of Martha's  Vineyard and Nantucket. But in this region, already visited in past  times by French, Spanish, and English ships, they found the natives  treacherous and hostile. An unprovoked attack was made on the French  after they landed, and several of the seamen were killed with arrows.    [Footnote 18: Jean de Biencourt, the Sieur de Poutrincourt and Baron  de Saint-Just, were his full titles.]    On the 24th of May, 1607, a small barque of six or seven tons burden  (fancy crossing the wide Atlantic from Brittany to Nova Scotia in a  ship of that size at the present day!) arrived outside Port Royal from  France, with an abrupt notification that De Monts' ten years' monopoly  and charter were _cancelled_ by Henry IV, and that all the colony was  to be withdrawn and brought back to France. Henry IV took this action  simply because De Monts attempted to make his monopoly a real one,[19]  and stop the ships of fur traders who were trading with the  Amerindians of Cape Breton without his licence. These fur traders of  Normandy then complained bitterly that because De Monts was a  Protestant he was allowed not only to have this monopoly, but to  endanger the spiritual welfare of the savages by spreading his false  doctrines! So King Henry IV, volatile and capricious, like most of the  French kings, cancelled a charter which had led to such heroic and  remarkable results.    [Footnote 19: You will observe that neither the French nor the English  sovereigns of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries went to much  personal expense over the creation of colonies. They simply gave a  charter or a monopoly, which cost them nothing, but which made other  people pay.]    The greater part of the little colony had to leave Port Royal and make  its way in small boats along the Nova Scotia coasts till they reached  Cape Breton Island. Here fishing vessels conveyed them back to  Brittany. It was in this boat journeying along the coast of Nova  Scotia that Champlain discovered Halifax Harbour, then called by the  Indian name of Shebuktu. As they passed along this coast with its many  islands, they feasted on ripe raspberries, which grew everywhere \"in  the greatest possible quantity\".    Poutrincourt, however, had succeeded in taking back with him samples  of the corn, wheat, rye, barley, and oats which had been so  successfully grown on the island of Sainte Croix and at Port Royal,  and also presented to that monarch five brent-geese[20] which he had  reared up from eggs hatched under a hen. The king was so delighted at  these presents that he once more veered about and gave to De Monts the  monopoly of the fur trade for one more year, in order to enable him to  renew his colonies in New France.    [Footnote 20: _Branta canadensis_, a handsome black-and-brown goose  with white markings, which the French pioneers in Canada styled  \"outarde\" or \"bustard\", and whose eggs were considered very good  eating.]      The Sieur de Monts was again appointed by Henry IV Lieutenant-General  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13015"],[0,"Tales of Old Japan (#12)"],[1,"15: _The Legacy of Iyeyasu_, translated by F. Lowder.  Yokohama, 1868. (Printed for private circulation.)]    The occupation of a swordsmith is an honourable profession, the  members of which are men of gentle blood. In a country where trade is  looked down upon as degrading, it is strange to find this single  exception to the general rule. The traditions of the craft are many  and curious. During the most critical moment of the forging of the  sword, when the steel edge is being welded into the body of the iron  blade, it is a custom which still obtains among old-fashioned  armourers to put on the cap and robes worn by the Kuge, or nobles of  the Mikado's court, and, closing the doors of the workshop, to labour  in secrecy and freedom from interruption, the half gloom adding to the  mystery of the operation. Sometimes the occasion is even invested with  a certain sanctity, a tasselled cord of straw, such as is hung before  the shrines of the Kami, or native gods of Japan, being suspended  between two bamboo poles in the forge, which for the nonce is  converted into a holy altar.    At Osaka, I lived opposite to one Kusano Yoshiaki, a swordsmith, a  most intelligent and amiable gentleman, who was famous throughout his  neighbourhood for his good and charitable deeds. His idea was that,  having been bred up to a calling which trades in life and death, he  was bound, so far as in him lay, to atone for this by seeking to  alleviate the suffering which is in the world; and he carried out his  principle to the extent of impoverishing himself. No neighbour ever  appealed to him in vain for help in tending the sick or burying the  dead. No beggar or lazar was ever turned from his door without  receiving some mark of his bounty, whether in money or in kind. Nor  was his scrupulous honesty less remarkable than his charity. While  other smiths are in the habit of earning large sums of money by  counterfeiting the marks of the famous makers of old, he was able to  boast that he had never turned out a weapon which bore any other mark  than his own. From his father and his forefathers he inherited his  trade, which, in his turn, he will hand over to his son--a  hard-working, honest, and sturdy man, the clank of whose hammer and  anvil may be heard from daybreak to sundown.    [Illustration: FORGING THE SWORD.]    The trenchant edge of the Japanese sword is notorious. It is said that  the best blades will in the hands of an expert swordsman cut through  the dead bodies of three men, laid one upon the other, at a blow. The  swords of the Shogun used to be tried upon the corpses of executed  criminals; the public headsman was entrusted with the duty, and for a  \"nose medicine,\" or bribe of two bus (about three shillings), would  substitute the weapon of a private individual for that of his Lord.  Dogs and beggars, lying helpless by the roadside, not unfrequently  serve to test a ruffian's sword; but the executioner earns many a fee  from those who wish to see how their blades will cut off a head.    The statesman who shall enact a law forbidding the carrying of this  deadly weapon will indeed have deserved well of his country; but it  will be a difficult task to undertake, and a dangerous one. I would  not give much for that man's life. The hand of every swashbuckler in  the empire would be against him. One day as we were talking over this  and other kindred subjects, a friend of mine, a man of advanced and  liberal views, wrote down his opinion, _more Japonico_, in a verse of  poetry which ran as follows:--\"I would that all the swords and dirks  in the country might be collected in one place and molten down, and  that, from the metal so produced, one huge sword might be forged,  which, being the only blade left, should be the girded sword of Great  Japan.\"    The following history is in more senses than one a \"Tale of a Sword.\"    About two hundred and fifty years ago Ikeda Kunaishoyu was Lord of the  Province of Inaba. Among his retainers were two gentlemen, named  Watanabe Yukiye and Kawai Matazayemon, who were bound together by  strong ties of friendship, and were in the habit of frequently  visiting at one another's houses. One day Yukiye was sitting  conversing with Matazayemon in the house of the latter, when, on a  sudden, a sword that was lying in the raised part of the room caught  his eye. As he saw it, he started and said--    \"Pray tell me, how came you by that sword?\"    \"Well, as you know, when my Lord Ikeda followed my Lord Tokugawa  Iyeyasu to fight at Nagakude, my father went in his train; and it was  at the battle of Nagakude that he picked up this sword.\"    \"My father went too, and was killed in the fight, and this sword,  which was an heirloom in our family for many generations, was lost at  that time. As it is of great value in my eyes, I do wish that, if you  set no special store by it, you would have the great kindness to  return it to me.\"    \"That is a very easy matter, and no more than what one friend should  do by another. Pray take it.\"    Upon this Yukiye gratefully took the sword, and having carried it home  put it carefully away.    At the beginning of the ensuing year Matazayemon fell sick and died,  and Yukiye, mourning bitterly for the loss of his good friend, and  anxious to requite the favour which he had received in the matter of  his father's sword, did many acts of kindness to the dead man's  son--a young man twenty-two years of age, named Matagoro.    Now this Matagoro was a base-hearted cur, who had begrudged the sword  that his father had given to Yukiye, and complained publicly and often  that Yukiye had never made any present in return; and in this way  Yukiye got a bad name in my Lord's palace as a stingy and illiberal  man.    But Yukiye had a son, called Kazuma, a youth sixteen years of age, who  served as one of the Prince's pages of honour. One evening, as he and  one of his brother pages were talking together, the latter said--    \"Matagoro is telling everybody that your father accepted a handsome  sword from him and never made him any present in return, and people  are beginning to gossip about it.\"    \"Indeed,\" replied the other, \"my father received that sword from  Matagoro's father as a mark of friendship and good-will, and,  considering that it would be an insult to send a present of money in  return, thought to return the favour by acts of kindness towards  Matagoro. I suppose it is money he wants.\"    When Kazuma's service was over, he returned home, and went to his  father's room to tell him the report that was being spread in the  palace, and begged him to send an ample present of money to Matagoro.  Yukrye reflected for a while, and said--    \"You are too young to understand the right line of conduct in such  matters. Matagoro's father and myself were very close friends; so,  seeing that he had ungrudgingly given me back the sword of my  ancestors, I, thinking to requite his kindness at his death, rendered  important services to Matagoro. It would be easy to finish the matter  by sending a present of money; but I had rather take the sword and  return it than be under an obligation to this mean churl, who knows  not the laws which regulate the intercourse and dealings of men of  gentle blood.\"    So Yukiye, in his anger, took the sword to Matagoro's house, and said  to him--    \"I have come to your house this night for no other purpose than to  restore to you the sword which your father gave me;\" and with this he  placed the sword before Matagoro.    \"Indeed,\" replied the other, \"I trust that you will not pain me by  returning a present which my father made you.\"    \"Amongst men of gentle birth,\" said Yukiye, laughing scornfully, \"it  is the custom to requite presents, in the first place by kindness, and  afterwards by a suitable gift offered with a free heart. But it is no  use talking to such as you, who are ignorant of the first principles  of good breeding; so I have the honour to give you back the sword.\"    As Yukiye went on bitterly to reprove Matagoro, the latter waxed very  wroth, and, being a ruffian, would have killed Yukiye on the spot; but  he, old man as he was, was a skilful swordsman, so Matagoro,  craven-like, determined to wait until he could attack him unawares.  Little suspecting any treachery, Yukiye started to return home, and  Matagoro, under the pretence of attending him to the door, came behind  him with his sword drawn and cut him in the shoulder. The older man,  turning round, drew and defended himself; but having received a severe  wound in the first instance, he fainted away from loss of blood, and  Matagoro slew him.    The mother of Matagoro, startled by the noise, came out; and when she  saw what had been done, she was afraid, and said--\"Passionate man!  what have you done? You are a murderer; and now your life will be  forfeit. What terrible deed is this!\"    \"I have killed him now, and there's nothing to be done. Come, mother,  before the matter becomes known, let us fly together from this house.\"    \"I will follow you; do you go and seek out my Lord Abe Shirogoro, a  chief among the Hatamotos,[16] who was my foster-child. You had better  fly to him for protection, and remain in hiding.\"    [Footnote 16: _Hatamotos._ The Hatamotos were the feudatory nobles of  the Shogun or Tycoon. The office of Taikun having been abolished, the  Hatamotos no longer exist. For further information respecting them,  see the note at the end of the story.]    So the old woman persuaded her son to make his escape, and sent him to  the palace of Shirogoro.    Now it happened that at this time the Hatamotos had formed themselves  into a league against the powerful Daimios; and Abe Shirogoro, with  two other noblemen, named Kondo Noborinosuke and Midzuno Jiurozayemon,  was at the head of the league. It followed, as a matter of course,  that his forces were frequently recruited by vicious men, who had no  means of gaining their living, and whom he"]]]
