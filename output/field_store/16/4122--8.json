[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11074"],[0,"The Damned (#12)"],[1,"God is love, remember, and love  means charity, tolerance, sympathy, and sparing others pain,\" and I  hurried past her, determined to end the outrageous conversation for  which yet I knew myself entirely to blame. Behind me, she stood  stock-still for several minutes, half bewildered, half alarmed, as I  suspected. I caught the fragment of another sentence, one word of it,  rather--\"punishment\"--but the rest escaped me. Her arrogance and  condescending tolerance exasperated me, while I was at the same time  secretly pleased that I might have touched some string of remorse or  sympathy in her after all. Her belief was iron; she dared not let it go;  yet somewhere underneath there lurked the germ of a wholesome revulsion.  She would help \"them\"--if she dared. Her question proved it.    Half ashamed of myself, I turned and crossed the hall quickly lest I  should be tempted to say more, and in me was a disagreeable sensation as  though I had just left the Incurable Ward of some great hospital. A  reaction caught me as of nausea. Ugh! I wanted such people cleansed by  fire. They seemed to me as centers of contamination whose vicious  thoughts flowed out to stain God's glorious world. I saw myself,  Frances, Mabel too especially, on the rack, while that odious figure of  cruelty and darkness stood over us and ordered the awful handles turned  in order that we might be \"saved\"--forced, that is, to think and believe  exactly as she thought and believed.    I found relief for my somewhat childish indignation by letting myself  loose upon the organ then. The flood of Bach and Beethoven brought back  the sense of proportion. It proved, however, at the same time that there  had been this growth of distortion in me, and that it had been provided  apparently by my closer contact--for the first time--with that funereal  personality, the woman who, like her master, believed that all holding  views of God that differed from her own, must be damned eternally. It  gave me, moreover, some faint clue perhaps, though a clue I was unequal  of following up, to the nature of the strife and terror and frustrate  influence in the house. That housekeeper had to do with it. She kept it  alive. Her thought was like a spell she waved above her mistress's head.          Chapter VII      That night I was wakened by a hurried tapping at my door, and before I  could answer, Frances stood beside my bed. She had switched on the light  as she came in. Her hair fell straggling over her dressing gown. Her  face was deathly pale, its expression so distraught it was almost  haggard.    The eyes were very wide. She looked almost like another woman.    She was whispering at a great pace: \"Bill, Bill, wake up, quick!\"    \"I am awake. What is it?\" I whispered too. I was startled.    \"Listen!\" was all she said. Her eyes stared into vacancy.    There was not a sound in the great house. The wind had dropped, and all  was still. Only the tapping seemed to continue endlessly in my brain.  The clock on the mantelpiece pointed to half-past two.    \"I heard nothing, Frances. What is it?\" I rubbed my eyes; I had been  very deeply asleep.    \"Listen!\" she repeated very softly, holding up one finger and turning  her eyes towards the door she had left ajar. Her usual calmness had  deserted her. She was in the grip of some distressing terror.    For a full minute we held our breath and listened. Then her eyes rolled  round again and met my own, and her skin went even whiter than before.    \"It woke me,\" she said beneath her breath, and moving a step nearer to  my bed. \"It was the Noise.\" Even her whisper trembled.    \"The Noise!\" The word repeated itself dully of its own accord. I would  rather it had been anything in the world but that--earthquake, foreign  cannon, collapse of the house above our heads! \"The Noise, Frances! Are  you sure?\" I was playing really for a little time.    \"It was like thunder. At first I thought it was thunder. But a minute  later it came again--from underground. It's appalling.\" She muttered the  words, her voice not properly under control.    There was a pause of perhaps a minute, and then we both spoke at once.  We said foolish, obvious things that neither of us believed in for a  second. The roof had fallen in, there were burglars downstairs, the  safes had been blown open. It was to comfort each other as children do  that we said these things; also it was to gain further time.    \"There's some one in the house, of course,\" I heard my voice say  finally, as I sprang out of bed and hurried into dressing gown and  slippers. \"Don't be alarmed. I'll go down and see,\" and from the drawer  I took a pistol it was my habit to carry everywhere with me. I loaded it  carefully while Frances stood stock-still beside the bed and watched. I  moved towards the open door.    \"You stay here, Frances,\" I whispered, the beating of my heart making  the words uneven, \"while I go down and make a search. Lock yourself in,  girl. Nothing can happen to you. It was downstairs, you said?\"    \"Underneath,\" she answered faintly, pointing through the floor.    She moved suddenly between me and the door.    \"Listen! Hark!\" she said, the eyes in her face quite fixed; \"it's coming  again,\" and she turned her head to catch the slightest sound. I stood  there watching her, and while I watched her, shook.    But nothing stirred. From the halls below rose only the whirr and quiet  ticking of the numerous clocks. The blind by the open window behind us  flapped out a little into the room as the draught caught it.    \"I'll come with you, Bill--to the next floor,\" she broke the silence.  \"Then I'll stay with Mabel--till you come up again.\" The blind sank down  with a long sigh as she said it.    The question jumped to my lips before I could repress it:    \"Mabel is awake. She heard it too?\"    I hardly know why horror caught me at her answer. All was so vague and  terrible as we stood there playing the great game of this sinister house  where nothing ever happened.    \"We met in the passage. She was on her way to me.\"    What shook in me, shook inwardly. Frances, I mean, did not see it. I had  the feeling just that the Noise was upon us, that any second it would  boom and roar about our ears. But the deep silence held. I only heard my  sister's little whisper coming across the room in answer to my question:    \"Then what is Mabel doing now?\"    And her reply proved that she was yielding at last beneath the dreadful  tension, for she spoke at once, unable longer to keep up the pretence.  With a kind of relief, as it were, she said it out, looking helplessly  at me like a child:    \"She is weeping and gna--\"    My expression must have stopped her. I believe I clapped both hands upon  her mouth, though when I realized things clearly again, I found they  were covering my own ears instead. It was a moment of unutterable  horror. The revulsion I felt was actually physical. It would have given  me pleasure to fire off all the five chambers of my pistol into the air  above my head; the sound--a definite, wholesome sound that explained  itself--would have been a positive relief. Other feelings, though, were  in me too, all over me, rushing to and fro. It was vain to seek their  disentanglement; it was impossible. I confess that I experienced, among  them, a touch of paralyzing fear--though for a moment only; it passed as  sharply as it came, leaving me with a violent flush of blood to the face  such as bursts of anger bring, followed abruptly by an icy perspiration  over the entire body. Yet I may honestly avow that it was not ordinary  personal fear I felt, nor any common dread of physical injury. It was,  rather, a vast, impersonal shrinking--a sympathetic shrinking--from the  agony and terror that countless others, somewhere, somehow, felt for  themselves. The first sensation of a prison overwhelmed me in that  instant, of bitter strife and frenzied suffering, and the fiery torture  of the yearning to escape that was yet hopelessly uttered.... It was of  incredible power. It was real. The vain, intolerable hope swept over me.    I mastered myself, though hardly knowing how, and took my sister's hand.  It was as cold as ice, as I led her firmly to the door and out into the  passage. Apparently she noticed nothing of my so near collapse, for I  caught her whisper as we went. \"You are brave, Bill; splendidly brave.\"    The upper corridors of the great sleeping house were brightly lit; on  her way to me she had turned on every electric switch her hand could  reach; and as we passed the final flight of stairs to the floor below, I  heard a door shut softly and knew that Mabel had been listening--waiting  for us. I led my sister up to it. She knocked, and the door was opened  cautiously an inch or so. The room was pitch black. I caught no glimpse  of Mabel standing there. Frances turned to me with a hurried whisper,  \"Billy, you will be careful, won't you?\" and went in. I just had time to  answer that I would not be long, and Frances to reply, \"You'll find us  here\" when the door closed and cut her sentence short before its end.    But it was not alone the closing door that took the final words.  Frances--by the way she disappeared I knew it--had made a swift and  violent movement into the darkness that was as though she sprang. She  leaped upon that other woman who stood back among the shadows, for,  simultaneously with the clipping of the sentence, another sound was also  stopped--stifled, smothered, choked back lest I should also hear it. Yet  not in time. I heard it--a hard and horrible sound that explained both  the leap and the abrupt cessation of the whispered words.    I stood irresolute a moment. It was as though all the bones had been  withdrawn from my body, so that I must sink and fall. That sound plucked  them out, and plucked out my self-possession with them. I am not sure  that it was a sound I had ever heard before, though children, I half  remembered, made it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11093"],[0,"Trailin'! (#12)"],[1," here askin' after Bard?\" began Logan without the  slightest prelude.    \"Bard? Who's he?\"    Logan considered the other with a sardonic smile.    \"Maybe you been ridin' all night jest for fun?\"    \"If you start usin' your tongue on me, Logan you'll wear out the snapper  on it. I'm on my way to the A Circle Y.\"    \"Listen; I'm all for old man Drew. You know that. Tell me what Bard has  on him?\"    \"Never heard the name before. Did he rustle a couple of your sheep?\"    Logan went on patiently: \"I knew something was wrong when Drew was here  yesterday but I didn't think it was as bad as this.\"    \"What did Drew do yesterday?\"    \"Came up as usual to potter around the old house, I guess, but when he  heard about Bard bein' here he changed his mind sudden and went home.\"    \"That's damn queer. What sort of a lookin' feller is this Bard?\"    \"I don't suppose you know, eh?\" queried Logan ironically. \"I don't  suppose the old man described him before you started, maybe?\"    \"Logan, you poor old hornless maverick, d'you think I'm on somebody's  trail? Don't you know I've been through with that sort of game for a  hell of a while?\"    \"When rocks turn into ham and eggs I'll trust you, Steve. I'll tell you  what I done to Bard, anyway. Yesterday, after he found that Drew had  been here and gone he seemed sort of upset; tried to keep it from me,  but I'm too much used to judgin' changes of weather to be fooled by any  tenderfoot that ever used school English. Then he hinted around about  learnin' the way to Eldara, because he knows that town is pretty close  to Drew's place, I guess. I told him; sure I did. He should of gone due  west, but I sent him south. There is a south trail, only it takes about  three days to get to Eldara.\"    \"Maybe you think that interests me. It don't.\"    Logan overlooked this rejoinder, saying: \"Is it his scalp you're after?\"    \"Your ideas are like nest-eggs, Logan, an' you set over 'em like a hen.  They look like eggs; they feel like eggs; but they don't never hatch.  That's the way with your ideas. They look all right; they sound all  right; but they don't mean nothin'. So-long.\"    But Logan merely chuckled wisely. He had been long on the range.    As Nash turned his pony and trotted off in the direction of the A  Circle Y ranch, the sheepherder called after him: \"What you say cuts  both ways, Steve. This feller Bard looks like a tenderfoot; he sounds  like a tenderfoot; but he ain't a tenderfoot.\"    Feeling that this parting shot gave him the honours of the meeting, he  turned away whistling with such spirit that one of his dogs,  overhearing, stood still and gazed at his master with his head cocked  wisely to one side.    His eastern course Nash pursued for a mile or more, and then swung sharp  to the south. He was weary, like his horse, and he made no attempt to  start a sudden burst of speed. He let the pony go on at the same  tireless jog, clinging like a bulldog to the trail.    About midday he sighted a small house cuddled into a hollow of the hills  and made toward it. As he dismounted, a tow-headed, spindling boy  lounged out of the doorway and stood with his hands shoved carelessly  into his little overall pockets.    \"Hello, young feller.\"    \"'Lo, stranger.\"    \"What's the chance of bunking here for three or four hours and gettin' a  good feed for the hoss?\"    \"Never better. Gimme the hoss; I'll put him up in the shed. Feed him  grain?\"    \"No, you won't put him up. I'll tend to that.\"    \"Looks like a bad 'un.\"    \"That's it.\"    \"But a sure goer, eh?\"    \"Yep.\"    He led the pony to the shed, unsaddled him, and gave him a small feed.  The horse first rolled on the dirt floor and then started methodically  on his fodder. Having made sure that his mount was not \"off his feed,\"  Nash rolled a cigarette and strolled back to the house with the boy.    \"Where's the folks?\" he asked.    \"Ma's sick, a little, and didn't get up to-day. Pa's down to the corral,  cussing mad. But I can cook you up some chow.\"    \"All right son. I got a dollar here that'll buy you a pretty good store  knife.\"    The boy flushed so red that by contrast his straw coloured hair seemed  positively white.    \"Maybe you want to pay me?\" he suggested fiercely. \"Maybe you think  we're squatters that run a hotel?\"    Recognizing the true Western breed even in this small edition, Nash  grinned.    \"Speakin' man to man, son, I didn't think that, but I thought I'd sort  of feel my way.\"    \"Which I'll say you're lucky you didn't try to feel your way with pa;  not the way he's feelin' now.\"    In the shack of the house he placed the best chair for Nash and set  about frying ham and making coffee. This with crackers, formed the meal.  He watched Nash eat for a moment of solemn silence and then the foreman  looked up to catch a meditative chuckle from the youngster.    \"Let me in on the joke, son.\"    \"Nothin'. I was just thinkin' of pa.\"    \"What's he sore about? Come out short at poker lately?\"    \"No; he lost a hoss. Ha, ha, ha!\"    He explained: \"He's lost his only standin' joke, and now the laugh's on  pa!\"    Nash sipped his coffee and waited. On the mountain desert one does not  draw out a narrator with questions.    \"There was a feller come along early this mornin' on a lame hoss,\" the  story began. \"He was a sure enough tenderfoot--leastways he looked it  an' he talked it, but he wasn't.\"    The familiarity of this description made Steve sit up a trifle  straighter.    \"Was he a ringer?\"    \"Maybe. I dunno. Pa meets him at the door and asks him in. What d'you  think this feller comes back with?\"    The boy paused to remember and then with twinkling eyes he mimicked:  \"'That's very good of you, sir, but I'll only stop to make a trade with  you--this horse and some cash to boot for a durable mount out of your  corral. The brute has gone lame, you see.'    \"Pa waited and scratched his head while these here words sort of sunk  in. Then says very smooth: 'I'll let you take the best hoss I've got,  an' I won't ask much cash to boot.'    \"I begin wonderin' what pa was drivin' at, but I didn't say  nothin'--jest held myself together and waited.    \"'Look over there to the corral,' says pa, and pointed. 'They's a hoss  that ought to take you wherever you want to go. It's the best hoss I've  ever had.'    \"It was the best horse pa ever had, too. It was a piebald pinto called  Jo, after my cousin Josiah, who's jest a plain bad un and raises hell  when there's any excuse. The piebald, he didn't even need an excuse. You  see, he's one of them hosses that likes company. When he leaves the  corral he likes to have another hoss for a runnin' mate and he was jest  as tame as anything. I could ride him; anybody could ride him. But if  you took him outside the bars of the corral without company, first thing  he done was to see if one of the other hosses was comin' out to join  him. When he seen that he was all laid out to make a trip by himself he  jest nacherally started in to raise hell. Which Jo can raise more hell  for his size than any hoss I ever seen.    \"He's what you call an eddicated bucker. He don't fool around with no  pauses. He jest starts in and figgers out a situation and then he gets  busy slidin' the gent that's on him off'n the saddle. An' he always used  to win out. In fact, he was known for it all around these parts. He  begun nice and easy, but he worked up like a fiddler playin' a favourite  piece, and the end was the rider lyin' on the ground.    \"Whenever the boys around here wanted any excitement they used to come  over and try their hands with Jo. We used to keep a pile of arnica and  stuff like that around to rub them up with and tame down the bruises  after Jo laid 'em cold on the ground. There wasn't never anybody could  ride that hoss when he was started out alone.    \"Well, this tenderfoot, he looks over the hoss in the corral and says:  'That's a pretty fine mount, it seems to me. What do you want to boot?'    \"'Aw, twenty-five dollars is enough,' says pa.    \"'All right,' says the tenderfoot, 'here's the money.'    \"And he counts it out in pa's hand.    \"He says: 'What a little beauty! It would be a treat to see him work on  a polo field.'    \"Pa says: 'It'd'be a treat to see this hoss work anywhere.'    \"Then he steps on my foot to make me wipe the grin off'n my face.    \"Down goes the tenderfoot and takes his saddle and flops it on the  piebald pinto, and the piebald was jest as nice as milk. Then he leads  him out'n the corral and gets on.    \"First the pinto takes a look over his shoulder like he was waiting for  one of his pals among the hosses to come along, but he didn't see none.  Then the circus started. An' b'lieve me, it was some circus. Jo hadn't  had much action for some time, an' he must have used the wait thinkin'  up new ways of raisin' hell.    \"There ain't enough words in the Bible to describe what he done. Which  maybe you sort of gather that he had to keep on performin', because the  tenderfoot was still in the saddle. He was. An' he never pulled  leather. No, sir, he never touched the buckin' strap, but jest sat there  with his teeth set and his lips twistin' back--the same smile he had  when he got into the saddle. But pretty soon I s'pose Jo had a chance to  figure out that it didn't do him no particular harm to be alone.    \"The minute he seen that he stopped fightin' and started off at a gallop  the way the tenderfoot wanted him to go, which was over there.    \"'Damn my eyes!' says pa, an' couldn't do nuthin' but just stand there  repeatin' that with variations because with Jo gone there wouldn't be no  drawin' card to get the boys around the house no more. But you're  lookin' sort of sleepy, stranger?\"    \"I am,\" answered Nash.    \"Well, if you'd seen that show you wouldn't be thinkin' of sleep. Not  for some time.\"    \"Maybe not, but the point is I didn't see it. D'you mind if I turn in on  that bunk over there?\"    \"Help yourself,\" said the boy. \"What time d'you"]]]
