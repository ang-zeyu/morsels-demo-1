[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12984"],[0,"Eugene Field, a Study in Heredity and Contradictions — Volume 1 (#12)"],[1,"Tufts homestead rise some beautifully wooded hills, where  Field and his schoolmates sought refuge from the gentle wrath of Mr.  Tufts over their not infrequent delinquencies. The story is told in  Monson that the boys, under the leadership of Field, built a \"moated  castle\" of tree-trunks and brushwood in a well-nigh inaccessible part  of these woods. Thence they sallied forth on their imaginary forays and  thither they retired when in disgrace with Mr. Tufts. Around this  retreat they dug a deep trench, which they covered artfully with boughs  and dead leaves. Then they beguiled their reverend preceptor into  chasing them to their \"mountain fastness.\" Lightly they skipped across  the concealed moat on the only firm ground they had purposely left,  leaving him in the moment of exultant success to plunge neck deep into  a tangled mass of brushwood and mud. In such playful ways as these  Field endeared himself to the frequent forgiveness of Mr. Tufts. \"It  was impossible,\" said Mr. Tufts to me, \"to cherish anger against a  pupil whose contrition was as profuse and whimsical as his  transgressions were frequent. The boys were boys.\"    Of Eugene's education when he came to Monson Mr. Tufts testifies: \"In  his studies he was about fitted for an ordinary high school, except in  arithmetic. He had read a little Latin--enough to commence Caesar. I  found him about an average boy in his lessons, not dull, but not a  quick and ready scholar like his father, who graduated from Middlebury  College at the age of fifteen, strong and athletic. He did not seem to  care much for his books or his lessons anyway, but was inclined to get  along as easily as he could, partly on account of his delicate health,  which made close study irksome, and partly because his mind was very  juvenile and undeveloped. His health improved gradually, while his  interest in his studies increased slowly but steadily. Judge Forbes, of  Westboro, for a time his room-mate and a remarkable scholar, remarked  on reading his journal that his chum occasionally took up his book for  study when his teacher came around, though he was not always particular  which side up his book was. And so it was through life.\"    But Eugene did improve in his scholarship, and during the last six  months before leaving to enter Williams College, in 1868, Mr. Tufts  says he did seem \"to catch something of the spirit of Cicero and Virgil  and Homer [where was Horace?], and to catch a little ambition for an  education.\" His gentle preceptor thus summed up the characteristics of  the youth he was trying to fit for college:    \"Eugene gave little if any indications of becoming a poet, or such  a poet as he was, or even a superior writer, in his youth. He was  always, however bright and lively in conversation, abounding in wit,  self-possessed, and never laughing at his own jokes, showing, too, some  of that exhaustless fountain of humor in which he afterward excelled.  But he did not like confinement or close application, nor did he have  patience to correct and improve what he wrote, as he afterward did when  his taste was more cultivated. In declamation Eugene always excelled,  reciting with marked effect 'Spartacus,' 'The Soldier of the Legion,'  and 'The Dream of Clarence' from Shakespeare. He inherited from his  father a rich, strong, musical, and sympathetic voice, which made him a  pleasant speaker and afterward a successful public reader. He very  naturally excelled in conversation at table and in getting up little  comic almanacs, satirizing the boys, but always in good-humor, never  descending to anything bitter or vulgar. Indeed, in all his fun, he  showed ever a certain purity and nobility of character.\"    On one occasion, Eugene wearied of the persistent efforts of Mr. Tufts  to place his feet on the first rung of the ladder to learning, and  started off afoot for his home in Amherst. He followed the railway  track, counting the ties for twenty-five miles, and arrived, thoroughly  exhausted, full of contrition, and ready to take the first train back  to school. This was probably the most severe physical effort of Eugene  Field's life.    Mr. Tufts says that Field was \"by nature and by his training, too,  respectful toward religion and religious people, being at one time here  [Monson] considerably moved and interested personally in a religious  awakening, and speaking earnestly in meeting and urging the young to a  religious life. Great credit for the remarkable success of Eugene is  due to his Aunt Jones, Miss Mary French, and his guardian, Professor  John Burgess, who were a continual and living influence about him until  he arrived at maturity.\"    In 1868, at the age when his father was admitted to the bar of Vermont,  Eugene Field, according to Mr. Tufts, was barely able to pass the  examination for entrance at Williams \"with some conditions.\" The only  evidence preserved in the books of the college that he passed at all is  the following entry:      Eugene Field, aged 18, September 5, 1868, son of R.M. Field,    St. Louis.    [Illustration: THE REV. JAMES TUFTS.]    Among the professors and residents of Williamstown there is scarcely a  tradition or trace of his presence. He did not fit into the treadmill  of daily lessons and lectures. He was impatient of routine and  discipline. There is a story extant, which is a self-evident  fabrication, that President Mark Hopkins, meeting him on the street one  day, asked him how he was getting along with his studies. Field replied  that he was doing very well. Thereupon President Hopkins, in kindly  humor, remarked: \"I am glad to hear it, for, remember, you have the  reputation of three universities to maintain.\" This apocryphal story is  greatly relished in Williamstown, where, among the professors, there  seems to linger a strange feeling of resentment that Field was not  recognized as possessing the budding promise that is better worth  cultivating than the mediocrity of the ninety-and-nine orderly youths  who pursue the uneventful tenor of college life to a diploma--and are  never heard of afterward. There is a bare possibility, however, that  President Hopkins might have referred to the fact that Eugene's  grandfather held an A.B. from Williams and the honorary degree of A.M.  from Dartmouth, while his father was an alumnus of Middlebury. It is  more probably an after--and a merry--thought built upon Field's own  unfinished career at Williams, Knox, and the University of Missouri.    From personal inquiry at Williamstown I find that none of the  professors at Williams saw an encouraging gleam of aptitude for  anything in the big-eyed, shambling youth whom Mr. Tufts had  assiduously coached to meet the requirements of matriculation. There is  a shadowy tradition that he did fairly well in his Latin themes when  the subject suited his fancy, but his fancy more often led him to a  sporting resort, kept by an ex-pugilist named Pettit, where he took a  hand in billiards and made awkward essays with the boxing-gloves. Of  course there is the inevitable yarn of a college town that he became so  conceited over his skill in the manly art that he ventured to \"stand  up\" before Pettit, to the bloody disfigurement of his countenance and  the humiliation of his pride. If this is true, the lesson lasted him  all his life, for a less combative adult than Eugene Field never  graduated from an American college. He had a physical as well as a  moral antipathy to personal participation in anything involving bodily  danger or violence.    Even then Field possessed the wit and the plentiful lack of reverence  for the conventionalities of life that must have rendered him both  intolerable and incomprehensible to a body of serious-minded and  necessarily conventional professors. The very traits that subsequently  made him the most entertaining comrade in the world provoked only  consternation and uneasiness at Williams. This eventually led President  Hopkins to inform Mr. Tufts privately that it might be well for his  pupil, as certainly it would conduce to the orderly life of  Williamstown, if he would run up from Monson and persuade Eugene to  return home with him. There was no dismissal, rustication, or official  reprimand of Eugene Field by the ever-honored President Hopkins. Field  simply faded out of the annals and class of 1872, as if he had never  been entered at Williams.    Memories of Eugene Field are not as thick at Williamstown as  blackberries on the Pelham hills. President Carter does not cherish  them kindly because, perhaps, on the occasion of his appointment, Field  gravely discussed his qualifications for the chair once occupied by  Mark Hopkins as resting upon his contribution of \"a small but active  pellet\" to the pharmaceutical equipment of his countrymen, famed for  its efficacy to cure all disorders of mind and body \"while you sleep.\"    \"Hy.\" Walden, much in demand as an expressman, remembers Field as a  somewhat reckless fellow and \"dare-devil,\" and is authority for the  story of Field's discomfiture in the boxing bout with the redoubtable  Pettit.    Old Tom McMahon, who has been a familiar character to the students of  Williams for nearly two generations, has a hazy recollection of the  eccentric Eugene who flitted across the college campus a third of a  century ago. He says that, if he \"remembers right, Mr. Field was not  one of the gentlemen who cared much for his clothes,\" but he \"guessed  he was made careless like, and in some ways he was a fine young man.\"    [Illustration: WILLIAMS COLLEGE BUILDINGS, WILLIAMSTOWN, MASS.]    The most valuable glimpse of Field at Williams is contained in the  following letter written by Solomon B. Griffin, the managing editor of  the Springfield Republican for many years, with whom I have had some  correspondence in respect to the matter referred to therein. He not  only knew Field at Williamstown, but was one of his life-long friends  and warmest admirers.

I suggested    it in the hope that with two sets on hand Gussie might be disposed    to give us the old one....      Remember me in respectful phraseology to the belligerent Marie    Matilde.      Yours as ever,      FIELD.      V      CHICAGO, Thursday evening, September the 16th, 1886.      My dear Fellow:--It is presumed that Ballantyne and his bride    arrived in this city to-day at seven A.M., but up to this hour    (eight P.M.) the bridegroom has not put in an appearance at the    office.      Cowen is threatening to write to you; it occurs to me that he ought    to do something to atone for the vile slanders he has uttered about    you since you went away. Stone kept Reilly busy at writing from two    o'clock yesterday afternoon until twelve last night. Your friend    Werner, advance agent of the McCaul Company, is in town. He inquired    for you to-day.      I have been reading the memoirs of Dolly Madison and am specially    delighted with the letter written by the old Quakeress, Mrs. Hobbs.    It is a beautiful letter, and you must read it at your first    opportunity.      Stone is very much pleased over the result of the County Democratic    Convention, the defeat of Dunphy giving him particular gratification.    Love to all. God bless you, dear boy.      Yours as ever,      FIELD.      Detroit, 0; St. Louis, 0; game called at end of fifth inning.    Chicago walloped Kansas City.      VI      CHICAGO, Saturday, September the 18th, 1886.      This, sweet lad, is the dullest Saturday that has befallen me in    many a year. John and his bride are over at Hooley's Theatre    watching that lachrymose melodrama, \"Alone in London.\" There is    nothing worth seeing at any other house. There is nobody for me to    visit with, so here I sit in this box trying to kill the time. I see    very little of Cowen. A disreputable looking friend of his from the    West is here dead-broke and hunting work; Cowen is feeding and    sleeping him _ad interim_, and I think the fellow has an evil    influence over our friend....      I am, as ever, your friend,      FIELD.      VII      CHICAGO, Sunday, September 19th, 1886.      My dear Old Boy:--This man Reilly whom you have put upon me has just    played upon me the most shamefulest trick I ever heard tell of. He    invited me out to supper and told me he had only eighty cents. He    ordered twenty cents worth and made me scrimp along on sixty cents.    When he came to pay the check he produced a five-dollar bill! I    never felt so humiliated in all my life. I pine for the return of    the sweet friend who seeks not by guile to set limit to my appetite.      My children insisted upon going to bed last night with pieces of    Gussie's wedding cake under their pillows. Dady had the presence of    mind to wake up in the night and eat his piece. He told me this    morning that he dreamed that he was married to Mr. Cowen. Last    evening I wandered down town in a furious rainstorm and tried to    find somebody I knew. Failing in this, I meandered home and went to    bed without saying my prayers, conscious of having spent an ill day.      At the theatre this week: Columbia, \"Pepita\"; McVicker's, Lotta;    Grand, Kate Castleton; Hooley's, \"Private Secretary.\" Dock is trying    to get me to go to the Columbia to-night, but your pale face looms    up in my mind's eye and warns me not to go, or, at least, not to sit    in a box if I do go.      The conclusion of this letter has been sacrificed to the importunity    of some autograph fiend from whose tribe I have had the greatest    difficulty in preserving its fellows.      VIII      CHICAGO, Monday, September the 20th, 1886.      The envious old Dock, who has never had an emotion, an ambition or a    hope beyond a quart bottle of Ike Cook's Imperial, said to me but    just now: \"Why do you waste your time writing to that man Thompson?    He will never thank you for it; he will put up none the more    liberally when he returns.\" Then he added, with a bitter look: \"You    never wrote to me while I was at Springfield!\" Ah, how little he    knows of you, this peevish old glutton who cares for naught above    pandering to his dyspeptic maw! But my writing to you has caused a    great deal of scandal here in the office, and I fear I am seriously    compromised. Cowen has been threatening to denounce me to you, but I    have no fear that he will be able to grant you any time from his    numerous [_a_] hoydens, doxies, and beldames. He threatened me    for the mountenance of an hour this afternoon, but I bade him write    and it pleased him--passing well knew I that he could not missay me    with you.      I am delighted with the result of the game at Detroit to-day--7 to 3    in favor of Chicago! This, I think, insures us the championship.      Miller, our circulator, is very much disturbed because our country    circulation has dropped about 1,000 in less than a fortnight; he has    been hobnobbing with Ballantyne about it to-day. Mr. Stone is still    in Kansas City hunting wild geese.      \"Pepita\" is billed as the joint production of Thompson and Solomon,    and about twenty people have asked me if you were the Thompson    referred to and I have indignantly repudiated the libel, for, maugre    my head, \"Pepita\" is just a little the rottenest thing I ever saw or    heard.      I have not clapped my eyes on any of [_b_] your suburban    friends since you departed. At McVicker's the other evening I found    myself being scrutinized by a buxom country lass who looked as if    she might be the fair unknown from Evanston. Her rueful visage and    the sympathetic glance she bestowed on me seemed to assure me that    she, too, was pining for the grandest of old grands.      My wife has been away for a week, but not a line have I had from    her. It has comforted me a good deal, however, to hear John say that    she looked just about sixteen years of age at the wedding.      I took the Dock out to supper to-night and heaped coals of fire upon    his head. I let him have everything he wanted and I paid the bill    with a flourish that would have reflected credit upon a Roman    conqueror.      I wish you were going to be here day after to-morrow [_c_] to    go with us to the last base-ball game of the season--a postponed    game between the Chicagos and the St. Louis Club. I am to have a    private box on account of being a mascot.      The Dock has just informed me that he has just rung into one of his    editorials the expression \"seismic phenomena,\" and he seems to be as    tickled as Jack Homer was when he pulled an alleged plum out of that    historic pie.      I don't know what you think about it, but this business of writing    with five different colors of ink is queering me at a terrible rate    and I am sure that I would die of softening of the brain if I were    to keep it up any length of time. But I presume to say that your    sceptical little Bessie will think this the most beautiful page she    ever saw. I am sorry, but not surprised, to hear that your passes    failed you on the Canadian Pacific. You should have applied for them    sooner. I have always [_d_] found railway officials the slowest    people in the world, and they are particularly slow when it comes to    the matter of passes. Of course you are having a charming time with    your home folk; well, you deserve it, and I hope you will make the    most of it. Give my love to them all. You see I regard myself as one    of the family. Let me hear from you whenever you feel like writing,    but don't bother about it.      Ever your friend,      EUGENE FIELD.    Small wonder that even Field's patience revolted at the self-imposed  \"business\" of writing this letter in five different colors of ink. The  first page, which ran down to the letter \"a\" in the above, was written  in pale green ink; the second, running to \"b,\" was in black; the third,  running to \"c,\" was in red; and the fourth was a medley of these with  purple, gamboge, and mauve to make the six colors. The fifth page from  \"d\" was completed in plain black.      IX      CHICAGO, Tuesday, September the 21st, 1886.      What you say in your letter, dear chuck, is quite true. The paper    has become fairly disreputable of late. The issue of last Saturday    was as base a specimen of daily journalism as ever was inflicted on    a civilized community. Stone (who has returned from Kansas City)    says he was disgusted with that Saturday issue, but I have heard him    suggest no scheme whereby the dawdling condition of affairs is to be    bettered. The whole staff is demoralized, and I believe that, so far    from getting better, matters and things are steadily going to worse.    The outlook is very discouraging. One sensible thing has been done    in hiring Reilly to do regular work. Under the new arrangement he is    to receive forty dollars a week, which Stone considers a big price    for an editorial writer, but which _I_ regard as too measley    for any use. Still Reilly is satisfied, for he will be able to do,    under the new arrangement, as much work for Rauch (of the State    Board of Health) as he has been doing in the past.      Not a word have I heard from my spouse since she went to St.    Louis--in fact, I have never been informed that she arrived in St.    Louis. I thought she might arrive to-night, and so I went down to    the station and sat around on the trucks and things like a colossal    male statue of Patience. The train was late, and, when it came, it    came without her, of course.      Getting back to the office, I find that Dock has had a de'il of a    time. He had to wait this evening to get some data from Yount for a    political editorial. Yount did not show up until half-past eight;    after he had disgorged the necessary information he left the Dock    cocked and primed for quick work. But the Dock had no sooner got    fairly started--in "]]]
