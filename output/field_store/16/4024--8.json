But it does not appear, either  among the Grecian or Latin tribes in the Later Period of barbarism,  that it became more than a loose league for offensive and defensive  purposes. Of the nature and details of organization of the Grecian  and Latin confederacies our knowledge is limited and imperfect,  because the facts are buried in the obscurity of the traditionary  period. The process of coalescence arises later than the confederacy  in gentile society; but it was a necessary as well as a vital stage  of progress by means of which the nation, the state, and political  society were at last attained. Among the Iroquois tribes it had not  manifested itself.    The valley of Onondaga, as the seat of the central tribe, and the  place where the Council Brand was supposed to be perpetually burning,  was the usual though not the exclusive place for holding the  councils of the confederacy. In ancient times it was summoned to  convene in the autumn of each year but public exigencies often  rendered its meetings more frequent. Each tribe had power to summon  the council, and to appoint the time and place of meeting at the  council house of either tribe, when circumstances rendered a change  from the usual place at Onondaga desirable. But the council had no  power to convene itself.    Originally the principal object of the council was to raise up  sachems to fill vacancies in the ranks of the ruling body occasioned  by death or deposition; but it transacted all other business which  concerned the common welfare. In course of time, as they multiplied  in numbers and their intercourse with foreign tribes became more  extended, the council fell into three distinct kinds, which may be  distinguished as Civil, Mourning, and Religious. The first declared  war and made peace, sent and received embassies, entered into  treaties with foreign tribes, regulated the affairs of subjugated  tribes, and took all needful measures to promote the general welfare.  The second raised up sachems and invested them with office. It  received the name of Mourning Council because the first of its  ceremonies was the lament for the deceased ruler whose vacant place  was to be filled. The third was held for the observance of a general  religious festival. It was made an occasion for the confederated  tribes to unite under the auspices of a general council in the  observance of common religions rites; but as the Mourning Council  was attended with many of the same ceremonies it came in time to  answer for both. It is now the only council they hold, as the civil  powers of the confederacy terminated with the supremacy over them of  the state.    When the sachems met in council at the time and place appointed, and  the usual reception ceremony had been performed, they arranged  themselves in two divisions and seated themselves upon opposite  sides of the council-fire. Upon one side were the Mohawk, Onondaga,  and Seneca sachems. The tribes they represented were, when in council,  brother tribes to each other and father tribes to the other two. In  like manner their sachems were brothers to each other and fathers to  those opposite. They constituted a phratry of tribes and of sachems,  by an extension of the principle which united gentes in a phratry.  On the opposite side of the fire were the Oneida and Cayuga and at a  later day the Tuscarora sachems. The tribes they represented were  brother tribes to each other and son tribes to the opposite three.  Their sachems also were brothers to each other, and sons of those in  the opposite division. They formed a second tribal phratry. As the  Oneidas were a subdivision of the Mohawks, and the Cayugas a  subdivision of the Onondagas or Senecas, they were in reality junior  tribes; whence their relation of seniors and juniors, and the  application of the phratric principle. When the tribes are named in  council the Mohawks, by precedence, are mentioned first. Their  tribal epithet was \"The Shield\" (Da-go-e-o'-do). The Onondagas came  next, under the epithet of \"Name-Bearer\" (Ho-de-san-no'-ge-to),  because they had been appointed to select and name the fifty  original sachems. Next in the order of precedence were the Senecas,  under the epithet of \"Door-Keeper\" (Ho-nan-ne-ho'-ont). They were  made perpetual keepers of the western door of the Long House. The  Oneidas, under the epithet of \"Great Tree\" (Ne-ar'-de-on dar'-go-war),  and the Cayugas, under that of \"Great Pipe\" (So-nus'-ho-gwar-to-war),  were named fourth and fifth. The Tuscaroras, who came late into the  confederacy, were named last, and had no distinguishing epithet.  Forms, such as these, were more important in ancient society than we  would be apt to suppose.    Unanimity among the sachems was required upon all public questions,  and essential to the validity of every public act. It was a  fundamental law of the confederacy. They adopted a method for  ascertaining the opinions of the members of the council which  dispensed with the necessity of casting votes. Moreover, they were  entirely unacquainted with the principle of majorities and  minorities in the action of councils. They voted in council by tribes,  and the sachems of each tribe were required to be of one mind to  form a decision. Recognizing unanimity as a necessary principle, the  founders of the confederacy divided the sachems of each tribe into  classes as a means for its attainment. This will be seen by  consulting the table (supra, p 30). No sachem was allowed to express  an opinion in council in the nature of a vote until he had first  agreed with the sachem or sachems of his class upon the opinion to  be expressed, and had been appointed to act as speaker for the class.  Thus the eight Seneca sachems being in four classes, could have but  four opinions, and the ten Cayuga sachems, being in the same number  of classes, could have but four. In this manner the sachems in each  class were first brought to unanimity among themselves. A  cross-consultation was then held between the four sachems appointed  to speak for the four classes; and when they had agreed they  designated one of their number to express their resulting opinion,  which was the answer of their tribe. When the sachems of the several  tribes had, by this ingenious method, become of one mind separately,  it remained to compare their several opinions, and if they agreed  the decision of the council was made. If they failed of agreement  the measure was defeated and the council was at an end. The five  persons appointed to express the decision of the five tribes may  possibly explain the appointment and the functions of the six  electors, so called, in the Aztec confederacy.    By this method of gaining assent the equality and independence of  the several tribes were recognized and preserved. If any sachem was  obdurate or unreasonable, influences were brought to bear upon him,  through the preponderating sentiment, which he could not well resist,  so that it seldom happened that inconvenience or detriment resulted  from their adherence to the rule. Whenever all efforts to procure  unanimity had failed, the whole matter was laid aside because  further action had become impossible.    Under a confederacy of tribes the office of general, \"Great War  Soldier,\" (Hos-go-o-geh'-da-go-wo), makes its first appearance.  Cases would now arise when the several tribes in their confederate  capacity would be engaged in war, and the necessity for a  general commander to direct the movements of the united bands  would be felt. The introduction of this office as a permanent  feature in the government was a great event in the history of human  progress. It was the beginning of a differentiation of the military  from the civil power, which, when completed, changed essentially the  external manifestation of the government; but even in later stages  of progress, when the military spirit predominated, the essential  character of the government was not changed. Gentilism arrested  usurpation. With the rise of the office of general, the government  was gradually changed from a government of one power into a  government of two powers. The functions of government became, in  course of time, co-ordinated between the two. This new office was  the germ of that of a chief executive magistrate for out of the  general came the king, the emperor, and the president, as elsewhere  suggested. The office sprang from the military necessities of  society and had a logical development.    When the Iroquois confederacy was formed, or soon after that event  two permanent war-chiefships were created and named, and both were  assigned to the Seneca tribe. One of them (Ta-wan'-ne-ars,  signifying needle-breaker) was made hereditary in the Wolf, and the  other (So-no'-so-wo, signifying great oyster shell) in the Turtle  gens. The reason assigned for giving them both to the Senecas was  the greater danger of attack at the west end of their territories.  They were elected in the same manner as the sachems, were raised up  by a general council, and were equal in rank and power. Another  account states that they were created later. They discovered  immediately after the confederacy was formed that the structure of  the Long House was incomplete, because there were no officers to  execute the military commands of the confederacy. A council was  convened to remedy the omission, which established the two perpetual  war-chiefs named. As general commanders they had charge of the  military affairs of the confederacy and the command of its joint  forces when united in a general expedition. Governor Blacksnake,  recently deceased, held the office first named, thus showing that  the succession has been regularly maintained. The creation of two  principal war-chiefs instead of one, and with equal powers, argues a  subtle and calculating policy to prevent the domination of a single  man even in their military affairs. They did without experience  precisely as the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8115"],[0,"Authors of Greece (#11)"],[1,"aius; he was the origin of all the mischief,  obstinately refusing to listen to a warning thrice given him by Apollo.  Another secret of dramatic excellence has been discovered by the poet,  that of contrast. Two brothers and two sisters are balanced in pairs  against one another. The weaker sister Ismene laments the stronger  brother, while the more unfortunate Polyneices is championed by the  more firmly drawn sister. Equally admirable is the contrast between the  righteous Amphiaraus and his godless companions. The character of  each of these is a masterpiece. War, horror, kindred bloodshed, with  a promise of further agonies to arise from Antigone's resolve are the  elements which Aeschylus has fused together in this vivid play.    \"There was war in Heaven\" between the new gods and the old. The  _Prometheus Bound_ contains the story of the proud tyranny of Zeus,  the latest ruler of the gods. Hephaestus, the god of fire, opens a  conversation with Force and Violence who are pinning Prometheus with  chains of adamant to the rocks of Caucasus. Hephaestus performs his task  with reluctance and in pity for the victim, the deep-counselling son  of right-minded Law. Yet the command of Zeus his master is urgent,  overriding the claims of kindred blood. Force and Violence, full of  hatred, hold down the god who has stolen fire, Hephaestus' right, and  given it to men. They bid the Fire-God make the chains fast and drive  the wedge through Prometheus' body. When the work is done they leave him  with the taunt:        \"Now steal the rights of the gods and give them to the creatures      of the day; what can mortals do to relieve thy agonies? The gods      wrongly call thee a far-seeing counsellor, who thyself lackest a      counsellor to save thee from thy present lot.\"    Abandoned of all, Prometheus breaks out into a wild appeal to earth,  air, the myriad laughter of the sea, the founts and streams to witness  his humiliation; but soon he reflects that he had foreseen his agony  and must bear it as best he can, for the might of Necessity is not to  be fought against. A sound of lightly moving pinions strikes his ears;  sympathisers have come to visit him; they are the Chorus, the daughters  of Ocean, who have heard the sound of the riveted chains and hurried  forth in their winged car Awestruck, they come to see how Zeus is  smiting down the mighty gods of old. It would be difficult to imagine a  more natural and touching motive for the entry of a Chorus.    In the dialogue that follows the tragic appeal to pity is quickly  blended with a different interest. By a superb stroke of art Aeschylus  excites the audience to an intense curiosity. Though apparently subdued,  Prometheus has the certainty of ultimate triumph over his foe; he alone  has secret knowledge of something which will one day hurl Zeus from his  throne; the time will come when the new president of Heaven will hurry  to him in anxious desire for reconciliation; when ruin threatens him he  will forsake his pride and beg Prometheus to save him. But no words will  prevail on the sufferer till he is released from his bonds and receives  ample satisfaction for his maltreatment. The Chorus bids him tell the  whole history of the quarrel. To them he unfolds the story of Zeus'  ingratitude. There was a discord among the older gods, some wishing to  depose Cronos and make Zeus their King. Warned by his mother, Prometheus  knew that only counsel could avail in the struggle, not violence. When  he failed to persuade the Titans to use cunning, he joined Zeus who with  his aid hurled his foes down to Tartarus. Securing the sovereignty, Zeus  distributed honours to his supporters, but was anxious to wipe out  the human race and create a new stock. Prometheus resisted him, giving  mortals fire the creator of many arts and ridding them of the dread  of death. This act brought him into conflict with Zeus. He invites the  Chorus to step down from their car and hear the rest of his story. At  this point Ocean enters, one of the older gods. He offers to act as  a mediator with Zeus, but Prometheus warns him to keep out of the  conflict; he has witnessed the sorrows of Atlas, his own brother, and  of Typhos, pinned down under Etna, and desires to bring trouble upon no  other god; he must bear his agonies alone till the time of deliverance  is ripe. Ocean departing, Prometheus continues his story. He gave men  writing and knowledge of astronomy, taught them to tame the wild beasts,  invented the ship, created medicine, divination and metallurgy. Yet for  all this, his art is weaker far than Necessity, whereof the controllers  are Fate and the unforgetting Furies. Terror-struck at his sufferings,  the Chorus point out how utterly his goodness has been wasted in helping  the race of mortals who cannot save him. He warns them that a time  would come when Zeus should be no longer King; when they ask for more  knowledge, he turns them to other thoughts, bidding them hide the secret  as much as possible. Their interest is drawn away to another of Zeus'  victims, who at this moment rushes on the scene; it is lo, cajoled and  abandoned by Zeus, plagued and tormented by the dread unsleeping gadfly  sent by Zeus' consort Hera. She relates her story to the wondering  Chorus, and then Prometheus tells her the long tale of misery and  wandering that await her as she passes from the Caucasus to Egypt, where  she is promised deliverance from her tormentor.    The play now moves to its awful climax. The sight of Io stirs Prometheus  to prophesy more clearly the end in store for Zeus. There would be born  one to discover a terror far greater than the thunderbolt, and smite  Zeus and his brother Poseidon into utter slavery. On hearing this Zeus  sends from heaven his messenger Hermes to demand fuller knowledge of  this new monarch. Disdaining his threats, Prometheus mocks the new  gods and defies their ruler to do his worst. Hermes then delivers his  warning. Prometheus would be overwhelmed with the terrors of thunder and  lightning, while the red eagle would tear out his heart unceasingly till  one should arise to inherit his agonies, descending to the depths of  Tartarus. He advises the Chorus to depart from the rebel, lest they too  should share in the vengeance. They remain faithful to Prometheus, ready  to suffer with him; then descend the thunderings and lightnings, the  mountains rock, the winds roar, and the sky is confounded with sea; the  dread agony has begun.    Once more the bold originality of Aeschylus displays itself. Here is a  theme unique in Greek literature. The strife between the two races of  gods opens out a vista of the world ages before man was created. It will  provide a solution to a very difficult problem which will confront us in  a later play. The conflict between two stubborn wills is the source of a  sublime tragedy in which our sympathies are with the sufferer; Zeus, who  punishes Prometheus for \"unjustly\" helping mortals, himself falls  below the level of human morality; he is tyrannous, ungrateful and  revengeful--in short, he displays all the wrong-headedness of a new  ruler. No doubt in the sequel these defects would have disappeared;  experience would have induced a kindlier temper and the sense of an  impending doom would have made it essential for him to relent in order  to learn the great secret about his successor.    Pathos is repeatedly appealed to in the play. Hephaestus is one of the  kindliest figures in Greek tragedy; the noble-hearted young goddesses  cannot fail to hold our affection. They are the most human Chorus in all  drama; their entry is admirable; in the sequel we should have found  them still near Prometheus after his cycle of tortures. But the  subject-matter is calculated to win the admiration of all humanity; it  is the persecution of him to whom on Greek principles mankind owes all  that it is of value in its civilisation. We cannot help thinking of  another God, racked and tormented and nailed to a cross of shame to save  the race He loved. The very power and majesty of Aeschylus' work has  made it difficult for successors to imitate him; few can hope to equal  his sublime grandeur; Shelley attempted it in his _Prometheus Unbound_,  but his Prometheus becomes abstract Humanity, ceasing to be a character,  while his play is really a mere poem celebrating the inevitable victory  of man over the evils of his environment and picturing the return of an  age of happiness.    Nearly all the characters in Greek tragedy were the heroes of well-known  popular legends. In abandoning the well-trodden circle Aeschylus has  here ensured an undying freshness for his work--it is novel, free and  unconventional; more than that, it is dignified.    The slightest error of taste would have degraded if to the level of  a comedy; throughout it maintains a uniform tone of loftiness and  sincerity. The language is easy but powerful, the art with which the  story is told is consummate. Finally, it is one of the few pieces in the  literature of the world which are truly sublime; it ranks with Job  and Dante. The great purpose of creation, the struggles of beings of  terrific power, the majesty of gods, the whole universe sighing and  lamenting for the agonies of a deity of wondrous foresight, saving  others but not himself--such is the theme of this mighty and affecting  play.    In 458 Aeschylus wrote the one trilogy which is extant. It describes the  murder of Agamemnon, the revenge of Orestes and his purification  from blood-guiltiness. It will be necessary to trace the history  of Agamemnon's family before we can understand these plays. His  great-grandfather was Tantalus, who betrayed the secrets of the gods and  was subjected to unending torture in Hades. Pelops, his son, begat two  sons, Atreus and Thyestes. The former killed Thyestes' son, invited the  father to a banquet and served up his own son's body for him to eat.  The sons of Atreus"]]]
