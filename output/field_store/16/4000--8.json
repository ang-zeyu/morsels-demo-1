Peron did not say that he saw it himself. He  merely recorded that it was seen. Freycinet did not see it himself  either. He was at this time an officer on Le Naturaliste, and was not on  the Terre Napoleon coasts at all until the following year, when he  penetrated St. Vincent's and Spencer's Gulfs. He, without indicating the  time of day, or stating that the port was merely viewed from aloft,  asserted that the entrance was observed, though the ship did not go  inside.    In the first place, the statements of Peron and Freycinet are not in  agreement. To observe the entrance was one thing; to trace the contours  from the masthead quite another. To do the first was quite possible,  though not, as will be shown, from any part of the route indicated on the  track-chart of Le Geographe. But to distinguish the contours of Port  Phillip from outside, over the peninsula, was not possible.    Here, at all events, is a sharp conflict of evidence. We must endeavour  to elicit the truth.    It is certain that Baudin had no motive for concealing his knowledge, if  he knew of the existence of Port Phillip when he met Flinders. Had his  cue been to prefer claims on account of priority of discovery, he would  have been disposed to make his title clear forthwith. Frankness, too, was  an engaging characteristic of Baudin throughout. He was evidently proud  of what his expedition had already done, and was, as Flinders wrote,  \"communicative.\" Had he discovered a new harbour, he would have spoken  about it jubilantly. Moreover, as Flinders explained to him how he could  obtain fresh water at Port Lincoln, a fellow-navigator would surely have  been glad to reciprocate by indicating the whereabouts of a harbour in  which the Investigator might possibly be glad to take shelter on her  eastern course.    It is also clear that Flinders did not misunderstand Baudin. He was an  extremely exact man, and as he said that he was \"particular in detailing  all that passed,\" we may take it that one with whom precision was  something like a passion would be careful not to misunderstand on so  important a point. Brown, too, was with him, a trained man of science,  who would have been quick to correct his chief in the event of a  misapprehension. Flinders so far relied on Baudin's statement that when,  on April 26, he sighted Port Phillip heads himself, he thought he was off  Westernport, which his friend George Bass had discovered in 1798. \"It was  the information of Captain Baudin which induced this supposition,\" he  wrote.* (* See also the entry in his journal, Appendix B.) It was not  till he bore up and took his bearings that he saw that he could not be at  Westernport; and he then congratulated himself on having made \"a new and  useful discovery\"--unaware, of course, that Murray had found Port Phillip  in the Lady Nelson in the previous January.    It must be noted in addition that Baudin wrote a letter to Jussieu, the  distinguished French botanist and member of the Institute, nine months  later, in which he gave an account of his voyage up to date.* (* Printed  in the Moniteur, 22 Fructidor, Revolutionary Year 11. (September 9,  1803).) Therein he said not a word about seeing Port Phillip, nor did he  allude to the possibility of there being a harbour between Westernport  and Encounter Bay.    Baudin, then, knew nothing about Port Phillip when he met Flinders on  April 8. But if somebody else saw it from the masthead on March 30, why  was not the fact reported to the commander? Why was he not asked the  question whether so large a bay should be explored? Again, if Le  Geographe did sight Port Phillip, why did she not enter it? Here was a  magnificent chance for discoverers. They were necessarily unaware of  Murray's good fortune in January. As far as their knowledge could have  gone, the port was absolutely new to geography. If we believe Peron and  Freycinet, surely these were the most negligent explorers who ever sailed  the seas.* (* It is true that Cook did not enter Port Jackson when he  discovered and named it on May 6, 1770. But exploration, it must always  be remembered, was not the primary object of the voyage of the Endeavour,  as it was of Le Geographe. Cook, when he achieved the greatest extent of  maritime discovery made at one time by any navigator in history, was  simply on his way homeward from a visit to Tahiti, the primary purpose of  which was to enable astronomers to observe the transit of Venus. Cook,  too, made a record of the latitude and longitude of Port Jackson. No such  entry was made by the French relative to Port Phillip, as will presently  be shown.) But if we believe that Baudin spoke the truth to Flinders--and  the absence of all reference to the port in his letter to Jussieu is  alone sufficient to show that he did--what shall we say of the statements  of Peron and Freycinet, written after Baudin's death, after they had  learnt of Murray's discovery, and when they had set themselves the task  of making the work of the expedition appear as important as possible?    Now, Baudin's statement is confirmed by five documents, the testimony of  which is convincing.    1. As an appendix to volume 3 of the Voyage de Decouvertes aux Terres  Australes, is printed the entire log of Le Geographe. The entry for March  30, 1802* (* Page 499.) (9th Germinal, Year 10 in the revolutionary  calendar, which is printed parallel with the ordinary dates), is latitude  38 degrees 33 minutes south, longitude 142 degrees 16 minutes east. The  reckoning is from the meridian of Paris, not of Greenwich.) The situation  when the entry was made, presumably at noon, was about midway between  Lorne and Apollo Bay, off the coast leading down in a south-westerly  direction to Cape Otway. The winds were east, east-north-east,  south-east, and east-south-east; weather very fine; a fresh wind blowing  (\"joli frais; beau temps\"). It was the wind which was hindering Flinders,  sailing in the opposite direction. The column for \"Remarques\" opposite  this date was left blank. In other places where anything remarkable was  seen--even such a thing as a striking sunset--it was duly entered in the  proper place. But there was no entry relative to seeing Port Phillip from  the masthead, or observing the entrance, at any time. Baudin is  corroborated by the ship's log.    2. There is also appended to volume 3 of the same work a table of  geographical positions as calculated by the ship's officers. The  situation of Cape Schanck (Cap Richelieu on the French map) and of Ile  des Anglois (Phillip Island) are given; and next in the list comes Cap  Desaix (Cape Otway).* (* Page 544.) There is no record of a latitudinal  and longitudinal reading between these points. That is to say, the  position of Port Phillip is not indicated at all. In this case also the  column for \"Remarques\" is blank. Can we believe that if the port had been  observed, no attempt would have been made to fix the situation of it? The  latitudes and longitudes of some quite unimportant features of the coast  were duly noted. Here was a large bay, and not the slightest reference  was made to it in the table. The inevitable inference is that the French  saw nothing worth recording between Cape Schanck and Cape Otway. Baudin  is corroborated by the table of \"positions geographiques.\"    3. The atlas issued with the first volume of the Voyage de Decouvertes in  1807 contained several coloured plates of views of coasts traversed by Le  Geographe. The work of the artists accompanying the expedition was very  beautiful; some of the plates have rarely been excelled in atlases of  this kind. These coast sketches, like narrow ribbons, prettily tinted,  were done from the deck of the ship, and represented the aspect of the  shore-line from seaward. The coasts of Bass Strait were duly represented,  but there was a gap between the Schanck and the Otway sides of Port  Phillip. Why? Obviously because the ship was not near enough to the coast  to enable the artists to see it clearly. Can we believe that men whose  particular task it was to depict the coasts traversed, would have missed  the picturesque gateway of Port Phillip if they had seen it? Baudin is  corroborated by the atlas.    4. The Moniteur of July 2, 1808, contained a long article by Lieutenant  Henri de Freycinet--elder brother of Louis--reviewing the work of the  expedition, on the occasion of the publication of Peron's first volume.  Now, Henri de Freycinet was Baudin's first lieutenant on Le Geographe. If  Port Phillip was seen from that ship on March 30, he should have seen it  if Baudin did not. If the captain was ill, or asleep, Henri de Freycinet  would be in charge. But in his article, though he described the  discoveries claimed to have been made with particular regard to the  so-called Terre Napoleon coasts, he made no reference to Port Phillip.  Baudin is corroborated by his chief officer.    5. Lastly, when Captain Hamelin returned to Europe with Le Naturaliste in  1803, Bonaparte's official organ, the Moniteur, published an article on  the voyage from information supplied partly by him and partly contained  in despatches.* (* Moniteur, 27 Thermidor, Revolutionary Year 11 (August  15, 1803).) Referring to Baudin's voyage along the \"entierement  inconnues\" southern coasts of Australia, the article said that he first  visited Wilson's Promontory (which it called Cap Wilson), and then  advanced along the coast till he met Captain Flinders. No reference was  made to seeing any port, although if one had been seen by any one on  board Le Geographe, it surely would have been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7452"],[0,"Autobiography of a Yogi (#11)"],[1,"gave the title of MAYA:    Illusion works impenetrable,  Weaving webs innumerable,  Her gay pictures never fail,  Crowd each other, veil on veil,  Charmer who will be believed  By man who thirsts to be deceived.    {FN5-3} The RISHIS, literally \"seers,\" were the authors of the  VEDAS in an indeterminable antiquity..    {FN5-4} Flat, round Indian bread..    {FN5-5} Laymen scarcely realize the vast strides of twentieth-century  science. Transmutation of metals and other alchemical dreams are  seeing fulfillment every day in centers of scientific research over  the world. The eminent French chemist, M. Georges Claude, performed  \"miracles\" at Fontainebleau in 1928 before a scientific assemblage  through his chemical knowledge of oxygen transformations. His  \"magician's wand\" was simple oxygen, bubbling in a tube on a table.  The scientist \"turned a handful of sand into precious stones,  iron into a state resembling melted chocolate and, after depriving  flowers of their tints, turned them into the consistency of glass.    \"M. Claude explained how the sea could be turned by oxygen  transformations into many millions of pounds of horsepower; how  water which boils is not necessarily burning; how little mounds of  sand, by a single whiff of the oxygen blowpipe, could be changed  into sapphires, rubies, and topazes; and he predicted the time when  it will be possible for men to walk on the bottom of the ocean minus  the diver's equipment. Finally the scientist amazed his onlookers  by turning their faces black by taking the red out of the sun's  rays.\"    This noted French scientist has produced liquid air by an expansion  method in which he has been able to separate the various gases of  the air, and has discovered various means of mechanical utilization  of differences of temperature in sea water.        CHAPTER: 6    THE TIGER SWAMI    \"I have discovered the Tiger Swami's address. Let us visit him  tomorrow.\"    This welcome suggestion came from Chandi, one of my high school  friends. I was eager to meet the saint who, in his premonastic  life, had caught and fought tigers with his naked hands. A boyish  enthusiasm over such remarkable feats was strong within me.    The next day dawned wintry cold, but Chandi and I sallied forth  gaily.  After much vain hunting in Bhowanipur, outside Calcutta, we  arrived at the right house. The door held two iron rings, which I  sounded piercingly. Notwithstanding the clamor, a servant approached  with leisurely gait. His ironical smile implied that visitors,  despite their noise, were powerless to disturb the calmness of a  saint's home.    Feeling the silent rebuke, my companion and I were thankful to be  invited into the parlor. Our long wait there caused uncomfortable  misgivings. India's unwritten law for the truth seeker is patience;  a master may purposely make a test of one's eagerness to meet him.  This psychological ruse is freely employed in the West by doctors  and dentists!    Finally summoned by the servant, Chandi and I entered a sleeping  apartment. The famous Sohong {FN6-1} Swami was seated on his bed.  The sight of his tremendous body affected us strangely. With bulging  eyes, we stood speechless. We had never before seen such a chest or  such football-like biceps. On an immense neck, the swami's fierce  yet calm face was adorned with flowing locks, beard and moustache.  A hint of dovelike and tigerlike qualities shone in his dark eyes.  He was unclothed, save for a tiger skin about his muscular waist.    Finding our voices, my friend and I greeted the monk, expressing  our admiration for his prowess in the extraordinary feline arena.    \"Will you not tell us, please, how it is possible to subdue with  bare fists the most ferocious of jungle beasts, the royal Bengals?\"    \"My sons, it is nothing to me to fight tigers. I could do it today  if necessary.\" He gave a childlike laugh. \"You look upon tigers as  tigers; I know them as pussycats.\"    \"Swamiji, I think I could impress my subconsciousness with the  thought that tigers are pussycats, but could I make tigers believe  it?\"    \"Of course strength also is necessary! One cannot expect victory  from a baby who imagines a tiger to be a house cat! Powerful hands  are my sufficient weapon.\"    He asked us to follow him to the patio, where he struck the edge  of a wall. A brick crashed to the floor; the sky peered boldly  through the gaping lost tooth of the wall. I fairly staggered in  astonishment; he who can remove mortared bricks from a solid wall  with one blow, I thought, must surely be able to displace the teeth  of tigers!    \"A number of men have physical power such as mine, but still lack  in cool confidence. Those who are bodily but not mentally stalwart  may find themselves fainting at mere sight of a wild beast bounding  freely in the jungle. The tiger in its natural ferocity and habitat  is vastly different from the opium-fed circus animal!    \"Many a man with herculean strength has nonetheless been terrorized  into abject helplessness before the onslaught of a royal Bengal.  Thus the tiger has converted the man, in his own mind, to a state  as nerveless as the pussycat's. It is possible for a man, owning a  fairly strong body and an immensely strong determination, to turn  the tables on the tiger, and force it to a conviction of pussycat  defenselessness. How often I have done just that!\"    I was quite willing to believe that the titan before me was able to  perform the tiger-pussycat metamorphosis. He seemed in a didactic  mood; Chandi and I listened respectfully.    \"Mind is the wielder of muscles. The force of a hammer blow depends  on the energy applied; the power expressed by a man's bodily instrument  depends on his aggressive will and courage. The body is literally  manufactured and sustained by mind. Through pressure of instincts  from past lives, strengths or weaknesses percolate gradually into  human consciousness. They express as habits, which in turn ossify  into a desirable or an undesirable body. Outward frailty has  mental origin; in a vicious circle, the habit-bound body thwarts  the mind. If the master allows himself to be commanded by a servant,  the latter becomes autocratic; the mind is similarly enslaved by  submitting to bodily dictation.\"    At our entreaty, the impressive swami consented to tell us something  of his own life.    \"My earliest ambition was to fight tigers. My will was mighty, but  my body was feeble.\"    An ejaculation of surprise broke from me. It appeared incredible  that this man, now \"with Atlantean shoulders, fit to bear,\" could  ever have known weakness.    \"It was by indomitable persistency in thoughts of health and  strength that I overcame my handicap. I have every reason to extol  the compelling mental vigor which I found to be the real subduer  of royal Bengals.\"    \"Do you think, revered swami, that I could ever fight tigers?\" This  was the first, and the last, time that the bizarre ambition ever  visited my mind!    \"Yes.\" He was smiling. \"But there are many kinds of tigers; some  roam in jungles of human desires. No spiritual benefit accrues  by knocking beasts unconscious. Rather be victor over the inner  prowlers.\"    \"May we hear, sir, how you changed from a tamer of wild tigers to  a tamer of wild passions?\"    The Tiger Swami fell into silence. Remoteness came into his gaze,  summoning visions of bygone years. I discerned his slight mental  struggle to decide whether to grant my request. Finally he smiled  in acquiescence.    \"When my fame reached a zenith, it brought the intoxication of  pride.  I decided not only to fight tigers but to display them in  various tricks. My ambition was to force savage beasts to behave  like domesticated ones. I began to perform my feats publicly, with  gratifying success.    \"One evening my father entered my room in pensive mood.    \"'Son, I have words of warning. I would save you from coming ills,  produced by the grinding wheels of cause and effect.'    \"'Are you a fatalist, Father? Should superstition be allowed to  discolor the powerful waters or my activities?'    \"'I am no fatalist, son. But I believe in the just law of retribution,  as taught in the holy scriptures. There is resentment against you  in the jungle family; sometime it may act to your cost.'    \"'Father, you astonish me! You well know what tigers are-beautiful  but merciless! Even immediately after an enormous meal of some  hapless creature, a tiger is fired with fresh lust at sight of new  prey. It may be a joyous gazelle, frisking over the jungle grass.  Capturing it and biting an opening in the soft throat, the malevolent  beast tastes only a little of the mutely crying blood, and goes  its wanton way.    \"'Tigers are the most contemptible of the jungle breed! Who knows?  my blows may inject some slight sanity of consideration into their  thick heads. I am headmaster in a forest finishing school, to teach  them gentle manners!    \"'Please, Father, think of me as tiger tamer and never as tiger  killer. How could my good actions bring ill upon me? I beg you not  to impose any command that I change my way of life.'\"    Chandi and I were all attention, understanding the past dilemma.  In India a child does not lightly disobey his parents' wishes.    \"In stoic silence Father listened to my explanation. He followed  it with a disclosure which he uttered gravely.    \"'Son, you compel me to relate an ominous prediction from the lips  of a saint. He approached me yesterday as I sat on the veranda in  my daily meditation.    \"'\"Dear friend, I come with a message for your belligerent son. Let  him cease his savage activities. Otherwise, his next tiger-encounter  shall result in his severe wounds, followed by six months of deathly  sickness. He shall then forsake his former ways and become a monk.\"'    \"This tale did not impress me. I considered that Father had been  the credulous victim of a deluded fanatic.\"    The Tiger Swami made this"]]]
