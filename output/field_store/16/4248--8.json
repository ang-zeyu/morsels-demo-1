And so  the two lives went on side by side, the worldly one--he would have said,  the practical one--often interfering with the life of thought and  discovery, and partly obscuring it, but yet always leaving it paramount  in his own mind. His dearest and most cherished ideas, the thoughts with  which he was most at home and happiest, his deepest and truest  ambitions, were those of an enthusiastic and romantic believer in a  great discovery just within his grasp. They were such as the dreams and  visions of his great Franciscan namesake, and of the imaginative seekers  after knowledge in the middle ages, real or mythical, Albert the Great,  Cornelius Agrippa, Dr. Faustus; they were the eager, undoubting hopes of  the physical students in Italy and England in his own time, Giordano  Bruno, Telesio, Campanella, Gilbert, Galileo, or the founders of the  Italian prototype of \"Solomon's House\" in the _New Atlantis_, the  precursor of our Royal Societies, the Academy of the _Lincei_ at Rome.  Among these meditations was his inner life. But however he may have  originally planned his course, and though at times under the influence  of disappointment he threatened to retire to Cambridge or to travel  abroad, he had bound himself fast to public life, and soon ceased to  think of quitting it. And he had a real taste for it--for its shows, its  prizes, for the laws and turns of the game, for its debates and  vicissitudes. He was no mere idealist or recluse to undervalue or  despise the real grandeur of the world. He took the keenest interest in  the nature and ways of mankind; he liked to observe, to generalise in  shrewd and sometimes cynical epigrams. He liked to apply his powerful  and fertile intellect to the practical problems of society and  government, to their curious anomalies, to their paradoxical phenomena;  he liked to address himself, either as an expounder or a reformer, to  the principles and entanglements of English law; he aspired, both as a  lecturer and a legislator, to improve and simplify it. It was not beyond  his hopes to shape a policy, to improve administration, to become  powerful by bringing his sagacity and largeness of thought to the  service of the State, in reconciling conflicting forces, in mediating  between jealous parties and dangerous claims. And he liked to enter into  the humours of a Court; to devote his brilliant imagination and  affluence of invention either to devising a pageant which should throw  all others into the shade, or a compromise which should get great  persons out of some difficulty of temper or pique.    In all these things he was as industrious, as laborious, as calmly  persevering and tenacious, as he was in his pursuit of his philosophical  speculations. He was a compound of the most adventurous and most  diversified ambition, with a placid and patient temper, such as we  commonly associate with moderate desires and the love of retirement and  an easy life. To imagine and dare anything, and never to let go the  object of his pursuit, is one side of him; on the other he is  obsequiously desirous to please and fearful of giving offence, the  humblest and most grateful and also the most importunate of suitors,  ready to bide his time with an even cheerfulness of spirit, which yet it  was not safe to provoke by ill offices and the wish to thwart him. He  never misses a chance of proffering his services; he never lets pass an  opportunity of recommending himself to those who could help him. He is  so bent on natural knowledge that we have a sense of incongruity when we  see him engaging in politics as if he had no other interest. He throws  himself with such zest into the language of the moralist, the  theologian, the historian, that we forget we have before us the author  of a new departure in physical inquiry, and the unwearied compiler of  tables of natural history. When he is a lawyer, he seems only a lawyer.  If he had not been the author of the _Instauratio_, his life would not  have looked very different from that of any other of the shrewd and  supple lawyers who hung on to the Tudor and Stuart Courts, and who  unscrupulously pushed their way to preferment. He claimed to be, in  spite of the misgivings of Elizabeth and her ministers, as devoted to  public work and as capable of it as any of them. He was ready for  anything, for any amount of business, ready, as in everything, to take  infinite trouble about it. The law, if he did not like it, was yet no  by-work with him; he was as truly ambitious as the men with whom he  maintained so keen and for long so unsuccessful a rivalry. He felt  bitterly the disappointment of seeing men like Coke and Fleming and  Doddridge and Hobart pass before him; he could not, if he had been only  a lawyer, have coveted more eagerly the places, refused to him, which  they got; only, he had besides a whole train of purposes, an inner and  supreme ambition, of which they knew nothing. And with all this there is  no apparent consciousness of these manifold and varied interests. He  never affected to conceal from himself his superiority to other men in  his aims and in the grasp of his intelligence. But there is no trace  that he prided himself on the variety and versatility of these powers,  or that he even distinctly realized to himself that it was anything  remarkable that he should have so many dissimilar objects and be able so  readily to pursue them in such different directions.    It is doubtful whether, as long as Elizabeth lived, Bacon could ever  have risen above his position among the \"Learned Counsel,\" an office  without patent or salary or regular employment. She used, him, and he  was willing to be used; but he plainly did not appear in her eyes to be  the kind of man who would suit her in the more prominent posts of her  Government. Unusual and original ability is apt, till it is generally  recognised, to carry with it suspicion and mistrust as to its being  really all that it seems to be. Perhaps she thought of the possibility  of his flying out unexpectedly at some inconvenient pinch, and  attempting to serve her interests, not in her way, but in his own;  perhaps she distrusted in business and state affairs so brilliant a  discourser, whose heart was known, first and above all, to be set on  great dreams of knowledge; perhaps those interviews with her in which he  describes the counsels which he laid before her, and in which his  shrewdness and foresight are conspicuous, may not have been so welcome  to her as he imagined; perhaps, it is not impossible, that he may have  been too compliant for her capricious taste, and too visibly anxious to  please. Perhaps, too, she could not forget, in spite of what had  happened, that he had been the friend, and not the very generous friend,  of Essex. But, except as to a share of the forfeitures, with which he  was not satisfied, his fortunes did not rise under Elizabeth.    Whatever may have been the Queen's feelings towards him, there is no  doubt that one powerful influence, which lasted into the reign of James,  was steadily adverse to his advancement. Burghley had been strangely  niggardly in what he did to help his brilliant nephew; he was going off  the scene, and probably did not care to trouble himself about a younger  and uncongenial aspirant to service. But his place was taken by his son,  Robert Cecil; and Cecil might naturally have been expected to welcome  the co-operation of one of his own family who was foremost among the  rising men of Cecil's own generation, and who certainly was most  desirous to do him service. But it is plain that he early made up his  mind to keep Bacon in the background. It is easy to imagine reasons,  though the apparent short-sightedness of the policy may surprise us; but  Cecil was too reticent and self-controlled a man to let his reasons  appear, and his words, in answer to his cousin's applications for his  assistance, were always kind, encouraging, and vague. But we must judge  by the event, and that makes it clear that Cecil did not care to see  Bacon in high position. Nothing can account for Bacon's strange failure  for so long a time to reach his due place in the public service but the  secret hostility, whatever may have been the cause, of Cecil.    There was also another difficulty. Coke was the great lawyer of the day,  a man whom the Government could not dispense with, and whom it was  dangerous to offend. And Coke thoroughly disliked Bacon. He thought  lightly of his law, and he despised his refinement and his passion for  knowledge. He cannot but have resented the impertinence, as he must have  thought it, of Bacon having been for a whole year his rival for office.  It is possible that if people then agreed with Mr. Spedding's opinion as  to the management of Essex's trial, he may have been irritated by  jealousy; but a couple of months after the trial (April 29, 1601) Bacon  sent to Cecil, with a letter of complaint, the following account of a  scene in Court between Coke and himself:           \"_A true remembrance of the abuse I received of Mr.       Attorney-General publicly in the Exchequer the first day of term;       for the truth whereof I refer myself to all that were present._         \"I moved to have a reseizure of the lands of Geo. Moore, a relapsed       recusant, a fugitive and a practising traytor; and showed better       matter for the Queen against the discharge by plea, which is ever       with a _salvo jure_. And this I did in as gentle and reasonable       terms as might be.         \"Mr. Attorney kindled at it, and said, '_Mr. Bacon, if you have any       tooth against me pluck it out; for it will do you more hurt than       all the teeth in your head will do you good._' I answered coldly in       these very words: '_Mr. Attorney, I respect you; I fear you not;       and the less you speak of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13893"],[0,"Compilation of the Messages and Papers of the Presidents: William McKinley; (#12)"],[1,"thing has not been done since Cushing blew up the _Albemarle_.      The members of the crew who were with Mr. Hobson on this memorable  occasion have already been rewarded for their services by advancement,  which, under the provisions of law and regulations, the Secretary of the  Navy was authorized to make; and the nomination to the Senate of Naval  Cadet Powell, who in a steam launch followed the _Merrimac_ on her  perilous trip for the purpose of rescuing her force after the sinking of  that vessel, to be advanced in rank to the grade of ensign has been  prepared and will be submitted.    Cushing, with whose gallant act in blowing up the ram _Albemarle_  during the Civil War Admiral Sampson compares Mr. Hobson's sinking of  the _Merrimac_, received the thanks of Congress, upon recommendation  of the President, by name, and was in consequence, under the provisions  of section 1508 of the Revised Statutes, advanced one grade, such  advancement embracing 56 numbers. The section cited applies, however, to  line officers only, and Mr. Hobson, being a member of the staff of the  Navy, could not under its provisions be so advanced.    In considering the question of suitably rewarding Assistant Naval  Constructor Hobson for his valiant conduct on the occasion referred  to, I have deemed it proper to address this message to you with the  recommendation that he receive the thanks of Congress and, further, that  he be transferred to the line of the Navy and promoted to such position  therein as the President, by and with the advice and consent of the  Senate, may determine. Mr. Hobson's transfer from the construction  corps to the line is fully warranted, he having received the necessary  technical training as a graduate of the Naval Academy, where he stood  No. 1 in his class; and such action is recommended partly in deference  to what is understood to be his own desire, although, he being now a  prisoner in the hands of the enemy, no direct communication on the  subject has been received from him, and partly for the reason that the  abilities displayed by him at Santiago are of such a character as to  indicate especial fitness for the duties of the line.    WILLIAM McKINLEY.          SECOND ANNUAL MESSAGE.    EXECUTIVE MANSION, _December 5, 1898_.    _To the Senate and House of Representatives:_    Notwithstanding the added burdens rendered necessary by the war, our  people rejoice in a very satisfactory and steadily increasing degree of  prosperity, evidenced by the largest volume of business ever recorded.  Manufacture has been productive, agricultural pursuits have yielded  abundant returns, labor in all fields of industry is better rewarded,  revenue legislation passed by the present Congress has increased the  Treasury's receipts to the amount estimated by its authors, the finances  of the Government have been successfully administered and its credit  advanced to the first rank, while its currency has been maintained at  the world's highest standard. Military service under a common flag and  for a righteous cause has strengthened the national spirit and served to  cement more closely than ever the fraternal bonds between every section  of the country.    A review of the relation of the United States to other powers, always  appropriate, is this year of primary importance in view of the momentous  issues which have arisen, demanding in one instance the ultimate  determination by arms and involving far-reaching consequences which will  require the earnest attention of the Congress.    In my last annual message[12] very full consideration was given to the  question of the duty of the Government of the United States toward Spain  and the Cuban insurrection as being by far the most important problem  with which we were then called upon to deal. The considerations then  advanced and the exposition of the views therein expressed disclosed  my sense of the extreme gravity of the situation. Setting aside as  logically unfounded or practically inadmissible the recognition of the  Cuban insurgents as belligerents, the recognition of the independence  of Cuba, neutral intervention to end the war by imposing a rational  compromise between the contestants, intervention in favor of one or the  other party, and forcible annexation of the island, I concluded it was  honestly due to our friendly relations with Spain that she should be  given a reasonable chance to realize her expectations of reform to which  she had become irrevocably committed. Within a few weeks previously she  had announced comprehensive plans which it was confidently asserted  would be efficacious to remedy the evils so deeply affecting our own  country, so injurious to the true interests of the mother country as  well as to those of Cuba, and so repugnant to the universal sentiment  of humanity.    The ensuing month brought little sign of real progress toward the  pacification of Cuba. The autonomous administrations set up in the  capital and some of the principal cities appeared not to gain the favor  of the inhabitants nor to be able to extend their influence to the large  extent of territory held by the insurgents, while the military arm,  obviously unable to cope with the still active rebellion, continued many  of the most objectionable and offensive policies of the government that  had preceded it. No tangible relief was afforded the vast numbers of  unhappy reconcentrados, despite the reiterated professions made in that  regard and the amount appropriated by Spain to that end. The proffered  expedient of zones of cultivation proved illusory. Indeed no less  practical nor more delusive promises of succor could well have been  tendered to the exhausted and destitute people, stripped of all that  made life and home dear and herded in a strange region among  unsympathetic strangers hardly less necessitous than themselves.    By the end of December the mortality among them had frightfully  increased. Conservative estimates from Spanish sources placed the deaths  among these distressed people at over 40 per cent from the time General  Weyler's decree of reconcentration was enforced. With the acquiescence  of the Spanish authorities, a scheme was adopted for relief by  charitable contributions raised in this country and distributed, under  the direction of the consul-general and the several consuls, by noble  and earnest individual effort through the organized agencies of the  American Red Cross. Thousands of lives were thus saved, but many  thousands more were inaccessible to such forms of aid.    The war continued on the old footing, without comprehensive plan,  developing only the same spasmodic encounters, barren of strategic  result, that had marked the course of the earlier ten years' rebellion  as well as the present insurrection from its start. No alternative save  physical exhaustion of either combatant, and therewithal the practical  ruin of the island, lay in sight, but how far distant no one could  venture to conjecture.    At this juncture, on the 15th of February last, occurred the destruction  of the battle ship _Maine_ while rightfully lying in the harbor of  Havana on a mission of international courtesy and good will--a  catastrophe the suspicious nature and horror of which stirred the  nation's heart profoundly. It is a striking evidence of the poise and  sturdy good sense distinguishing our national character that this  shocking blow, falling upon a generous people already deeply touched by  preceding events in Cuba, did not move them to an instant desperate  resolve to tolerate no longer the existence of a condition of danger and  disorder at our doors that made possible such a deed, by whomsoever  wrought. Yet the instinct of justice prevailed, and the nation anxiously  awaited the result of the searching investigation at once set on foot.  The finding of the naval board of inquiry established that the origin of  the explosion was external, by a submarine mine, and only halted through  lack of positive testimony to fix the responsibility of its authorship.    All these things carried conviction to the most thoughtful, even before  the finding of the naval court, that a crisis in our relations with  Spain and toward Cuba was at hand. So strong was this belief that it  needed but a brief Executive suggestion to the Congress to receive  immediate answer to the duty of making instant provision for the  possible and perhaps speedily probable emergency of war, and the  remarkable, almost unique, spectacle was presented of a unanimous vote  of both Houses, on the 9th of March, appropriating $50,000,000 \"for the  national defense and for each and every purpose connected therewith,  to be expended at the discretion of the President.\" That this act of  prevision came none too soon was disclosed when the application of the  fund was undertaken. Our coasts were practically undefended. Our Navy  needed large provision for increased ammunition and supplies, and even  numbers to cope with any sudden attack from the navy of Spain, which  comprised modern vessels of the highest type of continental perfection.  Our Army also required enlargement of men and munitions. The details  of the hurried preparation for the dreaded contingency are told in the  reports of the Secretaries of War and of the Navy, and need not be  repeated here. It is sufficient to say that the outbreak of war when  it did come found our nation not unprepared to meet the conflict.    Nor was the apprehension of coming strife confined to our own country.  It was felt by the continental powers, which on April 6, through their  ambassadors and envoys, addressed to the Executive an expression of hope  that humanity and moderation might mark the course of this Government  and people, and that further negotiations would lead to an agreement  which, while securing the maintenance of peace, would afford all  necessary guaranties for the reestablishment of order in Cuba.
