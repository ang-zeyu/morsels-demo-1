On every side enveloping the earth he transcended [it]  by a space of ten fingers....He formed those aerial creatures, and  the animals, both wild and tame [Footnote ref 1],\" etc. Even that  famous hymn (R.V.x. 129) which begins with \"There was then neither  being nor non-being, there was no air nor sky above\" ends with saying  \"From whence this creation came into being, whether it was  created or not--he who is in the highest sky, its ruler, probably  knows or does not know.\"    In the Upani@sads however, the position is entirely changed,  and the centre of interest there is not in a creator from outside  but in the self: the natural development of the monotheistic position  of the Vedas could have grown into some form of developed  theism, but not into the doctrine that the self was the only reality  and that everything else was far below it. There is no relation  here of the worshipper and the worshipped and no prayers are  offered to it, but the whole quest is of the highest truth, and the true  self of man is discovered as the greatest reality. This change of  philosophical position seems to me to be a matter of great interest.  This change of the mind from the objective to the subjective does  not carry with it in the Upani@sads any elaborate philosophical  discussions, or subtle analysis of mind. It comes there as a matter  of direct perception, and the conviction with which the truth has  been grasped cannot fail to impress the readers. That out of the  apparently meaningless speculations of the Brahma@nas this doctrine  could have developed, might indeed appear to be too improbable  to be believed.    On the strength of the stories of Balaki Ga'rgya and Ajatas'atru  (B@rh. II. i), S'vetaketu and Pravaha@na Jaibali (Cha. V. 3 and B@rh.  VI. 2) and Aru@ni and As'vapati Kaikeya (Cha. V. 11) Garbe thinks  \"that it can be proven that the Brahman's profoundest wisdom, the  doctrine of All-one, which has exercised an unmistakable influence  on the intellectual life even of our time, did not have its origin  in the circle of Brahmans at all [Footnote ref 2]\" and that \"it took  its rise in the ranks of the warrior caste [Footnote ref 3].\" This  if true would of course lead the development of the Upani@sads away  from the influence of the Veda, Brahma@nas and the Ara@nyakas. But do  the facts prove this? Let us briefly examine the evidences that Garbe  himself    ___________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: Muir's _Sanskrit Texts_, vol. v. pp. 368, 371.]    [Footnote 2: Garbe's article, \"_Hindu Monism_,\" p. 68.]    [Footnote 3: _Ibid._ p. 78.    34    self has produced. In the story of Balaki Gargya and Ajatas'atru  (B@rh. II. 1) referred to by him, Balaki Gargya is a boastful man  who wants to teach the K@sattriya Ajatas'atru the true Brahman,  but fails and then wants it to be taught by him. To this  Ajatas'atru replies (following Garbe's own translation) \"it is  contrary to the natural order that a Brahman receive instruction  from a warrior and expect the latter to declare the Brahman to  him [Footnote ref l].\" Does this not imply that in the natural order of  things a Brahmin always taught the knowledge of Brahman to the  K@sattriyas, and that it was unusual to find a Brahmin asking a  K@sattriya about the true knowledge of Brahman? At the beginning  of the conversation, Ajatas'atru had promised to pay Balaki one  thousand coins if he could tell him about Brahman, since all people  used to run to Janaka to speak about Brahman [Footnote ref 2]. The  second story of S'vetaketu and Pravaha@na Jaibali seems to be fairly  conclusive with regard to the fact that the transmigration doctrines,  the way of the gods (_devayana_) and the way of the fathers  (_pit@ryana_) had originated among the K@sattriyas, but it is without  any relevancy with regard to the origin of the superior knowledge  of Brahman as the true self.    The third story of Aru@ni and As'vapati Kaikeya (Cha. V. 11)  is hardly more convincing, for here five Brahmins wishing to  know what the Brahman and the self were, went to Uddalaka  Aru@ni; but as he did not know sufficiently about it he accompanied  them to the K@sattriya king As'vapati Kaikeya who was studying  the subject. But As'vapati ends the conversation by giving them  certain instructions about the fire doctrine (_vaisvanara agni_) and  the import of its sacrifices. He does not say anything about the  true self as Brahman. We ought also to consider that there are  only the few exceptional cases where K@sattriya kings were instructing  the Brahmins. But in all other cases the Brahmins were  discussing and instructing the atman knowledge. I am thus led  to think that Garbe owing to his bitterness of feeling against the  Brahmins as expressed in the earlier part of the essay had been  too hasty in his judgment. The opinion of Garbe seems to have  been shared to some extent by Winternitz also, and the references  given by him to the Upani@sad passages are also the same as we    ____________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: Garbe's article, \"_Hindu Monism_,\" p. 74.]    [Footnote 2: B@rh. II., compare also B@rh. IV. 3, how Yajnavalkya  speaks to Janaka about the _brahmavidya_.]    35    just examined [Footnote ref 1]. The truth seems to me to be this, that  the K@sattriyas and even some women took interest in the  religio-philosophical quest manifested in the Upani@sads. The enquirers  were so eager that either in receiving the instruction of Brahman  or in imparting it to others, they had no considerations of sex and  birth [Footnote ref 2]; and there seems to be no definite evidence for  thinking that the Upani@sad philosophy originated among the K@sattriyas  or that the germs of its growth could not be traced in the  Brahma@nas and the Ara@nyakas which were the productions of  the Brahmins.    The change of the Brahma@na into the Ara@nyaka thought is  signified by a transference of values from the actual sacrifices to  their symbolic representations and meditations which were regarded  as being productive of various earthly benefits. Thus we  find in the B@rhadara@nyaka (I.1) that instead of a horse sacrifice  the visible universe is to be conceived as a horse and meditated  upon as such. The dawn is the head of the horse, the sun is the  eye, wind is its life, fire is its mouth and the year is its soul,  and so on. What is the horse that grazes in the field and to what good  can its sacrifice lead? This moving universe is the horse which is  most significant to the mind, and the meditation of it as such is  the most suitable substitute of the sacrifice of the horse, the mere  animal. Thought-activity as meditation, is here taking the place  of an external worship in the form of sacrifices. The material  substances and the most elaborate and accurate sacrificial rituals  lost their value and bare meditations took their place. Side  by side with the ritualistic sacrifices of the generality of the  Brahmins, was springing up a system where thinking and symbolic  meditations were taking the place of gross matter and  action involved in sacrifices. These symbols were not only  chosen from the external world as the sun, the wind, etc., from  the body of man, his various vital functions and the senses, but  even arbitrary alphabets were taken up and it was believed that  the meditation of these as the highest and the greatest was productive  of great beneficial results. Sacrifice in itself was losing  value in the eyes of these men and diverse mystical significances  and imports were beginning to be considered as their real truth  [Footnote ref 3].    _______________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: Winternitz's _Geschichte der indischen Litteratur_, I.  pp. 197 ff.]    [Footnote 2: The story of Maitryi and Yajnavalikya (B@rh. II. 4)  and that of Satyakama son of Jabala and his teacher (Cha. IV. 4).]    [Footnote 3: Cha. V. II.]    36    The Uktha (verse) of @Rg-Veda was identified in the Aitareya  Ara@nyaka under several allegorical forms with the Pra@na [Footnote  ref 1], the Udgitha of the Samaveda was identified with Om, Pra@na,  sun and eye; in Chandogya II. the Saman was identified with Om, rain,  water, seasons, Pra@na, etc., in Chandogya III. 16-17 man was  identified with sacrifice; his hunger, thirst, sorrow, with initiation;  laughing, eating, etc., with the utterance of the Mantras;  and asceticism, gift, sincerity, restraint from injury, truth, with  sacrificial fees (_dak@si@na_). The gifted mind of these cultured Vedic  Indians was anxious to come to some unity, but logical precision  of thought had not developed, and as a result of that we find in the  Ara@nyakas the most grotesque and fanciful unifications of things  which to our eyes have little or no connection. Any kind of  instrumentality in producing an effect was often considered as pure  identity. Thus in Ait. Ara@n. II. 1. 3 we find \"Then comes the origin  of food. The seed of Prajapati are the gods. The seed of the gods  is rain. The seed of rain is herbs. The seed of herbs is food. The  seed of food is seed. The seed of seed is creatures. The seed of  creatures is the heart. The seed of the heart is the mind. The seed  of the mind is speech. The seed of speech is action. The act done  is this man the abode of Brahman [Footnote ref 2].\"    The word Brahman according to Saya@na meant mantras  (magical verses), the ceremonies, the hot@r priest, the great.  Hillebrandt points out that it is spoken of in R.V. as being new,  \"as not having hitherto existed,\" and as \"coming into being from  the fathers.\" It originates from the seat of the @Rta, springs forth  at the sound of the sacrifice, begins really to exist when the soma  juice is pressed and the hymns are recited at the savana rite,  endures"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12975"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science — Volume 1, No. (#12)"],[1,"from Dumiger's memory when the  hope of fame and the prospect of success were mentioned. His whole  countenance changed, his eye brightened, and the nostril dilated.    \"You heard that, also, your Excellency!\" he said. \"Well, then, I need  not scruple to tell you the truth. Yes, I have labored night and day,  and I hope to obtain the reward of all this self-sacrifice; and now I  draw near the goal my blood is excited--I am fevered by my hopes. Look  here, sir,\" and forgeting all his fears and etiquettes, he took the  Count by the arm and led him to a curtain which was drawn across a  corner of the room where the model-clock was placed. \"Here is the  work; it approaches completion; is it not worthy of the prize?\"    Even to the most unpracticed eye this model of a great work appeared  to be of admirable skill. So complicated was the machinery, that the  marvel seemed to be how it was possible so nicely to have arranged  its various parts, that they could find sufficient space for working.  Massive weights were regulated by springs of such fine texture, that  it was surprising how they could possibly have been made by a man's  rude hand. The movement was perfectly noiseless, so beautifully were  the balances arranged around the principal works of the clock itself:  the heavenly bodies were moving in harmony and regularity; the face  of the clock had not yet been affixed, so the whole of the interior  operations of the machinery were apparent. The Count gazed astonished  at the result of long perseverance and indomitable energy. Dumiger  stood beside him holding the massive curtain aside, and delighting in  the Count's amazement. At length he allowed it to fall, exclaiming,  with pardonable self-love, \"Surely this must succeed!\"    The Count resumed his seat, and, for some time, was unable to regain  the composure which he had lost by the sight which he had seen.  Dumiger sat buried in thought.    \"And when you have succeeded, Dumiger,\" said the Count, in a voice  which he intended to be very kind, but whose inflection manifested  a bitter disappointment,--\"and when you have succeeded, will you be  happier? Do you think, Dumiger, that greatness adds to happiness? Ah,  you know little of the world if you believe this. Besides, remember,  you may fail, and then how bitter your disappointment will be!\"    Dumiger was seated with his arms folded, and scarcely paying any  attention to the Count's observations: his mind was wandering amid the  planets.    \"Look, Dumiger, you are attached to Marguerite.\"    At the name of Marguerite, Dumiger raised his head and concentrated  all his attention.    \"You love her better than all the world?\"    \"Far better,\" said Dumiger.    \"For her, like a man of heart, you would sacrifice everything!\"  continued the wily Count.    Dumiger nodded his head in assent.    \"Even the clock?\"    A glow mantled over Dumiger's cheek; he was about to answer in the  affirmative, when he remembered that the clock had been his companion  for five years past. He had lived with it, breathed his own life  into its movements,--should he renounce the clock? It, as well as  Marguerite, had become a part of himself; it had long stood him in  the place of family, of love, of all those enjoyments which youth so  wantonly and earnestly clings to. The results of success, ambition,  honors, wealth,--all this he would give up for Marguerite; but his  clock--he hesitated.    The Count repeated the question.    At that moment a sweet voice might be heard caroling one of those  simple national airs which are dear to all nations and all times.  Marguerite had a soft, winning voice, well adapted to the song she was  singing. The Count, as well as Dumiger, paused in his conversation;  the color rose again to Dumiger's face as he thought how nearly he was  on the point of sacrificing his faith, and loving the work of his own  hands more than the admirable work of Nature which had been bestowed  upon him, and, as he listened, he lowered his voice and said,--    \"For her I would sacrifice even the clock!\"    \"You shall,\" exclaimed the Count.    \"I shall!\" said Dumiger, starting from his seat. \"Now in what way do  you mean, my Lord Count?\"    \"You know,\" said the Count, \"the value of the prize which is offered  by the town. It is worth little in money. The honor is considered  sufficient. Then you are to be given high place amongst the good  citizens, a laurel crown, to ride a white horse, and sundry other  trumperies.\"    The Count looked at Dumiger while he applied the word trumperies to  those results which the latter had so impatiently striven for,--for  which he had been laboring night and day. These outward signs of the  results of great ambition,--these to be called trumperies! Dumiger  looked at the Count with astonishment.    \"And yet,\" said he, \"it is for such trumperies men sacrifice their  lives, sometimes their characters.\"    The old Count colored slightly as he gave a glance at the riband and  star which he wore. Men did sometimes say that the Grand Master had  not obtained all his honors without sundry sacrifices of one kind and  another. Dumiger had not intended any allusion to these rumors, and  he was surprised at the Count's change of color, for which, at the  moment, he was unable to assign a reason.    \"Well,\" said the Count hesitatingly, \"as you say you prefer  Marguerite's love even to your ambition, let us suppose, that in  one moment you were able to attain certain wealth, to place her in a  position worthy of her high qualities, to be at once on an equality  with those of her fellow-citizens, who have hitherto--pardon me  the word--treated her as an inferior; let us suppose that by some  extraordinary powers all this could be immediately realized;--then let  me ask you, would you sacrifice your clock?\"    Dumiger marveled as he listened. He pictured Marguerite adorned with  all those incidents which lend a new charm even to beauty like hers.  He thought, with that vanity which clings to all men,--he thought if  she were so much admired in her rustic dress, what would she be if she  could rival in luxury and grace the chief ladies of Dantzic? He looked  round the room; and instead of the rudely-carved, worn-out chairs, he  pictured the most graceful and luxurious sofas; instead of two small,  and, in spite of all Marguerite's taste and exertion, rather dusty and  ungraceful-looking rooms, a suite of magnificent apartments, where  he could gratify every taste and find people willing to come and  applaud it. All this passed through his mind, and he did not perceive  how curiously the Count was regarding him; but at last Dumiger was  recalled to himself, and he thought how little occasion there was for  him to draw such pictures, as they could never be realized; and why  should he annoy himself by considering this proposition, which could  only be made to him in joke.    \"But why,\" he said to the count, \"do you make me such a suggestion,  when I can never hope to obtain this?\"    The Count paused a moment, as though to examine Dumiger's countenance  still more attentively, and then said,--    \"You shall obtain this wealth, and much more.\"    \"I!\" exclaimed Dumiger, with astonishment.    \"Yes,\" said the Count; \"at a great price, I know; at a price, however,  which I think you will still be willing to pay for it--for your  clock.\"    \"My clock worth that!\" said Dumiger, \"who will give it to me?\"    It was the first time that Dumiger had tested, by the opinion of  another, the value of the great work which he had achieved, and it  gratified him to hear the magnificent offer.    \"I,\" said the Count, \"I will give you all that I have said; nay, more,  I will use all my influence to have you placed high on the great book  of the citizens. You shall have everything to make life happy. Give me  the clock; sign me a paper, making over this clock to me; declaring,  at the same time, that it is your free act and deed, and that you  never completed it, and I will immediately settle that fortune upon  you.\"    \"And yet my clock,\" thought Dumiger; \"all the honors I have  anticipated, the gratification of my ambition, that greatness I have  dreamed of; can I forget all this?\"    He was about to reply, when the door opened and Marguerite entered.  The length of time that the conversation lasted had made her  impatient; besides, she mistrusted the Count.    He looked annoyed at her appearance, for he imagined that Dumiger was  on the point of acceding to his terms.    \"Marguerite, I am so rejoiced you have come!\" exclaimed Dumiger, as  though a sudden light had burst upon him. \"The Lord Count has offered  to buy my clock, and to make us rich beyond all expectation; to have  us placed high among the first class of the citizens; in fact to  enable us at once to secure all that men pass their lifetimes in  striving to attain, if I will give up my clock and declare that I  failed in its execution. What do you say, Marguerite?\"    \"What do I say!\" she exclaimed, and as she spoke she drew herself  up to her full height, her brow contracted, the color glowed in her  cheek. \"And did you hesitate what reply to make?\"    \"I thought of you, Marguerite.\"    \"Of me!\" she replied. \"Oh, do not think of me; or rather if you do so,  think that I would sooner live in the most abject poverty, and suffer  any amount of privation, than part with the work, the consummation  of which will be the glory of your life. Part with your clock! no, I  would sooner sell this hair which you so prize, part with all those  qualities which render me dear to you; nay more, I think I would even  be content to sacrifice your love rather than see all the results of  your patient industry wasted, your noble ambition sacrificed. Think  of me, dear Dumiger, but think of me only as a part of yourself, as  one who would give up every hope and every future to secure your  happiness, that is, your fame.\"    Dumiger rose from his seat, unmindful in whose"]]]
