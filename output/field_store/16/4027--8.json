Cxiuj sanktuloj, helpu!                                     LESSON 26.    The following words, which have already been used in the previous  lessons, are always placed before nouns or pronouns, to show the  relation (of position, etc.) between the thing for which the noun stands  and another thing or an action.       al : to, towards.                  laux : according to.     apud : beside, near, by.           per : by means of, with.     da : of (indefinite quantity).     post : after, behind.     de : of from, by.                  pri : concerning, about.     el : out of.                       por : for, for the sake of.     en : in, into, within.             sen : without.     ekster : outside.                  super : above, over.     gxis : until, till, as far as.     sur : on, upon.     inter : between, among.            tra : through.     kontraux : against, opposite.      trans : across, on the other side.     kun : (in company) with.           je (has no definite meaning).    (These words are called PREPOSITIONS, which means placed before).    The other simple prepositions are--       anstataux : instead of.            po : at the rate of.     antaux : before.                   pro : for (cause), owing to.     cxe : at, with.                    preter : past, beyond, by.     cxirkaux : about, around.          spite : in despite of.     krom : besides, except.            sub : under.     malgraux : notwithstanding,           in spite of.    The prepositions \"anstataux\", \"antaux\" (\"ol\"), and \"por\" are also used  before Infinitive verbs, as \"anstataux diri\", instead of saying (to  say); \"antaux ol paroli\", before speaking; \"por lerni\", in order to  learn.    In Esperanto all the prepositions except \"je\" have a definite meaning,  and care must be taken to use the one which conveys the exact sense.  The same word cannot be used for \"with\" in the two sentences \"He went  with his father\" and \"He cut it with a knife,\" or for \"about\" in \"He  spoke about his child\" and \"They stood about the stove.\" In the first  example \"with\" his father is \"kun\", in company with, Li iris \"kun\"  sia patro, and \"with\" a knife is \"per\", by means of, Li trancxis gxin  \"per\" trancxilo. \"About,\" in \"about his child,\" is \"pri,\" concerning,  Li parolis \"pri\" sia infano, but \"about,\" in \"about the stove,\" is  \"cxirkaux,\" around, Ili staris \"cxirkaux\" la forno.    When we cannot decide which is the correct preposition to use in any  case, we may use \"je,\" the only preposition which has no special meaning  of its own, or the preposition may be left out altogether, and \"n\"  added to the noun or pronoun, provided that no want of clearness ensue  (see Lesson 27), as Mi ridas \"pro\" lia naiveco, or, Mi ridas \"je\" lia  naiveco, or, Mi ridas lian \"naivecon\", I laugh at his simplicity.    When we wish to express \"motion towards\" something, and the preposition  does not of itself express it, \"n\" is added to the noun or pronoun, as  in the case of adverbs (see Lesson 12), \"Li estas en la domo\", He is in  the house; but, \"Li iras en la domon\", He is going into the house.    NOTE.--There are three cases in which the noun or pronoun takes \"n\".  (i.). When it is the \"direct object\" of the verb, as \"Mi vidis lin\",  I saw him. (ii.). To show \"direction\", as \"Li iris en la gxardenon\",  He went into the garden. (iii.). When the \"preposition\" is \"left out\".  This is usually done in the case of \"dates\" and expressions signifying  \"duration\" of time, as \"Georgo Vasxington estis naskita la dudek-duan de  Februaro de la jaro mil sepcent tridek du\", George Washington was born  the 22nd of February, 1732. \"Vi restos tie cxi la tutan vivon (dum la  tuta vivo)\", You will remain here your (the) whole life.    All the prepositions whose meaning allows of it can be used as  adjectives, adverbs, etc., by adding the proper endings, as from  \"antaux\", before, we get \"antauxa\", former, \"antauxe\", formerly or  previously, \"antauxen\", forward.    Prepositions are also joined to other words, and to prefixes or  suffixes, as \"antauxdiri\", to foretell; \"apudmara urbo\", a seaside town;  \"senigi\", to deprive of.    Sometimes the preposition is both prefixed to the verb and used after it  before the noun, as \"Li eliris el la domo, kaj eniris en la gxardenon\",  He went out of the house, and entered into the garden.                                     LESSON 27.                                      Al.    \"Al\" signifies \"to\" or \"towards\" a person or place. It is also used  before the noun or pronoun which signifies \"person\" after such verbs as  \"give, tell\", etc., which take two objects in different relations to the  verb, as-- Give (to) him the book, \"Donu al li la libron.\" Tell (to)  him the truth, \"Diru al li la veron.\" Write (to) him a letter, \"Skribu  al li leteron.\" In such cases we can say \"Pardonu lin\", Pardon him, if  the \"thing\" object is not mentioned, but we cannot say \"Pardonu lin la  kulpon\", Forgive him his fault; it must be \"Pardonu al li la kulpon.\"  The pronoun with \"al\" is sometimes used instead of the possessive  (pronoun) adjective \"mia\", etc., as \"Mi trancxis al mi la fingron\",  for \"Mi trancxis mian fingron\", I cut my finger. \"Sxi kombis al si la  harojn,\" instead of \"Sxi kombis siajn harojn,\" She combed her hair.    \"Al\" is frequently used as a prefix as well as after the verb, as  \"aldoni\", to add; \"alpreni\", to adopt; \"aligxi\", to adhere; \"aljugxi\",  to award.                                  VOCABULARY.       sorcxisto : sorcerer.              promes- : promise.     detrancx- : cut off.               ambaux : both.    Sxi revenis al la palaco de sia patro. Ili ambaux iris al la urbestro.  Cxu mi ne faris al vi bonon? Sxi nenion al ili rakontis. Sxi skribis al  li leteron. Cxiutage li instruas al la homoj ion, kion ili ne scias. Ili  flugis al la suno.

He wanted a couple of hundred for  Appleby. Appleby was on to them like bricks. Spotted Shoeblossom  hadn't written them, and asked who had. He wouldn't say, so he got  them doubled. Everyone in the house is jolly sick with Merrett. They  think he ought to have owned up.\"    \"Did that smash up Merrett's show? Is he going to turn out any more?\"    \"Rather not. Who'd buy 'em?\"    It would have been better for the Lines Supplying Trust if Merrett had  not received this crushing blow and had been allowed to carry on a  rival business on legitimate lines. Locksley was conservative in its  habits, and would probably have continued to support the old firm.    As it was, the baffled Merrett, a youth of vindictive nature, brooded  over his defeat, and presently hit upon a scheme whereby things might  be levelled up.    One afternoon, shortly before lock-up, Dunstable was surprised by the  advent of Linton to his study in a bruised and dishevelled condition.  One of his expressive eyes was closed and blackened. He also wore what  is known in ring circles as a thick ear.    \"What on earth's up?\" inquired Dunstable, amazed at these phenomena.  \"Have you been scrapping?\"    \"Yes--Merrett--I won. What are you up to--writing lines? You may as  well save yourself the trouble. They won't be any good.\" Dunstable  stared.    \"The Trust's bust,\" said Linton.    He never wasted words in moments of emotion.    \"What!\"    \"'Bust' was what I said. That beast Merrett gave the show away.\"    \"What did he do? Surely he didn't tell a master?\"    \"Well, he did the next thing to it. He hauled out that prospectus, and  started reading it in form. I watched him do it. He kept it under the  desk and made a foul row, laughing over it. Appleby couldn't help  spotting him. Of course, he told him to bring him what he was reading.  Up went Merrett with the prospectus.\"    \"Was Appleby sick?\"    \"I don't believe he was, really. At least, he laughed when he read the  thing. But he hauled me up after school and gave me a long jaw, and  made me take all the lines I'd got to his house. He burnt them. I had  it out with Merrett just now. He swears he didn't mean to get the  thing spotted, but I knew he did.\"    \"Where did you scrag him!\"    \"In the dormitory. He chucked it after the third round.\"    There was a knock at the door.    \"Come in,\" shouted Dunstable.    Buxton appeared, a member of Appleby's house.    \"Oh, Dunstable, Appleby wants to see you.\"    \"All right,\" said Dunstable wearily.    Mr. Appleby was in facetious mood. He chaffed Dunstable genially about  his prospectus, and admitted that it had amused him. Dunstable smiled  without enjoyment. It was a good thing, perhaps, that Mr. Appleby saw  the humorous rather than the lawless side of the Trust; but all the  quips in the world could not save that institution from ruin.    Presently Mr. Appleby's manner changed. \"I am a funny dog, I know,\" he  seemed to say; \"but duty is duty, and must be done.\"    \"How many lines have you at your house, Dunstable?\" he asked.    \"About eight hundred, sir.\"    \"Then you had better write me eight hundred lines, and show them up to  me in this room at--shall we say at ten minutes to five? It is now a  quarter to, so that you will have plenty of time.\"    Dunstable went, and returned five minutes later, bearing an armful of  manuscript.    \"I don't think I shall need to count them,\" said Mr. Appleby. \"Kindly  take them in batches of ten sheets, and tear them in half, Dunstable.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    The last sheet fluttered in two sections into the surfeited  waste-paper basket.    \"It's an awful waste, sir,\" said Dunstable regretfully.    Mr. Appleby beamed.    \"We must, however,\" he said, \"always endeavour to look on the bright  side, Dunstable. The writing of these eight hundred lines will have  given you a fine grip of the rhythm of Virgil, the splendid prose of  Victor Hugo, and the unstudied majesty of the Greek Numerals. Good-night,  Dunstable.\"    \"Good-night, sir,\" said the President of the Locksley Lines Supplying  Trust, Ltd.          THE AUTOGRAPH HUNTERS      Dunstable had his reasons for wishing to obtain Mr. Montagu Watson's  autograph, but admiration for that gentleman's novels was not one of  them.    It was nothing to him that critics considered Mr. Watson one of the  most remarkable figures in English literature since Scott. If you had  told him of this, he would merely have wondered in his coarse,  material way how much Mr. Watson gave the critics for saying so. To  the reviewer of the _Weekly Booklover_ the great man's latest  effort, \"The Soul of Anthony Carrington\" (Popgood and Grooly: 6s.)  seemed \"a work that speaks eloquently in every line of a genius that  time cannot wither nor custom stale.\" To Dunstable, who got it out of  the school library, where it had been placed at the request of a  literary prefect, and read the first eleven pages, it seemed rot, and  he said as much to the librarian on returning it.    Yet he was very anxious to get the novelist's autograph. The fact was  that Mr. Day, his house-master, a man whose private life was in other  ways unstained by vicious habits, collected autographs. Also Mr. Day  had behaved in a square manner towards Dunstable on several occasions  in the past, and Dunstable, always ready to punish bad behaviour in a  master, was equally anxious to reward and foster any good trait which  he might exhibit.    On the occasion of the announcement that Mr. Watson had taken the big  white house near Chesterton, a couple of miles from the school, Mr.  Day had expressed in Dunstable's hearing a wish that he could add that  celebrity's signature to his collection. Dunstable had instantly  determined to play the part of a benevolent Providence. He would get  the autograph and present it to the house-master, as who should say,  \"see what comes of being good.\" It would be pleasant to observe the  innocent joy of the recipient, his child-like triumph, and his  amazement at the donor's ingenuity in securing the treasure. A  touching scene--well worth the trouble involved in the quest.    And there would be trouble. For Mr. Montagu Watson was notoriously a  foe to the autograph-hunter. His curt, type-written replies (signed by  a secretary) had damped the ardour of scores of brave men and--more or  less--fair women. A genuine Montagu Watson was a prize in the  autograph market.    Dunstable was a man of action. When Mark, the boot-boy at Day's,  carried his burden of letters to the post that evening, there nestled  among them one addressed to M. Watson, Esq., The White House,  Chesterton. Looking at it casually, few of his friends would have  recognised Dunstable's handwriting. For it had seemed good to that man  of guile to adopt for the occasion the role of a backward youth of  twelve years old. He thought tender years might touch Mr. Watson's  heart.    This was the letter:        _Dear Sir_,--I am only a littel boy, but I think your      books ripping. I often wonder how you think of it all. Will you      please send me your ortograf? I like your books very much. I have      named my white rabit Montagu after you. I punched Jones II in      the eye to-day becos he didn't like your books. I have spent the      only penny I have on the stampe for this letter which I might have      spent on tuck. I want to be like Maltby in \"The Soul of Anthony      Carrington\" when I grow up.                                _Your sincere reader_,                               P. A. Dunstable.    It was a little unfortunate, perhaps, that he selected Maltby as his  ideal character. That gentleman was considered by critics a masterly  portrait of the cynical _roue_. But it was the only name he  remembered.    \"Hot stuff!\" said Dunstable to himself, as he closed the envelope.    \"Little beast!\" said Mr. Watson to himself as he opened it. It arrived  by the morning post, and he never felt really himself till after  breakfast.    \"Here, Morrison,\" he said to his secretary, later in the morning:  \"just answer this, will you? The usual thing--thanks and most deeply  grateful, y'know.\"    Next day the following was included in Dunstable's correspondence:        Mr. Montagu Watson presents his compliments to Mr. P. A. Dunstable,      and begs to thank him for all the kind things he says about his      work in his letter of the 18th inst., for which he is deeply grateful.    \"Foiled!\" said Dunstable, and went off to Seymour's to see his friend  Linton.    \"Got any notepaper?\" he asked.    \"Heaps,\" said Linton. \"Why? Want some?\"    \"Then get out a piece. I want to dictate a letter.\"    Linton stared.    \"What's up? Hurt your hand?\"    Dunstable explained.    \"Day collects autographs, you know, and he wants Montagu Watson's  badly. Pining away, and all that sort of thing. Won't smile until he  gets it. I had a shot at it yesterday, and got this.\"    Linton inspected the document.    \"So I can't send up another myself, you see.\"    \"Why worry?\"    \"Oh, I'd like to put Day one up. He's not been bad this term. Come  on.\"    \"All right. Let her rip.\"    Dunstable let her rip.        _Dear Sir_,--I cannot refrain from writing to tell you what      an inestimable comfort your novels have been to me during years      of sore tribulation and distress----    \"Look here,\" interrupted Linton with decision at this point. \"If you  think I'm going to shove my name at the end of this rot, you're making  the mistake of a lifetime.\"    \"Of course not. You're a widow who has lost two sons in South Africa.  We'll think of a good name afterwards. Ready?        \"Ever since my darling Charles Herbert and Percy Lionel were      taken from me in that dreadful war, I have turned for consolation      to the pages of 'The Soul of Anthony Carrington' and----\"    \"What, another?\" asked Linton.    \"There's one called 'Pancakes.'\"    \"Sure? Sounds rummy.\"    \"That's all right. You have to get a queer title nowadays if you want"]]]
