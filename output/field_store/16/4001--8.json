These and other happenings of  a like nature soothed for the moment but could not cure the  restlessness which has always been so marked a trait in my character. I  have always been restless, unable to settle down in one place and  anxious to get on to the next thing. This may be due to a gipsy strain  in my ancestry--one of my uncles travelled with a circus--or it may be  the Artistic Temperament, acquired from a grandfather who, before dying  of a surfeit of paste in the property-room of the Bristol Coliseum,  which he was visiting in the course of a professional tour, had an  established reputation on the music-hall stage as one of Professor  Pond's Performing Poodles.    I owe the fullness and variety of my life to this restlessness of mine,  for I have repeatedly left comfortable homes in order to follow some  perfect stranger who looked as if he were on his way to somewhere  interesting. Sometimes I think I must have cat blood in me.    The Shy Man came into our yard one afternoon in April, while I was  sleeping with mother in the sun on an old sweater which we had borrowed  from Fred, one of the barmen. I heard mother growl, but I didn't take  any notice. Mother is what they call a good watch-dog, and she growls  at everybody except master. At first, when she used to do it, I would  get up and bark my head off, but not now. Life's too short to bark at  everybody who comes into our yard. It is behind the public-house, and  they keep empty bottles and things there, so people are always coming  and going.    Besides, I was tired. I had had a very busy morning, helping the men  bring in a lot of cases of beer, and running into the saloon to talk to  Fred and generally looking after things. So I was just dozing off  again, when I heard a voice say, 'Well, he's ugly enough!' Then I knew  that they were talking about me.    I have never disguised it from myself, and nobody has ever disguised it  from me, that I am not a handsome dog. Even mother never thought me  beautiful. She was no Gladys Cooper herself, but she never hesitated to  criticize my appearance. In fact, I have yet to meet anyone who did.  The first thing strangers say about me is, 'What an ugly dog!'    I don't know what I am. I have a bulldog kind of a face, but the rest  of me is terrier. I have a long tail which sticks straight up in the  air. My hair is wiry. My eyes are brown. I am jet black, with a white  chest. I once overheard Fred saying that I was a Gorgonzola  cheese-hound, and I have generally found Fred reliable in his  statements.    When I found that I was under discussion, I opened my eyes. Master was  standing there, looking down at me, and by his side the man who had  just said I was ugly enough. The man was a thin man, about the age of a  barman and smaller than a policeman. He had patched brown shoes and  black trousers.    'But he's got a sweet nature,' said master.    This was true, luckily for me. Mother always said, 'A dog without  influence or private means, if he is to make his way in the world, must  have either good looks or amiability.' But, according to her, I overdid  it. 'A dog,' she used to say, 'can have a good heart, without chumming  with every Tom, Dick, and Harry he meets. Your behaviour is sometimes  quite un-doglike.' Mother prided herself on being a one-man dog. She  kept herself to herself, and wouldn't kiss anybody except master--not  even Fred.    Now, I'm a mixer. I can't help it. It's my nature. I like men. I like  the taste of their boots, the smell of their legs, and the sound of  their voices. It may be weak of me, but a man has only to speak to me  and a sort of thrill goes right down my spine and sets my tail wagging.    I wagged it now. The man looked at me rather distantly. He didn't pat  me. I suspected--what I afterwards found to be the case--that he was  shy, so I jumped up at him to put him at his ease. Mother growled  again. I felt that she did not approve.    'Why, he's took quite a fancy to you already,' said master.    The man didn't say a word. He seemed to be brooding on something. He  was one of those silent men. He reminded me of Joe, the old dog down  the street at the grocer's shop, who lies at the door all day, blinking  and not speaking to anybody.    Master began to talk about me. It surprised me, the way he praised me.  I hadn't a suspicion he admired me so much. From what he said you would  have thought I had won prizes and ribbons at the Crystal Palace. But  the man didn't seem to be impressed. He kept on saying nothing.    When master had finished telling him what a wonderful dog I was till I  blushed, the man spoke.    'Less of it,' he said. 'Half a crown is my bid, and if he was an angel  from on high you couldn't get another ha'penny out of me. What about  it?'    A thrill went down my spine and out at my tail, for of course I saw now  what was happening. The man wanted to buy me and take me away. I looked  at master hopefully.    'He's more like a son to me than a dog,' said master, sort of wistful.    'It's his face that makes you feel that way,' said the man,  unsympathetically. 'If you had a son that's just how he would look.  Half a crown is my offer, and I'm in a hurry.'    'All right,' said master, with a sigh, 'though it's giving him away, a  valuable dog like that. Where's your half-crown?'    The man got a bit of rope and tied it round my neck.    I could hear mother barking advice and telling me to be a credit to the  family, but I was too excited to listen.    'Good-bye, mother,' I said. 'Good-bye, master. Good-bye, Fred. Good-bye  everybody. I'm off to see life. The Shy Man has bought me for half a  crown. Wow!'    I kept running round in circles and shouting, till the man gave me a  kick and told me to stop it.    So I did.    I don't know where we went, but it was a long way. I had never been off  our street before in my life and I didn't know the whole world was half  as big as that. We walked on and on, and the man jerked at my rope  whenever I wanted to stop and look at anything. He wouldn't even let me  pass the time of the day with dogs we met.    When we had gone about a hundred miles and were just going to turn in  at a dark doorway, a policeman suddenly stopped the man. I could feel  by the way the man pulled at my rope and tried to hurry on that he  didn't want to speak to the policeman. The more I saw of the man the  more I saw how shy he was.    'Hi!' said the policeman, and we had to stop.    'I've got a message for you, old pal,' said the policeman. 'It's from  the Board of Health. They told me to tell you you needed a change of  air. See?'    'All right!' said the man.    'And take it as soon as you like. Else you'll find you'll get it given  you. See?'    I looked at the man with a good deal of respect. He was evidently  someone very important, if they worried so about his health.    'I'm going down to the country tonight,' said the man.    The policeman seemed pleased.    'That's a bit of luck for the country,' he said. 'Don't go changing  your mind.'    And we walked on, and went in at the dark doorway, and climbed about a  million stairs and went into a room that smelt of rats. The man sat  down and swore a little, and I sat and looked at him.    Presently I couldn't keep it in any longer.    'Do we live here?' I said. 'Is it true we're going to the country?  Wasn't that policeman a good sort? Don't you like policemen? I knew  lots of policemen at the public-house. Are there any other dogs here?  What is there for dinner? What's in that cupboard? When are you going  to take me out for another run? May I go out and see if I can find a  cat?'    'Stop that yelping,' he said.    'When we go to the country, where shall we live? Are you going to be a  caretaker at a house? Fred's father is a caretaker at a big house in  Kent. I've heard Fred talk about it. You didn't meet Fred when you came  to the public-house, did you? You would like Fred. I like Fred. Mother  likes Fred. We all like Fred.'    I was going on to tell him a lot more about Fred, who had always been  one of my warmest friends, when he suddenly got hold of a stick and  walloped me with it.    'You keep quiet when you're told,' he said.    He really was the shyest man I had ever met. It seemed to hurt him to  be spoken to. However, he was the boss, and I had to humour him, so I  didn't say any more.    We went down to the country that night, just as the man had told the  policeman we would. I was all worked up, for I had heard so much about  the country from Fred that I had always wanted to go there. Fred used  to go off on a motor-bicycle sometimes to spend the night with his  father in Kent, and once he brought back a squirrel with him, which I  thought was for me to eat, but mother said no. 'The first thing a dog  has to learn,' mother used often to say, 'is that the whole world  wasn't created for him to eat.'    It was quite dark when we got to the country, but the man seemed to  know where to go. He pulled at my rope, and we began to walk along a  road with no people in it at all. We walked on and on, but it was all  so new to me that I forgot how tired I was. I could feel my mind  broadening with every step I took.    Every now and then we would pass a very big house, which looked as if  it was empty, but I knew that there was a caretaker inside, because of  Fred's father. These big houses belong to very rich people, but they  don't want to live in them till the summer, so they put in caretakers,  and the caretakers have a dog to keep off burglars. I wondered if that  was what I had been brought here for.    'Are you going to be a caretaker?' I asked the man.    'Shut up,' he said.    So I shut up.    After we had been walking a long time, we came to a cottage. A man came  out. My "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7477"],[0,"The Book of Wonder (#11)"],[1," rampart by rampart, towers for archers, gateway of  brass, and all. And then one day he argued, and quite rightly, that  all the silk-clad people in its streets, their camels, their wares  that came from Inkustahn, the city itself, were all the things of his  will--and then he made himself King. He smiled after that when people  did not raise their hats to him in the street, as he walked from the  station to Business; but he was sufficiently practical to recognize  that it was better not to talk of this to those that only knew him as  Mr. Shap.    Now that he was King in the city of Larkar and in all the desert that  lay to the East and North he sent his fancy to wander further afield.  He took the regiments of his camel-guards and went jingling out of  Larkar, with little silver bells under the camels' chins, and came to  other cities far-off on the yellow sand, with clear white walls and  towers, uplifting themselves in the sun. Through their gates he passed  with his three silken regiments, the light-blue regiment of the  camel-guards being upon his right and the green regiment riding at his  left, the lilac regiment going on before. When he had gone through the  streets of any city and observed the ways of its people, and had seen  the way that the sunlight struck its towers, he would proclaim himself  King there, and then ride on in fancy. So he passed from city to city  and from land to land. Clear-sighted though Mr. Shap was, I think he  overlooked the lust of aggrandizement to which kings have so often  been victims; and so it was that when the first few cities had opened  their gleaming gates and he saw peoples prostrate before his camel,  and spearmen cheering along countless balconies, and priests come out  to do him reverence, he that had never had even the lowliest authority  in the familiar world became unwisely insatiate. He let his fancy ride  at inordinate speed, he forsook method, scarce was he king of a land  but he yearned to extend his borders; so he journeyed deeper and  deeper into the wholly unknown. The concentration that he gave to this  inordinate progress through countries of which history is ignorant and  cities so fantastic in their bulwarks that, though their inhabitants  were human, yet the foe that they feared seemed something less or  more; the amazement with which he beheld gates and towers unknown even  to art, and furtive people thronging intricate ways to acclaim him as  their sovereign--all these things began to affect his capacity for  Business. He knew as well as any that his fancy could not rule these  beautiful lands unless that other Shap, however unimportant, were well  sheltered and fed: and shelter and food meant money, and money,  Business. His was more like the mistake of some gambler with cunning  schemes who overlooks human greed. One day his fancy, riding in the  morning, came to a city gorgeous as the sunrise, in whose opalescent  wall were gates of gold, so huge that a river poured between the bars,  floating in, when the gates were opened, large galleons under sail.  Thence there came dancing out a company with instruments, and made a  melody all around the wall; that morning Mr. Shap, the bodily Shap in  London, forgot the train to town.    Until a year ago he had never imagined at all; it is not to be  wondered at that all these things now newly seen by his fancy should  play tricks at first with the memory of even so sane a man. He gave up  reading the papers altogether, he lost all interest in politics, he  cared less and less for things that were going on around him. This  unfortunate missing of the morning train even occurred again, and the  firm spoke to him severely about it. But he had his consolation. Were  not Arathrion and Argun Zeerith and all the level coasts of Oora his?  And even as the firm found fault with him his fancy watched the yaks  on weary journeys, slow specks against the snow-fields, bringing  tribute; and saw the green eyes of the mountain men who had looked at  him strangely in the city of Nith when he had entered it by the desert  door. Yet his logic did not forsake him; he knew well that his strange  subjects did not exist, but he was prouder of having created them with  his brain, than merely of ruling them only; thus in his pride he felt  himself something more great than a king, he did not dare to think  what! He went into the temple of the city of Zorra and stood some time  there alone: all the priests kneeled to him when he came away.    He cared less and less for the things we care about, for the affairs  of Shap, the business-man in London. He began to despise the man with  a royal contempt.    One day when he sat in Sowla, the city of the Thuls, throned on one  amethyst, he decided, and it was proclaimed on the moment by silver  trumpets all along the land, that he would be crowned as king over all  the lands of Wonder.    By that old temple where the Thuls were worshipped, year in, year out,  for over a thousand years, they pitched pavilions in the open air. The  trees that blew there threw out radiant scents unknown in any countries  that know the map; the stars blazed fiercely for that famous occasion. A  fountain hurled up, clattering, ceaselessly into the air armfuls on  armfuls of diamonds. A deep hush waited for the golden trumpets, the  holy coronation night was come. At the top of those old, worn steps,  going down we know not whither, stood the king in the emerald-and-amethyst  cloak, the ancient garb of the Thuls; beside him lay that Sphinx that  for the last few weeks had advised him in his affairs.    Slowly, with music when the trumpets sounded, came up towards him from  we know not where, one-hundred-and-twenty archbishops, twenty angels  and two archangels, with that terrific crown, the diadem of the Thuls.  They knew as they came up to him that promotion awaited them all  because of this night's work. Silent, majestic, the king awaited them.    The doctors downstairs were sitting over their supper, the warders  softly slipped from room to room, and when in that cosy dormitory of  Hanwell they saw the king still standing erect and royal, his face  resolute, they came up to him and addressed him:    \"Go to bed,\" they said--\"pretty bed.\" So he lay down and soon was fast  asleep: the great day was over.        CHU-BU AND SHEEMISH      It was the custom on Tuesdays in the temple of Chu-bu for the priests  to enter at evening and chant, \"There is none but Chu-bu.\"    And all the people rejoiced and cried out, \"There is none but Chu-bu.\"  And honey was offered to Chu-bu, and maize and fat. Thus was he  magnified.    Chu-bu was an idol of some antiquity, as may be seen from the colour  of the wood. He had been carved out of mahogany, and after he was  carved he had been polished. Then they had set him up on the diorite  pedestal with the brazier in front of it for burning spices and the  flat gold plates for fat. Thus they worshipped Chu-bu.    He must have been there for over a hundred years when one day the  priests came in with another idol into the temple of Chu-bu, and set it  up on a pedestal near Chu-bu's and sang, \"There is also Sheemish.\"    And all the people rejoiced and cried out, \"There is also Sheemish.\"    Sheemish was palpably a modern idol, and although the wood was stained  with a dark-red dye, you could see that he had only just been carved.  And honey was offered to Sheemish as well as Chu-bu, and also maize  and fat.    The fury of Chu-bu knew no time-limit: he was furious all that night,  and next day he was furious still. The situation called for immediate  miracles. To devastate the city with a pestilence and kill all his  priests was scarcely within his power, therefore he wisely  concentrated such divine powers as he had in commanding a little  earthquake. \"Thus,\" thought Chu-bu, \"will I reassert myself as the  only god, and men shall spit upon Sheemish.\"    Chu-bu willed it and willed it and still no earthquake came, when  suddenly he was aware that the hated Sheemish was daring to attempt a  miracle too. He ceased to busy himself about the earthquake and  listened, or shall I say felt, for what Sheemish was thinking; for  gods are aware of what passes in the mind by a sense that is other  than any of our five. Sheemish was trying to make an earthquake too.    The new god's motive was probably to assert himself. I doubt if Chu-bu  understood or cared for his motive; it was sufficient for an idol  already aflame with jealousy that his detestable rival was on the  verge of a miracle. All the power of Chu-bu veered round at once and  set dead against an earthquake, even a little one. It was thus in the  temple of Chu-bu for some time, and then no earthquake came.    To be a god and to fail to achieve a miracle is a despairing  sensation; it is as though among men one should determine upon a  hearty sneeze and as though no sneeze should come; it is as though one  should try to swim in heavy boots or remember a name that is utterly  forgotten: all these pains were Sheemish's.    And upon Tuesday the priests came in, and the people, and they did  worship Chu-bu and offered fat to him, saying, \"O Chu-bu who made  everything,\" and then the priests sang, \"There is also Sheemish\"; and  Chu-bu was put to shame and spake not for three days.    Now there were holy birds in the temple of Chu-bu, and when the third  day was come and the night thereof, it was as it were revealed to the  mind of Chu-bu, that there was dirt upon the head of Sheemish.    And Chu-bu spake unto Sheemish as speak the gods, moving no lips nor  yet disturbing the silence, saying, \"There is dirt upon thy head, O  Sheemish.\" All night long he muttered again and again, \"there is dirt  upon Sheemish's head.\" And when it was dawn and voices were heard far  off, Chu-bu became exultant with Earth's awakening things, and cried  out till the sun was high, \"Dirt, dirt, dirt, upon the head of  Sheemish,\" and at noon he said, \"So"]]]
