It is the opinion of  the most clear-sighted and the wisest that, in proportion as gold is more  precious than silver, so the manner of living and acting which the king  brought back from his pilgrimage in the Holy Land was holy and new, and  superior to his former behavior, albeit, even in his youth, he had ever  been good and guileless, and worthy of high esteem.\"  These are the words  written about  St. Louis by his confessor Geoffrey de Beaulieu, a  chronicler, curt and simple even to dryness, but at the same time well  informed.  An attempt will be made presently to give a fair idea of the  character of  St. Louis's government during the last fifteen years of his  reign, and of the place he fills in the history of the kingship and of  politics in France; but just now it is only with the part he played in  the crusades and with what became of them in his hands that we have to  occupy our attention.  For seven years after his return to France, from  1254 to 1261, Louis seemed to think no more about them, and there is  nothing to show that he spoke of them even to his most intimate  confidants; but, in spite of his apparent calmness, he was living, so far  as they were concerned, in a continual ferment of imagination and  internal fever, ever flattering himself that some favorable circumstance  would call him back to his interrupted work.  And he had reason to  believe that circumstances were responsive to his wishes.  The Christians  of Palestine and Syria were a prey to perils and evils which became more  pressing every day; the cross was being humbled at one time before the  Tartars of Tchingis-Khan, at another before the Mussulmans of Egypt; Pope  Urban was calling upon the King of France; and Geoffrey de Sargines, the  heroic representative whom Louis had left in  St. Jean d'Acre, at the  head of a small garrison, was writing to him that ruin was imminent, and  speedy succor indispensable to prevent it.  In 1261, Louis held, at  Paris, a parliament, at which, without any talk of a new crusade,  measures were taken which revealed an idea of it: there were decrees for  fasts and prayers on behalf of the Christians of the East and for  frequent and earnest military drill.  In 1263, the crusade was openly  preached; taxes were levied, even on the clergy, for the purpose of  contributing towards it; and princes and barons bound themselves to take  part in it.  Louis was all approval and encouragement, without declaring  his own intention.  In 1267, a parliament was convoked at Paris.  The  king, at first, conversed discreetly with some of his barons about the  new plan of crusade; and then, suddenly, having had the precious relics  deposited in the Holy Chapel set before the eyes of the assembly, he  opened the session by ardently exhorting those present \"to avenge the  insult which had so long been offered to the Saviour in the Holy Land and  to recover the Christian heritage possessed, for our sins, by the  infidels.\"  Next year, on the 9th of February, 1268, at a new parliament  assembled at Paris, the king took an oath to start in the month of May,  1270.    Great was the surprise, and the disquietude was even greater than the  surprise.  The kingdom was enjoying abroad a peace and at home a  tranquillity and prosperity for a long time past without example; feudal  quarrels were becoming more rare and terminating more quickly; and the  king possessed the confidence and the respect of the whole population.  Why compromise such advantages by such an enterprise, so distant, so  costly, and so doubtful of success?  Whether from good sense or from  displeasure at the burdens imposed upon them, many ecclesiastics showed  symptoms of opposition, and Pope Clement IV. gave the king nothing but  ambiguous and very reserved counsel.  When he learned that Louis was  taking with him on the crusade three of his sons, aged respectively  twenty-two, eighteen, and seventeen, he could not refrain from writing to  the Cardinal of  St. Cecile, \"It doth not strike us as an act of well-  balanced judgment to impose the taking of the cross upon so many of the  king's sons, and especially the eldest; and, albeit we have heard reasons  to the contrary, either we be much mistaken or they are utterly devoid of  reason.\"  Even the king's personal condition was matter for grave  anxiety.  His health was very much enfeebled; and several of his most  intimate and most far-seeing advisers were openly opposed to his design.  He vehemently urged Joinville to take the cross again with him; but  Joinville refused downright.  \"I thought,\" said he, \"that they all  committed a mortal sin to advise him the voyage, because the whole  kingdom was in fair peace at home and with all neighbors, and, so soon as  he departed, the state of the kingdom did nought but worsen.  They also  committed a great sin to advise him the voyage in the great state of  weakness in which his body was, for he could not bear to go by chariot or  to ride; he was so weak that he suffered me to carry him in my arms from  the hotel of the Count of Auxerre, the place where I took leave of him,  to the Cordeliers.  And nevertheless, weak as he was, had he remained in  France, he might have lived yet a while and wrought much good.\"    All objections, all warnings, all anxieties came to nothing in the face  of Louis's fixed idea and pious passion.  He started from Paris on the  16th of March, 1270, a sick man almost already, but with soul content,  and probably the only one without misgiving in the midst of all his  comrades.  It was once more at Aigues-Mortes that he went to embark.  All  was as yet dark and undecided as to the plan of the expedition.  Was  Egypt, or Palestine, or Constantinople, or Tunis, to be the first point  of attack?  Negotiations, touching this subject, had been opened with the  Venetians and the Genoese without arriving at any conclusion or  certainty.  Steps were taken at haphazard with full trust in Providence  and utter forgetfulness that Providence does not absolve men from  foresight.  On arriving at Aigues-Mortes about the middle of May, Louis  found nothing organized, nothing in readiness, neither crusaders nor  vessels; everything was done slowly, incompletely, and with the greatest  irregularity.  At last, on the 2d of July, 1270, he set sail without any  one's knowing and without the king's telling any one whither they were  going.  It was only in Sardinia, after four days' halt at Cagliari, that  Louis announced to the chiefs of the crusade, assembled aboard his ship  the Mountjoy, that he was making for Tunis, and that their Christian work  would commence there.  The King of Tunis (as he was then called),  Mohammed Mostanser, had for some time been talking of his desire to  become a Christian, if he could be efficiently protected against the  seditions of his subjects.  Louis welcomed with transport the prospect of  Mussulman conversions.  \"Ah!\" he cried, \"if I could only see myself the  gossip and sponsor of so great a godson!\"    But on the 17th of July, when the fleet arrived before Tunis, the  admiral, Florent de Varennes, probably without the king's orders and with  that want of reflection which was conspicuous at each step of the  enterprise, immediately took possession of the harbor and of some  Tunisian vessels as prize, and sent word to the king \"that he had only to  support him and that the disembarkation of the troops might be effected  in perfect safety.\"  Thus war was commenced at the very first moment  against the Mussulman prince whom there had been a promise of seeing  before long a Christian.    At the end of a fortnight, after some fights between the Tunisians and  the crusaders, so much political and military blindness produced its  natural consequences.  The re-enforcements promised to Louis, by his  brother Charles of Anjou, king of Sicily, had not arrived; provisions  were falling short; and the heats of an African summer were working havoc  amongst the army with such rapidity that before long there was no time to  bury the dead, but they were cast pell-mell into the ditch which  surrounded the camp, and the air was tainted thereby.  On the 3d of  August Louis was attacked by the epidemic fever, and obliged to keep his  bed in his tent.  He asked news of his son John Tristan, Count of Nevers,  who had fallen ill before him, and whose recent death, aboard the vessel  to which he had been removed in hopes that the sea air might be  beneficial, had been carefully concealed from him.  The count, as well as  the Princess Isabel, married to Theobald the Young, King of Navarre, was  a favorite child of Louis, who, on hearing of his loss, folded his hands  and sought in silence and prayer some assuagement of his grief.  His  malady grew worse; and having sent for his successor, Prince Philip  (Philip the Bold), he took from his hour-book some instructions which he  had written out for him, with his own hand and in French, and delivered  them to him, bidding him to observe them scrupulously.  He gave likewise  to his daughter Isabel, who was weeping at the foot of his bed, and to  his son-in-law the King of Navarre, some writings which had been intended  for them, and he further charged Isabel to deliver another to her  youngest sister, Agnes, affianced to the Duke of Burgundy.  \"Dearest  daughter,\" said he, \"think well hereon: full many folk have fallen asleep  with wild thoughts of sin, and in the morning their place hath not known  them.\"  Just after he had finished satisfying his paternal solicitude, it  was announced to him, on the 24th of August, that envoys from the Emperor  Michael Palaeologus had landed at Cape Carthage, with orders to demand  his intervention with his brother Charles, King of Sicily, to deter him  from making war on the but lately re-established Greek empire.  Louis  summoned all his strength to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11953"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 3 (#12)"],[1,"with him.  If I have  had the victory over the nobles of France, it is by God's grace.  The  death of the Duke of Brabant hath been an affliction to me; but I do  assure thee that neither I nor my people did cause his death.  Take back  to thy master his gauntlet; if he will be at Boulogne on the 15th of  January next, I will prove to him by the testimony of my prisoners and  two of my friends, that it was the French who accomplished his brother's  destruction.\"    The Duke of Burgundy, as a matter of course, let his quarrel with the  King of England drop, and occupied himself for the future only in  recovering his power in France.  He set out on the march for Paris,  proclaiming everywhere that he was assembling his army solely for the  purpose of avenging the kingdom, chastising the English, and aiding the  king with his counsels and his forces.  The sentiment of nationality was  so strongly aroused that politicians most anxious about their own  personal interests, and about them alone, found themselves obliged to pay  homage to it.    Unfortunately, it was, so far as Duke John was concerned, only a  superficial and transitory homage.  There is no repentance so rarely seen  as that of selfishness in pride and power.  The four years which elapsed  between the battle of Agincourt and the death of John the Fearless were  filled with nothing but fresh and still more tragic explosions of hatred  and strife between the two factions of the Burgundians and Armagnacs,  taking and losing, re-taking and re-losing, alternately, their ascendency  with the king and in the government of France.  When, after the battle of  Agincourt, the Duke of Burgundy marched towards Paris, he heard almost  simultaneously that the king was issuing a prohibition against the entry  of his troops, and that his rival, the Count of Armagnac, had just  arrived and been put in possession of the military power, as constable,  and of the civil power, as superintendent-general of finance.  The duke  then returned to Burgundy, and lost no time in recommencing hostilities  against the king's government.  At one time he let his troops make war on  the king's and pillage the domains of the crown; at another he entered  into negotiations with the King of England, and showed a disposition to  admit his claims to such and such a province, and even perhaps to the  throne of France.  He did not accede to the positive alliance offered him  by Henry; but he employed the fear entertained of it by the king's  government as a weapon against his enemies.  The Count of Armagnac, on  his side, made the most relentless use of power against the Duke of  Burgundy and his partisans; he pursued them everywhere, especially in  Paris, with dexterous and pitiless hatred.  He abolished the whole  organization and the privileges of the Parisian butcherdom which had  shown so favorable a leaning towards Duke John; and the system he  established as a substitute was founded on excellent grounds appertaining  to the interests of the people and of good order in the heart of Paris;  but the violence of absolute power and of hatred robs the best measures  of the credit they would deserve if they were more disinterested and  dispassionate.  A lively reaction set in at Paris in favor of the  persecuted Burgundians; even outside of Paris several towns of  importance, Rheims, Chalons, Troyes, Auxerre, Amiens, and Rouen itself,  showed a favorable disposition towards the Duke of Burgundy, and made a  sort of alliance with him, promising to aid him \"in reinstating the king  in his freedom and lordship, and the realm in its freedom and just  rights.\"  The Count of Armagnac was no more tender with the court than  with the populace of Paris.  He suspected, not without reason, that the  queen, Isabel of Bavaria, was in secret communication with and gave  information to Duke John.  Moreover, she was leading a scandalously  licentious life at Vincennes; and one of her favorites, Louis de  Bosredon, a nobleman of Auvergne and her steward, meeting the king one  day on the road, greeted the king cavalierly and hastily went his way.  Charles VI. was plainly offended.  The Count of Armagnac seized the  opportunity; and not only did he foment the king's ill-humor, but talked  to him of all the irregularities of which the queen was the centre, and  in which Louis de Bosredon was, he said, at that time her principal  accomplice.  Charles, in spite of the cloud upon his mind, could hardly  have been completely ignorant cf such facts; but it is not necessary to  be a king to experience extreme displeasure on learning that offensive  scandals are almost public, and on hearing the whole tale of them.  The  king, carried away by his anger, went straight to Vincennes, had a  violent scene with his wife, and caused Bosredon to be arrested,  imprisoned, and put to the question; and he, on his own confession it is  said, was thrown into the Seine, sewn up in a leathern sack, on which  were inscribed the words, \"Let the king's justice run its course!\"  Charles VI. and Armagnac did not stop there.  Queen Isabel was first of  all removed from the council and stripped of all authority, and then  banished to Tours, where commissioners were appointed to watch over her  conduct, and not to let her even write a letter without their seeing it.  But royal personages can easily elude such strictness.  A few months  after her banishment, whilst the despotism of Armagnac and the war  between the king and the Duke of Burgundy were still going on, Queen  Isabel managed to send to the duke, through one of her servants, her  golden seal, which John the Fearless well knew, with a message to the  effect that she would go with him if he would come to fetch her.  On the  night of November 1, 1417, the Duke of Burgundy hurriedly raised the  siege of Corbeil, advanced with a body of troops to a position within two  leagues from Tours, and sent the queen notice that he was awaiting her.  Isabel ordered her three custodians to go with her to mass at the Convent  of Marmoutier, outside the city.  Scarcely was she within the church when  a Burgundian captain, Hector de Saveuse, presented himself with sixty men  at the door.  \"Look to your safety, madame,\" said her custodians to  Isabel; \"here is a large company of Burgundians or English.\"  \"Keep close  to me,\" replied the queen.  Hector de Saveuse at that moment entered and  saluted the queen on behalf of the Duke of Burgundy.  \"Where is he?\"  asked the queen.  \"He will not be long coming.\"  Isabel ordered the  captain to arrest her three custodians; and two hours afterwards Duke  John arrived with his men-at-arms.  \"My dearest cousin,\" said the queen  to him, \"I ought to love you above every man in the realm; you have left  all at my bidding, and are come to deliver me from prison.  Be assured  that I will never fail you.  I quite see that you have always been  devoted to my lord, his family, the realm, and the common-weal.\"  The  duke carried the queen off to Chartres; and as soon as she was settled  there, on the 12th of November, 1417, she wrote to the good towns of the  kingdom,    \"We, Isabel, by the grace of God Queen of France, having, by reason of my  lord the king's seclusion, the government and administration of this  realm, by irrevocable grant made to us by the said my lord the king and  his council, are come to Chartres in company with our cousin, the Duke of  Burgundy, in order to advise and ordain whatsoever is necessary to  preserve and recover the supremacy of my lord the king, on advice taken  of the prud'hommes, vassals, and subjects.\"    She at the same time ordered that Master Philip de Morvilliers,  heretofore councillor of the Duke of Burgundy, should go to Amiens,  accompanied by several clerics of note and by a registrar, and that there  should be held there, by the queen's authority, for the bailiwicks of  Amiens, Vermandois, Tournai, and the countship of Ponthieu, a sovereign  court of justice, in the place of that which there was at Paris.  Thus,  and by such a series of acts of violence and of falsehoods, the Duke of  Burgundy, all the while making war on the king, surrounded himself with  hollow forms of royal and legal government.    Whilst civil war was thus penetrating to the very core of the kingship,  foreign war was making its way again into the kingdom.  Henry V., after  the battle of Agincourt, had returned to London, and had left his army to  repose and reorganize after its sufferings and its losses.  It was not  until eighteen months afterwards, on the 1st of August, 1417, that he  landed at Touques, not far from Honfleur, with fresh troops, and resumed  his campaign in France.  Between 1417 and 1419 he successively laid siege  to nearly all the towns of importance in Normandy, to Caen, Bayeux,  Falaise, Evreux, Coutances, Laigle, St. Lo, Cherbourg, &c., &c.  Some  he occupied after a short resistance, others were sold to him by their  governors; but when, in the month of July, 1418, he undertook the siege  of Rouen, he encountered there a long and serious struggle.  Rouen had at  that time, it is said, a population of one hundred and fifty thousand  souls, which was animated by ardent patriotism.  The Rouennese, on the  approach of the English, had repaired their gates, their ramparts, and  their moats; had demanded re-enforcements from the King of France and the  Duke of Burgundy; and had ordered every person incapable of bearing arms  or procuring provisions for ten months, to leave the city.  Twelve  thousand old men, women, and children were thus expelled, and died either  round the place or whilst roving in misery over the neighboring country;  \"poor women gave birth unassisted beneath the walls, and good  compassionate people in the town drew up the new-born in baskets to have  them baptized, and afterwards lowered them down to their mothers to die  together.\"  Fifteen thousand men of city-militia, four thousand regular  soldiers,"]]]
