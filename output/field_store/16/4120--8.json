[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10986"],[0,"Frederick Douglass (#12)"],[1,"by  his wit and eloquence.\"    A speech delivered by Douglass at Concord, New Hampshire, is thus  described by another writer: \"He gradually let out the outraged  humanity that was laboring in him, in indignant and terrible  speech.... There was great oratory in his speech, but more of dignity  and earnestness than what we call eloquence. He was an insurgent  slave, taking hold on the rights of speech, and charging on his  tyrants the bondage of his race.\"    In Holland's biography of Douglass extracts are given from letters  of distinguished contemporaries who knew the orator. Colonel T.W.  Higginson writes thus: \"I have hardly heard his equal, in grasp upon  an audience, in dramatic presentation, in striking at the pith of an  ethical question, and in single [signal] illustrations and examples.\"  Another writes, in reference to the impromptu speech delivered at the  meeting at Rochester on the death of Lincoln: \"I have heard Webster  and Clay in their best moments, Channing and Beecher in their highest  inspirations. I never heard truer eloquence. I never saw profounder  impression.\"    The published speeches of Douglass, of which examples may be found  scattered throughout his various autobiographies, reveal something of  the powers thus characterized, though, like other printed speeches,  they lose by being put in type. But one can easily imagine their  effect upon a sympathetic or receptive audience, when delivered with  flashing eye and deep-toned resonant voice by a man whose complexion  and past history gave him the highest right to describe and denounce  the iniquities of slavery and contend for the rights of a race. In  later years, when brighter days had dawned for his people, and age  had dimmed the recollection of his sufferings and tempered his  animosities, he became more charitable to his old enemies; but in the  vigor of his manhood, with the memory of his wrongs and those of his  race fresh upon him, he possessed that indispensable quality of the  true reformer: he went straight to the root of the evil, and made no  admissions and no compromises. Slavery for him was conceived in greed,  born in sin, cradled in shame, and worthy of utter and relentless  condemnation. He had the quality of directness and simplicity. When  Collins would have turned the abolition influence to the support of a  communistic scheme, Douglass opposed it vehemently. Slavery was the  evil they were fighting, and their cause would be rendered still more  unpopular if they ran after strange gods.    When Garrison pleaded for the rights of man, when Phillips with golden  eloquence preached the doctrine of humanity and progress, men approved  and applauded. When Parker painted the moral baseness of the times,  men acquiesced shamefacedly. When Channing preached the gospel of  love, they wished the dream might become a reality. But, when Douglass  told the story of his wrongs and those of his brethren in bondage,  they felt that here indeed was slavery embodied, here was an argument  for freedom that could not be gainsaid, that the race that could  produce in slavery such a man as Frederick Douglass must surely be  worthy of freedom.    What Douglass's platform utterances in later years lacked of the  vehemence and fire of his earlier speeches, they made up in wisdom and  mature judgment. There is a note of exultation in his speeches just  after the war. Jehovah had triumphed, his people were free. He had  seen the Red Sea of blood open and let them pass, and engulf the enemy  who pursued them.    Among the most noteworthy of Douglass's later addresses were the  oration at the unveiling of the Freedmen's Monument to Abraham Lincoln  in Washington in 1876, which may be found in his _Life and Times_;  the address on Decoration Day, New York, 1878; his eulogy on Wendell  Phillips, printed in Austin's _Life and Times of Wendell Phillips_;  and the speech on the death of Garrison, June, 1879. He lectured in  the Parker Fraternity Course in Boston, delivered numerous addresses  to gatherings of colored men, spoke at public dinners and woman  suffrage meetings, and retained his hold upon the interest of the  public down to the very day of his death.          XII.      With the full enfranchisement of his people, Douglass entered upon  what may be called the third epoch of his career, that of fruition.  Not every worthy life receives its reward in this world; but Douglass,  having fought the good fight, was now singled out, by virtue of his  prominence, for various honors and emoluments at the hands of the  public. He was urged by many friends to take up his residence in some  Southern district and run for Congress; but from modesty or some doubt  of his fitness--which one would think he need not have felt--and the  consideration that his people needed an advocate at the North to keep  alive there the friendship and zeal for liberty that had accomplished  so much for his race, he did not adopt the suggestion.    In 1860 [1870] Douglass moved to Washington, and began [took over] the  publication of the _New National Era_, a weekly paper devoted to the  interests of the colored race. The venture did not receive the support  hoped for; and the paper was turned over to Douglass's two [oldest]  sons, Lewis and Frederick, and was finally abandoned [in 1874],  Douglass having sunk about ten thousand dollars in the enterprise.  Later newspapers for circulation among the colored people have proved  more successful; and it ought to be a matter of interest that the race  which thirty years ago could not support one publication, edited by  its most prominent man, now maintains several hundred newspapers which  make their appearance regularly.    In 1871 Douglass was elected president of the Freedmans Bank.  This ill-starred venture was then apparently in the full tide of  prosperity, and promised to be a great lever in the uplifting of  the submerged race. Douglass, soon after his election as president,  discovered the insolvency of the institution, and insisted that it be  closed up. The negro was in the hands of his friends, and was destined  to suffer for their mistakes as well as his own.    Other honors that fell to Douglass were less empty than the presidency  of a bankrupt bank. In 1870 he was appointed by President Grant a  member of the Santo Domingo Commission, the object of which was to  arrange terms for the annexation of the mulatto republic to the Union.  Some of the best friends of the colored race, among them Senator  Sumner, opposed this step; but Douglass maintained that to receive  Santo Domingo as a State would add to its strength and importance. The  scheme ultimately fell through, whether for the good or ill of Santo  Domingo can best be judged when the results of more recent annexation  schemes [1898: Puerto Rico, Guam, the Philippines, Hawaii, and _de  facto_ Cuba] become apparent. Douglass went to Santo Domingo on an  American man-of-war, in the company of three other commissioners. In  his _Life and Times_ he draws a pleasing contrast between some of his  earlier experiences in travelling, and the terms of cordial intimacy  upon which, as the representative of a nation which a few years before  had denied him a passport, he was now received in the company of able  and distinguished gentlemen.    On his return to the United States Douglass received from President  Grant an appointment as member of the legislative council, or upper  house of the legislature, of the District of Columbia, where he served  for a short time, until other engagements demanded his resignation,  [one of] his son[s] being appointed to fill out his term. To this  appointment Douglass owed the title of \"Honorable,\" subsequently  applied to him.    In 1872 Douglass presided over and addressed a convention of colored  men at New Orleans, and urged them to support President Grant for  renomination. He was elected a presidential elector for New York,  and on the meeting of the electoral college in Albany, after Grant's  triumphant re-election, received a further mark of confidence and  esteem in the appointment at the hands of his fellow-electors to carry  the sealed vote to Washington. Douglass sought no personal reward  for his services in this campaign, but to his influence was due the  appointment of several of his friends to higher positions than had  ever theretofore been held in this country by colored men.    When R. B. Hayes was nominated for President, Douglass again took the  stump, and received as a reward the honorable and lucrative office  of Marshal of the United States for the District of Columbia. This  appointment was not agreeable to the white people of the District,  whose sympathies were largely pro-slavery; and an effort was made to  have its confirmation defeated in the Senate. The appointment was  confirmed, however; and Douglass served his term of four years, in  spite of numerous efforts to bring about his removal.    In 1879 the hard conditions under which the negroes in the South  were compelled to live led to a movement to promote an exodus of  the colored people to the North and West, in the search for better  opportunities. The white people of the South, alarmed at the prospect  of losing their labor, were glad to welcome Douglass when he went  among them to oppose this movement, which he at that time considered  detrimental to the true interests of the colored population.    Under the Garfield administration Douglass was appointed in May, 1881,  recorder of deeds for the District of Columbia. He held this very  lucrative office through the terms of Presidents Garfield and Arthur  and until removed by President Cleveland in 1886, having served nearly  a year after Cleveland's inauguration. In 1889 he was appointed by  President Harrison as minister resident and consul-general to the  Republic of Hayti, in which capacity he acted until 1891, when he  resigned and returned permanently to Washington.

The chief asked  the people who the owner of these farms and cattle was. The answer  always was that they belonged to Masoy. Consequently the chief was  greatly impressed by Masoy's great wealth.    The chief greatly admired the palace and considered himself fortunate  to have such a son-in-law. That night the wedding took place, and  Masoy lived many years in the palace with his wife, having the ape  and a great number of slaves to serve him.      CHAPTER 20    Arnomongo and Iput-Iput.    (The Ape and the Firefly.)            One evening the firefly was on his way to the house of a friend, and as  he passed the ape's house, the latter asked him: \"Mr. Fire-fly, why do  you carry a light?\" The firefly replied: \"Because I am afraid of the  mosquitoes.\" \"Oh, then you are a coward, are you?\" said the ape. \"No,  I am not,\" was the answer. \"If you are not afraid,\" asked the ape,  \"why do you always carry a lantern?\" \"I carry a lantern so that when  the mosquitoes come to bite me I can see them and defend myself,\"  replied the firefly. Then the ape laughed aloud, and on the next day  he told all his neighbors that the firefly carried a light at night  because he was a coward.    When the firefly heard what the ape had said, he went to his house. It  was night and the ape was asleep, but the firefly flashed his light  into his face and awakened him. The firefly was very angry and said:  \"Why did you spread the report that I was a coward? If you wish to  prove which of us is the braver, I will fight you on the plaza next  Sunday evening.\"    The ape inquired: \"Have you any companions?\" \"No,\" replied the  fire-fly, \"I will come alone.\" Then the ape laughed at the idea of  such a little creature presuming to fight with him, but the firefly  continued: \"I shall be expecting you on the plaza about six o'clock  next Sunday afternoon.\" The ape replied: \"You had better bring some one  to help you, as I shall bring my whole company, about a thousand apes,  each as big as myself.\" This he said, thinking to frighten the strange  little insect, who seemed to him to be crazy. But the firefly answered:  \"I shall not need any companions, but will come alone. Good-by.\"    When the firefly had gone, the ape called together his company, and  told them about the proposed fight. He ordered them to get each one  a club about three feet long and to be on the plaza at six o'clock  the next Sunday evening. His companions were greatly amazed, but as  they were used to obeying their captain, they promised to be ready  at the appointed time and place.    On Sunday evening, just before six o'clock, they assembled on the  plaza, and found the firefly already waiting for them. Just then  the church bells rang the Angelus, so the firefly proposed that they  should all pray. Immediately after the prayer, the firefly signified  that he was ready to begin. The ape had drawn up his company in line,  with himself at the head. Suddenly the firefly lighted upon the ape's  nose. The ape next in line struck at the firefly, but succeeded only  in striking the captain such a terrible blow on the nose as to kill  him. The firefly meanwhile, seeing the blow coming, had jumped upon  the nose of the second ape, who was killed by the next in line just  as the captain had been killed; and so on down the whole line, until  there was but one ape left. He threw down his club and begged the  firefly to spare him. The firefly graciously allowed him to live, but  since that time the apes have been in mortal terror of the fireflies.      CHAPTER 21    The Snail and the Deer. [7]    The deer made fun of the snail because of his slowness, so the latter  challenged the former to a race. \"We will race to the well on the other  side of the plaza,\" said the snail. \"All right,\" replied the deer.    On the day of the race the deer ran swiftly to the well, and when  he got there he called, \"Mr. Snail, where are you?\" \"Here I am,\"  said the snail, sticking his head up out of the well. The deer  was very much surprised, so he said: \"I will race you to the next  well.\" \"Agreed,\" replied the snail. When the deer arrived at the  next well, he called as before, \"Mr. Snail, where are you?\" \"Here  I am,\" answered the snail. \"Why have you been so slow? I have been  here a long time waiting for you.\" The deer tried again and again,  but always with the same result; until the deer in disgust dashed  his head against a tree and broke his neck.    Now the first snail had not moved from his place, but he had many  cousins in each of the wells of the town and each exactly resembled  the other. Having heard the crows talking of the proposed race, as  they perched on the edge of the wells to drink, they determined to  help their cousin to win it, and so, as the deer came to each well,  there was always a snail ready to stick his head out and answer,  \"Here I am\" to the deer's inquiry.        CHAPTER 22    Story of Ca Matsin and Ca Boo-Ug. [8]    One day a turtle, whose name was Ca Boo-Ug, and a monkey, Ca Matsin,  met on the shore of a pond. While they were talking, they noticed a  banana plant floating in the water.    \"Jump in and get it,\" said Ca Matsin, who could not swim, \"and we will  plant it, and some day we will have some bananas of our own.\" So Ca  Boo-Ug swam out and brought the plant to shore.    \"Let's cut it in two,\" said Ca Matsin. \"You may have one half and I  will take the other, and then we shall each have a tree.\"    \"All right,\" said Ca Boo-Ug; \"which half will you take?\"    Ca Matsin did not think the roots looked very pretty, and so he  chose the upper part. Ca Boo-Ug knew a thing or two about bananas,  so he said nothing, and each took his part and planted it. Ca Boo-Ug  planted his in a rich place in the garden, but Ca Matsin planted his  in the ashes in the fireplace, because it was easy, and then, too,  he could look at it often and see how pretty it was.    Ca Matsin laughed as he thought how he had cheated Ca Boo-Ug, but  soon his part began to wither and die, and he was very angry.    With Ca Boo-Ug it was different. Before long his tree began to  put forth leaves, and soon it had a beautiful bunch of bananas on  it. But he could not climb the tree to get the bananas, so one day  he went in search of Ca Matsin, and asked him how his banana-tree  was getting along. When Ca Matsin told him that his tree was dead,  Ca Boo-Ug pretended to be very much surprised and sorry, and said:--    \"My tree has a beautiful bunch of bananas on it, but I cannot climb  up to get them. If you will get some of them for me, I will give  you half.\"    Ca Matsin assented, and climbed the tree. When he got to the top, he  pulled a banana, ate it, and threw the skin down to Ca Boo-Ug. Then  he ate another, and another, throwing the skins down on Ca Boo-Ug's  head. When he had eaten all he wanted, he jumped out of the tree and  ran away to the woods, laughing at Ca Boo-Ug. Ca Boo-Ug did not say  anything, but just sat down and thought what he should do to get even  with Ca Matsin. Finally, he gathered a lot of bamboo sticks and planted  them around the tree with the sharp points up, covering them with  leaves so that they could not be seen. Then he sat down and waited.    As soon as Ca Matsin got hungry again, he went around to Ca Boo-Ug's  garden to get some more bananas. Ca Boo-Ug seemed glad to see him,  and when Ca Matsin asked for some bananas, replied:--    \"All right, you may have all you want, but on one condition. When  you jump out of the tree you must not touch those leaves. You must  jump over them.\"    As soon as Ca Matsin heard that he must not jump on the leaves, that  was just what he wanted to do. So when he had eaten all the bananas  he wanted, he jumped out of the tree on to the leaves as hard as he  could jump, and was killed by the sharp bamboo points.    Then Ca Boo-Ug skinned him and cut him up and packed the meat in a  jar of brine and hid it in the mud on the bank of the pond.    In the dry season the banana-trees all died and the cocoanut-trees  bore no fruit, so a troop of monkeys came to Ca Boo-Ug and asked him  if he would give them something to eat.    \"Yes, I have some nice meat in a jar which I will give you, but if  I do, you must promise to eat it with your eyes shut.\"    They were very hungry, so they gave the required promise, and Ca  Boo-Ug gave them the meat. All kept their eyes shut except one,  a little baby, and like all babies, he was very curious and wanted  to see what was going on. So he opened one eye and peeped at a bone  which he had in his hand, then he called out:--    \"Oh, see what I have found! Here is the little finger of my brother,  Ca Matsin!\"    Then all the monkeys looked, and when they found that Ca Boo-Ug had  killed a member of their tribe they were very angry, and looked for  Ca Boo-Ug, in order to kill him. But they could not find him, for  as soon as he saw what had happened he had hidden under a piece of  cocoanut shell which was lying on the ground.    The chief monkey sat upon the cocoanut shell, while he was planning  with his companions how they should catch Ca Boo-Ug, but of  course he did not know where he was, so he called out: \"Where's Ca  Boo-Ug? Where's Ca Boo-Ug?\"    Ca Boo-Ug was so tickled when he heard the monkey ask where he was that  he giggled. The monkeys heard him, and looked all around for him, but  could not find him. Then they called out: \"Where's Ca Boo-Ug? Where's  Ca Boo-Ug?\" This time Ca Boo-Ug laughed out loud, and the monkeys  found him. Then they began to plan how they should punish him.    \"Let's put him into a rice mortar and pound him to death,\" said  one. \"Aha!\" said Ca Boo-Ug, \"that's nothing! My mother beat me so  much when I was little that now my back is so strong that nothing  can break it.\"    When the monkeys found out that Ca Boo-Ug was not afraid of being  pounded in a rice mortar, they determined to try something else."]]]
