This mixing may be done  in the boiler used to melt the tallow, or in a tub, or half an oil  barrel makes a good mixing vessel. Wrap the tub or barrel well up in  blankets or sheepskins, and put away for a week in some warm dry place,  during which the mixture slowly turns into soap, giving a produce of  about 120 pounds of excellent potash soap. If this soap is made with  tallow or grease it will be nearly as hard as soda soap. When made by  farmers or householders tallow or grease will generally be taken, as it  is the cheapest, and ready to hand on the spot. For manufacturers, or  for making laundry soap, nothing could be better than cotton seed oil. A  magnificent soap can be made with this article, lathering very freely.  When made with oil it is better to remelt in a kettle the potash soap,  made according to the above directions, with half its weight of water,  using very little heat, stirring constantly, and removing the fire as  soon as the water is mixed with and taken up by the soap. A beautifully  bright soap is obtained in this way, and curiously the soap is actually  made much harder and stiffer by this addition of water than when it is  in a more concentrated state previously to the water being added.    With reference to the caustic potash for making the soap, it can be  obtained in all sizes of drums, but small packages just sufficient for  a batch of soap are generally more economical than larger packages, as  pure caustic potash melts and deteriorates very quickly when exposed  to the air. The Greenbank Alkali Co., of St. Helens, seems to have  appreciated this, and put upon the market pure caustic potash in twenty  pound canisters, which are very convenient for potash soft soap making  by consumers for their own use.    While on this subject of caustic potash, it cannot be too often repeated  that _caustic potash_ is a totally different article to _caustic soda_,  though just like it in appearance, and therefore often sold as such.  One of the most barefaced instances of this is the so-called \"crystal  potash,\" \"ball potash,\" or \"rock potash,\" of the lye packers, sold in  one pound packages, which absolutely, without exception, do not contain  a single grain of potash, but simply consist of caustic soda more or  less adulterated--as a rule very much \"more\" than \"less!\" It is much  to be regretted that this fraud on the public has been so extensively  practiced, as potash has been greatly discredited by this procedure.    The subject of fleece scouring or washing the wool while growing on  the sheep, with a potash soap made on the spot with the waste tallow  generally to be had on every sheep farm, seems recently to have been  attracting attention in some quarters, and certainly would be a source  of profit to sheep owners by putting their wool on the market in the  best condition, and at the same time cleaning the skin of the sheep. It  therefore appears to be a move in the right direction.    In concluding this series of articles on practical soap making from a  consumer's point of view, the writer hopes that, although the subject  has been somewhat imperfectly handled, owing to necessarily limited  space and with many unavoidable interruptions, yet that they may have  been found of some interest and assistance to consumers of soap who  desire easily and readily to make a pure and unadulterated article for  their own use.           *       *       *       *       *          COTTON SEED OIL.    By S.S. BRADFORD, Ph.G.      Having had occasion during the last six years to manufacture lead  plaster in considerable quantities, it occurred to me that cotton seed  oil might be used instead of olive oil, at less expense, and with as  good results. The making of this plaster with cotton seed oil has been  questioned, as, according to some authorities, the product is not of  good consistence, and is apt to be soft, sticky, and dark colored;  but in my experience such is not the case. If the U. S. P. process is  followed in making this plaster, substituting for the olive oil cotton  seed oil, and instead of one half-pint of boiling water one and one-half  pint are added, the product obtained will be equally as good as that  from olive oil. My results with this oil in making lead plaster led me  to try it in making the different liniments of the Pharmacopoeia, with  the following results:    _Linimentum Ammoniae_.--This liniment, made with cotton seed oil, is of  much better consistency than when made with olive oil. It is not so  thick, will pour easily out of the bottle, and if the ammonia used is of  proper strength, will make a perfect liniment.    _Linimentum Calcis_.--Cotton seed oil is not at all adapted to making  this liniment. It does not readily saponify, separates quickly, and it  is almost impossible to unite when separated.    _Linimentum Camphorae_.--Cotton seed oil is far superior to olive oil in  making this liniment, it being a much better solvent of camphor. It has  not that disagreeable odor so commonly found in the liniment.    _Linimentum Chloroformi_.--Cotton seed oil being very soluble in  chloroform, the liniment made with it leaves nothing to be desired.    _Linimentum Plumbi Subacetatis_.--When liq. plumbi subacet. is mixed  with cotton seed oil and allowed to stand for some time the oil assumes  a reddish color similar to that of freshly made tincture of myrrh. When  the liquor is mixed with olive oil, if the oil be pure, no such change  takes place. Noticing this change, it occurred to me that this would be  a simple and easy way to detect cotton seed oil when mixed with olive  oil. This change usually takes place after standing from twelve to  twenty-four hours. It is easily detected in mixtures containing five  per cent., or even less, of the oils, and I am convinced, after making  numerous experiments with different oils, that it is peculiar to cotton  seed oil.--_American Journal of Pharmacy_.           *       *       *       *       *          THE FOOD AND ENERGY OF MAN.    [Footnote: From a lecture delivered at the Sanitary Congress, at  Newcastle-on-Tyne, September 28, 1882.]    By PROF. DE CHAUMONT, F.R.S.      Although eating cannot be said to be in any way a new fashion, it has  nevertheless been reserved for modern times, and indeed we may say the  present generation, to get a fairly clear idea of the way in which  food is really utilized for the work of our bodily frame. We must not,  however, plume ourselves too much upon our superior knowledge, for  inklings of the truth, more or less dim, have been had through all ages,  and we are now stepping into the inheritance of times gone by, using the  long and painful experience of our predecessors as the stepping-stone  to our more accurate knowledge of the present time. In this, as in many  other things, we are to some extent in the position of a dwarf on the  shoulders of a giant; the dwarf may, indeed, see further than the giant;  but he remains a dwarf, and the giant a giant.    The question has been much discussed as to what the original food of man  was, and some people have made it a subject of excited contention. The  most reasonable conclusion is that man is naturally a frugivorous or  fruit-eating animal, like his cousins the monkeys, whom he still so  much resembles. This forms a further argument in favor of his being  originated in warm regions, where fruits of all kinds were plentiful. It  is pretty clear that the resort to animal food, whether the result of  the pressure of want from failure of vegetable products, or a mere taste  and a desire for change and more appetizing food, is one that took place  many ages ago, probably in the earliest anthropoid, if not in the latest  pithecoid stage. No doubt some advantage was recognized in the more  rapid digestion and the comparative ease with which the hunter or fisher  could obtain food, instead of waiting for the ripening of fruits in  countries which had more or less prolonged periods of cold and inclement  weather. Some anatomical changes have doubtless resulted from the  practice, but they are not of sufficiently marked character to found  much argument upon; all that we can say being that the digestive  apparatus in man seems well adapted for digesting any food that is  capable of yielding nutriment, and that even when an entire change is  made in the mode of feeding, the adaptability of the human system  shows itself in a more or less rapid accommodation to the altered  circumstances.    Food, then, is any substance which can be taken into the body and  applied to use, either in building up or repairing the tissues and  framework of the body itself, or in providing energy and producing  animal heat, or any substance which, without performing those functions  directly, controls, directs, or assists their performance. With this  wide definition it is evident that we include all the ordinary articles  recognized commonly as food, and that we reject all substances  recognized commonly as poisons. But it will also include such substances  as water and air, both of which are essential for nutrition, but are not  usually recognized as belonging to the list of food substances in the  ordinary sense. When we carry our investigation further, we find that  the organic substances may be again divided into two distinct classes,  namely, that which contains nitrogen (the casein), and those that do not  (the butter and sugar).    On ascertaining this, we are immediately struck with the remarkable fact  that all the tissues and fluids of the body, muscles (or flesh),  bone, blood--all, in short, except the fat--contain nitrogen, and,  consequently, for their building up in the young, and for their repair  and renewal in the adult, nitrogen is absolutely required. We therefore  reasonably infer that the nitrogenous substance is necessary for this  purpose."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8564"],[0,"Life and Travels of Mungo Park (#11)"],[1,"happens that the ladies  disagree among themselves, family quarrels sometimes rise to such a  height, that the authority of the husband can no longer preserve peace in  his household. In such cases, the interposition of Mumbo Jumbo is called  in, and is always decisive.    This strange minister of justice, (who is supposed to be either the  husband himself, or some person instructed by him,) disguised in the  dress that has been mentioned, and armed with the rod of public  authority, announces his coming (whenever his services are required) by  loud and dismal screams in the woods near the town. He begins the  pantomime at the approach of night; and as soon as it is dark he enters  the town, and proceeds to the Bentang, at which all the inhabitants  immediately assemble.    It may easily be supposed that this exhibition is not much relished by  the women; for, as the person in disguise is entirely unknown to them,  every married female suspects that the visit may possibly be intended for  herself; but they dare not refuse to appear when they are summoned; and  the ceremony commences with songs and dances, which continue till  midnight, about which time Mumbo fixes on the offender. This unfortunate  victim being thereupon immediately seized, is stripped naked, tied to a  post, and severely scourged, with Mumbo's rod, amidst the shouts and  derision of the whole assembly; and it is remarkable, that the rest of  the women are the loudest in their exclamations on this occasion against  their unhappy sister. Daylight puts an end to this indecent and unmanly  revel.    December 9th. As there was no water to be procured on the road, we  travelled with great expedition until we reached Tambacunda; and  departing from thence early the next morning, the 10th, we reached in the  evening Kooniakary, a town of nearly the same magnitude as Kolor. About  noon on the 11th we arrived at Koojar, the frontier town of Woolli,  towards Bondou, from which it is separated by an intervening wilderness  of two days' journey.    The guide appointed by the King of Woolli being now to return, I  presented him with some amber for his trouble; and having been informed  that it was not possible at all times to procure water in the wilderness,  I made inquiry for men who would serve both as guides and water-bearers  during my journey across it. Three Negroes, elephant-hunters, offered  their services for these purposes, which I accepted, and paid them three  bars each in advance, and the day being far spent, I determined to pass  the night in my present quarters.    The inhabitants of Koojar, though not wholly unaccustomed to the sight of  Europeans, (most of them having occasionally visited the countries on the  Gambia,) beheld me with a mixture of curiosity and reverence, and in the  evening invited me to see a _neobering_, or wrestling match at the  Bentang. This is an exhibition very common in all the Mandingo countries.  The spectators arranged themselves in a circle, leaving the intermediate  space for the wrestlers, who were strong active young men, full of  emulation, and accustomed, I suppose, from their infancy to this sort of  exertion. Being stripped of their clothing, except a short pair of  drawers, and having their skin anointed with oil, or _shea_ butter, the  combatants approached each other on all-fours, parrying with, and  occasionally extending a hand for some time, till at length one of them  sprang forward, and caught his rival by the knee. Great dexterity and  judgment were now displayed; but the contest was decided by superior  strength; and I think that few Europeans would have been able to cope  with the conqueror. It must not be unobserved, that the combatants were  animated by the music of a drum, by which their actions were in some  measure regulated.    The wrestling was succeeded by a dance, in which many performers  assisted, all of whom were provided with little bells, which were  fastened to their legs and arms; and here too the drum regulated their  motions. It was beaten with a crooked stick, which the drummer held in  his right hand, occasionally using his left to deaden the sound, and thus  vary the music. The drum is likewise applied on these occasions to keep  order among the spectators, by imitating the sound of certain Mandingo  sentences: for example, when the wrestling match is about to begin, the  drummer strikes what is understood to signify _ali bae see_,--sit all  down; upon which the spectators immediately seat themselves; and when the  combatants are to begin, he strikes _amuta amuta_,--take hold, take hold.    In the course of the evening I was presented, by way of refreshment, with  a liquor which tasted so much like the strong beer of my native country,  (and very good beer too,) as to induce me to inquire into its  composition; and I learned, with some degree of surprise, that it was  actually made from corn which had been previously malted, much in the  same manner as barley is malted in Great Britain: a root yielding a  grateful bitter was used in lieu of hops, the name of which I have  forgot; but the corn which yields the wort is the _holcus spicatus_ of  botanists.    Early in the morning, (the 12th,) I found that one of the  elephant-hunters had absconded with the money he had received from me in  part of wages; and in order to prevent the other two from following his  example, I made them instantly fill their calabashes (or gourds) with  water, and as the sun rose I entered the wilderness that separates the  kingdoms of Woolli and Bondou.    We had not travelled more than a mile before my attendants insisted on  stopping that they might prepare a saphie, or charm, to ensure us a safe  journey. This was done by muttering a few sentences, and spitting upon a  stone, which was thrown before us on the road. The same ceremony was  repeated three times, after which the Negroes proceeded with the greatest  confidence; every one being firmly persuaded that the stone (like the  scape-goat) had carried with it every thing that could induce superior  powers to visit us with misfortune.    We continued our journey without stopping any more until noon, when we  came to a large tree, called by the natives Neema Tula. It had a very  singular appearance, being decorated with innumerable rags or scraps of  cloth, which persons travelling across the wilderness had, at different  times, tied to the branches; probably, at first, to inform the traveller  that water was to be found near it; but the custom has become so  sanctioned by time, that nobody now presumes to pass without hanging up  something. I followed the example, and suspended a handsome piece of  cloth on one of the boughs; and being told that either a well or pool of  water was at no great distance, I ordered the Negroes to unload the asses  that we might give them corn, and regale ourselves with the provisions we  had brought. In the meantime, I sent one of the elephant-hunters to look  for the well, intending, if water was to be obtained, to rest here for  the night. A pool was found, but the water was thick and muddy, and the  Negro discovered near it the remains of a fire recently extinguished, and  the fragments of provisions, which afforded a proof that it had been  lately visited, either by travellers or banditti. The fears of my  attendants supposed the latter; and believing that robbers lurked near  us, I was persuaded to change my resolution of resting here all night,  and proceed to another watering place, which I was assured we might reach  early in the evening.    We departed accordingly, but it was eight o'clock at night before we came  to the watering place; and being now sufficiently fatigued with so long a  day's journey, we kindled a large fire, and lay down, surrounded by our  cattle, on the bare ground, more than a gun-shot from any bush; the  Negroes agreeing to keep watch by turns to prevent surprise.    I know not indeed that any danger was justly to be dreaded, but the  Negroes were unaccountably apprehensive of banditti during the whole of  the journey. As soon, therefore, as day light appeared, we filled our  _soofroos_ (skins) and calabashes at the pool, and set out for Tallika,  the first town in Bondou, which we reached about eleven o'clock in the  forenoon, (the 13th of December.) I cannot, however, take leave of  Woolli, without observing that I was every where well received by the  natives; and that the fatigues of the day were generally alleviated by a  hearty welcome at night; and although the African mode of living was at  first unpleasant to me, yet I found, at length, that custom surmounted  trifling inconveniences, and made every thing palatable and easy.

Here, an officer belonging to the King of Bondou constantly  resides, whose business it is to give timely information of the arrival  of the caravans; which are taxed according to the number of loaded asses  that arrive at Tallika.
