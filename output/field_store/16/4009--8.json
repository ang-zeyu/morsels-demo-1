She mustn't forestall me, though! However artistic my  list is, it will fall very flat if Muriel gives hers in first. I've got  to finish it somehow to-night and take it to school to-morrow morning.  That's certain!\"    When Merle made up her mind about anything, nothing could move her.  Directly she got home she set to work upon the book-back, and toiled away  at it, utterly ignoring her preparation. In vain Mavis urged the claims  of Latin verbs and Shakespeare recitation.    \"I shan't stop till I've finished this!\" declared Merle stubbornly. \"Not  if I sit up all night over it. Bother the old 'Merchant of Venice' and  beastly Latin verbs! I'll glance through them at breakfast-time and trust  to luck. Surely Miss Mitchell will understand when she knows how busy  I've been over this! I shall give it to her before nine o'clock.\"    \"Can't I help you? I've finished my prep.\"    \"No, thanks! I want it to be entirely my own work.\"    Merle was not so clever at drawing as Mavis, but she contrived to turn  out a very pretty cover all the same. She illuminated 'The Moorings' in  large letters upon it, and painted a picture of a boat moored to a jetty  below, as being an appropriate design. She stitched the typed sheets,  fastened the whole together, and tied it with a piece of saxe-blue ribbon  (saxe was emphatically Miss Mitchell's pet colour), then she printed upon  the back of it, 'With much love from your affectionate pupil Merle  Ramsay.' She sat up over it long after Mavis and Aunt Nellie had gone to  bed, and, indeed, finished it hurriedly under the eyes of Jessop, who was  waiting to turn out the gas.    \"Can't I just look over my Latin?\" implored Merle.    \"Not a word!\" declared the old servant. \"Put those books away, Miss  Merle, and go upstairs. We'll be having you with brain-fever at this  rate! I don't approve of all these home lessons. Why can't they teach you  what they want to in school, I should like to know? That's what teachers  are paid for, isn't it? I've no patience with this continual writing in  the evenings. A nice bit of sewing would be more to my mind. You've not  done more than an inch of that crochet pattern I taught you. Being  monitress is all very well, I daresay, but I'm not going to let you sit  up till midnight, my dearie, over your books. Not if I have to go myself  to Miss Pollard, and tell her my mind about it.\"    Merle had meant to wake up a little earlier and run through her  preparation, but she was sleepier than usual next morning, and had to be  roused by Mavis. She opened her eyes most unwillingly.    \"I never heard Jessop bring the hot water. It can't be half-past seven!  Oh, bother! I'd give all the world to be left quiet in bed! Go away!\"    \"All right! Stop in bed, and let Muriel give her list to Miss Mitchell!\"  said Mavis.    Whereupon Merle groaned, sat up, and began to pull on her stockings.    \"Guess I'll take the wind out of Muriel's sails!\" she murmured.    The list was beautifully wrapped up in a sheet of new tissue-paper, and  Merle carried it proudly to school. Miss Mitchell was generally in the  study from about 8.45 till 9 o'clock, so there would be nice time to  present it before call-over. On this particular morning, however, as fate  would have it, the study was unoccupied. Merle peeped in many times, went  to the hostel, asked the boarders if they had seen Miss Mitchell, but was  utterly unable to find her. She seemed to have mysteriously disappeared,  and only walked in, from no one knew where, just in time to take the  register. The Fifth form marched away to its classroom, and Merle's  offering, for the present, was obliged to be consigned to the recesses of  her desk.    Latin was the first lesson, and as far as she was concerned it was a  dismal failure. Miss Mitchell looked surprised at her ghastly mistakes,  and one or two of the girls glanced at each other. Merle was hot and  flustered at the close of the hour, and closed her books with relief. She  hoped to manage a little better in 'The Merchant of Venice,' which was at  least an English subject. The girls were supposed to learn the notes, and  were questioned upon them and upon the meaning of the passages, and she  trusted to native wit and successful guessing to supply her answers. The  teacher, however, very soon grasped the fact that Merle knew nothing  about the lesson, asked her to recite, and found that she broke down at  the end of three lines.    \"You're absolutely unprepared!\" said Miss Mitchell scathingly. \"A nice  example for a monitress to set to the rest of the form! Come to the study  at eleven, and report yourself! I'm astonished at you, Merle!\"    A very depressed and humiliated monitress entered the study at 'interval'  to receive her scolding.    \"I can't understand you! You have been doing so well. Why have you  suddenly slacked off?\" asked her inquisitor, who believed in getting to  the bottom of things if a girl shirked her work.    Merle, who was too much upset even to mention her reason, and who had  left the offering inside her desk, said nothing, and only looked  unutterably miserable. Matters, therefore, were at rather a deadlock,  when there was a tap at the door and Mavis entered bearing the precious  parcel.    \"Miss Mitchell, _please_! In case Merle won't tell, I've brought  this. She sat up fearfully late last night doing it for you, and that's  why she didn't do her prep. Please excuse me for coming in!\" and Mavis  bolted in much confusion.    Miss Mitchell unwrapped the parcel and looked critically at its contents.    \"It's very kind of you to have made this for me, Merle,\" she said, in a  gentler voice. \"I only wish it hadn't been at the expense of your  preparation. I like the monitresses to do all they can for the school,  but they must remember their own work comes first, and that they have to  set an example to the rest. Don't let a thing like this happen again! I  thought you would have had more discretion. The list could have waited a  day or two. I was not in such a hurry for it as all that. It was kindly  meant, but a little excess of zeal, wasn't it? Thank you for it all the  same! There! I'll put it on my desk so that it will be always ready if I  want to refer to it. Now run along, or you won't have time to eat your  lunch before the bell rings.\"    Merle, hurrying to the dressing-room, inwardly congratulated herself.    \"I got jolly well out of a bad business!\" she thought. \"Miss Mitchell  wasn't very cross after all, and she liked the list! I've got mine in  before Muriel's anyway, and it's going to stay on her desk, so she'll  always have something of mine right under her eyes. She fingered that  saxe-blue ribbon rather lovingly! It exactly matches her sports coat!  I'll make her a calendar for Christmas and put the same kind of ribbon to  hang it up by. But I don't mean to tell a single soul, in case Muriel  goes and does the same! Miss Mitchell is my property, not hers!\"          CHAPTER VI    Fishermaidens      Several Saturdays turned out wet, and it was not until the middle of  October that Mavis and Merle were again able to motor with Dr. Tremayne  to Chagmouth.    They had made arrangements for a nature ramble, so, after an early lunch  at Grimbal's Farm, they went to the trysting-place by the harbour to meet  the other members of the club. Beata and Romola turned up alone to-day,  unencumbered by younger brothers and sisters or the donkey. They had  brought businesslike baskets with them, and were armed with note-books to  record specimens, some apples and nuts, and a couple of log-lines.    \"We might be able to get some fishing!\" they explained eagerly. \"Father  went out yesterday in old Mr. Davis's boat, and he brought home the most  _lovely_ mackerel. Wouldn't it be a surprise if we could get some  for ourselves? I don't see why we shouldn't!\"    The idea appealed to the others. Fish were undoubtedly a division of  zoology and ought to be included in their nature study. Specimens would  be no less scientifically interesting from the fact that they could be  eaten afterwards. Fay instantly rushed into Helyar's General Store to buy  a log-line of her own; Mavis and Merle, after cautiously ascertaining the  cost, invested in one between them, while Tattle, Nan, and Lizzie  contented themselves with purchasing a few fishhooks and a ball of fine  string.    \"I suppose we ought really to take some bait with us,\" remarked Romola  casually. \"There isn't time, though, to go and dig for lob-worms. What's  to be done about it?\"    \"Oh, we'll use limpets or anything else we can get,\" decreed Beata.  \"We'll find something along the rocks, you'll see. Mavis, where are we  going? You know all the best walks. We elect you leader this afternoon.\"    \"It's beautiful along the cliffs towards St Morval's Head. There's a path  most of the way, and we can scramble where there isn't. I wouldn't have  dared to take the children, but I vote we venture it.\"    \"Anywhere you like so long as we don't waste any more time; I'm just  crazy to start!\" agreed Fay.    So they went by a narrow alley and up steep flights of steps to the hill  above the town, and took the track that led along the edge of the cliffs  towards St. Morval's Head. It was a glorious autumn afternoon, and,  though the bracken was brown and withered, there were specimens of wild  flowers to be picked and written down in the note-books. Summer seemed to  have lingered, and had left poppies, honeysuckle, foxgloves, and other  blossoms that were certainly out of season. Tattie, who was keen on  entomology, recorded a red admiral, a clouded yellow butterfly, and a  gamma moth, though she did not consider them worth chasing and catching  for her collection."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7836"],[0,"Jewish History : An Essay in the Philosophy of History (#11)"],[1,"nferences, so the  rabbis now began to use the law book recently canonized as a new basis  of interpretation, and to carry its principles to their utmost  consequences. In this way originated first the \"Palestinian Gemara.\"  Later, when the Patriarchate in Palestine was stripped of its glory by  persecutions, and, in consequence, the centre of activity had to be  transferred from the Talmud academies of Palestine to those of  Babylonia, supreme place and exclusive dominion were obtained by the  \"Babylonian Gemara,\" put into permanent form about the year 500 C. E.,  a gigantic work, the result of two hundred years of mental labor.    This busy intellectual activity was as comprehensive as it was  thoroughgoing. Talmudic legislation, the Halacha, by no means confines  itself to religious practices, extensive as this field is. It embraces  the whole range of civil and social life. Apart from the dietary laws,  the regulations for the festivals and the divine service, and a mass  of enactments for the shaping of daily life, the Talmud elaborated a  comprehensive and fairly well-ordered system of civil and criminal  law, which not infrequently bears favorable comparison with the famous  _rationi scriptae_ of the Romans. While proceeding with extreme  rigor and scrupulousness in ritual matters, the Talmud is governed in  its social legislation by the noblest humanitarian principles.  Doubtless this difference of attitude can be explained by the fact  that religious norms are of very much greater importance for a nation  than judicial regulations, which concern themselves only with the  interests of the individual, and exercise but little influence upon  the development of the national spirit.    The most sympathetic aspects of the Jewish spirit in that epoch are  revealed in the moral and poetic elements of the Talmud, in the Agada.  They are the receptacles into which the people poured all its  sentiments, its whole soul. They are a clear reflex of its inner  world, its feelings, hopes, ideals. The collective work of the nation  and the trend of history have left much plainer traces in the Agada  than in the dry, methodical Halacha. In the Agada the learned jurist  and formalist appears transformed into a sage or poet, conversing with  the people in a warm, cordial tone, about the phenomena of nature,  history, and life. The reader is often thrown into amazement by the  depth of thought and the loftiness of feeling manifested in the Agada.  Involuntarily one pays the tribute of reverence to its practical  wisdom, to its touching legends pervaded by the magic breath of poesy,  to the patriarchal purity of its views. But these pearls are not  strung upon one string, they are not arranged in a complete system.  They are imbedded here and there, in gay variety, in a vast mass of  heterogeneous opinions and sentiments naive at times and at times  eccentric. The reader becomes aware of the thoughts before they are  consolidated. They are still in a fluid, mobile state, still in  process of making. The same vivacious, versatile spirit is revealed in  the Midrashim literature, directly continuing the Agada up to the end  of the middle ages. These two species of Jewish literature, the Agada  and the Midrashim, have a far greater absolute value than the Halacha.  The latter is an official work, the former a national product. Like  every other special legislation, the Halacha is bound to definite  conditions and times, while the Agada concerns itself with the eternal  verities. The creations of the philosophers, poets, and moralists are  more permanent than the work of legislators.    Beautiful as the Agada is, and with all its profundity, it lacks  breadth. It rests wholly on the national, not on a universal basis. It  would be vain to seek in it for the comprehensive universalism of the  Prophets. Every lofty ideal is claimed as exclusively Jewish. So far  from bridging over the chasm between Israel and the other nations,  knowledge and morality served to widen it. It could not be otherwise,  there was no influx of air from without. The national horizon grew  more and more contracted. The activities of the people gathered  intensity, but in the same measure they lost in breadth. It was the  only result to be expected from the course of history in those ages.  Let us try to conceive what the first five centuries of the Christian  era, the centuries during which the Talmud was built up, meant in the  life of mankind. Barbarism, darkness, and elemental outbreaks of man's  migratory instincts, illustrated by the \"great migration of races,\"  are characteristic features of those centuries. It was a wretched  transition period between the fall of the world of antique culture and  the first germinating of a new Christian civilization. The Orient, the  centre and hearth of Judaism, was shrouded in impenetrable darkness.  In Palestine and in Babylonia, their two chief seats, the Jews were  surrounded by nations that still occupied the lowest rung of the  ladder of civilization, that had not yet risen above naive mysticism  in religion, or continued to be immersed in superstitions of the  grossest sort.    In this abysmal night of the middle ages, the lamp of thought was fed  and guarded solely and alone by the Jews. It is not astonishing, then,  that oblivious of the other nations they should have dispensed light  only for themselves. Furthermore, the circumstance must be considered  that, in the period under discussion, the impulse to separate from  Judaism gained ground in the Christian world. After the Council of  Nicaea, after Constantine the Great had established Christianity as  the state-church, the official breach between the Old Testament and  the New Testament partisans became unavoidable.    Thus the Jews, robbed of their political home, created a spiritual  home for themselves. Through the instrumentality of the numberless  religious rules which the Talmud had laid down, and which shaped the  life of the individual as well as that of the community, they were  welded into a firmly united whole. The Jewish spirit--national feeling  and individual mental effort alike--was absorbed in this pursuit of  unification. Head, heart, hands, all human functions of the Jew, were  brought under complete control and cast into fixed forms, by these  five centuries of labor. With painful exactitude, the Talmud  prescribed ordinances for all the vicissitudes of life, yet, at the  same time, offered sufficient food for brain and heart. It was at once  a religion and a science. The Jew was equipped with all the  necessaries. He could satisfy his wants from his own store. There was  no need for him to knock at strange doors, even though he had thereby  profited. The consequences of this attitude, positive as well as  negative consequences, asserted themselves in the further course of  Jewish history.          VIII    THE GAONIC PERIOD, OR THE HEGEMONY OF THE ORIENTAL JEWS (500-980)      With the close of the Talmud, at the beginning of the sixth century,  the feverish intellectual activity abated. The Jewish centre of  gravity continued in Babylonia. In this country, in which the Jewish  race had heard its cradle song at the dawn of existence, and later on  _Judaea capta_ had sat and wept remembering Zion, Judaism, after  the destruction of the second Temple and hundreds of years of trials,  was favored with a secure asylum. In the rest of the diaspora,  persecution gave the Jews no respite, but in Babylonia, under Persian  rule, they lived for some centuries comparatively free from  molestation. Indeed, they enjoyed a measure of autonomy in internal  affairs, under a chief who was entitled Exilarch (_Resh-Galutha_).  The Law and the word of God went forth from Babylonia for the Jews of  all lands. The Babylonian Talmud became the anthoritative code for the  Jewish people, a holy book second only to the Bible. The intellectual  calm that supervened at the beginning of the sixth century and lasted  until the end of the eighth century, betrayed itself in the slackening of  independent creation, though not in the flagging of intellectual activity  in general. In the schools and academies of Pumbeditha, Nahardea,  and Sura, scientific work was carried on with the same zest as before,  only this work had for its primary object the sifting and exposition of  the material heaped up by the preceding generations. This was the  province of the Sabureans and the Geonim, whose relation to the Talmud  was the same as that of the Scribes (the _Soferim_) of the Second  Temple to the Bible (see above, ch. vi). In the later period, as in the  earlier, the aim was the capitalization of the accumulated spiritual  treasures, an undertaking that gives little occasion for movement and  life, but all the more for endurance and industry.    This intellectual balance was destroyed by two events: the appearance  of Islam and the rise of Karaism. Islam, the second legitimate  offspring of Judaism, was appointed to give to religious thought in  the slumbering Orient the slight impulse it needed to start it on its  rapid career of sovereign power. Barely emancipated from swaddling  clothes, young Hotspur at once began to rage. He sought an outlet for  his unconquerable thirst for action, his lust for world-dominion. The  victorious religious wars of the followers of Allah ensued. This  foreign movement was not without significance for the fate of the  Jews. They were surrounded no longer by heathens but by Mohammedans,  who believed in the God of the Bible, and through the mouth of their  prophet conferred upon the Jews the honorable appellation of \"the  People of the Book.\" In the eighth century the wars ceased, and the  impetuous energy of the rejuvenated Orient was diverted into quieter  channels. The Bagdad Khalifate arose, the peaceful era of the growth  of industry, the sciences, and the arts was inaugurated. Endowed with  quick discernment for every enlightening "]]]
