And for the rest of  that night the dogs of the encampment cried out to them and besought them  to come back. But the tribe lay down all round the fire under thick furs  and slept. And a great wind arose and blew into the roaring heart of the  fire till it was red no longer, but all pallid with heat. With the dawn  the tribe awoke.    Loz might have known that after such a mighty conflagration nothing could  remain of his small furry beast, but there was hunger in him and little  reason as he searched among the ashes. What he found there amazed him  beyond measure; there was no meat, there was not even his row of  reddish-brown stones, but something longer than a man's leg and narrower  than his hand, was lying there like a great flattened snake. When Loz  looked at its thin edges and saw that it ran to a point, he picked up  stones to chip it and make it sharp. It was the instinct of Loz to sharpen  things. When he found that it could not be chipped his wonderment  increased. It was many hours before he discovered that he could sharpen  the edges by rubbing them with a stone; but at last the point was sharp,  and all one side of it except near the end, where Loz held it in his hand.  And Loz lifted it and brandished it, and the Stone Age was over. That  afternoon in the little encampment, just as the tribe moved on, the Stone  Age passed away, which, for perhaps thirty or forty thousand years, had  slowly lifted Man from among the beasts and left him with his supremacy  beyond all hope of reconquest.    It was not for many days that any other man tried to make for himself an  iron sword by cooking the same kind of small furry beast that Loz had  tried to cook. It was not for many years that any thought to lay the meat  along stones as Loz had done; and when they did, being no longer on the  plains of Thold, they used flints or chalk. It was not for many  generations that another piece of iron ore was melted and the secret  slowly guessed. Nevertheless one of Earth's many veils was torn aside by  Loz to give us ultimately the steel sword and the plough, machinery and  factories; let us not blame Loz if we think that he did wrong, for he did  all in ignorance. The tribe moved on until it came to water, and there it  settled down under a hill, and they built their huts there. Very soon they  had to fight with another tribe, a tribe that was stronger than they; but  the sword of Loz was terrible and his tribe slew their foes. You might  make one blow at Loz, but then would come one thrust from that iron sword,  and there was no way of surviving it. No one could fight with Loz. And he  became ruler of the tribe in the place of Iz, who hitherto had ruled it  with his sharp axe, as his father had before him.    Now Loz begat Lo, and in his old age gave his sword to him, and Lo ruled  the tribe with it. And Lo called the name of the sword Death, because it  was so swift and terrible.    And Iz begat Ird, who was of no account. And Ird hated Lo because he was  of no account by reason of the iron sword of Lo.    One night Ird stole down to the hut of Lo, carrying his sharp axe, and he  went very softly, but Lo's dog, Warner, heard him coming, and he growled  softly by his master's door. When Ird came to the hut he heard Lo talking  gently to his sword. And Lo was saying, \"Lie still, Death. Rest, rest, old  sword,\" and then, \"What, again, Death? Be still. Be still.\"    And then again: \"What, art thou hungry, Death? Or thirsty, poor old sword?  Soon, Death, soon. Be still only a little.\"    But Ird fled, for he did not like the gentle tone of Lo as he spoke to his  sword.    And Lo begat Lod. And when Lo died Lod took the iron sword and ruled the  tribe.    And Ird begat Ith, who was of no account, like his father.    Now when Lod had smitten a man or killed a terrible beast, Ith would go  away for a while into the forest rather than hear the praises that would  be given to Lod.    And once, as Ith sat in the forest waiting for the day to pass, he  suddenly thought he saw a tree trunk looking at him as with a face. And  Ith was afraid, for trees should not look at men. But soon Ith saw that it  was only a tree and not a man, though it was like a man. Ith used to speak  to this tree, and tell it about Lod, for he dared not speak to any one  else about him. And Ith found comfort in speaking about Lod.    One day Ith went with his stone axe into the forest, and stayed there many  days.    He came back by night, and the next morning when the tribe awoke they saw  something that was like a man and yet was not a man. And it sat on the  hill with its elbows pointing outwards and was quite still. And Ith was  crouching before it, and hurriedly placing before it fruits and flesh, and  then leaping away from it and looking frightened. Presently all the tribe  came out to see, but dared not come quite close because of the fear that  they saw on the face of Ith. And Ith went to his hut, and came back again  with a hunting spear-head and valuable small stone knives, and reached out  and laid them before the thing that was like a man, and then sprang away  from it.    And some of the tribe questioned Ith about the still thing that was like a  man, and Ith said, \"This is Ged.\" Then they asked, \"Who is Ged?\" and Ith  said, \"Ged sends the crops and the rain; and the sun and the moon are  Ged's.\"    Then the tribe went back to their huts, but later in the day some came  again, and they said to Ith, \"Ged is only as we are, having hands and  feet.\" And Ith pointed to the right hand of Ged, which was not as his  left, but was shaped like the paw of a beast, and Ith said, \"By this ye  may know that he is not as any man.\"    Then they said, \"He is indeed Ged.\" But Lod said, \"He speaketh not, nor  doth he eat,\" and Ith answered, \"The thunder is his voice and the famine  is his eating.\"    After this the tribe copied Ith, and brought little gifts of meat to Ged;  and Ith cooked them before him that Ged might smell the cooking.    One day a great thunderstorm came trampling up from the distance and raged  among the hills, and the tribe all hid away from it in their huts. And Ith  appeared among the huts looking unafraid. And Ith said little, but the  tribe thought that he had expected the terrible storm because the meat  that they had laid before Ged had been tough meat, and not the best parts  of the beasts they slew.    And Ged grew to have more honour among the tribe than Lod. And Lod was  vexed.    One night Lod arose when all were asleep, and quieted his dog, and took  his iron sword and went away to the hill. And he came on Ged in the  starlight, sitting still, with his elbows pointing outwards, and his  beast's paw, and the mark of the fire on the ground where his food had  been cooked.    And Lod stood there for a while in great fear, trying to keep to his  purpose. Suddenly he stepped up close to Ged and lifted his iron sword,  and Ged neither hit nor shrank. Then the thought came into Lod's mind,  \"Ged does not hit. What will Ged do instead?\"    And Lod lowered his sword and struck not, and his imagination began to  work on that \"What will Ged do instead?\"    And the more Lod thought, the worse was his fear of Ged.    And Lod ran away and left him.    Lod still ruled the tribe in battle or in the hunt, but the chiefest  spoils of battle were given to Ged, and the beasts that they slew were  Ged's; and all questions that concerned war or peace, and questions of law  and disputes, were always brought to him, and Ith gave the answers after  speaking to Ged by night.    At last Ith said, the day after an eclipse, that the gifts which they  brought to Ged were not enough, that some far greater sacrifice was  needed, that Ged was very angry even now, and not to be appeased by any  ordinary sacrifice.    And Ith said that to save the tribe from the anger of Ged he would speak  to Ged that night, and ask him what new sacrifice he needed.    Deep in his heart Lod shuddered, for his instinct told him that Ged wanted  Lod's only son, who should hold the iron sword when Lod was gone.    No one would dare touch Lod because of the iron sword, but his instinct  said in his slow mind again and again, \"Ged loves Ith. Ith has said so.  Ith hates the sword-holders.\"    \"Ith hates the sword-holders. Ged loves Ith.\"    Evening fell and the night came when Ith should speak with Ged, and Lod  became ever surer of the doom of his race.    He lay down but could not sleep.    Midnight had barely come when Lod arose and went with his iron sword again  to the hill.    And there sat Ged. Had Ith been to him yet? Ith whom Ged loved, who hated  the sword-holders.    And Lod looked long at the old sword of iron that had come to his  grandfather on the plains of Thold.    Good-bye, old sword! And Lod laid it on the knees of Ged, then went away.    And when Ith came, a little before dawn, the sacrifice was found  acceptable unto Ged.          THE IDLE CITY      There was once a city which was an idle city, wherein men told vain tales.    And it was that city's custom to tax all men that would enter in, with the  toll of some idle story in the gate.    So all men paid to the watchers in the gate the toll of an idle story, and  passed into the city unhindered and unhurt. And in a certain hour of the  night when the king of that city arose and went pacing swiftly up and down  the chamber of his sleeping, and called upon the name of the dead queen,  then would the watchers fasten up the gate and go into that chamber to the  king, and, sitting on the floor, would tell him all the tales that they  had gathered. And listening to them some calmer mood would come upon the  king, and listening still he would lie down again and at last fall asleep,  and all the watchers silently would arise and steal away from the chamber.    A while ago wandering, I came to the gate "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/813"],[0,"Reminiscences of Tolstoy, (#11)"],[1,"with the intention of staying only for a day or two; but  when he saw what a call there was for immediate measures, he at once set  to work to help Rayovsky, who had already instituted several kitchens in  the villages, in relieving the distress of the peasantry, at first on  a small scale, and then, when big subscriptions began to pour in from  every side, on a continually increasing one. The upshot of it was that  he devoted two whole years of his life to the work.    It is wrong to think that my father showed any inconsistency in this  matter. He did not delude himself for a moment into thinking he was  engaged on a virtuous and momentous task, but when he saw the sufferings  of the people, he simply could not bear to go on living comfortably at  Yasnaya or in Moscow any longer, but had to go out and help in order to  relieve his own feelings. Once he wrote:      There is much about it that is not what it ought to be; there is S. A.'s  money [22] and the subscriptions; there is the relation of those who  feed and those who are fed. THERE IS SIN WITHOUT END, but I cannot stay  at home and write. I feel the necessity of taking part in it, of doing  something.    Six years later I worked again at the same job with my father in  Tchornski and Mtsenski districts.    After the bad crops of the two preceding years it became clear by the  beginning of the winter of 1898 that a new famine was approaching in our  neighborhood, and that charitable assistance to the peasantry would be  needed. I turned to my father for help. By the spring he had managed to  collect some money, and at the beginning of April he came himself to see  me.    I must say that my father, who was very economical by nature, was  extraordinarily cautious and, I may say, even parsimonious in charitable  matters. It is of course easy to understand, if one considers the  unlimited confidence which he enjoyed among the subscribers and the  great moral responsibility which he could not but feel toward them. So  that before undertaking anything he had himself to be fully convinced of  the necessity of giving aid.    The day after his arrival, we saddled a couple of horses and rode out.  We rode as we had ridden together twenty years before, when we went out  coursing with our greyhounds; that is, across country, over the fields.    It was all the same to me which way we rode, as I believed that all the  neighboring villages were equally distressed, and my father, for the  sake of old memories, wanted to revisit Spasskoye Lyutovinovo, which  was only six miles from me, and where he had not been since Turgenieff's  death. On the way there I remember he told me all about Turgenieff's  mother, who was famous through all the neighborhood for her remarkable  intelligence, energy, and craziness. I do not know that he ever saw  her himself, or whether he was telling me only the reports that he had  heard.    As we rode across the Turgenieff's park, he recalled in passing how of  old he and Ivan Sergeyevitch had disputed which park was best, Spasskoye  or Yasnaya Polyana. I asked him:    \"And now which do you think?\"    \"Yasnaya Polyana IS the best, though this is very fine, very fine  indeed.\"    In the village we visited the head-man's and two or three other  cottages, and came away disappointed. There was no famine.    The peasants, who had been endowed at the emancipation with a full share  of good land, and had enriched themselves since by wage-earnings, were  hardly in want at all. It is true that some of the yards were badly  stocked; but there was none of that acute degree of want which amounts  to famine and which strikes the eye at once.    I even remember my father reproaching me a little for having sounded the  alarm when there was no sufficient cause for it, and for a little while  I felt rather ashamed and awkward before him.    Of course when he talked to the peasants he asked each of them if he  remembered Turgenieff and eagerly picked up anything they had to say  about him. Some of the old men remembered him and spoke of him with  great affection.          MY FATHER'S ILLNESS IN THE CRIMEA    IN the autumn of 1901 my father was attacked by persistent feverishness,  and the doctors advised him to spend the winter in the Crimea. Countess  Panina kindly lent him her Villa Gaspra, near Koreiz, and he spent the  winter there.    Soon after his arrival, he caught cold and had two illnesses one after  the other, enteric fever and inflammation of the lungs. At one time his  condition was so bad that the doctors had hardly any hope that he would  ever rise from his bed again. Despite the fact that his temperature  went up very high, he was conscious all the time; he dictated some  reflections every day, and deliberately prepared for death.    The whole family was with him, and we all took turns in helping to nurse  him. I look back with pleasure on the nights when it fell to me to be on  duty by him, and I sat in the balcony by the open window, listening  to his breathing and every sound in his room. My chief duty, as the  strongest of the family, was to lift him up while the sheets were being  changed. When they were making the bed, I had to hold him in my arms  like a child.    I remember how my muscles quivered one day with the exertion. He looked  at me with astonishment and said:    \"You surely don't find me heavy? What nonsense!\"    I thought of the day when he had given me a bad time at riding in the  woods as a boy, and kept asking, \"You're not tired?\"    Another time during the same illness he wanted me to carry him  down-stairs in my arms by the winding stone staircase.    \"Pick me up as they do a baby and carry me.\"    He had not a grain of fear that I might stumble and kill him. It was all  I could do to insist on his being carried down in an arm-chair by three  of us.    Was my father afraid of death?    It is impossible to answer the question in one word. With his tough  constitution and physical strength, he always instinctively fought not  only against death, but against old age. Till the last year of his life  he never gave in, but always did everything for himself and even rode on  horseback.    To suppose, therefore, that he had no instinctive fear of death is out  of the question. He had that fear, and in a very high degree, but he was  constantly fighting to overcome it.    Did he succeed?    I can answer definitely yes. During his illness he talked a great deal  of death and prepared himself for it firmly and deliberately. When he  felt that he was getting weaker, he wished to say good-by to everybody,  and he called us all separately to his bedside, one after the other, and  gave his last words of advice to each. He was so weak that he spoke in a  half-whisper, and when he had said good-by to one, he had to rest for a  while and collect his strength for the rest.    When my turn came, he said as nearly as I can remember:    \"You are still young and strong and tossed by storms of passion. You  have not therefore yet been able to think over the chief questions of  life. But this stage will pass. I am sure of it. When the time comes,  believe me, you will find the truth in the teachings of the Gospel. I  am dying peacefully simply because I have come to know that teaching and  believe in it. May God grant you this knowledge soon! Good-by.\"    I kissed his hand and left the room quietly. When I got to the front  door, I rushed to a lonely stone tower, and there sobbed my heart out  in the darkness like a child. Looking round at last, I saw that some one  else was sitting on the staircase near me, also crying.    So I said farewell to my father years before his death, and the memory  of it is dear to me, for I know that if I had seen him before his death  at Astapova he would have said just the same to me.    To return to the question of death, I will say that so far from  being afraid of it, in his last days he often desired it; he was  more interested in it than afraid of it. This \"greatest of mysteries\"  interested him to such a degree that his interest came near to love. How  eagerly he listened to accounts of the death of his friends, Turgenieff,  Gay, Leskof, [23] Zhemtchuzhnikof [24]; and others! He inquired after  the smallest matters; no detail, however trifling in appearance, was  without its interest and importance to him.    His \"Circle of Reading,\" November 7, the day he died, is devoted  entirely to thoughts on death.    \"Life is a dream, death is an awakening,\" he wrote, while in expectation  of that awakening.    Apropos of the \"Circle of Reading,\" I cannot refrain from relating a  characteristic incident which I was told by one of my sisters.    When my father had made up his mind to compile that collection of the  sayings of the wise, to which he gave the name of \"Circle of Reading,\"  he told one of his friends about it.    A few days afterward this friend came to see him again, and at once told  him that he and his wife had been thinking over his scheme for the new  book and had come to the conclusion that he ought to call it \"For Every  Day,\" instead of \"Circle of Reading.\"    To this my father replied that he preferred the title \"Circle of  Reading\" because the word \"circle\" suggested the idea of continuous  reading, which was what he meant to express by the title.    Half an hour later the friend came across the room to him and repeated  exactly the same remark again. This time my father made no reply. In  the evening, when the friend was preparing to go home, as he was saying  good-by to my father, he held his hand in his and began once more:    \"Still, I must tell you, Lyoff Nikolaievich, that I and my wife have  been thinking it over, and we have come to the conclusion,\" and so on,  word for word the same.    \"No, no, I want to die--to die as soon as possible,\" groaned my father  when he had seen the friend off.    \"Isn't it all the same whether it's 'Circle of Reading' or 'For Every  Day'? No, it's"]]]
