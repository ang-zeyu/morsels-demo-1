But though we might tolerate the idea that individuals, their desires,  and the gratification of them, are thus sacrificed, and their happiness  given up to the empire of chance, to which it belongs, and that, as a  general rule, individuals come under the category of means to an  ulterior end, there is one aspect of human individuality which we should  hesitate to regard in that subordinate light, even in relation to the  highest, since it is absolutely no subordinate element, but exists in  those individuals as inherently eternal and divine--I mean morality,  ethics, religion. Even when speaking of the realization of the great  ideal aim by means of individuals, the subjective element in them--their  interest and that of their cravings and impulses, their views and  judgments, though exhibited as the merely formal side of their  existence--was spoken of as having an infinite right to be consulted.  The first idea that presents itself in speaking of means is that of  something external to the object, yet having no share in the object  itself. But merely natural things--even the commonest lifeless  objects--used as means, must be of such a kind as adapts them to their  purpose; they must possess something in common with it. Human beings,  least of all, sustain the bare external relation of mere means to the  great ideal aim. Not only do they, in the very act of realizing it, make  it the occasion of satisfying personal desires whose purport is diverse  from that aim, but they share in that ideal aim itself, and are, for  that very reason, objects of their own existence--not formally merely,  as the world of living beings generally is, whose individual life is  essentially subordinate to that of man and its properly used up as an  instrument. Men, on the contrary, are objects of existence to  themselves, as regards the intrinsic import of the aim in question. To  this order belongs that in them which we would exclude from the category  of mere means--morality, ethics, religion. That is to say, man is an  object of existence in himself only in virtue of the Divine that is in  him--the quality that was designated at the outset as Reason, which, in  view of its activity and power of self-determination, was called  freedom. And we affirm--without entering at present on the proof of the  assertion--that religion, morality, etc., have their foundation and  source in that principle, and so are essentially elevated above all  alien necessity and chance. And here we must remark that individuals, to  the extent of their freedom, are responsible for the depravation and  enfeeblement of morals and religion. This is the seal of the absolute  and sublime destiny of man--that he knows what is good and what is evil;  that his destiny is his very ability to will either good or evil--in one  word, that he is the subject of moral imputation, imputation not only of  evil, but of good, and not only concerning this or that particular  matter, and all that happens _ab extra_, but also the good and evil  attaching to his individual freedom. The brute alone is simply innocent.  It would, however, demand an extensive explanation--as extensive as the  analysis of moral freedom itself--to preclude or obviate all the  misunderstandings which the statement that what is called innocence  imports the entire unconsciousness of evil--is wont to occasion.    In contemplating the fate which virtue, morality, even piety experience  in history, we must not fall into the Litany of Lamentations, that the  good and pious often, or for the most part, fare ill in the world, while  the evil-disposed and wicked prosper. The term prosperity is used in a  variety of meanings--riches, outward honor, and the like. But in  speaking of something which in and for itself constitutes an aim of  existence, that so-called well or ill faring of these or those isolated  individuals cannot be regarded as an essential element in the rational  order of the universe. With more justice than happiness--or a fortunate  environment for individuals--it is demanded of the grand aim of the  world's existence that it should foster, nay, involve the execution and  ratification of good, moral, righteous purposes. What makes men morally  discontented (a discontent, by the way, on which they somewhat pride  themselves), is that they do not find the present adapted to the  realization of aims which they hold to be right and just--more  especially, in modern times, ideals of political constitutions; they  contrast unfavorably things as they are, with their idea of things as  they ought to be. In this case it is not private interest nor passion  that desires gratification, but reason, justice, liberty; and, equipped  with this title, the demand in question assumes a lofty bearing and  readily adopts a position, not merely of discontent, but of open revolt  against the actual condition of the world. To estimate such a feeling  and such views aright, the demands insisted upon and the very dogmatic  opinions asserted must be examined. At no time so much as in our own,  have such general principles and notions been advanced, or with greater  assurance. If, in days gone by, history seems to present itself as a  struggle of passions, in our time--though displays of passion are not  wanting--it exhibits, partly a predominance of the struggle of notions  assuming the authority of principles, partly that of passions and  interests essentially subjective but under the mask of such higher  sanctions. The pretensions thus contended for as legitimate in the name  of that which has been stated as the ultimate aim of Reason, pass  accordingly for absolute aims--to the same extent as religion, morals,  ethics. Nothing, as before remarked, is now more common than the  complaint that the ideals which imagination sets up are not realized,  that these glorious dreams are destroyed by cold actuality. These ideals  which, in the voyage of life, founder on the rocks of hard reality may  be in the first instance only subjective and belong to the idiosyncrasy  of the individual, imagining himself the highest and wisest. Such do not  properly belong to this category. For the fancies which the individual  in his isolation indulges cannot be the model for universal reality,  just as universal law is not designed for the units of the mass. These  as such may, in fact, find their interests thrust decidedly into the  background. But by the term \"Ideal\" we also understand the ideal of  Reason--of the good, of the true. Poets--as, for instance,  Schiller--have painted such ideals touchingly and with strong emotion,  and with the deeply melancholy conviction that they could not be  realized. In affirming, on the contrary, that the Universal Reason does  realize itself, we have indeed nothing to do with the individual,  empirically regarded; that admits of degrees of better and worse, since  here chance and speciality have received authority from the Idea to  exercise their monstrous power; much, therefore, in particular aspects  of the grand phenomenon, might be criticized. This subjective  fault-finding--which, however, only keeps in view the individual and its  deficiency, without taking notice of Reason pervading the whole--is  easy; and inasmuch as it asserts an excellent intention with regard to  the good of the whole, and seems to result from a kindly heart, it feels  authorized to give itself airs and assume great consequence. It is  easier to discover a deficiency in individuals, in States, and in  Providence, than to see their real import and value. For in this merely  negative fault-finding a proud position is taken--one which overlooks  the object without having entered into it, without having comprehended  its positive aspect. Age generally makes men more tolerant; youth is  always discontented. The tolerance of age is the result of the ripeness  of a judgment which, not merely as the result of indifference, is  satisfied even with what is inferior, but, more deeply taught by the  grave experience of life, has been led to perceive the substantial,  solid worth of the object in question. The insight, then, to which--in  contradistinction to those ideals--philosophy is to lead us, is, that  the real world is as it ought to be--that the truly good, the universal  divine Reason, is not a mere abstraction, but a vital principle capable  of realizing itself. This Good, this Reason, in its most concrete form,  is God. God governs the world; the actual working of His government, the  carrying out of His plan, is the history of the world. This plan  philosophy strives to comprehend; for only that which has been developed  as the result of it possesses _bona fide_ reality. That which does not  accord with it is negative, worthless existence. Before the pure light  of this divine Idea--which is no mere Ideal--the phantom of a world  whose events are an incoherent concourse of fortuitous circumstances,  utterly vanishes. Philosophy wishes to discover the substantial purport,  the real side of the divine idea, and to justify the so much despised  reality of things; for Reason is the comprehension of the divine work.  But as to what concerns the perversion, corruption, and ruin of  religious, ethical, and moral purposes and states of society generally,  it must be affirmed that, in their essence, these are infinite and  eternal, but that the forms they assume may be of a limited order, and  consequently may belong to the domain of mere nature and be subject to  the sway of chance; they are therefore perishable and exposed to decay  and corruption. Religion and morality--in the same way as inherently  universal essences--have the peculiarity of being present in the  individual soul, in the full extent of their Idea, and therefore truly  and really; although they may not manifest themselves in it "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12380"],[0,"Two Thousand Miles on an Automobile (#12)"],[1,"ahead that we would \"come in,\" like a circus, about twelve, and  friends were on the lookout,--it was four o'clock when we reached  town.    The road is good, gravel nearly every rod, but the steady rain had  softened the surface to the depth of about two inches, and the  water, sand, and gravel were splashed in showers and sheets by the  wheels into and through every exposed part of the mechanism. Soon  the explosions became irregular, and we found the cams operating  the sparker literally plastered over with mud, so that the parts  that should slide and work with great smoothness and rapidity  would not operate at all. This happened about every four or five  miles. This mechanism on this particular machine was so  constructed and situated as to catch and hold mud, and the fine  grit worked in, causing irregularities in the action. This trouble  we could count upon as long as the road was wet; after noon, when  the sun came out and the road began to dry, we had less trouble.    When about half-way to Batavia the spark began to show blue; the  reserve set of dry batteries was put in use, but it gave no better  results. Apparently there was either a short circuit, or the  batteries were used up; the bad showing of the reserve set puzzled  us; every connection was examined and tightened. The wiring of the  carriage was so exposed to the weather that it was found  completely saturated in places with oil and covered with mud. The  rubber insulation had been badly disintegrated wherever oil had  dropped on it. The wires were cleaned as thoroughly as possible  and separated wherever the insulation seemed poor. The loss of  current was probably at the sparking coil; the mud had so covered  the end where the binding parts project as to practically join  them by a wet connection. Cleaning this off and protecting the  binding parts with insulating tape we managed to get on, the spark  being by no means strong, and the reserve battery for some reason  weak.    If we had had a small buzzer, such as is sold for a song at every  electrical store, to say nothing of a pocket voltmeter, we would  have discovered in a moment that the reserve battery contained one  dead cell, the resistance of which made the other cells useless.  At Batavia we tested them out with an ordinary electric bell,  discovering at once the dead cell.    After both batteries are so exhausted that the spark is weak, the  current from both sets can be turned on at the same time in two  ways; by linking the cells in multiples,--that is, side by side,  or in series,--tandem.    The current from cells in multiples is increased in volume but not  in force, and gives a fat spark; the current from cells in series  is doubled in force and gives a long blue hot spark. Both sparks,  if the cells are fresh, will burn the points, though giving much  better explosions.    As the batteries weaken, first connect them in multiples, then, as  they weaken still more, in series.    Always carry a roll of insulating tape, or on a pinch bicycle  tire-tape will do very well. Wrap carefully every joint, and the  binding-posts of the cells for the tape will hold as against  vibration when the little binding-screws will not. In short, use  the tape freely to insulate, protect, and support the wires and  all connections.    If the machine is wired with light and poorly insulated wire, it  is but a question of time when the wiring must be done over again.    When we pulled up in Batavia at an electrician's for repairs, the  Professor was a sight--and also tired. The good man had floundered  about in the mud until he was picturesquely covered. At the outset  he was disposed to take all difficulties philosophically.    \"I should regret exceedingly,\" he remarked at our first  involuntary stop, \"to return from this altogether extraordinary  trip without seeing the automobile under adverse conditions. Our  experiences in the sand were no fault of the machine; the  responsibility rested with us for placing it in a predicament from  which it could not extricate itself, and if, in the heat of the  moment and the sand, I said anything derogatory to the faithful  machine, I express my regrets. Now, it seems, I shall have the  pleasure of observing some of the eccentricities of the horseless  carriage. What seems to be the matter?\" and the Professor peered  vaguely underneath.    \"Something wrong with the spark.\"    \"Bless me! Can you fix it?\"    \"I think so. Now, if you will be good enough to turn that crank.\"    \"With pleasure. What an extraordinary piece of mechanism.--\"    \"A little faster.\"    \"The momentum--\"    \"A little faster.\"    \"Very heavy fly-wheel--\"    \"Just a little faster.\"    \"Friction--mechanics--overcome--\"    \"Now as hard as you can, Professor.\"    \"Exercise, muscle, but hard work. The spark,--is it there? Whew!\"  and the Professor stopped, exhausted.    It was the repetition of those experiences that sobered the  Professor and led him to speak of his work at home, which he  feared he was neglecting. At the last stop he stood in a pool of  water and turned the crank without saying anything that would bear  repetition.    While touring, look out for glass, nails, and the country  mechanic,--of the three, the mechanic can do the largest amount of  damage in a given time. His well-meant efforts may wreck you; his  mistakes are sure to. The average mechanic along the route is a  veritable bull in a china shop,--once inside your machine, and you  are done for. He knows it all, and more too. He once lived next to  a man who owned a naphtha launch; hence his expert knowledge; or  he knew some one who was blown up by gasoline, therefore he is  qualified. Look out for him; his look of intelligence is deception  itself. His readiness with hammer and file means destruction; if  he once gets at the machine, give it to him as a reward and a  revenge for his misdirected energy, and save time by walking.    Even the men from the factory make sad mistakes; they may locate  troubles, but in repairing they will forget, and leave off more  things than the floor will hold.    At Batavia we put in new batteries, repacked the pump, covered the  coil with patent leather, so that neither oil nor water could  affect it, and put on a new chain. Without saying a word, the  bright and too willing mechanic who was assisting, mainly by  looking on, took the new chain into his shop and cut off a link. A  wanton act done because he \"thought the chain a little too long,\"  and not discovered until the machine had been cramped together,  every strut and reach shortened to get the chain in place;  meanwhile the factory was being vigorously blamed for sending out  chains too short. During it all the mechanic was discreetly  silent, but the new link on the vise in the shop betrayed him  after the harm was done.    The run from Batavia to Canandaigua was made over roads that are  well-nigh perfect most of the way, but the machine was not working  well, the chain being too short. Going up stiff grades it was very  apparent something was wrong, for while the motor worked freely  the carriage dragged.    On the level and down grade everything went smoothly, but at every  up grade the friction and waste of power were apparent. Inspection  time and again showed everything clear, and it was not until late  in the afternoon the cause of the trouble was discovered. A  tell-tale mark on the surface of the fly-wheel showed friction  against something, and we found that while the wheel ran freely if  we were out of the machine, with the load in, and especially on up  grades with the chain drawing the framework closer to the running  gear, the rim of the wheel just grazed a bolt-head in a small brace  underneath, thereby producing the peculiar grating noise we had  heard and materially checking the motor. The shortening of the  struts and reaches to admit the short chain had done all this. As  the chain had stretched a little, we were able to lengthen slightly  the struts so as to give a little more clearance; it was also  possible to shift the brace about a quarter of an inch, and the  machine once more ran freely under all conditions.    Within twenty miles of Canandaigua the country is quite rolling  and many of the hills steep. Twice we were obliged to get out and  let the machine mount the grades, which it did; but it was  apparent that for the hills and mountains of New York the gearing  was too high.    On hard roads in a level country high gearing is all well enough,  and a high average speed can be maintained, but where the roads  are soft or the country rolling, a high gear may mean a very  material disadvantage in the long run.    It is of little use to be able to run thirty or forty miles on the  level if at every grade or soft spot it is necessary to throw in  the hill-climbing gear, thereby reducing the speed to from four to  six miles per hour; the resulting average is low. A carriage that  will take the hills and levels of New York at the uniform speed of  fifteen miles an hour will finish far ahead of one that is  compelled to use low gears at every grade, even though the latter  easily makes thirty or forty miles on the level.    The machine we were using had but two sets of gears,--a slow and a  fast. All intermediate speeds were obtained by throttling the  engine. The engine was easily governed, and on the level any speed  from the lowest to the maximum could be obtained without juggling  with the clutches; but on bad roads and in hilly localities  intermediate gears are required if one is to get the best results  out of a motor. As the gasoline motor develops its highest  efficiency when it is running at full speed, there should be  enough intermediate gears so the maximum speed may be maintained  under varying conditions. As the road gets heavy or the grades  steep, the drop is made from one gear down to another; but at all  times and under all conditions--if there are enough intermediate"]]]
