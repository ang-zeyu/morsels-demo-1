The  value of the stock of breeding fish at the hatchery is estimated at  $20,000.    The hatch of salmon trout this season was not far from 1,200,000, and  these will be distributed chiefly in the large lakes of the interior.  About a million little brook trout were produced. The commission doubts  whether much benefit has resulted from attempting to stock small streams  that have once been good trout waters, but the temperature of which has  been changed by cutting away the forest trees that overhung them. The  best results have been attained where the waters are of considerable  extent, especially those in and bordering on the wilderness in the  northern part of the State. The experiments with California trout, have  been very successful, and it is found that the streams most suitable for  them, are the Hudson, Genesee, Mohawk, Moose, Black, and Beaver rivers,  and the East and West Canada creeks. The commission hopes to hatch  6,000,000 or 8,000,000 shad this season at a cost of about $1,000.  Concerning German carp, the commissioners find that the water at  Caledonia is too cold for this fish, but think that carp would do well  in waters further south.    The commission awaits a more liberal appropriation of money before  beginning the work of hatching at the new State fish farm at Cold  Spring, on the north side of Long Island, thirty miles out from  Brooklyn.           *       *       *       *       *          MIOCENE MAN.      Grant Allen, an English evolutionist, gives this imaginary picture  of our supposed ancestor: \"We may not unjustifiably picture him to  ourselves as a tall and hairy creature, more or less erect, but with a  slouching gait, black faced and whiskered, with prominent, prognathous  muzza, and large, pointed canine teeth, those of each jaw fitted into  an interspace in the opposite row. These teeth, as Mr. Darwin suggests,  were used in the combats of the males. His forehead was no doubt low and  retreating, with bony bosses underlying the shaggy eyebrows, which  gave him a fierce expression, something like that of the gorilla. But  already, in all likelihood, he had learned to walk habitually erect, and  had begun to develop a human pelvis, as well as to carry his head more  straight on his shoulders. That some such animal must have existed seems  to me an inevitable corollary from the general principles of evolution  and a natural inference from the analogy of other living genera.\"           *       *       *       *       *          GOULIER'S TUBE-GAUGE.      As well known, the method by which glass barometer tubes are made gives  them variable calibers. Not only do the different tubes vary in size,  but even the same tube is apt to have different diameters throughout  its length, and its sections are not always circular. Manufacturers  of barometers often have need to know exactly the dimensions of the  sections of these tubes, and to ascertain whether they are equal  throughout a certain length of tube, and this is especially necessary in  those instruments in which the surfaces of the sections of the reservoir  and tube must bear a definite ratio to one another. Having ascertained  that no apparatus existed for measuring the caliber of these and  anolagous tubes, and that manufacturers had been accustomed to make the  measurements by roundabout methods, Colonel Goulier has been led to  devise a small apparatus for the purpose, and which is shown in the  accompanying cuts.    [Illustration: GOULIER'S TUBE GAUGE. (Plan and longitudinal and  tranverse sections.)]    The extremity of a brass tube, T, 0.5 to 0.6 of a meter in length and  smaller in diameter than the tube to be gauged, is cut into four narrow  strips a few centimeters in length. The extremity of each of these  strips is bent toward the axis of the tube. Two of them, m and m',  opposite each other are made very flexible, and carry, riveted to their  extremities, two steel buttons, the heads of which, placed in the  interior, have the form of an obtuse quoin with rounded edge directed  perpendicular to the tube's axis. The other extremities of these buttons  are spherical and polished and serve as caliper points in the operation  of measuring. These buttons are given a thickness such that when the  edges of their heads are in contact, the external diameter of the tube  exceeds the distance apart of the two calibrating points by more than  one millimeter. But such distance apart is increased within certain  limits by inserting between the buttons a German silver wedge, L,  carried by a rod, t, which traverses the entire tube, and which is  maneuvered by a head, B, fixed to its extremity. This rod carries a  small screw, v, whose head slides in a groove, r, in the tube, so as  to limit the travel of the wedge and prevent its rotation. Beneath the  head, B, the rod is filed so as to give it a plane surface for the  reception of a divided scale. A corresponding slit in the top of the  tube carries the index, I, of the scale. The principal divisions of the  scale have been obtained experimentally, and traced opposite the index  when the calibrating points were exactly 7, 8, 9 etc., millimeters  apart. As the angle of the wedge is about one tenth, the intervals  between these divisions are about one centimeter. These intervals are  divided into ten parts, each of which corresponds to a variation in  distance of one tenth of a millimeter.    To calibrate a glass tube with this instrument, the tube is laid upon  the table, the gauge is inserted, and the buttons are introduced into  the section desired. The flat side of the head, B, being laid on the  table, arranges, as shown in the figure, the buttons perpendicular to  it. Then the measuring wedge is introduced until a stoppage occurs  through the contact of the buttons with the sides of the tube. Finally,  their distance apart is read on the scale. Such distance apart will be  the measure of a diameter or a chord of the tube's section, according as  the buttons have been kept in the diametral plane or moved out of it. In  order that the operator shall not be obliged to watch the position of  the line of calibrating buttons in obtaining the diameter, the following  arrangement has been devised: The sides of the measuring wedge are filed  off to a certain angle, and the ends of the corresponding strips, d and  d', are bent inward in the form of hooks, whose extremities always rest  on the faces of the directing wedges. The length of these hooks and the  angle of the wedge are such that the distance apart of the rounded backs  of the directing strips is everywhere less, by about one-thirtieth, than  that of the calibrating buttons. From this it will be seen that if the  wedge be drawn back, and inserted again after the tube has been turned,  we shall measure the diameter that is actually vertical. It becomes  possible, then, to determine the greatest and smallest diameters in a  few minutes; and, supposing the section elliptical, its area will be  obtained by multiplying the product of these two diameters by pi/4.    From the description here given it will be seen that Colonel Goulier's  apparatus is not only convenient to use, but also permits of obtaining  as accurate results as are necessary. Two sizes of the instrument are  made, one for diameters of from 7 to 10.5 mm., and the other for those  of from 10 to 15.5 mm. It is the former of these that is shown, of  actual size, in the cuts.           *       *       *       *       *          SOLDERING WITHOUT AN IRON.      The following method for soldering without the use of a soldering iron  is given in the _Techniker_:    The parts to be joined are made to fit accurately, either by filing  or on a lathe. The surfaces are moistened with the soldering fluid, a  smooth piece of tin foil laid on, and the pieces pressed together and  tightly wired. The article is then heated over the fire or by means of  a lamp until the tin foil melts. In this way two pieces of brass can be  soldered together so nicely that the joint can scarcely be found.    With good soft solder, nearly all kinds of soldering can be done over  a lamp without the use of a \"copper.\" If several piaces have to  be soldered on the same piece, it is well to use solder of unlike  fusibility. If the first piece is soldered with fine solder composed of  2 parts of lead, 1 of tin, and 2 of bismuth, there is no danger of its  melting when another place near it is soldered with bismuth solder, made  of 4 parts of lead, 4 of tin, and 1 of bismuth, for their melting points  differ so much that the former will not melt when the latter does. Many  solders do not form any malleable compounds.    In soldering together brass, copper, or iron, hard solder must be  employed; for example, a solder made of equal parts of brass and silver  (!). For iron, copper, or brass of high melting point, a good solder is  obtained by rolling a silver coin out thin, for it furnishes a tenacious  compound, and one that is not too expensive, since silver stretches out  well. Borax is the best flux for hard soldering. It dissolves the oxides  which form on the surface of the metal, and protects it from further  oxidation, so that the solder comes into actual contact with the  surfaces of the metal. For soft soldering, the well-known fluid, made by  saturating equal parts of water and hydrochloric acid with zinc, is to  be used. In using common solder rosin is the cheapest and best flux. It  also has this advantage, that it does not rust the article that it is  used on.--_Deutsche Industrie Zeitung_.           *       *       *       *       *          WORKING COPPER ORES AT SPENCEVILLE.      From a letter in the Grass Valley _Tidings_ we make the following  extracts:    The Spenceville Copper Mining Company have 43 acres of copper-bearing  ground and 100"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8467"],[0,"Frost's Laws and By-Laws of American Society (#11)"],[1,"as soon as possible (certainly the  next day) after the receipt of the invitation, that the hostess  may have time to summon other guests in the stead of those  declining her first invitations.    After an invitation is once accepted, it should be scrupulously  observed. Nothing but the most absolute necessity should prevent  you from going, and when such necessity arises, it should be  communicated directly, with a full explanation of the preventing  cause even if it is within half an hour of the appointed dinner  time. If earlier, send the explanation as soon as possible.    Invitations to dinner and the answers must be sent by a special  messenger. The post is proverbially uncertain, and the non-arrival  of an expected invitation or its answer, may cause lasting  offence.    It is a breach of etiquette, to say nothing of practical  inconvenience, to bring an unassorted company together at dinner.  Great people, public characters, literary celebrities or  distinguished guests from any cause should not be invited merely  because they are such. They will be uncomfortable if the guests  summoned to meet them are not congenial, and the remainder of your  company equally so. No one guest should be too conspicuous. A  harmonious blending of tastes and qualities should be the object  in view. Persons moving in one circle of society should not, as a  general rule, be invited to meet those who move in another circle.  A man of strong political bias in one direction, should not be  invited to meet a party opposed to his views; persons of known and  marked differences in religious matters should not be invited to  meet each other, and above all, avoid the social collision of  those whom you know to be personal enemies. The best guide in such  matters is common sense, coupled with a little judicious  forethought.    Invitations to large balls should be sent out at least a fortnight  before the time appointed, and are worded thus:    \"Mrs. L---'s compliments to Miss G---, and requests the pleasure  of her company at a ball, on Wednesday, the 7th of March, at 9  o'clock.\"    The answer is as follows:    \"Miss G---'s compliments to Mrs. L---, and accepts with pleasure  her kind invitation for Wednesday, March 7th.\"    Or,    \"Miss G--- regrets a recent death in her family will prevent her  accepting Mrs. L---'s kind invitation for March 7th.\"    An invitation to an evening party is worded:    \"Mrs. S--- compliments to Mr. and Mrs. T---, and requests the  pleasure of their company on March 9th, at 8 o'clock.\"    Such an invitation calls for full evening dress. The answer is the  same as for a ball invitation.    Invitations to pic-nics, private theatricals, concerts, tea  parties and other entertainments, generally state the nature of  such entertainment, and are a little less formal than those  already given.    For a musical party:    \"Mrs. R-- requests the pleasure of Mr. and Mrs. P---'s company, on  Thursday evening, Feb. 10th, at 8 o'clock, to meet the members of  the Harmonia Musical Society.\"    And if you have a programme of the concert, enclose it.    Or,    \"Mrs. F--- expects a few friends on Monday evening next, at 8  o'clock, to take part in some dramatic readings, and would be  happy to have Miss B--- join the party.\"    Or,    \"Mrs. S---'s compliments to Miss P---, and would be pleased to  have her join a pic-nic party to Pine Grove, on Wednesday, June  14th. Carriages start from Mrs. S---'s at 9 o'clock, and a place  will be reserved for Miss P---.\"    Notes of invitation must always be dated, and your address in full  written in one corner, thus:    \"Feb. 6th, 18--.  \"Miss M---. requests the pleasure of Miss N---'s company to a  small evening party, on Friday evening next, at 8 o'clock.  \"No. 762 R--- Street.\"    The body of the invitation must be in the middle of the sheet, and  date a little above to the right, the address a little below to  the left.    The envelopes containing invitations must be directed always to  the private residence of the person invited, never to a place of  business or office.    When the officers of a regiment or a ship are invited to an  entertainment, and it is not possible to invite them all, it is  customary to send an invitation to the Colonel or Commander,  accompanied by a certain number of blank tickets, if it be a  public ball, or by an intimation that the host would be glad to  see Colonel or Captain --- and so many of the officers of the  regiment or ship.    Invitations by a regiment to a ball, to be given by the officers,  are worded as follows:    \"Col. and the officers of the --- Regiment, U. S. A. (or other  branch of the service), request the pleasure of Mr. and Mrs. C---  's company on the 7th of December, at 9 o'clock.  \"R--- Barracks, corner of --- and --- Streets.\"    Answers should be addressed to the Colonel of the regiment, and  worded thus:    \"Mr. and Mrs. C's compliments to Colonel -- and the officers of  the - Regiment, U. S. A., and accept with pleasure their polite  invitation for the 7th of December.\"    In case an officer desires to invite his personal friends, he  encloses his own card in the invitation, but these must all be  issued in the form already given, the card explaining to which  officer the compliment is to be attributed.    Invitations to a Naval ball are issued in the name of the \"Captain  and officers of the U. S. Ship ---,\" or simply in the name of \"The  Officers of the U. S. Ship ---.\"    On the corner of the card the name of the officer to whom the  answers are to be sent, should be written.    An officer of higher rank, or a public official of high position,  will signify on his card what aide-de-camp or clerk is to receive  the answers to his invitations, and will issue them in the joint  name of himself and wife, thus:    \"General and Mrs. E--- request the pleasure of Mr. and Mrs. D---'s  company, on Thursday, the 6th of November, at 8 o'clock.  \"Direct answers to Capt. E. C---.\"    Verbal invitations are given only when the occasion is a very  informal one, and imply plain dress, early hours and a small  company.    Invitations to concerts, theatre or opera, should be sent in time  to secure good seats, if accepted, The usual style is:    \"Mr. G would be much pleased to have Mrs. and Miss Hunt's company  at the opera, on Wednesday evening, when La Trovatore will be  performed by the Italian troupe at the Academy of Music.\"    Such an invitation calls for an immediate answer from the elder  lady, and should be as follows:    \"Mrs. and Miss Hunt accept with pleasure Mr. G---'s polite  invitation to listen to a favorite opera on Wednesday evening.\"    Or if declined:    \"Mrs. Hunt regrets that a prior engagement will prevent her own  and Miss Hunt's acceptance of Mr. G---'s polite invitation for  Wednesday evening.\"    For a general reception, invitations are printed upon cards, thus:    \"Wednesday Evening, January 14th, No. 348 --- STREET.\"    Such cards do not require any answer.      DINNER COMPANY.    ON no occasion is a want of punctuality more ill-bred than at a  dinner party, whether it is the guests who are late, or the  hostess who allows dinner to be later than the time appointed.  Belie remarks, with as much truth as sarcasm:    \"I have always been punctual to the hour of dinner, for I know  that those whom I kept waiting would employ those unpleasant  moments to sum up all my faults.\"    To arrive too early is to annoy the lady of the house by  disturbing her at her toilet.    To arrive too late is injurious to the dinner, to the temper of  your host, of the other guests and of the servants.    It is really a sad breach of etiquette to be later than the hour  named in your invitation for dinner, and from ten to fifteen  minutes before it is quite soon enough for your arrival.    As regards the hour for dinner, etiquette, strictly so called, has  not prescribed anything. Custom, the fashion, convenience, a score  of things may control it. From five to eight o'clock, according  somewhat to the season of the year, is the present fashionable  limit. By that time the business of most men is over for the day,  which can scarcely be said of an hour earlier than five.    The lady of the house should be in her drawing-room, ready to  receive her guests, ten or fifteen minutes before the hour fixed  for their arrival, and the daughters of the house should be with  her, and not drop in one by one after the guests' arrival. The  gentleman of the house should also be present, and in case it is a  strictly gentleman's party, at which no hostess presides, he must  be all ready before the appointed time to do the honors.    On guests being announced, the lady advances a few steps towards  them, and should receive them cordially with some words of  welcome.    The hostess must never betray any chagrin at the lateness of a  guest, but try to place the unfortunate last arrival as much at  ease as possible by her cordial welcome and unembarrassed manner.    Before all the guests have arrived the lady should have made her  arrangements as to what gentleman and lady are to go in to dinner  together, and before dinner is announced the gentlemen of the  party should be informed what lady they are to escort to the  table.    The gentleman of the house offers his arm to the lady most honored  amongst the guests, the gentleman most distinguished offers his  arm to the lady of the house.    Gentlemen give the left arm to a lady, excepting military officers  in full dress, who give the right arm, as the sword is  inconveniently worn for offering the left. In all other cases the  right arm must be left free.    The order of procession being settled, the company move according  to it from the drawing-room to the dining-room, as soon as dinner  is announced.    The host sits at the bottom of the table, the hostess at the top.  At the right of the host is placed the lady he escorted from the  drawing-room, and at the right of the hostess her"]]]
