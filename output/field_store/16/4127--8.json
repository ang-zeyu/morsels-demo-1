Most of the emigrants leaving India go out under contract  and the terms must be approved by the agent of the government.    The fact that the government and the benevolent people of Europe  and America have twice within the last ten years been compelled to  intervene to save the people of India from perishing of starvation  has created an impression that they are always in the lowest  depths of distress and continually suffering from any privations.  This is not unnatural, and might under ordinary circumstances  be accepted as conclusive proof of the growing poverty of the  country and the inability of the people to preserve their own  lives. Such a conclusion, however, is very far from the fact, and  every visitor to India from foreign lands has a surprise awaiting  him concerning its condition and progress. When three-fifths of  a population of 300,000,000 have all their eggs in one basket  and depend entirely upon little spots of soil for sustenance,  and when their crops are entirely dependent upon the rains, and  when for a succession of years the rains are not sufficient,  there must be failures of harvest and a vast amount of suffering  is inevitable. But the recuperative power of the empire is  astonishing.    Although a famine may extend over its total length and breadth  one season, and require all the resources of the government to  prevent the entire population from perishing, a normal rainfall  will restore almost immediate prosperity, because the soil is so  rich, the sun is so hot, and vegetation is so rapid that sometimes  three and even four crops are produced from the same soil in a  single year. All the people want in time of famine is sufficient  seed to replant their farms and food enough to last them until  a crop is ripe. The fact that a famine exists in one part of  the country, it must also be considered, is no evidence that  the remainder of the empire is not abounding in prosperity, and  every table of statistics dealing with the material conditions of  the country shows that famine and plague have in no manner impeded  their progress. On the other hand they demonstrate the existence  of an increased power of endurance and rapid recuperation, which,  compared with the past, affords ground for hope and confidence  of an even more rapid advance in the future.    Comparing the material condition of India in 1904 with what it  was ten years previous, we find that the area of soil under  cultivation has increased 229,000,000 acres. What we call internal  revenue has increased 17 per cent during the last ten years; sea  borne foreign commerce has risen in value from L130,500,000 to  L163,750,000; the coasting trade from L48,500,000 to L63,000,000,  and the foreign trade by land from L5,500,000 to L9,000,000.  Similar signs of progress and prosperity are to be found in the  development of organized manufactures, in the increased investment  of capital in commerce and industry, in dividends paid by various  enterprises, in the extended use of the railways, the postoffice  and the telegraph. The number of operatives in cotton mills has  increased during the last ten years from 118,000 to 174,000, in  jute mills from 65,000 to 114,000, in coal and other mines from  35,000 to 95,000, and in miscellaneous industries from 184,000  to 500,000. The railway employes have increased in number from  284,000 to 357,000 in ten years.    A corresponding development and improvement is found in all lines  of investment. During the ten years from 1894 to 1904 the number  of joint stock companies having more than $100,000 capital has  increased from 950 to 1,366, and their paid up capital from  L17,750,000 to L24,500,000. The paid in capital of banks has  advanced from L9,000,000 to L14,750,000; deposits have increased  from L7,500,000 to L23,650,000, and the deposits in postal savings  banks from L4,800,000 to L7,200,000, which is an encouraging  indication of the growth of habits of thrift. The passenger traffic  on the railways has increased from 123,000,000 to 195,000,000,  and the freight from 20,000,000 to 34,000,000 tons. The number of  letters and parcels passing through the postoffice has increased  during the ten years from 340,000,000 to 560,000,000; the postal  money orders from L9,000,000 to L19,000,000, and the telegraph  messages from 3,000,000 to 5,000,000 in number.    The income tax is an excellent barometer of prosperity. It exempts  ordinary wage earners entirely--persons with incomes of less than  500 rupees, a rupee being worth about 33 cents of our money.  The whole number of persons paying the income tax has increased  from 354,594 to 495,605, which is about 40 per cent in ten years,  and the average tax paid has increased from 37.09 rupees to 48.68  rupees. The proceeds of the tax have increased steadily from  year to year, with the exception of the famine years.    There are four classifications of taxpayers, and the proportion  paid by each during the last year, 1902, was as follows:                                             Per cent.    Salaries and pensions                      29.07    Dividends from companies and business       7.22    Interest on securities                      4.63    Miscellaneous sources of income            59.08    The last item is very significant. It shows that nearly 60 per  cent of the income taxpayers of India are supported by miscellaneous  investments other than securities and joint stock companies. The  item includes the names of merchants, individual manufacturers,  farmers, mechanics, professional men and tradesmen of every class.    The returns of the postal savings banks show the following classes  of depositors:                                               Number.    Wage earners                             352,349    Professional men with fixed incomes      233,108    Professional men with variable incomes    58,130    Domestics, or house servants             151,204    Tradesmen                                 32,065    Farmers                                   12,387    Mechanics                                 27,450    The interest allowed by the savings bank government of India is  3-1/2 per cent.    Considering the awful misfortunes and distress which the country  has endured during the last ten years, these facts are not only  satisfactory but remarkable, and if it can progress so rapidly  during times of plague and famine, what could be expected from  it during a cycle of seasons of full crops.    During the ten years which ended with 1894 the seasons were all  favorable, generally speaking, although local failures of harvests  occurred here and there in districts of several provinces, but  they were not sufficient in area, duration or intensity to affect  the material conditions of the people. The ten succeeding years,  however, ending with 1904 witnessed a succession of calamities  that were unprecedented either in India or anywhere else on earth,  with the exception of a famine that occurred in the latter part  of the eighteenth century. Those ten years not only saw two of  the worst famines, but repeated visitations of widespread and  fatal epidemics. It is estimated that during the ten years ending  December, 1903, a million and a half of deaths were caused by the  bubonic plague alone, and that the mortality from that pestilence  was small in comparison with that caused by cholera, fever and  famine. The effects of those epidemics had been to hamper trade,  to alarm and demoralize the people, to obstruct foreign commerce,  prevent investments and the development of material resources.  Yet during the years 1902 and 1903 throughout all India there  was abundant prosperity. This restoration of prosperity is most  noticeable in several of the districts that suffered most severely  from famine. To a large measure the agricultural population have  been restored to their normal condition.    It is difficult in a great country like India where wages are  so small and the cost of living is so insignificant compared  with our own country, to judge accurately of the condition of  the laboring classes. The empire is so vast and so diverse in  all its features that a statement which may accurately apply  to one province will misrepresent another. But, taking one  consideration with another, as the song says, and drawing an  average, it is plainly evident that the peasant population of  India is slowly improving in condition. The scales of wages have  undoubtedly risen; there has been an improvement in the housing  and the feeding of the masses; their sanitary condition has been  radically changed, although they have fought against it, and  the slow but gradual development of the material resources of  the country promises to make the improvement permanent.    The chief source of revenue in India from ancient times has been  a share in the crops of the farmers. The present system has been  handed down through the centuries with very little modification, and  as three-fifths of the people are entirely and directly dependent  upon the cultivation of the land, the whole fabric of society  has been based upon that source of wealth. The census gives  191,691,731 people as agriculturists, of whom 131,000,000 till  their own or rented land, 18,750,000 receive incomes as landlord  owners and the remainder are agricultural laborers. The landlord  caste are the descendants of hereditary chiefs, of former revenue  farmers and persons of importance to whom land grants were made  in ancient times. Large tracts of land in northern India are  owned by municipalities and village communities, whose officials  receive the rents and pay the taxes. Other large tracts have  been inherited from the invaders and conquerors of the country.  It is customary in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11224"],[0,"Utilitarianism (#12)"],[1,"of opinion, it seems to  be universally admitted that there may be unjust laws, and that law,  consequently, is not the ultimate criterion of justice, but may give to  one person a benefit, or impose on another an evil, which justice  condemns. When, however, a law is thought to be unjust, it seems always  to be regarded as being so in the same way in which a breach of law is  unjust, namely, by infringing somebody's right; which, as it cannot in  this case be a legal right, receives a different appellation, and is  called a moral right. We may say, therefore, that a second case of  injustice consists in taking or withholding from any person that to  which he has a _moral right_.    Thirdly, it is universally considered just that each person should  obtain that (whether good or evil) which he _deserves_; and unjust that  he should obtain a good, or be made to undergo an evil, which he does  not deserve. This is, perhaps, the clearest and most emphatic form in  which the idea of justice is conceived by the general mind. As it  involves the notion of desert, the question arises, what constitutes  desert? Speaking in a general way, a person is understood to deserve  good if he does right, evil if he does wrong; and in a more particular  sense, to deserve good from those to whom he does or has done good, and  evil from those to whom he does or has done evil. The precept of  returning good for evil has never been regarded as a case of the  fulfilment of justice, but as one in which the claims of justice are  waived, in obedience to other considerations.    Fourthly, it is confessedly unjust to _break faith_ with any one: to  violate an engagement, either express or implied, or disappoint  expectations raised by our own conduct, at least if we have raised those  expectations knowingly and voluntarily. Like the other obligations of  justice already spoken of, this one is not regarded as absolute, but as  capable of being overruled by a stronger obligation of justice on the  other side; or by such conduct on the part of the person concerned as is  deemed to absolve us from our obligation to him, and to constitute a  _forfeiture_ of the benefit which he has been led to expect.    Fifthly, it is, by universal admission, inconsistent with justice to be  _partial_; to show favour or preference to one person over another, in  matters to which favour and preference do not properly apply.  Impartiality, however, does not seem to be regarded as a duty in itself,  but rather as instrumental to some other duty; for it is admitted that  favour and preference are not always censurable, and indeed the cases in  which they are condemned are rather the exception than the rule. A  person would be more likely to be blamed than applauded for giving his  family or friends no superiority in good offices over strangers, when he  could do so without violating any other duty; and no one thinks it  unjust to seek one person in preference to another as a friend,  connexion, or companion. Impartiality where rights are concerned is of  course obligatory, but this is involved in the more general obligation  of giving to every one his right. A tribunal, for example, must be  impartial, because it is bound to award, without regard to any other  consideration, a disputed object to the one of two parties who has the  right to it. There are other cases in which impartiality means, being  solely influenced by desert; as with those who, in the capacity of  judges, preceptors, or parents, administer reward and punishment as  such. There are cases, again, in which it means, being solely influenced  by consideration for the public interest; as in making a selection among  candidates for a Government employment. Impartiality, in short, as an  obligation of justice, may be said to mean, being exclusively influenced  by the considerations which it is supposed ought to influence the  particular case in hand; and resisting the solicitation of any motives  which prompt to conduct different from what those considerations would  dictate.    Nearly allied to the idea of impartiality, is that of _equality_; which  often enters as a component part both into the conception of justice and  into the practice of it, and, in the eyes of many persons, constitutes  its essence. But in this, still more than in any other case, the notion  of justice varies in different persons, and always conforms in its  variations to their notion of utility. Each person maintains that  equality is the dictate of justice, except where he thinks that  expediency requires inequality. The justice of giving equal protection  to the rights of all, is maintained by those who support the most  outrageous inequality in the rights themselves. Even in slave countries  it is theoretically admitted that the rights of the slave, such as they  are, ought to be as sacred as those of the master; and that a tribunal  which fails to enforce them with equal strictness is wanting in justice;  while, at the same time, institutions which leave to the slave scarcely  any rights to enforce, are not deemed unjust, because they are not  deemed inexpedient. Those who think that utility requires distinctions  of rank, do not consider it unjust that riches and social privileges  should be unequally dispensed; but those who think this inequality  inexpedient, think it unjust also. Whoever thinks that government is  necessary, sees no injustice in as much inequality as is constituted by  giving to the magistrate powers not granted to other people. Even among  those who hold levelling doctrines, there are as many questions of  justice as there are differences of opinion about expediency. Some  Communists consider it unjust that the produce of the labour of the  community should be shared on any other principle than that of exact  equality; others think it just that those should receive most whose  needs are greatest; while others hold that those who work harder, or who  produce more, or whose services are more valuable to the community, may  justly claim a larger quota in the division of the produce. And the  sense of natural justice may be plausibly appealed to in behalf of every  one of these opinions.    Among so many diverse applications of the term Justice, which yet is not  regarded as ambiguous, it is a matter of some difficulty to seize the  mental link which holds them together, and on which the moral sentiment  adhering to the term essentially depends. Perhaps, in this  embarrassment, some help may be derived from the history of the word, as  indicated by its etymology.    In most, if not in all languages, the etymology of the word which  corresponds to Just, points to an origin connected either with positive  law, or with that which was in most cases the primitive form of  law-authoritative custom. _Justum_ is a form of _jussum_, that which has  been ordered. _Jus_ is of the same origin. _Dichanou_ comes from  _dichae_, of which the principal meaning, at least in the historical  ages of Greece, was a suit at law. Originally, indeed, it meant only the  mode or _manner_ of doing things, but it early came to mean the  _prescribed_ manner; that which the recognized authorities, patriarchal,  judicial, or political, would enforce. _Recht_, from which came _right_  and _righteous_, is synonymous with law. The original meaning, indeed,  of _recht_ did not point to law, but to physical straightness; as  _wrong_ and its Latin equivalents meant twisted or tortuous; and from  this it is argued that right did not originally mean law, but on the  contrary law meant right. But however this may be, the fact that _recht_  and _droit_ became restricted in their meaning to positive law, although  much which is not required by law is equally necessary to moral  straightness or rectitude, is as significant of the original character  of moral ideas as if the derivation had been the reverse way. The courts  of justice, the administration of justice, are the courts and the  administration of law. _La justice_, in French, is the established term  for judicature. There can, I think, be no doubt that the _idee mere_,  the primitive element, in the formation of the notion of justice, was  conformity to law. It constituted the entire idea among the Hebrews, up  to the birth of Christianity; as might be expected in the case of a  people whose laws attempted to embrace all subjects on which precepts  were required, and who believed those laws to be a direct emanation from  the Supreme Being. But other nations, and in particular the Greeks and  Romans, who knew that their laws had been made originally, and still  continued to be made, by men, were not afraid to admit that those men  might make bad laws; might do, by law, the same things, and from the  same motives, which, if done by individuals without the sanction of law,  would be called unjust. And hence the sentiment of injustice came to be  attached, not to all violations of law, but only to violations of such  laws as _ought_ to exist, including such as ought to exist but do not;  and to laws themselves, if supposed to be contrary to what ought to be  law. In this manner the idea of law and of its injunctions was still  predominant in the notion of justice, even when the laws actually in  force ceased to be accepted as the standard of it.    It is true that mankind consider the idea of justice and its obligations  as applicable to many things which neither are, nor is it desired that  they should be, regulated by law. Nobody desires that laws should  interfere with the whole detail of private life; yet every one allows  that in all daily conduct a person may and does show himself to be  either just or unjust. But even here, the idea of the breach of what  ought to be law, still lingers in a modified shape. It would always give  us pleasure, and chime in with our feelings of fitness, that acts which  we deem unjust should be punished, though we do not always think it  expedient"]]]
