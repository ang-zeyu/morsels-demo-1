His legs were convulsed and his head from time to time started  involuntarily, but he never showed the least desire to raise it from  the ground. He breathed hard and emitted foam from his mouth. The  startings, or _subsultus tendinum_, now became gradually weaker and  weaker; his hinder parts were fixed in death, and in a minute or two  more his head and fore-legs ceased to stir.    Nothing now remained to show that life was still within him except that  his heart faintly beat and fluttered at intervals. In five and twenty  minutes from the time of his being wounded he was quite dead. His flesh  was very sweet and savoury at dinner.    On taking a retrospective view of the two different kinds of poisoned  arrows, and the animals destroyed by them, it would appear that the  quantity of poison must be proportioned to the animal, and thus those  probably labour under an error who imagine that the smallest particle  of it introduced into the blood has almost instantaneous effects.    Make an estimate of the difference in size betwixt the fowl and the ox,  and then weigh a sufficient quantity of poison for a blow-pipe arrow,  with which the fowl was killed, and weigh also enough poison for three  wild-hog arrows, which destroyed the ox, and it will appear that the  fowl received much more poison in proportion than the ox. Hence the  cause why the fowl died in five minutes and the ox in five and twenty.    Indeed, were it the case that the smallest particle of it introduced  into the blood has almost instantaneous effects, the Indian would not  find it necessary to make the large arrow: that of the blow-pipe is  much easier made and requires less poison.    And now for the antidotes, or rather the supposed antidotes. The  Indians tell you, that if the wounded animal be held for a considerable  time up to the mouth in water the poison will not prove fatal; also  that the juice of the sugar-cane poured down the throat will counteract  the effects of it. These antidotes were fairly tried upon full-grown  healthy fowls, but they all died, as though no steps had been taken to  preserve their lives. Rum was recommended, and given to another, but  with as little success.    It is supposed by some that wind introduced into the lungs by means of  a small pair of bellows would revive the poisoned patient, provided the  operation be continued for a sufficient length of time. It may be so;  but this is a difficult and a tedious mode of cure, and he who is  wounded in the forest, far away from his friends, or in the hut of the  savages, stands but a poor chance of being saved by it.    Had the Indians a sure antidote, it is likely they would carry it about  with them or resort to it immediately after being wounded, if at hand;  and their confidence in its efficacy would greatly diminish the horror  they betray when you point a poisoned arrow at them.    One day, while we were eating a red monkey erroneously called the  baboon, in Demerara, an Arowack Indian told an affecting story of what  happened to a comrade of his. He was present at his death. As it did  not interest this Indian in any point to tell a falsehood, it is very  probable that his account was a true one. If so, it appears that there  is no certain antidote, or at least an antidote that could be resorted  to in a case of urgent need, for the Indian gave up all thoughts of  life as soon as he was wounded.    The Arowack Indian said it was but four years ago that he and his  companion were ranging in the forest in quest of game. His companion  took a poisoned arrow and sent it at a red monkey in a tree above him.  It was nearly a perpendicular shot. The arrow missed the monkey, and in  the descent struck him in the arm a little above the elbow. He was  convinced it was all over with him. \"I shall never,\" said he to his  companion, in a faltering voice, and looking at his bow as he said it,  \"I shall never,\" said he, \"bend this bow again.\" And having said that,  he took off his little bamboo poison-box, which hung across his  shoulder, and putting it together with his bow and arrows on the  ground, he laid himself down close by them, bid his companion farewell,  and never spoke more.    He who is unfortunate enough to be wounded by a poisoned arrow from  Macoushia had better not depend upon the common antidotes for a cure.  Many who have been in Guiana will recommend immediate immersion in  water, or to take the juice of the sugar-cane, or to fill the mouth  full of salt; and they recommend these antidotes because they have got  them from the Indians. But were you to ask them if they ever saw these  antidotes used with success, it is ten to one their answer would be in  the negative.    Wherefore let him reject these antidotes as unprofitable and of no  avail. He has got an active and deadly foe within him which, like  Shakespeare's fell Serjeant Death, is strict in his arrest, and will  allow him but little time--very, very little time. In a few minutes he  will be numbered with the dead. Life ought, if possible, to be  preserved, be the expense ever so great. Should the part affected admit  of it, let a ligature be tied tight round the wound, and have immediate  recourse to the knife:      Continuo, culpam ferro compesce, priusquam    Dira per infaustum serpant contagia corpus.    And now, kind reader, it is time to bid thee farewell. The two ends  proposed have been obtained. The Portuguese inland frontier-fort has  been reached and the Macoushi wourali poison acquired. The account of  this excursion through the interior of Guiana has been submitted to thy  perusal in order to induce thy abler genius to undertake a more  extensive one. If any difficulties have arisen, or fevers come on, they  have been caused by the periodical rains which fall in torrents as the  sun approaches the Tropic of Cancer. In dry weather there would be no  difficulties or sickness.    Amongst the many satisfactory conclusions which thou wouldest be able  to draw during the journey there is one which, perhaps, would please  thee not a little, and that is with regard to dogs. Many a time, no  doubt, thou hast heard it hotly disputed that dogs existed in Guiana  previously to the arrival of the Spaniards in those parts. Whatever the  Spaniards introduced, and which bore no resemblance to anything the  Indians had been accustomed to see, retains its Spanish name to this  day.    Thus the Warow, the Arowack, the Acoway, the Macoushi and Carib tribes  call a hat _sombrero_; a shirt or any kind of cloth _camisa_; a shoe  _zapalo_; a letter _carta_; a fowl _gallina_; gunpowder _colvora_  (Spanish _polvora_); ammunition _bala_; a cow _vaca_; and a dog _perro_.    This argues strongly against the existence of dogs in Guiana before it  was discovered by the Spaniards, and probably may be of use to thee in  thy next canine dispute.    In a political point of view this country presents a large field for  speculation. A few years ago there was but little inducement for any  Englishman to explore the interior of these rich and fine colonies, as  the British Government did not consider them worth holding at the Peace  of Amiens. Since that period their mother-country has been blotted out  from the list of nations, and America has unfolded a new sheet of  politics. On one side the Crown of Braganza, attacked by an ambitious  chieftain, has fled from the palace of its ancestors, and now seems  fixed on the banks of the Janeiro. Cayenne has yielded to its arms, La  Plata has raised the standard of independence and thinks itself  sufficiently strong to obtain a Government of its own. On the other  side the Caraccas are in open revolt, and should Santa Fe join them in  good earnest they may form a powerful association.    Thus on each side of _ci-devant_ Dutch Guiana most unexpected and  astonishing changes have taken place. Will they raise or lower it in  the scale of estimation at the Court of St. James's? Will they be of  benefit to these grand and extensive colonies? Colonies enjoying  perpetual summer. Colonies of the richest soil. Colonies containing  within themselves everything necessary for their support. Colonies, in  fine, so varied in their quality and situation as to be capable of  bringing to perfection every tropical production, and only want the  support of Government, and an enlightened governor, to render them as  fine as the finest portions of the equatorial regions. Kind reader,  fare thee well!           *       *       *       *       *    _Letter to the Portuguese Commander_    MUY SENOR,    Como no tengo el honor, de ser conocido de VM. lo pienso mejor, y mas  decoroso, quedarme aqui, hastaque huviere recibido su respuesta.

He now said that the  nodes of a ring of satellites revolving round the earth's equator  would consequently all regress. And if joined into a solid ring its  node would regress; and it would do so, only more slowly, if  encumbered by the spherical part of the earth's mass. Therefore the  axis of the equatorial belt of the earth must revolve round the pole  of the ecliptic. Then he set to work and found the amount due to the  moon and that due to the sun, and so he solved the mystery of 2,000  years.    When Newton applied his law of gravitation to an explanation of the  tides he started a new field for the application of mathematics to  physical problems; and there can be little doubt that, if he could  have been furnished with complete tidal observations from different  parts of the world, his extraordinary powers of analysis would have  enabled him to reach a satisfactory theory.  He certainly opened up  many mines full of intellectual gems; and his successors have never  ceased in their explorations. This has led to improved mathematical  methods, which, combined with the greater accuracy of observation,  have rendered physical astronomy of to-day the most exact of the  sciences.    Laplace only expressed the universal opinion of posterity when he said  that to the _Principia_ is assured \"a pre-eminence above all the  other productions of the human intellect.\"    The name of Flamsteed, First Astronomer Royal, must here be mentioned  as having supplied Newton with the accurate data required for  completing the theory.    The name of Edmund Halley, Second Astronomer Royal, must ever be held  in repute, not only for his own discoveries, but for the part he  played in urging Newton to commit to writing, and present to the Royal  Society, the results of his investigations. But for his friendly  insistence it is possible that the _Principia_ would never have  been written; and but for his generosity in supplying the means the  Royal Society could not have published the book.    [Illustration: DEATH MASK OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON.  Photographed specially for this work from the original, by kind  permission of the Royal Society, London.]    Sir Isaac Newton died in 1727, at the age of eighty-five.  His body  lay in state in the Jerusalem Chamber, and was buried in Westminster  Abbey.      FOOTNOTES:    [1] The writer inherited from his father (Professor J. D. Forbes) a  small box containing a bit of wood and a slip of paper, which had been  presented to him by Sir David Brewster. On the paper Sir David had  written these words: \"If there be any truth in the story that Newton  was led to the theory of gravitation by the fall of an apple, this bit  of wood is probably a piece of the apple tree from which Newton saw  the apple fall. When I was on a pilgrimage to the house in which  Newton was born, I cut it off an ancient apple tree growing in his  garden.\" When lecturing in Glasgow, about 1875, the writer showed it  to his audience. The next morning, when removing his property from the  lecture table, he found that his precious relic had been stolen. It  would be interesting to know who has got it now!    [2] It must be noted that these words, in which the laws of  gravitation are always summarised in histories and text-books, do not  appear in the _Principia_; but, though they must have been composed by  some early commentator, it does not appear that their origin has been  traced. Nor does it appear that Newton ever extended the law beyond  the Solar System, and probably his caution would have led him to avoid  any statement of the kind until it should be proved.    With this exception the above statement of the law of universal  gravitation contains nothing that is not to be found in the  _Principia_; and the nearest approach to that statement occurs in the  Seventh Proposition of Book III.:--    Prop.: That gravitation occurs in all bodies, and that it is  proportional to the quantity of matter in each.    Cor. I.: The total attraction of gravitation on a planet arises, and  is composed, out of the attraction on the separate parts.    Cor. II.: The attraction on separate equal particles of a body is  reciprocally as the square of the distance from the particles.    [3] It is said that, when working out this final result, the  probability of its confirming that part of his theory which he had  reluctantly abandoned years before excited him so keenly that he was  forced to hand over his calculations to a friend, to be completed by  him.        8. NEWTON'S SUCCESSORS--HALLEY, EULER, LAGRANGE, LAPLACE, ETC.      Edmund Halley succeeded Flamsteed as Second Astronomer Royal in  1721. Although he did not contribute directly to the mathematical  proofs of Newton's theory, yet his name is closely associated with  some of its greatest successes.    He was the first to detect the acceleration of the moon's mean  motion. Hipparchus, having compared his own observations with those of  more ancient astronomers, supplied an accurate value of the moon's  mean motion in his time. Halley similarly deduced a value for modern  times, and found it sensibly greater.  He announced this in 1693, but  it was not until 1749 that Dunthorne used modern lunar tables to  compute a lunar eclipse observed in Babylon 721 B.C., another at  Alexandria 201 B.C., a solar eclipse observed by Theon 360 A.D., and  two later ones up to the tenth century.  He found that to explain  these eclipses Halley's suggestion must be adopted, the acceleration  being 10\" in one century. In 1757 Lalande again fixed it at 10.\"    The Paris Academy, in 1770, offered their prize for an investigation  to see if this could be explained by the theory of gravitation. Euler  won the prize, but failed to explain the effect, and said: \"It appears  to be established by indisputable evidence that the secular inequality  of the moon's mean motion cannot be produced by the forces of  gravitation.\"    The same subject was again proposed for a prize which was shared by  Lagrange [1] and Euler, neither finding a solution, while the latter  asserted the existence of a resisting medium in space.    Again, in 1774, the Academy submitted the same subject, a third time,  for the prize; and again Lagrange failed to detect a cause in  gravitation.    Laplace [2] now took the matter in hand. He tried the effect of a  non-instantaneous action of gravity, to no purpose. But in 1787 he  gave the true explanation.  The principal effect of the sun on the  moon's orbit is to diminish the earth's influence, thus lengthening  the period to a new value generally taken as constant. But Laplace's  calculations showed the new value to depend upon the excentricity of  the earth's orbit, which, according; to theory, has a periodical  variation of enormous period, and has been continually diminishing for  thousands of years. Thus the solar influence has been diminishing, and  the moon's mean motion increased. Laplace computed the amount at 10\"  in one century, agreeing with observation. (Later on Adams showed that  Laplace's calculation was wrong, and that the value he found was too  large; so, part of the acceleration is now attributed by some  astronomers to a lengthening of the day by tidal friction.)    Another contribution by Halley to the verification of Newton's law was  made when he went to St. Helena to catalogue the southern stars. He  measured the change in length of the second's pendulum in different  latitudes due to the changes in gravity foretold by Newton.    Furthermore, he discovered the long inequality of Jupiter and Saturn,  whose period is 929 years. For an investigation of this also the  Academy of Sciences offered their prize. This led Euler to write a  valuable essay disclosing a new method of computing perturbations,  called the instantaneous ellipse with variable elements. The method  was much developed by Lagrange.    But again it was Laplace who solved the problem of the inequalities of  Jupiter and Saturn by the theory of gravitation, reducing the errors  of the tables from 20' down to 12\", thus abolishing the use of  empirical corrections to the planetary tables, and providing another  glorious triumph for the law of gravitation.  As Laplace justly said:  \"These inequalities appeared formerly to be inexplicable by the law of  gravitation--they now form one of its most striking proofs.\"    Let us take one more discovery of Halley, furnishing directly a new  triumph for the theory. He noticed that Newton ascribed parabolic  orbits to the comets which he studied, so that they come from  infinity, sweep round the sun, and go off to infinity for ever, after  having been visible a few weeks or months. He collected all the  reliable observations of comets he could find, to the number of  twenty-four, and computed their parabolic orbits by the rules laid  down by Newton. His object was to find out if any of them really  travelled in elongated ellipses, practically undistinguishable, in the  visible part of their paths, from parabolae, in which case they would  be seen more than once. He found two old comets whose orbits, in shape  and position, resembled the orbit of a comet observed by himself in  1682.  Apian observed one in 1531; Kepler the other in 1607.  The  intervals between these appearances is seventy-five or seventy-six  years. He then examined and found old records of similar appearance in  1456, 1380, and 1305. It is true, he noticed, that the intervals  varied by a year and a-half, and the inclination of the orbit to the  ecliptic diminished with successive apparitions.  But he knew from  previous calculations that this might easily be due to planetary  perturbations. Finally, he arrived at the conclusion that all of these  comets were identical, travelling in an ellipse so elongated that the  part where the comet was seen seemed to be part of a parabolic  orbit. He then predicted its return at the end of 1758 or beginning of"]]]
