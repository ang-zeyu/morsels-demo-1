CHAPTER XI    CROSSED WIRES      More surprised than hurt, and with a feeling of chagrin and anger at  the trick which had been played on him, Tom managed to scramble out of  the brook. The water was not deep, but he had splashed in with such  force that he was wet all over. And, as he got up, the water dripping  from his clothes, the lad was conscious of a pain in his head. He put  up his hand, and found that contact with a stone had raised a large  lump on his forehead. It was as big as a hen's egg.    \"Humph! I'll be a pretty sight to-morrow,\" murmured Tom. \"I wonder who  that fellow was, anyhow, and what he wanted? He tripped me neatly  enough, whoever he was. I've a good notion to keep on after him.\"    Then, as he realized what a start the fleeing one had, the young  inventor knew that it would be fruitless to renew the chase. Slowly he  ascended the sloping bank, and started for home.  As he did so he  realized that he had, clasped in his fingers, something he had grabbed  from the person he was pursuing just before his unlucky tumble.    \"It's part of his watch chain!\" exclaimed Tom, as he felt of the  article. \"I must have ripped it loose when I fell. Wonder what it is?  Evidently some sort of a charm. Maybe it will be a clue.\"  He tried to  discern of what style it was, but in the dark woods this was  impossible. Then the lad tried to strike a match, but those in his  pocket had become wet from his unexpected bath.  \"I'll have to wait  until I get home,\" he went on, and he hastened his steps, for he was  anxious to see what he had torn loose from the person who appeared to  be spying on him.    \"Why Tom, what's the matter?\" exclaimed Mrs. Baggert, when he entered  the kitchen, dripping water at every step. \"Is it raining outside? I  didn't hear any storm.\"    \"It was raining where I was,\" replied Tom angrily. \"I fell in the  brook. It was so hot I thought I'd cool off.\"    \"With your best suit on!\" ejaculated the housekeeper.    \"It isn't my best,\" retorted the lad. \"But I went in before I thought.  It was an accident; I fell,\" he added, lest Mrs. Baggert take his  joking remarks seriously. He did not want to tell her of the chase.    The chief concern of the lad now was to look at the charm and, as soon  as Mrs. Baggert's attention was attracted elsewhere, Tom glanced at the  object he still held tightly clenched in his hand.  As the light from  the kitchen fell upon it he could hardly repress an exclamation of  astonishment.    For the charm that he held in his hand was one he had seen before  dangling from the watch chain of Addison Berg, the agent for Bentley &  Eagert, submarine boat builders, which firm had, as told in \"Tom Swift  and His Submarine,\" tried unsuccessfully to secure the gold treasure  from the sunken wreck. Berg and his associates had even gone so far as  to try to disable the Advance, the boat of Tom and his father, by  ramming her when deep down under the ocean, but Mr. Swift's use of an  electric cannon had broken the steering gear of the Wonder, the rival  craft, and from that time on Tom and his friends had a clear field to  search for the bullion held fast in the hold of the Boldero. \"Addison  Berg,\" murmured Tom, as he looked at the watch charm. \"What can he be  doing in this neighborhood? Hiding, too, as if he wanted to overhear  something. That's the way he did when we were building our submarine,  and now he's up to the same trick when I'm constructing my electric  car. I'm sure this charm is his. It is such a peculiar design that I'm  positive I can't be mistaken. I thought, when I was chasing after him,  that it would turn out to be Andy Foger, or some of the boys, but it  was too big for them.  Addison Berg, eh? What can he be doing around  here? I must not tell Dad, or he'd worry himself sick. But I must be on  my guard.\"    Tom examined the charm closely. It was a compass, but made in an odd  form, and was much ornamented.    The young inventor had noticed it on several occasions when he had been  in conversation with Mr. Berg previous to the attempt on the part of  the owners of the rival submarine to wreck Tom's boat. He felt that he  could not be mistaken in identifying the charm.    \"Berg was afraid I'd catch him, and ask for an explanation that would  have been awkward to make,\" thought the lad, as he turned the charm  over in his hand. \"That's why he tripped me up. But I'll get at the  bottom of this yet. Maybe he wants to steal my ideas for an electric  car.\"    Tom's musings were suddenly interrupted by Mrs. Baggert.    \"I hope you're not going to stand there all night,\" she said, with a  laugh. \"You're in the middle of a puddle now, but when you get over  dreaming I'd like to mop it up.\"    \"All right,\" agreed the young inventor, coming to himself suddenly.  \"Guess I'd better go get some dry clothes on.\"    \"You'd better go to bed,\" advised Mrs. Baggert. \"That's where your  father and Mr. Sharp are. It's late.\"    The more Tom thought over the strange occurrence the more it puzzled  him. He mused over the presence of Berg as he went about his work the  next day, for that it was the agent whom he had pursued he felt  positive.    \"But I can't figure out why he was hanging around here,\" mused Tom.    Then, as he found that his thoughts over the matter were interfering  with his work, he resolutely put them from him, and threw himself  energetically into the labor of completing his electric car. The new  batteries, he found, were working well, and in the next two days he had  constructed several more, joining them so as to get the combined effect.    It was the afternoon of the third day from Tom's unexpected fall into  the brook that the young inventor decided on the first important test  of his new device. He was going to try the motor, running it with his  storage battery. Some of the connections were already in place, the  wires being fastened to the side of the shop, where they were attached  to switches. Tom did not go over these, taking it for granted that they  were all right. He soon had the motor, which he was to install in his  car, wired to the battery, and then he attached a gauge, to ascertain,  by comparison, how many miles he could hope to travel on one charging  of the storage battery.    \"Guess I'll call Dad and Mr. Sharp in to see how it works, before I  turn on the current,\" he said to himself. He was about to summon his  parent and the aeronaut from an adjoining shop, where they were working  over a new form of dynamo, when the lad caught sight of the watch charm  he had left on his desk, in plain sight.    \"Better put that away,\" he remarked. \"Dad or Mr. Sharp might see it,  and ask questions. Then I'd have to explain, and I don't want to, not  until I get further toward the bottom of this thing.\"    He put the charm away, and then summoned his father and the balloonist.    \"You're going to see a fine experiment,\" declared Tom. \"I'm going to  turn on the full strength of my battery.\"    \"Are you sure it's all right, Tom?\" asked his father. \"You can't be too  careful when you're dealing with electricity of high voltage, and great  ampere strength.    \"Oh, it's all right, Dad,\" his son assured him \"Now watch my motor hum.\"    He walked over to a big copper switch, and grasped the black rubber  handle to pull it over which would send the current from the storage  battery into the combination of wheels and gears that he hoped,  ultimately, would propel his electric automobile along the highways, or  on a track, at the rate of a hundred miles an hour.    \"Here she goes!\" cried Tom. For an instant he hesitated and then pulled  the switch. At the same time his hand rested on another wire, stretched  across a bench.    No sooner had the switch closed than there was a blinding flash, a  report as of a gun being fired, and Tom's body seemed to straighten  out. Then a blue flame appeared to encircle him and he dropped to the  floor of the shop, an inert mass.    \"He's killed!\" cried Mr. Swift, springing forward.    \"Careful!\" cautioned the balloonist. \"He's been shocked! Don't touch  him until I turn off the current!\"  As he pulled out the switch, the  aeronaut gave a glance at the apparatus.    \"There's something wrong here!\" he cried. \"The wires have been crossed!  That's what shocked Tom, but he never made the wrong connections! He's  too good an electrician! There's been some one in this shop, changing  the wires!\"          CHAPTER XII    THE TRY OUT      Once the current was cut off it was safe to approach the body of the  young inventor. Mr. Sharp stooped over and lifted Tom's form from the  floor, for Mr. Swift was too excited and trembled too much to be of any  service. Our hero was as one dead. His body was limp, after that first  rigid stretching out, as the current ran through him; his eyes were  closed, and his face was very pale.    \"Is--is there any hope?\" faltered Mr. Swift.    \"I think so,\" replied the balloonist. \"He is still breathing--faintly.  We must summon a doctor at once. Will you telephone for one, while I  carry him in the house?\"    As Mr. Sharp emerged from the shop, bearing Tom's body, an automobile  drew up in front of the place.    \"Bless my soul!\" exclaimed a voice. \"Tom's hurt! How did it happen?  Bless my very existence!\"    \"Oh, Mr. Damon, you're just in time!\" exclaimed Mr. Sharp, \"Tom's had a  bad shock. Will you go for a doctor in your auto?\"    \"Better than that! Let me take Tom in the car to Dr. Whiteside's  office,\" proposed the eccentric man. \"It will be better that way.\"    \"Yes, yes,\" agreed Mr. Swift eagerly. \"Put Tom in the auto!\"    \"If only it doesn't break down,\" added Mr. Damon fervently.  \"Bless my  spark plug, but it would be just my luck!\"    But they started off all right, Mr. Swift riding in front with Mr.  Damon, and Mr. Sharp supporting Tom in the tonneau. Only a little  fluttering of the eyelids, and a slow, faint"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/953"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Big Tunnel; Or, The Hidden City of the Andes (#11)"],[1,"it strike you as curious that he should happen to be so near  at hand when the bomb fell behind us?\"    \"I hadn't thought of that,\" admitted the contractor. \"Do you mean that  he might have dropped it himself?\"    \"Well, I wouldn't go so far as to say that,\" replied Tom, slowly. \"But  I think it would be a good idea to find out all we can of Professor  Swyington Bumper.\"    \"I agree with you, Tom. We'll investigate him.\"          Chapter XI    In the Andes      Professor Swyington Bumper seemed to live in a region all by himself.  Though he was on board the Bellaconda, he might just as well have been  in an airship, or riding along on the back of a donkey, as far as his  knowledge, or recognition, of his surroundings went. He seemed to be  thinking thoughts far, far away, and he was never without a  book--either a bound volume or a note-book. In the former he buried his  hawk-like nose, and Tom, looking over his shoulder once, saw that the  book was printed in curious characters, which, later, he learned were  Sanskrit. If he had a note-book the bald-headed professor was  continually jotting down memoranda in it.    \"I can hardly think of him as a conspirator against us,\" said Tom to  Mr. Titus.    \"After you have been in the contracting business as long as I have  you'll distrust every one,\" was the answer.  \"Waddington isn't on  board, or I'd distrust him. That Spaniard, Senor Pinto, seems to be out  of consideration, and there only remains the professor. We must watch  him.\"    But Professor Bumper proved to be above suspicion.  Carefully guarded  inquiries made of the captain, the purser and other ships' officers,  brought out the fact that he was well known to all of them, having  traveled on the line before.    \"He is making a search for something, but he won't say what it is,\" the  captain said. \"At first we thought it was gold or jewels, for he goes  away off into the Andes Mountains, where both gold and jewels have been  found. He never looks for treasure, though, for though some of his  party have made rather rich discoveries, he takes no interest in them.\"    \"What is he after then?\" asked Mr. Titus.    \"No one knows, and he won't tell. But whatever it is he has never found  it yet. Always, when he comes back, unsuccessful, from a trip to the  interior and goes back North with us, he will remark that he has not  the right directions. That he must seek again.    \"Back he comes next season, as full of hope as before, but only to be  disappointed. Each time he goes to a new place in the mountains where  he digs and delves, so members of the parties he hires tell me, but  with no success. He carries with him something in a small iron box,  and, whatever this is, he consults it from time to time. It may be  directions for finding whatever he is after. But there seems to be  something wrong.\"    \"This is quite a mystery,\" remarked Tom.    \"It certainly is. But Professor Bumper is a fine man. I have known him  for years.\"    \"This seems to dispose of the theory that he planted the bomb, and that  he is one of the plotters in the pay of Blakeson & Grinder,\" said Mr.  Titus, when he and Tom were alone.    \"Yes, I guess it does. But who can have done it?\"    That was a question neither could answer.    Tom had a theory, which he did not disclose to Mr. Titus, that, after  all, the somewhat mysterious Senor Pinto might, in some way, be mixed  up in the bomb attempt. But a close questioning of the steward on duty  near the foreigner's cabin at the time disclosed the fact that Pinto  had been ill in his berth all that day.    \"Well, unless the bomb fell from some passing airship, I don't see how  it got on deck,\" said Tom with a shake of his head. \"And I'm sure no  airship passed over us.\"    They had kept the matter secret, not telling even Mr. Damon, for they  feared the eccentric man would make a fuss and alarm the whole vessel.  So Mr. Damon, occasionally blessing his necktie or his shoe laces,  played chess with his elderly gentleman friend and was perfectly happy.    That Professor Bumper not only had kept his promise about not  mentioning the bomb, but that he had forgotten all about it, was  evident a day or two after the happening. Tom and Mr. Titus passed him  on deck, and bowed cordially. The professor returned the salutation,  but looked at the two in a puzzled sort of fashion.    \"I beg your pardon,\" he remarked, \"but your faces are familiar, though  I cannot recall your names. Haven't I seen you before?\"    \"You have,\" said Tom, with a smile. \"You saved our lives from a bomb  the other day.\"    \"Oh, yes! So I did! So I did!\" exclaimed Professor Bumper.  \"I felt  sure I had seen you before. Are you all right?\"    \"Yes. There haven't been any more bombs thrown at us,\" the contractor  said. \"By the way, Professor Bumper, I understand you are quite a  traveler in the Andes, in the vicinity of Lima.\"    \"Yes, I have been there,\" admitted the bald-headed scientist in guarded  tones.    \"Well, I am digging a tunnel in that vicinity,\" went on Mr. Titus, \"and  if you ever get near Rimac, where the first cutting is made, I wish you  would come and see me--Tom too, as he is associated with me.\"    \"Rimac-Rimac,\" murmured the professor, looking sharply at the  contractor. \"Digging a tunnel there? Why are you doing that?\" and he  seemed to resent the idea.    \"Why, the Peruvian government engaged me to do it to connect the two  railroad lines,\" was the answer. \"Do you know anything about the place?\"    \"Not so much as I hope to later on,\" was the unexpected answer. \"As it  happens I am going to Rimac, and I may visit your tunnel.\"    \"I wish you would,\" returned Mr. Titus.    Later on, in their stateroom, the contractor remarked to the young  inventor:    \"Sort of queer; isn't it?\"    \"What?\" asked Tom. \"His not remembering us?\"    \"No, though that was odd. But I suppose he is forgetful, or pretends to  be. I mean it's queer he is going to Rimac.\"    \"What do you mean?\" asked Tom.    \"Well, I don't know exactly what I mean,\" went on the tunnel  contractor, \"but our tunnel happens to start at Rimac, which is a small  town at the base of the mountains.\"    \"Maybe the professor is a geologist,\" suggested Tom, \"and he may want  to get some samples of that hard rock.\"    \"Maybe,\" admitted Mr. Titus. \"But I shall keep my eyes on him all the  same. I'm not going to have any strangers, who happen to be around when  bombs drop near us, get into my tunnel.\"    \"I think you're wrong to doubt Professor Bumper,\" Tom said.    A few days after this, when Tom and Mr. Titus were casually discussing  the weather on deck and wondering how much longer it would be before  they reached Callao, Mr. Damon, who had been playing numberless games  of chess, came up for a breath of air.    \"Mr. Damon,\" called Tom, \"come over here and meet a friend of ours,  Professor Bumper,\" and he was about to introduce them, for the two, as  far as Tom knew, had not yet met. But no sooner had the professor and  Mr. Damon caught sight of each other than there was a look of mutual  recognition.    \"Bless my fountain pen!\" cried the eccentric man. \"If it isn't my old  friend!\"    \"Mr. Damon!\" cried the professor. \"I am delighted to see you again. I  did not know you were on board!\"    \"Nor I you. Bless my apple dumpling! Are you still after those Peruvian  antiquities?\"    \"I am, Mr. Damon. But I did not know you were acquainted with Mr.  Swift.\"    \"Oh, Tom and I are old friends.\"    \"Professor Bumper saved the lives of Mr. Titus and myself,\" said Tom,  \"or at least he saved us from severe injury by a bomb.\"    \"Pray do not mention it, my friends,\" put in the professor, casually.  \"It was nothing.\"    Of course he did not mean it just that way.    Then, naturally, Mr. Damon had to be told all about the bomb for the  first time, and his wonder was great. He blessed everything he could  think of.    \"And to think it should be my old friend, Professor Bumper, who saved  you,\" said the odd man to Tom and Mr. Titus later that day.    \"Do you know him well?\" asked Mr. Titus.    \"Very well indeed. Our drug concern sells him many chemicals for his  experiments.\"    \"Well, if you know him I guess he can't be what I thought he was,\" the  contractor went on. \"I'm glad to know it. Why is he going to the Andes?\"    \"Oh, for many years he has been interested in collecting Peruvian  antiquities. He has a certain theory in regard to something or other  about their ancient civilization, but just what it is I have, at this  moment, forgotten. Only I know you can thoroughly trust Professor  Bumper, for a finer man never lived, though he is a bit absent-minded  at times.  But you will like him very much.\"    Thus the last lingering doubt of Professor Bumper was removed. Mr.  Damon told something of how the scientist had been honored by degrees  from many colleges and was regarded as an authority on Peruvian matters.    But who had placed the bomb on deck remained a mystery.    In due time Callao, the seaport of Lima, was reached and our friends  disembarked. Tom saw to the unloading of the explosive, which was to be  sent direct to the tunnel at Rimac. Mr. Titus, Tom and Mr. Damon would  remain in Lima a day or so.    Professor Bumper disembarked with our friends, and stopped at the same  hotel. Tom kept a lookout for Senor Pinto, but did not see him, and  concluded that the Spaniard was ill, and would be carried ashore on a  stretcher, perhaps.    Lima, the principal city and capital of Peru, proved an interesting  place. It was about eight miles inland and was built on an arid plain  about five hundred feet above sea level. Yet, though it was on what  might be termed a desert, the place, by means of irrigation, had been  made into a beauty spot.    Tom found the older part of the city was laid out with mathematical  regularity, each street crossing the other at right angles. But in the  new portions there was not this adherence to straightness.    \"Bless my transfer!"]]]
