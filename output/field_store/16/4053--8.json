It will dress your victuals, which, as well as your cooks, will not  be exposed to the vapour of charcoal; it will warm again those dishes  on your table; dry your linen; heat your oven, and the water for your  baths or your washing, with every economical advantage that can be  wished. No moist or black vapours; no ashes, no breaze, to make a  dirt, or oppose the communication of heat; no useless loss of  caloric; you may, by shutting an opening, which is no longer  necessary for placing the wood in your oven, compress and coerce the  torrents of heat that were escaping from it.    \"It may easily be conceived, that an inflammable principle so docile  and so active may be made to yield the most magnificent  illuminations. Streams of fire finely drawn out, the duration,  colour, and form of which may be varied at pleasure, the motion of  suns and turning-columns, must produce an effect no less agreeable  than brilliant.\" Indeed, this effect was exhibited on the garden  façade of M. LEBON'S residence.    \"Wood,\" concluded he, \"yields in condensable vapours two thirds of  its weight; those vapours may therefore be employed to produce the  effects of our steam-engines, and it is needless to borrow this  succour from foreign water.\"    _P. S._. On the 1st of last Vendémiaire, (23rd of September), the  government presented to the Chief Consul a sword, whose hilt was  adorned with fourteen diamonds, the largest of which, called the  _Regent_, from its having been purchased by the Duke of Orleans, when  Regent, weighs 184 carats. This is the celebrated _Pitt_ diamond, of  which we have heard so much: but its weight is exceeded by that of  the diamond purchased by the late empress of Russia, which weighs 194  carats; not to speak of the more famous diamond, in possession of the  Great Mogul, which is said to weigh 280 carats.        LETTER V.    _Paris, October 24, 1801._    Last night I received yours of the 20th ult. and as Mr. M----y  purposes to send off a dispatch this morning, and will do me the  favour to forward this, with my former letters, I hasten to write you  a few lines.    I scarcely need assure you, my dear friend, that I will, with  pleasure, communicate to you my remarks on this great city and its  inhabitants, and describe to you, as far as I am able, the principal  curiosities which it contains, particularizing, as you desire, those  recently placed here by the chance of war; and giving you a succinct,  historical account of the most remarkable national establishments and  public buildings. But to pass in review the present state of the  _arts, sciences, literature, manners, &c. &c._ in this capital, and  contrast it with that which existed before the revolution, is a task  indeed; and far more, I fear, than it will be in my power to  accomplish.    However, if you will be content to gather my observations as they  occur; to listen to my reflections, while the impression of the  different scenes which produced them, is still warm in my mind; in  short, to take a faithful sketch, in lieu of a finished picture, I  will do the best I can for your satisfaction.    Relying on your indulgence, you shall know the life I lead: I will,  as it were, take you by the arm, and, wherever I go, you shall be my  companion. Perhaps, by pursuing this plan, you will not, at the  expiration of three or four months, think your time unprofitably  spent. Aided by the experience acquired by having occasionally  resided here, for several months together, before the revolution, it  will be my endeavour to make you as well acquainted with Paris, as I  shall then hope to be myself. For this purpose, I will lay under  contribution every authority, both written and oral, worthy of being  consulted.        LETTER VI    _Paris, October 26, 1801._    From particular passages in your letter, I clearly perceive your  anxiety to be introduced among those valuable antiques which now  adorn the banks of the Seine. On that account, I determined to  postpone all other matters, and pay my first visit to the CENTRAL  MUSEUM OF THE ARTS, established in the    LOUVRE.    But, before, we enter the interior of this building, it may not be  amiss to give you some account of its construction, and describe to  you its exterior beauties.    The origin of this palace, as well as the etymology of its name, is  lost in the darkness of time. It is certain, however, that it  existed, under the appellation of _Louvre_, in the reign of Philip  Augustus, who surrounded it with ditches and towers, and made it a  fortress. The great tower of the _Louvre_, celebrated in history, was  insulated, and built in the middle of the court. All the great  feudatories of the crown derived their tenure from this tower, and  came hither to swear allegiance and pay homage. \"It was,\" says St.  Foix, \"a prison previously prepared for them, if they violated their  oaths.\"[1] Three Counts of Flanders were confined in it at different  periods.    The _Louvre_, far from being cheerful from its construction, received  also from this enormous tower a melancholy and terrifying aspect  which rendered it unworthy of being a royal residence. Charles V.  endeavoured to enliven and embellish this gloomy abode, and made it  tolerably commodious for those times. Several foreign monarchs  successively lodged in it; such as Manuel, emperor of Constantinople;  Sigismund, emperor of Germany; and the emperor Charles the Fifth.    This large tower of the _Louvre_, which had, at different periods,  served as a palace to the kings of France, as a prison to the great  lords, and as a treasury to the state, was at length taken down in  1528.    The _Tower of the Library_ was famous, among several others, because  it contained that of Charles V. the most considerable one of the  time, and in which the number of volumes amounted to nine hundred.    OLD LOUVRE    The part of this palace which, at the present day, is called the _Old  Louvre_, was begun under Francis I. from the plan of PIERRE LESCOT,  abbot of Clugny; and the sculpture was executed by JEAN GOUGEON,  whose minute correctness is particularly remarkable in the festoons  of the frieze of the second order, and in the devices emblematic of  the amours of Henry II. This edifice, though finished, was not  inhabited during the reign of that king, but it was by his son  Charles IX.    Under him, the _Louvre_ became the bloody theatre of treacheries and  massacres which time will never efface from the memory of mankind,  and which, till the merciless reign of Robespierre, were unexampled  in the history of this country. I mean the horrors of St.  Bartholemew's day.    While the alarmed citizens were swimming across the river to escape  from death, Charles IX. from a window of this palace, was firing at  them with his arquebuse. During that period of the revolution, when  all means were employed to excite and strengthen the enmity of the  people against their kings, this act of atrocity was called to their  mind by an inscription placed under the very window, which looks on  the _Quai du Louvre_.    Indeed, this instance of Charles's barbarity is fully corroborated by  historians. \"When it was day-light,\" says Brantome, \"the king peeped  out of his chamber-window, and seeing some people in the _Faubourg  St. Germain_ moving about and running away, he took a large arquebuse  which he had ready at hand, and, calling out incessantly: _Kill,  kill!_ fired a great many shots at them, but in vain; for the piece  did not carry so far.\"--This prince, according to Masson, piqued  himself on his dexterity in cutting off at a single blow the head of  the asses and pigs which he met with on his way. Lansac, one of his  favourites, having found him one day with his sword drawn and ready  to strike his mule, asked him seriously: \"What quarrel has then  happened between His Most Christian Majesty and my mule?\" Murad Bey  far surpassed this blood-thirsty monarch in address and strength. The  former, we are told by travellers in Egypt, has been known, when  riding past an ox, to cut off its head with one stroke of his  scimitar.    The capital was dyed with the blood of Charles's murdered subjects.  Into this very _Louvre_, into the chamber of Marguerite de Valois,  the king's sister, and even to her bed, in which she was then lying,  did the fanatics pursue the officers belonging to the court itself,  as is circumstantially related by that princess in her Memoirs.    Let us draw the curtain on these scenes of horror, and pass rapidly  from this period of fanaticism and cruelty, when the _Louvre_ was  stained by so many crimes to times more happy, when this palace  became the quiet cradle of the arts and sciences, the school for  talents, the _arena_ for genius, and the asylum of artists and  literati.    The centre pavilion over the principal gate of the _Old Louvre_, was  erected under the reign of Lewis XIII. from the designs of LE  MERCIER, as well as the angle of the left part of the building,  parallel to that built by Henry II. The eight gigantic cariatides  which are there seen, were sculptured by SARRASIN.    The façade towards the _Jardin de l'Infante_, (as it is called), that  towards the _Place du Louvre_, and that over the little gate, towards  the river, which were constructed under the reigns of Charles IX. and  Henry III. in the midst of the civil wars of the League, partake of  the taste of the time, in regard to the multiplicity of the  ornaments; but the interior announces, by the majesty of its  decorations, the refined taste of Lewis XIV.    NEW LOUVRE.    The part of the _Louvre_, which, with the two sides of the old  building, forms the perfect square, three hundred and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/90"],[0,"The Son of Tarzan (#11)"],[1," ate roots and tubers  which Akut unearthed.  Beyond the plain and across a low bluff they  came upon water--brackish, ill-smelling stuff in a shallow water hole,  the sides and bottom of which were trampled by the feet of many beasts.  A herd of zebra galloped away as they approached.    The lad was too thirsty by now to cavil at anything even remotely  resembling water, so he drank his fill while Akut stood with raised  head, alert for any danger.  Before the ape drank he cautioned the boy  to be watchful; but as he drank he raised his head from time to time to  cast a quick glance toward a clump of bushes a hundred yards away upon  the opposite side of the water hole.  When he had done he rose and  spoke to the boy, in the language that was their common heritage--the  tongue of the great apes.    \"There is no danger near?\" he asked.    \"None,\" replied the boy.  \"I saw nothing move while you drank.\"    \"Your eyes will help you but little in the jungle,\" said the ape.    \"Here, if you would live, you must depend upon your ears and your nose  but most upon your nose.  When we came down to drink I knew that no  danger lurked near upon this side of the water hole, for else the  zebras would have discovered it and fled before we came; but upon the  other side toward which the wind blows danger might lie concealed.  We  could not smell it for its scent is being blown in the other direction,  and so I bent my ears and eyes down wind where my nose cannot travel.\"    \"And you found--nothing?\" asked the lad, with a laugh.    \"I found Numa crouching in that clump of bushes where the tall grasses  grow,\" and Akut pointed.    \"A lion?\" exclaimed the boy.  \"How do you know?  I can see nothing.\"    \"Numa is there, though,\" replied the great ape.  \"First I heard him  sigh.  To you the sigh of Numa may sound no different from the other  noises which the wind makes among the grasses and the trees; but later  you must learn to know the sigh of Numa.  Then I watched and at last I  saw the tall grasses moving at one point to a force other than the  force of the wind.  See, they are spread there upon either side of  Numa's great body, and as he breathes--you see?  You see the little  motion at either side that is not caused by the wind--the motion that  none of the other grasses have?\"    The boy strained his eyes--better eyes than the ordinary boy  inherits--and at last he gave a little exclamation of discovery.    \"Yes,\" he said, \"I see.  He lies there,\" and he pointed.  \"His head is  toward us.  Is he watching us?\"    \"Numa is watching us,\" replied Akut, \"but we are in little danger,  unless we approach too close, for he is lying upon his kill.  His belly  is almost full, or we should hear him crunching the bones.  He is  watching us in silence merely from curiosity.  Presently he will resume  his feeding or he will rise and come down to the water for a drink.  As  he neither fears or desires us he will not try to hide his presence  from us; but now is an excellent time to learn to know Numa, for you  must learn to know him well if you would live long in the jungle.  Where the great apes are many Numa leaves us alone.  Our fangs are long  and strong, and we can fight; but when we are alone and he is hungry we  are no match for him.  Come, we will circle him and catch his scent.  The sooner you learn to know it the better; but keep close to the  trees, as we go around him, for Numa often does that which he is least  expected to do.  And keep your ears and your eyes and your nose open.  Remember always that there may be an enemy behind every bush, in every  tree and amongst every clump of jungle grass.  While you are avoiding  Numa do not run into the jaws of Sabor, his mate.  Follow me,\" and Akut  set off in a wide circle about the water hole and the crouching lion.    The boy followed close upon his heels, his every sense upon the alert,  his nerves keyed to the highest pitch of excitement.  This was life!  For the instant he forgot his resolutions of a few minutes past to  hasten to the coast at some other point than that at which he had  landed and make his way immediately back to London.  He thought now  only of the savage joy of living, and of pitting one's wits and prowess  against the wiles and might of the savage jungle brood which haunted  the broad plains and the gloomy forest aisles of the great, untamed  continent.  He knew no fear.  His father had had none to transmit to  him; but honor and conscience he did have and these were to trouble him  many times as they battled with his inherent love of freedom for  possession of his soul.    They had passed but a short distance to the rear of Numa when the boy  caught the unpleasant odor of the carnivore.  His face lighted with a  smile.  Something told him that he would have known that scent among a  myriad of others even if Akut had not told him that a lion lay near.  There was a strange familiarity--a weird familiarity in it that made  the short hairs rise at the nape of his neck, and brought his upper lip  into an involuntary snarl that bared his fighting fangs.  There was a  sense of stretching of the skin about his ears, for all the world as  though those members were flattening back against his skull in  preparation for deadly combat.  His skin tingled.  He was aglow with a  pleasurable sensation that he never before had known.  He was, upon the  instant, another creature--wary, alert, ready.  Thus did the scent of  Numa, the lion, transform the boy into a beast.    He had never seen a lion--his mother had gone to great pains to prevent  it.  But he had devoured countless pictures of them, and now he was  ravenous to feast his eyes upon the king of beasts in the flesh.  As he  trailed Akut he kept an eye cocked over one shoulder, rearward, in the  hope that Numa might rise from his kill and reveal himself.  Thus it  happened that he dropped some little way behind Akut, and the next he  knew he was recalled suddenly to a contemplation of other matters than  the hidden Numa by a shrill scream of warning from the Ape.  Turning  his eyes quickly in the direction of his companion, the boy saw that,  standing in the path directly before him, which sent tremors of  excitement racing along every nerve of his body.  With body  half-merging from a clump of bushes in which she must have lain hidden  stood a sleek and beautiful lioness.  Her yellow-green eyes were round  and staring, boring straight into the eyes of the boy.  Not ten paces  separated them.  Twenty paces behind the lioness stood the great ape,  bellowing instructions to the boy and hurling taunts at the lioness in  an evident effort to attract her attention from the lad while he gained  the shelter of a near-by tree.    But Sabor was not to be diverted.  She had her eyes upon the lad.  He  stood between her and her mate, between her and the kill.  It was  suspicious.  Probably he had ulterior designs upon her lord and master  or upon the fruits of their hunting.  A lioness is short tempered.  Akut's bellowing annoyed her.  She uttered a little rumbling growl,  taking a step toward the boy.    \"The tree!\" screamed Akut.    The boy turned and fled, and at the same instant the lioness charged.  The tree was but a few paces away.  A limb hung ten feet from the  ground, and as the boy leaped for it the lioness leaped for him.  Like  a monkey he pulled himself up and to one side.  A great forepaw caught  him a glancing blow at the hips--just grazing him.  One curved talon  hooked itself into the waist band of his pajama trousers, ripping them  from him as the lioness sped by.  Half-naked the lad drew himself to  safety as the beast turned and leaped for him once more.    Akut, from a near-by tree, jabbered and scolded, calling the lioness  all manner of foul names.  The boy, patterning his conduct after that  of his preceptor, unstoppered the vials of his invective upon the head  of the enemy, until in realization of the futility of words as weapons  he bethought himself of something heavier to hurl.  There was nothing  but dead twigs and branches at hand, but these he flung at the  upturned, snarling face of Sabor just as his father had before him  twenty years ago, when as a boy he too had taunted and tantalized the  great cats of the jungle.    The lioness fretted about the bole of the tree for a short time; but  finally, either realizing the uselessness of her vigil, or prompted by  the pangs of hunger, she stalked majestically away and disappeared in  the brush that hid her lord, who had not once shown himself during the  altercation.    Freed from their retreats Akut and the boy came to the ground, to take  up their interrupted journey once more.  The old ape scolded the lad  for his carelessness.    \"Had you not been so intent upon the lion behind you you might have  discovered the lioness much sooner than you did.\"    \"But you passed right by her without seeing her,\" retorted the boy.    Akut was chagrined.    \"It is thus,\" he said, \"that jungle folk die.  We go cautiously for a  lifetime, and then, just for an instant, we forget, and--\" he ground  his teeth in mimicry of the crunching of great jaws in flesh.  \"It is a  lesson,\" he resumed.  \"You have learned that you may not for too long  keep your eyes and your ears and your nose all bent in the same  direction.\"    That night the son of Tarzan was colder than he ever had been in all  his life.  The pajama trousers had not been heavy; but they had been  much heavier than nothing.  And the next day he roasted in the hot sun,  for again their way led much across wide and treeless plains.    It was still in the boy's mind to travel to the south, and circle back  to the coast in search of another outpost of civilization.  He had said  nothing of this plan to Akut, for he knew that the old ape would look  with displeasure upon any suggestion that savored of separation.    For a month the two wandered on, the boy learning rapidly the laws of  the jungle; his"]]]
