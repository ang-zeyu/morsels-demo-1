May Leto, mother of the brave,        Bring babes at your desire,      And holy Cypris either's breast        With mutual transport fire:      And Zeus the son of Cronos        Grant blessings without end,      From princely sire to princely son        For ever to descend.        \"Sleep on, and love and longing        Breathe in each other's breast;      But fail not when the morn returns        To rouse you from your rest:      With dawn shall we be stirring,        When, lifting high his fair      And feathered neck, the earliest bird        To clarion to the dawn is heard.

Once thievish Love the honeyed hives would rob,      When a bee stung him: soon he felt a throb      Through all his finger-tips, and, wild with pain,      Blew on his hands and stamped and jumped in vain.      To Aphrodite then he told his woe:      'How can a thing so tiny hurt one so?'      She smiled and said; 'Why thou'rt a tiny thing,      As is the bee; yet sorely thou canst sting.'          IDYLL XX.      Town and Country        Once I would kiss Eunice. \"Back,\" quoth she,      And screamed and stormed; \"a sorry clown kiss me?      Your country compliments, I like not such;      No lips but gentles' would I deign to touch.      Ne'er dream of kissing me: alike I shun      Your face, your language, and your tigerish fun.      How winning are your tones, how fine your air!      Your beard how silken and how sweet your hair!      Pah! you've a sick man's lips, a blackamoor's hand:      Your breath's defilement. Leave me, I command.\"          Thrice spat she on her robe, and, muttering low,      Scanned me, with half-shut eyes, from top to toe:      Brought all her woman's witcheries into play,      Still smiling in a set sarcastic way,      Till my blood boiled, my visage crimson grew      With indignation, as a rose with dew:      And so she left me, inly to repine      That such as she could flout such charms as mine.          O shepherds, tell me true! Am I not fair?      Am I transformed? For lately I did wear      Grace as a garment; and my cheeks, o'er them      Ran the rich growth like ivy round the stem.      Like fern my tresses o'er my temples streamed;      O'er my dark eyebrows, white my forehead gleamed:      My eyes were of Athene's radiant blue,      My mouth was milk, its accents honeydew.      Then I could sing--my tones were soft indeed!--      To pipe or flute or flageolet or reed:      And me did every maid that roams the fell      Kiss and call fair: not so this city belle.      She scorns the herdsman; knows not how divine      Bacchus ranged once the valleys with his kine;      How Cypris, maddened for a herdsman's sake,      Deigned upon Phrygia's mountains to partake      His cares: and wooed, and wept, Adonis in the brake.      What was Endymion, sweet Selene's love?      A herdsman's lad. Yet came she from above,      Down to green Latmos, by his side to sleep.      And did not Rhea for a herdsman weep?      Didst not thou, Zeus, become a wandering bird,      To win the love of one who drove a herd?      Selene, Cybele, Cypris, all loved swains:      Eunice, loftier-bred, their kiss disdains.      Henceforth, by hill or hall, thy love disown,      Cypris, and sleep the livelong night alone.          IDYLL XXI.      The Fishermen.    _ASPHALION, A COMRADE._        Want quickens wit: Want's pupils needs must work,      O Diophantus: for the child of toil      Is grudged his very sleep by carking cares:      Or, if he taste the blessedness of night,      Thought for the morrow soon warns slumber off.          Two ancient fishers once lay side by side      On piled-up sea-wrack in their wattled hut,      Its leafy wall their curtain. Near them lay      The weapons of their trade, basket and rod,      Hooks, weed-encumbered nets, and cords and oars,      And, propped on rollers, an infirm old boat.      Their pillow was a scanty mat, eked out      With caps and garments: such the ways and means,      Such the whole treasury of the fishermen.      They knew no luxuries: owned nor door nor dog;      Their craft their all, their mistress Poverty:      Their only neighbour Ocean, who for aye      Bound their lorn hut came floating lazily.          Ere the moon's chariot was in mid-career,      The fishers girt them for their customed toil,      And banished slumber from unwilling eyes,      And roused their dreamy intellects with speech:--        ASPHALION.        \"They say that soon flit summer-nights away,      Because all lingering is the summer day:      Friend, it is false; for dream on dream have I      Dreamed, and the dawn still reddens not the sky.      How? am I wandering? or does night pass slow?\"        HIS COMRADE.        \"Asphalion, scout not the sweet summer so.      'Tis not that wilful seasons have gone wrong,      But care maims slumber, and the nights seem long.\"        ASPHALION.        \"Didst thou e'er study dreams? For visions fair      I saw last night; and fairly thou should'st share      The wealth I dream of, as the fish I catch.      Now, for sheer sense, I reckon few thy match;      And, for a vision, he whose motherwit      Is his sole tutor best interprets it.      And now we've time the matter to discuss:      For who could labour, lying here (like us)      Pillowed on leaves and neighboured by the deep,      Or sleeping amid thorns no easy sleep?      In rich men's halls the lamps are burning yet;      But fish come alway to the rich man's net.\"        COMRADE.        \"To me the vision of the night relate;      Speak, and reveal the riddle to thy mate.\"        ASPHALION.        \"Last evening, as I plied my watery trade,      (Not on an o'erfull stomach--we had made      Betimes a meagre meal, as you can vouch,)      I fell asleep; and lo! I seemed to crouch      Among the boulders, and for fish to wait,      Still dangling, rod in hand, my vagrant bait.      A fat fellow caught it: (e'en in sleep I'm bound      To dream of fishing, as of crusts the hound:)      Fast clung he to the hooks; his blood outwelled;      Bent with his struggling was the rod I held:      I tugged and tugged: my efforts made me ache:      'How, with a line thus slight, this monster take?'      Then gently, just to warn him he was caught,      I twitched him once; then slacked and then made taut      My line, for now he offered not to ran;      A glance soon showed me all my task was done.      'Twas a gold fish, pure metal every inch      That I had captured. I began to flinch:      'What if this beauty be the sea-king's joy,      Or azure Amphitrite's treasured toy!'      With care I disengaged him--not to rip      With hasty hook the gilding from his lip:      And with a tow-line landed him, and swore      Never to set my foot on ocean more,      But with my gold live royally ashore.      So I awoke: and, comrade, lend me now      Thy wits, for I am troubled for my vow.\"        COMRADE.      \"Ne'er quake: you're pledged to nothing, for no prize      You gained or gazed on. Dreams are nought but lies.      Yet may this dream bear fruit; if, wide-awake      And not in dreams, you'll fish the neighbouring lake.      Fish that are meat you'll there mayhap behold,      Not die of famine, amid dreams of gold.\"          IDYLL XXII.      The Sons of Leda        The pair I sing, that AEgis-armed Zeus      Gave unto Leda; Castor and the dread      Of bruisers Polydeuces, whensoe'er      His harnessed hands were lifted for the fray.      Twice and again I sing the manly sons      Of Leda, those Twin Brethren, Sparta's own:      Who shield the soldier on the deadly scarp,      The horse wild-plunging o'er the crimson field,      The ship that, disregarding in her pride      Star-set and star-rise, meets disastrous gales:--      Such gales as pile the billows mountain-high,      E'en at their own wild will, round stem or stern:      Dash o'er the hold, the timbers rive in twain,      Till mast and tackle dangle in mid-air      Shivered like toys, and, as the night wears on,      The rain of heaven falls fast, and, lashed by wind      And iron hail, broad ocean rings again.      Then can they draw from out the nether abyss      Both craft and crew, each deeming he must die:      Lo the winds cease, and o'er the burnished deep      Comes stillness; this way flee the clouds and that;      And shine out clear the Great Bear and the Less,      And, 'twixt the Asses dimly seen, the Crib      Foretells fair voyage to the mariner.      O saviours, O companions of mankind,      Matchless on horse or harp, in lists or lay;      Which of ye twain demands my earliest song?      Of both I sing; of Polydeuces first.          Argo, escaped the two inrushing rocks,      And snow-clad Pontus with his baleful jaws,      Came to Bebrycia with her heaven-sprung freight;      There by one ladder disembarked a host      Of Heroes from the decks of Jason's ship.      On the low beach, to leeward of the cliff,      They leapt, and piled their beds, and lit their fires:      Castor meanwhile, the bridler of the steed,      And Polydeuces of the nut-brown face,      Had wandered from their mates; and, wildered both,      Searched through the boskage of the hill, and found      Hard by a slab of rock a bubbling spring      Brimful of purest water. In the depths      Below, like crystal or like silver gleamed      The pebbles: high above it pine and plane      And poplar rose, and cypress tipt with green;      With all rich flowers that throng the mead, when wanes      The Spring, sweet workshops of the furry bee.      There sat and sunned him one of giant bulk      And grisly mien: hard knocks had stov'n his ears:      Broad were his shoulders, vast his orbed chest;      Like a wrought statue rose his iron frame:    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11544"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#12)"],[1," town, far as I recollect. He made a lot of money for mistress. Mother  was houseworker for her. As fast as us children got big enough to hire  out, she leased us to anybody who would pay for our hire. I was put out  with another widow woman who lived about 20 miles. She worked me on her  cotton plantation. Old mistress sold one of my sisters; took cotton for  pay. I remember hearing them tell about the big price she brought  because cotton was so high. Old mistress got 15 bales of cotton for  sister, and it was only a few days till freedom came and the man who had  traded all them bales of cotton lost my sister, but old mistress kept  the cotton. She was smart, wasn't she? She knew freedom was right there.  Sister came right back to my parents.    \"Just give me time, miss, and I'll tell you the whole story. This woman  what had me hired tried to run away and take all her slaves along. I  don't remember just how many, but a dozen or more. Lots of white folks  tried to run away and hide their slaves until after the Yankee soldiers  had been through the town searching for them what had not been set free.  She was trying to get to the woods country. But she got nervous and  scared and done the worst thing she could. She run right into a Yankee  camp. Course they asked where we all belonged and sent us where we  belonged. They had always taught us to be scared of the Yankees. I  remember just as well when I got back to where my mother was she asked  me: \"Boy, why you come here? Don't you know old mistress got you rented  out? You're goin' be whipped for sure.\" I told her, no, now we got  freedom. That was the first they had heard. So then she had to tell my  father and mother. She tole them how they have no place to go, no  money,--nothing to start life on; they better stay on with her. So my  father and mother kept on with her; she let them have a part of what  they made; she took some for board, as was right. The white ladies what  had me between them fixed it up that I would serve out the time I was  rented out for. It was about six months more. My parents saved money and  we all went to a farm. I stayed with them till I was 19 years old. Of  course they got all the money I made. I married when I was 20, still  living in Georgia. We tried to farm on shares. A man from Arkansas came  there, getting up a colony of colored to go to Arkansas to farm. Told  big tales of fine land with nobody to work it. Not half as many Negroes  in Arkansas as in Georgia. Me and my wife joined up to go.    \"Well, ma'am, I didn't get enough education to be what you call a  educated man. My father paid for a six months night course for me after  peace. I learned to read and write and figure a little. I have used my  tablespoon full of brains ever since, always adding to that start. I  learned everything I could from the many white friends I have had. Any  way, miss, I have known enough to make a good living all these years.    \"Now I'll get on with the story. First work I got in Arkansas was  working on a farm; me and her both; we always tried to stay together. We  could not make anything on the Garner farm, and it was mighty unhealthy  down in Fourche bottoms. I carried her back to Little Rock and I got  work as house man in the Bunch home. From there I went to the home of  Dudley E. Jones and stayed there 28 years. That was the beginning of my  catering. I just naturally took to cooking and serving. White folks was  still used to having colored wait on them and they liked my style. Mr.  Jones was so kind. He told his friends about how I could plan big  dinners and banquets; then cook and serve them. Right soon I was  handling most of the big swell weddings for the society folks. Child, if  I could call off the names of the folks I have served, it would be  mighty near everybody of any consequence in Little Rock for more than 55  years. Yes ma'am, I'm now being called on to serve the grandchildren of  my first customers.    \"During the 28 years I lived in Mr. Jones' family I was serving  banquets, big public dinners, all kinds of big affairs. I have had the  spring and fall banquets for the Scottish Rite Masons for more than 41  years. I have served nearly all the Governor's banquets, college  graduation and reunion parties; I took care of President Roosevelt--not  this one, but Teddy----. Served about 600 that day. Any big parties for  colored people?... Yes ma'am! Don't you remember when Booker T.  Washington was here?... No ma'am. White folks didn't have a thing to do  with it, excepting the city let us have the new fire station. It was  just finished but the fire engines ain't moved in yet. I served about  600 that time. Yes ma'am, there was a lot of white folks there. Then, I  have been called to other places to do the catering. Lonoke, Benton,  Malvern, Conway--a heap of places like that.    \"No miss, I didn't always have all the catering business; oh, no. There  was Mr. Rossner. He was a fine man. White gentleman. I used to help him  a lot. But when he sold out to Bott, I got a lot of what business Mr.  Rossner had had, Mr. Bott was a Jew. All that time my wife was my best  helper. I took a young colored fellow named Freeling Alexander and  taught him the business. He never been able to make it go on his own,  but does fine working on salary. He has a cafeteria now.    \"Well thank you miss, speaking about my home like that. Yes ma'am, I  sure do own it. Fifty-two years I been living right here. First I bought  the lot; it took me two years to pay for it. Next I build a little  house. The big pin oak trees out front was only saplings when I set them  out. Come out in the back yard and see my pecan tree.... It is a giant,  ain't it? Yes ma'am, it was a tiny thing when I set it out fifty-two  years ago. Our only child was born in this house,--a dear daughter--and  her three babies were born here too. After my wife and daughter died, me  and the children kept on trying to keep the home together. I have taught  them the catering business. Both granddaughters are high school  graduates. The boy is in Mexico. Before he went he signed his name to a  check and said: \"Here, grandpa. You ain't going to want for a thing  while I'm gone. If something happens to your catering business, or you  get so you can't work, fill this in for whatever you need.\" But thank  the good Lord, I'm still going strong. Nobody has ever had to take care  of H.K. Miller. Now let me tell you something else about this place. For  more than ten years I have been paying $64.64 every year for my part of  that asphalt paving you see out in front. Yes ma'am, the lot is 50 foot  front, and I am paying for only half of it; from my curb line to the  middle of the street. Maybe if I live long enough I'll get it paid for  sometime.    \"I haven't tried to lay by much money. I don't suppose there is any  other colored man--uneducated like me--what has done more for his  community. I have given as high as $80 and $100 at one time to help out  on the church debt or when they wanted to build. I always help in times  of floods and things like that. I've helped many white persons in my  lifetime.    \"Well, now, I'll tell you what I think about the voting system. I think  this. Of course we are still in subjection to the white people; they are  in the majority and have most of the government on their side. But I  think that, er,--er,--well I'll tell you, while it is all right for them  to be at the head of things, they ought to do what is right. Being  educated, they ought to know right from wrong. I believe in the Bible,  miss. Look here. This little book--Gospel of St. John--has been carried  in my pocket every day for years and years. And I never miss a day  reading it. I don't see how some people can be so unjust. I guess they  never read their Bible. The reason I been able to make my three-score  years and ten is because I obeys what the Good Book says.    \"Now, let me see. I can remember that I been voting mighty near ever  since I been here. I never had any trouble voting. I have never been  objected from voting that I remember of.    \"Now you ask about what I think of the young people. Well, I tell you. I  think really that the young people of today had better begin to check  up, a little. They are going too fast. They don't seem to have enough  consideration. When I see so many killed in automobile accidents, and  know that drinking is the cause of so many car accidents,--well, yes  ma'am, drinking sure does have a lot to do with it. I think they should  more consider the way they going to make a living. Make a rule to look  before they act. Another thing--the education being given them--they are  not taking advantage of it. If they would profit by what they learn they  could benefit theirselves. A lot of them now spend heap of time trying  to get to be doctors and lawyers and like that. That is a mistake. There  is not enough work among colored people to support them. I know. Negroes  do not have confidence in their race for this kind of business. No  ma'am. Colored will go for a white doctor and white lawyer 'cause they  think they know more about that kind of business. I would recommend as  the best means of making a living for colored young people is to select  some kind of work that is absolutely necessary to be done and then do it  honestly. The trades, carpentering, paper hanging, painting, garage  work. Some work that white people need to have done, and they just as  soon colored do it as white. White folks ain't never going to have Negro  doctors and lawyers, I reckon. That's the reason I took up  catering--even that long ago. Fifty-five years ago I knew to look around  and find some work that white folks would need done. There's where your  living comes from.    \"Yes, miss, my business is slack--falling off, as you say. Catering is  not what it used to be. You see, 30 or 40 years ago, people's homes were  grand and big; big dining rooms, built for parties and"]]]
