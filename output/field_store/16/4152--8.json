Then the Raja's soldiers told her to come with them  and she said \"Yes, I am coming, but let me first offer a libation  of water to my dead husband;\" and on this pretext she went into the  water and then she darted to the place where Kuwar had been bound and  sank beneath the surface. The Raja bade men rescue her but all were  afraid to enter the water and she was seen no more. Then the Raja  gave all the coolies a feast and scattered money among the crowd and  dismissed them. And this is the end of the story.          XVIII. The Laughing Fish.    There was once a merchant who prospered in his business and in the  course of time became very rich. He had five sons but none of them  was married. In the village where he lived was an old tank which was  half silted up and he resolved to clean it out and deepen it, if the  Raja would give it to him; so he went to the Raja and the Raja said  that he could have the tank if he paid forty rupees. The merchant paid  the money and then went home and called his family together and said  that they would first improve the tank and then find wives for all  his sons. The  sons agreed and they collected coolies and drained  off the water and began to dig out the silt. When they had drained  off the water they found in the bed of the tank a number of big fish  of unknown age: which they caught and two of them they sent to the  Raja as a present. When the fish were carried into the presence of the  Raja they both began to laugh: then the Raja said \"What is the meaning  of this? Here are two dead fish, why are they laughing?\" And he told  the men who brought the fish to explain what was the matter or else  to take them away again. But they could give no explanation. Then the  Raja called all his officers and astrologers and asked them what they  thought it meant: but no one could give him any answer. Then the Raja  told the men to take the fish away again, and to tell the merchant  that, if he could not explain why the fish laughed, he would kill him  and all his descendants; and he wrote a letter to the same effect,  and fixed a day by which the merchant was to explain the matter. When  the merchant read the letter he fell into the greatest distress and  for two or three days he could not make up his mind whether to go on  with the work on the tank or no; but in the end he resolved to finish  it so that his name might be held in remembrance. So they finished the  work and then the merchant said to his sons: \"My sons I cannot arrange  for your marriages, for the Raja has threatened to kill us all, if I  cannot explain why the fish laughed; you must all escape from here so  that our family may not die out;\" but the younger sons all answered  \"We are not able to take care of ourselves, either you come with us  to protect us or we will stay here.\" Then the merchant told his eldest  son to escape alone so that their family might not become extinct.    So the eldest son took a supply of money and went away into a far  country. After travelling a long time he came to a town where a  Raja lived and decided to stay there; so he first went to a tank and  bathed and sat down on the bank to eat some refreshment; and as he  sat the daughter of the Raja came down to the tank to bathe and she  saw the merchant's son and their eyes met. Then the princess sent  her maid-servants to ask him where he came from; and he told them  where he came from and that he meant to make a stay in that town,  and he promised them a rupee if they could persuade the princess to  uncover her face. They went and told their mistress all this and she  answered \"Go and get your rupee from him, I will uncover my face;  and ask him what he wants.\" And when they went, she drew aside the  cloth from her face; then he gave them the rupee, and they asked him  whether he had seen her and what his intention was; then he said that  his wish was to marry the princess and live with her in her father's  house! When the princess heard this she said \"Yes, my heart has gone  out to him also;\" so then she bathed and went home and lay down in  her room and would not get up, and when her father asked her what  was the matter, she made no answer. Then they asked her maidens what  was the matter and they said that she had seen a stranger by the  tank and wished to marry him. The Rani asked whether the stranger  was still there and they said that they had left him by the tank. So  two men were sent to fetch the stranger or to find out where he had  gone. The two servants went and found the merchant's son just ready  to continue his journey, and they asked him who he was and what he  wanted. He said that he was looking for employment but would like  best to marry and live in the house of his father-in-law. Then they  told him not go away and they would arrange such a marriage for him,  so they took him to a house in the town and left him there and went  back to the Raja. They told the Raja that the stranger had gone away  but that they could follow him and bring him back if he gave them some  money for their journey. So the Raja gave them two rupees; then they  went off but only ate their dinner at home, and then they brought  the merchant's son to the Raja, pretending that they had overtaken  him a long way off. He was questioned about himself and he told his  whole history except that the Raja had threatened to cut off his  family, and his account being satisfactory it was arranged that he  should marry the princess. Musicians were sent for and the marriage  took place at once. After his marriage the merchant's son was much  depressed at the thought of his brothers' fate and in the middle of  the night he used to rise up and weep till the bed was soaked with  his tears; the princess noticed this and one night she pretended to  go to sleep but really lay awake and watched her husband; and in the  middle of the night saw him rise quietly and begin to sob. She was  filled with sympathy and went to him and begged him to tell her what  was the matter and whether he was sorry that he had married her; and  he answered \"I cry because I am in despair; in the daytime I restrain  my tears before others with difficulty but in the night they cannot  be kept back; but I am ashamed for you to see me and I wait till you  are asleep before I give way to my feelings.\"    Then she asked what was the cause of his sorrow and he answered \"My  father and mother and brothers and sisters are all doomed to die;  for our Raja has sworn to kill them by a certain day if he is not  told why two fish, which my father sent to him as a present, laughed  when they were brought before him. In consequence of this threat  my father sent me from home that one of the family might survive  and although I may be safe here the thought of them and their fate  makes me weep.\" The princess asked him what was the day fixed for  the mystery to be explained; and he told her that it was at the  full moon of a certain month. Then the princess said \"Come take me  to your father's house: I shall be able to explain why the fishes  laughed.\" The merchant's son joyfully agreed to start off the next  day; so in the morning they told the Raja why they wished to go, and  he said to his daughter \"Go and do not be afraid; go in confidence,  I promise you that you will be able to explain why the fishes laughed.\"    So they made ready and journeyed to the merchant's house; and when  they arrived they told the merchant to go to the Raja and ask him  to collect all the citizens on a certain day to hear the reason why  the fishes laughed. The merchant went to the Raja and the Raja gave  him a letter fixing the day and all the citizens were assembled in  an open plain; and the princess dressed herself as a man and went to  the assembly and stood before the Raja.    Then the Raja bade her explain why the fishes laughed, and the princess  answered \"If you wish to know the reason order all your Ranis to be  brought here;\" so the Ranis were summoned; then the princess said  \"The reason why the fishes laughed was because among all your wives  it is only the eldest Rani who is a woman and all the others are  men. What will you give me if this is not proved to be true?\" Then  the Raja wrote a bond promising to give the merchant half his kingdom  if this were proved to be true. When enquiry was made it was found  that the wives had really become men, and the Raja was put to shame  before all his people. Then the assembly broke up and the merchant  received half the Raja's kingdom.          XIX. How the Cowherd Found a Bride.    There was once a Goala who was in charge of a herd of cattle and  every day he used to bring the herd for their midday rest to the  foot of a peepul tree. One day the peepul tree spoke and said to him  \"If you pour milk every day at my roots I will grant you a boon.\" So  thenceforward the Goala every day poured milk at the roots of the tree  and after some days he saw a crack in the ground; he thought that  the roots of the tree were cracking the earth but the fact was that  a snake was buried there, and as it increased in size from drinking  the milk it cracked the ground and one day it issued forth; at the  sight of it the Goala was filled with fear and made sure that the  snake would devour him. But the snake said \"Do not fear: I was shut  up in the nether world, and you by your kindness have rescued me,  I wish to show gratitude to you and will confer on you any boon for  which you ask.\" The Goala answered that the snake should choose what  he would give him; then the snake called him near, and breathed on  his hair which was very long and it became glistening as gold, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11951"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 1 (#12)"],[1,"long upon  particular places and in connection with particular names which have  remained historical.  In the war with the confederation of the AEduans,  that of the Arvernians called to their aid the German Ariovistus,  chieftain of a confederation of tribes which, under the name of Suevians,  were roving over the right bank of the Rhine, ready at any time to cross  the river.  Ariovistus, with fifteen thousand warriors at his back, was  not slow in responding to the appeal.  The AEdaans were beaten; and  Ariovistus settled amongst the Gauls who had been thoughtless enough to  appeal to him.  Numerous bands of Suevians came and rejoined him; and in  two or three years after his victory he had about him, it was said, one  hundred and twenty thousand warriors.  He had appropriated to them a  third of the territory of his Gallic allies, and he imperiously demanded  another third to satisfy other twenty-five thousand of his old German  comrades, who asked to share his booty and his new country.  One of the  foremost AEduans, Divitiacus by name, went and invoked the succor of the  Roman people, the patrons of his confederation.  He was admitted to the  presence of the Senate, and invited to be seated; but he modestly  declined, and standing, leaning upon his shield, he set forth the  sufferings and the claims of his country.  He received kindly promises,  which at first remained without fruit.  He, however, remained at Rome,  persistent in his solicitations, and carrying on intercourse with several  Romans of consideration, notably with Cicero, who says of him, \"I knew  Divitiacus, the AEduan, who claimed proficiency in that natural science  which the Greeks call physiology, and he predicted the future, either by  augury or his own conjecture.\"  The Roman Senate, with the indecision and  indolence of all declining powers, hesitated to engage, for the AEduans'  sake, in a war against the invaders of a corner of Gallic territory.  At  the same time that they gave a cordial welcome to Divitiacus, they  entered into negotiations with Ariovistus himself; they gave him  beautiful presents, the title of King, and even of friend; the only  demand they made was, that he should live peaceably in his new  settlement, and not lend his support to the fresh invasions of which  there were symptoms in Gaul, and which were becoming too serious for  resolutions not to be taken to repel them.    [Illustration: Divitiacus before the Roman Senate----63]    A people of Gallic race, the Helvetians, who inhabited present  Switzerland, where the old name still abides beside the modern, found  themselves incessantly threatened, ravaged, and invaded by the German  tribes which pressed upon their frontiers.  After some years of  perplexity and internal discord, the whole Helvetic nation decided upon  abandoning its territory, and going to seek in Gaul, westward, it is  said, on the borders of the ocean, a more tranquil settlement.  Being  informed of this design, the Roman Senate and Caesar, at that time  consul, resolved to protect the Roman province and their Gallic allies,  the AEduans, against this inundation of roving neighbors.  The Helvetians  none the less persisted in their plan; and in the spring of the year of  Rome 696 (58 B C.) they committed to the flames, in the country they were  about to leave, twelve towns, four hundred villages, and all their  houses; loaded their cars with provisions for three months, and agreed to  meet at the southern point of the Lake of Geneva.  They found on their  reunion, says Caesar, a total of three hundred and sixty-eight thousand  emigrants, including ninety-two thousand men-at-arms.  The Switzerland  which they abandoned numbers now two million five hundred thousand  inhabitants.  But when the Helvetians would have entered Gaul, they found  there Caesar, who, after having got himself appointed proconsul for five  years, had arrived suddenly at Geneva, prepared to forbid their passage.  They sent to him a deputation, to ask leave, they said, merely to  traverse the Roman province without causing the least damage.  Caesar  knew as well how to gain time as not to lose any: he was not ready; so he  put off the Helvetians to a second conference.  In the interval he  employed his legionaries, who could work as well as fight, in erecting  upon the left bank of the Rhone a wall sixteen feet high and ten miles  long, which rendered the passage of the river very difficult, and, on the  return of the Helvetian envoys, he formally forbade them to pass by the  road they had proposed to follow.  They attempted to take another, and to  cross not the Rhone but the Saone, and march thence towards western Gaul.  But whilst they were arranging for the execution of this movement,  Caesar, who had up to that time only four legions at his disposal,  returned to Italy, brought away five fresh legions, and arrived on the  left bank of the Saone at the moment when the rear-guard of the  Helvetians was embarking to rejoin the main body which had already  pitched its camp on the right bank.  Caesar cut to pieces this rear-guard,  crossed the river, in his turn, with his legions, pursued the emigrants  without relaxation, came in contact with them on several occasions, at  one time attacking them or repelling their attacks, at another receiving  and giving audience to their envoys without ever consenting to treat with  them, and before the end of the year he had so completely beaten,  decimated, dispersed and driven them back, that of three hundred and  sixty-eight thousand Helvetians who had entered Gaul, but one hundred and  ten thousand escaped from the Romans, and were enabled, by flight, to  regain their country.    [Illustration: Mounted Gauls----66]    AEduans, Sequanians, or Arvernians, all the Gauls interested in the  struggle thus terminated, were eager to congratulate Caesar upon his  victory; but if they were delivered from the invasion of the Helvetians,  another scourge fell heavily upon them; Ariovistus and the Germans, who  were settled upon their territory, oppressed them cruelly, and day by day  fresh bands were continually coming to aggravate the evil and the danger.  They adjured Caesar to protect them from these swarms of barbarians.  \"In  a few years,\" said they, \"all the Germans will have crossed the Rhine,  and all the Gauls will be driven from Gaul, for the soil of Germany  cannot compare with that of Gaul, any more than the mode of life.  If  Caesar and the Roman people refuse to aid us, there is nothing left for  us but to abandon our lands, as the Helvetians would have done in their  case, and go seek, afar from the Germans, another dwelling-place.\"  Caesar, touched by so prompt an appeal to the power of his name and fame  gave ear to the prayer of the Gauls.  But he was for trying negotiation  before war.  He proposed to Ariovistus an interview \"at which they aright  treat in common of affairs of importance for both.\"  Ariovistus replied  that \"if he wanted anything of Caesar, he would go in search of him; if  Caesar had business with him, it was for Caesar to come.\"  Caesar  thereupon conveyed to him by messenger his express injunctions, \"not to  summon any more from the borders of the Rhine fresh multitudes of men,  and to cease from vexing the AEduans and making war on them, them and  their allies.  Otherwise, Caesar would not fail to avenge their wrongs.\"  Ariovistus replied that \"he had conquered the AEduans.  The Roman people  were in the habit of treating the vanquished after their own pleasure,  and not the advice of another; he too, himself, had the same right.  Caesar said he would avenge the wrongs of the AEduans; but no one had  ever attacked him with impunity.  If Caesar would like to try it, let him  come; he would learn what could be done by the bravery of the Germans,  who were as yet unbeaten, who were trained to arms, who for fourteen  years had not slept beneath a roof.\"  At the moment he received this  answer, Caesar had just heard that fresh bands of Suevians were encamped  on the right bank of the Rhine, ready to cross, and that Ariovistus with  all his forces was making towards Vesontio (Besancon), the chief town of  the Sequanians.  Caesar forthwith put himself in motion, occupied  Vesontio, established there a strong garrison, and made his arrangements  for issuing from it with his legions to go and anticipate the attack of  Ariovistus.  Then came to him word that no little disquietude was showing  itself among the Roman troops; that many soldiers and even officers  appeared anxious about the struggle with the Germans, their ferocity, the  vast forests that must be traversed to reach them, the difficult roads,  and the transport of provisions; there was an apprehension of broken  courage, and perchance of numerous desertions.  Caesar summoned a great  council of war, to which he called the chief officers of his legions; he  complained bitterly of their alarm, recalled to their memory their recent  success against the Helvetians, and scoffed at the rumors spread about  the Germans, and at the doubts with which there was an attempt to inspire  him about the fidelity and obedience of his troops.  \"An army,\" said he,  \"disobeys only the commander who leads them badly and has no good  fortune, or is found guilty of cupidity and malversation.  My whole life  shows my integrity, and the war against the Helvetians my good fortune.  I shall order forthwith the departure I had intended to put off.  I shall  strike the camp the very next night, at the fourth watch; I wish to see  as soon as possible whether honor and duty or fear prevail in your ranks.  If there be any refusal to follow me, I shall march with only the tenth  legion, of which I have no doubt; that shall be my praetorian cohort.\"    The cheers of the troops, officers and men, were the answer given to the  reproaches and hopes of their general: all hesitation passed away; and  Caesar set out with his army.
