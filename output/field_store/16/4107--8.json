Not at all more. What then \"seems\" to  every man is not sufficient for determining what \"is\"; for neither in  the case of weights nor measures are we satisfied with the bare  appearance, but in each case we have discovered a certain rule. In this  matter then is there no rule superior to what \"seems\"? And how is it  possible that the most necessary things among men should have no sign  (mark), and be incapable of being discovered? There is then some rule.  And why then do we not seek the rule and discover it, and afterwards use  it without varying from it, not even stretching out the finger without  it? For this, I think, is that which when it is discovered cures of  their madness those who use mere \"seeming\" as a measure, and misuse it;  so that for the future proceeding from certain things (principles) known  and made clear we may use in the case of particular things the  preconceptions which are distinctly fixed.    What is the matter presented to us about which we are inquiring?  Pleasure (for example). Subject it to the rule, throw it into the  balance. Ought the good to be such a thing that it is fit that we have  confidence in it? Yes. And in which we ought to confide? It ought to be.  Is it fit to trust to anything which is insecure? No. Is then pleasure  anything secure? No. Take it then and throw it out of the scale, and  drive it far away from the place of good things. But if you are not  sharp-sighted, and one balance is not enough for you, bring another. Is  it fit to be elated over what is good? Yes. Is it proper then to be  elated over present pleasure? See that you do not say that it is proper;  but if you do, I shall then not think you worthy even of the balance.  Thus things are tested and weighed when the rules are ready. And to  philosophize is this, to examine and confirm the rules; and then to use  them when they are known is the act of a wise and good man.           *       *       *       *       *    OF DISPUTATION OR DISCUSSION.--What things a man must learn in order to  be able to apply the art of disputation, has been accurately shown by  our philosophers (the Stoics); but with respect to the proper use of the  things, we are entirely without practice. Only give to any of us, whom  you please, an illiterate man to discuss with, and he cannot discover  how to deal with the man. But when he has moved the man a little, if he  answers beside the purpose, he does not know how to treat him, but he  then either abuses or ridicules him, and says, He is an illiterate man;  it is not possible to do anything with him. Now a guide, when he has  found a man out of the road, leads him into the right way; he does not  ridicule or abuse him and then leave him. Do you also show the  illiterate man the truth, and you will see that he follows. But so long  as you do not show him the truth, do not ridicule him, but rather feel  your own incapacity.    Now this was the first and chief peculiarity of Socrates, never to be  irritated in argument, never to utter anything abusive, anything  insulting, but to bear with abusive persons and to put an end to the  quarrel. If you would know what great power he had in this way, read the  Symposium of Xenophon, and you will see how many quarrels he put an end  to. Hence with good reason in the poets also this power is most highly  praised:      Quickly with skill he settles great disputes.    Hesiod, Theogony, v. 87.           *       *       *       *       *    ON ANXIETY (SOLICITUDE).--When I see a man anxious, I say, What does  this man want? If he did not want something which is not in his power,  how could he be anxious? For this reason a lute player when he is  singing by himself has no anxiety, but when he enters the theatre, he is  anxious, even if he has a good voice and plays well on the lute; for he  not only wishes to sing well, but also to obtain applause: but this is  not in his power. Accordingly, where he has skill, there he has  confidence. Bring any single person who knows nothing of music, and the  musician does not care for him. But in the matter where a man knows  nothing and has not been practised, there he is anxious. What matter is  this? He knows not what a crowd is or what the praise of a crowd is.  However, he has learned to strike the lowest chord and the highest; but  what the praise of the many is, and what power it has in life, he  neither knows nor has he thought about it. Hence he must of necessity  tremble and grow pale. Is any man then afraid about things which are not  evils? No. Is he afraid about things which are evils, but still so far  within his power that they may not happen? Certainly he is not. If then  the things which are independent of the will are neither good nor bad,  and all things which do depend on the will are within our power, and no  man can either take them from us or give them to us, if we do not  choose, where is room left for anxiety? But we are anxious about our  poor body, our little property, about the will of Caesar; but not anxious  about things internal. Are we anxious about not forming a false opinion?  No, for this is in my power. About not exerting our movements contrary  to nature? No, not even about this. When then you see a man pale, as the  physician says, judging from the complexion, this man's spleen is  disordered, that man's liver; so also say, this man's desire and  aversion are disordered, he is not in the right way, he is in a fever.  For nothing else changes the color, or causes trembling or chattering of  the teeth, or causes a man to      Sink in his knees and shift from foot to foot.    Iliad, xiii., 281.    For this reason, when Zeno was going to meet Antigonus, he was not  anxious, for Antigonus had no power over any of the things which Zeno  admired; and Zeno did not care for those things over which Antigonus had  power. But Antigonus was anxious when he was going to meet Zeno, for he  wished to please Zeno; but this was a thing external (out of his power).  But Zeno did not want to please Antigonus; for no man who is skilled in  any art wishes to please one who has no such skill.    Should I try to please you? Why? I suppose, you know the measure by  which one man is estimated by another. Have you taken pains to learn  what is a good man and what is a bad man, and how a man becomes one or  the other? Why then are you not good yourself? How, he replies, am I not  good? Because no good man laments or groans or weeps, no good man is  pale and trembles, or says, How will he receive me, how will he listen  to me? Slave, just as it pleases him. Why do you care about what belongs  to others? Is it now his fault if he receives badly what proceeds from  you? Certainly. And is it possible that a fault should be one man's, and  the evil in another? No. Why then are you anxious about that which  belongs to others? Your question is reasonable; but I am anxious how I  shall speak to him. Cannot you then speak to him as you choose? But I  fear that I may be disconcerted? If you are going to write the name of  Dion, are you afraid that you would be disconcerted? By no means. Why?  is it not because you have practised writing the name? Certainly. Well,  if you were going to read the name, would you not feel the same? and  why? Because every art has a certain strength and confidence in the  things which belong to it. Have you then not practised speaking? and  what else did you learn in the school? Syllogisms and sophistical  propositions? For what purpose? was it not for the purpose of  discoursing skilfully? and is not discoursing skilfully the same as  discoursing seasonably and cautiously and with intelligence, and also  without making mistakes and without hindrance, and besides all this with  confidence? Yes. When then you are mounted on a horse and go into a  plain, are you anxious at being matched against a man who is on foot,  and anxious in a matter in which you are practised, and he is not? Yes,  but that person (to whom I am going to speak) has power to kill me.  Speak the truth, then, unhappy man, and do not brag, nor claim to be a  philosopher, nor refuse to acknowledge your masters, but so long as you  present this handle in your body, follow every man who is stronger than  yourself. Socrates used to practice speaking, he who talked as he did to  the tyrants, to the dicasts (judges), he who talked in his prison.  Diogenes had practised speaking, he who spoke as he did to Alexander, to  the pirates, to the person who bought him. These men were confident in  the things which they practised. But do you walk off to your own affairs  and never leave them: go and sit in a corner, and weave syllogisms, and  propose them to another. There is not in you the man who can rule a  state.           *       *       *       *       *    TO NASO.--When a certain Roman entered with his son and listened to one  reading, Epictetus said, This is the method of instruction; and he  stopped. When the Roman asked him to go on, Epictetus said, Every art  when it is taught causes labor to him who is unacquainted with it and is  unskilled in it, and indeed the things which proceed from the arts  immediately show their use in the purpose for which they were made; and  most of them contain something attractive and pleasing. For indeed to be  present and to observe how a shoemaker learns is not a pleasant thing;  but the shoe is useful and also not disagreeable to look at. And the  discipline of a smith when he is learning is very disagreeable to one  who chances to be present and is a stranger to the art: but the work  shows the use of the art. But you will see this much more in music; for  if you are present while a person is learning, the discipline will  appear most disagreeable; and yet the results of music are pleasing and  delightful to those who know nothing of music. And here we conceive the  work of a philosopher to be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10662"],[0,"The Night Land (#12)"],[1,"y, all about me there came her voice thrilling, and the  voice was the voice of Mirdath, and the voice of Naani; and I heard the  tears of her spirit make pure and wonderful the bewildered and growing  gladness of her far voice. And she asked me, as one who had suddenly  opened the Gates of Memory, whether she might be truly Mirdath. And I,  utter weak and shaken strangely because of this splendour of fulfilment,  could make no instant answer. And she asked again, but using mine old  love-name, and with a sureness in her far voice. And still I was so  strangely dumb, and the blood to thud peculiar in mine ears; and this to  pass; and speech to come swift.    And this way to be that meeting of our spirits, across all the  everlasting night.    And you shall have for a memory-picture, how that Naani stood there in  the world in that far eternity, and, with her spirit having speech with  mine, looked back through the part-opened gates of her memory, into the  past of this our life and Age. Yet more than this she saw, and more than  was given to me in that Age; for she had memory now and sight of other  instances, and of other comings together, which had some confusion and  but half-meanings to me. Yet of this our present Age and life, we spoke  as of some yesterday; but very hallowed.    Now, as may be conceived, the wonder of this surety which had come into  my life stirred me fiercely to its completion; for all my heart and  spirit cried out to be with that one who was Mirdath, and now spoke with  the voice of Naani.    Yet, how should this be won; for none among all the learned men of that  Mighty Pyramid knew the position of the Lesser Redoubt; neither could  the Records and Histories of the World give us that knowledge; only that  there was a general thought among the Students and the Monstruwacans  that it lay between the North-West and the North-East. But no man had  any surety; neither could any conceive of the distance from us of that  Refuge.    And counting all this, there was yet the incredible danger and peril of  the Night Land, and the hunger and desolation of the Outer Lands, which  were sometimes named the Unknown Lands.    And I spoke much with Naani concerning this matter of their position;  yet neither she nor her father, the Master Monstruwacan of that Refuge,  had any knowing either of our position; only that the Builder of the  Lesser Redoubt had come out of the Southward World in the Beginning, as  they had knowledge of by the Records.    Also, the father of Naani set that ancient Compass to bear; for, as he  made explanation to us through the Instrument, so great a power of the  Earth-Current must be ours that, perchance it was our force which did  affect the pointer from steadfastness. For, indeed, the needle did swing  in an arc, as we heard, that held between the North and the South;  within the Westward arc; but this it had done ever with them, and so was  a very helpless guide; save that, maybe, as we had thought, the force of  the Earth-Current that was with us, had in truth some power to pull the  needle towards us. And if this were so of verity, we made a reckoning  that set the Lesser Redoubt to the North; and they did likewise, and put  us to the South; yet was it all built upon the sand of guess-work; and  nothing to adventure the life and soul upon.    Now we, of curiosity; though a million times had it been done in the  past ages, set the compass before us, having it from the Great Museum.  But, as ever in that age, it did spin if we but stirred the needle, and  would stop nowheres with surety, for the flow of the Earth-Current from  the \"Crack\" beneath the Pyramid had a power to affect it away from the  North, and to set it wandering. And this may seem very strange to this  present Age; yet to that, it was most true to the seeming nature of  things; and harder to believe that ever it did once point steadfastly,  to prove a guide of sureness, and unfailing.    For, be it known, we knew the positions of the Land by tradition, coming  from that ancient time when, in the Half-Gloom they had builded the  Pyramid; they having known the use of that ancient compass, and with  sight of the Sun had named the Positions; though we of that far future  day had forgotten the very beginnings of those Names of Direction; and  used them but because our fathers did a million years and more. And  likewise we did the same with the names of the day and the night and the  weeks and the months and the years; though of the visible markings of  these there was nothing but only and always the everlasting night; yet  the same seeming very natural to that people.    Now, Naani, having heed to my constant questions, craved with an utter  keen hunger that I might come to her; but yet forbade it, in that it  were better to live and commune in the spirit, than to risk my soul, and  mayhaps die, in the foolishness of trying to find her in all the  darkness of the dead world. Yet, no heed had I taken of her commands,  had I but known of a surety the _direction_ in which she might be  discovered; and gained some knowledge of the space between, for this  might be named by thousands of miles, or but by hundreds; though a great  distance it was surely.    Yet, one other thing there was, that has point in this place; for when I  sent my speech out into the night, using my brain-elements, I came to  know that, whether I had a knowledge of the North, or no knowledge at  the moment, yet did I turn oft with a sure instinction to that  Direction. And of this, the Master Monstruwacan took very great note,  and had me to experiment many a time and way, and so enclosed about with  screens, or with bandages across mine eyes, that I could not, save by  that inward Knowing, have any knowledge to point me the way. Yet would I  turn Northwards very frequent, by a certain feeling; and seemed unable  of speech, if I were turned otherwise by force.    But when we asked Naani whether she had an unusualness in this matter,  she could discover none; and we could but take note curiously of that  which affected my habits; and which truly I set to the attracting of her  spirit; for I had mind that she did be somewheres out that way in the  darkness of the world; but yet was this no more than to suppose, as you  perceive.    And the Master Monstruwacan wrote a study of this matter of the  Northwardness of my turning; and it was set out in the Hour-Slips of the  Tower of Observation; and so it came to be copied by the Hour-Slips of  the great cities, and made much comment, and much calling up to me  through the home instruments; so that with this, and the speech that  went about concerning my powers to hear, I was much in talk, and  diversely pleased and oft angered by overmuch attention and importunity.    And now, whilst I pondered this matter in all my spirit and being, how  that I should some way come to Naani, there befell a very terrible  thing. And in this wise must I tell it:    It was at the seventeenth hour, when all the millions of the Mighty  Pyramid slept, that I was with the Master Monstruwacan in the Tower of  Observation taking my due turn. And sudden, I heard the thrilling of the  aether all about me, and the voice of Naani in my soul, speaking. And I  sent the Master-Word into the darkness of the world, and presently, I  heard the solemn answer beating steadfastly in the night; and  immediately I called to Naani with my brain-elements, to know what thing  troubled her in her sleep.    And her voice came into my spirit, weak and far and faint, and so that  scarce I could make to hear the words. Yet, in a while I gathered that  all the peoples of the Lesser Redoubt were in very deadly trouble; for  that the Earth-Current had failed suddenly and mightily; and they had  called her from her sleep, that she might listen whether we answered  their callings by the Instrument; but, indeed, no calling had come to  us.    And they who had been of late so joyful, were now grown old with sorrow  in but an hour or two; for they feared that the fresh coming of the  Earth-Current had been but the final flicker and outburst before the  end. And, even in this short while of our speech, did it seem to me that  the voice of Naani grew further off from me; and I felt like to have  broken my heart with the trouble of this thing.    And through all that remained of that sleep-time, did I converse with  Naani, as might two lovers who shall presently part forever. And when  the cities awoke, the news went throughout them, and all our millions  were in sorrow and trouble.    And thus was it for, maybe, a little month; and in that time had the  voice of Naani grown so weak and far-off that even I that had the  Night-Hearing, could scarce make real its meaning. And every word was to  me a treasure and a touch upon my soul; and my grief and trouble before  this certain parting drove me that I could not eat, neither have rest;  and this did the Master Monstruwacan take upon him to chide and correct;  for that, if any were to help, how should it be done if I that had the  Night-Hearing, and heard even now that the recording Instruments were  dumb, came to ill-health.    And because of this, and such wisdom as was mine, I made to eat and  order my life that I might have my full powers. Yet was this beyond all  my strength; for, presently, I knew that the people of the Lesser  Pyramid were threatened by the monsters that beset them; and later I had  knowledge from faint, far words whispered in my brain, that there had  been a fight with an outside Force that had harmed many in their minds;  so that in madness they had opened the gate and had run from the Lesser  Pyramid, out into the darkness of the Lands about them; and there had  their physical bodies fallen to the monsters of those Lands; but of  their souls who may know?    And this, we set assuredly to the failure of the Earth-Current, which  had robbed them of all force and power; so that, in"]]]
