She had not cried out.    \"You're not--\" he had said in the first moment.    \"I am not who?\" asked the girl with amazing steadiness. But he saw her  hand go back to the dressing table and open, with incredible deftness  and speed, the little top drawer behind her.    \"Don't do that!\" said Ronicky softly, but sharply. \"Keep your hand off  that table, lady, if you don't mind.\"    She hesitated a fraction of a second. In that moment she seemed to see  that he was in earnest, and that it would be foolish to tamper with  him.    \"Stand away from that table; sit down yonder.\"    Again she obeyed without a word. Her eyes, to be sure, flickered here  and there about the room, as though they sought some means of sending  a warning to her friends, or finding some escape for herself. Then her  glance returned to Ronicky Doone.    \"Well,\" she said, as she settled in the chair. \"Well?\"    A world of meaning in those two small words--a world of dread  controlled. He merely stared at her thoughtfully.    \"I hit the wrong trail, lady,\" he said quietly. \"I was looking for  somebody else.\"    She started. \"You were after--\" She stopped.    \"That's right, I guess,\" he admitted.    \"How many of you are there?\" she asked curiously, so curiously that  she seemed to be forgetting the danger. \"Poor Carry Smith with a  mob--\" She stopped suddenly again. \"What did you do to Harry Morgan?\"    \"I left him safe and quiet,\" said Ronicky Doone.    The girl's face hardened strangely. \"What you are, and what your game  is I don't know,\" she said. \"But I'll tell you this: I'm letting you  play as if you had all the cards in the deck. But you haven't. I've  got one ace that'll take all your trumps. Suppose I call once what'll  happen to you, pal?\"    \"You don't dare call,\" he said.    \"Don't dare me,\" said the girl angrily. \"I hate a dare worse than  anything in the world, almost.\" For a moment her green-blue eyes were  pools of light flashing angrily at him.    Into the hand of Ronicky Doone, with that magic speed and grace for  which his fame was growing so great in the mountain desert, came the  long, glimmering body of the revolver, and, holding it at the hip, he  threatened her.    She shrank back at that, gasping. For there was an utter surety about  this man's handling of the weapon. The heavy gun balanced and steadied  in his slim fingers, as if it were no more than a feather's weight.    \"I'm talking straight, lady,\" said Ronicky Doone. \"Sit down--pronto!\"    In the very act of obedience she straightened again. \"It's bluff,\" she  said. \"I'm going through that door!\" Straight for the door she went,  and Ronicky Doone set his teeth.    \"Go back!\" he commanded. He glided to the door and blocked her way,  but the gun hung futile in his hand.    \"It's easy to pull a gun, eh?\" said the girl, with something of a  sneer. \"But it takes nerve to use it. Let me through this door!\"    \"Not in a thousand years,\" said Ronicky.    She laid her hand on the door and drew it back--it struck his  shoulder--and Ronicky gave way with a groan and stood with his head  bowed. Inwardly he cursed himself. Doubtless she was used to men who  bullied her, as if she were another man of an inferior sort. Doubtless  she despised him for his weakness. But, though he gritted his teeth,  he could not make himself firm. Those old lessons which sink into a  man's soul in the West came back to him and held him. In the helpless  rage which possessed him he wanted battle above all things in the  world. If half a dozen men had poured through the doorway he would  have rejoiced. But this one girl was enough to make him helpless.    He looked up in amazement. She had not gone; in fact, she had closed  the door slowly and stood with her back against it, staring at him in  a speechless bewilderment.    \"What sort of a man are you?\" asked the girl at last.    \"A fool,\" said Ronicky slowly. \"Go out and round up your friends; I  can't stop you.\"    \"No,\" said the girl thoughtfully, \"but that was a poor bluff at  stopping me.\"    He nodded. And she hesitated still, watching his face closely.    \"Listen to me,\" she said suddenly. \"I have two minutes to talk to you,  and I'll give you those two minutes. You can use them in getting out  of the house--I'll show you a way--or you can use them to tell me just  why you've come.\"    In spite of himself Ronicky smiled. \"Lady,\" he said, \"if a rat was in  a trap d'you think he'd stop very long between a chance of getting  clear and a chance to tell how he come to get into the place?\"    \"I have a perfectly good reason for asking,\" she answered. \"Even if  you now get out of the house safely you'll try to come back later on.\"    \"Lady,\" said Ronicky, \"do I look as plumb foolish as that?\"    \"You're from the West,\" she said in answer to his slang.    \"Yes.\"    She considered the straight-looking honesty of his eyes. \"Out West,\"  she said, \"I know you men are different. Not one of the men I know  here would take another chance as risky as this, once they were out of  it. But out there in the mountains you follow long trails, trails that  haven't anything but a hope to lead you along them? Isn't that so?\"    \"Maybe,\" admitted Ronicky. \"It's the fever out of the gold days, lady.  You start out chipping rocks to find the right color; maybe you never  find the right color; maybe you never find a streak of pay stuff, but  you keep on trying. You're always just sort of around the corner from  making a big strike.\"    She nodded, smiling again, and the smiles changed her pleasantly, it  seemed to Ronicky Doone. At first she had impressed him almost as a  man, with her cold, steady eyes, but now she was all woman, indeed.    \"That's why I say that you'll come back. You won't give up with one  failure. Am I right?\"    He shrugged his shoulders. \"I dunno. If the trail fever hits me  again--maybe I would come back.\"    \"You started to tell me. It's because of Caroline Smith?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"You don't have to talk to me,\" said the girl. \"As a matter of fact I  shouldn't be here listening to you. But, I don't know why, I want to  help you. You--you are in love with Caroline?\"    \"No,\" said Ronicky.    Her expression grew grave and cold again. \"Then why are you here  hunting for her? What do you want with her?\"    \"Lady,\" said Ronicky, \"I'm going to show you the whole layout of the  cards. Maybe you'll take what I say right to headquarters--the man  that smiles--and block my game.\"    \"You know him?\" she asked sharply.    Apparently that phrase, \"the man who smiles,\" was enough to identify  him.    \"I've seen him. I dunno what he is, I dunno what you are, lady, but I  figure that you and Caroline Smith and everybody else in this house is  under the thumb of the gent that smiles.\"    Her eyes darkened with a shadow of alarm. \"Go on,\" she said curtly.    \"I'm not going on to guess about what you all are. All I know is what  I'm here trying to do. I'm not working for myself. I'm working for a  partner.\"    She started. \"That's the second man, the one who stopped her on the  street today?\"    \"You're pretty well posted,\" replied Ronicky. \"Yes, that's the one. He  started after Caroline Smith, not even knowing her name--with just  a picture of her. We found out that she lived in sight of the East  River, and pretty soon we located her here.\"    \"And what are you hoping to do?\"    \"To find her and talk to her straight from the shoulder and tell her  what a pile Bill has done to get to her--and a lot of other things.\"    \"Can't he find her and tell her those things for himself?\"    \"He can't talk,\" said Ronicky. \"Not that I'm a pile better, but I  could talk better for a friend than he could talk for himself, I  figure. If things don't go right then I'll know that the trouble is  with the gent with the smile.\"    \"And then?\" asked the girl, very excited and grave.    \"I'll find him,\" said Ronicky Doone.    \"And--\"    \"Lady,\" he replied obliquely, \"because I couldn't use a gun on a girl  ain't no sign that I can't use it on a gent!\"    \"I've one thing to tell you,\" she said, breaking in swiftly on him.  \"Do what you want--take all the chances you care to--but, if you value  your life and the life of your friend, keep away from the man who  smiles.\"    \"I'll have a fighting chance, I guess,\" said Ronicky quietly.\"    \"You'll have no chance at all. The moment he knows your hand is  against him, I don't care how brave or how clever you are, you're  doomed!\"    She spoke with such a passion of conviction that she flushed, and a  moment later she was shivering. It might have been the draft from the  window which made her gather the hazy-green mantle closer about her  and glance over her shoulder; but a grim feeling came to Ronicky Doone  that the reason why the girl trembled and her eyes grew wide, was that  the mention of \"the man who smiles\" had brought the thought of him  into the room like a breath of cold wind.    \"Don't you see,\" she went on gently, \"that I like you? It's the first  and the last time that I'm going to see you, so I can talk. I know  you're honest, and I know you're brave. Why, I can see your whole  character in the way you've stayed by your friend; and, if there's a  possible way of helping you, I'll do it. But you must promise me first  that you'll never cross the man with the sneer, as you call him.\"    \"There's a sort of a fate in it,\" said Ronicky slowly. \"I don't think  I could promise. There's a chill in my bones that tells me I'm going  to meet up with him one of these days.\"    She gasped at that, and, stepping back from him, she appeared to be  searching her mind to discover something which would finally and  completely convince him. At length she found it.    \"Do I look to you like a coward?\" she said. \"Do I seem to be  weak-kneed?\"    He shook his head.    \"And what will a woman fight hardest for?\"    \"For the youngsters she's got,\" said Ronicky "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11894"],[0,"The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose (#12)"],[1,"that mighty host and began to fight with all. And, O  great king, a well-known Danava named Vivindhya, a mighty warrior  wielding a large and powerful bow, encountered Charudeshna! And, O  monarch, the encounter between Charudeshna and Vivindhya was as fierce  as that in days of yore between Vritra and Vasava! And enraged with each  other the combatants pierced each other with their arrows, uttering loud  roars like unto two powerful lions! Then the son of Rukmini fixed on his  bow-string a mighty weapon possessing the splendour of fire or the sun,  and capable of destroying all foes, having first vivified it with  incantations! Then, O monarch, that mighty warrior my son, fired with  wrath, challenged Vivindhya and discharged the weapon at him. And the  Danava struck with that weapon, fell down on the ground a lifeless  corpse! And beholding Vivindhya slain, and the whole host waver, Salwa  advanced again on his beautiful car capable of going everywhere. And, O  king of mighty arms, beholding Salwa on that beautiful car of his, the  combatants of Dwaraka wavered with fear! But, O thou of the Kuru race,  Pradyumna sallied out, and, O great king, bidding the Anarttas be of good  cheer, said, \"Waver ye not, and staying behold me fight! Even I shall,  by force, repel that car with Salwa on it! Ye Yadavas, this day, I  shall, with my weapons like unto serpents discharged from my bow with my  hand, destroy this host of the lord of Saubha! Be of good cheer, ye all!  Fear not! The lord of Saubha will be slain today! Attacked by me, the  wretch will meet with destruction together with his car!\" O son of  Pandu, upon Pradyumna speaking thus with cheerful heart, the Yadava  host, O hero, remained on the field, and began to fight cheerfully!'\"      SECTION XVII    \"Vasudeva continued, 'O bull of the Bharata race, having spoken thus  unto the Yadavas, the son of Rukmini (Pradyumna) ascended his golden  car. And the car he rode was drawn by excellent steeds in mail. And over  it stood a standard bearing the figure of a _Makara_ with gaping mouth  and fierce as Yama. And with his steeds, more flying than running on the  ground, he rushed against the foe. And the hero equipped with quiver and  sword, with fingers cased in leather, twanged his bow possessed of the  splendour of the lightning, with great strength, and transferring it  from hand to hand, as if in contempt of the enemy, spread confusion  among the Danavas and other warriors of the city of Saubha. And as hot  in contempt of the foe, and continuously slew the Danavas in battle, no  one could mark the slightest interval between his successive shafts. And  the colour of his face changed not, and his limbs trembled not. And  people only heard his loud leonine roars indicative of wonderful valour.  And the aquatic monster with mouth wide open, that devourer of all  fishes, placed on golden flag-staff of that best of cars, struck terror  into the hearts of Salwa's warriors. And, O king, Pradyumna, the mower  of foes rushed with speed against Salwa himself so desirous of an  encounter! And, O perpetuator of the Kuru race, braved by the heroic  Pradyumna in that mighty battle, the angry Salwa could ill bear the  challenge! And that conqueror of hostile cities, Salwa, maddened by  anger, descended from his beautiful car of unchecked speed, resolved to  encounter Pradyumna. And the people beheld the fight between Salwa and  the foremost of Vrishni heroes, which was even like unto the encounter  between Vasava with Vali. And, O hero, mounting on his beautiful car  decked with gold and furnished with flags and flag-staffs and quivers,  the illustrious and mighty Salwa began to discharge his arrows at  Pradyumna! Pradyumna also by the energy of his arms, overwhelmed Salwa  in the combat by a thick shower of arrows. The king of Saubha, however,  thus attacked in battle by Pradyumna, endured him not, but discharged at  my son arrows that were like blazing fire. But the mighty Pradyumna  parried off that arrowy shower. Beholding this, Salwa rained on my son  other weapons of blazing splendour. Then, O foremost of monarchs,  pierced by the shafts of Salwa, the son of Rukmini discharged without  loss of time an arrow that was capable of entering the vitals of a foe  in fight. And that winged shaft shot by my son, piercing Salwa's mail,  entered his heart--whereupon he fell down, in a swoon. And beholding the  heroic king Salwa fallen down deprived of sense, the foremost of the  Danavas fled away rending the ground beneath their feet. And, O lord of  the earth, the army of Salwa sent up exclamations of _Oh!_ and _Alas!_  seeing their king, the lord of Saubha, drop down bereft of sense! And O  son of the Kuru race, regaining his senses, the mighty Salwa rose and  all of a sudden discharged his arrows on Pradyumna. Then the heroic and  mighty armed Pradyumna, sorely pierced by his adversary about his  throat, was enfeebled on his car. And, O mighty king, wounding the son  of Rukmini, Salwa sent up a shout like unto the roar of a lion, and  filling the entire earth with it! And, O Bharata, when my son became  senseless, Salwa, without losing a moment, again discharged at him other  shafts difficult to bear. And pierced with numberless arrows and  deprived of his senses, Pradyumna, O chief of the Kuru race, became  motionless on the field of battle!'\"      SECTION XVIII    \"Vasudeva continued, 'O king, afflicted with the arrows of Salwa, when  Pradyumna became senseless the Vrishnis who had come to the fight were  all disheartened and filled with grief! And the combatants of the  Vrishni and Andhaka races burst into exclamations of _Oh!_ and _Alas!_  while great joy was felt by the enemy and beholding him thus deprived of  sense, his trained charioteer, the son of Daruka, soon carried him off  the field by the help of his steeds. The car had not gone far when that  best of warriors regained his senses, and taking up his bow addressed  his charioteer, saying, \"O son of the Suta tribe, what hast thou done?  Why dost thou go leaving the field of battle? This is not the custom of  the Vrishni heroes in battle! O son of a Suta, hast thou been bewildered  at the sight of a Salwa in that fierce encounter? Or hast thou been  disheartened, beholding the fight? O! tell me truly thy mind!\" The  charioteer answered, \"O son of Janardana, I have not been confounded,  nor hath fear taken possession of me. On the other hand, O son of  Kesava, the task, I ween, of vanquishing Salwa is difficult for thee!  Therefore, O hero, I am slowly retiring from the field. This wretch is  stronger than thou art! It behoveth a charioteer to protect the warrior  on the car, however, when he is deprived of his senses! O thou gifted  with length of days, thou shouldst always be protected by me, even as it  behoveth thee to protect me! Thinking that the warrior on the car should  always be protected (by his charioteer), I am carrying thee away!  Further, O thou of mighty arms, thou art alone, while the Danavas are  many. Thinking, O son of Rukmini, that thou art not equal to them in the  encounter, I am going away!\"'    \"Vasudeva continued, 'When the charioteer had spoken thus, he, O  Kauravya, who hath the _makara_ for his mark replied unto him, saying,  \"Turn the car! O son of Daruka, never do so again; never, O Suta, turn  thou from the fight, while I am alive! He is no son of the Vrishni race  who forsaketh the field or slayeth the foe fallen at his feet and crying  _I am thine!_ or killeth a woman, a boy, or an old man, or a warrior in  distress, deprived of his car or with his weapons broken! Thou art born  in the race of charioteers and trained to thy craft! And, O son of  Daruka, thou art acquainted with the customs of the Vrishnis in battle!  Versed as thou art with all the customs of the Vrishnis in battle, do  thou, O Suta, never again fly from the field as thou hast done! What  will the irrepressible Madhava, the elder brother of Gada, say to me  when he heareth that I have left the field of battle in bewilderment or  that I have been struck on the back--a run-away from the combat! What  will the elder brother of Kesava, the mighty-armed Baladeva, clad in  blue and inebriate with wine, say, when he returneth? What also, O Suta,  will that lion among men, the grand-son of Sini (Satyaki), that great  warrior, say on hearing that I have forsaken the fight? And, O  charioteer, what will the ever-victorious Shamva, the irrepressible  Charudeshna, and Gada, and Sarana, and Akrura also of mighty arms, say  unto me! What also will the wives of the Vrishni heroes when they meet  together, say of me who had hitherto been considered as brave and  well-conducted, respectable and possessed of manly pride? They will even  say _This Pradyumna is a coward who cometh here, leaving the battle! Fie  on him!_ They will never say, _Well done!_ Ridicule, with exclamation of  _Fie_, is to me or a person like me, O Suta, more than death! Therefore,  do thou never again leave the field of battle! Reposing the charge on  me, Hari the slayer of Madhu, hath gone to the sacrifice of the Bharata  lion (Yudhishthira)! Therefore, I cannot bear to be quiet now! O Suta,  when the brave Kritavarman was sallying out to encounter Salwa, I  prevented him, saying _I will resist Salwa. Do thou stay!_ For honouring  me the son of Hridika desisted! Having left the field of battle, what  shall I say unto that mighty warrior when I meet him? When that  irrepressible one of mighty arms--the holder of the conch, the discus,  and the mace--returneth, what shall I say unto him of eyes like lotus  leaves? Satyaki, and Valadeva, and others of the Vrishni and Andhaka  races always boast of me! What shall I say unto them? O Suta, having  left the field of battle and with wounds of arrows on my back while  being carried away by thee, I shall, by no means, be able to live!  Therefore, O son of Daruka, turn that car speedily, and never do so  again even in"]]]
