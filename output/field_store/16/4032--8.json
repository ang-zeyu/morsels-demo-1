Besides these sixteen sorts of sinners the fifth court deals with other  types of wicked people; those who do not believe in rewards and  punishments after death, who hinder good causes, who burn incense  without a sincere heart, speak of the sins of others, who burn books  that urge men to be good and worship the Great Dipper, but persist in  eating meat; those who hate men; who repeat sutras and incantations, and  take part in religious ceremonies, but do not fast beforehand; who  slander the Buddhist and Taoist religions; who know how to read, but  refuse to read the ancient and modern exhortations regarding rewards and  punishments; who dig into graves and destroy their marks, who purposely  set fire to trees and underbrush, or are careless with fire in their own  houses; who shoot arrows at animals with the intent, to kill; who urge  and tempt the sick and weak to enter into contests of any kind with  themselves; who throw tiles and stones over neighboring walls, poison  fish in the river, fire guns, or make nets or traps for birds; who sow  salt on the ground, who do not bury dead eats and snakes very deep and  thus cause death to those who dig; who cause men to dig the frozen  ground in winter or spring (the vapors of earth chill such diggers to  death); who tear down adjoining walls and compel their neighbors to move  the kitchen stove; who appropriate public highways, lands, close wells  and stop gutters.    Those who have committed any of the above sins are taken, to the tower  whence they can see their own village and then are consigned to the  great crying hell, Râurava, that is, the fourth of the Buddhist hot  hells. [Footnote: Buddhism distinguishes hot and cold hells. In a  country like India severe cold is a serious torture.] Thence they go to  their respective small hells. When their time has expired, they are  examined in order to see whether they have any other sins which need  punishment.    Those who have committed any of the above sins may not only escape  punishment, but may have their punishment in the sixth court lessened,  if they fast regularly on the eighth day of the first month and take a  vow not to commit these sins. Some sins, however, cannot be arranged for  in such a way, such as the killing of living beings and hurting them;  the associating with heretics; committing fornication with women and  then poisoning them; committing adultery, violence, envy, or injuring  the good name of others; stealing, requiting favors with hatred, and  hearing exhortation but not repenting. These are major sins.    _2. Its Social Value_    The social value of purgatory is quite plain from the description of the  fifth court and of the sinners who are punished therein. Purgatory is  the social mirror of China, wherein the consequences of all unsocial  acts are pictured in such a vivid way as to deter the individual from  committing them. It is effective in China, not only because of the  realistic presentation, but because the opinion of the community is  against such acts and in favor of repressing them on every occasion.    _3. The Buddhist Heaven._    Buddhism brought into China not only a fully developed purgatory but  also a heaven which all may enter. The sovereign of the western heaven  is Amitâbha (or in Chinese O-mi-to-fo), with whom Kuan Yin, the goddess  of Mercy, is usually associated. Amitâbha is explained as meaning  \"boundless age.\" The original meaning is \"boundless light,\" which  suggests a Persian origin with Mannichean influences. The translations  of the Amitâbha sutras were wholly made by natives of central Asia.    Amitâbha is one of the thousand Buddhas; he is regarded as the reflex of  Sakyamuni and is connected also in his earthly incarnation with a monk  called Dharmâkara. This monk desired to become a Buddha. This wish he  presented to Lôkês'vararâja asking him to teach him as to what a Buddha  and a Buddha country ought to be. Lôkês'vararâja imparted this  knowledge. Then the monk after meditation returned having made  forty-eight vows that he would not become a Buddha, until all living  beings should attain salvation in his heaven.    The eighteenth vow expresses his ideal:    \"O Bhagavat, if those beings who have directed their thought towards the  highest perfect knowledge in other worlds, and who, after having heard  my name, when I have obtained Bodhi (knowledge), have meditated on me  with serene thoughts; if at the moment of their death, after having  approached them surrounded by an assembly of monks, I should not stand  before them worshipped by them, that is, so that their thoughts should  not be troubled, then may I not obtain the highest perfect knowledge.\"    A few extracts from the _Amitâbha Vyûha Sûtra_ will illustrate the  Buddhist idea of life in this Pure Land:    \"In the western region beyond one hundred thousand myriads of Buddhist  lands there is a world. Great Happiness by name. This land has a Buddha  called Amitâbha. The living beings there do not suffer any pain, but  enjoy all happiness. Therefore, it is called the land of Pure Delight  ... the land of Pure Delight has seven precious fountains full of water  containing the eight virtues. The bottom of these fountains is covered  with golden sand. On four sides there are steps made of gold, silver,  crystal and glass, precious stones, red pearls, and highly polished  agates. In the pools are variously colored, light emitting lotus flowers  as large as cart wheels, delicate, admirable, odorous and pure...\"    \"The Buddha of this land makes heavenly music. It is covered with gold.  Morning and evening during six hours it rains the wonderful celestial  flowers (Erythrina Indica). All the inhabitants of this land on clear  mornings after dressing offer these celestial flowers to the hundred  thousand myriads of Buddhas of the regions who return to their country  at meal time. When they have eaten they go away again.\"    \"This country possesses every kind of wonderful varicolored birds, the  white egret, the peacock, the parrot, the s'rarika (a long legged bird),  the Kalavingka (a sweet voiced bird) ... All these birds, morning and  evening during the six hours, utter forth a beautiful harmonious sound.  Their song produces the five _indrya_ (roots of faith, energy,  memory, ecstatic meditation, wisdom), the five _bala_ (the powers  of faith, energy, memory, meditation and wisdom), the seven  _bodhyanga_ (the seven degrees of intelligence, memory,  discrimination, energy, tranquillity, ecstatic contemplation,  indifference), and the eight portions of the correct path _marga,_  (the possession of correct views, decision and purity of thought and  will, the ability of reproducing any sound uttered in the universe, vow  of poverty, asceticism, attainment of meditative abstraction of  self-control, religious recollectedness, honesty and virtue), and such  doctrines. When all beings of this land have heard the music, they  declare their faithfulness to the Buddha, Dharma and the Sangha (the  Buddha, the Law and the community of monks).\"    As to those who enter this land it says:    \"All living beings who hear this should make a vow to be born in that  land. How can they reach the Pure Land? All very good men will gather in  that place ... He whose blessedness and virtue are great can be born  into that country. If there is a good man or woman who, on hearing of  Amitâbha, takes this name and holds it in his mind one, two, three,  four, five, six, or seven days, and his whole heart is not distracted,  to that man at death Amitâbha will appear. His heart will not be  disturbed. He will at once enter into life in the land of Pure Delight  of Amitâbha. I see this blessing and hence utter these words. Those  living beings who hear these words should make a vow to be born in that  land.\"    _4. The Harmonization of These Ideas with Ancestor Worship_    The extension of life beyond the grave in purgatory, or in the Pure Land  and through transmigration was readily accepted in China. Both the new  ideas and the disciplines through which to realize them were eagerly  adopted, and have held their place to this day. In other lands the  creation of a heaven and a hades has weakened the grip of ancestor  worship and ultimately displaced it. In China the opposite result has  obtained, due, no doubt, to the fact that the family system and along  with it the supreme duty of filial piety were fostered by the state and  Buddhism and its teachings were permitted only in so far as they  bolstered it up. Another reason lies in the agricultural basis of  China's civilization, reenforced by the great difficulty of  communication, which tended to make the family system dominant in China.  Today, the improvement of communication and the introduction of the  industrial system of the West with the individual emphasis of modern  education are factors which are weakening the family system and with it  ancestral worship.          VIII      THE SPIRITUAL VALUES EMPHASIZED BY BUDDHISM IN CHINA    Near the House of Parliament in Peking is located a small monastery  dedicated to the goddess of Mercy, Kuan Yin. Before her image the  incense burners send forth curling clouds of smoke. The walls are  decorated with old paintings of gods and goddesses.

We now prepared for the march westward, when Hassan said  he would go back to near the Mijjertaine frontier, where rain had  lately fallen, and all the Warsingalis had migrated with their cattle,  to fetch some ponies, which he would bring to me in a few days, even  before I could arrive at the Dulbahanta frontier, and begged a gun at  parting as Judge's fee for his settlement of the Abban question, and  as an earnest that he would bring the five ponies which I wanted. We  then got under way, and travelled westward, bidding Rhut Tug adieu,  but every one was stiff and formal. Sumunter had not confessed  contrition, and I had not committed myself to saying that I would hush  the matter up, assuring him that in duty as a public officer I could  not, that I was bound to report every circumstance, though privately I  promised a pardon as before. After travelling a little way, we emerged  from the low land of the valley, and ascended a higher track to the  normal level of the plateau, which, as I have said before, was all  bleak and barren, with scarcely a tree growing on it, and very stony.  Here I saw a large troop of ostriches and numberless gazelles stalking  away out of the line of the caravan's march. My men were all highly  anxious I should shoot them, but I would not, to try what effect it  would have on the Abban, saying, sport was of secondary importance to  me, and I now only wished to finish the journey quickly.    By his detentions I had lost so much time, I despaired of reaching  Berbera agreeably with my instructions, and, moreover, he had not  begged my pardon, from which I doubted his intention to serve me  faithfully. This caused a halt. Sumunter and all the men alike said,  \"Of what good is your coming here, if you do not enjoy yourself? We  all came on this journey to reap advantages from serving you, and now  if you don't shoot, what may we expect?\" I said, Prove to me that I  shall not be thwarted again, and I will shoot or do anything to create  good-will. Then appointing three men as Sumunter's advisers to hold  him in restraint in case any wrong-headedness on his part should get  the mastery of him, I begged they would proceed. This proved  successful for the time. Sumunter wrote me a letter, stating his  intention of abject servitude, and ratified it by presenting his spear  and shield, through the hands of the interpreter, for me to return to  him as an acknowledgment that I would henceforth forgive him; and we  again proceeded on the journey.    After travelling ten miles without seeing a single habitation or human  being of any sort, we arrived at a nullah, in which there were several  pools of bitter spring-water, and some Egyptian geese swimming on  them. This place was called Barham. On the right or northern side of  the line of our march was the hill-range, about ten miles distant, at  the foot of which, in the beds of small ravines, grew some belts of  the jujube-tree and hardy acacias; but to the south the land was all  sterile, and stretched away in a succession of little flat plains,  circumscribed by bosses or hillocks of pure white limestone rock,  which appeared standing unaffected by the weathering which had worn  down the plains that were lying between them. Again these little  enclosed plains sank in gentle gradation to their centres, where  nullahs, like the one I was encamped upon, drained the land and refuse  debris to the south and eastward, possibly to join eventually the Rhut  Tug.    12th.--At 9 A.M. we were again in motion on our westward course,  rising by a gentle incline to about half-way between Rhut Tug and a  second Wadi Nogal farther on, called Yubbé Tug. Here, at the  water-parting between these two large watercourses, was the tomb of  the great founder of these mighty nations, Darud bin Ismail, and an  excavated tumulus. There were also several bitter springs in the  neighbourhood, with stone enclosures and numerous flocks of sheep  tended by Somali. On passing the tomb I scarcely remarked it, so  insignificant did it appear, whilst the Somali paid no homage to it  whatever. But the tumulus excited more attention, and I was requested  to examine it. Six years ago, the interpreter said, a Somali who  wished to bury his wife in it, broke through its exterior, and found a  hollow compartment propped up by beams of timber, at the bottom of  which, buried in the ground, were several earthenware pots, some  leaden coins, a ring of gold such as the Indian Mussulman women wear  in their noses, and various other miscellaneous property.    I was very much struck with the sleekness of the sheep, considering  there appeared nothing for them to live upon; but I was shown amongst  the stony ground here and there a little green pulpy-looking weed, an  ice plant called Buskàlé, succulent, and by repute highly nutritious.  It was on this they fed and throve. These Dumba sheep--the fat-tailed  breed--appear to thrive on much less food, and can abstain longer from  eating, than any others. This is probably occasioned by the  nourishment they derive from the fat of their tails, which acts as a  reservoir, regularly supplying, as it necessarily would do, any sudden  or excessive drainage from any other part of their systems.    After crossing over this high land we began descending to the  westward, and at the completion of the twelfth mile dropped into a  nullah tributary to the Yubbé Tug, made a kraal for protection against  hyenas close to a pool of water, and spent the night. This plain was  called Libbahdilé (the haunt of lions).[17]    13th.--The air was so cold, the men could not bestir themselves until  after sunrise, when, to my great surprise and delight, without one  angry word or attempted impediment from the Abban, we were on the move  at 8 A.M. I now fondly hoped the Abban had really turned over a new  leaf, but was soon undeceived, and also disappointed. He was married  to a Dulbahanta woman, and this wife, for he had two others, with her  family, was residing in that country. I was therefore, unawares to  myself, travelling directly on his home. Hence these three consecutive  marches. Gradually we descended into a broad valley, down the centre  of which meandered the Yubbé Tug, or the second Wadi Nogal of my  acquaintance. This formed a natural boundary-line, separating the  Warsingali from the northern Dulbahanta frontiers. Where we first came  upon the nullah it was deep and broad, with such steep perpendicular  sides that camels could not cross it. We therefore turned suddenly  northward, and followed up its left bank till we turned its head,  which begins abruptly, and marched five miles to the Yubbé Kraals. Had  this valley been blessed with a moderate quantity of rain, there is no  doubt it would have been available for agricultural purposes; and as  it was, there were more trees growing in the hollow here than in any  other place I had seen, and several flocks and herds were congregated  in it. Whilst travelling to-day the interpreter narrated the  circumstances of a fight which the Warsingali had with the Dulbahantas  about ten years ago in this valley, in which it appeared the  Dulbahantas were the aggressing party, having sent a foraging-party  over their frontier to lift some cattle. The Warsingali, seeing this,  mustered their forces and repelled the enemy; but would not follow  them up, preferring rather to tease them into submission than to  engender a bloody contest. This they effected by exposing all their  flocks and herds to the view of the Dulbahantas on the bank of the  impassable nullah, whilst they guarded its head and protected their  flank by stationing a strong party of warriors there. The Dulbahantas,  tantalised at this tempting yet aggravating sight, for they had not  strength enough to cope with the Warsingali in full force, waited  covetously gazing across the nullah for some time, and then retired in  such great disgust, they have never attempted to steal again.    When once ensconced in the new camp, the Abban came to me with an air  of high importance, to announce that we were now on the Dulbahanta  frontier, and that, if I wished to see their land, I must allow him to  precede me, and pave the way, taking the young prince Abdullah with  him to magnify the purport of his mission, as the Dulbahantas were a  terrible and savage nation, governed, not like the Warsingalis, by an  old and revered chief, but by a young sultan whom nobody listened to.  Moreover, the Dulbahantas had sent word to say they had heard of my  marking the Warsingali country out with paper, and would not admit me  on any consideration. Besides which, it was a custom in the country  that strangers should ask permission to enter through the medium of an  abban, and as I had acted on that custom in the Warsingali country, so  also must I do it here.    I was kept at this station eight days, sometimes hearing ominous  announcements of the terrible Dulbahantas, sent to frighten me by the  Abban, and sometimes amusing myself in other and various ways. The  Dulbahantas could not conceive my motive for wishing to travel in  their land; no peddling Arab, even, had ever ventured there, so why  should I desire to go? Fortunately I had a good deal of employment  with my gun; for, besides gazelles, antelopes, a lynx, florikans, and  partridges, I shot many very beautiful little honey-birds, as well as  other small birds. Of these former the most beautiful was the  _Nectarinia Habessinica_. It has an exceedingly gaudy plumage, that  glistens in metallic lustre as the rays of light strike upon its  various-coloured feathers. This is the more remarkable on a warm  sunshiny day, when the tiny bird, like a busy humble-bee, bowing the  slender plant with its weight, inserts his sharp curved bill into the  flower-bells to drink their honey-dew,"]]]
