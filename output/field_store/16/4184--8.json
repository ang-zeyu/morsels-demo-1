I  bind my magazines at home evenings, with good results. Six issues  make a well proportioned book, which gives two bound volumes each  year.    The covers of the magazines are removed, the wire binders pulled  out with a pair of pliers and the advertising pages removed from  both sides, after which it will be found that the remainder is in  sections, each section containing four double leaves or sixteen  pages. These sections are each removed in turn from the others,  using a pocket knife to separate them if they stick, and each  section is placed as they were in the magazine upon each preceding  one until all six numbers have been prepared. If started with the  January or the July issue, the pages will be numbered  consecutively through the entire pages of the six issues.    The sections are then prepared for sewing. They are evened up on  the edges by jarring on a flat surface. They are then placed  between two pieces of board and all clamped in a vise. Five cuts,  1/8 in. deep, are made with a saw across the back of the sections,  as shown in Fig. 1. Heavy plain paper is used for the flyleaves.  The paper is cut double the same as the leaves comprising the  sections, making either one or two double sections for each side  as desired.    A frame for sewing will have to be made as shown in Fig. 2 before  the work can be continued on the book. The frame is easily made of  four pieces of wood. The bottom piece A should be a little larger  than the book. The two upright pieces B are nailed to the outside  edge, and a third piece, C, is nailed across the top. Small nails  are driven part way into the base C to correspond to the saw cuts  in the sections. A piece of soft fiber string is stretched from  each nail to the crosspiece C and tied.    Coarse white thread, size 16 or larger, is used for the sewing  material. Start with the front of the book. Be sure that all  sections are in their right places and that the flyleaves are  provided in the front and back. Take the sections of the flyleaves  on top, which should be notched the same as the saw cuts in the  book sections, and place them against the strings in the frame.  Place the left hand on the inside of the leaves where they are  folded and start a blunt needle, threaded double, through the  notch on the left side of the string No. 1 in Fig. 2. Take hold of  the needle with the right hand and pass it to the left around the  string No. 1, then back through the notch on the right side.  Fasten the thread by tying or making a knot in the end and passing  the needle through it. After drawing the thread tightly, pass the  needle through the notch on the left side of the string No. 2,  passing it around the string and tying in the same manner as for  No. 1. Each section is fastened to the five strings in the same  manner, the thread being carried across from each tie from No. 1  to 2 then to 3 and so on    [Illustration: Frame for Sewing Sections]    until all strings are tied. The string No. 5 is treated in the  same manner only that the needle is run through on the left side  of the string a second time, leaving the needle on the outside in  position for the next section, which is fastened the same as the  first, the needle being passed through the notch on the right side  of the string No. 5, and then to string No.4, passing around on  the right side and back on the left and so on. Keep the thread  drawn up tightly all the time.    After the sewing is completed cut the strings, allowing about 2  in. of the ends extending on each side. The fibers of these ends  are separated and combed out so that they can be glued to the  covers to serve as a hinge. A piece of cheesecloth is cut to the  size of the back and glued to it. Ordinary liquid glue is the best  adhesive to use.    Procure heavy cardboard for the covers and cut two pieces 1/2 in.  longer and just the same width as the magazine pages. The covering  can be of cloth, leather or paper according to the taste and  resources of the maker. The covering should be cut out 1 in.  larger on all edges than both covers and space on the back. Place  the cardboard covers on the book, allowing a margin of 1/4 in. on  all edges except the back, and measure the distance between the  back edges of the covers across the back of the book.    Place the cardboard covers on the back of the covering the proper  distance apart as measured for the back, and mark around each one.  Spread thin coat of glue on the surface of each and lay them on by  the marks made. Cut a notch out of the covering so it will fold  in, and, after gluing    [Illustration: The Bound Book]    a strip of paper to the covering between the covers to strengthen  the back, fold over the outside edges of the covering and glue it  down all around.    Place the cover on the book in the right position, glue the hinges  fast to the inside of the covers, then glue the first flyleaf to  the inside of the cover on both front and back and place the whole  under a weight until dry.  --Contributed by Clyde E.

The metal can  be fastened with nails or screws over the parts of the leather  attached to the wood. Tinplate, iron    [Illustration: Metal Parts Screwed on Leather Hinge]    hoops, zinc or thin brass cut in neat designs will make a leather  hinge appear as well as a metal hinge.  --Contributed by Tom Hutchinson, Encanto, Cal.        ** Removing Plaster from Skin [41]    A hot-water bottle held against a porous plaster will assist in  quickly removing it from the skin.        ** How to Make a Cheap Bracket Saw [42]    For the frame use 3/8-in. round iron, bending it as shown in the  diagram and filing a knob on each end, at opposite sides to each  other, on which to hook the blade. For the blade an old  talking-machine    [Illustration: Hacksaw Frame and Blade]    spring or a clock spring will do nicely. Heat the spring enough to  take some of the temper out of it, in order to drill the holes in  the ends, as shown, and file in the teeth. Make the blade 12 in.  long, with 10 teeth to the inch. A and B show how the blade fits  on the frame. -Contributed by Willard J.

Be sure to get hydraulic pipe, or double extra heavy, as it is  sometimes called, as common gas pipe is entirely too light for  this purpose. Don't have the pipe too long or the cannon will not  make as much    [Illustration: Toy Cannon]    noise. Seven or eight inches is about the right length for a 1-in.  bore. Screw the plug and pipe up tightly and then drill a 1/16-in.  fuse hole at D.

Drive a nail through this near the center for a pivot (C). To the  under side of one end nail a copper brush (D) to extend out about  an inch. On the upper side, at the same end, nail another brush  (E) so that it projects at both sides and is bent down to the  level of the end brush. Then on the board put    [Illustration: Reverse for Motor]    a semi-circle of brass-headed tacks as shown at F, leaving a small  space at the middle and placing five tacks on either side, so that  the end brush will come in contact with each one. Connect these  tacks on the under side of the board with coils of German-silver  wire, using about 8 in. of wire to each coil. Fix these by  soldering or bending over the ends of the tacks. Then nail two  strips of copper (G) in such position that the side brush will  remain on the one as long as the end brush remains on the tacks on  that side.    Put sides about 1-1/2 in. high around this apparatus, raising the  board a little from the bottom to allow room for the coil. A lid  may be added if desired. Connect up as shown.  --Contributed by Chas. H.

The size of the jars depends on the voltage. If you are going to  use a current of low tension, as from batteries, the jars need not  be very large, but if you intend to use the electric light current  of 110 voltage it will be necessary to use large jars or wooden  boxes made watertight, which will hold about 6 or 7 gal. Each jar  to be filled with 20 parts water to 1 part sulphuric acid. Jars  are set in a row in some convenient place out of the way.    Next cut out eight copper or brass disks, two for each jar. Their  size also depends on the voltage. The disks that are placed in the  lower part of the jars are connected with a rubber covered wire  extending a little above the top of the jar.    To wire the apparatus, refer to the sketch and you will see that  jar No. 1 is connected to point No. 1 on switch; No. 2, on No. 2,  and so on until all is complete and we have one remaining point on  switch. Above the jars place a wire to suspend the other or top  disks in the solution. This wire is also connected to one terminal  on the motor and to remaining point on switch.

The historian, Haliburton, describes the melancholy scene  that met the eyes of the new settlers when they reached, in 1760, the  old homes of the Acadians at Mines. They came across a few straggling  families of Acadians who \"had eaten no bread for years, and had  subsisted on vegetables, fish, and the more hardy part of the cattle  that had survived the severity of the first winter of their  abandonment.\" They saw everywhere \"ruins of the houses that had been  burned by the Provincials, small gardens encircled by cherry-trees and  currant-bushes, and clumps of apple-trees.\" In all parts of the country,  where the new colonists established themselves, the Indians were  unfriendly for years, and it was necessary to erect stockaded houses for  the protection of the settlements.    No better class probably could have been selected to settle Nova Scotia  than these American immigrants. The majority were descendants of the  Puritans who settled in New England, and some were actually sprung from  men and women who had landed from \"The Mayflower\" in 1620. Governor  Lawrence recognized the necessity of having a sturdy class of settlers,  accustomed to the climatic conditions and to agricultural labour in  America, and it was through his strenuous efforts that these immigrants  were brought into the province. They had, indeed, the choice of the best  land of the province, and everything was made as pleasant as possible  for them by a paternal government, only anxious to establish British  authority on a sound basis of industrial development.    In 1767, according to an official return in the archives of Nova Scotia,  the total population of what are now the provinces of Nova Scotia, New  Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island, reached 13,374 souls; of whom 6913  are given as Americans, 912 as English, 2165 as Irish, 1946 as Germans,  and 1265 as Acadian French, the latter being probably a low estimate.  Some of these Irish emigrated directly from the north of Ireland, and  were Presbyterians. They were brought out by one Alexander McNutt, who  did much for the work of early colonization; others came from New  Hampshire, where they had been settled for some years. The name of  Londonderry in New Hampshire is a memorial of this important class, just  as the same name recalls them in the present county of Colchester, in  Nova Scotia.    The Scottish immigration, which has exercised such an important  influence on the eastern counties of Nova Scotia--and I include Cape  Breton--commenced in 1772, when about thirty families arrived from  Scotland and settled in the present county of Pictou, where a very few  American colonists from Philadelphia had preceded them. In later years a  steady tide of Scotch population flowed into eastern Nova Scotia and did  not cease until 1820. Gaelic is still the dominant tongue in the eastern  counties, where we find numerous names recalling the glens, lochs, and  mountains of old Scotland. Sir William Alexander's dream of a new  Scotland has been realised in a measure in the province where his  ambition would have made him \"lord paramount.\"    Until the foundation of Halifax the government of Nova Scotia was vested  solely in a governor who had command of the garrison stationed at  Annapolis. In 1719 a commission was issued to Governor Phillips, who was  authorised to appoint a council of not less than twelve persons. This  council had advisory and judicial functions, but its legislative  authority was of a very limited scope. This provisional system of  government lasted until 1749, when Halifax became the seat of the new  administration of public affairs. The governor had a right to appoint a  council of twelve persons--as we have already seen, he did so  immediately--and to summon a general assembly \"according to the usage of  the rest of our colonies and plantations in America.\" He was, \"with the  advice and consent\" of the council and assembly, \"to make, constitute  and ordain laws\" for the good government of the province. During nine  years the governor-in-council carried on the government without an  assembly, and passed a number of ordinances, some of which imposed  duties on trade for the purpose of raising revenue. The legality of  their acts was questioned by Chief Justice Belcher, and he was sustained  by the opinion of the English law officers, who called attention to the  governor's commission, which limited the council's powers. The result of  this decision was the establishment of a representative assembly, which  met for the first time at Halifax on the 2nd October, 1758.    Governor Lawrence, whose name will be always unhappily associated with  the merciless expatriation of the French Acadians, had the honour of  opening the first legislative assembly of Nova Scotia in 1758. One  Robert Sanderson, of whom we know nothing else, was chosen as the first  speaker, but he held his office for only one session, and was succeeded  by William Nesbitt, who presided over the house for many years. The  first sittings of the legislature were held in the court house, and  subsequently in the old grammar school at the corner of Barrington and  Sackville Streets, for very many years one of the historic memorials of  the Halifax of the eighteenth century.    At this time the present province of New Brunswick was for the most part  comprised in a county known as Sunbury, with one representative in the  assembly of Nova Scotia. The island of Cape Breton also formed a part of  the province, and had the right to send two members to the assembly, but  the only election held for that purpose was declared void on account of  there not being any freeholders entitled by law to vote. The island of  St. John, named Prince Edward in 1798, in honour of the Duke of Kent,  who was commander-in-chief of the British forces for some years in North  America, was also annexed to Nova Scotia in 1763, but it never sent  representatives to its legislature. In the following year a survey was  commenced of all the imperial dominions on the Atlantic. Various schemes  for the cultivation and settlement of the island were proposed as soon  as the surveys were in progress. The most notable suggestion was made by  the Earl of Egmont, first lord of the admiralty; he proposed the  division of the island into baronies, each with a castle or stronghold  under a feudal lord, subject to himself as lord paramount, under the  customs of the feudal system of Europe. The imperial authorities  rejected this scheme, but at the same time they adopted one which was as  unwise as that of the noble earl. The whole island, with the exception  of certain small reservations and royalties, was given away by lottery  in a single day to officers of the army and navy who had served in the  preceding war, and to other persons who were ambitious to be great  landowners, on the easy condition of paying certain quit-rents--a  condition constantly broken. This ill-advised measure led to many  troublesome complications for a hundred years, until at last they were  removed by the terms of the arrangement which brought the island into  the federal union of British North America in 1873. In 1769 the island  was separated from Nova Scotia and granted a distinct government,  although its total population at the time did not exceed one hundred and  fifty families. An assembly of eighteen representatives was called so  early as 1773, when the first governor, Captain Walter Paterson, still  administered public affairs. The assembly was not allowed to meet with  regularity during many years of the early history of the island. During  one administration it was practically without parliamentary government  for ten years. The land question always dominated public affairs in the  island for a hundred years.    From the very beginning of a regular system of government in Nova Scotia  the legislature appears to have practically controlled the  administration of local affairs except so far as it gave, from time to  time, powers to the courts of quarter sessions to regulate taxation and  carry out certain small public works and improvements. In the first  session of the legislature a joint committee of the council and assembly  chose the town officers for Halifax. We have abundant evidence that at  this time the authorities viewed with disfavour any attempt to establish  a system of town government similar to that so long in operation in New  England. The town meeting was considered the nursery of sedition in New  England, and it is no wonder that the British authorities in Halifax  frowned upon all attempts to reproduce it in their province.    Soon after his arrival in Nova Scotia, Governor Cornwallis established  courts of law to try and determine civil and criminal cases in  accordance with the laws of England. In 1774 there were in the province  courts of general session, similar to the courts of the same name in  England; courts of common pleas, formed on the practice of New England  and the mother country, and a supreme court, court of assize and general  gaol delivery, composed of a chief justice and two assistant judges. The  governor-in-council constituted a court of error in certain cases, and  from its decisions an appeal could be made to the king-in-council.  Justices of peace were also appointed in the counties and townships,  with jurisdiction over the collection of small debts.    We must now leave the province of Nova Scotia and follow the  revolutionary movement, which commenced, soon after the signing of the  Treaty of Paris, in the old British colonies on the Atlantic seaboard,  and ended in the acknowledgement of their independence in 1783, and in  the forced migration of a large body of loyal people who found their way  to the British provinces.
