In this  manner you may do goose, duck, or beef, or hare's flesh.    _To make a Poloe_:--Take a pint of rice, boil it in as much water as  will cover it; when your rice is half boiled, put in your fowl, with a  small onion, a blade or two of mace, some whole pepper, and some salt;  when 'tis enough, put the fowl in the dish, and pour the rice over it.    _To make a Pulpatoon of Pigeons_:--Take mushrooms, palates, oysters,  sweet-breads, and fry them in butter; then put all these into a strong  gravy; give them a heat over the fire, and thicken up with an egg and  a bit of butter; then half roast six or eight pigeons, and lay them  in a crust of forc'd-meat as follows: scrape a pound of veal, and two  pounds of marrow, and beat it together in a stone mortar, after 'tis  shred very fine; then season it with salt, pepper, spice, and put in  hard eggs, anchovies and oysters; beat all together, and make the  lid and sides of your pye of it; first lay a thin crust into your  pattipan, then put on your forc'd-meat; then lay an exceeding thin  crust over them; then put in your pigeons and other ingredients, with  a little butter on the top. Bake it two hours.    _To keep Green Peas till Christmas_:--Shell what quantity you please  of young peas; put them in the pot when the water boils; let them have  four or five warms; then first pour them into a colander, and then  spread a cloth on a table, and put them on that, and dry them well  in it: have bottles ready dry'd, and fill them to the necks, and pour  over them melted mutton-fat, and cork them down very close, that no  air come to them: set them in your cellar, and when you use them, put  them into boiling water, with a spoonful of fine sugar, and a good  piece of butter: and when they are enough, drain and butter them.      II.--MEAT PIES AND PUDDINGS.    _A Battalia Pye_:--Take four small chickens, four squab pigeons, four  sucking rabbets; cut them in pieces, season them with savoury spice,  and lay 'em in the pye, with four sweet-breads sliced, and as many  sheep's-tongues, two shiver'd palates, two pair of lamb-stones, twenty  or thirty coxcombs, with savoury-balls and oysters. Lay on butter, and  close the pye. A lear.    _To make an Olio Pye_:--Make your pye ready; then take the thin  collops of the but-end of a leg of veal; as many as you think will  fill your pye; hack them with the back of a knife, and season them  with pepper, salt, cloves, and mace; wash over your collops with  a bunch of feathers dipped in eggs, and have in readiness a good  hand-full of sweet-herbs shred small; the herbs must be thyme,  parsley, and spinage; and the yolks of eight hard eggs, minced, and a  few oysters parboiled and chopt; some beef-suet shred very fine.  Mix these together, and strew them over your collops, and sprinkle  a little orange-flower-water on them, and roll the collops up very  close, and lay them in your pye, strewing the seasoning that is left  over them; put butter on the top, and close up your pye; when 'tis  drawn, put in gravy, and one anchovy dissolved in it, and pour it in  very hot: and you may put in artichoke-bottoms and chesnuts, if you  please, or sliced lemon, or grapes scalded, or what else is in season;  but if you will make it a right savoury pye leave them out.    _To make a Lumber Pye_:--Take a pound and a half of veal, parboil it,  and when 'tis cold chop it very small, with two pound of beef-suet,  and some candied orange-peel; some sweet-herbs, as thyme,  sweet-marjoram, and an handful of spinage; mince the herbs small  before you put them to the other; so chop all together, and a pippin  or two; then add a handful or two of grated bread, a pound and a half  of currants, washed and dried; some cloves, mace, nutmeg, a little  salt, sugar and sack, and put to all these as many yolks of raw eggs,  and whites of two, as will make it a moist forc'd-meat; work it with  your hands into a body, and make it into balls as big as a turkey's  egg; then having your coffin made put in your balls. Take the marrow  out of three or four bones as whole as you can: let your marrow lie a  little in water, to take out the blood and splinters; then dry it, and  dip it in yolk of eggs; season it with a little salt, nutmeg grated,  and grated bread; lay it on and between your forc'd-meat balls, and  over that sliced citron, candied orange and lemon, eryngo-roots,  preserved barberries; then lay on sliced lemon, and thin slices of  butter over all; then lid your pye, and bake it; and when 'tis drawn,  have in readiness a caudle made of white-wine and sugar, and thicken'd  with butter and eggs, and pour it hot into your pye.    _Very fine Hogs Puddings_:--Shred four pounds of beef-suet very fine,  mix with it two pounds of fine sugar powder'd, two grated nutmegs,  some mace beat, and a little salt, and three pounds of currants wash'd  and pick'd; beat twenty-four yolks, twelve whites of eggs, with a  little sack; mix all well together, and fill your guts, being clean  and steep'd in orange-flower-water; cut your guts quarter and half  long, fill them half full; tye at each end, and again thus oooo. Boil  them as others, and cut them in balls when sent to the table.    _To make Plumb-Porridge_:--Take a leg and shin of beef to ten gallons  of water, boil it very tender, and when the broth is strong, strain it  out, wipe the pot, and put in the broth again; slice six penny-loaves  thin, cutting off the top and bottom; put some of the liquor to it,  cover it up, and let it stand a quarter of an hour, and then put it in  your pot, let it boil a quarter of an hour, then put in five pounds of  currants, let them boil a little, and put in five pounds of raisins,  and two pounds of prunes, and let them boil till they swell; then put  in three quarters of an ounce of mace, half an ounce of cloves, two  nutmegs, all of them beat fine, and mix it with a little liquor cold,  and put them in a very little while, and take off the pot, and put in  three pounds of sugar, a little salt, a quart of sack, and a quart of  claret, the juice of two or three lemons; you may thicken with sagoe  instead of bread, if you please; pour them into earthen pans, and keep  them for use.      III.--SWEET-PUDDINGS, PIES, ETC.    _To make New-College Puddings_:--Grate a penny stale loaf, and put to  it a like quantity of beef-suet finely shred, and a nutmeg grated, a  little salt, some currants, and then beat some eggs in a little sack,  and some sugar, and mix all together, and knead it as stiff as for  manchet, and make it up in the form and size of a turkey-egg, but a  little flatter; then take a pound of butter, and put it in a dish, and  set the dish over a clear fire in a chafing-dish, and rub your butter  about the dish till 'tis melted; put your puddings in, and cover the  dish, but often turn your puddings, until they are all brown alike,  and when they are enough, scrape sugar over them, and serve them up  hot for a side dish.    You must let the paste lie a quarter of an hour before you make up  your puddings.    _To make a Spread-Eagle pudding_:--Cut off the crust of three  half-penny rolls, then slice them into your pan; then set three pints  of milk over the fire, make it scalding hot, but not boil; so pour it  over your bread, and cover it close, and let it stand an hour; then  put in a good spoonful of sugar, a very little salt, a nutmeg grated,  a pound of suet after 'tis shred, half a pound of currants washed and  picked, four spoonfuls of cold milk, ten eggs, but five of the whites;  and when all is in, stir it, but not till all is in; then mix it well,  butter a dish; less than an hour will bake it.    _To make a Cabbage Pudding_:--Take two pounds of the lean part of a  leg of veal; take of beef-suet the like quantity; chop them together,  then beat them together in a stone mortar, adding to it half a little  cabbage, scalded, and beat that with your meat; then season it with  mace and nutmeg, a little pepper and salt, some green gooseberries,  grapes, or barberries in the time of year.

It was evident that he was quite unconscious of the trap for his  fore feet had actually been placed upon one of the jaws only two inches  from the pan which would have sprung it.    One afternoon we responded to a call from Bui-tao, a village seven miles  beyond Lung-tao, where the blue tiger had been seen that day. The natives  assured us that the animal continually crossed a hill, thickly clothed with  pines and sword grass just above the village and even though it was late  when we arrived Harry thought it wise to set the trap that night.    It was pitch dark before we reached the ridge carrying the trap, two  lanterns, an electric flash-lamp and a wretched little dog for bait. We had  been engaged for about fifteen minutes making a pen for the dog, and  Caldwell and I were on our knees over the trap when suddenly a low rumbling  growl came from the grass not twenty feet away. We jumped to our feet just  as it sounded again, this time ending in a snarl. The tiger had arrived a  few moments too early and we were in the rather uncomfortable position of  having to return to the village by way of a narrow trail through the  jungle. With our rifles ready and the electric lamp cutting a brilliant  path in the darkness we walked slowly toward the edge of the sword grass  hoping to see the flash of the tiger's eyes, but the beast backed off  beyond the range of the light into an impenetrable tangle where we could  not follow. Apparently he was frightened by the lantern, for we did not  hear him again.    After nearly a month of disappointments such as these Mr. Heller joined us  at Bui-tao with Mr. Kellogg. Caldwell thought it advisable to shift camp to  the Ling-suik monastery, about twelve miles away, where he had once spent a  summer with his family and had killed several tigers. This was within the  blue tiger's range and, moreover, had the advantage of offering a better  general collecting ground than Bui-tao; thus with Heller to look after the  small mammals we could begin to make our time count for something if we did  not get the tiger.    Ling-suik is a beautiful temple, or rather series of temples, built into a  hillside at the end of a long narrow valley which swells out like a great  bowl between bamboo clothed mountains, two thousand feet in height. On his  former visit Mr. Caldwell had made friends with the head priest and we were  allowed to establish ourselves upon the broad porch of the third and  highest building. It was an ideal place for a collecting camp and would  have been delightful except for the terrible heat which was rendered doubly  disagreeable by the almost continual rain.    The priests who shuffled about the temples were a hard lot. Most of them  were fugitives from justice and certainly looked the part, for a more  disreputable, diseased and generally undesirable body of men I have never  seen.    Our stay at Ling-suik was productive and the temple life interesting. We  slept on the porch and each morning, about half an hour before daylight,  the measured strokes of a great gong sounded from the temple just below us.  _Boom--boom--boom--boom_ it went, then rapidly _bang, bang, bang_. It was a  religious alarm clock to rouse the world.    A little later when the upturned gables and twisted dolphins on the roof  had begun to take definite shape in the gray light of the new day, the gong  boomed out again, doors creaked, and from their cell-like rooms shuffled  the priests to yawn and stretch themselves before the early service. The  droning chorus of hoarse voices, swelling in a meaningless half-wild chant,  harmonized strangely with the romantic surroundings of the temple and  become our daily _matin_ and evensong.    At the first gong we slipped from beneath our mosquito nets and dressed to  be ready for the bats which fluttered into the building to hide themselves  beneath the tiles and rafters. When daylight had fully come we scattered to  the four winds of heaven to inspect traps, hunt barking deer, or collect  birds, but gathered again at nine o'clock for breakfast and to deposit our  spoil. Caldwell and I always spent the afternoon at the blue tiger's lair  but the animal had suddenly shifted his operations back to Lung-tao and did  not appear at Ling-suik while we were there.    Our work in Fukien taught us much that may be of help to other naturalists  who contemplate a visit to this province. We satisfied ourselves that  summer collecting is impracticable, for the heat is so intense and the  vegetation so heavy that only meager results can be obtained for the  efforts expended. Continual tramping over the mountains in the blazing sun  necessarily must have its effect upon the strongest constitution, and even  a man like Mr. Caldwell, who has become thoroughly acclimated, is not  immune.    Both Caldwell and I lost from fifteen to twenty pounds in weight during the  time we hunted the blue tiger and each of us had serious trouble from  abscesses. I have never worked in a more trying climate--even that of  Borneo and the Dutch East Indies where I collected in 1909-10, was much  less debilitating than Fukien in the summer. The average temperature was  about 95 degrees in the shade, but the humidity was so high that one felt  as though one were wrapped in a wet blanket and even during a six weeks'  rainless period the air was saturated with moisture from the sea-winds.    In winter the weather is raw and damp, but collecting then would be vastly  easier than in summer, not only on account of climatic conditions, but  because much of the vegetation disappears and there is an opportunity for  \"still hunting.\"    Trapping for small mammal is especially difficult because of the dense  population. The mud dykes and the rice fields usually are covered with  tracks of civets, mongooses, and cats which come to hunt frogs or fish, but  if a trap is set it either catches a Chinaman or promptly is stolen.  Moreover, the small mammals are neither abundant nor varied in number of  species, and the larger forms, such as tiger, leopard, wild pig and serow  are exceedingly difficult to kill.    While our work in the province was done during an unfavorable season and in  only two localities, yet enough was seen of the general conditions to make  it certain that a thorough zoölogical study of the region would require  considerable time and hard work and that the results, so far as a large  collection of mammals is concerned, would not be highly satisfactory. Work  in the western part of the province among the Bohea Hills undoubtedly would  be more profitable, but even there it would be hardly worth while for an  expedition with limited time and money.    Bird life is on a much better footing, but the ornithology of Fukien  already has received considerable attention through the collections of  Swinhoe, La Touche, Styan, Ricketts, Caldwell and others, and probably not  a great number of species remain to be described.    Much work could still be done upon the herpetology of the region, however,  and I believe that this branch of zoölogy would be well worth investigation  for reptiles and batrachians are fairly abundant and the natives would  rather assist than retard one's efforts.    The language of Fukien is a greater annoyance than in any other of the  Chinese coast provinces. The Foochow dialect (which is one of the most  difficult to learn) is spoken only within fifty or one hundred miles of the  city. At Yen-ping Mr. Caldwell, who speaks \"Foochow\" perfectly, could not  understand a word of the \"southern mandarin\" which is the language of that  region, and near Futsing, where a colony of natives from Amoy have settled,  the dialect is unintelligible to one who knows only \"Foochow.\"    Travel in Fukien is an unceasing trial, for transport is entirely by  coolies who carry from eighty to one hundred pounds. The men are paid by  distance or weight; therefore, when coolies finally have been obtained  there is the inevitable wrangling over loads so that from one to two hours  are consumed before the party can start.    But the worst of it is that one can never be certain when one's entire  outfit will arrive at its new destination. Some men walk much faster than  others, some will delay a long time for tea, or may give out altogether if  the day be hot, with the result that the last load will arrive perhaps five  or six hours after the first one.    As horses are not to be had, if one does not walk the only alternative is  to be carried in a mountain chair, which is an uncomfortable, trapeze-like  affair and only to be found along the main highways. On the whole,  transport by man-power in China is so uncertain and expensive that for a  large expedition it forms a grave obstacle to successful work, if time and  funds be limited.    On the other hand, servants are cheap and usually good. We employed a very  fair cook who received monthly seven dollars Mexican (then about three and  one-half dollars gold), and \"boys\" were hired at from five to seven dollars  (Mexican). As none of the servants knew English they could be obtained at  much lower wages, but English-speaking cooks usually receive from fifteen  to twenty dollars (Mexican) a month.    It was hard to leave Fukien without the blue tiger but we had hunted him  unsuccessfully for five weeks and there was other and more important work  awaiting us in Yün-nan. It required thirty porters to transport our baggage  from the Ling-suik monastery to Daing-nei, twenty-one miles away, where two  houseboats were to meet us, and by ten o'clock in the evening we were lying  off Pagoda Anchorage awaiting the flood tide to take us to Foochow. We made  our beds on the deck house and in the morning opened our eyes to find the  boat tied to the wharf at the Custom House on the Bund, and ourselves in  full view of all Foochow had it been awake at that hour.
