He lacks the taste  for books, and such teachers as he knew had not the wit to cultivate a  taste for good reading. Such books as he gets only add to his unhealthy  thoughts.    Many writers have classified the crimes that the boy commits. It is  scarcely worth the while. He learns to steal or becomes a burglar  largely for the love of adventure; he robs because it is exciting and  may bring large returns. In his excursions to pilfer property he may  kill, and then for the first time the State discovers that there is  such a boy and sets in action the machinery to take his life. The city  quite probably has given him a casual notice by arresting him a number  of times and sending him to a juvenile prison, but it has rarely  extended a hand to help him. Any man or woman who has fairly normal  faculties, and can reason from cause to effect, knows that the crimes of  children are really the crimes of the State and society which by neglect  and active participation have made him what he is. When it is remembered  that the man is the child grown up, it is equally easy to understand the  adult prisoner.          X    HOMICIDE      Crimes against persons are not always as easy to classify and understand  as crimes against property. These acts are so numerous and come from so  many different emotions and motives, that often the cause is obscure and  the explanation not easy to find. Still here, as everywhere in Nature,  nothing can happen without a cause, and even where limited knowledge  does its best and cannot find causes, our recognition of the connection  between cause and effect and the all-inclusiveness of law can leave no  doubt that complete knowledge would bring complete understanding.    It is always to be borne in mind in considering this class of crimes  that the motive power of life is not reason but instinct. If men lived  by reason the race would not survive. The primal things that preserve  the race, the hunger for food, drink, sex, are instinctive and not only  are not awakened or satisfied by reason, but oftentimes in violation of  it. Nature, first of all, sees to the preservation of the species, and  acts in a broad way that life may not perish. Nature knows nothing about  right and wrong in the sense in which man uses these words. All of our  moral conceptions are purely of social origin and hence not instinctive  in human life, and are forever giving way to the instincts on which  Nature depends. The preservation of life has called for the emotions of  hate, fear and love, among the other emotions that move men. The animal  fears danger and runs away, and thus life is preserved. The weaker  animal is almost entirely dependent for life upon his fear. He is  sometimes afraid when there is no danger, but without fear he would be  destroyed. Sometimes the animal hates and kills and thus preserves  himself. The love of offspring is the cause of the care bestowed upon it  which preserves its life. The herd instinct in animal species develops  packs and clans and tribes and states. Man is the heir to all the past,  and the instincts and emotions of the primitive animal are strong in his  being. These may have been strengthened or diluted as the ages have come  and gone, but the same instincts furnish the motive power for all his  acts. Man fears and hates, and runs or kills and saves his life. He  loves, and preserves his offspring.    Man sees an object. Instinctively he may fear it or he may hate it. He  may run from it or destroy it. He gathers impressions through his  senses. The nerves carry them to the brain. He comes to fear certain  persons and things, to hate certain other persons or things, and to  love still others. If the hatred is strong enough or the danger great  enough or the desire sufficient, he may kill. Whether he plans the  method or deliberates upon the act can make no difference. He is  prompted by the instinct, and the reflection simply means the  consideration of reasons for and against, or the reaching of  inhibitions. If he acts, it is one of the primal emotions that causes  the act. He is the \"machine\" through which certain emotions find their  path and do their work. Infinite are the causes and circumstances that  give rise to an emotion strong enough to take human life.    Killings which result from a sudden passion are easily understood.  Everyone has been overwhelmed by rage, where reason and judgment and all  acquired restraints are entirely submerged. The primitive man with his  primitive emotion reasserts himself. It is mainly accident or the lack  of some particular circumstance that prevents a murder. Of course some  people are overwhelmed more easily than others. Some natures are less  stable, some nervous systems less perfect, and the built up barriers are  weaker. The whole result of stimuli is determined by the strength of the  feeling acting upon the machine. Such a person is not ordinarily  dangerous to the community. The act itself would generally assure that  it could never happen again. Some killings, however, are more  deliberate. They are preceded by a settled hatred which preys upon the  mind and fights against the preventive influences that training and  habit have formed. Under a certain combination of circumstances these  restrictions are swept aside and the emotions have their way.    There are, of course, certain broad classifications of homicides. A  considerable number, perhaps more than any other, come through the  commission of robbery, burglary and larceny. In the midst of the act the  offender is caught, and kills in an effort to escape. These murders fall  under the heading of property crimes; the cause is the same, and the  rules governing them are the same. The second group, with respect to  numbers, grows from the relations of men and women. Wives kill husbands  and husbands kill wives; sweethearts kill each other. Jealousy and  revenge are commonly mixed with sex life and sex association. Many  socialists have argued that under an equal distribution of property,  where women were freed from fear of want, these crimes would disappear.  But this argument does not take human nature into account. Jealousy is  inevitably associated with sex relations. The close contact of men and  women over long periods of time inevitably causes friction and  misunderstanding. These conditions often grow chronic, and in marriage  are aggravated by the necessity of close association regardless of the  real feelings that may exist. Certain claims are made by husbands and  by wives, which are probably inherent in the relationship; sometimes  they flow from habit and custom, but, from whatever cause, such claims  are so exacting that either the husband or wife finds them hard to meet.    Because of the fact that the feelings of men and women for each other  are deeper and more fundamental than those of any other relation, they  are more subject to misfortune and tragedy. The hatreds born from the  deepest affection are most beyond control. Then the desire of possession  is overwhelming. It would be strange if more killings did not result  from the relations of men and women than from any other cause. It is  easy to understand why this is true. It is likewise easy to understand  how laws, reason and judgment are powerless to prevent. Juries seem to  understand this when women kill husbands and lovers, but a  long-established code of chivalry and a cultivated attitude toward  women, which is partly right and partly wrong, make it impossible to see  that men are just as helpless under strong feelings as women. No doubt a  public opinion that would favor divorces on a greater number of grounds  and make them easily obtainable would prevent large numbers of such  killings, but the cause can not be altogether removed.    The law has long singled out killing as the greatest crime, doubtless  because man prizes life first of all. Of course every effort should be  made to protect life. Still, in measuring the character of the offender,  in determining his possibilities as a useful citizen, homicide is  probably one of the lesser crimes. Many times it implies no moral  turpitude, even with those who believe in moral turpitude. It may imply  very little lack of physical stability. Homicide practically never  becomes an occupation. Most killings are accidental in the sense that  they are casual and dependent on circumstances, and there is as a rule  much less danger of repetition than there is of the original commission  of a homicide by one of a defective nervous system who has never before  committed an unlawful act. A large number of men convicted of murder are  used as \"trusties\" in our penal institutions, even when their  imprisonment is for a long term, or for life. This shows from the  experience of prison officials that this class of offenders is, as a  rule, of a better fibre than almost any other class.    Doubtless no sort of treatment will ever entirely get rid of homicide.  Brains and nervous systems are so made, that inhibitions are unable to  protect in all cases. Nations and men readily engage in killing, either  from sport or because of a real or fancied wrong. Mob psychology shows  how whole communities are turned into ravenous beasts, hunting for  their prey. The world war, and all wars, show cases of mob psychology  that have led large masses of men to take an active part in killing. The  pursuit of those charged with crime shows that all people like the chase  when the emotions are thoroughly aroused. Under certain impulses,  communities gloat over hangings and commend judges and juries because  they have the courage to hang, when, in fact, they were too cowardly not  to hang and when their reason did not approve the verdict and judgment.  Men who do not kill often wish others might die and are pleased and  happy when they do die. We approve of death when it is the right one who  dies.

By protecting one's  wife one's offspring are protected, and by protecting one's offspring,  one's own self is protected. And it is because one begets one's own self  in one's wife that the wife is called _Jaya_[15] by the wise. The  husband also should be protected by the wife, thinking,--_How else will  he take his birth in my womb_?--I have heard it from Brahmanas  expounding the duties of the several orders that a Kshatriya hath no  other duty than subduing enemies. Alas, Kichaka kicked me in the very  presence of Yudhishthira the Just, and also of thyself, O Bhimasena of  mighty strength. It was thou, O Bhima, that didst deliver me from the  terrible Jatasura. It was thou also that with thy brothers didst  vanquish Jayadratha. Do thou now slay this wretch also who hath insulted  me. Presuming upon his being a favourite of the king, Kichaka, O  Bharata, hath enhanced my woe. Do thou, therefore, smash this lustful  wight even like an earthen pot dashed upon a stone. If, O Bharata,  tomorrow's sun sheds his rays upon him who is the source of many griefs  of mine, I shall, surely, mixing poison (with some drink), drink it  up,--for I never shall yield to Kichaka. Far better it were, O Bhima,  that I should die before thee.'\"        [15] _Jayate asyas_--i.e., she from whom one is born.    Vaisampayana continued, \"Having said this, Krishna, hiding her face in  Bhima's breast began to weep. And Bhima, embracing her, consoled her to  the best of his power. And having abundantly consoled that  slender-waisted daughter of Drupada by means of words fraught with grave  reason and sense, he wiped with his hands her face flooded with tears.  And thinking of Kichaka and licking with his tongue the corners of his  mouth, Bhima, filled with wrath thus spake to that distressed lady.\"      SECTION XXII    \"Bhima said, 'I will, O timid one, do even as thou sayest. I will  presently slay Kichaka with all his friends. O Yajnaseni of sweet  smiles, tomorrow evening, renouncing sorrow and grief, manage to have a  meeting with Kichaka. The dancing-hall that the king of the Matsya hath  caused to be erected is used by the girls for dancing during the day.  They repair, however, to their homes at night. There in that hall, is an  excellent and well-placed wooden bed-stead. Even there I will make him  see the spirits of his deceased grandsires. But, O beautiful one, when  thou holdest converse with him, thou must manage it so that others may  not espy thee.'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Having thus conversed with others, and shed  tears in grief, they waited for the dawn of that night with painful  impatience. And when the night had passed away, Kichaka, rising in the  morning, went to the palace, and accosted Draupadi saying, 'Throwing  thee down in the court I kicked thee in the presence of the king.  Attacked by mighty self, thou couldst not obtain protection. This Virata  is in name only the king of the Matsyas. Commanding the forces of this  realm it is I, who am the real lord of the Matsyas. Do thou, O timid  one, accept me cheerfully. I shall become thy slave. And, O thou of  graceful hips, I will immediately give thee a hundred _nishkas_, and  engage a hundred male and a hundred female servants (to tend thee), and  will also bestow on thee cars yoked with she-mules. O timid lady, let  our union take place.' Draupadi replied, 'O Kichaka, know even this is  my condition. Neither thy friends nor thy brothers should know thy union  with me. I am a terror of detection by those illustrious Gandharvas.  Promise me this, and I yield to thee.' Hearing this Kichaka said, 'I  will, O thou of graceful hips, do even as thou sayest. Afflicted by the  god of love, I will, O beauteous damsel, alone repair to thy abode for  union with thee, O thou of thighs round and tapering like the trunks of  the plantain,--so that those Gandharvas, effulgent as the sun, may not  come to know of this act of thine.' Draupadi said, 'Do thou, when it is  dark, go to the dancing-hall erected by the king of the Matsyas where  the girls dance during the day, repairing to their respective homes at  night. The Gandharvas do not know that place. We shall then without  doubt, escape all censure.'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Reflecting on the subject of her conversation  with Kichaka, that half a day seemed to Krishna as long as a whole  month. And the stupid Kichaka also, not knowing that it was Death that  had assumed the form of a _Sairindhri_, returning home experienced the  greatest delight. And deprived of sense by lust, Kichaka became speedily  engaged in embellishing his person with unguents and garlands and  ornaments. And while he was doing all this, thinking of that damsel of  large eyes, the day seemed to him to be without an end. And the beauty  of Kichaka, who was about to forsake his beauty for ever, seemed to  heighten, like the wick of a burning lamp about to expire. And reposing  the fullest confidence in Draupadi, Kichaka, deprived of his senses by  lust and absorbed in the contemplation of expected meeting, did not even  perceive that the day had departed. Meanwhile, the beautiful Draupadi  approaching her husband Bhima of the Kuru race, stood before him in the  kitchen. And that lady with tresses ending in beautiful curls then spake  unto him, saying, 'O chastiser of foes, even as thou hadst directed, I  have given Kichaka to understand that our meeting will take place in the  dancing-hall. Alone will he come at night to the empty hall. Slay him  there, O thou of mighty arms. Do thou, O son of Kunti, repair to that  dancing-hall, and take the life, O Pandava, of Kichaka, that son of a  _Suta_ intoxicated with vanity. From vanity alone, that son of a _Suta_  slights the Gandharvas. O best of smiters, lift him up from the earth  even as Krishna had lifted up the _Naga_ (Kaliya) from the Yamuna. O  Pandava, afflicted as I am with grief, wipe thou my tears, and blessed  be thou, protect thy own honour and that of thy race.'    \"Bhima said, 'Welcome, O beauteous lady. Except the glad tidings thou  bringest me, I need, O thou of exceeding beauty, no other aid whatever.  The delight that I feel, O thou of great beauty, on hearing from thee  about my coming encounter with Kichaka, is equal to what I felt in  slaying Hidimva. I swear unto thee by Truth, by my brothers, and by  morality, that I will slay Kichaka even as the lord of the celestials  slew Vritra. Whether secretly or openly, I will crush Kichaka, and if  the Matsyas fight for him, then I will slay them too. And slaying  Duryodhana afterwards, I shall win back the earth. Let Yudhishthira, the  son of Kunti, continue to pay homage unto the king of Matsya.' Hearing  these words of Bhima, Draupadi said, 'In order that, O lord, thou mayst  not have to renounce the truth already pledged to me, do thou, O hero,  slay Kichaka in secret.' Bhima assuring her said, 'Even today I shall  slay Kichaka together with his friends unknown to others during the  darkness of the night. I shall, O faultless lady, crush, even as an  elephant crusheth a _vela_ fruit,[16] the head of the wicked Kichaka who  wisheth for what is unattainable by him!'\"        [16] Some texts read, _Vilwam nagaviodhara--i.e.,_ 'As an      elephant lifts up a vela fruit.'    Vaisampayana continued, \"Repairing first to the place of assignation at  night, Bhima sat down, disguising himself. And he waited there in  expectation of Kichaka, like a lion lying in wait for a deer. And  Kichaka, having embellished his person as he chose, came to the  dancing-hall at the appointed time in the hope of meeting Panchali. And  thinking of the assignation, he entered the chamber. And having entered  that hall enveloped in deep gloom, that wretch of wicked soul came upon  Bhima of incomparable prowess, who had come a little before and who was  waiting in a corner. And as an insect approacheth towards a flaming  fire, or a puny animal towards a lion, Kichaka approached Bhima, lying  down in a bed and burning in anger at the thought of the insult offered  to Krishna, as if he were the Suta's Death. And having approached Bhima,  Kichaka possessed by lust, and his heart and soul filled with ecstacy  smilingly said, 'O thou of pencilled eye-brows, to thee I have already  given many and various kinds of wealth from the stores earned by me, as  well as hundred maids and many fine robes, and also a mansion with an  inner apartment adorned with beauteous and lovely and youthful maid  servants and embellished by every kind of sports and amusements. And  having set all those apart for thee, I have speedily come hither. And  all on a sudden, women have begun to praise me, saying, _There is not in  this world any other person like unto thee in beauty and dress_!'  Hearing this, Bhima said, 'It is well that thou art handsome, and it is  well thou praisest thyself. I think, however, that thou hadst never  before this such pleasurable touch! Thou hast an acute touch, and  knowest the ways of gallantry. Skilled in the art of love-making, thou  art a favourite with women. There is none like thee in this world!'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Saying this, that son of Kunti, the  mighty-armed Bhima of terrible prowess, suddenly rose up, and laughingly  said, 'Thy sister, O wretch, shall today behold thee dragged by me to  the ground, like a mighty elephant, huge as a mountain, dragged to the  ground by a lion. Thyself slain _Sairindhri_ will live in peace, and we,  her husbands, will also live in peace.' Saying this, the mighty Bhima  seized Kichaka by the hairs of his head, which were adorned with  garlands. And thus seized with force by the hair, that foremost of  mighty persons, Kichaka, quickly freed his hair and grasped the arms of  Bhima. And then between those lions among men, fired with wrath, between  that chief of the Kichaka clan, and that best of men, there ensued a  hand-to-hand encounter, like that between two powerful elephants for"]]]
