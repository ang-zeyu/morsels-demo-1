Such had  been the case with Sarah, and she dropped her eyes on the carpet with a  smile, that, aided by the blush which suffused her cheek, in no degree  detracted from her native charms.    Captain Wharton, without heeding this display of interest in his sister,  immediately continued, \"At times he is melancholy--we tell him it must  be love.\" Sarah raised her eyes to the face of her brother, and was  consciously turning them on the rest of the party, when she met those of  her sister laughing with good humor and high spirits, as she cried,  \"Poor man! does he despair?\"    \"Why, no--one would think he could not; the eldest son of a man of  wealth, so handsome, and a colonel.\"    \"Strong reasons, indeed, why he should prevail,\" said Sarah, endeavoring  to laugh; \"more particularly the latter.\"    \"Let me tell you,\" replied the captain, gravely, \"a lieutenant  colonelcy in the Guards is a very pretty thing.\"    \"And Colonel Wellmere a very pretty man,\" added Frances.    \"Nay, Frances,\" returned her sister, \"Colonel Wellmere was never a  favorite of yours; he is too loyal to his king to be agreeable to  your taste.\"    Frances quickly answered, \"And is not Henry loyal to his king?\"    \"Come, come,\" said Miss Peyton, \"no difference of opinion about the  colonel--he is a favorite of mine.\"    \"Fanny likes majors better,\" cried the brother, pulling her upon his  knee.    \"Nonsense!\" said the blushing girl, as she endeavored to extricate  herself from the grasp of her laughing brother.    \"It surprises me,\" continued the captain, \"that Peyton, when he procured  the release of my father, did not endeavor to detain my sister in the  rebel camp.\"    \"That might have endangered his own liberty,\" said the smiling girl,  resuming her seat. \"You know it is liberty for which Major Dunwoodie is  fighting.\"    \"Liberty!\" exclaimed Sarah; \"very pretty liberty which exchanges one  master for fifty.\"    \"The privilege of changing masters at all is a liberty.\"    \"And one you ladies would sometimes be glad to exercise,\" cried the  captain.    \"We like, I believe, to have the liberty of choosing who they shall be  in the first place,\" said the laughing girl. \"Don't we, Aunt Jeanette?\"    \"Me!\" cried Miss Peyton, starting; \"what do I know of such things,  child? You must ask someone else, if you wish to learn such matters.\"    \"Ah! you would have us think you were never young! But what am I to  believe of all the tales I have heard about the handsome Miss  Jeanette Peyton?\"    \"Nonsense, my dear, nonsense,\" said the aunt, endeavoring to suppress a  smile; \"it is very silly to believe all you hear.\"    \"Nonsense, do you call it?\" cried the captain, gayly. \"To this hour  General Montrose toasts Miss Peyton; I heard him within the week, at Sir  Henry's table.\"    \"Why, Henry, you are as saucy as your sister; and to break in upon your  folly, I must take you to see my new home-made manufactures, which I  will be bold enough to put in contrast with the finery of Birch.\"    The young people rose to follow their aunt, in perfect good humor with  each other and the world. On ascending the stairs to the place of  deposit for Miss Peyton's articles of domestic economy, she availed  herself, however, of an opportunity to inquire of her nephew, whether  General Montrose suffered as much from the gout as he had done when  she knew him.    It is a painful discovery we make, as we advance in life, that even  those we most love are not exempt from its frailties. When the heart is  fresh, and the view of the future unsullied by the blemishes which have  been gathered from the experience of the past, our feelings are most  holy: we love to identify with the persons of our natural friends all  those qualities to which we ourselves aspire, and all those virtues we  have been taught to revere. The confidence with which we esteem seems a  part of our nature; and there is a purity thrown around the affections  which tie us to our kindred that after life can seldom hope to see  uninjured. The family of Mr. Wharton continued to enjoy, for the  remainder of the day, a happiness to which they had long been strangers;  and one that sprang, in its younger members, from the delights of the  most confident affection, and the exchange of the most disinterested  endearments.    Harper appeared only at the dinner table, and he retired with the cloth,  under the pretense of some engagement in his own room. Notwithstanding  the confidence created by his manner, the family felt his absence a  relief; for the visit of Captain Wharton was necessarily to be confined  to a very few days, both from the limitation of his leave of absence,  and the danger of a discovery.    All dread of consequences, however, was lost in the pleasure of the  meeting. Once or twice during the day, Mr. Wharton had suggested a doubt  as to the character of his unknown guest, and the possibility of the  detection of his son proceeding in some manner from his information; but  the idea was earnestly opposed by all his children; even Sarah uniting  with her brother and sister in pleading warmly in favor of the sincerity  expressed in the outward appearance of the traveler.    \"Such appearances, my children,\" replied the desponding parent, \"are but  too often deceitful; when men like Major Andre lend themselves to the  purposes of fraud, it is idle to reason from qualities, much less  externals.\"    \"Fraud!\" cried his son quickly. \"Surely, sir, you forget that Major  Andre was serving his king, and that the usages of war justified  the measure.\"    \"And did not the usages of war justify his death, Henry?\" inquired  Frances, speaking in a low voice, unwilling to abandon what she thought  the cause of her country, and yet unable to suppress her feelings  for the man.    \"Never!\" exclaimed the young man, springing from his seat, and pacing  the floor rapidly. \"Frances, you shock me; suppose it should be my fate,  even now, to fall into the power of the rebels; you would vindicate my  execution--perhaps exult in the cruelty of Washington.\"    \"Henry!\" said Frances, solemnly, quivering with emotion, and with a face  pale as death, \"you little know my heart.\"    \"Pardon me, my sister--my little Fanny,\" cried the repentant youth,  pressing her to his bosom, and kissing off the tears which had burst,  spite of her resolution, from her eyes.    \"It is very foolish to regard your hasty words, I know,\" said Frances,  extricating herself from his arms, and raising her yet humid eyes to  his face with a smile; \"but reproach from those we love is most severe,  Henry; particularly--where we--we think--we know\"--her paleness  gradually gave place to the color of the rose, as she concluded in a low  voice, with her eyes directed to the carpet, \"we are undeserving of it.\"    Miss Peyton moved from her own seat to the one next her niece, and,  kindly taking her hand, observed, \"You should not suffer the impetuosity  of your brother to affect you so much; boys, you know, are proverbially  ungovernable.\"    \"And, from my conduct, you might add cruel,\" said the captain, seating  himself on the other side of his sister. \"But on the subject of the  death of Andre we are all of us uncommonly sensitive. You did not know  him: he was all that was brave--that was accomplished--that was  estimable.\" Frances smiled faintly, and shook her head, but made no  reply. Her brother, observing the marks of incredulity in her  countenance, continued, \"You doubt it, and justify his death?\"    \"I do not doubt his worth,\" replied the maid, mildly, \"nor his being  deserving of a more happy fate; but I cannot doubt the propriety of  Washington's conduct. I know but little of the customs of war, and wish  to know less; but with what hopes of success could the Americans  contend, if they yielded all the principles which long usage had  established, to the exclusive purposes of the British?\"    \"Why contend at all?\" cried Sarah, impatiently. \"Besides, being rebels,  all their acts are illegal.\"    \"Women are but mirrors, which reflect the images before them,\" cried the  captain, good-naturedly. \"In Frances I see the picture of Major  Dunwoodie, and in Sarah--\"    \"Colonel Wellmere,\" interrupted the younger sister, laughing, and  blushing crimson. \"I must confess I am indebted to the major for my  reasoning--am I not, Aunt Jeanette?\"    \"I believe it is something like his logic, indeed, child.\"    \"I plead guilty; and you. Sarah, have not forgotten the learned  discussions of Colonel Wellmere.\"    \"I trust I never forget the right,\" said Sarah, emulating her sister in  color, and rising, under the pretense of avoiding the heat of the fire.    Nothing occurred of any moment during the rest of the day; but in the  evening Caesar reported that he had overheard voices in the room of  Harper, conversing in a low tone. The apartment occupied by the traveler  was the wing at the extremity of the building, opposite to the parlor in  which the family ordinarily assembled; and it seems that Caesar had  established a regular system of espionage, with a view to the safety of  his young master. This intelligence gave some uneasiness to all the  members of the family; but the entrance of Harper himself, with the air  of benevolence and sincerity which shone through his reserve, soon  removed the doubts from the breast of all but Mr. Wharton. His children  and sister believed Caesar to have been mistaken, and the evening passed  off without any additional alarm.    On the afternoon of the succeeding day, the party were assembled in the  parlor around the tea table of Miss Peyton, when a change in the weather  occurred. The thin _scud_, that apparently floated but a short distance  above the tops of the hills, began to drive from the west towards the  east in astonishing rapidity. The rain yet continued to beat against the  eastern windows of the house with fury; in that direction the heavens  were dark and gloomy.

On it one  made one's bed, hard, it is true, but yet a bed. You always take your rugs  with you for covering at night, you put your portmanteau under your head as  a pillow, and there you are! You may rely upon one thing. People who, on  their return from Palestine, tell you that they had a comfortable trip,  have seen nothing of the real life of the country. To do that you must  rough it, as I did both at Modin and at Hebron. To return to the latter.  The rooms have stone floors and vaulted roofs, the children walk about with  wooden shoes, and the pitter-patter makes a pleasant music. They throw off  the shoes as they enter the room. My host had been in Hebron for six years,  and he told me overnight what I observed for myself next day, that,  considering the fearful conditions under which the children live, there is  comparatively little sickness. As for providing meals, a genuine communism  prevails. You produce your food, your host adds his store, and you partake  in common of the feast to which both sides contribute. After a good long  talk, I got to sleep easily, thinking, as I dozed off, that I should pass a  pleasant night. I had become impervious to the mosquitoes, but there was  something else which I had forgotten. Was it a dream, an awful nightmare,  or had a sudden descent of Bedouins occurred? Gradually I was awakened by a  noise as of wild beasts let loose, howls of rage and calls to battle. It  was only the dogs. In Jerusalem I had never heard them, as the Jewish hotel  was then well out of the town; it has since been moved nearer in. It is  impossible to convey a sense of the terrifying effect produced by one's  first experience of the night orgies of Oriental dogs, it curdles your  blood to recall it. Seen by daytime, the dogs are harmless enough, as they  go about their scavenger work among the heaps of refuse and filth. But by  night they are howling demons, stampeding about the streets in mad groups,  barking to and at each other, whining piteously one moment, roaring  hoarsely and snapping fiercely another.    The dogs did me one service, they made me get up early. I walked through a  bluish-gray atmosphere. Colors in Judea are bright, yet there is always an  effect as of a thin gauze veil over them. I went, then, into the streets,  and at five o'clock the sun was high, and the bustle of the place had  begun. The air was keen and fresh, and many were already abroad. I saw some  camels start for Jerusalem, laden with straw mats made in Hebron.    Next went some asses carrying poultry for the Holy City, then a family  caravan with its inevitable harem of closely veiled women. Then I saw a man  with tools for hewing stone, camels coming into Hebron, a boy with a large  petroleum can going to fetch water,--they are abandoning the use of the  olden picturesque stone pitchers,--then I saw asses loaded with vine twigs,  one with lime, women with black dresses and long white veils, boys with  bent backs carrying iron stones. I saw, too, some Bethlehemite Christians  hurrying home to the traditional site of the nativity. You can always  distinguish these, for they are the only Christians in Palestine that wear  turbans habitually. And all over the landscape dominated the beautiful  green hills, fresh with the morning dew, a dew so thick that I had what I  had not expected, a real morning bath. I was soaked quite wet by the time I  returned from my solitary stroll. I had a capital breakfast, for which we  supplied the solids, and our host the coffee. Butter is a luxury which we  neither expected nor got. Hebron, none the less, seemed to me a Paradise,  and I applauded the legend that locates Adam and Eve in this spot.    Alas! I had not yet seen Hebron. The doctor lived on the outskirts near the  highroad, where there are many fine and beautiful residences. I was soon to  enter the streets and receive a rude awakening, when I saw the manner in  which the fifteen hundred Jews of Hebron live. Hebron is a ghetto in a  garden; it is worse than even Jerusalem, Jerusalem being clean in  comparison. Dirty, dark, narrow, vaulted, unevenly paved, running with  liquid slime--such are the streets of Hebron. You are constantly in danger  of slipping, unless you wear the flat, heel-less Eastern shoes, and, if you  once fell, not all the perfumes of Araby could make you sweet again.    I should say that, before starting on my round, I had to secure the  attendance of soldiers. Not that it was necessary, but they utilize  Baedeker's assertion, that the people are savage, to get fees out of  visitors--a cunning manner of turning the enemy's libels to profitable  account. I hired two soldiers, but one by one others joined my train, so  that by the time my tour was over, I had a whole regiment of guardians, all  demanding baksheesh. I would only deal with the leader, a ragged warrior  with two daggers, a sword, and a rifle. \"How much?\" I asked. \"We usually  ask a napoleon (_i.e._ 20 francs) for an escort, but we will charge you  only ten francs.\" I turned to the doctor and asked him, \"How much?\" \"Give  them a beslik between them,\" he said. A beslik is only five pence. I  offered it in trepidation, but the sum satisfied the whole gang, who  thanked me profusely.    First I visited the prison, a sort of open air cage, in which about a dozen  men were smoking cigarettes. The prison was much nicer than the Mohammedan  school close by. This was a small overcrowded room, with no window in it,  the little boys sitting on the ground, swaying with a sleepy chant. The  teacher's only function was represented by his huge cane, which he plied  often and skilfully. Outside the door was a barber shaving a pilgrim's  head. The pilgrim was a Muslim, going on the Haj to Mecca. These pilgrims  are looked on with mingled feelings; their piety is admired, but also  distrusted. A local saying is, \"If thy neighbor has been on the Haj, beware  of him; if he has been twice, have no dealings with him; if he has been  thrice, move into another street.\" After the pilgrim, I passed a number of  blind weavers, working before large wooden frames.    But now for the Jewish quarter. This is entered by a low wooden door, at  which we had to knock and then stoop to get in. The Jews are no longer  forced to have this door, but they retain it voluntarily. Having got in, we  were in a street so dark that we could not see a foot before us, but we  kept moving, and soon came to a slightly better place, where the sun crept  through in fitful gleams. The oldest synagogue was entered first. Its  flooring was of marble squares, its roof vaulted, and its Ark looked north  towards Jerusalem. There were, as so often in the East, two Arks; when one  is too small, they do not enlarge it, but build another. The Sefardic  Talmud Torah is a small room without window or ventilation, the only light  and air enter by the door. The children were huddled together on an  elevated wooden platform. They could read Hebrew fluently, and most of them  spoke Arabic. The German children speak Yiddish; the custom of using Hebrew  as a living language has not spread here so much as in Jaffa and the  colonies. The Beth ha-Midrash for older children was a little better  equipped; it had a stone floor, but the pupils reclined on couches round  the walls. They learn very little of what we should call secular subjects.  I examined the store of manuscripts, but Professor Schechter had been  before me, and there was nothing left but modern Cabbalistic literature.  The other synagogue is small, and very bare of ornament. The Rabbi was  seated there, \"learning,\" with great Tefillin and Tallith on--a fine,  simple, benevolent soul. To my surprise he spoke English, and turned out to  be none other than Rachmim Joseph Franco, who, as long ago as 1851, when  the earthquake devastated the Jewish quarter, had been sent from Rhodes to  collect relief funds. He was very ailing, and I could not have a long  conversation with him, but he told me that he had known my father, who was  then a boy, in London. Then I entered a typical Jewish dwelling of the  poor. It consisted of a single room, opening on to the dark street, and had  a tiny barred window at the other side. On the left was a broad bed, on the  right a rude cooking stove and a big water pitcher. There was nothing else  in the room, except a deep stagnant mud pool, which filled the centre of  the floor.    Next door they were baking Matzoth in an oven fed by a wood fire. It was a  few days before Passover. The Matzoth were coarse, and had none of the  little holes with which we are familiar. So through streets within streets,  dirt within dirt, room over room, in hopeless intricacy. Then we were  brought to a standstill, a man was coming down the street with a bundle of  wood, and we had to wait till he had gone by, the streets being too narrow  for two persons to pass each other. Another street was impassable for a  different reason, there was quite a river of flowing mud, knee deep. I  asked for a boat, but a man standing by hoisted me on his shoulders, and  carried me across, himself wading through it with the same unconcern as the  boys and girls were wallowing in it, playing and amusing themselves. How  alike children are all the world over!    And yet, with it all, Hebron is a healthy place. There is little of the  intermittent fever prevalent in other parts of Palestine; illness is  common, but not in a bad form. Jerusalem is far more unhealthy, because of  the lack of water. But the Jews of Hebron are miserably poor. How they live  is a mystery. They are not allowed to own land, even if they could acquire  it. There was once a little business to be done in lending money to the  Arabs, but as the Government refuses to help in the collection of debts,  this trade is not flourishing, and a good thing, too. There are, of course,  some industries."]]]
