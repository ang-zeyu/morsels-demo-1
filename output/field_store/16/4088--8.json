I saw the livid stone, throughout the sides  And in its bottom full of apertures,  All equal in their width, and circular each,  Nor ample less nor larger they appear'd  Than in Saint John's fair dome of me belov'd  Those fram'd to hold the pure baptismal streams,  One of the which I brake, some few years past,  To save a whelming infant; and be this  A seal to undeceive whoever doubts  The motive of my deed.  From out the mouth  Of every one, emerg'd a sinner's feet  And of the legs high upward as the calf  The rest beneath was hid.  On either foot  The soles were burning, whence the flexile joints  Glanc'd with such violent motion, as had snapt  Asunder cords or twisted withs.  As flame,  Feeding on unctuous matter, glides along  The surface, scarcely touching where it moves;  So here, from heel to point, glided the flames.       \"Master! say who is he, than all the rest  Glancing in fiercer agony, on whom  A ruddier flame doth prey?\"  I thus inquir'd.       \"If thou be willing,\" he replied, \"that I  Carry thee down, where least the slope bank falls,  He of himself shall tell thee and his wrongs.\"       I then:  \"As pleases thee to me is best.  Thou art my lord; and know'st that ne'er I quit  Thy will:  what silence hides that knowest thou.\"  Thereat on the fourth pier we came, we turn'd,  And on our left descended to the depth,  A narrow strait and perforated close.  Nor from his side my leader set me down,  Till to his orifice he brought, whose limb  Quiv'ring express'd his pang.  \"Whoe'er thou art,  Sad spirit! thus revers'd, and as a stake  Driv'n in the soil!\"  I in these words began,  \"If thou be able, utter forth thy voice.\"       There stood I like the friar, that doth shrive  A wretch for murder doom'd, who e'en when fix'd,  Calleth him back, whence death awhile delays.       He shouted:  \"Ha! already standest there?  Already standest there, O Boniface!  By many a year the writing play'd me false.  So early dost thou surfeit with the wealth,  For which thou fearedst not in guile to take  The lovely lady, and then mangle her?\"       I felt as those who, piercing not the drift  Of answer made them, stand as if expos'd  In mockery, nor know what to reply,  When Virgil thus admonish'd:  \"Tell him quick,  I am not he, not he, whom thou believ'st.\"       And I, as was enjoin'd me, straight replied.       That heard, the spirit all did wrench his feet,  And sighing next in woeful accent spake:  \"What then of me requirest?\"  If to know  So much imports thee, who I am, that thou  Hast therefore down the bank descended, learn  That in the mighty mantle I was rob'd,  And of a she-bear was indeed the son,  So eager to advance my whelps, that there  My having in my purse above I stow'd,  And here myself.  Under my head are dragg'd  The rest, my predecessors in the guilt  Of simony.  Stretch'd at their length they lie  Along an opening in the rock.  'Midst them  I also low shall fall, soon as he comes,  For whom I took thee, when so hastily  I question'd.  But already longer time  Hath pass'd, since my souls kindled, and I thus  Upturn'd have stood, than is his doom to stand  Planted with fiery feet.  For after him,  One yet of deeds more ugly shall arrive,  From forth the west, a shepherd without law,  Fated to cover both his form and mine.  He a new Jason shall be call'd, of whom  In Maccabees we read; and favour such  As to that priest his king indulgent show'd,  Shall be of France's monarch shown to him.\"       I know not if I here too far presum'd,  But in this strain I answer'd:  \"Tell me now,  What treasures from St. Peter at the first  Our Lord demanded, when he put the keys  Into his charge?  Surely he ask'd no more  But, Follow me!  Nor Peter nor the rest  Or gold or silver of Matthias took,  When lots were cast upon the forfeit place  Of the condemned soul.  Abide thou then;  Thy punishment of right is merited:  And look thou well to that ill-gotten coin,  Which against Charles thy hardihood inspir'd.  If reverence of the keys restrain'd me not,  Which thou in happier time didst hold, I yet  Severer speech might use.  Your avarice  O'ercasts the world with mourning, under foot  Treading the good, and raising bad men up.  Of shepherds, like to you, th' Evangelist  Was ware, when her, who sits upon the waves,  With kings in filthy whoredom he beheld,  She who with seven heads tower'd at her birth,  And from ten horns her proof of glory drew,  Long as her spouse in virtue took delight.  Of gold and silver ye have made your god,  Diff'ring wherein from the idolater,  But he that worships one, a hundred ye?  Ah, Constantine! to how much ill gave birth,  Not thy conversion, but that plenteous dower,  Which the first wealthy Father gain'd from thee!\"       Meanwhile, as thus I sung, he, whether wrath  Or conscience smote him, violent upsprang  Spinning on either sole.  I do believe  My teacher well was pleas'd, with so compos'd  A lip, he listen'd ever to the sound  Of the true words I utter'd.  In both arms  He caught, and to his bosom lifting me  Upward retrac'd the way of his descent.       Nor weary of his weight he press'd me close,  Till to the summit of the rock we came,  Our passage from the fourth to the fifth pier.  His cherish'd burden there gently he plac'd  Upon the rugged rock and steep, a path  Not easy for the clamb'ring goat to mount.       Thence to my view another vale appear'd        CANTO  XX    AND now the verse proceeds to torments new,  Fit argument of this the twentieth strain  Of the first song, whose awful theme records  The spirits whelm'd in woe.  Earnest I look'd  Into the depth, that open'd to my view,  Moisten'd with tears of anguish, and beheld  A tribe, that came along the hollow vale,  In silence weeping:  such their step as walk  Quires chanting solemn litanies on earth.       As on them more direct mine eye descends,  Each wondrously seem'd to be revers'd  At the neck-bone, so that the countenance  Was from the reins averted:  and because  None might before him look, they were compell'd  To' advance with backward gait.  Thus one perhaps  Hath been by force of palsy clean transpos'd,  But I ne'er saw it nor believe it so.       Now, reader! think within thyself, so God  Fruit of thy reading give thee! how I long  Could keep my visage dry, when I beheld  Near me our form distorted in such guise,  That on the hinder parts fall'n from the face  The tears down-streaming roll'd.  Against a rock  I leant and wept, so that my guide exclaim'd:  \"What, and art thou too witless as the rest?  Here pity most doth show herself alive,  When she is dead.  What guilt exceedeth his,  Who with Heaven's judgment in his passion strives?  Raise up thy head, raise up, and see the man,  Before whose eyes earth gap'd in Thebes, when all  Cried out, 'Amphiaraus, whither rushest?  'Why leavest thou the war?'  He not the less  Fell ruining far as to Minos down,  Whose grapple none eludes.  Lo! how he makes  The breast his shoulders, and who once too far  Before him wish'd to see, now backward looks,  And treads reverse his path.  Tiresias note,  Who semblance chang'd, when woman he became  Of male, through every limb transform'd, and then  Once more behov'd him with his rod to strike  The two entwining serpents, ere the plumes,  That mark'd the better sex, might shoot again.       \"Aruns, with rere his belly facing, comes.  On Luni's mountains 'midst the marbles white,  Where delves Carrara's hind, who wons beneath,  A cavern was his dwelling, whence the stars  And main-sea wide in boundless view he held.       \"The next, whose loosen'd tresses overspread  Her bosom, which thou seest not (for each hair  On that side grows) was Manto, she who search'd  Through many regions, and at length her seat  Fix'd in my native land, whence a short space  My words detain thy audience.  When her sire  From life departed, and in servitude  The city dedicate to Bacchus mourn'd,  Long time she went a wand'rer through the world.  Aloft in Italy's delightful land  A lake there lies, at foot of that proud Alp,  That o'er the Tyrol locks Germania in,  Its name Benacus, which a thousand rills,  Methinks, and more, water between the vale  Camonica and Garda and the height  Of Apennine remote.  There is a spot  At midway of that lake, where he who bears  Of Trento's flock the past'ral staff, with him  Of Brescia, and the Veronese, might each  Passing that way his benediction give.  A garrison of goodly site and strong  Peschiera stands, to awe with front oppos'd  The Bergamese and Brescian, whence the shore  More slope each way descends.  There, whatsoev'er  Benacus' bosom holds not, tumbling o'er  Down falls, and winds a river flood beneath  Through the green pastures.

Hence journeying, the savage maiden saw  'Midst of the fen a territory waste  And naked of inhabitants.

If thou hear  Henceforth another origin assign'd  Of that my country, I forewarn thee now,  That falsehood none beguile thee of the truth.\"       I answer'd:  \"Teacher, I conclude thy words  So certain, that all else shall be to me  As embers lacking life.  But now of these,  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10084"],[0,"Kazan (#12)"],[1,"wild brothers and sisters in the forests and out on  the plains. Usually she would snarl at the Voice, and sometimes nip  Kazan lightly to show her displeasure. But to-day, as the Voice came a  third time, she slunk back into the darkness of a fissure between two  rocks, and Kazan saw only the fiery glow of her eyes.    Kazan ran nervously to the trail their feet had worn up to the top of  the Sun Rock, and stood undecided. All day, and yesterday, he had been  uneasy and disturbed. Whatever it was that stirred him seemed to be in  the air, for he could not see it or hear it or scent it. But he could  _feel_ it. He went to the fissure and sniffed at Gray Wolf. Usually she  whined coaxingly. But her response to-day was to draw back her lips  until he could see her white fangs.    A fourth tune the Voice came to them faintly, and she snapped fiercely  at some unseen thing in the darkness between the two rocks. Kazan went  again to the trail, still hesitating. Then he began to go down. It was a  narrow winding trail, worn only by the pads and claws of animals, for  the Sun Rock was a huge crag that rose almost sheer up for a hundred  feet above the tops of the spruce and balsam, its bald crest catching  the first gleams of the sun in the morning and the last glow of it in  the evening. Gray Wolf had first led Kazan to the security of the  retreat at the top of the rock.    When he reached the bottom he no longer hesitated, but darted swiftly in  the direction of the cabin. Because of that instinct of the wild that  was still in him, he always approached the cabin with caution. He never  gave warning, and for a moment Joan was startled when she looked up from  her baby and saw Kazan's shaggy head and shoulders in the open door. The  baby struggled and kicked in her delight, and held out her two hands  with cooing cries to Kazan. Joan, too, held out a hand.    \"Kazan!\" she cried softly. \"Come in, Kazan!\"    Slowly the wild red light in Kazan's eyes softened. He put a forefoot on  the sill, and stood there, while the girl urged him again. Suddenly his  legs seemed to sink a little under him, his tail drooped and he slunk in  with that doggish air of having committed a crime. The creatures he  loved were in the cabin, but the cabin itself he hated. He hated all  cabins, for they all breathed of the club and the whip and bondage. Like  all sledge-dogs he preferred the open snow for a bed, and the  spruce-tops for shelter.    Joan dropped her hand to his head, and at its touch there thrilled  through him that strange joy that was his reward for leaving Gray Wolf  and the wild. Slowly he raised his head until his black muzzle rested on  her lap, and he closed his eyes while that wonderful little creature  that mystified him so--the baby--prodded him with her tiny feet, and  pulled his tawny hair. He loved these baby-maulings even more than the  touch of Joan's hand.    Motionless, sphinx-like, undemonstrative in every muscle of his body,  Kazan stood, scarcely breathing. More than once this lack of  demonstration had urged Joan's husband to warn her. But the wolf that  was in Kazan, his wild aloofness, even his mating with Gray Wolf had  made her love him more. She understood, and had faith in him.    In the days of the last snow Kazan had proved himself. A neighboring  trapper had run over with his team, and the baby Joan had toddled up to  one of the big huskies. There was a fierce snap of jaws, a scream of  horror from Joan, a shout from the men as they leaped toward the pack.  But Kazan was ahead of them all. In a gray streak that traveled with the  speed of a bullet he was at the big husky's throat. When they pulled him  off, the husky was dead. Joan thought of that now, as the baby kicked  and tousled Kazan's head.    \"Good old Kazan,\" she cried softly, putting her face down close to him.  \"We're glad you came, Kazan, for we're going to be alone to-night--baby  and I. Daddy's gone to the post, and you must care for us while he's  away.\"    She tickled his nose with the end of her long shining braid. This always  delighted the baby, for in spite of his stoicism Kazan had to sniff and  sometimes to sneeze, and twig his ears. And it pleased him, too. He  loved the sweet scent of Joan's hair.    \"And you'd fight for us, if you had to, wouldn't you?\" she went on. Then  she rose quietly. \"I must close the door,\" she said. \"I don't want you  to go away again to-day, Kazan. You must stay with us.\"    Kazan went off to his corner, and lay down. Just as there had been some  strange thing at the top of the Sun Rock to disturb him that day, so now  there was a mystery that disturbed him in the cabin. He sniffed the air,  trying to fathom its secret. Whatever it was, it seemed to make his  mistress different, too. And she was digging out all sorts of odds and  ends of things about the cabin, and doing them up in packages. Late that  night, before she went to bed, Joan came and snuggled her hand close  down beside him for a few moments.    \"We're going away,\" she whispered, and there was a curious tremble that  was almost a sob in her voice. \"We're going home, Kazan. We're going  away down where his people live--where they have churches, and cities,  and music, and all the beautiful things in the world. And we're going to  take _you_, Kazan!\"    Kazan didn't understand. But he was happy at having the woman so near to  him, and talking to him. At these times he forgot Gray Wolf. The dog  that was in him surged over his quarter-strain of wildness, and the  woman and the baby alone filled his world. But after Joan had gone to  her bed, and all was quiet in the cabin, his old uneasiness returned. He  rose to his feet and moved stealthily about the cabin, sniffing at the  walls, the door and the things his mistress had done into packages. A  low whine rose in his throat. Joan, half asleep, heard it, and murmured:  \"Be quiet, Kazan. Go to sleep--go to sleep--\"    Long after that, Kazan stood rigid in the center of the room, listening,  trembling. And faintly he heard, far away, the wailing cry of, Gray  Wolf. But to-night it was not the cry of loneliness. It sent a thrill  through him. He ran to the door, and whined, but Joan was deep in  slumber and did not hear him. Once more he heard the cry, and only once.  Then the night grew still. He crouched down near the door.    Joan found him there, still watchful, still listening, when she awoke in  the early morning. She came to open the door for him, and in a moment he  was gone. His feet seemed scarcely to touch the earth as he sped in the  direction of the Sun Rock. Across the plain he could see the cap of it  already painted with a golden glow.    He came to the narrow winding trail, and wormed his way up it swiftly.    Gray Wolf was not at the top to greet him. But he could smell her, and  the scent of that other thing was strong in the air. His muscles  tightened; his legs grew tense. Deep down in his chest there began the  low rumble of a growl. He knew now what that strange thing was that had  haunted him, and made him uneasy. It was _life_. Something that lived  and breathed had invaded the home which he and Gray Wolf had chosen. He  bared his long fangs, and a snarl of defiance drew back his lips.  Stiff-legged, prepared to spring, his neck and head reaching out, he  approached the two rocks between which Gray Wolf had crept the night  before. She was still there. And with her was _something else_. After a  moment the tenseness left Kazan's body. His bristling crest drooped  until it lay flat. His ears shot forward, and he put his head and  shoulders between the two rocks, and whined softly. And Gray Wolf  whined. Slowly Kazan backed out, and faced the rising sun. Then he lay  down, so that his body shielded I the entrance to the chamber between  the rocks.    Gray Wolf was a mother.          CHAPTER IX    THE TRAGEDY ON SUN ROCK      All that day Kazan guarded the top of the Sun Rock. Fate, and the fear  and brutality of masters, had heretofore kept him from fatherhood, and  he was puzzled. Something told him now that he belonged to the Sun Rock,  and not to the cabin. The call that came to him from over the plain was  not so strong. At dusk Gray Wolf came out from her retreat, and slunk to  his side, whimpering, and nipped gently at his shaggy neck. It was the  old instinct of his fathers that made him respond by caressing Gray  Wolf's face with his tongue. Then Gray Wolf's jaws opened, and she  laughed in short panting breaths, as if she had been hard run. She was  happy, and as they heard a little snuffling sound from between the  rocks, Kazan wagged his tail, and Gray Wolf darted back to her young.    The babyish cry and its effect upon Gray Wolf taught Kazan his first  lesson in fatherhood. Instinct again told him that Gray Wolf could not  go down to the hunt with him now--that she must stay at the top of the  Sun Rock. So when the moon rose he went down alone, and toward dawn  returned with a big white rabbit between his jaws. It was the wild in  him that made him do this, and Gray Wolf ate ravenously. Then he knew  that each night hereafter he must hunt for Gray Wolf--and the little  whimpering creatures hidden between the two rocks.    The next day, and still the next, he did not go to the cabin, though he  heard the voices of both the man and the woman calling him. On the fifth  he went down, and Joan and the baby were so glad that the woman hugged  him, and the baby kicked and laughed and screamed at him, while the man  stood by cautiously, watching their demonstrations with a gleam of  disapprobation in his eyes.    \"I'm afraid of him,\" he told Joan for the hundredth time. \"That's the  wolf-gleam in his eyes. He's of a treacherous breed. Sometimes I wish  we'd never brought him home.\"    \"If we hadn't--where would the baby--have gone?\" Joan reminded him, a  little catch in her voice.    \"I had almost forgotten that,\" said her husband. \"Kazan, you old devil,  I"]]]
