Because you've  no idea what a bother it is. Everybody wanted to put in everything just  as they liked, no matter how much room there was on the page. It was  simply awful! Dora put up with it as long as she could and then she said  if she wasn't let alone she wouldn't go on being editor; they could be  the paper's editors themselves, so there.    Then Oswald said, like a good brother: 'I will help you if you like,  Dora,' and she said, 'You're more trouble than all the rest of them!  Come and be editor and see how you like it. I give it up to you.'  But she didn't, and we did it together. We let Albert-next-door be  sub-editor, because he had hurt his foot with a nail in his boot that  gathered.    When it was done Albert-next-door's uncle had it copied for us in  typewriting, and we sent copies to all our friends, and then of course  there was no one left that we could ask to buy it. We did not think of  that until too late. We called the paper the Lewisham Recorder; Lewisham  because we live there, and Recorder in memory of the good editor. I  could write a better paper on my head, but an editor is not allowed to  write all the paper. It is very hard, but he is not. You just have to  fill up with what you can get from other writers. If I ever have time I  will write a paper all by myself. It won't be patchy. We had no time to  make it an illustrated paper, but I drew the ship going down with all  hands for the first copy. But the typewriter can't draw ships, so it was  left out in the other copies. The time the first paper took to write out  no one would believe! This was the Newspaper:              THE LEWISHAM RECORDER        EDITORS:  DORA AND OSWALD BASTABLE                 ------------             EDITORIAL NOTE    Every paper is written for some reason. Ours is because we want to sell  it and get money. If what we have written brings happiness to any sad  heart we shall not have laboured in vain. But we want the money too.  Many papers are content with the sad heart and the happiness, but we are  not like that, and it is best not to be deceitful. EDITORS.    There will be two serial stories; One by Dicky and one by all of us. In  a serial story you only put in one chapter at a time. But we shall put  all our serial story at once, if Dora has time to copy it. Dicky's will  come later on.                SERIAL STORY               BY US ALL             CHAPTER I--by Dora    The sun was setting behind a romantic-looking tower when two strangers  might have been observed descending the crest of the hill. The eldest,  a man in the prime of life; the other a handsome youth who reminded  everybody of Quentin Durward. They approached the Castle, in which the  fair Lady Alicia awaited her deliverers. She leaned from the castellated  window and waved her lily hand as they approached. They returned her  signal, and retired to seek rest and refreshment at a neighbouring  hostelry.                 ------------         CHAPTER II--by Alice    The Princess was very uncomfortable in the tower, because her fairy  godmother had told her all sorts of horrid things would happen if she  didn't catch a mouse every day, and she had caught so many mice that now  there were hardly any left to catch. So she sent her carrier pigeon to  ask the noble Strangers if they could send her a few mice--because she  would be of age in a few days and then it wouldn't matter. So the fairy  godmother--- (I'm very sorry, but there's no room to make the chapters  any longer.-ED.)                 ------------         CHAPTER III--by the Sub-Editor    (I can't--I'd much rather not--I don't know how.)                ------------         CHAPTER IV--by Dicky    I must now retrace my steps and tell you something about our hero. You  must know he had been to an awfully jolly school, where they had turkey  and goose every day for dinner, and never any mutton, and as many helps  of pudding as a fellow cared to send up his plate for--so of course they  had all grown up very strong, and before he left school he challenged  the Head to have it out man to man, and he gave it him, I tell you. That  was the education that made him able to fight Red Indians, and to be the  stranger who might have been observed in the first chapter.                 ------------         CHAPTER V--by Noel    I think it's time something happened in this story. So then the dragon  he came out, blowing fire out of his nose, and he said--    'Come on, you valiant man and true, I'd like to have a set-to along of  you!'    (That's bad English.--ED. I don't care; it's what the dragon said. Who  told you dragons didn't talk bad English?--Noel.)    So the hero, whose name was Noeloninuris, replied--         'My blade is sharp, my axe is keen,       You're not nearly as big       As a good many dragons I've seen.'    (Don't put in so much poetry, Noel. It's not fair, because none of the  others can do it.--ED.)    And then they went at it, and he beat the dragon, just as he did the  Head in Dicky's part of the Story, and so he married the Princess, and  they lived--- (No they didn't--not till the last chapter.--ED.)                 ------------         CHAPTER VI--by H. O.    I think it's a very nice Story--but what about the mice? I don't want to  say any more. Dora can have what's left of my chapter.                 ------------         CHAPTER VII--by the Editors    And so when the dragon was dead there were lots of mice, because he used  to kill them for his tea but now they rapidly multiplied and ravaged the  country, so the fair lady Alicia, sometimes called the Princess, had  to say she would not marry any one unless they could rid the country of  this plague of mice. Then the Prince, whose real name didn't begin  with N, but was Osrawalddo, waved his magic sword, and the dragon stood  before them, bowing gracefully. They made him promise to be good, and  then they forgave him; and when the wedding breakfast came, all the  bones were saved for him. And so they were married and lived happy ever  after.    (What became of the other stranger?--NOEL. The dragon ate him because he  asked too many questions.--EDITORS.)    This is the end of the story.                INSTRUCTIVE    It only takes four hours and a quarter now to get from London to  Manchester; but I should not think any one would if they could help it.    A DREADFUL WARNING. A wicked boy told me a very instructive thing about  ginger. They had opened one of the large jars, and he happened to take  out quite a lot, and he made it all right by dropping marbles in, till  there was as much ginger as before. But he told me that on the Sunday,  when it was coming near the part where there is only juice generally, I  had no idea what his feelings were. I don't see what he could have said  when they asked him. I should be sorry to act like it.                 ------------             SCIENTIFIC    Experiments should always be made out of doors. And don't use  benzoline.--DICKY. (That was when he burnt his eyebrows off.--ED.)    The earth is 2,400 miles round, and 800 through--at least I think so,  but perhaps it's the other way.--DICKY. (You ought to have been sure  before you began.--ED.)                 ------------            SCIENTIFIC COLUMN    In this so-called Nineteenth Century Science is but too little  considered in the nurseries of the rich and proud. But we are not like  that.    It is not generally known that if you put bits of camphor in luke-warm  water it will move about. If you drop sweet oil in, the camphor will  dart away and then stop moving. But don't drop any till you are tired  of it, because the camphor won't any more afterwards. Much amusement and  instruction is lost by not knowing things like this.    If you put a sixpence under a shilling in a wine-glass, and blow hard  down the side of the glass, the sixpence will jump up and sit on the top  of the shilling. At least I can't do it myself, but my cousin can. He is  in the Navy.                 ------------         ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS    Noel. You are very poetical, but I am sorry to say it will not do.    Alice. Nothing will ever make your hair curl, so it's no use. Some  people say it's more important to tidy up as you go along. I don't mean  you in particular, but every one.    H. O. We never said you were tubby, but the Editor does not know any  cure.    Noel. If there is any of the paper over when this newspaper is finished,  I will exchange it for your shut-up inkstand, or the knife that has the  useful thing in it for taking stones out of horses' feet, but you can't  have it without.    H. O. There are many ways how your steam engine might stop working.  You might ask Dicky. He knows one of them. I think it is the way yours  stopped.    Noel. If you think that by filling the garden with sand you can make  crabs build their nests there you are not at all sensible.    You have altered your poem about the battle of Waterloo so often, that  we cannot read it except where the Duke waves his sword and says some  thing we can't read either. Why did you write it on blotting-paper with  purple chalk?--ED. (Because YOU KNOW WHO sneaked my pencil.--NOEL.)                 ------------             POETRY        The Assyrian came down like a wolf on the fold,      And the way he came down was awful, I'm told;      But it's nothing to the way one of the Editors comes down on me,      If I crumble my bread-and-butter or spill my tea.

You can't do half the things yourself that children in books do, making  models or soon. I wonder why?--ALICE.

The awakening was unforeseen, he repeated; it happened to  have fallen in with the trend of a social convulsion.    \"To explain it I must tell you the history of a gross and a half of  years,\" protested Howard.    \"The thing is this,\" said Graham. \"You are afraid of something I shall  do. In some way I am arbitrator--I might be arbitrator.\"    \"It is not that. But you have--I may tell you this much--the automatic  increase of your property puts great possibilities of interference in  your hands. And in certain other ways you have influence, with your  eighteenth century notions.\"    \"Nineteenth century,\" corrected Graham.    \"With your old world notions, anyhow, ignorant as you are of every  feature of our State.\"    \"Am I a fool?\"    \"Certainly not.\"    \"Do I seem to be the sort of man who would act rashly?\"    \"You were never expected to act at all. No one counted on your  awakening. No one dreamt you would ever awake. The Council had  surrounded you with antiseptic conditions. As a matter of fact, we  thought that you were dead--a mere arrest of decay. And--but it is too  complex. We dare not suddenly--while you are still half awake.\"    \"It won't do,\" said Graham. \"Suppose it is as you say--why am I not  being crammed night and day with facts and warnings and all the wisdom  of the time to fit me for my responsibilities? Am I any wiser now than  two days ago, if it is two days, when I awoke?\"    Howard pulled his lip.    \"I am beginning to feel--every hour I feel more clearly--a sense of  complex concealment of which you are the salient point. Is this Council,  or committee, or whatever they are, cooking the accounts of my estate?  Is that it?\"    \"That note of suspicion--\" said Howard.    \"Ugh!\" said Graham. \"Now, mark my words, it will be ill for those who  have put me here. It will be ill. I am alive. Make no doubt of it, I  am alive. Every day my pulse is stronger and my mind clearer and more  vigorous. No more quiescence. I am a man come back to life. And I want  to _live_--\"    \"_Live!_\"    Howard's face lit with an idea. He came towards Graham and spoke in an  easy confidential tone.    \"The Council secludes you here for your good. You are restless.  Naturally--an energetic man! You find it dull here. But we are anxious  that everything you may desire--every desire--every sort of desire...  There may be something. Is there any sort of company?\"    He paused meaningly.    \"Yes,\" said Graham thoughtfully. \"There is.\"    \"Ah! _Now!_ We have treated you neglectfully.\"    \"The crowds in yonder streets of yours.\"    \"That,\" said Howard, \"I am afraid--. But--\"    Graham began pacing the room. Howard stood near the door watching him.  The implication of Howard's suggestion was only half evident to Graham  Company? Suppose he were to accept the proposal, demand some sort  of _company_? Would there be any possibilities of gathering from  the conversation of this additional person some vague inkling of  the struggle that had broken out so vividly at his waking moment? He  meditated again, and the suggestion took colour. He turned on Howard  abruptly.    \"What do you mean by company?\"    Howard raised his eyes and shrugged his shoulders. \"Human beings,\" he  said, with a curious smile on his heavy face.    \"Our social ideas,\" he said, \"have a certain increased liberality,  perhaps, in comparison with your times. If a man wishes to relieve such  a tedium as this--by feminine society, for instance. We think it no  scandal. We have cleared our minds of formulae. There is in our city a  class, a necessary class, no longer despised--discreet--\"    Graham stopped dead.    \"It would pass the time,\" said Howard. \"It is a thing I should  perhaps have thought of before, but, as a matter of fact, so much is  happening--\"    He indicated the exterior world.    Graham hesitated. For a moment the figure of a possible woman that  his imagination suddenly created dominated his mind with an intense  attraction. Then he flashed into anger.    \"No!\" he shouted.    He began striding rapidly up and down the room.    \"Everything you say, everything you do, convinces me--of some great  issue in which I am concerned. I do not want to pass the time, as you  call it. Yes, I know. Desire and indulgence are life in a sense--and  Death! Extinction! In my life before I slept I had worked out  that pitiful question. I will not begin again. There is a city, a  multitude--. And meanwhile I am here like a rabbit in a bag.\"    His rage surged high. He choked for a moment and began to wave his  clenched fists. He gave way to an anger fit, he swore archaic curses.  His gestures had the quality of physical threats.    \"I do not know who your party may be. I am in the dark, and you keep  me in the dark. But I know this, that I am secluded here for no  good purpose. For no good purpose. I warn you, I warn you of the  consequences. Once I come at my power--\"    He realised that to threaten thus might be a danger to himself. He  stopped. Howard stood regarding him with a curious expression.    \"I take it this is a message to the Council,\" said Howard.    Graham had a momentary impulse to leap upon the man, fell or stun him.  It must have shown upon his face; at any rate Howard's movement was  quick. In a second the noiseless door had closed again, and the man from  the nineteenth century was alone.    For a moment he stood rigid, with clenched hands half raised. Then he  flung them down. \"What a fool I have been!\" he said, and gave way to  his anger again, stamping about the room and shouting curses. For a long  time he kept himself in a sort of frenzy, raging at his position, at his  own folly, at the knaves who had imprisoned him. He did this because  he did not want to look calmly at his position. He clung to his  anger--because he was afraid of Fear.    Presently he found himself reasoning with himself This imprisonment was  unaccountable, but no doubt the legal forms--new legal forms--of the  time permitted it. It must, of course, be legal. These people were two  hundred years further on in the march of civilisation than the Victorian  generation. It was not likely they would be less--humane. Yet they  had cleared their minds of formulae! Was humanity a formula as well as  chastity?    His imagination set to work to suggest things that might be done to him.  The attempts of his reason to dispose of these suggestions, though  for the most part logically valid, were quite unavailing. \"Why should  anything be done to me?\"    \"If the worst comes to the worst,\" he found himself saying at last, \"I  can give up what they want. But what do they want? And why don't they  ask me for it instead of cooping me up?\"    He returned to his former preoccupation with the Council's possible  intentions. He began to reconsider the details of Howard's behaviour,  sinister glances, inexplicable hesitations. Then, for a time, his mind  circled about the idea of escaping from these rooms; but whither could  he escape into this vast, crowded world? He would be worse off than  a Saxon yeoman suddenly dropped into nineteenth century London. And  besides, how could anyone escape from these rooms?    \"How can it benefit anyone if harm should happen to me?\"    He thought of the tumult, the great social trouble of which he was so  unaccountably the axis. A text, irrelevant enough and yet curiously  insistent, came floating up out of the darkness of his memory. This also  a Council had said:    \"It is expedient for us that one man should die for the people.\"        CHAPTER VIII. THE ROOF SPACES    As the fans in the circular aperture of the inner room rotated and  permitted glimpses of the night, dim sounds drifted in thereby. And  Graham, standing underneath, wrestling darkly with the unknown powers  that imprisoned him, and which he had now deliberately challenged, was  startled by the sound of a voice.    He peered up and saw in the intervals of the rotation, dark and dim,  the face and shoulders of a man regarding him. When a dark hand was  extended, the swift fan struck it, swung round and beat on with a little  brownish patch on the edge of its thin blade, and something began to  fall therefrom upon the floor, dripping silently.    Graham looked down, and there were spots of blood at his feet. He looked  up again in a strange excitement. The figure had gone.    He remained motionless--his every sense intent upon the flickering patch  of darkness, for outside it was high night. He became aware of some  faint, remote, dark specks floating lightly through the outer air. They  came down towards him, fitfully, eddyingly, and passed aside out of  the uprush from the fan. A gleam of light flickered, the specks flashed  white, and then the darkness came again. Warmed and lit as he was, he  perceived that it was snowing within a few feet of him.    Graham walked across the room and came back to the ventilator again. He  saw the head of a man pass near. There was a sound of whispering. Then  a smart blow on some metallic substance, effort, voices, and the vans  stopped. A gust of snowflakes whirled into the room, and vanished before  they touched the floor. \"Don't be afraid,\" said a voice.    Graham stood under the fan. \"Who are you?\" he whispered.    For a moment there was nothing but a swaying of the fan, and then the  head of a man was thrust cautiously into the opening. His face appeared  nearly inverted to Graham; his dark hair was wet with dissolving flakes  of snow upon it. His arm went up into the darkness holding something  unseen. He had a youthful face and bright eyes, and the veins of his  forehead were swollen. He seemed to be exerting himself to maintain his  position.    For several seconds neither he nor Graham spoke.    \"You were the Sleeper?\" said the stranger at last.    \"Yes,\" said Graham. \"What do you want with me?\"    \"I come from Ostrog, Sire.\"    \"Ostrog?\"    The man in"]]]
