[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9662"],[0,"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding (#11)"],[1," Had not the presence of an object,  instantly excited the idea of those objects, commonly conjoined with it,  all our knowledge must have been limited to the narrow sphere of our  memory and senses; and we should never have been able to adjust means to  ends, or employ our natural powers, either to the producing of good, or  avoiding of evil. Those, who delight in the discovery and contemplation  of _final causes_, have here ample subject to employ their wonder and  admiration.    45. I shall add, for a further confirmation of the foregoing theory,  that, as this operation of the mind, by which we infer like effects from  like causes, and _vice versa_, is so essential to the subsistence of all  human creatures, it is not probable, that it could be trusted to the  fallacious deductions of our reason, which is slow in its operations;  appears not, in any degree, during the first years of infancy; and at  best is, in every age and period of human life, extremely liable to  error and mistake. It is more conformable to the ordinary wisdom of  nature to secure so necessary an act of the mind, by some instinct or  mechanical tendency, which may be infallible in its operations, may  discover itself at the first appearance of life and thought, and may be  independent of all the laboured deductions of the understanding. As  nature has taught us the use of our limbs, without giving us the  knowledge of the muscles and nerves, by which they are actuated; so has  she implanted in us an instinct, which carries forward the thought in a  correspondent course to that which she has established among external  objects; though we are ignorant of those powers and forces, on which  this regular course and succession of objects totally depends.        SECTION VI.    OF PROBABILITY[9].        [9] Mr. Locke divides all arguments into demonstrative and      probable. In this view, we must say, that it is only probable      all men must die, or that the sun will rise to-morrow. But to      conform our language more to common use, we ought to divide      arguments into _demonstrations_, _proofs_, and _probabilities_.      By proofs meaning such arguments from experience as leave no      room for doubt or opposition.      46. Though there be no such thing as _Chance_ in the world; our  ignorance of the real cause of any event has the same influence on the  understanding, and begets a like species of belief or opinion.    There is certainly a probability, which arises from a superiority of  chances on any side; and according as this superiority encreases, and  surpasses the opposite chances, the probability receives a  proportionable encrease, and begets still a higher degree of belief or  assent to that side, in which we discover the superiority. If a dye were  marked with one figure or number of spots on four sides, and with  another figure or number of spots on the two remaining sides, it would  be more probable, that the former would turn up than the latter; though,  if it had a thousand sides marked in the same manner, and only one side  different, the probability would be much higher, and our belief or  expectation of the event more steady and secure. This process of the  thought or reasoning may seem trivial and obvious; but to those who  consider it more narrowly, it may, perhaps, afford matter for curious  speculation.    It seems evident, that, when the mind looks forward to discover the  event, which may result from the throw of such a dye, it considers the  turning up of each particular side as alike probable; and this is the  very nature of chance, to render all the particular events, comprehended  in it, entirely equal. But finding a greater number of sides concur in  the one event than in the other, the mind is carried more frequently to  that event, and meets it oftener, in revolving the various possibilities  or chances, on which the ultimate result depends. This concurrence of  several views in one particular event begets immediately, by an  inexplicable contrivance of nature, the sentiment of belief, and gives  that event the advantage over its antagonist, which is supported by a  smaller number of views, and recurs less frequently to the mind. If we  allow, that belief is nothing but a firmer and stronger conception of an  object than what attends the mere fictions of the imagination, this  operation may, perhaps, in some measure, be accounted for. The  concurrence of these several views or glimpses imprints the idea more  strongly on the imagination; gives it superior force and vigour; renders  its influence on the passions and affections more sensible; and in a  word, begets that reliance or security, which constitutes the nature of  belief and opinion.    47. The case is the same with the probability of causes, as with that of  chance. There are some causes, which are entirely uniform and constant  in producing a particular effect; and no instance has ever yet been  found of any failure or irregularity in their operation. Fire has always  burned, and water suffocated every human creature: The production of  motion by impulse and gravity is an universal law, which has hitherto  admitted of no exception. But there are other causes, which have been  found more irregular and uncertain; nor has rhubarb always proved a  purge, or opium a soporific to every one, who has taken these medicines.  It is true, when any cause fails of producing its usual effect,  philosophers ascribe not this to any irregularity in nature; but  suppose, that some secret causes, in the particular structure of parts,  have prevented the operation. Our reasonings, however, and conclusions  concerning the event are the same as if this principle had no place.  Being determined by custom to transfer the past to the future, in all  our inferences; where the past has been entirely regular and uniform, we  expect the event with the greatest assurance, and leave no room for any  contrary supposition. But where different effects have been found to  follow from causes, which are to _appearance_ exactly similar, all these  various effects must occur to the mind in transferring the past to the  future, and enter into our consideration, when we determine the  probability of the event. Though we give the preference to that which  has been found most usual, and believe that this effect will exist, we  must not overlook the other effects, but must assign to each of them a  particular weight and authority, in proportion as we have found it to be  more or less frequent. It is more probable, in almost every country of  Europe, that there will be frost sometime in January, than that the  weather will continue open throughout that whole month; though this  probability varies according to the different climates, and approaches  to a certainty in the more northern kingdoms. Here then it seems  evident, that, when we transfer the past to the future, in order to  determine the effect, which will result from any cause, we transfer all  the different events, in the same proportion as they have appeared in  the past, and conceive one to have existed a hundred times, for  instance, another ten times, and another once. As a great number of  views do here concur in one event, they fortify and confirm it to the  imagination, beget that sentiment which we call _belief,_ and give its  object the preference above the contrary event, which is not supported  by an equal number of experiments, and recurs not so frequently to the  thought in transferring the past to the future. Let any one try to  account for this operation of the mind upon any of the received systems  of philosophy, and he will be sensible of the difficulty. For my part, I  shall think it sufficient, if the present hints excite the curiosity of  philosophers, and make them sensible how defective all common theories  are in treating of such curious and such sublime subjects.        SECTION VII.    OF THE IDEA OF NECESSARY CONNEXION.    PART I.      48. The great advantage of the mathematical sciences above the moral  consists in this, that the ideas of the former, being sensible, are  always clear and determinate, the smallest distinction between them is  immediately perceptible, and the same terms are still expressive of the  same ideas, without ambiguity or variation. An oval is never mistaken  for a circle, nor an hyperbola for an ellipsis. The isosceles and  scalenum are distinguished by boundaries more exact than vice and  virtue, right and wrong. If any term be defined in geometry, the mind  readily, of itself, substitutes, on all occasions, the definition for  the term defined: Or even when no definition is employed, the object  itself may be presented to the senses, and by that means be steadily and  clearly apprehended. But the finer sentiments of the mind, the  operations of the understanding, the various agitations of the passions,  though really in themselves distinct, easily escape us, when surveyed by  reflection; nor is it in our power to recal the original object, as  often as we have occasion to contemplate it. Ambiguity, by this means,  is gradually introduced into our reasonings: Similar objects are readily  taken to be the same: And the conclusion becomes at last very wide of  the premises.    One may safely, however, affirm, that, if we consider these sciences in  a proper light, their advantages and disadvantages nearly compensate  each other, and reduce both of them to a state of equality. If the mind,  with greater facility, retains the ideas of geometry clear and  determinate, it must carry on a much longer and more intricate chain of  reasoning, and compare ideas much wider of each other, in order to reach  the abstruser truths of that science. And if moral ideas are apt,  without extreme care, to fall into obscurity and confusion, the  inferences are always much shorter in these disquisitions, and the  intermediate steps, which lead to the conclusion, much fewer than in the  sciences which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9666"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 497, July 11, 1885 (#11)"],[1,", N.Y., obtained a patent for improvement in  phosphorescent substances dated December 30, 1879. The patentee says:  This invention relates to a substance which, by exposure to direct or  indirect sun-light, or to artificial light, is so affected or brought  into such a peculiar condition that it will emit rays of light or become  luminous in the dark.    It is a well-known fact that various bodies and compositions of matter,  more especially compositions containing sulphur in combination with  earthy salts, possess the property of emitting rays of light in the  dark after having been exposed to sun-light. All of these bodies and  compositions of matter are, however, not well adapted for practical  purposes, because the light emitted by them is either too feeble to be  of any practicable utility, or because the luminous condition is not  of sufficient duration, or because the substances are decomposed by  exposure to the atmosphere.    Among the materials which have been employed with the best results  for producing these luminous compositions are sea-shells, especially  oyster-shells. I have found by practical experiments that only the inner  surface of these shells is of considerable value in the production  of luminous compositions, while the body of the shell, although  substantially of the same chemical composition, does not, to any  appreciable extent, aid in producing the desired result. It follows from  this observation that the smallest shells, which contain the largest  surface as compared with their cubic contents, will be best adapted for  this purpose.    I have found that chalk, which is composed of the shells of microscopic  animals, possesses the desired property in the highest degree; and my  invention consists, therefore, of a luminous substance composed of such  chalk, sulphur, and bismuth, as will be hereinafter fully set forth.    In preparing my improved composition I take cleaned or precipitated  chalk, and subject it to the process of calcination in a suitable  crucible over a clear coal or charcoal fire for three or four hours,  or thereabout. I then add to the calcined chalk about one-third of its  weight of sulphur, and heat the mixture for from forty-five to ninety  minutes, or thereabout. A small quantity of bismuth, in the proportion  of about one per cent, or less of the mixture, is added together with  the sulphur.    The metal may be introduced in the metallic form in the shape of  fillings, or in the form of a carbonate, sulphuret, sulphate, or  sulphide, or oxide, as may be most convenient.    The substance produced in this manner possesses the property of emitting  light in the dark in a very high degree. An exposure to light of very  short duration, sometimes but for a moment, will cause the substance  to become luminous and to remain in this luminous condition, under  favorable circumstances, for upward of twenty-four hours.    The intensity of the light emitted by this composition after exposure is  considerable, and largely greater than the light produced by any of the  substances heretofore known.    The hereinbefore described substance may be ground with oil and used  like ordinary paint; or it may be ground with any suitable varnish or be  mixed in the manner of water colors; or it may be employed in any other  suitable and well-known manner in which paints are employed.    My improved luminous substance is adapted for a great variety of  uses--for instance, for painting business and other signs, guide boards,  clock and watch dials, for making the numbers on houses and railway  cars, and for painting all surfaces which are exposed periodically to  direct or indirect light and desired to be easily seen during the night.    When applied with oil or varnish, my improved luminous substance can  be exposed to the weather in the same manner as ordinary paint without  suffering any diminution of its luminous property. I claim as my  invention the herein described luminous substance, consisting of  calcined chalk, sulphur, and bismuth, substantially as set forth.    Merrill B. Sherwood, Jr., of Buffalo, N. Y., obtained a patent for a  phosphorescent composition, dated August 9, 1881.    The author says: My invention relates to an improvement in  phosphorescent illuminants.    I have taken advantage of the peculiar property which obtains in many  bodies of absorbing light during the day and emitting it during the  night time.    The object of my invention is the preparation by a prescribed formula,  to be hereinafter given, of a composition embodying one of the  well-known phosphorescent substances above referred to, which will be  applicable to many practical uses.    With this end in view my invention consists in a phosphorescent  composition in which the chief illuminating element is monosulphide of  calcium.    The composition obtained by the formula may be used either in a powdered  condition by dusting it over articles previously coated, in whole or in  part, with an adhesive substance, or it may be intimately mixed with  paints, inks, or varnishes, serving as vehicles for its application, and  in this way be applied to bodies to render them luminous.    The formula for obtaining the composition is as follows: To one hundred  parts of unslaked lime, that obtained from calcined oyster shells  producing the best results, add five parts of carbonate of magnesia and  five parts of ground silex. Introduce these elements into a graphite or  fire-clay crucible containing forty parts of sulphur and twenty-five  parts of charcoal, raise the whole mass nearly or quite to a white heat,  remove from the fire, allow it to cool slowly, and, when it is cold or  sufficiently lowered in temperature to be conveniently handled,  remove it from the crucible and grind it. The method of reducing the  composition will depend upon the mode of its use. If it is to be applied  as a loose powder by the dusting process, it should be simply ground  dry; but if it is to be mixed with paint or other similar substance,  it should be ground with linseed or other suitable oil. In heating the  elements aforesaid, certain chemical combinations will have taken place,  and monosulphide of calcium, combined with carbonate of lime, magnesia,  and silex, will be the result of such ignition.    If, in the firing of the elements, as above set forth, all of the  charcoal does not unite with the other elements, such uncombined portion  should be removed from the fused mass before it is ground.    If it is designed to mix the composition with paints, those composed of  zinc-white and baryta should be chosen in preference to those composed  of white lead and colored by vegetable matter, as chemical action will  take place between the composition and paint last mentioned, and  its color will be destroyed or changed by the gradual action of the  sulphureted hydrogen produced. However, by the addition of a weak  solution of gum in alcohol or other suitable sizing to the composition,  it may be used with paints containing elements sensitive to sulphureted  hydrogen without danger of decomposing them and destroying their color.    In many, and possibly in a majority of cases, the illuminating  composition applied as a dry powder will give the most satisfactory  results, in view of the tendency to chemical action between the paint  and composition when intimately mixed; in view of the fact that by  the addition to paint of any color of a sufficient quantity of the  composition to render the product luminous, the original color of the  paint will be modified or destroyed; and, also, in view of the fact that  the illuminating composition is so greatly in excess of the paint, the  proportions in which they are united being substantially ten parts  of the former to one of the latter, it will be difficult to impart a  particular color to the product of the union without detracting from  its luminosity. On the other hand, the union of dry powder with a body  already painted by the simple force of adhesion does not establish  a sufficiently intimate relation between it and the paint to cause  chemical action, the application of a light coat of powder does not  materially change the color of the article to which it is applied; and,  further, by the use of the powder in an uncombined state its greatest  illuminating effects are obtained. Again, if the appearance in the  daytime of the article which it is desired to have appear luminous at  night is not material, it may be left unpainted and simply sized to  retain the powder.    In printing it is probable that the composition will be employed almost  exclusively in the form of dry powder, as printing-ink, normally pasty,  becomes too thick to be well handled when it is combined with powder in  sufficient quantity to render the printed surface luminous. However, the  printed surface of a freshly printed sheet may be rendered luminous by  dusting the sheet with powder, which will adhere to all of the inked and  may be easily shaken from the unmoistened surfaces thereof.    I am aware that monosulphide of calcium and magnesia have before  been used together in phosphorescent compounds. What I claim is a  phosphorescent composition consisting of monosulphide of calcium,  combined with carbonate of lime, magnesia, and silex, substantially as  described.    Orlando Thowless, of Newark, N.J., obtained a patent for a process of  manufacturing phosphorescent substances dated November 8, 1881.  The inventor says: The object of my invention is to manufacture  phosphorescent materials of intense luminosity at low cost and little  loss of materials.    I first take clam shells and, after cleaning, place them in a solution  composed of about one part of commercial nitric acid and three parts of  water, in which the shells are allowed to remain about twenty minutes.  The shells are then to be well rinsed in water, placed in a crucible,  and heated to a red heat for about four hours. They are"]]]
