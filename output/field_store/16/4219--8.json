He had the special duty of securing and  administering the royal revenue from vacant benefices. The most  important royal officers were the chamberlains, who took care of  the royal bedchamber and adjoining wardrobe used for dressing and  storage of valuables, and the priests. These royal officers had at  first been responsible only for domestic duties, but gradually  came to assume public administrative tasks.    Edward wanted to avoid the pressures and dangers of living in the  rich and powerful City of London. So he rebuilt a monastic church,  an abbey, and a palace at Westminster about two miles upstream. He  started the growth of Westminster as a center of royal and  political power; kings' councils met there. Royal coronations took  place at the abbey. Since Edward traveled a lot, he established a  storehouse-treasury at Winchester to supplement his traveling  wardrobe. At this time, Spanish stallions were imported to improve  English horses. London came to have the largest and best trained  army in England.    The court invited many of the greatest magnates and prelates  [highest ecclesiastical officials, such as bishops] of the land to  the great ecclesiastical festivals, when the king held more solemn  courts and feasted with his vassals for several days. These  included all the great earls, the majority of bishops, some  abbots, and a number of thegns and clerics. Edward had a witan of  wise men to advise him, but sometimes the King would speak in the  hall after dinner and listen to what comments were made from the  mead-benches. As the court moved about the country, many men came  to pay their respects and attend to local business. Edward started  the practice of King's touching people to cure them of scrofula, a  disease which affected the glands, especially in the head and  neck. It was done in the context of a religious ceremony.    The main governmental activities were: war, collection of revenue,  religious education, and administration of justice. For war, the  shires had to provide a certain number of men and the ports quotas  of ships with crews. The king was the patron of the English  church. He gave the church peace and protection. He presided over  church councils and appointed bishops. As for the administration  of justice, the public courts were almost all under members of  Edward's court, bishops, earls, and reeves. Edward's mind was  often troubled and disturbed by the threat that law and justice  would be overthrown, by the pervasiveness of disputes and discord,  by the raging of wicked presumption, by money interfering with  right and justice, and by avarice kindling all of these. He saw it  as his duty to courageously oppose the wicked by taking good men  as models, by enriching the churches of God, by relieving those  oppressed by wicked judges, and by judging equitably between the  powerful and the humble. He was so greatly revered that a comet  was thought to accompany his death.    The king established the office of the Chancery to draft documents  and keep records. It created the writ, which was a small piece of  parchment [sheep skin] addressed to a royal official or dependent  commanding him to perform some task for the King. By the 1000s A.D.,  the writ contained a seal: a lump of wax with the impress of the  Great Seal of England which hung from the bottom of the document.  Writing was done with a sharpened goose-wing quill. Ink was obtained  from mixing fluid from the galls made by wasps for their eggs on oak  trees, rainwater or vinegar, gum arabic, and iron salts for color.    A King's grant of land entailed two documents: a charter giving  boundaries and conditions and a writ, usually addressed to the  shire court, listing the judicial and financial privileges  conveyed with the land. These were usually sac and soke  [possession of jurisdiction of a private court of a noble or  institution to execute the laws and administer justice over  inhabitants and tenants of the estate], toll [right to have a  market and to collect a payment on the sale of cattle and other  property on the estate] and team [probably the right to hold a  court to determine the honesty of a man accused of illegal  possession of cattle or of buying stolen cattle by inquiring of  the alleged seller or a warrantor, even if an outsider], and  infangenetheof [the authority to hang and take the chattels of a  thief caught on the estate].    The town of Coventry consisted of a large monastery estate and a  large private estate headed by a lord. The monastery was granted  by Edward the Confessor full freedom and these jurisdictions: sac  and soke, toll and team, hamsocne [the authority to fine a person  for breaking into and making entry by force into the dwelling of  another], forestall [the authority to fine a person for robbing  others on the road], bloodwite [the authority to impose a  forfeiture for assault involving bloodshed], fightwite [the  authority to fine for fighting], weordwite [the authority to fine  for manslaughter, but not for willful murder], and mundbryce [the  authority to fine for any breach of the peace, such as trespass on  lands].    Every man was expected to have a lord to whom he gave fealty. He  swore by this fealty oath: \"By the Lord, before whom this relic is  holy, I will be to ------ faithful and true, and love all that he  loves, and shun all that he shuns, according to God's law, and  according to the world's principle, and never, by will nor by  force, by word nor by work, do ought of what is loathful to him;  on condition that he keep me as I am willing to deserve, and all  that fulfill that our agreement was, when I to him submitted and  chose his will.\" If a man was homeless or lordless, his brothers  were expected to find him such, e.g. in the folkmote. Otherwise,  he as to be treated as a fugitive, and could be slain as for a  thief, and anyone who had harbored him would pay a penalty.  Brothers were also expected to protect their minor kinsmen.    Marriages were determined by men asking women to marry them. If a  woman said yes, he paid a sum to her kin for her \"mund\"  [jurisdiction or protection over her] and gave his oath to them to  maintain and support the woman and any children born. As security  for this oath, he gave a valuable object or \"wed\". The couple were  then betrothed. Marriage ceremonies were performed by priests in  churches. The groom had to bring friends to his wedding as  sureties to guarantee his oath to maintain and support his wife  and children. Those who swore to take care of the children were  called their \"godfathers\". The marriage was written into church  records. After witnessing the wedding, friends ate the great loaf,  or first bread made by the bride. This was the forerunner of the  wedding cake. They drank special ale, the \"bride ale\" (from hence  the work \"bridal\"), to the health of the couple.    Women could own land, houses, and furniture and other property.  They could even make wills that disinherited their sons. This  marriage agreement with an Archbishop's sister provides her with  land, money, and horsemen:    \"Here in this document is stated the agreement which Wulfric and  the archbishop made when he obtained the archbishop's sister as  his wife, namely he promised her the estates at Orleton and  Ribbesford for her lifetime, and promised her that he would obtain  the estate at Knightwick for her for three lives from the  community at Winchcombe, and gave her the estate at Alton to grant  and bestow upon whomsoever she pleased during her lifetime or at  her death, as she preferred, and promised her 50 mancuses of gold  and 30 men and 30 horses.    The witnesses that this agreement was made as stated were  Archbishop Wulfstan and Earl Leofwine and Bishop AEthelstan and  Abbot AElfweard and the monk Brihtheah and many good men in  addition to them, both ecclesiastics and laymen. There are two  copies of this agreement, one in the possession of the archbishop  at Worcester and the other in the possession of Bishop AEthelstan  at Hereford.\"    This marriage agreement provided the wife with money, land, farm  animals and farm laborers; it also names sureties, the survivor of  whom would receive all this property:    \"Here is declared in this document the agreement which Godwine  made with Brihtric when he wooed his daughter. In the first place  he gave her a pound's weight of gold, to induce her to accept his  suit, and he granted her the estate at Street with all that  belongs to it, and 150 acres at Burmarsh and in addition 30 oxen  and 20 cows and 10 horses and 10 slaves.    This agreement was made at Kingston before King Cnut, with the  cognizance of Archbishop Lyfing and the community at Christchurch,  and Abbot AElfmaer and the community at St. Augustine's, and the  sheriff AEthelwine and Sired the old and Godwine, Wulfheah's son,  and AElfsige cild and Eadmaer of Burham and Godwine, Wulfstan's  son, and Carl, the King's cniht. And when the maiden was brought  from Brightling AElfgar, Sired's son, and Frerth, the priest of  Forlstone, and the priests Leofwine and Wulfsige from Dover, and  Edred, Eadhelm's son, and Leofwine, Waerhelm's son, and Cenwold  rust and Leofwine, son of Godwine of Horton, and Leofwine the Red  and Godwine, Eadgifu's son, and Leofsunu his brother acted as  security for all this. And whichever of them lives the longer  shall succeed to all the property both in land and everything else  which I have given them. Every trustworthy man in Kent and Sussex,  whether thegn or commoner, is cognizant of these terms.    There are three of these documents; one is at Christchurch,  another at St. Augustine's, and Brihtric himself has the third.\"    Nuns and monks lived in segregated nunneries and monasteries on  church land and grew their own food. The local bishop usually was  also an abbot of a monastery. The priests and nuns wore long robes"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13402"],[0,"The Hindu-Yogi Science of Breath (#12)"],[1,"water, as if you were shaking drops of water off of  your finger tips into the glass. The mental image of the prana being  passed into the water must also be held. Water thus charged is found  stimulating to weak or sick persons, particularly if a healing thought  accompanies the mental image of the transfer of the prana. The caution  given in the last exercise applies also to this one, although the  danger exists only in a greatly lessened degree.    (6) ACQUIRING MENTAL QUALITIES.    Not only can the body be controlled by the mind under direction of the  will, but the mind itself can be trained and cultivated by the  exercise of the controlling will. This, which the Western world knows  as \"Mental Science,\" etc., has proved to the West portions of that  truth which the Yogi has known for ages. The mere calm demand of the  Will will accomplish wonders in this direction, but if the mental  exercise is accompanied by rhythmic breathing, the effect is greatly  increased. Desirable qualities may be acquired by holding the proper  mental image of what is desired during rhythmic breathing. Poise and  Self Control, desirable qualities; increased power, etc., may be  acquired in this way. Undesirable qualities may be eliminated by  cultivating the opposite qualities. Any or all the \"Mental Science\"  exercises, \"treatments\" and \"affirmations\" may be used with the Yogi  Rhythmic Breath. The following is a good general exercise for the  acquirement and development of desirable mental qualities:         Lie in a passive attitude, or sit erect. Picture to yourself       the qualities you desire to cultivate, seeing yourself as       possessed of the qualities, and demanding that your mind       develop the quality. Breathe rhythmically, holding the       mental picture firmly. Carry the mental picture with you as       much as possible, and endeavor to live up to the ideal you       have set up in your mind. You will find yourself gradually       growing up to your ideal. The rhythm of the breathing       assists the mind in forming new combinations, and the       student who has followed the Western system will find the       Yogi Rhythmic a wonderful ally in his \"Mental Science\"       works.    (7) ACQUIRING PHYSICAL QUALITIES.    Physical qualities may be acquired by the same methods as above  mentioned in connection with mental qualities. We do not mean, of  course, that short men can be made tall, or that amputated limbs may  be replaced, or similar miracles. But the expression of the  countenance may be changed; courage and general physical  characteristics improved by the control of the Will, accompanied by  rhythmic breathing. As a man thinks so does he look, act, walk, sit,  etc. Improved thinking will mean improved looks and actions. To  develop any part of the body, direct the attention to it, while  breathing rhythmically, holding the mental picture that you are  sending an increased amount of prana, or nerve force, to the part, and  thus increasing its vitality and developing it. This plan applies  equally well to any part of the body which you wish to develop. Many  Western athletes use a modification of this plan in their exercises.  The student who has followed our instructions so far will readily  understand haw to apply the Yogi principles in the above work. The  general rule of exercise is the same as in the preceding exercise  (acquiring Mental Qualities). We have touched upon the subject of the  cure of physical ailments in preceding pages.      (8) CONTROLLING THE EMOTIONS.    The undesirable emotions, such as Fear, Worry, Anxiety, Hate, Anger,  Jealousy, Envy, Melancholy, Excitement, Grief, etc., are amenable to  the control of the Will, and the Will is enabled to operate more  easily in such cases if rhythmic breathing is practiced while the  student is \"willing.\" The following exercise has been found most  effective by the Yogi students, although the advanced Yogi has but  little need of it, as he has long since gotten rid of these  undesirable mental qualities by growing spiritually beyond them. The  Yogi student, however, finds the exercise a great help to him while he  is growing.    Breathe rhythmically, concentrating the attention upon the Solar  Plexus, and sending to it the mental command \"Get Out.\" Send the  mental command firmly, just as you begin to exhale, and form the  mental picture of the undesirable emotions being carried away with the  exhaled breath. Repeat seven times, and finish with the Cleansing  Breath, and then see how good you feel. The mental command must be  given \"in earnest,\" as trifling will not do the work.    (9) TRANSMUTATION OF THE REPRODUCTIVE ENERGY.    The Yogis possess great knowledge regarding the use and abuse of the  reproductive principle in both sexes. Some hints of this esoteric  knowledge have filtered out and have been used by Western writers on  the subject, and much good has been accomplished in this way. In this  little book we cannot do more than touch upon the subject, and  omitting all except a bare mention of theory, we will give a practical  breathing exercise whereby the student will be enabled to transmute  the reproductive energy into vitality for the entire system, instead  of dissipating and wasting it in lustful indulgences in or out of the  marriage relations. The reproductive energy is creative energy, and  may be taken up by the system and transmuted into strength and  vitality, thus serving the purpose of regeneration instead of  generation. If the young men of the Western world understood these  underlying principles they would be saved much misery and unhappiness  in after years, and would be stronger mentally, morally and  physically.    This transmutation of the reproductive energy gives great vitality to  those practicing it. They will be filled with great vital force, which  will radiate from them and will manifest in what has been called  \"personal magnetism.\" The energy thus transmuted may be turned into  new channels and used to great advantage. Nature has condensed one of  its most powerful manifestations of prana into reproductive energy, as  its purpose is to create. The greatest amount of vital force is  concentrated in the smallest area. The reproductive organism is the  most powerful storage battery in animal life, and its force can be  drawn upward and used, as well as expended in the ordinary functions  of reproduction, or wasted in riotous lust. The majority of our  students know something of the theories of regeneration; and we can do  little more than to state the above facts, without attempting to prove  them.    The Yogi exercise for transmuting reproductive energy is simple. It is  coupled with rhythmic breathing, and can be easily performed. It may  be practiced at any time, but is specially recommended when one feels  the instinct most strongly, at which time the reproductive energy is  manifesting and may be most easily transmuted for regenerative  purposes. The exercise is as follows: Keep the mind fixed on the idea  of Energy, and away from ordinary sexual thoughts or imaginings. If  these thoughts come into the mind do not be discouraged, but regard  them as manifestations of a force which you intend using for the  purposes of strengthening the body and mind. Lie passively or sit  erect, and fix your mind on the idea of drawing the reproductive  energy upward to the Solar Plexus, where it will be transmuted and  stored away as a reserve force of vital energy. Then breathe  rhythmically, forming the mental image of drawing up the reproductive  energy with each inhalation. With each inhalation make a command of  the Will that the energy be drawn upward from the reproductive  organization to the Solar Plexus. If the rhythm is fairly established  and the mental image is clear, you will be conscious of the upward  passage of the energy, and will feel its stimulating effect. If you  desire an increase in mental force, you may draw it up to the brain  instead of to the Solar Plexus, by giving the mental command and  holding the mental image of the transmission to the brain. The man or  woman doing metal creative work, or bodily creative work, will be able  to use this creative energy in their work by following the above  exercise, drawing up the energy with the inhalation and sending it  forth with the exhalation. In this last form of exercise, only such  portions as are needed in the work will pass into the work being done,  the balance remaining stored up in the Solar Plexus. You will  understand, of course, that it is not the reproductive fluids which  are drawn up and used, but the etheripranic energy which animates the  latter, the soul of the reproductive organism, as it were. It is usual  to allow the head to bend forward easily and naturally during the  transmuting exercise.    (10) BRAIN STIMULATING.    The Yogis have found the following exercise most useful in stimulating  the action of the brain for the purpose of producing clear thinking  and reasoning. It has a wonderful effect in clearing the brain and  nervous system, and those engaged in mental work will find it most  useful to them, both in the direction of enabling them to do better  work and also as a means of refreshing the mind and clearing it after  arduous mental labor.    Sit in an erect posture, keeping the spinal column straight, and the  eyes well to the front, letting the hands rest on the upper part of  the legs. Breathe rhythmically, but instead of breathing through both  nostrils as in the ordinary exercises, press the left nostril close  with the thumb, and inhale through the right nostril. Then remove the  thumb, and close the right nostril with the finger, and then exhale  through the left nostril. Then, without changing the fingers, inhale  through the left nostril, and changing fingers, exhale through the  right. Then inhale through right and exhale through left, and so on,  alternating nostrils as above mentioned, closing "]]]
