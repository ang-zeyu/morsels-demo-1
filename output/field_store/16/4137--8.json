Said Regin, \"Dost thou trust them all utterly?\"    Sigurd said, \"It is seemly that they keep it till I may do somewhat  therewith, for better they wot how to guard it than I do.\"    Another time came Regin to talk to Sigurd, and said--    \"A marvellous thing truly that thou must needs be a horse-boy to the  kings, and go about like a running knave.\"    \"Nay,\" said Sigurd, \"it is not so, for in all things I have my will, and  whatso thing I desire is granted me with good will.\"    \"Well, then,\" said Regin, \"ask for a horse of them.\"    \"Yea,\" quoth Sigurd, \"and that shall I have, whenso I have need  thereof.\"    Thereafter Sigurd went to the king, and the king said--    \"What wilt thou have of us?\"    Then said Sigurd, \"I would even a horse of thee for my disport.\"    Then said the king, \"Choose for thyself a horse, and whatso thing else  thou desirest among my matters.\"    So the next day went Sigurd to the wood, and met on the way an old man,  long-bearded, that he knew not, who asked him whither away.    Sigurd said, \"I am minded to choose me a horse; come thou, and counsel  me thereon.\"    \"Well then,\" said he, \"go we and drive them to the river which is called  Busil-tarn.\"    They did so, and drave the horses down into the deeps of the river, and  all swam back to land but one horse; and that horse Sigurd chose for  himself; grey he was of hue, and young of years, great of growth, and  fair to look on, nor had any man yet crossed his back.    Then spake the grey-beard, \"From Sleipnir's kin is this horse come, and  he must be nourished heedfully, for it will be the best of all horses;\"  and therewithal he vanished away.    So Sigurd called the horse Grani, the best of all the horses of the  world; nor was the man he met other than Odin himself.    Now yet again spake Regin to Sigurd, and said--    \"Not enough is thy wealth, and I grieve right sore that thou must needs  run here and there like a churl's son; but I can tell thee where there  is much wealth for the winning, and great name and honour to be won in  the getting of it.\"    Sigurd asked where that might be, and who had watch and ward over it.    Regin answered, \"Fafnir is his name, and but a little way hence he lies,  on the waste of Gnita-heath; and when thou comest there thou mayst well  say that thou hast never seen more gold heaped together in one place,  and that none might desire more treasure, though he were the most  ancient and famed of all kings.\"    \"Young am I,\" says Sigurd, \"yet know I the fashion of this worm, and how  that none durst go against him, so huge and evil is he.\"    Regin said, \"Nay it is not so, the fashion and the growth of him is even  as of other lingworms, (1) and an over great tale men make of it; and  even so would thy forefathers have deemed; but thou, though thou be of  the kin of the Volsungs, shalt scarce have the heart and mind of those,  who are told of as the first in all deeds of fame.\"    Sigurd said, \"Yea, belike I have little of their hardihood and prowess,  but thou hast naught to do, to lay a coward's name upon me, when I  am scarce out of my childish years. Why dost thou egg me on hereto so  busily?\"    Regin said, \"Therein lies a tale which I must needs tell thee.\"    \"Let me hear the same,\" said Sigurd.        ENDNOTES:    (1)  Lingworm--longworm, dragon.        CHAPTER XIV. Regin's tale of his Brothers, and of the Gold called  Andvari's Hoard.    \"The tale begins,\" said Regin. \"Hreidmar was my father's name, a mighty  man and a wealthy: and his first son was named Fafnir, his second Otter,  and I was the third, and the least of them all both for prowess and good  conditions, but I was cunning to work in iron, and silver, and gold,  whereof I could make matters that availed somewhat. Other skill my  brother Otter followed, and had another nature withal, for he was a  great fisher, and above other men herein; in that he had the likeness of  an otter by day, and dwelt ever in the river, and bare fish to bank  in his mouth, and his prey would he ever bring to our father, and that  availed him much: for the most part he kept him in his otter-gear, and  then he would come home, and eat alone, and slumbering, for on the  dry land he might see naught. But Fafnir was by far the greatest and  grimmest, and would have all things about called his.    \"Now,\" says Regin, \"there was a dwarf called Andvari, who ever abode in  that force, (1) which was called Andvari's force, in the likeness of a  pike, and got meat for himself, for many fish there were in the force;  now Otter, my brother, was ever wont to enter into the force, and bring  fish aland, and lay them one by one on the bank. And so it befell that  Odin, Loki, and Hoenir, as they went their ways, came to Andvari's  force, and Otter had taken a salmon, and ate it slumbering upon the  river bank; then Loki took a stone and cast it at Otter, so that he gat  his death thereby; the gods were well content with their prey, and  fell to flaying off the otter's skin; and in the evening they came to  Hreidmar's house, and showed him what they had taken: thereon he laid  hands on them, and doomed them to such ransom, as that they should fill  the otter skin with gold, and cover it over without with red gold; so  they sent Loki to gather gold together for them; he came to Ran, (2)  and got her net, and went therewith to Andvari's force, and cast the net  before the pike, and the pike ran into the net and was taken. Then said  Loki--           \"'What fish of all fishes,         Swims strong in the flood,       But hath learnt little wit to beware?         Thine head must thou buy,         From abiding in hell,       And find me the wan waters flame.'    He answered--           \"'Andvari folk call me,         Call Oinn my father,       Over many a force have I fared;         For a Norn of ill-luck,         This life on me lay       Through wet ways ever to wade.'    \"So Loki beheld the gold of Andvari, and when he had given up the gold,  he had but one ring left, and that also Loki took from him; then  the dwarf went into a hollow of the rocks, and cried out, that that  gold-ring, yea and all the gold withal, should be the bane of every man  who should own it thereafter.    \"Now the gods rode with the treasure to Hreidmar, and fulfilled the  otter-skin, and set it on its feet, and they must cover it over utterly  with gold: but when this was done then Hreidmar came forth, and beheld  yet one of the muzzle hairs, and bade them cover that withal; then Odin  drew the ring, Andvari's loom, from his hand, and covered up the hair  therewith; then sang Loki--           \"'Gold enow, gold enow,         A great weregild, thou hast,       That my head in good hap I may hold;         But thou and thy son         Are naught fated to thrive,       The bane shall it be of you both.'    \"Thereafter,\" says Regin, \"Fafnir slew his father and murdered him, nor  got I aught of the treasure, and so evil he grew, that he fell to lying  abroad, and begrudged any share in the wealth to any man, and so became  the worst of all worms, and ever now lies brooding upon that treasure:  but for me, I went to the king and became his master-smith; and thus is  the tale told of how I lost the heritage of my father, and the weregild  for my brother.\"    So spake Regin; but since that time gold is called Ottergild, and for no  other cause than this.    But Sigurd answered, \"Much hast thou lost, and exceeding evil have thy  kinsmen been! But now, make a sword by thy craft, such a sword as that  none can be made like unto it; so that I may do great deeds therewith,  if my heart avail thereto, and thou wouldst have me slay this mighty  dragon.\"    Regin says, \"Trust me well herein; and with that same sword shalt thou  slay Fafnir.\"        ENDNOTES:    (1)  Waterfall (Ice. \"foss\", \"fors\").

Compare penalty above with that for killing the         Welsh king's cat (\"Ancient Laws and Institutes of Wales\".         Ed., Aneurin Owen. Longman, London, 1841, 2 vols. 8vo).        CHAPTER XV. Of the Welding together of the Shards of the Sword Gram.    So Regin makes a sword, and gives it into Sigurd's hands. He took the  sword, and said--    \"Behold thy smithying, Regin!\" and therewith smote it into the anvil,  and the sword brake; so he cast down the brand, and bade him forge a  better.    Then Regin forged another sword, and brought it to Sigurd, who looked  thereon.    Then said Regin, \"Belike thou art well content therewith, hard master  though thou be in smithying.\"    So Sigurd proved the sword, and brake it even as the first; then he said  to Regin--    \"Ah, art thou, mayhappen, a traitor and a liar like to those former kin  of thine?\"    Therewith he went to his mother, and she welcomed him in seemly wise,  and they talked and drank together.    Then spake Sigurd, \"Have I heard aright, that King Sigmund gave thee the  good sword Gram in two pieces?\"    \"True enough,\" she said.    So Sigurd said, \"Deliver them into my hands, for I would have them.\"    She said he looked like to win great fame, and gave him the sword.  Therewith went Sigurd to Regin, and bade him make a good sword thereof  as he best might; Regin grew wroth thereat, but went into the smithy  with the pieces of the sword, thinking well meanwhile that Sigurd pushed  his head far enow into the matter of smithying. So he made a sword, and  as he bore it forth from the forge, it seemed to the smiths as though  fire burned along the edges thereof. Now he bade Sigurd take the sword,  and said he knew not how to make a sword if this one failed.

This  list would obviously be incomplete, having missed out  some names.    In 1987-88, at the time of the launch of the Gomantak Times,  a number of journalists left hoping for a better work  environment. At that time, when asked for his comment,  Rajan told the Goa Today something to the effect that  the paper he was editor was \"better off after the  opportunistic and mercenary people have left us\" for  jobs elsewhere.    Grabbing an opportunity to to claim our right to reply,  four of us who had just left took the opportunity to  make a point. The anger and irritation felt at that  time comes out in the note then written, to which the  signatories were myself (listing the donkey first, so  as not to deny the fact that one felt strongly about  this then as now), Armenia Fernandes, Valentino  Fernandes, and Francis Ribeiro. It's worth recalling,  to put the issue in context:    \"Since October 1987 (that is, till mid-February 1988),  one chief sub-editor, one sports sub-editor, two  reporters, a cartoonist and a correspondent resigned  from the Herald. Instead of deceiving oneself by  calling these people 'opportunistic and mercenary', it  would be more profitable for Mr Narayan to be honest --  at least to himself -- over why such a number of  journalists resigned from the paper.    May we point out that under Mr Narayan's stewardship  itself, not a single journalist involved in launching  the English-language Herald a little over four years  ago is still with the paper today, except for Mr  Narayan himself.    And, would Mr Narayan care to explain why it is only in  his paper that 'opportunistic and mercenary people'  (including us, by his definition) are found in such  large numbers when it comes to looking for jobs elsewhere?    To us who know, Mr Narayan is hardly convincing when he  says that 'some junior people may have left' but  Herald's 'top is still intact'. It calls for deep  soul-searching on the part of Mr Narayan to find out  why scores of journalists have resigned from the Herald  since October 10, 1983 -- the date which the paper was  launched...    ON THE FLIP side, Rajan -- at least in his early phase  -- had the ability of encouraging his staff. After a  great job done in covering the Commonwealth Retreat,  the reward was not just a good word but also a meal at  the nearby Hotel Aroma. (For the CHOGM, Devika Sequeira  and Lui Godinho sneaked into the area, and anyone would  have thought they were just a couple of Indian  tourists; Perviz teamed up with Rajan himself to chase  the then-admired now-infamous Robert Mugabe to a church  in Chimbel where the once-charismatic leader had gone  to trace his ancestors from an empire that once ruled  central Africa and part of current-day Zimbabwe. S Vaidyanathan,  the former Financial Express chief-sub who's role in  stabilising the Herald desk often goes largely  unmentioned today, did his usual thorough job on the  desk, and we trainees simply joined in the fun with our  prank calls what not.)    Rajan can also be an ideal boss, if he so chooses and  if he trusts your work. Of course, it can also be  difficult to fathom the logic on which this trust is  based, in an editor who has strong, if unexplained,  likes and dislikes. But his you-manage-things attitude  did occasionally help. At one point, we convinced Rajan  that the long and difficult night-shifts of those days  were stressful, and asked for a five-nights, three-day  schedule. This meant that we got two off-days in every  ten days, or six in a month. Rajan's response was  something to the effect that this was fine, provided we  at the news-desk managed things among ourselves and  didn't then make a case for more staff. We did. It  worked. Any desk-man taking off during the crucial  night-shift, made sure to get in a mutual replacement.  In a word, this system probably worked better than  system of policing shifts. The point here is that if he  so chooses, Rajan's style of avoiding micro-controls  could actually make for a workable management strategy.    But this phase seems to have ended nearly exactly one  year after the launch of the English-language Herald,  when the staff got the drift their their editor was  unable or unwilling to take their issues into account,  and almost all jointly formed a union. When Rajan  learnt of this, his reaction was one of a man betrayed.    Part of the problem could have been that Rajan also  perceived the insecurity of his tenure. One got the  feeling that the paper was not being improved beyond a  point, as this could make those at the editorial top dispensable.    Over the next few years, the fetters started coming on.  Rather quickly. To the staff, it was pretty clear who  Rajan's own sacred cows were, even if the editor  posited himself as the paragon of a free press. From  industrial groups lacking their own mouthpiece in  print, to some of the dissidents then harassing the man  whom Rajan got into mutually-arrogant ego-clashes with,  Pratapsing Raoji Rane.    Rajan also had a perchance to hob-nob with politicians.  One of our colleagues always attributes his survival in  journalism to then political bigwig Dr Wilfred de Souza  . How so? Obviously Rajan had flung across a copy to  the sub concerned with a 'Find the mistake in it, or  get sacked' threat. Just that time, Dr W's car pulled  up alongside the newspaper entrance. Rajan was gone,  and so vanished the threat of a loss of the job.    (As anyone who worked on the desk would concede,  finding errors on paper, when under pressure, can be  the most difficult task. Specially if they are your own  errors. Everything looks correct. This writer too has  made the stupidest of errors, notwithstanding the  reputation of being a fairly careful and concerned  desk-person.)    In our early days at the Herald, some of us  college-kids who were blessed with two-wheelers -- even  if we needed two jobs and a loan to manage these --  doubled up as 'pilots' to the seniors. It came as a  shock to one's post-teenage idealism to hear Rajan  argue after being ferried to a lengthy confabulation  with a Congress dissident: \"XYZ is a good politician.  The problem is just that he is so bloody corrupt.\" Or  words to that effect.    If the early freedom was quick to vanish, it didn't  take much time to realise that every new paper goes  through this honeymoon with truth -- extended only as  long as the time required to build up its credibility.  For the CHOGM, Rajan allowed this writer to report on  protests from a citizens' group concerned about the  pouring of crores down the drain in the name of  building infrastructure. If one recalls right, the  figure was around Rs 50 crore (Rs 500 million), a huge  sum by early 'eighties standards. Another issue that  was a concern then was the manner in which the event  was being used as an excuse by luxury hotels to expand  their properties. At this time, Rajan's diktat was  clear: let the criticism go before the event, but once  the CHOGM Retreat starts, no more of it.    Such attitudes, and this was surely not the only case,  meant the stifling of a crucial voice at an important  time of Goan history. Resultantly, the outstation  media, for instance, didn't get a clue that such  questions were at all being asked in Goan society. When  it comes to recording the history of the 'eighties,  there will likewise be many gaps or black holes... and  many could be led into believing that these events  simply didn't occur.    Rajan's role in the Konkani movement would be another  interesting issue for research. Many a Catholic from  Goa, both here and among the diaspora, tends to read  him as being a \"hero for Konkani\". (Dr Teotonio De  Souza, historian, commented on Goanet on September 18,  2003: \"I have known Rajan Narayan while still in Goa  and admired his contribution to the Konkani cause.\")    But the issue is more complex. Needless to say, Goa's  media adopts a dog-does-not-eat-dog approach, and for  most of the time avoids criticising each other. Rajan's  role in the language agitation is yet to be adequately  evaluated. The Week magazine, in an article written by  the journalist Ashok Row Kavi (who went on to become a  prominent gay activist, but that's not particularly  relevant here) did a critical piece on the role played  by Rajan and the other Narayan, Athawale:    It's titled 'The two Narayans' and says:    THE three worlds in Hindu mythology always shuddered  when the chant 'Narayan, Narayan' echoed in the cosmos.  It meant that Narada, the roving rishi, was making his  petty-fogging presence felt.    Goa has two Narayans and there is internal trouble  there. One is Narayan Athavle, editor of the Marathi  daily Gomantak, and the other Rajan Narayan, editor of  O Herald an English daily from Panaji. They are  fighting each other claiming that they are fighting for  two languages, Marathi and Konkani.    Their credentials can be questioned, though no one  bothers to do that. Athavle is an outsider: a  Maharashtrian Chitpawan Brahmin; Rajan Narayan is from  South India and is fighting for Konkani in English.    Athavle's editorials are pure petrol on Goa's red hot  embers. Starting with Ooth Marathe Ooth (Wake up  Marathas, wake up), Athavle, who supports Rane, has  carried on a relentless battle to show that Konkani is  a 'boli' (dialect"]]]
