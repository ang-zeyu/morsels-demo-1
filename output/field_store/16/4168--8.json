Take a dozen fine Jerusalem artichokes, boil till tender, let the  water strain off, and when cold cut them in quarters, and pour over  a fine salad mixture; the artichokes should lay in the sauce half an  hour before serving. This salad is a very refreshing one, and has the  advantage of being extremely wholesome.           *       *       *       *       *    A SPRING DISH.    Take one quart of young peas, a little mint, a few lumps of sugar, a  little salt and white pepper, simmer them gently in one pint of water,  when the peas are half done, throw in small dumplings made of paste,  as if for short crust, and sweetened with a little brown sugar, beat  up two eggs, and drop in a spoonful at a time, just before serving;  it will require a deep dish, as the liquor is not to be strained off.  Some prefer the eggs poached.           *       *       *       *       *    CARROTS AU BEURRE.    Boil them enough to be perfectly tender, then cut them in quarters,  and again in lengths of three inches, drain them from the water, and  put to them a piece of butter, salt and pepper, and simmer them for a  few minutes without boiling; a large piece of butter must be used.    French beans are good dressed in the same way.           *       *       *       *       *    PUREE OF VEGETABLES.    Take any vegetable that may be approved, boil till well done, drain  away all water, reduce the vegetable to a pulp, and add to it any fine  sauce, to make it of the consistency of a very thick custard.           *       *       *       *       *    JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES FRIED.    Cut in slices after parboiling them, dip in batter, and fry.           *       *       *       *       *    STEWED RED CABBAGE.    Clean and remove the outer leaves, slice it as thinly as possible, put  it in a saucepan with a large piece of butter, and a tea cup full of  water, salt and pepper; let it stew slowly till very tender.           *       *       *       *       *    MUSHROOMS AU NATUREL.    Clean some fine fresh mushrooms, put them in a saucepan with a large  piece of butter, pepper and salt; let them simmer until tender, and  serve them with no other sauce than that in which they have been  dressed. Also stewed in a veal gravy, and served with white sauce on a  toast, they form a nice and pretty dish.    The large flap mushrooms may be stewed in gravy, or simply broiled,  seasoned with cayenne pepper, salt, and lemon juice.           *       *       *       *       *    DRY TOMATO SOUP.    Brown a couple of onions in a little oil, about two table-spoonsful  or more, according to the number of tomatos; when hot, add about six  tomatos cut and peeled, season with cayenne pepper and salt, and let  the whole simmer for a short time, then cut thin slices of bread, and  put as much with the tomatos as will bring them to the consistency  of a pudding; it must be well beaten up, stir in the yolks of two or  three eggs, and two ounces of butter warmed; turn the whole into a  deep dish and bake it very brown. Crumbs of bread should be strewed  over the top, and a little warmed butter poured over.           *       *       *       *       *    DEVILLED BISCUITS.    Butter some biscuits on both sides, and pepper them well, make a paste  of either chopped anchovies, or fine cheese, and spread it on the  biscuit, with mustard and cayenne pepper, and grill them.           *       *       *       *       *    SAVOURY EGGS.    Boil some eggs hard, put them into cold water, cut them into halves,  take out the yolks, beat them up in a mortar with grated hung beef,  fill the halves with this mixture, fry lightly, and serve with brown  gravy.           *       *       *       *       *    SAVOURY CHEESE CAKES.    Grate finely an equal quantity of stale bread and good cheese, season  with a little pepper and salt, mix into a batter with eggs, form into  thin cakes and fry.           *       *       *       *       *    SCALLOPED EGGS.    Poach lightly three or four eggs, place them in a dish, pour upon them  a little warm butter; sprinkle with pepper, salt, and nutmeg, strew  over with crumbs of bread, and brown before the fire.           *       *       *       *       *    MACCARONI AND CHEESE.    Boil some maccaroni in milk or water until tender, then drain them and  place on a dish with bits of butter and grated Parmesan cheese; when  the dish is filled grate more cheese over it and brown before the  fire.           *       *       *       *       *    A FINE RECEIPT FOR A SAVOURY OMELETTE.    Break four eggs, beat them up till thin enough to pass through a  hair sieve, then beat them up till perfectly smooth and thin; a small  omelette frying-pan is necessary for cooking it well. Dissolve in it  a piece of butter, about an ounce and a half, pour in the egg, and as  soon as it rises and is firm, slide it on to a warm plate and fold  it over; it should only be fried on one side, and finely minced herbs  should be sprinkled over the unfried side with pepper and salt. A  salamander is frequently held over the unfried side of the omelette to  take off the rawness it may otherwise have.           *       *       *       *       *    CHORISA OMELETTE.    Add to the eggs, after they are well beaten as directed in the last  receipt, half a tea-cup full of finely minced _chorisa_; this omelette  must be lightly fried on both sides, or the salamander held over long  enough to dress the _chorisa_.           *       *       *       *       *    RAMAKINS.    Mix together three eggs, one ounce of warmed butter, and two of fine  cheese grated, and bake in small patty pans.           *       *       *       *       *    RISSOLES.    Make a fine forcemeat of any cold meat, poultry, or fish, enclose it  in a very rich puff paste, rolled out extremely thin. They may be made  into balls or small triangular turnovers, or into long narrow ribbons;  the edges must be pressed together, that they may not burst in frying.  They form a pretty dish.           *       *       *       *       *    CROQUETTES.    Pound any cold poultry, meat, or fish, make it into a delicate  forcemeat; the flavor can be varied according to taste; minced  mushrooms, herbs, parsley, grated lemon peel, are suitable for poultry  and veal; minced anchovies should be used instead of mushrooms when  the croquettes are made of fish. Form the mixture into balls or oval  shapes the size of small eggs; dip them into beaten eggs, thickly  sprinkle with bread crumbs or pounded vermicelli, and fry of a  handsome brown.           *       *       *       *       *    CASSEROLE AU RIZ.    Boil some rice till quite tender, make it into a firm paste with one  egg and a couple of tablespoons of strong gravy; then line the inside  of a mould with the paste of sufficient thickness to turn out without  breaking. Some cooks fill the mould instead of lining it only, and  scoop away the centre. After it is turned out the rice must stand till  cold, before it is removed from the mould; then fill the rice with  friccassee of fowl and sweetbread, with a rich white sauce, and place  it in the oven to become hot and brown. The mould used for a casserole  is oval and fluted, and resembles a cake mould. It is as well to  observe, it cannot be made in a jelly mould.           *       *       *       *       *    A FONDU.    Make into a batter one ounce and a half of potatoe flour, with the  same quantity of grated cheese and of butter, and a quarter of a  pint of milk or cream; add a little salt, very little pepper, and the  well-beaten yolks of four fine fresh eggs; when all this is well mixed  together, pour in the whites of the eggs, well whisked to a froth;  pour the mixture into a deep soup plate or dish, used expressly for  the purpose, and bake in a moderate oven. The dish should be only half  filled with the _fondu_, as it will rise very high. It must be served  the moment it is ready, or it will fall. It is a good plan to hold a  salamander over it while being brought to table.           *       *       *       *       *    PETITS FONDEAUS.    Make a batter as for a fondu, but use rice flour or arrow root instead  of potatoe flour; add the egg in the same manner as for a fondu, and  pour the mixture into small paper trays fringed round the top. The  mixture should only half fill the trays or cases.          CHAPTER VI.      Pastry.    DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING PASTE.    To make good light paste requires much practice; as it is not only  from the proportions, but from the manner of mixing the various  ingredients, that paste acquires its good or bad qualities.    Paste should be worked up very lightly, and no strength or pressure  used; it should be rolled out _from you_, as lightly as possible. A  marble slab is better than a board to make paste on.    The flour should be dried for some time before the fire previously to  being used. In forming it into paste it should be wetted as little as  possible, to prevent its being tough. It is a great mistake to imagine  _lard_ is better adapted for pastry than butter or clarified fat; it  may make the paste lighter, but neither the color nor the flavor will  be nearly so good, and the saving is extremely trifling.    To ensure lightness, paste should be set in the oven directly it is  made.    Puff paste requires a brisk oven.    Butter should be added to the paste in small pieces.    The more times the paste is folded and rolled, if done with a light  hand and the butter added with skill, the richer and lighter it will  prove. It is no longer customary to line the dish for pies and fruit  tarts.           *       *       *       *       *    PLAIN PUFF PASTE.    Mix a pound of flour into a stiff paste with a little water, first  having rubbed into it about two ounces of butter, then roll it out;  add by degrees the remainder of the butter (there should be altogether  half a pound of butter), fold the paste and roll about two or three  times.           *       *"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1233"],[0,"The Origin and Nature of the Emotions; Miscellaneous Papers (#12)"],[1,"  the painless exanthemata and the painful pyogenic infections is that  in the case of the exanthemata the protective response of the body  is a chemical one,--the formation of antibodies in the blood,  which usually produce permanent immunity,--while the response to the  pyogenic infections is largely phagocytic.  In the pyogenic infections,  in order to protect the remainder of the body, which, of course,  enjoys no immunity, every possible barrier against the spread  of the infection is thrown about the local point of infection.  How are these barriers formed?  First, lymph is poured out, then the part  is fixed by the continuous contraction of the neighboring muscles  and by the inhibition of those muscles that, in the course of their  ordinary function, would by their contractions spread the infection.  Wherever there is protective muscular rigidity there is also pain.  On the other hand, in pyogenic infections in the substance  of the liver, in the substance of the kidney, within the brain,  in the retroperitoneal space, in the lobes of the lung, in the chambers  of the heart and in the blood-vessels of the chest and the abdomen,  in all locations in which muscular contractions can in no way assist  in localizing the disease, pyogenic infections produce no muscular  rigidity and no pain.  Apparently, therefore, only those infections are  painful which are associated with a protective muscular contraction.  This explains why tuberculosis of the hip is painful, while tuberculosis  of the lung is painless.    There is a third type of pain which modifies muscular action  in a curious way.  We have already stated that local pain serves  an adaptive purpose.  In this light let us now consider headache.  Headache is one of the commonest initiatory symptoms of the  various infections, especially of those infections which are  accompanied by no local pain and by no local muscular action.  In peritonitis, cholecystitis, pleurisy, arthritis, appendicitis,  salpingitis, child-birth, in obstructions of the intestinal  and the genito-urinary tract, in short, in those acute processes  in which the local symptoms are powerful enough to govern  the individual as a whole,--to make him lie down and keep quiet,  refuse food and possibly reject what is already in the stomach,--  in all these conditions there is rarely a headache, but in the diseases  in which local pain is absent, such as the exanthemata, typhoid fever,  and auto-intoxication, which have no dominating local disturbances  to act as policemen to put the individual to bed and to make him  refuse food that he may be in the most favorable position to combat  the oncoming disease, in such cases in which these masterful and  beneficent local influences are absent we postulate that headache  has been evolved to perform this important service.    On the hypothesis that it is good for the individual who is acutely  stricken by a disease or who is poisoned by autointoxication to rest  and fast, and that the muscular system obeys the imperial command  of pain, and in view of the fact that the brain is not only in constant  touch with the conditions of every part of the body but that it  is also the controlling organ of the body, one would expect that in  these diseases the major pain whose purpose it is to govern general  muscular action would be located in the head and there we find it.  How curious and yet how intelligible is the fact that, though a  headache may be induced by even a slight auto-intoxication,  an abscess may exist within the brain without causing pain.  When an obliterative endarteritis is threatening a leg with  anemic gangrene, or when one lies too long in the same position on  a hard bed, there is threatening injury from local anemia, and as a  result there is acute pain, but when the obliterative endarteritis  threatens anemia of the brain, or when an embolism or thrombosis has  produced anemia of the brain, there may be no accompanying pain.  The probable explanation of the pain which results in the first instance  and the lack of pain in the second is that in the former muscular action  constitutes a self-protective response, but in the other it does not.  Diseases and injuries of the brain are notoriously difficult  to diagnosticate.  This may well be because it has always been so well  protected by the skull that there have been evolved within it few  tell-tale self-protective responses, so that in the presence of injury  and disease within itself the brain remains remarkably silent.  It should occasion no surprise that there are in the brain no receptors,  the mechanical stimulation of which can cause pain, because its bony  covering has always prevented the adaptive implantation within it  of contact pain receptors.  Dr. Frazier tells me that in the course  of his operations on the brains of unanesthetized patients  he is able to explore the entire brain freely and without pain.  From my own experience I am able to confirm Dr. Frazier's observation.  In addition, the two-stage operation for the excision of the Gasserian  ganglion provides an observation of extraordinary interest.  If at the first seance the ganglion is exposed, but is not disturbed  except by the iodoform gauze packing, then on the following  day the gauze may be removed, the ganglion picked up, and its  branches and root excised without anesthesia and without pain.  The same statement and explanation may be made regarding the distribution  of pain receptors for physical contact within the parenchyma of the liver,  the gall-bladder, the abdominal viscera, the spleen, the heart,  the lungs, the retroperitoneal tissue, the deep tissue of the back,  the vertebrae, and in certain portions of the spinal cord.  Just what is the distribution of the receptors for heat and for cold  I am unable to state, but this much we do know, that without  anesthesia the intestines may be cauterized freely without the least  pain resulting, and in animals the cauterization of the brain causes  no demonstrable change in the circulatory or respiratory reactions.  It is probable therefore that the distribution of the pain receptors  for physical contact and for heat are limited to those parts of the body  that have been exposed to injurious contacts with environment.    Of special significance is the pain which is due to cold,  which increases muscular tone and produces shivering.  The general  increase in muscular tone produces an interesting postural phenomenon:  the limbs are flexed and the body bent forward, a position which probably  is due to the fact that the flexors are stronger than the extensors.  As muscular action is always accompanied by heat production,  the purpose of the muscular contraction and the shivering  is quite certainly caused by cold to assist in the maintenance  of the normal body temperature.    We have now discussed many of the causes of pain and in each instance  we have found an associated muscular action which apparently  serves some adaptive purpose (Figs. 24 and 25). If we assume  that pain exists for the purpose of stimulating muscular reactions,  we may well inquire what part of the nervous are is the site of  the sensation of pain--the nerve-endings, the trunk, or the brain?  Does pain result from physical contact with the nerve-endings, with  the physical act of transmitting an impression along the nerve trunk,  or with the process within the brain-cells by which energy is released  to cause a motor act?    It seems most probable that the site of the pain is in the brain-cells.  If this be so, then what is the physical process by which the  phenomena of pain are produced?  The one hypothesis that can be  tested experimentally is that pain is a phenomenon resulting from  the rapid discharge of energy in the brain-cells. If this be true,  then if every pain receptor of the body were equally stimulated  in such a manner that      {illust. caption = FIG.  25.--FEAR AND AGONY.  \"Amid this dread  exuberance of woe ran naked spirits wing'd with horrid fear.\"--  Dante's \"Inferno,\" Canto XXIV, lines 89, 90.  all the stimuli  reached the brain-cells simultaneously, the cells would find  themselves in equilibrium and no motor act would be performed.  But if all the pain receptors of the body but one were equally stimulated,  and this one stimu-lated harder than the rest, then the latter  would gain possession of the final common path, the sensation  of pain would be felt, and a muscular contraction would result.  It is well known that when a greater pain is thrown into  competition with a lesser one, the lesser is completely submerged.  In this manner the school-boy initiates the novice into the mystery  of the painless plucking of hair.  The simultaneous, but severe  application of the boot to the blindfolded victim takes complete  and exclusive possession of the final common path and the hair  is painlessly plucked through the triumph of the boot stimulus over  the hair stimulus in the struggle for the possession of the final  common path.  Another argument in favor of this hypothesis that  pain is an accompaniment of the release of energy in the brain-  cells is found in the fact that painless stimuli received through  the special senses may completely submerge the painful stimuli  of physical injury; for although the stimuli to motor action,  which are received through the senses of sight, hearing, and smell,  cause even more powerful motor action than those caused by  physical contact stimuli, yet they are not accompanied by pain.  Examples of this triumph of stimulation of the special senses over  contact stimulation are frequently seen in persons obsessed by anger  or fear, and to a less degree in those obsessed by sexual emotion.  In the fury of battle the soldier may not perceive his wound until  the emotional excitation is wearing away, when the sensation  of warm blood on the skin may first attract his attention.  Religious fanatics are said to feel no pain"]]]
