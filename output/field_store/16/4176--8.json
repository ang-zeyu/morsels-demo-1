After I had drunk my coffee, dressed myself, read the inscriptions upon  the window-panes, and settled my bill at the inn, I left Osterode.    This town contains a certain quantity of houses and a given number of  inhabitants, among whom are divers and sundry souls, as may be  ascertained in detail from Gottschalk's \"Pocket Guide-Book for Harz  Travelers.\" Ere I struck into the highway, I ascended the ruins of the  very ancient Osteroder Burg. They consisted merely of the half of a  great, thick-walled tower, which appeared to be fairly honeycombed by  time. The road to Clausthal led me again uphill, and from one of the  first eminences I looked back once more into the dale where Osterode  with its red roofs peeps out from among the green fir-woods, like a  moss-rose from amid its leaves. The sun cast a pleasant, tender light  over the whole scene. From this spot the imposing rear of the remaining  portion of the tower may be seen to advantage.    There are many other ruined castles in this vicinity. That of  Hardenberg, near Noerten, is the most beautiful. Even when one has, as he  should, his heart on the left--that is, the liberal side--he cannot  banish all melancholy feeling on beholding the rocky nests of those  privileged birds of prey, who left to their effete descendants only  their fierce appetites. So it happened to me this morning. My heart  thawed gradually as I departed from Goettingen; I again became romantic,  and as I went on I made up this poem:      Rise again, ye dreams forgotten;      Heart-gate, open to the sun!    Joys of song and tears of sorrow      Sweetly strange from thee shall run.      I will rove the fir-tree forest,      Where the merry fountain springs,    Where the free, proud stags are wandering,      Where the thrush, my darling, sings.      I will climb upon the mountains,      On the steep and rocky height,    Where the gray old castle ruins      Stand in rosy morning light.      I will sit awhile reflecting      On the times long passed away,    Races which of old were famous,      Glories sunk in deep decay.      Grows the grass upon the tilt-yard,      Where the all-victorious knight    Overcame the strongest champions,      Won the guerdon of the fight.      O'er the balcony twines ivy,      Where the fairest gave the prize,    Him who all the rest had vanquished      Overcoming with her eyes.      Both the victors, knight and lady,      Fell long since by Death's cold hand;    So the gray and withered scytheman      Lays the mightiest in the sand.    After proceeding a little distance, I met with a traveling journeyman  who came from Brunswick, and who related to me that it was generally  believed in that city that their young Duke had been taken prisoner by  the Turks during his tour in the Holy Land, and could be ransomed only  by an enormous sum. The extensive travels of the Duke probably  originated this tale. The people at large still preserve that  traditional fable-loving train of ideas which is so pleasantly shown in  their \"Duke Ernest.\" The narrator of this news was a tailor, a neat  little youth, but so thin that the stars might have shone through him as  through Ossian's misty ghosts. Altogether, he was made up of that  eccentric mixture of humor and melancholy peculiar to the German people.  This was especially expressed in the droll and affecting manner in which  he sang that extraordinary popular ballad, \"A beetle sat upon the hedge,  _summ, summ!_\" There is one fine thing about us Germans--no one is so  crazy but that he may find a crazier comrade who will understand him.  Only a German _can_ appreciate that song, and in the same breath laugh  and cry himself to death over it. On this occasion I also remarked the  depth to which the words of Goethe have penetrated the national life. My  lean comrade trilled occasionally as he went along--\"Joyful and  sorrowful, thoughts are free!\" Such a corruption of text is usual among  the multitude. He also sang a song in which \"Lottie by the grave of  Werther\" wept. The tailor ran over with sentimentalism in the words--      \"Sadly by the rose-beds now I weep,    Where the late moon found us oft alone!    Moaning where the silver fountains sleep,    Once which whispered joy in every tone.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The hills here became steeper, the fir-woods below were like a green  sea, and white clouds above sailed along over the blue sky. The wildness  of the region was, as it were, tamed by its uniformity and the  simplicity of its elements. Nature, like a true poet, abhors abrupt  transitions. Clouds, however fantastically formed they may at times  appear, still have a white, or at least a subdued hue, harmoniously  corresponding with the blue heaven and the green earth; so that all the  colors of a landscape blend into one another like soft music, and every  glance at such a natural picture tranquilizes and reassures the soul.  The late Hofmann would have painted the clouds spotted and chequered.  And, like a great poet, Nature knows how to produce the greatest  effects with the most limited means. She has, after all, only a sun,  trees, flowers, water, and love to work with. Of course, if the latter  be lacking in the heart of the observer, the whole will, in all  probability, present but a poor appearance; the sun is then only so many  miles in diameter, the trees are good for firewood, the flowers are  classified according to their stamens, and the water is wet.    A little boy who was gathering brushwood in the forest for his sick  uncle pointed out to me the village of Lerrbach, whose little huts with  gray roofs lie scattered along for over a mile through the valley.  \"There,\" said he, \"live idiots with goitres, and white negroes.\" By  white negroes the people mean \"albinos.\" The little fellow lived on  terms of peculiar understanding with the trees, addressing them like old  acquaintances, while they in turn seemed by their waving and rustling to  return his salutations. He chirped like a thistle-finch; many birds  around answered his call, and, ere I was aware, he had disappeared amid  the thickets with his little bare feet and his bundle of brush.  \"Children,\" thought I, \"are younger than we; they can remember when they  were once trees or birds, and are consequently still able to understand  them. We of larger growth are, alas, too old for that, and carry about  in our heads too many sorrows and bad verses and too much legal lore.\"  But the time when it was otherwise recurred vividly to me as I entered  Clausthal. In this pretty little mountain town, which the traveler does  not behold until he stands directly before it, I arrived just as the  clock was striking twelve and the children came tumbling merrily out of  school. The little rogues, nearly all red-cheeked, blue-eyed,  flaxen-haired, sprang and shouted and awoke in me melancholy and  cheerful memories--how I once myself, as a little boy, sat all the  forenoon long in a gloomy Catholic cloister school in Duesseldorf,  without so much as daring to stand up, enduring meanwhile a terrible  amount of Latin, whipping, and geography, and how I too hurrahed and  rejoiced, beyond all measure when the old Franciscan clock at last  struck twelve. The children saw by my knapsack that I was a stranger,  and greeted me in the most hospitable manner. One of the boys told me  that they had just had a lesson in religion, and showed me the Royal  Hanoverian Catechism, from which they were questioned on Christianity.  This little book was very badly printed, so that I greatly feared that  the doctrines of faith made thereby but an unpleasant blotting-paper  sort of impression upon the children's minds. I was also shocked at  observing that the multiplication table--which surely seriously  contradicts the Holy Trinity--was printed on the last page of the  catechism, as it at once occurred to me that by this means the minds of  the children might, even in their earliest years, be led to the most  sinful skepticism. We Prussians are more intelligent, and, in our zeal  for converting those heathen who are familiar with arithmetic, take good  care not to print the multiplication table in the back of the catechism.    I dined at The Crown, at Clausthal. My repast consisted of spring-green  parsley-soup, violet-blue cabbage, a pile of roast veal, which resembled  Chimborazo in miniature, and a sort of smoked herring, called  \"Bueckings,\" from the inventor, William Buecking, who died in 1447, and  who, on account of the invention, was so greatly honored by Charles V.  that the great monarch in 1556 made a journey from Middleburg to  Bievlied in Zealand for the express purpose of visiting the grave of the  great man. How exquisitely such dishes taste when we are familiar with  their historical associations!           *       *       *       *       *    In the silver refinery, as has so frequently happened in life, I could  get no glimpse of the precious metal. In the mint I succeeded better,  and saw how money was made. Beyond this I have never been able to  advance. On such occasions mine has invariably been the spectator's  part, and I verily believe that, if it should rain dollars from heaven,  the coins would only knock holes in my head, while the children of  Israel would merrily gather up the silver manna. With feelings in which  comic reverence was blended with emotion, I beheld the new-born shining  dollars, took one in my hand as it came fresh from the stamp, and said  to it, \"Young Dollar, what a destiny awaits thee! What a cause wilt thou  be of good and of evil! How thou wilt protect vice and patch up virtue!  How thou wilt be beloved and accursed! How thou wilt aid in debauchery,  pandering, lying, and murdering! How thou wilt restlessly roll along  through clean and dirty hands for centuries, until finally, laden with  tresspasses "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12519"],[0,"The Virginia Housewife; Or, Methodical Cook (#12)"],[1,"fine, nutmeg, pepper, and salt to your taste; mix it  lightly with three eggs, stuff the craw with it, spit it, and lay it  down a good distance from the fire, which should be clear and brisk;  dust and baste it several times with cold lard; it makes the froth  stronger than basting it with the hot out of the dripping pan, and makes  the turkey rise better; when it is enough, froth it up as before, dish  it, and pour on the same gravy as for the boiled turkey, or bread sauce;  garnish with lemon and pickles, and serve it up; if it be of a middle  size, it will require one hour and a quarter to roast.           *       *       *       *       *    TO MAKE SAUCE FOR A TURKEY.    Cut the crumb of a loaf of bread in thin slices, and put it in cold  water with a few pepper corns, a little salt and onion--then boil it  till the bread is quite soft, beat it well, put in a quarter of a pound  of butter, two spoonsful of thick cream, and put it in the dish with the  turkey.           *       *       *       *       *    TO BOIL FOWLS.    Dust the fowls well with flour, put them in a kettle of cold water,  cover it close, set it on the fire; when the scum begins to rise, take  it off, let them boil very slowly for twenty minutes, then take them  off, cover them close, and the heat of the water will stew them enough  in half an hour; it keeps the skin whole, and they will be both whiter  and plumper than if they had boiled fast; when you take them up, drain  them, and pour over them white sauce or melted butter.           *       *       *       *       *    TO MAKE WHITE SAUCE FOR FOWLS.    Take a scrag of veal, the necks of fowls, or any bits of mutton or veal  you have; put them in a sauce pan with a blade or two of mace, a few  black pepper corns, one anchovy, a head of celery, a bunch of sweet  herbs, a slice of the end of a lemon; put in a quart of water, cover it  close, let it boil till it is reduced to half a pint, strain it, and  thicken it with a quarter of a pound of butter mixed with flour, boil it  five or six minutes, put in two spoonsful of pickled mushrooms, mix the  yelks of two eggs with a tea cup full of good cream and a little  nutmeg--put it in the sauce, keep shaking it over the fire, but don't  let it boil.           *       *       *       *       *    FRICASSEE OF SMALL CHICKENS.    Take off the legs and wings of four chickens, separate the breasts from  the backs, cut off the necks and divide the backs across, clean the  gizzards nicely, put them with the livers and other parts of the  chicken, after being washed clean, into a sauce pan, add pepper, salt,  and a little mace, cover them with water, and stew them till  tender--then take them out, thicken half a pint of the water with two  table spoonsful of flour rubbed into four ounces of butter, add half a  pint of new milk, boil all together a few minutes, then add a gill of  white wine, stirring it in carefully that it may not curdle; put the  chickens in, and continue to shake the pan until they are sufficiently  hot, and serve them up.           *       *       *       *       *    TO ROAST LARGE FOWLS.    Take the fowls when they are ready dressed, put them down to a good  fire, dredge and baste them well with lard; they will be near an hour in  roasting; make a gravy of the necks and gizzards, strain it, put in a  spoonful of brown flour; when you dish them, pour on the gravy, and  serve them up with egg sauce in a boat.           *       *       *       *       *    TO MAKE EGG SAUCE.    Boil four eggs for ten minutes, chop half the whites, put them with the  yelks, and chop them both together, but not very fine; put them into a  quarter of a pound of good melted butter, and put it in a boat.           *       *       *       *       *    TO BOIL YOUNG CHICKENS.    Put the chickens in scalding water; as soon as the feathers will slip  off, take them out, or it will make the skin hard and break: when you  have drawn them, lay them in skimmed milk for two hours, then truss and  dust them well with flour, put them in cold water, cover them close, set  them over a very slow fire, take off the scum, let them boil slowly for  five or six minutes, take them off the fire, keep them closely covered  in the water for half an hour, it will stew them enough; when you are  going to dish them, set them over the fire to make them hot, drain them,  and pour over white sauce made the same way as for the boiled fowls.           *       *       *       *       *    TO ROAST YOUNG CHICKENS.    When you kill young chickens, pluck them very carefully, truss and put  them down to a good fire, dredge and baste them with lard; they will  take a quarter of an hour in roasting; froth them up, lay them on the  dish, pour butter and parsley on, and serve them up hot.           *       *       *       *       *    FRIED CHICKENS.    Cut them up as for the fricassee, dredge them well with flour, sprinkle  them with salt, put them into a good quantity of boiling lard, and fry  them a light brown; fry small pieces of mush and a quantity of parsley  nicely picked, to be served in the dish with the chickens; take half a  pint of rich milk, add to it a small bit of butter, with pepper, salt,  and chopped parsley; stew it a little, and pour it over the chickens,  and then garnish with the fried parsley.           *       *       *       *       *    TO ROAST WOODCOCKS OR SNIPES.    Pluck, but do not draw them, put them on a small spit, dredge and baste  them well with lard, toast a few slices of bread, put them on a clean  plate, and set it under the birds while they are roasting; if the fire  be good, they will take about ten minutes; when you take them from the  spit, lay them upon the toasts on the dish, pour melted butter round  them, and serve them up.           *       *       *       *       *    TO ROAST WILD DUCKS OR TEAL.    When the ducks are ready dressed, put in them a small onion, pepper,  salt, and a spoonful of red wine; if the fire be good, they will roast  in twenty minutes; make gravy of the necks and gizzards, a spoonful of  red wine, half an anchovy, a blade or two of mace, one onion, and a  little cayenne pepper; boil it till it is wasted to half a pint, strain  it through a hair sieve, and pour it on the ducks--serve them up with  onion sauce in a boat; garnish the dish with raspings of bread.           *       *       *       *       *    TO BOIL PIGEONS.    Scald the pigeons, draw them, take the craw out, wash them in several  waters, cut off the pinions, turn the legs under the wings, dredge them,  and put them in soft cold water; boil them slowly a quarter of an hour,  dish them up, pour over them good melted butter, lay round a little  brocoli in bunches, and send butter and parsley in a boat.           *       *       *       *       *    TO ROAST PIGEONS.    When you have dressed your pigeons as before, roll a good lump of butter  in chopped parsley, with pepper and salt, put it in your pigeons, spit,  dust and baste them; if the fire be good, they will roast in twenty  minutes; when they are through, lay round them bunches of asparagus,  with parsley and butter for sauce.           *       *       *       *       *    TO ROAST PARTRIDGES OR ANY SMALL BIRDS.    Lard them with slips of bacon, put them on a skewer, tie it to the spit  at both ends, dredge and baste them, let them roast ten minutes, take  the grated crumb of half a loaf of bread, with a piece of butter, the  size of a walnut, put it in a stew pan, and shake it over a gentle fire  till it is of a light brown, lay it between your birds, and pour over  them a little melted butter.           *       *       *       *       *    TO BROIL RABBITS.    When you have cased the rabbits, skewer them with their heads straight  up, the fore-legs brought down, and the hind-legs straight; boil them  three quarters of an hour at least, then smother them with onion sauce,  made the same as for boiled ducks, and serve them up.           *       *       *       *       *    TO ROAST RABBITS.    When you have cased the rabbits, skewer their heads with their mouths  upon their backs, stick their fore-legs into their ribs, skewer the  hind-legs doubled, then make a pudding for them of the crumb of half a  loaf of bread, a little parsley, sweet marjoram and thyme, all shred  fine, nutmeg, salt and pepper to your taste, mix them up into a light  stuffing, with a quarter of a pound of butter, a little good cream, and  two eggs; put it into the body, and sew them up; dredge and baste them  well with lard, roast them near an hour, serve them up with parsley and  butter for sauce, chop the livers, and lay them in lumps round the edge  of the dish.           *       *       *       *       *    TO STEW WILD DUCKS.    Having prepared the fowls, rub the insides with salt, pepper, and a  little powdered cloves; put a shallot or two with a lump of butter in  the body of each, then lay them in a pan that will just hold them,  putting butter under and over them, with vinegar and water, and add  pepper, salt, lemon peel, and a bunch of sweet herbs; then cover the pan  close, and let them stew till done--pass the liquor through a sieve,  pour it over the ducks, and serve them up hot, with a garnish of lemon  sliced, and raspings of bread fried. The same way may teal, &c. be  dressed.           *       *       *       *       *    TO DRESS DUCKS WITH JUICE OF ORANGES.    The ducks being singed, picked, and drawn, mince the livers with a  little scraped bacon, some butter, green onions, sweet herbs and  parsley, seasoned with salt, pepper, and mushrooms; these being all  minced together, put them into the bodies of the ducks, and roast them,  covered with slices of bacon, and wrapped up in paper; then put a little  gravy, the juice of an orange, a few shallots minced, into a stew pan,  and shake in a little pepper; when the ducks are roasted, take off the  bacon, dish them, and pour your sauce with the juice of"]]]
