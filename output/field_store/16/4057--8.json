I believe that in few departments are current  educational theories and practises so hard on youth of superior gifts,  just at the age when all become geniuses for a season, very brief for  most, prolonged for some, and permanent for the best. We do not know  how to teach to, see, hear, and feel when the sense centers are most  indelibly impressible, and to give relative rest to the hand during  the years when its power of accuracy is abated and when all that is  good is idealized furthest, and confidence in ability to produce is at  its lowest ebb.    Finally, our divorce between industrial and manual training is  abnormal, and higher technical education is the chief sufferer.  Professor Thurston, of Cornell, who has lately returned from a tour of  inspection abroad, reported that to equal Germany we now need: \"1.  Twenty technical universities, having in their schools of engineering  50 instructors and 500 students each. 2. Two thousand technical high  schools or manual-training schools, each having not less than 200  students and 10 instructors.\" If we have elementary trade-schools,  this would mean technical high schools enough to accommodate 700,000  students, served by 20,000 teachers. With the strong economic  arguments in this direction we are not here concerned; but that there  are tendencies to unfit youth for life by educational method and  matter shown in strong relief from this standpoint, we shall point out  in a later chapter.

Under the term gymnastics, literally naked exercises, we here include  those denuded of all utilities or ulterior ends save those of physical  culture. This is essentially modern and was unknown in antiquity,  where training was for games, for war, etc. Several ideals underlie  this movement, which although closely related are distinct and as yet  by no means entirely harmonized. These may be described as follows:    A. One aim of Jahn, more developed by Spiess, and their successors,  was to do everything physically possible for the body as a mechanism.  Many postures and attitudes are assumed and many movements made that  are never called for in life. Some of these are so novel that a great  variety of new apparatus had to be devised to bring them out; and Jahn  invented many new names, some of them without etymologies, to  designate the repertory of his discoveries and inventions that  extended the range of motor life. Common movements, industries, and  even games, train only a limited number of muscles, activities, and  coordinations, and leave more or less unused groups and combinations,  so that many latent possibilities slumber, and powers slowly lapse  through disuse. Not only must these be rescued, but the new nascent  possibilities of modern progressive man must be addressed and  developed. Even the common things that the average untrained youth can  not do are legion, and each of these should be a new incentive to the  trainer as he realizes how very far below their motor possibilities  meet men live. The man of the future may, and even must, do things  impossible in the past and acquire new motor variations not given by  heredity. Our somatic frame and its powers must therefore be carefully  studied, inventoried, and assessed afresh, and a kind and amount of  exercise required that is exactly proportioned, not perhaps to the  size but to the capability of each voluntary muscle. Thus only can we  have a truly humanistic physical development, analogous to the  training of all the powers of the mind in a broad, truly liberal, and  non-professional or non-vocational educational curriculum. The body  will thus have its rightful share in the pedagogic traditions and  inspirations of the renaissance. Thus only can we have a true scale of  standardised culture values for efferent processes; and from this we  can measure the degrees of departure, both in the direction of excess  and defect, of each form of work, motor habit; and even play. Many  modern Epigoni in the wake of this great ideal, where its momentum was  early spent, feeling that new activities might be discovered with  virtues hitherto undreamed of, have almost made fetiches of special  disciplines, both developmental and corrective, that are pictured and  landed in scores of manuals. Others have had expectations no less  excessive in the opposite direction and have argued that the greatest  possible variety of movements best developed the greatest total of  motor energy. Jahn especially thus made gymnastics a special art and  inspired great enthusiasm of humanity, and the songs of his pupils  were of a better race of man and a greater and united fatherland. It  was this feature that made his work unique in the world, and his  disciples are fond of reminding us of the fact that it was just about  one generation of men after the acme of influence of his system that,  in 1870, Germany showed herself the greatest military power since  ancient Rome, and took the acknowledged leadership of the world both  in education and science.    These theorizations even in their extreme forms have been not only  highly suggestive but have brought great and new enthusiasms and  ideals into the educational world that admirably fit adolescence. The  motive of bringing out latent, decaying, or even new powers, skills,  knacks, and feats, is full of inspiration. Patriotism is aroused, for  thus the country can be better served; thus the German Fatherland was  to be restored and unified after the dark days that followed the  humiliation of Jena. Now the ideals of religion are invoked that the  soul may have a better and regenerated somatic organism with which to  serve Jesus and the Church. Exercise is made a form of praise to God  and of service to man, and these motives are reenforced by those of  the new hygiene which strives for a new wholeness-holiness, and would  purify the body as the temple of the Holy Ghost. Thus in Young Men's  Christian Association training schools and gymnasiums the gospel of  Christianity is preached anew and seeks to bring salvation to man's  physical frame, which the still lingering effects of asceticism have  caused to be too long neglected in its progressive degeneration. As  the Greek games were in honor of the gods, so now the body is trained  to better glorify God; and regimen, chastity, and temperance are given  a new momentum. The physical salvation thus wrought will be, when  adequately written, one of the most splendid chapters in the modern  history of Christianity. Military ideals have been revived in cult and  song to hearten the warfare against evil within and without. Strength  is prayed for as well as worked for, and consecrated to the highest  uses. Last but not least, power thus developed over a large surface  may be applied to athletic contests in the field, and victories here  are valuable as fore-gleams of how sweet the glory of achievements in  higher moral and spiritual tasks will taste later.    The dangers and sources of error in this ideal of all-sided training  are, alas, only too obvious, although they only qualify its paramount  good. First, it is impossible thus to measure the quanta of training  needed so as rightly to assign to each its modicum and best modality  of training. Indeed no method of doing this has ever been attempted,  but the assessments have been arbitrary and conjectural, probably  right in some and wrong in other respects, with no adequate criterion  or test for either save only empirical experience. Secondly, heredity,  which lays its heavy ictus upon some neglected forms of activity and  fails of all support for others, has been ignored. As we shall see  later, one of the best norms here is phyletic emphasis, and what lacks  this must at best be feeble; and if new powers are unfolding, their  growth must be very slow and they must be nurtured as tender buds for  generations. Thirdly, too little regard is had for the vast  differences in individuals, most of whom need much personal  prescription.    B. In practise the above ideal is never isolated from others. Perhaps  the most closely associated with it is that of increased volitional  control. Man is largely a creature of habit, and many of his  activities are more or less automatic reflexes from"]]]
