The strips when finished she  sewed together with strong linen thread on the wrong side of the rug.  She commenced the rug by knitting two rows of the twine or cord. (When  I was a girl we called this common knitting 'garter stitch.') Then,  when commencing to knit third row, slip off first stitch onto your  other needle; knit one stitch, then lay one of the tiny scraps of silk  across or between the two needles; knit one stitch with the cord. This  holds the silk in position. Then fold or turn one end of silk back on  the other piece of silk and knit one stitch of cord to hold them in  place, always keeping silk on one side, on the top of rug, as this rug  is not reversible. Continue in this manner until one row is finished.  Then knit once across plain with cord, and for next row lay silk  scraps in and knit as before. Always knit one row of the cord across  plain after knitting in scraps of silk, as doing this holds them  firmly in position. Of course, Mary, you will use judgment and taste  in combining light and dark, bright and dull colors. Also, do not use  several scraps of velvet together. Use velvet, silk and satin  alternately. Should any scraps of silk be longer than others after  knitting, trim off evenly so all will be of uniform size. When her rug  was finished, Aunt Cornelia spread it, wrong side uppermost, on an  unused table, covered it with a thick boiled paste, composed of flour  and water, allowed it to dry thoroughly, then lined the rug with a  heavy piece of denim. This was done to prevent the rug from curling up  at edges, and caused it to lie flat on floor; but I think I should  prefer just a firm lining or foundation of heavy burlap or denim.\"    \"Thank you, Aunt Sarah, for your explicit directions. I cannot fail to  know just how to knit a silk rug, should I ever care to do so. I think  the work would be simply fascinating.\"          CHAPTER XIII.    THE GIRLS' CAMPFIRE, ORGANIZED BY MARY.      One day in early June, when all nature seemed aglow with happiness, we  find Mary earnestly discussing with Elizabeth Schmidt the prosaic,  humdrum life of many of the country girls, daughters of well-to-do  farmers in the vicinity.    \"I wish,\" said Mary, wrinkling her forehead thoughtfully, \"I could  think of some new interest to introduce into their lives; some way of  broadening their outlook; anything to bring more happiness into their  commonplace daily toil; something good and helpful for them to think  about.\"    All at once Mary, who was not usually demonstrative, clapped her  hands, laughed gleefully and said: \"I have it, Elizabeth. The very  thing! Suppose we start a 'girls' campfire,' right here in the  country? I don't think we shall have any trouble to organize.\"    \"And you, because you understand all about it, will be the Guardian,\"  said Elizabeth.    At first Mary demurred, but, overcome by Elizabeth's pleading, finally  gave a reluctant consent. They then made out a list of the girls they  thought might be willing to join, Mary promising to write at once for  a handbook. They separated, Elizabeth to call to see the girls, and  Mary to interview their parents. Their efforts were rewarded with  surprisingly gratifying results, for many of the girls had read about  the \"Campfire Girls\" and were anxious to become members.           *       *       *       *       *    One afternoon, several weeks later, had you gone into the old apple  orchard, at the farm, you would have seen thirteen eager young girls,  ranging in age from fourteen to sixteen, listening intently to Mary,  who was telling them about the \"Campfire Girls.\" What she told them  was something like this:    \"Now girls, we are going to have a good time. Some of our good times  will be play and some work. When you join, you will become a 'Wood  Gatherer,' and after three months' successful work, if you have met  certain qualifications, you will be promoted to the rank of 'Fire  Maker.' Later on, when you come to realize what it means to be a  'Torch Bearer,' you will be put in that rank. The first law which you  learn to follow is one which you must apply to your daily life. It is:  Seek beauty, give service, pursue knowledge, be trustworthy, hold on  to health, glorify work, be happy. 'The Camp Fire' has meant so much  to girls I have known, for their betterment, and has been so helpful  in many ways, you surely will never regret becoming a member of the  organization, or be anything but happy if you keep their laws. There  will be no dues, except what is collected for good times, and no  expense except the cost of your ceremonial costume, epaulettes and  honor beads. The latter are quite inexpensive. The honors are divided  into several classes, and for each honor a bead is given as a symbol  of your work. A special colored bead is given for each class. We shall  meet about once every week. The monthly meeting is called the 'Council  Fire.' I will tell you later about the 'Wohelo' ceremony. By the way,  girls, 'Wohelo' stands for work, health and love. You see, the word is  composed of the first two letters of each word.\"    The girls appeared to be greatly interested, and Mary felt very much  encouraged. Some of the girls left to talk it over with the homefolks,  while others, wishing to learn more of the organisation, plied Mary  with numerous questions. Finally, in desperation, she said: \"Girls, I  will read you the following from the 'Camp Fire Girls' Handbook, which  I received this morning:\"    'The purpose of this organization is to show that the common things of  daily life are the chief means of beauty, romance and adventure; to  aid in the forming of habits making for health and vigor, the  out-of-door habit and the out-of-door spirit; to devise ways of  measuring and creating standards to woman's work, and to give girls  the opportunity to learn how to \"keep step,\" to learn team work,  through doing it; to help girls and women serve the community, the  larger home, in the same way they have always served the individual  home; to give status and social recognition to the knowledge of the  mother, and thus restore the intimate relationship of mothers and  daughters to each other.'    \"Well, girls,\" said Mary, as she laid aside the book, \"I think you all  understand what a benefit this will be to you, and I will do all in  my power to help you girls, while I am at the farm this summer. It is  too late to tell you any more today. The information I have given you  will suffice for the present. Three cheers for our Camp Fire! which  will be under way in two months, I trust.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The members of \"Shawnee\" Camp Fire held their first Council Fire, or  Ceremonial Meeting, the second week in July. The girls, all deeply  interested, worked hard to secure honors which were awarded for  engaging in domestic duties well known to the home, for studying and  observing the rules of hygiene and sanitation, and for learning and  achievements in various ways. They held weekly meetings and studied  diligently to win the rank of Fire Maker.    A girl, when she joins, becomes a Wood Gatherer; she then receives a  silver ring.    The weeks pass swiftly by, and it is time for another Camp Fire. The  girls selected as their meeting place for this occasion farmer  Druckenmuller's peach orchard, to which they walked, a distance of  about three miles from the home of Elizabeth Schmidt. They left about  two o'clock in the afternoon, intending to return home before  nightfall, a good time being anticipated, as they took with them lunch  and materials for a corn-roast.    The peach orchard in question, covering many acres, was situated at  the foot of a low hill. Between the two flowed an enchanting,  fairy-like stream, the cultivated peach orchard on one side, and on  the opposite side the forest-like hill, covered with an abundance of  wild flowers.    When the afternoon set for the Council Fire arrived, had you happened  to meet the fifteen merry, chattering girls, accompanied by two older  girls, Mary and Lucy Robbins (the country school teacher), as  chaperones, wending their way to the orchard, you, without a doubt,  would have smiled and a question might naturally have arisen regarding  their sanity. They certainly possessed intelligent faces, but why  those queer-shaped Indian dresses? And such an awkward length for a  young girl's dress! And why was their hair all worn hanging in one  braid over each shoulder, with a band over the forehead? Why so many  strings of gaudy beads around their necks? These questions may all be  answered in one single sentence: The girls are dressed in Ceremonial  Costume.    [Illustration: ELIZABETH SCHMIDT \"LAUGHING WATER\"]    A great many delays along the way were caused by girls asking the  names of the different wild flowers and weeds they noticed in passing.  One of the girls stopped to examine a prickly-looking plant about two  feet high, with little, blue flowers growing along the stem, and asked  if any one knew the name of it. They were about to look it up in a  small \"Flower Guide\" owned by one of the girls, when some one said:  \"Why, that is a weed called 'Vipers Bougloss,'\" They also found  cardinal flower, thorn apple, monkey flower and jewel-weed in  abundance, wild sunflower, ginseng, early golden rod, \"Joe-pie-weed,\"  marshallow, black cohosh and purple loose-trifle. The girls also  noticed various birds.    On a tall tree one of the girls espied a rose-breasted Grosbeak, rare  in this part of Bucks County. They all stopped and watched for a short  time a white-bellied Nut-hatch. The girls were startled as a Scarlet  Tanger flew past to join his mate, and they at last reached their  rendezvous, the orchard.    By half-past three they were all seated in a circle waiting for the  ceremonies to begin.

A sight so passing fair might have stilled the most  turbulent spirits into peace; at least so I thought, as, wrapped in my  cloak, I leant back against the supporting arm of my husband, and  looking from the waters to the sky, and from the sky to the waters, with  delight and admiration. My pleasant reverie was, however, soon ended,  when I suddenly felt the boat touch the rocky bank, and heard the  boatmen protesting they would go no further that night. We were nearly  three miles below Peterborough, and how I was to walk this distance,  weakened as I was by recent illness and fatigue of our long travelling,  I knew not. To spend the night in an open boat, exposed to the heavy  dews arising from the river, would be almost death. While we were  deliberating on what to do, the rest of the passengers had made up their  minds, and taken the way through the woods by a road they were well  acquainted with. They were soon out of sight, all but one gentleman, who  was bargaining with one of the rowers to take him and his dog across the  river at the head of the rapids in a skiff.    Imagine our situation, at ten o'clock at night, without knowing a single  step of our road, put on shore to find the way to the distant town as we  best could, or pass the night in the dark forest.    Almost in despair, we entreated the gentleman to be our guide as far as  he went. But so many obstacles beset our path in the form of newly-  chopped trees and blocks of stone, scattered along the shore, that it  was with the utmost difficulty we could keep him in sight. At last we  came up with him at the place appointed to meet the skiff, and, with a  pertinacity that at another time and in other circumstances we never  should have adopted, we all but insisted on being admitted into the  boat. An angry growling consent was extorted from the surly Charon, and  we hastily entered the frail bark, which seemed hardly calculated to  convey us in safety to the opposite shore.    I could not help indulging in a feeling of indescribable fear, as I  listened to the torrent of profane invective that burst forth  continually from the lips of the boatman. Once or twice we were in  danger of being overset by the boughs of the pines and cedars which had  fallen into the water near the banks. Right glad was I when we reached  the opposite shores; but here a new trouble arose: there was yet more  untracked wood to cross before we again met the skiff which had to pass  up a small rapid, and meet us at the head of the small lake, an  expansion of the Otanabee a little below Peterborough. At the distance  of every few yards our path was obstructed by fallen trees, mostly  hemlock, spruce, or cedar, the branches of which are so thickly  interwoven that it is scarcely possible to separate them, or force a  passage through the tangled thicket which they form.    Had it not been for the humane assistance of our conductor, I know not  how I should have surmounted these difficulties. Sometimes I was ready  to sink down from very weariness. At length I hailed, with a joy I could  hardly have supposed possible, the gruff voice of the Irish rower, and,  after considerable grumbling on his part, we were again seated.    Glad enough we were to see, by the blazing light of an enormous log-  heap, the house of our friend. Here we received the offer of a guide to  show us the way to the town by a road cut through the wood. We partook  of the welcome refreshment of tea, and, having gained a little strength  by a short rest, we once more commenced our journey, guided by a ragged,  but polite, Irish boy, whose frankness and good humour quite won our  regards. He informed us he was one of seven orphans, who had lost father  and mother in the cholera. It was a sad thing, he said, to be left  fatherless and motherless, in a strange land; and he swept away the  tears that gathered in his eyes as he told the simple, but sad tale of  his early bereavement; but added, cheerfully, he had met with a kind  master, who had taken some of his brothers and sisters into his service  as well as himself.    Just as we were emerging from the gloom of the wood we found our  progress impeded by a _creek_, as the boy called it, over which he told  us we must pass by a log-bridge before we could get to the town. Now,  the log-bridge was composed of one log, or rather a fallen tree, thrown  across the stream, rendered very slippery by the heavy dew that had  risen from the swamp. As the log admitted of only one person at a time,  I could receive no assistance from my companions; and, though our little  guide, with a natural politeness arising from the benevolence of his  disposition, did me all the service in his power by holding the lantern  close to the surface to throw all the light he could on the subject, I  had the ill luck to fall in up to my knees in the water, my head turning  quite giddy just as I came to the last step or two; thus was I wet as  well as weary. To add to our misfortune we saw the lights disappear, one  by one, in the village, till a solitary candle, glimmering from the  upper chambers of one or two houses, were our only beacons. We had yet a  lodging to seek, and it was near midnight before we reached the door of  the principal inn; there, at least, thought I, our troubles for to-night  will end; but great was our mortification on being told there was not a  spare bed to be had in the house, every one being occupied by emigrants  going up to one of the back townships.    I could go no further, and we petitioned for a place by the kitchen  fire, where we might rest, at least, if not sleep, and I might dry my  wet garments. On seeing my condition the landlady took compassion on me,  led me to a blazing fire, which her damsels quickly roused up; one  brought a warm bath for my feet, while another provided a warm potation,  which, I really believe, strange and unusual to my lips as it was, did  me good: in short, we received every kindness and attention that we  required from mine host and hostess, who relinquished their own bed for  our accommodation, contenting themselves with a shakedown before the  kitchen fire.    I can now smile at the disasters of _that_ day, but at the time they  appeared no trifles, as you may well suppose.    Farewell, my dearest Mother.          LETTER VI.    Peterborough.--Manners and Language of the Americans.--Scotch  Engineman.--Description of Peterborough and its Environs.--Canadian  Flowers.--Shanties.--Hardships suffered by first Settlers.--Process of  establishing a Farm.    Peterborough, Sept. 11, 1832.    IT is now settled that we abide here till after the government sale has  taken place. We are, then, to remain with S------ and his family till we  have got a few acres chopped, and a log-house put up on our own land.  Having determined to go at once into the bush, on account of our  military grant, which we have been so fortunate as to draw in the  neighbourhood of S------, we have fully made up our minds to enter at  once, and cheerfully, on the privations and inconveniences attending  such a situation; as there is no choice between relinquishing that great  advantage and doing our settlement duties. We shall not be worse off  than others who have gone before us to the unsettled townships, many of  whom, naval and military officers, with their families, have had to  struggle with considerable difficulties, but who are now beginning to  feel the advantages arising from their exertions.    In addition to the land he is entitled to as an officer in the British  service, my husband is in treaty for the purchase of an eligible lot by  small lakes. This will give us a water frontage, and a further  inducement to bring us within a little distance of S------; so that we  shall not be quite so lonely as if we had gone on to our government lot  at once.    We have experienced some attention and hospitality from several of the  residents of Peterborough. There is a very genteel society, chiefly  composed of officers and their families, besides the professional men  and storekeepers. Many of the latter are persons of respectable family  and good education. Though a store is, in fact, nothing better than what  we should call in the country towns at home a \"_general shop_,\" yet the  storekeeper in Canada holds a very different rank from the shopkeeper of  the English village. The storekeepers are the merchants and bankers of  the places in which they reside. Almost all money matters are transacted  by them, and they are often men of landed property and consequence, not  unfrequently filling the situations of magistrates, commissioners, and  even members of the provincial parliament.    As they maintain a rank in society which entitles them to equality with  the aristocracy of the country, you must not be surprised when I tell  you that it is no uncommon circumstance to see the sons of naval and  military officers and clergymen standing behind a counter, or wielding  an axe in the woods with their fathers' choppers; nor do they lose their  grade in society by such employment. After all, it is education and  manners that must distinguish the gentleman in this country, seeing that  the labouring man, if he is diligent and industrious, may soon become  his equal in point of worldly possessions. The ignorant man, let him be  ever so wealthy, can never be equal to the man of education. It is the  mind that forms the distinction between the classes in this country--  \"Knowledge is power!\"    We had heard so much of the odious manners of the Yankees in this  country that I was rather agreeably surprised by the few specimens of  native Americans that I have seen. They were for the most part, polite,  well-behaved people. The only peculiarities I observed in them were a  certain nasal twang in speaking, and some few odd phrases; but these  were only used by the lower class, who \"_guess_\" and \"_calculate_\" a"]]]
