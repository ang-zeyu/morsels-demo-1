But Petrarch speaks of it as follows.  \"Non longe a Puteolis Falernus collis attollitur, famoso palmite  nobilis.

Faustus answered, My most excellent lord, I am ready to  accomplish your request in all things, so farre forth as I and  my spirit are able to performe:  yet your majesty shall know that  their dead bodies are not able substantially to be brought before  you; but such spirits as have seene Alexander and his Paramour  alive shall appeare unto you, in manner and form as they both  lived in their most flourishing time; and herewith I hope to  please your Imperiall Majesty.  Then Faustus went a little aside  to speake to his spirit; but he returned againe presently, saying,  Now, if it please your Majesty, you shall see them; yet, upon this  condition, that you demand no question of them, nor speake unto  them; which the Emperor agreed unto.  Wherewith Doctor Faustus opened  the privy-chamber doore, where presently entered the great and mighty  emperor Alexander Magnus, in all things to looke upon as if he  had beene alive; in proportion, a strong set thicke man, of a  middle stature, blacke haire, and that both thicke and curled,  head and beard, red cheekes, and a broad face, with eyes like  a basiliske; he had a compleat harnesse (i.e. suit of armour)  burnished and graven, exceeding rich to look upon:  and so,  passing towards the Emperor Carolus, he made low and reverend  courtesie:  whereat the Emperour Carolus would have stood up to  receive and greet him with the like reverence; but Faustus tooke  hold on him, and would not permit him to doe it.  Shortly after,  Alexander made humble reverence, and went out againe; and comming  to the doore, his paramour met him.  She comming in made the Emperour  likewise reverence:  she was cloathed in blew velvet, wrought and  imbroidered with pearls and gold; she was also excellent faire,  like milke and blood mixed, tall and slender, with a face round  as an apple.  And thus passed [she-- certaine times up and downe  the house; which the Emperor marking, said to himselfe, Now have  I seene two persons which my heart hath long wished to behold;  and sure it cannot otherwise be (said he to himselfe) but that  the spirits have changed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/781"],[0,"Sinking of the Titanic and Great Sea Disasters (#11)"],[1,"is no basis for such tales. The  captain, according to the testimony of those who were near him almost  until the last, was admirably cool. He carried a revolver in his hand,  ready to use it on anyone who disobeyed orders.    \"I want every man to act like a man for manhood's sake,\" he said, \"and  if they don't, a bullet awaits the coward.\"    With the revolver in his hand--a fact that undoubtedly gave rise to  the suicide theory--the captain moved up and down the deck. He gave the  order for each life-boat to make off and he remained until every boat  was gone. Standing on the bridge he finally called out the order: \"Each  man save himself.\" At that moment all discipline fled. It was the last  call of death. If there had been any hope among those on board before,  the hope now had fled.    The bearded admiral of the White Star Line fleet, with every life-saving  device launched from the decks, was returning to the deck to perform the  sacred office of going down with his ship when a wave dashed over the  side and tore him from the ladder.    The Titanic was sinking rapidly by the head, with the twisting sidelong  motion that was soon to aim her on her course two miles down. Murdock  saw the skipper swept out; but did not move. Captain Smith was but one  of a multitude of lost at that moment. Murdock may have known that the  last desperate thought of the gray mariner was to get upon his bridge  and die in command. That the old man could not have done this may have  had something to do with Murdock's suicidal inspiration. Of that no man  may say or safely guess.    The wave that swept the skipper out bore him almost to the thwart of  a crowded life-boat. Hands reached out, but he wrenched himself away,  turned and swam back toward the ship.    Some say that he said, \"Good-bye, I'm going back to the ship.\"    He disappeared for a moment, then reappeared where a rail was slipping  under water. Cool and courageous to the end, loyal to his duty under the  most difficult circumstances, he showed himself a noble captain, and he  died a noble death.      SAW BOTH OFFICERS PERISH    Quartermaster Moody saw all this, watched the skipper scramble aboard  again onto the submerged decks, and then vanish altogether in a great  billow.    As Moody's eye lost sight of the skipper in this confusion of waters it  again shifted to the bridge, and just in time to see Murdock take his  life. The man's face was turned toward him, Moody said, and he could  not mistake it. There were still many gleaming lights on the ship,  flickering out like little groups of vanishing stars, and with the  clear starshine on the waters there was nothing to cloud or break the  quartermaster's vision.    \"I saw Murdock die by his own hand,\" said Moody, \"saw the flash from  his gun, heard the crack that followed the flash and then saw him plunge  over on his face.\"    Others report hearing several pistol shots on the decks below the  bridge, but amid the groans and shrieks and cries, shouted orders and  all that vast orchestra of sounds that broke upon the air they must have  been faint periods of punctuation    BAND PLAYED ITS OWN DIRGE    The band had broken out in the strains of \"Nearer, My God, to Thee,\"  some minutes before Murdock lifted the revolver to his head, fired and  toppled over on his face. Moody saw all this in a vision that filled his  brain, while his ears drank in the tragic strain of the beautiful hymn  that the band played as their own dirge, even to the moment when the  waters sucked them down.    Wherever Murdock's eye swept the water in that instant, before he drew  his revolver, it looked upon veritable seas of drowning men and women.  From the decks there came to him the shrieks and groans of the caged and  drowning, for whom all hope of escape was utterly vanished. He evidently  never gave a thought to the possibility of saving himself, his mind  freezing with the horrors he beheld and having room for just one central  idea--swift extinction.    The strains of the hymn and the frantic cries of the dying blended in a  symphony of sorrow.    Led by the green light, under the light of stars, the boats drew away,  and the bow, then the quarter, then the stacks and last the stern of the  marvel ship of a few days before passed beneath the waters. The great  force of the ship's sinking was unaided by any violence of the elements,  and the suction, not so great as had been feared, rocked but mildly the  group of boats now a quarter of a mile distant from it.    Just before the Titanic disappeared from view men and women leaped from  the stern. More than a hundred men, according to Colonel Gracie, jumped  at the last. Gracie was among the number and he and the second officer  were of the very few who were saved.    As the vessel disappeared, the waves drowned the majestic      {illust. caption = DEPTH OF OCEAN WHERE THE TITANIC WENT DOWN    The above etching shows a diagram of the ocean depths between the shore  of Newfoundland (shown at the top to the left, by the heavily shaded  part) to 800 miles out, where the Titanic struck an iceberg and sank.  Over the Great Bank of Newfoundland the greatest depth is about 35  fathoms, or 210 feet. Then there is a sudden drop to 105 fathoms, or  630 feet, and then there is a falling away to 1650 fathoms or 9900 feet,  then 2000 fathoms or 12,000 feet, and about where the Titanic sank 2760  fathoms or 16,560 feet.}      hymn which the musicians played as they went to their watery grave. The  most authentic accounts agree that this hymn was not \"Nearer, My God, to  Thee,\" which it seems had been        {illust. caption = CARPATHIA    The Cunard liner which brought the survivors of the Titanic to New  York.}    {illust. caption = THE HERO WIRELESS OPERATOR OF THE TITANIC    Photograph of Harold...}      played shortly before, but \"Autumn,\" which is found in the Episcopal  hymnal and which fits appropriately the situation on the Titanic in the  last moments of pain and darkness there. One line, \"Hold me up in mighty  waters,\" particularly may have suggested the hymn to some minister  aboard the doomed vessel, who, it has been thought, thereupon asked  the remaining passengers to join in singing the hymn, in a last service  aboard the sinking ship, soon to be ended by death itself.    Following is the hymn:     God of mercy and compassion!       Look with pity on my pain:   Hear a mournful, broken spirit       Prostrate at Thy feet complain;   Many are my foes, and mighty;       Strength to conquer I have none;   Nothing can uphold my goings       But Thy blessed Self alone.     Saviour, look on Thy beloved;       Triumph over all my foes;   Turn to heavenly joy my mourning,       Turn to gladness all my woes;   Live or die, or work or suffer,       Let my weary soul abide,   In all changes whatsoever       Sure and steadfast by Thy side.   When temptations fierce assault me,       When my enemies I find,   Sin and guilt, and death and Satan,       All against my soul combined,   Hold me up in mighty waters,       Keep my eyes on things above,   Righteousness, divine Atonement,       Peace, and everlasting Love.      It was a little lame schoolmaster, Tyrtaeus, who aroused the Spartans by  his poetry and led them to victory against the foe.    It was the musicians of the band of the Titanic--poor men, paid a few  dollars a week--who played the music to keep up the courage of the souls  aboard the sinking ship.    \"The way the band kept playing was a noble thing,\" says the wireless  operator. \"I heard it first while we were working the wireless, when  there was a rag-time tune for us, and the last I saw of the band, when I  was floating, struggling in the icy water, it was still on deck, playing  'Autumn.' How those brave fellows ever did it I cannot imagine.\"    Perhaps that music, made in the face of death, would not have satisfied  the exacting critical sense. It may be that the chilled fingers faltered  on the pistons of the cornet or at the valves of the French horn, that  the time was irregular and that by an organ in a church, with a decorous  congregation, the hymns they chose would have been better played and  sung. But surely that music went up to God from the souls of drowning  men, and was not less acceptable than the song of songs no mortal ear  may hear, the harps of the seraphs and the choiring cherubim. Under the  sea the music-makers lie, still in their fingers clutching the broken  and battered means of melody; but over the strident voice of warring  winds and the sound of many waters there rises their chant eternally;  and though the musicians lie hushed and cold at the sea's heart, their  music is heard forevermore.      LAST MOMENTS    That great ship, which started out as proudly, went down to her death  like some grime silent juggernaut, drunk with carnage and anxious to  stop the throbbing of her own heart at the bottom of the sea. Charles H.  Lightoller, second officer of the Titanic, tells the story this way:    \"I stuck to the ship until the water came up to my ankles. There had  been no lamentations, no demonstrations either from the men passengers  as they saw the last life-boat go, and there was no wailing or crying,  no outburst from the men who lined the ship's rail as the Titanic  disappeared from sight.    \"The men stood quietly as if they were in church. They knew that they  were in the sight of God; that in a moment judgment would be passed  upon them. Finally, the ship took a dive, reeling for a moment, then  plunging. I was sucked to the side of the ship against the grating over  the blower for the exhaust. There was an explosion. It blew me to the  surface again, only to be sucked back again by the water rushing into  the ship    \"This time I landed against the grating over the pipes, which furnish a  draught for the funnels, and stuck there. There was another explosion,  and I came to the surface. The ship seemed to be heaving tremendous  sighs as she"]]]
