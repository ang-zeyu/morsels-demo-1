The horse power of the wheel may be computed as for the current wheel,  Fig. 23, and, as the horse power is equal to 33,000 pounds raised one  foot high per minute, we may assume a construction of wheel that will  allow of discharging at 8 feet above the stream; then 33,000 / 8 = 4,125  pounds of water discharged at 8 feet elevation per horse power per  minute. As the net power of the wheel in the last example, for Fig. 23,  was 0.468 of a horse power, then 4,125 x 0.468 = 1,930 pounds of water  raised 8 ft. per minute by the size of bucket and velocity of current in  that case. From this a deduction of 20 per cent. should be made for loss  by spill and imperfect construction, so that 1,500 pounds or 176 gallons  per minute would be the probable output--over 253,000 gallons per day;  or, for irrigating purposes, equal to a rainfall of over 11/4 inches in  depth on 50 acres in one week.    The proportion of capacity of the lifting buckets for such a wheel  becomes of as great importance as its efficiency.    If the buckets are too large, the wheel will stall, and if too small,  the wheel will not give its full duty.    For obtaining the approximate capacity of the lifting buckets, assuming  the example as above computed, a 10 foot wheel with the velocity at  periphery of 21/2 feet per second is 150 feet per minute, or five  revolutions per minute, nearly. Then 1,930 lb. per m. / 5 revolutions =  386 pounds water capacity for all of the buckets on the wheel.    If such a wheel is constructed with 16 blades and 16 buckets, one  between each blade, then 386 / 16 = 24 pounds for each bucket, or 38 /  100 of a cubic foot.    The spill from this capacity of bucket being sufficient to compensate  for the friction of the shaft journals.    The lifting buckets of the noria class, Figs. 26 and 27, can be made of  positive dimensions to suit the computations as above; but those of the  tympanum class, Fig. 25, should be made of dimensions to conform with  the required capacity at the moment of leaving the water, as the water  at this point flows into the arm.

Witz, says the _Gas World_, has been conducting a series of  experiments on the Delamare-Deboutteville and Malindin gas engine,  driven by Dowson gas, and in which the gas generator takes the place of  the ordinary steam boiler. The engine was a one-cylinder motor in the  establishment of Messrs. Matter & Co., Rouen. Its power was 100 horse  indicated; the cylinder was 23 inches in diameter, the stroke 38 inches,  and the normal speed 100 revolutions. The engine is of the Simplex type;  the kindling is electric; the cycle of operations is fourfold, with  powerful compression. The Dowson generator is 30 inches inside diameter  and 76 inches in height from the bars to the top. Air is blown in by  steam driven in under the hearth. There is a siphon, a coke scrubber 110  inches high, a sawdust purifier, and a gasholder of 750 cubic feet  capacity, and a pipe to the engine 5.2 inches in diameter. The total  area occupied by this apparatus is 140 square yards, of which two-thirds  are built on. The anthracite employed was from Swansea, containing 5.4  per cent. of ash. The observations made with a string friction brake  were continued for 68 hours, everything used being carefully weighed and  measured. One day the machine was worked for 151/4 hours on end; the other  days it was worked with an interval of half an hour every 12 hours to  clear the hearth, poke the fire and lubricate the machine; and it was  clearly established that with a big enough generator it would be quite  possible to work continuously for several days.    The following were the data for a day of 24 hours, with an interval of  half an hour: 8:55 P.M. one day to 8:55 P.M. the next, interval 8:30 to  9 A.M. Anthracite used, 18.4 cwt.; coke used, 3.42 cwt.; water used for  steam injection, 217.3 gallons; water used in scrubber, 4,106 gallons;  water used in cooling the cylinder, 20,000 gallons; oil used in  cylinder, 14.84 pounds; grease, 1.8 pounds; revolutions of machine,  142,157, or 100.8 per minute; effective work, 75.86 French horse power,  or 77.4 British; gas used, 6,742 cubic feet per hour, at 772 mm.  pressure and 70.7 deg. F., or 83.7 cubic feet per effective horse power;  efficiency, 69 per cent.    Now, with regard to the comparison between the large gas motors and  steam engines of the same size, M. Witz goes on to remark that the gas  engine is by no means, as was formerly thought on high authority,  necessarily restricted to the domain of smaller work and sizes. Even in  early times it was seen that the gas engine belonged to a type in which  there were possibilities of improvement greater than those available in  the steam engine, because the difference of temperature between the  working substance in its hotter and its cooler condition was greater  than in the steam engine; and consumptions of 5,250 cubic feet per horse  power per hour soon descended step by step as far as 2,060, while the  power went up, past 4, 8 and 12, to 25 or 50 horse power; and in the  exhibition of 1889 there were gas engines seen in which the explosion  chamber had a diameter of as much as 23 inches.    But the price of coal gas seemed to be too high for use in these large  engines, in which sizes steam is comparatively cheap; and so poorer gas,  which, though possessing only about 28 per cent. of the heating power,  is still cheaper in proportion than coal gas, when it is made on the  spot, was introduced to tide over the difficulty. Difficulties have been  successively overcome, with the result which we have just seen, namely,  1.37 pounds of anthracite per effective horse power, or about half the  carbon which a steam engine of the same power of excellent design, and  well kept up, would consume. A 50 horse simplex at Marseilles, in  Barataud's flour mill, is said to have run for the last 2 years on 1.12  pounds of English anthracite per effective horse power; and thus M. Witz  says his predictions of 10 years ago, that the gas producer would some  day replace the boiler, are being verified in such a way as to surprise  even himself.    But the objection is stated, and it is a serious one: the weight of fuel  is not the only thing to be considered. The steam engine uses coal, the  producer requires English anthracite, which is dearer; the gas motor  uses a great deal of water and a great deal of oil, which cost money;  and gas motors are dear, while gas producers and their adjuncts cost a  tidy bit of money, and wear out pretty fast. Is not steam, after all,  more economical in the long run? Besides, producers are bulky and take  up a great deal of space; the weight of fuel is only one element in a  complicated problem.    In order to study the grounds of this objection, M. Witz has instituted  a comparison between the actual cost of large steam engines and that of  gas motors of similar size.    Take a good Galloway or multitubular boiler; for 75 horse power  effective the heating surface must be at least 74 square feet. Using  good Cardiff coal, with 4 per cent. of ash, and a heating power of  15,660 Fahr. units; the steam raised will be 8 to 9 pounds per pound of  coal, so that 9,400 to 10,577 Fahr. units are utilized in raising steam,  or 68 to 76 per cent., which is an excellent result. Take an engine of  16 inch cylinder diameter, 40 inch stroke, and 66 revolutions, etc.; it  will use 22.4 pounds of steam per horse power effective, which  represents 2.47 to 2.8 pounds of coal under the boiler. These 10 pounds  of steam carry 11,752 Fahr. units of heat, and produce work equal to 75  horse, or 1,143 Fahr. units of heat; which corresponds to an efficiency  of 9.7 per cent. In a gas motor, on the other hand, we find the  materials employed, as per the above data, to contain 8,958 Fahr. units  of heat, and to make gaseous fuel in which 6,343 units are available; a  return of 70.6 per cent, in the producer. The motor receives these  6,343, and converts 1,143 of them into work; an efficiency of 18 per  cent. In order to be equivalent from the heat point of view, a steam  engine ought to produce a horse power effective per 9.72 pounds of steam  at 5 atmospheres; but no such steam engine exists.    M. Witz goes on with comparative estimates. For a Corliss engine and  boiler, with chimney, etc., complete, and putting these up, he allows  L1,280; for a Simplex gas motor and Dowson producer complete, including  putting up, he allows L1,290, which he explains to be average actual  prices; but these prices do not cover cost of transport, and M. Witz  does not go into cost of masonry for buildings, apart from foundations,  etc., for the apparatus and machinery.    As to water, the gas motor takes 215 cubic feet per horse power  effective. A condensing steam engine uses five times as much.    The lubricating oil used at Rouen was a mixture of Russian oil at 430  fr. per ton, and Ferry and Heduit F.H. oil at 900 fr.; the average was  650 fr. per ton, or 2.8d. per pound. Wanner grease, at 6.4d. per pound,  was used for the moving parts. A steam engine requires less oil for the  cylinder, but the same quantity for the moving parts.    The attendance on the gas motor is too much for one man, not enough to  occupy two; reckon it at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11662"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 598, June 18, 1887 (#12)"],[1,"\"40 cm. kanone L/40,\" will, of  course, be of 15.6 inch caliber, but it will differ from the one above  described in that its length will be equal to 40 times the caliber, say 52  feet, or to the space occupied on the maneuvering ground by a field piece  drawn by six horses (Fig. 1). This gun will be provided with two kinds of  projectiles. One of these, called _light_, will be 31/2 feet in length, weigh  1,628 pounds, and be capable of taking an initial velocity of 2,410 feet  and of piercing, on its exit from the chamber, either a hammered iron plate  33/4 feet in thickness or two united plates 13/4 and 23/4 feet in thickness.    The shell called _heavy_ will be 53/4 feet in length, and weigh 2,310 pounds,  say more than a 43/4 inch siege piece! The charge employed will be 1,067  pounds of brown, prismatic Dunwald powder. Ten hundred and sixty-seven  pounds--nearly half a metric ton, more than the weight of a field piece  without its carriage! With this enormous charge, the heavy shell will be  capable of an initial velocity of 2,100 feet and of piercing, on its exit  from the chamber, either a hammered iron plate 4 feet in thickness or two  united plates 2 and 2.88 feet in thickness.    The _Cologne Gazette_, from which we borrow most of the data just  presented, adds that the \"40 L/40\" piece will be the largest cannon in the  world, but that it will not long enjoy the privilege of such pre-eminence.  It appears, in fact, that Mr. Krupp is preparing to manufacture a gun of  171/2 inch caliber, weighing 330,000 pounds. The projectile for this monster  will be 6 feet in length, say the stature of a full grown man, and will  weigh no less than a ton and a half. A man of medium stature will measure a  little less than this projectile (Fig. 2).    It is possible that all these figures have been slightly exaggerated by the  ultra-Vosges journals, who doubtless intend to make an impression upon us;  but we shall not dwell upon that point.    As regards the penetrating power of the large \"40 L/40\" gun, the German  press observes that in 1868 artillery was incapable of piercing in  one-hundredths of an inch what it is now piercing in tenths of an inch. The  principle was formerly admitted, it says, that a shell should by right have  a thickness equal to its caliber. Now, \"the largest cannon in the world\"  perforates a plate whose thickness is three times the diameter of the gun's  bore. What great progress! exclaim the German journals, and how jealous the  French and English are going to be! Jealous of that? Why, indeed? We are  not the least in the world so. How could we be? In the first place, we have  a gun of very great caliber--a 131/4 inch steel coast and siege piece. This  weighs 37 tons, and is 363/4 feet in length. Its projectile weighs from 924  to 1,320 pounds, according to its internal organization. Its conoid head is  very elongated, and by reason of this elegant form it always falls upon its  point, even at falling angles of an amplitude approaching 60 degrees. The  charge used varies from 396 to 440 pounds, according to the nature of the  powder. As for the ballistic properties of the piece, they are very  remarkable. Its projectile has an initial velocity of 2,132 feet, and the  maximum range is from 10 to 11 miles, say the distance from Paris to  Montgeron by the Paris-Lyons-Mediterranean railroad, or from Paris to  Versailles. Finally, the accuracy of this gun is much greater than that of  the 91/2 inch steel one. Now, the accuracy of this latter is such that it is  impossible for its projectiles to miss a ship under way, and that we are  sure of playing with it against the enemy that game whose device is \"We win  at every shot!\" Well, we do not hesitate to say that these results appear  to us to be satisfactory--we mean quite sufficient--and that there is no  need of looking for a better gun. If there were, French industry would be  capable of producing weapons of any caliber desired. As regards this, there  is, so to speak, no limit; moreover, taking into account merely the  terrestrial conditions of the problem, we may be satisfied that the great  works of our country are more powerfully equipped than those of Essen, and  consequently better able to forge large pieces of steel.    Mr. Krupp, it is said, is very proud of his two power hammers, which he has  named Max and Fritz. But, on the whole, these two apparatus are only fifty  ton ones, and have a fall of but ten feet. Now, Creusot and St. Chamond  each has a hundred ton steam hammer with a fall of 16 feet, accompanied  with four furnaces and four cranes.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--3,300 POUND PROJECTILE OF A KRUPP GUN IN COURSE  OF MANUFACTURE.]    But why proceed to the manufacture of monstrous guns, like those that Mr.  Krupp has just produced, or meditates producing in the future; guns of such  a caliber can be used only in special cases--in battery on the coast or on  board of a ship. It is not with _materiel_ of this kind that war is waged;  it is with field pieces. Our ultra-Vosges neighbors well know this.    One of the reasons that the war that very recently threatened us did not  break out, was because the Germans could not fail to see that their field  _materiel_ was not as powerful as ours; that the shell of our 31/2 inch gun  weighs 171/2 pounds, while that of their heavy 31/2 inch gun does not weigh 15.  Now, this difference has its value.    Hunters well know what importance it is necessary to attach to the number  of the ball that they use.    This granted, it is well to observe that the net cost of the \"40 cm. kanone  L/40\" must not be less than $300,000 or $400,000. Now, on the interest of  such a sum we could have from ten to fifteen complete batteries, that is to  say, comprising, in addition to the sixty or eighty guns, all the necessary  accessories, such as carriages, limbers, caissons, harness, etc.    Frankly, between the two acquisitions, there is no hesitation possible.    Finally, if we must say so, we do not think that foreign powers, when they  believe it their duty to provide themselves with _materiel_ of great  caliber, will think of supplying themselves from the Essen works, on  account of the memorable accidents due to the imperfection of guns coming  from this celebrated establishment. The list of burstings that have  occurred, not only in Germany, but also in Russia, Bohemia, Italy, Turkey,  and Roumania, is already a long one. To speak here only of what occurred  in France in 1870-71, it is certain that out of seventy German guns of  large caliber in battery against the southwest front of the wall of Paris,  thirty-six--say more than half--were put out of service during the first  fifteen days of the bombardment, and that too through firing merely; and it  was the opinion of Mr. De Moltke himself that the German siege batteries  would have been reduced to silence, had the defenders been able to hold out  for a week longer. It is equally certain that, during the course of the  Loire campaign, eighty guns of Prince Frederick Charles' were put out of  service by the sole fact of their firing. Summing up the history of these  many accidents, the Duke of Cambridge asserted to the House of Lords (April  30, 1876) that _two hundred_ Krupp guns burst during the Franco-German war.  Have the engineers of the Essen works improved their processes of  manufacture since that epoch? It is permissible to doubt it, seeing that,  very recently, the Italian navy refused to take from Mr. Krupp some 151/2  inch guns whose tubes were but very imperfectly welded.    Must the numerous accidents mentioned be attributed to defects in the metal  employed? Were they due to defective hooping? Were they due to some one of  the numerous inconveniences inherent to the cylindrico-prismatic system of  closing (_Rundkeilverschluss_)?    They were doubtless owing to such causes combined.--_La Nature_.           *       *       *       *       *          COLORS OF THIN PLATES.      The Right Hon. Lord Rayleigh lately delivered a lecture at the Royal  Institution upon \"The Colors of Thin Plates,\" a term which he explained was  applied to thin films of substances, such as oily films on the surface of  water or the equally familiar soap bubble. Although the reflection of  colors from the surface of a soap bubble is probably the most noticeable,  yet the \"plate\" which lends itself most readily for experiment is a film of  air confined between two sheets of glass. If a ray of white light be  reflected from the surface of the film upon a screen, the so-called  Newton's rings, a series of colored concentric rings, are obtained. If,  instead of reflected light, the ray of light transmitted through the film  of air be allowed to fall upon the screen, the same phenomenon is  observable, but the effect is very considerably minimized, owing to the  great preponderance of white light, which overlies as it were the colored  rings. Even in the first instance, as the lecturer was able to show later  on, the colors are not nearly so intense as they may be obtained, owing to  some white light being reflected from the surfaces of the two sheets of  glass. With regard to the appearance of the phenomenon, it is observed that  the part which corresponds to the thinnest part of the film is considerably  darker than the rest of the spectrum; around this is a bright ring of  white, succeeded by constantly increasing concentric rings of different  colors apparently repeating themselves. Lord Rayleigh also obtained the  same results with a film of a solution of soap and glycerine, but in this  case the dark portion was observed at the top of the spectrum, the other  colors arranging themselves in order in the soap film thinned by the force  of gravitation, thus showing that the colors vary according to the  thickness of the film. Another form of the experiment called forth a  considerable amount of applause from the audience. Lord Rayleigh caused a  gentle stream"]]]
