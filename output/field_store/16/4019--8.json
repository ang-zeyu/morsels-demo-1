And she             said, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare             unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the             bracelets upon her hands.    01:024:048 And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed             the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the             right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.    01:024:049 And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell             me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or             to the left.    01:024:050 Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth             from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.    01:024:051 Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her             be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken.    01:024:052 And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their             words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.    01:024:053 And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of             gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to             her brother and to her mother precious things.    01:024:054 And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him,             and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he             said, Send me away unto my master.    01:024:055 And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with             us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.    01:024:056 And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath             prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.    01:024:057 And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her             mouth.    01:024:058 And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with             this man? And she said, I will go.    01:024:059 And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and             Abraham's servant, and his men.    01:024:060 And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our             sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let             thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.    01:024:061 And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the             camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah,             and went his way.    01:024:062 And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt             in the south country.    01:024:063 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide:             and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels             were coming.    01:024:064 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she             lighted off the camel.    01:024:065 For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that             walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It             is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.    01:024:066 And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.    01:024:067 And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took             Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac             was comforted after his mother's death.    01:025:001 Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.    01:025:002 And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian,             and Ishbak, and Shuah.    01:025:003 And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were             Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.    01:025:004 And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and             Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.    01:025:005 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.    01:025:006 But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had,             Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son,             while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.    01:025:007 And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he             lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.    01:025:008 Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an             old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.    01:025:009 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of             Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the             Hittite, which is before Mamre;    01:025:010 The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there             was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.    01:025:011 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God             blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.    01:025:012 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom             Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:    01:025:013 And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their             names, according to their generations: the firstborn of             Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,    01:025:014 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,    01:025:015 Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:    01:025:016 These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by             their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to             their nations.    01:025:017 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and             thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and             was gathered unto his people.    01:025:018 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt,             as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of             all his brethren.    01:025:019 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham             begat Isaac:    01:025:020 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife,             the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to             Laban the Syrian.    01:025:021 And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was             barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his             wife conceived.    01:025:022 And the children struggled together within her; and she said,             If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the             LORD.    01:025:023 And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and             two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and             the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and             the elder shall serve the younger.    01:025:024 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold,             there were twins in her womb.    01:025:025 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment;             and they called his name Esau.    01:025:026 And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on             Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was             threescore years old when she bare them.    01:025:027 And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the             field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.    01:025:028 And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but             Rebekah loved Jacob.    01:025:029 And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he             was faint:    01:025:030 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same             red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called             Edom.    01:025:031 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.    01:025:032 And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what             profit shall this birthright do to me?    01:025:033 And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him:             and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.    01:025:034 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did             eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau             despised his birthright.    01:026:001 And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine             that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech             king of the Philistines unto Gerar.    01:026:002 And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into             Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:    01:026:003 Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless             thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these             countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto             Abraham thy father;    01:026:004 And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven,             and will give unto thy seed all these countries;

for they are             her near kinswomen: it is wickedness.    03:018:018 Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to             uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time.    03:018:019 Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her             nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness.    03:018:020 Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour's             wife, to defile thyself with her.    03:018:021 And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire             to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I             am the LORD.    03:018:022 Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is             abomination.    03:018:023 Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself             therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie             down thereto: it is confusion.    03:018:024 Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all             these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you:    03:018:025 And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity             thereof upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her             inhabitants.    03:018:026 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and             shall not commit any of these abominations;

            it shall not be accepted.    03:019:008 Therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity,             because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD: and             that soul shall be cut off from among his people.    03:019:009 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not             wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou             gather the gleanings of thy harvest.    03:019:010 And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou             gather every grape of thy vineyard;
