[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1268"],[0,"The Mysterious Island (#12)"],[1," The mole no longer  protected the coast, which was directly exposed to the attacks of the  open sea.    As soon as the sailor and his companions left the precipice, the wind  struck them again with renewed fury. Though bent under the gale they  walked very quickly, following Top, who did not hesitate as to what  direction to take.    They ascended towards the north, having on their left an interminable  extent of billows, which broke with a deafening noise, and on their  right a dark country, the aspect of which it was impossible to guess.  But they felt that it was comparatively flat, for the wind passed  completely over them, without being driven back as it was when it came  in contact with the cliff.    At four o'clock in the morning, they reckoned that they had cleared  about five miles. The clouds were slightly raised, and the wind, though  less damp, was very sharp and cold. Insufficiently protected by their  clothing, Pencroft, Herbert and Spilett suffered cruelly, but not  a complaint escaped their lips. They were determined to follow Top,  wherever the intelligent animal wished to lead them.    Towards five o'clock day began to break. At the zenith, where the fog  was less thick, gray shades bordered the clouds; under an opaque belt, a  luminous line clearly traced the horizon. The crests of the billows were  tipped with a wild light, and the foam regained its whiteness. At the  same time on the left the hilly parts of the coast could be seen, though  very indistinctly.    At six o'clock day had broken. The clouds rapidly lifted. The seaman and  his companions were then about six miles from the Chimneys. They were  following a very flat shore bounded by a reef of rocks, whose heads  scarcely emerged from the sea, for they were in deep water. On the left,  the country appeared to be one vast extent of sandy downs, bristling  with thistles. There was no cliff, and the shore offered no resistance  to the ocean but a chain of irregular hillocks. Here and there grew two  or three trees, inclined towards the west, their branches projecting in  that direction. Quite behind, in the southwest, extended the border of  the forest.    At this moment, Top became very excited. He ran forward, then returned,  and seemed to entreat them to hasten their steps. The dog then left the  beach, and guided by his wonderful instinct, without showing the least  hesitation, went straight in among the downs. They followed him. The  country appeared an absolute desert. Not a living creature was to be  seen.    The downs, the extent of which was large, were composed of hillocks  and even of hills, very irregularly distributed. They resembled a  Switzerland modeled in sand, and only an amazing instinct could have  possibly recognized the way.    Five minutes after having left the beach, the reporter and his two  companions arrived at a sort of excavation, hollowed out at the back of  a high mound. There Top stopped, and gave a loud, clear bark. Spilett,  Herbert, and Pencroft dashed into the cave.    Neb was there, kneeling beside a body extended on a bed of grass.    The body was that of the engineer, Cyrus Harding.        Chapter 8      Neb did not move. Pencroft only uttered one word.    \"Living?\" he cried.    Neb did not reply. Spilett and the sailor turned pale. Herbert clasped  his hands, and remained motionless. The poor Negro, absorbed in his  grief, evidently had neither seen his companions nor heard the sailor  speak.    The reporter knelt down beside the motionless body, and placed his ear  to the engineer's chest, having first torn open his clothes.    A minute--an age!--passed, during which he endeavored to catch the  faintest throb of the heart.    Neb had raised himself a little and gazed without seeing. Despair had  completely changed his countenance. He could scarcely be recognized,  exhausted with fatigue, broken with grief. He believed his master was  dead.    Gideon Spilett at last rose, after a long and attentive examination.    \"He lives!\" said he.    Pencroft knelt in his turn beside the engineer, he also heard a  throbbing, and even felt a slight breath on his cheek.    Herbert at a word from the reporter ran out to look for water. He found,  a hundred feet off, a limpid stream, which seemed to have been greatly  increased by the rains, and which filtered through the sand; but nothing  in which to put the water, not even a shell among the downs. The lad was  obliged to content himself with dipping his handkerchief in the stream,  and with it hastened back to the grotto.    Happily the wet handkerchief was enough for Gideon Spilett, who only  wished to wet the engineer's lips. The cold water produced an almost  immediate effect. His chest heaved and he seemed to try to speak.    \"We will save him!\" exclaimed the reporter.    At these words hope revived in Neb's heart. He undressed his master  to see if he was wounded, but not so much as a bruise was to be found,  either on the head, body, or limbs, which was surprising, as he must  have been dashed against the rocks; even the hands were uninjured, and  it was difficult to explain how the engineer showed no traces of the  efforts which he must have made to get out of reach of the breakers.    But the explanation would come later. When Cyrus was able to speak he  would say what had happened. For the present the question was, how to  recall him to life, and it appeared likely that rubbing would bring this  about; so they set to work with the sailor's jersey.    The engineer, revived by this rude shampooing, moved his arm slightly  and began to breathe more regularly. He was sinking from exhaustion,  and certainly, had not the reporter and his companions arrived, it would  have been all over with Cyrus Harding.    \"You thought your master was dead, didn't you?\" said the seaman to Neb.    \"Yes! quite dead!\" replied Neb, \"and if Top had not found you, and  brought you here, I should have buried my master, and then have lain  down on his grave to die!\"    It had indeed been a narrow escape for Cyrus Harding!    Neb then recounted what had happened. The day before, after having  left the Chimneys at daybreak, he had ascended the coast in a northerly  direction, and had reached that part of the shore which he had already  visited.    There, without any hope he acknowledged, Neb had searched the beach,  among the rocks, on the sand, for the smallest trace to guide him. He  examined particularly that part of the beach which was not covered by  the high tide, for near the sea the water would have obliterated all  marks. Neb did not expect to find his master living. It was for a corpse  that he searched, a corpse which he wished to bury with his own hands!    He sought long in vain. This desert coast appeared never to have been  visited by a human creature. The shells, those which the sea had not  reached, and which might be met with by millions above high-water mark,  were untouched. Not a shell was broken.    Neb then resolved to walk along the beach for some miles. It was  possible that the waves had carried the body to quite a distant point.  When a corpse floats a little distance from a low shore, it rarely  happens that the tide does not throw it up, sooner or later. This Neb  knew, and he wished to see his master again for the last time.    \"I went along the coast for another two miles, carefully examining  the beach, both at high and low water, and I had despaired of finding  anything, when yesterday, above five in the evening, I saw footprints on  the sand.\"    \"Footprints?\" exclaimed Pencroft.    \"Yes!\" replied Neb.    \"Did these footprints begin at the water's edge?\" asked the reporter.    \"No,\" replied Neb, \"only above high-water mark, for the others must have  been washed out by the tide.\"    \"Go on, Neb,\" said Spilett.    \"I went half crazy when I saw these footprints. They were very clear  and went towards the downs. I followed them for a quarter of a mile,  running, but taking care not to destroy them. Five minutes after, as  it was getting dark, I heard the barking of a dog. It was Top, and Top  brought me here, to my master!\"    Neb ended his account by saying what had been his grief at finding the  inanimate body, in which he vainly sought for the least sign of life.  Now that he had found him dead he longed for him to be alive. All his  efforts were useless! Nothing remained to be done but to render the last  duties to the one whom he had loved so much! Neb then thought of his  companions. They, no doubt, would wish to see the unfortunate man again.  Top was there. Could he not rely on the sagacity of the faithful animal?  Neb several times pronounced the name of the reporter, the one among his  companions whom Top knew best.    Then he pointed to the south, and the dog bounded off in the direction  indicated to him.    We have heard how, guided by an instinct which might be looked upon  almost as supernatural, Top had found them.    Neb's companions had listened with great attention to this account.    It was unaccountable to them how Cyrus Harding, after the efforts which  he must have made to escape from the waves by crossing the rocks, had  not received even a scratch. And what could not be explained either was  how the engineer had managed to get to this cave in the downs, more than  a mile from the shore.    \"So, Neb,\" said the reporter, \"it was not you who brought your master to  this place.\"    \"No, it was not I,\" replied the Negro.    \"It's very clear that the captain came here by himself,\" said Pencroft.    \"It is clear in reality,\" observed Spilett, \"but it is not credible!\"    The explanation of this fact could only be produced from the engineer's  own lips, and they must wait for that till speech returned. Rubbing had  re-established the circulation of the blood. Cyrus Harding moved his arm  again, then his head, and a few incomprehensible words escaped him.

There's something in the air that  prevents it. In my town there was a Rabbi who could do _Cabbulah_; he  could call Abraham our father from the grave. But in this pig-eating  country no one can be holy enough for the Name, blessed be It, to grant  him the privilege. I don't believe the _Shochetim_ kill the animals  properly; the statutes are violated; even pious people eat _tripha_  cheese and butter. I don't say thou dost, Meshe, but thou lettest thy  children.\"    \"Well, your own butter is not _kosher_,\" said Moses, nettled.    \"My butter? What does it matter about my butter? I never set up for a  purist. I don't come of a family of Rabbonim. I'm only a business woman.  It's the _froom_ people that I complain of; the people who ought to set  an example, and are lowering the standard of _Froomkeit_. I caught a  beadle's wife the other day washing her meat and butter plates in the  same bowl of water. In time they will be frying steaks in butter, and  they will end by eating _tripha_ meat out of butter plates, and the  judgment of God will come. But what is become of thine apple? Thou hast  not gorged it already?\" Moses nervously pointed to his trousers pocket,  bulged out by the mutilated globe. After his first ravenous bite Moses  had bethought himself of his responsibilities.    \"It's for the _kinder_,\" he explained.    \"_Nu_, the _kinder_!\" snorted Malka disdainfully. \"And what will they  give thee for it? Verily, not a thank you. In my young days we trembled  before the father and the mother, and my mother, peace be upon him,  _potched_ my face after I was a married woman. I shall never forget that  slap--it nearly made me adhere to the wall. But now-a-days our children  sit on our heads. I gave my Milly all she has in the world--a house, a  shop, a husband, and my best bed-linen. And now when I want her to call  the child Yosef, after my first husband, peace be on him, her own  father, she would out of sheer vexatiousness, call it Yechezkel.\"  Malka's voice became more strident than ever. She had been anxious to  make a species of vicarious reparation to her first husband, and the  failure of Milly to acquiesce in the arrangement was a source of real  vexation.    Moses could think of nothing better to say than to inquire how her  present husband was.    \"He overworks himself,\" Malka replied, shaking her head. \"The misfortune  is that he thinks himself a good man of business, and he is always  starting new enterprises without consulting me. If he would only take my  advice more!\"    Moses shook his head in sympathetic deprecation of Michael Birnbaum's  wilfulness.    \"Is he at home?\" he asked.    \"No, but I expect him back from the country every minute. I believe they  have invited him for the _Pidyun Haben_ to-day.\"    \"Oh, is that to-day?\"    \"Of course. Didst thou not know?\"    \"No, no one told me.\"    \"Thine own sense should have told thee. Is it not the thirty-first day  since the birth? But of course he won't accept when he knows that my own  daughter has driven me out of her house.\"    \"You say not!\" exclaimed Moses in horror.    \"I do say,\" said Malka, unconsciously taking up the clothes-brush and  thumping with it on the table to emphasize the outrage. \"I told her that  when Yechezkel cried so much, it would be better to look for the pin  than to dose the child for gripes. 'I dressed it myself, Mother,' says  she. 'Thou art an obstinate cat's head. Milly,' says I. 'I say there  _is_ a pin.' 'And I know better,' says she. 'How canst thou know better  than I?' says I. 'Why, I was a mother before thou wast born.' So I  unrolled the child's flannel, and sure enough underneath it just over  the stomach I found--\"    \"The pin,\" concluded Moses, shaking his head gravely.    \"No, not exactly. But a red mark where the pin had been pricking the  poor little thing.\"    \"And what did Milly say then?\" said Moses in sympathetic triumph.    \"Milly said it was a flea-bite! and I said, 'Gott in Himmel, Milly, dost  thou want to swear my eyes away? My enemies shall have such a  flea-bite.' And because Red Rivkah was in the room, Milly said I was  shedding her blood in public, and she began to cry as if I had committed  a crime against her in looking after her child. And I rushed out,  leaving the two babies howling together. That was a week ago.\"    \"And how is the child?\"    \"How should I know? I am only the grandmother, I only supplied the  bed-linen it was born on.\"    \"But is it recovered from the circumcision?\"    \"Oh, yes, all our family have good healing flesh. It's a fine, child,  _imbeshreer_. It's got my eyes and nose. It's a rare handsome baby,  _imbeshreer_. Only it won't be its mother's fault if the Almighty takes  it not back again. Milly has picked up so many ignorant Lane women who  come in and blight the child, by admiring it aloud, not even saying  _imbeshreer_. And then there's an old witch, a beggar-woman that  Ephraim, my son-in-law, used to give a shilling a week to. Now he only  gives her ninepence. She asked him 'why?' and he said, 'I'm married now.  I can't afford more.' 'What!' she shrieked, 'you got married on my  money!' And one Friday when the nurse had baby downstairs, the old  beggar-woman knocked for her weekly allowance, and she opened the door,  and she saw the child, and she looked at it with her Evil Eye! I hope to  Heaven nothing will come of it.\"    \"I will pray for Yechezkel,\" said Moses.    \"Pray for Milly also, while thou art about it, that she may remember  what is owing to a mother before the earth covers me. I don't know  what's coming over children. Look at my Leah. She _will_ marry that Sam  Levine, though he belongs to a lax English family, and I suspect his  mother was a proselyte. She can't fry fish any way. I don't say anything  against Sam, but still I do think my Leah might have told me before  falling in love with him. And yet see how I treat them! My Michael made  a _Missheberach_ for them in synagogue the Sabbath after the engagement;  not a common eighteen-penny benediction, but a guinea one, with  half-crown blessings thrown in for his parents and the congregation, and  a gift of five shillings to the minister. That was of course in our own  _Chevrah_, not reckoning the guinea my Michael _shnodared_ at Duke's  Plaizer _Shool_. You know we always keep two seats at Duke's Plaizer as  well.\" Duke's Plaizer was the current distortion of Duke's Place.    \"What magnanimity,\" said Moses overawed.    \"I like to do everything with decorum,\" said Malka. \"No one can say I  have ever acted otherwise than as a fine person. I dare say thou couldst  do with a few shillings thyself now.\"    Moses hung his head still lower. \"You see my mother is so poorly,\" he  stammered. \"She is a very old woman, and without anything to eat she may  not live long.\"    \"They ought to take her into the Aged Widows' Home. I'm sure I gave her  _my_ votes.\"    \"God shall bless you for it. But people say I was lucky enough to get  my Benjamin into the Orphan Asylum, and that I ought not to have brought  her from Poland. They say we grow enough poor old widows here.\"    \"People say quite right--at least she would have starved in, a Yiddishe  country, not in a land of heathens.\"    \"But she was lonely and miserable out there, exposed to all the malice  of the Christians. And I was earning a pound a week. Tailoring was a  good trade then. The few roubles I used to send her did not always reach  her.\"    \"Thou hadst no right to send her anything, nor to send for her. Mothers  are not everything. Thou didst marry my cousin Gittel, peace be upon  him, and it was thy duty to support _her_ and her children. Thy mother  took the bread out of the mouth of Gittel, and but for her my poor  cousin might have been alive to-day. Believe me it was no _Mitzvah_.\"    _Mitzvah_ is a \"portmanteau-word.\" It means a commandment and a good  deed, the two conceptions being regarded as interchangeable.    \"Nay, thou errest there,\" answered Moses. \"'Gittel was not a phoenix  which alone ate not of the Tree of Knowledge and lives for ever. Women  have no need to live as long as men, for they have not so many  _Mitzvahs_ to perform as men; and inasmuch as\"--here his tones  involuntarily assumed the argumentative sing-song--\"their souls profit  by all the _Mitzvahs_ performed by their husbands and children, Gittel  will profit by the _Mitzvah_ I did in bringing over my mother, so that  even if she did die through it, she will not be the loser thereby. It  stands in the Verse that _man_ shall do the _Mitzvahs_ and live by them.  To live is a _Mitzvah_, but it is plainly one of those _Mitzvahs_ that  have to be done at a definite time, from which species women, by reason  of their household duties, are exempt; wherefore I would deduce by  another circuit that it is not so incumbent upon women to live as upon  men. Nevertheless, if God had willed it, she would have been still  alive. The Holy One, blessed be He, will provide for the little ones He  has sent into the world. He fed Elijah the prophet by ravens, and He  will never send me a black Sabbath.\"    \"Oh, you are a saint, Meshe,\" said Malka, so impressed that she  admitted him to the equality of the second person plural. \"If everybody  knew as much _Terah_ as you, the Messiah would soon be here. Here are  five shillings. For five shillings you can get a basket of lemons in the  Orange Market in Duke's Place, and if you sell them in the Lane at a  halfpenny each, you will make a good profit. Put aside five shillings of  your takings and get another basket, and so you will be able to live  till the tailoring picks up a bit.\" Moses listened as if he had never  heard of the elementary principles of barter.    \"May the Name, blessed be It, bless you, and may you see rejoicings on  your children's children.\"    So Moses went away and"]]]
