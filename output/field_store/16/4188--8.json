Madness, an epidemic of madness,  which may be compared to that contagious madness which attacked the  people of Europe in the Middle Ages, is at this moment raging in the  Province of San-Paulo. The frightened inhabitants are leaving their  houses, deserting their villages, abandoning their land, saying that  they are pursued, possessed, governed like human cattle by invisible,  though tangible beings, a species of vampire, which feed on their life  while they are asleep, and who, besides, drink water and milk without  appearing to touch any other nourishment.    \"Professor Dom Pedro Henriques, accompanied by several medical savants,  has gone to the Province of San-Paulo, in order to study the origin and  the manifestations of this surprising madness on the spot, and to  propose such measures to the Emperor as may appear to him to be most  fitted to restore the mad population to reason.\"    Ah! Ah! I remember now that fine Brazilian three-master which passed in  front of my windows as it was going up the Seine, on the 8th of last  May! I thought it looked so pretty, so white and bright! That Being was  on board of her, coming from there, where its race sprang from. And it  saw me! It saw my house which was also white, and it sprang from the  ship onto the land. Oh! Good heavens!    Now I know, I can divine. The reign of man is over, and he has come.  He whom disquieted priests exorcised, whom sorcerers evoked on dark  nights, without yet seeing him appear, to whom the presentiments of  the transient masters of the world lent all the monstrous or graceful  forms of gnomes, spirits, genii, fairies, and familiar spirits. After  the coarse conceptions of primitive fear, more clear-sighted men  foresaw it more clearly. Mesmer divined him, and ten years ago physicians  accurately discovered the nature of his power, even before he exercised  it himself. They played with that weapon of their new Lord, the sway  of a mysterious will over the human soul, which had become enslaved.  They called it magnetism, hypnotism, suggestion ... what do I know? I  have seen them amusing themselves like impudent children with this  horrible power! Woe to us! Woe to man! He has come, the ... the ...  what does he call himself ... the ... I fancy that he is shouting  out his name to me and I do not hear him ... the ... yes ... he is  shouting it out ... I am listening ... I cannot ... repeat ... it ...  Horla ... I have heard ... the Horla ... it is he ... the Horla ...  he has come!...    Ah! the vulture has eaten the pigeon, the wolf has eaten the lamb; the  lion has devoured the buffalo with sharp horns; man has killed the lion  with an arrow, with a sword, with gunpowder; but the Horla will make of  man what we have made of the horse and of the ox: his chattel, his  slave and his food, by the mere power of his will. Woe to us!    But, nevertheless, the animal sometimes revolts and kills the man who  has subjugated it.... I should also like ... I shall be able to ... but  I must know him, touch him, see him! Learned men say that beasts' eyes,  as they differ from ours, do not distinguish like ours do ... And my  eye cannot distinguish this newcomer who is oppressing me.    Why? Oh! Now I remember the words of the monk at Mont Saint-Michel:  \"Can we see the hundred-thousandth part of what exists? Look here;  there is the wind which is the strongest force in nature, which knocks  men, and blows down buildings, uproots trees, raises the sea into  mountains of water, destroys cliffs and casts great ships onto the  breakers; the wind which kills, which whistles, which sighs, which  roars--have you ever seen it, and can you see it? It exists for all  that, however!\"    And I went on thinking: my eyes are so weak, so imperfect, that they  do not even distinguish hard bodies, if they are as transparent as  glass!... If a glass without tinfoil behind it were to bar my way, I  should run into it, just as a bird which has flown into a room breaks  its head against the window panes. A thousand things, moreover, deceive  him and lead him astray. How should it then be surprising that he  cannot perceive a fresh body which is traversed by the light?    A new being! Why not? It was assuredly bound to come! Why should we be  the last? We do not distinguish it, like all the others created before  us. The reason is, that its nature is more perfect, its body finer and  more finished than ours, that ours is so weak, so awkwardly conceived,  encumbered with organs that are always tired, always on the strain like  locks that are too complicated, which lives like a plant and like a  beast, nourishing itself with difficulty on air, herbs and flesh, an  animal machine which is a prey to maladies, to malformations, to decay;  broken-winded, badly regulated, simple and eccentric, ingeniously badly  made, a coarse and a delicate work, the outline of a being which might  become intelligent and grand.    We are only a few, so few in this world, from the oyster up to man. Why  should there not be one more, when once that period is accomplished  which separates the successive apparitions from all the different  species?    Why not one more? Why not, also, other trees with immense, splendid  flowers, perfuming whole regions? Why not other elements besides fire,  air, earth and water? There are four, only four, those nursing fathers  of various beings! What a pity! Why are they not forty, four hundred,  four thousand! How poor everything is, how mean and wretched!  grudgingly given, dryly invented, clumsily made! Ah! the elephant and  the hippopotamus, what grace! And the camel, what elegance!    But, the butterfly you will say, a flying flower! I dream of one that  should be as large as a hundred worlds, with wings whose shape, beauty,  colors, and motion I cannot even express. But I see it ... it flutters  from star to star, refreshing them and perfuming them with the light  and harmonious breath of its flight!... And the people up there look  at it as it passes in an ecstasy of delight!...           *       *       *       *       *    What is the matter with me? It is he, the Horla who haunts me, and who  makes me think of these foolish things! He is within me, he is becoming  my soul; I shall kill him!    _August 19th._ I shall kill him. I have seen him! Yesterday I sat down  at my table and pretended to write very assiduously. I knew quite well  that he would come prowling round me, quite close to me, so close that  I might perhaps be able to touch him, to seize him. And then!... then  I should have the strength of desperation; I should have my hands, my  knees, my chest, my forehead, my teeth to strangle him, to crush him,  to bite him, to tear him to pieces. And I watched for him with all my  overexcited organs.    I had lighted my two lamps and the eight wax candles on my mantelpiece,  as if by this light I could have discovered him.    My bed, my old oak bed with its columns, was opposite to me; on my  right was the fireplace; on my left the door which was carefully  closed, after I had left it open for some time, in order to attract  him; behind me was a very high wardrobe with a looking-glass in it,  which served me to make my toilet every day, and in which I was in the  habit of looking at myself from head to foot every time I passed it.    So I pretended to be writing in order to deceive him, for he also was  watching me, and suddenly I felt, I was certain that he was reading  over my shoulder, that he was there, almost touching my ear.    I got up so quickly, with my hands extended, that I almost fell. Eh!  well?... It was as bright as at midday, but I did not see myself in  the glass!... It was empty, clear, profound, full of light! But my  figure was not reflected in it ... and I, I was opposite to it! I saw  the large, clear glass from top to bottom, and I looked at it with  unsteady eyes; and I did not dare to advance; I did not venture to make  a movement, nevertheless, feeling perfectly that he was there, but that  he would escape me again, he whose imperceptible body had absorbed my  reflection.    How frightened I was! And then suddenly I began to see myself through a  mist in the depths of the looking-glass, in a mist as it were through a  sheet of water; and it seemed to me as if this water were flowing  slowly from left to right, and making my figure clearer every moment.  It was like the end of an eclipse. Whatever it was that hid me, did not  appear to possess any clearly defined outlines, but a sort of opaque  transparency, which gradually grew clearer.    At last I was able to distinguish myself completely, as I do every day  when I look at myself.    I had seen it! And the horror of it remained with me and makes me  shudder even now.    _August 20th_. How could I kill it, as I could not get hold of it?  Poison? But it would see me mix it with the water; and then, would our  poisons have any effect on its impalpable body? No ... no ... no doubt  about the matter.... Then?... then?...    _August 21st_. I sent for a blacksmith from Rouen, and ordered iron  shutters of him for my room, such as some private hotels in Paris have  on the ground floor, for fear of thieves, and he is going to make me a  similar door as well. I have made myself out as a coward, but I do not  care about that!...    _September 10th_. Rouen, Hotel Continental. It is done; ... it is  done ... but is he dead? My mind is thoroughly upset by what I have  seen.    Well, then, yesterday the locksmith having put on the iron shutters and  door, I left everything open until midnight, although it was getting  cold.    Suddenly I felt that he was there, and joy, mad joy, took possession of  me. I got up softly, and I walked to the right and left for some time,  so that he might not guess anything; then I took off my boots and put  on my slippers carelessly; then I fastened the iron shutters and going  back to the door quickly I double-locked it with a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12774"],[0,"Dave Darrin's First Year at Annapolis (#12)"],[1," a new life, Dan--a different one and a better one.\"    \"Maybe,\" half assented Dalzell, who was beginning to accumulate  the elements of a \"grouch.\"    \"Dan,\" asked Darrin, as he seated himself at his desk and opened  a book preparatory to a long bit of hard study, \"don't you know  that your bed isn't the regulation place to hang your cap?\"    \"Oh, hang the cap, and the regulations, too!\" grumbled Dalzell.  \"I'm beginning to feel that I've got to break through at some  point.\"    \"Pick up your cap, and put it on its hook--do,\" begged Darrin  coaxingly.    At the same time he looked us with a smile which showed that he  thought his friend was acting in a very juvenile manner.    Something impelled Dan to comply with his chum's request.  Then,  after hanging the cap, with great care, on its nail, the disgruntled  one slipped to the study table and picked up a book.    Just as he did so there came a knock on the door.    Then Lieutenant Stapleton, in white gloves and wearing his sword,  stepped into the room, followed by a midshipman, also white-gloved.    Lieutenant Stapleton was the officer in charge, the young man  the midshipman in charge of the floor.    \"Good morning, gentlemen,\" said the Lieutenant pleasantly, as  both midshipmen promptly rose to their feet and stood at attention.  Dave and Dan remained standing at attention while the lieutenant  stepped quickly about the room, taking in everything with a practiced  glance.    \"Everything in order,\" commented the lieutenant, as he turned  to the door.  \"Resume your work, gentlemen.\"    \"Maybe you're glad you hung your cap up just in time,\" grinned  Dave.    \"Oh, bother the whole scheme!\" grunted Dan \"The idea of a fellow  having to be a jumping-jack all the time!\"    \"A midshipman has to be a jumping-jack, I reckon,\" replied Dave,  \"until he learns to be a man and to live up to discipline as only  a man can.\"    \"See here, do you mean to say--\"    \"Go on with your study of English, unless you're sure you know  all the fine points of the language,\" interrupted Darrin.  \"I  know I don't and I want time to study.\"    Dan gazed steadily at his chum, but Darrin seemed too deeply absorbed  in his work to be conscious of the gaze.    On the whole studies and recitations passed off rather pleasantly  for both chums that day, though both could see that there were  breakers ahead.    After supper a few minutes were allowed for recreation, which  consisted mostly of an opportunity for the midshipmen to chat  with each other.  Then came the call that sent them to their rooms  to study for two solid hours.    \"I wish the powers that be would let us sit up an hour later,\"  sighed Dave, looking up from his book in the middle of the study  period.    \"I'd rather they'd let us sleep an hour later in the morning,\"  grumbled Dan.    \"But, really, it would be great to have chance to study an hour  more each evening,\" insisted Dave.    \"Huh!\"    \"Yes; I begin to feel that we're going to need more study time  than we get, if we're ever to pass.\"    At 9.30 the release bell rang.  Dan closed his book with a joyful  bang, Darrin closing his much more reluctantly.    \"I'm going visiting,\" declared Dalzell, starting toward the door.    Before he could reach the door, however, there sounded a slight  knock and two midshipmen of the third class stepped in.    \"Mister, what's your name?\" demanded one of the visitors.    \"Dalzell, sir,\" replied Dan, standing at attention.    \"What's yours, mister?    \"Darrin, sir.\"    \"Stand on your head, mister.\"    Dave obeyed with good-natured speed.    \"That will do, mister.  Now, on your head, mister.\"    Dan made a grimace, but obeyed.    Then the other visitor demanded:    \"Do either of you fourth class men intend to try to be ratey?\"    \"No, sir,\" replied Darrin promptly.    \"Do you, mister?\" turning to Dalzell.    \"No, sir.\"    \"Are you both a bit touge?\" asked the youngster questioner.    \"I hope not, sir,\" replied Dave.    \"Do you feel that way, mister?\"--looking at Dan.    \"What way, sir?\"    \"Do you feel inclined to be touge, mister?\"    \"I'm willing to be anything that's agreeable, and not too much  work, sir,\" replied Dan, grinning.    It is offensive for a fourth class man to grin in the presence  of an upper class man.    Moreover, two other youngsters had just stepped into the room  to watch proceedings.    \"Mister,\" commanded the youngster whom Dan had answered, \"wipe  that grin off your face.\"    Dalzell drew out his handkerchief, making several elaborate passes  across his countenance with it.    \"Touge!\" growled his inquisitor.    \"Very touge, indeed,\" assented the other three youngsters.    \"Why did you bring out your handkerchief, mister?\"    \"Just obeying orders,\" replied Dan, with another grin.    \"Wipe that grin off your face, sir!--no, not with your handkerchief!\"    So Dalzell thrust the handkerchief away and applied his blouse  sleeve to his face.    \"Stop that, mister!    \"Yes, sir,\" replied Dalzell meekly.    \"Don't you know how to wipe a grin off your face?\"    \"I'm not sure, sir,\" Dan admitted.    \"Mister, you are wholly touge!  I'm not sure but that you're a  ratey plebe as well.\"    Thereupon Youngster Quimby plunged into a scathing lecture on  the subject of a plebe being either touge or ratey.  At first  Dan listened with a becoming air of respect.  Before long, however,  a huge grin began to illumine Dalzell's face.    \"Wipe that grin off, mister!\" commanded Mr. Quimby sternly.    \"I--I simply can't!\" gasped Dan, then began to roar with laughter.    \"Why can't you?\" insisted Quimby.  \"What's the matter?    \"It's--it's your face!\" choked Dan.    \"My face?\" repeated Quimby, reddening \"What do you mean, sir?\"    \"I--I--it would be a shame to tell you!\" sputtered Dalzell between  spasms of laughter.    Truth to tell, Midshipman Quimby did look funny when he attempted  to be over-stern.  Quimby's face was one of his sensitive points,  anyway.  Yet it was not, strictly speaking, the face, but the  look of precocious authority on that face which had sent Dan,  with his keen sense of humor, off into spasms of laughter.  But  the youngster didn't propose to see the point.    \"Mister,\" spoke Midshipman Quimby, with an added sternness of  look that sent Dan off into another guffaw, \"you have been guilty  of insulting an upper class man.  Your offense has been so  serious--so rank--that I won't accept an apology.  You shall  fight, mister!\"    \"When?  Whom?\" asked Dan, the big grin still on his face.    \"_Me_, mister--and as soon as the thing can be pulled off.\"    \"Oh, all right, sir,\" nodded Dalzell.  \"Any time you like, then,  sir.  I've been accustomed, before coming here, to getting most  of my exercise out of fighting.  But--pardon me, if I meet, I  shall have to hit--pardon me--that face.\"    \"Call this plebe out, Quimby, and trim him in good shape,\" urged  one of the other youngsters present.  \"He's touge all the way  through.  He'll need trimming.\"    \"And he'll get it, too,\" wrathfully promised Midshipman Quimby, who  was rated high as a fighter at the Naval Academy.          CHAPTER X    \"JUST FOR EXERCISE\"      \"Now, then, mister, keep your eyes on my humorous face!\"    It was the next evening, over behind the old government hospital.    Midshipman Quimby had just stepped forward, from the hands of  his seconds, two men of the third class.    \"I can't keep my eyes away from that face, and my hands are aching  to follow the same route, sir,\" grimaced Dalzell.    He, too, had just stepped forward from the preliminary care of  Dave and of Rollins, for that latter fourth class man was as anxious  to see this fight as he had been the other one.    \"Stop your talk, mister,\" commanded Midshipman Ferris, of the  second class, who was present to officiate as referee.  \"On the  field you talk with your hands.  Don't be touge all the time,  or you'll soon have a long fight calendar.\"    \"Very good, sir,\" nodded Dan, his manner suddenly most respectful--as  far as appearance went.    Dave Darrin did not by any means approve his chum's conduct of  the night before, but Dave was on hand as second, just the same,  and earnestly hoping that Dan might get at least his share of  the honors in the event that was now to be \"pulled off.\"    \"Gentlemen,\" began Mr. Ferris, in the monotonous way of referees,  \"this fight is to be to a finish, without gloves.  Hand-shaking  will be dispensed with.  Are you ready?\"    \"Ready!\" assented both.    \"Time!\"    Both men advanced warily.    Quimby knew well enough that he could whip the plebe, but he didn't  intend to let Dalzell get in any blows that could be guarded against.    Both men danced about until Mr. Ferris broke in, rather impatiently:    \"Stop eating chocolates and mix it up!\"    \"Like this, sir?\" questioned Dan.  Darting in, on a feint, he  followed Quimby's block with a blow that jolted the youngster's  chin.    Then Dan slipped away again, grinning gleefully, well aware that  nothing would anger Quimby more easily than would that same grin.  \"I'll wipe that disgrace off your face myself,\" growled Quimby,  closing in briskly.    \"Come over here and get it,\" taunted Dan, showing some of his  neatest footwork.    Quimby sent in three blows fast; two of them Dalzell blocked,  but one hit him on the chest, staggering him slightly.  Midshipman  Quimby started to follow up his advantage.  In another moment,  however, he was backing away with a cut lip.    \"There's something to wipe off your own face,\" suggested Dan,  grinning harder than ever.    Stung, Mr. Quimby made strenuous efforts to pay back with worse coin.  He was still trying when the call of time sounded.    \"You didn't half go in after him, Dan,\" murmured Dave, as the latter  and Rollins quickly toweled their man in the corner.    \"If I had, I might have gotten more of him than I wanted,\" muttered  Dalzell.    \"Why don't you mix it up faster?\" queried Rollins.    \"Because,\" proclaimed Midshipman Dan, \"I don't want to fight"]]]
