The test for this admission was  setting an antiphon in four parts. Wolfgang was locked in a room till  the task should be finished. To the astonishment of everybody he asked  to be let out at the end of half an hour,--having completed the work.    The travelers now proceeded to Milan, where Mozart was to work on his  first opera, for which he had received a commission. It was a great  task for a boy to accomplish and we find the young composer writing  to his mother and sister to pray for his success. The opera was called  \"Mitridate,\" and was finished after three months' hard work. The first  performance was given in Milan, December 26, 1770, and was conducted  by Wolfgang himself. It was a proud, happy day for the father, indeed  for the whole family. \"Mitridate\" succeeded beyond their hopes; it was  given twenty times before crowded houses; and its success brought an  election to the Accademia, and also a commission to write a dramatic  Serenata for an approaching royal wedding. This work also was a great  success. The Empress who had commissioned Mozart to compose the work  was so pleased, that besides the promised fee, she gave the composer a  gold watch with her portrait set in diamonds on the back.    Sunshine and success had followed the gifted boy through all his  travels; but now shadows and disappointments were to come, due to  jealousy, intrigue and indifference of those in power who might have  helped him but failed to recognize his genius. Shortly after the  return of the father and son to their home town of Salzburg, their  protector and friend, the good Archbishop of Salzburg, died. His  successor was indifferent to art and held in contempt those who  followed it as a profession. He persistently refused to appoint the  young musician to any office worthy his talent or to recognize his  gifts in any way. While Mozart remained at home in Salzburg, hoping  his prospects would improve, he worked at composing with untiring  diligence. By the time he was twenty-one he had accumulated a mass  of music that embraced every branch of the art. He had a growing  reputation as a composer but no settled future. He had the post of  concertmaster, it is true, but the salary was but a trifle and he  was often pressed for money. Leopold therefore decided to undertake  another professional tour with his son. The Archbishop however  prevented the father leaving Salzburg. So the only course left open  was to allow Wolfgang and his mother to travel together. They set out  on the morning of September 23, 1777. Wolfgang's spirits rose as the  town of Salzburg faded into the haze of that September morning; the  sense of freedom was exhilarating; he had escaped the place associated  in his mind with tyranny and oppression, to seek his fortune in new  and wider fields.    At Munich where they first halted, Wolfgang sought an engagement  at the Elector's Court. He had an audience at the Nymphenburg, a  magnificent palace on the outskirts of the city. The Elector said  there was no vacancy; he did not know but later it might be possible  to make one, after Mozart had been to Italy and had made a name for  himself. With these words the Elector turned away. Mozart stood as  if stunned. To Italy, when he had concertized there for about seven  years, and had been showered with honors! It was too much. He shook  off the dust of Munich and he and his mother went on to Mannheim.  Here was a more congenial atmosphere. The Elector maintained a fine  orchestra, and with the conductor, Cannabich, Mozart became great  friends, giving music lessons to his daughter. But he could not seem  to secure a permanent appointment at Court, worthy his genius and  ability. Money became more scarce and the father and sister must make  many sacrifices at home to send money to maintain mother and son. With  the best of intentions Wolfgang failed to make his way except as a  piano teacher. The father had resorted to the same means of securing  the extra sums required, and wrote quite sharply to the son to bestir  himself and get something settled for the future.    For the young genius, Mannheim possessed a special attraction of which  the father knew nothing. Shortly after their arrival in the city,  Wolfgang became acquainted with the Weber family. The two oldest  daughters, Aloysia, fifteen, and Constanza, fourteen, were charming  girls just budding into womanhood. Aloysia had a sweet, pure voice,  and was studying for the stage; indeed she had already made her debut  in opera. It was not at all strange that young Mozart, who often  joined the family circle, should fall in love with the girl's fair  beauty and fresh voice, should write songs for her and teach her  to sing them as he wished. They were much together and their early  attraction fast ripened into love. Wolfgang formed a project for  helping the Webers, who were in rather straitened circumstances, by  undertaking a journey to Italy in company with Aloysia and her father;  he would write an opera in which Aloysia should appear as prima donna.  Of this brilliant plan he wrote his father, saying they could stop in  Salzburg on the way, when the father and Nannerl could meet the fair  young singer, whom they would be sure to love.    Leopold Mozart was distracted at news of this project. He at once  wrote, advising his son to go to Paris and try there to make a name  and fame for himself. The son dutifully yielded at once. With a heavy  heart he prepared to leave Mannheim, where he had spent such a happy  winter, and his love dream came to an end. It was a sad parting with  the Weber household, for they regarded Wolfgang as their greatest  benefactor.    The hopes Leopold Mozart had built on Wolfgang's success in Paris were  not to be realized. The enthusiasm he had aroused as a child prodigy  was not awarded to the matured musician. Three months passed away in  more or less fruitless endeavor. Then the mother, who had been his  constant companion in these trials and travels, fell seriously ill. On  July 3, 1778, she passed away in her son's arms.    Mozart prepared to leave Paris at once, and his father was the  more willing, since the Archbishop of Salzburg offered Wolfgang  the position of Court organist, at a salary of 500 florins, with  permission to absent himself whenever he might be called upon to  conduct his own operas. Leopold urged Wolfgang's acceptance, as their  joint income would amount to one thousand florins a year--a sum that  would enable them to pay their debts and live in comparative comfort.    To Mozart the thought of settling down in Salzburg under the  conditions stated in his father's letter was distasteful, but he had  not the heart to withstand his father's appeal. He set out from Paris  at once, promising himself just one indulgence before entering the  bondage which lay before him, a visit to his friends the Webers at  Mannheim. When he arrived there he found they had gone to Munich to  live. Therefore he pushed on to Munich. The Weber family received him  as warmly as of old, but in Aloysia's eyes there was only a friendly  greeting, nothing more. A few short months had cooled her fickle  attachment for the young composer. This discovery was a bitter  trial to Wolfgang and he returned to his Salzburg home saddened by  disappointed love and ambition.    Here in his old home he was cheered by a rapturous welcome; it was  little short of a triumph, this greeting and homage showered on him by  father, sister and friends. In their eyes his success was unshadowed  by failure; to them he was Mozart the great composer, the genius among  musicians. He was very grateful for these proofs of affection and  esteem, but he had still the same aversion to Salzburg and his Court  duties. So it was with new-kindled joy that he set out once more for  Munich, in November, 1780, to complete and produce the opera he had  been commissioned to write for the carnival the following year.    The new opera, \"Idomeneo,\" fulfilled the high expectations his Munich  friends had formed of the composer's genius. Its reception at the  rehearsals proved success was certain, and the Elector who was  present, joined the performers in expressing his unqualified approval.  At home the progress of the work was followed with deepest interest.  The first performance of \"Idomeneo\" took place on January 29, 1781.  Leopold and Marianne journeyed to Munich to witness Wolfgang's  triumph. It was a proud, happy moment for all three; the enthusiastic  acclaim which shook the theater seemed to the old father, who watched  with swimming eyes the sea of waving hands around him, to set the seal  of greatness on his son's career.    The Archbishop, under whom Mozart held the meager office we have  spoken of, grew more overbearing in his treatment; he was undoubtedly  jealous that great people of Vienna were so deferential to one of his  servants, as he chose to call him. At last the rupture came; after a  stormy scene Mozart was dismissed from his service, and was free.    Father Mozart was alarmed when he heard the news of the break, and  endeavored to induce Wolfgang to reconsider his decision and return to  Salzburg. But the son took a firm stand for his independence. \"Do not  ask me to return to Salzburg,\" he wrote his father; \"ask me anything  but that.\"    And now came a time of struggling for Mozart. His small salary was cut  off and he had but one pupil. He had numerous friends, however, and  soon his fortunes began to mend. He was lodging with his old friends  the Webers. Aloysia, his former beloved, had married; Madame Weber  and her two unmarried daughters were now in Vienna and in reduced  circumstances. Mozart's latest opera, \"The Elopement,\" had brought  him fame both in Vienna and Prague, and he had the patronage of many  distinguished persons, as well as that of Emperor Josef.    Mozart had now decided to make a home for himself, and chose as his  bride Constanza Weber, a younger"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13300"],[0,"The Doctrine and Practice of Yoga (#12)"],[1,"destroy  negative brain-cells is to develop positive brain-cells. If you want to  _Kill off Fear-thoughts_, do not fight them. That would be like trying to  realise how dark a place is and then starting to pitch it out by the  handful. You know you cannot do it. Just open the blinds and let in  sunshine and the place will be flooded with light. The mind hypnotised  by negative thoughts has been compared by a mental scientist to a dirty  wash-bowl full of dirty water. Take the wash-bowl near a tap and turn  the tap on. The steady pour of clean water will soon wash off all the  dirty water and fill the wash-bowl with clear water. So the only way  to root out and destroy evil thoughts is to turn a steady stream of  positive thoughts. To overcome all fear thoughts, you should think  courage-thoughts. Don't crawl on your belly; don't call upon Heaven to  witness what a despicable creature you are. No--a thousand times--no. Act  Courage. Think Courage. Say Courage. That's the way. Turn your face  towards the rising sun. Take \"Courage\" for your watchword. Affirm  it as far as you can. Fasten it deep and strong in your mind. Always tell  yourself that you are full of courage, morning, noon and night; never  tell yourself that you are weak.    Now, in order to inhibit fear-thoughts and exhibit Courage-thoughts,  you must possess CONCENTRATION. You should be able to take your mind off  a certain subject and put it on something else at your will. Do you know  what Concentration means? Let me give you in my own words something I  remember reading about Napoleon. When banished to St. Helena and  suffering from disease, one day his doctor expressed his curiosity as to  the secret of his success and astonishing power. Napoleon replied  \"Doctor, there are drawers in my brain. When I want to think of politics  I pull out the drawer of politics, when I want to think of Josephine, I  pull out the drawer of Law, and so on; and when I shut all these drawers,  I can go to sleep.\" The doctor smiled incredulity blandly. \"Doctor, I can  show you this minute. Doctor, I shut all drawers\"--even while saying  this, Napoleon fell with a thud on his pillow. He was fast asleep. The  man of science and medicine examined him in all ways, but Napoleon had  fallen actually fast asleep. This is Concentration and Mind-Control. I  don't admire men of Napoleon's selfish types. Their place is in dark  hell. They use their power for preying upon others. But that his powers  of mind were great, I don't deny. Napoleon in his past life had been a  great Yogi, but the remnants of self and cumulative force of bad Karma  precipitated the bloody results you all know in connection with  Napoleon's career. No doubt, this man was only a means used by God to  bring about certain changes and revolutions.    To develop Concentration, pay attention to the daily work of your life.  Don't neglect small things. Put interest and attention into whatever  you think, say, or do. Be a wide-awake man. Don't go about your work  half-asleep. Wake up and display a few signs of life. Be progressive.  Think much and to the purpose.    WILL-POWER.    You all understand this. It is that aspect of your make-up that enables  you to make your mind and body obey you. The true principle of Will is  closely interlocked with the \"I am I\" as I have already explained it.  Resolve at the start to do one thing once in 24 hours that you would do  if you were not afraid. Face fear and it is your slave. Your Will-power  enables you to prove things practically to yourself and to the world; to  make actions match-thoughts. Give your Will much exercise in the right  direction. Without Will a man is no better than a log of wood. Keep  your Will strong by auto-suggestion and exercise. Try the powers of your  Will on your personality till you can do anything and be anything. Say \"I  can and I will\" in a thousand different ways and prove it too. The  requisite qualities that form valuable adjuncts to Will-power are:  1. Determination. 2. Stick-to-it-ive-ness. 3. Perseverance. 4. Invincible  and indomitable courage. 5. Non-attachment. 6. Faith in yourself.  7. Faith in God. 8. I can and I will. Repeat this affirmation often till  it becomes a constant mental trait.    AFFIRMATIONS.    1. I am fearless. I am full of courage. There is nothing to fear.  I say courage, I think, I act courage.    2. Courage is my distinct and leading trait. Everyone knows me  as a man of Indomitable courage. The criticisms and opinions of others  cannot affect me the least.    3. I am part of the Divine Self. I harm none. My nature knows  no harm. Hence no harm comes to me.    4. I am equal to anything. Nothing can crush my spirit. I can  face everything. I can face everybody.    5. My powers of resistance are strong, strong, strong. I use them  never for the aggression of others. They are for my self-defence.    6. I am absolutely fearless morally and physically.    7. I stand for absolute truthfulness and justice and manifest them  in myself.    8. Work with this affirmation. Strongly implant it in your mind.  The use of strong, positive Affirmation in the Silence is valuable in  that it gives you a firm hold of your thought so that you can \"carry the  thought\" mentally. The value of expressing thought in act and speech lies  in this that it clinches your thought into a permanent habit. Remember  this psychologic axiom: 1. Thoughts take form in action. 2. Action  induces thought and corresponding habits. Therefore act out the part  physically. If you want a courageous mind--\"act out\" the part physically,  in your daily life, on suitable occasions, in all earnestness as you  would in a theatre or drama. In a very short time it shall become a  confirmed habit. Force yourself to it. Take an interest in what you do  and say. Have confident expectations of SUCCESS. Never be daunted and  cowed down by initial difficulties and failures. Never say die. If you  go down--don't remain lying and moaning. Never, I say, never. Get up.  Shake yourself up free and say, like the royal lion \"Come one, come all,  this rock shall fly sooner from its base than I.\" Have a will of your  own and be a force for good. Exercise your Will-power. Be something.  Do something.    LOVE FOR HUMANITY, ENERGY, ASPIRATION, SELF-ESTEEM.    I cannot too strongly emphasise the difference between Self-Esteem  and Self-Conceit. I wish to drive and thoroughly pound this difference  into your brain. Self-Esteem is decidedly a manly trait. It is based  upon a conviction of the Kingship of God and the Sonship of Man. Man  is a dignified being with divine attributes. He should not disgrace his  Maker by crawling on the ground. This is Self-Esteem. Self-Esteem  does not lower itself. It never lowers others. You shall never see a  leader of mankind without tremendous faith in himself. But equally truly  you shall never see a true man or woman taking delight in having others  crawl to dust before them. They feel pained and shocked at such a sight.  There is infinite humiliation to them in this sorry spectacle. But  Self-Conceit is that original obliquity that leads a man to make a hog of  himself. It is the old, dirty, unmanly \"I-am-greater-than-you\" feeling.  Such men are hogs, hogs, hogs. They are not the true sons of their  mothers. They are bastards and imbeciles. If you come across this type  and get a chance to deal with him on your private strength open his eyes  to his hoggishness. If he has any manly stuff in himself, he shall  reform. If not, let him sizzle in his fat. Nature and its rigorous Laws  will rub the lesson home some day. But don't you stand their nonsense for  want of moral backbone. And the \"I am\" in you shall revolt against any  such meanness and smallness in yourself. Encourage it not. Revere God.  Revere yourself. Revere others. Next, as to energy and aspiration--these  two characteristics transmute your mind from a negative into a positive  type. They give you an aura of thought-force such as never knows fear. In  point of fact fear is starved off to death. Be progressive. Take an  interest in the affairs of this world and be a force for good. Raise  yourself first. Then give others a lift. Have an Increasing Purpose  in your life. Work towards its accomplishment. The man who renounces the  world does not become a burden unto others. He helps others to shoulder  their responsibilities. Nature aids at building up strong individuals. It  has no use for barnacles and is always scraping them off. Nature does not  tolerate leeches, vampires and parasites. Aspire to do something great in  life \"for the good of many, for the happiness of many.\" Live to some  purpose. When you have a positive life-purpose, your tone of mind shall  be dominant and positive and your thoughts shall match. All-strength  shall come to you. Bad health, fear, worry and the whole array of  disintegrating forces are set into active motion by a purposeless life.  The Purposeful Man has no time to bother about them. Understand clearly,  spirituality is not laziness, whatever else it may be.    AFFIRMATIONS.    1. I have perfect Self-Confidence. I am a Divine Being. I lower  not myself--I lower not others.    2. My Life-Purpose is Constructive--not Destructive.    3. I will be great spiritually and mentally. I will make others  great. I am an irresistible force for good.    4. I live to some great purpose. I am an Individual. I recognise  the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of man.    HEALTH, CHASTITY AND SELF-CONTROL.    Chastity and Self-Control bring to you a clean healthy physique. Strong  health means strong brain. And strong brain means abounding vitality,  magnetism and ambition. Remember our aim is the development of courage.  The Chaste brain has tremendous energy. You should observe  Bramhacharya--the conservation of vital energy in the body. You should  acquire control over your passions and appetites. The energy generated in  your body should not be drawn"]]]
