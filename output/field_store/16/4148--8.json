He found himself looking out upon the leads of Albemarle Street.  No stars and no moon showed through the grey clouds draping the wintry  sky, but a dim and ghostly half-light nevertheless rendered the ugly  expanse visible from where he stood.    On one side loomed a huge tank, to the brink of which a rickety wooden  ladder invited the explorer to ascend. Beyond it were a series of iron  gangways and ladders forming part of the fire emergency arrangements of  the neighboring institution. Straight ahead a section of building jutted  up and revealed two small windows, which seemed to regard him like  watching eyes.    He walked out on to the roof, looking all about him. Beyond the tank  opened a frowning gully--the Arcade connecting Albemarle Street with  old Bond Street; on the other hand, the scheme of fire gangways was  continued. He began to cross the leads, going in the direction of Bond  Street. Coombes watched him from the study. When he came to the more  northerly of the two windows which had attracted his attention, he knelt  down and flashed the ray of his torch through the glass.    A kind of small warehouse was revealed, containing stacks of packages.  Immediately inside the window was a rough wooden table, and on  this table lay a number of smaller packages, apparently containing  cigarettes.    Kerry turned his attention to the fastening of the window. A glance  showed him that it was unlocked. Resting the torch on the leads, he  grasped the sash and gently raised the window, noting that it opened  almost noiselessly. Then, taking up the torch again, he stooped and  stepped in on to the table below.    It moved slightly beneath his weight. One of the legs was shorter  than its fellows. But he reached the floor as quietly as possible, and  instantly snapped off the light of the torch.    A heavy step sounded from outside--someone was mounting the stairs--and  a disk of light suddenly appeared upon the ground-glass panel of the  door.    Kerry stood quite still, chewing steadily.    \"Who's there?\" came the voice of the constable posted on Kazmah's  landing.    The inspector made no reply.    \"Is there anyone here?\" cried the man.    The disk of light disappeared, and the alert constable could be heard  moving along the corridor to inspect the other offices. But the ray had  shone upon the frosted glass long enough to enable Kerry to read the  words painted there in square black letters. They had appeared reversed,  of course, and had read thus:    .OC ETTERAGIC SINABUC        CHAPTER XI. THE DRUG SYNDICATE    At six-thirty that morning Margaret Halley was aroused by her maid--the  latter but half awake--and sitting up in bed and switching on the lamp,  she looked at the card which the servant had brought to her, and read  the following:        CHIEF INSPECTOR KERRY,      C.I.D.      New Scotland Yard, S.W.I.    \"Oh, dear,\" she said sleepily, \"what an appallingly early visitor. Is  the bath ready yet, Janet?\"    \"I'm afraid not,\" replied the maid, a plain, elderly woman of the  old-fashioned useful servant type. \"Shall I take a kettle into the  bathroom?\"    \"Yes--that will have to do. Tell Inspector Kerry that I shall not be  long.\"    Five minutes later Margaret entered her little consulting-room, where  Kerry, having adjusted his tie, was standing before the mirror in the  overmantle, staring at a large photograph of the charming lady doctor  in military uniform. Kerry's fierce eyes sparkled appreciatively as his  glance rested on the tall figure arrayed in a woollen dressing-gown, the  masculine style of which by no means disguised the beauty of Margaret's  athletic figure. She had hastily arranged her bright hair with  deliberate neglect of all affectation. She belonged to that ultra-modern  school which scorns to sue masculine admiration, but which cannot  dispense with it nevertheless. She aspired to be assessed upon an  intellectual basis, an ambition which her unfortunate good looks  rendered difficult of achievement.    \"Good morning, Inspector,\" she said composedly. \"I was expecting you.\"    \"Really, miss?\" Kerry stared curiously. \"Then you know what I've come  about?\"    \"I think so. Won't you sit down? I am afraid the room is rather cold. Is  it about--Sir Lucien Pyne?\"    \"Well,\" replied Kerry, \"it concerns him certainly. I've been in  communication by telephone with Hinkes, Mr. Monte Irvin's butler, and  from him I learned that you were professionally attending Mrs. Irvin.\"    \"I was not her regular medical adviser, but--\"    Margaret hesitated, glancing rapidly at the Inspector, and then down  at the writing-table before which she was seated. She began to tap the  blotting-pad with an ivory paper-knife. Kerry was watching her intently.    \"Upon your evidence, Miss Halley,\" he said rapidly, \"may depend the life  of the missing woman.\"    \"Oh!\" cried Margaret, \"whatever can have happened to her? I rang up as  late as two o'clock this morning; after that I abandoned hope.\"    \"There's something underlying the case that I don't understand, miss. I  look to you to put me wise.\"    She turned to him impulsively.    \"I will tell you all I know, Inspector,\" she said. \"I will be perfectly  frank with you.\"    \"Good!\" rapped Kerry. \"Now--you have known Mrs. Monte Irvin for some  time?\"    \"For about two years.\"    \"You didn't know her when she was on the stage?\"    \"No. I met her at a Red Cross concert at which she sang.\"    \"Do you think she loved her husband?\"    \"I know she did.\"    \"Was there any--prior attachment?\"    \"Not that I know of.\"    \"Mr. Quentin Gray?\"    Margaret smiled, rather mirthlessly.    \"He is my cousin, Inspector, and it was I who introduced him to  Rita Irvin. I sincerely wish I had never done so. He lost his head  completely.\"    \"There was nothing in Mrs. Irvin's attitude towards him to justify her  husband's jealousy?\"    \"She was always frightfully indiscreet, Inspector, but nothing more.  You see, she is greatly admired, and is used to the company of silly,  adoring men. Her husband doesn't really understand the ways of these  Bohemian folks. I knew it would lead to trouble sooner or later.\"    \"Ah!\"    Chief Inspector Kerry thrust his hands into the pockets of his jacket.    \"Now--Sir Lucien?\"    Margaret tapped more rapidly with the paper-knife.    \"Sir Lucien belonged to a set of which Rita had been a member during her  stage career. I think--he admired her; in fact, I believe he had offered  her marriage. But she did not care for him in the least--in that way.\"    \"Then in what way did she care for him?\" rapped Kerry.    \"Well--now we are coming to the point.\" Momentarily she hesitated, then:  \"They were both addicted--\"    \"Yes?\"    \"--to drugs.\"    \"Eh?\" Kerry's eyes grew hard and fierce in a moment. \"What drugs?\"    \"All sorts of drugs. Shortly after I became acquainted with Rita Irvin  I learned that she was a victim of the drug habit, and I tried to cure  her. I regret to say that I failed. At that time she had acquired a  taste for opium.\"    Kerry said not a word, and Margaret raised her head and looked at him  pathetically.    \"I can see that you have no pity for the victims of this ghastly vice,  Inspector Kerry,\" she said.    \"I haven't!\" he snapped fiercely. \"I admit I haven't, miss. It's bad  enough in the heathens, but for an Englishwoman to dope herself is  downright unchristian and beastly.\"    \"Yet I have come across so many of these cases, during the war and  since, that I have begun to understand how easy, how dreadfully easy it  is, for a woman especially, to fall into the fatal habit. Bereavement or  that most frightful of all mental agonies, suspense, will too often lead  the poor victim into the path that promises forgetfulness. Rita Irvin's  case is less excusable. I think she must have begun drug-taking because  of the mental and nervous exhaustion resulting from late hours and  over-much gaiety. The demands of her profession proved too great for  her impaired nervous energy, and she sought some stimulant which would  enable her to appear bright on the stage when actually she should have  been recuperating, in sleep, that loss of vital force which can be  recuperated in no other way.\"    \"But opium!\" snapped Kerry.    \"I am afraid her other drug habits had impaired her will, and shaken her  self-control. She was tempted to try opium by its promise of a new and  novel excitement.\"    \"Her husband, I take it, was ignorant of all this?\"    \"I believe he was. Quentin--Mr. Gray--had no idea of it either.\"    \"Then it was Sir Lucien Pyne who was in her confidence in the matter?\"    Margaret nodded slowly, still tapping the blotting-pad.    \"He used to accompany her to places where drugs could be obtained, and  on several occasions--I cannot say how many--I believe he went with her  to some den in Chinatown. It may have been due to Mr. Irvin's discovery  that his wife could not satisfactorily account for some of these  absences from home which led him to suspect her fidelity.\"    \"Ah!\" said Kerry hardly, \"I shouldn't wonder. And now\"--he thrust out a  pointing finger--\"where did she get these drugs?\"    Margaret met the fierce stare composedly.    \"I have said that I shall be quite frank,\" she replied. \"In my opinion  she obtained them from Kazmah.\"    \"Kazmah!\" shouted Kerry. \"Excuse me, miss, but I see I've been wearing  blinkers without knowing it! Kazmah's was a dope-shop?\"    \"That has been my belief for a long time, Inspector. I may add that I  have never been able to obtain a shred of evidence to prove it. I am so  keenly interested in seeing the people who pander to this horrible vice  unmasked and dealt with as they merit, that I have tried many times to  find out if my suspicion was correct.\"    Inspector Kerry was writhing his shoulders excitedly. \"Did you ever  visit Kazmah?\" he asked.    \"Yes. I asked Rita Irvin to take me, but she"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1183"],[0,"The Return of Dr. Fu-Manchu (#12)"],[1,"for the past hour. Collarless  and wearing an old tweed jacket, he had spent the evening, as he had  spent the day, in the cane chair, only quitting it for some ten minutes,  or less, to toy with dinner.    My several attempts at conversation had elicited nothing but growls;  therefore, as dusk descended, having dismissed my few patients, I  busied myself collating my notes upon the renewed activity of the Yellow  Doctor, and was thus engaged when the 'phone bell disturbed me. It was  Smith who was wanted, however; and he went out eagerly, leaving me to my  task.    At the end of a lengthy conversation, he returned from the 'phone and  began, restlessly, to pace the room. I made a pretense of continuing my  labors, but covertly I was watching him. He was twitching at the lobe of  his left ear, and his face was a study in perplexity. Abruptly he burst  out:    \"I shall throw the thing up, Petrie! Either I am growing too old to cope  with such an adversary as Fu-Manchu, or else my intellect has become  dull. I cannot seem to think clearly or consistently. For the Doctor,  this crime, this removal of Slattin, is clumsy--unfinished. There are  two explanations. Either he, too, is losing his old cunning or he has  been interrupted!\"    \"Interrupted!\"    \"Take the facts, Petrie,\"--Smith clapped his hands upon my table and  bent down, peering into my eyes--\"is it characteristic of Fu-Manchu to  kill a man by the direct agency of a snake and to implicate one of his  own damnable servants in this way?\"    \"But we have found no snake!\"    \"Karamaneh introduced one in some way. Do you doubt it?\"    \"Certainly Karamaneh visited him on the evening of his death, but you  must be perfectly well aware that even if she had been arrested, no jury  could convict her.\"    Smith resumed his restless pacings up and down.    \"You are very useful to me, Petrie,\" he replied; \"as a counsel for  the defense you constantly rectify my errors of prejudice. Yet I am  convinced that our presence at Slattin's house last night prevented  Fu-Manchu from finishing off this little matter as he had designed to  do.\"    \"What has given you this idea?\"    \"Weymouth is responsible. He has rung me up from the Yard. The constable  on duty at the house where the murder was committed, reports that some  one, less than an hour ago, attempted to break in.\"    \"Break in!\"    \"Ah! you are interested? I thought the circumstance illuminating, also!\"    \"Did the officer see this person?\"    \"No; he only heard him. It was some one who endeavored to enter by the  bathroom window, which, I am told, may be reached fairly easily by an  agile climber.\"    \"The attempt did not succeed?\"    \"No; the constable interrupted, but failed to make a capture or even to  secure a glimpse of the man.\"    We were both silent for some moments; then:    \"What do you propose to do?\" I asked.    \"We must not let Fu-Manchu's servants know,\" replied Smith, \"but  to-night I shall conceal myself in Slattin's house and remain there  for a week or a day--it matters not how long--until that attempt is  repeated. Quite obviously, Petrie, we have overlooked something which  implicates the murderer with the murder! In short, either by accident,  by reason of our superior vigilance, or by the clumsiness of his plans,  Fu-Manchu for once in an otherwise blameless career, has left a clue!\"        CHAPTER X. THE CLIMBER RETURNS    In utter darkness we groped our way through into the hallway of  Slattin's house, having entered, stealthily, from the rear; for Smith  had selected the study as a suitable base of operations. We reached it  without mishap, and presently I found myself seated in the very chair  which Karamaneh had occupied; my companion took up a post just within  the widely opened door.    So we commenced our ghostly business in the house of the murdered man--a  house from which, but a few hours since, his body had been removed. This  was such a vigil as I had endured once before, when, with Nayland Smith  and another, I had waited for the coming of one of Fu-Manchu's death  agents.    Of all the sounds which, one by one, now began to detach themselves  from the silence, there was a particular sound, homely enough at another  time, which spoke to me more dreadfully than the rest. It was the  ticking of the clock upon the mantelpiece; and I thought how this sound  must have been familiar to Abel Slattin, how it must have formed  part and parcel of his life, as it were, and how it went on  now--tick-tick-tick-tick--whilst he, for whom it had ticked, lay  unheeding--would never heed it more.    As I grew more accustomed to the gloom, I found myself staring at his  office chair; once I found myself expecting Abel Slattin to enter the  room and occupy it. There was a little China Buddha upon the bureau in  one corner, with a gilded cap upon its head, and as some reflection of  the moonlight sought out this little cap, my thoughts grotesquely turned  upon the murdered man's gold tooth.    Vague creakings from within the house, sounds as though of stealthy  footsteps upon the stair, set my nerves tingling; but Nayland Smith gave  no sign, and I knew that my imagination was magnifying these ordinary  night sounds out of all proportion to their actual significance.  Leaves rustled faintly outside the window at my back: I construed their  sibilant whispers into the dreaded name--Fu-Manchu-Fu-Manchu--Fu-Manchu!    So wore on the night; and, when the ticking clock hollowly boomed the  hour of one, I almost leaped out of my chair, so highly strung were my  nerves, and so appallingly did the sudden clangor beat upon them. Smith,  like a man of stone, showed no sign. He was capable of so subduing his  constitutionally high-strung temperament, at times, that temporarily  he became immune from human dreads. On such occasions he would be icily  cool amid universal panic; but, his object accomplished, I have seen him  in such a state of collapse, that utter nervous exhaustion is the only  term by which I can describe it.    Tick-tick-tick-tick went the clock, and, with my heart still thumping  noisily in my breast, I began to count the tickings; one, two, three,  four, five, and so on to a hundred, and from one hundred to many  hundreds.    Then, out from the confusion of minor noises, a new, arresting sound  detached itself. I ceased my counting; no longer I noted the tick-tick  of the clock, nor the vague creakings, rustlings and whispers. I saw  Smith, shadowly, raise his hand in warning--in needless warning, for I  was almost holding my breath in an effort of acute listening.    From high up in the house this new sound came from above the topmost  room, it seemed, up under the roof; a regular squeaking, oddly familiar,  yet elusive. Upon it followed a very soft and muffled thud; then a  metallic sound as of a rusty hinge in motion; then a new silence,  pregnant with a thousand possibilities more eerie than any clamor.    My mind was rapidly at work. Lighting the topmost landing of the house  was a sort of glazed trap, evidently set in the floor of a loft-like  place extending over the entire building. Somewhere in the red-tiled  roof above, there presumably existed a corresponding skylight or  lantern.    So I argued; and, ere I had come to any proper decision, another sound,  more intimate, came to interrupt me.    This time I could be in no doubt; some one was lifting the trap above  the stairhead--slowly, cautiously, and all but silently. Yet to my ears,  attuned to trifling disturbances, the trap creaked and groaned noisily.    Nayland Smith waved to me to take a stand on the other side of the  opened door--behind it, in fact, where I should be concealed from the  view of any one descending the stair.    I stood up and crossed the floor to my new post.    A dull thud told of the trap fully raised and resting upon some  supporting joist. A faint rustling (of discarded garments, I told  myself) spoke to my newly awakened, acute perceptions, of the visitor  preparing to lower himself to the landing. Followed a groan of woodwork  submitted to sudden strain--and the unmistakable pad of bare feet upon  the linoleum of the top corridor.    I knew now that one of Dr. Fu-Manchu's uncanny servants had gained the  roof of the house by some means, had broken through the skylight and had  descended by means of the trap beneath on to the landing.    In such a tensed-up state as I cannot describe, nor, at this hour  mentally reconstruct, I waited for the creaking of the stairs which  should tell of the creature's descent.    I was disappointed. Removed scarce a yard from me as he was, I could  hear Nayland Smith's soft, staccato breathing; but my eyes were all for  the darkened hallway, for the smudgy outline of the stair-rail with the  faint patterning in the background which, alone, indicated the wall.    It was amid an utter silence, unheralded by even so slight a sound  as those which I had acquired the power of detecting--that I saw the  continuity of the smudgy line of stair-rail to be interrupted.    A dark patch showed upon it, just within my line of sight, invisible to  Smith on the other side of the doorway, and some ten or twelve stairs  up.    No sound reached me, but the dark patch vanished and reappeared three  feet lower down.    Still I knew that this phantom approach must be unknown to my  companion--and I knew that it was impossible for me to advise him of it  unseen by the dreaded visitor.    A third time the dark patch--the hand of one who, ghostly, silent, was  creeping down into the hallway--vanished and reappeared on a level with  my eyes. Then a vague shape became visible; no more than a blur upon the  dim design of the wall-paper... and Nayland Smith got his first sight of  the stranger.    The clock on the mantelpiece boomed out the half-hour.    At that, such was my state (I blush to relate it) I uttered a faint cry!    It ended all secrecy--that hysterical weakness of mine."]]]
