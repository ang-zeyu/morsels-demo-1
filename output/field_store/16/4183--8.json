The equilateral triangle used in conjunction  with the circle and the square was employed by the Romans in  determining the proportions of triumphal arches, basilicas and  baths. That the same figure was a factor in the designing of Gothic  cathedrals is sufficiently indicated in the accompanying facsimile  reproductions of an illustration from the Como Vitruvius, published in  Milan in 1521, which shows a vertical section of the Milan cathedral  and the system of equilateral triangles which determined its various  parts (Illustration 71). The _vesica piscis_ was often used to  establish the two main internal dimensions of the cathedral plan: the  greatest diameter of the figure corresponding with the width across  the transepts, the upper apex marking the limit of the apse, and the  lower, the termination of the nave. Such a proportion is seen to be  both subtle and simple, and possesses the advantage of being easily  laid out. The architects of the Italian Renaissance doubtless  inherited certain of the Roman canons of architectural proportion,  for they seem very generally to have recognized them as an essential  principle of design.    [Illustration 71]    Nevertheless, when all is said, it is easy to exaggerate the  importance of this matter of geometrical proportion. The designer  who seeks the ultimate secret of architectural harmony in mathematics  rather than in the trained eye, is following the wrong road to  success. A happy inspiration is worth all the formulae in the world--if  it be really happy, the artist will probably find that he has  \"followed the rules without knowing them.\" Even while formulating  concepts of art, the author must reiterate Schopenhauer's dictum  that the _concept_ is unfruitful in art. The mathematical analysis  of spatial beauty is an interesting study, and a useful one to the  artist; but it can never take the place of the creative faculty, it  can only supplement, restrain, direct it. The study of proportion is  to the architect what the study of harmony is to a musician--it helps  his genius adequately to express itself.          VI    THE ARITHMETIC OF BEAUTY      Although architecture is based primarily upon geometry, it is possible  to express all spatial relations numerically: for arithmetic, not  geometry, is the universal science of quantity. The relation of masses  one to another--of voids to solids, and of heights and lengths to  widths--forms ratios; and when such ratios are simple and harmonious,  architecture may be said, in Walter Pater's famous phrase, to  \"aspire towards the condition of music.\" The trained eye, and not an  arithmetical formula, determines what is, and what is not, beautiful  proportion. Nevertheless the fact that the eye instinctively rejects  certain proportions as unpleasing, and accepts others as satisfactory,  is an indication of the existence of laws of space, based upon number,  not unlike those which govern musical harmony. The secret of the deep  reasonableness of such selection by the senses lies hidden in the very  nature of number itself, for number is the invisible thread on which  the worlds are strung--the universe abstractly symbolized.    Number is the within of all things--the \"first form of Brahman.\" It  is the measure of time and space; it lurks in the heart-beat and is  blazoned upon the starred canopy of night. Substance, in a state of  vibration, in other words conditioned by number, ceaselessly undergoes  the myriad transmutations which produce phenomenal life. Elements  separate and combine chemically according to numerical ratios:  \"Moon, plant, gas, crystal, are concrete geometry and number.\" By  the Pythagoreans and by the ancient Egyptians sex was attributed to  numbers, odd numbers being conceived of as masculine or generating,  and even numbers as feminine or parturitive, on account of their  infinite divisibility. Harmonious combinations were those  involving the marriage of a masculine and a feminine--an odd and an  even--number.    [Illustration 72: A GRAPHIC SYSTEM OF NOTATION]    Numbers progress from unity to infinity, and return again to unity as  the soul, defined by Pythagoras as a self-moving number, goes forth  from, and returns to God. These two acts, one of projection and the  other of recall; these two forces, centrifugal and centripetal, are  symbolized in the operations of addition and subtraction. Within them  is embraced the whole of computation; but because every number, every  aggregation of units, is also a new unit capable of being added  or subtracted, there are also the operations of multiplication and  division, which consists in one case of the addition of several equal  numbers together, and in the other, of the subtraction of several  equal numbers from a greater until that is exhausted. In order to  think correctly it is necessary to consider the whole of numeration,  computation, and all mathematical processes whatsoever as _the  division of the unit_ into its component parts and the establishment  of relations between these parts.    [Illustration 73]    [Illustration 74]    The progression and retrogression of numbers in groups expressed by  the multiplication table gives rise to what may be termed \"numerical  conjunctions.\" These are analogous to astronomical conjunctions: the  planets, revolving around the sun at different rates of speed, and  in widely separated orbits, at certain times come into line with one  another and with the sun. They are then said to be in conjunction.  Similarly, numbers, advancing toward infinity singly and in groups  (expressed by the multiplication table), at certain stages of their  progression come into relation with one another. For example, an  important conjunction occurs in 12, for of a series of twos it is  the sixth, of threes the fourth, of fours the third, and of sixes the  second. It stands to 8 in the ratio of 3:2, and to 9, of 4:3. It is  related to 7 through being the product of 3 and 4, of which numbers 7  is the sum. The numbers 11 and 13 are not conjunctive; 14 is so in  the series of twos, and sevens; 15 is so in the series of fives and  threes. The next conjunction after 12, of 3 and 4 and their first  multiples, is in 24, and the next following is in 36, which numbers  are respectively the two and three of a series of twelves, each end  being but a new beginning.    [Illustration 75]    It will be seen that this discovery of numerical conjunctions consists  merely of resolving numbers into their prime factors, and that a  conjunctive number is a common multiple; but by naming it so, to  dismiss the entire subject as known and exhausted, is to miss a  sense of the wonder, beauty and rhythm of it all: a mental impression  analogous to that made upon the eye by the swift-glancing balls of a  juggler, the evolutions of drilling troops, or the intricate figures  of a dance; for these things are number concrete and animate in time  and space.    [Illustration 76]    The truths of number are of all truths the most interior, abstract  and difficult of apprehension, and since knowledge becomes clear and  definite to the extent that it can be made to enter the mind through  the channels of physical sense, it is well to accustom oneself to  conceiving of number graphically, by means of geometrical symbols  (Illustration 72), rather than in terms of the familiar arabic  notation which though admirable for purposes of computation, is of  too condensed and arbitrary a character to reveal the properties of  individual numbers. To state, for example, that 4 is the first square,  and 8 the first cube, conveys but a vague idea to most persons, but if  4 be represented as a square enclosing four smaller squares, and 8  as a cube containing eight smaller cubes, the idea is apprehended  immediately and without effort. The number 3 is of course the  triangle; the irregular and vital beauty of the number 5 appears  clearly in the heptalpha, or five-pointed star; the faultless symmetry  of 6, its relation to 3 and 2, and its regular division of the circle,  are portrayed in the familiar hexagram known as the Shield of David.  Seven, when represented as a compact group of circles reveals itself  as a number of singular beauty and perfection, worthy of the important  place accorded to it in all mystical philosophy (Illustration 73). It  is a curious fact that when asked to think of any number less than 10,  most persons will choose 7.    [Illustration 77]    Every form of art, though primarily a vehicle for the expression and  transmission of particular ideas and emotions, has subsidiary offices,  just as a musical tone has harmonics which render it more sweet.  Painting reveals the nature of color; music, of sound--in wood,  in brass, and in stretched strings; architecture shows forth the  qualities of light, and the strength and beauty of materials. All  of the arts, and particularly music and architecture, portray in  different manners and degrees the truths of number. Architecture does  this in two ways: esoterically as it were in the form of harmonic  proportions; and exoterically in the form of symbols which represent  numbers and groups of numbers. The fact that a series of threes and  a series of fours mutually conjoin in 12, finds an architectural  expression in the Tuscan, the Doric, and the Ionic orders according to  Vignole, for in them all the stylobate is four parts, the entablature  3, and the intermediate column 12 (Illustration 74). The affinity  between 4 and 7, revealed in the fact that they express (very nearly)  the ratio between the base and the altitude of the right-angled  triangle which forms half of an equilateral, and the musical interval  of the diminished seventh, is architecturally suggested in the Palazzo  Giraud, which is four stories in height with seven openings in each  story (Illustration 75).

Responsibilities and difficulties she might have, no doubt, and in heavy  measure; but one feeling dominated and absorbed all others--the feeling  of joy. Everything pleased her. She was in high spirits from morning  till night. Mr. Creevey, grown old now, and very near his end, catching  a glimpse of her at Brighton, was much amused, in his sharp fashion, by  the ingenuous gaiety of \"little Vic.\" \"A more homely little being you  never beheld, when she is at her ease, and she is evidently dying to be  always more so. She laughs in real earnest, opening her mouth as wide as  it can go, showing not very pretty gums... She eats quite as heartily  as she laughs, I think I may say she gobbles... She blushes and laughs  every instant in so natural a way as to disarm anybody.\" But it was not  merely when she was laughing or gobbling that she enjoyed herself; the  performance of her official duties gave her intense satisfaction. \"I  really have immensely to do,\" she wrote in her Journal a few days after  her accession; \"I receive so many communications from my Ministers, but  I like it very much.\" And again, a week later, \"I repeat what I said  before that I have so many communications from the Ministers, and from  me to them, and I get so many papers to sign every day, that I have  always a very great deal to do. I delight in this work.\" Through the  girl's immaturity the vigorous predestined tastes of the woman were  pushing themselves into existence with eager velocity, with delicious  force.    One detail of her happy situation deserves particular mention. Apart  from the splendour of her social position and the momentousness of her  political one, she was a person of great wealth. As soon as Parliament  met, an annuity of L385,000 was settled upon her. When the expenses of  her household had been discharged, she was left with L68,000 a year of  her own. She enjoyed besides the revenues of the Duchy of Lancaster,  which amounted annually to over L27,000. The first use to which she put  her money was characteristic: she paid off her father's debts. In  money matters, no less than in other matters, she was determined to be  correct. She had the instincts of a man of business; and she never could  have borne to be in a position that was financially unsound.    With youth and happiness gilding every hour, the days passed merrily  enough. And each day hinged upon Lord Melbourne. Her diary shows us,  with undiminished clarity, the life of the young sovereign during  the early months of her reign--a life satisfactorily regular, full  of delightful business, a life of simple pleasures, mostly  physical--riding, eating, dancing--a quick, easy, highly unsophisticated  life, sufficient unto itself. The light of the morning is upon it; and,  in the rosy radiance, the figure of \"Lord M.\" emerges, glorified and  supreme. If she is the heroine of the story, he is the hero; but indeed  they are more than hero and heroine, for there are no other characters  at all. Lehzen, the Baron, Uncle Leopold, are unsubstantial shadows--the  incidental supers of the piece. Her paradise was peopled by two persons,  and surely that was enough. One sees them together still, a curious  couple, strangely united in those artless pages, under the magical  illumination of that dawn of eighty years ago: the polished high fine  gentleman with the whitening hair and whiskers and the thick dark  eyebrows and the mobile lips and the big expressive eyes; and beside him  the tiny Queen--fair, slim, elegant, active, in her plain girl's dress  and little tippet, looking up at him earnestly, adoringly, with eyes  blue and projecting, and half-open mouth. So they appear upon every page  of the Journal; upon every page Lord M. is present, Lord M. is speaking,  Lord M. is being amusing, instructive, delightful, and affectionate at  once, while Victoria drinks in the honied words, laughs till she shows  her gums, tries hard to remember, and runs off, as soon as she is left  alone, to put it all down. Their long conversations touched upon a  multitude of topics. Lord M. would criticise books, throw out a remark  or two on the British Constitution, make some passing reflections  on human life, and tell story after story of the great people of the  eighteenth century. Then there would be business a despatch perhaps  from Lord Durham in Canada, which Lord M. would read. But first he  must explain a little. \"He said that I must know that Canada originally  belonged to the French, and was only ceded to the English in 1760, when  it was taken in an expedition under Wolfe: 'a very daring enterprise,'  he said. Canada was then entirely French, and the British only came  afterwards... Lord M. explained this very clearly (and much better  than I have done) and said a good deal more about it. He then read me  Durham's despatch, which is a very long one and took him more than 1/2  an hour to read. Lord M. read it beautifully with that fine soft voice  of his, and with so much expression, so that it is needless to say I  was much interested by it.\" And then the talk would take a more personal  turn. Lord M. would describe his boyhood, and she would learn that \"he  wore his hair long, as all boys then did, till he was 17; (how handsome  he must have looked!).\" Or she would find out about his queer tastes and  habits--how he never carried a watch, which seemed quite extraordinary.  \"'I always ask the servant what o'clock it is, and then he tells me what  he likes,' said Lord M.\" Or, as the rooks wheeled about round the trees,  \"in a manner which indicated rain,\" he would say that he could sit  looking at them for an hour, and \"was quite surprised at my disliking  them. M. said, 'The rooks are my delight.'\"    The day's routine, whether in London or at Windsor, was almost  invariable. The morning was devoted to business and Lord M. In the  afternoon the whole Court went out riding. The Queen, in her velvet  riding--habit and a top-hat with a veil draped about the brim, headed  the cavalcade; and Lord M. rode beside her. The lively troupe went fast  and far, to the extreme exhilaration of Her Majesty. Back in the Palace  again, there was still time for a little more fun before dinner--a game  of battledore and shuttlecock perhaps, or a romp along the galleries  with some children. Dinner came, and the ceremonial decidedly tightened.  The gentleman of highest rank sat on the right hand of the Queen; on her  left--it soon became an established rule--sat Lord Melbourne. After the  ladies had left the dining-room, the gentlemen were not permitted to  remain behind for very long; indeed, the short time allowed them for  their wine-drinking formed the subject--so it was rumoured--of one of  the very few disputes between the Queen and her Prime Minister;(*) but  her determination carried the day, and from that moment after-dinner  drunkenness began to go out of fashion. When the company was reassembled  in the drawing-room the etiquette was stiff. For a few moments the Queen  spoke in turn to each one of her guests; and during these short uneasy  colloquies the aridity of royalty was apt to become painfully evident.  One night Mr. Greville, the Clerk of the Privy Council, was present; his  turn soon came; the middle-aged, hard-faced viveur was addressed by his  young hostess. \"Have you been riding to-day, Mr. Greville?\" asked the  Queen. \"No, Madam, I have not,\" replied Mr. Greville. \"It was a fine  day,\" continued the Queen. \"Yes, Madam, a very fine day,\" said Mr.  Greville. \"It was rather cold, though,\" said the Queen. \"It was rather  cold, Madam,\" said Mr. Greville. \"Your sister, Lady Frances Egerton,  rides, I think, doesn't she?\" said the Queen. \"She does ride sometimes,  Madam,\" said Mr. Greville. There was a pause, after which Mr. Greville  ventured to take the lead, though he did not venture to change the  subject. \"Has your Majesty been riding today?\" asked Mr. Greville. \"Oh  yes, a very long ride,\" answered the Queen with animation. \"Has your  Majesty got a nice horse?\" said Mr. Greville. \"Oh, a very nice horse,\"  said the Queen. It was over. Her Majesty gave a smile and an inclination  of the head, Mr. Greville a profound bow, and the next conversation  began with the next gentleman. When all the guests had been disposed  of, the Duchess of Kent sat down to her whist, while everybody else was  ranged about the round table. Lord Melbourne sat beside the Queen, and  talked pertinaciously--very often a propos to the contents of one of the  large albums of engravings with which the round table was covered--until  it was half-past eleven and time to go to bed.         (*) The Duke of Bedford told Greville he was \"sure there was       a battle between her and Melbourne... He is sure there was       one about the men's sitting after dinner, for he heard her       say to him rather angrily, 'it is a horrid custom-' but when       the ladies left the room (he dined there) directions were       given that the men should remain five minutes longer.\"       Greville Memoirs, February 26, 1840 (unpublished).    Occasionally, there were little diversions: the evening might be spent  at the opera or at the play. Next morning the royal critic was careful  to note down her impressions. \"It was Shakespeare's tragedy of Hamlet,  and we came in at the beginning of it. Mr. Charles Kean (son of  old Kean) acted the part of Hamlet, and I must say beautifully.  His conception of this very difficult, and I may almost say  incomprehensible, character is admirable; his delivery of all the fine  long speeches quite beautiful; he is excessively graceful and all  his actions and attitudes are good, though not at all good-looking in  face... I came away just as Hamlet was over.\" Later on, she went to see  Macready in King Lear. The story was new to her; she knew nothing about  it, and at first she took very little interest in what was"]]]
