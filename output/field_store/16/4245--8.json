Pulled down, you will say, although in a single night. That can never  be the answer to the mystery, for the house of the fluted pillars  painted on plaster and the low-class jeweller's shop with its silver  brooches (all of which I could identify one by one) were standing side  by side.            A Story of Land and Sea    It is written in the first Book of Wonder how Captain Shard of the bad  ship Desperate Lark, having looted the sea-coast city Bombasharna,  retired from active life; and resigning piracy to younger men, with  the good will of the North and South Atlantic, settled down with a  captured queen on his floating island.    Sometimes he sank a ship for the sake of old times but he no longer  hovered along the trade-routes; and timid merchants watched for other  men.    It was not age that caused him to leave his romantic profession; nor  unworthiness of its traditions, nor gun-shot wound, nor drink; but  grim necessity and force majeure. Five navies were after him. How he  gave them the slip one day in the Mediterranean, how he fought with  the Arabs, how a ship's broadside was heard in Lat. 23 N. Long. 4 E.  for the first time and the last, with other things unknown to  Admiralties, I shall proceed to tell.    He had had his fling, had Shard, captain of pirates, and all his merry  men wore pearls in their ear-rings; and now the English fleet was  after him under full sail along the coast of Spain with a good North  wind behind them. They were not gaining much on Shard's rakish craft,  the bad ship Desperate Lark, yet they were closer than was to his  liking, and they interfered with business.    For a day and a night they had chased him, when off Cape St. Vincent  at about six a.m. Shard took that step that decided his retirement  from active life, he turned for the Mediterranean. Had he held on  Southwards down the African coast it is doubtful whether in face of  the interference of England, Russia, France, Denmark and Spain, he  could have made piracy pay; but in turning for the Mediterranean he  took what we may call the penultimate step of his life which meant for  him settling down. There were three great courses of action invented  by Shard in his youth, upon which he pondered by day and brooded by  night, consolations in all his dangers, secret even from his men,  three means of escape as he hoped from any peril that might meet him  on the sea. One of these was the floating island that the Book of  Wonder tells of, another was so fantastic that we may doubt if even  the brilliant audacity of Shard could ever have found it practicable,  at least he never tried it so far as is known in that tavern by the  sea in which I glean my news, and the third he determined on carrying  out as he turned that morning for the Mediterranean. True he might yet  have practised piracy in spite of the step that he took, a little  later when the seas grew quiet, but that penultimate step was like  that small house in the country that the business man has his eye on,  like some snug investment put away for old age, there are certain  final courses in men's lives which after taking they never go back to  business.    He turned then for the Mediterranean with the English fleet behind  him, and his men wondered.    What madness was this,--muttered Bill the Boatswain in Old Frank's  only ear, with the French fleet waiting in the Gulf of Lyons and the  Spaniards all the way between Sardinia and Tunis: for they knew the  Spaniards' ways. And they made a deputation and waited upon Captain  Shard, all of them sober and wearing their costly clothes, and they  said that the Mediterranean was a trap, and all he said was that the  North wind should hold. And the crew said they were done.    So they entered the Mediterranean and the English fleet came up and  closed the straits. And Shard went tacking along the Moroccan coast  with a dozen frigates behind him. And the North wind grew in strength.  And not till evening did he speak to his crew, and then he gathered  them all together except the man at the helm, and politely asked them  to come down to the hold. And there he showed them six immense steel  axles and a dozen low iron wheels of enormous width which none had  seen before; and he told his crew how all unknown to the world his  keel had been specially fitted for these same axles and wheels, and  how he meant soon to sail to the wide Atlantic again, though not by  the way of the straits. And when they heard the name of the Atlantic  all his merry men cheered, for they looked on the Atlantic as a wide  safe sea.    And night came down and Captain Shard sent for his diver. With the sea  getting up it was hard work for the diver, but by midnight things were  done to Shard's satisfaction, and the diver said that of all the jobs  he had done--but finding no apt comparison, and being in need of a  drink, silence fell on him and soon sleep, and his comrades carried  him away to his hammock. All the next day the chase went on with the  English well in sight, for Shard had lost time overnight with his  wheels and axles, and the danger of meeting the Spaniards increased  every hour; and evening came when every minute seemed dangerous, yet  they still went tacking on towards the East where they knew the  Spaniards must be.    And at last they sighted their topsails right ahead, and still Shard  went on. It was a close thing, but night was coming on, and the Union  Jack which he hoisted helped Shard with the Spaniards for the last few  anxious minutes, though it seemed to anger the English, but as Shard  said, \"There's no pleasing everyone,\" and then the twilight shivered  into darkness.    \"Hard to starboard,\" said Captain Shard.    The North wind which had risen all day was now blowing a gale. I do  not know what part of the coast Shard steered for, but Shard knew, for  the coasts of the world were to him what Margate is to some of us.    At a place where the desert rolling up from mystery and from death,  yea, from the heart of Africa, emerges upon the sea, no less grand  than her, no less terrible, even there they sighted the land quite  close, almost in darkness. Shard ordered every man to the hinder part  of the ship and all the ballast too; and soon the Desperate Lark, her  prow a little high out of the water, doing her eighteen knots before  the wind, struck a sandy beach and shuddered, she heeled over a  little, then righted herself, and slowly headed into the interior of  Africa.    The men would have given three cheers, but after the first Shard  silenced them and, steering the ship himself, he made them a short  speech while the broad wheels pounded slowly over the African sand,  doing barely five knots in a gale. The perils of the sea he said had  been greatly exaggerated. Ships had been sailing the sea for hundreds  of years and at sea you knew what to do, but on land this was  different. They were on land now and they were not to forget it. At  sea you might make as much noise as you pleased and no harm was done,  but on land anything might happen. One of the perils of the land that  he instanced was that of hanging. For every hundred men that they hung  on land, he said, not more than twenty would be hung at sea. The men  were to sleep at their guns. They would not go far that night; for the  risk of being wrecked at night was another danger peculiar to the  land, while at sea you might sail from set of sun till dawn: yet it  was essential to get out of sight of the sea for if anyone knew they  were there they'd have cavalry after them. And he had sent back  Smerdrak (a young lieutenant of pirates) to cover their tracks where  they came up from the sea. And the merry men vigorously nodded their  heads though they did not dare to cheer, and presently Smerdrak came  running up and they threw him a rope by the stern. And when they had  done fifteen knots they anchored, and Captain Shard gathered his men  about him and, standing by the land-wheel in the bows, under the large  and clear Algerian stars, he explained his system of steering. There  was not much to be said for it, he had with considerable ingenuity  detached and pivoted the portion of the keel that held the leading  axle and could move it by chains which were controlled from the  land-wheel, thus the front pair of wheels could be deflected at will,  but only very slightly, and they afterwards found that in a hundred  yards they could only turn their ship four yards from her course. But  let not captains of comfortable battleships, or owners even of yachts,  criticise too harshly a man who was not of their time and who knew not  modern contrivances; it should be remembered also that Shard was no  longer at sea. His steering may have been clumsy but he did what he  could.    When the use and limitations of his land-wheel had been made clear to  his men, Shard bade them all turn in except those on watch. Long  before dawn he woke them and by the very first gleam of light they got  their ship under way, so that when those two fleets that had made so  sure of Shard closed in like a great crescent on the Algerian coast  there was no sign to see of the Desperate Lark either on sea or land;  and the flags of the Admiral's ship broke out into a hearty English  oath.    The gale blew for three days and, Shard using more sail by daylight,  they scudded over the sands at little less than ten knots, though on  the report of rough water ahead (as the lookout man called rocks, low  hills or uneven surface before he adapted himself to his new  surroundings) the rate was much decreased. Those were long summer days  and Shard who was anxious while the wind held good to outpace the  rumour of his own appearance sailed for nineteen hours a day, lying to  at ten in the evening and hoisting sail again at three a.m. when it  first began to be light.

The festival itself, however, was  instituted by Imperial decree ten years ago (1890).    The transformation which has come over Japan in a single generation  requires interpretation. Is the change real or superficial? Is the new  social order \"a borrowed trumpery garment, which will soon be rent by  violent revolutions,\" according to the eminent student of racial  psychology, Professor Le Bon, or is it of \"a solid nature\" according  to the firm belief of Mr. Stanford Ransome, one of the latest writers  on Japan?    This is the problem that will engage our attention more or less  directly throughout this work. We shall give our chief thought to the  nature and development of Japanese racial characteristics, believing  that this alone gives the light needed for the solution of the  problem.[B]          III    THE PROBLEM OF PROGRESS      What constitutes progress? And what is the true criterion for its  measurement? In adopting Western methods of life and thought, is Japan  advancing or receding? The simplicity of the life of the common  people, their freedom from fashions that fetter the Occidental, their  independence of furniture in their homes, their few wants and fewer  necessities--these, when contrasted with the endless needs and demands  of an Occidental, are accepted by some as evidences of a higher stage  of civilization than prevails in the West.    The hedonistic criterion of progress is the one most commonly adopted  in considering the question as to whether Japan is the gainer or the  loser by her rapid abandonment of old ways and ideas and by her  equally rapid adoption of Western ones in their place. Yet this appeal  to happiness seems to me a misleading because vague, if not altogether  false, standard of progress. Those who use it insist that the people  of Japan are losing their former happiness under the stress of new  conditions. Now there can be no doubt that during the \"Kyu-han jidai,\"  the times before the coming in of Western waves of life, the farmers  were a simple, unsophisticated people; living from month to month with  little thought or anxiety. They may be said to have been happy. The  samurai who lived wholly on the bounty of the daimyo led of course a  tranquil life, at least so far as anxiety or toil for daily rice and  fish was concerned. As the fathers had lived and fought and died, so  did the sons. To a large extent the community had all things in  common; for although the lord lived in relative luxury, yet in such  small communities there never was the great difference between classes  that we find in modern Europe and America. As a rule the people were  fed, if there was food. The socialistic principle was practically  universal. Especially was emphasis laid on kinship. As a result, save  among the outcast classes, the extremes of poverty did not exist.    Were we to rest our inquiries at this point, we might say that in  truth the Japanese had attained the summit of progress; that nothing  further could be asked. But pushing our way further, we find that the  peace and quiet of the ordinary classes of society were accompanied by  many undesirable features.    Prominent among them was the domineering spirit of the military class.  They alone laid claim to personal rights, and popular stories are full  of the free and furious ways in which they used their swords. The  slightest offense by one of the swordless men would be paid for by a  summary act of the two-sworded swashbucklers, while beggars and  farmers were cut down without compunction, sometimes simply to test a  sword. In describing those times one man said to me, \"They used to cut  off the heads of the common people as farmers cut off the head of the  daikon\" (a variety of giant radish). I have frequently asked my  Japanese friends and acquaintances, whether, in view of the increasing  difficulties of life under the new conditions, the country would not  like to return to ancient times and customs. But none have been ready  to give me an affirmative reply. On detailed questioning I have always  found that the surly, domineering methods, the absolutism of the  rulers, and the defenselessness of the people against unjust arbitrary  superiors would not be submitted to by a people that has once tasted  the joy arising from individual rights and freedom and the manhood  that comes from just laws for all.    A striking feature of those Japanese who are unchanged by foreign ways  is their obsequious manner toward superiors and officials. The lordly  and oftentimes ruthless manner of the rulers has naturally cowed the  subject. Whenever the higher nobility traveled, the common people were  commanded to fall on the ground in obeisance and homage. Failure to do  so was punishable with instant death at the hands of the retainers  who accompanied the lord. During my first stay in Kumamoto I was  surprised that farmers, coming in from the country on horseback,  meeting me as I walked, invariably got down from their horses,  unfastened the handkerchiefs from their heads, and even took off their  spectacles if there were nothing else removable. These were signs of  respect given to all in authority. Where my real status began to be  generally known, these signs of politeness gave place to rude staring.  It is difficult for the foreigner to appreciate the extremes of the  high-handed and the obsequious spirit which were developed by the  ancient form of government. Yet it is comparatively easy to  distinguish between the evidently genuine humility of the non-military  classes and the studied deference of the dominant samurai.    Another feature of the old order of things was the emptiness of the  lives of the people. Education was rare. Limited to the samurai, who  composed but a fraction of the population, it was by no means  universal even among them. And such education as they had was confined  to the Chinese classics. Although there were schools in connection  with some of the temples, the people as a whole did not learn to read  or write. These were accomplishments for the nobility and men of  leisure. The thoughts of the people were circumscribed by the narrow  world in which they lived, and this allowed but an occasional  glimpse of other clans through war or a chance traveler. For, in those  times, freedom of travel was not generally allowed. Each man, as a  rule, lived and labored and died where he was born. The military  classes had more freedom. But when we contrast the breadth of thought  and outlook enjoyed by the nation to-day, through newspapers and  magazines, with the outlook and knowledge of even the most progressive  and learned of those of ancient times, how contracted do their lives  appear!    A third feature of former times is the condition of women during those  ages. Eulogizers of Old Japan not only seem to forget that working  classes existed then, but also that women, constituting half the  population, were essential to the existence of the nation. Though  allowing more freedom than was given to women in other Oriental  nations, Japan did not grant such liberty as is essential to the full  development of her powers. \"Woman is a man's plaything\" expresses a  view still held in Japan. \"Woman's sole duty is the bearing and  rearing of children for her husband\" is the dominant idea that has  determined her place in the family and in the state for hundreds of  years. That she has any independent interest or value as a human being  has not entered into national conception. \"The way in which they are  treated by the men has hitherto been such as might cause a pang to any  generous European heart.... A woman's lot is summed up in what is  termed 'the three obediences,' obedience, while yet unmarried, to a  father; obedience, when married, to a husband; obedience, when  widowed, to a son. At the present moment the greatest duchess or  marchioness in the land is still her husband's drudge. She fetches and  carries for him, bows down humbly in the hall when my lord sallies  forth on his good pleasure.\"[C] \"The Greater Learning for Women,\" by  Ekken Kaibara (1630-1714), an eminent Japanese moralist, is the name  of a treatise on woman's duties which sums up the ideas common in  Japan upon this subject. For two hundred years or more it has been  used as a text-book in the training of girls. It enjoins such abject  submission of the wife to her husband, to her parents-in-law, and to  her other kindred by marriage, as no self-respecting woman of Western  lands could for a moment endure. Let me prove this through a few  quotations.    \"A woman should look on her husband as if he were Heaven itself and  never weary of thinking how she may yield to her husband, and thus  escape celestial castigation.\" \"Woman must form no friendships and no  intimacy, except when ordered to do so by her parents or by the  middleman. Even at the peril of her life, must she harden her heart  like a rock or metal, and observe the rules of propriety.\" \"A woman  has no particular lord. She must look to her husband as her lord and  must serve him with all reverence and worship, not despising or  thinking lightly of him. The great life-long duty of a woman is  obedience.... When the husband issues his instructions, the wife must  never disobey them.... Should her husband be roused to anger at any  time, she must obey him, with fear and trembling.\" Not one word in all  these many and specific instructions hints at love and affection. That  which to Western ears is the sweetest word in the English language,  the foundation of happiness in the home, the only true bond between  husband and wife, parents and children--LOVE--does not once appear in  this the ideal instruction for Japanese women.
