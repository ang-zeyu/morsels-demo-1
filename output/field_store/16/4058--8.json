It was many marches from Opar to the Waziri country; but at last came  the hour when Tarzan and the Belgian, following the trail of the  warriors, topped the last rise, and saw before them the broad Waziri  plain, the winding river, and the distant forests to the north and west.    A mile or more ahead of them, the line of warriors was creeping like a  giant caterpillar through the tall grasses of the plain.  Beyond,  grazing herds of zebra, hartebeest, and topi dotted the level  landscape, while closer to the river a bull buffalo, his head and  shoulders protruding from the reeds watched the advancing blacks for a  moment, only to turn at last and disappear into the safety of his dank  and gloomy retreat.    Tarzan looked out across the familiar vista with no faintest gleam of  recognition in his eyes.  He saw the game animals, and his mouth  watered; but he did not look in the direction of his bungalow.  Werper,  however, did.  A puzzled expression entered the Belgian's eyes.  He  shaded them with his palms and gazed long and earnestly toward the spot  where the bungalow had stood.  He could not credit the testimony of his  eyes--there was no bungalow--no barns--no out-houses.  The corrals, the  hay stacks--all were gone.  What could it mean?    And then, slowly there filtered into Werper's consciousness an  explanation of the havoc that had been wrought in that peaceful valley  since last his eyes had rested upon it--Achmet Zek had been there!    Basuli and his warriors had noted the devastation the moment they had  come in sight of the farm.  Now they hastened on toward it talking  excitedly among themselves in animated speculation upon the cause and  meaning of the catastrophe.    When, at last they crossed the trampled garden and stood before the  charred ruins of their master's bungalow, their greatest fears became  convictions in the light of the evidence about them.    Remnants of human dead, half devoured by prowling hyenas and others of  the carnivora which infested the region, lay rotting upon the ground,  and among the corpses remained sufficient remnants of their clothing  and ornaments to make clear to Basuli the frightful story of the  disaster that had befallen his master's house.    \"The Arabs,\" he said, as his men clustered about him.    The Waziri gazed about in mute rage for several minutes.  Everywhere  they encountered only further evidence of the ruthlessness of the cruel  enemy that had come during the Great Bwana's absence and laid waste his  property.    \"What did they with 'Lady'?\" asked one of the blacks.    They had always called Lady Greystoke thus.    \"The women they would have taken with them,\" said Basuli.  \"Our women  and his.\"    A giant black raised his spear above his head, and gave voice to a  savage cry of rage and hate.  The others followed his example.  Basuli  silenced them with a gesture.    \"This is no time for useless noises of the mouth,\" he said.  \"The Great  Bwana has taught us that it is acts by which things are done, not  words.  Let us save our breath--we shall need it all to follow up the  Arabs and slay them.  If 'Lady' and our women live the greater the need  of haste, and warriors cannot travel fast upon empty lungs.\"    From the shelter of the reeds along the river, Werper and Tarzan  watched the blacks.  They saw them dig a trench with their knives and  fingers.  They saw them lay their yellow burdens in it and scoop the  overturned earth back over the tops of the ingots.    Tarzan seemed little interested, after Werper had assured him that that  which they buried was not good to eat; but Werper was intensely  interested.  He would have given much had he had his own followers with  him, that he might take away the treasure as soon as the blacks left,  for he was sure that they would leave this scene of desolation and  death as soon as possible.    The treasure buried, the blacks removed themselves a short distance up  wind from the fetid corpses, where they made camp, that they might rest  before setting out in pursuit of the Arabs.  It was already dusk.  Werper and Tarzan sat devouring some pieces of meat they had brought  from their last camp.  The Belgian was occupied with his plans for the  immediate future.  He was positive that the Waziri would pursue Achmet  Zek, for he knew enough of savage warfare, and of the characteristics  of the Arabs and their degraded followers to guess that they had  carried the Waziri women off into slavery.  This alone would assure  immediate pursuit by so warlike a people as the Waziri.    Werper felt that he should find the means and the opportunity to push  on ahead, that he might warn Achmet Zek of the coming of Basuli, and  also of the location of the buried treasure.  What the Arab would now  do with Lady Greystoke, in view of the mental affliction of her  husband, Werper neither knew nor cared.  It was enough that the golden  treasure buried upon the site of the burned bungalow was infinitely  more valuable than any ransom that would have occurred even to the  avaricious mind of the Arab, and if Werper could persuade the raider to  share even a portion of it with him he would be well satisfied.    But by far the most important consideration, to Werper, at least, was  the incalculably valuable treasure in the little leathern pouch at  Tarzan's side.  If he could but obtain possession of this!  He must!  He would!    His eyes wandered to the object of his greed.  They measured Tarzan's  giant frame, and rested upon the rounded muscles of his arms.  It was  hopeless.  What could he, Werper, hope to accomplish, other than his  own death, by an attempt to wrest the gems from their savage owner?    Disconsolate, Werper threw himself upon his side.  His head was  pillowed on one arm, the other rested across his face in such a way  that his eyes were hidden from the ape-man, though one of them was  fastened upon him from beneath the shadow of the Belgian's forearm.  For a time he lay thus, glowering at Tarzan, and originating schemes  for plundering him of his treasure--schemes that were discarded as  futile as rapidly as they were born.    Tarzan presently let his own eyes rest upon Werper.  The Belgian saw  that he was being watched, and lay very still.  After a few moments he  simulated the regular breathing of deep slumber.    Tarzan had been thinking.  He had seen the Waziri bury their  belongings.  Werper had told him that they were hiding them lest some  one find them and take them away.  This seemed to Tarzan a splendid  plan for safeguarding valuables.  Since Werper had evinced a desire to  possess his glittering pebbles, Tarzan, with the suspicions of a  savage, had guarded the baubles, of whose worth he was entirely  ignorant, as zealously as though they spelled life or death to him.    For a long time the ape-man sat watching his companion.  At last,  convinced that he slept, Tarzan withdrew his hunting knife and  commenced to dig a hole in the ground before him.  With the blade he  loosened up the earth, and with his hands he scooped it out until he  had excavated a little cavity a few inches in diameter, and five or six  inches in depth.  Into this he placed the pouch of jewels.  Werper  almost forgot to breathe after the fashion of a sleeper as he saw what  the ape-man was doing--he scarce repressed an ejaculation of  satisfaction.    Tarzan become suddenly rigid as his keen ears noted the cessation of  the regular inspirations and expirations of his companion.  His  narrowed eyes bored straight down upon the Belgian.  Werper felt that  he was lost--he must risk all on his ability to carry on the deception.  He sighed, threw both arms outward, and turned over on his back  mumbling as though in the throes of a bad dream.  A moment later he  resumed the regular breathing.    Now he could not watch Tarzan, but he was sure that the man sat for a  long time looking at him.  Then, faintly, Werper heard the other's  hands scraping dirt, and later patting it down.  He knew then that the  jewels were buried.    It was an hour before Werper moved again, then he rolled over facing  Tarzan and opened his eyes.  The ape-man slept.  By reaching out his  hand Werper could touch the spot where the pouch was buried.    For a long time he lay watching and listening.  He moved about, making  more noise than necessary, yet Tarzan did not awaken.  He drew the  sacrificial knife from his belt, and plunged it into the ground.  Tarzan did not move.  Cautiously the Belgian pushed the blade downward  through the loose earth above the pouch.  He felt the point touch the  soft, tough fabric of the leather.  Then he pried down upon the handle.  Slowly the little mound of loose earth rose and parted.  An instant  later a corner of the pouch came into view.  Werper pulled it from its  hiding place, and tucked it in his shirt.  Then he refilled the hole  and pressed the dirt carefully down as it had been before.    Greed had prompted him to an act, the discovery of which by his  companion could lead only to the most frightful consequences for  Werper.  Already he could almost feel those strong, white fangs burying  themselves in his neck.  He shuddered.  Far out across the plain a  leopard screamed, and in the dense reeds behind him some great beast  moved on padded feet.    Werper feared these prowlers of the night; but infinitely more he  feared the just wrath of the human beast sleeping at his side.  With  utmost caution the Belgian arose.  Tarzan did not move.  Werper took a  few steps toward the plain and the distant forest to the northwest,  then he paused and fingered the hilt of the long knife in his belt.  He  turned and looked down upon the sleeper.    \"Why not?\" he mused.  \"Then I should be safe.\"    He returned and bent above the ape-man.  Clutched tightly in his hand  was the sacrificial knife of the High Priestess of the Flaming God!          10    Achmet Zek Sees the Jewels      Mugambi, weak and suffering, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/926"],[0,"Ten Thousand Dreams Interpreted; Or, What's in a Dream (#11)"],[1,"with some affair, or continue  a journey, denotes that you will find trouble in your household,  and enterprises will be unsuccessful.
