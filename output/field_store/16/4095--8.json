Intervention by the rest of the party was a foregone conclusion.  An altercation ensued. A British officer was attacked with a spade.  Firing and a death of a Mahajarin was the result. Has British prestige  been enhanced by the episode? Why have not the Government put tactful  officers in charge at the frontier, whilst a great religious emigration  is in progress? The action of the military will pass from tongue to  tongue throughout India and the Mussalman world around, will not doubt  be unconsciously and even consciously exaggerated in the passage and the  feeling bitter as it already is will grow in bitterness. The  _Communique_ says that the Government are making further inquiry. Let us  hope that it will be full and that better arrangements will be made to  prevent a repetition of what appears to have been a thoughtless act on  the part of the military.    And may I draw the attention of those who are opposing non-co-operation  that unless they find out a substitute they should either join the  non-co-operation movement or prepare to face a disorganised subterranean  upheaval whose effect no one can foresee and whose spread it would be  impossible to check or regulate?          III. THE PUNJAB WRONGS      POLITICAL FREEMASONRY    Freemasonry is a secret brotherhood which has more by its secret and  iron rules than by its service to humanity obtained a hold upon some of  the best minds. Similarly there seems to be some secret code of conduct  governing the official class in India before which the flower of the  great British nation fall prostrate and unconsciously become instruments  of injustice which as private individuals they would be ashamed of  perpetrating. In no other way is it possible for one to understand the  majority report of the Hunter Committee, the despatch of the Government  of India, and the reply thereto of the Secretary of State for India. In  spite of the energetic protests of a section of the Press to the  personnel of the committee, it might be said that on the whole the  public were prepared to trust it especially as it contained three Indian  members who could fairly be claimed to be independent. The first rude  shock to this confidence was delivered by the refusal of Lord Hunter's  Committee to accept the very moderate and reasonable demand of the  Congress Committee that the imprisoned Punjab leaders might be allowed  to appear before it to instruct Counsel. Any doubt that might have been  left in the mind of any person has been dispelled by the report of the  majority of that committee. The result has justified the attitude of the  Congress Committee. The evidence collected by it shows what lord  Hunter's Committee purposely denied itself.    The minority report stands out like an oasis in a desert. The Indian  members deserve the congratulation of their countrymen for having dared  to do their duty in the face of heavy odds. I wish that they had refused  to associate themselves even in a modified manner with the condemnation  of the civil disobedience form of Satyagraha. The defiant spirit of the  Delhi mob on the 30th March 1919 can hardly be used for condemning a  great spiritual movement which is admittedly and manifestly intended to  restrain the violent tendencies of mobs and to replace criminal  lawlessness by civil disobedience of authority, when it has forfeited  all title to respect. On the 30th March civil disobedience had not even  been started. Almost every great popular demonstration has been hitherto  attended all the world over by a certain amount of lawlessness. The  demonstration of 30th March and 6th April could have been held under any  other aegis us under that of Satyagrah. I hold that without the advent  of the spirit of civility and orderliness the disobedience would have  taken a much more violent form than it did even at Delhi. It was only  the wonderfully quick acceptance by the people of the principle of  Satyagrah that effectively checked the spread of violence throughout the  length and breadth of India. And even to-day it is not the memory of the  black barbarity of General Dyer that is keeping the undoubted  restlessness among the people from breaking forth into violence. The  hold that Satyagrah has gained on the people--it may be even against  their will--is curbing the forces of disorder and violence. But I must  not detain the reader on a defence of Satyagrah against unjust attacks.  If it has gained a foothold in India, it will survive much fiercer  attacks than the one made by the majority of the Hunter Committee and  somewhat supported by the minority. Had the majority report been  defective only in this direction and correct in every other there would  have been nothing but praise for it. After all Satyagrah is a new  experiment in political field. And a hasty attributing to it of any  popular disorder would have been pardonable.    The universally pronounced adverse judgment upon the report and the  despatches rests upon far more painful revelations. Look at the  manifestly laboured defence of every official act of inhumanity except  where condemnation could not be avoided through the impudent admissions  made by the actors themselves; look at the special pleading introduced  to defend General Dyer even against himself; look at the vain  glorification of Sir Michael O'Dwyer although it was his spirit that  actuated every act of criminality on the part of the subordinates; look  at the deliberate refusal to examine his wild career before the events  of April. His acts were an open book of which the committee ought to  have taken judicial notices. Instead of accepting everything that the  officials had to say, the Committee's obvious duty was to tax itself to  find out the real cause of the disorders. It ought to have gone out of  its way to search out the inwardness of the events. Instead of patiently  going behind the hard crust of official documents, the Committee allowed  itself to be guided with criminal laziness by mere official evidence.  The report and the despatches, in my humble opinion, constitute an  attempt to condone official lawlessness. The cautious and half-hearted  condemnation pronounced upon General Dyer's massacre and the notorious  crawling order only deepens the disappointment of the reader as he goes  through page after page of thinly disguised official whitewash. I need,  however, scarcely attempt any elaborate examination of the report or the  despatches which have been so justly censured by the whole national  press whether of the moderate or the extremist hue. The point to  consider is how to break down this secret--be the secrecy over so  unconscious--conspiracy to uphold official iniquity. A scandal of this  magnitude cannot be tolerated by the nation, if it is to preserve its  self-respect and become a free partner in the Empire. The All-India  Congress Committee has resolved upon convening a special session of the  Congress for the purpose of considering, among other things, the  situation arising from the report. In my opinion the time has arrived  when we must cease to rely upon mere petition to Parliament for  effective action. Petitions will have value, when the nation has behind  it the power to enforce its will. What power then have we? When we are  firmly of opinion that grave wrong has been done us and when after an  appeal to the highest authority we fail to secure redress, there must be  some power available to us for undoing the wrong. It is true that in the  vast majority of cases it is the duty of a subject to submit to wrongs  on failure of the usual procedure, so long as they do not affect his  vital being. But every nation and every individual has the right and it  is their duty, to rise against an intolerable wrong. I do not believe in  armed risings. They are a remedy worse than the disease sought to be  cured. They are a token of the spirit of revenge and impatience and  anger. The method of violence cannot do good in the long run. Witness  the effect of the armed rising of the allied powers against Germany.  Have they not become even like the Germans, as the latter have been  depicted to us by them?    We have a better method. Unlike that of violence it certainly involves  the exercise of restraint and patience: but it requires also  resoluteness of will. This method is to refuse to be party to the wrong.  No tyrant has ever yet succeeded in his purpose without carrying the  victim with him, it may be, as it often is, by force. Most people choose  rather to yield to the will of the tyrant than to suffer for the  consequences of resistance. Hence does terrorism form part of the  stock-in-trade of the tyrant. But we have instances in history where  terrorism has failed to impose the terrorist's will upon his victim.  India has the choice before her now. If then the acts of the Punjab  Government be an insufferable wrong, if the report of Lord Hunter's  Committee and the two despatches be a greater wrong by reason of their  grievous condonation of those acts, it is clear that we must refuse to  submit to this official violence. Appeal the Parliament by all means, if  necessary, but if the Parliament fails us and if we are worthy to call  ourselves a nation, we must refuse to uphold the Government by  withdrawing co-operation from it.      THE DUTY OF THE PUNJABEE    The Allahabad _Leader_ deserves to be congratulated for publishing the  correspondence on Mr. Bosworth Smith who was one of the Martial Law  officers against whom the complaints about persistent and continuous  ill-treatment were among the bitterest. It appears from the  correspondence that Mr. Bosworth Smith has received promotion instead of  dismissal. Sometime before Martial Law Mr. Smith appears to have been  degraded. \"He has since been restored,\" says the _Leader_ correspondent,  \"to his position of a Deputy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10376"],[0,"American Indian Stories (#12)"],[1," me a clear path to the white man's cattle. With my  hand upon the knife in my belt, I leaned heavily against the fence while  counting the herd.    Twenty in all I numbered. From among them I chose the best-fattened  creature. Leaping over the fence, I plunged my knife into it.    My long knife was sharp, and my hands, no more fearful and slow, slashed  off choice chunks of warm flesh. Bending under the meat I had taken for  my starving father, I hurried across the prairie.    Toward home I fairly ran with the life-giving food I carried upon my  back. Hardly had I climbed the second hill when I heard sounds coming  after me. Faster and faster I ran with my load for my father, but the  sounds were gaining upon me. I heard the clicking of snowshoes and the  squeaking of the leather straps at my heels; yet I did not turn to see  what pursued me, for I was intent upon reaching my father. Suddenly like  thunder an angry voice shouted curses and threats into my ear! A rough  hand wrenched my shoulder and took the meat from me! I stopped  struggling to run. A deafening whir filled my head. The moon and stars  began to move. Now the white prairie was sky, and the stars lay under my  feet. Now again they were turning. At last the starry blue rose up into  place. The noise in my ears was still. A great quiet filled the air. In  my hand I found my long knife dripping with blood. At my feet a man's  figure lay prone in blood-red snow. The horrible scene about me seemed a  trick of my senses, for I could not understand it was real. Looking  long upon the blood-stained snow, the load of meat for my starving  father reached my recognition at last. Quickly I tossed it over my  shoulder and started again homeward.    Tired and haunted I reached the door of the wigwam. Carrying the food  before me, I entered with it into the tepee.    \"Father, here is food!\" I cried, as I dropped the meat near my mother.  No answer came. Turning about, I beheld my gray-haired father dead! I  saw by the unsteady firelight an old gray-haired skeleton lying rigid  and stiff.    Out into the open I started, but the snow at my feet became bloody.          V.      On the day after my father's death, having led my mother to the camp of  the medicineman, I gave myself up to those who were searching for the  murderer of the paleface.    They bound me hand and foot. Here in this cell I was placed four days  ago.    The shrieking winter winds have followed me hither. Rattling the bars,  they howl unceasingly: \"Your soft heart! your soft heart will see me die  before you bring me food!\" Hark! something is clanking the chain on the  door. It is being opened. From the dark night without a black figure  crosses the threshold. * * * It is the guard. He comes to warn me of my  fate. He tells me that tomorrow I must die. In his stern face I laugh  aloud. I do not fear death.    Yet I wonder who shall come to welcome me in the realm of strange sight.  Will the loving Jesus grant me pardon and give my soul a soothing sleep?  or will my warrior father greet me and receive me as his son? Will my  spirit fly upward to a happy heaven? or shall I sink into the  bottomless pit, an outcast from a God of infinite love?    Soon, soon I shall know, for now I see the east is growing red. My heart  is strong. My face is calm. My eyes are dry and eager for new scenes. My  hands hang quietly at my side. Serene and brave, my soul awaits the men  to perch me on the gallows for another flight. I go.          THE TRIAL PATH      It was an autumn night on the plain. The smoke-lapels of the cone-shaped  tepee flapped gently in the breeze. From the low night sky, with its  myriad fire points, a large bright star peeped in at the smoke-hole of  the wigwam between its fluttering lapels, down upon two Dakotas talking  in the dark. The mellow stream from the star above, a maid of twenty  summers, on a bed of sweetgrass, drank in with her wakeful eyes. On the  opposite side of the tepee, beyond the centre fireplace, the grandmother  spread her rug. Though once she had lain down, the telling of a story  has aroused her to a sitting posture.    Her eyes are tight closed. With a thin palm she strokes her wind-shorn  hair.    \"Yes, my grandchild, the legend says the large bright stars are wise old  warriors, and the small dim ones are handsome young braves,\" she  reiterates, in a high, tremulous voice.    \"Then this one peeping in at the smoke-hole yonder is my dear old  grandfather,\" muses the young woman, in long-drawn-out words.    Her soft rich voice floats through the darkness within the tepee, over  the cold ashes heaped on the centre fire, and passes into the ear of the  toothless old woman, who sits dumb in silent reverie. Thence it flies on  swifter wing over many winter snows, till at last it cleaves the warm  light atmosphere of her grandfather's youth. From there her grandmother  made answer:    \"Listen! I am young again. It is the day of your grandfather's death.  The elder one, I mean, for there were two of them. They were like twins,  though they were not brothers. They were friends, inseparable! All  things, good and bad, they shared together, save one, which made them  mad. In that heated frenzy the younger man slew his most intimate  friend. He killed his elder brother, for long had their affection made  them kin.\"    The voice of the old woman broke. Swaying her stooped shoulders to and  fro as she sat upon her feet, she muttered vain exclamations beneath her  breath. Her eyes, closed tight against the night, beheld behind them the  light of bygone days. They saw again a rolling black cloud spread itself  over the land. Her ear heard the deep rumbling of a tempest in the  west. She bent low a cowering head, while angry thunder-birds shrieked  across the sky. \"Heya! heya!\" (No! no!) groaned the toothless  grandmother at the fury she had awakened. But the glorious peace  afterward, when yellow sunshine made the people glad, now lured her  memory onward through the storm.    \"How fast, how loud my heart beats as I listen to the messenger's  horrible tale!\" she ejaculates. \"From the fresh grave of the murdered  man he hurried to our wigwam. Deliberately crossing his bare shins, he  sat down unbidden beside my father, smoking a long-stemmed pipe. He had  scarce caught his breath when, panting, he began:    \"'He was an only son, and a much-adored brother.'    \"With wild, suspecting eyes he glanced at me as if I were in league with  the man-killer, my lover. My father, exhaling sweet-scented smoke,  assented--'How,' Then interrupting the 'Eya' on the lips of the  round-eyed talebearer, he asked, 'My friend, will you smoke?' He took  the pipe by its red-stone bowl, and pointed the long slender stem  toward the man. 'Yes, yes, my friend,' replied he, and reached out a  long brown arm.    \"For many heart-throbs he puffed out the blue smoke, which hung like a  cloud between us. But even through the smoke-mist I saw his sharp black  eyes glittering toward me. I longed to ask what doom awaited the young  murderer, but dared not open my lips, lest I burst forth into screams  instead. My father plied the question. Returning the pipe, the man  replied: 'Oh, the chieftain and his chosen men have had counsel  together. They have agreed it is not safe to allow a man-killer loose in  our midst. He who kills one of our tribe is an enemy, and must suffer  the fate of a foe.'    \"My temples throbbed like a pair of hearts!    \"While I listened, a crier passed by my father's tepee. Mounted, and  swaying with his pony's steps, he proclaimed in a loud voice these words  (hark! I hear them now!): \"Ho-po! Give ear, all you people. A terrible  deed is done. Two friends--ay, brothers in heart--have quarreled  together. Now one lies buried on the hill, while the other sits, a  dreaded man-killer, within his dwelling.\" Says our chieftain: \"He who  kills one of our tribe commits the offense of an enemy. As such he must  be tried. Let the father of the dead man choose the mode of torture or  taking of life. He has suffered livid pain, and he alone can judge how  great the punishment must be to avenge his wrong.\" It is done.    \"'Come, every one, to witness the judgment of a father upon him who was  once his son's best friend. A wild pony is now lassoed. The man-killer  must mount and ride the ranting beast. Stand you all in two parallel  lines from the centre tepee of the bereaved family to the wigwam  opposite in the great outer ring. Between you, in the wide space, is the  given trial-way. From the outer circle the rider must mount and guide  his pony toward the centre tepee. If, having gone the entire distance,  the man-killer gains the centre tepee still sitting on the pony's back,  his life is spared and pardon given. But should he fall, then he himself  has chosen death.'    \"The crier's words now cease. A lull holds the village breathless. Then  hurrying feet tear along, swish, swish, through the tall grass. Sobbing  women hasten toward the trialway. The muffled groan of the round  camp-ground is unbearable. With my face hid in the folds of my blanket,  I run with the crowd toward the open place in the outer circle of our  village. In a moment the two long files of solemn-faced people mark the  path of the public trial. Ah! I see strong men trying to lead the  lassoed pony, pitching and rearing, with white foam flying from his  mouth. I choke with pain as I recognize my handsome lover desolately  alone, striding with set face toward the lassoed pony. 'Do not fall!  Choose life and me!' I cry in my breast, but over my lips I hold my  thick blanket.    \"In an instant he has leaped astride the frightened beast, and the men  have let go their hold. Like an arrow sprung from a strong bow, the  pony, with extended nostrils, plunges halfway to the centre tepee. With  all his might the rider draws the strong reins in. The pony halts with  wooden legs. The rider is thrown forward by force, but does not fall. "]]]
