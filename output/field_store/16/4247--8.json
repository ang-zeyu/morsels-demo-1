Where there has been a want of good faith, or a       departure from the terms, beyond the necessity thus imposed,       the court has not felt itself called upon to mitigate the       penalties incurred by such a deviation.\"[114]    [Sidenote: The Vessel.]    It is not an essential deviation from the licence, if ships of other  countries than those designated in the license are employed; provided  those other countries have the same political bearing towards this  kingdom as those mentioned in the licence. But it is not a matter of  indifference to substitute a ship belonging to a country at war, for a  neutral or native ship, at the will and pleasure of the holder of the  licence.[115]    Where an enemy's ship was represented to be neutral, and under that  disguise obtained a licence and was navigated, the ship and freight  were condemned; and the cargo would have been involved in the same  fate had it been shown that the owner of the cargo was privy to the  fraud.[116]    A licence to trade in neutral bottoms does not extend to British  ships.[117]    [Sidenote: The Cargo.]    The exportation of the produce and manufactures of this country is  undoubtedly of great importance; but in time of war, it may be a  matter of serious injury to the kingdom, if the commerce of the enemy  is to be carried on in security under the abuse of British licences.  The Courts of Admiralty and Prize, therefore, as far as lie in their  power, guard against the fraudulent application of licences.    The following are a few practical rules for the guidance of  merchants:--    1. Where the goods are enumerated in the licence, the best endeavour  ought to be made to follow that enumeration. It is _not_ a fatal  departure from the licence to take on board non-enumerated articles,  if done so by mistake, or inadvertence; but an essential and  fraudulent departure from the conditions of the licence is a total  defeasance of it.[118]    2. When a licence is granted to _one_ person, it cannot be made to  extend to the protection of all other persons who may be permitted by  that person to take advantage of it.[119]    3. Where A and B have obtained a licence to import, _as for  themselves, or their agents, or the bearers of their bill of lading_,  the only persons entitled to act under that licence, are A and B, as  _importers_, or their agents, or persons holding their bills of  lading, and claiming under bills of lading, which A and B, _after  having conducted the importation from the enemy on their own account_,  have transferred to them.[120]    4. Under a licence to _import_, the British merchant must not also be  the _exporter_. He is not permitted under such a licence to go to the  enemy's country, and there act as an enemy's merchant, carrying on the  export trade of that country.[121]    5. Sometimes, in describing the property in licences, the privilege is  extended to all property of a certain class, \"to whomsoever the  property may appear to belong.\" In such cases no enquiry is ever made  as to the proprietary interest in the property; but if the words are  not introduced into the licence, it does not protect enemy's  property.[122]    [Sidenote: The Voyage.]    In the Voyage, also, the merchant must follow the licence. It is  vitiated by changing the place of shipment. Thus, where a licence was  to bring away a cargo from Bordeaux, and the party thought proper to  change the licence, and accommodate it to another port in France, it  was held by the English Admiralty that the licence was vitiated, and  the vessel and cargo were condemned.[123]    Enemies trading to the ports of this country must strictly comply with  the conditions under which that permission is granted. No voluntary  deviation from the _course_ pointed out can on any account be  tolerated; except under the pressure of irresistible necessity. The  character of enemy revives, when such a trader so deviates from his  appointed course, even if there is no _mala fides_, and he runs all  the perils of an enemy on an English coast.[124]    It is a violation of a licence to touch at an intermediate port under  a licence for a direct voyage to this country, the presumption being  that at the intermediate port the vessel might receive another  destination, or might actually deliver her cargo in that port.[125]    [Sidenote: Time.]    Of course when the period for which a licence has been granted has  expired, it no longer has any operation; yet in cases in which parties  have used due diligence, but have been prevented by accident from  carrying their intentions into effect within the time, it has been  holden that, though their licences have expired, they are entitled to  protection.[126]    A licence cannot be _ante dated_, and if granted subsequent to capture  it is no protection against condemnation. It is in its very nature  prospective, pointing to something which has not yet been done, and  cannot be done at all without such permission. Where the act has  already been done, and requires to be upheld, it must be by an express  confirmation of the act itself, as by an indemnity granted to the  party; but a licence necessarily looks to that which remains to be  done, and can extend its influence only to future operations.[127]    Note.--It has been before pointed out, that the Queen has, by her  prerogative, the power of granting licences. But the Navigation Laws  could not, of course, be dispensed with by the royal prerogative.  Various acts, therefore, were passed to alter or qualify them,  according to the new condition of things which was produced in time of  war. These acts expired with the several wars that suggested them; but  the almost total repeal of the celebrated Navigation Laws will render  the re-enactment of similar war measures almost unnecessary.        SECTION IV.        _Ransom, Recaptures, and Salvage_.    [Sidenote: Ransom.]    Sometimes circumstances will not permit property captured at sea to be  sent into port; and the captor, in such cases, may either destroy it,  or permit the original owner to redeem it.    It was formerly the general custom to redeem property from the hands  of the enemy by Ransom, and the contract is undoubtedly valid, when  municipal regulations do not intervene. It is now but little known in  the commercial law of England, for several statutes in the reign of  George the Third absolutely prohibited British subjects the privilege  of ransom of property captured at sea, unless in a case of extreme  necessity--to be judged of by the Court of Admiralty.[128]    These contracts are generally drawn up at sea, and by virtue of them,  the captain of the captor engages for the release and safe conduct of  the taken ship, in consideration of a sum of money, which the master  of the captured vessel, on behalf of himself and the owners of his  ship and cargo, engages to pay, and for the payment of which he  delivers a hostage as security. The contract is drawn up in two parts,  of which the captor has one, which is called the ransom bill; the  master of the captured vessel has the other, which operates as his  safe conduct.    By the French law this safe conduct only protects the vessel to its  own port, or its port of destination, if nearer that. In other  countries the pass allows the ship to continue its voyage; but  operates only to protect the vessel in the course prescribed, and  within the time limited by the contract. It protects only against  capture, unless by agreement it provides also against _total loss_ by  perils of the seas.    During war, and while the character of alien enemy continues, no suit  will lie in the British Courts by the enemy, in proper person, on a  ransom bill, notwithstanding it is a contract arising out of the law  of war. The remedy to enforce payment of the ransom bill for the  benefit of the enemy captor, is by an action by the imprisoned  hostage, in the courts of his own country, for the recovery of his  freedom.    The hostage consists generally of one or two principal officers of the  captured prize, more generally one only.    As the ransom is in the nature of a pledge, the ransom cannot exceed  the value of the ship, so that the master cannot bind his owner for a  larger value; and on the same principle, the captor is bound to take  the vessel or its value if abandoned by the owner, or what it sells  for if the owner is insolvent. He is also bound to maintain the  hostage, and that is an item in the ransom bill. In estimating the  ransom and expenses of the hostage as a damage or loss, they are  regarded in the nature of general average, and the several persons  interested in the ship, freight, and cargo, must all contribute  towards them.[129]    [Sidenote: Recaptures.]    Although in strictness _every_ prize legally made, may be adjudged to  the captor, yet there are cases where he ought to restore, wholly, or  in part, that which he may legally have taken from the enemy. This is  the case of recaptures.    According to the universal law of nations, the question whether the  recapture ought to be restored to the first proprietor, seems to  depend essentially on another, namely, whether the captor has become  full proprietor of the prize, _to the total extinction_ of the rights  of the first proprietor. If we admit that he may have become so, there  would be no further perfect and external obligation on the _recaptor_  to restore property which has become that of the enemy; and on which  the first proprietor has lost all claim. There may be a thousand  reasons of equity why he should not enrich himself by the spoil of his  fellow citizens or friends; but then, that restitution would not be  according to the strict rule of natural law; if indeed all claim had  so passed away.    The captor has, without doubt, a right to take away the enemy's goods.  He may, without"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13882"],[0,"John Thorndyke's Cases (#12)"],[1,"Thorndyke, the famous medico-legal expert, to act as his assistant or  junior, than my former mode of life--that of a locum tenens, or minder  of other men's practices--which had, when I was following it, seemed  intolerably irksome, now appeared to possess many desirable features;  and I found myself occasionally hankering to sit once more by the  bedside, to puzzle out the perplexing train of symptoms, and to wield  that power--the greatest, after all, possessed by man--the power to  banish suffering and ward off the approach of death itself.    Hence it was that on a certain morning of the long vacation I found  myself installed at The Larches, Burling, in full charge of the practice  of my old friend Dr. Hanshaw, who was taking a fishing holiday in  Norway. I was not left desolate, however, for Mrs. Hanshaw remained at  her post, and the roomy, old-fashioned house accommodated three visitors  in addition. One of these was Dr. Hanshaw's sister, a Mrs. Haldean, the  widow of a wealthy Manchester cotton factor; the second was her niece by  marriage, Miss Lucy Haldean, a very handsome and charming girl of  twenty-three; while the third was no less a person than Master Fred, the  only child of Mrs. Haldean, and a strapping boy of six.    \"It is quite like old times--and very pleasant old times, too--to see  you sitting at our breakfast-table, Dr. Jervis.\" With these gracious  words and a friendly smile, Mrs. Hanshaw handed me my tea-cup.    I bowed. \"The highest pleasure of the altruist,\" I replied, \"is in  contemplating the good fortune of others.\"    Mrs. Haldean laughed. \"Thank you,\" she said. \"You are quite unchanged, I  perceive. Still as suave and as--shall I say oleaginous?\"    \"No, please don't!\" I exclaimed in a tone of alarm.    \"Then I won't. But what does Dr. Thorndyke say to this backsliding on  your part? How does he regard this relapse from medical jurisprudence to  common general practice?\"    \"Thorndyke,\" said I, \"is unmoved by any catastrophe; and he not only  regards the 'Decline and Fall-off of the Medical Jurist' with  philosophic calm, but he even favours the relapse, as you call it. He  thinks it may be useful to me to study the application of medico-legal  methods to general practice.\"    \"That sounds rather unpleasant--for the patients, I mean,\" remarked Miss  Haldean.    \"Very,\" agreed her aunt. \"Most cold-blooded. What sort of man is Dr.  Thorndyke? I feel quite curious about him. Is he at all human, for  instance?\"    \"He is entirely human,\" I replied; \"the accepted tests of humanity  being, as I understand, the habitual adoption of the erect posture in  locomotion, and the relative position of the end of the thumb--\"    \"I don't mean that,\" interrupted Mrs. Haldean. \"I mean human in things  that matter.\"    \"I think those things matter,\" I rejoined. \"Consider, Mrs. Haldean, what  would happen if my learned colleague were to be seen in wig and gown,  walking towards the Law Courts in any posture other than the erect. It  would be a public scandal.\"    \"Don't talk to him, Mabel,\" said Mrs. Hanshaw; \"he is incorrigible. What  are you doing with yourself this morning, Lucy?\"    Miss Haldean (who had hastily set down her cup to laugh at my imaginary  picture of Dr. Thorndyke in the character of a quadruped) considered a  moment.    \"I think I shall sketch that group of birches at the edge of Bradham  Wood,\" she said.    \"Then, in that case,\" said I, \"I can carry your traps for you, for I  have to see a patient in Bradham.\"    \"He is making the most of his time,\" remarked Mrs. Haldean maliciously  to my hostess. \"He knows that when Mr. Winter arrives he will retire  into the extreme background.\"    Douglas Winter, whose arrival was expected in the course of the week,  was Miss Haldean's fiance. Their engagement had been somewhat  protracted, and was likely to be more so, unless one of them received  some unexpected accession of means; for Douglas was a subaltern in the  Royal Engineers, living, with great difficulty, on his pay, while Lucy  Haldean subsisted on an almost invisible allowance left her by an uncle.    I was about to reply to Mrs. Haldean when a patient was announced, and,  as I had finished my breakfast, I made my excuses and left the table.    Half an hour later, when I started along the road to the village of  Bradham, I had two companions. Master Freddy had joined the party, and  he disputed with me the privilege of carrying the \"traps,\" with the  result that a compromise was effected, by which he carried the  camp-stool, leaving me in possession of the easel, the bag, and a large  bound sketching-block.    \"Where are you going to work this morning?\" I asked, when we had trudged  on some distance.    \"Just off the road to the left there, at the edge of the wood. Not very  far from the house of the mysterious stranger.\" She glanced at me  mischievously as she made this reply, and chuckled with delight when I  rose at the bait.    \"What house do you mean?\" I inquired.    \"Ha!\" she exclaimed, \"the investigator of mysteries is aroused. He  saith, 'Ha! ha!' amidst the trumpets; he smelleth the battle afar off.\"    \"Explain instantly,\" I commanded, \"or I drop your sketch-block into the  very next puddle.\"    \"You terrify me,\" said she. \"But I will explain, only there isn't any  mystery except to the bucolic mind. The house is called Lavender  Cottage, and it stands alone in the fields behind the wood. A fortnight  ago it was let furnished to a stranger named Whitelock, who has taken it  for the purpose of studying the botany of the district; and the only  really mysterious thing about him is that no one has seen him. All  arrangements with the house-agent were made by letter, and, as far as I  can make out, none of the local tradespeople supply him, so he must get  his things from a distance--even his bread, which really is rather odd.  Now say I am an inquisitive, gossiping country bumpkin.\"    \"I was going to,\" I answered, \"but it is no use now.\"    She relieved me of her sketching appliances with pretended indignation,  and crossed into the meadow, leaving me to pursue my way alone; and when  I presently looked back, she was setting up her easel and stool, gravely  assisted by Freddy.    My \"round,\" though not a long one, took up more time than I had  anticipated, and it was already past the luncheon hour when I passed the  place where I had left Miss Haldean. She was gone, as I had expected,  and I hurried homewards, anxious to be as nearly punctual as possible.  When I entered the dining-room, I found Mrs. Haldean and our hostess  seated at the table, and both looked up at me expectantly.    \"Have you seen Lucy?\" the former inquired.    \"No,\" I answered. \"Hasn't she come back? I expected to find her here.  She had left the wood when I passed just now.\"    Mrs. Haldean knitted her brows anxiously. \"It is very strange,\" she  said, \"and very thoughtless of her. Freddy will be famished.\"    I hurried over my lunch, for two fresh messages had come in from  outlying hamlets, effectually dispelling my visions of a quiet  afternoon; and as the minutes passed without bringing any signs of the  absentees, Mrs. Haldean became more and more restless and anxious. At  length her suspense became unbearable; she rose suddenly, announcing her  intention of cycling up the road to look for the defaulters, but as she  was moving towards the door, it burst open, and Lucy Haldean staggered  into the room.    Her appearance filled us with alarm. She was deadly pale, breathless,  and wild-eyed; her dress was draggled and torn, and she trembled from  head to foot.    \"Good God, Lucy!\" gasped Mrs. Haldean. \"What has happened? And where is  Freddy?\" she added in a sterner tone.    \"He is lost!\" replied Miss Haldean in a faint voice, and with a catch in  her breath. \"He strayed away while I was painting. I have searched the  wood through, and called to him, and looked in all the meadows. Oh!  where can he have gone?\" Her sketching \"kit,\" with which she was loaded,  slipped from her grasp and rattled on to the floor, and she buried her  face in her hands and sobbed hysterically.    \"And you have dared to come back without him?\" exclaimed Mrs. Haldean.    \"I was getting exhausted. I came back for help,\" was the faint reply.    \"Of course she was exhausted,\" said Mrs. Hanshaw. \"Come, Lucy: come,  Mabel; don't make mountains out of molehills. The little man is safe  enough. We shall find him presently, or he will come home by himself.  Come and have some food, Lucy.\"    Miss Haldean shook her head. \"I can't, Mrs. Hanshaw--really I can't,\"  she said; and, seeing that she was in a state of utter exhaustion, I  poured out a glass of wine and made her drink it.    Mrs. Haldean darted from the room, and returned immediately, putting on  her hat. \"You have got to come with me and show me whore you lost him,\"  she said.    \"She can't do that, you know,\" I said rather brusquely. \"She will have  to lie down for the present. But I know the place, and will cycle up  with you.\"    \"Very well,\" replied Mrs. Haldean, \"that will do. What time was it,\" she  asked, turning to her niece, \"when you lost the child? and which way--\"    She paused abruptly, and I looked at her in surprise. She had suddenly  turned ashen and ghastly; her face had set like a mask of stone, with  parted lips and staring eyes that were fixed in horror on her niece.    There was a deathly silence for a few seconds. Then, in a terrible  voice, she demanded: \"What is that on your dress, Lucy?\" And, after a  pause, her voice rose into a shriek. \"What have you done to my boy?\"    I glanced in astonishment at the dazed and terrified girl, and then I  saw what her aunt had seen--a good-sized blood-stain halfway down the  front of her skirt, and another smaller one on her right sleeve. The  girl herself looked down at the sinister patch of red and then up at her  aunt. \"It looks like--like blood,\" she stammered. \"Yes, it is--I  think--of course it "]]]
