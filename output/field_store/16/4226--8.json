VII. PROHIBITION HAS OUTSTRIPPED SUFFRAGE, THEREFORE SUFFRAGE  SENTIMENT IS LESS STRONG.    It should be remembered that prohibition may be obtained by statutory  enactment, a privilege denied woman suffrage; that it has been largely  established by local option, another privilege denied woman suffrage.  These facts account for the larger success as indicated by relative  territory covered by prohibition and woman suffrage.          APPENDIX A    The Following Statement Shows the Extent of Suffrage Enjoyed by Women  in Other Lands:      THE AUSTRALIAN PROVINCES granted municipal suffrage to women as  follows: New South Wales, 1867; Victoria, 1869; West Australia, 1871;  South Australia, 1880; Tasmania, 1884; Queensland, 1886. They granted  full suffrage to women as follows: South Australia, 1897; West  Australia, 1899; New South Wales, 1902; Tasmania, 1903; Queensland,  1905; Victoria, 1908.           *       *       *       *       *    Full suffrage was granted to the women of The Isle of Man, 1892; New  Zealand, 1893; Finland, 1906; Norway, 1907; Denmark, 1915; Iceland,  1916.           *       *       *       *       *    CANADIAN PROVINCES extended municipal suffrage to women as follows:  Ontario, 1884, to widows and spinsters assessed for not less than  $400, married women entitled to vote on some propositions; New  Brunswick, 1886, to women and spinsters rate payers; Nova Scotia,  1887, to all women rate payers; Manitoba, 1888, to all woman rate  payers; British Columbia, 1888, widows and spinsters rate payers;  Alberta, 1888, widows and spinsters rate payers; Saskatchewan, 1888,  widows and spinsters rate payers; Prince Edward Island, 1888, widows  and spinsters property holders; Quebec, 1892, widows and spinsters  property holders. The full suffrage was granted to all women in the  Provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia in  1916.           *       *       *       *       *    SOUTH AFRICA--Municipal suffrage was extended to women as follows: In  The Transvaal, in 1854, to burghers' wives; in 1903 to white women  on a property qualification; in Cape Colony, 1882, to all women on  a property qualification; in Orange River Colony, 1904, to all women  resident householders.           *       *       *       *       *    SWEDEN--Municipal suffrage for unmarried women, School Board and  Ecclesiastical Franchise (without eligibility to office), 1862; School  Board and Poor Law (with eligibility), 1889; eligibility to municipal  and church councils, and extension of suffrage rights to married  women, 1909.           *       *       *       *       *    In ENGLAND and WALES the first extension of suffrage to women was  granted in 1834. Since that time various extensions of suffrage to men  and to women have taken place. The first woman suffrage was given to  widows and spinsters. The disability of married women was removed in  1900, and English and Welsh women now enjoy suffrage in all elections  upon the same terms as men with the sole exception of the right to  vote for members of Parliament.           *       *       *       *       *    SCOTLAND--1872--First extension of suffrage to women to elect School  Boards (with eligibility). 1881--Municipal suffrage for unmarried  women (with eligibility). 1900--Disability of married women in  municipal elections removed. 1907--Town and County Council eligibility  for married and unmarried established.           *       *       *       *       *    IRELAND--1837--First extension of suffrage to women to elect Poor  Law Guardians. 1887--Municipal suffrage granted the women of Belfast.  1894--Municipal suffrage extended to other cities. 1911--Town  and County Council eligibility for married and unmarried women  established.

Figurines.  Drab clay, painted with red or black bands and details. Two types:  (a) Horsemen; (b) Goddesses of columnar shape, often with flower  headdresses, and sometimes carrying a child.    Seals, &c.  Scarabs with designs of Egyptian appearance: cylinders, steatite or  (more commonly) glazed paste, lightly and often scratchily engraved:  hard stone seals finely engraved: flattened spheroids in steatite  with Hittite symbols on both faces, inscriptions being often garbled.    Inscriptions.  Most of those in Hittite script, both relieved and incised, found in  Syria, are of this Age, but chiefly of the earlier part of it (cf.  Illustration VI). Those in Semitic characters begin in this Age; and  to its later part (8th-7th cents.) belong important Aramaic  inscriptions, e.g. the Bar-Rekub monuments of Sinjerli (Shamal). See  tables of letter-forms appended to Palestine section, Illustrations X  & XI.      IV. Persian Period.     Imported Egyptian and Egypto-Phoenician objects (bronze bowls as in  Age III: scarabs: figure-amulets), Rhodian (pottery), Attic (coins,  small black-figure vases, &c.).    Weapons and implements.  Iron. Long swords: spearheads, socketed, often with square or diamond  mid-rib: short double-edged daggers with round pommels: chapes  (bronze) with moulded or beaten relief-work: knives, small and  slightly curved: arrow-heads (usually bronze and triangular): horse-  bits (usually bronze) with heavy knobbed side-bars: ear-rings, wire  armlets and pins (generally plain) of bronze: _fibulae_ as in Age  III: circular mirrors, plain, of bronze: anklets of heavy bronze:  kohl-pots, bronze, of hollow cylindrical form, with plain sticks.    Pottery.  As in Age II, plain, polished, rarely ring-burnished, but of less  careful workmanship (VIII, Fig. 9.) Glazed albarelli, 'pilgrim-  bottles', aryballi, &c., (as in Age III) common. White-yellow slipped  ware with bands of black survives rarely from Age III.    Stone vessels.  Bowls on inverted cup-shaped feet not uncommon (VIII, Fig. 11).    Beads and seals.  Eye-beads in mosaic glass, and other glass beads (hard stone and  bronze more rarely): conoid seals in hard crystalline stones, usually  engraved with figure praying to the Moon-god: also soft stone, glass  and paste conoids. Scarabs and scaraboids in paste. Cylinders become  scarce.      V. Hellenistic. VI. Roman. VII. Byzantine.    Most of the characteristic Syrian products of all these Periods do  not differ materially from those found in other East Mediterranean  lands, e.g. Greece and Asia Minor. The change to Persian (Sassanian)  types comes in the late seventh century A.D.    Two classes of objects, examples of the first of which are mostly of  Age III, but may be Persian, Hellenistic, or even Roman, are very  commonly met with in Syria:    1. Figurines,  single or in pairs or threes, of bronze or terra-cotta, representing  cult-types. Most common is a standing god with peaked cap, short  tunic, and arm raised in act of smiting: a seated goddess also  common: figures of animals, especially a bull; and phallic objects  (these mainly Roman).    2. Glass  plain (iridescent from decay), ribbed, or moulded, in great variety  of forms-bowls, jugs, cups, &c. Mostly late Hellenistic, Roman, and  Byzantine, and especially common and of fine quality in the Orontes  valley.    Parti-coloured glass (with white or yellow bands and threads) is  earlier (Persian Period). Painted and enamelled glass with gilt or  polychrome designs is later (ninth to fifteenth century, Arab).    [ILLUSTRATION IX: SYRIAN WEAPONS, ETC.]          CHAPTER VI      PALESTINE    [See the diagrams of flint implements, Illustrations II; pottery,  XII; alphabets, XIV & XV.]      I. General Principles.    1. Study of the pottery of the country, not merely from books but  from actual specimens, is an absolutely essential preliminary.  Without an acquaintance with this branch of Palestinian archaeology,  so thorough that any sherd presenting the least character can be  immediately assigned to its proper period, no field research of any  value can be carried out. (See further V below.)    2. A knowledge of the various Semitic alphabets is necessary for  copying inscriptions. Unless the traveller be also acquainted with  the languages he had better be cautious about copying Semitic  inscriptions; without such knowledge he runs the risk of confusing  different Semitic letters, which often closely resemble one another.  He should, however, be able to make squeezes and photographs.    The following are the languages and scripts which may be found in  Palestinian Epigraphy.    Egyptian, in Hieroglyphics.              Greek.  Babylonian Cuneiform.                    Latin.  Assyrian Cuneiform.                      Arabic, in Cufic script.  Hebrew, in ancient script.               Arabic, in modern script.  Hebrew, in square character.             Armenian (in mosaic  Phoenician.                                pavements, also graffiti  Moabite.                                   in Church of Holy  Aramaic.                                   Sepulchre).    Tables of the chief alphabetic and numeral forms of the West Semitic  scripts are given in Illustrations X & XI; for the Greek, see  Illustration IV.    3. The traveller should have had practice in making measured drawings  of buildings.    4. For some branches of work a good knowledge of Arabic is  indispensable--not the miserable pidgin jargon usually spoken by  Europeans, nor yet the highly complex literary language, which is  unintelligible to the ordinary native, but the colloquial of the  country, spoken grammatically and properly pronounced. Work done  through dragomans is never entirely satisfactory, because it requires  the unattainable condition that the dragoman should be as much a  scientific student of anthropology and of archaeology as the  traveller himself.    5. The student for whom these pages are written should not attempt  any excavation, unless he has been trained under a practical  excavator, and has learnt how work, which is essentially and  inevitably destructive of evidence, can be made to yield profitable  fruit. There is plenty of work that can be done on the surface of the  ground without excavation.    [Illustrations X & XI: Table of West Semitic Alphabets & Numerals.]    II. Sites of Towns and Villages.    1. Nomenclature.  The sites of ancient towns and villages are usually conspicuous in  Palestine, and are recognized in the local nomenclature. They are  denoted by the words _tall_, plural _tulul_, meaning 'mound', and  _khirbah_, plural _khirab_ meaning 'ruin'. These words are commonly  spelt in English _tell_ and _khirbet_ (less correctly _khurbet_) and  we use these more familiar forms here. As a rule, though not  invariably, the sense of these terms is distinguished. A tell is a  site represented by a mound of stratified accumulation, the result of  occupation extending over many centuries, and easily recognizable  among natural hillocks by its regular shape, smooth sides, and flat  top. A khirbet is a field of ruins in which there is little or no  stratification. Nearly all the sites of the latter type are the  remains of villages not older than the Byzantine or Roman period.    2. Identification of ancient sites.  This is a task less easy than it appears to be, and many of the  current identifications of Biblical sites call for revision.  Similarity of name, on which most of these identifications depend, is  apt to be misleading; in many cases sites identified thus with Old  Testament places are not older than the Byzantine Period. [1] This  similarity of name may sometimes be a mere accident; it may also  sometimes be accounted for by a transference of site, the inhabitants  having for some special reason moved their town to a new situation.  In such cases the tell representing the older site may perhaps await  identification in the neighbourhood. In attempting to establish  identifications, the date of the site, as determined from the  potsherds, and its suitability to the recorded history of the ancient  site in question, are elements of equal importance with its name.    [1] An example is Khirbet Teku'a, long identified with the Biblical  Tekoa.    Note: The traveller should be cautioned against embarking on the  study of place-names, identification of scriptural sites, &c., before  mastering the principles of Arabic phonetics. Many of the attempts  made at rendering the names of Palestinian place-names in European  books are simply grotesque. The following are the chief pitfalls:     (1) Confusion of the vowels, the pronunciation of which is obscure.   (2) The consonant _'ain_, to which the untrained European ear is  deaf, and which in consequence is often omitted. Less frequently it  may be over-conscientiously inserted in a place where it does not  exist. Sometimes the _'ain_ and its associated vowel are transposed  (as _M'alula_ for _Ma'lula_) making unpronounceable combinations of  consonants.   (3) The letter _kaf_, often dropped in pronunciation, and therefore  often omitted.   (4) The letter _ghain_, which an unaccustomed ear confuses with  either _g_ or _r_.   (5) The reduplicated letters, which a European is apt to hear and to  write as single.   (6) The nuances between the different _d_, _h_, _k_, _t_, and _s_  sounds.    3. Surface-exploration of a tell.  The stratification can rarely be studied on the surface only:  superficial indications of this are obscured by the plough, weather,  vegetation, and the activities of modern natives who grub for  building-stone and for the chance of buried treasure. Only by  trenching can the strata be exposed. An exception to this rule is  afforded by _Tell el-Hesy_ (Lachish) explored by Dr. Petrie in 1890-  1: here the erosion of a stream had exposed enough of the strata for  a reconnaissance. In the majority of cases the most that a visitor  can hope to do is to"]]]
