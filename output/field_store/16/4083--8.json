The most famous king of these Akkadians was called Sargon.    He taught his people how to write their own Semitic language in the  alphabet of the Sumerians whose territory they had just occupied. He  ruled so wisely that soon the differences between the original settlers  and the invaders disappeared and they became fast friends and lived  together in peace and harmony.    The fame of his empire spread rapidly throughout western Asia and  others, hearing of this success, were tempted to try their own luck.    A new tribe of desert nomads, called the Amorites, broke up camp and  moved northward.    Thereupon the valley was the scene of a great turmoil until an Amorite  chieftain by the name of Hammurapi (or Hammurabi, as you please)  established himself in the town of Bab-Illi (which means the Gate of the  God) and made himself the ruler of a great Bab-Illian or  Babylonian Empire.    This Hammurapi, who lived twenty-one centuries before the birth of  Christ, was a very interesting man. He made Babylon the most important  town of the ancient world, where learned priests administered the laws  which their great Ruler had received from the Sun God himself and where  the merchant loved to trade because he was treated fairly and honorably.    Indeed if it were not for the lack of space (these laws of Hammurapi  would cover fully forty of these pages if I were to give them to you in  detail) I would be able to show you that this ancient Babylonian State  was in many respects better managed and that the people were happier and  that law and order was maintained more carefully and that there was  greater freedom of speech and thought than in many of our modern  countries.    But our world was never meant to be too perfect and soon other hordes of  rough and murderous men descended from the northern mountains and  destroyed the work of Hammurapi's genius.    The name of these new invaders was the Hittites. Of these Hittites I can  tell you even less than of the Sumerians. The Bible mentions them. Ruins  of their civilization have been found far and wide. They used a strange  sort of hieroglyphics but no one has as yet been able to decipher these  and read their meaning. They were not greatly gifted as administrators.  They ruled only a few years and then their domains fell to pieces.    Of all their glory there remains nothing but a mysterious name and the  reputation of having destroyed many things which other people had built  up with great pain and care.    Then came another invasion which was of a very different nature.    A fierce tribe of desert wanderers, who murdered and pillaged in the  name of their great God Assur, left Arabia and marched northward until  they reached the slopes of the mountains. Then they turned eastward and  along the banks of the Euphrates they built a city which they called  Ninua, a name which has come down to us in the Greek form of Nineveh. At  once these new-comers, who are generally known as the Assyrians, began a  slow but terrible warfare upon all the other inhabitants of Mesopotamia.    In the twelfth century before Christ they made a first attempt to  destroy Babylon but after a first success on the part of their King,  Tiglath Pileser, they were defeated and forced to return to their  own country.    Five hundred years later they tried again. An adventurous general by the  name of Bulu made himself master of the Assyrian throne. He assumed the  name of old Tiglath Pileser, who was considered the national hero of the  Assyrians and announced his intention of conquering the whole world.    [Illustration: NINEVEH.]    He was as good as his word.    Asia Minor and Armenia and Egypt and Northern Arabia and Western Persia  and Babylonia became Assyrian provinces. They were ruled by Assyrian  governors, who collected the taxes and forced all the young men to serve  as soldiers in the Assyrian armies and who made themselves thoroughly  hated and despised both for their greed and their cruelty.    Fortunately the Assyrian Empire at its greatest height did not last very  long. It was like a ship with too many masts and sails and too small a  hull. There were too many soldiers and not enough farmers--too many  generals and not enough business men.    The King and the nobles grew very rich but the masses lived in squalor  and poverty. Never for a moment was the country at peace. It was for  ever fighting someone, somewhere, for causes which did not interest the  subjects at all. Until, through this continuous and exhausting warfare,  most of the Assyrian soldiers had been killed or maimed and it became  necessary to allow foreigners to enter the army. These foreigners had  little love for their brutal masters who had destroyed their homes and  had stolen their children and therefore they fought badly.    Life along the Assyrian frontier was no longer safe.    Strange new tribes were constantly attacking the northern boundaries.  One of these was called the Cimmerians. The Cimmerians, when we first  hear of them, inhabited the vast plain beyond the northern mountains.  Homer describes their country in his account of the voyage of Odysseus  and he tells us that it was a place \"for ever steeped in darkness.\" They  were a race of white men and they had been driven out of their former  homes by still another group of Asiatic wanderers, the Scythians.    The Scythians were the ancestors of the modern Cossacks, and even in  those remote days they were famous for their horsemanship.    [Illustration: NINEVEH DESTROYED.]    The Cimmerians, hard pressed by the Scythians, crossed from Europe into  Asia and conquered the land of the Hittites. Then they left the  mountains of Asia Minor and descended into the valley of Mesopotamia,  where they wrought terrible havoc among the impoverished people of the  Assyrian Empire.    Nineveh called for volunteers to stop this invasion. Her worn-out  regiments marched northward when news came of a more immediate and  formidable danger.    For many years a small tribe of Semitic nomads, called the Chaldeans,  had been living peacefully in the south-eastern part of the fertile  valley, in the country called Ur. Suddenly these Chaldeans had gone upon  the war-path and had begun a regular campaign against the Assyrians.    Attacked from all sides, the Assyrian State, which had never gained the  good-will of a single neighbor, was doomed to perish.    When Nineveh fell and this forbidding treasure house, filled with the  plunder of centuries, was at last destroyed, there was joy in every hut  and hamlet from the Persian Gulf to the Nile.    And when the Greeks visited the Euphrates a few generations later and  asked what these vast ruins, covered with shrubs and trees might be,  there was no one to tell them.    The people had hastened to forget the very name of the city that had  been such a cruel master and had so miserably oppressed them.    Babylon, on the other hand, which had ruled its subjects in a very  different way, came back to life.    During the long reign of the wise King Nebuchadnezzar the ancient  temples were rebuilt. Vast palaces were erected within a short space of  time. New canals were dug all over the valley to help irrigate the  fields. Quarrelsome neighbors were severely punished.    Egypt was reduced to a mere frontier-province and Jerusalem, the capital  of the Jews, was destroyed. The Holy Books of Moses were taken to  Babylon and several thousand Jews were forced to follow the Babylonian  King to his capital as hostages for the good behavior of those who  remained behind in Palestine.    But Babylon was made into one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.    Trees were planted along the banks of the Euphrates.    Flowers were made to grow upon the many walls of the city and after a  few years it seemed that a thousand gardens were hanging from the roofs  of the ancient town.    As soon as the Chaldeans had made their capital the show-place of the  world they devoted their attention to matters of the mind and of  the spirit.    Like all desert folk they were deeply interested in the stars which at  night had guided them safely through the trackless desert.    They studied the heavens and named the twelve signs of the Zodiak.    They made maps of the sky and they discovered the first five planets. To  these they gave the names of their Gods. When the Romans conquered  Mesopotamia they translated the Chaldean names into Latin and that  explains why today we talk of Jupiter and Venus and Mars and Mercury  and Saturn.    They divided the equator into three hundred and sixty degrees and they  divided the day into twenty-four hours and the hour into sixty minutes  and no modern man has ever been able to improve upon this old Babylonian  invention. They possessed no watches but they measured time by the  shadow of the sun-dial.    They learned to use both the decimal and the duodecimal systems  (nowadays we use only the decimal system, which is a great pity). The  duodecimal system (ask your father what the word means), accounts for  the sixty minutes and the sixty seconds and the twenty-four hours which  seem to have so little in common with our modern world which would have  divided day and night into twenty hours and the hour into fifty minutes  and the minute into fifty seconds according to the rules of the  restricted decimal system.    The Chaldeans also were the first people to recognize the necessity of a  regular day of rest.    When they divided the year into weeks they ordered that six days of  labor should be followed by one day, devoted to the \"peace of the soul.\"    [Illustration: THE CHALDEANS.]    It was a great pity that the center of so much intelligence and industry  could not exist for ever. But not even the genius of a number of very  wise Kings could save the ancient people of Mesopotamia from their  ultimate fate.    The Semitic world was growing old.

I've seen none  of the creatures since yesterday morning, early.'    She looked at me, in a curiously puzzled manner; as though not  comprehending. Then, intelligence swept into her eyes, and fear; but she  said nothing, beyond an unintelligible murmur of acquiescence. After  that, I kept silence; it was evident that any reference to the  Swine-things, was more than her shaken nerves could bear.    Breakfast over, I went up to the tower. Here, during the greater part  of the day, I maintained a strict watch over the gardens. Once or twice,  I went down to the basement, to see how my sister was getting along.  Each time, I found her quiet, and curiously submissive. Indeed, on the  last occasion, she even ventured to address me, on her own account, with  regard to some household matter that needed attention. Though this was  done with an almost extraordinary timidity, I hailed it with happiness,  as being the first word, voluntarily spoken, since the critical moment,  when I had caught her unbarring the back door, to go out among those  waiting brutes. I wondered whether she was aware of her attempt, and how  near a thing it had been; but refrained from questioning her, thinking  it best to let well alone.    That night, I slept in a bed; the first time for two nights. In the  morning, I rose early, and took a walk through the house. All was as it  should be, and I went up to the tower, to have a look at the gardens.  Here, again, I found perfect quietness.    At breakfast, when I met Mary, I was greatly pleased to see that she  had sufficiently regained command over herself, to be able to greet me  in a perfectly natural manner. She talked sensibly and quietly; only  keeping carefully from any mention of the past couple of days. In this,  I humored her, to the extent of not attempting to lead the conversation  in that direction.    Earlier in the morning, I had been to see Pepper. He was mending,  rapidly; and bade fair to be on his legs, in earnest, in another day or  two. Before leaving the breakfast table, I made some reference to his  improvement. In the short discussion that followed, I was surprised to  gather, from my sister's remarks, that she was still under the  impression that his wound had been given by the wildcat, of my  invention. It made me feel almost ashamed of myself for deceiving her.  Yet, the lie had been told to prevent her from being frightened. And  then, I had been sure that she must have known the truth, later, when  those brutes had attacked the house.    During the day, I kept on the alert; spending much of my time, as on  the previous day, in the tower; but not a sign could I see of the  Swine-creatures, nor hear any sound. Several times, the thought had come  to me, that the Things had, at last, left us; but, up to this time, I  had refused to entertain the idea, seriously; now, however, I began to  feel that there was reason for hope. It would soon be three days since I  had seen any of the Things; but still, I intended to use the utmost  caution. For all that I could tell, this protracted silence might be a  ruse to tempt me from the house--perhaps right into their arms. The  thought of such a contingency, was, alone, sufficient to make me  circumspect.    So it was, that the fourth, fifth and sixth days went by, quietly,  without my making any attempt to leave the house.    On the sixth day, I had the pleasure of seeing Pepper, once more, upon  his feet; and, though still very weak, he managed to keep me company  during the whole of that day.        _XI_    THE SEARCHING OF THE GARDENS    How slowly the time went; and never a thing to indicate that any of the  brutes still infested the gardens.    It was on the ninth day that, finally, I decided to run the risk, if  any there were, and sally out. With this purpose in view, I loaded one  of the shotguns, carefully--choosing it, as being more deadly than a  rifle, at close quarters; and then, after a final scrutiny of the  grounds, from the tower, I called Pepper to follow me, and made my way  down to the basement.    At the door, I must confess to hesitating a moment. The thought of what  might be awaiting me among the dark shrubberies, was by no means  calculated to encourage my resolution. It was but a second, though, and  then I had drawn the bolts, and was standing on the path outside  the door.    Pepper followed, stopping at the doorstep to sniff, suspiciously; and  carrying his nose up and down the jambs, as though following a scent.  Then, suddenly, he turned, sharply, and started to run here and there,  in semicircles and circles, all around the door; finally returning to  the threshold. Here, he began again to nose about.    Hitherto, I had stood, watching the dog; yet, all the time, with half  my gaze on the wild tangle of gardens, stretching 'round me. Now, I went  toward him, and, bending down, examined the surface of the door, where  he was smelling. I found that the wood was covered with a network of  scratches, crossing and recrossing one another, in inextricable  confusion. In addition to this, I noticed that the doorposts,  themselves, were gnawed in places. Beyond these, I could find nothing;  and so, standing up, I began to make the tour of the house wall.    Pepper, as soon as I walked away, left the door, and ran ahead, still  nosing and sniffing as he went along. At times, he stopped to  investigate. Here, it would be a bullet-hole in the pathway, or,  perhaps, a powder stained wad. Anon, it might be a piece of torn sod, or  a disturbed patch of weedy path; but, save for such trifles, he found  nothing. I observed him, critically, as he went along, and could  discover nothing of uneasiness, in his demeanor, to indicate that he  felt the nearness of any of the creatures. By this, I was assured that  the gardens were empty, at least for the present, of those hateful  Things. Pepper could not be easily deceived, and it was a relief to feel  that he would know, and give me timely warning, if there were  any danger.    Reaching the place where I had shot that first creature, I stopped, and  made a careful scrutiny; but could see nothing. From there, I went on to  where the great copingstone had fallen. It lay on its side, apparently  just as it had been left when I shot the brute that was moving it. A  couple of feet to the right of the nearer end, was a great dent in the  ground; showing where it had struck. The other end was still within the  indentation--half in, and half out. Going nearer, I looked at the stone,  more closely. What a huge piece of masonry it was! And that creature had  moved it, single-handed, in its attempt to reach what lay below.    I went 'round to the further end of the stone. Here, I found that it  was possible to see under it, for a distance of nearly a couple of feet.  Still, I could see nothing of the stricken creatures, and I felt much  surprised. I had, as I have before said, guessed that the remains had  been removed; yet, I could not conceive that it had been done so  thoroughly as not to leave some certain sign, beneath the stone,  indicative of their fate. I had seen several of the brutes struck down  beneath it, with such force that they must have been literally driven  into the earth; and now, not a vestige of them was to be seen--not even  a bloodstain.    I felt more puzzled, than ever, as I turned the matter over in my mind;  but could think of no plausible explanation; and so, finally, gave it  up, as one of the many things that were unexplainable.    From there, I transferred my attention to the study door. I could see,  now, even more plainly, the effects of the tremendous strain, to which  it had been subjected; and I marveled how, even with the support  afforded by the props, it had withstood the attacks, so well. There were  no marks of blows--indeed, none had been given--but the door had been  literally riven from its hinges, by the application of enormous, silent  force. One thing that I observed affected me profoundly--the head of one  of the props had been driven right through a panel. This was, of itself,  sufficient to show how huge an effort the creatures had made to break  down the door, and how nearly they had succeeded.    Leaving, I continued my tour 'round the house, finding little else of  interest; save at the back, where I came across the piece of piping I  had torn from the wall, lying among the long grass underneath the  broken window.    Then, I returned to the house, and, having re-bolted the back door,  went up to the tower. Here, I spent the afternoon, reading, and  occasionally glancing down into the gardens. I had determined, if the  night passed quietly, to go as far as the Pit, on the morrow. Perhaps, I  should be able to learn, then, something of what had happened. The day  slipped away, and the night came, and went much as the last few  nights had gone.    When I rose the morning had broken, fine and clear; and I determined to  put my project into action. During breakfast, I considered the matter,  carefully; after which, I went to the study for my shotgun. In addition,  I loaded, and slipped into my pocket, a small, but heavy, pistol. I  quite understood that, if there were any danger, it lay in the direction  of the Pit and I intended to be prepared.    Leaving the study, I went down to the back door, followed by Pepper.  Once outside, I took a quick survey of the surrounding gardens, and then  set off toward the Pit. On the way, I kept a sharp outlook, holding my  gun, handily. Pepper was running ahead, I noticed, without any apparent  hesitation. From this, I augured that there was no imminent danger to be  apprehended, and I stepped out more quickly in his wake. He had reached  the top of the Pit, now, and was nosing his way along the edge.    A minute later, I was beside him, looking down into the Pit. For a  moment, I could scarcely"]]]
