Then  followed others, showing the changes which had been produced by art, to  employ and set off the natural advantages of the locality. From these to  their own property and their own grounds, the transition was easy.    Everybody was pleased. The chart which the Captain had sketched was  brought and spread out. The only difficulty was, that they could not  entirely free themselves of the plan in which Charlotte had begun.  However, an easier way up the hill was found; a lodge was suggested to  be built on the height at the edge of the cliff, which was to have an  especial reference to the castle. It was to form a conspicuous object  from the castle windows, and from it the spectator was to be able to  overlook both the castle and the garden.    The Captain had thought it all carefully over, and taken his  measurements; and now he brought up again the village road and the wall  by the brook, and the ground which was to be raised behind it.    \"Here you see,\" said he, \"while I make this charming walk up the height,  I gain exactly the quantity of stone which I require for that wall. Let  one piece of work help the other, and both will be carried out most  satisfactorily and most rapidly.\"    \"But now,\" said Charlotte, \"comes my side of the business. A certain  definite outlay of money will have to be made. We ought to know how much  will be wanted for such a purpose, and then we can apportion it out--so  much work, and so much money, if not by weeks, at least by months. The  cash-box is under my charge. I pay the bills, and I keep the accounts.\"    \"You do not appear to have overmuch confidence in us,\" said Edward.    \"I have not much in arbitrary matters,\" Charlotte answered. \"Where it is  a case of inclination, we women know better how to control ourselves  than you.\"    It was settled; the dispositions were made, and the work was begun at  once.    The Captain being always on the spot, Charlotte was almost daily a  witness to the strength and clearness of his understanding. He, too,  learnt to know her better; and it became easy for them both to work  together, and thus bring something to completeness. It is with work as  with dancing; persons who keep the same step must grow indispensable to  one another. Out of this a mutual kindly feeling will necessarily arise;  and that Charlotte had a real kind feeling toward the Captain, after she  came to know him better, was sufficiently proved by her allowing him to  destroy her pretty seat, which in her first plans she had taken such  pains in ornamenting, because it was in the lay of his own, without  experiencing the slightest feeling about the matter.          CHAPTER VII      Now that Charlotte was occupied with the Captain, it was a natural  consequence that Edward should attach himself more to Ottilie.  Independently of this, indeed, for some time past he had begun to feel a  silent kind of attraction toward her. Obliging and attentive she was to  every one, but his self-love whispered that toward him she was  particularly so. She had observed his little fancies about his food. She  knew exactly what things he liked, and the way in which he liked them to  be prepared; the quantity of sugar which he liked in his tea; and so on.  Moreover, she was particularly careful to prevent draughts, about which  he was excessively sensitive, and, indeed, about which, with his wife,  who could never have air enough, he was often at variance. So, too, she  had come to know about fruit-gardens and flower-gardens; whatever he  liked, it was her constant effort to procure for him, and to keep away  whatever annoyed him; so that very soon she grew indispensable to  him--she became like his guardian angel, and he felt it keenly whenever  she was absent. Besides all this, too, she appeared to grow more open  and conversible as soon as they were alone together.    Edward, as he advanced in life, had retained something childish about  himself, which corresponded singularly well with the youthfulness of  Ottilie. They liked talking of early times, when they had first seen  each other; and these reminiscences led them up to the first epoch of  Edward's affection for Charlotte. Ottilie declared that she remembered  them both as the handsomest pair about the court; and when Edward would  question the possibility of this, when she must have been so exceedingly  young, she insisted that she recollected one particular incident as  clearly as possible. He had come into the room where her aunt was, and  she had hid her face in Charlotte's lap--not from fear, but from a  childish surprise. She might have added, because he had made so strong  an impression upon her--because she had liked him so much.    While they were occupied in this way, much of the business which the  two friends had undertaken together had come to a standstill; so that  they found it necessary to inspect how things were going on--to work up  a few designs and get letters written. For this purpose, they betook  themselves to their office, where they found their old copyist at his  desk. They set themselves to their work, and soon gave the old man  enough to do, without observing that they were laying many things on his  shoulders which at other times they had always done for themselves. At  the same time, the first design the Captain tried would not answer, and  Edward was as unsuccessful with his first letter. They fretted for a  while, planning and erasing, till at last Edward, who was getting on the  worst, asked what o'clock it was. And then it appeared that the Captain  had forgotten, for the first time for many years, to wind up his  chronometer; and they seemed, if not to feel, at least to have a dim  perception, that time was beginning to be indifferent to them.    In the meanwhile, as the gentlemen were thus rather slackening in their  energy, the activity of the ladies increased all the more. The every-day  life of a family, which is composed of given persons, and is shaped out  of necessary circumstances, may easily receive into itself an  extraordinary affection, an incipient passion--may receive it into  itself as into a vessel; and a long time may elapse before the new  ingredient produces a visible effervescence, and runs foaming over the  edge.    With our friends, the feelings which were mutually arising had the most  agreeable effects. Their dispositions opened out, and a general goodwill  arose out of the several individual affections. Every member of the  party was happy; and they each shared their happiness with the rest.    Such a temper elevates the spirit, while it enlarges the heart, and  everything which, under the influence of it, people do and undertake,  has a tendency toward the illimitable. The friends could not remain any  more shut up at home; their walks extended themselves further and  further. Edward would hurry on before with Ottilie, to choose the path  or pioneer the way; and the Captain and Charlotte would follow quietly  on the track of their more hasty precursors, talking on some grave  subject, or delighting themselves with some spot they had newly  discovered, or some unexpected natural beauty.    One day their walk led them down from the gate at the right wing of the  castle, in the direction of the hotel, and thence over the bridge toward  the ponds, along the sides of which they proceeded as far as it was  generally thought possible to follow the water; thickly wooded hills  sloped directly up from the edge, and beyond these a wall of steep  rocks, making further progress difficult, if not impossible. But Edward,  whose hunting experience had made him thoroughly familiar with the spot,  pushed forward along an overgrown path with Ottilie, knowing well that  the old mill could not be far off, which was somewhere in the middle of  the rocks there. The path was so little frequented, that they soon lost  it; and for a short time they were wandering among mossy stones and  thickets; it was not for long, however, the noise of the water-wheel  speedily telling them that the place which they were looking for was  close at hand. Stepping forward on a point of rock, they saw the strange  old, dark, wooden building in the hollow before them, quite shadowed  over with precipitous crags and huge trees. They determined directly to  climb down amidst the moss and the blocks of stone. Edward led the way;  and when he looked back and saw Ottilie following, stepping lightly,  without fear or nervousness, from stone to stone, so beautifully  balancing herself, he fancied he was looking at some celestial creature  floating above him; while if, as she often did, she caught the hand  which in some difficult spot he would offer her, or if she supported  herself on his shoulder, then he was left in no doubt that it was a very  exquisite human creature who touched him. He almost wished that she  might slip or stumble, that he might catch her in his arms and press  her to his heart. This, however, he would under no circumstances have  done, for more than one reason. He was afraid to wound her, and he was  afraid to do her some bodily injury.    [Illustration: EDWARD AND OTTILIE]    What the meaning of this could be, we shall immediately learn. When they  had got down, and were seated opposite each other at a table under the  trees, and when the miller's wife had gone for milk, and the miller, who  had come out to them, was sent to meet Charlotte and the Captain,  Edward, with a little embarrassment, began to speak:    \"I have a request to make, dear Ottilie; you will forgive me for asking  it, if you will not grant it. You make no secret (I am sure you need not  make any), that you wear a miniature under your dress against your  breast. It is the picture of your noble father. You could hardly have  known him; but in every sense he deserves a place by your heart. Only,  forgive me, the picture is exceedingly large, and the metal frame and  the glass, if you take up a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11367"],[0,"A History of China (#12)"],[1," his estate, where he  died in old age. This, too, may be legendary, but it fits well into the  picture given to us by Lao Tz[)u]'s teaching and by the life of his  later followers. From the second century A.D., that is to say at least  four hundred years after his death, there are legends of his migrating  to the far west. Still later narratives tell of his going to Turkestan  (where a temple was actually built in his honour in the Medieval  period); according to other sources he travelled as far as India or  Sogdiana (Samarkand and Bokhara), where according to some accounts he  was the teacher or forerunner of Buddha, and according to others of  Mani, the founder of Manichaeism. For all this there is not a vestige of  documentary evidence.    Lao Tz[)u]'s teaching is contained in a small book, the _Tao Te Ching_,  the \"Book of the World Law and its Power\". The book is written in quite  simple language, at times in rhyme, but the sense is so vague that  countless versions, differing radically from each other, can be based on  it, and just as many translations are possible, all philologically  defensible. This vagueness is deliberate.    Lao Tz[)u]'s teaching is essentially an effort to bring man's life on  earth into harmony with the life and law of the universe (Tao). This was  also Confucius's purpose. But while Confucius set out to attain that  purpose in a sort of primitive scientific way, by laying down a number  of rules of human conduct, Lao Tz[)u] tries to attain his ideal by an  intuitive, emotional method. Lao Tz[)u] is always described as a mystic,  but perhaps this is not entirely appropriate; it must be borne in mind  that in his time the Chinese language, spoken and written, still had  great difficulties in the expression of ideas. In reading Lao Tz[)u]'s  book we feel that he is trying to express something for which the  language of his day was inadequate; and what he wanted to express  belonged to the emotional, not the intellectual, side of the human  character, so that any perfectly clear expression of it in words was  entirely impossible. It must be borne in mind that the Chinese language  lacks definite word categories like substantive, adjective, adverb, or  verb; any word can be used now in one category and now in another, with  a few exceptions; thus the understanding of a combination like \"white  horse\" formed a difficult logical problem for the thinker of the fourth  century B.C.: did it mean \"white\" plus \"horse\"? Or was \"white horse\" no  longer a horse at all but something quite different?    Confucius's way of bringing human life into harmony with the life of the  universe was to be a process of assimilating Man as a social being, Man  in his social environment, to Nature, and of so maintaining his activity  within the bounds of the community. Lao Tz[)u] pursues another path, the  path for those who feel disappointed with life in the community. A  Taoist, as a follower of Lao Tz[)u] is called, withdraws from all social  life, and carries out none of the rites and ceremonies which a man of  the upper class should observe throughout the day. He lives in  self-imposed seclusion, in an elaborate primitivity which is often  described in moving terms that are almost convincing of actual  \"primitivity\". Far from the city, surrounded by Nature, the Taoist lives  his own life, together with a few friends and his servants, entirely  according to his nature. His own nature, like everything else,  represents for him a part of the Tao, and the task of the individual  consists in the most complete adherence to the Tao that is conceivable,  as far as possible performing no act that runs counter to the Tao. This  is the main element of Lao Tz[)u]'s doctrine, the doctrine of _wu-wei_,  \"passive achievement\".    Lao Tz[)u] seems to have thought that this doctrine could be applied to  the life of the state. He assumed that an ideal life in society was  possible if everyone followed his own nature entirely and no artificial  restrictions were imposed. Thus he writes: \"The more the people are  forbidden to do this and that, the poorer will they be. The more sharp  weapons the people possess, the more will darkness and bewilderment  spread through the land. The more craft and cunning men have, the more  useless and pernicious contraptions will they invent. The more laws and  edicts are imposed, the more thieves and bandits there will be. 'If I  work through Non-action,' says the Sage, 'the people will transform  themselves.'\"[1] Thus according to Lao Tz[)u], who takes the existence  of a monarchy for granted, the ruler must treat his subjects as follows:  \"By emptying their hearts of desire and their minds of envy, and by  filling their stomachs with what they need; by reducing their ambitions  and by strengthening their bones and sinews; by striving to keep them  without the knowledge of what is evil and without cravings. Thus are the  crafty ones given no scope for tempting interference. For it is by  Non-action that the Sage governs, and nothing is really left  uncontrolled.\"[2]    [Footnote 1: _The Way of Acceptance_: a new version of Lao Tz[)u]'s _Tao  Te Ching_, by Hermon Ould (Dakers, 1946), Ch. 57.]    [Footnote 2: _The Way of Acceptance_, Ch. 3.]    Lao Tz[)u] did not live to learn that such rule of good government would  be followed by only one sort of rulers--dictators; and as a matter of  fact the \"Legalist theory\" which provided the philosophic basis for  dictatorship in the third century B.C. was attributable to Lao Tz[)u].  He was not thinking, however, of dictatorship; he was an individualistic  anarchist, believing that if there were no active government all men  would be happy. Then everyone could attain unity with Nature for  himself. Thus we find in Lao Tz[)u], and later in all other Taoists, a  scornful repudiation of all social and official obligations. An answer  that became famous was given by the Taoist Chuang Tz[)u] (see below)  when it was proposed to confer high office in the state on him (the  story may or may not be true, but it is typical of Taoist thought): \"I  have heard,\" he replied, \"that in Ch'u there is a tortoise sacred to the  gods. It has now been dead for 3,000 years, and the king keeps it in a  shrine with silken cloths, and gives it shelter in the halls of a  temple. Which do you think that tortoise would prefer--to be dead and  have its vestigial bones so honoured, or to be still alive and dragging  its tail after it in the mud?\" the officials replied: \"No doubt it would  prefer to be alive and dragging its tail after it in the mud.\" Then  spoke Chuang Tz[)u]: \"Begone! I, too, would rather drag my tail after me  in the mud!\" (Chuang Tz[)u] 17, 10.)    The true Taoist withdraws also from his family. Typical of this is  another story, surely apocryphal, from Chuang Tz[)u] (Ch. 3, 3). At the  death of Lao Tz[)u] a disciple went to the family and expressed his  sympathy quite briefly and formally. The other disciples were  astonished, and asked his reason. He said: \"Yes, at first I thought that  he was our man, but he is not. When I went to grieve, the old men were  bewailing him as though they were bewailing a son, and the young wept as  though they were mourning a mother. To bind them so closely to himself,  he must have spoken words which he should not have spoken, and wept  tears which he should not have wept. That, however, is a falling away  from the heavenly nature.\"    Lao Tz[)u]'s teaching, like that of Confucius, cannot be described as  religion; like Confucius's, it is a sort of social philosophy, but of  irrationalistic character. Thus it was quite possible, and later it  became the rule, for one and the same person to be both Confucian and  Taoist. As an official and as the head of his family, a man would think  and act as a Confucian; as a private individual, when he had retired far  from the city to live in his country mansion (often modestly described  as a cave or a thatched hut), or when he had been dismissed from his  post or suffered some other trouble, he would feel and think as a  Taoist. In order to live as a Taoist it was necessary, of course, to  possess such an estate, to which a man could retire with his servants,  and where he could live without himself doing manual work. This  difference between the Confucian and the Taoist found a place in the  works of many Chinese poets. I take the following quotation from an  essay by the statesman and poet Ts'ao Chih, of the end of the second  century A.D.:    \"Master Mysticus lived in deep seclusion on a mountain in the  wilderness; he had withdrawn as in flight from the world, desiring to  purify his spirit and give rest to his heart. He despised official  activity, and no longer maintained any relations with the world; he  sought quiet and freedom from care, in order in this way to attain  everlasting life. He did nothing but send his thoughts wandering between  sky and clouds, and consequently there was nothing worldly that could  attract and tempt him.    [Illustration: 1 Painted pottery from Kansu: Neolithic. _In the  collection of the Museum fuer Voelkerkunde, Berlin_.]    [Illustration: 2 Ancient bronze tripod found at Anyang. _From G.

He harnessed four horses, who  could quickly traverse the plain, and entered his light fast carriage.  He drove through the plain, leaving behind him the ruins of abandoned  settlements; he entered the boundless wilderness, and finally reached  the dwelling of Master Mysticus. Here there was a waterfall on one side,  and on the other were high crags; at the back a stream flowed deep down  in its bed, and in front was an odorous wood.
