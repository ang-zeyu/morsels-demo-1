Volume 1 (#11)"],[1,"is founded those modes of action which natural philosophers  designate by the terms _attraction, repulsion, sympathy, antipathy,  affinities, relations_; that moralists describe under the names of  _love, hatred, friendship, aversion_. Man, like all the beings in  nature, experiences the impulse of attraction and repulsion; the motion  excited in him differing from that of other beings, only, because it is  more concealed, and frequently so hidden, that neither the causes which  excite it, nor their mode of action are known. This system of attraction  and repulsion is very ancient, although it required a NEWTON to develop  it. That love, to which the ancients attributed the unfolding, or  disentanglement of chaos, appears to have been nothing more than a  personification of the principle of attraction. All their allegories and  fables upon chaos, evidently indicate nothing more than the accord or  union that exists between analogous and homogeneous substances; from  whence resulted the existence of the universe: whilst discord or  repulsion, which they called SOIS, was the cause of dissolution,  confusion, and disorder; there can scarcely remain a doubt, but this was  the origin of the doctrines of the TWO PRINCIPLES. According to DIOGENES  LAERTIUS, the philosopher, EMPEDOCLES, asserted, that \"_there is a  kind of affection by which the elements unite themselves; and a sort of  discord, by which they separate or remove themselves._\"    However it may be, it is sufficient for us to know that by an invariable  law, certain bodies are disposed to unite with more or less facility;  whilst others cannot combine or unite themselves: water combines itself  readily with salt, but will not blend with oil. Some combinations are  very strong, cohering with great force, as metals; others are extremely  feeble, their cohesion slight and easily decomposed, as in fugitive  colours. Some bodies, incapable of uniting by themselves, become  susceptible of union by the agency of other bodies, which serve for  common bonds or MEDIUMS. Thus, oil and water, naturally heterogeneous,  combine and make soap, by the intervention of alkaline salt. From matter  diversely combined, in proportions varied almost to infinity, result  all physical and moral bodies; the properties and qualities of which are  essentially different, with modes of action more or less complex: which  are either understood with facility, or difficult of comprehension,  according to the elements or matter that has entered into their  composition, and the various modifications this matter has undergone.    It is thus, from the reciprocity of their attraction, the primitive  imperceptible particles of matter, which constitute bodies, become  perceptible, form compound substances, aggregate masses; by the union  of similar and analogous matter, whose essences fit them to cohere. The  same bodies are dissolved, their union broken, whenever they undergo the  action of matter inimical to their junction. Thus by degrees are formed,  plants, metals, animals, men; each grows, expands, and increases in its  own system or order; sustaining itself in its respective existence,  by the continual attraction of analogous matter; to which it becomes  united, and by which it is preserved and strengthened. Thus, certain  aliments become fit for the sustenance of man, whilst others destroy his  existence: some are pleasant to him, strengthen his habit; others  are repugnant to him, weaken his system: in short, never to separate  physical from moral laws, it is thus that men, mutually attracted  to each other by their reciprocal wants, form those unions which we  designate by the terms, MARRIAGE, FAMILIES, SOCIETIES, FRIENDSHIPS,  CONNEXIONS: it is thus that virtue strengthens and consolidates them;  that vice relaxes or totally dissolves them.    Of whatever nature may be the combination of beings, their motion has  always one direction or tendency: without direction we could not have  any idea of motion: this direction is regulated by the properties of  each being; as soon as they have any given properties, they necessarily  act in obedience to them: that is to say, they follow the law invariably  determined by these same properties; which, of themselves, constitute  the being such as he is found, and settle his mode of action, which  is always the consequence of his manner of existence. But what is the  general direction, or common tendency, we see in all beings? What is  the visible and known end of all their motion? It is to conserve their  actual existence--to preserve themselves--to strengthen their several  bodies--to attract that which is favorable to them--to repel that  which is injurious them--to avoid that which can harm them--to resist  impulsions contrary to their manner of existence, and to their natural  tendency.    To exist, is to experience the motion peculiar to a determinate essence:  to conserve this existence, is to give and receive that motion from  which results its maintenance:--it is to attract matter suitable  to corroborate its being--to avoid that by which it may be either  endangered or enfeebled. Thus, all beings of which we have any  knowledge, have a tendency to conserve themselves, each after its  peculiar manner: the stone, by the firm adhesion of its particles,  opposes resistance to its destruction. Organized beings conserve  themselves by more complicated means, but which are, nevertheless,  calculated to maintain their existence against that by which it may  be injured. Man, both in his physical and in his moral capacity, is  a living, feeling, thinking, active being; who, every instant of his  duration, strives equally to avoid that which may be injurious, and to  procure that which is pleasing to him, or that which is suitable to his  mode of existence; all his actions tending solely to conserve himself.  ST. AUGUSTINE admits this tendency in all whether organized or not.    Conservation, then, is the common point to which all the energies, all  the powers, all the faculties of beings, seem continually directed.  Natural philosophers call this direction or tendency, SELF-GRAVITATION:  NEWTON calls it INERT FORCE: moralists denominate it in man, SELF-LOVE  which is nothing more than the tendency he has to preserve himself--a  desire of happiness--a love of his own welfare--a wish for pleasure--a  promptitude in seizing on every thing that appears favourable to  his conservation--a marked aversion to all that either disturbs his  happiness, or menaces his existence--primitive sentiments, that are  common to all beings of the human species; which all their faculties are  continually striving to satisfy; which all their passions, their wills,  their actions, have eternally for their object and their end. This  self-gravitation, then, is clearly a necessary disposition in man,  and in all other beings; which, by a variety means, contribute to the  preservation of the existence they have received, as long as nothing  deranges the order of their machine, or its primitive tendency.    Cause always produces effect; there can be no effect without cause.  Impulse is always followed by some motion, more or less sensible; by  some change, more or less remarkable in the body which receives it.  But motion, and its various modes of displaying itself, is, as has been  already shewn, determined by the nature, the essence, the properties,  the combinations of the beings acting. It must, then, be concluded that  motion, or the modes by which beings act, arises from some cause; that  as this cause is not able to move or act, but in conformity with the  manner of its being or its essential properties, it must equally be  concluded, that all the phenomena we perceive are necessary; that every  being in Nature, under the circumstances in which it is placed, and with  the given properties it possesses, cannot act otherwise than it does.    Necessity is the constant and infallible relation of causes with their  effects. Fire consumes, of necessity, combustible matter plated within  its circuit of action: man, by fatality, desires either that which  really is, or appears to be serviceable to his welfare. Nature, in all  the extraordinary appearances she exhibits, necessarily acts after her  own peculiar essence: all the beings she contains, necessarily act each  after its own a individual nature: it is by motion that the whole has  relation with its parts; and these parts with the whole: it is thus  that in the general system every thing is connected: it is itself but  an immense chain of causes and effects, which flow without ceasing, one  from the other. If we reflect, we shall be obliged to acknowledge that  every thing we see is necessary; that it cannot be otherwise than it is;  that all the beings we behold, as well as those which escape our  sight, act by invariable laws. According to these laws, heavy  bodies fall--light bodies ascend--analogous substances attract each  other--beings tend to preserve themselves--man cherishes himself; loves  that which he thinks advantageous--detests that which he has an idea may  prove unfavourable to him.--In fine, we are obliged to admit, there  can be no perfectly independent energy--no separated cause--no detached  action, in a nature where all the beings are in a reciprocity of  action--who, without interruption, mutually impel and resist each  other--who is herself nothing more than an eternal circle of motion,  given and received according to necessary laws; which under the same  given incidents, invariably produce the same effect.    Two examples will serve to throw the principle here laid down, into  light--one shall be taken from physics, the other from morals.    In a whirlwind of dust, raised by elemental force, confused as it  appears to our eyes, in the most frightful tempest excited by contrary  winds, when the waves roll high as mountains, there is not a single  particle of dust, or drop of water, that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8910"],[0,"The System of Nature, or, the Laws of the Moral and Physical World. Volume 2 (#11)"],[1,"this difference  between the being he pourtrays and himself; but he knows not at what  point to stop; he fears lest he should deceive himself, if he should see  any limits to the qualities he assigns, the word infinite, therefore, is  the abstract, the vague term which he uses to characterize them. He says  that his power is infinite, which signifies that when he beholds those  stupendous effects which nature produces, he has no conception at what  point his power can rest; that his goodness, his wisdom, his knowledge  are infinite: this announces that he is ignorant how far these  perfections ma be carried in a being whose power so much surpasses  his own; that he is of infinite duration, because he is not capable  of conceiving he could have had a beginning or can ever cease to be;  because of this he considers a defect in those transitory beings of  whom he beholds the dissolution, whom he sees are subjected to death. He  presumes the cause of those effects to which he is a witness, of those  striking phenomena that assail his sight, is immutable, permanent, not  subjected to change, like all the evanescent beings whom he knows are  submitted to dissolution, to destruction, to change of form. This mover  of nature being always invisible to man, his mode of action being,  impenetrable, he believes that, like his soul or the concealed principle  which animates his own body, which he calls spiritual, a spirit, is the  moving power of the universe; in consequence he makes a spirit the  soul, the life, the principle of motion in nature. Thus when by dint of  subtilizing, he has arrived at believing the principle by which his body  is moved is a spiritual, immaterial substance, he makes the spirit of  the universe immaterial in like manner: he makes it immense, although  without extent; immoveable, although capable of moving nature:  immutable, although he supposes him to be the author of all the changes,  operated in the universe.    The idea of the unity of God, which cost Socrates his life, because the  Athenians considered those Atheists who believed but in one, was the  tardy fruit of human meditation. Plato himself did not dare to  break entirely the doctrine of _Polytheism_; he preserved Venus, an  all-powerful Jupiter, and a Pallas, who was the goddess of the country.  The sight of those opposite, frequently contradictory effects, which man  saw take place in the world, had a tendency to persuade him there must  be a number of distinct powers or causes independent of each other. He  was unable to conceive that the various phenomena he beheld, sprung from  a single, from an unique cause; he therefore admitted many causes or  gods, acting upon different principles; some of which he considered  friendly, others as inimical to his race. Such is the origin of that  doctrine, so ancient, so universal, which supposed two principles in  nature, or two powers of opposite interests, who were perpetually at war  with each other; by the assistance of which he explained, that constant  mixture of good and evil, that blending of prosperity with misfortune,  in a word, those eternal vicissitudes to which in this world the human  being, is subjected. This is the source of those combats which all  antiquity has supposed to exist between good and wicked gods, between an  Osiris and a Typhoeus; between an Orosmadis and an Arimanis; between a  Jupiter and the Titanes; in these rencounters man for his own peculiar  interest always gave the palm of victory to the beneficent deity; this,  according to all the traditions handed down, ever remained in possession  of the field of battle; it was so far right, as it is evidently for the  benefit of mankind that the good should prevail over the wicked.    When, however, man acknowledged only one God, he generally supposed the  different departments of nature were confided to powers subordinate to  his supreme orders, under whom the sovereign of the gods discharged  his care in the administration of the world. These subaltern gods were  prodigiously multiplied; each man, each town, each country, had  their local, their tutelary gods; every event, whether fortunate or  unfortunate, had a divine cause; was the consequence of a sovereign  decree; each natural effect, every operation of nature, each passion,  depended upon a divinity, which a theological imagination, disposed  to see gods every where, mistaking nature, either embellished or  disfigured. Poetry tuned its harmonious lays, on these occasions,  exaggerated the details, animated its pictures; credulous ignorance  received the portraits with eagerness--heard the doctrines with  submission.    Such is the origin of Polytheism: indeed the Greek word _Theos_, [Greek  letters], is derived from _Theaomai_, [Greek letters], which implies  to contemplate, or take a view of secret or hidden things. Such are the  foundations, such the titles of the hierarchy, which man established  between himself and his gods, because he generally believed he was  incapable of the exalted privilege of immediately addressing himself  to the incomprehensible Being whom he had acknowledged for the only  sovereign of nature, without even having any distinct idea on the  subject: such is the true genealogy of those inferior gods whom the  uninformed place as, a proportional means between themselves and the  first of all other causes. In consequence, among the Greeks and the  Romans, we see the deities divided into two classes, the one were called  great gods, because the whole world were nearly in accord in deifying  the most striking parts of nature, such as the sun, fire; the sea, time,  &c. these formed a kind of aristocratic order, who were distinguished  from the minor gods, or from the multitude of ethnic divinities, who  were entirely local; that is to say, were reverenced only in particular  countries, or by individuals; as in Rome, where every citizen had  his familiar spirit, called lares; and household god, called penates.  Nevertheless, the first rank of these Pagan divinities, like the latter,  were submitted to Fate, that is, to destiny, which obviously is nothing  more than nature acting by immutable, rigorous, necessary laws; this  destiny was looked upon as the god of gods; it is evident, that this  was nothing more than necessity personified; that therefore it was a  weakness in the heathens to fatigue with their sacrifices, to solicit  with their prayers, those divinities whom they themselves believed were  submitted to the decrees of an inexorable destiny, of which it was never  possible for them to alter the mandates. _But man_, generally, _ceases  to reason, whenever his theological notions are either brought into  question, or are the subject of his inquiry_.    What has been already said, serves to show the common source of that  multitude of intermediate powers, subordinate to the gods, but superior  to man, with which he filled the universe: they were venerated under  the names of nymphs, demi-gods, angels, daemons, good and evil genii,  spirits, heroes, saints, &c. Among the Romans they were called _Dei  medioxumi_, intermediate angels; they were looked upon as intercessors,  as mediators, as powers whom it was necessary to reverence, in order  either to obtain their favour, appease their anger, or divert their  malignant intentions; these constitute different classes of intermediate  divinities, who became either the foundation of their hopes, the object  of their fears, the means of consolation, or the source of dread to  those very mortals who only invented them when they found it  impossible to form to themselves distinct, perspicuous ideas of the  incomprehensible Being who governed the world in chief; or when they  despaired of being able to hold communication with him directly.    Meditation and reflection diminished the number of those deities  which composed the ethnic polytheism: some who gave the subject more  consideration than others, reduced the whole to one all-powerful  Jupiter; but still they painted this being in the most hideous  colours, gave him the most revolting features, because they were still  obstinately bent on making man, his action and his passions, the model:  this folly led them into continual perplexities, because it heaped  together contradictory, incompatible, extravagant qualities; it was  quite natural it should do so: the limited views, the superficial  knowledge, the irregular desires of frail, feeble mortals, were but  little calculated to typify the mind of the real Divinity; of that great  _Cause of causes_, that _Parent of parents_, from whom every thing must  have emanated. Although they persuaded themselves it was sinning to give  him rivals, yet they described him as a jealous monarch who could not  bear a division of empire; thus taking the vanity of earthly princes for  their emblem, as if it was possible such a being could have a competitor  like a terrestrial monarch. Not having contemplated the immutable laws  with which he has invested nature, to which every thing it contains is  subjected, which are the result of the most perfect wisdom, they were  puzzled to account for the contrariety of those effects which their  weak minds led them to suppose as evils; seeing that sometimes those who  fulfilled in the most faithful manner their duties in this life, were  involved in the same ruin with the boldest, the most inconsiderate  violaters: thus in making him the immediate agent, instead of the first  author, the executive instead of the formative power, they caused him  to appear capricious, as unreasonably vindictive against his creatures,  when they ought to have known that his wisdom was unlimited, his  kindness without bounds, when he infused into nature that power which  produces these apparently contradictory effects; which, although they  seem injurious to man's interests, are, if he was but capacitated  to judge fairly, the most beneficial advantages that he can"]]]
