This he gave with great  condescension, running through the whole course of his fortunes \"even  from his boyish days.\"    He was a native of Liverpool, in England, and had followed the sea from  boyhood, until, by dint of good conduct, he had risen so far in his  profession as to be boatswain of an American ship called the Eleanor,  commanded by Captain Metcalf. In this vessel he had sailed in 1789,  on one of those casual expeditions to the northwest coast, in quest of  furs. In the course of the voyage, the captain left a small schooner,  named the Fair American, at Nootka, with a crew of five men, commanded  by his son, a youth of eighteen. She was to follow on in the track of  the Eleanor.    In February, 1790, Captain Metcalf touched at the island of Mowee, one  of the Sandwich group. While anchored here, a boat which was astern  of the Eleanor was stolen, and a seaman who was in it was killed. The  natives, generally, disclaimed the outrage, and brought the shattered  remains of the boat and the dead body of the seaman to the ship.  Supposing that they had thus appeased the anger of the captain, they  thronged, as usual, in great numbers about the vessel, to trade. Captain  Metcalf, however, determined on a bloody revenge. The Eleanor mounted  ten guns. All these he ordered to be loaded with musket-balls, nails,  and pieces of old iron, and then fired them, and the small arms of the  ship, among the natives. The havoc was dreadful; more than a hundred,  according to Young's account, were slain.    After this signal act of vengeance, Captain Metcalf sailed from Mowee,  and made for the island of Owyhee, where he was well received by  Tamaahmaah. The fortunes of this warlike chief were at that time on the  rise. He had originally been of inferior rank, ruling over only one or  two districts of Owyhee, but had gradually made himself sovereign of his  native island.    The Eleanor remained some few days at anchor here, and an apparently  friendly intercourse was kept up with the inhabitants. On the 17th  March, John Young obtained permission to pass the night on shore. On the  following morning a signal-gun summoned him to return on board.    He went to the shore to embark, but found all the canoes hauled up on  the beach and rigorously tabooed, or interdicted. He would have launched  one himself, but was informed by Tamaahmaah that if he presumed to do so  he would be put to death.    Young was obliged to submit, and remained all day in great perplexity to  account for this mysterious taboo, and fearful that some hostility was  intended. In the evening he learned the cause of it, and his uneasiness  was increased. It appeared that the vindictive act of Captain Metcalf  had recoiled upon his own head. The schooner Fair American, commanded  by his son, following in his track, had fallen into the hands of the  natives to the southward of Tocaigh Bay, and young Metcalf and four of  the crew had been massacred.    On receiving intelligence of this event, Tamaahmaah had immediately  tabooed all the canoes, and interdicted all intercourse with the ship,  lest the captain should learn the fate of the schooner, and take his  revenge upon the island. For the same reason he prevented Young from  rejoining his countrymen. The Eleanor continued to fire signals from  time to time for two days, and then sailed; concluding, no doubt, that  the boatswain had deserted.    John Young was in despair when he saw the ship make sail; and found  himself abandoned among savages;-and savages, too, sanguinary in  their character, and inflamed by acts of hostility. He was agreeably  disappointed, however, in experiencing nothing but kind treatment from  Tamaahmaah and his people. It is true, he was narrowly watched whenever  a vessel came in sight, lest he should escape and relate what had  passed; but at other times he was treated with entire confidence and  great distinction. He became a prime favorite, cabinet counsellor, and  active coadjutor of Tamaahmaah, attending him in all his excursions,  whether of business or pleasure, and aiding in his warlike and ambitious  enterprises. By degrees he rose to the rank of a chief, espoused one of  the beauties of the island, and became habituated and reconciled to his  new way of life; thinking it better, perhaps, to rule among savages  than serve among white men; to be a feathered chief than a tarpaulin  boatswain. His favor with Tamahmaah, never declined; and when that  sagacious, intrepid, and aspiring chieftain had made himself sovereign  over the whole group of islands, and removed his residence to Woahoo, he  left his faithful adherent John Young in command of Owyhee.    Such is an outline of the history of Governor Young, as furnished by  himself; and we regret that we are not able to give any account of the  state maintained by this seafaring worthy, and the manner in which he  discharged his high functions; though it is evident he had more of  the hearty familiarity of the forecastle than the dignity of the  gubernatorial office.    These long conferences were bitter trials to the patience of the  captain, who had no respect either for the governor or his island, and  was anxious to push on in quest of provisions and water. As soon as  he could get his inquisitive partners once more on board, he weighed  anchor, and made sail for the island of Woahoo, the royal residence of  Tamaahmaah.    This is the most beautiful island of the Sandwich group. It is forty-six  miles in length and twenty-three in breadth. A ridge of volcanic  mountains extends through the centre, rising into lofty peaks, and  skirted by undulating hills and rich plains, where the cabins of the  natives peep out from beneath groves of cocoanut and other luxuriant  trees.    On the 21st of February the Tonquin cast anchor in the beautiful bay  before the village of Waititi, (pronounced Whyteetee.) the abode of  Tamaahmaah. This village contained about two hundred habitations,  composed of poles set in the ground, tied together at the ends, and  thatched with grass, and was situated in an open grove of cocoanuts. The  royal palace of Tamaahmaah was a large house of two stories; the lower  of stone, the upper of wood. Round this his body-guard kept watch,  composed of twenty-four men in long blue cassocks, turned up with  yellow, and each armed with a musket.    While at anchor at this place, much ceremonious visiting and long  conferences took place between the potentate of the islands and the  partners of the company. Tamaahmaah came on board of the ship in royal  style, in his double pirogue. He was between fifty and sixty years  of age, above the middle size, large and well made, though somewhat  corpulent. He was dressed in an old suit of regimentals, with a sword  by his side, and seemed somewhat embarrassed by his magnificent attire.  Three of his wives accompanied him. They were almost as tall, and quite  as corpulent as himself; but by no means to be compared with him in  grandeur of habiliments, wearing no other garb than the pan. With him,  also, came his great favorite and confidential counseller, Kraimaker;  who, from holding a post equivalent to that of prime minister, had been  familiarly named Billy Pitt by the British visitors to the islands.    The sovereign was received with befitting ceremonial. The American  flag was displayed, four guns were fired, and the partners appeared  in scarlet coats, and conducted their illustrious guests to the cabin,  where they were regaled with wine. In this interview the partners  endeavored to impress the monarch with a sense of their importance, and  of the importance of the association to which they belonged. They let  him know that they were eris, or chiefs, of a great company about to  be established on the northwest coast, and talked of the probability  of opening a trade with his islands, and of sending ships there  occasionally. All this was gratifying and interesting to him, for he  was aware of the advantages of trade, and desirous of promoting frequent  intercourse with white men. He encouraged Europeans and Americans to  settle in his islands and intermarry with his subjects. There were  between twenty and thirty white men at that time resident in the island,  but many of them were mere vagabonds, who remained there in hopes  of leading a lazy and an easy life. For such Tamaahmaah had a great  contempt; those only had his esteem and countenance who knew some trade  or mechanic art, and were sober and industrious.    On the day subsequent to the monarch's visit, the partners landed and  waited upon him in return. Knowing the effect of show and dress upon men  in savage life, and wishing to make a favorable impression as the eris,  or chiefs, of the great American Fur Company, some of them appeared in  Highland plaids and kilts to the great admiration of the natives.    While visits of ceremony and grand diplomatic conferences were going  on between the partners and the king, the captain, in his plain,  matter-of-fact way, was pushing what he considered a far more important  negotiation; the purchase of a supply of hogs. He found that the king  had profited in more ways than one by his intercourse with white men.  Above all other arts he had learned the art of driving a bargain. He was  a magnanimous monarch, but a shrewd pork merchant; and perhaps thought  he could not do better with his future allies, the American Fur Company,  than to begin by close dealing. Several interviews were requisite, and  much bargaining, before he could be brought to part with a bristle of  his bacon, and then he insisted upon being paid in hard Spanish dollars;  giving as a reason that he wanted money to purchase a frigate from his  brother George, as he affectionately termed the king of England. *    At length the royal bargain was concluded; the necessary supply of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13711"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science - Volume 1, No. (#12)"],[1,"acrid  smoke escaped by holes in the roof. Ivan, his arms and legs bound, was  thrust into a separate compartment filled with furs, and formed by a  projection of the rock and the skin-boats which this primitive race  employed to cross the most stormy seas. He was almost stunned; he lay  for a while without thought or motion. Gradually he recovered, and  gazed around; all was night, save above, where by a narrow orifice  he saw the smoke which hung in clouds around the roof escaping.  He expected death. He knew the savage race he was among, who hated  interference with their hunting-grounds, and whose fish he and his  party had taken. What, therefore, was his surprise, when from the  summit of the roof, he heard a gentle voice whispering in soft accents  his own name. His ears must, he thought, deceive him. The hubbub close  at hand was terrible. A dispute was going on. Men, women. and children  all joined, and yet he had heard the word \"Ivan.\" \"Kolina,\" he  replied, in equally low but clear tones. As he spoke a knife rolled  near him. But he could not touch it. Then a dark form filled the  orifice about a dozen feet above his head, and something moved down  among projecting stones, and then Kolina stood by him. In an instant  Ivan was free, and an axe in his hand. The exit was before them. Steps  were cut in the rock, to ascend to the upper entrance, near which Ivan  had been placed without fear, because tied. But a rush was heard, and  the friends had only time to throw themselves deeper into the cave,  when four men rushed in, knife in hand, to immolate the victim. Such  had been the decision come to after the debate.    The lamps revealed the escape of the fugitive. A wild cry drew all the  men together, and then up they scampered along the rugged projections,  and the barking of the dogs as they fled showed that they were in hot  and eager chase. Ivan and Kolina lost no time. They advanced boldly,  knife and hatchet in hand, sprang amid the terrified women, darted  across their horrid cavern, and before one of them had recovered from  her fright, were in the open air. On they ran in the gloom for some  distance, when they suddenly heard muttering voices. Down they sank  behind the first large stone, concealing themselves as well as they  could in the snow. The party moved slowly on toward them.    \"I can trace their tracks still,\" said Sakalar, in a low deep tone.  \"On, while they are alive, or at least for vengeance!\"    \"Friends!\" cried Ivan.    \"Father!\" said Kolina, and in an instant the whole party were united.  Five words were enough to determine Sakalar. The whole body rushed  back, entered the cavern, and found themselves masters of it without  a struggle. The women and children attempted no resistance. As soon  as they were placed in a corner, under the guard of the Kolimsk men,  a council was held. Sakalar, as the most experienced, decided what  was to be done. He knew the value of threats: one of the women was  released, and bade go tell the men what had occurred. She was to add  the offer of a treaty of peace, to which, if both parties agreed,  the women were to be given up on the one side, and the hut and its  contents on the other. But the victors announced their intention  of taking four of the best-looking boys as hostages, to be returned  whenever they were convinced of the good faith of the Tchouktchas. The  envoy soon returned, agreeing to everything. They had not gone near  the hut, fearing an ambuscade. The four boys were at once selected,  and the belligerents separated.    Sakalar made the little fellows run before, and thus the hut was  regained. An inner cabin was erected for the prisoners, and the dogs  placed over them as spies. But as the boys understood Sakalar to mean  that the dogs were to eat them if they stirred, they remained still  enough, and made no attempt to run away.    A hasty meal was now cooked, and after its conclusion Ivan related  the events of the day, warmly dilating on the devotion and courage of  Kolina, who, with the keenness of a Yakouta, had found out his prison  by the smoke, and had seen him on the ground despite the gloom.  Sakalar then explained how, on his return, he had been terribly  alarmed, and had followed the trail on the snow. After mutual  congratulations the whole party went to sleep.    The next morning early, the mothers came humbly with provisions for  their children. They received some trifling presents and were sent  away in delight. About midday the whole tribe presented themselves  unarmed, within a short distance of the hut, and offered a traffic.  They brought a great quantity of fish, which they wanted to exchange  for tobacco. Sakalar, who spoke their language freely, first gave them  a roll, letting them understand it was in payment of the fish taken  without leave. This at once dissipated all feelings of hostility, and  solid peace was insured. So satisfied was Sakalar of their sincerity,  that he at once released the captives.    From that day the two parties were one, and all thoughts of war were  completely at an end. A vast deal of bloodshed had been prevented by a  few concessions on both sides. The same result might indeed have been  come to by killing half of each little tribe, but it is doubtful if  the peace would have been as satisfactory to the survivors.           *       *       *       *       *    VII.--THE SUMMER AND AUTUMN.    Occupied with the chase, with bartering, and with conversing with  their new friends, the summer gradually came around. The snow melted,  the hills became a series of cascades, in every direction water  poured toward the sea. But the hut remained solid and firm, a little  earth only being cast over the snow. Flocks of ducks and geese soon  appeared, a slight vegetation was visible, and the sea was in motion.  But what principally drew all eyes were the vast heaps of fossil ivory  exposed to view on the banks of the stream, laid bare more and more  every year by the torrents of spring. A few days sufficed to collect  a heap greater than they could take away on the sledges in a dozen  journeys. Ivan gazed at his treasure in mute despair. Were all that  at Yakoutsk, he was the richest merchant in Siberia; but to take it  thither seemed impossible. But in stepped the adventurous Tchouktchas.  They offered, for a stipulated sum in tobacco and other valuables, to  land a large portion of the ivory at a certain spot on the shores of  Siberia, by means of their boats. Ivan, though again surprised at the  daring of these wild men, accepted the proposal, and engaged to give  them his whole stock. The matter was then settled, and our adventurers  and their new friends dispersed to their summer avocations.    These consisted in fishing and hunting, and repairing boats and  sledges. Their canoes were made of skins and whalebone, and bits of  wood; but they were large, and capable of sustaining great weight.  They proposed to start as soon as the ice was broken up, and to brave  all the dangers of so fearful a navigation. They were used to impel  themselves along in every open space, and to take shelter on icebergs  from danger. When one of these icy mountains went in the right  direction, they stuck to it; but at others they paddled away, amid  dangers of which they seemed wholly unconscious.    A month was taken up in fishing, in drying the fish, or in putting  it in holes where there was eternal frost. An immense stock was laid  in: and then one morning the Tchouktchas took their departure, and  the adventurers remained alone. Their hut was broken up, and all made  ready for their second journey. The sledges were enlarged, to bear  the heaviest possible load at starting. A few days' overloading were  not minded, as the provisions would soon decrease. Still not half so  much could be taken as they wished, and yet Ivan had nearly a ton of  ivory, and thirty tons was the greatest produce of any one year in all  Siberia.    But the sledges were ready long before the sea was so. The interval  was spent in continued hunting, to prevent any consumption of the  traveling store. All were heartily tired, long before it was over,  of a day nearly as long as two English months. Soon the winter set in  with intense rigor; the sea ceased to toss and heave; the icebergs and  fields moved more and more slowly; at last ocean and land were blended  into one--the night of a month came, and the sun was seen no more.    The dogs were now roused up; the sledges harnessed; and the instant  the sea was firm enough to sustain them, the party started. Sakalar's  intention was to try forced marches in a straight line. Fortune  favored them. Not an accident occurred for days. At first they did not  move exactly in the same direction as when they came, but they soon  found traces of their previous journey, proving that a plain of ice  had been forced away at least fifty miles during the thaw.    The road was now again rugged and difficult, firing was getting  scarce, the dogs were devouring the fish with rapidity, and only one  half the ocean-journey was over. But on they pushed with desperate  energy, each eye once more keenly on the look-out for game. Every one  drove his team in sullen silence, for all were on short allowance, and  all were hungry. They sat on what was to them more valuable than gold,  and yet they had not what was necessary for subsistence. The dogs were  urged every day to the utmost limits of their strength. But so much  space had been taken up by the ivory, that at last there remained  neither food nor fuel. None knew at what distance they were from the  shore, and their position seemed desperate. There were even whispers  of killing some of the dogs; and Sakalar and Ivan were upbraided for  the avarice which had brought them to such straits.    \"See!\" said the old hunter suddenly, with a delighted smile, pointing  toward the south.    The whole party looked eagerly. A thick column of smoke rose"]]]
