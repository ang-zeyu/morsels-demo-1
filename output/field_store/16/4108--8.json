Gossypium. The cotton plant. On the river Derwent near  Matlock in Derbyshire, Sir RICHARD ARKWRIGHT has created his curious  and magnificent machinery for spinning cotton; which had been in vain  attempted by many ingenious artists before him. The cotton-wool is first  picked from the pods and seeds by women. It is then carded by _cylindrical  cards_, which move against each other, with different velocities. It is  taken from these by an _iron-hand_ or comb, which has a motion similar to  that of scratching, and takes the wool off the cards longitudinally in  respect to the fibres or staple, producing a continued line loosely  cohering, called the _Rove_ or _Roving_. This Rove, yet very loosely  twisted, is then received or drawn into a _whirling canister_, and is  rolled by the centrifugal force in spiral lines within it; being yet too  tender for the spindle. It is then passed between _two pairs of rollers_;  the second pair moving faster than the first elongate the thread with  greater equality than can be done by the hand; and is then twisted on  spoles or bobbins.    The great fertility of the Cotton-plant in these fine flexile threads,  whilst those from Flax, Hemp, and Nettles, or from the bark of the  Mulberry-tree, require a previous putrefection of the parenchymatous  substance, and much mechanical labour, and afterwards bleaching, renders  this plant of great importance to the world. And since Sir Richard  Arkwright's ingenious machine has not only greatly abbreviated and  simplefied the labour and art of carding and spinning the Cotton-wool,  but performs both these circumstances _better_ than can be done by hand,  it is probable, that the clothing of this small seed will become the  principal clothing of mankind; though animal wool and silk may be  preferable in colder climates, as they are more imperfect conductors of  heat, and are thence a warmer clothing.]      95    With wiry teeth _revolving cards_ release          The tanged knots, and smooth the ravell'd fleece;          Next moves the _iron-band_ with fingers fine,          Combs the wide card, and forms the eternal line;          Slow, with soft lips, the _whirling Can_ acquires  100  The tender skeins, and wraps in rising spires;          With quicken'd pace _successive rollers_ move,          And these retain, and those extend the _rove_;          Then fly the spoles, the rapid axles glow;--          And slowly circumvolves the labouring wheel below.    105  PAPYRA, throned upon the banks of Nile,          Spread her smooth leaf, and waved her silver style.

Mrs. Delany has finished nine hundred and  seventy accurate and elegant representations of different vegetables  with the parts of their flowers, fructification, &c. according with the  classification of Linneus, in what she terms paper-mosaic. She began this  work at the age of 74, when her sight would no longer serve her to paint,  in which she much excelled; between her age of 74 and 82, at which time  her eyes quite failed her, she executed the curious Hortus ficcus  above-mentioned, which I suppose contains a greater number of plants  than were ever before drawn from the life by any one person. Her method  consisted in placing the leaves of each plant with the petals, and all  the other parts of the flowers, on coloured paper, and cutting them with  scissars accurately to the natural size and form, and then parting them  on a dark ground; the effect of which is wonderful, and their accuracy  less liable to fallacy than drawings. She is at this time (1788) in her  89th year, with all the powers of a fine understanding still unimpaired.  I am informed another very ingenious lady, Mrs. North, is constructing a  similar Hortus ficcus, or Paper-garden; which she executes on a ground of  vellum with such elegant taste and scientific accuracy, that it cannot  fail to become a work of inestimable value.]              Her virgin train the tender scissars ply,          Vein the green leaf, the purple petal dye:          Round wiry stems the flaxen tendril bends,  160  Moss creeps below, and waxen fruit impends.

It may be seen in Sedges, in the Orange-tree, and in Black Alder  _(Ilex verticillata)_. In this arrangement, there are three ranks of  leaves, and each leaf diverges from the next at an angle of 120 deg., or  one-third of the circumference.    By far the commonest arrangement is with the leaves in five vertical  ranks. The Cherry, the Poplar, the Larch, the Oak, and many other trees  exhibit this. In this arrangement there are five leaves necessary to  complete the circle. We might expect, then, that each leaf would occupy  one-fifth of the circle. This would be the case were it not for the fact  that we have to pass twice around the stem in counting them, so that each  leaf has twice as much room, or two-fifths of the circle, to itself. This  is, therefore, the 2/5 arrangement. This can be shown by winding a thread  around the stem, passing it over each leaf-scar. In the Beech we make one  turn of the stem before reaching the third leaf which stands over the  first. In the Apple the thread will wind twice about the stem, before  coming to the sixth leaf, which is over the first.    Another arrangement, not very common, is found in the Magnolia, the Holly,  and the radical leaves of the common Plantain and Tobacco. The thread  makes three turns of the stem before reaching the eighth leaf which stands  over the first. This is the 3/8 arrangement. It is well seen in the  Marguerite, a greenhouse plant which is very easily grown in the house.    Look now at these fractions, 1/2, 1/3, 2/5, and 3/8. The numerator of  the third is the sum of the numerators of the first and second, its  denominator, the sum of the two denominators. The same is true of the  fourth fraction and the two immediately preceding it. Continuing the  series, we get the fractions 5/13, 8/21, 13/34. These arrangements can  be found in nature in cones, the scales of which are modified leaves and  follow the laws of leaf-arrangement.[1]    [Footnote 1: See the uses and origin of the arrangement of leaves in  plants. By Chauncey Wright. Memoirs Amer. Acad., IX, p. 389. This essay  is an abstruse mathematical treatise on the theory of phyllotaxy. The  fractions are treated as successive approximations to a theoretical angle,  which represents the best possible exposure to air and light.    Modern authors, however, do not generally accept this mathematical view of  leaf-arrangement.]    [1]\"It is to be noted that the distichous or 1/2 variety gives the maximum  divergence, namely 180 deg., and that the tristichous, or 1/3, gives the  least, or 120 deg.; that the pentastichous, or 2/5, is nearly the mean  between the first two; that of the 3/8, nearly the mean between the two  preceding, etc. The disadvantage of the two-ranked arrangement is that the  leaves are soon superposed and so overshadow each other. This is commonly  obviated by the length of the internodes, which is apt to be much greater  in this than in the more complex arrangements, therefore placing them  vertically further apart; or else, as in Elms, Beeches, and the like, the  branchlets take a horizontal position and the petioles a quarter twist,  which gives full exposure of the upper face of all the leaves to the  light. The 1/3 and 2/5, with diminished divergence, increase the number of  ranks; the 3/8 and all beyond, with mean divergence of successive leaves,  effect a more thorough distribution, but with less and less angular  distance between the vertical ranks.\"    [Footnote 1: Gray's Structural Botany, Chap, iv, p. 126.]    For directions for finding the arrangement of cones, see Gray's Structural  Botany, Chap. IV, Sect. 1.    The subject appears easy when stated in a text-book, but, practically, it  is often exceedingly difficult to determine the arrangement. Stems often  twist so as to alter entirely the apparent disposition of the leaves. The  general principle, however, that the leaves are disposed so as to get the  best exposure to air and light is clear. This cannot be shown by the study  of the naked branches merely, because these do not show the beautiful  result of the distribution.[1] Many house plants can be found, which will  afford excellent illustrations (Fig. 21). The Marguerite and Tobacco, both  easily grown in the house, are on the 3/8 plan. The latter shows the eight  ranks most plainly in the rosette of its lower leaves. The distribution is  often brought about by differences in the lengths of the petioles, as in  a Horsechestnut branch (Fig. 22) where the lower, larger leaves stand  out further from the branch than the upper ones; or by a twist in the  petioles, so that the upper faces of the leaves are turned up to the  light, as in Beech (Fig. 23). If it is springtime when the lessons are  given, endless adaptations can be found.    [Footnote 1: Reader in Botany. IX. Leaf-Arrangement.]    [Illustration: FIG. 21.

V.    STEMS.      The stem, as the scholars have already learned, is the axis of the plant.  The leaves are produced at certain definite points called nodes, and the  portions of stem between these points are internodes. The internode,  node, and leaf make a single plant-part, and the plant is made up of a  succession of such parts.    The stem, as well as the root and leaves, may bear plant-hairs. The  accepted theory of plant structure assumes that these four parts, root,  stem, leaves, and plant-hairs, are the only members of a flowering plant,  and that all other forms, as flowers, tendrils, etc., are modified from  these. While this idea is at the foundation of all our teaching, causing  us to lead the pupil to recognize as modified leaves the cotyledons of a  seedling and the scales of a bud, it is difficult to state it directly  so as to be understood, except by mature minds. I have been frequently  surprised at the failure of even bright and advanced pupils to grasp this  idea, and believe it is better to let them first imbibe it unconsciously  in their study. Whenever their minds are ready for it, it will be readily  understood. The chief difficulty is that they imagine that there is a  direct metamorphosis of a leaf to a petal or a stamen.    Briefly, the theory is this: the beginnings of leaf, petal, tendril, etc.,  are the same. At an early stage of their growth it is impossible to tell  what they are to become. They develop into the organ needed for the  particular work required of them to do. The organ, that under other  circumstances might develop into a leaf, is capable of developing into a  petal, a stamen, or a pistil, according to the requirements of the plant,  but no actual metamorphosis takes place. Sometimes, instead of developing  into the form we should normally find, the organ develops into another  form, as when a petal stands in the place of a stamen, or the pistil  reverts to a leafy branch. This will be more fully treated under flowers.  The study of the different forms in which an organ may appear is the study  of _morphology_.      1. _Forms of Stems_.--Stems may grow in many ways. Let the pupils compare  the habits of growth of the seedlings they have studied. The Sunflower and  Corn are _erect_. This is the most usual habit, as with our common trees.  The Morning Glory is _twining_, the stem itself twists about a support.  The Bean, Pea and Nasturtium are _climbing_. The stems are weak, and  are held up, in the first two by tendrils, in the last by the twining  leaf-stalks. The English Ivy, as we have seen, is also climbing, by means  of its aerial roots. The Red Clover is _ascending_, the branches rising  obliquely from the base. Some kinds of Clover, as the White Clover, are  _creeping_, that is, with prostrate branches rooting at the nodes and  forming new plants. Such rooting branches are called _stolons_, or when  the stem runs underground, _suckers_. The gardener imitates them in  the process called layering, that is, bending down an erect branch and  covering it with soil, causing it to strike root. When the connecting stem  is cut, a new plant is formed. Long and leafless stolons, like those of  the Strawberry are called _runners_. Stems creep below the ground as well  as above. Probably the pupil will think of some examples. The pretty  little Gold Thread is so named from the yellow running stems, which grow  beneath the ground and send up shoots, or suckers, which make new plants.  Many grasses propagate themselves in this way. Such stems are called  _rootstocks_. \"That these are really stems, and not roots, is evident  from the way in which they grow; from their consisting of a succession of  joints; and from the leaves which they bear on each node, in the form  of small scales, just like the lowest ones on the upright stem next the  ground. They also produce buds in the axils of these scales, showing the  scales to be leaves; whereas real roots bear neither leaves nor axillary  buds.\"[1] Rootstocks are often stored with nourishment. We have already  taken up this subject in the potato, but it is well to repeat the  distinction between stems and roots. A thick, short rootstock provided  with buds, like the potato, is called a _tuber_. Compare again the corm of  Crocus and the bulb of Onion to find the stem in each. In the former, it  makes the bulk of the whole; in the latter, it is a mere plate holding the  fleshy bases of the leaves.
