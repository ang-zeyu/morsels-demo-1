He is not only without example, he is without precept. No ideals  are set before him, no advice is given to him: the very existence of  anything in which ideals and advice are needful is ignored.    If in conditions like these we should expect a boy to grow up greedy,  we may be certain that he will grow up impure. At puberty there awakes  within him by far the strongest appetite that human nature can  experience--an appetite against which some of the noblest of mankind  have striven in vain. The appetite is given abnormal strength by the  artificial and stimulating conditions under which he lives. The act  which satisfies this appetite is also one of keen pleasure. He has  long been accustomed to caress his private parts, and the pleasure  with which he does this is greatly enhanced. He does not suspect that  indulgence is harmful. This pleasure, unlike that of eating, costs him  nothing, and is ever available. His powers of self-control are as yet  undeveloped. He can indulge himself without incurring the least  suspicion. He probably knows that most boys, of his age and above,  indulge themselves. The result is inevitable. He finds that sexual  thoughts are keenly pleasurable, and that they produce bodily  exaltation. He has much yet to learn on the subject of sex, and he  enjoys the quest. Wherever he turns he finds it now--in his Bible, in  animal life, in his classics, in the encyclopaedia, in his companions,  and in the newspaper. Day and night the subject is ever with him. It  is inevitable. And at this juncture comes along the theorist who is  aghast at our destroying the lad's \"innocence,\" and at our \"suggesting  evils to him which otherwise he would never have thought of.\" \"The  boy's innate modesty is quite a sufficient protection\"!    To me the wonderful thing is the earnestness with which a boy sets  about the task of cleansing his life when once he has been made to  realise the real character of the thoughts and acts with which he has  been playing. Boys, as I find them, rarely err in this matter, or in  any other, from moral perversity, but merely from ignorance and  thoughtlessness. Severe rebukes and punishments are rarely either just  or useful. The disposition which obliges the teacher to use them in  the last resort, and the rebellion against authority which is said to  follow puberty, arise almost invariably from injudicious training in  the home or at school. Boys who have received a fair home training,  and who find themselves in a healthy atmosphere at school, are almost  invariably delightful to deal with; and even those who have been less  fortunate in their early surroundings adapt themselves in most cases  to the standards which a healthy public opinion in the school demands.    It may be thought that the mere reticence of adults about reproduction  and the reproductive organs would impress the child's mind with the  idea that it is unclean to play with his private parts or to talk  about their functions with his companions. This is a psychological  error. For some years past adults have avoided any allusion to the  subject of excretion, and the child assumes that _public_ attention to  bodily needs and _public_ reference to these needs are alike  indelicate. He does not, however, conclude that excretion in private  is an indelicate act, nor does any sense of delicacy oblige him to  maintain, with regard to companions of his own sex and age, the  reticence which has become habitual to him in his relations with  adults. Why should the child think it \"dirty\" to fondle and excite his  private parts or to talk about them with his boy friends? The  knowledge which makes us feel as we do is as yet hidden from him.    The same thing is certainly true of conversation about the facts of  reproduction when those who converse are uncorrupted. Another element,  however, at once appears when these facts are divulged by a corrupt  boy, because his manner is irresistibly suggestive of uncleanness as  well as of secrecy. Similarly when self-abuse is fallen into  spontaneously by a boy who is otherwise clean, no sense of indecency  attaches itself to the act. When, however, it is taught by an unclean  boy, there is a feeling of defilement from the first. In boys under  the age of puberty this feeling may overpower the temptation; in boys  above that age it is, as a rule, totally inadequate as a safeguard.    Many people imagine that a boy who is impure must betray himself, and  that if no overt acts of indecency are observed the innocence of a  boy's mind may be safely inferred. Knowledge on these subjects has,  however, been almost invariably gained under conditions of the utmost  secrecy, and the behaviour of adults has effectively fostered the idea  of concealment. Hence we might expect that the secret would be  jealously guarded and that any overt act of impurity would be avoided  in the presence of adults with even greater circumspection than the  public performance of an excretory act. The habit of self-abuse,  moreover, is practised usually under the double cover of darkness and  the bed-clothes. The temptation occurs far less by day than by night,  and a boy who yields to it in the day invariably chooses a closet or  other private place in which he feels secure from detection.    To many people it is inconceivable that a lad can harbour impure  feelings and habits without obvious deterioration; but even if a  child's lapses into these things were associated with conscious guilt,  does our knowledge of human nature justify us in supposing that evil  in the heart is certain to betray itself in a visible degradation of  the outer life? If we believe the language of the devout, we must  admit that the most spiritual of men hide in their heart thoughts of  which they are heartily ashamed. It is not into the mouth of the  reprobate but into the mouth of her devoted members as they enter upon  their sacramental service that the Church puts the significant prayer,  \"Almighty God, unto whom all hearts be open, all desires known, and  from whom no secrets are hid; Cleanse the thoughts in our hearts by  the inspiration of thy Holy Spirit.\" Inconsistency in adults is far  too well recognised to need proof. In children it is even more  obvious, and for this reason that, looked at aright, it is the faculty  of maintaining the general health of the soul, spite of local morbid  conditions--a faculty which is strongest in the simpler and more  adaptable mind of the child.    Impurity as a disease has a long incubation period. When he contracts  the disease, its victim is often wholly unconscious of his danger;  and, both because the disease is an internal one and is slow in  development, it is a very long time before obvious symptoms appear.  Meanwhile a corruption may have set in which will ultimately ruin the  whole life.          CHAPTER IV.    RESULTS OF YOUTHFUL IMPURITY.      It is difficult to exaggerate the evils which result from the present  system under which boys grow to manhood without any adult guidance in  relation to the laws of sex.    It has already been stated that the immediate physical results of  self-abuse are small evils indeed compared with the corruption of mind  which comes from perverted sex ideas. They are, however, by no means  negligible; and are, in some cases, very serious. The great prevalence  of self-abuse among boys, combined with the inevitable uncertainty as  to the degree of a boy's freedom from, or indulgence in, this vice,  makes it very difficult to institute a reliable comparison between  those who are chaste and those who are unchaste. Greater significance  attaches, I think, to a comparison in individual cases of a boy's  condition during a period of indulgence in masturbation and his  condition after its total, or almost total, relinquishment. I have no  hesitation in saying that the difference in a boy's vitality and  spiritual tone after relinquishing this habit is very marked. The  case _D_ quoted in Chapter I. is, in this respect, typical.    In my pamphlet, _Private Knowledge for Boys_, I have quoted a striking  passage from Acton on the Reproductive Organs, in which he contrasts  the continent and the incontinent boy. But in the case of men like Dr.  Acton--specialists in the diseases of the male reproductive organs--it  must be remembered that it is mostly the abnormal and extreme cases  which come under their notice: a fact which is liable to affect their  whole estimate. The book can be recommended to adults who wish to see  the whole subject of sex diseases dealt with by a specialist who  writes with a high moral purpose.    My own estimate is given in the pamphlet already referred to. After  quoting Dr. Acton's opinion, I add:--    \"You will notice that Dr. Acton is here describing an extreme case. I  want to tell you what are the results in a case which is not extreme.  My difficulty is that these results are so various. The injury to the  nerves and brain which is caused by sexual excitement and by the loss  of semen leaves nothing in the body, mind or character uninjured. The  _extent_ of the injury varies greatly with the strength of a boy's  constitution and with the frequency of his sin. The _character_ of the  injury varies with the boy's own special weaknesses and tendencies. If  he is naturally shy and timid, it makes him shyer and more timid. If  he is stupid and lazy, it makes him more stupid and lazy. If he is  inclined to consumption or other disease, it destroys his power of  resisting such disease. In extreme cases only does it actually change  an able boy into a stupid one, an athletic boy into a weak one, and a  happy boy into a discontented one; but in all cases it _weakens_ every  power a boy possesses. Its most prominent results are these: loss of  will-power and self-reliance, shyness, nervousness and irritability,  failure of the reasoning powers and memory, laziness of body and mind,  a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1377"],[0,"The Talisman (#12)"],[1,"peril as the rider would gladly have exchanged for the  dangers of a general action. Glad he was when, at length, after this  wild race, he beheld the holy man who had led it standing in front of  a cavern, with a large torch in his hand, composed of a piece of wood  dipped in bitumen, which cast a broad and flickering light, and emitted  a strong sulphureous smell.    Undeterred by the stifling vapour, the knight threw himself from  his horse and entered the cavern, which afforded small appearance of  accommodation. The cell was divided into two parts, in the outward of  which were an altar of stone and a crucifix made of reeds: this served  the anchorite for his chapel. On one side of this outward cave the  Christian knight, though not without scruple, arising from religious  reverence to the objects around, fastened up his horse, and arranged him  for the night, in imitation of the Saracen, who gave him to understand  that such was the custom of the place. The hermit, meanwhile, was busied  putting his inner apartment in order to receive his guests, and there  they soon joined him. At the bottom of the outer cave, a small aperture,  closed with a door of rough plank, led into the sleeping apartment of  the hermit, which was more commodious. The floor had been brought to a  rough level by the labour of the inhabitant, and then strewed with white  sand, which he daily sprinkled with water from a small fountain which  bubbled out of the rock in one corner, affording in that stifling  climate, refreshment alike to the ear and the taste. Mattresses, wrought  of twisted flags, lay by the side of the cell; the sides, like the  floor, had been roughly brought to shape, and several herbs and flowers  were hung around them. Two waxen torches, which the hermit lighted,  gave a cheerful air to the place, which was rendered agreeable by its  fragrance and coolness.    There were implements of labour in one corner of the apartment, in  another was a niche for a rude statue of the Virgin. A table and two  chairs showed that they must be the handiwork of the anchorite, being  different in their form from Oriental accommodations. The former was  covered, not only with reeds and pulse, but also with dried flesh, which  Theodorick assiduously placed in such arrangement as should invite the  appetite of his guests. This appearance of courtesy, though mute, and  expressed by gestures only, seemed to Sir Kenneth something entirely  irreconcilable with his former wild and violent demeanour. The movements  of the hermit were now become composed, and apparently it was only a  sense of religious humiliation which prevented his features, emaciated  as they were by his austere mode of life, from being majestic and noble.  He trod his cell as one who seemed born to rule over men, but who had  abdicated his empire to become the servant of Heaven. Still, it must  be allowed that his gigantic size, the length of his unshaven locks and  beard, and the fire of a deep-set and wild eye were rather attributes of  a soldier than of a recluse.    Even the Saracen seemed to regard the anchorite with some veneration,  while he was thus employed, and he whispered in a low tone to Sir  Kenneth, \"The Hamako is now in his better mind, but he will not speak  until we have eaten--such is his vow.\"    It was in silence, accordingly, that Theodorick motioned to the Scot to  take his place on one of the low chairs, while Sheerkohf placed himself,  after the custom of his nation, upon a cushion of mats. The hermit then  held up both hands, as if blessing the refreshment which he had placed  before his guests, and they proceeded to eat in silence as profound  as his own. To the Saracen this gravity was natural; and the Christian  imitated his taciturnity, while he employed his thoughts on the  singularity of his own situation, and the contrast betwixt the wild,  furious gesticulations, loud cries, and fierce actions of Theodorick,  when they first met him, and the demure, solemn, decorous assiduity with  which he now performed the duties of hospitality.    When their meal was ended, the hermit, who had not himself eaten a  morsel, removed the fragments from the table, and placing before the  Saracen a pitcher of sherbet, assigned to the Scot a flask of wine.    \"Drink,\" he said, \"my children\"--they were the first words he had  spoken--\"the gifts of God are to be enjoyed, when the Giver is  remembered.\"    Having said this, he retired to the outward cell, probably for  performance of his devotions, and left his guests together in the inner  apartment; when Sir Kenneth endeavoured, by various questions, to  draw from Sheerkohf what that Emir knew concerning his host. He was  interested by more than mere curiosity in these inquiries. Difficult as  it was to reconcile the outrageous demeanour of the recluse at his first  appearance with his present humble and placid behaviour, it seemed yet  more impossible to think it consistent with the high consideration in  which, according to what Sir Kenneth had learned, this hermit was held  by the most enlightened divines of the Christian world. Theodorick, the  hermit of Engaddi, had, in that character, been the correspondent of  popes and councils; to whom his letters, full of eloquent fervour,  had described the miseries imposed by the unbelievers upon the Latin  Christians in the Holy Land, in colours scarce inferior to those  employed at the Council of Clermont by the Hermit Peter, when he  preached the first Crusade. To find, in a person so reverend and so  much revered, the frantic gestures of a mad fakir, induced the Christian  knight to pause ere he could resolve to communicate to him certain  important matters, which he had in charge from some of the leaders of  the Crusade.    It had been a main object of Sir Kenneth's pilgrimage, attempted by  a route so unusual, to make such communications; but what he had that  night seen induced him to pause and reflect ere he proceeded to the  execution of his commission. From the Emir he could not extract much  information, but the general tenor was as follows:--That, as he had  heard, the hermit had been once a brave and valiant soldier, wise in  council and fortunate in battle, which last he could easily believe from  the great strength and agility which he had often seen him display; that  he had appeared at Jerusalem in the character not of a pilgrim, but in  that of one who had devoted himself to dwell for the remainder of his  life in the Holy Land. Shortly afterwards, he fixed his residence amid  the scenes of desolation where they now found him, respected by the  Latins for his austere devotion, and by the Turks and Arabs on account  of the symptoms of insanity which he displayed, and which they ascribed  to inspiration. It was from them he had the name of Hamako, which  expresses such a character in the Turkish language. Sheerkohf himself  seemed at a loss how to rank their host. He had been, he said, a wise  man, and could often for many hours together speak lessons of virtue or  wisdom, without the slightest appearance of inaccuracy. At other  times he was wild and violent, but never before had he seen him so  mischievously disposed as he had that day appeared to be. His rage was  chiefly provoked by any affront to his religion; and there was a story  of some wandering Arabs, who had insulted his worship and defaced his  altar, and whom he had on that account attacked and slain with the  short flail which he carried with him in lieu of all other weapons.  This incident had made a great noise, and it was as much the fear of the  hermit's iron flail as regard for his character as a Hamako which caused  the roving tribes to respect his dwelling and his chapel. His fame had  spread so far that Saladin had issued particular orders that he should  be spared and protected. He himself, and other Moslem lords of rank, had  visited the cell more than once, partly from curiosity, partly that they  expected from a man so learned as the Christian Hamako some insight into  the secrets of futurity. \"He had,\" continued the Saracen, \"a rashid, or  observatory, of great height, contrived to view the heavenly bodies, and  particularly the planetary system--by whose movements and influences,  as both Christian and Moslem believed, the course of human events was  regulated, and might be predicted.\"    This was the substance of the Emir Sheerkohf's information, and it left  Sir Kenneth in doubt whether the character of insanity arose from the  occasional excessive fervour of the hermit's zeal, or whether it was not  altogether fictitious, and assumed for the sake of the immunities  which it afforded. Yet it seemed that the infidels had carried their  complaisance towards him to an uncommon length, considering the  fanaticism of the followers of Mohammed, in the midst of whom he was  living, though the professed enemy of their faith. He thought also there  was more intimacy of acquaintance betwixt the hermit and the Saracen  than the words of the latter had induced him to anticipate; and it  had not escaped him that the former had called the latter by a  name different from that which he himself had assumed. All these  considerations authorized caution, if not suspicion. He determined to  observe his host closely, and not to be over-hasty in communicating with  him on the important charge entrusted to him.    \"Beware, Saracen,\" he said; \"methinks our host's imagination wanders  as well on the subject of names as upon other matters. Thy name is  Sheerkohf, and he called thee but now by another.\"    \"My name, when in the tent of my father,\" replied the Kurdman, \"was  Ilderim, and by this I am still distinguished by many. In the field, and  to soldiers, I am known as the Lion of the Mountain, being the name my  good sword hath won for me. But hush, the Hamako comes--it is to warn us  to rest. I know his custom; none must watch him at his vigils.\"    The anchorite accordingly"]]]
