[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10556"],[0,"The Old Man in the Corner (#12)"],[1," matter out--perhaps in this case it was as well.\"    He had gone and left Miss Polly Burton still staring at the photograph  of a pretty, gentle-looking woman, with a decided, wilful curve round  the mouth, and a strange, unaccountable look in the large pathetic eyes;  and the little journalist felt quite thankful that in this case the  murder of Charles Lavender the bookmaker--cowardly, wicked as it  was--had remained a mystery to the police and the public.          CHAPTER X    THE MYSTERIOUS DEATH ON THE UNDERGROUND RAILWAY      It was all very well for Mr. Richard Frobisher (of the _London Mail_) to  cut up rough about it. Polly did not altogether blame him.    She liked him all the better for that frank outburst of manlike  ill-temper which, after all said and done, was only a very flattering  form of masculine jealousy.    Moreover, Polly distinctly felt guilty about the whole thing. She had  promised to meet Dickie--that is Mr. Richard Frobisher--at two o'clock  sharp outside the Palace Theatre, because she wanted to go to a Maud  Allan _matinee_, and because he naturally wished to go with her.    But at two o'clock sharp she was still in Norfolk Street, Strand, inside  an A.B.C. shop, sipping cold coffee opposite a grotesque old man who was  fiddling with a bit of string.    How could she be expected to remember Maud Allan or the Palace Theatre,  or Dickie himself for a matter of that? The man in the corner had begun  to talk of that mysterious death on the underground railway, and Polly  had lost count of time, of place, and circumstance.    She had gone to lunch quite early, for she was looking forward to the  _matinee_ at the Palace.    The old scarecrow was sitting in his accustomed place when she came into  the A.B.C. shop, but he had made no remark all the time that the young  girl was munching her scone and butter. She was just busy thinking how  rude he was not even to have said \"Good morning,\" when an abrupt remark  from him caused her to look up.    \"Will you be good enough,\" he said suddenly, \"to give me a description  of the man who sat next to you just now, while you were having your cup  of coffee and scone.\"    Involuntarily Polly turned her head towards the distant door, through  which a man in a light overcoat was even now quickly passing. That man  had certainly sat at the next table to hers, when she first sat down to  her coffee and scone: he had finished his luncheon--whatever it  was--moment ago, had paid at the desk and gone out. The incident did not  appear to Polly as being of the slightest consequence.    Therefore she did not reply to the rude old man, but shrugged her  shoulders, and called to the waitress to bring her bill.    \"Do you know if he was tall or short, dark or fair?\" continued the man  in the corner, seemingly not the least disconcerted by the young girl's  indifference. \"Can you tell me at all what he was like?\"    \"Of course I can,\" rejoined Polly impatiently, \"but I don't see that my  description of one of the customers of an A.B.C. shop can have the  slightest importance.\"    He was silent for a minute, while his nervous fingers fumbled about in  his capacious pockets in search of the inevitable piece of string. When  he had found this necessary \"adjunct to thought,\" he viewed the young  girl again through his half-closed lids, and added maliciously:    \"But supposing it were of paramount importance that you should give an  accurate description of a man who sat next to you for half an hour  to-day, how would you proceed?\"    \"I should say that he was of medium height--\"    \"Five foot eight, nine, or ten?\" he interrupted quietly.    \"How can one tell to an inch or two?\" rejoined Polly crossly. \"He was  between colours.\"    \"What's that?\" he inquired blandly.    \"Neither fair nor dark--his nose--\"    \"Well, what was his nose like? Will you sketch it?\"    \"I am not an artist. His nose was fairly straight--his eyes--\"    \"Were neither dark nor light--his hair had the same striking  peculiarity--he was neither short nor tall--his nose was neither  aquiline nor snub--\" he recapitulated sarcastically.    \"No,\" she retorted; \"he was just ordinary looking.\"    \"Would you know him again--say to-morrow, and among a number of other  men who were 'neither tall nor short, dark nor fair, aquiline nor  snub-nosed,' etc.?\"    \"I don't know--I might--he was certainly not striking enough to be  specially remembered.\"    \"Exactly,\" he said, while he leant forward excitedly, for all the world  like a Jack-in-the-box let loose. \"Precisely; and you are a  journalist--call yourself one, at least--and it should be part of your  business to notice and describe people. I don't mean only the wonderful  personage with the clear Saxon features, the fine blue eyes, the noble  brow and classic face, but the ordinary person--the person who  represents ninety out of every hundred of his own kind--the average  Englishman, say, of the middle classes, who is neither very tall nor  very short, who wears a moustache which is neither fair nor dark, but  which masks his mouth, and a top hat which hides the shape of his head  and brow, a man, in fact, who dresses like hundreds of his  fellow-creatures, moves like them, speaks like them, has no peculiarity.    \"Try to describe _him_, to recognize him, say a week hence, among his  other eighty-nine doubles; worse still, to swear his life away, if he  happened to be implicated in some crime, wherein _your_ recognition of  him would place the halter round his neck.    \"Try that, I say, and having utterly failed you will more readily  understand how one of the greatest scoundrels unhung is still at large,  and why the mystery on the Underground Railway was never cleared up.    \"I think it was the only time in my life that I was seriously tempted to  give the police the benefit of my own views upon the matter. You see,  though I admire the brute for his cleverness, I did not see that his  being unpunished could possibly benefit any one.    \"In these days of tubes and motor traction of all kinds, the  old-fashioned 'best, cheapest, and quickest route to City and West End'  is often deserted, and the good old Metropolitan Railway carriages  cannot at any time be said to be overcrowded. Anyway, when that  particular train steamed into Aldgate at about 4 p.m. on March 18th  last, the first-class carriages were all but empty.    \"The guard marched up and down the platform looking into all the  carriages to see if anyone had left a halfpenny evening paper behind for  him, and opening the door of one of the first-class compartments, he  noticed a lady sitting in the further corner, with her head turned away  towards the window, evidently oblivious of the fact that on this line  Aldgate is the terminal station.    \"'Where are you for, lady?' he said.    \"The lady did not move, and the guard stepped into the carriage,  thinking that perhaps the lady was asleep. He touched her arm lightly  and looked into her face. In his own poetic language, he was 'struck all  of a 'eap.' In the glassy eyes, the ashen colour of the cheeks, the  rigidity of the head, there was the unmistakable look of death.    \"Hastily the guard, having carefully locked the carriage door, summoned  a couple of porters, and sent one of them off to the police-station, and  the other in search of the station-master.    \"Fortunately at this time of day the up platform is not very crowded,  all the traffic tending westward in the afternoon. It was only when an  inspector and two police constables, accompanied by a detective in plain  clothes and a medical officer, appeared upon the scene, and stood round  a first-class railway compartment, that a few idlers realized that  something unusual had occurred, and crowded round, eager and curious.    \"Thus it was that the later editions of the evening papers, under the  sensational heading, 'Mysterious Suicide on the Underground Railway,'  had already an account of the extraordinary event. The medical officer  had very soon come to the decision that the guard had not been mistaken,  and that life was indeed extinct.    \"The lady was young, and must have been very pretty before the look of  fright and horror had so terribly distorted her features. She was very  elegantly dressed, and the more frivolous papers were able to give their  feminine readers a detailed account of the unfortunate woman's gown, her  shoes, hat, and gloves.    \"It appears that one of the latter, the one on the right hand, was  partly off, leaving the thumb and wrist bare. That hand held a small  satchel, which the police opened, with a view to the possible  identification of the deceased, but which was found to contain only a  little loose silver, some smelling-salts, and a small empty bottle,  which was handed over to the medical officer for purposes of analysis.    \"It was the presence of that small bottle which had caused the report to  circulate freely that the mysterious case on the Underground Railway was  one of suicide. Certain it was that neither about the lady's person, nor  in the appearance of the railway carriage, was there the slightest sign  of struggle or even of resistance. Only the look in the poor woman's  eyes spoke of sudden terror, of the rapid vision of an unexpected and  violent death, which probably only lasted an infinitesimal fraction of a  second, but which had left its indelible mark upon the face, otherwise  so placid and so still.\"    \"The body of the deceased was conveyed to the mortuary. So far, of  course, not a soul had been able to identify her, or to throw the  slightest light upon the mystery which hung around her death.    \"Against that, quite a crowd of idlers--genuinely interested or  not--obtained admission to view the body, on the pretext of having lost  or mislaid a relative or a friend. At about 8.30 p.m. a young man, very  well dressed, drove up to the station in a hansom, and sent in his card  to the superintendent. It was Mr. Hazeldene, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10574"],[0,"The History of England, Volume I (#12)"],[1,"kingdom, and for utterly  extirpating idolatry, which, notwithstanding the prevalence of  Christianity, had hitherto been tolerated by the two preceding  monarchs.  He reigned twenty-four years, and left the crown to Egbert,  his son, who reigned nine years.  This prince is renowned for his  encouragement of learning, but infamous for putting to death his two  cousin germans, sons of Erminfred, his uncle.  The ecclesiastical  writers praise him for bestowing on his sister, Domnona, some lands in  the Isle of Thanet, where she founded a monastery.    The bloody precaution of Egbert could not fix the crown on the head of  his son, Edric.  Lothaire, brother  of the deceased prince, took  possession of the kingdom, and, in order to secure the power in his  family, he associated with him Richard, his son, in the administration  of the government.  Edric, the dispossessed prince, had recourse to  Edilwach, King of Sussex, for assistance, and being supported by that  prince, fought a battle with his uncle, who was defeated and slain.  Richard fled into Germany, and afterwards died in Lucca, a city of  Tuscany.  William of Malmesbury ascribes Lothaire's bad fortune to two  crimes; his concurrence in the murder of his cousins, and his contempt  for relics [g].  [FN [g] Will. Malm. p. 11.]    Lothaire reigned eleven years; Edric, his successor, only two.  Upon  the death of the latter, which happened in 686, Widred, his brother,  obtained possession of the crown.  But as the succession had been of  late so much disjointed by revolutions and usurpations, faction began  to prevail among the nobility, which invited Ceodwalla, King of  Wessex, with his brother, Mollo, to attack the kingdom.  These  invaders committed great devastations in Kent; but the death of Mollo,  who was slain in a skirmish [h], gave a short breathing-time to that  kingdom.  Widred restored the affairs of Kent, and, after a reign of  thirty-two years [i], left the crown to his posterity.  Eadbert,  Ethelbert, and Alric, his descendants, successively mounted the  throne.  After the death of the last, which happened in 794, the royal  family of Kent was extinguished, and every factious leader who could  entertain hopes of ascending the throne, threw the state into  confusion [k].  Egbert, who first succeeded, reigned but two years;  Cuthred, brother to the King of Mercia, six years; Baldred, an  illegitimate branch of the royal family, eighteen; and, after a  troublesome and precarious reign, he was, in the year 827, expelled by  Egbert, King of Wessex, who dissolved the Saxon Heptarchy, and united  the several kingdoms under his dominion.  [FN [h] Higden, lib. 5.  [i] Chron. Sax. p. 52  [k] Will. Malmes. lib.  1. cap. 1. p. 11.]    [MN The kingdom of Northumberland.]  Adelfrid, King of Bernicia, having married Acca, the daughter of  Aella, King of Deiri, and expelled her infant brother, Edwin, had  united all the countries north of Humber into one monarchy, and  acquired a great ascendant in the Heptarchy.  He also spread the  terror of the Saxon arms to the neighbouring people, and by his  victories over the Scots and Picts, as well as Welsh, extended on all  sides the bounds of his dominions.  Having laid siege to Chester, the  Britons marched out with all their forces to engage him, and they were  attended by a body of 1250 monks from the monastery of Bangor, who  stood at a small distance from the field of battle, in order to  encourage the combatants by their presence and exhortations.  Adelfrid, inquiring the purpose of this unusual appearance, was told,  that these priests had come to pray against him: THEN ARE THEY AS MUCH  OUR ENEMIES, said he, AS THOSE WHO INTEND TO FIGHT AGAINST US [l]: and  he immediately sent a detachment, who fell upon them, and did such  execution, that only fifty escaped with their lives [m].  The Britons,  astonished at this event, received a total defeat; Chester was obliged  to surrender; and Adelfrid, pursuing his victory, made himself master  of Bangor, and entirely demolished the monastery, a building so  extensive that there was a mile's distance from one gate of it to  another, and it contained two thousand one hundred monks, who are said  to have been there maintained by their own labour [n].  [FN [l] Brompton, p. 779.  [m] Trivet, apud Spell. Conc. p. 111.  [n]  Bede, lib. 2. cap. 2.  W. Malmes. lib. 1. cap. 3.]    Notwithstanding Adelfrid's success in war, he lived in inquietude on  account of young Edwin, whom he had unjustly dispossessed of the crown  of Deiri.  This prince, now grown to man's estate, wandered from place  to place in continual danger from the attempts of Adelfrid, and  received at last protection in the court of Redwald, King of the East  Angles, where his engaging and gallant deportment procured him general  esteem and affection.  Redwald, however, was strongly solicited by the  King of Northumberland to kill or deliver up his guest; rich presents  were promised him if he would comply, and war denounced against him in  case of his refusal.  After rejecting several messages of this kind,  his generosity began to yield to the motives of interest; and he  retained the last ambassador till he should come to a resolution in a  case of such importance.  Edwin, informed of his friend's perplexity,  was yet determined at all hazards to remain in East Anglia, and  thought that if the protection of that  court failed him, it were  better to die, than prolong a life so much exposed to the persecutions  of his powerful rival.  This confidence in Redwald's honour and  friendship, with his other accomplishments, engaged the queen on his  side, and she effectually represented to her husband the infamy of  delivering up to certain destruction their royal guest, who had fled  to them for protection against his cruel and jealous enemies [o].  Redwald, embracing more generous resolutions, thought it safest to  prevent Adelfrid, before that prince was aware of his intention, and  to attack him while he was yet unprepared for defence.  He marched  suddenly with an army into the kingdom of Northumberland, and fought a  battle with Adelfrid, in which that monarch was defeated and killed,  after avenging himself by the death of Regner, son of Redwald [p]: his  own sons, Eanfrid, Oswald, and Oswy, yet infants, were carried into  Scotland, and Edwin obtained possession of the crown of  Northumberland.  [FN [o] W.. Malmes. lib. 1. cap. 3.  H. Hunting. lib. 3  Bede  [p]  Bede, lib. 2. cap. 12.  Brompton, p. 781.]    Edwin was the greatest prince of the Heptarchy in that age, and  distinguished himself, both by his influence over the other kingdoms  [q], and by the strict execution of justice in his own dominions.  He  reclaimed his subjects from the licentious life to which they had been  accustomed; and it was a common saying, that during his reign a woman  or child might openly carry every where a purse of gold, without any  danger of violence or robbery.  There is a remarkable instance,  transmitted to us, of the affection borne him by his servants.  Cuichelme, King of Wessex, was his enemy, but finding himself unable  to maintain open war against so gallant and powerful a prince, he  determined to use treachery against him, and he employed one Eumer for  that criminal purpose.  The assassin, having obtained admittance by  pretending to deliver a message from Cuichelme, drew his dagger and  rushed upon the king.  Lilla, an officer of his army, seeing his  master's danger, and having no other means of defence, interposed with  his own body between the king and Eumer's dagger, which was pushed  with such violence, that after piercing Lilla, it even wounded Edwin;  but before the assassin  could renew his blow, he was despatched by  the king's attendants.  [FN [q] Chron. Sax. p. 27.]    The East Angles conspired against Redwald, their king, and having put  him to death, they offered their crown to Edwin, of whose valour and  capacity they had had experience, while he resided among them.  But  Edwin, from a sense of gratitude towards his benefactor, obliged them  to submit to Earpwold, the son of Redwald; and that prince preserved  his authority, though on a precarious footing, under the protection of  the Northumbrian monarch [r].  [FN [r] Gul. Malmes. lib. 1. cap. 3.]    Edwin, after his accession to the crown, married Ethelburga, the  daughter of Ethelbert, King of Kent.  This princess, emulating the  glory of her mother, Bertha, who had been the instrument for  converting her husband and his people to Christianity, carried  Paullinus, a learned bishop, along with her [s]; and besides  stipulating a toleration for the exercise of her own religion, which  was readily granted her, she used every reason to persuade the king to  embrace it.  Edwin, like a prudent prince, hesitated on the proposal,  but promised to examine the foundations of that doctrine, and declared  that, if he found them satisfactory, he was willing to be converted  [t].  Accordingly, he held several conferences with Paullinus;  canvassed the arguments propounded with the wisest of his counsellors;  retired frequently from company, in order to revolve alone that  important question; and after a serious and long inquiry, declared in  favour of the Christian religion [u]: the people soon after imitated  his example.  Besides the authority and influence of the king, they  were moved by another striking example.  Coifi, the high priest, being  converted after a public conference with Paullinus, led the way in  destroying the images which he had so long worshipped, and was forward  in making this atonement for his past idolatry [w].  [FN [s] H. Hunting. lib. 3.  [t] Bede, lib. 2. cap. 9.  [u] Ibid.  W.  Malmes. lib 1. cap. 3.  [w] Bede, lib. 2. cap. 13.  Brompton, Higden,  lib. 5.]    This able prince perished with his son, Osfrid, in a great battle  which he fought against Penda, King of Mercia, and Caedwalla, King of  the Britons [x].
