V      ON PROPOSED REFORMS    (HOUSE OF LORDS. DECEMBER 17, 1908)    I feel that I owe a very sincere apology to the House for the  disturbance in the business arrangements of the House, of which I have  been the cause, though the innocent cause. It has been said that in  the delays in bringing forward this subject, I have been anxious to  burke discussion. That is not in the least true. The reasons that made  it seem desirable to me that the discussion on this most important and  far-reaching range of topics should be postponed, were--I believe the  House will agree with me--reasons of common sense. In the first place,  discussion without anybody having seen the Papers to be discussed,  would evidently have been ineffective. In the second place it would  have been impossible to discuss those Papers with good effect--the  Papers that I am going this afternoon to present to Parliament--until  we know, at all events in some degree, what their reception has been  in the country most immediately concerned. And then thirdly, my  Lords, I cannot but apprehend that discussion here--I mean in  Parliament--would be calculated to prejudice the reception in India  of the proposals that His Majesty's Government, in concert with the  Government of India, are now making. My Lords, I submit those are  three very essential reasons why discussion in my view, and I hope  in the view of this House, was to be deprecated. This afternoon your  Lordships will be presented with a very modest Blue-book of 100 or 150  pages, but I should like to promise noble Lords that to-morrow morning  there will be ready for them a series of Papers on the same subject,  of a size so enormous that the most voracious or even carnivorous  appetite for Blue-books will have ample food for augmenting the joys  of the Christmas holidays.    The observations that I shall ask your Lordships to allow me to make,  are the opening of a very important chapter in the history of the  relations of Great Britain and India; and I shall ask the indulgence  of the House if I take a little time, not so much in dissecting the  contents of the Papers, which the House will be able to do for itself  by and by, as in indicating the general spirit that animates His  Majesty's Government here, and my noble friend the Governor-General,  in making the proposals that I shall in a moment describe. I suppose,  like other Secretaries of State for India, I found my first, idea  was to have what they used to have in the old days--a Parliamentary  Committee to inquire into Indian Government. I see that a predecessor  of mine in the India Office, Lord Randolph Churchill--he was there for  too short a time--in 1885 had very strongly conceived that idea. On  the whole I think there is a great deal at the present day to be said  against it.    Therefore what we have done was in concert with the Government of  India, first to open a chapter of constitutional reform, of which I  will speak in a moment, and next to appoint a Royal Commission to  inquire into the internal relations between the  Government of India and all its subordinate and co-ordinate parts.  That Commission will report, I believe, in February or March  next,--February, I hope,--and that again will involve the Government  of India and the India Office in Whitehall in pretty laborious and  careful inquiries. It cannot be expected--and it ought not to be  expected--that an Act passed as the organic Act of 1858 was passed,  amidst intense excitement and most disturbing circumstances, should  have been in existence for half a century without disclosing flaws  and imperfections, or that its operations would not be the better for  supervision, or incapable of improvement.    I spoke of delay in these observations, and unfortunately delay has  not made the skies any brighter. But, my Lords, do not let us make  the Indian sky cloudier than it really is. Do not let us consider the  clouds to be darker than they really are. Let me invite your Lordships  to look at the formidable difficulties that now encumber us in India,  with a due sense of proportion.    What is the state of things as it appears to persons of authority and  of ample knowledge in India? One very important and well-known friend  of mine in India says this--    \"The anarchists are few, but, on the other hand, they are apparently  prepared to go any length and to run any risk. It must also be borne  in mind that the ordinary man or lad in India has not too much  courage, and that the loyal are terrorised by the ruthless  extremists.\"    It is a curious incident that on the very day before the attempt to  assassinate Sir Andrew Fraser was made, he had a reception in the  college where the would-be assassin was educated, and his reception  was of the most enthusiastic and spontaneous kind. I only mention  that, to show the curious and subtle atmosphere in which things now  are at Calcutta. I will not dwell on that, because although I have a  mass of material, this is not the occasion for developing it. I will  only add this from a correspondent of great authority--    \"There is no fear of anything in the nature of a rising, but if  murders continue, a general panic may arise and greatly increase  the danger of the situation. We cannot hope that any machinery will  completely stop outrages at once. We must be prepared to meet them.  There are growing indications that the native population itself is  alarmed, and that we shall have the strong support of native public  opinion.\"    The view of important persons in the Government of India is that in  substance the position of our Government in India is as sound and as  well-founded as it has ever been.    I shall be asked, has not the Government of India been obliged to pass  a measure introducing pretty drastic machinery? That is quite  true, and I, for one, have no fault whatever to find with them for  introducing such machinery and for taking that step. On the contrary,  my Lords, I wholly approve, and I share, of course, to the full the  responsibility for it. I understand that I am exposed to some obloquy  on this account--I am charged with inconsistency. That is a matter  on which I am very well able to take care of myself, and I should be  ashamed to detain your Lordships for one single moment in arguing  about it. Quite early after my coming to the India Office, pressure  was put on me to repeal the Regulation of 1818, under which men are  now being summarily detained without trial and without charge,  and without intention to try or to charge. That, of course, is a  tremendous power to place in the hands of an Executive Government. But  I said to myself then, and I say now, that I decline to take out of  the hands of the Government of India any weapon that they have got, in  circumstances so formidable, so obscure, and so impenetrable as are  the circumstances that surround British Government in India.    There are two paths of folly in these matters. One is to regard all  Indian matters, Indian procedure and Indian policy, as if it were  Great Britain or Ireland, and to insist that all the robes and apparel  that suit Great Britain or Ireland must necessarily suit India. The  other is to think that all you have got to do is what I see suggested,  to my amazement, in English print--to blow a certain number of men  from guns, and then your business will be done. Either of these paths  of folly leads to as great disaster as the other. I would like to  say this about the Summary Jurisdiction Bill--I have no illusions  whatever. I do not ignore, and I do not believe that Lord Lansdowne  opposite, or anyone else can ignore, the frightful risks involved in  transferring in any form or degree what should be the ordinary power  under the law, to arbitrary personal discretion. I am alive, too, to  the temptation under summary procedure of various kinds, to the danger  of mistaking a headstrong exercise of force for energy. Again, I do  not for an instant forget, and I hope those who so loudly applaud  legislation of this kind do not forget, the tremendous price that you  pay for all operations of this sort in the reaction and the excitement  that they provoke. If there is a man who knows all these drawbacks  I think I am he. But there are situations in which a responsible  Government is compelled to run these risks and to pay this possible  price, however high it may appear to be.    It is like war, a hateful thing, from which, however, some of the most  ardent lovers of peace, and some of those rulers of the world whose  names the most ardent lovers of peace most honour and revere--it is  one of the things from which these men have not shrunk. The only  question for us is whether there is such a situation in India to-day  as to warrant the passing of the Act the other day, and to justify  resort to the Regulation of 1818. I cannot imagine anybody reading the  speeches--especially the unexaggerated remarks of the Viceroy--and the  list of crimes perpetrated, and attempted, that were read out last  Friday in Calcutta--I cannot imagine that anybody reading that list  and thinking what they stand for, would doubt for a single moment that  summary procedure of some kind or another was justified and called  for. I discern a tendency to criticise this legislation on grounds  that strike me as extraordinary. After all, it is not our fault that  we have had to bring in this measure. You must protect the lives of  your officers. You must protect peaceful and harmless people, both  Indian and European, from the blood-stained havoc of anarchic  conspiracy. We deplore the necessity, but we are bound to face the  facts. I myself recognise this necessity with infinite regret, and  with something, perhaps, rather deeper than regret. But it is not  the Government, either here or in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10985"],[0,"The Infant System (#12)"],[1,"ornings.[A] Set these  specious benefits against the dreadful results to men's health and  pockets, from the present low price of spirits, and their consequent  enormous consumption; and then let common sense and honesty deliver  its judgment.    I have spoken thus candidly and at length upon the subject in the  present chapter, though somewhat out of place, because my feelings  would not allow me to be less plain or more brief, or to postpone  the matter to \"a more convenient season.\" Perhaps in talking of  legislative alterations I have been wandering upon forbidden ground;  if so, in returning to my proper path, I will comfort myself with this  thought:--the progress of improvement, however slow, is sure, and it  is certainly advancing in this country; I require no other assurance  than the establishment of Infant Schools and Mechanic's.    [Footnote A: Some conception of the fearful height which drunkenness  has attained, may be gathered from the fact, that in 1829, the  quantity of distilled spirits on which the duty was paid in the three  kingdoms, amounted to 23,000,000 of gallons. To form a due estimate,  however, of the actual consumption, an immense quantity must be added,  obtained by smuggling. Of the rum imported for home consumption,  allowing for that re-exported, the quantity was 5,000,000 of gallons.  Of brandy and other articles imported, 1,500,000 gallons; making a  total, with the omission of all on which the duty was evaded, of  30,000,000 of gallons of ardent spirits consumed in the year.  Five millions of revenue grew out of this, but it cost the people  15,000,000_l_. sterling, a which would have paid half-a-year's  interest of the national debt.]    \"No person,\" says Sir Astley Cooper \"has greater hostility to dram  drinking than myself, insomuch that I never suffer any ardent spirits  in my house--thinking _them evil spirits!_--and if the poor could  witness the white livers, the dropsies, the shattered nervous systems  which I love seen as the consequence of drinking, they would be aware  that _spirits_ and _poisons_ were synonymous terms.\"    Institutions; it _will_ advance, and what the legislature may never be  able to accomplish, the spirit of improvement eventually will.    But having considered those cases, in which wilful neglect and bad  example may be charged upon the parents, we should not forget to tell  those who object to our interference in the duty of a child's natural  protectors, that it is not, in every instance, from _wilful_ neglect  on their part, that their children are left unprotected in the  streets. The circumstances of the labouring classes are such, in many  cases, that they are compelled to leave their children either wholly  unprotected, or in the charge of some one who frequently becomes a  betrayer instead of a defender. The father, perhaps, goes to his daily  labour in the morning, before the children are out of bed, and does  not return till they are in bed again at night. The mother goes out in  like manner, the earnings of the husband being insufficient for the  maintenance of the family, and the children are intrusted throughout  the day to the care of some girl, whose parents are as poor as  themselves, and are glad to let her earn something towards her  support. Numbers of little girls thus go out before they are twelve  years old, and teach the little children all they know,--commonly  to be deceitful, and not unfrequently to be dishonest. The parents,  careless or unsuspecting, only make inquiry when they return home if  the children have been good and quiet, and of course receive an answer  in the affirmative. In the course of a few years the evil consequences  begin to show themselves, and then the good folks wonder how or when  the seeds of such depravity could have been sown. Many I know will be  inclined to smile at the insignificancy of the cause pointed out. I  can only say, it is from such springs, however regarded, that the  great stream of vice is supplied; and what we laugh at now, for its  insignificant origin, will hereafter, in its maturity, laugh at us for  our impotence, in vainly endeavouring to stem it. What are parents to  do with their children, situated as those are of whom we have just  spoken? And very many are so situated. Is it possible for them to  perform their duty, as protectors of their children? It requires all  their time to labour for their support, and they therefore leave them,  unavoidably, either in such hands as we have described, or to take  care of themselves; to range the streets, and form such associations  as may there happen to fall in their way. They get into company with  older delinquents, and become first their instruments, and then their  associates; till at length they find their way into a gaol.    This is no delusive way of accounting for the matter,--it is a  solution which experience and observation have taught and established.  I have traced the progress of delinquency, in actual life, from  its earliest stages,--from the little trembling pilferer of the  apple-stall, not more than four or five years old, to the confirmed  thief of nine or ten years--who had been in gaol three or four times,  and was as proud of his dexterity in thieving, and hardihood under  punishment, as he could have been of the most virtuous accomplishment,  or the most becoming fortitude. The infant thief, conscious of shame,  and trembling with fear, will tell you on detection, that \"Tommy,\" or  \"Billy,\" some older associate, set him to do it; you let him go: he  joins his companions, who laugh at the story he tells, ridicule him  for his fears, praise him for his dexterity, and rejoice in his  escape. It will be very easy to imagine how, under a course of such  treatment, the young offender so soon dismisses both shame and fear;  and learns to forget everything but the gain and glory of his crimes.    It is no small matter of credit with older thieves--(by older thieves  I still mean boys of nine or ten years old)--to have under their  tuition two or three pupils. I have seen in my walks as many as seven  or eight sallying forth from the alleys in the neighbourhood of  Spitalfields, under the command, as it were, of a leader, a boy  perhaps not more than nine or ten years old. I have watched their  plans, and have noticed that it was usual to send first the youngest  boy to attempt the theft--perhaps the object to be obtained was only  a bun from the open window of a pastry-cook's shop; if he failed,  another was sent, whilst the rest were lurking at the corner of some  court, ready to flee in case their companion was detected; and I have  sometimes seen, that after all the rest had failed, either from want  of skill, or the too great vigilance of the shop-keeper, the boy  who acted as leader has started out, and by a display of superior  dexterity, would have carried off the prize, had it not happened that  some one was thus purposely watching his conduct. When detected, if an  old offender, he will either look you in tire face with the greatest  effrontery and an expression of defiance, or he will feign to cry,  and tell you he was hungry, has no father nor mother, &c.; though  frequently, on further inquiry, I have found the whole story to be  false.    Alas! there is _one_ class of children, with whom I know not how to  deal, I mean those without the natural protectors. The man can for a  more trifle get rid of all responsibility, though in general, most  able to bear it, the woman has the dead weight, which often proves the  destruction of her offspring, and herself, suicide and murder are  the first-fruits frequently to her, but she loves her offspring, and  perhaps he who deceived her, and for both their sakes fights the  battle against fearful odds; for a few years at least, she will not  last long, at length she sinks! she dies! where, oh! where! is the  guardian for her child! Reader, there are many thousands of such!  What becomes of them? But there are other mothers of this class,  more ignorant, have less of feeling, no education, no training, they  advance from bad to worse, until they have five or six children, here  are circumstances for children to come into the world grievously  against them. What becomes of these? To avoid painful details I will  answer the question, they become a pest to society, each a demoralizer  of others, living upon the public--as tramps, begging impostors,  thieves, teachers of thieves, and _cost the country more than five  times their number born under other and better circumstances_. God  grant that spiritual light, philosophical light, and scientific light  united, may enable us to find the remedy!    The two grand causes of juvenile delinquency, we have seen then, to be  the evil example of parents themselves; and the bad associations  which children form at an early age, when, through neglect, they are  suffered to be in the streets. In the first instance, the parents of  the children are wholly without excuse; in the second, though in some  cases we may blame them, in others we cannot justly do so; but must  admit, as an exculpation, the unfortunate circumstances of their  condition in life.    It would be easy to shew, by a multitude of instances, the evil  effects produced on children of a tender age by street associations.  But I think enough has been said to convince every reflecting mind  that it is highly necessary that we should interfere in behalf of  children so situated; and I shall conclude the present chapter by some  remarks on the various habits and practices of the poor classes, which  have at least an injurious tendency on the character of the rising  generation.    As children are such imitative beings, I cannot help making a few  observations on the tricks which are usually introduced into our  _pantomimes_. It is well known that those of the clown form a  principal part of the entertainment. It is also equally well known,  that the pantomimes"]]]
