There the egg had been, sunk in that cold black mud, perhaps  three hundred years. But there was no mistaking it. There was the--what is  it?--embryo, with its big head and curved back, and its heart beating  under its throat, and the yolk shrivelled up and great membranes spreading  inside of the shell and all over the yolk. Here was I hatching out the  eggs of the biggest of all extinct birds, in a little canoe in the midst  of the Indian Ocean. If old Dawson had known that! It was worth four  years' salary. What do _you_ think?    \"However, I had to eat that precious thing up, every bit of it, before I  sighted the reef, and some of the mouthfuls were beastly unpleasant. I  left the third one alone. I held it up to the light, but the shell was too  thick for me to get any notion of what might be happening inside; and  though I fancied I heard blood pulsing, it might have been the rustle in  my own ears, like what you listen to in a seashell.    \"Then came the atoll. Came out of the sunrise, as it were, suddenly, close  up to me. I drifted straight towards it until I was about half a mile from  shore, not more, and then the current took a turn, and I had to paddle as  hard as I could with my hands and bits of the AEpyornis shell to make the  place. However, I got there. It was just a common atoll about four miles  round, with a few trees growing and a spring in one place, and the lagoon  full of parrot-fish. I took the egg ashore and put it in a good place,  well above the tide lines and in the sun, to give it all the chance I  could, and pulled the canoe up safe, and loafed about prospecting. It's  rum how dull an atoll is. As soon as I had found a spring all the interest  seemed to vanish. When I was a kid I thought nothing could be finer or  more adventurous than the Robinson Crusoe business, but that place was as  monotonous as a book of sermons. I went round finding eatable things and  generally thinking; but I tell you I was bored to death before the first  day was out. It shows my luck--the very day I landed the weather changed.  A thunderstorm went by to the north and flicked its wing over the island,  and in the night there came a drencher and a howling wind slap over us. It  wouldn't have taken much, you know, to upset that canoe.    \"I was sleeping under the canoe, and the egg was luckily among the sand  higher up the beach, and the first thing I remember was a sound like a  hundred pebbles hitting the boat at once, and a rush of water over my  body. I'd been dreaming of Antananarivo, and I sat up and holloaed to  Intoshi to ask her what the devil was up, and clawed out at the chair  where the matches used to be. Then I remembered where I was. There were  phosphorescent waves rolling up as if they meant to eat me, and all the  rest of the night as black as pitch. The air was simply yelling. The  clouds seemed down on your head almost, and the rain fell as if heaven was  sinking and they were baling out the waters above the firmament. One great  roller came writhing at me, like a fiery serpent, and I bolted. Then I  thought of the canoe, and ran down to it as the water went hissing back  again; but the thing had gone. I wondered about the egg then, and felt my  way to it. It was all right and well out of reach of the maddest waves, so  I sat down beside it and cuddled it for company. Lord! what a night that  was!    \"The storm was over before the morning. There wasn't a rag of cloud left  in the sky when the dawn came, and all along the beach there were bits of  plank scattered--which was the disarticulated skeleton, so to speak, of my  canoe. However, that gave me something to do, for, taking advantage of two  of the trees being together, I rigged up a kind of storm-shelter with  these vestiges. And that day the egg hatched.    \"Hatched, sir, when my head was pillowed on it and I was asleep. I heard a  whack and felt a jar and sat up, and there was the end of the egg pecked  out and a rum little brown head looking out at me. 'Lord!' I said, 'you're  welcome'; and with a little difficulty he came out.    \"He was a nice friendly little chap at first, about the size of a small  hen--very much like most other young birds, only bigger. His plumage was a  dirty brown to begin with, with a sort of grey scab that fell off it very  soon, and scarcely feathers--a kind of downy hair. I can hardly express  how pleased I was to see him. I tell you, Robinson Crusoe don't make near  enough of his loneliness. But here was interesting company. He looked at  me and winked his eye from the front backwards, like a hen, and gave a  chirp and began to peck about at once, as though being hatched three  hundred years too late was just nothing. 'Glad to see you, Man Friday!'  says I, for I had naturally settled he was to be called Man Friday if ever  he was hatched, as soon as ever I found the egg in the canoe had  developed. I was a bit anxious about his feed, so I gave him a lump of raw  parrot-fish at once. He took it, and opened his beak for more. I was glad  of that for, under the circumstances, if he'd been at all fanciful, I  should have had to eat him after all.    \"You'd be surprised what an interesting bird that AEpyornis chick was. He  followed me about from the very beginning. He used to stand by me and  watch while I fished in the lagoon, and go shares in anything I caught.  And he was sensible, too. There were nasty green warty things, like  pickled gherkins, used to lie about on the beach, and he tried one of  these and it upset him. He never even looked at any of them again.    \"And he grew. You could almost see him grow. And as I was never much of a  society man, his quiet, friendly ways suited me to a T. For nearly two  years we were as happy as we could be on that island. I had no business  worries, for I knew my salary was mounting up at Dawsons'. We would see a  sail now and then, but nothing ever came near us. I amused myself, too, by  decorating the island with designs worked in sea-urchins and fancy shells  of various kinds. I put AEPYORNIS ISLAND all round the place very nearly,  in big letters, like what you see done with coloured stones at railway  stations in the old country, and mathematical calculations and drawings of  various sorts. And I used to lie watching the blessed bird stalking round  and growing, growing; and think how I could make a living out of him by  showing him about if I ever got taken off. After his first moult he began  to get handsome, with a crest and a blue wattle, and a lot of green  feathers at the behind of him. And then I used to puzzle whether Dawsons'  had any right to claim him or not. Stormy weather and in the rainy season  we lay snug under the shelter I had made out of the old canoe, and I used  to tell him lies about my friends at home. And after a storm we would go  round the island together to see if there was any drift. It was a kind of  idyll, you might say. If only I had had some tobacco it would have been  simply just like heaven.    \"It was about the end of the second year our little paradise went wrong.  Friday was then about fourteen feet high to the bill of him, with a big,  broad head like the end of a pickaxe, and two huge brown eyes with yellow  rims, set together like a man's--not out of sight of each other like a  hen's. His plumage was fine--none of the half-mourning style of your  ostrich--more like a cassowary as far as colour and texture go. And then  it was he began to cock his comb at me and give himself airs, and show  signs of a nasty temper ...    \"At last came a time when my fishing had been rather unlucky, and he began  to hang about me in a queer, meditative way. I thought he might have been  eating sea-cucumbers or something, but it was really just discontent on  his part. I was hungry too, and when at last I landed a fish I wanted it  for myself. Tempers were short that morning on both sides. He pecked at it  and grabbed it, and I gave him a whack on the head to make him leave go.  And at that he went for me. Lord! ...    \"He gave me this in the face.\" The man indicated his scar. \"Then he kicked  me. It was like a carthorse. I got up, and seeing he hadn't finished, I  started off full tilt with my arms doubled up over my face. But he ran on  those gawky legs of his faster than a racehorse, and kept landing out at  me with sledgehammer kicks, and bringing his pickaxe down on the back of  my head. I made for the lagoon, and went in up to my neck. He stopped at  the water, for he hated getting his feet wet, and began to make a shindy,  something like a peacock's, only hoarser. He started strutting up and down  the beach. I'll admit I felt small to see this blessed fossil lording it  there. And my head and face were all bleeding, and--well, my body just one  jelly of bruises.    \"I decided to swim across the lagoon and leave him alone for a bit, until  the affair blew over. I shinned up the tallest palm-tree, and sat there  thinking of it all. I don't suppose I ever felt so hurt by anything before  or since. It was the brutal ingratitude of the creature. I'd been more  than a brother to him. I'd hatched him, educated him. A great gawky,  out-of-date bird! And me a human being--heir of the ages and all that.    \"I thought after a time he'd begin to see things in that light himself,  and feel a little sorry for his behaviour. I thought if I was to catch  some nice little bits of fish, perhaps, and go to him presently in a  casual kind of way, and offer them to him, he might do the sensible thing.  It took me some time to learn how unforgiving and cantankerous an extinct  bird can be. Malice!    \"I won't tell you all the little devices I tried to get that bird round  again, I simply can't. It makes my cheek burn with shame even now to think  of the snubs and buffets I had from this infernal curiosity. I tried  violence."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1188"],[0,"The Lair of the White Worm (#12)"],[1,"plague of birds.  At last he recalled a circumstance  which promised a solution of the difficulty.  The experience was of some  years ago in China, far up-country, towards the head-waters of the Yang-  tze-kiang, where the smaller tributaries spread out in a sort of natural  irrigation scheme to supply the wilderness of paddy-fields.  It was at  the time of the ripening rice, and the myriads of birds which came to  feed on the coming crop was a serious menace, not only to the district,  but to the country at large.  The farmers, who were more or less  afflicted with the same trouble every season, knew how to deal with it.  They made a vast kite, which they caused to be flown over the centre spot  of the incursion.  The kite was shaped like a great hawk; and the moment  it rose into the air the birds began to cower and seek protection--and  then to disappear.  So long as that kite was flying overhead the birds  lay low and the crop was saved.  Accordingly Caswall ordered his men to  construct an immense kite, adhering as well as they could to the lines of  a hawk.  Then he and his men, with a sufficiency of cord, began to fly it  high overhead.  The experience of China was repeated.  The moment the  kite rose, the birds hid or sought shelter.  The following morning, the  kite was still flying high, no bird was to be seen as far as the eye  could reach from Castra Regis.  But there followed in turn what proved  even a worse evil.  All the birds were cowed; their sounds stopped.  Neither song nor chirp was heard--silence seemed to have taken the place  of the normal voices of bird life.  But that was not all.  The silence  spread to all animals.    The fear and restraint which brooded amongst the denizens of the air  began to affect all life.  Not only did the birds cease song or chirp,  but the lowing of the cattle ceased in the fields and the varied sounds  of life died away.  In place of these things was only a soundless gloom,  more dreadful, more disheartening, more soul-killing than any concourse  of sounds, no matter how full of fear and dread.  Pious individuals put  up constant prayers for relief from the intolerable solitude.  After a  little there were signs of universal depression which those who ran might  read.  One and all, the faces of men and women seemed bereft of vitality,  of interest, of thought, and, most of all, of hope.  Men seemed to have  lost the power of expression of their thoughts.  The soundless air seemed  to have the same effect as the universal darkness when men gnawed their  tongues with pain.    From this infliction of silence there was no relief.  Everything was  affected; gloom was the predominant note.  Joy appeared to have passed  away as a factor of life, and this creative impulse had nothing to take  its place.  That giant spot in high air was a plague of evil influence.  It seemed like a new misanthropic belief which had fallen on human  beings, carrying with it the negation of all hope.    After a few days, men began to grow desperate; their very words as well  as their senses seemed to be in chains.  Edgar Caswall again tortured his  brain to find any antidote or palliative of this greater evil than  before.  He would gladly have destroyed the kite, or caused its flying to  cease; but the instant it was pulled down, the birds rose up in even  greater numbers; all those who depended in any way on agriculture sent  pitiful protests to Castra Regis.    It was strange indeed what influence that weird kite seemed to exercise.  Even human beings were affected by it, as if both it and they were  realities.  As for the people at Mercy Farm, it was like a taste of  actual death.  Lilla felt it most.  If she had been indeed a real dove,  with a real kite hanging over her in the air, she could not have been  more frightened or more affected by the terror this created.    Of course, some of those already drawn into the vortex noticed the effect  on individuals.  Those who were interested took care to compare their  information.  Strangely enough, as it seemed to the others, the person  who took the ghastly silence least to heart was the negro.  By nature he  was not sensitive to, or afflicted by, nerves.  This alone would not have  produced the seeming indifference, so they set their minds to discover  the real cause.  Adam came quickly to the conclusion that there was for  him some compensation that the others did not share; and he soon believed  that that compensation was in one form or another the enjoyment of the  sufferings of others.  Thus the black had a never-failing source of  amusement.    Lady Arabella's cold nature rendered her immune to anything in the way of  pain or trouble concerning others.  Edgar Caswall was far too haughty a  person, and too stern of nature, to concern himself about poor or  helpless people, much less the lower order of mere animals.  Mr. Watford,  Mr. Salton, and Sir Nathaniel were all concerned in the issue, partly  from kindness of heart--for none of them could see suffering, even of  wild birds, unmoved--and partly on account of their property, which had  to be protected, or ruin would stare them in the face before long.    Lilla suffered acutely.  As time went on, her face became pinched, and  her eyes dull with watching and crying.  Mimi suffered too on account of  her cousin's suffering.  But as she could do nothing, she resolutely made  up her mind to self-restraint and patience.  Adam's frequent visits  comforted her.          CHAPTER XI--MESMER'S CHEST      After a couple of weeks had passed, the kite seemed to give Edgar Caswall  a new zest for life.  He was never tired of looking at its movements.  He  had a comfortable armchair put out on the tower, wherein he sat sometimes  all day long, watching as though the kite was a new toy and he a child  lately come into possession of it.  He did not seem to have lost interest  in Lilla, for he still paid an occasional visit at Mercy Farm.    Indeed, his feeling towards her, whatever it had been at first, had now  so far changed that it had become a distinct affection of a purely animal  kind.  Indeed, it seemed as though the man's nature had become corrupted,  and that all the baser and more selfish and more reckless qualities had  become more conspicuous.  There was not so much sternness apparent in his  nature, because there was less self-restraint.  Determination had become  indifference.    The visible change in Edgar was that he grew morbid, sad, silent; the  neighbours thought he was going mad.  He became absorbed in the kite, and  watched it not only by day, but often all night long.  It became an  obsession to him.    Caswall took a personal interest in the keeping of the great kite flying.  He had a vast coil of cord efficient for the purpose, which worked on a  roller fixed on the parapet of the tower.  There was a winch for the  pulling in of the slack; the outgoing line being controlled by a racket.  There was invariably one man at least, day and night, on the tower to  attend to it.  At such an elevation there was always a strong wind, and  at times the kite rose to an enormous height, as well as travelling for  great distances laterally.  In fact, the kite became, in a short time,  one of the curiosities of Castra Regis and all around it.  Edgar began to  attribute to it, in his own mind, almost human qualities.  It became to  him a separate entity, with a mind and a soul of its own.  Being idle-  handed all day, he began to apply to what he considered the service of  the kite some of his spare time, and found a new pleasure--a new object  in life--in the old schoolboy game of sending up \"runners\" to the kite.  The way this is done is to get round pieces of paper so cut that there is  a hole in the centre, through which the string of the kite passes.  The  natural action of the wind-pressure takes the paper along the string, and  so up to the kite itself, no matter how high or how far it may have gone.    In the early days of this amusement Edgar Caswall spent hours.  Hundreds  of such messengers flew along the string, until soon he bethought him of  writing messages on these papers so that he could make known his ideas to  the kite.  It may be that his brain gave way under the opportunities  given by his illusion of the entity of the toy and its power of separate  thought.  From sending messages he came to making direct speech to the  kite--without, however, ceasing to send the runners.  Doubtless, the  height of the tower, seated as it was on the hill-top, the rushing of the  ceaseless wind, the hypnotic effect of the lofty altitude of the speck in  the sky at which he gazed, and the rushing of the paper messengers up the  string till sight of them was lost in distance, all helped to further  affect his brain, undoubtedly giving way under the strain of beliefs and  circumstances which were at once stimulating to the imagination,  occupative of his mind, and absorbing.    The next step of intellectual decline was to bring to bear on the main  idea of the conscious identity of the kite all sorts of subjects which  had imaginative force or tendency of their own.  He had, in Castra Regis,  a large collection of curious and interesting things formed in the past  by his forebears, of similar tastes to his own.  There were all sorts of  strange anthropological specimens, both old and new, which had been  collected through various travels in strange places: ancient Egyptian  relics from tombs and mummies; curios from Australia, New Zealand, and  the South Seas; idols and images--from Tartar ikons to ancient Egyptian,  Persian, and Indian objects of worship; objects of death and torture of  American Indians; and, above all, a vast collection of lethal weapons of  every kind and from every place--Chinese \"high pinders,\" double knives,  Afghan double-edged scimitars made to cut a body in two, heavy knives  from all the Eastern countries, ghost daggers from Thibet, the terrible"]]]
