The more you knew  of that country, young fellah, the more you would understand that  anythin' was possible--ANYTHIN'!  There are just some narrow  water-lanes along which folk travel, and outside that it is all  darkness.  Now, down here in the Matto Grande\"--he swept his cigar over  a part of the map--\"or up in this corner where three countries meet,  nothin' would surprise me.  As that chap said to-night, there are  fifty-thousand miles of water-way runnin' through a forest that is very  near the size of Europe.  You and I could be as far away from each  other as Scotland is from Constantinople, and yet each of us be in the  same great Brazilian forest.  Man has just made a track here and a  scrape there in the maze.  Why, the river rises and falls the best part  of forty feet, and half the country is a morass that you can't pass  over.  Why shouldn't somethin' new and wonderful lie in such a country?  And why shouldn't we be the men to find it out?  Besides,\" he added,  his queer, gaunt face shining with delight, \"there's a sportin' risk in  every mile of it.  I'm like an old golf-ball--I've had all the white  paint knocked off me long ago.  Life can whack me about now, and it  can't leave a mark.  But a sportin' risk, young fellah, that's the salt  of existence.  Then it's worth livin' again.  We're all gettin' a deal  too soft and dull and comfy.  Give me the great waste lands and the  wide spaces, with a gun in my fist and somethin' to look for that's  worth findin'.  I've tried war and steeplechasin' and aeroplanes, but  this huntin' of beasts that look like a lobster-supper dream is a  brand-new sensation.\" He chuckled with glee at the prospect.    Perhaps I have dwelt too long upon this new acquaintance, but he is to  be my comrade for many a day, and so I have tried to set him down as I  first saw him, with his quaint personality and his queer little tricks  of speech and of thought.  It was only the need of getting in the  account of my meeting which drew me at last from his company.  I left  him seated amid his pink radiance, oiling the lock of his favorite  rifle, while he still chuckled to himself at the thought of the  adventures which awaited us.  It was very clear to me that if dangers  lay before us I could not in all England have found a cooler head or a  braver spirit with which to share them.    That night, wearied as I was after the wonderful happenings of the day,  I sat late with McArdle, the news editor, explaining to him the whole  situation, which he thought important enough to bring next morning  before the notice of Sir George Beaumont, the chief.  It was agreed  that I should write home full accounts of my adventures in the shape of  successive letters to McArdle, and that these should either be edited  for the Gazette as they arrived, or held back to be published later,  according to the wishes of Professor Challenger, since we could not yet  know what conditions he might attach to those directions which should  guide us to the unknown land.  In response to a telephone inquiry, we  received nothing more definite than a fulmination against the Press,  ending up with the remark that if we would notify our boat he would  hand us any directions which he might think it proper to give us at the  moment of starting.  A second question from us failed to elicit any  answer at all, save a plaintive bleat from his wife to the effect that  her husband was in a very violent temper already, and that she hoped we  would do nothing to make it worse.  A third attempt, later in the day,  provoked a terrific crash, and a subsequent message from the Central  Exchange that Professor Challenger's receiver had been shattered.  After that we abandoned all attempt at communication.    And now my patient readers, I can address you directly no longer.  From  now onwards (if, indeed, any continuation of this narrative should ever  reach you) it can only be through the paper which I represent.  In the  hands of the editor I leave this account of the events which have led  up to one of the most remarkable expeditions of all time, so that if I  never return to England there shall be some record as to how the affair  came about.  I am writing these last lines in the saloon of the Booth  liner Francisca, and they will go back by the pilot to the keeping of  Mr. McArdle.  Let me draw one last picture before I close the  notebook--a picture which is the last memory of the old country which I  bear away with me.  It is a wet, foggy morning in the late spring; a  thin, cold rain is falling.  Three shining mackintoshed figures are  walking down the quay, making for the gang-plank of the great liner  from which the blue-peter is flying.  In front of them a porter pushes  a trolley piled high with trunks, wraps, and gun-cases.  Professor  Summerlee, a long, melancholy figure, walks with dragging steps and  drooping head, as one who is already profoundly sorry for himself.  Lord John Roxton steps briskly, and his thin, eager face beams forth  between his hunting-cap and his muffler.  As for myself, I am glad to  have got the bustling days of preparation and the pangs of leave-taking  behind me, and I have no doubt that I show it in my bearing.  Suddenly,  just as we reach the vessel, there is a shout behind us.  It is  Professor Challenger, who had promised to see us off.  He runs after  us, a puffing, red-faced, irascible figure.    \"No thank you,\" says he; \"I should much prefer not to go aboard.  I  have only a few words to say to you, and they can very well be said  where we are.  I beg you not to imagine that I am in any way indebted  to you for making this journey.  I would have you to understand that it  is a matter of perfect indifference to me, and I refuse to entertain  the most remote sense of personal obligation.  Truth is truth, and  nothing which you can report can affect it in any way, though it may  excite the emotions and allay the curiosity of a number of very  ineffectual people.  My directions for your instruction and guidance  are in this sealed envelope.  You will open it when you reach a town  upon the Amazon which is called Manaos, but not until the date and hour  which is marked upon the outside.  Have I made myself clear?  I leave  the strict observance of my conditions entirely to your honor.  No, Mr.  Malone, I will place no restriction upon your correspondence, since the  ventilation of the facts is the object of your journey; but I demand  that you shall give no particulars as to your exact destination, and  that nothing be actually published until your return.  Good-bye, sir.  You have done something to mitigate my feelings for the loathsome  profession to which you unhappily belong.  Good-bye, Lord John.  Science is, as I understand, a sealed book to you; but you may  congratulate yourself upon the hunting-field which awaits you.  You  will, no doubt, have the opportunity of describing in the Field how you  brought down the rocketing dimorphodon.  And good-bye to you also,  Professor Summerlee.  If you are still capable of self-improvement, of  which I am frankly unconvinced, you will surely return to London a  wiser man.\"    So he turned upon his heel, and a minute later from the deck I could  see his short, squat figure bobbing about in the distance as he made  his way back to his train.  Well, we are well down Channel now.  There's the last bell for letters, and it's good-bye to the pilot.  We'll be \"down, hull-down, on the old trail\" from now on.  God bless  all we leave behind us, and send us safely back.                                     CHAPTER VII                \"To-morrow we Disappear into the Unknown\"    I will not bore those whom this narrative may reach by an account of  our luxurious voyage upon the Booth liner, nor will I tell of our  week's stay at Para (save that I should wish to acknowledge the great  kindness of the Pereira da Pinta Company in helping us to get together  our equipment).  I will also allude very briefly to our river journey,  up a wide, slow-moving, clay-tinted stream, in a steamer which was  little smaller than that which had carried us across the Atlantic.  Eventually we found ourselves through the narrows of Obidos and reached  the town of Manaos.  Here we were rescued from the limited attractions  of the local inn by Mr. Shortman, the representative of the British and  Brazilian Trading Company.  In his hospitable Fazenda we spent our time  until the day when we were empowered to open the letter of instructions  given to us by Professor Challenger.  Before I reach the surprising  events of that date I would desire to give a clearer sketch of my  comrades in this enterprise, and of the associates whom we had already  gathered together in South America.  I speak freely, and I leave the  use of my material to your own discretion, Mr. McArdle, since it is  through your hands that this report must pass before it reaches the  world.    The scientific attainments of Professor Summerlee are too well known  for me to trouble to recapitulate them.  He is better equipped for a  rough expedition of this sort than one would imagine at first sight.  His tall, gaunt, stringy figure is insensible to fatigue, and his dry,  half-sarcastic, and often wholly unsympathetic manner is uninfluenced  by any change in his surroundings.  Though in his sixty-sixth year, I  have never heard him express any dissatisfaction at the occasional  hardships which we have had to encounter.  I had regarded his presence  as an encumbrance to the expedition, but, as a matter of fact, I am now  well convinced that his power of endurance is as great as my own.  In  temper he is naturally acid and sceptical.  From the beginning he has  never concealed his belief that Professor Challenger is an absolute  fraud, that we are all embarked upon an absurd wild-goose chase and  that we are likely to reap nothing but disappointment and danger in  South America, and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1390"],[0,"The Jimmyjohn Boss, and Other Stories (#12)"],[1," looked  at him. Then the mongrel strain of blood told, and the half-breed poured  out a chattering appeal, while Red Cloud by the bedside waited till it  had spent itself. Then he grunted, and left the room. He had not spoken,  and his crest of long feathers as it turned the corner was the last  vision of him that the card-players had.    Red Cloud came back to the officers, and in their presence formally  spoke to his interpreter, who delivered the message: \"Red Cloud says  Toussaint heap no good. No Injun, anyhow. He not want him. White man  hunt pretty hard for him. Can keep him.\"    Thus was Toussaint twice sentenced. He improved under treatment, played  many games of whiskey-poker, and was conveyed to Cheyenne and hanged.    These things happened in the early seventies; but there are Sioux  still living who remember the two lieutenants, and how they pulled the  half-breed out of White River by his false hair. It makes them laugh to  this day. Almost any Indian is full of talk when he chooses, and when he  gets hold of a joke he never lets go.          Sharon's Choice      Under Providence, a man may achieve the making of many things--ships,  books, fortunes, himself even, quite often enough to encourage  others; but let him beware of creating a town. Towns mostly happen. No  real-estate operator decided that Rome should be. Sharon was an intended  town; a one man's piece of deliberate manufacture; his whim, his pet,  his monument, his device for immortally continuing above ground. He  planned its avenues, gave it his middle name, fed it with his railroad.  But he had reckoned without the inhabitants (to say nothing of nature),  and one day they displeased him. Whenever you wish, you can see Sharon  and what it has come to as I saw it when, as a visitor without local  prejudices, they asked me to serve with the telegraph-operator and the  ticket-agent and the hotel-manager on the literary committee of  judges at the school festival. There would be a stage, and flags,  and elocution, and parents assembled, and afterwards ice-cream with  strawberries from El Paso.    \"Have you ever awarded prizes for school speaking?\" inquired the  telegraph-operator, Stuart.    \"Yes,\" I told him. \"At Concord in New Hampshire.\"    \"Ever have a chat afterwards with a mother whose girl did not get the  prize?\"    \"It was boys,\" I replied. \"And parents had no say in it.\"    \"It's boys and girls in Sharon,\" said he. \"Parents have no say in it  here, either. But that don't seem to occur to them at the moment. We'll  all stick together, of course.\"    \"I think I had best resign.\" said I. \"You would find me no hand at  pacifying a mother.\"    \"There are fathers also,\" said Stuart. \"But individual parents are small  trouble compared with a big split in public opinion. We've missed that  so far, though.\"    \"Then why have judges? Why not a popular vote?\" I inquired.    \"Don't go back on us,\" said Stuart. \"We are so few here. And you know  education can't be democratic or where will good taste find itself?  Eastman knows that much, at least.\" And Stuart explained that Eastman  was the head of the school and chairman of our committee. \"He is from  Massachusetts, and his taste is good, but he is total abstinence. Won't  allow any literature with the least smell of a drink in it, not even  in the singing-class. Would not have 'Here's a health to King Charles'  inside the door. Narrowing, that; as many of the finest classics speak  of wine freely. Eastman is useful, but a crank. Now take 'Lochinvar.'  We are to have it on strawberry night; but say! Eastman kicked about it.  Told the kid to speak something else. Kid came to me, and I--\"    A smile lurked for one instant in the corner of Stuart's eye, and  disappeared again. Then he drew his arm through mine as we walked.    \"You have never seen anything in your days like Sharon,\" said he. \"You  could not sit down by yourself and make such a thing up. Shakespeare  might have, but he would have strained himself doing it. Well, Eastman  says 'Lochinvar' will go in my expurgated version. Too bad Sir Walter  cannot know. Ever read his Familiar Letters, Great grief! but he was a  good man. Eastman stuck about that mention of wine. Remember?         'So now am I come with this lost love of mine       To lead but one measure, drink one cup of wine.'    'Well,' thought I, 'Eastman would agree to water. Water and daughter  would go, but is frequently used, and spoils the meter.' So I fiddled  with my pencil down in the telegraph office, and I fixed the thing up.  How's this?         'So now am I come with this beautiful maid       To lead but one measure, drink one lemonade.'    Eastman accepts that. Says it's purer. Oh, it's not all sadness here!\"    \"How did you come to be in Sharon?\" I asked my exotic acquaintance.    \"Ah, how did I? How did all our crowd at the railroad? Somebody has got  to sell tickets, somebody has got to run that hotel, and telegraphs have  got to exist here. That's how we foreigners came. Many travellers change  cars here, and one train usually misses the other, because the two  companies do not love each other. You hear lots of language, especially  in December. Eastern consumptives bound for southern California get left  here, and drummers are also thick. Remarks range from 'How provoking!'  to things I would not even say myself. So that big hotel and depot has  to be kept running, and we fellows get a laugh now and then. Our lot is  better than these people's.\" He made a general gesture at Sharon.    \"I should have thought it was worse,\" said I. \"No, for we'll be  transferred some day. These poor folks are shipwrecked. Though it is  their own foolishness, all this.\"    Again my eye followed as he indicated the town with a sweep of his hand;  and from the town I looked to the four quarters of heaven. I may have  seen across into Old Mexico. No sign labels the boundary; the vacuum  of continent goes on, you might think, to Patagonia. Symptoms of  neighboring Mexico basked on the sand heaps along Sharon's spacious  avenues--little torpid, indecent gnomes in sashes and open rags, with  crowning-steeple straw hats, and murder dozing in their small black  eyes. They might have crawled from holes in the sand, or hatched out  of brown cracked pods on some weeds that trailed through the broken  bottles, the old shoes, and the wire fences. Outside these ramparts  began the vacuum, white, gray, indigo, florescent, where all the year  the sun shines. Not the semblance of any tree dances in the heat; only  rocks and lumps of higher sand waver and dissolve and reappear in the  shaking crystal of mirage. Not the scar of any river-bed furrows the  void. A river there is, flowing somewhere out of the shiny violet  mountains to the north, but it dies subterraneously on its way to  Sharon, misses the town, and emerges thirty miles south across the  sunlight in a shallow, futile lake, a cienaga, called Las Palomas. Then  it evaporates into the ceaseless blue sky.    The water you get in Sharon is dragged by a herd of wind-wheels from  the bowels of the sand. Over the town they turn and turn--Sharon's upper  story--a filmy colony of slats. In some of the homes beneath them you  may go up-stairs--in the American homes, not in the adobe Mexican  caves of song, woman, and knives; and brick and stone edifices occur.  Monuments of perished trade, these rise among their flatter neighbors  cubical and stark; under-shirts, fire-arms, and groceries for sale  in the ground-floor, blind dust-windows above. Most of the mansions,  however, squat ephemerally upon the soil, no cellar to them, and no  staircase, the total fragile box ready to bounce and caracole should the  wind drive hard enough. Inside them, eating, mending, the newspaper, and  more babies, eke out the twelvemonth; outside, the citizens loiter to  their errands along the brief wide avenues of Sharon that empty into  space. Men, women, and children move about in the town, sparse and  casual, and over their heads in a white tribe the wind-wheels on their  rudders veer to the breeze and indolently revolve above the gaping  obsoleteness. Through the dumb town the locomotive bell tolls  pervadingly when a train of freight or passengers trundles in from the  horizon or out along the dwindling fence of telegraph poles. No matter  where you are, you can hear it come and go, leaving Sharon behind, an  airy carcass, bleached and ventilated, sitting on the sand, with the sun  and the hot wind pouring through its bones.    This town was the magnate's child, the thing that was to keep his memory  green; and as I took it in on that first walk of discovery, Stuart told  me its story: how the magnate had decreed the railroad shops should be  here; how, at that, corner lots grew in a night; how horsemen galloped  the streets, shooting for joy, and the hasty tents rose while the  houses were hammered together; how they had song, dance, cards, whiskey,  license, murder, marriage, opera--the whole usual thing--regular as the  clock in our West, in Australia, in Africa, in every virgin corner  of the world where the Anglo-Saxon rushes to spend his animal  spirits--regular as the clock, and in Sharon's case about fifteen  minutes long. For they became greedy, the corner-lot people. They ran  up prices for land which the railroad, the breath of their nostrils,  wanted. They grew ugly, forgetting they were dealing with a magnate, and  that a railroad from ocean to ocean can take its shops somewhere else  with appalling ease. Thus did the corner lots become sand again in a  night. \"And in the words of the poet,\" concluded Stuart, \"Sharon has an  immense future behind it.\"    Our talk was changed by the sight of a lady leaning and calling over a  fence.    \"Mrs. Jeffries,\" said she. \"Oh, Mrs. Jeffries!\"    \"Well?\" called a voice next door.    \"I want to send Leola and Arvasita into your yard.\"    \"Well?\" the voice repeated.    \"Our tool-house blew over into"]]]
