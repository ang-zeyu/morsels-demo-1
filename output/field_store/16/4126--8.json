To be sure, she might not  accept him; but the mere knowledge that she was to have the chance  seemed enormously to increase my responsibility in the matter. As for  the dilemma in which I now found myself, deservedly as you please, there  was no comparing it with any former phase of this affair.      \"O, what a tangled web we weave,    When first we practise to deceive!\"    The hackneyed lines sprang unbidden, as though to augment my punishment;  then suddenly I reflected that it was not in my own interest I had begun  to practise my deceit; and the thought of Catherine braced me up,  perhaps partly because I felt that it should. I put myself back into the  fascinating little room in Elm Park Gardens. I saw the slender figure in  the picture hat, I heard the half-humorous and half-pathetic voice.  After all, it was for Catherine I had undertaken this ridiculous  mission; she was therefore my first and had much better be my only  consideration. I could not run with the hare after hunting with the  hounds. And I should like to have seen Catherine's face if I had  expressed any sympathy with the hare!    No; it was better to be unscrupulously stanch to one woman than weakly  chivalrous toward both; and my mind was made up by the end of dinner.  There was only one chance now of saving the wretched Bob, or rather one  way of setting to work to save him; and that was by actually adopting  the course with which he had already credited me. He thought I was  \"trying to cut him out.\" Well, I would try!    But the more I thought of him, of Mrs. Lascelles, of them both, the less  sanguine I felt of success; for had I been she (I could not help  admitting it to myself), as lonely, as reckless, as unlucky, I would  have married the dear young idiot on the spot. Not that my own marriage  (with Mrs. Lascelles) was an end that I contemplated for a moment as I  took my cynical resolve. And now I trust that I have made both my  position and my intentions very plain, and have written myself down  neither more of a fool nor less of a knave than circumstances (and one's  own infirmities) combined to make me at this juncture of my career.    The design was still something bolder than its execution, and if Bob did  not propose that night it was certainly no fault of mine. I saw him with  Mrs. Lascelles on the terrace after dinner; but I had neither the heart  nor the face to thrust myself upon them. Everything was altered since  Bob had shown me his hand; there were certain rules of the game which  even I must now observe. So I left him in undisputed possession of the  perilous ground, and being in a heavy glow from the strong air of the  glacier, went early to my room; where I lay long enough without a wink,  but quite prepared for Bob, with news of his engagement, at every step  in the corridor.    Next day was Sunday, and chiefly, I am afraid, because there was neither  blind nor curtain to my dormer-window, and the morning sun streamed full  upon my pillow, I got up and went to early service in the little tin  Protestant Church. It was wonderfully well attended. Quinby was there,  a head taller than anybody else, and some sizes smaller in heads. The  American bridegroom came in late with his \"best girl.\" The late Vice  Chancellor, with the peeled nose, and Mr. Belgrave Teale, fit for Church  Parade, or for the afternoon act in one of his own fashion-plays, took  round the offertory bags, into which Mr. Justice Sankey (in race-course  checks) dropped gold. It was not the sort of service at which one cares  to look about one, but I was among the early comers, and I could not  help it. Mrs. Lascelles, however, was there before me, whereas Bob Evers  was not there at all. Nevertheless, I did not mean to walk back with her  until I saw her walking very much alone, a sort of cynosure even on the  way from church, though humble and grave and unconscious as any country  maid. I watched her with the rest, but in a spirit of my own. Some  subtle change I seemed to detect in Mrs. Lascelles as in Bob. Had he  really declared himself overnight, and had she actually accepted him? A  new load seemed to rest upon her shoulders, a new anxiety, a new care;  and as if to confirm my idea, she started and changed colour as I came  up.    \"I didn't see you in church,\" she remarked, in her own natural fashion,  when we had exchanged the ordinary salutations.    \"I am afraid you wouldn't expect to see me, Mrs. Lascelles.\"    \"Well, as a matter of fact, I didn't, but I suppose,\" added Mrs.  Lascelles, as her rich voice fell into a pensive (but not a pathetic)  key, \"I suppose it is you who are much more surprised at seeing me. I  can't help it if you are, Captain Clephane. I am not really a religious  person. I have not flown to that extreme as yet. But it has been a  comfort to me, sometimes; and so, sometimes, I go.\"    It was very simply said, but with a sigh at the end that left me  wondering whether she was in any new need of spiritual solace. Did she  already find herself in the dilemma in which I had imagined her, and was  it really a dilemma to her? New hopes began to chase my fears, and were  gaining upon them when a flannel suit on the sunlit steps caused a  temporary check: there was Bob waiting for us, his hands in his  pockets, a smile upon his face, yet in the slope of his shoulders and  the carriage of his head a certain indefinable but very visible  attention and intent.    \"Is Mrs. Evers a religious woman?\" asked my companion, her step slowing  ever so slightly as we approached.    \"Not exactly; but she knows all about it,\" I replied.    \"And doesn't believe very much? Then we shouldn't hit it off,\" exclaimed  Mrs. Lascelles, \"for I know nothing and believe all I can! Nevertheless,  I'm not going to church again to-day.\"    The last words were in a sort of aside, and I afterwards heard that Bob  and Mrs. Lascelles had attended the later service together on the  previous Sunday; but I guessed almost as much on the spot, and it put  out of my head both the unjust assumption of the earlier remark,  concerning Catherine, and the contrast between them which Mrs. Lascelles  could hardly afford to emphasise.    \"Let's go somewhere else instead--Zermatt--or anywhere else you like,\" I  suggested, eagerly; but we were close to the steps, and before she  could reply Bob had taken off his straw hat to Mrs. Lascelles, and flung  me a nod.    \"How very energetic!\" he cried. \"I only hope it's a true indication of  form, for I've got a scheme: instead of putting in another chapel I  propose we stroll down to Zermatt for lunch and come back by the train.\"    Bob's proposal was made pointedly to Mrs. Lascelles, and as pointedly  excluded me, but she stood between the two of us with a charming smile  of good-humoured perplexity.    \"Now what am I to say? Captain Clephane was in the very act of making  the same suggestion!\"    Bob glared on me for an instant in spite of Eton and all his ancestors.    \"We'll all go together,\" I cried before he could speak. \"Why not?\"    Nor was this mere unreasoning or good-natured impulse, since Bob could  scarcely have pressed his suit in my presence, while I should certainly  have done my best to retard it; still, it was rather a relief to me to  see him shake his head with some return of his natural grace.    \"My idea was to show Mrs. Lascelles the gorge,\" said Bob, \"but you can  do that as well as I can; you can't miss it; besides, I've seen it, and  I really ought to stay up here, as a matter of fact, for I'm on the  track of a guide for the Matterhorn.\"    We looked at him narrowly with one accord, but he betrayed no signs of  desperate impulse, only those of \"climbing fever,\" and I at least  breathed again.    \"But if you want a guide,\" said I, \"Zermatt's full of them.\"    \"I know,\" said he, \"but it's a particular swell I'm after, and he hangs  out up here in the season. They expect him back from a big trip any  moment, and I really ought to be on the spot to snap him up.\"    So Bob retired, in very fair order after all, and not without his  laughing apologies to Mrs. Lascelles; but it was sad to me to note the  spurious ring his laugh had now; it was like the death-knell of the  simple and the single heart that it had been my lot, if not my mission,  to poison and to warp. But the less said about my odious task, the  sooner to its fulfilment, which now seemed close at hand.    It was not in fact so imminent as I supposed, for the descent into  Zermatt is somewhat too steep for the conduct of a necessarily delicate  debate. Sound legs go down at a compulsory run, and my companion was  continually waiting for me to catch her up, only to shoot ahead again  perforce. Or the path was too narrow for us to walk abreast, and you  cannot become confidential in single file; or the noise of falling  waters drowned our voices, when we stood together on that precarious  platform in the cool depths of the gorge, otherwise such an admirable  setting for the scene that I foresaw. Then it was a beautiful walk in  itself, with its short tacks in the precipitous pine-woods above, its  sudden plunge into the sunken gorge below, its final sweep across the  green valley beyond; and it was all so new to us both that there were  impressions to exchange or to compare at every turn. In fine, and with  all the will in the world, it was quite impossible to get in a word  about Bob before luncheon at the Monte Rosa, and by that time I for one  was in no mood to introduce so difficult a topic.    But an opportunity there came, an opportunity such as even I could not  neglect; on the contrary, I made too much of it, as the sequel will  show. It was in the little museum which every tourist goes to see. We  had shuddered over the gruesome relics of the first and worst  catastrophe on the Matterhorn, and were looking in silence upon the  primitive portraits of the two younger Englishmen who had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11204"],[0,"Diseases of the Horse's Foot (#12)"],[1,", p. 191. The whole of the matter in this article, from which we have  borrowed Figs. 35 and 36, is too long for reproduction here. It forms,  however, most instructive reading, and its careful perusal will well repay  everyone interested in this most important question (H.C.R.).]    In connection with this it is interesting to note how, all unconsciously,  two separate observers were simultaneously arriving by almost identical  means at an equally satisfactory answer to the question. Prior to the  publication of Lungwitz's article on the subject, Colonel F. Smith, A.V.D.,  had arrived at similar conclusions by working on the same methods.    [Illustration: Fig. 35. I. Electric Bell with Dry Element. a, Under  part, with box, for the dry element; 6, roller for winding up the  conducting-wires; c, dry element, with screw-clamp for attachment of the  conducting-wires; c', conducting-wire leading to the screw-clamp, with  contact-spring in c', Fig. 2, or to the wall in Fig. 3; d, upper part, with  bell; d', conducting-wire to the shoe d' in Figs. 2 and 3; e, strap for  slinging the apparatus around the body of the assistant or rider; f,  connecting-wire between bell and dry element.]    [Illustration: Fig. 35.

Briefly, the method of inquiry  adopted in each case was the 'push and contact principle' of the ordinary  electric bell, and the close attention which was paid to detail will be  sufficiently gathered from Figs. 35 and 36.    [Illustration: Fig. 36. I. LEFT FORE-FOOT SHOD AND MOUNTED TO RECOGNISE THE  SINKING OF THE SOLE. _a_, Iron plate covering the inner half of the horny  sole; _b_, openings in the same, with screw-holes for the reception of the  contact-screw _c_ (the part of the sole under the plate is covered with  tinfoil, which at _d_ passes out under the outer branch of the shoe, and  becomes connected with the tinfoil of the wall; in order to give the  freshly applied tinfoil a better hold, copying-tacks are at _e_ passed  through it into the horn, and one is similarly used to protect the tinfoil  at the place where the contact-screw touches the latter); _f_, holes  with screw thread for the fastening of the angle required to measure the  movement of the wall, and also for the fastening of the conducting-wire,  _g; h_, conducting-wire passing from the tinfoil; _i_, isolated nails.]    [Illustration: Fig. 36. II. BAR-SHOE WITH OPENINGS. _a_, Near the inner  margin and in the longitudinal bar; _b_, for the reception of the  contact-screw _c; d_, openings for fastening the angle and the  conducting-wires.]    After numerous experiments with the depicted contact-screws, moved to the  various positions indicated in the drawings, the following conclusions were  arrived at:    1. BEHAVIOUR OF THE CORONARY EDGE.--During uniform weighting of all four  hoofs the coronary edge shows a tendency to contraction in the anterior and  lateral regions of the hoof, and a tendency to expansion posteriorly. With  heavy weighting of the hoof, which is shown by a backward inclination of  the fetlock, contraction in the anterior and lateral regions is slight, but  the expansion behind, in the region of the heels, is distinct, commencing  gradually in front, becoming stronger, and diminishing again posteriorly.  The coronary edge of the heels becomes slightly bulged outwards. The bulbs  of the heels swell up and incline a little backwards and downwards.    When the fetlock is raised the expansion of the coronary edge of the heels  disappears from behind forwards, passing forwards like a fluid wave. In  the lateral and anterior regions of the coronary edge the contraction  disappears; and when the weight is thrown off the foot it passes into a  gentle expansion of the coronary edge of the toe. During the opposite  movement of the fetlock, that of sinking backwards, this change of form is  executed in the converse manner.    In short, the coronary edge resembles a closed elastic ring, which yields  to pressure, even the most gentle, of the body-weight, in such a way that a  bulging out of any one part is manifested by an inward movement of another  part.    In Fig. 37, _b_, the dotted line represents the changes of form in  comparatively well-formed and sound hoofs at the moment of strongest  over-extension[A] of the fetlock-joint.    [Footnote A: The term 'over-extension,' as employed by Lungwitz, is  intended to indicate that position assumed by the fetlock-joint when the  opposite foot is raised from the ground.]    2. BEHAVIOUR OF THE SOLAR EDGE.--Under the action of the body-weight this  is somewhat different from that of the coronary edge. Anteriorly, and at  the sides, as far as the wall forms an acute angle with the ground,  the tendency to expansion exists, but the change of form first becomes  measurable in the region where the lateral cartilages begin. Quite  posteriorly the expansion again diminishes.    Fig. 37, _a_, by the dotted line represents the expansion at the moment of  over-extension of the fetlock-joint. This expansion is itself rather less  than at the coronary edge, and it shows itself distinctly _only when the  weighted hoof is exposed to a counter-pressure on the sole and frog_, no  matter whether the counter-pressure is produced naturally or artificially.  Thus anything tending to the removal of the pressure from below, such as  a decayed condition of the frog or excessive paring in the forge, will  diminish the extent of expansion of the solar edge.    Contraction of the solar edge of the heels occurs at the moment of greatest  over-extension of the fetlock-joint--that is, in a foot with pressure  from below absent. On the face of it, this appears impossible. Lungwitz,  however, has perfectly demonstrated it; and, when dealing with the  functions of the lateral cartilages in a later paragraph, we shall show  reason for why it is but a simple and natural result of the foot dynamics.    3. BEHAVIOUR OF THE SOLE.--The horny sole becomes flattened under the  action of the body-weight. This is most distinct at the solar branches, and  gradually shades off anteriorly and towards the circumference. As might be  supposed, width of hoof and thickness of the solar horn exert an influence  on the extent of this movement. The sinking of the horny sole is most  marked in flat hoofs.      D. THE FUNCTIONS OF THE LATERAL CARTILAGES.[A]    [Footnote A: Extracted from a paper by J.A. Gilruth, M.R.C.V.S., in the  _Veterinary Record_, vol. v., p. 358.]    We have just referred to contraction of the heels as taking the place of a  normal expansion in those cases where ground frog-pressure was absent. We  shall readily understand this when we bear in mind the anatomy of the  parts concerned, especially that of the plantar cushion. This wedge-shaped  structure we have already described as occupying the irregular space  between the two lateral cartilages, the extremity of the perforans tendon,  and the horny frog.    Now, when weight or pressure is exerted from above on to this organ, and  the _frog is in contact with the ground below_, it is clear from the  position the cushion occupies that, whatever change of form pressure from  above will cause it to take, it must certainly be limited in various  directions.    [Illustration: FIG. 37. _a_, The dotted lines in this diagram represent the  expansion of the solar edge of the hoof at the moment of over-extension of  the fetlock-joint; _b_, the dotted line represents the change in form of  the coronary edge under similar circumstances.]    Because of the shape of the cushion its change of form cannot be forwards  (simultaneous pressure from above and below on to this wedge with its apex  forwards must tend to give it a backward change of form). Because of the  pastern being horizontal, and aiding in the downward pressure, its  change of form cannot be upwards. And because of the ground it cannot be  downwards. It follows, therefore, that the movement must be backwards and  outwards, being especially directed outwards because of its shape and the  median lacuna in its posterior half--this latter, the lacuna, accommodating  as it does the frog-stay, preventing the tendency to backward movement  becoming excessive, and directing the change of form to the sides. Where  the greatest pressure is transmitted, then, is to the inner aspects of the  flexible lateral cartilages. The coronary cushion being continuous with the  plantar, the backward and outward movements of the latter will tend to pull  upon and tighten the former, especially _in front_. This will account for  the contraction noted by Lungwitz in the _anterior half_ of the coronary  edge of the hoof.    Remove the body-weight, and naturally the elastic nature of the lateral  cartilages and the coronary and plantar cushions, with, in a less degree,  that of the hoof, cause things to assume their normal position.    Repeat the weighting of the hoof, in this second case _without  frog-pressure_, and we shall see at once that we have done away with one of  the greatest factors in determining the outward and backward movements of  the plantar cushion--namely, the"]]]
