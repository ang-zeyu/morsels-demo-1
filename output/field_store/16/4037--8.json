A merely impotent  being has to be carried, forever, by others. The fact that dependence is  accompanied by growth in ability, not by an ever increasing lapse into  parasitism, suggests that it is already something constructive. Being  merely sheltered by others would not promote growth. For    (2) it would only build a wall around impotence. With reference to the  physical world, the child is helpless. He lacks at birth and for a  long time thereafter power to make his way physically, to make his own  living. If he had to do that by himself, he would hardly survive an  hour. On this side his helplessness is almost complete. The young of  the brutes are immeasurably his superiors. He is physically weak and not  able to turn the strength which he possesses to coping with the physical  environment.    1. The thoroughgoing character of this helplessness suggests, however,  some compensating power. The relative ability of the young of brute  animals to adapt themselves fairly well to physical conditions from an  early period suggests the fact that their life is not intimately bound  up with the life of those about them. They are compelled, so to speak,  to have physical gifts because they are lacking in social gifts. Human  infants, on the other hand, can get along with physical incapacity just  because of their social capacity. We sometimes talk and think as if they  simply happened to be physically in a social environment; as if social  forces exclusively existed in the adults who take care of them, they  being passive recipients. If it were said that children are themselves  marvelously endowed with power to enlist the cooperative attention of  others, this would be thought to be a backhanded way of saying  that others are marvelously attentive to the needs of children. But  observation shows that children are gifted with an equipment of the  first order for social intercourse. Few grown-up persons retain all  of the flexible and sensitive ability of children to vibrate  sympathetically with the attitudes and doings of those about them.  Inattention to physical things (going with incapacity to control them)  is accompanied by a corresponding intensification of interest and  attention as to the doings of people. The native mechanism of the child  and his impulses all tend to facile social responsiveness. The statement  that children, before adolescence, are egotistically self-centered, even  if it were true, would not contradict the truth of this statement. It  would simply indicate that their social responsiveness is employed on  their own behalf, not that it does not exist. But the statement is not  true as matter of fact. The facts which are cited in support of the  alleged pure egoism of children really show the intensity and directness  with which they go to their mark. If the ends which form the mark seem  narrow and selfish to adults, it is only because adults (by means of a  similar engrossment in their day) have mastered these ends, which  have consequently ceased to interest them. Most of the remainder of  children's alleged native egoism is simply an egoism which runs counter  to an adult's egoism. To a grown-up person who is too absorbed in  his own affairs to take an interest in children's affairs, children  doubtless seem unreasonably engrossed in their own affairs.    From a social standpoint, dependence denotes a power rather than a  weakness; it involves interdependence. There is always a danger that  increased personal independence will decrease the social capacity of  an individual. In making him more self-reliant, it may make him more  self-sufficient; it may lead to aloofness and indifference. It often  makes an individual so insensitive in his relations to others as to  develop an illusion of being really able to stand and act alone--an  unnamed form of insanity which is responsible for a large part of the  remediable suffering of the world.    2. The specific adaptability of an immature creature for growth  constitutes his plasticity. This is something quite different from the  plasticity of putty or wax. It is not a capacity to take on change  of form in accord with external pressure. It lies near the pliable  elasticity by which some persons take on the color of their surroundings  while retaining their own bent. But it is something deeper than this. It  is essentially the ability to learn from experience; the power to retain  from one experience something which is of avail in coping with the  difficulties of a later situation. This means power to modify actions  on the basis of the results of prior experiences, the power to develop  dispositions. Without it, the acquisition of habits is impossible.    It is a familiar fact that the young of the higher animals, and  especially the human young, have to learn to utilize their instinctive  reactions. The human being is born with a greater number of instinctive  tendencies than other animals. But the instincts of the lower animals  perfect themselves for appropriate action at an early period after  birth, while most of those of the human infant are of little account  just as they stand. An original specialized power of adjustment secures  immediate efficiency, but, like a railway ticket, it is good for one  route only. A being who, in order to use his eyes, ears, hands,  and legs, has to experiment in making varied combinations of their  reactions, achieves a control that is flexible and varied. A chick,  for example, pecks accurately at a bit of food in a few hours after  hatching. This means that definite coordinations of activities of the  eyes in seeing and of the body and head in striking are perfected in a  few trials. An infant requires about six months to be able to gauge with  approximate accuracy the action in reaching which will coordinate with  his visual activities; to be able, that is, to tell whether he can reach  a seen object and just how to execute the reaching. As a result, the  chick is limited by the relative perfection of its original endowment.  The infant has the advantage of the multitude of instinctive tentative  reactions and of the experiences that accompany them, even though he is  at a temporary disadvantage because they cross one another. In learning  an action, instead of having it given ready-made, one of necessity  learns to vary its factors, to make varied combinations of them,  according to change of circumstances. A possibility of continuing  progress is opened up by the fact that in learning one act, methods are  developed good for use in other situations. Still more important is the  fact that the human being acquires a habit of learning. He learns to  learn.    The importance for human life of the two facts of dependence and  variable control has been summed up in the doctrine of the significance  of prolonged infancy. 1 This prolongation is significant from the  standpoint of the adult members of the group as well as from that of the  young. The presence of dependent and learning beings is a stimulus to  nurture and affection. The need for constant continued care was probably  a chief means in transforming temporary cohabitations into permanent  unions. It certainly was a chief influence in forming habits of  affectionate and sympathetic watchfulness; that constructive interest  in the well-being of others which is essential to associated life.  Intellectually, this moral development meant the introduction of many  new objects of attention; it stimulated foresight and planning for the  future. Thus there is a reciprocal influence. Increasing complexity of  social life requires a longer period of infancy in which to acquire the  needed powers; this prolongation of dependence means prolongation of  plasticity, or power of acquiring variable and novel modes of control.  Hence it provides a further push to social progress.    2. Habits as Expressions of Growth. We have already noted that  plasticity is the capacity to retain and carry over from prior  experience factors which modify subsequent activities. This signifies  the capacity to acquire habits, or develop definite dispositions. We  have now to consider the salient features of habits. In the first place,  a habit is a form of executive skill, of efficiency in doing. A habit  means an ability to use natural conditions as means to ends. It is  an active control of the environment through control of the organs of  action. We are perhaps apt to emphasize the control of the body at the  expense of control of the environment. We think of walking, talking,  playing the piano, the specialized skills characteristic of the etcher,  the surgeon, the bridge-builder, as if they were simply ease, deftness,  and accuracy on the part of the organism. They are that, of course; but  the measure of the value of these qualities lies in the economical and  effective control of the environment which they secure. To be able to  walk is to have certain properties of nature at our disposal--and so  with all other habits.    Education is not infrequently defined as consisting in the acquisition  of those habits that effect an adjustment of an individual and his  environment. The definition expresses an essential phase of growth. But  it is essential that adjustment be understood in its active sense of  control of means for achieving ends. If we think of a habit simply as  a change wrought in the organism, ignoring the fact that this change  consists in ability to effect subsequent changes in the environment, we  shall be led to think of \"adjustment\" as a conformity to environment as  wax conforms to the seal which impresses it. The environment is thought  of as something fixed, providing in its fixity the end and standard  of changes taking place in the organism; adjustment is just fitting  ourselves to this fixity of external conditions. 2 Habit as  habituation is indeed something relatively passive; we get used to our  surroundings--to our"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8537"],[0,"Lonesome Land (#11)"],[1,"--\" He  searched his brain for a simile, and failed to find one. \"'I have been  helping Manley, Mr. Polycarp Jenks,' she says to me, 'and I flatter myself  I have done as well as any _man_ could do.'

Dressed jest like a city girl, by granny! with ruffles on her  skirts--to ketch afire if she wasn't mighty keerful!--and a big straw hat  tied down with a veil, and kid gloves on her hands, and her yeller  hair kinda fallin' around her face--and them yeller eyes snappin' like  flames--by granny! if she didn't make as purty a picture as I ever want  to set eyes on! Slim and straight, jest like a storybook woman--_he-he!_  'Course, she was all smoke an' dirt; a big flake of burned grass was on her  hair, I took notice, and them ruffles was black up to her knees--_he-he!_  And she had a big smut on her cheek--but she was right there with her stack  of blues, by granny! Settin' into the game like a--a--\" He leaned and  spat \"But burnin' guards ain't no work for a woman to do, an' I told Man  so--straight out. 'You git help,' I says.

And, by granny! if that there wife of Man's didn't up an' hit me  another biff--_he-he!_    \"'Thank you very much,' she says to me, like ice water.

'But don't insiniwate I'm not as  good a fighter as any man who ever breathed,' she says. 'Manley has another  of his headaches to-day--going to town always gives him a sick headache,'  she says, 'and I've done nearly all of this my own, lone self,' she says.  'And I'm horribly proud of it, and I'll never forgive you for saying I--'  And then, by granny! if she didn't begin to blink them eyes, and I felt  like a--a--\" He put the usual period to his hesitation.    \"Between you an' _me_, Kenneth,\" he added, looking at Kent slyly, \"she  ain't having none too easy a time. Man's gone back to drinkin'--I knowed  all the time he wouldn't stay braced up very long--lasted about six weeks,  from all I c'n hear. Mebbe she reely thinks it's jest headaches ails him  when he comes back from town--I dunno. You can't never tell what idees a  woman's got tacked away under her hair--from all I c'n gether. I don't  p'tend to know nothing about 'em--don't want to know--_he-he!_ But I  guess,\" he hinted cunningly, \"I know as much about 'em as you do--hey,  Kenneth? You don't seem to chase after 'em none, yourself--_he-he!_\"    \"Whereabouts did Man run his guards?\" asked Kent, passing over the  invitation to personal confessions.    Polycarp gave a grunt of disdain. \"Just on the west rim of his coulee.  About forty rod of six-foot guard, and slanted so it'll shoot a fire right  into high grass at the head of the coulee and send it kitin' over this way.  That's supposin' it turns a fire, which it won't. Six feet--a fall like  this here! Why, I never see grass so thick on this range--did you?\"    \"I wonder, did he burn that extra guard?\" Kent was keeping himself rigidly  to the subject of real importance.    \"No, by granny! he didn't--not unless he done it since yest'day. He went  to town for suthin, and he might' nigh forgot to go home--_he-he!_ He was  there yest'day about three o'clock, an' I says to him--\"    \"Well, so-long; I got to, be moving.\" Kent gathered up the reins and went  his way, leaving Polycarp just in the act of drawing his \"plug\" from his  pocket, by his usual laborious method, in mental preparation for another  half hour of talk.    \"If you're ridin' over that way, Kenneth, you better take a look at Man's  guard,\" he called after him. \"A good mile of guard, along there, would  help a lot if a fire got started beyond. The way he fixed it, it ain't no  account at all.\"    Kent proved by a gesture that he heard him, and rode on without turning to  look back. Already his form was blurred as Polycarp gazed after him, and  in another minute or two he was blotted out completely by the smoke veil,  though he rode upon the level. Polycarp watched him craftily, though there  was no need, until he was completely hidden, then he went on, ruminating  upon the faults of his acquaintances.    Kent had no intention of riding over to Cold Spring. He had not been there  since Manley's marriage, though he had been a frequent visitor before, and  unless necessity drove him there, it would be long before he faced again  the antagonism of Mrs. Fleetwood. Still, he was mentally uncomfortable, and  he felt much resentment against Polycarp Jenks because he had caused that  discomfort. What was it to him, if Manley had gone bock to drinking? He  asked the question more than once, and he answered always that it was  nothing to him, of course. Still, he wished futilely that he had not been  quite so eager to cover up Manley's weakness and deceive the girl. He ought  to have given her a chance--    A cinder like a huge black snowflake struck him suddenly upon the cheek. He  looked up, startled, and tried to see farther into the haze which closed  him round. It seemed to him, now that his mind was turned from his musings,  that the smoke was thicker, the smell of burning grass stronger, and the  breath of wind hotter upon his face. He turned, looked away to the west,  fancied there a tumbled blackness new to his sight, and put his horse to a  run. If there were fire close, then every second counted; and as he raced  over the uneven prairie he fumbled with the saddle string that held a  sodden sack tied fast to the saddle, that he might lose no time.    The cinders grew thicker, until the air was filled with them, like a  snowstorm done in India ink. A little farther and he heard a faint  crackling; topped a ridge and saw not far ahead, a dancing, yellow line.  His horse was breathing heavily with the pace he was keeping, but Kent,  swinging away from the onrush of flame and heat, spurred him to a greater  speed. They neared the end of the crackling, red line, and as Kent swung in  behind it upon the burned ground, he saw several men beating steadily at  the flames.    He was hardly at work when Polycarp came running up and took his place  beside him; but beyond that Kent paid no attention to the others, though he  heard and recognized the voice of Fred De Garmo calling out to some one.  The smoke which rolled up in uneven volumes as the wind lifted it and bore  it away, or let it suck backward as it veered for an instant, blinded him  while he fought. He heard other men gallop up, and after a little some one  clattered up with a wagon filled with barrels of water. He ran to wet  his sack, and saw that it was Blumenthall himself, foreman of the Double  Diamond, who drove the team.    \"Lucky it ain't as windy as it was yesterday and the day before,\"  Blumenthall cried out, as Kent stepped upon the brake block to reach a  barrel. \"It'd sweep the whole country if it was.\"    Kent nodded, and ran back to the fire, trailing the dripping sack after  him. As he passed Polycarp and another, he heard Polycarp saying something  about Man Fleetwood's fire guard; but he did not stop to hear what it was.  Polycarp was always talking, and he didn't always keep too closely to  facts.    Then, of a sudden, he saw men dimly when he glanced down the leaping fire  line, and he knew that the fire was almost conquered. Another frenzied  minute or two, and he was standing in a group of men, who dropped their  charred, blackened fragments of blanket and bags, and began to feel for  their smoking material, while they stamped upon stray embers which looked  live enough to be dangerous.    \"Well, she's out,\" said a voice, \"But it did look for a while as if it'd  get away in spite of us.\"    Kent turned away, wiping an eye which held a cinder fast under the lid. It  was Fred De Garmo who spoke.    \"If somebody'd been watchin' the railroad a leetle might closer--\" Polycarp  began, in his thin, rasping voice.    Fred cut him short. \"I thought you laid it to Man Fleetwood, burning fire  guards,\" he retorted. \"Keep on, and you'll get it right pretty soon. This  never come from the railroad; you can gamble on that.\"    Blumenthall had left his team and come among them. \"If you want to know how  it started, I can tell you. Somebody dropped a match, or a cigarette, or  something, by the trail up here a ways. I saw where it started when I went  to Cold Spring after the last load of water. And if I knew who it was--\"    Polycarp launched his opinion first, as usual. \"Well, I don't _know_ who  done it--but, by granny! I can might' nigh guess who it was. There's jest  one man that I know of been traveling that trail lately when he wa'n't in  his sober senses--\"    Here Manley Fleetwood rode up to them, coughing at the soot his horse  kicked up. \"Say! you fellows come on over to the house and have something  to eat--and,\" he added significantly, \"something _wet_. I told my wife,  when I saw the fire, to make plenty of coffee, for fighting fire's hungry  work, let me tell. Come on--no hanging back, you know. There'll be lots of  coffee, and I've got a quart of something better cached in the haystack!\"    As he had said, fighting fire is hungry work, and none save Blumenthall,  who was dyspeptic and only ate twice a day, and then of certain foods  prepared by himself, declined the invitation.
