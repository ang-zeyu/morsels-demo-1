That the 'Calamus' part has ever      allowed the possibility of such construction as mentioned is      terrible. I am fain to hope that the pages themselves are not to      be even mentioned for such gratuitous and quite at the time      undreamed and unwished possibility of morbid inferences--which      are disavowed by me and seem damnable.\"    It would seem from this letter[96] that Whitman had never realized that  there is any relationship whatever between the passionate emotion of  physical contact from man to man, as he had experienced it and sung it,  and the act which with other people he would regard as a crime against  nature. This may be singular, for there are many inverted persons who have  found satisfaction in friendships less physical and passionate than those  described in _Leaves of Grass_, but Whitman was a man of concrete,  emotional, instinctive temperament, lacking in analytical power, receptive  to all influences, and careless of harmonizing them. He would most  certainly have refused to admit that he was the subject of inverted  sexuality. It remains true, however, that \"manly love\" occupies in his  work a predominance which it would scarcely hold in the feelings of the  \"average man,\" whom Whitman wishes to honor. A normally constituted  person, having assumed the very frank attitude taken up by Whitman, would  be impelled to devote far more space and far more ardor to the subject of  sexual relationships with women and all that is involved in maternity than  is accorded to them in _Leaves of Grass_. Some of Whitman's extant letters  to young men, though they do not throw definite light on this question,  are of a very affectionate character,[97] and, although a man of  remarkable physical vigor, he never felt inclined to marry.[98] It remains  somewhat difficult to classify him from the sexual point of view, but we  can scarcely fail to recognize the presence of a homosexual tendency.        I should add that some friends and admirers of Whitman are not      prepared to accept the evidence of the letter to Symonds. I am      indebted to \"Q.\" for the following statement of the objections:--        \"I think myself that it is a mistake to give much weight to this      letter--perhaps a mistake to introduce it at all, since if      introduced it will, of course, carry weight. And this for three      or four reasons:--        \"1. That it is difficult to reconcile the letter itself (with its      strong tone of disapprobation) with the general 'atmosphere' of      _Leaves of Grass_, the tenor of which is to leave everything open      and free.        \"2. That the letter is in hopeless conflict with the 'Calamus'      section of poems. For, whatever moral lines Whitman may have      drawn at the time of writing these poems, it seems to me quite      incredible that the possibility of certain inferences, morbid or      other, was undreamed of.        \"3. That the letter was written only a few months before his last      illness and death, and is the only expression of the kind that he      appears to have given utterance to.        \"4. That Symonds's letter, to which this was a reply, is not      forth coming; and we consequently do not know what rash      expressions it may have contained--leading Whitman (with his      extreme caution) to hedge his name from possible use to justify      dubious practices.\"        I may add that I endeavored to obtain Symonds's letter, but he      was unable to produce it, nor has any copy of it been found among      his papers.        It should be said that Whitman's attitude toward Symonds was      marked by high regard and admiration. \"A wonderful man is      Addington Symonds,\" he remarked shortly before his own death;      \"some ways the most indicative and penetrating and significant      man of our time. Symonds is a curious fellow; I love him dearly.      He is of college breed and education, horribly literary and      suspicious, and enjoys things. A great fellow for delving into      persons and into the concrete, and even into the physiological      and the gastric, and wonderfully cute.\" But on this occasion he      delved in vain.        The foregoing remarks (substantially contained in the previous      editions of this book) were based mainly on the information      received from J.A. Symonds's side. But of more recent years      interesting light has been thrown on this remarkable letter from      Walt Whitman's side. The Boswellian patience, enthusiasm, and      skill which Horace Traubel has brought to his full and elaborate      work, now in course of publication, _With Walt Whitman in      Camden_, clearly reveal, in the course of various conversations,      Whitman's attitude to Symonds's question and the state of mind      which led up to this letter.        Whitman talked to Traubel much about Symonds from the      twenty-seventh of April, 1888 (very soon after the date when      Traubel's work begins), onward. Symonds had written to him      repeatedly, it seems, concerning the \"passional relations of men      with men,\" as Whitman expressed it. \"He is always driving at me      about that: is that what Calamus means?--because of me or in      spite of me, is that what it means? I have said no, but no does      not satisfy him. [There is, however, no record from Symonds's      side of any letter by Whitman to Symonds in this sense up to this      date.] But read this letter--read the whole of it: it is very      shrewd, very cute, in deadliest earnest: it drives me hard,      almost compels me--it is urgent, persistent: he sort of stands in      the road and says 'I won't move till you answer my question.' You      see, this is an old letter--sixteen years old--and he is still      asking the question: he refers to it in one of his latest notes.      He is surely a wonderful man--a rare, cleaned-up man--a      white-souled, heroic character.... You will be writing something      about Calamus some day,\" said W. [to Traubel], \"and this letter,      and what I say, may help to clear your ideas. Calamus needs clear      ideas; it may be easily, innocently distorted from its natural,      its motive, body of doctrine.\"        The letter, dated Feb. 7, 1872, of some length, is then      reproduced. It tells how much _Leaves of Grass_, and especially      the Calamus section, had helped the writer. \"What the love of man      for man has been in the past,\" Symonds wrote, \"I think I know.      What it is here now, I know also--alas! What you say it can and      should be I dimly discern in your Poems. But this hardly      satisfies me--so desirous am I of learning what you teach. Some      day, perhaps,--in some form, I know not what, but in your own      chosen form,--you will tell me more about the Love of Friends.      Till then I wait.\"        \"Said W: 'Well, what do you think of that? Do you think that      could be answered?' 'I don't see why you call that letter driving      you hard. It's quiet enough--it only asks questions, and asks the      questions mildly enough,' 'I suppose you are right--\"drive\" is      not exactly the word: yet you know how I hate to be catechised.      Symonds is right, no doubt, to ask the questions: I am just as      much right if I do not answer them: just as much right if I do      answer them. I often say to myself about Calamus--perhaps it      means more or less than what I thought myself--means different:      perhaps I don't know what it all means--perhaps never did know.      My first instinct about all that Symonds writes is violently      reactionary--is strong and brutal for no, no, no. Then the      thought intervenes that I maybe do not know all my own meanings:      I say to myself: \"You, too, go away, come back, study your own      book--as alien or stranger, study your own book, see what it      amounts to.\" Some time or other I will have to write to him      definitely about Calamus--give him my word for it what I meant or      mean it to mean.'\"        Again, a month later (May 24, 1888), Whitman speaks to Traubel of      a \"beautiful letter\" from Symonds. \"You will see that he harps on      the Calamus poems again. I don't see why it should, but his      recurrence to that subject irritates me a little. I suppose you      might say--why don't you shut him up by answering him? There is      no logical answer to that I suppose: but I may ask in my turn:      'What right has he to ask questions anyway?'\" W. laughed a bit.      \"Anyway the question comes back to me almost every time he      writes. He is courteous enough about it--that is the reason I do      not resent him. I suppose the whole thing will end in an answer      some day.\"        The letter follows. The chief point in it is that the writer      hopes he has not been importunate in the question he had asked      about Calamus three years before.        \"I [Traubel] said to W.: 'That's a humble letter enough: I don't      see anything in that to get excited about. He doesn't ask you to      answer the old question. In fact he rather apologizes for having      asked it.' W. fired up 'Who is excited? As to that question, he      does ask it again and again: asks it, asks it, asks it.' I      laughed at his vehemence. 'Well, suppose he does? It does not      harm. Besides, you've got nothing to hide. I think your silence      might lead him to suppose there was a nigger in your wood pile.'      'Oh, nonsense! But for thirty years my enemies and friends have      been asking me questions about the _Leaves_: I'm tired of not      answering questions.' It was very funny to see his face when he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13612"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 3 (#12)"],[1," dipping      their bills in quick succession to right and left. He knows what      that means, and carries himself with even greater dignity than      before. In the end, however, he must give in. As a last appeal,      one of his lady lovers may coyly lower herself in the water till      only the top of her back, head, and neck is seen, and so      fascinating an advance as this no drake of any sensibility can      withstand.\"        The courting of the Argus pheasant, noted for the extreme beauty      of the male's plumage, was observed by H.O. Forbes in Sumatra. It      is the habit of this bird to make \"a large circus, some ten or      twelve feet in diameter, in the forest, which it clears of every      leaf and twig and branch, till the ground is perfectly swept and      garnished. On the margin of this circus there is invariably a      projecting branch or high-arched root, at a few feet elevation      above the ground, on which the female bird takes its place, while      in the ring the male--the male birds alone possess great      decoration--shows off all its magnificence for the gratification      and pleasure of his consort and to exalt himself in her eyes.\"      (H.O. Forbes, _A. Naturalist's Wanderings_, 1885, p. 131.)        \"All ostriches, adults as well as chicks, have a strange habit      known as 'waltzing.' After running for a few hundred yards they      will also stop, and, with raised wings, spin around rapidly for      some time after until quite giddy, when a broken leg occasionally      occurs.... Vicious cocks 'roll' when challenging to fight or when      wooing the hen. The cock will suddenly bump down on to his knees      (the ankle-joint), open his wings, and then swing them      alternately backward and forward, as if on a pivot.... While      rolling, every feather over the whole body is on end, and the      plumes are open, like a large white fan. At such a time the bird      sees very imperfectly, if at all; in fact, he seems so      preoccupied that, if pursued, one may often approach unnoticed.      Just before rolling, a cock, especially if courting the hen, will      often run slowly and daintily on the points of his toes, with      neck slightly inflated, upright, and rigid, the tail      half-drooped, and all his body-feathers fluffed up; the wings      raised and expanded, the inside edges touching the sides of the      neck for nearly the whole of its length, and the plumes showing      separately, like an open fan. In no other attitude is the      splendid beauty of his plumage displayed to such advantage.\"      (S.C. Cronwright Schreiner, \"The Ostrich,\" _Zooelogist_, March,      1897.)        As may be seen from the foregoing fairly typical examples, the      phenomena of courtship are highly developed, and have been most      carefully studied, in animals outside the mammal series. It may      seem a long leap from birds to man; yet, as will be seen, the      phenomena among primitive human peoples, if not, indeed, among      many civilized peoples also, closely resemble those found among      birds, though, unfortunately, they have not usually been so      carefully studied.        In Australia, where dancing is carried to a high pitch of      elaboration, its association with the sexual impulse is close and      unmistakable. Thus, Mr. Samuel Gason (of whom it has been said      that \"no man living has been more among blacks or knows more of      their ways\") remarks concerning a dance of the Dieyerie tribe:      \"This dance men and women only take part in, in regular form and      position, keeping splendid time to the rattle of the beat of two      boomerangs; some of the women keep time by clapping their hands      between their thighs; promiscuous sexual intercourse follows      after the dance; jealousy is forbidden.\" Again, at the Mobierrie,      or rat-harvest, \"many weeks' preparation before the dance comes      off; no quarreling is allowed; promiscuous sexual intercourse      during the ceremony.\" The fact that jealousy is forbidden at      these festivals clearly indicates that sexual intercourse is a      recognized and probably essential element in the ceremonies. This      is further emphasized by the fact that at other festivals open      sexual intercourse is not allowed. Thus, at the Mindarie, or      dance at a peace festival (when a number of tribes comes      together), \"there is great rejoicing at the coming festival,      which is generally held at the full of the moon, and kept up all      night. The men are artistically decorated with down and feathers,      with all kinds of designs. The down and feathers are stuck on      their bodies with blood freshly taken from their penis; they are      also nicely painted with various colors; tufts of boughs are tied      on their ankles to make a noise while dancing. Promiscuous sexual      intercourse is carried on _secretly_; many quarrels occur at this      time.\" (_Journal of the Anthropological Institute_, vol. xxiv,      November, 1894, p. 174.)        In Australian dances, sometimes men and women dance together,      sometimes the men dance alone, sometimes the women. In one dance      described by Eyre: \"Women are the chief performers; their bodies      are painted with white streaks, and their hair adorned with      cockatoo feathers. They carry large sticks in their hands, and      place themselves in a row in front, while the men with their      spears stand in a row behind them. They then all commence their      movements, but without intermingling, the males and females      dancing by themselves. The women have occasionally another mode      of dancing, by joining the hands together over the head, closing      the feet, and bringing the knees into contact. The legs are then      thrown outward from the knee, while the feet and hands are kept      in their original position, and, being drawn quickly in again, a      sharp sound is produced by the collision. This is also practised      alone by young girls or by several together for their own      amusement. It is adopted also when a single woman is placed in      front of a row of male dancers to excite their passions.\" (E.J.      Eyre, _Journals of Expeditions into Central Australia_, vol. ii,      p. 235.)        A charming Australian folk-tale concerning two sisters with      wings, who disliked men, and their wooing by a man, clearly      indicates, even among the Australians (whose love-making is      commonly supposed to be somewhat brutal in character), the      consciousness that it is by his beauty, charm, and skill in      courtship that a man wins a woman. Unahanach, the lover, stole      unperceived to the river where the girls were bathing and at last      showed himself carelessly sitting on a high tree. The girls were      startled, but thought it would be safe to amuse themselves by      looking at the intruder. \"Young and with the most active figure,      yet of a strength that defied the strongest emu, and even enabled      him to resist an 'old man' kangaroo, he had no equal in the      chase, and conscious power gave a dignity to his expression that      at one glance calmed the fears of the two girls. His large      brilliant eyes, shaded by a deep fringe of soft black eyelashes,      gazed down upon them admiringly, and his rich black hair hung      around his well-formed face, smooth and shining from the emu-oil      with which it was abundantly covered.\" At last he persuaded them      to talk and by and by induced them to call him husband. Then they      went off with him, with no thought of flight in their hearts.      (\"Australian Folklore Stories,\" collected by W. Dunlop, _Journal      of the Anthropological Institute_, new series, vol. i, 1898, p.      33.)        Of the people of Torres Straits Haddon states (_Reports      Anthropological Expedition to Torres Straits_, vol. v, p. 222):      \"It was during the secular dance, or _Kap_, that the girls      usually lost their hearts to the young men. A young man who was a      good dancer would find favor in the sight of the girls. This can      be readily understood by anyone who has seen the active, skilful,      and fatiguing dances of these people. A young man who could      acquit himself well in these dances must be possessed of no mean      strength and agility, qualities which everywhere appeal to the      opposite sex. Further, he was decorated, according to local      custom, with all that would render him more imposing in the eyes      of the spectators. As the former chief of Mabuiag put it, 'In      England if a man has plenty of money, women want to marry him; so      here, if a man dances well they too want him.' In olden days the      war-dance, which was performed after a successful foray, would be      the most powerful excitement to a marriageable girl, especially      if a young man had distinguished himself sufficiently to bring      home the head of someone he had killed.\"        Among the tribes inhabiting the mouth of the Wanigela River, New      Guinea, \"when a boy admires a girl, he will not look at her,      speak to her, or go near her. He, however, shows his love by      athletic bounds, posing, and pursuit, and by the spearing of      imaginary enemies, etc., before her, to attract her attention. If      the girl reciprocates his love she will employ a small girl to      give to him an _ugauga gauna_, or love invitation, consisting of      an areca-nut whose skin has been marked with different designs,      significant of her wish to _ugauga_. After dark he is apprised of      the place where the girl awaits him; repairing thither, he seats      himself beside her as close as possible, and they mutually share      in the consumption of the betel-nut.\" This constitutes betrothal;      henceforth he is free to visit the girl's house and sleep there.      Marriages usually take place at the most important festival of      the year,"]]]
