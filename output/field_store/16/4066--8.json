Our throats and stomachs are lined with solid gold, and  we find the thistles nourishing and good to eat.  As a matter of fact,  there is nothing else in our country that is fit for food.  All around  the City of Thi grow countless thistles, and all we need do is to go  and gather them.  If we wanted anything else to eat, we would have to  plant it, and grow it, and harvest it, and that would be a lot of  trouble and make us work, which is an occupation we detest.\"    \"But tell me, please,\" said the Wizard, \"how does it happen that your  city jumps around so, from one part of the country to another?\"    \"The city doesn't jump.  It doesn't move at all,\" declared the High  Coco-Lorum.  \"However, I will admit that the land that surrounds it has  a trick of turning this way or that, and so if one is standing upon the  plain and facing north, he is likely to find himself suddenly facing  west or east or south.  But once you reach the thistle fields, you are  on solid ground.\"    \"Ah, I begin to understand,\" said the Wizard, nodding his head.  \"But I  have another question to ask: How does it happen that the Thists have  no King to rule over them?\"    \"Hush!\" whispered the High Coco-Lorum, looking uneasily around to make  sure they were not overheard.  \"In reality, I am the King, but the  people don't know it.  They think they rule themselves, but the fact is  I have everything my own way.  No one else knows anything about our  laws, and so I make the laws to suit myself.  If any oppose me or  question my acts, I tell them it's the law and that settles it.  If I  called myself King, however, and wore a crown and lived in royal style,  the people would not like me and might do me harm.  As the High  Coco-Lorum of Thi, I am considered a very agreeable person.\"    \"It seems a very clever arrangement,\" said the Wizard.  \"And now, as  you are the principal person in Thi, I beg you to tell us if the Royal  Ozma is a captive in your city.\"    \"No,\" answered the diamond-headed man.  \"We have no captives.  No  strangers but yourselves are here, and we have never before heard of  the Royal Ozma.\"    \"She rules over all of Oz,\" said Dorothy, \"and so she rules your city  and you, because you are in the Winkie Country, which is a part of the  Land of Oz.\"    \"It may be,\" returned the High Coco-Lorum, \"for we do not study  geography and have never inquired whether we live in the Land of Oz or  not.  And any Ruler who rules us from a distance and unknown to us is  welcome to the job.  But what has happened to your Royal Ozma?\"    \"Someone has stolen her,\" said the Wizard.  \"Do you happen to have any  talented magician among your people, one who is especially clever, you  know?\"    \"No, none especially clever.  We do some magic, of course, but it is  all of the ordinary kind.  I do not think any of us has yet aspired to  stealing Rulers, either by magic or otherwise.\"    \"Then we've come a long way for nothing!\" exclaimed Trot regretfully.    \"But we are going farther than this,\" asserted the Patchwork Girl,  bending her stuffed body backward until her yarn hair touched the floor  and then walking around on her hands with her feet in the air.    The High Coco-Lorum watched Scraps admiringly.    \"You may go farther on, of course,\" said he, \"but I advise you not to.  The Herkus live back of us, beyond the thistles and the twisting lands,  and they are not very nice people to meet, I assure you.\"    \"Are they giants?\" asked Betsy.    \"They are worse than that,\" was the reply. \"They have giants for their  slaves and they are so much stronger than giants that the poor slaves  dare not rebel for fear of being torn to pieces.\"    \"How do you know?\" asked Scraps.    \"Everyone says so,\" answered the High Coco-Lorum.    \"Have you seen the Herkus yourself?\" inquired Dorothy.    \"No, but what everyone says must be true, otherwise what would be the  use of their saying it?\"    \"We were told before we got here that you people hitch dragons to your  chariots,\" said the little girl.    \"So we do,\" declared the High Coco-Lorum. \"And that reminds me that I  ought to entertain you as strangers and my guests by taking you for a  ride around our splendid City of Thi.\"  He touched a button, and a band  began to play.  At least, they heard the music of a band, but couldn't  tell where it came from.  \"That tune is the order to my charioteer to  bring around my dragon-chariot,\" said the High Coco-Lorum.  \"Every time  I give an order, it is in music, which is a much more pleasant way to  address servants than in cold, stern words.\"    \"Does this dragon of yours bite?\" asked Button-Bright.    \"Mercy no!  Do you think I'd risk the safety of my innocent people by  using a biting dragon to draw my chariot?  I'm proud to say that my  dragon is harmless, unless his steering gear breaks, and he was  manufactured at the famous dragon factory in this City of Thi.  Here he  comes, and you may examine him for yourselves.\"    They heard a low rumble and a shrill squeaking sound, and going out to  the front of the house, they saw coming around the corner a car drawn  by a gorgeous jeweled dragon, which moved its head to right and left  and flashed its eyes like headlights of an automobile and uttered a  growling noise as it slowly moved toward them.  When it stopped before  the High Coco-Lorum's house, Toto barked sharply at the sprawling  beast, but even tiny Trot could see that the dragon was not alive. Its  scales were of gold, and each one was set with sparkling jewels, while  it walked in such a stiff, regular manner that it could be nothing else  than a machine.  The chariot that trailed behind it was likewise of  gold and jewels, and when they entered it, they found there were no  seats.  Everyone was supposed to stand up while riding. The charioteer  was a little, diamond-headed fellow who straddled the neck of the  dragon and moved the levers that made it go.    \"This,\" said the High Coco-Lorum pompously, \"is a wonderful invention.  We are all very proud of our auto-dragons, many of which are in use by  our wealthy inhabitants.  Start the thing going, charioteer!\"    The charioteer did not move.    \"You forgot to order him in music,\" suggested Dorothy.    \"Ah, so I did.\"    He touched a button and a music box in the dragon's head began to play  a tune.  At once the little charioteer pulled over a lever, and the  dragon began to move, very slowly and groaning dismally as it drew the  clumsy chariot after it.  Toto trotted between the wheels.  The  Sawhorse, the Mule, the Lion and the Woozy followed after and had no  trouble in keeping up with the machine.  Indeed, they had to go slow to  keep from running into it.  When the wheels turned, another music box  concealed somewhere under the chariot played a lively march tune which  was in striking contrast with the dragging movement of the strange  vehicle, and Button-Bright decided that the music he had heard when  they first sighted this city was nothing else than a chariot plodding  its weary way through the streets.    All the travelers from the Emerald City thought this ride the most  uninteresting and dreary they had ever experienced, but the High  Coco-Lorum seemed to think it was grand.  He pointed out the different  buildings and parks and fountains in much the same way that the  conductor does on an American \"sightseeing wagon\" does, and being  guests they were obliged to submit to the ordeal.  But they became a  little worried when their host told them he had ordered a banquet  prepared for them in the City Hall.    \"What are we going to eat?\" asked Button-Bright suspiciously.    \"Thistles,\" was the reply.  \"Fine, fresh thistles, gathered this very  day.\"    Scraps laughed, for she never ate anything, but Dorothy said in a  protesting voice, \"OUR insides are not lined with gold, you know.\"    \"How sad!\" exclaimed the High Coco-Lorum, and then he added as an  afterthought, \"but we can have the thistles boiled, if you prefer.\"    \"I'm 'fraid they wouldn't taste good even then,\" said little Trot.  \"Haven't you anything else to eat?\"    The High Coco-Lorum shook his diamond-shaped head.    \"Nothing that I know of,\" said he.  \"But why should we have anything  else when we have so many thistles?  However, if you can't eat what we  eat, don't eat anything.  We shall not be offended, and the banquet  will be just as merry and delightful.\"    Knowing his companions were all hungry, the Wizard said, \"I trust you  will excuse us from the banquet, sir, which will be merry enough  without us, although it is given in our honor.  For, as Ozma is not in  your city, we must leave here at once and seek her elsewhere.\"    \"Sure we must!\" Dorothy, and she whispered to Betsy and Trot, \"I'd  rather starve somewhere else than in this city, and who knows, we may  run across somebody who eats reg'lar food and will give us some.\"    So when the ride was finished, in spite of the protests of the High  Coco-Lorum, they insisted on continuing their journey.  \"It will soon  be dark,\" he objected.    \"We don't mind the darkness,\" replied the Wizard.    \"Some wandering Herku may get you.\"    \"Do you think the Herkus would hurt us?\" asked Dorothy.    \"I cannot say, not having had the honor of their acquaintance.  But  they are said to be so strong that if they had any other place to stand  upon they could lift the world.\"    \"All of them together?\" asked Button-Bright wonderingly.    \"Any one of them could do it,\" said the High Coco-Lorum.    \"Have you heard of any magicians being among them?\" asked the Wizard,  knowing that only a magician could have stolen Ozma in the way she had  been stolen.    \"I am told it is quite a magical country,\" declared the High  Coco-Lorum, \"and magic is usually performed by magicians.  But I have  never heard that they have any invention or sorcery to equal our  wonderful auto-dragons.\"    They thanked him"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/960"],[0,"The Tin Woodman of Oz (#11)"],[1,"the eyes.    Woot saw that the creatures had wide mouths and rows of terrible teeth  and, from tales he had heard of such beings, he knew he had fallen into  a cavern inhabited by the great Dragons that had been driven from the  surface of the earth and were only allowed to come out once in a  hundred years to search for food. Of course he had never seen Dragons  before, yet there was no mistaking them, for they were unlike any other  living creatures.    Woot sat upon the floor where he had fallen, staring around, and the  owners of the big eyes returned his look, silently and motionless.  Finally one of the Dragons which was farthest away from him asked, in a  deep, grave voice:    \"What was that?\"    And the greatest Dragon of all, who was just in front of the Green  Monkey, answered in a still deeper voice:    \"It is some foolish animal from Outside.\"    \"Is it good to eat?\" inquired a smaller Dragon beside the great one.  \"I'm hungry.\"    \"Hungry!\" exclaimed all the Dragons, in a reproachful chorus; and then  the great one said chidingly: \"Tut-tut, my son! You've no reason to be  hungry at this time.\"    \"Why not?\" asked the little Dragon. \"I haven't eaten anything in eleven  years.\"    \"Eleven years is nothing,\" remarked another Dragon, sleepily opening  and closing his eyes; \"I haven't feasted for eighty-seven years, and I  dare not get hungry for a dozen or so years to come. Children who eat  between meals should be broken of the habit.\"    \"All I had, eleven years ago, was a rhinoceros, and that's not a full  meal at all,\" grumbled the young one. \"And, before that, I had waited  sixty-two years to be fed; so it's no wonder I'm hungry.\"    \"How old are you now?\" asked Woot, forgetting his own dangerous  position in his interest in the conversation.    \"Why, I'm--I'm--How old am I, Father?\" asked the little Dragon.    \"Goodness gracious! what a child to ask questions. Do you want to keep  me thinking all the time? Don't you know that thinking is very bad for  Dragons?\" returned the big one, impatiently.    \"How old am I, Father?\" persisted the small Dragon.    \"About six hundred and thirty, I believe. Ask your mother.\"    \"No; don't!\" said an old Dragon in the background; \"haven't I enough  worries, what with being wakened in the middle of a nap, without being  obliged to keep track of my children's ages?\"    \"You've been fast asleep for over sixty years, Mother,\" said the child  Dragon. \"How long a nap do you wish?\"    \"I should have slept forty years longer. And this strange little green  beast should be punished for falling into our cavern and disturbing us.\"    \"I didn't know you were here, and I didn't know I was going to fall  in,\" explained Woot.    \"Nevertheless, here you are,\" said the great Dragon, \"and you have  carelessly wakened our entire tribe; so it stands to reason you must be  punished.\"    \"In what way?\" inquired the Green Monkey, trembling a little.    \"Give me time and I'll think of a way. You're in no hurry, are you?\"  asked the great Dragon.    \"No, indeed,\" cried Woot. \"Take your time. I'd much rather you'd all go  to sleep again, and punish me when you wake up in a hundred years or  so.\"    \"Let me eat him!\" pleaded the littlest Dragon.    \"He is too small,\" said the father. \"To eat this one Green Monkey would  only serve to make you hungry for more, and there are no more.\"    \"Quit this chatter and let me get to sleep,\" protested another Dragon,  yawning in a fearful manner, for when he opened his mouth a sheet of  flame leaped forth from it and made Woot jump back to get out of its  way.    In his jump he bumped against the nose of a Dragon behind him, which  opened its mouth to growl and shot another sheet of flame at him. The  flame was bright, but not very hot, yet Woot screamed with terror and  sprang forward with a great bound. This time he landed on the paw of  the great Chief Dragon, who angrily raised his other front paw and  struck the Green Monkey a fierce blow. Woot went sailing through the  air and fell sprawling upon the rocky floor far beyond the place where  the Dragon Tribe was grouped.    All the great beasts were now thoroughly wakened and aroused, and they  blamed the monkey for disturbing their quiet. The littlest Dragon  darted after Woot and the others turned their unwieldy bodies in his  direction and followed, flashing from their eyes and mouths flames  which lighted up the entire cavern. Woot almost gave himself up for  lost, at that moment, but he scrambled to his feet and dashed away to  the farthest end of the cave, the Dragons following more leisurely  because they were too clumsy to move fast. Perhaps they thought there  was no need of haste, as the monkey could not escape from the cave.  But, away up at the end of the place, the cavern floor was heaped with  tumbled rocks, so Woot, with an agility born of fear, climbed from rock  to rock until he found himself crouched against the cavern roof. There  he waited, for he could go no farther, while on over the tumbled rocks  slowly crept the Dragons--the littlest one coming first because he was  hungry as well as angry.    The beasts had almost reached him when Woot, remembering his lace  apron--now sadly torn and soiled--recovered his wits and shouted:  \"Open!\" At the cry a hole appeared in the roof of the cavern, just over  his head, and through it the sunlight streamed full upon the Green  Monkey.    The Dragons paused, astonished at the magic and blinking at the  sunlight, and this gave Woot time to climb through the opening. As soon  as he reached the surface of the earth the hole closed again, and the  boy monkey realized, with a thrill of joy, that he had seen the last of  the dangerous Dragon family.    He sat upon the ground, still panting hard from his exertions, when the  bushes before him parted and his former enemy, the Jaguar, appeared.    \"Don't run,\" said the woodland beast, as Woot sprang up; \"you are  perfectly safe, so far as I am concerned, for since you so mysteriously  disappeared I have had my breakfast. I am now on my way home to sleep  the rest of the day.\"    \"Oh, indeed!\" returned the Green Monkey, in a tone both sorry and  startled. \"Which of my friends did you manage to eat?\"    \"None of them,\" returned the Jaguar, with a sly grin \"I had a dish of  magic scrambled eggs--on toast--and it wasn't a bad feast, at all.  There isn't room in me for even you, and I don't regret it because I  judge, from your green color, that you are not ripe, and would make an  indifferent meal. We jaguars have to be careful of our digestions.  Farewell, Friend Monkey. Follow the path I made through the bushes and  you will find your friends.\"    With this the Jaguar marched on his way and Woot took his advice and  followed the trail he had made until he came to the place where the  little Brown Bear, and the Tin Owl, and the Canary were conferring  together and wondering what had become of their comrade, the Green  Monkey.          Chapter Ten    Tommy Kwikstep      \"Our best plan,\" said the Scarecrow Bear, when the Green Monkey had  related the story of his adventure with the Dragons, \"is to get out of  this Gillikin Country as soon as we can and try to find our way to the  castle of Glinda, the Good Sorceress. There are too many dangers  lurking here to suit me, and Glinda may be able to restore us to our  proper forms.\"    \"If we turn south now,\" the Tin Owl replied, \"we might go straight into  the Emerald City. That's a place I wish to avoid, for I'd hate to have  my friends see me in this sad plight,\" and he blinked his eyes and  fluttered his tin wings mournfully.    \"But I am certain we have passed beyond Emerald City,\" the Canary  assured him, sailing lightly around their heads. \"So, should we turn  south from here, we would pass into the Munchkin Country, and  continuing south we would reach the Quadling Country where Glinda's  castle is located.\"    \"Well, since you're sure of that, let's start right away,\" proposed the  Bear. \"It's a long journey, at the best, and I'm getting tired of  walking on four legs.\"    \"I thought you never tired, being stuffed with straw,\" said Woot.    \"I mean that it annoys me, to be obliged to go on all fours, when two  legs are my proper walking equipment,\" replied the Scarecrow. \"I  consider it beneath my dignity. In other words, my remarkable brains  can tire, through humiliation, although my body cannot tire.\"    \"That is one of the penalties of having brains,\" remarked the Tin Owl  with a sigh. \"I have had no brains since I was a man of meat, and so I  never worry. Nevertheless, I prefer my former manly form to this owl's  shape and would be glad to break Mrs. Yoop's enchantment as soon as  possible. I am so noisy, just now, that I disturb myself,\" and he  fluttered his wings with a clatter that echoed throughout the forest.    So, being all of one mind, they turned southward, traveling steadily on  until the woods were left behind and the landscape turned from purple  tints to blue tints, which assured them they had entered the Country of  the Munchkins.    \"Now I feel myself more safe,\" said the Scarecrow Bear. \"I know this  country pretty well, having been made here by a Munchkin farmer and  having wandered over these lovely blue lands many times. Seems to me,  indeed, that I even remember that group of three tall trees ahead of  us; and, if I do, we are not far from the home of my friend Jinjur.\"    \"Who is Jinjur?\" asked Woot, the Green Monkey.    \"Haven't you heard of Jinjur?\" exclaimed the Scarecrow, in surprise.    \"No,\" said Woot. \"Is Jinjur a man, a woman, a beast or a bird?\"    \"Jinjur is a girl,\" explained the Scarecrow Bear. \"She's a fine girl,  too, although a bit restless and liable to get excited. Once, a long  time ago, she raised an army of girls and called herself 'General  Jinjur.' With her army she captured the Emerald City, and drove me out  of it, because I insisted that an army in Oz was highly improper. But  Ozma"]]]
