All the dizzy and colossal things conceded depend upon one small  thing withheld.  All the wild and whirling things that are let  loose depend upon one thing that is forbidden.  Mr. W.B.Yeats,  in his exquisite and piercing elfin poetry, describes the elves  as lawless; they plunge in innocent anarchy on the unbridled horses  of the air--         \"Ride on the crest of the dishevelled tide,      And dance  upon the mountains like a flame.\"    It is a dreadful thing to say that Mr. W.B.Yeats does not  understand fairyland.  But I do say it.  He is an ironical Irishman,  full of intellectual reactions.  He is not stupid enough to  understand fairyland.  Fairies prefer people of the yokel type  like myself; people who gape and grin and do as they are told.  Mr. Yeats reads into elfland all the righteous insurrection of his  own race.  But the lawlessness of Ireland is a Christian lawlessness,  founded on reason and justice.  The Fenian is rebelling against  something he understands only too well; but the true citizen of  fairyland is obeying something that he does not understand at all.  In the fairy tale an incomprehensible happiness rests upon an  incomprehensible condition.  A box is opened, and all evils fly out.  A word is forgotten, and cities perish.  A lamp is lit, and love  flies away.  A flower is plucked, and human lives are forfeited.  An apple is eaten, and the hope of God is gone.         This is the tone of fairy tales, and it is certainly not  lawlessness or even liberty, though men under a mean modern tyranny  may think it liberty by comparison.  People out of Portland  Gaol might think Fleet Street free; but closer study will prove  that both fairies and journalists are the slaves of duty.  Fairy godmothers seem at least as strict as other godmothers.  Cinderella received a coach out of Wonderland and a coachman out  of nowhere, but she received a command--which might have come out  of Brixton--that she should be back by twelve.  Also, she had a  glass slipper; and it cannot be a coincidence that glass is so common  a substance in folk-lore. This princess lives in a glass castle,  that princess on a glass hill; this one sees all things in a mirror;  they may all live in glass houses if they will not throw stones.  For this thin glitter of glass everywhere is the expression of the fact  that the happiness is bright but brittle, like the substance most  easily smashed by a housemaid or a cat.  And this fairy-tale sentiment  also sank into me and became my sentiment towards the whole world.  I felt and feel that life itself is as bright as the diamond,  but as brittle as the window-pane; and when the heavens were  compared to the terrible crystal I can remember a shudder.  I was afraid that God would drop the cosmos with a crash.         Remember, however, that to be breakable is not the same as to  be perishable.  Strike a glass, and it will not endure an instant;  simply do not strike it, and it will endure a thousand years.  Such, it seemed, was the joy of man, either in elfland or on earth;  the happiness depended on NOT DOING SOMETHING which you could at any  moment do and which, very often, it was not obvious why you should  not do.  Now, the point here is that to ME this did not seem unjust.  If the miller's third son said to the fairy, \"Explain why I  must not stand on my head in the fairy palace,\" the other might  fairly reply, \"Well, if it comes to that, explain the fairy palace.\"  If Cinderella says, \"How is it that I must leave the ball at twelve?\"  her godmother might answer, \"How is it that you are going there  till twelve?\"  If I leave a man in my will ten talking elephants  and a hundred winged horses, he cannot complain if the conditions  partake of the slight eccentricity of the gift.  He must not look  a winged horse in the mouth.  And it seemed to me that existence  was itself so very eccentric a legacy that I could not complain  of not understanding the limitations of the vision when I did  not understand the vision they limited.  The frame was no stranger  than the picture.  The veto might well be as wild as the vision;  it might be as startling as the sun, as elusive as the waters,  as fantastic and terrible as the towering trees.         For this reason (we may call it the fairy godmother philosophy)  I never could join the young men of my time in feeling what they  called the general sentiment of REVOLT.  I should have resisted,  let us hope, any rules that were evil, and with these and their  definition I shall deal in another chapter.  But I did not feel  disposed to resist any rule merely because it was mysterious.  Estates are sometimes held by foolish forms, the breaking of a stick  or the payment of a peppercorn:  I was willing to hold the huge  estate of earth and heaven by any such feudal fantasy.  It could not  well be wilder than the fact that I was allowed to hold it at all.  At this stage I give only one ethical instance to show my meaning.  I could never mix in the common murmur of that rising generation  against monogamy, because no restriction on sex seemed so odd and  unexpected as sex itself.  To be allowed, like Endymion, to make  love to the moon and then to complain that Jupiter kept his own  moons in a harem seemed to me (bred on fairy tales like Endymion's)  a vulgar anti-climax. Keeping to one woman is a small price for  so much as seeing one woman.  To complain that I could only be  married once was like complaining that I had only been born once.  It was incommensurate with the terrible excitement of which one  was talking.  It showed, not an exaggerated sensibility to sex,  but a curious insensibility to it.  A man is a fool who complains  that he cannot enter Eden by five gates at once.  Polygamy is a lack  of the realization of sex; it is like a man plucking five pears  in mere absence of mind.  The aesthetes touched the last insane  limits of language in their eulogy on lovely things.  The thistledown  made them weep; a burnished beetle brought them to their knees.  Yet their emotion never impressed me for an instant, for this reason,  that it never occurred to them to pay for their pleasure in any  sort of symbolic sacrifice.  Men (I felt) might fast forty days  for the sake of hearing a blackbird sing.  Men might go through fire  to find a cowslip.  Yet these lovers of beauty could not even keep  sober for the blackbird.  They would not go through common Christian  marriage by way of recompense to the cowslip.  Surely one might  pay for extraordinary joy in ordinary morals.  Oscar Wilde said  that sunsets were not valued because we could not pay for sunsets.  But Oscar Wilde was wrong; we can pay for sunsets.  We can pay for them  by not being Oscar Wilde.         Well, I left the fairy tales lying on the floor of the nursery,  and I have not found any books so sensible since.  I left the  nurse guardian of tradition and democracy, and I have not found  any modern type so sanely radical or so sanely conservative.  But the matter for important comment was here:  that when I  first went out into the mental atmosphere of the modern world,  I found that the modern world was positively opposed on two points  to my nurse and to the nursery tales.  It has taken me a long time  to find out that the modern world is wrong and my nurse was right.  The really curious thing was this:  that modern thought contradicted  this basic creed of my boyhood on its two most essential doctrines.  I have explained that the fairy tales founded in me two convictions;  first, that this world is a wild and startling place, which might  have been quite different, but which is quite delightful; second,  that before this wildness and delight one may well be modest and  submit to the queerest limitations of so queer a kindness.  But I  found the whole modern world running like a high tide against both  my tendernesses; and the shock of that collision created two sudden  and spontaneous sentiments, which I have had ever since and which,  crude as they were, have since hardened into convictions.         First, I found the whole modern world talking scientific fatalism;  saying that everything is as it must always have been, being unfolded  without fault from the beginning.  The leaf on the tree is green  because it could never have been anything else.  Now, the fairy-tale  philosopher is glad that the leaf is green precisely because it  might have been scarlet.  He feels as if it had turned green an  instant before he looked at it.  He is pleased that snow is white  on the strictly reasonable ground that it might have been black.  Every colour has in it a bold quality as of choice; the red of garden  roses is not only decisive but dramatic, like suddenly spilt blood.  He feels that something has been DONE.  But the great determinists  of the nineteenth century were strongly against this native  feeling that something had happened an instant before.  In fact,  according to them, nothing ever really had happened since the beginning  of the world.  Nothing ever had happened since existence had happened;  and even about the date of that they were not very sure.         The modern world as I found it was solid for modern Calvinism,  for the necessity of things being as they are.  But when I came  to ask them I found they had really no proof of this unavoidable  repetition in things except the fact that the things were repeated.  Now, the mere repetition made the things to me rather more weird  than more rational.  It was as if, having seen a curiously shaped  nose in the street and dismissed it as an accident, I had then  seen six other noses of the same astonishing shape.  I should have  fancied for a moment that it must be some local secret society.  So one elephant having a trunk was odd; but all elephants having  trunks looked like a plot.

Oldring  hides in there. He needs only to guard a trail leading down from  the sage-flat above. Little danger of this outlet to the pass being  discovered. I stumbled on it by luck, after I had given up. And now I  know the truth of what puzzled me most--why that cattle trail was wet!\"    He wheeled and ran down the slope, and out to the level of the  sage-brush. Returning, he had no time to spare, only now and then,  between dashes, a moment when he stopped to cast sharp eyes ahead. The  abundant grass left no trace of his trail. Short work he made of the  distance to the circle of canyons. He doubted that he would ever see it  again; he knew he never wanted to; yet he looked at the red corners  and towers with the eyes of a rider picturing landmarks never to be  forgotten.    Here he spent a panting moment in a slow-circling gaze of the sage-oval  and the gaps between the bluffs. Nothing stirred except the gentle wave  of the tips of the brush. Then he pressed on past the mouths of several  canyons and over ground new to him, now close under the eastern wall.  This latter part proved to be easy traveling, well screened from  possible observation from the north and west, and he soon covered it  and felt safer in the deepening shade of his own canyon. Then the huge,  notched bulge of red rim loomed over him, a mark by which he knew again  the deep cove where his camp lay hidden. As he penetrated the thicket,  safe again for the present, his thoughts reverted to the girl he had  left there. The afternoon had far advanced. How would he find her? He  ran into camp, frightening the dogs.    The girl lay with wide-open, dark eyes, and they dilated when he knelt  beside her. The flush of fever shone in her cheeks. He lifted her and  held water to her dry lips, and felt an inexplicable sense of lightness  as he saw her swallow in a slow, choking gulp. Gently he laid her back.    \"Who--are--you?\" she whispered, haltingly.    \"I'm the man who shot you,\" he replied.    \"You'll--not--kill me--now?\"    \"No, no.\"    \"What--will--you--do--with me?\"    \"When you get better--strong enough--I'll take you back to the canyon  where the rustlers ride through the waterfall.\"    As with a faint shadow from a flitting wing overhead, the marble  whiteness of her face seemed to change.    \"Don't--take--me--back--there!\"        CHAPTER VI. THE MILL-WHEEL OF STEERS    Meantime, at the ranch, when Judkins's news had sent Venters on the  trail of the rustlers, Jane Withersteen led the injured man to her house  and with skilled fingers dressed the gunshot wound in his arm.    \"Judkins, what do you think happened to my riders?\"    \"I--I d rather not say,\" he replied.    \"Tell me. Whatever you'll tell me I'll keep to myself. I'm beginning  to worry about more than the loss of a herd of cattle. Venters hinted  of--but tell me, Judkins.\"    \"Well, Miss Withersteen, I think as Venters thinks--your riders have  been called in.\"    \"Judkins!... By whom?\"    \"You know who handles the reins of your Mormon riders.\"    \"Do you dare insinuate that my churchmen have ordered in my riders?\"    \"I ain't insinuatin' nothin', Miss Withersteen,\" answered Judkins, with  spirit. \"I know what I'm talking about. I didn't want to tell you.\"    \"Oh, I can't believe that! I'll not believe it! Would Tull leave my  herds at the mercy of rustlers and wolves just because--because--? No,  no! It's unbelievable.\"    \"Yes, thet particular thing's onheard of around Cottonwoods But, beggin'  pardon, Miss Withersteen, there never was any other rich Mormon woman  here on the border, let alone one thet's taken the bit between her  teeth.\"    That was a bold thing for the reserved Judkins to say, but it did not  anger her. This rider's crude hint of her spirit gave her a glimpse of  what others might think. Humility and obedience had been hers always.  But had she taken the bit between her teeth? Still she wavered. And  then, with quick spurt of warm blood along her veins, she thought of  Black Star when he got the bit fast between his iron jaws and ran wild  in the sage. If she ever started to run! Jane smothered the glow and  burn within her, ashamed of a passion for freedom that opposed her duty.    \"Judkins, go to the village,\" she said, \"and when you have learned  anything definite about my riders please come to me at once.\"    When he had gone Jane resolutely applied her mind to a number of tasks  that of late had been neglected. Her father had trained her in the  management of a hundred employees and the working of gardens and fields;  and to keep record of the movements of cattle and riders. And beside the  many duties she had added to this work was one of extreme delicacy, such  as required all her tact and ingenuity. It was an unobtrusive, almost  secret aid which she rendered to the Gentile families of the village.  Though Jane Withersteen never admitted so to herself, it amounted to no  less than a system of charity. But for her invention of numberless kinds  of employment, for which there was no actual need, these families of  Gentiles, who had failed in a Mormon community, would have starved.    In aiding these poor people Jane thought she deceived her keen  churchmen, but it was a kind of deceit for which she did not pray to be  forgiven. Equally as difficult was the task of deceiving the Gentiles,  for they were as proud as they were poor. It had been a great grief to  her to discover how these people hated her people; and it had been a  source of great joy that through her they had come to soften in hatred.  At any time this work called for a clearness of mind that precluded  anxiety and worry; but under the present circumstances it required all  her vigor and obstinate tenacity to pin her attention upon her task.    Sunset came, bringing with the end of her labor a patient calmness and  power to wait that had not been hers earlier in the day. She expected  Judkins, but he did not appear. Her house was always quiet; to-night,  however, it seemed unusually so. At supper her women served her with a  silent assiduity; it spoke what their sealed lips could not utter--the  sympathy of Mormon women. Jerd came to her with the key of the great  door of the stone stable, and to make his daily report about the horses.  One of his daily duties was to give Black Star and Night and the other  racers a ten-mile run. This day it had been omitted, and the boy grew  confused in explanations that she had not asked for. She did inquire if  he would return on the morrow, and Jerd, in mingled surprise and relief,  assured her he would always work for her. Jane missed the rattle and  trot, canter and gallop of the incoming riders on the hard trails. Dusk  shaded the grove where she walked; the birds ceased singing; the wind  sighed through the leaves of the cottonwoods, and the running water  murmured down its stone-bedded channel. The glimmering of the first star  was like the peace and beauty of the night. Her faith welled up in her  heart and said that all would soon be right in her little world. She  pictured Venters about his lonely camp-fire sitting between his faithful  dogs. She prayed for his safety, for the success of his undertaking.    Early the next morning one of Jane's women brought in word that Judkins  wished to speak to her. She hurried out, and in her surprise to see him  armed with rifle and revolver, she forgot her intention to inquire about  his wound.    \"Judkins! Those guns? You never carried guns.\"    \"It's high time, Miss Withersteen,\" he replied. \"Will you come into the  grove? It ain't jest exactly safe for me to be seen here.\"    She walked with him into the shade of the cottonwoods.    \"What do you mean?\"    \"Miss Withersteen, I went to my mother's house last night. While there,  some one knocked, an' a man asked for me. I went to the door. He wore  a mask. He said I'd better not ride any more for Jane Withersteen. His  voice was hoarse an' strange, disguised I reckon, like his face. He said  no more, an' ran off in the dark.\"    \"Did you know who he was?\" asked Jane, in a low voice.    \"Yes.\"    Jane did not ask to know; she did not want to know; she feared to know.  All her calmness fled at a single thought.    \"Thet's why I'm packin' guns,\" went on Judkins. \"For I'll never quit  ridin' for you, Miss Withersteen, till you let me go.\"    \"Judkins, do you want to leave me?\"    \"Do I look thet way? Give me a hoss--a fast hoss, an' send me out on the  sage.\"    \"Oh, thank you, Judkins! You're more faithful than my own people. I  ought not accept your loyalty--you might suffer more through it. But  what in the world can I do? My head whirls. The wrong to Venters--the  stolen herd--these masks, threats, this coil in the dark! I can't  understand! But I feel something dark and terrible closing in around  me.\"    \"Miss Withersteen, it's all simple enough,\" said Judkins, earnestly.  \"Now please listen--an' beggin' your pardon--jest turn thet deaf Mormon  ear aside, an' let me talk clear an' plain in the other. I went around  to the saloons an' the stores an' the loafin' places yesterday. All your  riders are in. There's talk of a vigilance band organized to hunt down  rustlers. They call themselves 'The Riders.' Thet's the report--thet's  the reason given for your riders leavin' you. Strange thet only a  few riders of other ranchers joined the band! An' Tull's man, Jerry  Card--he's the leader. I seen him en' his hoss. He 'ain't been to Glaze.  I'm not easy to fool on the looks of a hoss thet's traveled the sage.  Tull an' Jerry didn't ride to Glaze!... Well, I met Blake en' Dorn, both  good friends of mine, usually, as far as their Mormon lights will let  'em go. But these fellers couldn't fool me, an' they didn't try very  hard. I asked them, straight out like a man, why they left you like  thet. I didn't forget to mention how you nursed Blake's poor old mother  when she was sick, an' how good you"]]]
