Don Carlos had been betrothed to Leonora, but out  of friendship resigned her to the conqueror. Zanga, the Moor, out  of revenge, persuaded Alonzo that his wife and don Carlos still  entertained for each other their former love, and out of jealousy  Alonzo has his friend put to death, while Leonora makes away with  herself.

ALPHE'US (3 _syl_.), a magician and prophet in the army of  Charlemagne, slain in sleep by Clorida'no.--Ariosto, _Orlando Furioso_  (1516).    _Alphe'us_ (3 _syl_.), of classic story, being passionately in love  with Arethu'sa, pursued her, but she fled from him in a fright, and  was changed by Diana into a fountain, which bears her name.    ALPHON'SO, an irascible old lord in _The Pilgrim_, a comedy by  Beaumont and Fletcher (1621).    _Alphon'so_, king of Naples, deposed by his brother Frederick. Sora'no  tried to poison him, but did not succeed. Ultimately he recovered his  crown, and Frederick and Sorano were sent to a monastery for the rest  of their lives.--Beaumont and Fletcher, _A Wife for a Month_ (1624).    _Alphonso_, son of count Pedro of Cantabria, afterwards king of Spain.  He was plighted to Hermesind, daughter of lord Pelayo.      The young Alphonso was in truth an heir    Of nature's largest patrimony; rich    In form and feature, growing strength of limb,    A gentle heart, a soul affectionate,    A joyous spirit, filled with generous thoughts,    And genius heightening and ennobling all.    Southey, _Roderick, etc._, viii. (1814).    ALQUI'FE (3 _syl_.), a famous enchanter in _Amadis of Gaul_, by Vasco  de Lobeira, of Oporto, who died 1403.    La Noue denounces such beneficent enchanters as Alquife and Urganda,  because they serve \"as a vindication of those who traffic with the  powers of darkness.\"--Francis de la Noue, _Discourses_, 87 (1587).    ALRINACH, the demon who causes shipwrecks, and presides over storms  and earthquakes. When visible it is always in the form and dress of a  woman.--_Eastern Mythology_.    ALSCRIP (_Miss_), \"the heiress,\" a vulgar _parvenue_, affected,  conceited, ill-natured, and ignorant. Having had a fortune left her,  she assumes the airs of a woman of fashion, and exhibits the follies  without possessing the merits of the upper ten.    _Mr. Alscrip_, the vulgar father of \"the heiress,\" who finds the  grandeur of sudden wealth a great bore, and in his new mansion,  Berkeley Square, sighs for the snug comforts he once enjoyed as  scrivener in Furnival's Inn.--General Burgoyne, _The Heiress_ (1781).

Typical far-southern girl, with a lovely face, creamy skin,  and a \"lazy sweet voice,\" who takes the leading part in Annie Eliot's  _An Hour's Promise_ (1888).    ALTHAEA'S BRAND. The Fates told Althaea that her son Melea'ger  would live just as long as a log of wood then on the fire remained  unconsumed. Althaea contrived to keep the log unconsumed for many  years, but when her son killed her two brothers, she threw it angrily  into the fire, where it was quickly consumed, and Meleager expired at  the same time.--Ovid, _Metaph_. viii. 4.      The fatal brand Althaea burned.    Shakespeare, 2 _Henry VI_. act i. sc. 1 (1591).    ALTHE'A (_The divine_), of Richard Lovelace, was Lucy Saeheverell,  also called by the poet, _Lucasta_.      When love with unconfined wings    Hovers within my gates,    And my divine Althea brings    To whisper at my grates.    (The \"grates\" here referred to were those of a prison in which  Lovelace was confined by the Long Parliament, for his petition from  Kent in favor of the king.)    ALTHEETAR, one of the seven bridegrooms of Lopluel, condemned to die  successively, by a malignant spirit. He is young, beautiful, and  endowed with rare gifts of soul and mind. While singing to her, his  lyre falls from his hand and he dies in her arms, her loosened hair  falling about him as a shroud.      \"So calm, so fair,    He rested on the purple, tapestried floor,    It seemed an angel lay reposing there.\"    _Lopluel, or the Bride of Seven_, by Maria del Occidente (Maria Gowen  Brooks) (1833).    ALTISIDO'RA, one of the duchess's servants, who pretends to be in love  with don Quixote, and serenades him. The don sings his response that  he has no other love than what he gives to his Dulcin'ea, and while he  is still singing he is assailed by a string of cats, let into the room  by a rope. As the knight is leaving the mansion, Altisidora accuses  him of having stolen her garters, but when the knight denies the  charge, the damsel protests that she said so in her distraction, for  her garters were not stolen. \"I am like the man looking for his mule  at the time he was astride its back.\"--Cervantes, _Don Quixote_, II.  iii. 9, etc.; iv. 5 (1615).    AL'TON (_Miss_), _alias_ Miss CLIFFORD, a sweet, modest young lady,  the companion of Miss Alscrip, \"the heiress,\" a vulgar, conceited  _parvenue_. Lord Gayville is expected to marry \"the heiress,\" but  detests her, and loves Miss Alton, her humble companion. It turns out  that L2000 a year of \"the heiress's\" fortune belongs to Mr. Clifford  (Miss Alton's brother), and is by him settled on his sister. Sir  Clement Flint destroys this bond, whereby the money returns to  Clifford, who marries lady Emily Gayville, and sir Clement settles the  same on his nephew, lord Gayville, who marries Miss Alton.--General  Burgoyne, _The Heiress_ (1781).    AL'TON LOCKE, tailor and poet, a novel by the Rev. Charles Kingsley  (1850).

We was--engaged--once't on a time!\"--_Seth's  Brother's Wife_, by Harold Frederic (1886).    ALZIR'DO, king of Trem'izen, in Africa, overthrown by Orlando in  his march to join the allied army of Ag'ramant.--Ariosto, _Orlando  Furioso_ (1516).    AM'ADIS OF GAUL, a love-child of king Per'ion and the princess  Elize'na. He is the hero of a famous prose romance of chivalry, the  first four books of which are attributed to Lobeira, of Portugal (died  1403). These books were translated into Spanish in 1460 by Montal'vo,  who added the fifth book. The five were rendered into French by  Herberay, who increased the series to twenty-four books. Lastly,  Gilbert Saunier added seven more volumes, and called the entire series  _Le Roman des Romans_.    Whether Amadis was French or British is disputed. Some maintain  that \"Gaul\" means _Wales_, not France; that Elizena was princess of  _Brittany_ (Bretagne), and that Perion was king of Gaul (_Wales_), not  Gaul _(France)._      Amadis de Gaul was a tall man, of a fair complexion,    his aspect something between mild and    austere, and had a handsome black beard. He    was a person of very few words, was not easily    provoked, and was soon appeased.--Cervantes,    _Don Quixote_, II. i. 1 (1615).    As Arthur is the central figure of British romance, Charlemagne of  French, and Diderick of German, so Amadis is the central figure of  Spanish and Portuguese romance; but there is this difference--the tale  of Amadis is a connected whole, terminating with his marriage with  Oria'na, the intervening parts being only the obstacles he encountered  and overcame in obtaining this consummation. In the Arthurian  romances, and those of the Charlemagne series, we have a number of  adventures of different heroes, but there is no unity of purpose; each  set of adventures is complete in itself.    AMA'DIS OF GREECE, a supplemental part of _Amadis of Gaul_, by  Felicia'no de Silva. There are also several other Amadises--as Amadis  of Colchis, Amadis of Trebisond, Amadis of Cathay, but all these are  very inferior to the original _Amadis of Gaul_.      The ancient fables, whose relickes doe yet remain, namely, _Lancelot  of the Lake, Pierceforest,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11438"],[0,"The Willows (#12)"],[1," that it became  released from the grip of the willow roots. A moment later it had turned  completely over, the dead face uppermost, staring at the sky. It lay on the  edge of the main stream. In another moment it would be swept away.    The Swede started to save it, shouting again something I did not catch  about a \"proper burial\"--and then abruptly dropped upon his knees on the  sand and covered his eyes with his hands. I was beside him in an instant.    I saw what he had seen.    For just as the body swung round to the current the face and the exposed  chest turned full towards us, and showed plainly how the skin and flesh  were indented with small hollows, beautifully formed, and exactly similar  in shape and kind to the sand-funnels that we had found all over the  island.    \"Their mark!\" I heard my companion mutter under his breath. \"Their awful  mark!\"    And when I turned my eyes again from his ghastly face to the river, the  current had done its work, and the body had been swept away into mid-stream  and was already beyond our reach and almost out of sight, turning over and  over on the waves like an otter."]]]
