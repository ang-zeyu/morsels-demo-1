Offenders of this kind are now tried at the Sessions-house in the Old  Bailey, before the judge of the Court of Admiralty, assisted by certain  other judges of the Common Law by virtue of such a commission as ts  before mentioned, the silver oar (a peculiar ensign of authority  belonging to the Court of Admiralty) lying on the table. As pirates are  not very often apprehended in Britain, so particular notice is always  given when a Court like this, called an Admiralty Sessions, is to be  held, the prisoners until that time remaining in the Marshalsea, the  proper prison of this Court.    On the 26th of Jury, 1721, at such a sessions, Walter Kennedy and John  Bradshaw were tried for piracies committed on the high seas, and both of  them convicted. This Walter Kennedy was born at a place called Pelican  Stairs in Wapping. His father was an anchor-smith, a man of good  reputation, who gave his son Walter the best education he was able; and  while a lad he was very tractable, and had no other apparent ill quality  than that of a too aspiring temper. When he was grown up big enough to  have gone out to a trade, his father bound him apprentice to himself,  but died before his son was out of his time. Leaving his father's  effects in the possession of his mother and brothers, Walter then  followed his own roving inclinations and went to sea. He served for a  considerable time on board a man-of-war, in the reign of her late  Majesty Queen Anne, in the war then carried on against France; during  which time he often had occasion to hear of the exploits of the pirates,  both in the East and West Indies, and of their having got several  islands into their possession, wherein they were settled, and in which  they exercised a sovereign power.    These tales had wonderful effect on Walter's disposition, and created in  him a secret ambition of making a figure in the same way. He became more  than ordinarily attentive whenever stories of that sort were told, and  sought every opportunity of putting his fellow sailors upon such  relations. Men of that profession have usually good memories with  respect, at least, to such matters, and Kennedy, therefore, without much  difficulty became acquainted with the principal expeditions of these  maritime desperadoes, from the time of Sir Henry Morgan's commanding the  Buccaneers in America, to Captain Avery's more modern exploits at  Madagascar[8]; his fancy insinuating to him continually that he might be  able to make as great a figure as any of these thievish heroes, whenever  a proper opportunity offered.    It happened that he was sent with Captain Woodes Rogers,[9] Governor of  Providence [Bahama Islands], when that gentleman first sent to recover  that island by reducing the pirates, who then had it in possession. At  the time of the captain's arrival these people had fortified themselves  in several places, and with all the care they were able, had provided  both for their safety and subsistence.    It happened that some time before, they had taken a ship, on board of  which they found a considerable quantity of the richest brocades, for  which having no other occasion, they tore them up, and tying them  between the horns of their goats, made use of them to distinguish herds  that belonged to one settlement and those that belonged to another, and  sight of this, notwithstanding the miserable condition which in other  respects these wretches were in, mightily excited the inclination  Kennedy had to following their occupation.    Captain Rogers having signified to the chiefs of them the offers he had  to make of free grace and pardon, the greater number of them came in and  submitted very readily. Those who were determined to continue the same  dissolute kind of life, provided with all the secrecy imaginable for  their safety, and when practicable took their flight out of the island.  The captain being made Governor, fitted out two sloops for trade, and  having given proper directions to their commanders, manned them out of  his own sailors with some of these reformed pirates intermixed. Kennedy  went out on one of these vessels, in which he had not long been at sea  before he joined in a conspiracy some of the rest had formed of seizing  the vessel, putting those to death who refused to come into their  measures, and then to go, as the sailors phrase it, \"upon the account\",  that is in plain English, commence pirates.    This villainous design succeeded according to their wish. They emptied  the other vessel of whatever they thought might be of use, and then  turned her adrift, as being a heavy sailer, and consequently unfit for  their purpose. A few days after their entering on this new course of  life, they made themselves masters of two pretty large ships, having  fitted which for their purpose, they now grew strong enough to execute  any project that in their present circumstances they were capable of  forming. Thus Kennedy was now got in to that unhappy state of living  which from a false notion of things he had framed so fair an idea of and  was so desirous to engage in.    Kennedy took a particular delight in relating what happened to him in  these expeditions, even after they had brought him to misery and  confinement. The account he gave of that form of rule which these  wretches set up, in imitation of the legal government, and of those  regulations there made to supply the place of moral honesty was in  substance this.    They chose a captain from amongst themselves, who in effect held little  more than that title, excepting in an engagement, when he commanded  absolutely and without control. Most of them having suffered formerly  from the ill-treatment of their officers, provided carefully against any  such evil, now they had the choice in themselves. By their orders they  provided especially against any quarrels which might happen among  themselves, and appointed certain punishments for anything that tended  that way; for the due execution thereof they constituted other officers  besides the captain, so very industrious were they to avoid putting too  much power into the hands of one man. The rest of their agreement  consisted chiefly in relation to the manner of dividing the cargo of  such prizes as they should happen to take, and though they had broken  through all laws divine and human, yet they imposed an oath to be taken  for the due observance of these, so inconsistent a thing is vice, and so  strong the principles imbibed from education.    The life they led at sea was rendered equally unhappy from fear and  hardship, they never seeing any vessel which reduced them not to the  necessity of fighting, and often filled them with apprehensions of being  overcome. Whatever they took in their several prizes could afford them  no other pleasure but downright drunkenness on board, and except for two  or three islands there were no other places where they were permitted to  come on shore, for nowadays it was become exceedingly dangerous to land,  either at Jamaica, Barbadoes, or on the islands of the Bermudas. In this  condition they were when they came to a resolution of choosing one  Davis[10] as captain, and going under his command to the coast of  Brazil.    This design they put in execution, being chiefly tempted with the hopes  of surprising some vessel of the homeward bound Portuguese fleet, by  which they hoped to be made rich at once, and no longer be obliged to  lead a life so full of danger. Accordingly they fell in with twenty sail  of those ships and were in the utmost danger of being taken and treated  as they deserved. However, on this occasion their captain behaved very  prudently, and taking the advantage of one of those vessels being  separated from the rest, they boarded her in the night without firing a  gun. They forced the captain, when they had him in one of their own  ships, to discover which of the fleet was the most richly laden, which  he having done through fear, they impudently attacked her, and were very  near becoming masters of her, though they were surrounded by the  Portuguese ships, from whence they at last escaped, not so much by the  swiftness of their own sailing, as by the cowardice of the enemy. In  this attempt, though they miscarried as to the prize they had proposed,  yet they accounted themselves very fortunate in having thus escaped from  so dangerous an adventure.    Being some time after this in great want of water, Davis at the head of  about fifty of his men, very well armed, made a descent in order to fill  their casks, though the Portuguese governor of the port near which they  landed easily discovered them to be pirates; but not thinking himself in  a condition strong enough to attack them, he thought fit to dissemble  that knowledge.    Davis and his men were no sooner returned on board than they received a  message by a boat from shore, that the Governor would think himself  highly honoured if the captain and as many as he pleased of his ship's  company would accept of an entertainment the next day at the castle  where he resided. Their commander, who had hitherto behaved himself like  a man of conduct, suffered his vanity to overcome him so far as to  accept of the proposal, and the next morning with ten of his sailors,  all dressed in their best clothes, went on shore to this collation. But  before they had reached half way, they were set upon by a party of  Indians who lay in ambuscade, and with one flight of their poisoned  arrows laid them all "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13102"],[0,"The Decameron, Volume II (#12)"],[1," though  still treated as a slave, was suffered to grow up in the house with  Messer Amerigo's children, and, nature getting the better of  circumstance, bore himself with such grace and dignity that Messer  Amerigo gladly gave him his freedom, and still deeming him to be a Turk,  had him baptized and named Pietro, and made him his majordomo, and placed  much trust in him. Now among the other children that grew up in Messer  Amerigo's house was his fair and dainty daughter, Violante; and, as her  father was in no hurry to give her in marriage, it so befell that she  became enamoured of Pietro, but, for all her love and the great conceit  she had of his qualities and conduct, she nevertheless was too shamefast  to discover her passion to him. However, Love spared her the pains, for  Pietro had cast many a furtive glance in her direction, and had grown so  enamoured of her that 'twas never well with him except he saw her; but  great was his fear lest any should detect his passion, for he deemed  'twould be the worse for him. The damsel, who was fain indeed of the  sight of him, understood his case; and to encourage him dissembled not  her exceeding great satisfaction. On which footing they remained a great  while, neither venturing to say aught to the other, much as both longed  to do so. But, while they both burned with a mutual flame, Fortune, as if  their entanglement were of her preordaining, found means to banish the  fear and hesitation that kept them tongue-tied.    Messer Amerigo possessed, a mile or so from Trapani, a goodly estate, to  which he was wont not seldom to resort with his daughter and other ladies  by way of recreation; and on one of these days, while there they tarried  with Pietro, whom they had brought with them, suddenly, as will sometimes  happen in summer, the sky became overcast with black clouds, insomuch  that the lady and her companions, lest the storm should surprise them  there, set out on their return to Trapani, making all the haste they  might. But Pietro and the girl being young, and sped perchance by Love no  less than by fear of the storm, completely outstripped her mother and the  other ladies; and when they were gotten so far ahead as to be well-nigh  out of sight of the lady and all the rest, the thunder burst upon them  peal upon peal, hard upon which came a fall of hail very thick and close,  from which the lady sought shelter in the house of a husbandman. Pietro  and the damsel, finding no more convenient refuge, betook them to an old,  and all but ruinous, and now deserted, cottage, which, however, still had  a bit of roof left, whereunder they both took their stand in such close  quarters, owing to the exiguity of the shelter, that they perforce  touched one another. Which contact was the occasion that they gathered  somewhat more courage to disclose their love; and so it was that Pietro  began on this wise:--\"Now would to God that this hail might never cease,  that so I might stay here for ever!\" \"And well content were I,\" returned  the damsel. And by and by their hands met, not without a tender pressure,  and then they fell to embracing and so to kissing one another, while the  hail continued. And not to dwell on every detail, the sky was not clear  before they had known the last degree of love's felicity, and had taken  thought how they might secretly enjoy one another in the future. The  cottage being close to the city gate, they hied them thither, as soon as  the storm was overpast, and having there awaited the lady, returned home  with her. Nor, using all discretion, did they fail thereafter to meet  from time to time in secret, to their no small solace; and the affair  went so far that the damsel conceived, whereby they were both not a  little disconcerted; insomuch that the damsel employed many artifices to  arrest the course of nature, but to no effect. Wherefore Pietro, being in  fear of his life, saw nothing for it but flight, and told her so.  Whereupon:--\"If thou leave me,\" quoth she, \"I shall certainly kill  myself.\" Much as he loved her, Pietro answered:--\"Nay but, my lady,  wherefore wouldst thou have me tarry here? Thy pregnancy will discover  our offence: thou wilt be readily forgiven; but 'twill be my woeful lot  to bear the penalty of thy sin and mine.\" \"Pietro,\" returned the damsel,  \"too well will they wot of my offence, but be sure that, if thou confess  not, none will ever wot of thine.\" Then quoth he:--\"Since thou givest me  this promise, I will stay; but mind thou keep it.\"    The damsel, who had done her best to keep her condition secret, saw at  length by the increase of her bulk that 'twas impossible: wherefore one  day most piteously bewailing herself, she made her avowal to her mother,  and besought her to shield her from the consequences. Distressed beyond  measure, the lady chid her severely, and then asked her how it had come  to pass. The damsel, to screen Pietro, invented a story by which she put  another complexion on the affair. The lady believed her, and, that her  fall might not be discovered, took her off to one of their estates;  where, the time of her delivery being come, and she, as women do in such  a case, crying out for pain, it so befell that Messer Amerigo, whom the  lady expected not, as indeed he was scarce ever wont, to come there, did  so, having been out a hawking, and passing by the chamber where the  damsel lay, marvelled to hear her cries, and forthwith entered, and asked  what it meant. On sight of whom the lady rose and sorrowfully gave him  her daughter's version of what had befallen her. But he, less credulous  than his wife, averred that it could not be true that she knew not by  whom she was pregnant, and was minded to know the whole truth: let the  damsel confess and she might regain his favour; otherwise she must expect  no mercy and prepare for death.    The lady did all she could to induce her husband to rest satisfied with  what she had told him; but all to no purpose. Mad with rage, he rushed,  drawn sword in hand, to his daughter's bedside (she, pending the parley,  having given birth to a boy) and cried out:--\"Declare whose this infant  is, or forthwith thou diest.\" Overcome by fear of death, the damsel broke  her promise to Pietro, and made a clean breast of all that had passed  between him and her. Whereat the knight, grown fell with rage, could  scarce refrain from slaying her. However, having given vent to his wrath  in such words as it dictated, he remounted his horse and rode to Trapani,  and there before one Messer Currado, the King's lieutenant, laid  information of the wrong done him by Pietro, in consequence whereof  Pietro, who suspected nothing, was forthwith taken, and being put to the  torture, confessed all. Some days later the lieutenant sentenced him to  be scourged through the city, and then hanged by the neck; and Messer  Amerigo, being minded that one and the same hour should rid the earth of  the two lovers and their son (for to have compassed Pietro's death was  not enough to appease his wrath), mingled poison and wine in a goblet,  and gave it to one of his servants with a drawn sword, saying:--\"Get thee  with this gear to Violante, and tell her from me to make instant choice  of one of these two deaths, either the poison or the steel; else, I will  have her burned, as she deserves, in view of all the citizens; which  done, thou wilt take the boy that she bore a few days ago, and beat his  brains out against the wall, and cast his body for a prey to the dogs.\"    Hearing the remorseless doom thus passed by the angry father upon both  his daughter and his grandson, the servant, prompt to do evil rather than  good, hied him thence.    Now, as Pietro in execution of his sentence was being scourged to the  gallows by the serjeants, 'twas so ordered by the leaders of the band  that he passed by an inn, where were three noblemen of Armenia, sent by  the king of that country as ambassadors to Rome, to treat with the Pope  of matters of the highest importance, touching a crusade that was to be;  who, having there alighted to rest and recreate them for some days, had  received not a few tokens of honour from the nobles of Trapani, and most  of all from Messer Amerigo. Hearing the tramp of Pietro's escort, they  came to a window to see what was toward; and one of them, an aged man,  and of great authority, Fineo by name, looking hard at Pietro, who was  stripped from the waist up, and had his hands bound behind his back,  espied on his breast a great spot of scarlet, not laid on by art, but  wrought in the skin by operation of Nature, being such as the ladies here  call a rose. Which he no sooner saw, than he was reminded of a son that  had been stolen from him by corsairs on the coast of Lazistan some  fifteen years before, nor had he since been able to hear tidings of him;  and guessing the age of the poor wretch that was being scourged, he set  it down as about what his son's would be, were he living, and, what with  the mark and the age, he began to suspect that 'twas even his son, and  bethought him that, if so, he would scarce as yet have forgotten his name  or the speech of Armenia. Wherefore, as he was within earshot he called  to him:--\"Teodoro!\" At the word Pietro raised his head: whereupon Fineo,  speaking in Armenian, asked him:--\"Whence and whose son art thou?\" The  serjeants, that were leading him, paused in deference to the great man,  and so Pietro answered:--\"Of Armenia was I, son of one Fineo, brought  hither by folk I wot not of, when I was but a little child.\" Then Fineo,  witting that in very truth 'twas the boy that he had lost, came down with  his companions, weeping; and, all the serjeants making way, he ran to  him, and embraced him, and doffing a mantle of richest texture that he  wore, he prayed the captain of the band to be pleased to tarry there  until he should receive orders to go forward, and was answered by the  captain that he would willingly so"]]]
