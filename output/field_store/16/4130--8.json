To judge from the cheerfulness of his tone and the  firmness of his manner, the thought would never once have occurred that  he was dying. He walked, he reasoned, he jested, in a way that argued  the most perfect self-possession. But his appearance changed perceptibly  for the worse every quarter of an hour. Mr. Falkland kept his eye  perpetually fixed upon him, with mingled sentiments of anxiety and  admiration.    \"Falkland,\" said he, after having appeared for a short period absorbed  in thought, \"I feel that I am dying. This is a strange distemper of  mine. Yesterday I seemed in perfect health, and to-morrow I shall be an  insensible corpse. How curious is the line that separates life and death  to mortal men! To be at one moment active, gay, penetrating, with stores  of knowledge at one's command, capable of delighting, instructing, and  animating mankind, and the next, lifeless and loathsome, an incumbrance  upon the face of the earth! Such is the history of many men, and such  will be mine.    \"I feel as if I had yet much to do in the world; but it will not be. I  must be contented with what is past. It is in vain that I muster all my  spirits to my heart. The enemy is too mighty and too merciless for me;  he will not give me time so much as to breathe. These things are not yet  at least in our power: they are parts of a great series that is  perpetually flowing. The general welfare, the great business of the  universe, will go on, though I bear no further share in promoting it.  That task is reserved for younger strengths, for you, Falkland, and such  as you. We should be contemptible indeed if the prospect of human  improvement did not yield us a pure and perfect delight, independently  of the question of our existing to partake of it. Mankind would have  little to envy to future ages, if they had all enjoyed a serenity as  perfect as mine has been for the latter half of my existence.\"    Mr. Clare sat up through the whole day, indulging himself in easy and  cheerful exertions, which were perhaps better calculated to refresh and  invigorate the frame, than if he had sought repose in its direct form.  Now and then he was visited with a sudden pang; but it was no sooner  felt, than he seemed to rise above it, and smiled at the impotence of  these attacks. They might destroy him, but they could not disturb. Three  or four times he was bedewed with profuse sweats; and these again were  succeeded by an extreme dryness and burning heat of the skin. He was  next covered with small livid spots: symptoms of shivering followed, but  these he drove away with a determined resolution. He then became  tranquil and composed, and, after some time, decided to go to bed, it  being already night. \"Falkland,\" said he, pressing his hand, \"the task  of dying is not so difficult as some imagine. When one looks back from  the brink of it, one wonders that so total a subversion can take place  at so easy a price.\"    He had now been some time in bed, and, as every thing was still, Mr.  Falkland hoped that he slept; but in that he was mistaken. Presently Mr.  Clare threw back the curtain, and looked in the countenance of his  friend. \"I cannot sleep,\" said he. \"No, if I could sleep, it would be  the same thing as to recover; and I am destined to have the worst in  this battle.    \"Falkland, I have been thinking about you. I do not know any one whose  future usefulness I contemplate with greater hope. Take care of  yourself. Do not let the world be defrauded of your virtues. I am  acquainted with your weakness as well as your strength. You have an  impetuosity, and an impatience of imagined dishonour, that, if once set  wrong, may make you as eminently mischievous as you will otherwise be  useful. Think seriously of exterminating this error!    \"But if I cannot, in the brief expostulation my present situation will  allow, produce this desirable change in you, there is at least one thing  I can do. I can put you upon your guard against a mischief I foresee to  be imminent. Beware of Mr. Tyrrel. Do not commit the mistake of  despising him as an unequal opponent. Petty causes may produce great  mischiefs. Mr. Tyrrel is boisterous, rugged, and unfeeling; and you are  too passionate, too acutely sensible of injury. It would be truly to be  lamented, if a man so inferior, so utterly unworthy to be compared with  you, should be capable of changing your whole history into misery and  guilt. I have a painful presentiment upon my heart, as if something  dreadful would reach you from that quarter. Think of this. I exact no  promise from you. I would not shackle you with the fetters of  superstition; I would have you governed by justice and reason.\"    Mr. Falkland was deeply affected with this expostulation. His sense of  the generous attention of Mr. Clare at such a moment, was so great as  almost to deprive him of utterance. He spoke in short sentences, and  with visible effort. \"I will behave better,\" replied he. \"Never fear me!  Your admonitions shall not be thrown away upon me.\"    Mr. Clare adverted to another subject. \"I have made you my executor; you  will not refuse me this last office of friendship. It is but a short  time that I have had the happiness of knowing you; but in that short  time I have examined you well, and seen you thoroughly. Do not  disappoint the sanguine hope I have entertained!    \"I have left some legacies. My former connections, while I lived amidst  the busy haunts of men, as many of them as were intimate, are all of  them dear to me. I have not had time to summon them about me upon the  present occasion, nor did I desire it. The remembrances of me will, I  hope, answer a better purpose than such as are usually thought of on  similar occasions.\"    Mr. Clare, having thus unburthened his mind, spoke no more for several  hours. Towards morning Mr. Falkland quietly withdrew the curtain, and  looked at the dying man. His eyes were open, and were now gently turned  towards his young friend. His countenance was sunk, and of a death-like  appearance. \"I hope you are better,\" said Falkland in a half whisper, as  if afraid of disturbing him. Mr. Clare drew his hand from the  bed-clothes, and stretched it forward; Mr. Falkland advanced, and took  hold of it. \"Much better,\" said Mr. Clare, in a voice inward and hardly  articulate; \"the struggle is now over; I have finished my part;  farewell! remember!\" These were his last words. He lived still a few  hours; his lips were sometimes seen to move; he expired without a groan.    Mr. Falkland had witnessed the scene with much anxiety. His hopes of a  favourable crisis, and his fear of disturbing the last moments of his  friend, had held him dumb. For the last half hour he had stood up, with  his eyes intently fixed upon Mr. Clare. He witnessed the last gasp, the  last little convulsive motion of the frame. He continued to look; he  sometimes imagined that he saw life renewed. At length he could deceive  himself no longer, and exclaimed with a distracted accent, \"And is this  all?\" He would have thrown himself upon the body of his friend; the  attendants withheld, and would have forced him into another apartment.  But he struggled from them, and hung fondly over the bed. \"Is this the  end of genius, virtue, and excellence? Is the luminary of the world thus  for ever gone? Oh, yesterday! yesterday! Clare, why could not I have  died in your stead? Dreadful moment! Irreparable loss! Lost in the very  maturity and vigour of his mind! Cut off from a usefulness ten thousand  times greater than any he had already exhibited! Oh, his was a mind to  have instructed sages, and guided the moral world! This is all we have  left of him! The eloquence of those lips is gone! The incessant activity  of that heart is still! The best and wisest of men is gone, and the  world is insensible of its loss!\"    Mr. Tyrrel heard the intelligence of Mr. Clare's death with emotion, but  of a different kind. He avowed that he had not forgiven him his partial  attachment to Mr. Falkland, and therefore could not recall his  remembrance with kindness. But if he could have overlooked his past  injustice, sufficient care, it seems, was taken to keep alive his  resentment. \"Falkland, forsooth, attended him on his death-bed, as if  nobody else were worthy of his confidential communications.\" But what  was worst of all was this executorship. \"In every thing this pragmatical  rascal throws me behind. Contemptible wretch, that has nothing of the  man about him! Must he perpetually trample upon his betters? Is every  body incapable of saying what kind of stuff a man is made of? caught  with mere outside? choosing the flimsy before the substantial? And upon  his death-bed too? [Mr. Tyrrel with his uncultivated brutality mixed, as  usually happens, certain rude notions of religion.] Sure the sense of  his situation might have shamed him. Poor wretch! his soul has a great  deal to answer for. He has made my pillow uneasy; and, whatever may be  the consequences, it is he we have to thank for them.\"    The death of Mr. Clare removed the person who could most effectually  have moderated the animosities of the contending parties, and took away  the great operative check upon the excesses of Mr. Tyrrel. This rustic  tyrant had been held in involuntary restraint by the intellectual  ascendancy of his celebrated neighbour: and, notwithstanding the general  ferocity of his temper, he did not appear till lately to have  entertained a hatred against him. In the short time that had elapsed  from the period in which Mr. Clare had fixed his residence in the  neighbourhood, to that of the arrival of Mr. Falkland from the  Continent, the conduct of Mr. Tyrrel had even shown tokens of  improvement. He would indeed have been better satisfied not to have had  even this intruder into a circle where he had been accustomed to reign.

In this way,  we are enabled to establish its relations with well defined classes and  to put it in its proper place. Of equal importance with the analytical  method of study, however, is the synthetical. This method of research,  as applied to organic compounds, embodies in it the highest triumphs of  modern chemistry. It has been most fruitful of results, both theoretical  and practical. Within recent years, hundreds of the products of  vegetable and animal life have been built up from simpler compounds.  Thousands of valuable dye-colors and other compounds used in the arts  attest its practical value. It may, therefore, seem anomalous when I say  that one of the most important of all the classes of organic compounds  has not shared in this advance. The alkaloids, that most important class  from a medical and pharmaceutical point of view, have until quite  recently been defined in the books simply as \"vegetable bases,  containing nitrogen.\" Whether they were marsh-gas or benzol derivatives  was not made out; how the four elements, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and  nitrogen, were grouped together in them was absolutely a thing unknown.  Chemists all admitted two things--first, that their constitution was  very complex, and, second, that the synthesis of any of the more  important medicinal alkaloids would be an eminently desirable thing to  effect from every point of view. Within the last five years, however,  quite considerable progress has been made in arriving at a clearer  understanding of these most important compounds, and I shall offer to  your attention this evening a brief statement of what has been done and  what seems likely to be accomplished in the near future.    It was early recognized that the alkaloids were complex amines or  ammonia derivatives. The more or less strongly marked basic character of  these bodies, the presence of nitrogen as an essential element, and,  above all, the analogy shown to ammonia in the way these bases united  with acids to form salts, not by replacement of the hydrogen of the  acid, but by direct addition of acid and base, pointed unmistakably to  this constitution. But with this granted, the simplest alkaloid  formulas, those of conine, C_{8}H_{17}N, and nicotine,  C_{10}H_{14}N_{2}, still showed that the amine molecule contained quite  complex groups of carbon and hydrogen atoms, and the great majority of  the alkaloids--the non-volatile ones--contained groups in which the  three elements, carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, all entered. Hence the  difficulty in acquiring a knowledge of the molecular structure of those  alkaloids at all comparable with that attained in the case of other  organic compounds. Of course synthesis could not be applied until  analysis had revealed something of the molecular grouping of these  compounds, so the action of different classes of reagents was tried upon  the alkaloids. Before summarizing the results of this study of the  decomposition and alteration products of the alkaloids, a brief  reference to a related class of organic compounds will be of assistance  to those unfamiliar with recent researches in this field.    It is well known that in coal-tar is found a series of ammonia-like  bases, aniline or amido-benzol, toluidine or amido-toluol, and xylidine  or amido-xylol, which are utilized practically in the manufacture of the  so-called aniline dye-colors. It is perhaps not so well known that there  are other series of bases found there too. The first of these is the  pyridine series, including _pyridine_, C_{5}H_{5}N, _picoline_  (methyl-pyridine), C_{5}H_{4}N(CH_{3}), _lutidine_ (dimethyl-pyridine),  C_{5}H_{5}N(CH_{3})_{2}, and _collidine_ (trimethyl-pyridine),  C_{5}H_{2}N(CH_{3})_{3}. This series is also found in relatively larger  proportion in what is known as Dippel's oil, the product of the dry  distillation of bones.    The second series is the quinoline series, including _quinoline_,  C_{9}H_{7}N, _lepidine_ (methyl-quinoline), C_{10}H_{9}N, and  _cryptidine_ (dimethyl-quinoline), C_{11}H_{11}N. The two compounds  which give name to these series, pyridine, C_{5}H_{5}N, and quinoline,  C_{9}H_{7}N, respectively, bear to each other a relation analogous to  that existing between benzol, C_{6}H_{6}, and naphthalene, C_{10}H_{8};  and the theory generally accepted by those chemists who have been  occupying themselves with these bases and their derivatives is that  pyridine is simply benzol, in which an atom of nitrogen replaces the  triad group, CH, and quinoline, the naphthalene molecule with a similar  change. Indeed, Ladenberg has recently succeeded in obtaining benzol as  an alteration product from pyridine, in certain reactions. Moreover,  from methyl-pyridine, C_{5}H_{4}N(CH_{3}), would be derived an acid know  as pyridine-carboxylic acid, C_{5}H_{4}N(COOH), just as benzoic acid,  C_{6}H_{5}COOH, is derived from methyl-benzol, C_{6}H_{5}CH_{3}, and  from dimethyl-pyridine, C_{5}H_{3}N(CH_{3})_{2}, an acid known as  pyridine-dicarboxylic acid, C_{5}H_{3}N(COOH)_{2}, just as phthalic  acid, C_{6}H_{4}(COOH)_{2}, is derived from dimethyl-benzol,  C_{6}H_{4}(CH_{3})_{2}. The same thing applies to quinoline as compared  to naphthalene.    We may now look at the question of the decomposing effect of reagents  upon the alkaloids. The means which have proved most efficacious in  decomposing these bases are the action of oxidizing and reducing agents,  of bromine, of organic iodides, of concentrated acids and alkalies, and  of heat.    Taking up the volatile alkaloids, we find with regard to _conine_,  first, that the action of methyl iodide shows it to be a secondary  amine, that is, it restrains only one replaceable hydrogen atom of the  original ammonia molecule. Its formula is therefore C_{8}H_{16}NH. From  conine can be prepared methyl-conine, which also occurs in nature, and  dimethyl-conine. From this latter has been gotten a hydrocarbon,  C_{8}H_{14}, conylene, homologous with acetylene, C_{2}H_{2}. Conine, on  oxidation, yields chiefly butyric acid, but among the products of  oxidation has been found the pyridine carboxylic acid before referred  to. The formula of conine, C_{8}H_{17}N, shows it to be homologous with  piperidine, C_{5}H_{11}N, a derivative of piperine, the alkaloid of  pepper, to be spoken of later; and, just as piperidine is derived from  pyridine by the action of reducing agents, so conine is probably derived  from a propyl-pyridine. The artificial alkaloid paraconine, isomeric  with the natural conine, will be referred to later.    _Nicotine_, C_{10}H_{14}N_{2}, the next simplest in formula of the  alkaloids, is a tertiary base, that is, contains no replaceable hydrogen  atoms in its molecule. It shows very close relations to pyridine. When  nicotine vapor is passed through a red-hot tube, it yields essentially  collidine, and, with this, some pyridine, picoline, lutidine, and gases  such as hydrogen, marsh-gas, and ethylene. Heated with bromine water to  120 deg.C. it decomposes into bromoform, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and  pyridine. When its alcoholic solution is treated with ferricyanide of  potassium it is oxidized to dipyridine, C_{10}H_{10}N_{2}. Potassium  permanganate, chromic or nitric acid oxidises it to nicotinic acid,  C_{6}H_{5}NO_{2}, which is simply pyridine-carboxylic acid,  C_{5}H_{4}N(COOH), and which, distilled over quick-lime, yields  pyridine, C_{5}H_{5}N.    Turning now to the non-volatile and oxygenized bases, we take up first  the opium alkaloids. _Morphine_, C_{17}H_{19}NO_{3}, is a tertiary  amine, and appears to contain a hydroxyl group like phenols, to which  class of bodies it has some analogies, as is shown in its reaction with  ferric chloride. Its meythl ester, which can be formed from it, is  _codeine_, one of the accompanying alkaloids of opium. Besides the  methyl derivative, however, others are possible, and several have been  recently prepared, giving rise to a class of artificial alkaloids known  as _codeines_. Morphine, rapidly distilled over zinc dust, yields  phenanthren, trimethyl-amine, pyrrol, pyridine, quinoline, and other  bases. The action of strong hydrocholoric acid upon morphine changes it  into apomorphine, C_{17}H_{17}NO_{2}, by the withdrawal of a molecule of  water. Ferricyanide of potassium and caustic soda solution change  morphine into oxidimorphine, C_{34}H_{36}N_{2}O_{6}. When heated with  strong potassium hydrate, it yields methylamine.    _Narcotine_, another of the opium alkaloids, when heated with manganese  dioxide and sulphuric acid, is oxidized and splits apart into opianic  acid, C_{10}H_{10}O_{5}, and cotarnine, C_{12}H_{13}NO_{3}. This latter,  by careful oxidation, yields apophyllenic acid, C_{8}H_{7}NO_{4}, and  this, on heating with hydrochloric acid to 240 deg. C., yields  pyridine-dicarboxylic acid, C_{5}H_{9}N(COOH)_{2}. The base cotarnine  also results from the prolonged heating of narcotine with water alone.  In this case, instead of opianic acid, its reduction product meconine,  C_{10}H_{10}O_{4}, is produced.    _Meconic acid_, C_{7}H_{4}O_{7}, which is found in opium in combination  with the different bases, has also been investigated. By acting upon  meconic acid with ammonia, comenamic acid is formed, and this latter,  when heated with zinc dust, yields pyridine.    If we go now to the cinchona alkaloids, we meet with exceedingly  interesting results. _Quinine_, C_{20}H_{24}N_{2}O_{2}, when carefully  oxidized with chromic acid or potassium permanganate, yields a series of  products. First is formed quitenine, C_{19}H_{22}N_{2}O_{4}, a weak  base, then quininic acid, C_{11}H_{9}NO_{3}, then the so-called  oxycinchomeronic acid, C_{8}H_{5}N0_{6}, and finally cinchomeronic acid,  C_{7}H_{6}NO_{4}. Now the two acids last mentioned are simple  substitution products of"]]]
