If you intend to stew it,  put no more water in the pot than will barely cover the meat, and  keep it gently simmering over a slow fire for four, five, or six  hours, according to the size of the piece.      TO BROIL BEEF-STEAKS.    The best beef-steaks are those cut from the ribs or from the  inside of the sirloin. All other parts are for this purpose  comparatively hard and tough.    They should be cut about three quarters of an inch thick, and,  unless the beef is remarkably fine and tender, the steaks will be  much improved by beating them on both sides with a steak mallet,  or with a rolling-pin. Do not season them till you take them from  the fire.    Have ready on your hearth a fine bed of clear bright coals,  entirely free from smoke and ashes. Set the gridiron over the  coals in a slanting direction, that the meat may not be smoked by  the fat dropping into the fire directly under it. When the  gridiron is quite hot, rub the bars with suet, sprinkle a little  salt over the coals, and lay on the steaks. Turn them frequently  with a pair of steak-tongs, or with a knife and fork. A quarter of  an hour is generally sufficient time to broil & beef-steak. For  those who like them under-done or rare, ten or twelve minutes will  be enough.    When the fat blazes and smokes very much as it drips into the  fire, quickly remove the gridiron for a moment, till the blaze has  subsided. After they are browned, cover the upper side of the  steaks with an inverted plate or dish to prevent the flavour from  evaporating. Rub a dish with a shalot, or small onion, and place  it near the gridiron and close to the fire, that it may be well  heated. In turning the steak drop the gravy that may be standing  on it into this dish, to save it from being lost. When the steaks  are done, sprinkle them with a little salt and pepper, and lay  them in a hot dish, putting on each a piece of fresh butter. Then,  if it is liked, season them with, a very little raw shalot, minced  as finely as possible, and moistened with a spoonful of water; and  stir a tea-spoonful of catchup into the gravy. Send the steaks to  table very hot, in a covered dish. You may serve up with them  onion sauce in a small tureen.    Pickles are frequently eaten with beef-steaks.    Mutton chops may be broiled in the same manner.      TO FRY BEEF-STEAKS.    Beef-steaks for frying should be cut thinner than for broiling.  Take them from the ribs or sirloin, and remove the bone. Beat them  to make them tender. Season them with salt and pepper.    Put some fresh butter, or nice beef-dripping into a frying pan,  and hold it over a clear bright fire till it boils and has done  hissing. Then put in the steaks, and (if you like them) some  sliced onions. Fry them about a quarter of an hour, turning them  frequently. Steaks, when fried, should be thoroughly done. After  they are browned, cover them with a large plate to keep in the  juices,    Have ready a hot dish, and when they are done, take out the steaks  and onions and lay them in it with another dish on the top, to  keep them hot while you give the gravy in the pan another boil up  over the fire. You may add to it a spoonful of mushroom catchup.  Pour the gravy over the steakes, and send them to table as hot as  possible.    Mutton chops may be fried in this manner.      BEEF-STEAK PUDDING.    For a small pudding take a pound of fresh beef suet. Clear it from  the skin and the stringy fibres, and mince it as finely as  possible. Sift into a large pan two pounds of fine flour, and add  the suet gradually, rubbing it fine with your hands and mixing it  thoroughly. Then pour in, by degrees, enough of cold water to make  a stiff dough. Roll it out into a large even sheet. Have ready  about a pound and a half of the best beef-steak, omitting the bone  and fat which should be all cut off. Divide the steak into small  thin pieces, and beat them well to make them tender. Season them  with pepper and salt, and, if convenient, add some mushrooms. Lay  the beef in the middle of the sheet of paste, and put on the top a  bit of butter rolled in flour. Close the paste nicely over the  meat as if you were making a large dumpling. Dredge with flour a  thick square cloth, and tie the pudding up in it, leaving space  for it to swell. Fasten the string very firmly, and stop up with  flour the little gap at the tying-place so that no water can get  in. Have ready a large pot of boiling water. Put the pudding into  it, and let it boil fast three hours or more. Keep up a good fire  under it, as if it stops boiling a minute the crust will be heavy.  Have a kettle of boiling water at the fire to replenish the pot if  it wastes too much. Do not take up the pudding till the moment  before it goes to table. Mix some catchup with the gravy on your  plate.    For a large pudding you must have two pounds of suet, three pounds  of flour, and two pounds and a half of meat. It must boil at least  five hours.    All the fat must be removed from the meat before it goes into the  pudding, as the gravy cannot be skimmed when enclosed in the  crust.    You may boil in the pudding some potatoes cut into slices.    A pudding of the lean of mutton chops may be made in the same  manner; also of venison steaks.      A BEEF-STEAK PIE.    Make a good paste in the proportion of a pound of butter to two  pounds of sifted flour. Divide it in half, and line with one sheet  of it the bottom and sides of a deep dish, which must first be  well buttered. Have ready two pounds of the best beef-steak, cut  thin, and well beaten; the bone and fat being omitted. Season it  with pepper and salt. Spread a layer of the steak at the bottom of  the pie, and on it a layer of sliced potato, and a few small bits  of butter rolled in flour. Then another layer of meat, potato,  &c., till the dish is full. You may greatly improve the flavour by  adding mushrooms, or chopped clams or oysters, leaving out the  hard parts. If you use clams or oysters, moisten the other  ingredients with a little of their liquor. If not, pour in, at the  last, half a pint of cold water, or less if the pie is small.  Cover the pie with the other sheet of paste as a lid, and notch  the edges handsomely, having reserved a little of the paste to  make a flower or tulip to stick in the slit at the top. Bake it in  a quick oven an hour and a quarter, or longer, in proportion to  its size. Send it to table hot.    You may make a similar pie of mutton chops, or veal cutlets, or  venison steaks, always leaving out the bone and fat.    Many persons in making pies stew the meat slowly in a little water  till about half done, and they then put it with its gravy into the  paste and finish by baking. In this case add no water to the pie,  as there will be already sufficient liquid If you half-stew the  meat, do the potatoes with it.      A-LA-MODE BEEF.    Take the bone out of a round of fresh beef, and beat the meat well  all over to make it tender. Chop and mix together equal quantities  of sweet marjoram and sweet basil, the leaves picked from the  stalks and rubbed fine. Chop also some small onions or shalots,  and some parsley; the marrow from the bone of the beef; and a  quarter of a pound, or more of suet. Add two penny rolls of stale  bread grated; and pepper, salt, and nutmeg to your taste. Mix all  these ingredients well, and bind them together with the beaten  yolks of four eggs. Fill with this seasoning the place from whence  you took out the bone; and rub what is left of it all over the  outside of the meat. You must, of course, proportion the quantity  of stuffing to the size of the round of beef. Fasten it well with  skewers, and tie it round firmly with a piece of tape, so as to  keep it compact and in good shape. It is best to prepare the meat  the day before it is to be cooked.    Cover the bottom of a stew-pan with slices of bacon. Lay the beef  upon them, and cover the top of the meat with more slices of  bacon. Place round it four large onions, four carrots, and four  turnips, all cut in thick slices. Pour in from half a pint to a  pint of water, and if convenient, add two calves' feet cut in  half. Cover the pan closely, set it in an oven and let it bake for  at least six hours; or seven or eight, according to the size.    When it is thoroughly done, take out the beef and lay it on a dish  with the vegetables round it. Remove the bacon and calves' feet,  and (having skimmed the fat from the gravy carefully) strain it  into a small sauce-pan; set it on hot coals, and stir into it a  tea-cupful of port wine, and the same quantity of pickled  mushrooms. Let it just come to a boil, and then send it to table  in a sauce-tureen.    If the beef is to be eaten cold, you may ornament it as follows:--  Glaze it all over with beaten white of egg. Then cover it with a  coat of boiled potato grated finely. Have ready some slices of  cold boiled carrot, and also of beet-root. Cut them into the form  of stars or flowers, and arrange them handsomely over the top of  the meat by sticking them on the grated potato. In the centre  place a large bunch of double parsley, interspersed with flowers  cut out of raw turnips, beets, and carrots, somewhat in imitation  of white and red roses, and marygolds. Fix the flowers on wooden  skewers concealed with parsley.    Cold a-la-mode beef prepared in this manner will at a little  distance look like a large iced cake decorated with sugar flowers.    You may dress a fillet of veal according to this receipt. Of  course it will require less time to stew.      TO STEW BEEF.    Take a good piece of fresh beef. It must not be too fat. Wash it,  rub it with salt, and put it into a pot with barely sufficient  water to cover it. Set it over a slow fire, and after it has  stewed an hour, put in some potatoes pared and cut in half, and  some parsnips, scraped and split.

There were heroes of Troy  still fighting. And here and there were little altars of marble or  stone or earth or ashes with an ancient, holy statue. At every one the  procession halted. The priests poured a libation and chanted a prayer.  The people sang a hymn. Many left gifts piled about the altar. Before  Hermes Charmides left his little clay image of the god. And while  the priests prayed aloud, the boy sent up a whispered prayer for his  brother.    Once the procession came before a low, narrow temple. It was of  sun-dried bricks coated with plaster. Its columns were all different  from one another. Some were slender, others thick; some fluted, others  plain; and all were brightly painted. Charmides smiled up at his father.    \"It is not so beautiful as the Parthenon,\" he said.    \"No,\" his father answered, \"but it is very old and very holy. Every  generation of man has put a new column here. That is why they are not  alike. This is the ancient temple of Hera.\"    Then they entered the door. Down the long aisle they walked between  small open rooms on either side. Here stood statues gazing out--some of  marble, some of gold and ivory. The priests had moved to the front and  stood praying before the ancient statues of Zeus and Hera. But suddenly  Charmides stopped and would go no farther. For here, in a little room  all alone, stood his Hermes with the baby Dionysus. The boy cried out  softly with joy and crept toward the lovely thing. He gently touched the  golden sandal. He gazed into the kind blue eyes and smiled. The marble  was delicately tinted and glowed like warm skin. A frail wreath of  golden leaves lay on the curling hair. Charmides looked up at the tiny  baby and laughed at its coaxing arms.    \"Are you smiling at him?\" he whispered to Hermes. \"Or are you dreaming  of Olympos? Are you carrying him to the nymphs on Mount Nysa?\" And then  more softly still he said, \"Do not forget Creon, blessed god.\"    When his father came back he found him still gazing into the quiet face  and smiling tenderly with love of the beautiful thing. As Menon led him  away, he waved a loving farewell to the god.    The most wonderful time was after the sacrifice to Zeus before the great  temple with its deep porches and its marble watchers in the gable.  The altar was a huge pile of ashes. For hundreds of years Greeks had  sacrificed here. The holy ashes had piled up and piled up until they  stood as a hill more than twenty feet high. The people waited around the  foot of it, watching. The priests walked up its side. Men led up the  sleek cattle to be slain for the feast of the gods. And on the very top  a fire leaped toward heaven. Far up in the sky Charmides could half  see the beautiful gods leaning down and smiling upon their worshiping  people.    Then he turned and walked with the crowd under the temple porch and into  the great, dim room. He trembled and grasped his father's hand in awe.  For there in the soft light towered great Zeus. In embroidered robes of  dull gold he sat high on his golden throne. His hands held his scepter  and his messenger eagle. His great yellow curls almost touched the  ceiling. He bent his divine face down, and his deep eyes glowed upon his  people. Sweet smoke was curling upward, and the room rang with a hymn.    As Charmides gazed into the solemn face, a strange light quivered about  it, and the boy's heart shook with awe. The words of Homer sprang to his  lips:    \"Zeus bowed his head. The divine hair streamed back from the kindly  brows, and great Olympos quaked.\"    After the sacrifices were over there was time to wander again among the  statues and to sit on the benches under the cool porches and watch the  moving crowd and the glittering sun on the gold ornaments of the temple  peaks. Then there was time to see again the strange sights of the fair  in the plain. The next morning was noisier and gayer than anything  Charmides had ever known. While it was still twilight his father hurried  him down the hill and through the gates, on through the sacred enclosure  to another gate. And all about them was a hurrying, noisy crowd. They  stumbled up some steps and began to wait. As the light grew, Charmides  saw all about him men and boys, sitting or standing, and all gaily  talking. Below the crowd he saw a long, narrow stretch of ground. He  clapped his hands. That was the ground Creon's feet would run upon! Up  and down both sides of the track went long tiers of stone seats. They  were packed with people who were there to see Creon win. The seats  curved around one narrow end of the course. But across the other end  stood a wall with a gate. Menon pointed to a large white board hanging  on the wall and said, \"See! The list of athletes.\"    Here were written names, and among them, \"Creon, son of the Olympic  winner Menon.\" Charmides' eyes glowed with pride.    Every eye was watching the gate. Soon the purple-clad judges entered.  Some of them walked the whole length of the stadion and took their seats  opposite the goal posts. Two or three waited at the starting line. There  was a blast of a trumpet. Then a herald cried something about games  for boys and about only Greeks of pure blood and about the blessing of  Hermes of the race course.    Immediately there entered a crowd of boys, while the spectators sent  up a rousing cheer. The lads gathered to cast lots for places. At last  eight of them stepped out and stood at the starting line. Creon was not  among them. A post with a little fluttering flag was between every two.  The boys threw off their clothes and stood ready. One of the judges said  to them:    \"The eyes of the world are upon you. Your cities love an Olympic winner.  From Olympos the gods look down upon you. For the glory of your cities,  for the joy of your fathers, for your own good name, I exhort you to do  your best.\"    Then he gave the signal and the runners shot forward. Down the long  course they went with twinkling legs. The spectators cheered, called  their names, waved their chlamyses and himations. Their friends cried  to the gods to help. Down they ran, two far ahead, others stringing out  behind. Every runner's eyes were on the marble goal post with its little  statue of Victory. In a moment it was over, and Leotichides had first  laid hand upon the post and was winner of the first heat.    Immediately eight other boys took their places at the starting line.  Charmides snatched his father's hand and held it tight, for Creon was  one of them. Another signal and they were off, with Creon leading by  a pace or two. So it was all the way, and he gave a glad shout as he  touched the goal post.    Charmides heard men all about him say:    \"A beautiful run!\"    \"How easily he steps!\"    \"We shall see him do something in the last heat.\"    \"Who is he?\"    And when the herald announced the name of the winner, the benches buzzed  with,    \"Creon, Creon, son of Menon the Athenian.\"    Four more groups were called and ran. Then the six winners stepped up  to the line. This time the goal was the altar at the farther end of the  stadion. A wave of excitement ran around the seats. Everybody leaned  forward. The signal! Leotichides sprang a long pace ahead. Next came  Creon, loping evenly. One boy stumbled and fell behind. The other three  were running almost side by side. Menon was muttering between his teeth:    \"Hermes, be his aid! Great Zeus look upon him! Herakles give him wind!\"    Now they were near the goal, and Leotichides was still leading by a  stride. Then Creon threw back his head and stretched out his legs and  with ten great leaps he had touched the altar a good pace ahead. He had  won the race.    The crowd went wild with shouting. Menon leaped over men's heads and  went running down the course calling for his son. But the guards caught  him and forced him back upon the seats. Charmides sat down and wept for  joy. And nobody saw him, for everybody was cheering and watching the  victor.    One of the judges stepped out and gave a torch to Creon. The boy touched  the flame to the pile on the altar. As the fire sprang up, he stretched  his hands to the sky and cried,    \"O blessed Hermes, Creon will not forget thy help.\"    As he turned away the judge gave him a palm in sign of victory. The boy  walked back down the course with the palm waving over his shoulder. His  body was glistening, his cheeks were flushed, his eyes were burning  with joy. He was looking up at the crowd, hoping to see his father and  brother. And at every step men reached out a hand to him or called  to him, until at last Menon's own loving arms pulled him up upon the  benches. Then there was such a noise that no one heard any one else, but  everybody knew that everybody was happy. Men pushed their heads over  other men's shoulders, and boys peeped between their fathers' legs to  see the Olympic winner. And in that circle of faces Menon stood with  his arms about Creon, laughing and crying. And Charmides clung to his  brother's hand. But at last Creon whispered to his father:    \"I must go and make ready. I am entered for the pentathlon, also.\"    Menon cried out in wonder.    \"I kept that news for a surprise,\" laughed Creon. \"Good-by, little one,\"  he said to Charmides, and pushed through the crowd.    Menon sat down trembling. If his boy should win in the pentathlon also!  That would be too great glory. It could not happen. He began to mutter a  hundred prayers. Another race was called--the double race, twice around  the course. But Menon did not stand to see it. He could think of nothing  but his glorious son. After the race was another great shout. Some other  boy was carrying a palm. Some other father was proud. Then followed  wrestling, bout after bout, and cheering from the crowd. But Menon cared  little for it all.    It was now near noon. The sun shone down scorchingly. A wind whirled  dust up from "]]]
