On a murky morning in November, wind north-east, a poor old woman  with a wooden leg was seen struggling against the fitful gusts of the  bitter breeze, along a stony zigzag road, full of deep and irregular  cart-ruts. Her ragged petticoat was blue, and so was her wretched  nose. A stick was in her left hand, which assisted her to dig and  hobble her way along; and in her other hand, supported also beneath  her withered arm, was a large rusty iron sieve. Dust and fine ashes  filled up all the wrinkles in her face; and of these there were a  prodigious number, for she was eighty-three years old. Her name was  Peg Dotting.    About a quarter of a mile distant, having a long ditch and a  broken-down fence as a foreground, there rose against the muddled-gray  sky, a huge Dust-heap of a dirty black color, being, in fact, one  of those immense mounds of cinders, ashes, and other emptyings  from dust-holes and bins, which have conferred celebrity on certain  suburban neighborhoods of a great city. Toward this dusky mountain old  Peg Dotting was now making her way.    Advancing toward the Dust-heap by an opposite path, very narrow, and  just reclaimed from the mud by a thick layer of freshly-broken flints,  there came at the same time Gaffer Doubleyear, with his bone-bag slung  over his shoulder. The rags of his coat fluttered in the east-wind,  which also whistled keenly round his almost rimless hat, and troubled  his one eye. The other eye, having met with an accident last week, he  had covered neatly with an oyster-shell, which was kept in its place  by a string at each side, fastened through a hole. He used no staff  to help him along, though his body was nearly bent double, so that his  face was constantly turned to the earth, like that of a four-footed  creature. He was ninety-seven years of age. As these two patriarchal  laborers approached the great Dust-heap, a discordant voice hallooed  to them from the top of a broken wall. It was meant as a greeting of  the morning, and proceeded from little Jem Clinker, a poor deformed  lad, whose back had been broken when a child. His nose and chin were  much too large for the rest of his face, and he had lost nearly  all his teeth from premature decay. But he had an eye gleaming with  intelligence and life, and an expression at once patient and hopeful.  He had balanced his misshapen frame on the top of the old wall, over  which one shriveled leg dangled, as if by the weight of a hob-nailed  boot that covered a foot large enough for a plowman.    In addition to his first morning's salutation of his two aged friends,  he now shouted out in a tone of triumph and self-gratulation, in which  he felt assured of their sympathy--    \"Two white skins, and a tor'shell-un!\"    It may be requisite to state that little Jem Clinker belonged to the  dead-cat department of the Dust-heap, and now announced that a prize  of three skins, in superior condition. had rewarded him for being  first in the field.    He was enjoying a seat on the wall, in order to recover himself from  the excitement of his good fortune.    At the base of the great Dust-heap the two old people now met their  young friend--a sort of great-grandson by mutual adoption--and they  at once joined the party who had by this time assembled as usual, and  were already busy at their several occupations.    But besides all these, another individual, belonging to a very  different class, formed a part of the scene, though appearing only on  its outskirts. A canal ran along at the rear of the Dust-heap, and on  the banks of its opposite side slowly wandered by--with hands clasped  and hanging down in front of him, and eyes bent vacantly upon his  hands--the forlorn figure of a man, in a very shabby great-coat, which  had evidently once belonged to one in the position of a gentleman. And  to a gentleman it still belonged--but in _what_ a position! A scholar,  a man of wit, of high sentiment, of refinement, and a good fortune  withal--now by a sudden turn of law bereft of the last only, and  finding that none of the rest, for which (having his fortune) he  had been so much admired, enabled him to gain a livelihood. His  title-deeds had been lost or stolen, and so he was bereft of  everything he possessed. He had talents, and such as would have been  profitably available had he known how to use them for his new purpose;  but he did not; he was misdirected; he made fruitless efforts in his  want of experience; and he was now starving. As he passed the great  Dust-heap, he gave one vague, melancholy gaze that way, and then  looked wistfully into the canal. And he continued to look into the  canal as he slowly moved along, till he was out of sight.    A Dust-heap of this kind is often worth thousands of pounds. The  present one was very large and very valuable. It was in fact a large  hill, and being in the vicinity of small suburb cottages, it rose  above them like a great black mountain. Thistles, groundsel, and rank  grass grew in knots on small parts which had remained for a long time  undisturbed; crows often alighted on its top, and seemed to put on  their spectacles and become very busy and serious; flocks of sparrows  often made predatory descents upon it; an old goose and gander might  sometimes he seen following each other up its side, nearly midway;  pigs rooted around its base,--and now and then, one bolder than the  rest would venture some way up, attracted by the mixed odors of some  hidden marrow-bone enveloped in a decayed cabbage-leaf--a rare event,  both of these articles being unusual oversights of the Searchers  below.    The principal ingredient of all these Dust-heaps is fine cinders  and ashes; but as they are accumulated from the contents of all the  dust-holes and bins of the vicinity, and as many more as possible,  the fresh arrivals in their original state present very heterogeneous  materials. We cannot better describe them than by presenting a brief  sketch of the different departments of the Searchers and Sorters,  who are assembled below to busy themselves upon the mass of original  matters which are shot out from the carts of the dustmen.    The bits of coal, the pretty numerous results of accident and  servants' carelessness, are picked out, to be sold forthwith; the  largest and best of the cinders are also selected, by another party,  who sell them to laundresses, or to braziers (for whose purposes coke  would do as well;) and the next sort of cinders, called the _breeze_,  because it is left after the wind has blown the finer cinders through  an upright sieve, is sold to the brick-makers.    Two other departments, called the \"soft-ware\" and the \"hard-ware,\"  are very important. The former includes all vegetable and animal  matters--everything that will decompose. These are selected and bagged  at once, and carried off as soon as possible, to be sold as manure  for plowed land, wheat, barley, &c. Under this head, also, the dead  cats are comprised. They are generally the perquisites of the women  searchers. Dealers come to the wharf, or dust-field, every evening;  they give sixpence for a white cat, fourpence for a colored cat, and  for a black one according to her quality. The \"hard-ware\" includes all  broken pottery pans, crockery, earthenware, oyster-shells, &c., which  are sold to make new roads.    The bones are selected with care, and sold to the soap-boiler. He  boils out the fat and marrow first, for special use, and the bones are  then crushed and sold for manure.    Of rags, the woollen rags are bagged and sent off for hop-manure; the  white linen rags are washed, and sold to make paper, &c.    The \"tin things\" are collected and put into an oven with a grating at  the bottom, so that the solder which unites the parts melts, and runs  through into a receiver. This is sold separately; the detached pieces  of tin are then sold to be melted up with old iron, &c.    Bits of old brass, lead, &c., are sold to be molted up separately, or  in the mixture of ores.    All broken glass vessels, as cruets, mustard-pots, tumblers,  wine-glasses, bottles, &c., are sold to the old-glass shops.    As for any articles of jewelry, silver spoons, forks, thimbles, or  other plate and valuables, they are pocketed off-hand by the first  finder. Coins of gold and silver are often found, and many \"coppers.\"    Meantime, everybody is hard at work near the base of the great  Dust-heap. A certain number of cart-loads having been raked and  searched for all the different things just described, the whole of it  now undergoes the process of sifting. The men throw up the stuff, and  the women sift it.    \"When I was a young girl,\" said Peg Dotting--    \"That's a long while ago, Peggy,\" interrupted one of the sifters: but  Peg did not hear her.    \"When I was quite a young thing,\" continued she, addressing old John  Doubleyear, who threw up the dust into her sieve, \"it was the fashion  to wear pink roses in the shoes, as bright as that morsel of ribbon  Sally has just picked out of the dust; yes, and sometimes in the  hair, too, on one side of the head, to set off the white powder and  salve-stuff. I never wore one of these head-dresses myself--don't  throw up the dust so high, John--but I lived only a few doors lower  down from those as did. Don't throw up the dust so high, I tell  'ee--the wind takes it into my face.\"    \"Ah! There! What's that?\" suddenly exclaimed little Jem, running as  fast as his poor withered legs would allow him toward a fresh heap,  which had just been shot down on the wharf from a dustman's cart.

Its value is not confined to the purposes of those  who would make themselves acquainted with Mahometan jurisprudence  in the peculiar form it assumed in India. It is highly esteemed  throughout Islam, and is quoted even by the doctors of Mecca as the  Futawa-i-hind, or the Indian _responsa prudentum_. It was compiled by  the orders of the Emperor Aurungzebe. It is a digest of the \"Futawa\"  of the most celebrated jurists of the Hanifeh (or, as Mr. Baillie  spells it, _Hunefeeah_) sect or school. Mr. Baillie informs us in  his preface, that \"_futawa_ is the plural form of _futwa_, a term in  common use in Mahometan countries to signify an exposition of law by a  public officer called the _mooftee_, or a case submitted to him by the  _kazee_ or judge.\" The \"futwa,\" therefore, seems to correspond not  so much with our English \"decisions\" or \"precedents\" as with the  \"responsa prudentum,\" that fertile source of doctrines in the Roman  law. The \"Futawa Alumgeeree\" consequently resembles the Pandects  of Justinian in being a systematical arrangement of selections from  juridical authorities--compiled by Imperial authority; but differs  from it in this, that the selections are made exclusively from the  \"responsa prudentum,\" and a few legal treatises, whereas Justinian's  digest combined with those excerpts from judicial decisions,  praetorian edicts, &c. With this distinction, we may regard the \"Futawa  Alumgeeree\" as the Pandects or Digest of Mahometan Law. As in the  Roman work of that name, to each extract is appended the name of the  original work from which it is taken; and the whole of them are so  arranged as to form a complete digest of Mahometan law.    A work of this kind is invaluable to the student who would make  himself master of Mahometan jurisprudence as a system. But great care  must be taken not to misapprehend the exact nature of the knowledge  to be obtained from it. The \"Futawa Alumgeeree\" is a systematic  exposition of the principles of Mahometan law; it assuredly does not  enable us to ascertain what doctrines of that law are now of legal  force in India, or even what doctrines have at any time had force  in India. It does not appear to have been Aurungzebe's intention to  promulgate it as a code, but to present it to lawyers as a complete  text-book. Even if he did by ordinance attribute to it the power of  law, such ordinance was only effectual at any time in the provinces of  the Mogul Empire; and since the disruption of that empire, it has been  superseded and modified by laws and the practice of law-courts in the  various independent states erected on its ruins.    Again the general scholar must be on his guard against the delusion  that he will find in this digest materials illustrative of the social  condition of India under the Mogul dynasty. The juridical works  excerpted in it are almost all foreign to Hindostan; the special cases  illustrative of abstract doctrines are taken from other countries,  and many of them from ages antecedent to the invasion of India by the  Moguls.    Though Persian was the court language of the Mogul dynasty, there is  scarcely any Persian element in Aurungzebe's legal compilation. The  Shiite views of jurisprudence, as of theology, prevailed in Persia;  the \"Futawa Alumgeeree\" is strictly Sunnite. It is not difficult to  account for this.--The Mahometan conquerors of India were mainly of  Turkish or Tartar race; they came from Turan, a region which from time  immemorial has stood in antagonistic relations to Iran or Persia. This  may account for the fact that the races of Turan which have embraced  Mahometanism have uniformly adhered to the Sunnite sect--the sect  most hostile to the Persian Shias--not only when they settled in the  countries where the Sunnite sect originated, but when they remained in  their native regions. The views of the Sunnites were first promulgated  and have prevailed most extensively in those regions of Islam which  were once part of the Roman empire, which nominally at least was  Christian; those of the Shiites, in the countries where, under the  Sassanides and Arsacidae, the doctrines of Zoroaster predominated. The  Euphrates forms pretty nearly the line of demarkation between them.    The Caliphs dominated over both countries and over both sects. Under  their orthodox protection the Sunnite doctrines were able to strike  root in Balkh and Samarkand--the ancient Turan, and therefore hostile  to Iran and Persia. When Islam was reorganized after the anarchy which  ensued upon the overthrow of the Caliphs, Persia became the appanage  of the Sophis or Shiite dynasty; the regions to the West of the  Euphrates--the ci-devant Roman Empire--acknowledged the rule of  the Turkish dynasties, which were Sunnite. On the Oxus and further  East--the old Turan--the Sunnite sect was sufficiently strong to defy  the efforts of the Shiite sovereigns of Persia to eradicate it. The  doctors of Samarkand and Bokhara continued (and continue) as orthodox  Sunnites as those of Kufah, Mecca, and Stamboul.    Accordingly, we find the authorities excerpted in the \"Futawa  Alumgeeree\" consist almost exclusively of two classes; they are either  the immediate disciples of Hanifa at Kufah and Bagdad, or the jurists  of Samarkand and Bokhara. The law-cases they expounded are such as had  originated, or might have originated, in those countries--in Babylonia  or Turan. And they are for the most part taken from a state of  society, and illustrative of social relations, which prevailed in  these countries at a period long antecedent to that of Aurunzebe. To  attempt to illustrate the civil and social condition of India, under  that Emperor by their aid, would be as preposterous as to attempt to  illustrate the civil and social condition of those parts of Germany  where the Roman law still possesses authority from cases recorded in  the Pandects of Justinian.    The real use and value of the \"Futawa Alumgeeree\" may be briefly  explained. In every country in Europe where the Roman law is still  recognized as more or less authoritative--and indeed in every country  where the common law has borrowed more or less from the Roman--an  acquaintance with the system of Roman jurisprudence as it is embodied  in the law-books of Justinian has its value for the scientific lawyer.  In like manner a knowledge of Mahometan jurisprudence as embodied in  the \"Futawa Alumgeeree\" cannot fail to be instructive for the lawyers  of all the countries of Islam, and the lawyers of India, where so much  of the existing practical law has been derived from that source. To  the general scholar who wishes to master the civil history of Arabia  and Babylonia, in which the Sunnite sect, and more particularly the  Hanifite subdivision of it, originated, or to familiarize himself  with the moral theories which regulate the judgments and actions of  the modern Turks, Turcomans, Arabians, and Egyptians, the digest of  Aurungzeebee is also a valuable repertory of facts and illustrations.    For this reason we incline to be of opinion that Mr. Baillie is  mistaken in thinking that a selection from the two books of the  \"Futawa Alumgeeree,\" which embrace the subject of \"sale\" can have much  utility for Indian practitioners. It does not follow, because a legal  doctrine is declared sound in this work, that it is or ever has been  practically applicable in India. As an authoritative declaration of  legal doctrines, the book is as likely to mislead as to guide aright.  On the other hand, as an exposition of the general principles of  Mahometan law, even with regard to sale, it is necessarily imperfect.  The work from which it is taken is a collection of legal opinions,  which had in their day the force of judicial decisions--of something  equivalent to the \"responsa prudentum\" of Roman jurisprudence. Each is  expounded on its own merits; and all the special doctrines involved  in it are laid down. Hence it comes, that much that is calculated  to throw light on the principles of the law of sale must be sought  under other heads; and that much included in the chapters ostensibly  treating of sale refers to other topics. As part of an entire digest  of the law compiled on the same principle as that of Justinian,  the two books relating to sale are sufficient; but for an isolated  treatise on \"sale,\" they contain at once too much and too little.    Nevertheless, we welcome Mr. Baillie's publication as a valuable  addition to juridical and even to general literature. The translation,  though not by any means free from defects, is the best specimen of  a really good Mahometan law-book that has yet been published. The  defects to which we allude are twofold. In the first place, though Mr.  Baillie mentions that in the original the name of the treatise from  which it is taken is appended to every excerpt, he has not in his  translation given those references. His work is not therefore what  the original is, a Chrestomathia of the best Arabian jurists--a  succedaneum for their complete works--an illustration of Arabic legal  literature. Again, he is often loose and vacillating in the use of  the English words he has selected as corresponding to the technical  phraseology of the Arabian jurists, and sometimes infelicitous in the  selection of his English terms. It has occurred to us that he would  have succeeded better in rendering the exact meaning of his originals,  had he availed himself more of technical phrases of the Roman law  which are familiar to all European jurists. Is does not occur to  us that he would by doing so have been in danger of Romanizing the  Mahometan to an extent that might mislead. Mill, in his History of  British India, has noticed how closely the classification of the  Mahometan approaches to that of the Roman jurists. An "]]]
