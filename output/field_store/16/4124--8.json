[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11115"],[0,"Frank Merriwell at Yale; Or, Freshman Against Freshman (#12)"],[1,"was one of the hardest men  who ever entered Yale. He is a natural athlete, but he's lazy, and he  has allowed himself to become soft. Why, he knocked out Kid Lajoie, the  professional, in a hard-glove contest of three rounds. Lajoie was easy  fruit for him. I fancy he means to go up against this fresh duck  Merriwell and do him. That's the only thing that will pull Merriwell off  his perch. He doesn't mind being hazed.\"    \"Doesn't mind it!\" shouted Horner. \"Confound him! He always manages to  turn the tables in some way, and hazes the parties who try to haze him.\"    Two youths came in from the front room.    \"Hey, Browning! Hello, King! Come join us. You, too, Emery\"--to the  other fellow. \"What'll you have, Browning?\"    Browning accepted a seat at the table, but waved his hand languidly as  he declined to drink.    \"I'm not taking anything now,\" he said.    \"Oh, but you must! Have some ale, old man.\"    \"Excuse me, gentlemen. I tell you squarely that I am not taking anything  just now. By and by I will be with you again. Emery will go you one.  That's what he came in for.\"    \"That's right,\" declared Browning's companion. \"I was out stargazing  last night. Looked at the Long-Handled Dipper a long time, and it gave  me an awful thirst. I've had it with me all day. Yes, mine's ale.\"    So another round was ordered. Horner passed around the cigarettes, and  Browning declined them. The others lighted up fresh ones.    \"Say,\" broke out Emery, suddenly, \"do you know that fresh Ditson gives  me that tired feeling?\"    Tad Horner grinned.    \"He's no good,\" said Tad. \"He is crooked and he's a toucher. Touched me  for a V once, and I am looking for that fiver yet. That was two years  ago, before I came here. I knew him then.\"    \"He tried to touch us for a drink as we came along,\" said Browning. \"I  took him in here once, but I've been sorry ever since. He said he had  his thirst with him just now. I told him to go sit on the fence and let  the wind blow him off.\"    \"And he is a big bluff,\" asserted Emery. \"The other day he was telling  how he once sat at the table with kings and queens. I told him that I  had--and with jacks and ten spots. Here comes the amber. My! I won't do  a thing to it!\"    The waiter placed the glasses of ale before them, and Emery eagerly  grasped his.    \"Here's more to-morrow,\" was his toast, and he seemed to toss it off at  a single swallow.    \"By Jawve!\" drawled Paulding. \"You must be thirsty!\"    \"I am. Have been all day, as I said before. It was hard stuff last  night, and we went the rounds. My head needed hooping when I arose from  my downy couch this morning.\"    \"Well, you shouldn't have gotten intoxicated, in the first place,\" said  Parker.    \"I didn't. It was in the last place. If I'd gone home before we struck  that joint I'd been all right.\"    \"Wow!\" whooped Tad Horner. \"You seem full of 'em!\"    \"Oh, I am. I've been eating nothing but red pepper lately, and I'm hot  stuff. Let's have another one all around.\"    More ale was ordered.    \"Your neck must be dry enough to squeak, old man,\" said Parker,  addressing Browning. \"It doesn't seem natural for you to go thirsty.  Won't you have just one?\"    \"Not one,\" smiled Bruce, lazily. \"I've got too much flesh on me now, and  I'm trying to get some of it off.\"    \"Going to try for the football team--or what?\"    \"Nothing of that sort--but I have a reason.\"    \"We know.\"    \"You do?\"    \"Sure.\"    \"What is it?\"    \"You're laying for Merriwell, and you mean to do him. I am right, am I  not?\"    The king of the sophomores smiled in a lazy way, but did not reply.    \"That settles it,\" laughed Parker. \"I knew I was right. Well, somebody  must curry that young colt down and it must be done right away.\"    Browning showed sudden animation. He looked around at the faces of his  companions and then said:    \"This crowd is straight, and I am going to make a few remarks right here  and now. I feel just like it.\"    \"Drive ahead.\" \"Go on.\" \"We are listening.\"    \"I am not inclined to talk this matter over publicly,\" said Bruce, \"but  I will say that the time is ripe to get after these confounded freshmen,  and we must do it. I want to tell you what I found this morning. Open  wide your ears and listen to this.\"    His companions were quite prepared to listen.    \"You know I am getting up every morning and taking a stiff walk. I turn  out at daybreak.\"    \"Good gracious!\" gasped Tad Horner. \"How do you do it?\"    \"Well, I've got one of those electric alarm clocks, and I put it just as  far away from my bed as possible.\"    \"Why is that?\"    \"So I won't get hold of it and smash thunder out of the thing when it  gets to going. You know it won't stop its racket till somebody stops it  or it is run down, and it takes an hour for it to run down after it  starts in to ring you up.\"    \"By Jawve!\" drawled Paulding; \"I hawdly think I'd like to have one of  the blooming things in my room.\"    \"I don't like to have one in my room, but it is absolutely necessary  that I do. Hartwick, my roommate, admires it!\"    The listeners laughed.    \"I should think he might,\" said Puss Parker. \"He's got a temper with an  edge like a cold-chisel.\"    \"Oh, yes, he admires it! I've got so I believe I should sleep right  through the racket, but he kicks me out of bed and howls for me to  smother the thing. So you see I am bound to get up at the proper time.  Once I am out of bed, I stay up. The first morning after I bought the  clock the thing went off just as it was beginning to break day. I got up  and stopped it and then went back to bed. Hartwick growled, but we both  went to sleep. I had been snoozing about five minutes when the clock  broke loose once more. Hartwick was mad, you bet! I opened my eyes just  in time to see him sit up in bed with one of his shoes in his hand.  Whiz! Before I could stop him he flung the shoe at the clock. I made a  wild grab just as he did so, struck his arm, and disconcerted his aim.  The shoe flew off sideways and smashed a mirror. Hartwick said several  things. Then I got up and stopped the clock again. I dressed and went  out for my walk, leaving Hartwick in bed, sleeping sweetly. When I came  back I found him, about half dressed, jumping wildly up and down in the  middle of the bed, upon which was heaped all the bedclothes, all of  Hartwick's clothes except those he had on, all of mine, except those I  was wearing, and as I appeared he shrieked for me to tear down the  window shades and pass them to him quick.    \"'What's the matter?' I gasped. 'Are you mad?'    \"'Yes, I am mad!' he howled, tearing his hair. 'I am so blamed mad that  I don't know where I am at!'    \"'But what's the matter?'    \"'Matter! Matter! Hear it! Hear the daddly thing! It has driven me to  the verge of insanity! I tried to stop it, but I couldn't find how it  works. And now I am trying to stifle it! Hear it! Oh, bring me a club!  Bring me something deadly! Bring me a gun, and I will shoot it full of  holes!'    \"Then I found that I could hear my clock merrily rattling away under  that heap of clothes. It seemed to be defying Hartwick or laughing at  him.    \"I got him off the bed, pawed around till I found the clock between the  mattresses, and then stopped it. Hartwick offered me three times what it  was worth if I'd let him use his baseball bat on it. I told him it  seemed to be a very willing and industrious alarm clock, and it was  mine. I warned him to injure it at his peril. Since then I have learned  how to stop it so it will stay stopped, but it barely commences to  rattle at daybreak when I feel Hartwick's feet strike me in the small of  the back, and I land sprawling on the floor. That explains how I succeed  in getting up at daybreak.\"    \"You started in to tell us what you found this morning,\" said Punch  Swallows, to Browning, lighting a fresh cigarette.    \"So I did, and the alarm clock ran me off the trail. Well, I got up this  morning as usual--when Hartwick kicked me out to stop the clock. I went  out for my walk and crossed the campus. What do you think I found?\"    \"A diamond ring. We'll all have ale.\"    \"Oh, no, Tad, it wasn't a diamond ring. I noticed something stuck up on  one of the trees. It was a big sheet of paper, and on it was skillfully  lettered these words:    \"'Bruce Browning will wear a new set of false teeth to chapel to-morrow  morning.'\"    Browning stopped and looked around. He was very proud of his even,  regular, white teeth. They were so perfect that they might be taken for  \"store teeth\" at first glance, but a second look would show they were  natural.    The sophs laughed, and Bruce looked indignant.    \"That caused me to look still further,\" he went on, \"and I soon found  another sheet upon another tree. This is what I read:    \"'Conundrum. Why is King Browning a great electrician? Because all his  clothes are charged.'    \"By that time I felt like murdering somebody. I did take a morning walk,  but it was in search of more stuff of the same order. I found it  everywhere in the vicinity of the college, and some of the stuff was  simply awful. It made me shudder. I knew who was back of it all.  Merriwell put up the job.\"    \"But you outwitted him by getting around in time to tear down everything  he had put up. You matched him that time.\"    \"By accident. But I must more than match him. He must be suppressed.\"    \"That's right! that's right!\" cried the boys in chorus.    \"I know he put the advertisement for black and white cats and yellow  dogs in the papers. My name was signed to it, and more than two hundred  black and white cats and yellow dogs were brought me by parties anxious  to sell them at any price. One time there were seven women with cats in  my room, when two men came up leading dogs. The first woman had managed  to get into the room, and while I was arguing with her, trying to  convince her that I did not want her blamed old cat, the others found  their way in. They opened on me altogether."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1112"],[0,"The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet (#12)"],[1,"!      My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest      That God had lent us but this only child;      But now I see this one is one too much,      And that we have a curse in having her.      Out on her, hilding!      Nurse. God in heaven bless her!      You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.      Cap. And why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue,      Good Prudence. Smatter with your gossips, go!      Nurse. I speak no treason.      Cap. O, God-i-god-en!      Nurse. May not one speak?      Cap. Peace, you mumbling fool!      Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl,      For here we need it not.      Lady. You are too hot.      Cap. God's bread I it makes me mad. Day, night, late, early,      At home, abroad, alone, in company,      Waking or sleeping, still my care hath been      To have her match'd; and having now provided      A gentleman of princely parentage,      Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,      Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,      Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man-      And then to have a wretched puling fool,      A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,      To answer 'I'll not wed, I cannot love;      I am too young, I pray you pardon me'!      But, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you.      Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.      Look to't, think on't; I do not use to jest.      Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:      An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;      An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,      For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,      Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.      Trust to't. Bethink you. I'll not be forsworn.         Exit.      Jul. Is there no pity sitting in the clouds      That sees into the bottom of my grief?      O sweet my mother, cast me not away!      Delay this marriage for a month, a week;      Or if you do not, make the bridal bed      In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.      Lady. Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word.      Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.            Exit.      Jul. O God!- O nurse, how shall this be prevented?      My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.      How shall that faith return again to earth      Unless that husband send it me from heaven      By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me.      Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems      Upon so soft a subject as myself!      What say'st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?      Some comfort, nurse.      Nurse. Faith, here it is.      Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing      That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;      Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.      Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,      I think it best you married with the County.      O, he's a lovely gentleman!      Romeo's a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,      Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye      As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,      I think you are happy in this second match,      For it excels your first; or if it did not,      Your first is dead- or 'twere as good he were      As living here and you no use of him.      Jul. Speak'st thou this from thy heart?      Nurse. And from my soul too; else beshrew them both.      Jul. Amen!      Nurse. What?      Jul. Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.      Go in; and tell my lady I am gone,      Having displeas'd my father, to Laurence' cell,      To make confession and to be absolv'd.      Nurse. Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.           Exit.      Jul. Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!      Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,      Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue      Which she hath prais'd him with above compare      So many thousand times? Go, counsellor!      Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.      I'll to the friar to know his remedy.      If all else fail, myself have power to die.            Exit.          ACT IV. Scene I.  Friar Laurence's cell.    Enter Friar, [Laurence] and County Paris.        Friar. On Thursday, sir? The time is very short.      Par. My father Capulet will have it so,      And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.      Friar. You say you do not know the lady's mind.      Uneven is the course; I like it not.      Par. Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,      And therefore have I little talk'd of love;      For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.      Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous      That she do give her sorrow so much sway,      And in his wisdom hastes our marriage      To stop the inundation of her tears,      Which, too much minded by herself alone,      May be put from her by society.      Now do you know the reason of this haste.      Friar. [aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.-      Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.                        Enter Juliet.        Par. Happily met, my lady and my wife!      Jul. That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.      Par. That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.      Jul. What must be shall be.      Friar. That's a certain text.      Par. Come you to make confession to this father?      Jul. To answer that, I should confess to you.      Par. Do not deny to him that you love me.      Jul. I will confess to you that I love him.      Par. So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.      Jul. If I do so, it will be of more price,      Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.      Par. Poor soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears.      Jul. The tears have got small victory by that,      For it was bad enough before their spite.      Par. Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.      Jul. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;      And what I spake, I spake it to my face.      Par. Thy face is mine, and thou hast sland'red it.      Jul. It may be so, for it is not mine own.      Are you at leisure, holy father, now,      Or shall I come to you at evening mass      Friar. My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.      My lord, we must entreat the time alone.      Par. God shield I should disturb devotion!      Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.      Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.             Exit.      Jul. O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so,      Come weep with me- past hope, past cure, past help!      Friar. Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;      It strains me past the compass of my wits.      I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,      On Thursday next be married to this County.      Jul. Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,      Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.      If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,      Do thou but call my resolution wise      And with this knife I'll help it presently.      God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;      And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's seal'd,      Shall be the label to another deed,      Or my true heart with treacherous revolt      Turn to another, this shall slay them both.      Therefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time,      Give me some present counsel; or, behold,      'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife      Shall play the empire, arbitrating that      Which the commission of thy years and art      Could to no issue of true honour bring.      Be not so long to speak. I long to die      If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.      Friar. Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,      Which craves as desperate an execution      As that is desperate which we would prevent.      If, rather than to marry County Paris      Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,      Then is it likely thou wilt undertake      A thing like death to chide away this shame,      That cop'st with death himself to scape from it;      And, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.      Jul. O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,      From off the battlements of yonder tower,      Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk      Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears,      Or shut me nightly in a charnel house,      O'ercover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,      With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;      Or bid me go into a new-made grave      And hide me with a dead man in his shroud-      Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble-      And I will do it without fear or doubt,      To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.      Friar. Hold, then. Go home, be merry, give consent      To marry Paris. Wednesday is to-morrow.      To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;      Let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.      Take thou this vial, being then in bed,      And this distilled liquor drink thou off;      When presently through all thy veins shall run      A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse      Shall keep his native progress, but surcease;      No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;      The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade      To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall      Like death when he shuts up the day of life;      Each part, depriv'd of supple government,      Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death;      And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death      Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours,      And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.      Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes      To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.      Then, as the manner of our country is,      In thy best robes uncovered on the bier      Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault      Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.      In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,      Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift;      And hither shall he come; and he and I      Will watch thy waking, and that very night      Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.      And this shall free thee from this present shame,      If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear      Abate thy valour in the acting "]]]
