These flags of armies overthrown--  Flags fallen beneath the sovereign one  In end foredoomed which closes war;  We here, the captors, lay before    The altar which of right claims all--  Our Country. And as freely we,    Revering ever her sacred call,  Could lay our lives down--though life be  Thrice loved and precious to the sense  Of such as reap the recompense    Of life imperiled for just cause--  Imperiled, and yet preserved;  While comrades, whom Duty as strongly nerved,  Whose wives were all as dear, lie low.  But these flags given, glad we go    To waiting homes with vindicated laws.        The Returned Volunteer to his Rifle.      Over the hearth--my father's seat--    Repose, to patriot-memory dear,  Thou tried companion, whom at last I greet    By steepy banks of Hudson here.  How oft I told thee of this scene--  The Highlands blue--the river's narrowing sheen.  Little at Gettysburg we thought  To find such haven; but God kept it green.  Long rest! with belt, and bayonet, and canteen.          The Scout toward Aldie.      The cavalry-camp lies on the slope    Of what was late a vernal hill,  But now like a pavement bare--  An outpost in the perilous wilds    Which ever are lone and still;      But Mosby's men are there--      Of Mosby best beware.    Great trees the troopers felled, and leaned    In antlered walls about their tents;  Strict watch they kept; 'twas _Hark!_ and _Mark!_  Unarmed none cared to stir abroad    For berries beyond their forest-fence:      As glides in seas the shark,      Rides Mosby through green dark.    All spake of him, but few had seen    Except the maimed ones or the low;  Yet rumor made him every thing--  A farmer--woodman--refugee--    The man who crossed the field but now;      A spell about his life did cling--      Who to the ground shall Mosby bring?    The morning-bugles lonely play,    Lonely the evening-bugle calls--  Unanswered voices in the wild;  The settled hush of birds in nest    Becharms, and all the wood enthralls:      Memory's self is so beguiled      That Mosby seems a satyr's child.    They lived as in the Eerie Land--    The fire-flies showed with fairy gleam;  And yet from pine-tops one might ken  The Capitol dome--hazy--sublime--    A vision breaking on a dream:      So strange it was that Mosby's men      Should dare to prowl where the Dome was seen.    A scout toward Aldie broke the spell.--    The Leader lies before his tent  Gazing at heaven's all-cheering lamp  Through blandness of a morning rare;    His thoughts on bitter-sweets are bent:      His sunny bride is in the camp--      But Mosby--graves are beds of damp!    The trumpet calls; he goes within;    But none the prayer and sob may know:  Her hero he, but bridegroom too.  Ah, love in a tent is a queenly thing,    And fame, be sure, refines the vow;      But fame fond wives have lived to rue,      And Mosby's men fell deeds can do.    _Tan-tara! tan-tara! tan-tara!_    Mounted and armed he sits a king;  For pride she smiles if now she peep--  Elate he rides at the head of his men;    He is young, and command is a boyish thing:      They file out into the forest deep--      Do Mosby and his rangers sleep?    The sun is gold, and the world is green,    Opal the vapors of morning roll;  The champing horses lightly prance--  Full of caprice, and the riders too    Curving in many a caricole.      But marshaled soon, by fours advance--      Mosby had checked that airy dance.    By the hospital-tent the cripples stand--    Bandage, and crutch, and cane, and sling,  And palely eye the brave array;  The froth of the cup is gone for them    (Caw! caw! the crows through the blueness wing);      Yet these were late as bold, as gay;      But Mosby--a clip, and grass is hay.    How strong they feel on their horses free,    Tingles the tendoned thigh with life;  Their cavalry-jackets make boys of all--  With golden breasts like the oriole;    The chat, the jest, and laugh are rife.      But word is passed from the front--a call      For order; the wood is Mosby's hall.    To which behest one rider sly    (Spurred, but unarmed) gave little heed--  Of dexterous fun not slow or spare,  He teased his neighbors of touchy mood,    Into plungings he pricked his steed:      A black-eyed man on a coal-black mare,      Alive as Mosby in mountain air.    His limbs were long, and large and round;    He whispered, winked--did all but shout:  A healthy man for the sick to view;  The taste in his mouth was sweet at morn;    Little of care he cared about.      And yet of pains and pangs he knew--      In others, maimed by Mosby's crew.    The Hospital Steward--even he    (Sacred in person as a priest),  And on his coat-sleeve broidered nice  Wore the caduceus, black and green.    No wonder he sat so light on his beast;      This cheery man in suit of price      Not even Mosby dared to slice.    They pass the picket by the pine    And hollow log--a lonesome place;  His horse adroop, and pistol clean;  'Tis cocked--kept leveled toward the wood;    Strained vigilance ages his childish face.      Since midnight has that stripling been      Peering for Mosby through the green.    Splashing they cross the freshet-flood,    And up the muddy bank they strain;  A horse at the spectral white-ash shies--  One of the span of the ambulance,    Black as a hearse. They give the rein:      Silent speed on a scout were wise,      Could cunning baffle Mosby's spies.    Rumor had come that a band was lodged    In green retreats of hills that peer  By Aldie (famed for the swordless charge[22]).  Much store they'd heaped of captured arms    And, peradventure, pilfered cheer;      For Mosby's lads oft hearts enlarge      In revelry by some gorge's marge.    \"Don't let your sabres rattle and ring;    To his oat-bag let each man give heed--  There now, that fellow's bag's untied,  Sowing the road with the precious grain.    Your carbines swing at hand--you need!      Look to yourselves, and your nags beside,      Men who after Mosby ride.\"    Picked lads and keen went sharp before--    A guard, though scarce against surprise;  And rearmost rode an answering troop,  But flankers none to right or left.    No bugle peals, no pennon flies:      Silent they sweep, and fail would swoop      On Mosby with an Indian whoop.    On, right on through the forest land,    Nor man, nor maid, nor child was seen--  Not even a dog. The air was still;  The blackened hut they turned to see,    And spied charred benches on the green;      A squirrel sprang from the rotting mill      Whence Mosby sallied late, brave blood to spill.    By worn-out fields they cantered on--    Drear fields amid the woodlands wide;  By cross-roads of some olden time,  In which grew groves; by gate-stones down--    Grassed ruins of secluded pride:      A strange lone land, long past the prime,      Fit land for Mosby or for crime.    The brook in the dell they pass. One peers    Between the leaves: \"Ay, there's the place--  There, on the oozy ledge--'twas there  We found the body (Blake's you know);    Such whirlings, gurglings round the face--      Shot drinking! Well, in war all's fair--      So Mosby says. The bough--take care!\"    Hard by, a chapel. Flower-pot mould    Danked and decayed the shaded roof;  The porch was punk; the clapboards spanned  With ruffled lichens gray or green;    Red coral-moss was not aloof;      And mid dry leaves green dead-man's-hand      Groped toward that chapel in Mosby-land.    They leave the road and take the wood,    And mark the trace of ridges there--  A wood where once had slept the farm--  A wood where once tobacco grew    Drowsily in the hazy air,      And wrought in all kind things a calm--      Such influence, Mosby! bids disarm.    To ease even yet the place did woo--    To ease which pines unstirring share,  For ease the weary horses sighed:  Halting, and slackening girths, they feed,    Their pipes they light, they loiter there;      Then up, and urging still the Guide,      On, and after Mosby ride.    This Guide in frowzy coat of brown,    And beard of ancient growth and mould,  Bestrode a bony steed and strong,  As suited well with bulk he bore--    A wheezy man with depth of hold      Who jouncing went. A staff he swung--      A wight whom Mosby's wasp had stung.    Burnt out and homeless--hunted long!    That wheeze he caught in autumn-wood  Crouching (a fat man) for his life,  And spied his lean son 'mong the crew    That probed the covert. Ah! black blood      Was his 'gainst even child and wife--      Fast friends to Mosby. Such the strife.    A lad, unhorsed by sliding girths,    Strains hard to readjust his seat  Ere the main body show the gap  'Twixt them and the read-guard; scrub-oaks near    He sidelong eyes, while hands move fleet;      Then mounts and spurs. One drop his cap--      \"Let Mosby fine!\" nor heeds mishap.    A gable time-stained peeps through trees:    \"You mind the fight in the haunted house?  That's it; we clenched them in the room--  An ambuscade of ghosts, we thought,    But proved sly rebels on a house!      Luke lies in the yard.\" The chimneys loom:      Some muse on Mosby--some on doom.    Less nimbly now through brakes they wind,    And ford wild creeks where men have drowned;  They skirt the pool, a void the fen,  And so till night, when down they lie,    They steeds still saddled, in wooded ground:      Rein in hand they slumber then,      Dreaming of Mosby's cedarn den.    But Colonel and Major friendly sat    Where boughs deformed low made a seat.  The Young Man talked (all sworded and spurred)  Of the partisan's blade he longed to win,    And frays in which he meant to beat.      The grizzled Major smoked, and heard:      \"But what's that--Mosby?\" \"No, a bird.\"    A contrast here like sire and son,    Hope and Experience sage did meet;  The Youth was brave, the Senior too;  But through the Seven Days one had served,    And"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1239"],[0,"The Spirit of the Border: A Romance of the Early Settlers in the Ohio Valley (#12)"],[1,"a snake, had brushed it. Other ferns  moved, their tops agitated, perhaps, by a faint breeze. No; that  wavering line came straight toward him; it could not be the wind; it  marked the course of a creeping, noiseless thing. It must be a  panther crawling nearer and nearer.    Joe opened his lips to awaken his captors, but could not speak; it  was as if his heart had stopped beating. Twenty feet away the ferns  were parted to disclose a white, gleaming face, with eyes that  seemingly glittered. Brawny shoulders were upraised, and then a  tall, powerful man stood revealed. Lightly he stepped over the  leaves into the little glade. He bent over the sleeping Indians.  Once, twice, three times a long blade swung high. One brave  shuddered another gave a sobbing gasp, and the third moved two  fingers--thus they passed from life to death.    \"Wetzel!\" cried Joe.    \"I reckon so,\" said the deliverer, his deep, calm voice contrasting  strangely with what might have been expected from his aspect. Then,  seeing Joe's head covered with blood, he continued: \"Able to get  up?\"    \"I'm not hurt,\" answered Joe, rising when his bonds had been cut.    \"Brothers, I reckon?\" Wetzel said, bending over Jim.    \"Yes, we're brothers. Wake up, Jim, wake up! We're saved!\"    \"What? Who's that?\" cried Jim, sitting up and staring at Wetzel.    \"This man has saved our lives! See, Jim, the Indians are dead! And,  Jim, it's Wetzel, the hunter. You remember, Jeff Lynn said I'd know  him if I ever saw him and---\"    \"What happened to Jeff?\" inquired Wetzel, interrupting. He had  turned from Jim's grateful face.    \"Jeff was on the first raft, and for all we know he is now safe at  Fort Henry. Our steersman was shot, and we were captured.\"    \"Has the Shawnee anythin' ag'inst you boys?\"    \"Why, yes, I guess so. I played a joke on him--took his shirt and  put it on another fellow.\"    \"Might jes' as well kick an' Injun. What has he ag'in you?\"    \"I don't know. Perhaps he did not like my talk to him,\" answered  Jim. \"I am a preacher, and have come west to teach the gospel to the  Indians.\"    \"They're good Injuns now,\" said Wetzel, pointing to the prostrate  figures.    \"How did you find us?\" eagerly asked Joe.    \"Run acrost yer trail two days back.\"    \"And you've been following us?\"    The hunter nodded.    \"Did you see anything of another band of Indians? A tall chief and  Jim Girty were among them.\"    \"They've been arter me fer two days. I was followin' you when  Silvertip got wind of Girty an' his Delawares. The big chief was  Wingenund. I seen you pull Girty's nose. Arter the Delawares went I  turned loose yer dog an' horse an' lit out on yer trail.''    \"Where are the Delawares now?\"    \"I reckon there nosin' my back trail. We must be gittin'.  Silvertip'll soon hev a lot of Injuns here.\"    Joe intended to ask the hunter about what had frightened the  Indians, but despite his eager desire for information, he refrained  from doing so.    \"Girty nigh did fer you,\" remarked Wetzel, examining Joe's wound.  \"He's in a bad humor. He got kicked a few days back, and then hed  the skin pulled offen his nose. Somebody'll hev to suffer. Wal, you  fellers grab yer rifles, an' we'll be startin' fer the fort.\"    Joe shuddered as he leaned over one of the dusky forms to detach  powder and bullet horn. He had never seen a dead Indian, and the  tense face, the sightless, vacant eyes made him shrink. He shuddered  again when he saw the hunter scalp his victims. He shuddered the  third time when he saw Wetzel pick up Silvertip's beautiful white  eagle plume, dabble it in a pool of blood, and stick it in the bark  of a tree. Bereft of its graceful beauty, drooping with its gory  burden, the long leather was a deadly message. It had been  Silvertip's pride; it was now a challenge, a menace to the Shawnee  chief.    \"Come,\" said Wetzel, leading the way into the forest.                    *       *       *    Shortly after daylight on the second day following the release of  the Downs brothers the hunter brushed through a thicket of alder and  said: \"Thar's Fort Henry.\"    The boys were on the summit of a mountain from which the land sloped  in a long incline of rolling ridges and gentle valleys like a green,  billowy sea, until it rose again abruptly into a peak higher still  than the one upon which they stood. The broad Ohio, glistening in  the sun, lay at the base of the mountain.    Upon the bluff overlooking the river, and under the brow of the  mountain, lay the frontier fort. In the clear atmosphere it stood  out in bold relief. A small, low structure surrounded by a high  stockade fence was all, and yet it did not seem unworthy of its  fame. Those watchful, forbidding loopholes, the blackened walls and  timbers, told the history of ten long, bloody years. The whole  effect was one of menace, as if the fort sent out a defiance to the  wilderness, and meant to protect the few dozen log cabins clustered  on the hillside.    \"How will we ever get across that big river?\" asked Jim,  practically.    \"Wade--swim,\" answered the hunter, laconically, and began the  descent of the ridge. An hour's rapid walking brought the three to  the river. Depositing his rifle in a clump of willows, and directing  the boys to do the same with their guns, the hunter splashed into  the water. His companions followed him into the shallow water, and  waded a hundred yards, which brought them near the island that they  now perceived hid the fort. The hunter swam the remaining distance,  and, climbing the bank, looked back for the boys. They were close  behind him. Then he strode across the island, perhaps a quarter of a  mile wide.    \"We've a long swim here,\" said Wetzel, waving his hand toward the  main channel of the river. \"Good fer it?\" he inquired of Joe, since  Jim had not received any injuries during the short captivity and  consequently showed more endurance.    \"Good for anything,\" answered Joe, with that coolness Wetzel had  been quick to observe in him.    The hunter cast a sharp glance at the lad's haggard face, his  bruised temple, and his hair matted with blood. In that look he read  Joe thoroughly. Had the young man known the result of that scrutiny,  he would have been pleased as well as puzzled, for the hunter had  said to himself: \"A brave lad, an' the border fever's on him.\"    \"Swim close to me,\" said Wetzel, and he plunged into the river. The  task was accomplished without accident.    \"See the big cabin, thar, on the hillside? Thar's Colonel Zane in  the door,\" said Wetzel.    As they neared the building several men joined the one who had been  pointed out as the colonel. It was evident the boys were the subject  of their conversation. Presently Zane left the group and came toward  them. The brothers saw a handsome, stalwart man, in the prime of  life.    \"Well, Lew, what luck?\" he said to Wetzel.    \"Not much. I treed five Injuns, an' two got away,\" answered the  hunter as he walked toward the fort.    \"Lads, welcome to Fort Henry,\" said Colonel Zane, a smile lighting  his dark face. \"The others of your party arrived safely. They  certainly will be overjoyed to see you.\"    \"Colonel Zane, I had a letter from my uncle to you,\" replied Jim;  \"but the Indians took that and everything else we had with us.\"    \"Never mind the letter. I knew your uncle, and your father, too.  Come into the house and change those wet clothes. And you, my lad,  have got an ugly knock on the head. Who gave you that?\"    \"Jim Girty.\"    \"What?\" exclaimed the colonel.    \"Jim Girty did that. He was with a party of Delawares who ran across  us. They were searching for Wetzel.\"    \"Girty with the Delawares! The devil's to pay now. And you say  hunting Wetzel? I must learn more about this. It looks bad. But tell  me, how did Girty come to strike you?\"    \"I pulled his nose.\"    \"You did? Good! Good!\" cried Colonel Zane, heartily. \"By George,  that's great! Tell me--but wait until you are more comfortable. Your  packs came safely on Jeff's raft, and you will find them inside.\"    As Joe followed the colonel he heard one of the other men say:    \"Like as two peas in a pod.\"    Farther on he saw an Indian standing a little apart from the others.  Hearing Joe's slight exclamation of surprise, he turned, disclosing  a fine, manly countenance, characterized by calm dignity. The Indian  read the boy's thought.    \"Ugh! Me friend,\" he said in English.    \"That's my Shawnee guide, Tomepomehala. He's a good fellow, although  Jonathan and Wetzel declare the only good Indian is a dead one. Come  right in here. There are your packs, and you'll find water outside  the door.\"    Thus saying, Colonel Zane led the brothers into a small room,  brought out their packs, and left them. He came back presently with  a couple of soft towels.    \"Now you lads fix up a bit; then come out and meet my family and  tell us all about your adventure. By that time dinner will be  ready.\"    \"Geminy! Don't that towel remind you of home?\" said Joe, when the  colonel had gone. \"From the looks of things, Colonel Zane means to  have comfort here in the wilderness. He struck me as being a fine  man.\"    The boys were indeed glad to change the few articles of clothing the  Indians had left them, and when they were shaved and dressed they  presented an entirely different appearance. Once more they were twin  brothers, in costume and feature. Joe contrived, by brushing his  hair down on his forehead, to conceal the discolored bump.    \"I think I saw a charming girl,\" observed Joe.    \"Suppose you did--what then?\" asked Jim, severely.    \"Why--nothing--see here, mayn't I admire a pretty girl if I want?\"    \"No, you may not. Joe, will nothing ever cure you? I should think  the thought of Miss Wells---\"    \"Look here, Jim; she don't care--at least, it's very little she  cares. And I'm--I'm not worthy of her.\"    \"Turn around here and face me,\" said the young minister sharply.    Joe turned and looked in his brother's"]]]
