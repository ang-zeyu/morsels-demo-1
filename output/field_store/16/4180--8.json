And this explains how D'Artagnan had quarters in the Rue Tiquetonne, at  the Hotel de la Chevrette.    D'Artagnan then returned home in thoughtful mood, finding a somewhat  lively pleasure in carrying Mazarin's bag of money and thinking of that  fine diamond which he had once called his own and which he had seen on  the minister's finger that night.    \"Should that diamond ever fall into my hands again,\" he reflected, \"I  would turn it at once into money; I would buy with the proceeds certain  lands around my father's chateau, which is a pretty place, well enough,  but with no land to it at all, except a garden about the size of the  Cemetery des Innocents; and I should wait in all my glory till some rich  heiress, attracted by my good looks, rode along to marry me. Then I  should like to have three sons; I should make the first a nobleman, like  Athos; the second a good soldier, like Porthos; the third an excellent  abbe, like Aramis. Faith! that would be a far better life than I lead  now; but Monsieur Mazarin is a mean wretch, who won't dispossess himself  of his diamond in my favor.\"    On entering the Rue Tiquetonne he heard a tremendous noise and found a  dense crowd near the house.    \"Oho!\" said he, \"is the hotel on fire?\" On approaching the hotel of the  Roe he found, however, that it was in front of the next house the mob  was collected. The people were shouting and running about with torches.  By the light of one of these torches D'Artagnan perceived men in  uniform.    He asked what was going on.    He was told that twenty citizens, headed by one man, had attacked a  carriage which was escorted by a troop of the cardinal's bodyguard; but  a reinforcement having come up, the assailants had been put to flight  and the leader had taken refuge in the hotel next to his lodgings; the  house was now being searched.    In his youth D'Artagnan had often headed the bourgeoisie against the  military, but he was cured of all those hot-headed propensities;  besides, he had the cardinal's hundred pistoles in his pocket, so he  went into the hotel without a word. There he found Madeleine alarmed for  his safety and anxious to tell him all the events of the evening, but he  cut her short by ordering her to put his supper in his room and give him  with it a bottle of good Burgundy.    He took his key and candle and went upstairs to his bedroom. He had been  contented, for the convenience of the house, to lodge in the fourth  story; and truth obliges us even to confess that his chamber was just  above the gutter and below the roof. His first care on entering it was  to lock up in an old bureau with a new lock his bag of money, and then  as soon as supper was ready he sent away the waiter who brought it up  and sat down to table.    Not to reflect on what had passed, as one might fancy. No, D'Artagnan  considered that things are never well done when they are not reserved to  their proper time. He was hungry; he supped, he went to bed. Neither was  he one of those who think that the necessary silence of the night brings  counsel with it. In the night he slept, but in the morning, refreshed  and calm, he was inspired with his clearest views of everything. It was  long since he had any reason for his morning's inspiration, but he  always slept all night long. At daybreak he awoke and took a turn around  his room.    \"In '43,\" he said, \"just before the death of the late cardinal, I  received a letter from Athos. Where was I then? Let me see. Oh! at the  siege of Besancon I was in the trenches. He told me--let me think--what  was it? That he was living on a small estate--but where? I was just  reading the name of the place when the wind blew my letter away, I  suppose to the Spaniards; there's no use in thinking any more about  Athos. Let me see: with regard to Porthos, I received a letter from him,  too. He invited me to a hunting party on his property in the month of  September, 1646. Unluckily, as I was then in Bearn, on account of my  father's death, the letter followed me there. I had left Bearn when it  arrived and I never received it until the month of April, 1647; and as  the invitation was for September, 1646, I couldn't accept it. Let me  look for this letter; it must be with my title deeds.\"    D'Artagnan opened an old casket which stood in a corner of the room, and  which was full of parchments referring to an estate during a period of  two hundred years lost to his family. He uttered an exclamation of  delight, for the large handwriting of Porthos was discernible, and  underneath some lines traced by his worthy spouse.    D'Artagnan eagerly searched for the heading of this letter; it was dated  from the Chateau du Vallon.    Porthos had forgotten that any other address was necessary; in his pride  he fancied that every one must know the Chateau du Vallon.    \"Devil take the vain fellow,\" said D'Artagnan. \"However, I had better  find him out first, since he can't want money. Athos must have become an  idiot by this time from drinking. Aramis must have worn himself to a  shadow of his former self by constant genuflexion.\"    He cast his eyes again on the letter. There was a postscript:    \"I write by the same courier to our worthy friend Aramis in his  convent.\"    \"In his convent! What convent? There are about two hundred in Paris and  three thousand in France; and then, perhaps, on entering the convent he  changed his name. Ah! if I were but learned in theology I should  recollect what it was he used to dispute about with the curate of  Montdidier and the superior of the Jesuits, when we were at Crevecoeur;  I should know what doctrine he leans to and I should glean from that  what saint he has adopted as his patron.    \"Well, suppose I go back to the cardinal and ask him for a passport into  all the convents one can find, even into the nunneries? It would be a  curious idea, and maybe I should find my friend under the name of  Achilles. But, no! I should lose myself in the cardinal's opinion. Great  people only thank you for doing the impossible; what's possible, they  say, they can effect themselves, and they are right. But let us wait a  little and reflect. I received a letter from him, the dear fellow, in  which he even asked me for some small service, which, in fact, I  rendered him. Yes, yes; but now what did I do with that letter?\"    D'Artagnan thought a moment and then went to the wardrobe in which hung  his old clothes. He looked for his doublet of the year 1648 and as he  had orderly habits, he found it hanging on its nail. He felt in the  pocket and drew from it a paper; it was the letter of Aramis:    \"Monsieur D'Artagnan: You know that I have had a quarrel with a certain  gentleman, who has given me an appointment for this evening in the Place  Royale. As I am of the church, and the affair might injure me if I  should share it with any other than a sure friend like you, I write to  beg that you will serve me as second.    \"You will enter by the Rue Neuve Sainte Catherine; under the second lamp  on the right you will find your adversary. I shall be with mine under  the third.    \"Wholly yours,    \"Aramis.\"    D'Artagnan tried to recall his remembrances. He had gone to the  rendezvous, had encountered there the adversary indicated, whose name he  had never known, had given him a pretty sword-stroke on the arm, then  had gone toward Aramis, who at the same time came to meet him, having  already finished his affair. \"It is over,\" Aramis had said. \"I think I  have killed the insolent fellow. But, dear friend, if you ever need me  you know that I am entirely devoted to you.\" Thereupon Aramis had given  him a clasp of the hand and had disappeared under the arcades.    So, then, he no more knew where Aramis was than where Athos and Porthos  were, and the affair was becoming a matter of great perplexity, when he  fancied he heard a pane of glass break in his room window. He thought  directly of his bag and rushed from the inner room where he was  sleeping. He was not mistaken; as he entered his bedroom a man was  getting in by the window.    \"Ah! you scoundrel!\" cried D'Artagnan, taking the man for a thief and  seizing his sword.    \"Sir!\" cried the man, \"in the name of Heaven put your sword back into  the sheath and don't kill me unheard. I'm no thief, but an honest  citizen, well off in the world, with a house of my own. My name is--ah!  but surely you are Monsieur d'Artagnan?\"    \"And thou--Planchet!\" cried the lieutenant.    \"At your service, sir,\" said Planchet, overwhelmed with joy; \"if I were  still capable of serving you.\"    \"Perhaps so,\" replied D'Artagnan. \"But why the devil dost thou run about  the tops of houses at seven o'clock of the morning in the month of  January?\"    \"Sir,\" said Planchet, \"you must know; but, perhaps you ought not to  know----\"    \"Tell us what,\" returned D'Artagnan, \"but first put a napkin against the  window and draw the curtains.\"    \"Sir,\" said the prudent Planchet, \"in the first place, are you on good  terms with Monsieur de Rochefort?\"    \"Perfectly; one of my dearest friends.\"    \"Ah! so much the better!\"    \"But what has De Rochefort to do with this manner you have of invading  my room?\"    \"Ah, sir! I must first tell you that Monsieur de Rochefort is----\"    Planchet hesitated.    \"Egad, I know where he is,\" said D'Artagnan. \"He's in the Bastile.\"    \"That is to say, he was there,\" replied Planchet. \"But in returning  thither last night, when fortunately you did not accompany him, as his  carriage was crossing the Rue de la Ferronnerie his guards insulted the  people, who began to abuse them. The prisoner thought this a good  opportunity for escape; he called out his name and cried for help. I was  there. I heard the name of Rochefort. I remembered him well. I said in a  loud voice that he was a prisoner, a friend of the Duc de Beaufort, who  called for help. The people were infuriated; they stopped the horses and  cut"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12590"],[0,"The Shadow of the Rope (#12)"],[1,"on Saturday night.  Meanwhile I had impressed it upon the manager to keep the matter as  quiet as possible, for many excellent reasons, which I need not go into  now.\"    \"But the reason for so elaborate a pretence?\"    And the keen, dark face was searched with a scrutiny worthy of itself.  Steel set his mouth in another visible resolution to tell the truth.    \"I thought you might not be sorry to cease being Mrs. Minchin--the Mrs.  Minchin who had become so cruelly notorious through no fault of her  own--if only for a day or two, or a single night. That was most easily  to be effected by your arriving here minus possessions, and plus a very  definite story of your own.\"    \"You made very sure of me!\" said Rachel, dryly.    \"I trusted to my own powers of persuasion, and it was said you had no  friends. I will confess,\" added Steel, \"that I hoped the report was  true.\"    \"Did it follow that I could have no pride?\"    \"By no means; on the contrary, I knew that you were full of pride; it  is, if I may venture to say so, one of your most salient  characteristics. Nothing was more noticeable at your trial; nothing  finer have I ever seen! But,\" added Steel, suppressing a burst of  enthusiasm that gained by the suppression, \"but, madam, I hoped and  prayed that you would have the sense to put your pride in the second  place for once.\"    \"Well,\" said Rachel, \"and so far I have done so, Heaven knows!\"    \"And that is something,\" rejoined Steel, impressively. \"Even if it ends  at this--even if you won't hear me out--it is something that you have  had one night and one morning free from insult, discomfort, and  annoyance.\"    Rachel felt half frightened and half indignant. Steel was standing up,  looking very earnestly down upon her. And something that she had dimly  divined in the very beginning--only to chide herself for the mere  thought--that thing was in his face and in his voice. Rachel made a  desperate attempt to change the subject, but, as will be seen, an  unlucky one.    \"So I am supposed to be your daughter!\" she exclaimed nervously. \"May I  ask my new name?\"    \"If you like; but I am going to suggest to you a still newer name, Mrs.  Minchin.\"    Rachel tried to laugh, though his quietly determined and serious face  made it more than difficult.    \"Do you mean that I am not to be your daughter any longer, Mr. Steel?\"    \"Not if I can help it. But it will depend upon yourself.\"    \"And what do you want to make me now?\"    \"My wife!\"          CHAPTER VIII    THE DOVE AND THE SERPENT      Rachel was bereft of speech; and yet a certain sense of relief underlay  the natural embarrassment caused by a proposal so premature and so  abrupt. Nor was the deeper emotion very difficult to analyze. Here at  last was a logical explanation of the whole behavior of this man; it was  the first that had occurred to her, and, after all, it was the only  possible one.    \"I want you to be my wife,\" repeated Mr. Steel, with enough of respect  in his tone, yet none the less with the air of a man who is accustomed  to obtain what he wants.    And Rachel, looking at the wiry, well-knit, upright figure, and at the  fresh, elderly, but virile face, with its sombre eyes and its snowy  hair, thought once again of the ancient saw which she had quoted to  herself the night before, only to dismiss it finally from her mind. This  man was no fool, nor was he old. He might be eccentric, but he was  eminently sane; he might be elderly, in the arbitrary matter of mere  years; but an old man he was not, and never would be with those eyes.    She tried to tell him it was absurd, but before the word could come she  saw that it was the last one to apply; he was so confident, so quiet, so  sure of himself, if not of Rachel. At last she told him she could not  think of it, he had seen nothing of her, and could not possibly care for  her, even supposing that she cared for him.    \"By 'caring,'\" said he, \"do you mean being 'in love,' as they say, and  all that?\"    \"Naturally,\" said Rachel, with great ease and irony, but with a new  misgiving every moment.    \"And have I said I was in love with you?\" inquired Mr. Steel, with a  smile as indulgent as his tone. \"It might, perhaps, be no more than the  truth; but have I had the insolence to tell you so?\"    \"It is a greater insult if you are not,\" returned Rachel, speaking hotly  and quickly, but with lowered eyes.    \"What! To offer to marry a person whom one does not--as yet--pretend to  love?\"    Rachel vouchsafed no reply.    \"Whom one only--but tremendously--admires?\"    Rachel felt bound to answer him, for at least there was no insult in  his tone. She raised her candid eyes, a sweet brown blush upon her face.    \"Yes,\" she said, \"I think there is absolutely no excuse for a proposal  of marriage, if it is not founded upon love and nothing else!\"    \"Or its pretence and nothing else,\" amended Steel, with a bow and a  smile of some severity. \"That is a hard saying,\" he went on, resuming  his chair, and wheeling it even nearer to Rachel's than it had been  before; \"moreover,\" he added, \"since I have already insulted you, let me  tell you that it is an exceedingly commonplace saying, into the bargain.  It depends, you must admit, upon the commonplace conception of marriage;  and before we go any further I should like to give you my own  conception, not of the institution, but of the particular marriage which  I have in view.\"    So he had it in view! It was not an inspiration, but already quite a  prospect! Rachel made an acid little note of this; but there was no  acidity in her permission to him to proceed; her turn was coming last.    \"The marriage that I propose to you,\" continued Steel, \"is simply the  most convenient form of friendship of which I can think. I want to be  your friend; indeed, that much I mean to be, if necessary, in spite of  you. I was interested in your case, so I came up to hear your trial. I  was more interested in your trial, but most interested of all in  yourself. There, indeed, the word is too weak; but I will not vex your  spirit with a stronger. My attraction you know; my determination you  know; even the low wiles to which your pride reduced me, even my dodging  and dogging, have been quite openly admitted to you on the first  reasonable opportunity. All this business of the shipwrecked daughter  was of course a crude device enough; but I had very little time to  think, and my first care was that you should not be recognized here or  elsewhere in my society. That was essential, if there was the slightest  chance of your even listening to my proposition, as indeed you are doing  now. Last night I told you nothing, because that's always easier than  telling only a little; moreover, you were so distraught that you would  possibly have gone right away without benefiting even to the slight  extent of the comfortable night's rest you so badly needed; but this  morning I am prepared to put it to the touch. And let me begin by  saying, that if circumstances would permit me to continue the paternal  imposture, that would be quite enough for me; unluckily, I am known in  my own country as an old bachelor; so that I cannot suddenly produce a  widowed daughter, without considerable unpleasantness for us both. What  I can do, however,\" and Steel bent further forward, with eyes that held  Rachel's in their spell; \"what I can do, and will, is to go back with a  lady who shall be my wife in name, my daughter in effect. We should, I  trust, be the best of friends; but I will give you my word, and not only  my word but my bond, that we never need be anything more.\"    He had spoken rapidly; the pause that followed lasted longer than this  lengthy speech. And through it all they sat with eyes still locked,  until he spoke again.    \"You believe, at least, in the bona fides of my offer?\"    And Rachel, still looking in his eyes, murmured that she did.    \"You will bear in mind how essentially it differs from the ordinary  offer of the kind; also, that I have never for a moment pretended to be  in love with you?\"    \"I will.\"    Steel had risen as if to go; the keen scrutiny was withdrawn, a distinct  spell as distinctly broken; and yet he lingered, with a smile.    \"That,\" said he, \"was a poor compliment to pay twice over! But it is  human to err, and in my anxiety not to do so on the side of sentiment I  own myself in danger of flying to the other extreme. Well, you know  which is the common extreme in such cases; and at all events we shall  avoid the usual pitfall. I am going to give you a few minutes to think  it over; then, if you care to go into it further, I shall be most happy;  if not, the matter is at an end.\"    A few minutes! Rachel felt very angry, without knowing that she was most  angry with herself for not feeling angrier still. She had heard quite  enough; it were weakness to listen to another word; and yet--and yet--    \"Don't go,\" said Rachel, with some petulance; \"that is quite  unnecessary. Anything more extraordinary--but I owe you too much already  to be your critic. Still, I do think I am entitled to go a little  further into the matter, as you said, without committing myself.\"    \"To be sure you are.\"    But this time he remained standing; and for once he kept those mesmeric  eyes to himself. Obviously, Rachel was to have a chance.    \"You spoke of your own country,\" she began. \"Do you live abroad?\"    There was the least suspicion of eagerness in the question. Rachel  herself was unaware of it; not so Mr. Steel, and he sighed.    \"A mere figure,\" he said; \"what I meant was my own country-side.\"    \"And where is that?\"    \"In the north,\" he replied vaguely. \"Did you look twice at my card?  Well, here is another, if you will do me that honor now. The initials  J. B. stand for no very interesting names--John Buchanan. A certain  interest in the Buchanan, perhaps; it comes out in the flesh, I fancy,  though not on the tongue. As for the address, Normanthorpe"]]]
