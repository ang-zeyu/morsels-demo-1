In atom, and molecule; in monad, in cell, in plant, in  fish, in animal, in man,--the Life Principle or Creative Will is  constantly in action, creating, preserving, and carrying on life in its  functions. We may call this Instinct or Nature, but it is the Creative  Will in action. This Will is back of all Power, Energy, or Force--be it  physical, mechanical or mental force. And all Force that we use,  consciously or unconsciously, comes from the One Great Source of Power.  If we could but see clearly, we would know that back of us is the Power  of the Universe, awaiting our intelligent uses, under the control of  the Will of the All. There is nothing to be afraid of, for we are  manifestations of the One Life, from which all Power proceeds, and the  Real Self is above the effect, for it is part of the Cause. But over  and above--under and behind--all forms of Being, Matter, Energy, Force  and Power, is the ABSOLUTE--ever Calm; ever Peaceful; ever Content. In  knowing this it becomes us to manifest that spirit of absolute Trust,  Faith and Confidence in the Goodness and Ultimate Justice of That which  is the only Reality there is.    Peace be with you.          THE FOURTH LESSON      THE UNITY OF LIFE.    In our First Lesson of this series we spoke of the One Reality  underlying all Life. This One Reality was stated to be higher than mind  or matter, the nearest term that can be applied to it being \"Spirit.\"  We told you that it was impossible to explain just what \"Spirit\" is,  for we have nothing else with which to compare or describe it, and it  can be expressed only in its own terms, and not in the terms applicable  to its emanations or manifestations. But, as we said in our First  Lesson, we may think of \"Spirit\" as meaning the \"essence\" of Life and  Being--the Reality underlying Universal Life, and from which the latter  emanates.    In the Second Lesson we stated that this \"Spirit,\" which we called \"The  Absolute,\" expressed itself in the Universal Life, which Universal Life  manifested itself in countless forms of life and activity. In the same  lesson we showed you that the Universe is alive--that there is not a  single dead thing in it--that there can be no such thing as a dead  object in the Universe, else the theory and truth of the One underlying  Life must fall and be rejected. In that lesson we also showed you that  even in the world of inorganic things there was ever manifest life--in  every atom and particle of inorganic matter there is the universal life  energy manifesting itself, and in constant activity.    In the Third Lesson, we went still further into this phase of the  general subject, and showed you that the Creative Will--that active  principle of the Universal Life--was ever at work, building up new  forms, shapes and combinations, and then tearing them down for the  purpose of rebuilding the material into new forms, shapes, and  combinations. The Creative Will is ever at work in its threefold  function of creating, preserving and destroying forms--the change,  however, being merely in the shape and form or combination, the real  substance remaining unchanged in its inner aspect, notwithstanding the  countless apparent changes in its objective forms. Like the great ocean  the depths of which remain calm and undisturbed, and the real nature of  which is unchanged in spite of the waves, and billows of surface  manifestation, so does the great ocean of the Universal Life remain  unchanged and unaltered in spite of the constant play of the Creative  Will upon the surface. In the same lesson we gave you many examples of  the Will in action--of its wondrous workings in the various forms of  life and activity--all of which went to show you that the One Power was  at work everywhere and at all times.    In our next lesson--the Fifth Lesson--we shall endeavor to make plain  to you the highest teachings of the Yogi Philosophy regarding the One  Reality and the Many Manifestations--the One and the Many--how the One  apparently becomes Many--that great question and problem which lies at  the bottom of the well of truth. In that lesson we shall present for  your consideration some fundamental and startling truths, but before we  reach that point in our teachings, we must fasten upon your mind the  basic truth that all the various manifestations of Life that we see on  all hands in the Universe are but forms of manifestation of One  Universal Life which is itself an emanation of the Absolute.    Speaking generally, we would say to you that the emanation of the  Absolute is in the form of a grand manifestation of One Universal Life,  in which the various apparent separate forms of Life are but centers of  Energy or Consciousness, the separation being more apparent than real,  there being a bond of unity and connection underlying all the  apparently separated forms. Unless the student gets this idea firmly  fixed in his mind and consciousness, he will find it difficult to grasp  the higher truths of the Yogi Philosophy. That all Life is One, at the  last,--that all forms of manifestation of Life are in harmonious Unity,  underlying--is one of the great basic truths of the Yogi Teaching, and  all the students of that philosophy must make this basic truth their  own before they may progress further. This grasping of the truth is  more than a mere matter of intellectual conception, for the intellect  reports that all forms of Life are separate and distinct from each  other, and that there can be no unity amidst such diversity. But from  the higher parts of the mind comes the message of an underlying Unity,  in spite of all apparent diversity, and if one will meditate upon this  idea he will soon begin to realize the truth, and will _feel_ that he,  himself, is but a center of consciousness in a great ocean of  Life--that he and all other centers are connected by countless  spiritual and mental filaments--and that all emerge from the One. He  will find that the illusion of separateness is but \"a working fiction  of the Universe,\" as one writer has so aptly described it--and that All  is One, at the last, and underlying all is One.    Some of our students may feel that we are taking too long a path to  lead up to the great basic truths of our philosophy, but we who have  traveled The Path, and know its rocky places and its sharp turns, feel  justified in insisting that the student be led to the truth gradually  and surely, instead of attempting to make short cuts across dangerous  ravines and canyons. We must insist upon presenting our teachings in  our own way--for this way has been tested and found good. We know that  every student will come to realize that our plan is a wise one, and  that he will thank us for giving him this gradual and easy approach to  the wondrous and awful truth which is before us. By this gradual  process, the mind becomes accustomed to the line of thought and the  underlying principles, and also gradually discards wornout mental  sheaths which have served their purposes, and which must be discarded  because they begin to weigh heavily upon the mind as it reaches the  higher altitudes of The Path of Attainment. Therefore, we must ask you  to consider with us, in this lesson, some further teachings regarding  the Unity of Life.    All the schools of the higher Oriental thought, as well as many of the  great philosophical minds of the Western world, have agreed upon the  conception of the Unity of Life--the Oneness of All Life. The Western  thinkers, and many of the Eastern philosophers arrived at this  conclusion by means of their Intellectual powers, greatly heightened  and stimulated by concentration and meditation, which latter process  liberated the faculties of the Spiritual Mind so that it passed down  knowledge to the Intellect, which then seized upon the higher knowledge  which it found within itself, and amplified and theorized upon the  same. But among the Eastern Masters there are other sources of  information open, and from these sources come the same report--the  Oneness and Unity of Universal Life. These higher sources of  information to which we have alluded, consist of the knowledge coming  from those Beings who have passed on to higher planes of Life than  ours, and whose awakened spiritual faculties and senses enable them to  see things quite plainly which are quite dark to us. And from these  sources, also, comes the message of the Oneness of Life--of the  existence of a wonderful Universal Life including all forms of life as  we know it, and many forms and phases unknown to us--many centers in  the great Ocean of Life. No matter how high the source of inquiry, the  answer is the same--\"All Life is One.\" And this One Life includes  Beings as much higher than ourselves, as we are higher than the  creatures in the slime of the ocean-bed. Included in it are beings who  would seem as archangels or gods to us, and they inform that beyond  them are still higher and more radiant creatures, and so on to infinity  of infinities. And yet all are but centers of Being in the One  Life--all but a part of the great Universal Life, which itself is but  an emanation of The Absolute.    The mind of man shrinks back appalled from the contemplation of such  wonders, and yet there are men who dare to attempt to speak  authoritatively of the attributes and qualities of \"God,\" as if He, the  Absolute, were but a magnified man. Verily, indeed, \"fools rush in  where angels fear to tread,\" as the poet hath said.    Those who will read our next lesson and thus gain an idea of the  sublime conception of the Absolute held by the Yogi teachers may  shudder at the presumption of those mortals who dare to think of the  Absolute as possessing \"attributes\" and \"qualities\" like unto the  meanest of things in this his emanated Universe. But even these  spiritual infants are doing well--that is, they are beginning to  _think_, and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13444"],[0,"Searchlights on Health: The Science of Eugenics (#12)"],[1,"the mouth, let it be the fingers of the left  hand.    12. Tea, coffee, chocolate and the like are drank from the cup and  never from the saucer.    13. In masticating your food, keep your mouth shut; otherwise you will  make a noise that will be very offensive to those around you.    14. Don't attempt to talk with a full mouth. One thing at a time is as  much as any man can do well.    15. Should you find a worm or insect in your food, say nothing about  it.    16. If a dish is distasteful to you, decline it, and without comment.    17. Never put bones or bits of fruit on the table cloth. Put them on  the side of your plate.    18. Do not hesitate to take the last piece on the dish, simply because  it is the last. To do so is to directly express the fear that you  would exhaust the supply.    19. If you would be what you would like to be--abroad, take care that  you _are_ what you would like to be--at home.    20. Avoid picking your teeth at the table if possible; but if you  must, do it, it you can, where you are not observed.    21. If an accident of any kind soever should occur during dinner, the  cause being who or what it may, you should not seem to note it.    22. Should you be so unfortunate as to overturn or to break anything,  you should make no apology. You might let your regret appear in your  face, but it would not be proper to put it in words.    [Illustration: A PARLOR RECITATION.]             *       *       *       *       *    SOCIAL DUTIES.        Man In Society is like a flower,    Blown in its native bed. 'Tis there alone    His faculties expanded in full bloom    Shine out, there only reach their proper use.    --COWPER.      The primal duties shine aloft like stars;    The charities that soothe, and heal, and bless,    Are scatter'd at the feet of man like flowers.    --WORDSWORTH.      1. MEMBERSHIP IN SOCIETY.--Many fail to get hold of the idea that they  are members of society. They seem to suppose that the social machinery  of the world is self-operating. They cast their first ballot with an  emotion of pride perhaps, but are sure to pay their first tax with  a groan. They see political organizations in active existence; the  parish, and the church, and other important bodies that embrace in  some form of society all men, are successfully operated; and yet these  young men have no part or lot in the matter. They do not think of  giving a day's time to society.    2. BEGIN EARLY.--One of the first things a young man should do is to  see that he is acting his part in society. The earlier this is begun  the better. I think that the opponents of secret societies in colleges  have failed to estimate the benefit which it must be to every  member to be obliged to contribute to the support of his particular  organization, and to assume personal care and responsibility as a  member. If these societies have a tendency to teach the lessons of  which I speak, they are a blessed thing.    3. DO YOUR PART.--Do your part, and be a man among men. Assume your  portion of social responsibility, and see that you discharge it well.  If you do not do this, then you are mean, and society has the right  to despise you just as much as it chooses to do so. You are, to use a  word more emphatic than agreeable, a sneak, and have not a claim upon  your neighbors for a single polite word.    4. A WHINING COMPLAINER.--Society, as it is called, is far more apt  to pay its dues to the individual than the individual to society. Have  you, young man, who are at home whining over the fact that you  cannot get into society, done anything to give you a claim to social  recognition? Are you able to make any return for social recognition  and social privileges? Do you know anything? What kind of coin do you  propose to pay in the discharge of the obligation which comes upon you  with social recognition? In other words, as a return for what you wish  to have society do for you, what can you do for society? This is a  very important question--more important to you than to society. The  question is, whether you will be a member of society by right, or  by courtesy. If you have so mean a spirit as to be content to be a  beneficiary of society--to receive favors and to confer none--you have  no business in the society to which you aspire. You are an exacting,  conceited fellow.    5. WHAT ARE YOU GOOD FOR?--Are you a good beau, and are you willing to  make yourself useful in waiting on the ladies on all occasions? Have  you a good set of teeth, which you are willing to show whenever  the wit of the company gets off a good thing? Are you a true,  straightforward, manly fellow, with whose healthful and uncorrupted  nature it is good for society to come in contact? In short, do you  possess anything of any social value? If you do, and are willing  to impart it, society will yield itself to your touch. If you  have nothing, then society, as such, owes you nothing. Christian  philanthropy may put its arm around you, as a lonely young man, about  to spoil for want of something, but it is very sad and humiliating  for a young man to be brought to that. There are people who devote  themselves to nursing young men, and doing them good. If they invite  you to tea, go by all means, and try your hand. If in the course of  the evening, you can prove to them that your society is desirable, you  have won a point. Don't be patronized.    6. THE MORBID CONDITION.--Young men, you are apt to get into a morbid  state of mind, which declines them to social intercourse. They  become devoted to business with such exclusiveness, that all social  intercourse is irksome. They go out to tea as if they were going  to jail, and drag themselves to a party as to an execution. This  disposition is thoroughly morbid, and to be overcome by going where  you are invited, always, and with a sacrifice of feeling.    7. THE COMMON BLUNDER.--Don't shrink from contact with anything but  bad morals. Men who affect your unhealthy minds with antipathy, will  prove themselves very frequently to be your best friends and most  delightful companions. Because a man seems uncongenial to you, who  are squeamish and foolish, you have no right to shun him. We become  charitable by knowing men. We learn to love those whom we have  despised by rubbing against them. Do you not remember some instance of  meeting a man or woman whom you had never previously known or cared  to know--an individual, perhaps, against whom you have entertained  the strongest prejudices--but to whom you became bound by a lifelong  friendship through the influence of a three days' intercourse? Yet,  if you had not thus met, you would have carried through life the idea  that it would be impossible for you to give your fellowship to such an  individual.    8. THE FOOLISHNESS OF MAN.--God has introduced into human character  infinite variety, and for you to say that you do not love and will not  associate with a man because he is unlike you, is not only foolish but  wrong. You are to remember that in the precise manner and decree in  which a man differs from you, do you differ from him; and that from  his standpoint you are naturally as repulsive to him, as he, from  your standpoint, is to you. So, leave all this talk of congeniality to  silly girls and transcendental dreamers.    9. DO BUSINESS IN YOUR WAY AND BE HONEST.--Do your business in your  own way, and concede to every man the privilege which you claim for  yourself. The more you mix with men, the less you will be disposed to  quarrel, and the more charitable and liberal will you become. The fact  that you do not understand a man, is quite as likely to be your fault  as his. There are a good many chances in favor of the conclusion that,  if you fail to like an individual whose acquaintance you make it is  through your own ignorance and illiberality. So I say, meet every man  honestly; seek to know him; and you will find that in those points  in which he differs from you rests his power to instruct you, enlarge  you, and do you good. Keep your heart open for everybody, and be sure  that you shall have your reward. You shall find a jewel under the most  uncouth exterior; and associated with homeliest manners and oddest  ways and ugliest faces, you will find rare virtues, fragrant little  humanities, and inspiring heroisms.    10. WITHOUT SOCIETY, WITHOUT INFLUENCE.--Again: you can have no  influence unless you are social. An unsocial man is as devoid of  influence as an ice-peak is of verdure. It is through social contact  and absolute social value alone that you can accomplish any great  social good. It is through the invisible lines which you are able to  attach to the minds with which you are brought into association alone  that you can tow society, with its deeply freighted interests, to the  great haven of your hope.    11. THE REVENGE OF SOCIETY.--The revenge which society takes upon  the man who isolates himself, is as terrible as it is inevitable. The  pride which sits alone will have the privilege of sitting alone in its  sublime disgust till it drops into the grave. The world sweeps by the  man, carelessly, remorselessly, contemptuously. He has no hold upon  society, because he is no part of it.    12. THE CONCLUSION OF THE WHOLE MATTER.--You cannot move men until you  are one of them. They will not follow you until they have heard your  voice, shaken your hand, and fully learned your principles and your  sympathies. It makes no difference how much you know, or how much you  are capable of doing. You may pile accomplishment upon acquisition  mountain high; but if you fail to be a social man, demonstrating to  society that your lot is with the rest, a little child with a song in  its mouth, and a kiss for all and a pair of innocent hands to lay upon  the knees, shall lead more hearts and change the direction of more  lives than you.
