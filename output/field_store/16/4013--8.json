The hunter shouted out in his dream, if there was any one in the  broch, to let him in for the Holy One's sake. Deirdre heard the voice  and said to her foster-mother: \"O foster-mother, what cry is that?\" \"It  is nothing at all, Deirdre--merely the birds of the air astray and  seeking each other. But let them go past to the bosky glade. There is  no shelter or house for them here.\" \"Oh, foster-mother, the bird asked  to get inside for the sake of the God of the Elements, and you yourself  tell me that anything that is asked in His name we ought to do. If you  will not allow the bird that is being benumbed with cold, and done to  death with hunger, to be let in, I do not think much of your language  or your faith. But since I give credence to your language and to your  faith, which you taught me, I will myself let in the bird.\" And Deirdre  arose and drew the bolt from the leaf of the door, and she let in the  hunter. She placed a seat in the place for sitting, food in the place  for eating, and drink in the place for drinking for the man who came to  the house. \"Oh, for this life and raiment, you man that came in, keep  restraint on your tongue!\" said the old woman. \"It is not a great thing  for you to keep your mouth shut and your tongue quiet when you get a  home and shelter of a hearth on a gloomy winter's night.\"    \"Well,\" said the hunter, \"I may do that--keep my mouth shut and my  tongue quiet, since I came to the house and received hospitality from  you; but by the hand of thy father and grandfather, and by your own two  hands, if some other of the people of the world saw this beauteous  creature you have here hid away, they would not long leave her with  you, I swear.\"    \"What men are these you refer to?\" said Deirdre.    \"Well, I will tell you, young woman,\" said the hunter.    \"They are Naois, son of Uisnech, and Allen and Arden his two brothers.\"    \"What like are these men when seen, if we were to see them?\" said  Deirdre.    \"Why, the aspect and form of the men when seen are these,\" said the  hunter: \"they have the colour of the raven on their hair, their skin  like swan on the wave in whiteness, and their cheeks as the blood of  the brindled red calf, and their speed and their leap are those of the  salmon of the torrent and the deer of the grey mountain side. And Naois  is head and shoulders over the rest of the people of Erin.\"    \"However they are,\" said the nurse, \"be you off from here and take  another road. And, King of Light and Sun! in good sooth and certainty,  little are my thanks for yourself or for her that let you in!\"    The hunter went away, and went straight to the palace of King  Connachar. He sent word in to the king that he wished to speak to him  if he pleased. The king answered the message and came out to speak to  the man. \"What is the reason of your journey?\" said the king to the  hunter.    \"I have only to tell you, O king,\" said the hunter, \"that I saw the  fairest creature that ever was born in Erin, and I came to tell you of  it.\"    \"Who is this beauty and where is she to be seen, when she was not seen  before till you saw her, if you did see her?\"    \"Well, I did see her,\" said the hunter. \"But, if I did, no man else can  see her unless he get directions from me as to where she is dwelling.\"    \"And will you direct me to where she dwells? and the reward of your  directing me will be as good as the reward of your message,\" said the  king.    \"Well, I will direct you, O king, although it is likely that this will  not be what they want,\" said the hunter.    Connachar, King of Ulster, sent for his nearest kinsmen, and he told  them of his intent. Though early rose the song of the birds mid the  rocky caves and the music of the birds in the grove, earlier than that  did Connachar, King of Ulster, arise, with his little troop of dear  friends, in the delightful twilight of the fresh and gentle May; the  dew was heavy on each bush and flower and stem, as they went to bring  Deirdre forth from the green knoll where she stayed. Many a youth was  there who had a lithe leaping and lissom step when they started whose  step was faint, failing, and faltering when they reached the bothy on  account of the length of the way and roughness of the road.    \"Yonder, now, down in the bottom of the glen is the bothy where the  woman dwells, but I will not go nearer than this to the old woman,\"  said the hunter.    Connachar with his band of kinsfolk went down to the green knoll where  Deirdre dwelt and he knocked at the door of the bothy. The nurse  replied, \"No less than a king's command and a king's army could put me  out of my bothy to-night. And I should be obliged to you, were you to  tell who it is that wants me to open my bothy door.\"    \"It is I, Connachar, King of Ulster.\" When the poor woman heard who was  at the door, she rose with haste and let in the king and all that could  get in of his retinue.    When the king saw the woman that was before him that he had been in  quest of, he thought he never saw in the course of the day nor in the  dream of night a creature so fair as Deirdre and he gave his full  heart's weight of love to her. Deirdre was raised on the topmost of the  heroes' shoulders and she and her foster-mother were brought to the  Court of King Connachar of Ulster.    With the love that Connachar had for her, he wanted to marry Deirdre  right off there and then, will she nill she marry him. But she said to  him, \"I would be obliged to you if you will give me the respite of a  year and a day.\" He said \"I will grant you that, hard though it is, if  you will give me your unfailing promise that you will marry me at the  year's end.\" And she gave the promise. Connachar got for her a  woman-teacher and merry modest maidens fair that would lie down and  rise with her, that would play and speak with her. Deirdre was clever  in maidenly duties and wifely understanding, and Connachar thought he  never saw with bodily eye a creature that pleased him more.    Deirdre and her women companions were one day out on the hillock behind  the house enjoying the scene, and drinking in the sun's heat. What did  they see coming but three men a-journeying. Deirdre was looking at the  men that were coming, and wondering at them. When the men neared them,  Deirdre remembered the language of the huntsman, and she said to  herself that these were the three sons of Uisnech, and that this was  Naois, he having what was above the bend of the two shoulders above the  men of Erin all. The three brothers went past without taking any notice  of them, without even glancing at the young girls on the hillock. What  happened but that love for Naois struck the heart of Deirdre, so that  she could not but follow after him. She girded up her raiment and went  after the men that went past the base of the knoll, leaving her women  attendants there. Allen and Arden had heard of the woman that  Connachar, King of Ulster, had with him, and they thought that, if  Naois, their brother, saw her, he would have her himself, more  especially as she was not married to the King. They perceived the woman  coming, and called on one another to hasten their step as they had a  long distance to travel, and the dusk of night was coming on. They did  so. She cried: \"Naois, son of Uisnech, will you leave me?\" \"What  piercing, shrill cry is that--the most melodious my ear ever heard, and  the shrillest that ever struck my heart of all the cries I ever heard?\"  \"It is anything else but the wail of the wave-swans of Connachar,\" said  his brothers. \"No! yonder is a woman's cry of distress,\" said Naois,  and he swore he would not go further until he saw from whom the cry  came, and Naois turned back. Naois and Deirdre met, and Deirdre kissed  Naois three times, and a kiss each to his brothers. With the confusion  that she was in, Deirdre went into a crimson blaze of fire, and her  colour came and went as rapidly as the movement of the aspen by the  stream side. Naois thought he never saw a fairer creature, and Naois  gave Deirdre the love that he never gave to thing, to vision, or to  creature but to herself.    Then Naois placed Deirdre on the topmost height of his shoulder, and  told his brothers to keep up their pace, and they kept up their pace.  Naois thought that it would not be well for him to remain in Erin on  account of the way in which Connachar, King of Ulster, his uncle's son,  had gone against him because of the woman, though he had not married  her; and he turned back to Alba, that is, Scotland. He reached the side  of Loch-Ness and made his habitation there. He could kill the salmon of  the torrent from out his own door, and the deer of the grey gorge from  out his window. Naois and Deirdre and Allen and Arden dwelt in a tower,  and they were happy so long a time as they were there.    By this time the end of the period came at which Deirdre had to marry  Connachar, King of Ulster. Connachar made up his mind to take Deirdre  away by the sword whether she was married to Naois or not. So he  prepared a great and gleeful feast. He sent word far and wide through  Erin all to his kinspeople to come to the feast. Connachar thought to  himself that Naois would not come though he should bid him; and the  scheme that arose in his mind was to send for his father's brother,  Ferchar Mac Ro, and to send him on an embassy to Naois. He did so; and  Connachar said to Ferchar, \"Tell Naois, son of Uisnech, that I am  setting forth a great and gleeful feast to my friends and kinspeople  throughout the wide extent of Erin all, and that I shall not have rest  by day nor sleep by night if he and Allen and Arden be not partakers of  the feast.\"    Ferchar Mac Ro and his three sons went on their journey, and reached  the tower where Naois was dwelling by the side of Loch Etive. The sons  of Uisnech gave a cordial kindly welcome to Ferchar Mac Ro and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7896"],[0,"The Eight Strokes of the Clock (#11)"],[1,"live with such a wretch!\"    The other started with fury at the outrage and, addressing the young man,  cried:    \"Jean, are you going to sit there and let me be insulted by your hussy of a  d'Imbleval?\"    And the tall one retorted, furiously:    \"Hussy! Do you hear that, Louis? Look at her, your Vaurois! She's got the  airs of a superannuated barmaid! Make her stop, can't you?\"    Suddenly Jean Louis banged his fist upon the table, making the plates and  dishes jump, and shouted:    \"Be quiet, both of you, you old lunatics!\"    They turned upon him at once and loaded him with abuse:    \"Coward!... Hypocrite!... Liar!... A pretty sort of son you are!... The son  of a slut and not much better yourself!...\"    The insults rained down upon him. He stopped his ears with his fingers and  writhed as he sat at table like a man who has lost all patience and has  need to restrain himself lest he should fall upon his enemy.    Renine whispered:    \"Now's the time to go in.\"    \"In among all those infuriated people?\" protested Hortense.    \"Exactly. We shall see them better with their masks off.\"    And, with a determined step, he walked to the door, opened it and entered  the room, followed by Hortense.    His advent gave rise to a feeling of stupefaction. The two women stopped  yelling, but were still scarlet in the face and trembling with rage. Jean  Louis, who was very pale, stood up.    Profiting by the general confusion, Renine said briskly:    \"Allow me to introduce myself. I am Prince Renine. This is Madame Daniel.  We are friends of Mlle. Genevieve Aymard and we have come in her name. I  have a letter from her addressed to you, monsieur.\"    Jean Louis, already disconcerted by the newcomers' arrival, lost  countenance entirely on hearing the name of Genevieve. Without quite  knowing what he was saying and with the intention of responding to Renine's  courteous behaviour, he tried in his turn to introduce the two ladies and  let fall the astounding words:    \"My mother, Madame d'Imbleval; my mother, Madame Vaurois.\"    For some time no one spoke. Renine bowed. Hortense did not know with whom  she should shake hands, with Madame d'Imbleval, the mother, or with Madame  Vaurois, the mother. But what happened was that Madame d'Imbleval and  Madame Vaurois both at the same time attempted to snatch the letter which  Renine was holding out to Jean Louis, while both at the same time mumbled:    \"Mlle. Aymard!... She has had the coolness ... she has had the  audacity...!\"    Then Jean Louis, recovering his self-possession, laid hold of his mother  d'Imbleval and pushed her out of the room by a door on the left and next of  his mother Vaurois and pushed her out of the room by a door on the right.  Then, returning to his two visitors, he opened the envelope and read, in an  undertone:        \"I am to be married in a week, Jean Louis. Come to my rescue, I beseech      you. My friend Hortense and Prince Renine will help you to overcome the      obstacles that baffle you. Trust them. I love you.        \"GENEVIEVE.\"    He was a rather dull-looking young man, whose very swarthy, lean and bony  face certainly bore the expression of melancholy and distress described by  Genevieve. Indeed, the marks of suffering were visible in all his harassed  features, as well as in his sad and anxious eyes.    He repeated Genevieve's name over and over again, while looking about him  with a distracted air. He seemed to be seeking a course of conduct.    He seemed on the point of offering an explanation but could find nothing  to say. The sudden intervention had taken him at a disadvantage, like an  unforseen attack which he did not know how to meet.    Renine felt that the adversary would capitulate at the first summons. The  man had been fighting so desperately during the last few months and had  suffered so severely in the retirement and obstinate silence in which he  had taken refuge that he was not thinking of defending himself. Moreover,  how could he do so, now that they had forced their way into the privacy of  his odious existence?    \"Take my word for it, monsieur,\" declared Renine, \"that it is in your best  interests to confide in us. We are Genevieve Aymard's friends. Do not  hesitate to speak.\"    \"I can hardly hesitate,\" he said, \"after what you have just heard. This is  the life I lead, monsieur. I will tell you the whole secret, so that you  may tell it to Genevieve. She will then understand why I have not gone back  to her ... and why I have not the right to do so.\"    He pushed a chair forward for Hortense. The two men sat down, and, without  any need of further persuasion, rather as though he himself felt a certain  relief in unburdening himself, he said:    \"You must not be surprised, monsieur, if I tell my story with a certain  flippancy, for, as a matter of fact, it is a frankly comical story and  cannot fail to make you laugh. Fate often amuses itself by playing these  imbecile tricks, these monstrous farces which seem as though they must have  been invented by the brain of a madman or a drunkard. Judge for yourself.  Twenty-seven years ago, the Manoir d'Elseven, which at that time consisted  only of the main building, was occupied by an old doctor who, to increase  his modest means, used to receive one or two paying guests. In this way,  Madame d'Imbleval spent the summer here one year and Madame Vaurois the  following summer. Now these two ladies did not know each other. One of them  was married to a Breton of a merchant-vessel and the other to a commercial  traveller from the Vendee.    \"It so happened that they lost their husbands at the same time, at a period  when each of them was expecting a baby. And, as they both lived in the  country, at places some distance from any town, they wrote to the old  doctor that they intended to come to his house for their confinement....  He agreed. They arrived almost on the same day, in the autumn. Two small  bedrooms were prepared for them, behind the room in which we are sitting.  The doctor had engaged a nurse, who slept in this very room. Everything  was perfectly satisfactory. The ladies were putting the finishing touches  to their baby-clothes and were getting on together splendidly. They were  determined that their children should be boys and had chosen the names of  Jean and Louis respectively.... One evening the doctor was called out to a  case and drove off in his gig with the man-servant, saying that he would  not be back till next day. In her master's absence, a little girl who  served as maid-of-all-work ran out to keep company with her sweetheart.  These accidents destiny turned to account with diabolical malignity. At  about midnight, Madame d'Imbleval was seized with the first pains. The  nurse, Mlle. Boussignol, had had some training as a midwife and did not  lose her head. But, an hour later, Madame Vaurois' turn came; and the  tragedy, or I might rather say the tragi-comedy, was enacted amid the  screams and moans of the two patients and the bewildered agitation of the  nurse running from one to the other, bewailing her fate, opening the window  to call out for the doctor or falling on her knees to implore the aid of  Providence.... Madame Vaurois was the first to bring a son into the world.  Mlle. Boussignol hurriedly carried him in here, washed and tended him and  laid him in the cradle prepared for him.... But Madame d'Imbleval was  screaming with pain; and the nurse had to attend to her while the newborn  child was yelling like a stuck pig and the terrified mother, unable to stir  from her bed, fainted.... Add to this all the wretchedness of darkness and  disorder, the only lamp, without any oil, for the servant had neglected to  fill it, the candles burning out, the moaning of the wind, the screeching  of the owls, and you will understand that Mlle. Boussignol was scared  out of her wits. However, at five o'clock in the morning, after many  tragic incidents, she came in here with the d'Imbleval baby, likewise a  boy, washed and tended him, laid him in his cradle and went off to help  Madame Vaurois, who had come to herself and was crying out, while Madame  d'Imbleval had fainted in her turn. And, when Mlle. Boussignol, having  settled the two mothers, but half-crazed with fatigue, her brain in a  whirl, returned to the new-born children, she realized with horror that she  had wrapped them in similar binders, thrust their feet into similar woolen  socks and laid them both, side by side, _in the same cradle_, so that  it was impossible to tell Louis d'Imbleval from Jean Vaurois!... To make  matters worse, when she lifted one of them out of the cradle, she found  that his hands were cold as ice and that he had ceased to breathe. He was  dead. What was his name and what the survivor's?... Three hours later, the  doctor found the two women in a condition of frenzied delirium, while the  nurse was dragging herself from one bed to the other, entreating the two  mothers to forgive her. She held me out first to one, then to the other,  to receive their caresses--for I was the surviving child--and they first  kissed me and then pushed me away; for, after all, who was I? The son of  the widowed Madame d'Imbleval and the late merchant-captain or the son of  the widowed Madame Vaurois and the late commercial traveller? There was  not a clue by which they could tell.... The doctor begged each of the two  mothers to sacrifice her rights, at least from the legal point of view,  so that I might be called either Louis d'Imbleval or Jean Vaurois. They  refused absolutely. 'Why Jean Vaurois, if he's a d'Imbleval?' protested the  one. 'Why Louis d'Imbleval, if he's a Vaurois?' retorted the other. And I  was registered under the name of Jean Louis, the son of an unknown father  and mother.\"    Prince Renine had listened in silence. But Hortense, as the story  approached its conclusion, had given way to a hilarity which she could no  longer restrain and suddenly, in spite of "]]]
