Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not             God.    19:055:020 He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with             him: he hath broken his covenant.    19:055:021 The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was             in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they             drawn swords.    19:055:022 Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he             shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.    19:055:023 But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of             destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half             their days; but I will trust in thee.    19:056:001 Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he             fighting daily oppresseth me.    19:056:002 Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many that             fight against me, O thou most High.    19:056:003 What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.    19:056:004 In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I             will not fear what flesh can do unto me.    19:056:005 Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against             me for evil.    19:056:006 They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they             mark my steps, when they wait for my soul.    19:056:007 Shall they escape by iniquity? in thine anger cast down the             people, O God.    19:056:008 Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle:             are they not in thy book?    19:056:009 When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back: this             I know; for God is for me.    19:056:010 In God will I praise his word: in the LORD will I praise his             word.    19:056:011 In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can             do unto me.    19:056:012 Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee.    19:056:013 For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thou             deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in             the light of the living?    19:057:001 Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul             trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make             my refuge, until these calamities be overpast.    19:057:002 I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth all             things for me.    19:057:003 He shall send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of             him that would swallow me up.

Selah.    19:057:007 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and             give praise.    19:057:008 Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will             awake early.    19:057:009 I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto             thee among the nations.    19:057:010 For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto             the clouds.    19:057:011 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let thy glory be             above all the earth.    19:058:001 Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge             uprightly, O ye sons of men?    19:058:002 Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of             your hands in the earth.    19:058:003 The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon             as they be born, speaking lies.    19:058:004 Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like             the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear;    19:058:005 Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming             never so wisely.    19:058:006 Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great             teeth of the young lions, O LORD.    19:058:007 Let them melt away as waters which run continually: when he             bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in             pieces.    19:058:008 As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away:             like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the             sun.    19:058:009 Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away             as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.    19:058:010 The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he             shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.    19:058:011 So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the             righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.    19:059:001 Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them             that rise up against me.    19:059:002 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from             bloody men.    19:059:003 For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered             against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD.    19:059:004 They run and prepare themselves without my fault: awake to             help me, and behold.    19:059:005 Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake             to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked             transgressors.

Selah.    19:059:014 And at evening let them return; and let them make a noise like             a dog, and go round about the city.    19:059:015 Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be             not satisfied.    19:059:016 But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy             mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge             in the day of my trouble.    19:059:017 Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God is my defence,             and the God of my mercy.    19:060:001 O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou             hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again.    19:060:002 Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal             the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.    19:060:003 Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to             drink the wine of astonishment.    19:060:004 Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may             be displayed because of the truth.
