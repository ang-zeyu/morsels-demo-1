For a while, I found myself very wakeful, which may have been  because of the warmth of the night, and, indeed, at last I got up and  went out of the tent, conceiving that I might the better find sleep in  the open air. And so it proved; for, having lain down at the side of the  tent, a little way from the fire, I fell soon into a deep slumber, which  at first was dreamless. Presently, however, I came upon a very strange  and unsettling dream; for I dreamed that I had been left alone on the  island, and was sitting very desolate upon the edge of the brown-scummed  pit. Then I was aware suddenly that it was very dark and very silent, and  I began to shiver; for it seemed to me that something which repulsed my  whole being had come quietly behind me. At that I tried mightily to turn  and look into the shadows among the great fungi that stood all about me;  but I had no power to turn. And the thing was coming nearer, though never  a sound came to me, and I gave out a scream, or tried to; but my voice  made no stir in the rounding quiet; and then something wet and cold  touched my face, and slithered down and covered my mouth, and paused  there for a vile, breathless moment. It passed onward and fell to my  throat--and stayed there ...    Some one stumbled and felt over my feet, and at that, I was suddenly  awake. It was the man on watch making a walk round the back of the tent,  and he had not known of my presence till he fell over my boots. He was  somewhat shaken and startled, as might be supposed; but steadied himself  on learning that it was no wild creature crouched there in the shadow;  and all the time, as I answered his inquiries, I was full of a strange,  horrid feeling that something had left me at the moment of my awakening.  There was a slight, hateful odor in my nostrils that was not altogether  unfamiliar, and then, suddenly, I was aware that my face was damp and  that there was a curious sense of tingling at my throat. I put up my hand  and felt my face, and the hand when I brought it away was slippery with  slime, and at that, I put up my other hand, and touched my throat, and  there it was the same, only, in addition, there was a slight swelled  place a little to one side of the wind-pipe, the sort of place that the  bite of a mosquito will make; but I had no thought to blame any mosquito.    Now the stumbling of the man over me, my awakening, and the discovery  that my face and throat were be-slimed, were but the happenings of some  few, short instants; and then I was upon my feet, and following him round  to the fire; for I had a sense of chilliness and a great desire not to be  alone. Now, having come to the fire, I took some of the water that had  been left in the boiler, and washed my face and neck, after which I felt  more my own man. Then I asked the man to look at my throat, so that he  might give me some idea of what manner of place the swelling seemed, and  he, lighting a piece of the dry seaweed to act as a torch, made  examination of my neck; but could see little, save a number of small  ring-like marks, red inwardly, and white at the edges, and one of them  was bleeding slightly. After that, I asked him whether he had seen  anything moving round the tent; but he had seen nothing during all the  time that he had been on watch; though it was true that he had heard odd  noises; but nothing very near at hand. Of the places on my throat he  seemed to think but little, suggesting that I had been bitten by some  sort of sand-fly; but at that, I shook my head, and told him of my dream,  and after that, he was as anxious to keep near me as I to him. And so the  night passed onward, until my turn came to watch.    For a little while, the man whom I had relieved sat beside me; having,  I conceived, the kindly intent of keeping me company; but so soon as I  perceived this, I entreated him to go and get his sleep, assuring him  that I had no longer any feelings of fear--such as had been mine upon  awakening and discovering the state of my face and throat--and, upon  this, he consented to leave me, and so, in a little, I sat alone  beside the fire.    For a certain space, I kept very quiet, listening; but no sound came to  me out of the surrounding darkness, and so, as though it were a fresh  thing, it was borne in upon me how that we were in a very abominable  place of lonesomeness and desolation. And I grew very solemn.    Thus as I sat, the fire, which had not been replenished for a while,  dwindled steadily until it gave but a dullish glow around. And then, in  the direction of the valley, I heard suddenly the sound of a dull thud,  the noise coming to me through the stillness with a very startling  clearness. At that, I perceived that I was not doing my duty to the rest,  nor to myself, by sitting and allowing the fire to cease from flaming;  and immediately reproaching myself, I seized and cast a mass of the dry  weed upon the fire, so that a great blaze shot up into the night, and  afterwards I glanced quickly to right and to left, holding my  cut-and-thrust very readily, and most thankful to the Almighty that I  had brought no harm to any by reason of my carelessness, which I incline  me to believe was that strange inertia which is bred by fear. And then,  even as I looked about me, there came to me across the silence of the  beach a fresh noise, a continual soft slithering to and fro in the bottom  of the valley, as though a multitude of creatures moved stealthily. At  this, I threw yet more fuel upon the fire, and after that I fixed my gaze  in the direction of the valley: thus in the following instant it seemed  to me that I saw a certain thing, as it might be a shadow, move on the  outer borders of the firelight. Now the man who had kept watch before me  had left his spear stuck upright in the sand convenient to my grasp, and,  seeing something moving, I seized the weapon and hurled it with all my  strength in its direction; but there came no answering cry to tell that I  had struck anything living, and immediately afterwards there fell once  more a great silence upon the island, being broken only by a far splash  out upon the weed.    It may be conceived with truth that the above happenings had put a very  considerable strain upon my nerves, so that I looked to and fro  continually, with ever and anon a quick glance behind me; for it seemed  to me that I might expect some demoniac creature to rush upon me at any  moment. Yet, for the space of many minutes, there came to me neither any  sight nor sound of living creature; so that I knew not what to think,  being near to doubting if I had heard aught beyond the common.    And then, even as I made halt upon the threshold of doubt, I was assured  that I had not been mistaken; for, abruptly, I was aware that all the  valley was full of a rustling, scampering sort of noise, through which  there came to me occasional soft thuds, and anon the former slithering  sounds. And at that, thinking a host of evil things to be upon us, I  cried out to the bo'sun and the men to awake.    Immediately upon my shout, the bo'sun rushed out from the tent, the men  following, and every one with his weapon, save the man who had left his  spear in the sand, and that lay now somewhere beyond the light of the  fire. Then the bo'sun shouted, to know what thing had caused me to cry  out; but I replied nothing, only held up my hand for quietness, yet when  this was granted, the noises in the valley had ceased; so that the bo'sun  turned to me, being in need of some explanation; but I begged him to hark  a little longer, which he did, and, the sounds re-commencing almost  immediately, he heard sufficient to know that I had not waked them all  without due cause. And then, as we stood each one of us staring into the  darkness where lay the valley, I seemed to see again some shadowy thing  upon the boundary of the firelight; and, in the same instant, one of the  men cried out and cast his spear into the darkness. But the bo'sun turned  upon him with a very great anger; for in throwing his weapon, the man had  left himself without, and thus brought danger to the whole; yet, as will  be remembered, I had done likewise but a little since.    Presently, there coming again a quietness within the valley, and none  knowing what might be toward, the bo'sun caught up a mass of the dry  weed, and, lighting it at the fire, ran with it towards that portion of  the beach which lay between us and the valley. Here he cast it upon the  sand, singing out to some of the men to bring more of the weed, so that  we might have a fire there, and thus be able to see if anything made to  come at us out of the deepness of the hollow.    Presently, we had a very good fire, and by the light of this the two  spears were discovered, both of them stuck in the sand, and no more than  a yard one from the other, which seemed to me a very strange thing.    Now, for a while after the lighting of the second fire, there came no  further sounds from the direction of the valley; nothing indeed to break  the quietness of the island, save the occasional lonely splashes that  sounded from time to time out in the vastness of the weed-continent.  Then, about an hour after I had waked the bo'sun, one of the men who had  been tending the fires came up to him to say that we had come to the end  of our supply of weed-fuel. At that, the bo'sun looked very blank, the  which did the rest of us, as well we might; yet there was no help for it,  until one of the men bethought him of the remainder of the bundle of  reeds which we had cut, and which, burning but poorly, we had discarded  for the weed. This was discovered at the back of the tent, and with it we  fed the fire that burned between us and the valley; but the other we  suffered to die out, for the reeds were not sufficient to support even  the one until the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10554"],[0,"Right Ho, Jeeves (#12)"],[1,"invigorating. For the benefit of those interested, I may mention  that if you shove the thing under the surface with the sponge and then  let it go, it shoots out of the water in a manner calculated to divert  the most careworn. Ten minutes of this and I was enabled to return to the  bedchamber much more the old merry Bertram.    Jeeves was there, laying out the dinner disguise. He greeted the young  master with his customary suavity.    \"Good evening, sir.\"    I responded in the same affable key.    \"Good evening, Jeeves.\"    \"I trust you had a pleasant drive, sir.\"    \"Very pleasant, thank you, Jeeves. Hand me a sock or two, will you?\"    He did so, and I commenced to don,    \"Well, Jeeves,\" I said, reaching for the underlinen, \"here we are again  at Brinkley Court in the county of Worcestershire.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"A nice mess things seem to have gone and got themselves into in this  rustic joint.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"The rift between Tuppy Glossop and my cousin Angela would appear to be  serious.\"    \"Yes, sir. Opinion in the servants' hall is inclined to take a grave view  of the situation.\"    \"And the thought that springs to your mind, no doubt, is that I shall  have my work cut out to fix things up?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"You are wrong, Jeeves. I have the thing well in hand.\"    \"You surprise me, sir.\"    \"I thought I should. Yes, Jeeves, I pondered on the matter most of the  way down here, and with the happiest results. I have just been in  conference with Mr. Glossop, and everything is taped out.\"    \"Indeed, sir? Might I inquire----\"    \"You know my methods, Jeeves. Apply them. Have you,\" I asked, slipping  into the shirt and starting to adjust the cravat, \"been gnawing on the  thing at all?\"    \"Oh, yes, sir. I have always been much attached to Miss Angela, and I  felt that it would afford me great pleasure were I to be able to be of  service to her.\"    \"A laudable sentiment. But I suppose you drew blank?\"    \"No, sir. I was rewarded with an idea.\"    \"What was it?\"    \"It occurred to me that a reconciliation might be effected between Mr.  Glossop and Miss Angela by appealing to that instinct which prompts  gentlemen in time of peril to hasten to the rescue of----\"    I had to let go of the cravat in order to raise a hand. I was shocked.    \"Don't tell me you were contemplating descending to that old  he-saved-her-from-drowning gag? I am surprised, Jeeves. Surprised and  pained. When I was discussing the matter with Aunt Dahlia on my arrival,  she said in a sniffy sort of way that she supposed I was going to shove  my Cousin Angela into the lake and push Tuppy in to haul her out, and I  let her see pretty clearly that I considered the suggestion an insult to  my intelligence. And now, if your words have the meaning I read into them,  you are mooting precisely the same drivelling scheme. Really, Jeeves!\"    \"No, sir. Not that. But the thought did cross my mind, as I walked in the  grounds and passed the building where the fire-bell hangs, that a sudden  alarm of fire in the night might result in Mr. Glossop endeavouring to  assist Miss Angela to safety.\"    I shivered.    \"Rotten, Jeeves.\"    \"Well, sir----\"    \"No good. Not a bit like it.\"    \"I fancy, sir----\"    \"No, Jeeves. No more. Enough has been said. Let us drop the subj.\"    I finished tying the tie in silence. My emotions were too deep for  speech. I knew, of course, that this man had for the time being lost his  grip, but I had never suspected that he had gone absolutely to pieces  like this. Remembering some of the swift ones he had pulled in the past,  I shrank with horror from the spectacle of his present ineptitude. Or is  it ineptness? I mean this frightful disposition of his to stick straws in  his hair and talk like a perfect ass. It was the old, old story, I  supposed. A man's brain whizzes along for years exceeding the speed  limit, and something suddenly goes wrong with the steering-gear and it  skids and comes a smeller in the ditch.    \"A bit elaborate,\" I said, trying to put the thing in as kindly a light  as possible. \"Your old failing. You can see that it's a bit elaborate?\"    \"Possibly the plan I suggested might be considered open to that  criticism, sir, but _faute de mieux_----\"    \"I don't get you, Jeeves.\"    \"A French expression, sir, signifying 'for want of anything better'.\"    A moment before, I had been feeling for this wreck of a once fine thinker  nothing but a gentle pity. These words jarred the Wooster pride, inducing  asperity.    \"I understand perfectly well what _faute de mieux_ means, Jeeves. I did  not recently spend two months among our Gallic neighbours for nothing.  Besides, I remember that one from school. What caused my bewilderment was  that you should be employing the expression, well knowing that there is  no bally _faute de mieux_ about it at all. Where do you get that  _faute-de-mieux_ stuff? Didn't I tell you I had everything taped out?\"    \"Yes, sir, but----\"    \"What do you mean--but?\"    \"Well, sir----\"    \"Push on, Jeeves. I am ready, even anxious, to hear your views.\"    \"Well, sir, if I may take the liberty of reminding you of it, your plans  in the past have not always been uniformly successful.\"    There was a silence--rather a throbbing one--during which I put on my  waistcoat in a marked manner. Not till I had got the buckle at the back  satisfactorily adjusted did I speak.    \"It is true, Jeeves,\" I said formally, \"that once or twice in the past I  may have missed the bus. This, however, I attribute purely to bad luck.\"    \"Indeed, sir?\"    \"On the present occasion I shall not fail, and I'll tell you why I shall  not fail. Because my scheme is rooted in human nature.\"    \"Indeed, sir?\"    \"It is simple. Not elaborate. And, furthermore, based on the psychology  of the individual.\"    \"Indeed, sir?\"    \"Jeeves,\" I said, \"don't keep saying 'Indeed, sir?' No doubt nothing is  further from your mind than to convey such a suggestion, but you have a  way of stressing the 'in' and then coming down with a thud on the 'deed'  which makes it virtually tantamount to 'Oh, yeah?' Correct this, Jeeves.\"    \"Very good, sir.\"    \"I tell you I have everything nicely lined up. Would you care to hear  what steps I have taken?\"    \"Very much, sir.\"    \"Then listen. Tonight at dinner I have recommended Tuppy to lay off the  food.\"    \"Sir?\"    \"Tut, Jeeves, surely you can follow the idea, even though it is one that  would never have occurred to yourself. Have you forgotten that telegram I  sent to Gussie Fink-Nottle, steering him away from the sausages and ham?  This is the same thing. Pushing the food away untasted is a universally  recognized sign of love. It cannot fail to bring home the gravy. You must  see that?\"    \"Well, sir----\"    I frowned.    \"I don't want to seem always to be criticizing your methods of voice  production, Jeeves,\" I said, \"but I must inform you that that 'Well, sir'  of yours is in many respects fully as unpleasant as your 'Indeed, sir?'  Like the latter, it seems to be tinged with a definite scepticism. It  suggests a lack of faith in my vision. The impression I retain after  hearing you shoot it at me a couple of times is that you consider me to  be talking through the back of my neck, and that only a feudal sense of  what is fitting restrains you from substituting for it the words 'Says  you!'\"    \"Oh, no, sir.\"    \"Well, that's what it sounds like. Why don't you think this scheme will  work?\"    \"I fear Miss Angela will merely attribute Mr. Glossop's abstinence to  indigestion, sir.\"    I hadn't thought of that, and I must confess it shook me for a moment.  Then I recovered myself. I saw what was at the bottom of all this.  Mortified by the consciousness of his own ineptness--or ineptitude--the  fellow was simply trying to hamper and obstruct. I decided to knock the  stuffing out of him without further preamble.    \"Oh?\" I said. \"You do, do you? Well, be that as it may, it doesn't alter  the fact that you've put out the wrong coat. Be so good, Jeeves,\" I said,  indicating with a gesture the gent's ordinary dinner jacket or _smoking_,  as we call it on the Cote d'Azur, which was suspended from the hanger on  the knob of the wardrobe, \"as to shove that bally black thing in the  cupboard and bring out my white mess-jacket with the brass buttons.\"    He looked at me in a meaning manner. And when I say a meaning manner, I  mean there was a respectful but at the same time uppish glint in his eye  and a sort of muscular spasm flickered across his face which wasn't quite  a quiet smile and yet wasn't quite not a quiet smile. Also the soft  cough.    \"I regret to say, sir, that I inadvertently omitted to pack the garment  to which you refer.\"    The vision of that parcel in the hall seemed to rise before my eyes, and  I exchanged a merry wink with it. I may even have hummed a bar or two.  I'm not quite sure.    \"I know you did, Jeeves,\" I said, laughing down from lazy eyelids and  nicking a speck of dust from the irreproachable Mechlin lace at my  wrists. \"But I didn't. You will find it on a chair in the hall in a  brown-paper parcel.\"    The information that his low manoeuvres had been rendered null and void  and that the thing was on the strength after all, must have been the  nastiest of jars, but there was no play of expression on his finely  chiselled to indicate it. There very seldom is on Jeeves's f-c. In  moments of discomfort, as I had told Tuppy, he wears a mask, preserving  throughout the quiet stolidity of a stuffed moose.    \"You might just slide down and fetch it, will you?\"    \"Very good, sir.\"    \"Right ho, Jeeves.\"    And presently I was sauntering towards the drawing-room with me good old  j. nestling snugly abaft the shoulder blades.    And Dahlia was in the drawing-room. She glanced up at my entrance.    \"Hullo, eyesore,\" she said. \"What do you think you're made up as?\"    I did not get the purport.    \"The jacket, you mean?\" I queried, groping.    \"I do."]]]
