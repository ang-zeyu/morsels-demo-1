As yet, ships of heavy draft  are unable to get through it. Some disasters to shipping have occurred  in the Red Sea after the canal has been passed, and it is not at  all improbable that more troubles will arise before everything goes  smoothly.    The Red Sea is comparatively unknown to navigators. It contains hidden  rocks which must be charted and buoyed before its navigation can be  rendered safe. Surely this ought not to take the world by surprise.  As to the canal itself, we are only surprised that it has reached its  present state of perfection and we advise those who now make haste to  prophesy ignominious defeat for one of the greatest enterprises of the  century, to suspend judgment for a time. New York journalists might  certainly call to mind with profit, the annual troubles attending the  opening of the canals in this State. Frosts heave and rats undermine,  and banks annually give way, yet these things are not regarded as  surprising. But upon the opening of a work, to which all the minor  canals in the world are like the rods of the magicians to Aaron's rod  which swallowed them up, it is expected that everything shall move  without difficulty, and that no oversight will have been committed.  Truly this would be to attribute a power of prevision to M. Lesseps  beyond what is human. The world can afford to wait a little till this  huge machine gets oiled. Great enterprises move slow at the outset. We  have yet unshaken faith in the ultimate success of the Suez Canal.           *       *       *       *       *          TUBULAR BOILERS AND BOILER EXPLOSIONS.      In our description of the novel steam boiler, published on page 209,  last volume, we made a quotation from several eminent writers and  experimenters on the subjects of heat and steam, to the effect that  the tubular system in steam boilers was wrong in theory and unsafe in  practice, and although this system has hitherto been extensively used on  account of some advantages which it secures, it has long been a serious  question with thinking men whether these advantages were not obtained at  too dear a rate.    While not prepared to admit all the force of the objections made to the  tubular system, there are arguments against it that it will not do to  treat lightly and which seem to us more and more forcible the more we  candidly reflect upon the subject. One of the most forcible of these  which occurs to us is, that in the tubular system the disruptive force  of unequal expansion is far more likely to become a cause of danger than  in the plain cylinder boiler. In such boilers the tension of expanded  tubes is transmitted to the shell, which are greatly strained without  doubt, often nearly to the verge of rupture. When this occurs it is  evident an unusual strain, caused by sudden generation of steam, would  act in concert with the expansion of the tubes, and we have no doubt  these causes combined have given rise to many an explosion when the  steam, acting singly, could never have produced rupture.    But while we give due weight to this argument, there is one often  referred to by our correspondents, and which we often see stated in  newspapers, as ridiculous as the one we have noticed is forcible. It  is that when, in such boilers, water, by carelessness or otherwise, is  allowed to fall below any of the tubes, the steam which surrounds them  is decomposed, and becomes an explosive mixture of hydrogen and oxygen  gases, ready to explode with terrible violence whenever the temperature  of the tubes shall have reached the proper point.    This argument is ridiculous, because it rests on no experimental basis.  It is a flimsy theory, entirely unsupported by any facts. Never has it  been proved that hot iron, at any temperature likely to be obtained in  steam boiler tubes, decomposes steam except by itself appropriating  the oxygen of the steam, and leaving the hydrogen, by itself no more  explosive than any other heated gas.    The sole object of the tubular boiler is to increase the heating  surface, without corresponding increase in other particulars. That it is  not the only means whereby this object can be secured has already been  demonstrated and we believe will hereafter be shown in divers ways. We  have no more doubt that the next fifty years will witness the total  abandonment of the tubular system, than we have that the world will last  that length of time.           *       *       *       *       *          AMERICAN RAILWAY MANAGEMENT.      There seems a growing opinion among railway managers that the sole  end and purpose of a railroad is to line the 6 pockets of, if not its  stockholders, at least its directors. In fact we not long since saw a  statement in a widely-circulated journal, that, as the sole purpose of  railroads is that the companies who own them should make money, it  is absurd to suppose they would be content to manage them in any way  whereby such a result would not be most likely to accrue.    The journal referred to, in making this statement a basis for an  argument in favor of railway consolidation, entirely ignored the rights  of the public from which railway corporations have obtained their  charters. In these charters certain privileges were granted, not out of  pure generosity, but with the understanding that certain benefits  were to accrue to the public. Its safety and convenience were to be  considered as well as the profits to the owners.    Every charter granted to these roads involves a contract on their part  to do the public a certain service, and in a large majority of cases  these contracts are to-day unfulfilled. Day after day sees the power to  control more and more centered in a few unscrupulous wily managers, and  the comfort and safety of passengers more and more disregarded; yet  still the people submit.    But they do not submit without complaint. Now and then a newspaper  correspondent grumbles, and the news of smashes that may be almost daily  seen in the papers gives a text for an occasional editorial blast, as  little heeded by the delinquent companies, as a zephyr is felt by an  oak.    Thus the New York _Times_, on the occasion of a recent railway disaster,  gives vent to a little mild denunciation. It says:    \"The general rule in this country (to which there are indeed exceptions)  in regard to the purchase of railway materials is simply this: buy the  cheapest. First cost is the controlling and often the only question  entertained. The nature of the materials and processes to be used in the  manufacture of rails, for instance, are not mentioned. The buyers for  some of our roads, especially new roads, never make the slightest  allusion to quality, and never specify tests and inspections, but  simply go about among the mills, comparing and beating down prices, and  accepting the very lowest. More than one of our rail makers are to-day  rolling, under protest, rails upon which they decline to put their  trade-mark--rails made from the very cheapest materials, in the very  meanest manner--for all that is required is that they shall stick  together till they are laid. And if American makers will not roll them,  Welsh makers will. The late report of the State Engineer of New York  says: 'American railway managers, instead of offering anything like a  reasonable price for good iron rails, have made themselves notorious by  establishing as standard, a brand of rails known all over the world as  \"American rails,\" which are confessedly bought and sold as the weakest,  most impure, least worked, least durable, and cheapest rails that can be  produced.' The State Engineer refers, in confirmation of this opinion,  to the statement of Mr. A.S. Hewitt, United States Commissioner to the  Paris Exposition, a statement not yet controverted; and to a statement  of Mr. Sandberg, an English engineer of note, in the London _Times_.  A leading American railway president and reformer has publicly said:  'There is a fear on my part that railway companies will themselves tempt  steel makers to send a poor article by buying the cheapest--first cost  only considered--_as they did with the ironmasters_.'\"    This certainly is a blessed state of affairs. We have given privileges  to giant corporations, which they have improved so profitably, that they  now can defeat, in our Legislatures, any attempt to revoke them, and can  laugh at any demand for better management.    Disguise it how we may, the railroads have got the upper hand of the  people, and they seem likely to keep it, unless, indeed, their rapacity  shall react against themselves.    At the moment of this writing accounts reach us of the officers of a  prominent railway line intrenching themselves against the officers of  the law, and employing force to resist the service of precepts calling  them to account for alleged frauds upon the stockholders.    That the Legislature of this State has the power to put a stop to these  disgraceful proceedings, is certain; what it will do remains to be  demonstrated.           *       *       *       *       *          THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE PRIZES AWARDED TO STEAM ENGINES.      If there is anybody satisfied with the action of the managers of the  American Institute, in the matter of awarding prizes to the competing  engines exhibited at the recent fair, we have yet to meet that  complacent individual. Neither the exhibitors nor the general public  could be expected to accept with equanimity such a report as the  managers have made, because it is inadequate to give any real idea of  the relative merits of the engines tested. The exhibitors, at a large  expense, took their engines to the hall of exhibition, placed them in  position, and with them drove the machinery exhibited there; and now,  when in return they had a right to expect a decided, manly course on "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8997"],[0,"Ritchie's Fabulae Faciles: A First Latin Reader (#11)"],[1,"words, but that the translation must  often be something quite different if it is to be acceptable English. The  rule for translation is: Discover the exact meaning of the original; then  express the same idea correctly and, if you can, elegantly in the  language into which you are translating.    5. continentem. What is the derivation of this word?    vénit. Is this present or perfect? How do you know?    8. Graeás. The Graeae were three old women who had one eye and one  tooth in common, and took turns in using them.    9. galeam. This belonged to Pluto, the god of the underworld of the dead,  and whosoever wore it was invisible. The story is that Perseus compelled  the Graeae to tell him how to obtain the helps to his enterprise by  seizing their tooth and eye.    11. pedibus, 'on his feet,' dative of indirect object.    induit. See the note on 3, 13.    áera. _Áér_ is borrowed from Greek, and keeps this Greek form for its  accusative.    12. volábat. Distinguish between _voló, voláre_, and _voló, velle_.    13. céterís. _Céterí_ is used to denote all not already named ('the  other'), while _alií_ denotes some of those who have not been already  named ('other').    14. specié horribilí, 'of terrible appearance.' ablative of description.  A noun never stands alone in this construction,    eárum. See the note on 3, 22.    15. contécta. This and factae below are used as predicate adjectives, not  to form the pluperfect passive with erant. Translate, therefore, 'were  covered.' not 'had been covered.'    18. vertébantur. The imperfect here denotes customary action, one of its  regular uses.    19. Ille. See the note on 3, 16.    20. hóc modó, ablative of manner.    21. vénit, dormiébat. The perfect simply expresses an action which took  place in past time, the imperfect tells of a state of things existing at  that past time.    25. fugit. When dum means 'while,' 'as,' it is followed by the present  indicative, even when used of past events.    26. fécit. Like _postquam_, ubi has the present or perfect indicative,  where English would use the pluperfect.    5. 2. illó tempore, ablative of time.    régnábat. Observe the force of the tense, and try to find the reason for  each change of tense in this paragraph.    Híc. This must here be translated simply 'he.' Compare the use of Ille,  3, 16.    4. veniébat. See the note on 4, 18.    6. omnium, 'of all men.' or 'of all.' The adjective is used as a noun, as  in the second of the English expressions.    óráculum. It was believed in antiquity that the will of the gods and a  knowledge of future events might be learned at certain shrines, of which  the most famous were those of Apollo at Delphi, of Zeus or Jupiter at  Dodona, and of Hammon in Egypt. Hammon was really an Egyptian god,  represented as having the horns of a ram, but he was identified by the  Greeks with Zeus and by the Romans with Jupiter.    7. fíliam. Where there is no ambiguity, the possessive is often omitted  in Latin.    8. autem, often, as here, simply introduces an explanation ('now'),    nómine, 'by name.'    9. Cépheus. See the note on _Perseus_, 4, 4.    10. cívís suós, 'his subjects.'    13. certam. See the note on _quódam_, 3, 15. _Diés_ is regularly  masculine, but when used of an appointed day it is often feminine.    omnia, 'all things,' 'everything,' or 'all.' See the note on _omnium_,  line 6.    16. déplórábant, tenébant. Be careful to show the meaning of the tense by  your translation.    18. quaerit. The present is often used of a past action instead of the  perfect, to bring the action more vividly before us as if it were taking  place now. This is called the historical present.    19. haec geruntur, 'this is going on.'    20. horribilí. Here the adjective is made emphatic by being put before  its noun; in 4, 14 the same effect is gained by putting _horribilí_ last  in its clause.    22. omnibus, dative of indirect object after the compound verb  _(in+iació)_. Translate 'inspired in all,' but the literal meaning is  'threw into all.'    26. induit. See the note on 3, 13.    áera. See the note on 4, 11.    6. 2. suó, éius. Distinguish carefully between these words. _Suus_ is  used of something belonging to the subject, _éius_ of something belonging  to some other person or thing just mentioned.    5. volat. See the note on 4, 25.    7. sustulit. Notice that the perfect forms of _tolló_ are the same as  those of _sufferó (sub + feró)_, 'endure.'    8. neque, here to be translated 'and ... not.' _Neque_ is thus used  regularly for _et nón_.    13. exanimáta, used here as a predicate adjective.    16. rettulit. 'To give thanks' or 'thank' is usually _grátiás agere_, as  in 3, 19; _grátiam referre_ means 'to show one's gratitude,' 'to  recompense' or 'requite.'    18. dúxit. This word came to mean 'marry,' because the bridegroom 'led'  his bride in a wedding procession to his own home. It will be seen,  therefore, that it can be used only of the man.    Paucós annós. See the note on 3, 20.    20. omnís. What does the quantity of the _i_ tell you about the form?    7. 1. quod, not the relative pronoun, but a conjunction.    3. eó, the adverb.    in átrium. Although inrúpit means 'burst _into_,' the preposition is  nevertheless required with the noun to express the place into which he  burst.    6. ille. See the note on _Perseus_, 4, 4.    8. Acrisí. In Nepos, Caesar, Cicero, and Vergil, the genitive singular of  second-declension nouns in _-ius_ and _-ium_ ends in _í_, not _ií_; but  the nominative plural ends in _ií_, and the dative and ablative plural in  _iís_.    10. istud. Remember that _iste_ is commonly used of something connected  with the person addressed. Here the meaning may be 'that oracle I told  you of.' See 3, 4.    12. Lárísam. See the note on 3, 12.    neque enim, 'for ... not,' as if simply _nón enim_, but Latin uses _neque_  to connect the clauses.    14. in omnís partís, 'in all directions' or 'in every direction.'    15. Multí. See the note on _omnium_, 5, 6.    17. discórum. The discus was a round, flat piece of stone or metal, and  the athletes tried to see who could throw it farthest.    18. cású. This is one of the ablatives of manner that do not take _cum_.    19. stábat. Notice the tense.      HERCULES    9. 2. omnium hominum. This means 'all men' in the sense of 'all mankind.'    3. óderat. _Ódí_ is perfect in form, but present in meaning; and the  pluperfect has in like manner the force of an imperfect.   5. mediá nocte, 'in the middle of the night,' 'in the dead of night.'    7. Nec tamen, 'not ... however.' See the note on _neque enim,_ 7, 12.    8. movébant. Contrast this tense with appropinquáverant and excitátí  sunt.    13. Tálí modó = _hóc modó_, 4, 20.    20. á pueró, 'from a boy,' 'from boyhood.'    exercébat, the imperfect of customary action, as is also cónsúmébat.    24. autem. See the note on 5, 8.    25. artí, dative of indirect object with the intransitive verb studébat.    10. 2. omnibus víribus, 'with all his might,' ablative of manner.    3. é vítá. Notice that the preposition denoting separation appears both  with the noun and in the verb. Compare _in átrium inrúpit_, 7, 3.    4. neque quisquam, 'and not any one,' _i.e_. 'and no one.' _Quisquam_ is  used chiefly in negative sentences.    5. voluit, 'was willing.'    7. facit. See the note on 4, 25.    8. nómine. See the note on 5, 8.    9. vir crúdélissimus, not 'cruelest man,' but 'most cruel man.' The  superlative is often thus used to denote simply a high degree of the  quality.    cónsuéverat. Inceptive verbs end in _scó_ and denote the beginning of an  action or state. The perfect and pluperfect of such verbs often represent  the state of things resulting from the completion of the action, and are  then to be translated as present and imperfect respectively. So  _cónsuéscó_ = 'I am becoming accustomed,' _cónsuéví_ = 'I have become  accustomed' or 'am accustomed,' _cónsuéveram_ = 'I had become accustomed'  or 'was accustomed.'    11. sacrifició, 'for the sacrifice,' dative of purpose.    ea. Why is diés feminine here? See the note on _certam_, 5, 13.    12. omnia. See the note on 5, 13.    15. capitibus, dative of indirect object after the compound verb _(in +  pónó)_.    16. iam. The omission of the conjunction that would naturally join this  clause with the preceding, and the repetition of _iam_, which thus in a  way connects the two clauses, reflect the imminence of the danger and  heighten our anxiety for the hero. Observe too how the tenses of the  verbs contribute to the vividness of the picture. We see Hercules at the  altar and the priest, knife in hand, about to give the fatal blow.    18. alteró. Supply _íctú_.    19. Thébís, locative case. Notice that some names of towns are plural in  form.    21. Thébánís, dative with the adjective fínitimí.    autem, 'now.'    22. Thébás. Names of towns are used without a preposition to express the  place to which.    23. veniébant, postulábant, imperfect of customary action.    25. cívís suós, 'his fellow-citizens.' Compare 5, 10.    hóc stípendió, ablative of separation.    27. atque. This conjunction adds an important statement by way of  supplement. Here the meaning is something like 'and not only that, but.'    11. 11. conversa. _Est_ and _sunt_ are frequently not expressed with the  perfect participle.    17. suós ipse suá. Notice how the enormity of the crime is emphasized by  the use of all these words repeating the same idea.    23. óráculum Delphicum. See the note on 5, 6.    hóc óráculum omnium = _hóc omnium óráculórum_.    25. Hóc in templó. Monosyllabic prepositions often stand between the  noun and an adjective modifying it.    12. 1. quí. Remember that the relative pronoun agrees in gender, number,  and person with its antecedent; that its case depends upon its use. How  are the person and number of quí shown?    2. hominibus. See the note on 9, 2.    4. neque. See the note on 6, 8.    7. Tíryntha. This is a Greek"]]]
