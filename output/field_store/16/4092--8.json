A wonderful space of green and  purple stretched away before her, and into it she waded. It came up to  her knees, rich, thick, soft, and redolent of blossom and ripeness. Hard  tramping it soon got to be. She grew hot and breathless, and her legs  ached from the force expended in making progress through the tangled  hay. At last she was almost across the field, far from the cutters, and  here she flung herself, to roll and lie flat and gaze up through the  deep azure of sky, wonderingly, as if to penetrate its secret. And then  she hid her face in the fragrant thickness that seemed to force a  whisper from her.    \"I wonder--how will I feel--when I see him--again.... Oh, I wonder!\"    The sound of the whispered words, the question, the inevitableness of  something involuntary, proved traitors to her happy dreams, her  assurance, her composure. She tried to burrow under the hay, to hide  from that tremendous bright-blue eye, the sky. Suddenly she lay very  quiet, feeling the strange glow and throb and race of her blood, sensing  the mystery of her body, trying to trace the thrills, to control this  queer, tremulous, internal state. But she found she could not think  clearly; she could only feel. And she gave up trying. It was sweet to  feel.    She rose and went on. Another field lay beyond, a gradual slope, covered  with a new growth of alfalfa. It was a light green--a contrast to the  rich darkness of that behind her. At the end of this field ran a swift  little brook, clear and musical, open to the sky in places, and in  others hidden under flowery banks. Birds sang from invisible coverts; a  quail sent up clear flutelike notes; and a lark caroled, seemingly out  of the sky.    Lenore wet her feet crossing the brook, and, climbing the little knoll  above, she sat down upon a stone to dry them in the sun. It had a burn  that felt good. No matter how hot the sun ever got there, she liked it.  Always there seemed air to breathe and the shade was pleasant.    From this vantage-point, a favorite one with Lenore, she could see all  the alfalfa-fields, the hill crowned by the beautiful white-and-red  house, the acres of garden, and the miles of orchards. The grazing and  grain fields began behind her.    The brook murmured below her and the birds sang. She heard the bees  humming by. The air out here was clear of scent of fruit and hay, and it  bore a drier odor, not so sweet. She could see the workmen, first those  among the alfalfa, and then the men, and women, too, bending over on the  vegetable-gardens. Likewise she could see the gleam of peaches, apples,  pears and plums--a colorful and mixed gleam, delightful to the eye.    Wet or dry, it seemed that her feet refused to stay still, and once  again she was wandering. A gray, slate-colored field of oats invited her  steps, and across this stretch she saw a long yellow slope of barley,  where the men were cutting. Beyond waved the golden fields of wheat.  Lenore imagined that when she reached them she would not desire to  wander farther.    There were two machines cutting on the barley slope, one drawn by eight  horses, and the other by twelve. When Lenore had crossed the oat-field  she discovered a number of strange men lounging in the scant shade of a  line of low trees that separated the fields. Here she saw Adams, the  foreman; and he espied her at the same moment. He had been sitting down,  talking to the men. At once he rose to come toward Lenore.    \"Is your father with you?\" he asked.    \"No; he's too slow for me,\" replied Lenore. \"Who are these men?\"    \"They're strangers looking for jobs.\"    \"I.W.W. men?\" queried Lenore, in lower voice.    \"Surely must be,\" he replied. Adams was not a young, not a robust man,  and he seemed to carry a burden of worry. \"Your father said he would  come right out.\"    \"I hope he doesn't,\" said Lenore, bluntly. \"Father has a way with him,  you know.\"    \"Yes, I know. And it's the way we're needing here in the Valley,\"  replied the foreman, significantly.    \"Is that the new harvester-thresher father just bought?\" asked Lenore,  pointing to the huge machine, shining and creeping behind the twelve  horses.    \"Yes, that's the McCormack and it's a dandy,\" returned Adams. \"With  machines like that we can get along without the I.W.W.\"    \"I want a ride on it,\" declared Lenore, and she ran along to meet the  harvester. She waved her hand to the driver, Bill Jones, another old  hand, long employed by her father. Bill hauled back on the many-branched  reins, and when the horses stopped the clattering, whirring roar of the  machine also ceased.    \"Howdy, miss! Reckon this 's a regular I.W.W. hold-up.\"    \"Worse than that, Bill,\" gaily replied Lenore as she mounted the  platform where another man sat on a bag of barley. Lenore did not  recognize him. He looked rugged and honest, and beamed upon her.    \"Watch out fer yer dress,\" he said, pointing with grimy hand to the  dusty wheels and braces so near her.    \"Let me drive, Bill?\" she asked.    \"Wal, now, I wisht I could,\" he replied, dryly. \"You sure can drive,  miss. But drivin' ain't all this here job.\"    \"What can't I do? I'll bet you--\"    \"I never seen a girl that could throw anythin' straight. Did you?\"    \"Well, not so very. I forgot how you drove the horses.... Go ahead.  Don't let me delay the harvest.\"    Bill called sonorously to his twelve horses, and as they bent and  strained and began to bob their heads, the clattering roar filled the  air. Also a cloud of dust and thin, flying streams of chaff enveloped  Lenore. The high stalks of barley, in wide sheets, fell before the  cutter upon an apron, to be carried by feeders into the body of the  machine. The straw, denuded of its grain, came out at the rear, to be  dropped, while the grain streamed out of a tube on the side next to  Lenore, to fall into an open sack. It made a short shift of harvesting.    Lenore liked the even, nodding rhythm of the plodding horses, and the  way Bill threw a pebble from a sack on his seat, to hit this or that  horse not keeping in line or pulling his share. Bill's aim was unerring.  He never hit the wrong horse, which would have been the case had he used  a whip. The grain came out in so tiny a stream that Lenore wondered how  a bag was ever filled. But she saw presently that even a tiny stream, if  running steadily, soon made bulk. That was proof of the value of small  things, even atoms.    No marvel was it that Bill and his helper were as grimy as stokers of a  furnace. Lenore began to choke with the fine dust and to feel her eyes  smart and to see it settle on her hands and dress. She then had  appreciation of the nature of a ten-hour day for workmen cutting  eighteen acres of barley. How would they ever cut the two thousand acres  of wheat? No wonder many men were needed. Lenore sympathized with the  operators of that harvester-thresher, but she did not like the dirt. If  she had been a man, though, that labor, hard as it was, would have  appealed to her. Harvesting the grain was beautiful, whether in the old,  slow method of threshing or with one of these modern man-saving  machines.    She jumped off, and the big, ponderous thing, almost gifted with  intelligence, it seemed to Lenore, rolled on with its whirring roar,  drawing its cloud of dust, and leaving behind a litter of straw.    It developed then that Adams had walked along with the machine, and he  now addressed her.    \"Will you be staying here till your father comes?\" he asked.    \"No, Mr. Adams. Why do you ask?\"    \"You oughtn't come out here alone or go back alone.... All these strange  men! Some of them hard customers! You'll excuse me, miss, but this  harvest is not like other harvests.\"    \"I'll wait for my father and I'll not go out of sight,\" replied Lenore.  Thanking the foreman for his thoughtfulness, she walked away, and soon  she stood at the edge of the first wheat-field.    The grain was not yet ripe but near at hand it was a pale gold. The  wind, out of the west, waved and swept the wheat, while the almost  imperceptible shadows followed.    A road half overgrown with grass and goldenrod bordered the wheat-field,  and it wound away down toward the house. Her father appeared mounted on  the white horse he always rode. Lenore sat down in the grass to wait for  him. Nodding stalks of goldenrod leaned to her face. When looked at  closely, how truly gold their color! Yet it was not such a gold as that  of the rich blaze of ripe wheat. She was admitting to her consciousness  a jealousy of anything comparable to wheat. And suddenly she confessed  that her natural love for it had been augmented by a subtle growing  sentiment. Not sentiment about the war or the need of the Allies or  meaning of the staff of life. She had sensed young Dorn's passion for  wheat and it had made a difference to her.    \"No use lying to myself!\" she soliloquized. \"I think of him!.. I can't  help it... I ran out here, wild, restless, unable to reason... just  because I'd decided to see him again--to make sure I--I really didn't  care.... How furious--how ridiculous I'll feel--when--when--\"    Lenore did not complete her thought, because she was not sure. Nothing  could be any truer than the fact that she had no idea how she would  feel. She began sensitively to distrust herself. She who had always been  so sure of motives, so contented with things as they were, had been  struck by an absurd fancy that haunted because it was fiercely  repudiated and scorned, that would give her no rest until it was proven  false. But suppose it were true!    A succeeding blankness of mind awoke to the clip-clop of hoofs and her  father's cheery halloo.    Anderson dismounted and, throwing his bridle, he sat down heavily beside  her.    \"You can ride back home,\" he said.    Lenore knew she had been reproved for her wandering out there, and she  made a motion to rise. His big hand held her down.    \"No hurry, now I'm"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10251"],[0,"Town Geology (#12)"],[1,"dry land between France and England, and fed by   the side of animals which have long since retreated to Norway and to   Canada.  I should have liked to tell the archaeologist of the human   beings--probably from their weapons and their habits--of the same   race as the present Laplanders, who passed northward as the ice went   back, following the wild reindeer herds from the South of France into   our islands, which were no islands then, to be in their turn driven   northward by stronger races from the east and south.  But space   presses, and I fear that I have written too much already.    At least, I have turned over for you a few grand and strange pages in   the book of nature, and taught you, I hope, a key by which to   decipher their hieroglyphics.  At least, I have, I trust, taught you   to look, as I do, with something of interest, even of awe, upon the   pebbles in the street.        III.  THE STONES IN THE WALL        This is a large subject.  For in the different towns of these   islands, the walls are built of stones of almost every age, from the   earliest to the latest; and the town-geologist may find a quite   different problem to solve in the nearest wall, on moving from one   town to another twenty miles off.  All I can do, therefore, is to   take one set of towns, in the walls of which one sort of stones is   commonly found, and talk of them; taking care, of course, to choose a   stone which is widely distributed.  And such, I think, we can find in   the so-called New Red sandstone, which, with its attendant marls,   covers a vast tract--and that a rich and busy one--of England.  From   Hartlepool and the mouth of the Tees, down through Yorkshire and   Nottinghamshire; over the manufacturing districts of central England;   down the valley of the Severn; past Bristol and the Somersetshire   flats to Torquay in South Devon; up north-westward through Shropshire   and Cheshire; past Liverpool and northward through Lancashire;   reappearing again, north of the Lake mountains, about Carlisle and   the Scotch side of the Solway Frith, stretches the New Red sandstone   plain, from under which everywhere the coal-bearing rocks rise as   from a sea.  It contains, in many places, excellent quarries of   building-stone; the most famous of which, perhaps, are the well-known   Runcorn quarries, near Liverpool, from which the old Romans brought   the material for the walls and temples of ancient Chester, and from   which the stone for the restoration of Chester Cathedral is being   taken at this day.  In some quarters, especially in the north-west of   England, its soil is poor, because it is masked by that very boulder-  clay of which I spoke in my last paper.  But its rich red marls,   wherever they come to the surface, are one of God's most precious   gifts to this favoured land.  On them, one finds oneself at once in a   garden; amid the noblest of timber, wheat, roots, grass which is   green through the driest summers, and, in the western counties,   cider-orchards laden with red and golden fruit.  I know, throughout   northern Europe, no such charming scenery, for quiet beauty and solid   wealth, as that of the New Red marls; and if I wished to show a   foreigner what England was, I should take him along them, from   Yorkshire to South Devon, and say--There.  Is not that a country   worth living for,--and worth dying for if need be?    Another reason which I have for dealing with the New Red sandstone is   this--that (as I said just now) over great tracts of England,   especially about the manufacturing districts, the town-geologist will   find it covered immediately by the boulder clay.    The townsman, finding this, would have a fair right to suppose that   the clay was laid down immediately, or at least soon after, the   sandstones or marls on which it lies; that as soon as the one had   settled at the bottom of some old sea, the other settled on the top   of it, in the same sea.    A fair and reasonable guess, which would in many cases, indeed in   most, be quite true.  But in this case it would be a mistake.  The   sandstone and marls are immensely older than the boulder-clay.  They   are, humanly speaking, some four or five worlds older.    What do I mean?  This--that between the time when the one, and the   time when the other, was made, the British Islands, and probably the   whole continent of Europe, have changed four or five times; in shape;   in height above the sea, or depth below it; in climate; in the kinds   of plants and animals which have dwelt on them, or on their sea-  bottoms.  And surely it is not too strong a metaphor, to call such   changes a change from an old world to a new one.    Mind.  I do not say that these changes were sudden or violent.  It is   far more probable that they are only part and parcel of that vast but   slow change which is going on everywhere over our whole globe.  I   think that will appear probable in the course of this paper.  But   that these changes have taken place, is my main thesis.  The fact I   assert; and I am bound to try and prove it.  And in trying to do so,   I shall no longer treat my readers, as I did in the first two papers,   like children.  I shall take for granted that they now understand   something of the method by which geological problems are worked out;   and can trust it, and me; and shall state boldly the conclusions of   geologists, only giving proof where proof is specially needed.    Now you must understand that in England there are two great divisions   of these New Red sandstones, \"Trias,\" as geologists call them.  An   upper, called in Germany Keuper, which consists, atop, of the rich   red marl, below them, of sandstones, and of those vast deposits of   rock-salt, which have been long worked, and worked to such good   purpose, that a vast subsidence of land has just taken place near   Nantwich in Cheshire; and serious fears are entertained lest the town   itself may subside, to fill up the caverns below, from whence the   salt has been quarried.  Underneath these beds again are those which   carry the building-stone of Runcorn.  Now these beds altogether, in   Cheshire, at least, are about 3,400 feet thick; and were not laid   down in a year, or in a century either.    Below them lies a thousand feet of sandstones, known in Germany by   the name of \"Bunter,\" from its mottled and spotted appearance.  What   lies under them again, does not concern us just now.    I said that the geologists called these beds the Trias; that is, the   triple group.  But as yet we have heard of only two parts of it.    Where is the third?    Not here, but in Germany.  There, between the Keuper above and the   Bunter below, lies a great series of limestone beds, which, from the   abundance of fossils which they contain, go by the name of   Muschelkalk.  A long epoch must therefore have intervened between the   laying down of the Bunter and of the Keuper.  And we have a trace of   that long epoch, even in England.  The Keuper lies, certainly,   immediately on the Bunter; but not always \"conformably\" on it.  That   is, the beds are not exactly parallel.  The Bunter had been slightly   tilted, and slightly waterworn, before the Keuper was laid on it.    It is reasonable, therefore, to suppose, that the Bunter in England   was dry land, and therefore safe from fresh deposit, through ages   during which it was deep enough beneath the sea in Germany, to have   the Muschelkalk laid down on it.  Here again, then, as everywhere, we   have evidence of time--time, not only beyond all counting, but beyond   all imagining.    And now, perhaps, the reader will ask--If I am to believe that all   new land is made out of old land, and that all rocks and soils are   derived from the wear and tear of still older rocks, off what land   came this enormous heap of sands more than 5,000 feet thick in   places, stretching across England and into Germany?    It is difficult to answer.  The shape and distribution of land in   those days were so different from what they are now, that the rocks   which furnished a great deal of our sandstone may be now, for aught I   know, a mile beneath the sea.    But over the land which still stands out of the sea near us there has   been wear and tear enough to account for any quantity of sand   deposit.  As a single instance--It is a provable and proven fact--as   you may see from Mr. Ramsay's survey of North Wales--that over a   large tract to the south of Snowdon, between Port Madoc and Barmouth,   there has been ground off and carried away a mass of solid rock   20,000 feet thick; thick enough, in fact, if it were there still, to   make a range of mountains as high as the Andes.  It is a provable and   proven fact that vast tracts of the centre of poor old Ireland were   once covered with coal-measures, which have been scraped off in   likewise, deprived of inestimable mineral wealth.  The destruction of   rocks--\"denudation\" as it is called--in the district round Malvern,   is, I am told, provably enormous.  Indeed, it is so over all Wales,   North England, and West and North Scotland.  So there is enough of   rubbish to be accounted for to make our New Red sands.  The round   pebbles in it being, I believe, pieces of Old Red sandstone, may have   come from the great Old Red sandstone region of South East Wales and   Herefordshire.  Some of the rubbish, too, may have come from what is   now the Isle of Anglesey.    For you find in the beds, from the top to the bottom (at least in   Cheshire), particles of mica.  Now this mica could not have been   formed in the sand.  It is a definite crystalline mineral, whose   composition is well known.  It is only found in rocks which have been   subjected to immense pressure, and probably to heat.  The granites   and mica-slates of Anglesey are full of it; and from Anglesey--as   likely as from anywhere else--these thin scales of mica came.  And   that is about all that I can say on"]]]
