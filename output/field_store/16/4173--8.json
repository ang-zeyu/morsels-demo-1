CHAPTER 11      BRITAIN'S COLONIAL SYSTEM    [Sidenote: England's early liberal colonial policy.]    [Sidenote: England's changed colonial policy.]    103. Early Colonial Policy.--At the outset, England's rulers had  been very kind to Englishmen who founded colonies. They gave them great  grants of land. They gave them rights of self-government greater than  any Englishmen living in England enjoyed. They allowed them to manage  their own trade and industries as they saw fit. They even permitted them  to worship God as their consciences told them to worship him. But, as  the colonists grew in strength and in riches, Britain's rulers tried to  make their trade profitable to British merchants and interfered in  their government. On their part the colonists disobeyed the navigation  laws and disputed with the royal officials. For years Britain's rulers  allowed this to go on. But, at length, near the close of the last French  war Mr. Pitt ordered the laws to be enforced.    [Sidenote: Difficulties in enforcing the navigation laws.]    [Sidenote: James Otis. _Eggleston_, 163. His speech against writs of  assistance, 1761.]    104. Writs of Assistance, 1761.--It was a good deal easier to order  the laws to be carried out than it was to carry them out. It was almost  impossible for the customs officers to prevent goods being landed  contrary to law. When the goods were once on shore, it was difficult to  seize them. So the officers asked the judges to give them writs of  assistance. Among the leading lawyers of Boston was James Otis. He was  the king's law officer in the province. But he resigned his office and  opposed the granting of the writs. He objected to the use of writs of  assistance because they enabled a customs officer to become a tyrant.  Armed with one of them he could go to the house of a man he did not like  and search it from attic to cellar, turn everything upside down and  break open doors and trunks. It made no difference, said Otis, whether  Parliament had said that the writs were legal. For Parliament could not  make an act of tyranny legal. To do that was beyond the power even of  Parliament.    [Sidenote: Patrick Henry. _Eggleston_, 162.]    [Sidenote: His speech in the Parson's Cause, 1763.]    105. The Parson's Cause, 1763.--The next important case arose in  Virginia and came about in this way. The Virginians made a law  regulating the salaries of clergymen in the colony. The king vetoed the  law. The Virginians paid no heed to the veto. The clergy men appealed to  the courts and the case of one of them was selected for trial. Patrick  Henry, a prosperous young lawyer, stated the opinions of the Virginians  in a speech which made his reputation. The king, he said, had no right  to veto a Virginia law that was for the good of the people. To do so was  an act of tyranny, and the people owed no obedience to a tyrant. The  case was decided for the clergyman. For the law was clearly on his side.  But the jurymen agreed with Henry. They gave the clergyman only one  farthing damages, and no more clergymen brought cases into the court.  The king's veto was openly disobeyed.    [Sidenote: Proclamation of 1763. _McMaster_, 110.]    106. The King's Proclamation of 1763.--In the same year that the  Parson's Cause was decided the king issued a proclamation which greatly  lessened the rights of Virginia and several other colonies to western  lands. Some of the old charter lines, as those of Massachusetts,  Connecticut, Virginia, and the Carolinas had extended to the Pacific  Ocean. By the treaty of 1763 (p. 69) the king, for himself and his  subjects, abandoned all claim to lands west of Mississippi River. Now in  the Proclamation of 1763 he forbade the colonial governors to grant any  lands west of the Alleghany Mountains. The western limit of Virginia and  the Carolinas was fixed. Their pioneers could not pass the mountains and  settle in the fertile valleys of the Ohio and its branches.          CHAPTER 12      TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION    [Sidenote: George III.]    [Sidenote: George Grenville.]    [Sidenote: The British Parliament.]    107. George III and George Grenville.--George III became king in  1760. He was a narrow, stupid, well-meaning, ignorant young man of  twenty-one. He soon found in George Grenville a narrow, dull,  well-meaning lawyer, a man who would do what he was told. So George  Grenville became the head of the government. To him the law was the law.  If he wished to do a thing and could find the law for it, he asked for  nothing more. His military advisers told him that an army must be kept  in America for years. It was Grenville's business to find the money to  support this army. Great Britain was burdened with a national debt. The  army was to be maintained, partly, at least, for the protection of the  colonists. Why should they not pay a part of the cost of maintaining it?  Parliament was the supreme power in the British Empire. It controlled  the king, the church, the army, and the navy. Surely a Parliament that  had all this power could tax the colonists. At all events, Grenville  thought it could, and Parliament passed the Stamp Act to tax them.    [Sidenote: Taxation and representation.]    [Sidenote: Henry's resolutions, 1765. _Higginson_, 161-164; _McMaster_,  112-114.]    108. Henry's Resolutions, 1765.--The colonists, however, with one  voice, declared that Parliament had no power to tax them. Taxes, they  said, could be voted only by themselves or their representatives. They  were represented in their own colonial assemblies, and nowhere else.  Patrick Henry was now a member of the Virginia assembly. He had just  been elected for the first time. But as none of the older members of the  assembly proposed any action, Henry tore a leaf from an old law-book and  wrote on it a set of resolutions. These he presented in a burning  speech, upholding the rights of the Virginians. He said that to tax them  by act of Parliament was tyranny. \"Caesar and Tarquin had each his  Brutus, Charles I his Cromwell, and George III\"--\"Treason, treason,\"  shouted the speaker. \"May profit by their example,\" slowly Henry went  on. \"If that be treason, make the most of it.\" The resolutions were  voted. In them the Virginians declared that they were not subject to  Acts of Parliament laying taxes or interfering in the internal affairs  of Virginia.    [Illustration: HENRY'S FIRST AND LAST RESOLUTIONS (FACSIMILE OF THE  ORIGINAL DRAFT)]    [Sidenote: Opposition to the Stamp Act, 1765. _Higginson_, 164-165;  _McMaster_, 116.]    109. Stamp Act Riots, 1765.--Until the summer of 1765 the colonists  contented themselves with passing resolutions. There was little else  that they could do. They could not refuse to obey the law because it  would not go into effect until November. They could not mob the stamp  distributers because no one knew their names. In August the names of the  stamp distributers were published. Now at last it was possible to do  something besides passing resolutions. In every colony the people  visited the stamp officers and told them to resign. If they refused,  they were mobbed until they resigned. In Boston the rioters were  especially active. They detested Thomas Hutchinson. He was  lieutenant-governor and chief justice and had been active in enforcing  the navigation acts. The rioters attacked his house. They broke his  furniture, destroyed his clothing, and made a bonfire of his books  and papers.    [Sidenote: Colonial congresses.]    [Sidenote: Albany Congress, 1754.]    [Sidenote: Stamp Act Congress, 1765.]    110. The Stamp Act Congress, 1765.--Colonial congresses were no new  thing. There had been many meetings of governors and delegates from  colonial assemblies. The most important of the early congresses was the  Albany Congress of 1754. It was important because it proposed a plan of  union. The plan was drawn up by Benjamin Franklin. But neither the  king nor the colonists liked it, and it was not adopted. All these  earlier congresses had been summoned by the king's officers to arrange  expeditions against the French or to make treaties with the Indians. The  Stamp Act Congress was summoned by the colonists to protest against the  doings of king and Parliament.    [Illustration: PATRICK HENRY \"I am not a Virginian, but an American.\"]    [Sidenote: Declaration of the Rights and Grievances of the Colonists,  1765. _McMaster_, 115.]    111. Work of the Stamp Act Congress.--Delegates from nine colonies  met at New York in October, 1765. They drew up a \"Declaration of the  Rights and Grievances of the Colonists.\" In this paper they declared  that the colonists, as subjects of the British king, had the same rights  as British subjects living in Britain, and were free from taxes except  those to which they had given their consent. They claimed for themselves  the right of trial by jury--which might be denied under the Stamp Act.  But the most important thing about the congress was the fact that nine  colonies had put aside their local jealousies and had joined in  holding it.    [Sidenote: Benjamin Franklin.]    [Sidenote: Examined by the House of Commons.]    112. Franklin's Examination.--Born in Boston, Benjamin Franklin ran  away from home and settled at Philadelphia. By great exertion and  wonderful shrewdness he rose from poverty to be one of the most  important men in the city and colony. He was a printer, a newspaper  editor, a writer, and a student of science."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12426"],[0,"Routledge's Manual of Etiquette (#12)"],[1,"men of their day, Charles the Second and George the Fourth,  never failed to take off their hats to the meanest of their subjects.  Always bear this example in mind; and remember that to nod, or merely  to touch the brim of the hat, is far from courteous. True politeness  demands that the hat should be quite lifted from the head.    On meeting friends with whom you are likely to shake hands, remove  your hat with the left hand in order to leave the right hand free.    If you meet a lady in the street whom you are sufficiently intimate  to address, do not stop her, but turn round and walk beside her in  whichever direction she is going. When you have said all that you wish  to say, you can take your leave.    If you meet a lady with whom you are not particularly well acquainted,  wait for her recognition before you venture to bow to her.    In bowing to a lady whom you are not going to address, lift your hat  with that hand which is farthest from her. For instance, if you pass  her on the right side, use your left hand; if on the left, use your  right.    If you are on horseback and wish to converse with a lady who is on  foot, you must dismount and lead your horse, so as not to give her the  fatigue of looking up to your level. Neither should you subject her  to the impropriety of carrying on a conversation in a tone necessarily  louder than is sanctioned in public by the laws of good breeding.    When you meet friends or acquaintances in the streets, the  exhibitions, or any public places, take care not to pronounce their  names so loudly as to attract the attention of the passers-by. Never  call across the street: and never carry on a dialogue in a public  vehicle, unless your interlocutor occupies the seat beside your own.    In walking with a lady, take charge of any small parcel, parasol, or  book with which she may be encumbered.    If you so far forget what is elegant as to smoke in the street, at  least never omit to fling away your cigar if you speak to a lady.           *       *       *       *       *    VII.--DRESS.      A great French writer has said, with as much grace as philosophy, that  the artist and man of letters needs only a black coat and the absence  of all pretension to place him on the level of the best society.  It must be observed, however, that this remark applies only to the  intellectual workers, who, if they do occasionally commit a minor  solecism in dress or manners, are forgiven on account of their fame  and talents. Other individuals are compelled to study what we have  elsewhere called the \"by-laws of society;\" and it would be well if  artists and men of letters would more frequently do the same. It is  not enough that a man should be clever, or well educated, or well  born; to take his place in society he must be acquainted with all that  this little book proposes to teach. He must, above all else, know  how to enter the room, how to bow, and how to dress. Of these three  indispensable qualifications, the most important, because the most  observed, is the latter.    A gentleman should always be so well dressed that his dress shall  never be observed at all. Does this sound like an enigma? It is not  meant for one. It only implies that perfect simplicity is perfect  elegance, and that the true test of taste in the toilette of a  gentleman is its entire harmony, unobtrusiveness and becomingness. If  any friend should say to you, \"What a handsome waistcoat you have  on!\" you may depend that a less handsome waistcoat would be in better  taste. If you hear it said that Mr. So-and-So wears superb jewellery,  you may conclude beforehand that he wears too much. Display, in short,  is ever to be avoided, especially in matters of dress. The toilette  is the domain of the fair sex. Let a wise man leave its graces and  luxuries to his wife, daughters or sisters, and seek to be himself  appreciated for something of higher worth than the embroidery upon his  shirt front, or the trinkets on his chain.    To be too much in the fashion is as vulgar as to be too far behind  it. No really well-bred man follows every new cut that he sees in his  tailor's fashion-book. Only very young men, and those not of the most  aristocratic circles, are guilty of this folly.    The author of \"Pelham\" has aptly said that a gentleman's coat  should not fit too well. There is great truth and subtlety in this  observation. To be fitted _too_ well is to look like a tailor's  assistant. This is the great fault which we have to find in the style  of even the best bred Frenchmen. They look as if they had just stepped  out of a fashion-book, and lack the careless ease which makes an  English gentleman look as if his clothes belonged to him, and not he  to his clothes.    In the morning wear frock coats, double-breasted waistcoats, and  trousers of light or dark colours, according to the season.    In the evening, though only in the bosom of your own family, wear only  black, and be as scrupulous to put on a dress coat as if you expected  visitors. If you have sons, bring them up to do the same. It is the  observance of these minor trifles in domestic etiquette which marks  the true gentleman.    For evening parties, dinner parties, and balls, wear a black dress  coat, black trousers, black silk or cloth waistcoat, white cravat,  white or grey kid gloves, and thin patent leather boots. A black  cravat may be worn in full dress, but is not so elegant as a white  one. A black velvet waistcoat should only be worn at a dinner party.    Let your jewellery be of the best, but the least gaudy description,  and wear it very sparingly. A set of good studs, a gold watch and  guard, and one handsome ring, are as many ornaments as a gentleman can  wear with propriety. In the morning let your ring be a seal ring,  with your crest or arms engraved upon it. In the evening it may be a  diamond. Your studs, however valuable, should be small.    It is well to remember in the choice of jewellery that mere costliness  is not always the test of value; and that an exquisite work of art,  such as a fine cameo, or a natural rarity, such as a black pearl, is a  more _distingue_ possession than a large brilliant which any rich and  tasteless vulgarian can buy as easily as yourself. For a ring, the  gentleman of fine taste would prefer a precious antique _intaglio_  to the handsomest diamond or ruby that could be brought at Hunt and  Roskell's. The most elegant gentleman with whom the author was ever  acquainted--a man familiar with all the Courts of Europe--never wore  any other shirt-studs in full dress than three valuable black pearls,  each about the size of a pea, and by no means beautiful to look at.    Of all precious stones, the opal is one of the most lovely and the  least common-place. No vulgar man purchases an opal. He invariably  prefers the more showy diamond, ruby, sapphire, or emerald.    Unless you are a snuff-taker, never carry any but a white  pocket-handkerchief.    If in the morning you wear a long cravat fastened by a pin, be careful  to avoid what may be called _alliteration_ of colour. We have seen  a torquoise pin worn in a violet-coloured cravat, and the effect  was frightful. Choose, if possible, complementary colours, and their  secondaries. For instance, if the stone in your pin be a torquoise,  wear it with brown, or crimson mixed with black, or black and orange.  If a ruby, contrast it with shades of green. The same rule holds good  with regard to the mixture and contrast of colours in your waistcoat  or cravat. Thus, a buff waistcoat and a blue tie, or brown and blue,  or brown and green, or brown and magenta, green and magenta, green and  mauve, are all good arrangements of colour.    Very light coloured cloths for morning wear are to be avoided, even  in the height of summer; and fancy cloths of strange patterns and  mixtures are exceedingly objectionable.    Coloured shirts may be worn in the morning; but they should be small  in pattern, and quiet in colour.    With a coloured shirt, always wear a white collar.    Never wear a cap, unless in the fields or garden; and let your hat be  always black.    For a gentleman's wedding dress see the \"ETIQUETTE OF COURTSHIP AND  MARRIAGE.\"    If your sight compels you to wear spectacles, let them be of the best  and lightest make, and mounted in gold or blue steel.    If you suffer from weak sight, and are obliged to wear coloured  glasses, let them be of blue or smoke colour. Green are detestable.    Never be seen in the street without gloves; and never let your gloves  be of any material that is not kid or calf. Worsted or cotton gloves  are unutterably vulgar. Your gloves should fit to the last degree of  perfection.    In these days of public baths and universal progress, we trust that  it is unnecessary to do more than hint at the necessity of the most  fastidious personal cleanliness. The hair, the teeth, the  nails, should be faultlessly kept; and a soiled shirt, a dingy  pocket-handkerchief, or a light waistcoat that has been worn once  too often, are things to be scrupulously avoided by any man who is  ambitious of preserving the exterior of a gentleman.           *       *       *       *       *    VIII.--RIDING AND DRIVING.      In riding, as in walking, give the lady the wall.    If you assist a lady to mount, hold your hand at a convenient distance  from the ground, that she may place her foot in it. As she springs,  you aid her by the impetus of your hand.    In doing this, it is always better to agree upon a signal, that her  spring and your assistance may come at the same moment.    For this purpose there is no better form than the old duelling one of  \"one, two, _three_.\"    When the lady is in the saddle, it is your place to find the stirrup  for her, and guide her left foot to it. When this is done, she rises  in her seat and you assist her to draw her habit straight.    Even when a groom is present, it is more polite for the gentleman"]]]
