Miss Mary grew fond of walking in the sedate and proper woods.  Perhaps she believed, with Mrs. Stidger, that the balsamic odors of  the firs \"did her chest good,\" for certainly her slight cough was less  frequent and her step was firmer; perhaps she had learned the unending  lesson which the patient pines are never weary of repeating to heedful  or listless ears. And so, one day, she planned a picnic on Buckeye Hill,  and took the children with her. Away from the dusty road, the straggling  shanties, the yellow ditches, the clamor of restless engines, the cheap  finery of shop windows, the deeper glitter of paint and colored glass,  and the thin veneering which barbarism takes upon itself in such  localities--what infinite relief was theirs! The last heap of ragged  rock and clay passed, the last unsightly chasm crossed--how the waiting  woods opened their long files to receive them! How the children--perhaps  because they had not yet grown quite away from the breast of the  bounteous Mother--threw themselves face downward on her brown bosom with  uncouth caresses, filling the air with their laughter; and how Miss Mary  herself--felinely fastidious and intrenched as she was in the purity of  spotless skirts, collar, and cuffs--forgot all, and ran like a crested  quail at the head of her brood until, romping, laughing, and panting,  with a loosened braid of brown hair, a hat hanging by a knotted ribbon  from her throat, she came suddenly and violently, in the heart of the  forest, upon--the luckless Sandy!    The explanations, apologies, and not overwise conversation that ensued  need not be indicated here. It would seem, however, that Miss Mary had  already established some acquaintance with this ex-drunkard. Enough that  he was soon accepted as one of the party; that the children, with that  quick intelligence which Providence gives the helpless, recognized a  friend, and played with his blond beard and long silken mustache, and  took other liberties--as the helpless are apt to do. And when he had  built a fire against a tree, and had shown them other mysteries of  woodcraft, their admiration knew no bounds. At the close of two such  foolish, idle, happy hours he found himself lying at the feet of the  schoolmistress, gazing dreamily in her face, as she sat upon the sloping  hillside weaving wreaths of laurel and syringa, in very much the same  attitude as he had lain when first they met. Nor was the similitude  greatly forced. The weakness of an easy, sensuous nature that had found  a dreamy exaltation in liquor, it is to be feared was now finding an  equal intoxication in love.    I think that Sandy was dimly conscious of this himself. I know that he  longed to be doing something--slaying a grizzly, scalping a savage,  or sacrificing himself in some way for the sake of this sallow-faced,  gray-eyed schoolmistress. As I should like to present him in a heroic  attitude, I stay my hand with great difficulty at this moment, being  only withheld from introducing such an episode by a strong conviction  that it does not usually occur at such times. And I trust that my  fairest reader, who remembers that, in a real crisis, it is always some  uninteresting stranger or unromantic policeman, and not Adolphus, who  rescues, will forgive the omission.    So they sat there, undisturbed--the woodpeckers chattering overhead and  the voices of the children coming pleasantly from the hollow below.  What they said matters little. What they thought--which might have been  interesting--did not transpire. The woodpeckers only learned how  Miss Mary was an orphan; how she left her uncle's house, to come to  California, for the sake of health and independence; how Sandy was an  orphan, too; how he came to California for excitement; how he had lived  a wild life, and how he was trying to reform; and other details, which,  from a woodpecker's viewpoint, undoubtedly must have seemed stupid, and  a waste of time. But even in such trifles was the afternoon spent; and  when the children were again gathered, and Sandy, with a delicacy which  the schoolmistress well understood, took leave of them quietly at the  outskirts of the settlement, it had seemed the shortest day of her weary  life.    As the long, dry summer withered to its roots, the school term of Red  Gulch--to use a local euphuism--\"dried up\" also. In another day Miss  Mary would be free; and for a season, at least, Red Gulch would know her  no more. She was seated alone in the schoolhouse, her cheek resting on  her hand, her eyes half-closed in one of those daydreams in which Miss  Mary--I fear to the danger of school discipline--was lately in the habit  of indulging. Her lap was full of mosses, ferns, and other woodland  memories. She was so preoccupied with these and her own thoughts that a  gentle tapping at the door passed unheard, or translated itself into the  remembrance of far-off woodpeckers. When at last it asserted itself more  distinctly, she started up with a flushed cheek and opened the door.  On the threshold stood a woman the self-assertion and audacity of whose  dress were in singular contrast to her timid, irresolute bearing.    Miss Mary recognized at a glance the dubious mother of her anonymous  pupil. Perhaps she was disappointed, perhaps she was only fastidious;  but as she coldly invited her to enter, she half-unconsciously settled  her white cuffs and collar, and gathered closer her own chaste skirts.  It was, perhaps, for this reason that the embarrassed stranger, after a  moment's hesitation, left her gorgeous parasol open and sticking in the  dust beside the door, and then sat down at the farther end of a long  bench. Her voice was husky as she began:    \"I heerd tell that you were goin' down to the Bay tomorrow, and I  couldn't let you go until I came to thank you for your kindness to my  Tommy.\"    Tommy, Miss Mary said, was a good boy, and deserved more than the poor  attention she could give him.    \"Thank you, miss; thank ye!\" cried the stranger, brightening even  through the color which Red Gulch knew facetiously as her \"war paint,\"  and striving, in her embarrassment, to drag the long bench nearer the  schoolmistress. \"I thank you, miss, for that! and if I am his mother,  there ain't a sweeter, dearer, better boy lives than him. And if I ain't  much as says it, thar ain't a sweeter, dearer, angeler teacher lives  than he's got.\"    Miss Mary, sitting primly behind her desk, with a ruler over her  shoulder, opened her gray eyes widely at this, but said nothing.    \"It ain't for you to be complimented by the like of me, I know,\" she  went on, hurriedly. \"It ain't for me to be comin' here, in broad day, to  do it, either; but I come to ask a favor--not for me, miss--not for me,  but for the darling boy.\"    Encouraged by a look in the young schoolmistress's eye, and putting her  lilac-gloved hands together, the fingers downward, between her knees,  she went on, in a low voice:    \"You see, miss, there's no one the boy has any claim on but me, and I  ain't the proper person to bring him up. I thought some, last year, of  sending him away to Frisco to school, but when they talked of bringing  a schoolma'am here, I waited till I saw you, and then I knew it was all  right, and I could keep my boy a little longer. And O, miss, he loves  you so much; and if you could hear him talk about you, in his pretty  way, and if he could ask you what I ask you now, you couldn't refuse  him.    \"It is natural,\" she went on, rapidly, in a voice that trembled  strangely between pride and humility--\"it's natural that he should  take to you, miss, for his father, when I first knew him, was a  gentleman--and the boy must forget me, sooner or later--and so I ain't  goin' to cry about that. For I come to ask you to take my Tommy--God  bless him for the bestest, sweetest boy that lives--to--to--take him  with you.\"    She had risen and caught the young girl's hand in her own, and had  fallen on her knees beside her.    \"I've money plenty, and it's all yours and his. Put him in some good  school, where you can go and see him, and help him to--to--to forget his  mother. Do with him what you like. The worst you can do will be kindness  to what he will learn with me. Only take him out of this wicked life,  this cruel place, this home of shame and sorrow. You will; I know you  will--won't you? You will--you must not, you cannot say no! You will  make him as pure, as gentle as yourself; and when he has grown up, you  will tell him his father's name--the name that hasn't passed my lips  for years--the name of Alexander Morton, whom they call here Sandy! Miss  Mary!--do not take your hand away! Miss Mary, speak to me! You will take  my boy? Do not put your face from me. I know it ought not to look on  such as me. Miss Mary!--my God, be merciful!--she is leaving me!\"    Miss Mary had risen and, in the gathering twilight, had felt her way to  the open window. She stood there, leaning against the casement, her  eyes fixed on the last rosy tints that were fading from the western sky.  There was still some of its light on her pure young forehead, on her  white collar, on her clasped white hands, but all fading slowly away.  The suppliant had dragged herself, still on her knees, beside her.    \"I know it takes time to consider. I will wait here all night; but I  cannot go until you speak. Do not deny me now. You will!--I see it in  your sweet face--such a face as I have seen in my dreams. I see it in  your eyes, Miss Mary!--you will take my boy!\"    The last red beam crept higher, suffused Miss Mary's eyes with something  of its glory, flickered, and faded, and went out. The sun had set on Red  Gulch. In the twilight and silence Miss Mary's voice sounded pleasantly.    \"I will take the boy. Send him to me tonight.\"    The happy mother raised the hem of Miss Mary's skirts to her lips. She  would have buried her hot face in its virgin "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13121"],[0,"A Voyage to Terra Australis — Volume 2 (#12)"],[1,"not be less than five miles an hour. It  will be perceived, that I do not recommend any ship to enter Shoal-water  Bay by this passage.    SATURDAY 28 AUGUST 1802    In the morning, I went in the whale boat to the westward, both to search  for the lost cutter and to advance the survey. In crossing the inner end  of Strong-tide Passage, my soundings were 5, 4, 3, 21/2, 2, 3 fathoms, to a  rock near the south end of Townshend Island, whence it appeared that the  deepest water was close to the Shoals on the eastern side. After  searching along the shore of Townshend Island., and amongst the rocky  islets near it, I crossed the western channel over to the south end of  Leicester Island; where a set of bearings was taken, and the latitude  observed to be 22 deg. 18' 17\" from an artificial horizon. This channel is  about one mile wide, and I proceeded up it until a passage out to sea was  clearly distinguishable; but although there be from 4 to 7 fathoms with a  soft bottom, the deep part is too narrow for a stranger to pass with a  ship. I returned on board in the evening, without having discovered any  traces of the lost cutter or seen any thing worthy of particular notice;  unless it were three of the large bats, called flying foxes at Port  Jackson: when on the wing and at a distance, these animals might be taken  for crows.    SUNDAY 29 AUGUST 1802    On the following morning, we got up the anchor and steered further into  Shoal-water Bay. The land on the western side appeared to be high; and as  the botanists were likely to find more employment there, during the time  of my proposed expedition to the head of the bay, than they could promise  themselves at any other place, I was desirous of leaving the ship on that  side, in a situation convenient for them. After running three miles to  the westward, mostly in 3 fathoms, we anchored in 6, till four o'clock,  and then again weighed. The soundings became very irregular; and at five,  seeing a shoal which extended up and down the middle of the bay, we  tacked from it and came to, in 5 fathoms soft bottom, it being then low  water.    Mount Westall bore                     N. 86 deg. E.  Leicester Island, the south end,       N.  9  W.  Pine Mount,                            S. 78  W.    The western land was still six or seven miles distant, but there was no  prospect of getting nearer, without taking time to make a previous  examination of the shoal; and I therefore embarked early next morning  [MONDAY 30 AUGUST 1802] on board the brig, and proceeded towards the head  of the Bay.    Steering south-eastward, in a slanting course up the bay from the middle  shoal, we had from 5 to 8 fathoms; and passed a shallow opening in the  eastern low shore, four miles above Strong-tide Passage. Three miles  higher up there was another opening, near two miles in width; and the  wind being then light and foul, I quitted the brig and proceeded three  miles up in my boat, when the arm was found to be divided into two  branches. Pursuing that which led eastward in a line for Port Bowen, and  was three-quarters of a mile wide, I carried a diminishing depth, from 6  fathoms to six feet, above two miles further; and the branch then  terminated at the foot of a ridge of hills. I wished much to ascend this  ridge, believing that Westwater Head in Port Bowen, lay close at the  back; but the shore was so defended by mud flats and interwoven  mangroves, that it was impossible to land.    The other branch of the eastern arm led south-eastward, and was a mile  wide, with a depth of 6 fathoms as far as two miles above the division;  it then separated into three, but the entrances were shallow and the  borders every where muddy and covered with mangroves. I therefore  returned to the brig which had anchored at the entrance of the branch;  and in the night, we dropped out of the eastern arm with the tide, to be  ready for going up the bay with the morning's flood.    TUESDAY 31 AUGUST 1802    On the 31st, in steering for the middle of the bay, the brig grounded  upon a spit which runs out from the south point of entrance to the  eastern arm, and I believe extends so far down the bay as to join the  middle shoal near the ship. The bottom was muddy, and the rising tide  soon floated her; but our progress being slow, I went onward in the boat  and got into a channel of a mile wide, with regular soundings from 6 to 4  fathoms.    Abreast of the eastern arm, the width of the bay had diminished to about  four miles; and in advancing upwards, I found it to go on contracting  until, at four miles above the arm, the shores were less than one mile  asunder, and the head of the bay assumed the form of a river, though the  water remained quite salt. The depth here was from 4 to 6 fathoms; and  the east side of the contracted part being a little elevated, I was able  to land and take a set of angles to fix its position. The width and depth  continued nearly the same two miles higher up, to a woody islet in the  middle of the channel; where the latitude 22 deg. 37' 6\" was observed from an  artificial horizon, and more bearings taken.    A ship may get up as high as this islet, for the channel is no where less  than half a mile wide, nor the depth in it under 3 fathoms; but there the  stream divides into several branches, which appeared to terminate amongst  the mangroves, similar to the branches of the eastern arm. The largest  runs S. S. E; and I could see three or four miles up it, near to the foot  of the hills behind Cape Manifold, where it probably ends, as did the  southern arm of Port Bowen.    The islet had been visited by Indians, and several trees upon it were  notched, similar to what is done by the people of Port Jackson when they  ascend in pursuit of opossums. Upon the main, to the west of the islet,  where I walked a mile inland, fire Places and other signs of inhabitants  were numerous, and still more so were those of the kangaroo; yet neither  that animal nor an Indian was seen. Around the extinguished fires were  scattered the bones of turtle, and the shells of crabs, periwinkles, and  oysters of the small kind; and in the low grounds I observed many holes,  made apparently by the natives in digging for fern roots. An iguana of  between two and three feet long, which lay upon the branch of a high tree  watching for its prey, was the sole animal killed; but the mud banks are  frequented at low water by sea pies of both kinds, curlews, and small  cranes.    The soil was stiff, shallow, and often stony; the vegetation consisted of  two or three species of _eucalyptus_ and the _casuarina_, not thickly set  nor large--of several kinds of shrubs, amongst which a small grass-tree  was abundant--and of grass, with which the rest of the soil was thinly  overspread.    After making my observations, I rejoined the Lady Nelson two miles below  the woody islet; but the wind blowing fresh up the bay, and the brig  being leewardly, went on and with some difficulty landed on the west  side, opposite to the entrance of the eastern arm. This part is stony;  but equally low with the rest of the shores, and is probably an island at  high water. A confined set of bearings was taken here; and the sun being  then nearly down and the brig at anchor, I went on board for the night.  Next afternoon [WEDNESDAY 1 SEPTEMBER 1802], when the ebb tide enabled  the vessel to make progress against the strong north-west wind, we beat  down in a channel of between one and two miles wide, with soundings from  2 to 8 fathoms; but they were not regular, for the depth was less in some  parts of the middle than at the sides of the channel. The wind moderated  in the evening; and being then within three miles of the ship, I quitted  the brig, and got on board at sunset.    One object of my research in this expedition had been the lost cutter,  and orders had been left with lieutenant Fowler to send again into  Strong-tide Passage upon the same errand, but all was without success.    During my absence, the naturalist and other gentlemen had gone over in  the launch to the west side of the bay, where they had an interview with  sixteen natives; their appearance was described as being much inferior to  the inhabitants of Keppel and Hervey's Bays, but they were peaceable, and  seemed to be very hungry. They had bark canoes which, though not so well  formed, were better secured at the ends than those of Port Jackson; and  in them were spears neatly pointed with pieces of quartz, for striking  turtle. The number of bones lying about their fire places bespoke turtle  to be their principal food; and with the addition of shell fish, and  perhaps fern roots, it is probably their sole support.    The same muddy flats which rendered landing so difficult in the upper  parts of the bay, run off to some distance from the shore under _Double  Mount_; and the land is low for two or three miles back. The hills then  rise, ridge over ridge to a considerable elevation; and at the top are  several hummocks, of which two, higher than the rest, obtained for this  high land its present name. So far as the gentlemen were able to ascend,  the hills were found to be tolerably well covered with pines and other  trees; and the soil of the vallies was better than in those near Mount  Westall on the opposite side of the bay.    THURSDAY 2 SEPTEMBER 1802    Early on the 2nd the brig rejoined; and the wind being at S. by E., we  steered across towards Pine Mount, passing over the shoal in sixteen  feet. In crossing the middle channel, our soundings increased to 9, and  then diminished to less than 3 fathoms upon a second shoal, the width of  the channel here being not quite three miles. On the west side of the  second shoal is another channel, nearly as wide as the former; and the  greatest depth in it, reduced to low water as usual, was 8 fathoms. The  water shoaled again suddenly on approaching the west side of the bay, and  obliged us to veer round off; we "]]]
