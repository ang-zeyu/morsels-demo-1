I will now describe two microphones in which there is a shaking or  jolting motion, and loose contacts, and no variation of pressure of the  carbons against one another, and both of these microphones when used  with an induction coil and battery give most excellent articulation. One  of these microphones is made as follows: Two flat plates of carbon are  secured to a block of cork, insulated from each other; into a hole of  each carbon a pin of carbon fits loosely, projecting above the carbons;  another flat piece of carbon, having two holes in it, bridges over the  two lower carbons, being kept in its place by the pins of carbon which  fit loosely in the holes in it, the bottom carbons being connected with  the battery; a block of cork has a flat side of it cut out so as when  secured to the lower cork the carbons will not come in contact with it,  yet be close enough to it to keep the carbons from falling apart. The  cork covering the carbons forms a dome.    Any good telephone receiver when used in connection with this  microphone, reproduces articulate speech with remarkable distinctness,  especially hissing sounds, and with a loud and full tone.    A description of this microphone was published in _La Lumiere  Electrique_, of 15th April, 1882, and a drawing thereof on 29th April of  same year.    Another form of microphone is made as follows: Two blocks of gas carbon,  C, B, each about one and a half inches long and one inch square, having  each a circular hole one and a quarter inches deep and half inch in  diameter; these two blocks are embedded in a block of cork, C, about  one-quarter of an inch apart, these holes facing each other, each block  forming a terminal of the battery and induction coil; a pencil of  carbon, C, P, about three-eighths of an inch in diameter, and two inches  long, having a ring of ebonite, V, fixed around its center, is placed in  the holes of the two fixed blocks; the ebonite ring fitting loosely in  between the two blocks so as to prevent the pencil from touching the  bottom of the holes in the blocks. The space between the blocks is  closed with wax, W, to exclude the air, but not to touch the ring on the  pencil. A block of cork fitting close to the carbon blocks on all sides  is then firmly secured to the other block of cork. The microphone should  lie horizontally or at a slight angle.    This microphone produces in any good telephone perfect articulation in a  loud and full tone. In these microphones there is certainly \"looseness  and delicacy of contact,\" and there is a \"jolting or shaking motion,\"  and it does not seem possible that there can be any \"pressure of one  carbon against another.\"    I repeat the question I asked at the beginning of this communication,  and hope that it may elicit from you, or some of our scientific men, an  explanation of the theory of the action of this form of microphone.    W.C. BARNEY.           *       *       *       *       *          THE DEMBINSKI MICROPHONIC TELEPHONE TRANSMITTER.      This apparatus, which is shown by Figs. 1, 2, and 3, consists of a  wooden case, A, of oblong shape, closed by a lid fixed by hinges to the  top or one side of the case. The lid is actually a frame for holding a  piece of wire gauze, L L, through which the sound waves from the voice  can pass. In the case a flat shallow box, E F (or several boxes), is  placed, on the lid of which the carbon microphone, D C (Figs. 1 and 3),  which is of the ordinary construction, is placed. The box is of thin  wood, coated inside with petroleum lamp black, for the purpose of  increasing the resonance. It is secured in two lateral slides, fixed to  the case. The bottom of the box is pierced with two openings, resembling  those in a violin (Fig. 2). Lengthwise across the bottom are stretched a  series of brass spiral springs, G G G, which are tuned to a chromatic  scale. On the bottom of the case a similar series of springs, not shown,  are secured. The apparatus is provided with an induction coil, J, which  is connected to the microphone, battery, and telephone receiver (which  may be of any known description) in the usual manner.    [Illustration: Fig. 1.]    The inventors claim that the use of the vibrating springs give to the  transmitter an increased power over those at present in use. They state  that the instrument has given very satisfactory results between Ostende  and Arlon, a distance of 314 kilometers (about 200 miles). It does not  appear, however, that microphones of the ordinary Gower-Bell type, for  example, were tried in competition with the new invention, and in the  absence of such tests the mere fact that very satisfactory results were  obtained over a length of 200 miles proves very little. With reference  to a statement that whistling could be very clearly heard, we may remark  that experience has many times proved that the most indifferent form of  transmitter will almost always respond well and even powerfully to such  forms of vibration.--_Electrical Review_.    [Illustration: Fig. 2.]    [Illustration: Fig. 3.]           *       *       *       *       *          NEW GAS LIGHTERS.      We are going to make known to our readers two new styles of electric  lighters whose operation is sure and quick, and the use of which is just  as economical as that of those quasi-incombustible little pieces of wood  that we have been using for some years under the name of matches.    [Illustration: Fig. 1.--MODE OF USING THE GAS LIGHTER.]    The first of these is a portable apparatus designed for lighting gas  burners, and is based upon the calorific properties of the electric  spark produced by the induction bobbin. Its internal arrangement is such  as to permit of its being used with a pile of very limited power and  dimensions. The apparatus has the form of a rod of a length that may be  varied at will, according to the height of the burner to be lighted, and  which terminates at its lower part in an ebonite handle about 4  centimeters in width by 20 in length (Fig. 1). This handle is divided  into two parts, which are shown isolatedly in Fig. 2, and contains the  pile and bobbin. The arrangement of the pile, A, is kept secret, and all  that we can say of it is that zinc and chloride of silver are employed  as a depolarizer. It is hermetically closed, and carries at one of its  extremities a disk, B, and a brass ring, C, attached to its poles and  designed to establish a communication between the pile and bobbin when  the two parts of the apparatus are screwed together. To this end, two  elastic pieces, D and E, fit against B and C and establish a contact. It  is asserted that the pile is capable of being used 25,000 times before  it is necessary to recharge it. H is an ebonite tube that incloses and  protects the induction bobbin, K, whose induced wire communicates on the  one hand with the brass tube, L, and on the other with an insulated  central conductor, M, which terminates at a point very near the  extremity of the brass tube. The currents induced in this wire produce a  series of sparks between the tube, L, and the rod, M, which light the  gas when the extremity of the apparatus is placed in proximity with the  burner.    [Illustration: Fig. 2. MECHANISM OR THE INDUCTION SPARK GAS LIGHTER.]    The ingenious and new part of the system lies in the mode of exciting  the induced currents. When the extremity of the tube, L, is brought near  the gas burner that is to be lighted, it is only necessary to shove the  botton, F, from left to right in order to produce a _limited_ number of  sparks sufficient to effect the lighting. The motion of the button has  not for effect, as might be believed, the closing of the circuit of the  pile upon the inducting circuit of the bobbin. In fact in its normal  position, the vibrator is distant from its contact, and the closing of  the circuit would produce no action. The motion of F produces a  _mechanical_ motion of the spring of the vibrator, which latter acts for  a few instants and produces a certain number of contacts that give rise  to an equal number of sparks. Owing to this arrangement, the expenditure  of electric energy required by each lighting is limited; and, an another  hand, the vibrator, which would be incapable of operating if it had to  be set in motion by the direct current from the pile, can be actuated  _mechanically_. As the motion of the vibrator is derived from the hand  of the operator, and not from the pile, it will be comprehended that the  latter can, everything being equal,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11414"],[0,"In the Claws of the German Eagle (#12)"],[1,"    \"It is your food and you will need every bit of it.\"    In the name of camaraderie I persuaded each to take a piece of  bread and chocolate. They received this offering with profound  gratitude. With much cautioning and many solemn Auf Wiedersehens  bestowed upon me, I was off again.    Below Vise an entirely new vista opened to me. Tens of thousands  of soldiers were marching over the pontoon bridges already flung  across the river. Perhaps five hundred more were engaged in  building a steel bridge which seemed to be a hurried but  remarkable piece of engineering. It was replacing the old structure  which had been dynamited by the Belgians, and which now lay a  tangled mass of wreckage in the river.    For the next eight miles to Jupilles the country was quite as much  alive as the first four miles were dead. It was swarming with the  military. Through all the gaps in the hills above the River Meuse  the German army came pouring down like an enormous tidal  wave--a tidal wave with a purpose, viz: to fling itself against the  Allies arranged in battle line at Namur, and with the overwhelming  mass of numbers to smash that line to bits and sweep on  resistlessly into Paris. I thought of the Blue and Red wall of French  and English down there awaiting this Gray-Green tide of Teutons.    By the hundreds of thousands they were coming; patrols of cavalry  clattering along, the hoof-beats of the chargers coming with  regular cadence on the hard roads; silent moving riders mounted  on bicycles, their guns strapped on their backs; armored  automobiles rumbling slowly on, but taking the occasional spaces  which opened in the road with a hollow roaring sound and at a  terrific pace; individual horsemen galloping up and down the road  with their messages, and the massed regiments of dust-begrimed  men marching endlessly by.    I was glad to have the spell which had been woven on me broken  by strains of music from a wayside cafe, or rather the remains of a  cafe, for the windows had been demolished and wreckage was  strewn about the door, but the piano within had survived the  ravages. Though it was sadly out of tune, the officer, seated on a  beer keg, was evoking a noise from its battered keys, and to its  accompaniment some soldiers were bawling lustily:    \"Deutschland, Deutschland uber Alles!\"    The only other music that echoed up along those river cliffs came  from a full-throated Saxon regiment.    Evidently the Belgians from Vise to Liege had not roused the ire of  the invaders as furiously as had the natives on the other side of  Vise. They had as a whole established more or less friendly  relations with the alien hosts.    On the other side of Vise nothing had availed to stay the wrath of  the Germans. Flags of truce made of sheets and pillow-cases and  white petticoats were hung out on poles and broom handles; but  many of these houses before which they hung had been burned to  the ground as had the others.    One Belgian had sought for his own benefit to conciliate the  Germans, and as the Kaiser's troops at the turn of the road came  upon his house, there was the Kaiser's emblem with the double-  headed eagle raised to greet them. The man had nailed it high up  in an apple tree, that they might not mistake his attitude of truckling  disloyalty to his own country, hoping so to save his home. But let it  be said to the credit of the Germans, that they had shown their  contempt for this treachery by razing this house to the ground, and  the poor fellow has lost his earthly treasures along with his soul.    I now came upon some houses that were undamaged and  showed signs of life therein. Below Argenteau there was a vine-  covered cottage before which stood a peasant woman guarding  her little domain. Her weapon was not a rifle but several buckets of  water and a pleasant smile. I ventured to ask how she used the  water. She had no time to explain, for at that very moment a  column of soldiers came slowly plodding down the dusty road. She  motioned me away as though she would free herself from whatever  stigma my presence might incur. A worried look clouded her face,  as though she were saying to herself: \"I know that we have been  spared so far by all the brigands which have gone by, but perhaps  here at last is the band that has been appointed to wipe us out.\"    This water, then, was a peace-offering, a plea for mercy.    As soon as the soldiers looked her way she put a smile on her  face, but it ill concealed her anxiety. She pointed invitingly to her  pails. At the sight of the water a thirsty soldier here and there  would break from the ranks, rush to the pails, take the proffered  cup, and hastily swallow down the cooling draught. Then returning  the cup to the woman, he would rush back again to his place in the  ranks. Perhaps a dozen men removed their helmets, and, extracting  a sponge from the inside, made signs to the woman to pour water  on it; then, replacing the sponge in the helmet, marched on refreshed  and rejoicing.    A mounted officer, spying this little oasis, drew rein and gave the  order to halt. The troopers, very wearied by the long forced march,  flung themselves down upon the grass while the officer's horse  thrust his nose deep into the pail and greedily sucked the water  up. More buckets were being continually brought out. Some of  them must surely have been confiscated from her neighbors who  had fled. The officer, dismounting, sought to hold converse with his  hostess, but even with many signs it proved a failure. They both  laughed heartily together, though her mirth I thought a bit forced.    I do not remember witnessing any finer episode in all the war than  that enacted in this region where the sky was red with flames from  the neighbors' houses, and the lintels red with blood from their  veins. A frail little soul with only spiritual weapons, she fought for  her hearth against a venging host in arms; facing these rough war-  stained men, she forced her trembling body to outward calm and  graciousness. Her nerve was not unappreciated. Not one soldier  returned his cup without a word of thanks and a look of admiration.    Nor did this pluck go unrewarded. Three months later, passing  again through this region as a prisoner, I glimpsed the little cottage  still standing in its plot by the flowing river. I want to visit it again  after the war. It will always be to me a shrine of the spirit's splendid  daring.          Chapter VII    A Duelist From Marburg        A squad of soldiers stretched out on a bank beckoned me to join  them; I did so and at once they begged for news. They were not of  an order of super-intelligence, and informed me that it was the  French they were to fight at Liege. Unaware that England had  entered the lists against Germany, \"Belgium\" was only a word to  them. I took it upon myself to clear up their minds on these points.  An officer overheard and plainly showed his disapproval of such  missionary activity, yet he could not conceal his own curiosity. I  sought to appease him by volunteering some information.    \"Japan,\" I blandly announced, \"is about to join the foes of  Germany.\" As the truth, that was unassailable; but as diplomacy it  was a wretched fluke.    \"You're a fool!\" he exploded. \"What are you talking about? Japan  is one of our best friends, almost as good as America. Those two  nations will fight for us--not against us. You're verruckt.\"    That was a severe stricture but in the circumstances I thought best  to overlook the reflection upon my mentality. One of the soldiers  passed some witticism, evidently at my expense; taking advantage  of the outburst of laughter, I made off down the road. They did not  offer to detain me. The officer probably reasoned that my being  there was guarantee enough of my right to be there, taking it for  granted that the regular sentries on the road had passed upon my  credentials. However, I made a very strong resolution hereafter to  be less zealous in my proclamation of the truth, to hold my tongue  and keep walking.    In the midst of my reflections I was startled by a whistle, and,  looking back, saw in the distance a puff of steam on what I  supposed was the wholly abandoned railway, but there, sure  enough, was a train rattling along at a good rate. I could make out  soldiers with guns sitting upon the tender, and presumed that they  were with these instruments directing the operations of some  Belgian engineer and fireman. In a moment more I saw I was  mistaken, for at the throttle was a uniformed soldier, and another  comrade in his gray-green costume was shoveling coal into the  furnace. One of the guards, seeing me plodding on, smilingly  beckoned to me to jump aboard. When I took the cue and made a  move in that direction he winked his eye and significantly tapped  upon the barrel of his gun. The train was loaded with iron rails and  timbers, and I speculated as to their use, but farther down the line I  saw hundreds of men unloading these, making a great noise as  they flung them down the river bank to the water's edge. They  were destined for a big pontoon bridge which these men were, with  thousands of soldiers, throwing across the stream. Ceaselessly  the din and clangor of hammerings rang out over the river. My way  now wound through what was, to all purposes, one German camp,  strung for miles along the Meuse. The soldiers were busy with  domestic duties. Everywhere there was the cheer and rhythm of  well-ordered industry in the open air. In one place thousands of  loaves of black bread were being shifted from wagon to wagon. In  another they were piling a yard high with mountains of grain. The  air was full of the drone of a great mill, humming away at full  speed, while the Belgian fields were yielding up their golden  harvests to the invaders. Apples in great clusters hung down  around the necks of horses tethered in the orchards. With their  keepers they were enjoying a respite"]]]
