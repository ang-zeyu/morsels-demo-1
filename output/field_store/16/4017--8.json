Then, O bull of the Bharata race, king Jarasandha, hearing that  both Hansa and Dimvaka had been killed, returned to his kingdom with an  empty heart. After Jarasandha had returned, O slayer of all foes, we  were filled with pleasure and continued to live at Mathura. Then the  widow of Hansa and the daughter of Jarasandha, that handsome woman with  eyes like lotus-petals, grieved at the death of her lord, went unto her  father, and repeatedly urged, O Monarch, the king of Magadha,  saying,--O slayer of all foes, kill thou the slayer of my  husband.--Then, O great king, remembering the conclusion to which we  had come of old we became exceedingly cheerless and fled from Mathura.  Dividing our large wealth into small portions so as to make each  portion easily portable, we fled from fear of Jarasandha, with our  cousins and relatives. Reflecting upon everything, we fled towards the  west. There is a delightful town towards the west called Kusasthali,  adorned by the mountains of Raivata. In that city, O monarch, we took  up our abode. We rebuilt its fort and made it so strong that it has  become impregnable even to the Gods. And from within it even the women  might fight the foe, what to speak of the Yadava heroes without fear of  any kind? O slayer of all foes, we are now living in that city. And, O  tiger of the Kuru race, considering the inaccessibility of that first  of mountains and regarding themselves as having already crossed the  fear of Jarasandha, the descendants of Madhu have become exceedingly  glad. Thus, O king, though possessed of strength and energy, yet from  the oppressions of Jarasandha we have been obliged to repair to the  mountains of Gomanta, measuring three Yojanas in length. Within each  yojana have been established one and twenty posts of armed men. And at  intervals of each yojana are hundred gates with arches which are  defended by valourous heroes engaged in guarding them. And innumerable  Kshatriyas invincible in war, belonging to the eighteen younger  branches of the Yadavas, are employed in defending these works. In our  race, O king, there are full eighteen thousand brothers and cousins.  Ahuka hath had a hundred sons, each of whom is almost like a god (in  prowess), Charudeshna with his brother Chakradeva, Satyaki, myself,  Valadeva the son of Rohini, and my son Samva who is equal unto me in  battle--these seven, O king are Atirathas. Besides these, there are  others, O king, whom I shall presently name. They are Kritavarman,  Anadhrishti, Samika, Samitinjaya, Kanka, Sanku and Kunti. These seven  are Maharathas. There are also two sons of Andhakabhoja, and the old  king himself. Endued with great energy these are all heroes, each  mighty as the thunderbolt. These Maharathas, choosing the middle  country, are now living amongst the Vrishnis. O thou best of the  Bharata line, thou alone art worthy of being an emperor. It behoveth  thee, O Bharata, to establish thy empire over all the Kshatriyas. But  this is my judgment, O king, that thou wilt not be able to celebrate  the Rajasuya sacrifice as long as the mighty Jarasandha liveth. By him  have been immured in his hillfort numerous monarchs, like a lion that  hath deposited the slain bodies of mighty elephants within a cave of  the king of mountains. O slayer of all enemies, king Jarasandha,  desirous of offering in sacrifice hundred monarchs, adored for his  fierce ascetic penances the illustrious god of gods, the lord of Uma.  It is by this means that the kings of the earth have been vanquished by  Jarasandha. And, O best of monarchs, he hath by that means been able to  fulfil the vow he had made relative to his sacrifice. By defeating the  kings with their troops and bringing all of them as captives into this  city, he had swelled its crowds enormously. We also, O king, from fear  of Jarasandha, at one time had to leave Mathura and fly to the city of  Dwaravati. If, O great king, thou desirest to perform this sacrifice,  strive to release the kings confined by Jarasandha, as also to compass  his death, O son of the Kuru race, otherwise this undertaking of thine  can never be completed. O thou foremost of intelligent men if the  Rajasuya is to be performed by thee, you must do this in this way and  not otherwise. This, O king, is my view (on the matter). Do, O sinless  one, as thou thinkest. Under these circumstances, O king, having  reflected upon everything, taking note of causes, tell us what thou  thyself thinkest proper.\"      SECTION XV    \"Yudhishthira said,--'Intelligent as thou art, thou hast said what none  else is capable of saying. There is none else on earth who is settler  of all doubts. Behold, there are kings in every province employed in  benefiting their respective selves. But no one amongst them hath been  able to achieve the imperial dignity. Indeed, the title emperor is  difficult of acquisition. He that knoweth the valour and strength of  others never applaudeth himself. He, indeed, is really worthy of  applause (worship) who, engaged in encounters with his enemies, beareth  himself commendably. O thou supporter of the dignity of the Vrishni  race, man's desires and propensities, like the wide earth itself  adorned with many jewels, are varied and extensive. As experience can  seldom be gained but by travelling in regions remote from one's home,  so salvation can never be attained except by acting according to  principles that are very high, compared with the ordinary level of our  desire and propensities. I regard peace of mind as the highest object  here, for from that quality may proceed my prosperity. In my judgment,  if I undertake to celebrate this sacrifice, I shall never win the  highest reward. O Janardana, endued with energy and intelligence, these  that have been born in our race think that some one amongst them will  at one time become the foremost amongst all Kshatriyas. But, O exalted  one, we also were all frightened by the fear of Jarasandha and, O  sinless one, by the wickedness of that monarch. O thou invincible in  battle, the might of thy arm is my refuge. When, therefore, thou taken  fright at Jarasandha's might, how should I regard myself strong in  comparison with him? Madhava, O thou of the Vrishni race, I am  repeatedly depressed by the thought whether Jarasandha is capable or  not of being slain by thee, by Rama, by Bhimasena, or by Arjuna. But  what shall I say, O Keshava? Thou art my highest authority on  everything.'    \"On hearing these words, Bhima well-skilled in speech said,--'That king  who is without exertion, or who being weak and without resources  entereth into hostility with one that is strong, perisheth like an  ant-hill. It may be generally seen, however, that even a king that is  weak may vanquish an enemy that is strong and obtain the fruition of  all his wishes, by wakefulness and by the application of policy. In  Krishna is policy, in myself strength, in Arjuna triumphs. So like the  three (sacrificial) fires that accomplish a sacrifice, we shall  accomplish the death of the king of Magadha.'    \"Krishna then said,--'One that is immature in understanding seeketh the  fruition of his desire without an eye to what may happen to him in  future. It is seen that no one forgiveth for that reason a foe that is  of immature understanding and inclined to serve his own interests. It  hath been heard by us that in the krita age, having brought every one  under their subjection, Yauvanaswin by the abolition of all taxes,  Bhagiratha by his kind treatment to his subjects, Kartavirya by the  energy of his asceticism, the lord Bharata by his strength and valour,  and Maruta by his prosperity, all these five became emperors. But, O  Yudhishthira, thou who covetest the imperial dignity deserves it, not  by one but by all these qualities, viz., victory, protection afforded  to thy people, virtue, prosperity, and policy. Know, O bull of the Kuru  race, that Jarasandha, the son of Vrihadratha, is even such (i.e., a  candidate for the imperial dignity). A hundred dynasties of kings have  become unable to oppose Jarasandha. He, therefore, may be regarded to  be an emperor for his strength. Kings that are wearers of jewels  worship Jarasandha (with presents of jewels). But, wicked from his  childhood, he is scarcely satisfied with such worship. Having become  the foremost among all, he attacketh yet with violence kings with  crowns on their heads. Nor is there seen any king from whom he taketh  not tribute. Thus hath he brought under his sway nearly a hundred  kings. How can, O son of Pritha, any weak monarch approach him with  hostile intentions? Confined in the temple of Shiva and offered as  sacrifice unto him like so many animals, do not these monarchs  dedicated unto that god feel the most poignant misery, O bull of the  Bharata race? A Kshatriya that dieth in battle is ever regarded with  respect. Why shall we not, therefore, meet together and oppose  Jarsandha in battle? He hath already brought eighty-six kings; fourteen  only are wanting to complete one hundred. As soon as he obtaineth those  fourteen, he will begin his cruel act. He that shall be to obstruct  that act will surely win blazing renown. And he that will vanquish  Jarasandha will surely become the emperor of all the Kshatriyas.'      SECTION XVI    \"Yudhishthira said,--'Desirous of the imperial dignity but acting from  selfish motives and relying upon courage alone, how, O Krishna, can I  despatch ye (unto Jarasandha)? Both Bhima and Arjuna, I regard as my  eyes, and thee, O Janardana as my mind. How shall I live, deprived of  my eyes and mind. Yama himself cannot vanquish in battle the mighty  host of Jarasandha that is endued, besides, with terrible valour. What  valour can ye exhibit against it. This affair that promises to  terminate otherwise may lead to great mischief. It is my opinion, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7978"],[0,"Legends, Traditions, and Laws of the Iroquois, or Six Nations, and History of (#11)"],[1,"had two  gates, one way to get their water, the other for a sally port.    They were also molested by a terrific animal which they called Ro-qua-ho  --a variegated lizzard--a swift runner and strikes very violent blows with  its tail, which destroyed many hunters while lying in lurk for them. One  day while a party of hunters were on their journey to camp-out for the  purpose of hunting, the party consisting of four, they came to a very  large hollow tree where they noticed quite a number of great marks of  claws on the bark of the tree. Supposing it to be the lodge of bears,  they laid their bundles down and made ready for their game. One of them  bounded on the tree and climbed it, and he struck the trunk of the tree  several times. When the supposed bear appeared, to their consternation it  was found to be the enemy they so much dreaded, the Ro-qua-ho. The person  on the tree only stepped behind it and the other three ran away for their  lives. The Ro-qua-ho came down and pursued them, and while yet in sight  one was caught, killed and brought back, and he carried the body into the  tree. Then he went after the second which was brought in a short time,  after which, he went for the third; then the one on the tree came down  and ran away also. While on his way he heard a voice calling him; he  stopped, and behold, a man of stately form, with long flowing hair stood  and said, \"Why run? I have seen the distress of my people, I have come to  deliver them out of trouble; now confide in me and we will prevail. I am  your benefactor, Tarenyawagon. Get behind me, the enemy is approaching.\"    In the twinkling of an eye this Celestial being was changed, and assumed  himself into a great white bear. When the Roquaho came a great struggle  ensued, but with the help of the man the enemy was killed.    They were again molested by an extraordinary and ferocious animal in  various places--a mammoth bear. One morning while a party of hunters were  in their camp, they were alarmed by a great tumult breaking out from the  forest. Upon going to ascertain the cause of this extraordinary noise,  they saw the great monster on the bank pawing and rolling stones and logs  in every direction, exhibiting the utmost rage. Another great animal of  the cat kind appeared, and seized the bear and a dreadful fight ensued.  In the end the bear got the worst of it and retired horribly mangled, and  never was heard of afterwards.    After a while a pestiferous and annoying creature of the insect kind  appeared in the guise of the Ro-tay-yo (a huge mosquito). It first  appeared among the Tuscaroras along the Neuse river. It flew about with  vast wings, making a loud noise, with a long stinger; and on whomsoever  it lighted it sucked out all the blood and killed them. Many warriors  were destroyed in this way, and all attempts made to subdue it were vain;  but at length it retired of itself. Next they heard that it appeared  about the fort at Onondaga, where it also destroyed many lives, until  Tarenyawagon made a visit to the ruler of the Onondagas. The great  mosquito happened to come flying about the fort as usual at that time.  Tarenyawago immediately made his attack, but such was the rapidity of its  flight, that he could scarcely keep in sight of it. He chased it around  the borders of the great lakes, towards the sun-setting, and around the  great country at large, east and west. At last he overtook it, and took  his strong bow and sent an arrow which struck him through the heart and  killed him, near Gen-an-do-a (the salt lake of Onondaga). From the blood  flowing out on this occasion were the present species of small mosquito  originated.    I have now related a few of the tragedies of the dark recesses of the  forest, from the many that our tradition relates.    There was also a little old man of singular appearance that frequented  among them at their ball plays, and did not seem to be inclined to make  acquaintance with any one, but kept by himself and appeared to be mild  and humble. At length this man became very sick with putrefying sores  from head to foot and was very loathesome. Nobody knew who he was or  where he came from: he had no home; he gave his name as Qua-ra, or  Rabbit: he went from house to house of all the different clans or tribes  in the nation, as for instance, the Eel, Snipe, Beaver, Turtle, Wolf,  Deer. When he would approach the house, seemingly to go in, they would  loathe him to enter, and when he came to the doorstep he would seem to  hear their thoughts and then return; thus he was repulsed from all the  houses of the above clans, he finally came to the house of the Bear clan.  When the mistress of the house observed him coming, she had pity on him,  and presently prepared a bed for him with the best deerskins she had;  when he came to the door he knew her hospitable heart and went in. She  immediately assured him of his welcome in her meanly hut, and that she  was ready to do everything in her power to relieve his distress, and  appointed his lodge where he had laid himself nearly exhausted. He then  told her to go and get the root of a certain kind of plant, which she  immediately did and prepared according to his direction, which he took  and readily recovered. He then went through a series of diseases,  directing her as before to get the different kind of medicines for the  different diseases. Lastly, he became sick with that fatal disease,  consumption. This he said was incurable, and he must die. He then told  her he was a messenger from Tarenyawagon, to show them the diseases that  they should be subjected to, and also the medicine to cure them. And also  to tell them the predictions of their fate and doom. Said he could not  withhold the water from his eyes, or keep from quaking when he thought of  their irrevocable doom to which they were destined, and said: \"There is a  habitation beyond these great waters towards the sun-rising, which are  inhabited by beings of very pale faces, and are looking only to  themselves, have pity for nobody, and make their delight in doing  mischief. They have killed Rah-wah-ne-yo (God); they mocked him and done  all manner of bad things to him, and finally, they fastened him to a tree  until he died. But death and the grave had not power to hold him. He  arose and lives again, and he has gone to the world above, in those happy  hunting grounds where all good O-qua-ho-wa (Indians), will go when they  die, and will see him as he is.    \"Now this class of pale-faces will come across the great waters and make  their abode on this island, and will bring poison to give you to drink,  which will poison the spirit and kill the body. They will kill your  husbands, brothers and sons, and drive you away to the sun-setting, and  will deprive the children that are coming behind, off their domain. They  will drive you until you are in the great salt water up to your waist.  Oh, hostess, this is the final doom of your great nation.    \"And now as for you, Oh, mother, I have no words that I can utter, to  express the sincere gratitude of my inmost soul. I have nothing to give  to compensate you for all the tenderness you have given me. But my  blessings I will leave with you. I place in the midst of your clan, the  Bear, a majestic pine tree, which is ever green, and as the top reaches  above all other trees, so will your clan be. Wherever the nation will be  driven to, your clan will multiply above all others, and be the ruler of  the nation. This is all I have to deliver unto you. I now commend myself  to that Great Spirit that has made us all, who ruleth above.\"    Thus ended the last messenger of Tarenyawagon, who is now basking in the  pleasures of that hunting ground in the world above.          TUSCARORA.    Before the discovery, by Columbus, the Tuscaroras consisted of six towns,  and they were a powerful nation, numbering over twelve hundred warriors,  which, at a ratio according to the rule of estimating, would bring them  at about five or six thousand souls.    The Tuscaroras had many years of enjoyment and peaceful possession of  their domain, consisting of six towns on the Roanoke, Neuse, Taw and  Pemlico rivers, in the State of North Carolina. And they were also  confederated to six other nations, which were the Corees, Mattamuskeets,  Notaways and the Bear River Indians; the names of the other two nations I  have been unable to obtain. My readers will readily see why some writers  have it that they consisted in twelve towns, and other writers would have  it that they consisted in six towns. The real Tuscaroras consisted in six  towns; but with the confederate nations, altogether, were known to be in  twelve towns, and all these different nations which composed the  confederacy went under the name of Tuscarora, the Tuscaroras being the  most powerful of the several nations.    The tradition of the Tuscaroras admits of having captured Lawson and his  party, and executed some of them to death on account of their  encroachments upon their domain; but concerning the massacre of Oct. 2d,  1711, the Tuscaroras emphatically deny having taken any part in the  affair whatever, officially. The project was presented to them and in the  council of the sachems, chiefs and warriors, they emphatically declined  taking any part in such a movement, but said if the colonists made  encroachments and trespass on their domain, it is no more than right and  just that we defend our rights, and even cautioned their young men that  they should not take any part whatever in the action; but, nevertheless,  there were a few of the rash and reckless warriors that took part in the  disorder.    The Corees, Mattamuskeets, and Bear River Indians seemed to be the  instigators of the project: but there were several other nations that  took part in the massacre. These three nations being considered  Tuscaroras, on account of the confederacy, and the capture of Lawson and  his party a little"]]]
