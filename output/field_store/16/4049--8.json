The fanacticism which prevailed among the earlier Christians was the  direct result of their dense ignorance, and to this sole cause we may  ascribe all the trouble which the Roman Government had with them, and  to become convinced of this fact we have but to study church history.  In reference to this subject Mosheim, in his Ecclesiastical History;  Vol. 4, part 2, chap. 1, says: \"It is certain that the greatest part  both of the bishops and presbyters were men entirely destitute of  learning and education. Besides, that savage and illiterate party, who  looked upon all sorts of erudition, particularly that of a  philosophical kind, as pernicious, and even destructive of true piety  and religion, increased both in number and authority. The ascetics,  monks and hermits augmented the strength of this barbarous faction, and  not only the women, but also all who took solemn looks, sordid  garments, and a love of solitude, for real piety, were vehemently  prepossessed in their favor.\" In almost any history of England we will  find it recorded that, even in the ninth century, King Alfred lamented  that there was at that time not a priest in his dominions who  understood Latin; and even for some centuries after the bishops and  prelates of the whole Christian community were marksmen, i. e., they  supplied by the sign of the cross the inability to write their own  names. If the bishops and priests were so supremely ignorant what can  be said in reference to the literary attainments of the laity?    The Christians were alternately persecuted and tolerated by the Roman  Emperors until the first quarter of the fourth century, when certain  events occurred through which the Church of Rome became the recipient  of Imperial Patronage. Constantine I., called the Great, having made  himself sole Emperor by destroying all other claimants to the throne,  applied to Sopater, one of the priests of the established religion, for  absolution, and was informed that his crimes were of such an atrocious  character that there was no absolution for him. Believing that the  Phlegethon, or lake of fire and brimstone, awaited him in the future  life, unless he could obtain absolution, he became very much distressed  when one of his courtiers, learning the cause and referring him to the  Church of Rome, he at once applied to her Bishop, Silvester, who,  readily granting the desired absolution, he added another victim to his  butcher bill by ordering the death of the honest priest who had refused  to grant him absolution. The Christian sect having become a powerful  and dangerous faction, Constantine conceived the idea of strengthening  his usurped and precarious position by attaching it to his interest,  and to that end he professed himself a convert to its tenets, and,  taking the Church of Rome under his especial patronage, elevated her  Bishop to the rank of a prince of the Empire and gave him one of his  palaces for a residence.    The Christian hierarchy, knowing that it would be a potent means of  confirming the faith of the laity in the Gospel story as a literal  history to have a tomb of the Saviour to which pilgrimages could be  made, and appealing to Constantine to provide one, he sent his mother,  Helena, to Judea to find the place and, of course, discovering what she  went to look for, he had erected, under her supervision, over the  designated spot, that splendid edifice which, known as the church of  the Holy Sepulchre, remains to this day. Helena, good at finding lost  things, also claimed to have discovered the veritable cross upon which  the Saviour had been crucified; and her son, worthy of such a mother,  claimed, as recorded by Eusebius, that he had seen with his own eyes  the trophy of a cross of light in the heavens, above the sun, bearing  the inscription: \"In Hoc Signo Vinces,\" signifying \"Under this sign,  conquer.\" Those were times of remarkable and supernatural occurrences.    At the time Constantine became the patron of Christianity the bishops  and presbyters of the several churches, seemingly ignorant of the  teachings of the Esoteric philosophy relative to the origin of the  Trinity, were divided into two factions in discussing the relation  between the Father and the Son. One party, headed by Athanasius, a  presbyter of Alexandria, and afterwards bishop of that see, advocated  the ancient belief that the three persons in the godhead of Father, Son  and Holy Ghost is but one God, that Christ is consubstantial or  co-eternal with the Father, and that he became man to perform his  mission of redemption. Such, in brief, is what is known as the  Athanasian or Trinitarian Creed. The other party, headed, by Arius,  another presbyter of Alexandria, advocated the belief in one God alone  and that Christ, having no existence until begotten of the Father, is  not consubstantial or co-eternal with him. Such, in substance,  constitutes what is known to the Trinitarian or Orthodox Christians as  the Arian or Unitarian heresy. Could stronger evidence be adduced that  this controversy was the result of ignorantly making a distinction  where there is no difference, for whether Trinitarian or Unitarian the  mythical genius of the sun is the God to whom they all paid supreme  adoration, although the Christians of to-day would deny it most  emphatically.    The faction, advocating the Trinitarian creed having converted the  Emperor to their belief, and influencing him to enforce it as a  fundamental doctrine of the Christian theology, he, in the year 325,  summoned, at his own expense, a general council of bishops and priests  to meet at Nice, in Bithynia, a province of Asia Minor. When they had  assembled he appeared among them, clad in gorgeous attire, with a  jewel-studded diadem upon his royal brow, and, seated upon a gilded  chair, presided over their deliberations. A minority of them, holding  \"most contumaciously\" to the Arian heresy, and refusing to change their  views at the bidding of the Emperor, he banished them from their  respective bishoprics, while the majority adopted the Trinitarian  creed, and appealing to Constantine to suppress the writings of Arius  he issued an edict for that purpose, which we present as follows:  \"Moreover we thought that if there can be found extant any work or book  compiled by Arius the same should be burned to ashes, so that not only  his damnable doctrine may thereby be wholly rooted out, but also that  no relic thereof may remain unto posterity. This we also straightway  command and charge, that if any man be found to hide or conceal any  book made by Arius, and not immediately bring forth such book, and  deliver it up to be burned, that the said offender for so doing shall  die the death. For as soon as he is taken our pleasure is that his head  shall be stricken off from his shoulders.\" Rather a blood-thirsty,  edict to be issued by the \"puissant, the mighty and noble Emperor,\" and  a very inconsistent one, considering that he soon afterwards readopted  the Unitarian faith and restored the banished bishops to their  respective sees; but, regardless of his action, the Church of Rome  sustained the Trinitarian creed and enforced the dogma of the supreme  divinity of Christ.    Thus we see that the history of Christianity, in the first half of the  fourth century, cannot be written without incorporating considerable  from the life of Constantine, whose ensanguined record before his  pretended conversion marks him as the most brutal tyrant that ever  disgraced the imperial purple; but the appalling crimes he perpetrated  afterwards, among which were the scalding his inoffending wife to death  in a bath of boiling water, and the murdering, without cause, of six  members of his family, one of which was his own son, justify what a  learned writer said of him, that \"The most unfortunate event that ever  befell the human race was the adoption of Christianity by the  crimson-handed cut-throat in the possession of unlimited power,\" and  yet Constantine was canonized by the Eastern church.    During the first three centuries, when Christianity was but a weak  sect, her bishops addressed numerous apologies to the Roman Emperors,  in which they claimed tolerance from the government on the ground that  their form of worship was virtually the same as the established  religion. But after Constantine's pretended conversion its hierarchy  began to labor for the recognition of Christianity as the state  religion, and to give to their demand some show of consistency they  insisted that their scriptures were really historical, and that there  was no resemblance whatever between the two forms of worship; while  theirs was of Divine authenticity the Pagans was purely a human  institution.    For centuries after the convocation of the council of Nice the peace  and harmony of the several churches were disturbed by the rancorous  discussion of the same old questions of Trintarianism and Unitarianism,  the Western church adhering to the former while a majority of the  Eastern congregations maintained their faith in the latter; but  ultimately the Trinitarian party, gaining the ascendency, and  persecuting the adherents of the Unitarian faith, the greater part of  them retired into northern Arabia where they founded numerous  monasteries; and from history we learn that, having impressed their  Unitarian faith upon the populace of that country, it was ultimately  incorporated into the Koran, the sacred book of Mohammedanism; and,  while becoming votaries of that form of worship, still retained"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8866"],[0,"Wild Flowers Worth Knowing (#11)"],[1,"t; Round-lobed, or Kidney Liver-leaf;  Noble Liverwort; Squirrel Cup    _Hepatica triloba (H. Hepatica)_    _Flowers_--Blue, lavender, purple, pinkish, or white; occasionally, not  always, fragrant; 6 to 12 petal-like, colored sepals (not petals, as  they appear to be), oval or oblong; numerous stamens, all bearing  anthers; pistils numerous; 3 small, sessile leaves, forming an involucre  directly under flower, simulate a calyx, for which they might be  mistaken. _Stems:_ Spreading from the root, 4 to 6 in. high, a solitary  flower or leaf borne at end of each furry stem. _Leaves:_ 3-lobed and  rounded, leathery, evergreen; sometimes mottled with, or entirely,  reddish purple; spreading on ground, rusty at blooming time, the new  leaves appearing after the flowers. _Fruit:_ Usually as many as pistils,  dry, 1-seeded, oblong, sharply pointed, never opening.    _Preferred Habitat_--Woods; light soil on hillsides.    _Flowering Season_--December-May.    _Distribution_--Canada to northern Florida, Manitoba to Iowa and  Missouri. Most common East.    Even under the snow itself bravely blooms the delicate hepatica, wrapped  in fuzzy furs as if to protect its stems and nodding buds from cold.  After the plebeian Skunk Cabbage, that ought scarcely to be reckoned  among true flowers--and William Hamilton Gibson claimed even before  it--it is the first blossom to appear. Winter sunshine, warming the  hillsides and edges of woods, opens its eyes.      \"Blue as the heaven it gazes at,    Startling the loiterer in the naked groves    With unexpected beauty; for the time    Of blossoms and green leaves is yet afar.\"    \"There are many things left for May,\" says John Burroughs, \"but nothing  fairer, if as fair, as the first flower, the hepatica. I find I have  never admired this little firstling half enough. When at the maturity of  its charms, it is certainly the gem of the woods. What an individuality  it has! No two clusters alike; all shades and sizes.... A solitary  blue-purple one, fully expanded and rising over the brown leaves or the  green moss, its cluster of minute anthers showing like a group of pale  stars on its little firmament, is enough to arrest and hold the dullest  eye. Then, ... there are individual hepaticas, or individual families  among them, that are sweet scented. The gift seems as capricious as the  gift of genius in families. You cannot tell which the fragrant ones are  till you try them. Sometimes it is the large white ones, sometimes the  large purple ones, sometimes the small pink ones. The odor is faint, and  recalls that of the sweet violets. A correspondent, who seems to have  carefully observed these fragrant hepaticas, writes me that this gift of  odor is constant in the same plant; that the plant which bears  sweet-scented flowers this year will bear them next.\"    Pollen-feeding flies and female hive bees frequent these blossoms on the  first warm days. Whether or not they are rewarded by finding nectar is  still a mooted question. They seem to do so.      Wood Anemone; Wind-flower    _Anemone quinquefolia_    _Flowers_--Solitary, about 1 in. broad, white or delicately tinted with  blue or pink outside. Calyx of 4 to 9 oval, petal-like sepals; no  petals; stamens and carpels numerous, of indefinite number. _Stem:_  Slender, 4 to 9 in. high, from horizontal elongated rootstock. _Leaves:_  On slender petioles, in a whorl of 3 to 5 below the flower, each leaf  divided into 3 to 5 variously cut and lobed parts; also a late-appearing  leaf from the base.    _Preferred Habitat_--Woodlands, hillsides, light soil, partial shade.    _Flowering Season_--April-June.    _Distribution_--Canada and United States, south to Georgia, west to  Rocky Mountains.    According to one poetical Greek tradition, Anemos, the wind, employs  these exquisitely delicate little star-like namesakes as heralds of his  coming in early spring, while woods and hillsides still lack foliage to  break his gusts' rude force. Pliny declared that only the wind could  open anemones! Another legend utilized by countless poets pictures Venus  wandering through the forests grief-stricken over the death of her  youthful lover.      \"Alas, the Paphian! fair Adonis slain!    Tears plenteous as his blood she pours amain;    But gentle flowers are born and bloom around    From every drop that falls upon the ground:    Where streams his blood, there blushing springs the rose;    And where a tear has dropped, a wind-flower blows.\"    Indeed, in reading the poets ancient and modern for references to this  favorite blossom, one realizes as never before the significance of an  anthology, literally a flower gathering.    But it is chiefly the European Anemone that is extolled by the poets.  Nevertheless our more slender, fragile, paler-leaved, and  smaller-flowered species, known, strange to say, by the same scientific  name, possesses the greater charm. Doctors, with more prosaic eyes than  the poets, find acrid and dangerous juices in the anemone and its kin.  Certain European peasants will run past a colony of these pure, innocent  blossoms in the belief that the very air is tainted by them. Yet the  Romans ceremonially picked the first anemone of the year, with an  incantation supposed to guard them against fever. The identical plant  that blooms in our woods, which may be found also in Asia, is planted on  graves by the Chinese, who call it the \"death flower.\"    Note the clusters of tuberous, dahlia-like roots, the whorl of thin,  three-lobed rounded leaflets on long, fine petioles immediately below  the smaller pure white or pinkish flowers usually growing in loose  clusters, to distinguish the more common Rue Anemone _(Anemonella  thalictroides_ or _Syndesmon thalictroides_ or _Thalictrum  anemonoides)_ from its cousin the solitary flowered wood or true  anemone. Generally there are three blossoms of the Rue Anemone to a  cluster, the central one opening first, the side ones only after it has  developed its stamens and pistils to prolong the season of bloom and  encourage cross-pollination by insects. In the eastern half of the  United States, and less abundantly in Canada, these are among the most  familiar spring wild flowers. Pick them and they soon wilt miserably;  lift the plants early, with a good ball of soil about the roots, and  they will unfold their fragile blossoms indoors, bringing with them  something of the unspeakable charm of their native woods and hillsides  just waking into life.      Virgin's Bower; Virginia Clematis; Traveller's Joy; Old Man's Beard    _Clematis virginiana_    _Flowers_--White and greenish, about 1 in. across or less, in loose  clusters from the axils. Calyx of 4 or 5 petal-like sepals; no petals;  stamens and pistils numerous, of indefinite number; the staminate and  pistillate flowers on separate plants; the styles feathery, and more  than 1 in. long in fruit. _Stem:_ Climbing, slightly woody. _Leaves:_  Opposite, slender petioled, divided into 3 pointed and 2 widely toothed  or lobed leaflets.    _Preferred Habitat_--Climbing over woodland borders, thickets, roadside  shrubbery, fences, and walls; rich, moist soil.    _Flowering Season_--July-September.    _Distribution_--Georgia and Kansas northward; less common beyond the  Canadian border.    Charles Darwin, who made so many interesting studies of the power of  movement in various plants, devoted special attention to the clematis  clan, of which about one hundred species exist; but, alas! none to our  traveller's joy, that flings out the right hand of good fellowship to  every twig within reach, winds about the sapling in brotherly embrace,  drapes a festoon of flowers from shrub to shrub, hooks even its  sensitive leafstalks over any available support as it clambers and riots  on its lovely way. By rubbing the footstalk of a young leaf with a twig  a few times on any side, Darwin found a clematis leaf would bend to that  side in the course of a few hours, but return to the straight again if  nothing remained on which to hook itself.    In early autumn, when the long, silvery, decorative plumes attached to a  ball of seeds form feathery, hoary masses even more fascinating than the  flower clusters, the name of old man's beard is most suggestive. These  seeds never open, but, when ripe, each is borne on the autumn gales, to  sink into the first moist, springy resting place.      Marsh Marigold; Meadow-gowan; American Cowslip    _Caltha palustris_    _Flowers_--Bright, shining yellow, 1 to 1-1/2 in. across, a few in  terminal and axillary groups. No petals; usually 5 (often more) oval,  petal-like sepals; stamens numerous; many pistils (carpels) without  styles. _Stem:_ Stout, smooth, hollow, branching, 1 to 2 ft. high.  _Leaves:_ Mostly from root, rounded, broad, and heart-shaped at base, or  kidney-shaped, upper ones almost sessile, lower ones on fleshy petioles.    _Preferred Habitat_--Springy ground, low meadows, swamps, river  banks, ditches.    _Flowering Season_--April-June.    _Distribution_--Carolina to Iowa, the Rocky Mountains, and very  far north.    Not a true marigold, and even less a cowslip, it is by these names  that this flower, which looks most like a buttercup, will continue to  be called, in spite of the protests of scientific classifiers.  Doubtless the first of these folk-names refers to its use in church  festivals during the Middle Ages as one of the blossoms devoted to the  Virgin Mary.      \"And winking Mary-buds begin    To ope their golden eyes,\"    sing the musicians in \"Cymbeline.\" Whoever has seen the watery Avon  meadows in April, yellow and twinkling with marsh marigolds when \"the  lark at heaven's gate sings,\" appreciates why the commentators incline  to identify Shakespeare's Mary-buds with the _Caltha_ of these and our  own marshes.    But we know well that not for poets' high-flown rhapsodies but rather  for the more welcome hum of bees and flies intent on breakfasting, do  these flowers open in the"]]]
