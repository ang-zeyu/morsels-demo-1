These were set in pots and on shelves near the latticed  windows. They seemed to grow finely, because so good a woman loved  them. The copper door-sill was kept bright, and the broad borders on  the clay floor, along the walls, were always fresh with whitewash. The  pewter dishes on the sideboard shone as if they were moons, and the  china cats on the mantle piece, in silvery luster, reflected both sun  and candle light. Daddy often declared he could use these polished  metal plates for a mirror, when he shaved his face. Puss, the pet, was  always happy purring away on the hearth, as the kettle boiled to make  the flummery, of sour oat jelly, which, daddy loved so well.    Mother Gruffyd was always so neat, with her black and white striped  apron, her high peaked hat, with its scalloped lace and quilled  fastening around her chin, her little short shawl, with its pointed,  long tips, tied in a bow, and her bright red plaid petticoat folded  back from her frock. Her snowy-white, rolling collar and neck cloth  knotted at the top, and fringed at the ends, added fine touches to her  picturesque costume.    In fact, young Gruffyd was proud of his mother and he loved her  dearly. He thought no woman could be quite as sweet as she was.    Once, at the end of the day, on coming back home, from the hills, the  boy met some lovely children. They were dressed in very fine clothes,  and had elegant manners. They came up, smiled, and invited him to play  with them. He joined in their sports, and was too much interested to  take note of time. He kept on playing with them until it was pitch  dark.    Among other games, which he enjoyed, had been that of \"The King in his  counting house, counting out his money,\" and \"The Queen in her  kitchen, eating bread and honey,\" and \"The Girl hanging out the  clothes,\" and \"The Saucy Blackbird that snipped off her nose.\" In  playing these, the children had aprons full of what seemed to be real  coins, the size of crowns, or five-shilling pieces, each worth a  dollar. These had \"head and tail,\" beside letters on them and the boy  supposed they were real.    But when he showed these to his mother, she saw at once from their  lightness, and because they were so easily bent, that they were only  paper, and not silver.    She asked her boy where he had got them. He told her what a nice time  he had enjoyed. Then she knew that these, his playmates, were fairy  children. Fearing that some evil might come of this, she charged him,  her only son, never to go out again alone, on the mountain. She  mistrusted that no good would come of making such strange children his  companions.    But the lad was so fond of play, that one day, tired of seeing nothing  but byre and garden, while his sisters liked to play girls' games more  than those which boys cared most for, and the hills seeming to beckon  him to come to them, he disobeyed, and slipped out and off to the  mountains. He was soon missed and search was made for him.    Yet nobody had seen or heard of him. Though inquiries were made on  every road, in every village, and at all the fairs and markets in the  neighborhood, two whole years passed by, without a trace of the boy.    But early one morning of the twenty-fifth month, before breakfast, his  mother, on opening the door, found him sitting on the steps, with a  bundle under his arm, but dressed in the same clothes, and not looking  a day older or in any way different, from the very hour he  disappeared.    \"Why my dear boy, where have you been, all these months, which have  now run into the third year--so long a time that they have seemed to  me like ages?\"    \"Why, mother dear, how strange you talk. I left here yesterday, to go  out and to play with the children, on the hills, and we have had a  lovely time. See what pretty clothes they have given me for a  present.\" Then he opened his bundle.    But when she tore open the package, the mother was all the more sure  that she was right, and that her fears had been justified. In it she  found only a dress of white paper. Examining it carefully, she could  see neither seam nor stitches. She threw it in the fire, and again  warned her son against fairy children.    But pretty soon, after a great calamity had come upon them, both  father and mother changed their minds about fairies.    They had put all their savings into the venture of a ship, which had  for a long time made trading voyages from Cardiff. Every year, it came  back bringing great profit to the owners and shareholders. In this  way, daddy was able to eke out his income, and keep himself, his wife  and daughters comfortably clothed, while all the time the table was  well supplied with good food. Nor did they ever turn from their door  anyone who asked for bread and cheese.    But in the same month of the boy's return, bad news came that the good  ship had gone down in a storm. All on board had perished, and the  cargo was totally lost, in the deep sea, far from land. In fact, no  word except that of dire disaster had come to hand.    Now it was a tradition, as old as the days of King Arthur, that on a  certain hill a great boulder could be seen, which was quite different  from any other kind of rock to be found within miles. It was partly  imbedded in the earth, and beneath it, lay a great, yes, an untold  treasure. The grass grew luxuriantly around this stone, and the sheep  loved to rest at noon in its shadow. Many men had tried to lift, or  pry it up, but in vain. The tradition, unaltered and unbroken for  centuries, was to the effect, that none but a very good man could ever  budge this stone. Any and all unworthy men might dig, or pull, or pry,  until doomsday, but in vain. Till the right one came, the treasure was  as safe as if in heaven.    But the boy's father and mother were now very poor and his sisters now  grown up wanted pretty clothes so badly, that the lad hoped that he or  his father might be the deserving one. He would help him to win the  treasure for he felt sure that his parent would share his gains with  all his friends.    Though his neighbors were not told of the generous intentions credited  to the boy's father, by his loving son, they all came with horses,  ropes, crowbars, and tackle, to help in the enterprise. Yet after many  a long days' toil, between the sun's rising and setting, their end was  failure. Every day, when darkness came on, the stone lay there still,  as hard and fast as ever. So they gave up the task.    On the final night, the lad saw that father and mother, who were great  lovers, were holding each other's hands, while their tears flowed  together, and they were praying for patience.    Seeing this, before he fell asleep, the boy resolved that on the  morrow, he would go up to the mountains, and talk to his fairy friends  about the matter.    So early in the morning, he hurried to the hill tops, and going into  one of the caves, met the fairies and told them his troubles. Then he  asked them to give him again some of their money.    \"Not this time, but something better. Under the great rock there are  treasures waiting for you.\"    \"Oh, don't send me there! For all the men and horses of our parish,  after working a week, have been unable to budge the stone.\"    \"We know that,\" answered the principal fairy, \"but do you yourself try  to move it. Then you will see what is certain to happen.\"    Going home, to tell what he had heard, his parents had a hearty laugh  at the idea of a boy succeeding where men, with the united strength of  many horses and oxen, had failed.    Yet, after brooding awhile, they were so dejected, that anything  seemed reasonable. So they said, \"Go ahead and try it.\"    Returning to the mountain, the fairies, in a band, went with him to  the great rock.    One touch of his hand, and the mighty boulder trembled, like an aspen  leaf in the breeze.    A shove, and the rock rolled down from the hill and crashed in the  valley below.    There, underneath, were little heaps of gold and silver, which the boy  carried home to his parents, who became the richest people in the  country round about.          XII      GIANT TOM AND GIANT BLUBB      Everyone who has read anything of Welsh history--though not of the  sort that is written by English folks--knows also that Cornwall is, in  soul, a part of Wales. Before the Romans, first, and the Saxons, next,  invaded Britain, the Cymric people lived all over the island, south of  Scotland.    They were the British people, and nobody ever heard the German name,  \"Wales,\" which means a foreign land; or the word \"Welsh,\" which refers  to foreigners, until men who were themselves outsiders came into  Britain.    Since that time, it has been much the same, as when a British Jack  Tar, when rambling in Portugal, or China, calls the natives  \"foreigners,\" and tells them to \"get out of the way.\"    Ages ago, when the Cymric men, with their wives and little ones rowed  over in their coracles, from Gallia, or the Summer Land, to Britain,  the Honey Land, they came first to the promontory which we know as  Cornwall; that is, the Cornu Galliae, or Walliae, which means Horn or  Cape of the new country now called England. Here was a new region,  rich in every kind of minerals. Ages before, the Phoenicians had named  it Britain or the Land of Tin. Within the memory of men now living,  Cornishmen, that is, the miners of Cornwall, on going to California,  discovered gold.    In Cornwall, as part of the Cymric realm, King Arthur found and  married Guinevere, his queen. It was in Cornwall, also, that Merlin  was hidden. Hear the rhyme:      Marvelous Merlin is wasted away    By a wicked woman, who may she be?    For she hath pent him in a crag      On Cornwall coast.    So it happens that thousands of \"English\" people in Cornwall are  Welsh, by both name or descent, or have translated their names into  English form,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9380"],[0,"A Nonsense Anthology (#11)"],[1,"a handle,--        These were all his worldly goods:        In the middle of the woods,        These were all the worldly goods      Of the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo,      Of the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo.      II      Once, among the Bong-trees walking      Where the early pumpkins blow,        To a little heap of stones      Came the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo.    There he heard a Lady talking,    To some milk-white Hens of Dorking,--          \"'Tis the Lady Jingly Jones!          On that little heap of stones          Sits the Lady Jingly Jones!\"        Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo,        Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo.        III      \"Lady Jingly! Lady Jingly!        Sitting where the pumpkins blow,          Will you come and be my wife?\"        Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo,    \"I am tired of living singly,--    On this coast so wild and shingly,--          I'm a-weary of my life;          If you'll come and be my wife,          Quite serene would be my life!\"        Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo,        Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo.        IV      \"On this Coast of Coromandel        Shrimps and watercresses grow,          Prawns are plentiful and cheap,\"        Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo.    \"You shall have my chairs and candle,    And my jug without a handle!          Gaze upon the rolling deep          (Fish is plentiful and cheap):          As the sea, my love is deep!\"        Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo,        Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo.      Lady Jingly answered sadly,        And her tears began to flow,--          \"Your proposal comes too late,        Mr. Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo!    I would be your wife most gladly!\"    (Here she twirled her fingers madly,)          \"But in England I've a mate!          Yes! you've asked me far too late,          For in England I've a mate,        Mr. Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo!        Mr. Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo!\"        VI      Mr. Jones (his name is Handel,--        Handel Jones, Esquire & Co.)          Dorking fowls delights to send,        Mr. Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo!    Keep, oh, keep your chairs and candle,    And your jug without a handle,--          I can merely be your friend!          Should my Jones more Dorkings send,          I will give you three, my friend!        Mr. Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo!        Mr. Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo!        VII      \"Though you've such a tiny body,        And your head so large doth grow,--          Though your hat may blow away,        Mr. Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo!    Though you're such a Hoddy Doddy,    Yet I wish that I could modi-          fy the words I needs must say!          Will you please to go away?          That is all I have to say,        Mr. Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo!        Mr. Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo!\"        VIII      Down the slippery slopes of Myrtle,        Where the early pumpkins blow,          To the calm and silent sea        Fled the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo.    There, beyond the Bay of Gurtle,    Lay a large and lively Turtle.          \"You're the Cove,\" he said, \"for me:          On your back beyond the sea,          Turtle, you shall carry me!\"        Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo,        Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo.      IX      Through the silent roaring ocean        Did the Turtle swiftly go;          Holding fast upon his shell        Rode the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo.    With a sad primaeval motion    Toward the sunset isles of Boshen          Still the Turtle bore him well,          Holding fast upon his shell.          \"Lady Jingly Jones, farewell!\"        Sang the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo,        Sang the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo.      X      From the Coast of Coromandel        Did that Lady never go,          On that heap of stones she mourns        For the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo.    On that Coast of Coromandel,    In his jug without a handle          Still she weeps, and daily moans;          On the little heap of stones          To her Dorking Hens she moans,        For the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo,        For the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo.                              _Edward Lear_.          _THE POBBLE WHO HAS NO TOES_      The Pobble who has no toes        Had once as many as we;    When they said, \"Some day you may lose them all,\"        He replied, \"Fish fiddle de-dee!\"    And his Aunt Jobiska made him drink    Lavender water tinged with pink;    For she said, \"The World in general knows    There's nothing so good for a Pobble's toes!\"      The Pobble who has no toes        Swam across the Bristol Channel;    But before he set out he wrapped his nose        In a piece of scarlet flannel.    For his Aunt Jobiska said, \"No harm    Can come to his toes if his nose is warm;    And it's perfectly known that a Pobble's toes    Are safe--provided he minds his nose.\"      The Pobble swam fast and well,        And when boats or ships came near him,    He tinkledy-binkledy-winkled a bell        So that all the world could hear him.    And all the Sailors and Admirals cried,    When they saw him nearing the farther side,    \"He has gone to fish for his Aunt Jobiska's    Runcible Cat with crimson whiskers!\"      But before he touched the shore--        The shore of the Bristol Channel,    A sea-green Porpoise carried away        His wrapper of scarlet flannel.    And when he came to observe his feet,    Formerly garnished with toes so neat,    His face at once became forlorn    On perceiving that all his toes were gone!      And nobody ever knew,        From that dark day to the present,    Whoso had taken the Pobble's toes,        In a manner so far from pleasant.    Whether the shrimps or crawfish gray,    Or crafty mermaids stole them away,    Nobody knew; and nobody knows    How the Pobble was robbed of his twice five toes!      The Pobble who has no toes        Was placed in a friendly Bark,    And they rowed him back and carried him up        To his Aunt Jobiska's Park.    And she made him a feast at his earnest wish,    Of eggs and buttercups fried with fish;    And she said, \"It's a fact the whole world knows,    That Pobbles are happier without their toes.\"                              _Edward Lear_.          THE JUMBLIES      I      They went to sea in a sieve, they did;        In a sieve they went to sea:    In spite of all their friends could say,    On a winter's morn, on a stormy day,       In a sieve they went to sea.    And when the sieve turned round and round,    And every one cried, \"You'll all be drowned!\"    They called aloud, \"Our sieve ain't big;    But we don't care a button, we don't care a fig:        In a sieve we'll go to sea!\"          Far and few, far and few,            Are the lands where the Jumblies live;          Their heads are green and their hands are blue;            And they went to sea in a sieve.      II      They sailed away in a sieve, they did,        In a sieve they sailed so fast,    With only a beautiful pea-green veil    Tied with a ribbon by way of a sail,        To a small tobacco-pipe mast.    And every one said who saw them go,    \"Oh! won't they soon be upset, you know?    For the sky is dark and the voyage is long,    And, happen what may, it's extremely wrong        In a sieve to sail so fast.\"          Far and few, far and few,            Are the lands where the Jumblies live;          Their heads are green and their hands are blue;            And they went to sea in a sieve.      III      The water it soon came in, it did;        The water it soon came in:    So, to keep them dry, they wrapped their feet    In a pinky paper all folded neat;        And they fastened it down with a pin.    And they passed the night in a crockery-jar;    And each of them said, \"How wise we are!    Though the sky be dark, and the voyage be long,    Yet we never can think we were rash or wrong,        While round in our sieve we spin.\"          Far and few, far and few,            Are the lands where the Jumblies live;          Their heads are green and their hands are blue;            And they went to sea in a sieve.      IV      And all night long they sailed away;        And when the sun went down,    They whistled and warbled a moony song    To the echoing sound of a coppery gong,        In the shade of the mountains brown.    \"O Timballoo! How happy we are    When we live in a sieve and a crockery-jar!    And all night long, in the moonlight pale,    We sail away with a pea-green sail        In the shade of the mountains brown.\"          Far and few, far and few,            Are the lands where the Jumblies live;          Their heads are green, and their hands are blue;            And they went to sea in a sieve.      V    They sailed to the Western Sea, they did,--        To a land all covered with trees;    And they bought an owl and a useful cart,    And a pound of rice, and a cranberry-tart,        And a hive of silvery bees;    And they bought a pig, and some green jackdaws,    And a lovely monkey with lollipop paws,    And forty bottles of ring-bo-ree,        And no end of Stilton cheese.          Far and few, far and few,            Are the lands where the Jumblies live;          Their heads are green, and their hands are blue;            And they went to sea in a sieve.      VI      And in twenty years they all came back,--        In twenty years or more;    And every one said, \"How tall they've grown!    For they've been to the Lakes, and the Torrible Zone,        And the hills of the Chankly Bore.\"    And they drank their health, and gave them a feast    Of dumplings made of beautiful yeast;    And every one said, \"If we only live,    We, too, will go to sea in a sieve,        To the hills of the Chankly Bore.\"          Far and few, far and few,            Are the lands where the Jumblies live;          Their heads are green, and their hands are blue;            And they went to sea in a sieve.                              _Edward Lear_.
