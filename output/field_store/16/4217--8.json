In both specimens  in my possession the scales of the back were a cream-coloured white,  with a tinge of red in that which came from Chilaw, probably acquired by  the insinuation of the Cabook dust which abounds along the western coast  of the island.    [Illustration: THE PENGOLIN.]    [Illustration: SKELETON OF PENGOLIN.]    Of the habits of the pengolin I found that very little was known by the  natives, who regard it with aversion, one name given to it being the  \"Negombo Devil.\" Those kept by me were, generally speaking, quiet during  the day, and grew restless and active as evening and night approached.  Both had been taken near rocks, in the hollows of which they had their  dwelling, but owing to their slow power of motion, they were unable to  reach their hiding place when overtaken. When frightened, they rolled  themselves instantly into a rounded ball; and such was the powerful  force of muscle, that the strength of a man was insufficient to uncoil  it. In reconnoitring they made important use of the tail, resting upon  it and their hind legs, and holding themselves nearly erect, to command  a view of their object. The strength of this powerful limb will be  perceived from the accompanying drawing of the skeleton of the Manis; in  which it will be seen that the tail is equal in length to all the rest  of the body, whilst the vertebrae which compose it are stronger by far  than those of the back.    From the size and position of the bones of the leg, the pengolin is  endued with prodigious power; and its faculty of exerting this  vertically, was displayed in overturning heavy cases, by insinuating  itself under them, between the supports, by which it is customary in  Ceylon to raise trunks a few inches above the floor, in order to prevent  the attacks of white ants.    VI. RUMINANTIA. _The Gaur_.--Besides the deer, and some varieties of the  humped ox, that have been introduced from the opposite continent of  India, Ceylon has probably but one other indigenous bovine _ruminant_,  the buffalo.[1] There is a tradition that the gaur, found in the  extremity of the Indian peninsula, was at one period a native of the  Kandyan Mountains; but as Knox speaks of one which in his time \"was kept  among the king's creatures\" at Kandy[2], and his account of it tallies  with that of the _Bos Gaurus_ of Hindustan, it would appear even then to  have been a rarity. A place between Neuera-ellia and Adam's Peak bears  the name of \"Gowra-ellia,\" and it is not impossible that the animal may  yet be discovered in some of the imperfectly explored regions of the  island.[3] I have heard of an instance in which a very old Kandyan,  residing in the mountains near the Horton Plains, asserted that when  young he had seen what he believed to have been a gaur, and he described  it as between an elk and a buffalo in size, dark brown in colour, and  very scantily provided with hair.    [Footnote 1: Bubalus buffelus, _Gray_.]    [Footnote 2: KNOX, _Historical Relation of Ceylon, &c._, A.D. 1681. Book  i. c. 6.]    [Footnote 3: KELAART, _Fauna Zeylan_., p. 87.]    _Oxen_.--Oxen are used by the peasantry both in ploughing and in  tempering the mud in the wet paddi fields before sowing the rice; and  when the harvest is reaped they \"tread out the corn,\" after the  immemorial custom of the East. The wealth of the native chiefs and  landed proprietors frequently consists in their herds of bullocks, which  they hire out to their dependents during the seasons for agricultural  labour; and as they already supply them with land to be tilled, and lend  the seed which is to crop it, the further contribution of this portion  of the labour serves to render the dependence of the peasantry on the  chiefs and headmen complete.    The cows are often worked as well as the oxen; and as the calves are  always permitted to suck them, milk is an article which the traveller  can rarely hope to procure in a Kandyan village. From their constant  exposure at all seasons, the cattle in Ceylon, both those employed in  agriculture and those on the roads, are subject to devastating murrains,  that sweep them away by thousands. So frequent is the recurrence of  these calamities, and so extended their ravages, that they exercise a  serious influence upon the commercial interests of the colony, by  reducing the facilities of agriculture, and augmenting the cost of  carriage during the most critical periods of the coffee harvest.    A similar disorder, probably peripneumonia, frequently carries off the  cattle in Assam and other hill countries on the continent of India; and  there, as in Ceylon, the inflammatory symptoms in the lungs and throat,  and the internal derangement and external eruptive appearances, seem to  indicate that the disease is a feverish influenza, attributable to  neglect and exposure in a moist and variable climate; and that its  prevention might be hoped for, and the cattle preserved, by the simple  expedient of more humane and considerate treatment, especially by  affording them cover at night.    During my residence in Ceylon an incident occurred at Neuera-ellia,  which invested one of these pretty animals with an heroic interest. A  little cow, belonging to an English gentleman, was housed, together with  her calf, near the dwelling of her owner, and being aroused during the  night by her furious bellowing, the servants, on hastening to the stall,  found her goring a leopard, which had stolen in to attack the calf. She  had got it into a corner, and whilst lowing incessantly to call for  help, she continued to pound it with her horns. The wild animal,  apparently stupified by her unexpected violence, was detained by her  till despatched by a bullet.    The number of bullock-carts encountered between Colombo and Kandy, laden  with coffee from the interior, or carrying up rice and stores for the  supply of the plantations in the hill-country, is quite surprising. The  oxen thus employed on this single road, about seventy miles long, are  estimated at upwards of twenty thousand. The bandy to which they are  yoked is a barbarous two-wheeled waggon, with a covering of plaited  coco-nut leaves, in which a pair of strong bullocks will draw from five  to ten hundred weight, according to the nature of the country; and with  this load on a level they will perform a journey of twenty miles a day.    A few of the large humped cattle of India are annually imported for  draught; but the vast majority of those in use are small and  dark-coloured, with a graceful head and neck, and elevated hump, a deep  silky dewlap, and limbs as slender as a deer. They appear to have  neither the strength nor weight requisite for this service; and yet the  entire coffee crop of Ceylon, amounting annually to upwards of half a  million hundred weight, is year after year brought down from the  mountains to the coast by these indefatigable little creatures, which,  on returning, carry up proportionally heavy loads, of rice and  implements for the estates.[1] There are two varieties of the native  bullock; one a somewhat coarser animal, of a deep red colour; the other,  the high-bred black one I have just described. So rare was a white one  of this species, under the native kings, that the Kandyans were  compelled to set them apart for the royal herd.[2]    [Footnote 1: A pair of these little bullocks carry up about twenty  bushels of rice to the hills, and bring down from fifty to sixty bushels  of coffee to Colombo.]    [Footnote 2: WOLF says that, in the year 1763, he saw in Ceylon two  white oxen, each of which measured upwards of eight feet high. They were  sent as a present from the King of Atchin.--_Life and Adventures_, p.  172.]    Although bullocks may be said to be the only animals of draught and  burden in Ceylon (horses being rarely used except in spring carriages),  no attempt has been made to improve the breed, or even to better the  condition and treatment of those in use. Their food is indifferent,  pasture in all parts of the island being rare, and cattle are seldom  housed under any vicissitudes of weather.    The labour for which they are best adapted, and in which, before the  opening of roads, these cattle were formerly employed, is in traversing  the jungle paths of the interior, carrying light loads as pack-oxen in  what is called a \"_tavalam_\"--a term which, substituting bullocks for  camels, is equivalent to a \"caravan.\"[1] The class of persons engaged in  this traffic in Ceylon resemble in their occupations the \"Banjarees\" of  Hindustan, who bring down to the coast corn, cotton, and oil, and take  back to the interior cloths and iron and copper utensils. In the  unopened parts of the island, and especially in the eastern provinces,  this primitive practice still continues. When travelling in these  districts I have often encountered long files of pack-bullocks toiling  along the mountain paths, their bells tinkling musically as they moved;  or halting during the noonday heat beside some stream in the forests,  their burdens piled in heaps near the drivers, who had lighted their  cooking fires, whilst the bullocks were permitted to bathe and browse.    [Footnote 1: Attempts have been made to domesticate the camel in Ceylon;  but, I am told, they died of ulcers in the feet, attributed to the too  great moisture of the roads at certain seasons. This explanation seems  insufficient if taken in connection with the fact of the camel living in  perfect health in climates equally, if not more, exposed to rain. I  apprehend that sufficient justice has not been done to the experiment.]    The persons engaged in this wandering trade are chiefly Moors, and the  business carried on by them consists in bringing up salt from the  government depots on the coast to be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13331"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Chichester (1901) (#12)"],[1,"capitals, like the originals, are some of them square,  others irregular octagons. The interior is vaulted, and has diagonal  and wall ribs. On the west and east sides are stone benches. But the  west side has in addition a small arcade of four arches forming  recessed sedilia. The mouldings to the arches of this small arcade are  of about the same date as those in the two outer orders of the  enclosing arch on the south front of this porch. The two smaller  arches under it appear to be later work, if we judge from their  present character. But the arch-mould of the #Doorway# within the  porch is work of approximately the same date as the outer moulded  member of the enclosing arch on the west front of the west porch. The  enclosing arch of the south porch is later work than these. But the  two inner moulded orders of the enclosing arch of the west porch are  even later still in character.    [Illustration: THE SOUTH DOORWAY IN THE WEST WALK OF THE CLOISTER.  _S.B. Bolas & Co., photo_.]    The east side of this south porch forms the west wall of the present  choir singing school--the old sacristy. But this room projects farther  southward than the porch. The limit of its projection is indicated by  a portion of a buttress in the cloister. Between this buttress and the  porch are two small windows--one of them is now blocked up. The upper  one is the same in design as those others on the south side of the  same apartment. These we shall consider presently. Above the central  pier at the entrance to this porch is a miserable figure in stone,  intended to represent a saint.    [Illustration: THE WEST WALK OF THE CLOISTER FROM THE SOUTH-EAST.  _S.B. Bolas & Co., photo_.]    The #Cloister#, which was added in the fifteenth century, is of a  peculiarly irregular shape, and encloses the south transept within the  paradise. It has been much restored at different times. The present  roof is of tiles, and is carried on common rafters. Each has a  cross-tie, and the struts are shaped so as to give a pointed, arched  form to each one. The old fifteenth-century wooden cornice still  remains in some sections. The walling was once all plastered. The  tracery is divided into four compartments by mullions, and each head  is filled with cusped work.    Round the cloister are placed the old houses of the Treasurer, the  Royal Chaplains, and Wiccamical Prebendaries. Above the door leading  to the house of the Royal Chaplains is an interesting monument of the  Tudor period. It is a panel divided into two compartments by a moulded  stone framework.    Leading out of the south walk is a doorway, through which the deanery  may be seen beyond the end of a long walled passage known as S.  Richard's Walk. Looking back northwards, there is a fine view of the  spire and transept from the end of this walk.    The chamber over the present singing school between the south arm of  the transept and the west walk of the cloister shows the effect  produced by some changes made during the fifteenth century. The  masonry was more carefully finished than that of the adjoining  transept--a specimen of twelfth-century work. The joints in the later  work are thinner, and the average size of the stones is in this case  smaller.    On the south side of the wall of this chamber are two buttresses.  Close under the shallow moulded coping at the top of the wall are two  fifteenth-century windows. They are not placed centrally over the  others below. In design they are each divided into three lights by  mullions. On the east side of the middle buttress is an old rain-water  head of (eighteenth-century?) leadwork. Part of the lead piping still  remains, having the old ears to fasten it to the walls. The west side  of this chamber has one buttress on the south angle and a window in  the centre of the wall. Above it is the low slope of a gable. The  window is similar to those on the south side, but the head is a  pointed and four-centred arch. The mullions have been restored. Below  the part just described is the earlier work of the thirteenth  century. It rises as far up as to the string-course formed by the  continuation of the abaci of the capitals in the two small  single-light windows. These narrow and sharp-pointed windows are  peculiar. The arch-moulds are different from the other work of the  same date in the church. There is no sign of tracery in their design,  and the jambs have a simple attached shaft in the outer reveal. The  bases to these shafts are earlier than those of the shafts to the  south aisle chapel windows, and the edge of the inner member of the  window arch is merely cut off with a straight chamber. There is one  window, the same as these, hidden in the west walk of the cloister.  Beneath the windows just described there are two small single-light  openings in each portion of walling on either side of the central  buttress. These six windows serve to light the vaulted (sacristy)  choir school within.    [Illustration: THE EAST WALK OF THE CLOISTER. _S.B. Bolas & Co.,  photo_.]    It has been supposed by some that a chapter-house once existed within  the paradise close by the west angle of the transept. The south end of  the transept rises on the north side of the cloister garth. At the  south-west angle a great part of the twelfth-century masonry in the  broad flat buttresses remains. The south-east angle and buttresses are  quite different. They are perhaps part of the work done during the  thirteenth century, though it is possible that they were introduced  when Langton inserted the large south window of the transept. This  window has been very much restored since the seventeenth century, when  it was almost knocked in pieces. Wooden props served instead of  mullions for many years to hold up the tracery above. The repair that  has been effected retains the old design. Above each angle of the  transept is a turret, octagonal in form. Neither of them is complete.  They were only required in the fifteenth century as a means of access  to the roofs at the parapet level from the staircases in the angle  buttresses. The gable of the transept rises above the parapet just  described, but it is not in the same vertical plane as the face of the  wall below. The top of this gable was for many years in a very wrecked  condition. The design of the tracery in the rose window is in two  orders, based upon equilateral triangles filled in with cusps.    Close to the ground on the south-west corner buttress are two  string-courses. The lower of these is a billet-moulded course cut,  like those to be seen on the south-west tower. Its presence here, and  at this level, shows that this was the original level of the sills of  all the old Norman windows on the outside walls until about the close  of the twelfth century.    On the east side of this part of the transept, at the clerestory  level, are two round-headed windows. Both originally were all of  twelfth-century workmanship. But now the southern one has abaci,  capitals, angle-shafts, and base, which are thirteenth-century work,  and the early label-mould has been changed. The other window shows  partly what was once probably the character of both of them. But the  greater part of this window was restored when the central tower and  spire were rebuilt after 1861. Between the windows is a buttress that  was introduced when the vault was added. The south-east angle on this  side retains part of the twelfth-century flat buttressing. There are  on this wall and the turret different types of masonry, which  represent five distinct periods of building, from the twelfth to the  nineteenth century. But the junction between the work of two of these  periods, being a weak part, shows by the crack down the wall from the  parapet that some movement has taken place here.    Projecting eastwards from the transept is the square chapel (now a  vestry), which took the place of the early apsidal one. Neither of its  three windows has any tracery. The window on the south side is  pointed. The arch-mould is the same as that to the round-headed window  on the east; but there is a label-mould over this south one and not on  the other. The abaci are new, and the angle-shafts and bases as well,  but the capitals are old, though decayed. The parapet on the south is  of the same character and date as that over the wall of the choir, but  earlier than that above the south window of the transept, which is of  the same date as that on the south wall of the nave.    The roof of this chapel appears, from the raking channel on the  transept wall, to have once been higher, with a sharper pitch. The  finish to the present gable point has disappeared. On the east wall  and on the south-west buttress of the transept there are two  interesting old lead rain-water heads. The east wall of the chapel  runs on northwards till it becomes a part of the buttress of the  choir. The wall between the north buttress of the chapel and the  buttress of the choir aisle close by is pierced with two small cusped  windows of fifteenth-century date. Below these is a larger and sharply  pointed arched head. It has no mouldings. But the square-headed small  light under it has splayed jambs. This opening was probably once a  round-headed twelfth-century window, as the old abacus is still in  position.    The #South Side of the Choir# is externally divided into five bays.  There are five flying-buttresses to carry down the vault thrusts, with  a pinnacle above the buttress at the south-east angle. The first,  second, and third bays from the east side of the transept have still  the round-arched windows of the twelfth century set in the walling of  the same date. But it should be noted that part of the window in the  first bay was rebuilt after 1861. The fourth and fifth bays have  pointed windows, carved capitals, and angle-shafts. These, though now  entirely renewed, were built when the whole of this part of the choir  was added. Part of the walling"]]]
