It  was a confession too, but of sin, and the need of cleansing, not, as  later, of faith in a person, or a creed, although it did imply acceptance  of a man's leadership. To a Hebrew mind it was preaching by symbol as well  as by word. The official deputation sent from Jerusalem to look John up  asked why he should be using a purifying rite if he were neither the  Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet. They could understand the  appropriateness of either of these three persons using such a rite in  connection with his preaching as indicating the national need of  cleansing. And in the beginning Jesus for a time, through His disciples,  joined in John's plan of baptizing those who confessed sorrow for sin.    Jesus acknowledged John as His own representative, and honored him as  such, from first to last. He gives him the strongest approval and backing.  The national treatment of John always affects Jesus' movements. When,  toward the close, His authority is challenged, He at once calls attention  to the evident authority of His forerunner and refuses to go farther.    A trace of that ominous, puzzling foreboding noticed in the Old Testament  vision of the coming One creeps in here. Pointing to Jesus, John says,  \"Behold the lamb of God, who beareth (away) the sin of the world.\" Why did  John say that? _We_ read his words backward in the light of Calvary. But  _he_ could not do that, and did not. He knew only a _King_ coming. Why?  Even as Isaiah fifty-third, and Psalm twenty-second were written, the  writers there, the speaker here, impelled to an utterance, the meaning of  which, was not clear to themselves.    This relation and intimacy between these two, John and Jesus, must be  steadily kept in mind.        <u>The Contemptuous Rejection.</u>      From the very first, though Jesus was _accepted by individuals_ of every  class, _He was rejected by the nation_. This is the twin-fact standing out  in boldest outline through the Gospel stories. The nation's rejection  began with the formal presentation of Him to it by John. First was the  simple refusal to accept, then the decision to reject, then the  determination that everybody else should reject too. First, that He should  not be admitted to their circle, then that He should be kept out of their  circle, and then that He should be kept out of every circle. There are  these three distinct stages in the rejection from the Jordan waters to the  Calvary Hill.    First came _the contemptuous rejection_. John was a great man. Made of the  same rugged stuff as the old prophets, he was more than they in being the  King's own messenger and herald. In his character he was great as the  greatest, though not as great in privilege as those living in the kingdom.  He preached and baptized. With glowing eyes of fire, deep-set under shaggy  brows, and plain vigorous speech which, if pricked, would ooze out red  life, he told of the sin that must be cleaned out as a preparation for the  coming One. And to all who would, he applied the cleansing rite.    He had great drawing power. Away from cultured Jerusalem on the hilltops  down to the river bottoms, and the stony barrens of the Jordan; from the  Judean hill country, away from the stately temple service with its music  and impressive ritual, to his simple open-air, plain, fervid preaching, he  drew men. All sorts came, the proud Pharisee, the cynical Sadducee, the  soldiers, the publicans, farmers, shepherds, tradespeople--all came. His  daily gatherings represented the whole people. The nation came to his  call. It was the unconscious testimony of the nation to his rugged  greatness and to his divine mission. They were impelled to come, and  listen, and do, and questioningly wonder if this can be the promised  national leader.    One day a committee came from the Jewish Senate to make official inquiry  as to who he claimed to be. With critical, captious questions they demand  his authority. True to his mission and his Master, he said, \"I am not  _the_ One, but sent to tell you that He's coming, and so near that it's  time to get ready.\" Then the next day, as Jesus walks quietly through the  crowd, probably just back from the wilderness, he finishes his reply to  the deputation. With glowing eyes intently riveted upon Jesus, and finger  pointing, before the alert eyes of his hundreds of hearers--Pharisees,  Sadducees, official committee, Roman soldiers, and common folk--he said in  clear, ringing tones, \"_That is He: the coming One!_\"    No more dramatic, impressive presentation could have been made of Jesus to  the nation. To their Oriental minds it would be peculiarly significant,  Mark keenly the result. On the part of the leaders _utter silence_ There  could be no more cutting expression of their contempt. With eyebrows  uplifted, eyes coldly questioning, their lips slightly curling, or held  close together and pursed out, and shoulders shrugging, their contempt,  utter disgusted contempt, could not be more loudly expressed. If they had  had the least disposition to believe John's words about Jesus, even so far  as to _investigate_ patiently and thoroughly, how different would their  conduct have been! But--only silence. And silence long continued. Jesus  gave them plenty of time before the next step was taken. No silence ever  spoke in louder voice. That same day five thoughtful men of that same  throng _did_ investigate, and were satisfied, and gave at once loyal,  loving allegiance.    A few months later, the Passover Feast drew crowds from everywhere to  Jerusalem. Jesus coming into the temple areas, with the crowds, one day,  is struck at once with the strange scene. Instead of reverent, holy quiet,  as worshippers approached the dwelling-place of God, with their offerings  of penitence and worship, the busy bustle of a market-place greets His  ears. The noise of cattle and sheep being driven here and there, the  pavement like an unkempt barnyard, loud, discordant voices of men handling  the beasts and bargaining over exchange rates at the brokers'  tables--strange scene. Is it surprising that His ear and eye and heart,  perhaps fresh from a bit of quiet morning talk with His Father, were  shocked? Here, where everything should have called to devotion, everything  _jarred_.    Quietly and quickly putting some bits of knotted string together, He  started the stock out, doubtless against the protests of the keepers. With  flashing light out of those keen eyes, He tipped over the tables, spilling  out their precious greedy coins, and ordered the crates of pigeons  removed. But all with no suggestion of any violence used toward anybody.  Reluctantly, perhaps angrily, wholly against their plans and wishes, the  crowd, impelled by _something_ in this unknown Man, with no outer evidence  of authority, goes. It is a remarkable tribute, both to the power of His  personal presence and to His executive faculty.    Of course the thing made trouble. It was the talk of the town, and of all  the foreigners for days after. The leaders were aroused and angered,  deeply angered. This stranger had kicked up a pretty muss with His  inconvenient earnestness and inconsiderate quoting of Scripture. It was a  practical assumption of superior authority over them. It was an assumption  of the truth of John's ignored claim that He was the promised King.    Was not this arrangement in the temple area a great convenience for the  many strangers, who were their brothers and guests; a real kindly act of  hospitality? Yes--and was it not, too, a finely organized bit of business  for profiting by these strangers, a using of their proper authority over  the temple territory to transfer their brothers' foreign coins safely over  to their own purses? Aye, it was a transmuting of their holy offices into  gold by the alchemy of their coarse, greedy touch.    Jesus' conduct was the keenest sort of criticism of these rulers, before  the eyes of the nation and of the thousands of pilgrims present. These  leaders never forgave this humiliating rebuke of themselves. It made their  nerves raw to His touch ever after. Here is the real reason of all their  after bitter dislike. They had a sensitive pocket-nerve. It was a sort of  pneumogastric nerve so close did it come to their lives. Jesus touched it  roughly. It never quit aching. Scratch all their later charges against Him  and under all is this sore spot. The tree of the cross began growing its  wood that day. Their hot, captious demand for authority, meant as much for  the ears of the crowd as for His, brought from Jesus, who read His future  in their hearts, a reply which they could not understand. They asked their  question for the crowd to hear, He replied for His disciples to remember  in the after years. There could be no evidence of authority more  significant than this temple incident.    His first public work was done at this time. The great throng of pilgrims  from around the world, attracted to Him by this simple daring act of  leadership, witnessed a group of mighty acts during these Passover days.  The angry leaders had critically asked for \"signs\" of His authority. He  gave them in abundance, not in response to their captious demand, but  doubtless, as always, in response to pressing human needs. The result was  that many persons accepted Him, but the nation in its rulers, maintained  their attitude of angered, contemptuous silence. But underneath that  surface the pot is beginning to boil.    Of all the members of the national Senate, one, _just one_, comes to make  personal inquiry, and sift this man's claim sincerely and candidly. And  he, be it marked, chooses a darkened hour for that visit. That night hour  speaks volumes of the smouldering passion under their contempt. That Jesus  recognized fully their attitude and just what it meant comes out in that  quiet evening talk. To that sincere inquirer, He frankly Jays, \"You people  won't receive the witness that John and I have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12814"],[0,"Philippine Folk Tales (#12)"],[1,"had brought much money to Dogedog, and now he had  to buy two horses to carry his sacks of silver. As soon as he reached  home, he bought the house of a very rich man and went to live in  it. And he was very happy, for he did not have to work any more. [92]            IGOROT        Introduction      Three or four days' journey to the south and east of the Tinguian live  the Igorot; but so difficult are the trails over the mountains and  through the swift rivers that there is little intercourse between  the two tribes, consequently each believes the other a people to  be feared. Salt, weapons, and jars are sometimes exchanged, but the  customs and beliefs are not similar. Each group leads its own life  and is governed by its own spirits.    From a distance an Igorot village looks like a group of haystacks  nestling among the hills; but viewed more closely, it is found  to consist of houses whose board sides are almost hidden by the  overhanging grass roofs. The upper part of the house is used as a  storehouse, while below, on a ground floor, the family cooks and  eats. In one end there is a tiny boxlike bedroom where the father,  mother, and small children sleep. After they are two or three years  old the girls spend the night in a dormitory, while the boys sleep  in the men's council house.    These people have splendid terraced fields on the mountain sides where  water is brought from the streams through troughs and ditches. Here  both men and women are busy early and late cultivating the rice,  sweet potatoes, and small vegetables on which they live. The men are  head-hunters and ardent warriors, each village demanding a head in  payment for any taken by a hostile village.    Watching over the Igorot, controlling the winds and the rains, and  providing good crops and health for the people, is the Great Spirit,  Lumawig, who lives in the sky. He is believed to have created the  Igorot and even to have lived among them on the earth. He no longer  visits them in person, they say, but each month they perform a ceremony  at which they pray to him to protect them and entreat him to favor  them with health and good crops.    The following tales are told by the fathers and mothers to the children  to teach them how things came to be as they are.        The Creation    _Igorot_      In the beginning there were no people on the earth. Lumawig, [93]  the Great Spirit, came down from the sky and cut many reeds. [94] He  divided these into pairs which he placed in different parts of the  world, and then he said to them, \"You must speak.\" Immediately the  reeds became people, and in each place was a man and a woman who could  talk, but the language of each couple differed from that of the others.    Then Lumawig commanded each man and woman to marry, which they did. By  and by there were many children, all speaking the same language as  their parents. These, in turn, married and had many children. In this  way there came to be many people on the earth.    Now Lumawig saw that there were several things which the people on  the earth needed to use, so he set to work to supply them. He created  salt, and told the inhabitants of one place to boil it down and sell  it to their neighbors. But these people could not understand the  directions of the Great Spirit, and the next time he visited them,  they had not touched the salt.    Then he took it away from them and gave it to the people of a place  called Mayinit. [95] These did as he directed, and because of this  he told them that they should always be owners of the salt, and that  the other peoples must buy of them.    Then Lumawig went to the people of Bontoc and told them to get clay  and make pots. They got the clay, but they did not understand the  moulding, and the jars were not well shaped. Because of their failure,  Lumawig told them that they would always have to buy their jars,  and he removed the pottery to Samoki. [96] When he told the people  there what to do, they did just as he said, and their jars were well  shaped and beautiful. Then the Great Spirit saw that they were fit  owners of the pottery, and he told them that they should always make  many jars to sell.    In this way Lumawig taught the people and brought to them all the  things which they now have.        The Flood Story    _Igorot_      Once upon a time, when the world was flat and there were no mountains,  there lived two brothers, sons of Lumawig, the Great Spirit. The  brothers were fond of hunting, and since no mountains had formed  there was no good place to catch wild pig and deer, and the older  brother said:    \"Let us cause water to flow over all the world and cover it, and then  mountains will rise up.\" [97]    So they caused water to flow over all the earth, and when it was  covered they took the head-basket [98] of the town and set it for a  trap. The brothers were very much pleased when they went to look at  their trap, for they had caught not only many wild pigs and deer but  also many people.    Now Lumawig looked down from his place in the sky and saw that his  sons had flooded the earth and that in all the world there was just one  spot which was not covered. And he saw that all the people in the world  had been drowned except one brother and sister who lived in Pokis.    Then Lumawig descended, and he called to the boy  and girl, saying:    \"Oh, you are still alive.\"    \"Yes,\" answered the boy, \"we are still alive, but we are very cold.\"    So Lumawig commanded his dog and deer to get fire [99] for the boy  and girl. The dog and the deer swam quickly away, but though Lumawig  waited a long time they did not return, and all the time the boy and  girl were growing colder.    Finally Lumawig himself went after the dog and the deer, and when he  reached them he said:    \"Why are you so long in bringing the fire to Pokis? Get ready and  come quickly while I watch you, for the boy and girl are very cold.\"    Then the dog and the deer took the fire and started to swim through the  flood, but when they had gone only a little way the fire was put out.    Lumawig commanded them to get more fire and they did so, but they  swam only a little way again when that of the deer went out, and  that of the dog would have been extinguished also had not Lumawig  gone quickly to him and taken it.    As soon as Lumawig reached Pokis he built a big fire which warmed the  brother and sister; and the water evaporated so that the world was  as it was before, except that now there were mountains. The brother  and sister married and had children, and thus there came to be many  people on the earth.        Lumawig on Earth    _Igorot_      One day when Lumawig, [100] the Great Spirit, looked down from his  place in the sky he saw two sisters gathering beans. And he decided  to go down to visit them. When he arrived at the place he asked them  what they were doing. The younger, whose name was Fukan, answered:    \"We are gathering beans, but it takes a long time to get enough,  for my sister wants to go bathing all the time.\"    Then Lumawig said to the older sister:    \"Hand me a single pod of the beans.\"    And when she had given it to him, he shelled it into the basket and  immediately the basket was full. [101] The younger sister laughed at  this, and Lumawig said to her:    \"Give me another pod and another basket.\"    She did so, and when he had shelled the pod, that basket was full  also. Then he said to the younger sister:    \"Go home and get three more baskets.\"    She went home, but when she asked for three more baskets her mother  said that the beans were few and she could not need so many. Then  Fukan told her of the young man who could fill a basket from one pod  of beans, and the father, who heard her story, said:    \"Go bring the young man here, for I think he must be a god.\"    So Fukan took the three baskets back to Lumawig, and when he had  filled them as he did the other two, he helped the girls carry them  to the house. As they reached their home, he stopped outside to cool  himself, but the father called to him and he went up into the house  and asked for some water. The father brought him a cocoanut shell full,  and before drinking Lumawig looked at it and said:    \"If I stay here with you, I shall become very strong.\"    The next morning Lumawig asked to see their chickens, and when they  opened the chicken-coop out came a hen and many little chicks. \"Are  these all of your chickens?\" asked Lumawig; and the father assured  him that they were all. He then bade them bring rice meal that he  might feed them, and as the chickens ate they all grew rapidly till  they were cocks and hens.    Next Lumawig asked how many pigs they had, and the father replied  that they had one with some little ones. Then Lumawig bade them fill  a pail with sweet potato leaves and he fed the pigs. And as they ate  they also grew to full size.    The father was so pleased with all these things that he offered his  elder daughter to Lumawig for a wife. But the Great Spirit said he  preferred to marry the younger; so that was arranged. Now when his  brother-in-law learned that Lumawig desired a feast at his wedding,  he was very angry and said:    \"Where would you get food for your wedding feast? There is no rice,  nor beef, nor pork, nor chicken,\"    But Lumawig only answered, \"I shall provide our wedding feast.\"    In the morning they all set out for Lanao, for Lumawig did not care  to stay any longer in the house with his brother-in-law. As soon as  they arrived he sent out for some tree trunks, but the trees that  the people brought in were so small that Lumawig himself went to the  forest and cut two large pine trees which he hurled to Lanao.    When the people had built a fire of the trees he commanded them to  bring ten kettles filled with water. Soon the water was boiling hot  and the brother-in-law laughed and said:    \"Where is your rice? You have the boiling water, but you do not seem  to think of the"]]]
