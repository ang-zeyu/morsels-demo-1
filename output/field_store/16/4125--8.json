On the other hand, his long and laborious effort to refute  Newton's theory of the composition of white light is now generally  regarded as a misdirection of energy. In his _Roman Elegies_ (1790) he  struck a note of pagan sensuality. The pensive distichs, telling of  the wanton doings of Amor amid the grandeur that was Rome, were a  little shocking in their frank portraiture of the emancipated flesh.  The outbreak of violence in France seemed to him nothing but madness  and folly, since he did not see the real Revolution, but only the  Paris Terror.    He wrote two or three very ordinary plays to satirize various phases  of the revolutionary excitement--phases that now seem as insignificant  as the plays themselves. In 1792 he accompanied the Duke of Weimar on  the inglorious Austro-Prussian invasion of France, heard the cannonade  at Valmy, and was an interested observer as the allies tumbled back  over the Rhine. Perhaps the best literary achievement of these years  is the fine hexameter version of the medieval _Reynard the Fox_.    The year 1794 marks the beginning of more intimate relations between  Goethe and Schiller. Their memorable friendship lasted until  Schiller's death, in 1805--the richest decade in the whole history of  German letters. The two men became in a sense allies and stood  together in the championship of good taste and humane idealism.  Goethe's literary occupations during this period were very  multifarious; a list of his writings in the various fields of poetry,  drama, prose fiction, criticism, biography, art and art-history,  literary scholarship, and half a dozen sciences, would show a  many-sidedness to which there is no modern parallel. Of all this mass  of writing only a few works of major importance can even be  mentioned here.    In 1796 appeared _Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship_, a novel which  captivated the literary class, if not the general public, and was  destined to exert great influence on German fiction for a generation  to come. It had been some twenty years in the making. In its earlier  form it was called _Wilhelm Meister's Theatrical Mission_.[3] This  tells the story of a Werther-like youth who is to be saved from  Werther's fate by finding a work to do. His \"mission,\" apparently, is  to become a good actor and to promote high ideals of the histrionic  art. Incidentally he is ambitious to be a dramatic poet, and his  childhood is simply that of Wolfgang Goethe. For reasons intimately  connected with his own development Goethe finally decided to change  his plan and his title, and to present Wilhelm's variegated  experiences as an apprenticeship in the school of life. In the final  version Wilhelm comes to the conclusion that the theatre is _not_ his  mission--all that was a mistaken ambition. Just what use he _will_  make of his well-disciplined energy does not clearly appear at the end  of the story, since Goethe bundles him off to Italy. He was already  planning a continuation of the story under the title of _Wilhelm  Meister's Journeymanship_. In this second part the hero becomes  interested in questions of social uplift and thinks of becoming a  surgeon. Taken as a whole _Wilhelm Meister_ moves with a slowness  which is quite out of tune with later ideals of prose fiction. It also  lacks concentration and artistic finality. But it is replete with  Goethe's ripe and mellow wisdom, and it contains more of his intimate  self than any other work of his except _Faust_.    During this high noon of his life Goethe again took up his long  neglected _Faust_, decided to make two parts of it, completed the  First Part, and thought out much that was to go into the Second Part.  By this time he had become somewhat alienated from the spirit of his  youth, when he had envisaged life in a mist of vague and stormy  emotionalism. His present passion was for clearness. So he boldly  decided to convert the old tragedy of sin and suffering into a drama  of mental clearing-up. The early Faust--the pessimist, murderer,  seducer--was to be presented as temporarily wandering in the dark; as  a man who had gone grievously wrong in passionate error, but was  essentially \"good\" by virtue of his aspiring nature, and hence, in the  Lord's fulness of time, was to be led out into the light and saved.  The First Part, ending with the heart-rending death of Margaret in her  prison-cell, and leaving Faust in an agony of remorse, was published  in 1808. Faust's redemption, by enlarged experience of life and  especially by his symbolic union with the Greek Queen of Beauty, was  reserved for the Second Part.    [Illustration: MONUMENT TO GOETHE (Berlin 1880) Sculptor, Fritz   Schaper]    The other more notable works of this period are _Hermann and  Dorothea_, a delightful poem in dactylic hexameters, picturing a bit  of German still life against the sinister background of the French  Revolution, and the _Natural Daughter_, which was planned to body  forth, in the form of a dramatic trilogy in blank verse, certain  phases of Goethe's thinking about the upheaval in France. In the  former he appears once more as a poet of the plain people, with an eye  and a heart for their ways and their outlook upon life. Everybody  likes _Hermann and Dorothea_. On the other hand, the _Natural  Daughter_ is disappointing, and not merely because it is a fragment.  (Only the first part of the intended trilogy was written.) Goethe had  now convinced himself that the function of art is to present the  typical. Accordingly the characters appear as types of humanity  divested of all that is accidental or peculiar to the individual. The  most of them have not even a name. The consequence is that,  notwithstanding the splendid verse and the abounding wisdom of the  speeches, the personages do not seem to be made of genuine human  stuff. As a great thinker's comment on the Revolution the _Natural  Daughter_ is almost negligible.    The decade that followed the death of Schiller was for Germany a time  of terrible trial, during which Goethe pursued the even tenor of his  way as a poet and man of science. He had little sympathy with the  national uprising against Napoleon, whom he looked on as the  invincible subduer of the hated Revolution. From the point of view of  our modern nationalism, which was just then entering on its  world-transforming career, his conduct was unpatriotic. But let him at  least be rightly understood. It was not that he lacked sympathy for  the German people, but he misjudged and underestimated the new forces  that were coming into play. As the son of an earlier age he could only  conceive a people's welfare as the gift of a wise ruler. He thought of  politics as the affair of the great. He hated war and all eruptive  violence, being convinced that good would come, not by such means, but  by enlightenment, self-control and attending to one's work in one's  sphere. To the historian Luden he said in 1813:    \"Do not believe that I am indifferent to the great ideas of freedom,  people, fatherland. No! These ideas are in us, they are a part of our  being, and no one can cast them from him. I too have a warm heart for  Germany. I have often felt bitter pain in thinking of the German  people, so worthy of respect in some ways, so miserable on the whole.  A comparison of the German people with other peoples arouses painful  emotions which I try in every way to surmount; and in science and art  I have found the wings whereby I rise above them. But the comfort  which these afford is after all a poor comfort that does not  compensate for the proud consciousness of belonging to a great and  strong people that is honored and feared.\"    In 1808 he published _The Elective Affinities_, a novel in which the  tragic effects of lawless passion invading the marriage relation were  set forth with telling art. Soon after this he began to write a memoir  of his life. He was now a European celebrity, the dream of his youth  had come true, and he purposed to show in detail how everything had  happened; that is, how his literary personality had evolved amid the  environing conditions. He conceived himself as a phenomenon to be  explained. That he called his memoir _Poetry and Truth_ was perhaps an  error of judgment, since the title has been widely misunderstood. For  Goethe poetry was not the antithesis of truth, but a higher species of  truth--the actuality as seen by the selecting, combining, and  harmonizing imagination. In themselves, he would have said, the facts  of a man's life are meaningless, chaotic, discordant: it is the poet's  office to put them into the crucible of his spirit and give them forth  as a significant and harmonious whole. The \"poetry\" of Goethe's  autobiography--by far the best of autobiographies in the German  language--must not be taken to imply concealment, perversion,  substitution, or anything of that gross kind.    [Illustration: GOETHE'S MONUMENT IN ROME. (SCULPTOR, EBERLEIN)   Presented to the City of Rome by the German Emperor (From Seidel's   _Der Kaiser and die Kunst_)]    It lies in the very style of the book and is a part of its author's  method of self-revelation. That he devotes so much space to the  seemingly transient and unimportant love-affairs of his youth is only  his way of recognizing that the poet-soul is born of love and  nourished by love. He felt that these fleeting amorosities were a part  of the natural history of his inner being.    And even in the serene afternoon of his life lovely woman often  disturbed his soul, just as in the days of his youth. But the poetic  expression of his feeling gradually became less simple and direct: he  liked to embroider it with musing reflections and exotic fancies  gathered from everywhere. Just as he endeavored with indefatigable  eagerness of mind to keep abreast of scientific research, so he tried  to assimilate the poetry of all nations.

I should have recognised you  instantly from the portrait of your lamented uncle in Greenwich  Hospital.\"    \"Anstey is a wag, you understand,\" explained Thorndyke, \"but he has  lucid intervals. He'll have one presently if we are patient.\"    \"Patient!\" snorted our eccentric visitor, \"it is I who need to be  patient when I am dragged into police courts and other sinks of iniquity  to plead for common thieves and robbers like a Kennington Lane  advocate.\"    \"You've been talking to Lawley, I see,\" said Thorndyke.    \"Yes, and he tells me that we haven't a leg to stand upon.\"    \"No, we've got to stand on our heads, as men of intellect should. But  Lawley knows nothing about the case.\"    \"He thinks he knows it all,\" said Anstey.    \"Most fools do,\" retorted Thorndyke. \"They arrive at their knowledge by  intuition--a deuced easy road and cheap travelling too. We reserve our  defence--I suppose you agree to that?\"    \"I suppose so. The magistrate is sure to commit unless you have an  unquestionable _alibi_.\"    \"We shall put in an _alibi_, but we are not depending on it.\"    \"Then we had better reserve our defence,\" said Anstey; \"and it is time  that we wended on our pilgrimage, for we are due at Lawley's at  half-past ten. Is Jervis coming with us?\"    \"Yes, you'd better come,\" said Thorndyke. \"It's the adjourned hearing of  poor Hornby's case, you know. There won't be anything done on our side,  but we may be able to glean some hint from the prosecution.\"    \"I should like to hear what takes place, at any rate,\" I said, and we  accordingly sallied forth together in the direction of Lincoln's Inn, on  the north side of which Mr. Lawley's office was situated.    \"Ah!\" said the solicitor, as we entered, \"I am glad you've come; I was  getting anxious--it doesn't do to be late on these occasions, you know.  Let me see, do you know Mr. Walter Hornby? I don't think you do.\" He  presented Thorndyke and me to our client's cousin, and as we shook  hands, we viewed one another with a good deal of mutual interest.    \"I have heard about you from my aunt,\" said he, addressing himself more  particularly to me. \"She appears to regard you as a kind of legal  Maskelyne and Cooke. I hope, for my cousin's sake, that you will be able  to work the wonders that she anticipates. Poor old fellow! He looks  pretty bad, doesn't he?\"    I glanced at Reuben, who was at the moment talking to Thorndyke, and as  he caught my eye he held out his hand with a warmth that I found very  pathetic. He seemed to have aged since I had last seen him, and was  pale and rather thinner, but he was composed in his manner and seemed to  me to be taking his trouble very well on the whole.    \"Cab's at the door, sir,\" a clerk announced.    \"Cab,\" repeated Mr. Lawley, looking dubiously at me; \"we want an  omnibus.\"    \"Dr. Jervis and I can walk,\" Walter Hornby suggested. \"We shall probably  get there as soon as you, and it doesn't matter if we don't.\"    \"Yes, that will do,\" said Mr. Lawley; \"you two walk down together. Now  let us go.\"    We trooped out on to the pavement, beside which a four-wheeler was drawn  up, and as the others were entering the cab, Thorndyke stood close  beside me for a moment.    \"Don't let him pump you,\" he said in a low voice, without looking at me;  then he sprang into the cab and slammed the door.    \"What an extraordinary affair this is,\" Walter Hornby remarked, after we  had been walking in silence for a minute or two; \"a most ghastly  business. I must confess that I can make neither head nor tail of it.\"    \"How is that?\" I asked.    \"Why, do you see, there are apparently only two possible theories of the  crime, and each of them seems to be unthinkable. On the one hand there  is Reuben, a man of the most scrupulous honour, as far as my experience  of him goes, committing a mean and sordid theft for which no motive can  be discovered--for he is not poor, nor pecuniarily embarrassed nor in  the smallest degree avaricious. On the other hand, there is this  thumb-print, which, in the opinion of the experts, is tantamount to the  evidence of an eye-witness that he did commit the theft. It is  positively bewildering. Don't you think so?\"    \"As you put it,\" I answered, \"the case is extraordinarily puzzling.\"    \"But how else would you put it?\" he demanded, with ill-concealed  eagerness.    \"I mean that, if Reuben is the man you believe him to be, the thing is  incomprehensible.\"    \"Quite so,\" he agreed, though he was evidently disappointed at my  colourless answer.    He walked on silently for a few minutes and then said: \"I suppose it  would not be fair to ask if you see any way out of the difficulty? We  are all, naturally anxious about the upshot of the affair, seeing what  poor old Reuben's position is.\"    \"Naturally. But the fact is that I know no more than you do, and as to  Thorndyke, you might as well cross-examine a Whitstable native as put  questions to him.\"    \"Yes, so I gathered from Juliet. But I thought you might have gleaned  some notion of the line of defence from your work in the laboratory--the  microscopical and photographic work I mean.\"    \"I was never in the laboratory until last night, when Thorndyke took me  there with your aunt and Miss Gibson; the work there is done by the  laboratory assistant, and his knowledge of the case, I should say, is  about as great as a type-founder's knowledge of the books that he is  helping to produce. No; Thorndyke is a man who plays a single-handed  game and no one knows what cards he holds until he lays them on the  table.\"    My companion considered this statement in silence while I congratulated  myself on having parried, with great adroitness, a rather inconvenient  question. But the time was not far distant when I should have occasion  to reproach myself bitterly for having been so explicit and emphatic.    \"My uncle's condition,\" Walter resumed after a pause, \"is a pretty  miserable one at present, with this horrible affair added to his own  personal worries.\"    \"Has he any special trouble besides this, then?\" I asked.    \"Why, haven't you heard? I thought you knew about it, or I shouldn't  have spoken--not that it is in any way a secret, seeing that it is  public property in the city. The fact is that his financial affairs are  a little entangled just now.\"    \"Indeed!\" I exclaimed, considerably startled by this new development.    \"Yes, things have taken a rather awkward turn, though I think he will  pull through all right. It is the usual thing, you know--investments, or  perhaps one should say speculations. He appears to have sunk a lot of  capital in mines--thought he was 'in the know,' not unnaturally; but it  seems he wasn't after all, and the things have gone wrong, leaving him  with a deal more money than he can afford locked up and the possibility  of a dead loss if they don't revive. Then there are these infernal  diamonds. He is not morally responsible, we know; but it is a question  if he is not legally responsible, though the lawyers think he is not.  Anyhow, there is going to be a meeting of the creditors to-morrow.\"    \"And what do you think they will do?\"    \"Oh, they will, most probably, let him go on for the present; but, of  course, if he is made accountable for the diamonds there will be nothing  for it but to 'go through the hoop,' as the sporting financier  expresses it.\"    \"The diamonds were of considerable value, then?\"    \"From twenty-five to thirty thousand pounds' worth vanished with that  parcel.\"    I whistled. This was a much bigger affair than I had imagined, and I was  wondering if Thorndyke had realised the magnitude of the robbery, when  we arrived at the police court.    \"I suppose our friends have gone inside,\" said Walter. \"They must have  got here before us.\"    This supposition was confirmed by a constable of whom we made inquiry,  and who directed us to the entrance to the court. Passing down a passage  and elbowing our way through the throng of idlers, we made for the  solicitor's box, where we had barely taken our seats when the case was  called.    Unspeakably dreary and depressing were the brief proceedings that  followed, and dreadfully suggestive of the helplessness of even an  innocent man on whom the law has laid its hand and in whose behalf its  inexorable machinery has been set in motion.    The presiding magistrate, emotionless and dry, dipped his pen while  Reuben, who had surrendered to his bail, was placed in the dock and the  charge read over to him. The counsel representing the police gave an  abstract of the case with the matter-of-fact air of a house-agent  describing an eligible property. Then, when the plea of \"not guilty\" had  been entered, the witnesses were called. There were only two, and when  the name of the first, John Hornby, was called, I glanced towards the  witness-box with no little curiosity.    I had not hitherto met Mr. Hornby, and as he now entered the box, I saw  an elderly man, tall, florid, and well-preserved, but strained and wild  in expression and displaying his uncontrollable agitation by continual  nervous movements which contrasted curiously with the composed demeanour  of the accused man. Nevertheless, he gave his evidence in a perfectly  connected manner, recounting the events connected with the discovery of  the crime in much the same words as I had heard Mr. Lawley use, though,  indeed, he was a good deal more emphatic than that gentleman had been in  regard to the excellent character borne by the prisoner.    After him came Mr. Singleton, of the finger-print department at Scotland  Yard, to whose evidence I listened with close attention. He produced the  paper which bore the thumb-print in blood (which had previously been  identified by Mr. Hornby) and a paper bearing the print, taken by  himself, of the prisoner's left thumb. These two thumb-prints, he  stated, were"]]]
