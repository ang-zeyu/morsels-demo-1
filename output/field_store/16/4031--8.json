You must carry me back again or I swear that I will make a  cheese-cloth out of your jacket!\"    The friar's gray eyes once more twinkled with a cunning gleam that boded  no good to Robin; but his voice was as calm and courteous as ever.    \"Your wits are keen, my son,\" he said; \"and I see that the waters of the  stream have not quenched your spirit. Once more will I bend my back to  the oppressor and carry the weight of the haughty.\"    So Robin mounted again in high glee, and carried his sword in his  hand, and went prepared to tarry upon the other side. But while he  was bethinking himself what great words to use, when he should arrive  thither, he felt himself slipping from the friar's broad back. He  clutched frantically to save himself but had too round a surface to  grasp, besides being hampered by his weapon. So down went he with a  loud splash into the middle of the stream, where the crafty friar had  conveyed him.    \"There!\" quoth the holy man; \"choose you, choose you, my fine fellow,  whether you will sink or swim!\" And he gained his own bank without more  ado, while Robin thrashed and spluttered about until he made shift to  grasp a willow wand and thus haul himself ashore on the other side.    Then Robin's rage waxed furious, despite his wetting, and he took his  bow and his arrows and let fly one shaft after another at the worthy  friar. But they rattled harmlessly off his steel buckler, while he  laughed and minded them no more than if they had been hail-stones.    \"Shoot on, shoot on, good fellow,\" he sang out; \"shoot as you have  begun; if you shoot here a summer's day, your mark I will not shun!\"    So Robin shot, and passing well, till all his arrows were gone, when  from very rage he began to revile him.    \"You bloody villain!\" shouted he, \"You psalm-singing hypocrite! You  reviler of good hasty pudding! Come but within reach of my sword  arm, and, friar or no friar, I'll shave your tonsure closer than ever  bald-pated monk was shaven before!\"    \"Soft you and fair!\" said the friar unconcernedly; \"hard words are  cheap, and you may need your wind presently. An you would like a bout  with swords, meet me halfway i' the stream.\"    And with this speech the friar waded into the brook, sword in hand,  where he was met halfway by the impetuous outlaw.    Thereupon began a fierce and mighty battle. Up and down, in and out,  back and forth they fought. The swords flashed in the rays of the  declining sun and then met with a clash that would have shivered less  sturdy weapons or disarmed less sturdy wielders. Many a smart blow was  landed, but each perceived that the other wore an undercoat of linked  mail which might not be pierced. Nathless, their ribs ached at the force  of the blows. Once and again they paused by mutual consent and caught  breath and looked hard each at the other; for never had either met so  stout a fellow.    Finally in a furious onset of lunge and parry Robin's foot stepped on a  rolling stone, and he went down upon his knees. But his antagonist would  not take this advantage: he paused until Robin should get upon his feet.    \"Now by our Lady!\" cried the outlaw, using his favorite oath, \"you are  the fairest swordsman that I have met in many a long day. I would beg a  boon of you.\"    \"What is it?\" said the other.    \"Give me leave to set my horn to my mouth and blow three blasts  thereon.\"    \"That will I do,\" said the curtall friar, \"blow till your breath fails,  an it please you.\"    Then, says the old ballad, Robin Hood set his horn to mouth and blew  mighty blasts; and half a hundred yeomen, bows bent, came raking over  the lee.    \"Whose men are these,\" said the friar, \"that come so hastily?\"    \"These men are mine,\" said Robin Hood, feeling that his time to laugh  was come at last.    Then said the friar in his turn, \"A boon, a boon, the like I gave to  you. Give me leave to set my fist to my mouth and whistle three blasts  thereon.\"    \"That will I do,\" said Robin, \"or else I were lacking in courtesy.\"    The friar set his fist to his mouth and put the horn to shame by the  piercing whistles he blew; whereupon half a hundred great dogs came  running and jumping so swiftly that they had reached their bank as soon  as Robin Hood's men had reached his side.    Then followed a rare foolish conflict. Stutely, Much, Little John  and the other outlaws began sending their arrows whizzing toward the  opposite bank; but the dogs, which were taught of the friar, dodged the  missiles cleverly and ran and fetched them back again, just as the dogs  of to-day catch sticks.    \"I have never seen the like of this in my days!\" cried Little John,  amazed.    \"'Tis rank sorcery and witchcraft.\"    \"Take off your dogs, Friar Tuck!\" shouted Will Scarlet, who had but then  run up, and who now stood laughing heartily at the scene.    \"Friar Tuck!\" exclaimed Robin, astounded. \"Are you Friar Tuck? Then am I  your friend, for you are he I came to seek.\"    \"I am but a poor anchorite, a curtall friar,\" said the other, whistling  to his pack, \"by name Friar Tuck of Fountain's Dale. For seven years  have I tended the Abbey here, preached o' Sundays, and married and  christened and buried folk--and fought too, if need were; and if it  smacks not too much of boasting, I have not yet met the knight or  trooper or yeoman that I would yield before. But yours is a stout blade.  I would fain know you.\"    \"'Tis Robin Hood, the outlaw, who has been assisting you at this  christening,\" said Will Scarlet glancing roguishly at the two opponents'  dripping garments. And at this sally the whole bad burst into a shout of  laughter, in which Robin and Friar Tuck joined.    \"Robin Hood!\" cried the good friar presently, holding his sides; \"are  you indeed that famous yeoman? Then I like you well; and had I known you  earlier, would have both carried you across and shared my pasty pie with  you.\"    \"To speak soothly,\" replied Robin gaily, \"'twas that same pie that led  me to be rude. Now, therefore, bring it and your dogs and repair with us  to the greenwood. We have need of you--with this message came I to-day  to seek you. We will build you a hermitage in Sherwood Forest, and you  shall keep us from evil ways. Will you not join our band?\"    \"Marry, that will I!\" cried Friar Tuck jovially. \"Once more will I cross  this much beforded stream, and go with you to the good greenwood!\"          CHAPTER VIII    HOW ALLAN-A-DALE'S WOOING WAS PROSPERED         \"What is thy name?\" then said Robin Hood,       \"Come tell me, without any fail!\"       \"By the faith o' my body,\" then said the young man,       \"My name it is Allan-a-Dale.\"    Friar Tuck and Much the miller's son soon became right good friends over  the steaming stew they jointly prepared for the merry men that evening.  Tuck was mightily pleased when he found a man in the forest who could  make pasties and who had cooked for no less person than the High Sheriff  himself. While Much marveled at the friar's knowledge of herbs and  simples and woodland things which savored a stew greatly. So they  gabbled together like two old gossips and, between them, made such a  tasty mess that Robin Hood and his stout followers were like never to  leave off eating. And the friar said grace too, with great unction, over  the food; and Robin said Amen! and that henceforth they were always to  have mass of Sundays.    So Robin walked forth into the wood that evening with his stomach full  and his heart, therefore, in great contentment and love for other men.  He did not stop the first passer-by, as his manner often was, and desire  a fight. Instead, he stepped behind a tree, when he heard a man's voice  in song, and waited to behold the singer. Perhaps he remembered, also,  the merry chanting of Will Scarlet, and how he had tried to give it  pause a few days before.    Like Will, this fellow was clad in scarlet, though he did not look quite  as fine a gentleman. Nathless, he was a sturdy yeoman of honest face and  a voice far sweeter than Will's. He seemed to be a strolling minstrel,  for he bore a harp in his hand, which he thrummed, while his lusty tenor  voice rang out with--         \"Hey down, and a down, and a down!       I've a lassie back i' the town;       Come day, come night, Come dark or light,       She will wed me, back i' the town!\"    Robin let the singer pass, caroling on his way.    \"'Tis not in me to disturb a light-hearted lover, this night,\" he  muttered, a memory of Marian coming back to him. \"Pray heaven she may be  true to him and the wedding be a gay one 'back i' the town!\"'    So Robin went back to his camp, where he told of the minstrel.    \"If any of ye set on him after this,\" quoth he in ending, \"bring him to  me, for I would have speech with him.\"    The very next day his wish was gratified. Little John and Much the  miller's son were out together on a foraging expedition when they espied  the same young man; at least, they thought it must be he, for he was  clad in scarlet and carried a harp in his hand. But now he came drooping  along the way; his scarlet was all in tatters; and at every step he  fetched a sigh, \"Alack and a well-a-day!\"    Then stepped forth Little John and Much the miller's son.    \"Ho! do not wet the earth with your weeping,\" said Little John, \"else we  shall all have lumbago.\"    No sooner did the young man catch sight of them than he bent his bow,  and held an arrow back to his ear.    \"Stand off! stand off!\" he said; \"what is your will with me?\"    \"Put by your weapon,\" said Much, \"we will not harm you. But you must  come before our master straight, under yon greenwood tree.\"    So the minstrel put by his bow and suffered himself to be led before  Robin Hood.    \"How now!\" quoth Robin, when he beheld his sorry countenance, \"are you  not he whom I heard no longer ago than yesternight caroling so blithely  about 'a lassie back i' the town'?\"    \"The same"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/836"],[0,"The Phoenix and the Carpet (#11)"],[1,". The children knew that mother always WANTED to do what  was best for them, even if she was not clever enough to know exactly  what was the best. That was why all of them, but much more particularly  Anthea, felt rather uncomfortable at keeping the great secret from her  of the wishing carpet and the Phoenix. And Anthea, whose inside mind was  made so that she was able to be much more uncomfortable than the others,  had decided that she MUST tell her mother the truth, however little  likely it was that her mother would believe it.    'Then I shall have done what's right,' said she to the Phoenix; 'and if  she doesn't believe me it won't be my fault--will it?'    'Not in the least,' said the golden bird. 'And she won't, so you're  quite safe.'    Anthea chose a time when she was doing her home-lessons--they were  Algebra and Latin, German, English, and Euclid--and she asked her mother  whether she might come and do them in the drawing-room--'so as to be  quiet,' she said to her mother; and to herself she said, 'And that's not  the real reason. I hope I shan't grow up a LIAR.'    Mother said, 'Of course, dearie,' and Anthea started swimming through  a sea of x's and y's and z's. Mother was sitting at the mahogany bureau  writing letters.    'Mother dear,' said Anthea.    'Yes, love-a-duck,' said mother.    'About cook,' said Anthea. '_I_ know where she is.'    'Do you, dear?' said mother. 'Well, I wouldn't take her back after the  way she has behaved.'    'It's not her fault,' said Anthea. 'May I tell you about it from the  beginning?'    Mother laid down her pen, and her nice face had a resigned expression.  As you know, a resigned expression always makes you want not to tell  anybody anything.    'It's like this,' said Anthea, in a hurry: 'that egg, you know, that  came in the carpet; we put it in the fire and it hatched into the  Phoenix, and the carpet was a wishing carpet--and--'    'A very nice game, darling,' said mother, taking up her pen. 'Now do  be quiet. I've got a lot of letters to write. I'm going to Bournemouth  to-morrow with the Lamb--and there's that bazaar.'    Anthea went back to x y z, and mother's pen scratched busily.    'But, mother,' said Anthea, when mother put down the pen to lick an  envelope, 'the carpet takes us wherever we like--and--'    'I wish it would take you where you could get a few nice Eastern things  for my bazaar,' said mother. 'I promised them, and I've no time to go to  Liberty's now.'    'It shall,' said Anthea, 'but, mother--'    'Well, dear,' said mother, a little impatiently, for she had taken up  her pen again.    'The carpet took us to a place where you couldn't have whooping-cough,  and the Lamb hasn't whooped since, and we took cook because she was  so tiresome, and then she would stay and be queen of the savages. They  thought her cap was a crown, and--'    'Darling one,' said mother, 'you know I love to hear the things you make  up--but I am most awfully busy.'    'But it's true,' said Anthea, desperately.    'You shouldn't say that, my sweet,' said mother, gently. And then Anthea  knew it was hopeless.    'Are you going away for long?' asked Anthea.    'I've got a cold,' said mother, 'and daddy's anxious about it, and the  Lamb's cough.'    'He hasn't coughed since Saturday,' the Lamb's eldest sister  interrupted.    'I wish I could think so,' mother replied. 'And daddy's got to go to  Scotland. I do hope you'll be good children.'    'We will, we will,' said Anthea, fervently. 'When's the bazaar?'    'On Saturday,' said mother, 'at the schools. Oh, don't talk any more,  there's a treasure! My head's going round, and I've forgotten how to  spell whooping-cough.'      Mother and the Lamb went away, and father went away, and there was a new  cook who looked so like a frightened rabbit that no one had the heart to  do anything to frighten her any more than seemed natural to her.    The Phoenix begged to be excused. It said it wanted a week's rest, and  asked that it might not be disturbed. And it hid its golden gleaming  self, and nobody could find it.    So that when Wednesday afternoon brought an unexpected holiday, and  every one decided to go somewhere on the carpet, the journey had to  be undertaken without the Phoenix. They were debarred from any carpet  excursions in the evening by a sudden promise to mother, exacted in the  agitation of parting, that they would not be out after six at night,  except on Saturday, when they were to go to the bazaar, and were pledged  to put on their best clothes, to wash themselves to the uttermost, and  to clean their nails--not with scissors, which are scratchy and bad,  but with flat-sharpened ends of wooden matches, which do no harm to any  one's nails.    'Let's go and see the Lamb,' said Jane.    But every one was agreed that if they appeared suddenly in Bournemouth  it would frighten mother out of her wits, if not into a fit. So they  sat on the carpet, and thought and thought and thought till they almost  began to squint.    'Look here,' said Cyril, 'I know. Please carpet, take us somewhere where  we can see the Lamb and mother and no one can see us.'    'Except the Lamb,' said Jane, quickly.    And the next moment they found themselves recovering from the  upside-down movement--and there they were sitting on the carpet, and  the carpet was laid out over another thick soft carpet of brown  pine-needles. There were green pine-trees overhead, and a swift clear  little stream was running as fast as ever it could between steep  banks--and there, sitting on the pine-needle carpet, was mother, without  her hat; and the sun was shining brightly, although it was November--and  there was the Lamb, as jolly as jolly and not whooping at all.    'The carpet's deceived us,' said Robert, gloomily; 'mother will see us  directly she turns her head.'    But the faithful carpet had not deceived them.    Mother turned her dear head and looked straight at them, and DID NOT SEE  THEM!    'We're invisible,' Cyril whispered: 'what awful larks!'    But to the girls it was not larks at all. It was horrible to have mother  looking straight at them, and her face keeping the same, just as though  they weren't there.    'I don't like it,' said Jane. 'Mother never looked at us like that  before. Just as if she didn't love us--as if we were somebody else's  children, and not very nice ones either--as if she didn't care whether  she saw us or not.'    'It is horrid,' said Anthea, almost in tears.    But at this moment the Lamb saw them, and plunged towards the carpet,  shrieking, 'Panty, own Panty--an' Pussy, an' Squiggle--an' Bobs, oh,  oh!'    Anthea caught him and kissed him, so did Jane; they could not help  it--he looked such a darling, with his blue three-cornered hat all on  one side, and his precious face all dirty--quite in the old familiar  way.    'I love you, Panty; I love you--and you, and you, and you,' cried the  Lamb.    It was a delicious moment. Even the boys thumped their baby brother  joyously on the back.    Then Anthea glanced at mother--and mother's face was a pale sea-green  colour, and she was staring at the Lamb as if she thought he had gone  mad. And, indeed, that was exactly what she did think.    'My Lamb, my precious! Come to mother,' she cried, and jumped up and ran  to the baby.    She was so quick that the invisible children had to leap back, or she  would have felt them; and to feel what you can't see is the worst sort  of ghost-feeling. Mother picked up the Lamb and hurried away from the  pinewood.    'Let's go home,' said Jane, after a miserable silence. 'It feels just  exactly as if mother didn't love us.'    But they couldn't bear to go home till they had seen mother meet another  lady, and knew that she was safe. You cannot leave your mother to go  green in the face in a distant pinewood, far from all human aid, and  then go home on your wishing carpet as though nothing had happened.    When mother seemed safe the children returned to the carpet, and said  'Home'--and home they went.    'I don't care about being invisible myself,' said Cyril, 'at least, not  with my own family. It would be different if you were a prince, or a  bandit, or a burglar.'    And now the thoughts of all four dwelt fondly on the dear greenish face  of mother.    'I wish she hadn't gone away,' said Jane; 'the house is simply beastly  without her.'    'I think we ought to do what she said,' Anthea put in. 'I saw something  in a book the other day about the wishes of the departed being sacred.'    'That means when they've departed farther off,' said Cyril. 'India's  coral or Greenland's icy, don't you know; not Bournemouth. Besides, we  don't know what her wishes are.'    'She SAID'--Anthea was very much inclined to cry--'she said, \"Get Indian  things for my bazaar;\" but I know she thought we couldn't, and it was  only play.'    'Let's get them all the same,' said Robert. 'We'll go the first thing on  Saturday morning.'    And on Saturday morning, the first thing, they went.    There was no finding the Phoenix, so they sat on the beautiful wishing  carpet, and said--    'We want Indian things for mother's bazaar. Will you please take us  where people will give us heaps of Indian things?'    The docile carpet swirled their senses away, and restored them on the  outskirts of a gleaming white Indian town. They knew it was Indian at  once, by the shape of the domes and roofs; and besides, a man went by on  an elephant, and two English soldiers went along the road, talking like  in Mr Kipling's books--so after that no one could have any doubt as to  where they were. They rolled up the carpet and Robert carried it, and  they walked bodily into the town.    It was very warm, and once more they had to take off their  London-in-November coats, and carry them on their arms.    The streets were narrow and strange, and the clothes of the people in  the streets were stranger and the talk of the people was strangest of  all.    'I can't"]]]
