If the meat be very lean, put in a piece of butter, or such sweet  gravies as you may happen to have. Cover the top with crust, and put  it in the oven, or bake-kettle, to cook half an hour, or an hour,  according to the size of the pie. Some people think this the nicest  way of cooking fresh chickens. When thus cooked, they should be  parboiled before they are put into the pan, and the water they are  boiled in should be added. A chicken pie needs to be cooked an hour  and a half, if parboiled; two hours, if not.    If you wish to make a pot pie instead of a baked pie, you have only to  line the bottom of a porridge pot with paste, lay in your meat, season  and moisten it in the same way, cover it with paste, and keep it  slowly stewing about the same time that the other takes. In both  cases, it is well to lift the upper crust, a little while before you  take up the pie, and see whether the moisture has dried away; if so,  pour in flour and water well mixed, and let it boil up.    Potatoes should be boiled in a separate vessel.    If you have fear that poultry may become musty before you want to  cook it, skin an onion, and put in it; a little pepper sprinkled in is  good; it should be kept hung up in a dry, cool place.    If poultry is injured before you are aware of it, wash it very  thoroughly in pearlash and water, and sprinkle pepper inside when you  cook it. Some people hang up poultry with a muslin bag of charcoal  inside. It is a good plan to singe injured poultry over lighted  charcoal, and to hold a piece of lighted charcoal inside, a few  minutes.    Many people parboil the liver and gizzard, and cut it up very fine, to  be put into the gravy, while the fowls are cooking; in this case, the  water they are boiled in should be used to make the gravy.      FISH.    Cod has white stripes, and a haddock black stripes; they may be known  apart by this. Haddock is the best for frying; and cod is the best  for boiling, or for a chowder. A thin tail is a sign of a poor fish;  always choose a thick fish. When you are buying mackerel, pinch the  belly to ascertain whether it is good. If it gives under your finger,  like a bladder half filled with wind, the fish is poor; if it feels  hard like butter, the fish is good. It is cheaper to buy one large  mackerel for ninepence, than two for four pence half-penny each.    Fish should not be put in to fry until the fat is boiling hot; it is  very necessary to observe this. It should be dipped in Indian meal  before it is put in; and the skinny side uppermost, when first put  in, to prevent its breaking. It relishes better to be fried after salt  pork, than to be fried in lard alone. People are mistaken, who think  fresh fish should be put into cold water as soon as it is brought into  the house; soaking it in water is injurious. If you want to keep it  sweet, clean it, wash it, wipe it dry with a clean towel, sprinkle  salt inside and out, put it in a covered dish, and keep it on the  _cellar_ floor until you want to cook it. If you live remote from the  seaport, and cannot get fish while hard and fresh, wet it with an egg  beaten, before you meal it, to prevent its breaking.    Fish gravy is very much improved by taking out some of the fat, after  the fish is fried, and putting in a little butter. The fat thus taken  out will do to fry fish again; but it will not do for any kind of  shortening. Shake in a little flour into the hot fat, and pour in a  little boiling water; stir it up well, as it boils, a minute or so.  Some people put in vinegar; but this is easily added by those who like  it.    A common sized cod-fish should be put in when the water is boiling  hot, and boil about twenty minutes. Haddock is not as good for boiling  as cod; it takes about the same time to boil.    A piece of halibut which weighs four pounds is a large dinner for a  family of six or seven. It should boil forty minutes. No fish put in  till the water boils. Melted butter for sauce.    Clams should boil about fifteen minutes in their own water; no other  need be added, except a spoonful to keep the bottom shells from  burning. It is easy to tell when they are done, by the shells starting  wide open. After they are done, they should be taken from the shells,  washed thoroughly in their own water, and put in a stewing pan. The  water should then be strained through a cloth, so as to get out all  the grit; the clams should be simmered in it ten or fifteen minutes;  a little thickening of flour and water added; half a dozen slices  of toasted bread or cracker; and pepper, vinegar and butter to your  taste. Salt is not needed.    Four pounds of fish are enough to make a chowder for four or five  people; half a dozen slices of salt pork in the bottom of the pot;  hang it high, so that the pork may not burn; take it out when done  very brown; put in a layer of fish, cut in lengthwise slices, then a  layer formed of crackers, small or sliced onions, and potatoes sliced  as thin as a four-pence, mixed with pieces of pork you have fried;  then a layer of fish again, and so on. Six crackers are enough.  Strew a little salt and pepper over each layer; over the whole pour a  bowl-full of flour and water, enough to come up even with the surface  of what you have in the pot. A sliced lemon adds to the flavor. A cup  of tomato catsup is very excellent. Some people put in a cup of beer.  A few clams are a pleasant addition. It should be covered so as not  to let a particle of steam escape, if possible. Do not open it, except  when nearly done, to taste if it be well seasoned.    Salt fish should be put in a deep plate, with just water enough to  cover it, the night before you intend to cook it. It should not be  boiled an instant; boiling renders it hard. It should lie in scalding  hot water two or three hours. The less water is used, and the more  fish is cooked at once, the better. Water thickened with flour and  water while boiling, with sweet butter put in to melt, is the common  sauce. It is more economical to cut salt pork into small bits, and try  it till the pork is brown and crispy. It should not be done too fast,  lest the sweetness be scorched out.    Salted shad and mackerel should be put into a deep plate and covered  with boiling water for about ten minutes after it is thoroughly  broiled, before it is buttered. This makes it tender, takes off  the coat of salt, and prevents the strong oily taste, so apt to be  unpleasant in preserved fish. The same rule applies to smoked salmon.    Salt fish mashed with potatoes, with good butter or pork scraps to  moisten it, is nicer the second day than it was the first. The fish  should be minced very fine, while it is warm. After it has got cold  and dry, it is difficult to do it nicely. Salt fish needs plenty of  vegetables, such as onions, beets, carrots, &c.    There is no way of preparing salt fish for breakfast, so nice as to  roll it up in little balls, after it is mixed with mashed potatoes;  dip it into an egg, and fry it brown.    A female lobster is not considered so good as a male. In the female,  the sides of the head, or what look like cheeks, are much larger,  and jut out more than those of the male. The end of a lobster is  surrounded with what children call 'purses,' edged with a little  fringe. If you put your hand under these to raise it, and find it  springs back hard and firm, it is a sign the lobster is fresh; if  they move flabbily, it is not a good omen.    Fried salt pork and apples is a favorite dish in the country; but it  is seldom seen in the city. After the pork is fried, some of the  fat should be taken out, lest the apples should be oily. Acid apples  should be chosen, because they cook more easily; they should be cut in  slices, across the whole apple, about twice or three times as thick as  a new dollar. Fried till tender, and brown on both sides--laid around  the pork. If you have cold potatoes, slice them and brown them in the  same way.           *       *       *       *       *          PUDDINGS.      BAKED INDIAN PUDDING.    Indian pudding is good baked. Scald a quart of milk (skimmed milk  will do,) and stir in seven table spoonfuls of sifted Indian meal, a  tea-spoonful of salt, a tea-cupful of molasses, and a great spoonful  of ginger, or sifted cinnamon. Baked three or four hours. If you want  whey, you must be sure and pour in a little cold milk, after it is all  mixed.      BOILED INDIAN PUDDING.    Indian pudding should be boiled four or five hours. Sifted Indian meal  and warm milk should be stirred together pretty stiff. A little salt,  and two or three great spoonfuls of molasses, added; a spoonful of  ginger, if you like that spice. Boil it in a tight covered pan, or a  very thick cloth; if the water gets in, it will ruin it. Leave plenty  of room; for Indian swells very much. The milk with which you mix it  should be merely warm; if it be scalding, the pudding will break to  pieces. Some people chop sweet suet fine, and warm in the milk; others  warm thin slices of sweet apple to be stirred into the pudding. Water  will answer instead of milk.      FLOUR OR BATTER PUDDING.    Common flour pudding, or batter pudding, is easily made. Those who  live in the country can beat up five or six eggs with a quart of milk,  and a little salt, with flour enough to make it just thick enough to  pour without difficulty. Those who live in the city, and are obliged  to buy eggs, can do with three eggs to a quart, and more flour in  proportion. Boil about three quarters of an hour.      BREAD PUDDING.    A nice pudding may be made of bits of bread. They should be crumbled  and soaked in milk over night. In the morning, beat up three eggs  with it, add a little salt, tie it up in a bag, or in a pan that will  exclude every drop of water, and boil it little more than an hour.  No puddings should be put into the pot, till the water"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13499"],[0,"Two Little Savages (#12)"],[1," romance and picturesqueness, and  Sam consented to \"try it for awhile, anyhow.\" And now came the point  of Yan's argument. \"Injuns don't live in shanties; they live in  teepees. Why not make a teepee instead?\"    \"That would be just bully,\" said Sam, who had seen pictures enough to  need no description, \"but what are we to make it of?\"    \"Well,\" answered Yan, promptly assuming the leadership and rejoicing  in his ability to speak as an authority, \"the Plains Injuns make their  teepees of skins, but the wood Injuns generally use Birch bark.\"    \"Well, I bet you can't find skins or Birch bark enough in this woods  to make a teepee big enough for a Chipmunk to chaw nuts in.\"    \"We can use Elm bark.\"    \"That's a heap easier,\" replied Sam, \"if it'll answer, coz we cut a  lot o' Elm logs last winter and the bark'll be about willin' to peel  now. But first let's plan it out.\"    This was a good move, one Yan would have overlooked. He would probably  have got a lot of material together and made the plan afterward, but  Sam had been taught to go about his work with method.    So Yan sketched on a smooth log his remembrance of an Indian teepee.  \"It seems to me it was about this shape, with the poles sticking up  like that, a hole for the smoke here and another for the door there.\"    \"Sounds like you hain't never seen one,\" remarked Sam, with more point  than politeness, \"but we kin try it. Now 'bout how big?\"    Eight feet high and eight feet across was decided to be about right.  Four poles, each ten feet long, were cut in a few minutes, Yan  carrying them to a smooth place above the creek as fast as Sam cut  them.    \"Now, what shall we tie them with?\" said Yan.    \"You mean for rope?\"    \"Yes, only we must get everything in the woods; real rope ain't  allowed.\"    \"I kin fix that,\" said Sam; \"when Da double-staked the orchard fence,  he lashed every pair of stakes at the top with Willow withes.\"    \"That's so--I quite forgot,\" said Yan. In a few minutes they were  at work trying to tie the four poles together with slippery stiff  Willows, but it was no easy matter. They had to be perfectly tight or  they would slip and fall in a heap each time they were raised, and it  seemed at length that the boys would be forced to the impropriety of  using hay wire, when they heard a low grunt, and turning, saw William  Raften standing with his hands behind him as though he had watched  them for hours.    The boys were no little startled. Raften had a knack of turning up at  any point when something was going on, taking in the situation fully,  and then, if he disapproved, of expressing himself in a few words of  blistering mockery delivered in a rich Irish brogue. Just what view  he would take of their pastime the boys had no idea, but awaited with  uneasiness. If they had been wasting time when they should have been  working there is no question but that they would have been sent with  contumely to more profitable pursuits, but this was within their  rightful play hours, and Raften, after regarding them with a searching  look, said slowly: \"Bhoys!\" (Sam felt easier; his father would have  said \"_Bhise_\" if really angry.) \"Fhat's the good o' wastin' yer  time\" (Yan's heart sank) \"wid Willow withes fur a job like that? They  can't be made to howld. Whoi don't ye git some hay woire or coord at  the barrun?\"    The boys were greatly relieved, but still this friendly overture might  be merely a feint to open the way for a home thrust. Sam was silent.  So Yan said, presently, \"We ain't allowed to use anything but what the  Indians had or could get in the woods.\"    \"An' who don't allow yez?\"    \"The rules.\"    \"Oh,\" said William, with some amusement. \"Oi see! Hyar.\"    He went into the woods looking this way and that, and presently  stopped at a lot of low shrubs.    \"Do ye know what this is, Yan?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"Le's see if yer man enough to break it aff.\"    Yan tried. The wood was brittle enough, but the bark, thin, smooth and  pliant, was as tough as leather, and even a narrow strip defied his  strength.    \"That's Litherwood,\" said Raften. \"That's what the Injuns used; that's  what we used ourselves in the airly days of this yer settlement.\"    The boys had looked for a rebuke, and here was a helping hand. It all  turned on the fact that this was \"play hours,\" Raften left with a  parting word: \"In wan hour an' a half the pigs is fed.\"    \"You see Da's all right when the work ain't forgot,\" said Sam, with  a patronizing air. \"I wonder why I didn't think o' that there  Leatherwood meself. I've often heard that that's what was used fur  tying bags in the old days when cord was scarce, an' the Injuns used  it for tying their prisoners, too. Ain't it the real stuff?\"    Several strips were now used for tying four poles together at the top,  then these four were raised on end and spread out at the bottom to  serve as the frame of the teepee, or more properly wigwam, since it  was to be made of bark.    After consulting, they now got a long, limber Willow rod an inch  thick, and bending it around like a hoop, they tied it with  Leatherwood to each pole at a point four feet from the ground. Next  they cut four short poles to reach from the ground to this. These were  lashed at their upper ends to the Willow rod, and now they were ready  for the bark slabs. The boys went to the Elm logs and again Sam's able  use of the axe came in. He cut the bark open along the top of one log,  and by using the edge of the axe and some wooden wedges they pried off  a great roll eight feet long and four feet across. It was a pleasant  surprise to see what a wide piece of bark the small log gave them.    Three logs yielded three fine large slabs and others yielded pieces of  various sizes. The large ones were set up against the frame so as to  make the most of them. Of course they were much too big for the top,  and much too narrow for the bottom; but the little pieces would do to  patch if some way could be found to make them stick.    Sam suggested nailing them to the posts, and Yan was horrified at the  idea of using nails. \"No Indian has any nails.\"    \"Well, what _would_ they use?\" said Sam.    \"They used thongs, an'--an'--maybe wooden pegs. I don't know, but  seems to me that would be all right.\"    \"But them poles is hard wood,\" objected the practical Sam. \"You can  drive Oak pegs into Pine, but you can't drive wooden pegs into hard  wood without you make some sort of a hole first. Maybe I'd better  bring a gimlet.\"    \"Now, Sam, you might just as well hire a carpenter--_that_  wouldn't be Indian at all. Let's play it right. We'll find some way. I  believe we can tie them up with Leatherwood.\"    So Sam made a sharp Oak pick with his axe, and Yan used it to pick  holes in each piece of bark and then did a sort of rude sewing till  the wigwam seemed beautifully covered in. But when they went inside  to look they were unpleasantly surprised to find how many holes  there were. It was impossible to close them all because the bark was  cracking in so many places, but the boys plugged the worst of them and  then prepared for the great sacred ceremony--the lighting of the fire  in the middle.    They gathered a lot of dry fuel, then Yan produced a match.    \"That don't look to me very Injun,\" drawled Sam critically. \"I don't  think Injuns has matches.\"    \"Well, they don't,\" admitted Yan, humbly. \"But I haven't a flint and  steel, and don't know how to work rubbing-sticks, so we just got to  use matches, _if_ we _want_ a fire.\"    \"Why, of course we want a fire. I ain't kicking,\" said Sam. \"Go ahead  with your old leg-fire sulphur stick. A camp without a fire would be  'bout like last year's bird's nest or a house with the roof off.\"    Yan struck a match and put it to the wood. It went out. He struck  another--same result. Yet another went out.    Sam remarked:    \"Pears to me you don't know much about lightin' a fire. Lemme show  you. Let the White hunter learn the Injun somethin' about the woods,\"  said he with a leer.    Sam took the axe and cut some sticks of a dry Pine root. Then with his  knife he cut long curling shavings, which he left sticking in a fuzz  at the end of each stick.    \"Oh, I've seen a picture of an Indian making them. They call them  'prayer-sticks,'\" said Yan.    \"Well, prayer-sticks is mighty good kindlin'\" replied the other. He  struck a match, and in a minute he had a blazing fire in the middle of  the wigwam.    \"Old Granny de Neuville, she's a witch--she knows all about the woods,  and cracked Jimmy turns everything into poetry what she says. He says  she says when you want to make a fire in the woods you take--      \"First a curl of Birch bark as dry as it kin be,    Then some twigs of soft-wood, dead, but on the tree,    Last o' all some Pine knots to make the kittle foam,    An' thar's a fire to make you think you're settin' right at home.\"    \"Who's Granny de Neuville?\"    \"Oh, she's the old witch that lives down at the bend o' the creek.\"    \"What? Has she got a granddaughter named Biddy?\" said Yan, suddenly  remembering that his ancient ally came from this part of Sanger.    \"Oh, my! Hain't she? Ain't Biddy a peach--drinks like a fish, talks  everybody to death about the time she resided in Bonnerton. Gits a  letter every mail begging her to come back and 'reside' with them some  more.\"    \"Ain't this fine,\" said Yan, as he sat on a pile of Fir boughs in the  wigwam.    \"Looks like the real thing,\" replied Sam from his seat on the other  side. \"But say, Yan, don't make any more fire; it's kind o' warm here,  an' there seems to be something wrong with that flue--wants sweepin',  prob'ly--hain't been swep' since I kin remember.\"    The fire blazed up and the smoke increased. Just a little of it  wandered out of the smoke-hole at the top, then it decided that this  was a mistake and thereafter positively declined to use the vent. Some  of it went out by chinks, and a large stream issued from the door, but  by"]]]
