Tom's hope was that this big blast would show such pressure in  foot-tons, and give such muzzle velocity to the projectile, and at the  same time such penetrating power, that he would be justified in taking  it as the basis of his explosive, and using it in the big gun he  intended to make.    The preliminaries had been completed. The special steel tube had been  constructed, and mounted on a heavy carriage in a distant part of the  Swift grounds. A section of armor plate, a foot and a half in  thickness, had been set up at the proper distance. A new projectile,  with a hard, penetrating point, had been made--a sort of miniature of  the one Tom hoped to use in his giant cannon.    Now the young inventor and his friends were on their way to the scene  of the test, taking the powder and other necessaries, including the  primers, with them. Tom, Ned and Mr. Damon had some of the gauges to  register the energy expended by the improvised cannon. There were  charts to be filled in, and other details to be looked after.    \"So General Waller won't be here?\" remarked Ned, as they walked along,  Tom keeping a watchful eye on Koku.    \"No,\" was the reply. \"He has gone back to Sandy Hook. He wrote that his  health was better, and that he wanted to resume work on a new type of  gun.\"    \"I guess he's afraid you'll beat him out, Tom,\" laughed Ned.  \"You take  my advice, and look out for General Waller.\"    \"Nonsense! I say, Rad! Look out with those primers!\"    \"I'se lookin' out, Massa Tom. Golly, I don't laik dis yeah job at all!  I--I guess I'd better be gittin' at dat whitewashin', Massa Tom. Dat  back fence suah needs a coat mighty bad.\"    \"Never you mind about the whitewashing, Rad. You just stick around here  for a while. I may need you to sit on the cannon to hold it down.\"    \"Sit on a cannon, Massa Tom! Say, looky heah now! You jest take dese  primary things from dish yeah coon. I--I'se got t' go!\"    \"Why, what's the matter, Rad? Surely you're not afraid; are you?\" and  Tom winked at Ned.    \"No, Massa Tom, I'se not prezactly 'skeered, but I done jest 'membered  dat I didn't gib mah mule Boomerang any oats t'day, an' he's suahly  gwine t' be desprit mad at me fo' forgettin' dat. I--I'd better go!\"    \"Nonsense, Rad! I was only fooling. You can go as soon as we get to my  private proving grounds, if you like. But you'll have to carry those  primers, for all the rest of us have our hands full. Only be careful of  'em!\"    \"I--I will, Massa Tom.\"    They kept on, and it was noticed that Mr. Damon gave nervous glances  from time to time in the direction of Koku, who was carrying the box of  powder. The giant himself, however, did not seem to know the meaning of  fear. He carried the box, which contained enough explosive to blow them  all into fragments, with as much composure as though it contained  loaves of bread.    \"Now you can go, Rad,\" announced Tom, when they reached the lonely  field where, pointing toward a big hill, was the little cannon.    \"Good, Massa Tom!\" cried the colored man, and from the way in which he  hurried off no one would ever suspect him of having rheumatic joints.    \"Say, that stuff looks just like Swiss cheese,\" remarked Ned, as Tom  opened the box of explosive. It would be incorrect to call it powder,  for it had no more the appearance of gunpowder, or any other \"powder,\"  than, as Ned said, swiss cheese.    And, indeed, the powerful stuff bore a decided resemblance to that  peculiar product of the dairy. It was in thin sheets, with holes  pierced through it here and there, irregularly.    \"The idea is,\" Tom explained, \"to make a quick-burning explosive. I  want the concussion to be scattered through it all at once. It is set  off by concussion, you see,\" he went on. \"A sort of cartridge is buried  in the middle of it, after it has been inserted in the cannon breech.  The cartridge is exploded by a primer, which responds to an electric  current. The thin plates, with holes corresponding to the centre hole  in a big grain of the hexagonal powder, will, I hope, cause the stuff  to burn quickly, and give a tremendous pressure. Now we'll put some in  the steel tube, and see what happens.\"    Even Tom was a little nervous as he prepared for this latest test. But  he was not nervous enough to drop any of those queer, cheese-like  slabs. For, though he knew that a considerable percussion was needed to  set them off, it would not do to take chances. High explosives do not  always act alike, even under the same given conditions. What might with  perfect safety be done at one time, could not be repeated at another.  Tom knew this, and was very careful.    The powder, as I shall occasionally call it for the sake of  convenience, though it was not such in the strict sense of the  word--the powder was put in the small cannon, together with the primer.  Then the wires were attached to it, and extended off for some distance.    \"But we won't attach the battery until the last moment,\" Tom said. \"I  don't want a premature explosion.\"    The projectile was also put in, and Tom once more looked to see that  the armor plate was in place. Then he adjusted the various gauges to  get readings of the power and energy created by his new explosive.    \"Well, I guess we're all ready,\" he announced to his friends.  \"I'll  hook on the battery now, and we'll get off behind that other hill. I  had Koku make a sort of cave there--a miniature bomb-proof, that will  shelter us.\"    \"Do you think the blast will be powerful enough to make it necessary?\"  asked Mr. Damon.    \"It will, if this larger quantity of explosive acts anything like the  small samples I set off,\" replied the young inventor.    The electric wires were carried behind the protecting hill, whither  they all retired.    \"Here she goes!\" exclaimed Tom, after a pause.    His thumb pressed the electric button, and instantly the ground shook  with the tremor of a mighty blast, while a deafening sound reared about  them. The earth trembled, and there was a big sheet of flame, seen even  in the powerful sunlight.    \"Something happened, anyhow!\" yelled Tom above the reverberating echoes.          CHAPTER XIII    CASTING THE CANNON      \"Come on!\" yelled Ned. \"We'll see how this experiment came out!\" and he  started to run from beneath the shelter of the hill.    \"Hold on!\" shouted Tom, laying a restraining hand on his chum's  shoulder.    \"Why, what's the matter?\" asked Ned in surprise.    \"Some of that powder may not have exploded,\" went on the young  inventor. \"From the sound made I should say the gun burst, and, if it  did, that gelatin is bound to be scattered about. There may be a mass  of it burning loose somewhere, and it may go off. It ought not to, if  my theory about it being harmless in the open is correct, but the  trouble is that it's only a theory. Wait a few seconds.\"    Anxiously they lingered, the echoes of the blast still in their ears,  and a peculiar smell in their nostrils.    \"But there's no smoke,\" said Mr. Damon. \"Bless my spyglass! I always  thought there was smoke at an explosion.\"    \"This is a sort of smokeless powder,\" explained Tom. \"It throws off a  slight vapor when it is ignited, but not much. I guess it's safe to go  out now. Come on!\"    He dropped the pushbutton connected with the igniting battery, and,  followed by the others, raced to the scene of the experiment. A curious  sight met their eyes.    A great hole had been torn in the hillside, and another where the  improvised gun had stood. The gun itself seemed to have disappeared.    \"Why--why--where is it?\" asked Ned.    \"Burst to pieces I guess,\" replied Tom. \"I was afraid that charge was a  bit too heavy.\"    \"No, here it is!\" shouted Mr. Damon, circling off to one side.  \"It's  been torn from the carriage, and partly buried in the ground,\" and he  indicated a third excavation in the earth.    It was as he had said. The terrific blast had sheared the gun from its  temporary carriage, thrown it into the air, and it had come down to  bury itself in the soft ground. The carriage had torn loose from the  concrete base, and was tossed off in another direction.    \"Is the gun shattered?\" asked Tom, anxious to know how the weapon had  fared. It was, in a sense, a sort of small model of the giant cannon he  intended to have cast.    \"The breech is cracked a little,\" answered Mr. Damon, who was examining  it; \"but otherwise it doesn't seem to be much damaged.\"    \"Good,\" cried Tom. \"Another steel jacket will remedy that defect.  I  guess I'm on the right road at last. But now to see what became of that  armor plate.\"    \"Dinner plate not here,\" spoke Koku, who could not understand how there  could be two kind of plates in the world. \"Dinner plate gone, but big  hole here, and he indicated one in the side of the hill.    \"I expect that is where the armor plate is,\" said Tom, trying not to  laugh at the mistake of his giant servant. \"Take a look in there, Koku,  and, if you can get hold of it, pull it out for us.  I'm afraid the  piece of nickel-steel armor proved too much for my projectile. But  we'll have a look.\"    Koku disappeared into the miniature cave that had been torn in the side  of the bill. It was barely large enough to allow him to go in. But Tom  knew none other of them could hope to loosen the piece of steel,  imbedded as it must be in the solid earth.    Presently they heard Koku grunting and groaning. He seemed to be having  quite a struggle.    \"Can you get it, Koku?\" asked Tom. \"Or shall I send for picks and  shovels.\"    \"Me get, Master,\" was the muffled answer.    Then came a shout, as though in anger Koku had dared the buried plate  to defy him. There was a shower of earth at the mouth of the cave, and  the giant staggered out with the heavy piece of armor plate. At the  sight of it Tom uttered a cry.    \"Look!\" he shouted. \"My projectile went part way through and then  carried the plate with it into the side of the hill.

In old English manuals of midwifery, even in the      early nineteenth century, we still find much insistence on the      demands of modesty. Thus, Dr. John Burns, of Glasgow, in his      _Principles of Midwifery_, states that \"some women, from motives      of false delicacy, are averse from examination until the pains      become severe.\" He adds that \"it is usual for the room to be      darkened, and the bed-curtains drawn close, during an      examination.\" Many old pictures show the accoucheur groping in      the dark, beneath the bed-clothes, to perform operations on women      in childbirth. (A. Kind, \"Das Weib als Gebaererin in der Kunst,\"      _Geschlecht und Gesellschaft_, Bd. II, Heft 5, p. 203.)        In Iceland, Winkler stated in 1861 that he sometimes slept in the      same room as a whole family; \"it is often the custom for ten or      more persons to use the same room for living in and sleeping,      young and old, master and servant, male and female, and from      motives of economy, all the clothes, without exception, are      removed.\" (G. Winkler, _Island; seine Bewohner_, etc., pp. 107,      110.)        \"At Cork,\" saye Fynes Moryson, in 1617, \"I have seen with these      eyes young maids stark naked grinding corn with certain stones to      make cakes thereof.\" (Moryson, _Itinerary_, Part 3, Book III,      Chapter V.)        \"In the more remote parts of Ireland,\" Moryson elsewhere says,      where the English laws and manners are unknown, \"the very chief      of the Irish, men as well as women, go naked in very winter-time,      only having their privy parts covered with a rag of linen, and      their bodies with a loose mantle. This I speak of my own      experience.\" He goes on to tell of a Bohemian baron, just come      from the North of Ireland, who \"told me in great earnestness that      he, coming to the house of Ocane, a great lord among them, was      met at the door with sixteen women, all naked, excepting their      loose mantles; whereof eight or ten were very fair, and two      seemed very nymphs, with which strange sight, his eyes being      dazzled, they led him into the house, and then sitting down by      the fire with crossed legs, like tailors, and so low as could not      but offend chaste eyes, desired him to sit down with them. Soon      after, Ocane, the lord of the country, came in, all naked      excepting a loose mantle, and shoes, which he put off as soon as      he came in, and entertaining the baron after his best manner in      the Latin tongue, desired him to put off his apparel, which he      thought to be a burthen to him, and to sit naked by the fire with      this naked company. But the baron... for shame, durst not put off      his apparel.\" (Ib. Part 3, Book IV, Chapter II.)        Coryat, when traveling in Italy in the early part of the      seventeenth century, found that in Lombardy many of the women      and children wore only smocks, or shirts, in the hot weather. At      Venice and Padua, he found that wives, widows, and maids, walk      with naked breasts, many with backs also naked, almost to the      middle. (Coryat, _Crudities_, 1611. The fashion of _decollete_      garments, it may be remarked, only began in the fourteenth      century; previously, the women of Europe generally covered      themselves up to the neck.)        In Northern Italy, some years ago, a fire occurred at night in a      house in which two girls were sleeping, naked, according to the      custom. One threw herself out and was saved, the other returned      for a garment, and was burnt to death. The narrator of the      incident [a man] expressed strong approval of the more modest      girl's action. (Private communication.) It may be added that the      custom of sleeping naked is still preserved, also (according to      Lippert and Stratz), in Jutland, in Iceland, in some parts of      Norway, and sometimes even in Berlin.        Lady Mary Wortley Montague writes in 1717, of the Turkish ladies      at the baths at Sophia: \"The first sofas were covered with      cushions and rich carpets, on which sat the ladies, and on the      second, their slaves behind them, but without any distinction of      rank in their dress, all being in a state of Nature; that is, in      plain English, stark naked, without any beauty or defect      concealed. Yet there was not the least wanton smile or immodest      gesture among them. They walked and moved with the same majestic      grace which Milton describes of our general mother. I am here      convinced of the truth of a reflection I had often made, that if      it was the fashion to go naked, the face would be hardly      observed.\" (_Letters and Works_, 1866, vol. i, p. 285.)        At St. Petersburg, in 1774, Sir Nicholas Wraxall observed \"the      promiscuous bathing of not less than two hundred persons, of both      sexes. There are several of these public bagnios,\" he adds, \"in      Petersburg, and every one pays a few copecks for admittance.      There are, indeed, separate spaces for the men and women, but      they seem quite regardless of this distinction, and sit or bathe      in a state of absolute nudity among each other.\" (Sir N. Wraxall,      _A Tour Through Some of the Northern Parts of Europe_, 3d ed.,      1776, p. 248.) It is still usual for women in the country parts      of Russia to bathe naked in the streams.        In 1790, Wedgwood wrote to Flaxman: \"The nude is so general in      the work of the ancients, that it will be very difficult to avoid      the introduction of naked figures. On the other hand, it is      absolutely necessary to do so, or to keep the pieces for our own      use; for none, either male or female, of the present generation      will take or apply them as furniture if the figures are naked.\"      (Meteyard, _Life of Wedgwood_, vol. ii, p. 589.)        Mary Wollstonecraft quotes (for reprobation and not for      approval) the following remarks: \"The lady who asked the      question whether women may be instructed in the modern system of      botany, was accused of ridiculous prudery; nevertheless, if she      had proposed the question to me, I should certainly have      answered: 'They cannot!'\" She further quotes from an educational      book: \"It would be needless to caution you against putting your      hand, by chance, under your neck-handkerchief; for a modest woman      never did so.\" (Mary Wollstonecraft, _The Rights of Woman_, 1792,      pp. 277, 289.)        At the present time a knowledge of the physiology of plants is      not usually considered inconsistent with modesty, but a knowledge      of animal physiology is still so considered by many. Dr. H.R.      Hopkins, of New York, wrote in 1895, regarding the teaching of      physiology: \"How can we teach growing girls the functions of the      various parts of the human body, and still leave them their      modesty? That is the practical question that has puzzled me for      years.\"        In England, the use of drawers was almost unknown among women      half a century ago, and was considered immodest and unfeminine.      Tilt, a distinguished gynecologist of that period, advocated such      garments, made of fine calico, and not to descend below the knee,      on hygienic grounds. \"Thus understood,\" he added, \"the adoption      of drawers will doubtless become more general in this country,      as, being worn without the knowledge of the general observer,      they will be robbed of the prejudice usually attached to an      appendage deemed masculine.\" (Tilt, _Elements of Health_, 1852,      p. 193.) Drawers came into general use among women during the      third quarter of the nineteenth century.        Drawers are an Oriental garment, and seem to have reached Europe      through Venice, the great channel of communication with the East.      Like many other refinements of decency and cleanliness, they were      at first chiefly cultivated by prostitutes, and, on this account,      there was long a prejudice against them. Even at the present day,      it is said that in France, a young peasant girl will exclaim, if      asked whether she wears drawers: \"I wear drawers, Madame? A      respectable girl!\" Drawers, however, quickly became acclimatized      in France, and Dufour (op. cit., vol. vi, p. 28) even regards      them as essentially a French garment. They were introduced at the      Court towards the end of the fourteenth century, and in the      sixteenth century were rendered almost necessary by the new      fashion of the _vertugale_, or farthingale. In 1615, a lady's      _calecons_ are referred to as apparently an ordinary garment. It      is noteworthy that in London, in the middle of the same century,      young Mrs. Pepys, who was the daughter of French parents, usually      wore drawers, which were seemingly of the closed kind. (_Diary_      of S. Pepys, ed. Wheatley, May 15, 1663, vol. iii.) They were      probably not worn by Englishwomen, and even in France, with the      decay of the farthingale, they seem to have dropped out of use      during the seventeenth century. In a technical and very complete      book, _L'Art de la Lingerie_, published in 1771, women's drawers      are not even mentioned, and Mercier (_Tableau de Paris_, 1783,      vol. vii, p. 54) says that, except actresses, Parisian women do      not wear drawers. Even by ballet dancers and actresses on the      stage, they were not invariably worn. Camargo, the famous dancer,      who first shortened the skirt in dancing, early in the eighteenth      century, always observed great decorum, never showing the leg      above the knee; when appealed to as to whether she wore drawers,      she replied that she could not possibly appear without such a      \"precaution.\" But they were not necessarily worn by dancers, and      in 1727 a young _ballerina_, having had her skirt"]]]
