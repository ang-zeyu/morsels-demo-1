Having  spent sixteen years there, he had acquired an intimate knowledge of  Africa and its languages. He was sent by way of Tripoli, with  instructions to accompany the caravan, which takes the most direct  route into the interior. Being provided with letters from the  Tripolitan ambassador, he obtained the Bey's permission, and even  promises of assistance for this expedition. At the same time he made  an arrangement with two sheerefs or descendants of the Prophet, whose  persons are held sacred, to join a caravan with which they intended  to travel. He proceeded with them to Mesuraba, but the Arabs there  being in a state of rebellion, refused to furnish camels and guides,  which, indeed, could scarcely be expected, as the Bey had declined to  grant them a safe conduct through his territories. Mr. Lucas was  therefore obliged to return to Tripoli, without being able to  penetrate further into the continent. He learned, however, from  Imhammed, one of the sheerefs, who had been an extensive traveller, a  variety of particulars respecting the interior regions. The society  had, at the same time, made very particular inquiries of Ben Ali, a  Morocco caravan trader, who happened to be in London. From these two  sources, Mr. Beaufoy was enabled to draw up a view of Centra. Africa,  very imperfect, indeed, yet superior to any that had ever before  appeared.    According to the information thus obtained, Bornou and Kashna were  the most powerful states in that part of the continent, and formed  even empires, holding sway over a number of tributary kingdoms, a  statement which proved at that time to be correct, though affairs  have since greatly changed. The Kashna caravan often crossed the  Niger, and went onwards to great kingdoms behind the Gold Coast,  Gongah or Kong, Asiente or Ashantee, Yarba or Yarriba, through which  Clapperton afterwards travelled. Several extensive routes across the  desert were also delineated. In regard to the Niger, the report of  Imhammed revived the error, which represented that river as flowing  westward towards the Atlantic. The reason on which this opinion was  founded, will be evident, when we observe that it was in Kashna, that  Ben Ali considered himself as having crossed that river. His Niger,  therefore, was the Quarrama, or river of Zermie, which flows westward  through Kashna and Sackatoo, and is only a tributary to the Quorra or  great river, which we call the Niger. He describes the stream as very  broad and rapid, probably from having seen it during the rainy  season, when all the tropical rivers of any magnitude assume an  imposing appearance.    Mr. Lucas made no further attempt to penetrate into Africa. The next  expedition was made by a new agent, and from a different route. Major  Houghton, who had resided for some years as consul at Morocco, and  afterwards in a military capacity at Goree, undertook the attempt to  reach the Niger by the route of Gambia, not, like Jobson and Stibbs,  ascending its stream in boats, but travelling singly and by land. He  seems to have been endowed with a gay, active, and sanguine spirit,  fitted to carry him through the boldest undertaking, but without that  cool and calculating temper necessary for him, who endeavours to make  his way amid scenes of peril and treachery. He began his journey  early in 1791, and soon reached Medina, the capital of Woolli, where  the venerable chief received him with extreme kindness, promised to  furnish guides, and assured him he might go to Timbuctoo with his  staff in his hand. The only evil that befell him at Medina, arose  from a fire that broke out there, and spreading rapidly through  buildings roofed with cane and matted grass, converted a town of a  thousand houses, in an hour, into a heap of ashes. Major Houghton ran  out with the rest of the people into the fields, saving only such  articles as could be carried with him.    He mentions, that by trading at Fattatenda, a person may make 800 per  cent, and may live in plenty on ten pounds a year. Quitting the  Gambia, he took the road through Bambouk, and arrived at Ferbanna on  the Faleme. Here he was received with the most extraordinary kindness  by the king, who gave him a guide and money to defray his expenses. A  note was afterwards received from him, dated Simbing, which contained  merely these words: \"Major Houghton's compliments to Dr. Laidley, is  in good health on his way to Timbuctoo; robbed of all his goods by  Fenda, Bucar's son.\" This was the last communication from him, for  soon after the negroes brought down to Pisania, the melancholy  tidings of his death, of which Mr. Park subsequently learned the  particulars. Some moors had persuaded the major to accompany them to  Tisheet, a place in the great desert, frequented on account of its  salt mines. In alluring him thither, their object, as it appears from  the result, was to rob him, for it was very much out of the direct  route to Timbuctoo. Of this in a few days he became sensible, and  insisted upon returning, but they would not permit him to leave their  party, until they had stripped him of every article in his  possession. He wandered about for some time through the desert,  without food or shelter, till at length quite exhausted, he sat down  under a tree and expired. Mr. Park was shown the very spot where his  remains wore abandoned to the fowls of the air.    A considerable degree of information respecting the country on the  Senegal, was procured by a person of the name of Bruce, who had a  large share in the administration of the affairs of the French  African Companies. In one of his numerous journeys, he ascended the  Senegal as far as Gallam, and established a fort or factory at  Dramanet, a populous and commercial town. The inhabitants carried on  a trade as far as Timbuctoo, which they described as situated 500  leagues in the interior. They imported from it gold and ivory, and  slaves from Bambarra, which was represented by them, as an extensive  region between Timbuctoo and Cassan, barren but very populous. The  kingdom of Cassan was said to be formed into a sort of island, or  rather peninsula, by the branches of the Senegal. Gold was so  abundant there, that the metal often appeared on the surface of the  ground. From these circumstances it may be concluded, that Cassan was  in some degree confounded with Bambouk, which borders it on the  south. It had long been the ambition of the French, to find access to  this golden country, but the jealousy of the native merchants  presented an obstacle, that could not be easily surmounted.        CHAPTER IV.    There is no Chapter IV as the following chapter was numbered  Chapter V by mistake.        CHAPTER V.    The death of Major Houghton left the African Association without a  single individual employed in the particular service, for which the  company was originally established. On a sudden, Mr. Mungo Park, a  native of Scotland, offered himself to the society, and the committee  having made such inquiries as they thought necessary, accepted him  for the service.    His instructions were very plain and concise. He was directed, on his  arrival in Africa, to pass on to the river Niger, either by the way  of Bambouk, or by such other route as should be most convenient; that  he should ascertain the cause, and if possible, the rise and  termination of that river; that he should use his utmost exertion to  visit the principal towns or cities in its neighbourhood,  particularly Timbuctoo and Houssa, and that he should afterwards  return to Europe, by such route as, under the then existing  circumstances of his situation, should appear to him most advisable.    He sailed from Portsmouth on the 22nd of May, 1793, and on the 4th  June, he saw the mountains over Mogadore, on the coast of Africa, and  on the 21st, after a pleasant voyage, he anchored at Jillifree, a  town on the northern bank of the Gambia, opposite to James' Island,  where the English had formerly a small fort.    On the 23rd, he proceeded to Vintain, a town situated about two miles  up a creek, on the southern side of the river. Here he continued till  the 26th, when he continued his course up the river, which is deep  and muddy. The banks are covered with impenetrable thickets of  mangrove, and the whole of the adjacent country appears to be flat  and swampy. The Gambia abounds with fish, but none of them are known  in Europe. In six days after leaving Vintain, he reached Jonkakonda,  a place of considerable trade, where the vessel was to take in part  of her lading. The next morning the European traders came from their  different factories, to receive their letters, and learn the nature  and amount of the cargo; whilst the captain despatched a letter to  Dr. Laidley, with the information of Mr. Park's arrival. Dr. Laidley  came to Jonkakonda the morning following, when he delivered to him  Mr. Beaufoy's letter, when the doctor gave him a kind invitation to  spend his time at his house at Pisania, until an opportunity should  offer of prosecuting his journey. This invitation was too acceptable  to be refused.    Pisania is a small village in the king of Yany's dominions,  established by British subjects, as a factory for trade, and  inhabited solely by them and their black servants. The white  residents at the time of Mr. Park's arrival, consisted only of Dr.  Laidley and two gentlemen of the name of Ainsley, but their domestics  were numerous. They enjoyed perfect security, and being highly  respected by the natives at large, wanted no accommodation the  country could supply, and the greatest part of the trade in slaves;  ivory, and gold was in their hands.    Being settled in Pisania, Mr. Park's first object was to learn the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12668"],[0,"An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales, Volume 2 (#12)"],[1,"before he had been met by the people in the  fishing boat, he had fallen in with a great quantity of coal, with which  he and his companions made a large fire, and had slept by it during the  night, a whale-boat was sent off to the southward, with Mr. Bass, the  surgeon of the _Reliance_, to discover where an article so valuable  was to be met with. He proceeded about seven leagues to the southward of  Point Solander, where he found, in the face of a steep cliff, washed by  the sea a stratum of coal, in breadth about six feet, and extending eight  or nine miles to the southward. Upon the summit of the high land, and  lying on the surface, he observed many patches of coal, from some of  which it must have been that Mr. Clarke was so conveniently supplied with  fuel. He also found in the skeletons of the mate and carpenter of the  _Sydney Cove_, an unequivocal proof of their having unfortunately  perished, as was conjectured.    By the specimens of the coal which were brought in by Mr. Bass, the  quality appeared to be good; but, from its almost inaccessible situation,  no great advantage could ever be expected from it; and indeed, were it  even less difficult to be procured, unless some small harbour should be  near it, it could not be of much utility to the settlement.    No circumstance deserving of attention had occurred for some time among  the natives. On the 27th of this month, however, one of their young men  stood the trial practised by his countrymen, for having, as it was said,  killed some person in a quarrel. He stood manfully up against all their  spears, and defended himself with great skill and address. Having had two  shields split in his hand, by the spear passing quite through them, his  friends, who were numerous, attacked his opponents, whom they disarmed,  and broke their shields, with many of their spears.    It had been intended to have thrown some spears at Bennillong at this  time, from its having been reported that a woman, when she was dying, had  declared she dreamed that Bennillong had killed her. Her friends,  therefore, resolved to call him to an account, taking the business up on  the supposition that the woman must have had some cause of complaint  against him, or she would not have dreamed of his doing her an injury. To  this accusation Bennillong pleaded not guilty, declaring that he was an  entire stranger to the woman, and had never in his life offended her; but  there were some who said that he actually wounded this very woman, and  had been the cause of her death.    To those gentlemen who were acquainted with the temper and disposition of  this savage, there appeared much reason to credit the assertions of his  countrymen; for he was now observed to have become so fond of drinking,  that, whenever invited by any of the officers to their houses, he was  eager to be intoxicated, and in that state was so savage and violent as  to be capable of any mischief. On such occasions he amused himself with  annoying the women and insulting the men, who, from fear of offending his  white friends, spared those notices of his conduct which he so often  merited, and which sooner or later he would certainly meet with.    The court of criminal judicature was assembled once during this month,  when three prisoners, one of whom was a seaman belonging to the  _Britannia_, were transported to Norfolk Island for seven years.    The civil court was also assembled, and went through much troublesome and  litigious business, the effect of the spirit of trade which every where  prevailed.    The _Reliance_ having been cleared of her stores, and being now  quite light, was yet found to make as much water as before; and it  appeared, upon opening the ceiling, that the leak was in the guardboard  streak, abreast of the main-mast, the water rushing in there with great  force.    A survey had been held upon her consort, the _Supply_, after which  she was pronounced wholly unfit for further sea service.    The brickmakers, bricklayers, carpenters, and blacksmiths, were all fully  and variously employed at this time. For the latter, a large and  convenient shop, capable of working six or seven forges, was erecting at  Sydney. The different works which were in hand went on with a greater  spirit and more expedition than could have been expected, when the great  want of artificers and labouring people was considered. Some, though but  a few, mechanics had arrived in the last ships.    September.] This month began with a very vexatious circumstance. A boat  named the _Cumberland_, the largest and best in the colony belonging  to government, was, on her passage to the Hawkesbury, whither she was  carrying a few stores, taken possession of by a part of the boat's crew;  being at the same time boarded by a small boat from the shore, the people  in which seized her and put off to sea, first landing the coxswain and  three others, who were unwilling to accompany them, in Pitt Water in  Broken Bay. Those men proceeded overland to Port Jackson, where they gave  the first information of this daring and piratical transaction. Two  boats, well manned and armed, were immediately dispatched after them,  under the command of Lieutenant Shortland of the _Reliance_.    One of these boats returned in a few days, without having seen any thing  of them; but Lieutenant Shortland proceeded with the other, a whale boat,  as far as Port Stephens, where he thought it probable they might have  taken shelter; but on the 19th, having been absent thirteen days, he  returned without discovering the smallest trace of them or the boat. His  pursuit, however, had not been without its advantage; for on his return  he entered a river which he named Hunter river, about ten leagues to the  southward of Port Stephens into which he carried three fathoms water, in  the shoalest part of its entrance, finding deep water and good anchorage  within. The entrance of this river was but narrow, and covered by a high  rocky island, lying right off it, so as to leave a good passage round the  north end of the island, between that and the shore. A reef connects the  south part of the island with the south shore of the entrance of the  river. In this harbour was found a very considerable quantity of coal of  a very good sort, and lying so near the water side as to be conveniently  shipped; which gave it, in this particular, a manifest advantage over  that discovered to the southward. Some specimens of this coal were  brought up in the boat.    About this time a small decked long boat arrived from Norfolk island, and  brought an account that the master of the American snow _Mercury_  had landed there the remainder of the people who had been left by Captain  Bampton in Dusky Bay. When the _Endeavour_ was wrecked there about  20 months before*, the governor, not having any vessel at Port Jackson  fit for such a purpose, had expressed a wish to the master of the snow,  to this effect, when he was about leaving New South Wales. The master  made no objection, only stipulating that he might be permitted to take  from the wreck such stores as he might be in want of, but to this the  governor could not give his sanction, leaving him only to make what terms  he could with any of the people belonging to her whom he might find  alive. This service he performed under many difficulties, and brought off  all that now remained of these unfortunate people, amounting to 35 in  number, and landed them at Norfolk Island.    [* Vide Vol I Ch. XXX Page 384, viz: 'By letters received from  Mr. Bampton, who sailed from his place in the _Endeavour_ in  the month of September last, we now heard, that on his reaching Dusky Bay  in New Zealand his ship unfortunately proved so leaky, that with the  advice and consent of his officers and people she was run on shore and  scuttled.' and    Vol I Ch. XXX Page 388, viz: 'On the 17th the vessel built by the  shipwright Hatherleigh at Dusky Bay arrived, with some of the people left  behind by Mr. Bampton. They were so distressed for provisions, that the  person who had the direction of the vessel could not bring away the  whole; and it was singularly fortunate that he arrived as he did, for  with all the economy that could be used, his small stock of provisions  was consumed to the last mouthful the day before he made the land.']    By this conveyance the governor was also informed, that the  _Britannia_ had touched at the Island, and landed several convicts  who had secreted themselves on board her while she lay in this harbour.  Disappointed as these people generally were in their attempts to escape  from the settlement in this manner, yet it had become so certain a  system, that all the vigilance which could be exerted both on shore and  afloat was insufficient to prevent them. As the masters were seldom  refused permission to ship such as were free, it was their business to  receive no more on board than they could feed; and during the run between  Sydney and Norfolk island, the supernumeraries were generally discovered  and brought up from below. Indeed, considering the description of people  who formed the major or part of these deserters, it was not safe to have  many of them on board, being a lawless, abandoned, daring set of  wretches, to whom the commission of every crime was more familiar than  the practice of any one virtue.    On the 20th of the month, the _Deptford_, a small brig, arrived from  Madras, with a cargo of goods upon speculation for the Sydney market. The  spirit of trade which had for some time obtained in the colony afforded  an opening for adventurers to bring their goods to this settlement. The  voyage from India was short and direct; and, from the nature of their  investments, they were always certain of finding a ready sale, and an  ample return upon the original invoice. But this intercourse was found to  be pregnant with great evil to the colony; for, preferring spirits to any  other article that could be "]]]
