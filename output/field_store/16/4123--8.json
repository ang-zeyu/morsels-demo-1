They were  under fire from six in the morning until 1:30 in the afternoon, with  strict orders not to return the hail of lead, and not a man in those  dusky ranks flinched. Our brigade was instructed to move forward  soon after 1 o'clock to assault the series of blockhouses which was  regarded as impregnable by the foreign attaches. As the aide dashed  down our lines with orders from headquarters the boys realized the  prayed-for charge was about to take place and cheered lustily. Such a  charge! Will I ever forget that sublime spectacle? There was a river  called San Juan, from the hill hard by, but which historians will term  the pool of blood. Our brigade had to follow the course of that creek  fully half a mile to reach the point selected for the grand attack.  With what cheering did the boys go up that hill! Their naked bodies  seemed to present a perfect target to the fire of the dons, but they  never flinched. When the command reached the famous stone blockhouse  it was commanded by a second sergeant, who was promoted on the field  of battle for extraordinary bravery. San Juan fell many minutes before  El Caney, which was attacked first, and I think the Negro soldiers can  be thanked for the greater part of that glorious work. All honor to  the Negro soldiers! No white man, no matter what his ancestry may  be, should be ashamed to greet any of those Negro cavalrymen with  out-stretched hand. The swellest of the Rough Riders counted our  troopers among their best friends and asked them to their places in  New York when they returned, and I believe the wealthy fellows will  prove their admiration had a true inspiration.\"    Thus we see that while the various newspapers of the country  are striving to give the Rough Riders first honors, an honest,  straightforward army officer who was there and took an active part in  the fight, does not hesitate to give honor to whom honor is due, for  he says, \"All honor to the Negro soldiers,\" and that it was they who  \"saved the Rough Riders from destruction.\" And right here I wish to  call the reader's attention to another very important matter and that  is, while it has been said heretofore that the Negro soldier was not  competent to command, does not the facts in the case prove, beyond a  doubt, that there is no truth in the statement whatever? If a white  colonel was \"competent\" to lead his command into the fight, it seems  that a colored sergeant was competent extraordinary, for he not only  went into the fight, but he, and his command, \"done something,\"  done the enemy out of the trenches, \"saved the Rough Riders from  destruction,\" and planted the Stars and Stripes on the blockhouse.    Just before the charge, one of the foreign attaches, an Englishman,  was heard to say that he did not see how the blockhouse was to be  reached without the aid of cannon; but after the feat had been  accomplished, a colored soldier said, \"We showed him how.\"    Now that the colored soldier has proven to this nation, and the  representatives of others, that he can, and does fight, as well as the  \"other fellow,\" and that he is also \"competent\" to command, it remains  to be seen if the national government will give honor to whom honor is  due, by honoring those deserving, with commissions.    Under the second call for volunteers by the President, the State of  Illinois raised a regiment of colored soldiers, and Governor Tanner  officered that regiment with colored officers from colonel down; and  that, as you might say, before they had earned their \"rank.\" Now the  question is, can the national government afford to do less by those,  who have earned, and are justly entitled to, a place in the higher  ranks? We shall see.    C.F. ANDERSON.    Springfield, Ill.           *       *       *       *       *    COLORED FIGHTERS AT SANTIAGO.    Testimony is multiplying of the bravery of the colored troops at  Santiago de Cuba July 1st and 2d, 1898.    Testimony is adduced to show that these \"marvels of warfare\" actually  fought without officers and executed movements under a galling fire  which would have puzzled a recruit on parade ground. The Boston  Journal of the 31st, in its account, gives the following  interview-Mason Mitchell (white) said:    \"We were in a valley when we started, but made at once for a trail  running near the top of a ridge called La Quasina, several hundred  feet high, which, with several others parallel to it, extended in the  direction of Santiago. By a similar trail near the top of the ridge to  our right several companies of Negro troopers of the Ninth and Tenth  United States Cavalry marched in scout formation, as we did. We had an  idea about where the Spaniards were and depended upon Cuban scouts to  warn us but they did not do it. At about 8:30 o'clock in the morning  we met a volley from the enemy, who were ambushed, not only on our  ridge, but on the one to the right, beyond the Negro troops, and the  Negro soldiers were under a cross fire. That is how Capt. Capron and  Hamilton Fish were killed.\"    It says: \"Handsome young Sergt. Stewart, the Rough Rider protege of  Henry W. Maxwell, when he was telling of the fight in the ambush, gave  it as his opinion that the Rough Riders would have been whipped out if  the Tenth Cavalry (colored) had not come up just in time to drive  the Spaniards back. 'I'm a Southerner, from New Mexico, and I never  thought much of the 'nigger' before. Now I know what they are made of.  I respect them. They certainly can fight like the devil and they don't  care for bullets any more than they do for the leaves that shower down  on them. I've changed my opinion of the colored folks, for all of the  men that I saw fighting, there were none to beat the Tenth Cavalry and  the colored infantry at Santiago, and I don't mind saying so.'\"    The description which follows is interesting: \"It was simply grand to  see how those young fellows, and old fellows, too, men who were rich  and had been the petted of society in the city, walk up and down the  lines while their clothes were powdered by the dust from exploding  shells and torn by broken fragments cool as could be and yelling to  the men to lay low and take good aim, or directing some squad to take  care of a poor devil who was wounded. Why, at times there when the  bullets were so thick they mowed the grass down like grass cutters in  places, the officers stood looking at the enemy through glasses as if  they were enjoying the scene, and now and then you'd see a Captain or  a Lieutenant pick up a gun from a wounded or dead man and blaze  away himself at some good shot that he had caught sight of from his  advantage point. Those sights kind of bring men together and make  them think more of each other. And when a white man strayed from his  regiment and falls wounded it rather affects him to have a Negro, shot  himself a couple of times, take his carbine and make a splint of it  to keep a torn limb together for the white soldier, and then, after  lifting him to one side, pick up the wounded man's rifle and go back  to the fight with as much vigor as ever. Yes, sir, we boys have  learned something down there, even if some of us were pretty badly  torn for it.\"    Another witness testifies: \"Trooper Lewis Bowman, another of the brave  Tenth Cavalry, had two ribs broken by a Spanish shell while before San  Juan. He told of the battle as follows:\"    \"'The Rough Riders had gone off in great glee, bantering up and  good-naturedly boasting that they were going ahead to lick the  Spaniards without any trouble, and advising us to remain where we were  until they returned, and they would bring back some Spanish heads as  trophies. When we heard firing in the distance, our Captain remarked  that some one ahead was doing good work. The firing became so heavy  and regular that our officers, without orders, decided to move forward  and reconnoitre When we got where we could see what was going on we  found that the Rough Riders had marched down a sort of canon between  the mountains. The Spaniards had men posted at the entrance, and as  soon as the Rough Riders had gone in had about closed up the rear  and were firing upon the Rough Riders from both the front and rear.  Immediately the Spaniards in the rear received a volley from our men  of the Tenth Cavalry (colored) without command. The Spaniards were  afraid we were going to flank them, and rushed out of ambush, in front  of the Rough Riders, throwing up their hands and shouting, 'Don't  shoot; we are Cubans.'\"    \"The Rough Riders thus let them escape, and gave them a chance to take  a better position ahead. During all this time the men were in all the  tall grass and could not see even each other and I feared the Rough  Riders in the rear shot many of their men in the front, mistaking them  for Spanish soldiers. By this time the Tenth Cavalry had fully taken  in the situation, and, adopting the method employed in fighting  the Indians, were able to turn the tide of battle and repulse the  Spaniards.\"    He speaks plainly when he says:    \"I don't think it an exaggeration to say that if it had not been for  the timely aid of the Tenth Cavalry (colored) the Rough Riders would  have been exterminated. This is the unanimous opinion, at least, of  the men of the Tenth Cavalry. I was in the fight of July 1, and it was  in that fight that I received my wound. We were under fire in that  fight about forty-eight hours, and were without food and with but  little water. We had been cut off from our pack train, as the Spanish  sharpshooters shot our mules as soon as they came anywhere near the  lines, and it was impossible to move supplies. Very soon after the  firing "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11114"],[0,"Debate on Woman Suffrage in the Senate of the United States, (#12)"],[1,"of civilized society. It is essential to every      government that it should represent the supreme power of the      State, and be capable of subjecting the will of its individual      citizens to its authority. Such a government can only derive      its just powers from the consent of the governed, and can be      established only under a fundamental law which is self-imposed.      Every citizen of suitable age and discretion who is to be subject      to such a government has, in my judgment, a natural right to      participate in its formation. It is a significant fact that should      Congress pass this bill and authorize the people of Washington      Territory to frame a State constitution and organize a State      government, the fundamental law of the State will be made by all      the citizens of the State to be subject to it, and not by one-half      of them. And we shall witness the spectacle of a State government      founded in accordance with the principles of equality, and have a      State at last with a truly republican form of government.        The fathers of the Republic enunciated the doctrine \"that all men      are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with      certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty,      and the pursuit of happiness.\" It is strange that any one in this      enlightened age should be found to contend that this declaration      is true only of men, and that a man is endowed by his Creator with      inalienable rights not possessed by a woman. The lamented Lincoln      immortalized the expression that ours is a Government \"of the      people, by the people, and for the people,\" and yet it is far from      that. There can be no government by the people where one-half      of them are allowed no voice in its organization and control. I      regard the struggle going on in this country and elsewhere for      the enfranchisement of women as but a continuation of the great      struggle for human liberty which has, from the earliest dawn of      authentic history, convulsed nations, rent kingdoms, and drenched      battlefields with human blood. I look upon the victories which      have been achieved in the cause of woman's enfranchisement in      Washington Territory and elsewhere as the crowning victories of      all which have been won in the long-continued, still-continuing      contest between liberty and oppression, and as destined to exert a      greater influence upon the human race than any achieved upon the      battlefield in ancient or modern times.    Mr. DOLPH. Mr. President, the movement for woman suffrage has passed  the stage of ridicule. The pending joint resolution may not pass  during this Congress, but the time is not far distant when in every  State of the Union and in every Territory women will be admitted to  an equal voice in the government, and that will be done whether the  Federal Constitution is amended or not. The first convention demanding  suffrage for women was held at Seneca Falls, in the State of New York,  in 1848. To-day in three of the Territories of the Union women enjoy  full suffrage, in a large number of States and Territories they  are entitled to vote at school meetings, and in all the States and  Territories there is a growing sentiment in favor of this measure  which will soon compel respectful consideration by the law-making  power.    No measure in this country involving such radical changes in our  institutions and fraught with so great consequences to this country  and to humanity has made such progress as the movement for woman  suffrage. Denunciation will not much longer answer for arguments by  the opponents of this measure. The portrayal of the evils to flow from  woman suffrage such as we have heard pictured to-day by the Senator  from Georgia, the loss of harmony between husband and wife, and the  consequent instability of the marriage relation, the neglect of  husband and children by wives and mothers for the performance of their  political duties, in short the incapacitating of women for wives and  mothers and companions, will not much longer serve to frighten the  timid. Proof is better than theory. The experiment has been tried  and the predicted evils to flow from it have not followed. On the  contrary, if we can believe the almost universal testimony, everywhere  where it has been tried it has been followed by the most beneficial  results.    In Washington Territory, since woman was enfranchised, there have been  two elections. At the first there were 8,368 votes cast by women out  of a total vote of 34,000 and over. At the second election, which was  held in November last, out of 48,000 votes cast in the Territory,  12,000 votes were cast by women. The opponents of female suffrage  are silenced there. The Territorial conventions of both parties have  resolved in favor of woman suffrage, and there is not a proposition,  so far as I know in all that Territory, to repeal the law conferring  suffrage upon woman.    I desire also to inform my friend from Georgia that since women were  enfranchised in Washington Territory nature has continued in her  wonted courses. The sun rises and sets; there is seed-time and  harvest; seasons come and go. The population has increased with the  usual regularity and rapidity. Marriages have been quite as frequent,  and divorces have been no more so. Women have not lost their influence  for good upon society, but men have been elevated and refined. If we  are to believe the testimony which comes from lawyers, physicians,  ministers of the gospel, merchants, mechanics, farmers, and laboring  men, the united testimony of the entire people of the Territory, the  results of woman suffrage there have been all that could be desired by  its friends. Some of the results in that Territory have been seen  in making the polls quiet and orderly, in awaking a new interest in  educational questions and in questions of moral reform, in securing  the passage of beneficial laws and the proper enforcement of them;  and, as I have said before, in elevating men, and that without injury  to the women.    Mr. EUSTIS. Will the Senator allow me to ask him a question?    Mr. DOLPH. The Senator can ask me a question, if he chooses.    Mr. EUSTIS. If it be right and proper to confer the right of suffrage  on women, I ask the Senator whether he does not think that women ought  to be required to serve on juries?    Mr. DOLPH. I can answer that very readily. It does not necessarily  follow that because a woman is permitted to vote and thus have a voice  in making the laws by which she is to be governed and by which her  property rights are to be determined, she must perform such duty as  service upon a jury. But I will inform the Senator that in Washington  Territory she does serve upon juries, and with great satisfaction  to the judges of the courts and to all parties who desire to see an  honest and efficient administration of law.    Mr. EUSTIS. I was aware of the fact that women are required to serve  on juries in Washington Territory because they are allowed to vote.  I understand that under all State laws those duties are considered  correlative. Now, I ask the Senator whether he thinks it is a decent  spectacle to take a mother away from her nursing infant and lock her  up all night to sit on a jury?    Mr. DOLPH. I intended to say before I reached this point of being  interrogated that I not only do not believe that there is a single  argument against woman suffrage that is tenable, and I may be  prejudiced in the matter, but that there is not a single one that is  really worthy of any serious consideration. The Senator from Louisiana  is a lawyer, and he knows very well that under such circumstances, a  mother with a nursing infant, that fact being made known to the court  would be excused; that would be a sufficient excuse. He knows himself,  and he has seen it done a hundred times, that for trivial excuses  compared to that men have been excused from service on a jury.    Mr. EUSTIS. I will ask the Senator whether he knows that under the  laws of Washington Territory that is a legal excuse from serving on a  jury?    Mr. DOLPH. I am not prepared to state that it is; but there is no  question in the world but that any judge, that fact being made known,  would excuse a woman from attendance upon a jury. No special authority  would be required. I will state further that I have not learned that  there has been any serious objection on the part of any woman summoned  for jury service in that Territory to perform that duty. I have not  learned that it has worked to the disadvantage of any family in the  Territory; but I do know that the judges of the courts have taken  especial pains to commend the women who have been called to serve upon  juries for the manner in which they have discharged their duty.    I wish to say further that there is no connection whatever between  jury service and the right of suffrage. The question as to who shall  perform jury service, the question as to who shall perform military  service, the question as to who shall perform civil official duty in  a government is certainly a matter to be regulated by the community  itself; but the question of the right to participate in the formation  of a government which controls the life and the property and the  destinies of its citizens, I contend is a question of right that goes  back of these mere regulations for the protection of property and the  punishment of offenses under the laws. It is a matter of right which  it is tyranny to refuse to any citizen demanding it.    Now, Mr. President, I shall close by saying: God speed the day when  not only in all the States of the Union and in all the Territories,  but everywhere, woman shall stand before the law freed from the last  shackle which has been riveted upon her by tyranny and the last  disability which has been imposed upon her by ignorance,"]]]
