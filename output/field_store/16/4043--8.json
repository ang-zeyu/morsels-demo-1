Whatever it  was it caused him to start up with a pale, panic-stricken face, and eye  her as if she had pronounced his doom.    \"Do you doubt it now?\" she asked coldly.    \"He told you! Even your skill and craft could not discover it alone,\"  he muttered.    \"Nay, I told you nothing was impossible to a determined woman. I needed  no help, for I knew more than you think.\"    He sank down again in a despairing attitude and hid his face, saying  mournfully, \"I might have known you would hunt me down and dash my hopes  when they were surest. How will you use this unhappy secret?\"    \"I will tell Octavia, and make her duty less hard. It will be kind to  both of you, for even with her this memory would mar your happiness; and  it saves her from the shame and grief of discovering, when too late,  that she has given herself to a--\"    \"Stop!\" he cried, in a tone that made her start and pale, as he rose out  of his chair white with a stern indignation which awed her for a moment.  \"You shall not utter that word--you know but half the truth, and if you  wrong me or trouble the girl I will turn traitor also, and tell the  general the game you are playing with my cousin. You feign to love me as  you feigned before, but his title is the bait now as then, and you fancy  that by threatening to mar my hopes you will secure my silence, and gain  your end.\"    \"Wrong, quite wrong. Jasper is nothing to me; I use _him_ as a tool, not  you. If I threaten, it is to keep you from Octavia, who cannot forgive  the past and love you for yourself, as I have done all these miserable  months. You say I know but half the truth. Tell me the whole and I will  spare you.\"    If ever a man was tempted to betray a trust it was Treherne then. A  word, and Octavia might be his; silence, and she might be lost; for this  woman was in earnest, and possessed the power to ruin his good name  forever. The truth leaped to his lips and would have passed them, had  not his eye fallen on the portrait of Jasper's father. This man had  loved and sheltered the orphan all his life, had made of him a son, and,  dying, urged him to guard and serve and save the rebellious youth he  left, when most needing a father's care.    \"I promised, and I will keep my promise at all costs,\" sighed Treherne,  and with a gesture full of pathetic patience he waved the fair tempter  from him, saying steadily, \"I will never tell you, though you rob me of  that which is dearer than my life. Go and work your will, but remember  that when you might have won the deepest gratitude of the man you  profess to love, you chose instead to earn his hatred and contempt.\"    Waiting for no word of hers, he took refuge in his room, and Edith  Snowdon sank down upon the couch, struggling with contending emotions of  love and jealousy, remorse and despair. How long she sat there she could  not tell; an approaching step recalled her to herself, and looking up  she saw Octavia. As the girl approached down the long vista of the  drawing rooms, her youth and beauty, innocence and candor touched that  fairer and more gifted woman with an envy she had never known before.  Something in the girl's face struck her instantly: a look of peace and  purity, a sweet serenity more winning than loveliness, more impressive  than dignity or grace. With a smile on her lips, yet a half-sad,  half-tender light in her eyes, and a cluster of pale winter roses in her  hand, she came on till she stood before her rival and, offering the  flowers, said, in words as simple as sincere, \"Dear Mrs. Snowdon, I  cannot let the last sun of the old year set on any misdeeds of mine for  which I may atone. I have disliked, distrusted, and misjudged you, and  now I come to you in all humility to say forgive me.\"    With the girlish abandon of her impulsive nature Octavia knelt down  before the woman who was plotting to destroy her happiness, laid the  roses like a little peace offering on her lap, and with eloquently  pleading eyes waited for pardon. For a moment Mrs. Snowdon watched her,  fancying it a well-acted ruse to disarm a dangerous rival; but in that  sweet face there was no art; one glance showed her that. The words smote  her to the heart and won her in spite of pride or passion, as she  suddenly took the girl into her arms, weeping repentant tears. Neither  spoke, but in the silence each felt the barrier which had stood between  them vanishing, and each learned to know the other better in that moment  than in a year of common life. Octavia rejoiced that the instinct which  had prompted her to make this appeal had not misled her, but assured her  that behind the veil of coldness, pride, and levity which this woman  wore there was a heart aching for sympathy and help and love. Mrs.  Snowdon felt her worser self slip from her, leaving all that was true  and noble to make her worthy of the test applied. Art she could meet  with equal art, but nature conquered her. For spite of her misspent life  and faulty character, the germ of virtue, which lives in the worst, was  there, only waiting for the fostering sun and dew of love to strengthen  it, even though the harvest be a late one.    \"Forgive you!\" she cried, brokenly. \"It is I who should ask forgiveness  of you--I who should atone, confess, and repent. Pardon _me_, pity me,  love me, for I am more wretched than you know.\"    \"Dear, I do with heart and soul. Believe it, and let me be your friend\"  was the soft answer.    \"God knows I need one!\" sighed the poor woman, still holding fast the  only creature who had wholly won her. \"Child, I am not good, but not so  bad that I dare not look in your innocent face and call you friend. I  never had one of my own sex. I never knew my mother; and no one ever saw  in me the possibility of goodness, truth, and justice but you. Trust and  love and help me, Octavia, and I will reward you with a better life, if  I can do no more.\"    \"I will, and the new year shall be happier than the old.\"    \"God bless you for that prophecy; may I be worthy of it.\"    Then as a bell warned them away, the rivals kissed each other tenderly,  and parted friends. As Mrs. Snowdon entered her room, she saw her  husband sitting with his gray head in his hands, and heard him murmur  despairingly to himself, \"My life makes her miserable. But for the sin  of it I'd die to free her.\"    \"No, live for me, and teach me to be happy in your love.\" The clear  voice startled him, but not so much as the beautiful changed face of the  wife who laid the gray head on her bosom, saying tenderly, \"My kind and  patient husband, you have been deceived. From me you shall know all the  truth, and when you have forgiven my faulty past, you shall see how  happy I will try to make your future.\"          Chapter VII      A GHOSTLY REVEL    \"Bless me, how dull we are tonight!\" exclaimed Rose, as the younger  portion of the party wandered listlessly about the drawing rooms that  evening, while my lady and the major played an absorbing game of piquet,  and the general dozed peacefully at last.    \"It is because Maurice is not here; he always keeps us going, for he is  a fellow of infinite resources,\" replied Sir Jasper, suppressing a yawn.    \"Have him out then,\" said Annon.    \"He won't come. The poor lad is blue tonight, in spite of his  improvement. Something is amiss, and there is no getting a word  from him.\"    \"Sad memories afflict him, perhaps,\" sighed Blanche.    \"Don't be absurd, dear, sad memories are all nonsense; melancholy is  always indigestion, and nothing is so sure a cure as fun,\" said Rose  briskly. \"I'm going to send in a polite invitation begging him to come  and amuse us. He'll accept, I haven't a doubt.\"    The message was sent, but to Rose's chagrin a polite refusal was  returned.    \"He _shall_ come. Sir Jasper, do you and Mr. Annon go as a deputation  from us, and return without him at your peril\" was her command.    They went, and while waiting their reappearance the sisters spoke of  what all had observed.    \"How lovely Mrs. Snowdon looks tonight. I always thought she owed half  her charms to her skill in dress, but she never looked so beautiful as  in that plain black silk, with those roses in her hair,\" said Rose.    \"What has she done to herself?\" replied Blanche. \"I see a change,  but can't account for it. She and Tavie have made some beautifying  discovery, for both look altogether uplifted and angelic all of a  sudden.\"    \"Here come the gentlemen, and, as I'm a Talbot, they haven't got him!\"  cried Rose as the deputation appeared, looking very crestfallen. \"Don't  come near me,\" she added, irefully, \"you are disloyal cowards, and I  doom you to exile till I want you. _I_ am infinite in resources as well  as this recreant man, and come he shall. Mrs. Snowdon, would you mind  asking Mr. Treherne to suggest something to wile away the rest of this  evening? We are in despair, and can think of nothing, and you are  all-powerful with him.\"    \"I must decline, since he refuses you\" was the decided answer, as Mrs.  Snowdon moved away.    \"Tavie, dear, do go; we _must_ have him; he always obeys you, and you  would be such a public benefactor, you know.\"    Without a word Octavia wrote a line and sent it by a servant. Several  minutes passed, and the gentlemen began to lay wagers on the success of  her trial. \"He will not come for me, you may be sure,\" said Octavia. As  the words passed her lips he appeared.    A general laugh greeted him, but, taking no notice of the jests at  his expense, he turned to Octavia, saying quietly, \"What can I do for  you, Cousin?\"    His colorless face and weary eyes reproached her for disturbing him, but  it was too late for regret, and she answered hastily, \"We are in want of  some new and amusing occupation to wile away the evening. Can you  suggest something appropriate?\"    \"Why not sit round the hall fire and tell stories, while we wait to see  the old year out, as we used"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/87"],[0,"The 1993 CIA World Factbook (#11)"],[1,"prohibits    all activities relating to mineral resources except scientific research;    four parties have ratified Protocol as of June 1993  Legal system:    US law, including certain criminal offenses by or against US nationals, such    as murder, may apply to areas not under jurisdiction of other countries.

During the period 1987-90, real GDP    expanded at an annual average rate of about 6%. Tourism makes a direct    contribution to GDP of about 13% and also affects growth in other sectors -    particularly in construction, communications, and public utilities. Although    Antigua and Barbuda is one of the few areas in the Caribbean experiencing a    labor shortage in some sectors of the economy, it has been hurt in 1991-92    by a downturn in tourism caused by the Persian Gulf war and the US    recession.
