[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12281"],[0,"Cattle Brands: A Collection of Western Camp-Fire Stories (#12)"],[1," this time was a frontier village, with a mixed  population, the Mexican being the most prominent inhabitant. There was  much to be seen which was new and attractive to the young Easterner,  and he tarried in it several days, enjoying its novel and picturesque  life. The arrival and departure of the various stage lines for the  accommodation of travelers like himself was of more than passing  interest. They rattled in from Austin and Laredo. They were sometimes  late from El Paso, six hundred miles to the westward. Probably a brush  with the Indians, or the more to be dreaded Mexican bandits (for  these stages carried treasure--gold and silver, the currency of the  country), was the cause of the delay. Frequently they carried guards,  whose presence was generally sufficient to command the respect of the  average robber.    Then there were the freight trains, the motive power of which was  mules and oxen. It was necessary to carry forward supplies and bring  back the crude products of the country. The Chihuahua wagon was drawn  sometimes by twelve, sometimes by twenty mules, four abreast in  the swing, the leaders and wheelers being single teams. For mutual  protection trains were made up of from ten to twenty wagons. Drivers  frequently meeting a chance acquaintance going in an opposite  direction would ask, \"What is your cargo?\" and the answer would be  frankly given, \"Specie.\" Many a Chihuahua wagon carried three or four  tons of gold and silver, generally the latter. Here was a new book  for this college lad, one he had never studied, though it was  more interesting to him than some he had read. There was something  thrilling in all this new life. He liked it. The romance was real; it  was not an imitation. People answered his few questions and asked none  in return.    In this frontier village at a late hour one night young Wells  overheard this conversation: \"Hello, Bill,\" said the case-keeper in  a faro game, as he turned his head halfway round to see who was the  owner of the monster hand which had just reached over his shoulder and  placed a stack of silver dollars on a card, marking it to win, \"I've  missed you the last few days. Where have you been so long?\"    \"Oh, I've just been out to El Paso on a little pasear guarding the  stage,\" was the reply. Now the little pasear was a continuous night  and day round-trip of twelve hundred miles. Bill had slept and eaten  as he could. When mounted, he scouted every possible point of ambush  for lurking Indian or bandit. Crossing open stretches of country, he  climbed up on the stage and slept. Now having returned, he was anxious  to get his wages into circulation. Here were characters worthy of a  passing glance.    Interesting as this frontier life was to the young man, he prepared  for his final destination. He had no trouble in locating his father's  property, for it was less than twenty miles from San Antonio. Securing  an American who spoke Spanish, the two set out on horseback. There  were several small ranchitos on the tract, where five or six Mexican  families lived. Each family had a field and raised corn for bread. A  flock of goats furnished them milk and meat. The same class of people  in older States were called squatters, making no claim to ownership  of the land. They needed little clothing, the climate being in their  favor.    The men worked at times. The pecan crop which grew along the creek  bottoms was beginning to have a value in the coast towns for shipment  to northern markets, and this furnished them revenue for their simple  needs. All kinds of game was in abundance, including waterfowl in  winter, though winter here was only such in name. These simple people  gave a welcome to the New Yorker which appeared sincere. They offered  no apology for their presence on this land, nor was such in order, for  it was the custom of the country. They merely referred to themselves  as \"his people,\" as though belonging to the land.    When they learned that he was the son of the owner of the grant, and  that he wanted to spend a few months hunting and looking about,  they considered themselves honored. The best jacal in the group was  tendered him and his interpreter. The food offered was something new,  but the relish with which his companion partook of it assisted young  Wells in overcoming his scruples, and he ate a supper of dishes he had  never tasted before. The coffee he declared was delicious.    On the advice of his companion they had brought along blankets. The  women of the ranchito brought other bedding, and a comfortable bed  soon awaited the Americanos. The owner of the jacal in the mean time  informed his guest through the interpreter that he had sent to a  near-by ranchito for a man who had at least the local reputation of  being quite a hunter. During the interim, while awaiting the arrival  of the man, he plied his guest with many questions regarding the  outside world, of which his ideas were very simple, vague, and  extremely provincial. His conception of distance was what he could  ride in a given number of days on a good pony. His ideas of wealth  were no improvement over those of his Indian ancestors of a century  previous. In architecture, the jacal in which they sat satisfied his  ideals.    The footsteps of a horse interrupted their conversation. A few moments  later, Tiburcio, the hunter, was introduced to the two Americans with  a profusion of politeness. There was nothing above the ordinary in  the old hunter, except his hair, eyes, and swarthy complexion, which  indicated his Aztec ancestry. It might be in perfect order to remark  here that young Wells was perfectly composed, almost indifferent to  the company and surroundings. He shook hands with Tiburcio in a manner  as dignified, yet agreeable, as though he was the governor of his  native State or the minister of some prominent church at home. From  this juncture, he at once took the lead in the conversation, and kept  up a line of questions, the answers to which were very gratifying.  He learned that deer were very plentiful everywhere, and that on this  very tract of land were several wild turkey roosts, where it was  no trouble to bag any number desired. On the prairie portion of the  surrounding country could be found large droves of antelope. During  drouthy periods they were known to come twenty miles to quench their  thirst in the Salado, which was the main watercourse of this grant.  Once Tiburcio assured his young patron that he had frequently counted  a thousand antelope during a single morning. Then there was also the  javeline or peccary which abounded in endless numbers, but it was  necessary to hunt them with dogs, as they kept the thickets and came  out in the open only at night. Many a native cur met his end hunting  these animals, cut to pieces with their tusks, so that packs, trained  for the purpose, were used to bay them until the hunter could arrive  and dispatch them with a rifle. Even this was always done from  horseback, as it was dangerous to approach the javeline, for they  would, when aroused, charge anything.    All this was gratifying to young Wells, and like a congenial fellow,  he produced and showed the old hunter a new gun, the very latest model  in the market, explaining its good qualities through his interpreter.  Tiburcio handled it as if it were a rare bit of millinery, but managed  to ask its price and a few other questions. Through his companion,  Wells then engaged the old hunter's services for the following day;  not that he expected to hunt, but he wanted to acquaint himself with  the boundaries of the land and to become familiar with the surrounding  country. Naming an hour for starting in the morning, the two men shook  hands and bade each other good-night, each using his own language to  express the parting, though neither one knew a word the other said.  The first link in a friendship not soon to be broken had been forged.    Tiburcio was on hand at the appointed hour in the morning, and being  joined by the two Americans they rode off up the stream. It was  October, and the pecans, they noticed, were already falling, as  they passed through splendid groves of this timber, several times  dismounting to fill their pockets with nuts. Tiburcio frequently  called attention to fresh deer tracks near the creek bottom, and  shortly afterward the first game of the day was sighted. Five or six  does and grown fawns broke cover and ran a short distance, stopped,  looked at the horsemen, and then capered away.    Riding to the highest ground in the vicinity, they obtained a splendid  view of the stream, outlined by the foliage of the pecan groves that  lined its banks as far as the eye could follow either way. Tiburcio  pointed out one particular grove lying three or four miles farther up  the creek. Here he said was a cabin which had been built by a white  man who had left it several years ago, and which he had often used as  a hunting camp in bad weather. Feeling his way cautiously, Wells asked  the old hunter if he were sure that this cabin was on and belonged to  the grant. Being assured on both points, he then inquired if there was  anything to hinder him from occupying the hut for a few months. On the  further assurance that there was no man to dispute his right, he began  plying his companions with questions. The interpreter told him that it  was a very common and simple thing for men to batch, enumerating the  few articles he would need for this purpose.    They soon reached the cabin, which proved to be an improvement over  the ordinary jacal of the country, as it had a fireplace and chimney.  It was built of logs; the crevices were chinked with clay for mortar,  its floor being of the same substance. The only Mexican feature it  possessed was the thatched roof. While the Americans were examining it  and its surroundings, Tiburcio unsaddled the horses, picketing one and  hobbling the other two, kindled a fire, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12288"],[0,"The Witchcraft Delusion in Colonial Connecticut (1647-1697) (#12)"],[1,"& estates of  sundry of their Maties subjects or to some of them contrary to the law  of God, the peace of our soueraigne lord & lady the King & Queen their  crowne & dignity.\"    \"BILLA VERA.\"      Others were indicted and tried, at this session of the court and its  adjournments, notably Elizabeth Clawson. Many depositions were taken in  Fairfield and elsewhere, some of the defendants were discharged and  others convicted, but Mercy Disborough's case was the most noted one in  the tests applied, and in the conclusions to which it led. The whole  case with its singular incidents is worthy of careful study. Some of the  testimony is given here.
