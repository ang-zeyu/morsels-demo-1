During our stay here, the Ranger packet, _Captain Buchanan_, arrived  after a passage of twelve weeks from Falmouth, bound to Bengal. She  sailed again immediately. One officer alone of our fleet was fortunate  enough to receive letters by her from his connexions in England.    At the time of our arrival the inhabitants of this agreeable town had  scarcely recovered from the consternation into which they had been thrown  by one of the black people called Malays, with whom the place abounded;  and who, taking offence at the governor for not returning him to Batavia  (where, it seemed, he was of consequence among his own countrymen, and  whence he had been sent to the Cape as a punishment for some offence),  worked himself up to frenzy by the effect of opium, and, arming himself  with variety of weapons, rushed forth in the dusk of the evening, killing  or maiming indiscriminately all who were so unfortunate as to be in his  route, women alone excepted. He stabbed the sentinel at the gate of the  Company's gardens, and placed himself at his post, waiting some time in  expectation of the governor's appearance, who narrowly escaped the fate  intended for him, by its falling on another person accidentally passing  that way. On being pursued, he fled with incredible swiftness to the  Table Mountain at the back of the town, whence this single miscreant,  still animated by the effect of the opium, for two days resisted and  defied every force that was sent against him. The alarm and terror into  which the town was thrown were inconceivable; for two days none ventured  from within their houses, either masters or slaves; for an order was  issued (as the most likely means of destroying him, should he appear in  the town) that whatever Malay was seen in the streets should be instantly  killed by the soldiery. On the evening of the second day, however, he was  taken alive on the Table Mountain, having done much injury to those who  took him, and was immediately consigned to the death he merited, being  broken on the wheel, and his head and members severed after the  execution, and distributed in different parts of the country.    Of this man, who had killed fourteen of the inhabitants, and desperately  wounded nearly double that number, it was remarked, that in his progress  his fury fell only on men, women passing him unhurt; and it was as  extraordinary as it was unfortunate, that among those whom his rage  destroyed, were some of the most deserving and promising young men in the  town. This, at Batavia, was called running a muck, or amocke, and  frequently happened there, but was the first instance of the kind known  at the Cape. Since that time, every Malay or other slave, having business  in the street after a certain hour in the evening, is obliged to carry a  lighted lantern, on pain of being stopped by the sentinel and kept in  custody until morning. Murder and villany are strongly depicted on the  features of the slaves of that nation; and such of them as dared to speak  of this dreadful catastrophe clearly appeared to approve the behaviour of  their countryman.    The government of the Cape we understood to be vested in a governor and  council, together with a court of justice. The council is composed of the  governor, the second or lieutenant-governor, the fiscal, the commanding  officer of the troops for the time being, and four counsellors. With  these all regulations for the management of the colony originate; and  from them all orders and decrees are issued. The court of justice is  composed of the fiscal, the second governor, a secretary, and twelve  members, six of whom are from among the burghers, and six from among the  bourgeoisie. The fiscal, who was the first magistrate, had hitherto been  styled independent, that is to say, his decisions were not subject to the  interference of the governor and council; but we were informed, that  since the death of the late fiscal, M. Serrurier, it had been determined  by the States, that the decrees of the fiscal should be subject to the  revision of the council. Before this officer were tried all causes both  civil and criminal. He had a set of people belonging to him who  constantly patrolled the streets armed, to apprehend all vagrant and  disorderly persons. Every fourteen days offences were tried. The prison  was adjacent to and had communication with the court-house. The place  where all sentences were executed stood to the left of the landing-place,  a short distance above the fort or castle. The ground on which it stood  was raised by several steps above the road. Within the walls were to be  seen (and seen with horror) six crosses for breaking criminals, a large  gibbet, a spiked pole for impalements, wheels, etc., etc. together with a  slight wooden building, erected for the reception of the ministers of  justice upon execution-days. Over the entrance was a figure of justice,  with the usual emblems of a sword and balance, and the following apposite  inscription: 'Felix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum.' The bodies of  those broken on the wheel were exposed in different parts of the town,  several instances of which, and some very recent ones, were still to be  seen.    It had been always imagined, that the police of the Cape-town was so well  regulated as to render it next to impossible for any man to escape, after  whom the fiscal's people were in pursuit. This, however, did not appear  to be the case; for very shortly after our arrival four seamen belonging  to a ship of our fleet deserted from her; and although rewards were  offered for apprehending them, and every effort made that was likely to  insure success, two only were retaken before our departure.    Since the attempt meditated upon the Cape by the late Commodore  Johnstone, the attention of the government appeared to have been directed  to its internal defence. To this end additional works had been  constructed on each side of the town, toward the hill called the Lion's  Rump, and beyond the castle or garrison. But the defence in which they  chiefly prided themselves, and of which we were fortunate enough to  arrive in time to be spectators, consisted of two corps of cavalry and  one of infantry, formed from the gentlemen and inhabltants of the town.  We understood that these corps were called out annually to be exercised  during seven days, and were reviewed on the last day of their exercise by  the governor attended by his whole council. They appeared to be stout and  able-bodied men, particularly those who composed the two corps of  cavalry, and who were reputed to be excellent marksmen. Their horses,  arms, and appointments were purchased at their own expense, and they were  expected to hold them selves in readiness to assemble whenever their  services might be required by the governor. For uniform, they wore a blue  coat with white buttons, and buff waistcoat and breeches. Their parade  was the Square or Market-place, where they were attended by music, and  visited by all the beauty of the place, who animated them by their smiles  from the balcony of the town-hall, and if the weather was favourable  accompanied them to the exercising ground, where tents were pitched for  their reception, and whence they beheld these patriotic Africans (for few  of them knew Holland but by name) enuring themselves to the tolls of war,  '_pro aris et focis_'. We were however told, that at the least idea of an  enemy coming on the coast, the women were immediately sent to a distance  in the country.    The militia throughout the whole district of the Cape were assembled at  this time of the year, exercised for a week, and reviewed by the governor  or his deputy, commencing with the militia of the Capetown.    The present governor of the Cape, Mr. Van de Graaf, though a colonel of  engineers in the service of the States, yet holds his commission as  governor under the authority of the Dutch East India Company, to which  body the settlement wholly belongs. Every ship or vessel wearing a  pendant of the States, be her rate what it may, is on entering the  harbour saluted by the fort, which salute she returns with an inferior  number of guns. The governor, at the landing-place, with his officers and  carriages, attends the coming on shore of her captain or senior officer,  to receive his commands, and escort him to his lodgings in the town,  treating him with every mark of respect in his power. Such an humiliation  of the Company's principal servant and officers in a commercial community  bore, it must be confessed, rather an extraordinary appearance; but such,  as we were informed, was the distinction between the two services; and  Mr. Van de Graaf was obliged to obtain his prince's permission before he  could accept of the government of the Cape from the East India Company.    Residence at the Cape would be highly agreeable, were it not for the  south-east wind. This during the summer season blows with such violence,  and drives every where such clouds of sand before it, that the  inhabitants at certain times dare not stir out of their houses. Torrents  of dust and sand, we were told, had been frequently known to fall on  board of ships in the road. This circumstance accounted for every thing  we got here being gritty to the taste; sand mixing with their flour,  their rice, their sugar, and with whatever"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12573"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 08 (#12)"],[1,"one of them would wake the other when they  heard Black Marianne down stairs, running to and fro and muttering to  herself. But Damie's transmigration to Black Marianne's was the cause of  new trouble. Damie was exceedingly discontented at having been compelled  to learn a miserable trade that was fit only for a cripple. He wanted to  be a mason, and although Amrei was very much opposed to it, for she  predicted that he would not keep at it, Black Marianne supported him in  it. She would have liked to make all the young lads masons, and then to  have sent them out on their travels that they might bring back news of  her John.    Black Marianne seldom went to church, but she always liked to have  anybody else borrow her hymn-book and take it to church--it seemed to  give her a kind of pleasure to have it there. She was especially pleased  when any strange workman, who happened to be employed in the village,  borrowed the hymn-book which John had left behind him for that purpose;  for it seemed to her as if John himself were praying in his native  church, when the words were spoken and sung out of his book. And now  Damie was obliged to go to church twice every Sunday with John's  hymn-book.    While Marianne did not go to church herself, she was always to be seen  at every solemn ceremony in the village or in any of the surrounding  villages. There was never a funeral which Marianne did not attend as one  of the mourners; and at the funeral sermon, and the blessing spoken over  the grave, even of a little child, she always wept so violently that one  would have thought she was the nearest relative. On the way home,  however, she was always especially cheerful, for this weeping seemed to  be a kind of relief to her; all the year round she had to suppress so  much secret sorrow, that she felt thankful for an opportunity to give  vent to her feelings.    Could people be blamed if they shunned her as an uncanny person,  especially as they were keeping a secret from her? The habit of avoiding  Black Marianne was partly extended to Amrei herself; in several houses  where the girl called to offer help or sympathy she was made to see  distinctly that her presence was not desired, especially as she herself  was beginning to show certain eccentricities which astonished the whole  village; for example, except on the coldest winter days she used to go  barefoot, and people said that she must know some secret method to  prevent herself from catching cold and dying.    Only in the house of Farmer Rodel were they glad to have her, for the  farmer was her guardian. His wife, who had always taken Amrei's part and  who had one day promised to take her into her service when she was  older, was prevented from carrying out this plan. She herself was taken  by another--Death. The heaviness of life is generally felt in later  years, when one friend after another has been called away, and only a  name and a memory remains. But it was Amrei's lot to experience this in  her youth; and it was she and Black Marianne who wept more bitterly than  any of the others at the funeral of Farmer Rodel's wife.    Farmer Rodel was always complaining about how hard it was that he should  have to give up his property so soon, although not one of his three  children was yet married. But hardly a year had passed, and Damie had  not yet worked a full year in the quarry, when the celebration of a  double wedding was announced in the village; for Farmer Rodel's eldest  daughter and his only son were to be married on the same day. On this  day Farmer Rodel was to give over his property to his son, and at this  wedding it was fated that Amrei should acquire a new name and be  introduced into a new life.    In the space before the large dancing-floor the children were assembled,  and while the grown-up people were dancing and enjoying themselves  within, the children were imitating them outside. But, strange to say,  no boy and no girl would dance with Amrei. No one knew who said it  first, but a voice was heard to call out:    \"No one will dance with you--you're Little Barefoot!\" and \"Barefoot!  Barefoot! Barefoot!\" was echoed on all sides. Amrei was ready to weep;  but here again she quickly made use of the power which enabled her to  ignore insult and injury. Suppressing her tears, she seized her apron by  the two ends and danced around by herself so gracefully and prettily,  that all the children stopped to look at her. And presently the grown-up  people were nodding to one another, and a circle of men and women was  formed around Amrei. Farmer Rodel, in particular, who on this day was  eating and drinking with double relish, snapped his fingers and whistled  the waltz the musicians were playing, while Amrei went on dancing and  seemed to know no weariness. When at last the music ceased, Farmer Rodel  took Amrei by the hand and said:    \"You clever girl, who taught you to do that so well?\"    \"Nobody.\"    \"Why don't you dance with any one?\"    \"It is better to dance alone--then one does not have to wait for  anybody, and has one's partner always at hand.\"    \"Have you had anything from the wedding yet?\" asked Farmer Rodel, with a  complacent smile.    \"No.\"    \"Then come in and eat,\" said the proud farmer; and he led the poor girl  into the house and sat her down at the wedding table, at which feasting  was going on all day long. Amrei did not eat much. Farmer Rodel, for a  jest, wanted to make the child tipsy, but Amrei said bravely:    \"If I drink more, I shall have to be led and shall not be able to walk  alone; and Marianne says 'alone' is the best conveyance, for then the  horses are always harnessed.\"    All were astonished at the child's wisdom.    Young Farmer Rodel came in with his wife and asked the child, to tease  her:    \"Have you brought us a wedding present? For if one eats so, one ought to  bring a wedding present.\"    The father-in-law, moved by an incomprehensible impulse of generosity,  secretly slipped a sixpenny piece into the child's hand. Amrei held the  coin fast in her palm, nodded to the old man, and said to the young  couple:    \"I have the promise and an earnest of payment; your deceased mother  always promised me that I should serve her, and that no one else should  be nurse to her first grand-child.\"    \"Yes, my wife always wished it,\" said the old farmer approvingly. And  what he had refused to do for his wife while she was alive, for fear of  having to provide for an orphan, he now did, now that he could no longer  please her with it, in order to make it appear before the people that  he was doing it out of respect for her memory. But even now he did it  not from kindness, but in the correct calculation that the orphan would  be serviceable to him, the deposed farmer who was her guardian; and the  burden of her maintenance, which would amount to more than her wages,  would fall on others and not on him.    The young couple looked at each other, and the man said:    \"Bring your bundle to our house tomorrow--you can live with us.\"    \"Very well,\" said Amrei, \"tomorrow I will bring my bundle. But now I  should like to take my bundle with me; give me a bottle of wine, and  this meat I will wrap up and take to Marianne and my Damie.\"    They let Amrei have her way; but old Farmer Rodel said to her secretly:    \"Give me back my sixpence--I thought you were going to give it up.\"    \"I'll keep that as an earnest from you,\" answered Amrei slyly; \"you  shall see, I will give you value for it.\" Farmer Rodel laughed to  himself half angrily, and Amrei went back to Black Marianne with money,  wine, and meat.    The house was locked; and there was a great contrast between the loud  music and noise and feasting at the wedding house, and the silence and  solitude here. Amrei knew where to wait for Marianne on her way home,  for the old woman very often went to the stone-quarry and sat there  behind a hedge for a long time, listening to the tapping of chisels and  mallets. It seemed to her like a melody, carrying her back to the times  when her John used to work there too; and so she often sat there,  listening and watching.    Sure enough, Amrei found Black Marianne there, and half an hour before  quitting time she called Damie up out of the quarry. And here among the  rocks a wedding feast was held, more merry than the one amid the noise  and music. Damie was especially joyful, and Marianne, too, was  unusually cheerful. But she would not drink a drop of the wine, for she  had declared that no wine should moisten her lips until she drank it at  her John's wedding. When Amrei told with glee how she had got a place at  young Farmer Rodel's, and was going there tomorrow, Black Marianne  started up in furious anger; picking up a stone and pressing it to her  bosom, she said:    \"It would be better a thousand times that I had this in me, a stone like  this, than a living heart! Why cannot I be alone? Why did I ever allow  myself to like anybody again? But now it's all over forever! You false,  faithless child! Hardly are you able to raise your wings, than off you  fly! But it is well. I am alone, and my John shall be alone, too, when  he comes--and what I have wished would come to pass, shall never be!\"    With that she ran off toward the village.    \"She's a witch, after all,\" said Damie when she had disappeared. \"I  won't drink the wine--who knows if she has not bewitched it?\"    \"You can drink it--she's only a strict Eigenbroetlerin and she has a  heavy cross to bear. I know how to win her back again,\" said Amrei,  consolingly.          CHAPTER VII    THE SISTER OF MERCY      During the next year there was plenty of life in Farmer Rodel's house.  \"Barefoot,\" for so Amrei was now called, was handy in every way, and  knew how to make herself liked by everybody; she could tell the young  farmer's wife, who had come to the place as a stranger, what the customs  of the village were; she studied the habits and characters of those  around her "]]]
