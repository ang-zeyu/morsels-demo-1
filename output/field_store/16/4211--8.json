Is it any wonder that \"she was in bitterness of soul\" and \"wept  sore\"? Her husband tenderly tries to comfort her. But her inner spirit  remains chafed to the quick. And all this goes on for years; the yearning,  the praying, the failure of answer, the biting, bitter atmosphere,--for  _years_. And she wonders why.    Why was it? Step back and up a bit and get the broader view which the  narrow limits of her surroundings, and shall I say, too, though not  critically, of her spirit, shut out from her eyes. Here is what she saw:  her fondest hope unrealized, long praying unanswered, a constant ferment  at home. Here is what she wanted:--_a son_. That is her horizon. Beyond  that her thought does not rise.    Here is what God saw:--a nation--no, much worse--_the_ nation, in which  centred His great love-plan for winning His prodigal world, going to  pieces. The messenger to the prodigal was being slyly, subtly seduced by  the prodigal. The saviour-nation was being itself lost. The plan so long  and patiently fostered for saving a world was threatened with utter  disaster.    Here is what He wanted--_a leader_! But there were no leaders. And, worse  yet, there were no men out of whom leaders might be made, no men of  leader-size. And worse yet _there were no women_ of the sort to train and  shape a man for leadership. That is the lowest level to which a people  ever gets, aye, ever _can_ get. God had to get a woman before He could get  a man. Hannah had in her the making of the woman He needed. God honoured  her by choosing her. But she must be changed before she could be used. And  so there came those years of pruning, and sifting, and discipline. Shall  we spell that word discipline with a final g instead of e--discipling, so  the love of it may be plainer to our near-sightedness? And out of those  years and experiences there came a new woman. A woman with vision  broadened, with spirit mellowed, with strength seasoned, with will so  sinewy supple as to yield to a higher will, to sacrifice the dearest  _personal pleasure_ for the world-wide purpose; willing that he who was  her dearest treasure should be the nation's _first_.    Then followed months of prayer while the man was coming. Samuel was born,  no, farther back yet, was conceived in the atmosphere of prayer and  devotion to God. The prenatal influences for those months gave the sort of  man God wanted. And a nation, _the_ nation, the _world-plan,_ was saved!  This man became a living answer to prayer. The romantic story of the  little boy up in the Shiloh tabernacle quickly spread over the nation. His  very name--Samuel, God hears--sifted into people's ears the facts of a  God, and of the power of prayer. The very sight of the boy and of the man  clear to the end kept deepening the brain impression through eyeballs that  God answers prayer. And the seeds of that re-belief in God that Samuel's  leadership brought about were sown by the unusual story of his birth.    _The answer was delayed that more might be given and gotten_. And Hannah's  exultant song of praise reveals the fineness to which the texture of her  nature had been spun. And it tells too how grateful she was for a God who  in great patience and of strong deliberate purpose delayed the answer to  her prayer.        <u>The Best Light for Studying a Thorn.</u>      The third great picture in this group is that of Paul and his  needle-pointed thorn. Talks about the certainty of prayer being answered  are very apt to bring this question: \"What about Paul's thorn?\" Sometimes  asked by earnest hearts puzzled; _some_times with a look in the eye almost  exultant as though of gladness for that thorn because it seems to help out  a theory. These pictures are put into the gallery for our help. Let us  pull up our chairs in front of this one and see what points we may get to  help our hearts.    First a look at Paul himself. The best light on this thorn is through the  man. The man explains the thorn. We have a halo about Paul's head; and  rightly, too. What a splendid man of God he was! God's chosen one for a  peculiar ministry. One of the twelve could be used to open the door to the  great outside world, but God had to go aside from this circle and get a  man of different training for this wider sphere. Cradled and schooled in a  Jewish atmosphere, he never lost the Jew standpoint, yet the training of  his home surroundings in that outside world, the contact with Greek  culture, his natural mental cast fitted him peculiarly for his appointed  task to the great outside majority. His keen reasoning powers, his vivid  imagination, his steel-like will, his burning devotion, his unmovable  purpose, his tender attachment to his Lord,--what a man! Well might the  Master want to win such a man for service' sake. But Paul had some weak  traits. Let us say it very softly, remembering as we instinctively will,  that where we think of one in him there come crowding to memory's door  many more in one's self. A man's weak point is usually the extreme  opposite swing of the pendulum on his strong point. Paul had a tremendous  will. He was a giant, a Hercules in his will. Those tireless journeys with  their terrific experiences, all spell out _will_ large and black. But,  gently now, he went to extremes here. Was it due to his overtired nerves?  Likely enough. He was obstinate, _sometimes;_ stubborn; set in his way:  _sometimes_ head down, jaw locked, driving hard. Say it all _softly_, for  we are speaking of dear old saintly Paul; but, to help, _say_ it, for it  is true.    God had a hard time holding Paul to _His_ plans. Paul had some of his own.  We can all easily understand that. Take a side glance or two as he is  pushing eagerly, splendidly on. Turn to that sixteenth chapter of  Acts,[19] and listen: \"Having been forbidden of the Holy Spirit to speak  the word in (the province of) Asia,\" coupled with the fact of sickness  being allowed to overtake him in Galatia where the \"forbidding\" message  came. And again this, \"they assayed to go into Bithynia; and the Spirit of  Jesus suffered them not.\"[20] Tell me, is this the way the Spirit of God  leads? That I should go driving ahead until He must pull me up with a  sharp turn, and twist me around! It is the way He is obliged to do many  times, no doubt, with most of us. But His chosen way? His own way? Surely  not. Rather this, the keeping close, and quiet and listening for the next  step. Rather the \"I go not up yet unto this feast\" of Jesus.[21] And then  in a few days going up, evidently when the clear intimation came. These  words, \"assayed to go,\" \"forbidden,\" \"suffered not\"--what flashlights they  let into this strong man's character.    But there is much stronger evidence yet. Paul had an ambition to preach to  the _Jerusalem Jews_. It burned in his bones from the early hours of his  new life. The substratum of \"_Jerusalem_\" seemed ever in his thoughts and  dreams. If _he_ could just get to those Jerusalem Jews! He knew them. He  had trained with them. He was a leader among the younger set. When they  burned against these Christians he burned just a bit hotter. They knew  him. They trusted him to drive the opposite wedge. If only _he_ could have  a chance down there he felt that the tide might be turned. But from that  critical hour on the Damascene road \"_Gentiles--Gentiles_\" had been  sounded in his ears. And he obeyed, of course he obeyed, with all his  ardent heart. _But, but_--those _Jerusalem Jews_! If he might go to  Jerusalem! Yet very early the Master had proscribed the Jerusalem service  for Paul. He made it a matter of a special vision,[22] in the holy temple,  kindly explaining why. \"They will not receive of _thee_ testimony  concerning Me.\" Would that not seem quite sufficient? Surely. Yet this  astonishing thing occurs:--Paul attempts to argue with the Master _why_ he  should be allowed to go. This is going to great lengths; a subordinate  arguing with his commanding general after the orders have been issued! The  Master closes the vision with a peremptory word of command, \"_depart_. I  will send thee _far hence_ (from Jerusalem, where you long to be), to the  Gentiles.\" That is a picture of this man. It reveals the weak side in  this giant of strength and of love. And _this_ is the man God has to use  in His plan. He is without doubt the best man available. And in his  splendour he stands head and shoulders above his generation and many  generations. Yet (with much reverence) God has a hard time getting Paul to  work always along the line of _His_ plans.    That is the man. Now for the thorn. Something came into Paul's life that  was a constant irritation. He calls it a thorn. What a graphic word! A  sharp point prodding into his flesh, ever prodding, sticking, sticking in;  asleep, awake, stitching tent canvas, preaching, writing, that thing ever  cutting its point into his sensitive flesh. Ugh! It did not disturb him so  much at first, because _there was God_ to go to. He went to God and said,  \"_Please_ take this away.\" But it stayed and stuck. A second time the  prayer; a bit more urgent; the thing sticks so. The time test is the  hardest test of all. Still no change. Then praying the third time with  what earnestness one can well imagine.    Now note three things: First, _There was an answer_. God answered _the  man_. Though He did not grant the petition, He answered the man. He did  not ignore him nor his request. Then God told Paul frankly that it was not  best to take the thorn away. It was in the lonely vigil of a sleepless  night, likely as not, that the wondrous Jesus-Spirit drew near to Paul.  Inaudibly to outer ear but very plainly to his inner ear, He spoke in  tones modulated into tender softness as of dearest friend talking with  dear friend. \"Paul,\" the voice said, \"I know about that thorn--and how it  hurts--it hurts Me, too.

The scene of a few days ago comes unbidden to my mind.  Tramp, tramp, tramp, the soldiers are marching.  Where are many of my old  friends and comrades, whose names were so familiar at every roll call,  and whose familiar \"Here\" is no more?  They lie yonder at Perryville,  unburied, on the field of battle.  They lie where they fell.  More than  three hundred and fifty members of my regiment, the First Tennessee,  numbered among the killed and wounded--one hundred and eighty-five slain  on the field of battle.  Who are they?  Even then I had to try to think  up the names of all the slain of Company H alone.  Their spirits seemed  to be with us on the march, but we know that their souls are with their  God.  Their bones, today, no doubt, bleach upon the battlefield.  They  left their homes, families, and loved ones a little more than one short  twelve months ago, dressed in their gray uniforms, amid the applause and  cheering farewells of those same friends.  They lie yonder; no friendly  hands ever closed their eyes in death; no kind, gentle, and loving mother  was there to shed a tear over and say farewell to her darling boy;  no sister's gentle touch ever wiped the death damp from off their dying  brows.  Noble boys; brave boys!  They willingly gave their lives to their  country's cause.  Their bodies and bones are mangled and torn by the rude  missiles of war.  They sleep the sleep of the brave.  They have given  their all to their country.  We miss them from our ranks.  There are no  more hard marches and scant rations for them.  They have accomplished all  that could be required of them.  They are no more; their names are soon  forgotten.  They are put down in the roll-book as killed.  They are  forgotten.  We will see them no more until the last reveille on the last  morning of the final resurrection.  Soldiers, comrades, friends, noble  boys, farewell we will meet no more on earth, but up yonder some day we  will have a grand reunion.      KNOXVILLE    The first night after crossing Cumberland Gap--I have forgotten the date,  but I know it was very early in the fall of the year; we had had no  frost or cold weather, and our marches all through Kentucky had been  characterized by very dry weather, it not having rained a drop on us  during the whole time--about four o'clock in the morning it began to snow,  and the next morning the ground was covered with a deep snow; the trees  and grass and everything of the vegetable kingdom still green.    When we got back to Knoxville we were the lousiest, dirtiest, raggedest  looking Rebels you ever saw.  I had been shot through the hat and  cartridge-box at Perryville, and had both on, and the clothing I then had  on was all that I had in the world.  William A. Hughes and I were walking  up the street looking at the stores, etc., when we met two of the  prettiest girls I ever saw.  They ran forward with smiling faces, and  seemed very glad to see us.  I thought they were old acquaintances of  Hughes, and Hughes thought they were old acquaintances of mine.  We were  soon laughing and talking as if we had been old friends, when one of the  young ladies spoke up and said, \"Gentlemen, there is a supper for the  soldiers at the Ladies' Association rooms, and we are sent out to bring  in all the soldiers we can find.\"  We spoke up quickly and said, \"Thank  you, thank you, young ladies,\" and I picked out the prettiest one and  said, \"Please take my arm,\" which she did, and Hughes did the same with  the other one, and we went in that style down the street.  I imagine we  were a funny looking sight.  I know one thing, I felt good all over,  and as proud as a boy with his first pants, and when we got to that  supper room those young ladies waited on us, and we felt as grand as  kings.  To you, ladies, I say, God bless you!      AH, \"SNEAK\"    Almost every soldier in the army--generals, colonels, captains, as well  as privates--had a nick-name; and I almost believe that had the war  continued ten years, we would have forgotten our proper names.  John  T. Tucker was called \"Sneak,\" A. S. Horsley was called \"Don Von One  Horsley,\" W. A. Hughes was called \"Apple Jack,\" Green Rieves was called  \"Devil Horse,\" the surgeon of our regiment was called \"Old Snake,\"  Bob Brank was called \"Count,\" the colonel of the Fourth was called \"Guide  Post,\" E. L. Lansdown was called \"Left Tenant,\" some were called by  the name of \"Greasy,\" some \"Buzzard,\" others \"Hog,\" and \"Brutus,\" and  \"Cassius,\" and \"Caesar,\" \"Left Center,\" and \"Bolderdust,\" and \"Old  Hannah;\" in fact, the nick-names were singular and peculiar, and when a  man got a nick-name it stuck to him like the Old Man of the Sea did to  the shoulders of Sinbad, the sailor.    On our retreat the soldiers got very thirsty for tobacco (they always  used the word thirsty), and they would sometimes come across an old field  off which the tobacco had been cut and the suckers had re-sprouted from  the old stalk, and would cut off these suckers and dry them by the fire  and chew them.  \"Sneak\" had somehow or other got hold of a plug or two,  and knowing that he would be begged for a chew, had cut it up in little  bits of pieces about one-fourth of a chew.  Some fellow would say, \"Sneak,  please give me a chew of tobacco.\"  Sneak would say, \"I don't believe  I have a piece left,\" and then he would begin to feel in his pockets.  He would pull that hand out and feel in another pocket, and then in his  coat pockets, and hid away down in an odd corner of his vest pocket he  would accidentally find a little chew, just big enough to make \"spit  come.\"  Sneak had his pockets full all the time.  The boys soon found  out his inuendoes and subterfuges, but John would all the time appear as  innocent of having tobacco as a pet lamb that has just torn down a nice  vine that you were so careful in training to run over the front porch.  Ah, John, don't deny it now!      I JINE THE CAVALRY    When we got to Charleston, on the Hiwassee river, there we found the  First Tennessee Cavalry and Ninth Battalion, both of which had been made  up principally in Maury county, and we knew all the boys.  We had a  good old-fashioned handshaking all around.  Then I wanted to \"jine the  cavalry.\"  Captain Asa G. Freeman had an extra horse, and I got on him  and joined the cavalry for several days, but all the time some passing  cavalryman would make some jocose remark about \"Here is a webfoot who  wants to jine the cavalry, and has got a bayonet on his gun and a  knapsack on his back.\"  I felt like I had got into the wrong pen, but  anyhow I got to ride all of three days.  I remember that Mr. Willis  B. Embry gave me a five-pound package of Kallickanick smoking tobacco,  for which I was very grateful.  I think he was quartermaster of the First  Tennessee Cavalry, and as good a man and as clever a person as I ever  knew.  None knew him but to love him.  I was told that he was killed by  a lot of Yankee soldiers after he had surrendered to them, all the time  begging for his life, asking them please not kill him.  But He that  noteth the sparrow's fall doeth all things well.  Not one ever falls to  the ground with His consent.          CHAPTER VI    MURFREESBORO      We came from Knoxville to Chattanooga, and seemed destined to make a  permanent stay here.  We remained several months, but soon we were on the  tramp again.    From Chattanooga, Bragg's army went to Murfreesboro.    The Federal army was concentrating at Nashville.  There was no rest for  the weary.  Marches and battles were the order of the day.    Our army stopped at Murfreesboro.  Our advanced outpost was established  at Lavergne.  From time to time different regiments were sent forward  to do picket duty.  I was on picket at the time the advance was made by  Rosecrans.  At the time mentioned, I was standing about two hundred yards  off the road, the main body of the pickets being on the Nashville and  Murfreesboro turnpike, and commanded by Lieutenant Hardy Murfree, of the  Rutherford Rifles.    I had orders to allow no one to pass.  In fact, no one was expected to  pass at this point, but while standing at my post, a horseman rode up  behind me.  I halted him, and told him to go down to the main picket on  the road and pass, but he seemed so smiling that I thought he knew me,  or had a good joke to tell me.  He advanced up, and pulling a piece of  paper out of his pocket, handed it to me to read.  It was an order from  General Leonidas Polk to allow the bearer to pass.  I read it, and looked  up to hand it back to him, when I discovered that he had a pistol cocked  and leveled in my face, and says he, \"Drop that gun; you are my prisoner.\"  I saw there was no use in fooling about it.  I knew if I resisted he  would shoot me, and I thought then that he was about to perform that  detestable operation.  I dropped the gun.    I did not wish to spend my winter in a Northern prison, and what was  worse, I would be called a deserter from my post of duty.    The Yankee picket lines were not a half mile off.  I was perfectly  willing to let the spy go on his way rejoicing--for such he was--but he  wanted to capture a Rebel.    And I had made up my mind to think likewise.  There I was, a prisoner  sure, and no mistake about it.    His pistol was leveled, and I was ordered to march.  I was afraid to  halloo to the relief, and you may be sure I was in a bad fix.    Finally says I, \"Let's play quits.  I think you are a soldier; you look  like a gentleman.  I am a videt; you know the responsibility resting on  me.  You go your way, and leave me here.  Is it a bargain?\"    Says he, \"I would not trust a Secesh on his word, oath, or bond.  March,  I say.\"    I soon found out that he had caught sight of the relief on the road,  and was afraid to shoot.  I quickly made up my mind.  My gun was at my  feet, and one step would get it.  I made a quick glance over my"]]]
