Hence it is only natural that the diversity of opinion  allowed by the grace of Allah now shows itself on a greater scale than ever  before.        III    THE POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT OF ISLAM      In the first period of Islam, the functions of what we call Church and  what we call State were exercised by the same authority. Its political  development is therefore of great importance for the understanding of its  religious growth.    The Prophet, when he spoke in the name of God, was the lawgiver of his  community, and it was rightly understood by the later Faithful that his  indispensable explanations of God's word had also legislative power. From  the time of the Hijrah the nature of the case made him the ruler, the  judge, and the military commander of his theocratic state. Moreover, Allah  expressly demanded of the Moslims that they should obey \"the Messenger  of God, and those amongst them who have authority.\"[1] We see by this  expression that Mohammed shared his temporal authority with others. His  co-rulers were not appointed, their number was nowhere defined, they were  not a closed circle; they were the notables of the tribes or other groups  who had arrayed themselves under Mohammed's authority, and a few who had  gained influence by their personality. In their councils Mohammed's word  had no decisive power, except when he spoke in the name of Allah; and we  know how careful he was to give oracles only in cases of extreme need.    [Footnote 1: Qoran, iv., 62.]    In the last years of Mohammed's life his authority became extended over a  large part of Arabia; but he did very little in the way of centralization  of government. He sent _'amils, i.e._, agents, to the conquered tribes  or villages, who had to see that, in the first place, the most important  regulations of the Qoran were followed, and, secondly, that the tax into  which the duty of almsgiving had been converted was promptly paid, and  that the portion of it intended for the central fund at Medina was duly  delivered. After the great conquests, the governors of provinces of the  Moslim Empire, who often exercised a despotic power, were called by the  same title of _'amils_. The agents of Mohammed, however, did not possess  such unlimited authority. It was only gradually that the Arabs learned the  value of good discipline and submission to a strong guidance, and adopted  the forms of orderly government as they found them in the conquered lands.    Through the death of Mohammed everything became uncertain. The combination  under one leadership of such a heterogeneous mass as that of his Arabs  would have been unthinkable a few years before. It became quite natural,  though, as soon as the Prophet's mouth was recognized as the organ of  Allah's voice. Must this monarchy be continued after Allah's mouthpiece had  ceased to exist? It was not at all certain. The force of circumstances and  the energy of some of Mohammed's counsellors soon led to the necessary  decisions. A number of the notables of the community succeeded in forcing  upon the hesitating or unwilling members the acceptance of the monarchy as  a permanent institution. There must be a khalif, a deputy of the Prophet in  all his functions (except that of messenger of God), who would be ruler  and judge and leader of public worship, but above all _amir al-mu'minin_,  \"Commander of the Faithful,\" in the struggle both against the apostate  Arabs and against the hostile tribes on the northern border.    But for the military success of the first khalifs Islam would never have  become a universal religion. Every exertion was made to keep the troops of  the Faithful complete. The leaders followed only Mohammed's example  when they represented fighting for Allah's cause as the most enviable  occupation. The duty of military service was constantly impressed upon the  Moslims; the lust of booty and the desire for martyrdom, to which the Qoran  assigned the highest reward, were excited to the utmost. At a later period,  it became necessary in the interests of order to temper the result of this  excitement by traditions in which those of the Faithful who died in the  exercise of a peaceful, honest profession were declared to be witnesses to  the Faith as well as those who were slain in battle against the enemies of  God,--traditions in which the real and greater holy war was described as  the struggle against evil passions. The necessity of such a mitigating  reaction, the spirit in which the chapters on holy war of Mohammedan  lawbooks are conceived, and the galvanizing power which down to our own day  is contained in a call to arms in the name of Allah, all this shows that  in the beginning of Islam the love of battle had been instigated at the  expense of everything else.    The institution of the Khalifate had hardly been agreed upon when the  question of who should occupy it became the subject of violent dissension.  The first four khalifs, whose reigns occupied the first thirty years after  Mohammed's death, were Qoraishites, tribesmen of the Prophet, and moreover  men who had been his intimate friends. The sacred tradition relates a  saying of Mohammed: \"The _imams_ are from Qoraish,\" intended to confine the  Khalifate to men from that tribe. History, however, shows that this edict  was forged to give the stamp of legality to the results of a long political  struggle. For at Mohammed's death the Medinese began fiercely contesting  the claims of the Qoraishites; and during the reign of Ali, the fourth  Khalif, the Kharijites rebelled, demanding, as democratic rigorists, the  free election of khalifs without restriction to the tribe of Qoraish or to  any other descent. Their standard of requirements contained only religious  and moral qualities; and they claimed for the community the continual  control of the chosen leader's behaviour and the right of deposing him  as soon as they found him failing in the fulfilment of his duties. Their  anarchistic revolutions, which during more than a century occasionally gave  much trouble to the Khalifate, caused Islam to accentuate the aristocratic  character of its monarchy. They were overcome and reduced to a sect, the  survivors of which still exist in South-Eastern Arabia, in Zanzibar, and in  Northern Africa; however, the actual life of these communities resembles  that of their spiritual forefathers to a very remote degree.    Another democratic doctrine, still more radical than that of the  Kharijites, makes even non-Arabs eligible for the Khalifate. It must have  had a considerable number of adherents, for the tradition which makes the  Prophet responsible for it is to be found in the canonic collections. Later  generations, however, rendered it harmless by exegesis; they maintained  that in this text \"commander\" meant only subordinate chiefs, and not \"the  Commander of the Faithful.\" It became a dogma in the orthodox Mohammedan  world, respected up to the sixteenth century, that only members of the  tribe of Qoraish could take the place of the Messenger of God.    The chance of success was greater for the legitimists than for the  democratic party. The former wished to make the Khalifate the privilege  of Ali, the cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet, and his descendants. At  first the community did not take much notice of that \"House of Mohammed\";  and it did not occur to any one to give them a special part in the  direction of affairs. Ali and Fatima themselves asked to be placed in  possession only of certain goods which had belonged to Mohammed, but which  the first khalifs would not allow to be regarded as his personal property;  they maintained that the Prophet had had the disposal of them not as owner,  but as head of the state. This narrow greed and absence of political  insight seemed to be hereditary in the descendants of Ali and Fatima; for  there was no lack of superstitious reverence for them in later times, and  if one of them had possessed something of the political talent of the best  Omayyads and Abbasids he would certainly have been able to supplant them.    After the third Khalif, Othman, had been murdered by his political  opponents, Ali became his successor; but he was more remote than any of his  predecessors from enjoying general sympathy. At that time the Shi'ah, the  \"Party\" of the House of the Prophet, gradually arose, which maintained that  Ali should have been the first Khalif, and that his descendants should  succeed him. The veneration felt for those descendants increased in the  same proportion as that for the Prophet himself; and moreover, there  were at all times malcontents, whose advantage would be in joining any  revolution against the existing government. Yet the Alids never succeeded  in accomplishing anything against the dynasties of the Omayyads, the  Abbasids, and the Ottomans, except in a few cases of transitory importance  only.    The Fatimite dynasty, of rather doubtful descent, which ruled a part  of Northern Africa and Egypt in the tenth century A.D., was completely  suppressed after some two and a half centuries. The Sherifs who have ruled  Morocco for more than 950 years were not chiefs of a party that considered  the legality of their leadership a dogma; they owe their local Khalifate  far more to the out-of-the-way position of their country which prevented  Abbasids and Turks from meddling with their affairs. Otherwise, they would  have been obliged at any rate to acknowledge the sovereignty of the Great  Lord of Constantinople. This was the case with the Sherifs of Mecca, who  ever since the twelfth century have regarded the sacred territory as their  domain. Their principality arose out of the general political disturbance  and the division of the Mohammedan empire into a number of kingdoms, whose  mutual strife prevented them from undertaking military operations in the  desert. These Sherifs raised no claim to the Khalifate; and the Shi'itic  tendencies they displayed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10166"],[0,"What Germany Thinks; Or, The War as Germans see it (#12)"],[1,"of the last century and a half; no, that work has been  going on for nearly a thousand years.'    \"What is the spirit of our German mysticism, the spirit of Eckhart and  Tauler, except: Drunkenness of the soul in a waking condition? The  accepted law on which all great German deeds rest, is: to dovetail  enthusiasm with discipline and order. From our Gothic, through German  _barock_ to Frederick the Great and Kant, on to the classical  period--what does all that mean if it is not the architecture of one  huge feeling? The soul runs riot in its imaginings and therewith the  intellect builds. The ravings of the soul provide the materials with  which the mind builds.    \"What is German music from Bach to Beethoven and from Beethoven to  Wagner--yes, even to Richard Strauss--but enthusiasm with discipline?  German music has been our mobilization; it has gone on just as in a  _partitur_ by Richard Wagner--absolute rapture with perfect precision!    \"Hence when we saw the miracle of this mobilization--all Germany's  military manhood packed in railway trains, rolling through the land, day  by day and night after night, never a minute late and never a question  for which the right answer was not ready and waiting--when we saw all  this, we were not astonished, because it was no miracle; it was nothing  other than a natural result of a thousand years of work and preparation;  it was the net profit of the whole of German history.    \"At the German mobilization not only our brave soldiers, reserves and  militia (_Landwehrmaenner und Landstuermler_) entered the field, but the  whole of Germany's historic past marched with them. It was this which  inspired the unshakable confidence which has endured from the first day  of war. In truth, the dear Fatherland has every reason to be calm.    \"In the meantime something more has happened: all in a moment we became  Germans! We held our breaths when the Kaiser uttered these words. This  too arose out of the deepest depths of Germany's yearnings; it sounded  like an eagle-cry of our most ancient longings. Germany's soul has long  pined to tear itself from its narrow confines (_verwerden_, as Eckhart,  or _sich entselbsten_, as Goethe put it), to lay aside self-will and  sacrifice itself, to be absorbed in the whole, and yet still to serve  (Wagner). And this eternal German yearning had never reached fulfilment,  but self-interest and egoism have always been stronger; every German has  been at war with all the others. 'For every man to go his own way,' said  Goethe, 'is the peculiar characteristic of the German race. I have never  seen them united except in their hate for Napoleon. I am curious to see  what they will do when he is banished to the other side of the Rhine.'  And Goethe was right: no sooner was the land freed from the oppressor,  than each began again to think and act only for himself. Hence, when we  first learned of the Kaiser's words we felt almost a joyous fear. If it  were only true that now there were only Germans! But on the very next  day our eyes saw and our ears heard that at last there were only  Germans, and with that, all pain and fear was forgotten. If war is  awful, even a just war, a holy war--even for the victor too, we will  endure all that, for it is as nothing; no sacrifice is too great for  this prize--that we are all only Germans.    \"Since the Emperor spoke those words three months have passed, and there  have only been Germans in the land. These three months have brought much  sorrow to German hearts, for there is hardly a home which does not  lament a father, a son, or a brother. Nevertheless, one may say that  since our existence as a nation, Germany has never been more joyous, in  the best sense of the word, than in this time of suffering. Through our  tears the noblest joy has shone; not alone at the success of our arms;  it is not from pride at fighting against a world of enemies; it is not  the fact that we are now assured of a future which in July last we could  not have imagined; it is not the feeling of power, of which even we  ourselves did not know. That shining joy springs from deeper reasons. We  are glad because we have found each other; we did not know each other  before. Indeed, no one knew himself. Now we know each other, and above  all, each knows himself.    \"It was Bismarck who uttered these terrible words: 'When the unoccupied  German must give up the struggle and strife which has become dear to  him, and offer the hand of reconciliation, then he loses all joy in  life. Civil war is always the most terrible thing which any land can  have. But with us Germans it is still more terrible, because it is  fought out by us with more love for the strife than any other war.'    \"Does it not sound truly horrible for the greatest benefactor of a  nation, which has to thank him for having realized its century-old dream  of unity, to say in all calm and as something quite obvious, that his  own nation engages in a civil war 'with more love' than any other war?  And wherever we look in Bismarck's speeches, the same complaint is found  which had been the eternal lamentation of Goethe--the lament over the  lack of faith and will of the Germans.    \"How will it be this time? Will it be as after the Seven Years' War,  after the War of Liberation, after 1870? Will it be again all in vain?  As soon as the Fatherland is secure, will every German once again cease  to be a German in order to become some kind of -crat or -ist or -er?  This time it will be more difficult, for from this war he will return no  more into the same Fatherland. It will have expanded; the German  Fatherland will be greater. Arndt's poems must be written over again: no  longer merely 'as far as the German tongue is spoken.' Germany will  stretch beyond that limit, and in it the German will have work to do.    \"In his speech Bismarck spoke of the 'unoccupied'; but in all  probability after this war, for years to come, there will be no  'unoccupied' Germans. They will be fully occupied with the new  organization. What the sword has won, we shall keep. 'The pike in the  European carp-pond,' said Bismarck once, 'prevent us from becoming carp.  They compel us to exertions which voluntarily we should hardly be  willing to make. They compel us to hold together, which is in direct  contradiction to our innermost nature.'    \"As we cannot change our nature, it will be good if we take over for  good and all a number--a very considerable number,--of these European  pike. That will occupy the German peasant and give an outlet to his  superfluous energies. There will be no leisure-energy to discharge  itself in party strife. Further, we must build Europe up again. It stood  on rotten foundations, and now it has fallen to pieces. We shall erect  it again on a German basis, and there will be work enough.\"[30]    [Footnote 30: Hermann Bahr: \"Kriegssegen\" (\"The Blessings of War\").  Published in Munich, 1915, p. 5 _et seq_.]          CHAPTER V    WARS AND RUMOURS OF WARS      It would be more than human if the German nation had actually realized  the lyrical picture painted by two well-known writers in the preceding  chapter. German newspapers, it is true, prove that the national unity so  loudly acclaimed was no empty word; moreover, they show conclusively  that grumblers and half-hearted enthusiasts were not lacking. It would  probably be more correct to describe them as \"sober-minded patriots.\"  These elements had, however, to use a colloquialism, an \"exceedingly  rough time.\"    The author has already contended that the German is innately brutal, and  in proof thereof quoted the awful statistics of brutal crimes published  by the Imperial Statistic Office, Berlin. The present work will contain  a picture of the natural unfolding of this \"innate brutality\" in Germany  itself during war time, and on the battlefields of Belgium and France.    There is no doubt whatever that a systematic, officially-organized press  campaign was carried on to madden the people and arouse blood-lust,  successively against Russians, Belgians, French and English. One is  almost inclined to exclaim: Providence caused some of the fruits of this  blood-lashing to be reaped in Germany!    \"Yesterday evening in the Riebeckbraeu another free fight took place, and  quieter guests who refused to take part in the patriotic screaming of  the students and other mob elements were badly ill-treated.  Beer-glasses, ash-trays, chairs and other missiles were thrown about  freely. One man was struck on the back of the head with a beer-glass,  causing the blood to flow in streams. Helpless women, too, were beaten  and threatened.\"[31]    [Footnote 31: _Leipziger Volkszeitung_, August 1st, 1914.]    Three days later the same journal contained a public appeal from the  Mayor of Leipzig, begging the inhabitants to preserve public order: \"If  the disturbances in the streets, public houses, etc., should--contrary  to our expectations--continue, then we shall be compelled to take severe  steps to suppress them.\"    On the same page there is another report of similar scenes, in one of  which a workman was \"horribly ill-treated\" by eight others. The army  authorities were compelled to issue a still more drastic warning on  August 6th.    A victim reported his adventures in another Leipzig paper[32]: \"I have  just read your article admonishing the 'hot-heads' to keep cool. The  General commanding Leipzig has also warned members of the public not to  allow excitement to lead them to 'deeds of brutality and crime.' I am a  good German patriot, and yet nearly lost my life at the hands of my own  countrymen.\"    [Footnote 32: _Leipziger Neuesten Nachrichten_, August 9th.]    The \"good patriot\" then relates that during the week he had spent an  evening at a concert in a beer-garden. Patriotic music was the order of  the day, and as each national song was sung he stood up with the rest of  the company. Towards the close of the evening he "]]]
