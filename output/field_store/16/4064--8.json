[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/954"],[0,"Tom Swift and His War Tank; Or, Doing His Bit for Uncle Sam (#11)"],[1,"\" exclaimed the girl, in wonder.    \"Well, I didn't all at once,\" Tom answered, with a laugh.  \"It came by  degrees. I first got the idea when I heard of the British tanks.    \"When I had read how they went into action and what they accomplished  against the barbed wire entanglements, and how they crossed the  trenches, I concluded that a bigger tank, one capable of more speed,  say ten or twelve miles an hour, and one that could cross bigger  excavations--the English tanks up to this time can cross a ditch of  twelve feet--I thought that, with one made on such specifications, more  effective work could be done against the Germans.\"    \"And will yours do that?\" asked Ned. \"I mean will it do ten miles an  hour, and straddle over a wider ditch than twelve feet?\"    \"It'll do both,\" promptly answered Tom. \"We did a little better than  eleven miles an hour a while ago when I yelled to you to get out of the  way just now. It's true we weren't under good control, but the speed  had nothing to do with that. And as for going over a big ditch, I think  we straddled one about fourteen feet across back there, and we can do  better when I get my grippers to working.\"    \"Grippers!\" exclaimed Mary.    \"What kind of trench slang is that, Tom Swift?\" asked Mr. Damon.    \"Well, that's a new idea I'm going to try out It's something like  this,\" and while from a distant part of the interior of Tank A came the  sound of hammering, the young inventor rapidly drew a rough pencil  sketch.    It showed the tank in outline, much as appear the pictures of tanks  already in service--the former simile of two wedge-shaped pieces of  metal put together broad end to broad end, still holding good. From one  end of the tank, as Tom drew it, there extended two long arms of  latticed steel construction.    \"The idea is,\" said Tom, \"to lay these down in front of the tank, by  means of cams and levers operated from inside.  If we get to a ditch  which we can't climb down into and out again, or bridge with the belt  caterpillar wheels, we'll use the grippers. They'll be laid down,  taking a grip on the far side of the trench, and we'll slide across on  them.\"    \"And leave them there?\" asked Mr. Damon.    \"No, we won't leave them. We'll pick them up after we have passed over  them and use them in front again as we need them. A couple of extra  pairs of grippers may be carried for emergencies, but I plan to use the  same ones over and over again.\"    \"But what makes it go?\" asked Mary. \"I don't want all the details,  Tom,\" she said, with a smile, \"but I'd like to know what makes your  tank move.\"    \"I'll be able to show you in a little while,\" he answered.  \"But it may  be enough now if I tell you that the main power consists of two big  gasolene engines, one on either side.  They can be geared to operate  together or separately. And these engines turn the endless belts made  of broad, steel plates, on which the tank travels. The belts pass along  the outer edges of the tank longitudinally, and go around cogged wheels  at either end of the blunt noses.    \"When both belts travel at the same rate of speed the tank goes in a  straight line, though it can be steered from side to side by means of a  trailer wheel in the rear. Making one belt--one set of caterpillar  wheels, you know--go faster than the other will make the tank travel to  one side or the other, the turn being in the direction of the slowest  moving belt. In this way we can steer when the trailer wheels are  broken.\"    \"And what does your tank do except travel along, not minding a hail of  bullets?\" asked Mr. Nestor.    \"Well,\" answered Tom, \"it can do anything any other tank can do, and  then some more. It can demolish a good-sized house or heavy wall, break  down big trees, and chew up barbed-wire fences as if they were  toothpicks. I'll show you all that in due time. Just now, if the  repairs are finished, we can get back on the road--\"    At that moment a door leading into the compartment where Tom and his  friends were talking opened, and one of the workmen said:    \"A man outside asking to see you, Mr. Swift.\"    \"Pardon me, but I won't keep you a moment,\" interrupted a suave voice.  \"I happened to observe your tank, and I took the liberty of entering to  see--\"    \"Simpson!\" cried Ned Newton, as he recognized the man who had been up  the tree. \"It's that spy, Simpson, Tom!\"          Chapter XII    Bridging a Gap      Such surprise showed both on the face of Ned Newton and that of the man  who called himself Walter Simpson that it would be hard to say which  was in the greater degree. For a moment the newcomer stood as if he had  received all electric shock, and was incapable of motion. Then, as the  echoes of Ned's voice died away and the young bank clerk, being the  first to recover from the shock, made a motion toward the unwelcome and  uninvited intruder, Simpson exclaimed.    \"I will not bother now. Some other time will do as well.\"    Then, with a haste that could be called nothing less than precipitate,  he made a turn and fairly shot out of the door by which he had entered  the tank.    \"There he goes!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"Bless my speedometer, but there he  goes!\"    \"I'll stop him!\" cried Ned. \"We've got to find out more about him! I'll  get him, Tom!\"    Tom Swift was not one to let a friend rush alone into what might be  danger. He realized immediately what his chum meant when he called out  the identity of the intruder, and, wishing to clear up some of the  mystery of which he became aware when Schwen was arrested and the paper  showing a correspondence with this Simpson were found, Tom darted out  to try to assist in the capture.    \"He went this way!\" cried Ned, who was visible in the glare of the  searchlight that still played its powerful beams over the stern of the  tank, if such an ungainly machine can be said to have a bow and stern.  \"Over this way!\"    \"I'm with you!\" cried Tom. \"See if you can pick up that man who just  ran out of here!\" he cried to the operator of the searchlight in the  elevated observation section of what corresponded to the conning tower  of a submarine. This was a sort of lookout box on top of the tank,  containing, among other machines, the searchlight. \"Pick him up!\" cried  Tom.    The operator flashed the intense white beam, like a finger of light,  around in eccentric circles, but though this brought into vivid relief  the configuration of the field and road near which the tank was  stalled, it showed no running fugitive. Tom and Ned were  observed--shadows of black in the glare--by Mary and her friends in the  tank, but there was no one else.    \"Come on!\" cried Ned. \"We can find him, Tom!\"    But this was easier said than done. Even though they were aided by the  bright light, they caught no glimpse of the man who called himself  Simpson.    \"Guess he got away,\" said Tom, when he and Ned had circled about and  investigated many clumps of bushes, trees, stumps and other barriers  that might conceal the fugitive.    \"I guess so,\" agreed Ned. \"Unless he's hiding in what we might call a  shell crater.\"    \"Hardly that,\" and Tom smiled. \"Though if all goes well the men who  operate this tank later may be searching for men in real shell holes.\"    \"Is this one going to the other side?\" asked Ned, as the two walked  back toward the tank.    \"I hope it will be the first of my new machines on the Western front,\"  Tom answered. \"But I've still got to perfect it in some details and  then take it apart. After that, if it comes up to expectations, we'll  begin making them in quantities.\"    \"Did you get him?\" asked Mr. Damon eagerly, as the two young men came  back to join Mary and her friends.    \"No, he got away,\" Tom answered.    \"Did he try to blow up the tank?\" asked Mr. Nestor, who had an abnormal  fear of explosives. \"Was he a German spy?\"    \"I think he's that, all right,\" said Ned grimly. \"As to his endeavoring  to blow up Tom's tank, I believe him capable of it, though he didn't  try it to-night--unless he's planted a time bomb somewhere about, Tom.\"    \"Hardly, I guess,\" answered the young inventor. \"He didn't have a  chance to do that. Anyhow we won't remain here long.  Now, Ned, what  about this chap? Is he really the one you saw up in the tree?\"    \"I not only saw him but I felt him,\" answered Ned, with a rueful look  at his fingers. \"He stepped right on me. And when he came inside the  tank to-night I knew him at once. I guess he was as surprised to see me  as I was to see him.\"    \"But what was his object?\" asked Mr. Nestor.    \"He must have some connection with my old enemy, Blakeson,\" answered  Tom, \"and we know he's mixed up with Schwen. From the looks of him I  should say that this Simpson, as he calls himself, is the directing  head of the whole business. He looks to be the moneyed man, and the  brains of the plotters. Blakeson is smart, in a mechanical way, and  Schwen is one of the best machinists I've ever employed. But this  Simpson strikes me as being the slick one of the trio.\"    \"But what made him come here, and what did he want?\" asked Mary. \"Dear  me! it's like one of those moving picture plots, only I never saw one  with a tank in it before--I mean a tank like yours, Tom.\"    \"Yes, it is a bit like moving picture--especially chasing Simpson by  searchlight,\" agreed the young inventor. \"As to what he wanted, I  suppose he came to spy out some of my secret inventions--dad's and  mine. He's probably been hiding and sneaking around the works ever  since we arrested Schwen.  Some of my men have reported seeing  strangers about, but I have kept Shop Thirteen well guarded.    \"However, this fellow may have been waiting outside, and he may have  followed the tank when we started off a little while ago for the night  test. Then, when he saw our mishap and noticed that we were stalled, he  came in, boldly enough, thinking, I suppose, that, as I had never seen  him, he would take a chance on getting as much information"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/955"],[0,"The Patchwork Girl of Oz (#11)"],[1,"Krizzle-Kroo' to me.\"    \"Will that make you angry?\" inquired the boy.    \"Terribly angry.\"    \"What does it mean?\" asked Scraps.    \"I don't know; that's what makes me so angry,\" replied the Woozy.    He then stood close to the fence, with his head near one of the boards,  and Scraps called out \"Krizzle-Kroo!\" Then Ojo said \"Krizzle-Kroo!\" and  the Glass Cat said \"Krizzle-Kroo!\" The Woozy began to tremble with  anger and small sparks darted from his eyes. Seeing this, they all  cried \"Krizzle-Kroo!\" together, and that made the beast's eyes flash  fire so fiercely that the fence-board caught the sparks and began to  smoke. Then it burst into flame, and the Woozy stepped back and said  triumphantly:    \"Aha! That did the business, all right. It was a happy thought for you  to yell all together, for that made me as angry as I have ever been.  Fine sparks, weren't they?\"    \"Reg'lar fireworks,\" replied Scraps, admiringly.    In a few moments the board had burned to a distance of several feet,  leaving an opening big enough for them all to pass through. Ojo broke  some branches from a tree and with them whipped the fire until it was  extinguished.    \"We don't want to burn the whole fence down,\" said he, \"for the flames  would attract the attention of the Munchkin farmers, who would then  come and capture the Woozy again. I guess they'll be rather surprised  when they find he's escaped.\"    \"So they will,\" declared the Woozy, chuckling gleefully. \"When they  find I'm gone the farmers will be badly scared, for they'll expect me  to eat up their honey-bees, as I did before.\"    \"That reminds me,\" said the boy, \"that you must promise not to eat  honey-bees while you are in our company.\"    \"None at all?\"    \"Not a bee. You would get us all into trouble, and we can't afford to  have any more trouble than is necessary. I'll feed you all the bread  and cheese you want, and that must satisfy you.\"    \"All right; I'll promise,\" said the Woozy, cheerfully. \"And when I  promise anything you can depend on it, 'cause I'm square.\"    \"I don't see what difference that makes,\" observed the Patchwork Girl,  as they found the path and continued their journey. \"The shape doesn't  make a thing honest, does it?\"    \"Of course it does,\" returned the Woozy, very decidedly. \"No one could  trust that Crooked Magician, for instance, just because he is crooked;  but a square Woozy couldn't do anything crooked if he wanted to.\"    \"I am neither square nor crooked,\" said Scraps, looking down at her  plump body.    \"No; you're round, so you're liable to do anything,\" asserted the  Woozy. \"Do not blame me, Miss Gorgeous, if I regard you with suspicion.  Many a satin ribbon has a cotton back.\"    Scraps didn't understand this, but she had an uneasy misgiving that she  had a cotton back herself. It would settle down, at times, and make her  squat and dumpy, and then she had to roll herself in the road until her  body stretched out again.          Chapter Ten    Shaggy Man to the Rescue      They had not gone very far before Bungle, who had run on ahead, came  bounding back to say that the road of yellow bricks was just before  them. At once they hurried forward to see what this famous road looked  like.    It was a broad road, but not straight, for it wandered over hill and  dale and picked out the easiest places to go. All its length and  breadth was paved with smooth bricks of a bright yellow color, so it  was smooth and level except in a few places where the bricks had  crumbled or been removed, leaving holes that might cause the unwary to  stumble.    \"I wonder,\" said Ojo, looking up and down the road, \"which way to go.\"    \"Where are you bound for?\" asked the Woozy.    \"The Emerald City,\" he replied.    \"Then go west,\" said the Woozy. \"I know this road pretty well, for I've  chased many a honey-bee over it.\"    \"Have you ever been to the Emerald City?\" asked Scraps.    \"No. I am very shy by nature, as you may have noticed, so I haven't  mingled much in society.\"    \"Are you afraid of men?\" inquired the Patchwork Girl.    \"Me? With my heart-rending growl--my horrible, shudderful growl? I  should say not. I am not afraid of anything,\" declared the Woozy.    \"I wish I could say the same,\" sighed Ojo. \"I don't think we need be  afraid when we get to the Emerald City, for Unc Nunkie has told me that  Ozma, our girl Ruler, is very lovely and kind, and tries to help  everyone who is in trouble. But they say there are many dangers lurking  on the road to the great Fairy City, and so we must be very careful.\"    \"I hope nothing will break me,\" said the Glass Cat, in a nervous voice.  \"I'm a little brittle, you know, and can't stand many hard knocks.\"    \"If anything should fade the colors of my lovely patches it would break  my heart,\" said the Patchwork Girl.    \"I'm not sure you have a heart,\" Ojo reminded her.    \"Then it would break my cotton,\" persisted Scraps. \"Do you think they  are all fast colors, Ojo?\" she asked anxiously.    \"They seem fast enough when you run,\" he replied; and then, looking  ahead of them, he exclaimed: \"Oh, what lovely trees!\"    They were certainly pretty to look upon and the travelers hurried  forward to observe them more closely.    \"Why, they are not trees at all,\" said Scraps; \"they are just monstrous  plants.\"    That is what they really were: masses of great broad leaves which rose  from the ground far into the air, until they towered twice as high as  the top of the Patchwork Girl's head, who was a little taller than Ojo.  The plants formed rows on both sides of the road and from each plant  rose a dozen or more of the big broad leaves, which swayed continually  from side to side, although no wind was blowing. But the most curious  thing about the swaying leaves was their color. They seemed to have a  general groundwork of blue, but here and there other colors glinted at  times through the blue--gorgeous yellows, turning to pink, purple,  orange and scarlet, mingled with more sober browns and grays--each  appearing as a blotch or stripe anywhere on a leaf and then  disappearing, to be replaced by some other color of a different shape.  The changeful coloring of the great leaves was very beautiful, but it  was bewildering, as well, and the novelty of the scene drew our  travelers close to the line of plants, where they stood watching them  with rapt interest.    Suddenly a leaf bent lower than usual and touched the Patchwork Girl.  Swiftly it enveloped her in its embrace, covering her completely in its  thick folds, and then it swayed back upon its stem.    \"Why, she's gone!\" gasped Ojo, in amazement, and listening carefully he  thought he could hear the muffled screams of Scraps coming from the  center of the folded leaf. But, before he could think what he ought to  do to save her, another leaf bent down and captured the Glass Cat,  rolling around the little creature until she was completely hidden, and  then straightening up again upon its stem.    \"Look out,\" cried the Woozy. \"Run! Run fast, or you are lost.\"    Ojo turned and saw the Woozy running swiftly up the road. But the last  leaf of the row of plants seized the beast even as he ran and instantly  he disappeared from sight.    The boy had no chance to escape. Half a dozen of the great leaves were  bending toward him from different directions and as he stood hesitating  one of them clutched him in its embrace. In a flash he was in the dark.  Then he felt himself gently lifted until he was swaying in the air,  with the folds of the leaf hugging him on all sides.    At first he struggled hard to escape, crying out in anger: \"Let me go!  Let me go!\" But neither struggles nor protests had any effect whatever.  The leaf held him firmly and he was a prisoner.    Then Ojo quieted himself and tried to think. Despair fell upon him when  he remembered that all his little party had been captured, even as he  was, and there was none to save them.    \"I might have expected it,\" he sobbed, miserably. \"I'm Ojo the Unlucky,  and something dreadful was sure to happen to me.\"    He pushed against the leaf that held him and found it to be soft, but  thick and firm. It was like a great bandage all around him and he found  it difficult to move his body or limbs in order to change their  position.    The minutes passed and became hours. Ojo wondered how long one could  live in such a condition and if the leaf would gradually sap his  strength and even his life, in order to feed itself. The little  Munchkin boy had never heard of any person dying in the Land of Oz, but  he knew one could suffer a great deal of pain. His greatest fear at  this time was that he would always remain imprisoned in the beautiful  leaf and never see the light of day again.    No sound came to him through the leaf; all around was intense silence.  Ojo wondered if Scraps had stopped screaming, or if the folds of the  leaf prevented his hearing her. By and by he thought he heard a  whistle, as of some one whistling a tune. Yes; it really must be some  one whistling, he decided, for he could follow the strains of a pretty  Munchkin melody that Unc Nunkie used to sing to him. The sounds were  low and sweet and, although they reached Ojo's ears very faintly, they  were clear and harmonious.    Could the leaf whistle, Ojo wondered? Nearer and nearer came the sounds  and then they seemed to be just the other side of the leaf that was  hugging him.    Suddenly the whole leaf toppled and fell, carrying the boy with it, and  while he sprawled at full length the folds slowly relaxed and set him  free. He scrambled quickly to his feet and found that a strange man was  standing before him--a man so curious in appearance that the boy stared  with round eyes.    He was a big man, with shaggy whiskers, shaggy eyebrows, shaggy  hair--but kindly blue eyes that were gentle as those of a cow. On his  head was a green velvet hat with a jeweled band, which was all shaggy  around the brim. Rich but shaggy laces were at"]]]
