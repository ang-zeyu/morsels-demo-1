This is the spirit which is still pervading criminal  legislation, although there is a sort of eclectic compromise between the  old and the new. The classic school of criminology has substituted for  the old absolutist conceptions of justice the eclectic theory that  absolute justice has the right to punish, but a right modified by the  interests of civilized life in present society. This is the point  discussed in Italy in the celebrated controversy between Pasquale  Stanislao Mancini and Terencio Mamiani, in 1847. This is in substance  the theory followed by the classic criminologists who revised the penal  code, which public opinion considers incapable of protecting society  against the dangers of crime. And we have but to look about us in the  realities of contemporaneous life in order to see that the criminal code  is far from being a remedy against crime, that it remedies nothing,  because either premeditation or passion in the person of the criminal  deprive the criminal law of all prohibitory power. The deceptive faith  in the efficacy of criminal law still lives in the public mind, because  every normal man feels that the thought of imprisonment would stand in  his way, if he contemplated tomorrow committing a theft, a rape, or a  murder. He feels the bridle of the social sense. And the criminal code  lends more strength to it and holds him back from criminal actions. But  even if the criminal code did not exist, he would not commit a crime, so  long as his physical and social environment would not urge him in that  direction. The criminal code serves only to isolate temporarily from  social intercourse those who are not considered worthy of it. And this  punishment prevents the criminal for a while from repeating his criminal  deed. But it is evident that the punishment is not imposed until after  the deed has been done. It is a remedy directed against effects, but it  does not touch the causes, the roots, of the evil.    We may say that in social life penalties have the same relation to crime  that medicine has to disease. After a disease has developed in an  organism, we have recourse to a physician. But he cannot do anything  else but to reach the effects in some single individual. On the other  hand, if the individual and the collectivity had obeyed the rules of  preventive hygiene, the disease would have been avoided 90 times in 100,  and would have appeared only in extreme and exceptional cases, where a  wound or an organic condition break through the laws of health. Lack of  providence on the part of man, which is due to insufficient expression  of the forces of the intellect and pervades so large a part of human  life, is certainly to blame for the fact that mankind chooses to use  belated remedies rather than to observe the laws of health, which demand  a greater methodical control of one's actions and more foresight,  because the remedy must be applied before the disease becomes apparent.  I say occasionally that human society acts in the matter of criminality  with the same lack of forethought that most people do in the matter of  tooth-ache. How many individuals do not suffer from tooth-ache,  especially in the great cities? And yet any one convinced of the  miraculous power of hygiene could easily clean his teeth every day and  prevent the microbes of tooth rot from thriving, thereby saving his  teeth from harm and pain. But it is tedious to do this every day. It  implies a control of one's self. It cannot be done without the  scientific conviction that induces men to acquire this habit. Most  people say: \"Oh well, if that tooth rots, I'll bear the pain.\" But when  the night comes in which they cannot sleep for toothache, they will  swear at themselves for not having taken precautions and will run to the  dentist, who in most cases cannot help them any more.    The legislator should apply the rules of social hygiene in order to  reach the roots of criminality. But this would require that he should  bring his mind and will to bear daily on a legislative reform of  individual and social life, in the field of economics and morals as well  as in that of administration, politics, and intelligence. Instead of  that, the legislators permit the microbes of criminality to develop  their pathogenic powers in society. When crimes become manifest, the  legislator knows no other remedy but imprisonment in order to punish an  evil which he should have prevented. Unfortunately this scientific  conviction is not yet rooted and potent in the minds of the legislators  of most of the civilized countries, because they represent on an  average the backward scientific convictions of one or two previous  generations. The legislator who sits in parliament today was the  university student of 30 years ago. With a few very rare exceptions he  is supplied only with knowledge of outgrown scientific research. It is a  historical law that the work of the legislator is always behind the  science of his time. But nevertheless the scientist has the urgent duty  to spread the conviction that hygiene is worth as much on the field of  civilization as it is in medicine for the public health.    This is the fundamental conviction at which the positive school arrives:  That which has happened in medicine will happen in criminology. The  great value of practical hygiene, especially of social hygiene, which is  greater than that of individual hygiene, has been recognized after the  marvelous scientific discoveries concerning the origin and primitive  causes of the most dangerous diseases. So long as Pasteur and his  disciples had not given to the world their discovery of the pathogenic  microbes of all infectious diseases, such as typhoid fever, cholera,  diphtheria, tuberculosis, etc, more or less absurd remedies were  demanded of the science of medicine. I remember, for instance, that I  was compelled in my youth, during an epidemic of cholera, to stay in a  closed room, in which fumigation was carried on with substances  irritating the bronchial tubes and lungs without killing the cholera  microbes, as was proved later on. It was not until the real causes of  those infectious diseases were discovered, that efficient remedies could  be employed against them. An aqueduct given to a center of population  like Naples is a better protection against cholera than drugs, even  after the disease has taken root in the midst of the people of Naples.  This is the modern lesson which we wish to teach in the field of  criminology, a field which will always retain its repressive functions  as an exceptional and ultimate refuge, because we do not believe that we  shall succeed in eliminating all forms of criminality. Hence, if a crime  manifests itself, repression may be employed as one of the remedies of  criminology, but it should be the very last, not the exclusively  dominating one, as it is today.    It is this blind worship of punishment which is to blame for the  spectacle which we witness in every modern country, the spectacle that  the legislators neglect the rules of social hygiene and wake up with a  start when some form of crime becomes acute, and that they know of no  better remedy than an intensification of punishment meeted out by the  penal code. If one year of imprisonment is not enough, we'll make it ten  years, and if an aggravation of the ordinary penalty is not enough,  we'll pass a law of exception. It is always the blind trust in  punishment which remains the only remedy of the public conscience and  which always works to the detriment of morality and material welfare,  because it does not save the society of honest people and strikes  without curing those who have fallen a prey to guilt and crime.    The positive school of criminology, then, aside from the greater value  attributed to daily and systematic measures of social hygiene for the  prevention of criminality, comes to radically different conclusions also  in the matter of repressive justice. The classic school has for a  cardinal remedy against crime a preference for one kind of punishment,  namely imprisonment, and gives fixed and prescribed doses of this  remedy. It is the logical conclusion of retributive justice that it  travels by way of an illusory purification from moral guilt to the legal  responsibility of the criminal and thence on to a corresponding dose of  punishment, which has been previously prescribed and fixed.    We, on the other hand, hold that even the surviving form of repression,  which will be inevitable in spite of the application of the rules of  social prevention, should be widely different, on account of the  different conception which we have of crime and of penal justice.    In the majority of cases composed of minor crimes committed by people  belonging to the most numerous and least dangerous class of occasional  or passionate criminals, the only form of civil repression will be _the  compensation of the victim for his loss_. According to us, this should  he the only form of penalty imposed in the majority of minor crimes  committed by people who are not dangerous. In the present practice of  justice the compensation of the victim for his loss has become a  laughing stock, because this victim is systematically forgotten. The  whole attention of the classic school has been concentrated on the  juridical entity of the crime. The victim of the crime has been  forgotten, although this victim deserves philanthropic sympathy more  than the criminal who has done the harm. It is true, every, judge adds  to the sentence the formula that the criminal is responsible for the  injury and the costs to another authority. But the process of law puts  off this compensation to an indefinite time, and if the victim succeeds  a few years after the passing of the sentence in getting any action on  the matter, the criminal has in the meantime had a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10586"],[0,"Mike and Psmith (#12)"],[1,"for three.    The crowd was now reluctantly dispersing to its own games, but it  stopped as Mr. Downing started his minuet-cakewalk, in the hope that it  might see something more sensational.    This time the hope was fulfilled.    The ball was well up, slow, and off the wicket on the on-side. Perhaps  if it had been allowed to pitch, it might have broken in and become  quite dangerous. Mike went out at it, and hit it a couple of feet from  the ground. The ball dropped with a thud and a spurting of dust in the  road that ran along one side of the cricket field.    It was returned on the installment system by helpers from other games,  and the bowler began his maneuvers again. A half volley this time. Mike  slammed it back, and mid on, whose heart was obviously not in the thing,  failed to stop it.    \"Get to them, Jenkins,\" said Mr. Downing irritably, as the ball came  back from the boundary. \"Get to them.\"    \"Sir, please, sir--\"    \"Don't talk in the field, Jenkins.\"    Having had a full pitch hit for six and a half volley for four, there  was a strong probability that Mr. Downing would pitch his next  ball short.    The expected happened. The third ball was a slow long hop, and hit the  road at about the same spot where the first had landed. A howl of  untuneful applause rose from the watchers in the pavilion, and Mike,  with the feeling that this sort of bowling was too good to be true,  waited in position for number four.    There are moments when a sort of panic seizes a bowler. This happened  now with Mr. Downing. He suddenly abandoned science and ran amok. His  run lost its stateliness and increased its vigor. He charged up to the  wicket as a wounded buffalo sometimes charges a gun. His whole idea now  was to bowl fast.    When a slow bowler starts to bowl fast, it is usually as well to be  batting, if you can manage it.    By the time the over was finished, Mike's score had been increased by  sixteen, and the total of his side, in addition, by three wides.    And a shrill small voice, from the neighborhood of the pavilion, uttered  with painful distinctness the words, \"Take him off!\"    That was how the most sensational day's cricket began that Sedleigh had  known.    A description of the details of the morning's play would be monotonous.  It is enough to say that they ran on much the same lines as the third  and fourth overs of the match. Mr. Downing bowled one more over, off  which Mike helped himself to sixteen runs, and then retired moodily to  cover point, where, in Adair's fifth over, he missed Barnes--the first  occasion since the game began on which that mild batsman had attempted  to score more than a single. Scared by this escape, Outwood's captain  shrank back into his shell, sat on the splice like a limpet, and,  offering no more chances, was not out at lunchtime with a score of  eleven. Mike had then made a hundred and three.           *       *       *       *       *    As Mike was taking off his pads in the pavilion, Adair came up.    \"Why did you say you didn't play cricket?\" he asked abruptly.    When one has been bowling the whole morning, and bowling well, without  the slightest success, one is inclined to be abrupt.    Mike finished unfastening an obstinate strap. Then he looked up.    \"I didn't say anything of the kind. I said I wasn't going to play here.  There's a difference. As a matter of fact, I was in the Wrykyn team  before I came here. Three years.\"    Adair was silent for a moment.    \"Will you play for us against the Old Sedleighans tomorrow?\" he said at  length.    Mike tossed his pads into his bag and got up.    \"No, thanks.\"    There was a silence.    \"Above it, I suppose?\"    \"Not a bit. Not up to it. I shall want a lot of coaching at that end net  of yours before I'm fit to play for Sedleigh.\"    There was another pause.    \"Then you won't play?\" asked Adair.    \"I'm not keeping you, am I?\" said Mike, politely.    It was remarkable what a number of members of Outwood's house appeared  to cherish a personal grudge against Mr. Downing. It had been that  master's somewhat injudicious practice for many years to treat his own  house as a sort of Chosen People. Of all masters, the most unpopular is  he who by the silent tribunal of a school is convicted of favoritism.  And the dislike deepens if it is a house which he favors and not merely  individuals. On occasions when boys in his own house and boys from other  houses were accomplices and partners in wrongdoing, Mr. Downing  distributed his thunderbolts unequally, and the school noticed it. The  result was that not only he himself, but also--which was rather  unfair--his house, too, had acquired a good deal of unpopularity.    The general consensus of opinion in Outwood's during the luncheon  interval was that having got Downing's up a tree, they would be fools  not to make the most of the situation.    Barnes's remark that he supposed, unless anything happened and wickets  began to fall a bit faster, they had better think of declaring somewhere  about half past three or four, was met with a storm of opposition.    \"Declare!\" said Robinson. \"Great Scot, what on earth are you talking  about?\"    \"Declare!\" Stone's voice was almost a wail of indignation. \"I never saw  such a chump.\"    \"They'll be rather sick if we don't, won't they?\" suggested Barnes.    \"Sick! I should think they would,\" said Stone. \"That's just the gay  idea. Can't you see that by a miracle we've got a chance of getting a  jolly good bit of our own back against those Downing's ticks? What we've  got to do is to jolly well keep them in the field all day if we can, and  be jolly glad it's so beastly hot. If they lose about a dozen pounds  each through sweating about in the sun after Jackson's drives, perhaps  they'll stick on less side about things in general in future. Besides, I  want an innings against that bilge of old Downing's, if I can get it.\"    \"So do I,\" said Robinson.    \"If you declare, I swear I won't field. Nor will Robinson.\"    \"Rather not.\"    \"Well, I won't then,\" said Barnes unhappily. \"Only you know they're  rather sick already.\"    \"Don't you worry about that,\" said Stone with a wide grin. \"They'll be a  lot sicker before we've finished.\"    And so it came about that that particular Mid-Term Service-Day match  made history. Big scores had often been put up on Mid-Term Service Day.  Games had frequently been one-sided. But it had never happened before in  the annals of the school that one side, going in first early in the  morning, had neither completed its innings nor declared it closed when  stumps were drawn at 6.30. In no previous Sedleigh match, after a full  day's play, had the pathetic words \"Did not bat\" been written against  the whole of one of the contending teams.    These are the things which mark epochs.    Play was resumed at 2.15. For a quarter of an hour Mike was  comparatively quiet. Adair, fortified by food and rest, was bowling  really well, and his first half dozen overs had to be watched carefully.  But the wicket was too good to give him a chance, and Mike, playing  himself in again, proceeded to get to business once more. Bowlers came  and went. Adair pounded away at one end with brief intervals between the  attacks. Mr. Downing took a couple more overs, in one of which a horse,  passing in the road, nearly had its useful life cut suddenly short.  Change bowlers of various actions and paces, each weirder and more  futile than the last, tried their luck. But still the first-wicket stand  continued.    The bowling of a house team is all head and no body. The first pair  probably have some idea of length and break. The first-change pair are  poor. And the rest, the small change, are simply the sort of things one  sees in dreams after a heavy supper, or when one is out without  one's gun.    Time, mercifully, generally breaks up a big stand at cricket before the  field has suffered too much, and that is what happened now. At four  o'clock, when the score stood at two hundred and twenty for no wicket,  Barnes, greatly daring, smote lustily at a rather wide half volley and  was caught at short slip for thirty-three. He retired blushfully to the  pavilion, amidst applause, and Stone came out.    As Mike had then made a hundred and eighty-seven, it was assumed by the  field, that directly he had topped his second century, the closure would  be applied and their ordeal finished. There was almost a sigh of relief  when frantic cheering from the crowd told that the feat had been  accomplished. The fieldsmen clapped in quite an indulgent sort of way,  as who should say, \"Capital, capital. And now let's start _our_  innings.\" Some even began to edge toward the pavilion.    But the next ball was bowled, and the next over, and the next after  that, and still Barnes made no sign. (The conscience stricken captain of  Outwood's was, as a matter of fact, being practically held down by  Robinson and other ruffians by force.)    A gray dismay settled on the field.    The bowling had now become almost unbelievably bad. Lobs were being  tried, and Stone, nearly weeping with pure joy, was playing an innings  of the \"How-to-brighten-cricket\" type. He had an unorthodox style, but  an excellent eye, and the road at this period of the game became  absolutely unsafe for pedestrians and traffic.    Mike's pace had become slower, as was only natural, but his score, too,  was mounting steadily.    \"This is foolery,\" snapped Mr. Downing, as the three hundred and fifty  went up on the board. \"Barnes!\" he called.    There was no reply. A committee of three was at that moment engaged in  sitting on Barnes's head in the first eleven changing room, in order to  correct a more than usually feverish attack of conscience.    \"Barnes!\"    \"Please, sir,\" said Stone, some species of telepathy telling him what  was detaining his captain. \"I think Barnes must have left the field. He  has probably gone over to the house to fetch something.\"    \"This"]]]
