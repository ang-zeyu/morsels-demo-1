That was all.\"    \"S'pose we take a look at him?\"    \"By all means. Just come along with me.\"    Elizabeth struck in.    \"Just a moment, Terence. There's Mr. Gainor, and he's been asking to see  you. You can take the sheriff out to see El Sangre later. Besides, half a  dozen people want to talk to the sheriff, and you mustn't monopolize him.  Miss Wickson begged me to get her a chance to talk to you--the real  Sheriff Minter. Do you mind?\"    \"Pshaw,\" said the sheriff. \"I ain't no kind of a hand at talking to the  womenfolk. Where is she?\"    \"Down yonder, sheriff. Shall we go?\"    \"The old lady with the cane?\"    \"No, the girl with the bright hair.\"    \"Doggone me,\" muttered the sheriff. \"Well, let's saunter down that way.\"    He waved to Terence, who, casting a black glance in the direction of Mr.  Gainor, went off to execute Elizabeth's errand. Plainly Elizabeth had won  the first engagement, but Vance was still confident. The dinner table  would tell the tale.        CHAPTER 11      Elizabeth left the ordering of the guests at the table to Vance, and she  consulted him about it as they went into the dining room. It was a long,  low-ceilinged room, with more windows than wall space. It opened onto a  small porch, and below the porch was the garden which had been the pride  of Henry Cornish. Beside the tall glass doors which led out onto the  porch she reviewed the seating plans of Vance. \"You at this end and I at  the other,\" he said. \"I've put the sheriff beside you, and right across  from the sheriff is Nelly. She ought to keep him busy. The old idiot has  a weakness for pretty girls, and the younger the better, it seems. Next  to the sheriff is Mr. Gainor. He's a political power, and what time the  sheriff doesn't spend on you and on Nelly he certainly will give to  Gainor. The arrangement of the rest doesn't matter. I simply worked to  get the sheriff well-pocketed and keep him under your eye.\"    \"But why not under yours, Vance? You're a thousand times more diplomatic  than I am.\"    \"I wouldn't take the responsibility, for, after all, this may turn out to  be a rather solemn occasion, Elizabeth.\"    \"You don't think so, Vance?\"    \"I pray not.\"    \"And where have you put Terence?\"    \"Next to Nelly, at your left.\"    \"Good heavens, Vance, that's almost directly opposite the sheriff. You'll  have them practically facing each other.\"    It was the main thing he was striving to attain. He placated her  carefully.    \"I had to. There's a danger. But the advantage is huge. You'll be there  between them, you might say. You can keep the table talk in hand at that  end. Flash me a signal if you're in trouble, and I'll fire a question  down the table at the sheriff or Terry, and get their attention. In the  meantime you can draw Terry into talk with you if he begins to ask the  sheriff what you consider leading questions. In that way, you'll keep the  talk a thousand leagues away from the death of Black Jack.\"    He gained his point without much more trouble. Half an hour later the  table was surrounded by the guests. It was a table of baronial  proportions, but twenty couples occupied every inch of the space easily.  Vance found himself a greater distance than he could have wished from the  scene of danger, and of electrical contact.    At least four zones of cross-fire talk intervened, and the talk at the  farther end of the table was completely lost to him, except when some new  and amazing dish, a triumph of Wu Chi's fabrication, was brought on, and  an appreciative wave of silence attended it.    Or again, the mighty voice of the sheriff was heard to bellow forth in  laughter of heroic proportions.    Aside from that, there was no information he could gather except by his  eyes. And chiefly, the face of Elizabeth. He knew her like a book in  which he had often read. Twice he read the danger signals. When the great  roast was being removed, he saw her eyes widen and her lips contract a  trifle, and he knew that someone had come very close to the danger line  indeed. Again when dessert was coming in bright shoals on the trays of  the Chinese servants, the glance of his sister fixed on him down the  length of the table with a grim appeal. He made a gesture of  helplessness. Between them four distinct groups into which the table talk  had divided were now going at full blast. He could hardly have made  himself heard at the other end of the table without shouting.    Yet that crisis also passed away. Elizabeth was working hard, but as the  meal progressed toward a close, he began to worry. It had seemed  impossible that the sheriff could actually sit this length of time in  such an assemblage without launching into the stories for which he was  famous. Above all, he would be sure to tell how he had started on his  career as a manhunter by relating how he slew Black Jack.    Once the appalling thought came to Vance that the story must have been  told during one of those moments when his sister had shown alarm. The  crisis might be over, and Terry had indeed showed a restraint which was a  credit to Elizabeth's training. But by the hunted look in her eyes, he  knew that the climax had not yet been reached, and that she was  continually fighting it away.    He writhed with impatience. If he had not been a fool, he would have  taken that place himself, and then he could have seen to it that the  sheriff, with dexterous guiding, should approach the fatal story. As it  was, how could he tell that Elizabeth might not undo all his plans and  cleverly keep the sheriff away from his favorite topic for an untold  length of time? But as he told his sister, he wished to place all the  seeming responsibility on her own shoulders. Perhaps he had played too  safe.    The first ray of hope came to him as coffee was brought in. The  prodigious eating of the cattlemen and miners at the table had brought  them to a stupor. They no longer talked, but puffed with unfamiliar  awkwardness at the fine Havanas which Vance had provided. Even the women  talked less, having worn off the edge of the novelty of actually dining  at the table of Elizabeth Cornish. And since the hostess was occupied  solely with the little group nearest her, and there was no guiding mind  to pick up the threads of talk in each group and maintain it, this duty  fell more and more into the hands of Vance. He took up his task with  pleasure.    Farther and farther down the table extended the sphere of his mild  influence. He asked Mr. Wainwright to tell the story of how he treed the  bear so that the tenderfoot author could come and shoot it. Mr.  Wainwright responded with gusto. The story was a success. He varied it by  requesting young Dobel to describe the snowslide which had wiped out the  Vorheimer shack the winter before.    Young Dobel did well enough to make the men grunt at the end, and he  brought several little squeals of horror from the ladies.    All of this was for a purpose. Vance was setting the precedent, and they  were becoming used to hearing stories. At the end of each tale the  silence of expectation was longer and wider. Finally, it reached the  other end of the table, and suddenly the sheriff discovered that tales  were going the rounds, and that he had not yet been heard. He rolled his  eye with an inward look, and Vance knew that he was searching for some  smooth means of introducing one of his yarns.    Victory!    But here Elizabeth cut trenchantly into the heart of the conversation.  She had seen and understood. She shot home half a dozen questions with  the accuracy of a marksman, and beat up a drumfire of responses from the  ladies which, for a time, rattled up and down the length of the table.  The sheriff was biting his mustache thoughtfully.    It was only a momentary check, however. Just at the point where Vance  began to despair of ever effecting his goal, the silence began again as  lady after lady ran out of material for the nonce. And as the silence  spread, the sheriff was visibly gathering steam.    Again Elizabeth cut in. But this time there was only a sporadic  chattering in response. Coffee was steaming before them, Wu Chi's  powerful, thick, aromatic coffee, which only he knew how to make. They  were in a mood, now, to hear stories, that tableful of people. An  expected ally came to the aid of Vance. It was Terence, who had been  eating his heart out during the silly table talk of the past few minutes.  Now he seized upon the first clear opening.    \"Sheriff Minter, I've heard a lot about the time you ran down Johnny  Garden. But I've never had the straight of it. Won't you tell us how it  happened?\"    \"Oh,\" protested the sheriff, \"it don't amount to much.\"    Elizabeth cast one frantic glance at her brother, and strove to edge into  the interval of silence with a question directed at Mr. Gainor. But he  shelved that question; the whole table was obviously waiting for the  great man to speak. A dozen appeals for the yarn poured in.    \"Well,\" said the sheriff, \"if you folks are plumb set on it, I'll tell  you just how it come about.\"    There followed a long story of how Johnny Garden had announced that he  would ride down and shoot up the sheriff's own town, and then get away on  the sheriff's own horse--and how he did it. And how the sheriff was  laughed at heartily by the townsfolk, and how the whole mountain district  joined in the laughter. And how he started out single-handed in the  middle of winter to run down Johnny Garden, and struck through the  mountains, was caught above the timberline in a terrific blizzard, kept  on in peril of his life until he barely managed to reach the timber again  on the other side of the ridge. How he descended upon the hiding-place of  Johnny Garden, found Johnny gone, but his companions there, and made a  bargain with them to let them go if they would"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9932"],[0,"The Last Trail (#11)"],[1,"softly.    Far up the broad Ohio a square patch showed dark against the green  water.    Colonel Zane saw Mabel start, and a dark red flush came over her pale  face. For an instant she gazed with an expression of appeal, almost  fear. He knew the reason. Alex Bennet was on that raft.    \"I came over to ask if I can be of any service?\"    \"Tell him,\" she answered simply.    \"I say, Betts,\" Colonel Zane cried, \"has Helen's cousin cast any more  such sheep eyes at you?\"    \"Oh, Eb, what nonsense!\" exclaimed Betty, blushing furiously.    \"Well, if he didn't look sweet at you I'm an old fool.\"    \"You're one anyway, and you're horrid,\" said Betty, tears of anger  glistening in her eyes.    Colonel Zane whistled softly as he walked down the lane. He went into  the wheelwright's shop to see about some repairs he was having made on  a wagon, and then strolled on down to the river. Two Indians were  sitting on the rude log wharf, together with several frontiersmen and  rivermen, all waiting for the raft. He conversed with the Indians, who  were friendly Chippewas, until the raft was tied up. The first person  to leap on shore was a sturdy young fellow with a shock of yellow  hair, and a warm, ruddy skin.    \"Hello, Alex, did you have a good trip?\" asked Colonel Zane of the  youth.    \"H'are ye, Colonel Zane. Yes, first-rate trip,\" replied young Bennet.  \"Say, I've a word for you. Come aside,\" and drawing Colonel Zane out  of earshot of the others, he continued, \"I heard this by accident, not  that I didn't spy a bit when I got interested, for I did; but the way  it came about was all chance. Briefly, there's a man, evidently an  Englishman, at Fort Pitt whom I overheard say he was out on the border  after a Sheppard girl. I happened to hear from one of Brandt's men,  who rode into Pitt just before we left, that you had new friends here  by that name. This fellow was a handsome chap, no common sort, but  lordly, dissipated and reckless as the devil. He had a servant  traveling with him, a sailor, by his gab, who was about the toughest  customer I've met in many a day. He cut a fellow in bad shape at Pitt.  These two will be on the next boat, due here in a day or so, according  to river and weather conditions, an' I thought, considerin' how  unusual the thing was, I'd better tell ye.\"    \"Well, well,\" said Colonel Zane reflectively. He recalled Sheppard's  talk about an Englishman. \"Alex, you did well to tell me. Was the man  drunk when he said he came west after a woman?\"    \"Sure he was,\" replied Alex. \"But not when he spoke the name. Ye see I  got suspicious, an' asked about him. It's this way: Jake Wentz, the  trader, told me the fellow asked for the Sheppards when he got off the  wagon-train. When I first seen him he was drunk, and I heard Jeff Lynn  say as how the border was a bad place to come after a woman. That's  what made me prick up my ears. Then the Englishman said: 'It is, eh?  By God! I'd go to hell after a woman I wanted.' An' Colonel, he  looked it, too.\"    Colonel Zane remained thoughtful while Alex made up a bundle and  forced the haft of an ax under the string; but as the young man  started away the colonel suddenly remembered his errand down to  the wharf.    \"Alex, come back here,\" he said, and wondered if the lad had good  stuff in him. The boatman's face was plain, but not evil, and a close  scrutiny of it rather prepossessed the colonel.    \"Alex, I've some bad news for you,\" and then bluntly, with his keen  gaze fastened on the young man's face, he told of old Lane's murder,  of Mabel's abduction, and of her rescue by Wetzel.    Alex began to curse and swear vengeance.    \"Stow all that,\" said the colonel sharply. \"Wetzel followed four  Indians who had Mabel and some stolen horses. The redskins quarreled  over the girl, and two took the horses, leaving Mabel to the others.  Wetzel went after these last, tomahawked them, and brought Mabel home.  She was in a bad way, but is now getting over the shock.\"    \"Say, what'd we do here without Wetzel?\" Alex said huskily, unmindful  of the tears that streamed from his eyes and ran over his brown  cheeks. \"Poor old Jake! Poor Mabel! Damn me! it's my fault. If I'd 'a  done right an' married her as I should, as I wanted to, she wouldn't  have had to suffer. But I'll marry her yet, if she'll have me. It was  only because I had no farm, no stock, an' only that little cabin as is  full now, that I waited.\"    \"Alex, you know me,\" said Colonel Zane in kindly tones. \"Look there,  down the clearing half a mile. See that green strip of land along the  river, with the big chestnut in the middle and a cabin beyond. There's  as fine farming land as can be found on the border, eighty acres, well  watered. The day you marry Mabel that farm is yours.\"    Alex grew red, stammered, and vainly tried to express his gratitude.    \"Come along, the sooner you tell Mabel the better,\" said the colonel  with glowing face. He was a good matchmaker. He derived more pleasure  from a little charity bestowed upon a deserving person, than from a  season's crops.    When they arrived at the Sheppard house the girls were still on the  porch. Mabel rose when she saw Alex, standing white and still. He,  poor fellow, was embarrassed by the others, who regarded him with  steady eyes.    Colonel Zane pushed Alex up on the porch, and said in a low voice:  \"Mabel, I've just arranged something you're to give Alex. It's a nice  little farm, and it'll be a wedding present.\"    Mabel looked in a bewildered manner from Colonel Zane's happy face to  the girls, and then at the red, joyous features of her lover. Only  then did she understand, and uttering a strange little cry, put her  trembling hands to her bosom as she swayed to and fro.    But she did not fall, for Alex, quick at the last, leaped forward and  caught her in his arms.           *       *       *       *       *    That evening Helen denied herself to Mr. Brandt and several other  callers. She sat on the porch with her father while he smoked  his pipe.    \"Where's Will?\" she asked.    \"Gone after snipe, so he said,\" replied her father.    \"Snipe? How funny! Imagine Will hunting! He's surely catching the wild  fever Colonel Zane told us about.\"    \"He surely is.\"    Then came a time of silence. Mr. Sheppard, accustomed to Helen's  gladsome spirit and propensity to gay chatter, noted how quiet she  was, and wondered.    \"Why are you so still?\"    \"I'm a little homesick,\" Helen replied reluctantly.    \"No? Well, I declare! This is a glorious country; but not for such as  you, dear, who love music and gaiety. I often fear you'll not be happy  here, and then I long for the old home, which reminds me of  your mother.\"    \"Dearest, forget what I said,\" cried Helen earnestly. \"I'm only a  little blue to-day; perhaps not at all homesick.\"    \"Indeed, you always seemed happy.\"    \"Father, I am happy. It's only--only a girl's foolish sentiment.\"    \"I've got something to tell you, Helen, and it has bothered me since  Colonel Zane spoke of it to-night. Mordaunt is coming to Fort Henry.\"    \"Mordaunt? Oh, impossible! Who said so? How did you learn?\"    \"I fear 'tis true, my dear. Colonel Zane told me he had heard of an  Englishman at Fort Pitt who asked after us. Moreover, the fellow  answers the description of Mordaunt. I am afraid it is he, and come  after you.\"    \"Suppose he has--who cares? We owe him nothing. He cannot hurt us.\"    \"But, Helen, he's a desperate man. Aren't you afraid of him?\"    \"Not I,\" cried Helen, laughing in scorn. \"He'd better have a care. He  can't run things with a high hand out here on the border. I told him I  would have none of him, and that ended it.\"    \"I'm much relieved. I didn't want to tell you; but it seemed  necessary. Well, child, good night, I'll go to bed.\"    Long after Mr. Sheppard had retired Helen sat thinking. Memories of  the past, and of the unwelcome suitor, Mordaunt, thronged upon her  thick and fast. She could see him now with his pale, handsome face,  and distinguished bearing. She had liked him, as she had other men,  until he involved her father, with himself, in financial ruin, and had  made his attention to her unpleasantly persistent. Then he had  followed the fall of fortune with wild dissipation, and became a  gambler and a drunkard. But he did not desist in his mad wooing. He  became like her shadow, and life grew to be unendurable, until her  father planned to emigrate west, when she hailed the news with joy.  And now Mordaunt had tracked her to her new home. She was sick with  disgust. Then her spirit, always strong, and now freer for this new,  wild life of the frontier, rose within her, and she dismissed all  thoughts of this man and his passion.    The old life was dead and buried. She was going to be happy here. As  for the present, it was enough to think of the little border village,  now her home; of her girl friends; of the quiet borderman: and, for  the moment, that the twilight was somber and beautiful.    High up on the wooded bluff rising so gloomily over the village, she  saw among the trees something silver-bright. She watched it rise  slowly from behind the trees, now hidden, now white through rifts in  the foliage, until it soared lovely and grand above the black horizon.  The ebony shadows of night seemed to lift, as might a sable mantle  moved by invisible hands. But dark shadows, safe from the moon-rays,  lay under the trees, and a pale, misty vapor hung below the brow of  the bluff.    Mysterious as had grown the night before darkness yielded to the moon,  this pale, white light flooding the still valley, was even more soft  and strange. To one of Helen's temperament no thought was needed; to  see was enough. Yet her mind was active. She felt with haunting power  the beauty of all before her; in fancy transporting herself far to  those silver-tipped clouds, and peopling the dells and shady nooks  under the hills with spirits and fairies, maidens and valiant"]]]
