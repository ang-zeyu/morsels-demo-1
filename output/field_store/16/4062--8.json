[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/949"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Submarine Boat; Or, Under the Ocean for Sunken Treasure (#11)"],[1," going in a submarine, for fear the old seaman (for he was old  in point of service though not in years) might not care to risk an  under-water trip. Therefore Tom hesitated. Seeing it, Captain Weston  remarked quietly:    \"I mean, what type is your submarine? Does it go by compressed air, or  water power?\"    \"How do you know it's a submarine?\" asked the young inventor quickly,  and in some confusion.    \"Easy enough. When Mr. Berg thought he was pumping me, I was getting a  lot of information from him. He told me about the submarine his firm  was building, and, naturally, he mentioned yours. One thing led to  another until I got a pretty good idea of your craft. What do you call  it?\"    \"The Advance.\"    \"Good name. I like it, if you don't mind speaking of it.\"    \"We were afraid you wouldn't like it,\" commented Tom.    \"What, the name?\"    \"No, the idea of going in a submarine.\"    \"Oh,\" and Captain Weston laughed. \"Well, it takes more than that to  frighten me, if you'll excuse the expression.  I've always had a  hankering to go under the surface, after so many years spent on top.  Once or twice I came near going under, whether I wanted to or not, in  wrecks, but I think I prefer your way. Now, if you're all done, and  don't mind me speaking of it, I think we'll start for your place. We  must hustle, for Berg may yet get on our trail, even if he has got the  wrong route,\" and he laughed again.    It was no small relief to Mr Swift and Mr. Sharp to learn that Captain  Weston had no objections to a submarine, as they feared he might have.  The captain, in his diffident manner, made friends at once with the  treasure-hunters, and he and Mr. Damon struck up quite an acquaintance.  Tom told of his meeting with the seaman, and the latter related, with  much gusto, the story of how he had fooled Mr. Berg.    \"Well, perhaps you'd like to come and take a look at the craft that is  to be our home while we're beneath the water,\" suggested Mr. Swift and  the sailor assenting, the aged inventor, with much pride, assisted by  Tom, pointed out on the Advance the features of interest. Captain  Weston gave hearty approval, making one or two minor suggestions, which  were carried out.    \"And so you launch her to-morrow,\" he concluded, when he had completed  the inspection \"Well, I hope it's a success, if I may be permitted to  say so.\"    There were busy times around the machine shop next day. So much secrecy  had been maintained that none of the residents, or visitors to the  coast resort, were aware that in their midst was such a wonderful craft  as the submarine. The last touches were put on the under-water ship;  the ways, leading from the shop to the creek, were well greased, and  all was in readiness for the launching. The tide would soon be at  flood, and then the boat would slide down the timbers (at least, that  was the hope of all), and would float in the element meant to receive  her. It was decided that no one should be aboard when the launching  took place, as there was an element of risk attached, since it was not  known just how buoyant the craft was. It was expected she would float,  until the filled tanks took her to the bottom, but there was no telling.    \"It will be flood tide now in ten minutes,\" remarked Captain Weston  quietly, looking at his watch. Then he took an observation through the  telescope. \"No hostile ships hanging in the offing,\" he reported. \"All  is favorable, if you don't mind me saying so,\" and he seemed afraid  lest his remark might give offense.    \"Get ready,\" ordered Mr. Swift. \"Tom, see that the ropes are all  clear,\" for it had been decided to ease the Advance down into the water  by means of strong cables and windlasses, as the creek was so narrow  that the submarine, if launched in the usual way, would poke her nose  into the opposite mud bank and stick there.    \"All clear,\" reported the young inventor.    \"High tide!\" exclaimed the captain a moment later, snapping shut his  watch.    \"Let go!\" ordered Mr. Swift, and the various windlasses manned by the  inventor, Tom and the others began to unwind their ropes. Slowly the  ship slid along the greased ways.  Slowly she approached the water. How  anxiously they all watched her! Nearer and nearer her blunt nose, with  the electric propulsion plate and the auxiliary propeller, came to the  creek, the waters of which were quiet now, awaiting the turn of the  tide.    Now little waves lapped the steel sides. It was the first contact of  the Advance with her native element.    \"Pay out the rope faster!\" cried Mr. Swift.    The windlasses were turned more quickly. Foot by foot the craft slid  along until, with a final rush, the stern left the ways and the  submarine was afloat. Now would come the test. Would she ride on an  even keel, or sink out of sight, or turn turtle? They all ran to the  water's edge, Tom in the lead.    \"Hurrah!\" suddenly yelled the lad, trying to stand on his head. \"She  floats! She's a success! Come on! Let's get aboard!\"    For, true enough, the Advance was riding like a duck on the water. She  had been proportioned just right, and her lines were perfect. She rode  as majestically as did any ship destined to sail on the surface, and  not intended to do double duty.    \"Come on, we must moor her to the pier,\" directed Mr. Sharp. \"The tide  will turn in a few minutes and take her out to sea.\"    He and Tom entered a small boat, and soon the submarine was tied to a  small dock that had been built for the purpose.    \"Now to try the engine,\" suggested Mr. Swift, who was almost trembling  with eagerness; for the completion of the ship meant much to him.    \"One moment,\" begged Captain Weston. \"If you don't mind, I'll take an  observation,\" he went on, and he swept the horizon with his telescope.  \"All clear,\" he reported. \"I think we may go aboard and make a trial  trip.\"    Little time was lost in entering the cabin and engine-room, Garret  Jackson accompanying the party to aid with the machinery. It did not  take long to start the motors, dynamos and the big gasolene engine that  was the vital part of the craft. A little water was admitted to the  tanks for ballast, since the food and other supplies were not yet on  board. The Advance now floated with the deck aft of the conning tower  showing about two feet above the surface of the creek. Mr. Swift and  Tom entered the pilot house.    \"Start the engines,\" ordered the aged inventor, \"and we'll try my new  system of positive and negative electrical propulsion.\"    There was a hum and whir in the body of the ship beneath the feet of  Tom and his father. Captain Weston stood on the little deck near the  conning tower.    \"All ready?\" asked the youth through the speaking tube to Mr. Sharp and  Mr. Jackson in the engine-room.    \"All ready,\" came the answer.    Tom threw over the connecting lever, while his father grasped the  steering wheel. The Advance shot forward, moving swiftly along, about  half submerged.    \"She goes! She goes!\" cried Tom.    \"She certainly does, if I may be permitted to say so,\" was the calm  contribution of Captain Weston. \"I congratulate you.\"    Faster and faster went the new craft. Mr. Swift headed her toward the  open sea, but stopped just before passing out of the creek, as he was  not yet ready to venture into deep water.    \"I want to test the auxiliary propellers,\" he said. After a little  longer trial of the electric propulsion plates, which were found to  work satisfactorily, sending the submarine up and down the creek at a  fast rate, the screws, such as are used on most submarines, were put  into gear.  They did well, but were not equal to the plates, nor was so  much expected of them.    \"I am perfectly satisfied,\" announced Mr. Swift as he once more headed  the boat to sea. \"I think, Captain Weston, you had better go below now.\"    \"Why so?\"    \"Because I am going to completely submerge the craft. Tom, close the  conning tower door. Perhaps you will come in here with us, Captain  Weston, though it will be rather a tight fit.\"    \"Thank you, I will. I want to see how it feels to be in a pilot house  under water.\"    Tom closed the water-tight door of the conning tower. Word was sent  through the tube to the engine-room that a more severe test of the ship  was about to be made. The craft was now outside the line of breakers  and in the open sea.    \"Is everything ready, Tom?\" asked his father in a quiet voice.    \"Everything,\" replied the lad nervously, for the anticipation of being  about to sink below the surface was telling on them all, even on the  calm, old sea captain.    \"Then open the tanks and admit the water,\" ordered Mr. Swift.    His son turned a valve and adjusted some levers. There was a hissing  sound, and the Advance began sinking. She was about to dive beneath the  surface of the ocean, and those aboard her were destined to go through  a terrible experience before she rose again.          Chapter Eleven    On the Ocean Bed      Lower and lower sank the submarine. There was a swirling and foaming of  the water as she went down, caused by the air bubbles which the craft  carried with her in her descent.  Only the top of the conning tower was  out of water now, the ocean having closed over the deck and the rounded  back of the boat. Had any one been watching they would have imagined  that an accident was taking place.    In the pilot house, with its thick glass windows, Tom, his father and  Captain Weston looked over the surface of the ocean, which every minute  was coming nearer and nearer to them.    \"We'll be all under in a few seconds,\" spoke Tom in a solemn voice, as  he listened to the water hissing into the tanks.    \"Yes, and then we can see what sort of progress we will make,\" added  Mr. Swift. \"Everything is going fine, though,\" he went on cheerfully.  \"I believe I have a good boat.\"    \"There is no doubt of it in my mind,\" remarked Captain Weston, and Tom  felt a little disappointed that the sailor"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/95"],[0,"The Prisoner of Zenda (#11)"],[1," I suppose?\"    \"The Six?\"    \"You call them that, too?\"    \"To be in the fashion, I do. But I order you to receive no one unless  you like.\"    \"Except yourself?\"    \"I pray for myself. I could not order.\"    As I spoke, there came a cheer from the street. The princess ran to the  window.    \"It is he!\" she cried. \"It is--the Duke of Strelsau!\"    I smiled, but said nothing. She returned to her seat. For a few moments  we sat in silence. The noise outside subsided, but I heard the tread of  feet in the ante-room. I began to talk on general subjects. This went on  for some minutes. I wondered what had become of Michael, but it did  not seem to be for me to interfere. All at once, to my great surprise,  Flavia, clasping her hands asked in an agitated voice:    \"Are you wise to make him angry?\"    \"What? Who? How am I making him angry?\"    \"Why, by keeping him waiting.\"    \"My dear cousin, I don't want to keep him--\"    \"Well, then, is he to come in?\"    \"Of course, if you wish it.\"    She looked at me curiously.    \"How funny you are,\" she said. \"Of course no one could be announced  while I was with you.\"    Here was a charming attribute of royalty!    \"An excellent etiquette!\" I cried. \"But I had clean forgotten it; and if  I were alone with someone else, couldn't you be announced?\"    \"You know as well as I do. I could be, because I am of the Blood;\" and  she still looked puzzled.    \"I never could remember all these silly rules,\" said I, rather feebly,  as I inwardly cursed Fritz for not posting me up. \"But I'll repair my  fault.\"    I jumped up, flung open the door, and advanced into the ante-room.  Michael was sitting at a table, a heavy frown on his face. Everyone  else was standing, save that impudent young dog Fritz, who was lounging  easily in an armchair, and flirting with the Countess Helga. He leapt up  as I entered, with a deferential alacrity that lent point to his former  nonchalance. I had no difficulty in understanding that the duke might  not like young Fritz.    I held out my hand, Michael took it, and I embraced him. Then I drew him  with me into the inner room.    \"Brother,\" I said, \"if I had known you were here, you should not have  waited a moment before I asked the princess to permit me to bring you to  her.\"    He thanked me, but coldly. The man had many qualities, but he could not  hide his feelings. A mere stranger could have seen that he hated me, and  hated worse to see me with Princess Flavia; yet I am persuaded that he  tried to conceal both feelings, and, further, that he tried to persuade  me that he believed I was verily the King. I did not know, of course;  but, unless the King were an impostor, at once cleverer and more  audacious than I (and I began to think something of myself in that  role), Michael could not believe that. And, if he didn't, how he must  have loathed paying me deference, and hearing my \"Michael\" and my  \"Flavia!\"    \"Your hand is hurt, sire,\" he observed, with concern.    \"Yes, I was playing a game with a mongrel dog\" (I meant to stir him),  \"and you know, brother, such have uncertain tempers.\"    He smiled sourly, and his dark eyes rested on me for a moment.    \"But is there no danger from the bite?\" cried Flavia anxiously.    \"None from this,\" said I. \"If I gave him a chance to bite deeper, it  would be different, cousin.\"    \"But surely he has been destroyed?\" said she.    \"Not yet. We're waiting to see if his bite is harmful.\"    \"And if it is?\" asked Michael, with his sour smile.    \"He'll be knocked on the head, brother,\" said I.    \"You won't play with him any more?\" urged Flavia.    \"Perhaps I shall.\"    \"He might bite again.\"    \"Doubtless he'll try,\" said I, smiling.    Then, fearing Michael would say something which I must appear to  resent (for, though I might show him my hate, I must seem to be full of  favour), I began to compliment him on the magnificent condition of his  regiment, and of their loyal greeting to me on the day of my coronation.  Thence I passed to a rapturous description of the hunting-lodge which  he had lent me. But he rose suddenly to his feet. His temper was failing  him, and, with an excuse, he said farewell. However, as he reached the  door he stopped, saying:    \"Three friends of mine are very anxious to have the honour of being  presented to you, sire. They are here in the ante-chamber.\"    I joined him directly, passing my arm through his. The look on his  face was honey to me. We entered the ante-chamber in fraternal fashion.  Michael beckoned, and three men came forward.    \"These gentlemen,\" said Michael, with a stately courtesy which, to  do him justice, he could assume with perfect grace and ease, \"are the  loyalest and most devoted of your Majesty's servants, and are my very  faithful and attached friends.\"    \"On the last ground as much as the first,\" said I, \"I am very pleased to  see them.\"    They came one by one and kissed my hand--De Gautet, a tall lean fellow,  with hair standing straight up and waxed moustache; Bersonin, the  Belgian, a portly man of middle height with a bald head (though he was  not far past thirty); and last, the Englishman, Detchard, a narrow-faced  fellow, with close-cut fair hair and a bronzed complexion. He was a  finely made man, broad in the shoulder and slender in the hips. A good  fighter, but a crooked customer, I put him down for. I spoke to him in  English, with a slight foreign accent, and I swear the fellow smiled,  though he hid the smile in an instant.    \"So Mr. Detchard is in the secret,\" thought I.    Having got rid of my dear brother and his friends, I returned to make my  adieu to my cousin. She was standing at the door. I bade her farewell,  taking her hand in mine.    \"Rudolf,\" she said, very low, \"be careful, won't you?\"    \"Of what?\"    \"You know--I can't say. But think what your life is to--\"    \"Well to--?\"    \"To Ruritania.\"    Was I right to play the part, or wrong to play the part? I know not:  evil lay both ways, and I dared not tell her the truth.    \"Only to Ruritania?\" I asked softly.    A sudden flush spread over her incomparable face.    \"To your friends, too,\" she said.    \"Friends?\"    \"And to your cousin,\" she whispered, \"and loving servant.\"    I could not speak. I kissed her hand, and went out cursing myself.    Outside I found Master Fritz, quite reckless of the footmen, playing at  cat's-cradle with the Countess Helga.    \"Hang it!\" said he, \"we can't always be plotting. Love claims his  share.\"    \"I'm inclined to think he does,\" said I; and Fritz, who had been by my  side, dropped respectfully behind.          CHAPTER 9    A New Use for a Tea-table      If I were to detail the ordinary events of my daily life at this time,  they might prove instructive to people who are not familiar with the  inside of palaces; if I revealed some of the secrets I learnt, they  might prove of interest to the statesmen of Europe. I intend to do  neither of these things. I should be between the Scylla of dullness and  the Charybdis of indiscretion, and I feel that I had far better confine  myself strictly to the underground drama which was being played beneath  the surface of Ruritanian politics. I need only say that the secret of  my imposture defied detection. I made mistakes. I had bad minutes: it  needed all the tact and graciousness whereof I was master to smooth over  some apparent lapses of memory and unmindfulness of old acquaintances of  which I was guilty. But I escaped, and I attribute my escape, as I have  said before, most of all, to the very audacity of the enterprise. It is  my belief that, given the necessary physical likeness, it was far easier  to pretend to be King of Ruritania than it would have been to personate  my next-door neighbour. One day Sapt came into my room. He threw me a  letter, saying:    \"That's for you--a woman's hand, I think. But I've some news for you  first.\"    \"What's that?\"    \"The King's at the Castle of Zenda,\" said he.    \"How do you know?\"    \"Because the other half of Michael's Six are there. I had enquiries  made, and they're all there--Lauengram, Krafstein, and young Rupert  Hentzau: three rogues, too, on my honour, as fine as live in Ruritania.\"    \"Well?\"    \"Well, Fritz wants you to march to the Castle with horse, foot, and  artillery.\"    \"And drag the moat?\" I asked.    \"That would be about it,\" grinned Sapt, \"and we shouldn't find the  King's body then.\"    \"You think it's certain he's there?\"    \"Very probable. Besides the fact of those three being there, the  drawbridge is kept up, and no one goes in without an order from young  Hentzau or Black Michael himself. We must tie Fritz up.\"    \"I'll go to Zenda,\" said I.    \"You're mad.\"    \"Some day.\"    \"Oh, perhaps. You'll very likely stay there though, if you do.\"    \"That may be, my friend,\" said I carelessly.    \"His Majesty looks sulky,\" observed Sapt. \"How's the love affair?\"    \"Damn you, hold your tongue!\" I said.    He looked at me for a moment, then he lit his pipe. It was quite true  that I was in a bad temper, and I went on perversely:    \"Wherever I go, I'm dogged by half a dozen fellows.\"    \"I know you are; I send 'em,\" he replied composedly.    \"What for?\"    \"Well,\" said Sapt, puffing away, \"it wouldn't be exactly inconvenient  for Black Michael if you disappeared. With you gone, the old game that  we stopped would be played--or he'd have a shot at it.\"    \"I can take care of myself.\"    \"De Gautet, Bersonin, and Detchard are in Strelsau; and any one of  them, lad, would cut your throat as readily--as readily as I would Black  Michael's, and a deal more treacherously. What's the letter?\"    I opened it and read it aloud:    \"If the King desires to know what it deeply concerns the King to know,  let him do as this letter bids him. At the end of the New Avenue there  stands a house in large grounds. The house has a portico, with a statue  of a nymph on it. A wall encloses the garden; there is a gate in the  wall at the back. At twelve o'clock"]]]
