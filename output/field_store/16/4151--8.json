He returns in all seventeen times, is  vanquished on each occasion but returns once more. This time he is aided  by another demon, Kalayavana, and seeing the constant strain of such  attacks, Krishna decides to evacuate the Yadavas and settle them at a new  base. He commissions the divine architect, Visvakarma, to build a new city  in the sea. This is done in one night, the city is called Dwarka[35] and  there the Yadavas with all their goods are transported. When this has been  done, Krishna and Balarama trick the demons. They pretend to be utterly  defeated, retreat from Mathura and in despair ascend a tall hill. The  demon armies surround them and there appears to be no possible way of  escape. Jarasandha orders wood to be brought from the surrounding towns  and villages, piled up round the hill, saturated with oil and then set  fire to. A vast flame shoots up. The whole hill is ablaze but Krishna and  Balarama slip out unseen, take the road to Mathura and finally reach  Dwarka. When the hill is reduced to ashes, Jarasandha concludes that  Krishna and Balarama have perished. He advances to Mathura, occupies the  empty town, proclaims his authority and returns to Magadha.    [Footnote 35: Dwarka is sited on the western seaboard, 300 miles north-west  of Bombay.]        (ii) Marriages and Offspring      The immediate position, then, is that Krishna has abandoned his life among  the cowherds, has been accepted as a Yadava, has coped with the difficult  and dangerous situation arising from the tyrant king's death and finally  has saved the Yadavas from extinction by demons. This, however, has meant  the abandonment of Mathura and the movement of the Yadavas to a new city,  Dwarka. The same problem, therefore, which faced him earlier, confronts  him once again. Having obtained immunity for the Yadavas and brought them  to a new land, can Krishna now regard his mission as accomplished? Or must  he linger on earth still longer? The answer can hardly be in doubt; for  although the Yadavas appear to be installed in good surroundings, demon  hordes still range the world. The tyrant Kansa was only the worst and most  powerful member of the demon hosts. The war with Jarasandha has rid the  world of many demons, but vast numbers remain and until their ranks have  been appreciably reduced, Krishna's mission will be unfulfilled. Only one  course of action, therefore, is possible. He must accept a permanent  position in Yadava society, live as an honoured noble, a prince of the  blood royal and as occasion warrants continue to intervene in the struggle  between the good and the bad.    Such a decision is taken and Krishna installs himself at Dwarka. Before he  can fulfil his duties as an adult member of the race, however, certain  preliminaries are necessary and among them is the important issue of his  marriage. Both he and Balarama require wives and the question is how are  they to get them. Balarama's problem is easily settled by a marriage to  Revati, a princess. Krishna's, on the other hand, is less straightforward  and he is still undecided when news is brought that the Raja of Kundulpur  has a daughter of matchless loveliness, her name Rukmini. Her eyes, it was  said, were like a doe's, her complexion like a flower, her face dazzling  as the moon. Rukmini in turn has overheard some beggars reciting Krishna's  exploits, has fallen in love with his image and is at once delighted and  disturbed. In this way each is fascinated by the other. Almost  immediately, however, a crisis occurs. Rukmini's brother, Rukma, urges her  father to marry her to a rival, Sisupala. Krishna's claims as Vishnu  incarnate are advanced in vain and he is ridiculed as being just a  cowherd. Against his better judgment her father acquiesces and  arrangements for a wedding with Sisupala go forward. Rukmini now takes the  daring step of sending a message to Krishna, declaring her love and asking  him to save her. Krishna reads it with delight. He at once leaves for  Kundulpur, finding it gay with flags and banners, golden spires and  wreaths of flowers. Sisupala has arrived, but in addition, there is  Krishna's old enemy, Jarasandha, encamped with an army of demons. Rukmini  is in despair until she learns that Krishna also has arrived. A little  later Balarama reaches the scene, bringing with him an army. Sisupala is  dismayed at his arrival and both sides watch each other's movements. The  wedding day now dawns and Rukmini, guarded by Sisupala's soldiers, goes  outside the city to worship at a shrine to Devi.[36] As she nears the  shrine, Krishna suddenly appears. Rukmini gazes with adoration at him. He  springs among the soldiers, lifts her into his chariot and rushes her  away.    This summary abduction is more than Sisupala can bear. Troops career after  Krishna. Armies engage. A vast battle ensues. As they fight, Rukmini looks  timorously on. At last, Balarama vanquishes the demon hosts, 'as a white  elephant scatters lotuses.' Sisupala and Jarasandha flee, but Rukmini's  evil brother, Rukma, returns to the fray, strives feverishly to kill  Krishna, fails and is taken captive. His life is spared at Rukmini's  behest, but he is led away, his hands tied behind his back and his  moustaches shaven off. Balarama intercedes and effects his release and  Rukma goes away to brood on his discomfiture and plot revenge. Krishna now  returns to Dwarka in triumph, is given a rapturous welcome and a little  later celebrates his marriage with full ritual. 'Priests recited the  Vedas, Krishna circled round with Rukmini. Drums resounded. The delighted  gods rained down flowers; demi-gods, saints, bards and celestial musicians  were all spectators from the sky.'    Having married Rukmini, Krishna has now the full status of a grown prince.  But he is nothing if not supernormal; and just as earlier in his career he  has showered his affection on a host of cowgirls, he now acquires a whole  succession of further wives. The first is Jambhavati, the second  Satyabhama. Satyabhama's father is a certain Sattrajit who has obtained  from the sun the boon of a jewel. The jewel flashes with light and Krishna  advises him to surrender it to King Ugrasena. The man refuses; whereupon  his brother seizes it and goes away to the forest. Here a lion pounces  upon him, devours the man and his horse and hides the jewel. The lion is  then killed by a bear who centuries earlier had served with Vishnu's  earlier incarnation, Rama, during his campaign against the demon king of  Lanka.[37] The bear carries away the jewel and gives it to its mate. When  Sattrajit hears that his brother is missing, he concludes that Krishna has  caused his death and starts a whispering campaign, accusing Krishna of  making away with the jewel. Krishna hears of the slander and at once  decides to search for the missing man, recover the jewel and thus silence  his accuser for ever. As he goes through the forest, Krishna finds a cave  where the dead lion is lying. He enters it, grapples with the bear but is  quickly recognized by the bear as Krishna himself. The bear bows before  him and begs him to accept his daughter Jambhavati in marriage. He  includes the jewel as part of the dowry. Krishna marries the girl and  returns. Back at the court he upbraids Sattrajit for falsely accusing him.  'I did not take the jewel,' he says. 'The bear took it. Now he has given  the jewel to me and also his daughter. Take back your jewel and be  silent.' Sattrajit is overwhelmed with shame and by way of amends gives  Krishna his own daughter, Satyabhama. Krishna marries her and Sattrajit  begs him to take the jewel also. Krishna refuses and the jewel remains  with its owner. A little later, Sattrajit is murdered and the jewel once  again stolen. The murderer thief is tracked down by Krishna and killed,  but only after many delays is the jewel at last recovered from Akrura--the  leading Yadava who earlier in the story has acted first as Raja Kansa's  envoy to Krishna and later as Krishna's envoy to Kunti. Krishna orders him  to return it to its owner, Sattrajit's grandson. Akrura places it at  Krishna's feet and Krishna gives it to Satyabhama. The upshot, then, is  that the slander is ended, the jewel is regained and in the process  Krishna acquires two further wives.    These extra marriages, however, by no means end the tally of his consorts,  for during a visit to his relatives, the Pandavas, now returned from exile  and for the moment safely reinstalled in their kingdom, he sees a lovely  girl, Kalindi, wandering in the forest. She is the daughter of the sun and  has been sent to dwell by a river until her appointed bridegroom, Krishna,  arrives to claim her. Krishna is delighted with her youth, places her in  his chariot and on his return to Dwarka, celebrates their wedding. A  little later other girls are married to him, in many cases only after a  fierce struggle with demons. In this way, he obtains eight queens, at the  same time advancing his prime purpose of ridding the world of demons.    At this point, the _Purana_ embarks on an episode which, at first sight,  appears to have very little to do with its main subject. In fact, however,  its relevance is great for, as a consequence, Krishna the prince acquires  as many female companions as he had enjoyed as a youth. The episode begins  with Earth again appearing in heaven. Having successfully engineered  Krishna's birth, she does special penance and again beseeches the supreme  Trinity to grant her a boon. This boon is a son who will never be equalled  and who will never die. Brahma, Vishnu and Siva agree to give her a son,  Naraka, but on the following conditions: he will conquer all the kings of  the earth, rout the gods in the sky, carry off the earrings of Aditi (the  mother of the gods), wear them himself, take the canopy of Indra and place  it over his own"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11930"],[0,"More Fables (#12)"],[1," Verses came out in the Monthly he began to get Letters from  all parts of the United States telling him how much Suffering and  Opening of Old Wounds had been caused by his little Poem about Willie  and how Proud he ought to be. Many who wrote expressed Sympathy for him,  and begged him to Bear Up. These Letters dazed the Author. He never had  owned any Boy named Willie. He did not so much as Know a Boy named  Willie. He lived in an Office Building with a lot of Stenographers and  Bill Clerks. If he had been the Father of a Boy named Willie, and Willie  had ever come to tell him \"Good Night\" when he was busy at Something  Else, probably he would have jumped at Willie and snapped a piece out of  his Arm. Just the Same, the Correspondents wrote to him from All Over,  and said they could read Grief in every Line of his Grand Composition.    That was only the Get-Away. The next thing he knew, some Composer in  Philadelphia had set the Verses to Music and they were sung on the Stage  with colored Lantern-Slide Pictures of little Willie telling Papa \"Good  Night\" in a Blue Flat with Lace Curtains on the Windows and a Souvenir  Cabinet of Chauncey Olcott on the What-Not. The Song was sold at Music  Stores, and the Author was invited out to Private Houses to hear it  Sung, but he was Light on his Feet and Kept Away.    Several Newspapers sent for his Picture, and he was asked to write a  Sunday Article telling how and why he did it. He was asked to Contribute  Verses of the same General Character to various Periodicals. Sometimes  he would get away by himself and read the Thing over again, and shake  his Head and Remark: \"Well, if they are Right, then I must be Wrong, but  to me it is Punk.\"    He had his Likeness printed in Advertisements which told the Public to  read what the Author of \"Willie's Good Night\" had to say about their  Lithia Water. Some one named a light, free-smoking Five-Cent Cigar after  him, and he began to see Weird Paintings on the Dead Walls, and was  Ashamed to walk along those Streets.    [Illustration: LITTLE FERN]    It came out that one of the Frohmans wanted to Dramatize the  Masterpiece, and it was Rumored that Stuart Robson, Modjeska, Thomas Q.  Seabrooke, Maude Adams, Dave Warfield, and Walker Whiteside had been  requested to play the Part of Willie.    Every morning the Author would get up and say to himself that it could  not go on much longer. He felt sure that the Public would come to its  Senses some Day, and get after him with a Rope, but it didn't. His Fame  continued to Spread and Increase. All those Persons who had not Read it  claimed that they had, so as to be in Line, and he had the same old  Floral Tributes handed to him Day after Day.    It was Terrible. He had gone to College and spent a large amount of  Money irrigating and fertilizing his Mind, and he had Dreamed of writing  Something that would be Strong enough for Charles Dudley Warner's  Library of the World's Warmest Copy, in a Limited Edition of 20,000; but  instead of landing with the Heavy-Weights he seemed Destined to achieve  Greatness as the Author of a Boy's Size Poem, bearing about the same  Relation to the Literature of the Ages that a May Howard Window Hanger  does to Pure Art. He was Famous until he couldn't rest, but it was not  the Brand he had Coveted.    He decided to Live It Down. He would Produce something Serious and  Meritorious that would throw \"Willie's Good Night\" into the Shade. So he  labored for Two Years on a Novel that analyzed Social Conditions, and  every Reviewer said that here was a Volume by the Author of \"Willie's  Good Night.\" The Purchasers of the Book expected to take it Home and  Read it and Weep. When they found that it did not contain any Dark Skies  or Headstones, they felt that they had been Bilked out of $1.50 each. It  was Suggested that the Author of \"Willie's Good Night\" was losing his  Grip and seemed to have Written Himself Out.    He was not wholly Discouraged. He went out Lecturing on the Occult, just  to prove to People that he had been Misjudged. The Local Chairman always  introduced him as the Celebrated Author of \"Willie's Good Night.\"  Frequently he was Dragged away to a Home to meet all the Big Guns of one  of these Towns that call a Lecture a Show. After he had been on  Exhibition for a Half Hour or so, the same as the Albino or the Man with  the Elastic Skin in the Main Curio Hall, the Host would clear a Space in  the Center of the Room and announce that he was about to spring a  Delightful Surprise on their Distinguished Guest. Little Fern, the  Daughter of the County Recorder, was going to Speak \"Willie's Good  Night.\"    There are Times and Times, but those were the Times when he suffered  Agony that went beyond the Limit.    The Author always knew the Verses were Bad enough to be Wicked, but he  never guessed how Yellow they really were until he heard them recited by  Little Girls who made the Full Stop at the Comma instead of the Period.  He used to lose a Pound a Minute, and when he would start back to the  Hotel his Shoes would be Full of Cold Perspiration. Finally, when he  began to decline Invitations, against the advice of his Manager, it was  said of him that he was Eccentric and appeared to have a Case of the  Swell Head.    He had to retire into a Suburb, where he built a Wall around his  Premises and put up Signs against Trespassing. He had a Chinaman for a  Servant, because the Chinaman did not know he was an Author, but  supposed him to be a Retired Porch-Climber.    Thus he was enabled to Forget for an Hour or Two at a Time.    MORAL: _Refrain from Getting Gay with the Emotions._"]]]
