[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9408"],[0,"By Water to the Columbian Exposition (#11)"],[1," the scene changed to one of peaceful  beauty so that the rose light of the radiant sun-ball appeared in the  heavens; casting a new glory on the picturesque scenery of water and  shore.    The surface of the lake had become calm; and speeding along, we enjoyed  the lovely weather which was not destined to continue. For, toward midday  a fresh breeze rippled the waters that by degrees were transformed into  towering waves, shaking their foamy crests, and tossing us angrily from  side to side; and we were not sorry when we reached the harbor of  _Muskegon_, about six miles from Muskegon City, situated on the same-named  river which here, four miles from its mouth, widens into Muskegon Lake. It  is the best harbor on the east side of the great lake. The city has daily  steamboat navigation with Chicago; and saws and ships enormous quantities  of lumber. Its principal manufactories are a number of foundries, machine  shops, and boiler works. The present population is estimated to comprise  about 24,000.    While admiring the lovely scenery enhanced by an enchanting sunset, from  the deck of the yacht, our attention was distracted by approaching  footsteps. In the uncertain, fading daylight, we perceived a gentleman  accompanied by a lady--curiously regarding us--whom we invited on board  the \"Marguerite.\"    Mrs. and Mr. Wickham were the names by which this fair couple was  introduced. That they spent the evening in our company, was very  acceptable to us--as we but rarely had visitors on our pilgrimage. They  greatly admired our floating home, and as the moon arose to bathe us with  his silvery light, they took their departure.    The young archer--morn--broke his arrows on the remote hills, walking  golden-sandaled down the lake, when we continued our voyage.    The still waters were soon lashed into fury again by an unfavorable wind,  increasing toward midday to such a degree that we were glad to take refuge  in the harbor of _South Haven_, where we lingered until the dawn of  another day.    Opposite the mooring-place of the \"Marguerite\" stood an edifice whose  interior we all longed to view. Having so unexpectedly become acquainted  with the Life-Saving Service on the occasion of our adventure near Thunder  Bay, we were anxious to learn more about that noble institution. In the  afternoon we set out for the South Haven Life-Saving Station whose  captain, an obliging gentleman, gave us very satisfactory explanations. He  first called our attention to the splendid qualities of the life-boat:  such as its power to right itself if upset; the capability of immediate  self-discharge when filled with water; its strength; resistance to  overturning; speed against a heavy sea; buoyancy; and facility in  launching and taking the shore.    We then inspected the diverse apparatuses utilized for rescuing the  shipwrecked.    A very clever contrivance, especially appropriate for saving invalids,  children, and aged persons is the metallic car, a small covered boat,  which can hold three or four persons who, entering by a comparatively  small aperture, are shut in and drawn ashore, safely protected from injury  even though overturned by the surf.    For projecting a line over a stranded vessel a howitzer is used; and in  this way a communication is secured to the shore. The cork life-belts worn  by the men, are of the plan first designed by Admiral Ward.    It is safe to say that the United States Life-Saving Service is chief  among the life-boat societies of other nations, both as regards the extent  of coast embraced, and the amount of work done. The whole support of this  service is provided for by annual grants from Congress. Besides its vast  coast line, it guards the shores of its great lakes. Since the  sea-bordering portions of America in many places are destitute of human  habitations, the constant employment of surfmen is required for the  express purpose of looking out for vessels in distress and manning the  surf-boats. It also necessitates the erection of houses of refuge  provisioned so as to afford shelter and food to shipwrecked sailors for a  considerable time at places, where without such provisions those who  escape the sea, would probably perish from hunger and exposure.    The shores of the United States lakes and sea comprise over 10,000 miles,  embracing almost every variety of climate and formation of land. This  great extent of sea-board is divided into twelve districts with in all 244  stations. Of these 182 are on the Atlantic, forty-nine on the lakes, and  twelve on the Pacific. Many of the stations are closed during the fine  months of the year; their crews being disbanded till the winter gales  again summon them to their heroic and dangerous work. That they render  noble service in this way, may be gathered from the annual reports.    The official statement of 1893 shows that the disasters to shipping in  that year amounted to 427 cases; that on board of vessels thus endangered  there were 3,565 persons of whom 3,542 were saved.    After we had thus enriched our knowledge referring to this humane  institution with its present effective system, we proceeded to the  neighboring shore of Lake Michigan, here forming a beautiful beach. The  polished and print-less sand studded with small, shining pepples spread  before us in vast expanse; and the magnificent waters of the lake  glittered in the sun-beams as though they were sown with diamonds. When  the surf came in, and the white fringe of the sliding wave shot up the  beach, the light color of the sand was deepened to a silvery gray. As much  as we marred and defaced its fine-grained, bright surface, it was ever  beaten down anew by the advancing and retreating waves. We had hardly  deserted this lovely spot, when our foot prints were washed away by the  ever returning sea.    On Monday at an advanced hour in the evening we departed from South Haven.  Since the glories of the sunset, with its witchery of rose and gold,  promised a fine night, we decided to continue our voyage as far as  Michigan City.    The panorama we witnessed during that nocturnal trip was as magnificent as  can be imagined. The full-orbed moon on the wave was beautiful; and so was  the landscape bathed in its light.    Toward 10 o'clock we arrived at our destination, a town in La Porte Co.,  Indiana.    _Michigan City_ is the largest lumber-market in the State, and has  numerous manufacturing establishments. As a lake-port, it is a place of  considerable prosperity comprising a population of about 11,000.    It was in the early morning, Tuesday, August 22nd, that we left Michigan  City. Having sailed along the coast of the lake for about three hours, we  discerned in the misty distance the site of the \"Queen of the West.\"    At twenty minutes to 9 o'clock, it became plainly cognizable. In  transports of delight we glanced at a vast, verdant tract of land adorned  with magnificent structures appearing to be of the purest marble; in their  matchless beauty imparting to the mind some grand allegorical _tableau_,  intending to convey the poet's idea of the New Jerusalem.    It was the famous _White City_, the site of the World's Columbian  Exposition, that charmed our eyes and gratified our taste so much. No one  can adequately describe that sight as seen from the clear waters of the  lake.--I imagine that our illustrious Columbus must have been equally  affected as he beheld Guanahani, that fruitful island in its wild  luxuriance, on his first landing in the New World.        CHAPTER IV.    STAY IN CHICAGO AND VISIT TO THE WORLD'S FAIR.      Our arrival in Chicago put an end to our pleasurable voyage comprising the  considerable length of 1,243 miles, during which       \"The waves were our pillow,        Our cradle the sea:      When rough was the billow        Not timid were we.\"    This westward trip afforded us every hour a revelation of the surprising  growth of the nation that lives under the Stars and Stripes. My traveling  companions were equally delighted with this course, notwithstanding their  being preacquainted with that portion of the west, whose rapid development  makes it practically a new and another west every ten years. In fact,  America astonishes the world; and it is no common pleasure to study and  note the progress of this great republic of which Chicago is the second  city in commercial importance, as well as in population.    We were anxious to obtain an adequate conception of the site of a city  that is the synonym of push and prosperity, and to which Congress had  awarded the World's Columbian Exposition. Therefore, the yacht was moored  inside the breakwater, near the mouth of the inlet, called the Chicago  River, which runs from the lake nearly one mile westward; then separates  into two branches, one flowing northwest, the other southwest; thus  dividing Chicago into three divisions, connected by more than thirty-five  bridges, and two tunnels laid under the bed of the river. This streamlet  used to empty into Lake Michigan; but a remarkable piece of engineering  caused it to change its course and so to speak, run \"uphill.\" The Illinois  and Michigan Canal, with which the main branch of the river is connected,  was so deepened as to draw the water out from the lake, so that--through  this channel emptying into the Illinois River--the water of Lake Michigan  flows into the Gulf of Mexico by means of the Mississippi River. Had it  been later in the season, we might have decided to follow this watercourse  in order to view the fertile Mississippi River Valley, and to enjoy the  beauties of the sunny south.    The largest vessels may be towed into the Chicago River, being supplied  with docks and water-slips and affording a dockage capacity of nearly  forty miles.--Originally named Chacaqua River, (the Indian word for  thunder, after the Indian Thor or Thunder God), it is supposed to have  given the city its name.    At midday we left our anchorage--on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9411"],[0,"Legends of the Gods (#11)"],[1,"breath in his throat; and when she examined  the wound in his body made by the fiend Aun-Ab she saw in it traces of  poison.  No doubt about his death then remained in her mind, and  clasping him in her arms she lifted him up, and in her transports of  grief leaped about like fish when they are laid on red-hot coals.  Then  she uttered a series of heartbreaking laments, each of which begins  with the words \"Horus is bitten.\"  The heir of heaven, the son of Un-  Nefer, the child of the gods, he who was wholly fair, is bitten!  He  for whose wants I provided, he who was to avenge his father, is bitten!  He for whom I cared and suffered when he was being fashioned in my  womb, is bitten!  He whom I tended so that I might gaze upon him, is  bitten!  He whose life I prayed for is bitten!  Calamity hath overtaken  the child, and he hath perished.      Whilst Isis was saying these and many similar words, her sister  Nephthys, who had been weeping bitterly for her nephew Horus as she  wandered about among the swamps, came, in company with the Scorpion-  goddess Serqet, and advised Isis to pray to heaven for help.  Pray that  the sailors in the Boat of Ra may cease from rowing, for the Boat  cannot travel onwards whilst Horus lies dead.  Then Isis cried out to  heaven, and her voice reached the Boat of Millions of Years, and the  Disk ceased to move onward, and came to a standstill.  From the Boat  Thoth descended, being equipped with words of power and spells of all  kinds, and bearing with him the \"great command of maa-kheru,\" i.e., the  WORD, whose commands were performed, instantly and completely, by every  god, spirit, fiend, human being and by every thing, animate and  inanimate, in heaven, earth, and the Other World.  Then he came to Isis  and told her that no harm could possibly have happened to Horus, for he  was under the protection of the Boat of Ra; but his words failed to  comfort Isis, and though she acknowledged the greatness of his designs,  she complained that they savoured of delay.  \"What is the good,\" she  asks, \"of all thy spells, and incantations, and magical formulae, and  the great command of maa-kheru, if Horus is to perish by the poison of  a scorpion, and to lie here in the arms of Death?  Evil, evil is his  destiny, for it hath entailed the deepest misery for him and death.\"    In answer to these words Thoth, turning to Isis and Nephthys, bade them  to fear not, and to have no anxiety about Horus, \"For,\" said he, \"I  have come from heaven to heal the child for his mother.\"  He then  pointed out that Horus was under protection as the Dweller in his Disk  (Aten), the Great Dwarf, the Mighty Ram, the Great Hawk, the Holy  Beetle, the Hidden Body, the Divine Bennu, etc., and proceeded to utter  the great spell which restored Horus to life.  By his words of power  Thoth transferred the fluid of life of Ra, and as soon as this came  upon the child's body the poison of the scorpion flowed out of him, and  he once more breathed and lived.  When this was done Thoth returned to  the Boat of Ra, the gods who formed its crew resumed their rowing, and  the Disk passed on its way to make its daily journey across the sky.  The gods in heaven, who were amazed and uttered cries of terror when  they heard of the death of Horus, were made happy once more, and sang  songs of joy over his recovery.  The happiness of Isis in her child's  restoration to life was very great, for she could again hope that he  would avenge his father's murder, and occupy his throne.  The final  words of Thoth comforted her greatly, for he told her that he would  take charge of the case of Horus in the Judgment Hall of Anu, wherein  Osiris had been judged, and that as his advocate he would make any  accusations which might be brought against Horus to recoil on him that  brought them.  Furthermore, he would give Horus power to repulse any  attacks which might be made upon him by beings in the heights above, or  fiends in the depths below, and would ensure his succession to the  Throne of the Two Lands, i.e., Egypt.  Thoth also promised Isis that Ra  himself should act as the advocate of Horus, even as he had done for  his father Osiris.  He was also careful to allude to the share which  Isis had taken in the restoration of Horus to life, saying, \"It is the  words of power of his mother which have lifted up his face, and they  shall enable him to journey wheresoever he pleaseth, and to put fear  into the powers above.  I myself hasten [to obey them].\"  Thus  everything turned on the power of the spells of Isis, who made the sun  to stand still, and caused the dead to be raised.    Such are the contents of the texts on the famous Metternich Stele.  There appears to be some confusion in their arrangement, and some of  them clearly are misplaced, and, in places, the text is manifestly  corrupt.  It is impossible to explain several passages, for we do not  understand all the details of the system of magic which they represent.  Still, the general meaning of the texts on the Stele is quite clear,  and they record a legend of Isis and Horus which is not found so fully  described on any other monument.                    IX.        THE HISTORY OF ISIS AND OSIRIS.        The history of Isis and Osiris given on pp. 248 is taken from the  famous treatise of Plutarch entitled De Iside et Osiride, and forms a  fitting conclusion to this volume of Legends of the Gods.  It contains  all the essential facts given in Plutarch's work, and the only things  omitted are his derivations and mythological speculations, which are  really unimportant for the Egyptologist.  Egyptian literature is full  of allusions to events which took place in the life of Osiris, and to  his persecution, murder, and resurrection, and numerous texts of all  periods describe the love and devotion of his sister and wife Isis, and  the filial piety of Horus.  Nowhere, however, have we in Egyptian a  connected account of the causes which led to the murder by Set of  Osiris, or of the subsequent events which resulted in his becoming the  king of heaven and judge of the dead.  However carefully we piece  together the fragments of information which we can extract from native  Egyptian literature, there still remains a series of gaps which can  only be filled by guesswork.  Plutarch, as a learned man and a student  of comparative religion and mythology was most anxious to understand  the history of Isis and Osiris, which Greek and Roman scholars talked  about freely, and which none of them comprehended, and he made  enquiries of priests and others, and examined critically such  information as he could obtain, believing and hoping that he would  penetrate the mystery in which these gods were wrapped.  As a result of  his labours he collected a number of facts about the form of the Legend  of Isis and Osiris as it was known to the learned men of his day, but  there is no evidence that he had the slightest knowledge of the details  of the original African Legend of these gods as it was known to the  Egyptians, say, under the VIth Dynasty.  Moreover, he never realized  that the characteristics and attributes of both Isis and Osiris changed  several times during the long history of Egypt, and that a thousand  years before he lived the Egyptians themselves had forgotten what the  original form of the legend was.  They preserved a number of  ceremonies, and performed very carefully all the details of an ancient  ritual at the annual commemoration festival of Osiris which was held in  November and December, but the evidence of the texts makes it quite  clear that the meaning and symbolism of nearly all the details were  unknown alike to priests and people.    An important modification of the cult of Isis and Osiris took place in  the third century before Christ, when the Ptolemies began to  consolidate their rule in Egypt.  A form of religion which would be  acceptable both to Egyptians and Greeks had to be provided, and this  was produced by modifying the characteristics of Osiris and calling him  Sarapis, and identifying him with the Greek Pluto.  To Isis were added  many of the attributes of the great Greek goddesses, and into her  worship were introduced \"mysteries\" derived from non-Egyptian cults,  which made it acceptable to the people everywhere.  Had a high priest  of Osiris who lived at Abydos under the XVIIIth Dynasty witnessed the  celebration of the great festival of Isis and Osiris in any large town  in the first century before Christ, it is tolerably certain that he  would have regarded it as a lengthy act of worship of strange gods, in  which there appeared, here and there, ceremonies and phrases which  reminded him of the ancient Abydos ritual.  When the form of the cult  of Isis and Osiris introduced by the Ptolemies into Egypt extended to  the great cities of Greece and Italy, still further modifications took  place in it, and the characters of Isis and Osiris were still further  changed.  By degrees Osiris came to be regarded as the god of death  pure and simple, or as the personification of Death, and he ceased to  be regarded as the great protecting ancestral spirit, and the all-  powerful protecting Father of his people.  As the importance of Osiris  declined that of Isis grew, and men came to regard her as the great  Mother-goddess of the world.  The priests described from tradition the  great facts of her life according to the Egyptian legends, how she had  been a loving and devoted wife, how she had gone forth after her  husband's murder by Set to seek for his body, how she had found it and  brought it home, how she revivified it by her spells and had union with  Osiris and conceived by him, and how in due course she brought forth  her son, in pain and sorrow and loneliness in the Swamps of the Delta,  and how she reared him and watched over him until he was old enough to  fight and vanquish his father's murderer, and how at length she seated  him in triumph on his "]]]
