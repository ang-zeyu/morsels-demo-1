Also a sriated shell (Plate 4 figure 5) near to Buccinum  globulare of Phillips, Volume 2nd 16 and 15; but Mr. Sowerby thinks it is  different, and more probably a Littorina, and would call it L. filosa.)    Acacia pendula FIRST SEEN.    On crossing another low ridge beyond this we descended to a valley in  which I saw, for the first time, that beautiful shrub of the interior,  the Acacia pendula. The foliage is of a light green colour and it droops  like the weeping willow; the bark is rough, and the trunk seldom exceeds  nine inches in diameter. The wood of this graceful tree is sweet-scented,  of a rich dark-brown colour, and being very hard, it is in great request  with the natives for making their boomerangs and spearheads. It appears  to grow chiefly on flats which are occasionally inundated.    OTHER TREES NEAR THE RIVER.    During this day's journey we also met with the Callitris pyramidalis, a  tree which in external appearance closely resembles some kinds of  pine-tree. The wood is of a rich yellow hue, very compact, and possesses  a very agreeable perfume; it grows on the drier parts of the country. We  found lofty bluegum-trees (eucalyptus) growing on the flats near the  Peel, whose immediate banks were overhung by the dense umbrageous foliage  of the casuarina, or river-oak of the colonists.    JUNCTION OF THE PEEL AND MULUERINDIE.    We encamped on the river at the foot of a small hill named Perimbungay.  In this very interesting position I could at leisure continue from the  hill my observations of the country before us, while the cattle were at  rest and feeding. The Muluerindie had joined the Peel about a mile above,  and the united streams here flowed along a reach of most promising  extent. Mr. Brown said it was so deep that the natives could never dive  to the bottom. The ford of Wallanburra, by which we were to cross this  river, was only a short way below, and the summit of Perimbungay  commanded a view of the country beyond it. The bank here presented a  section of at least 50 feet of rich earth; and flats of this character,  of more or less width, occur between the river and the hills. In the left  bank at the camp I found a conglomerate rock, consisting of water-worn  fragments of serpentine and trap, cemented by calcareous spar. The men  were very successful in fishing; the cod-perch which they caught weighing  upwards of nine pounds each (See figure 1 Plate 6). With such abundance  of fish, and also the kangaroo, I hoped to feast Mr. Brown, but he set no  value on food so common to him, preferring flour to all things else,  while this was precisely the article which I was most unwilling to spare.  He ate about two pounds and a half of flour daily, yet I considered his  services of so much value, that I felt loth to lessen his allowance; for  with all this he seldom seemed satisfied. He came to me however in the  afternoon, pointing to his protuberant stomach, and actually declaring  that, for once at least, he did not wish any more.    VIEW FROM PERIMBUNGAY.    December 15.    To avoid as much as possible the heat which had proved very distressing  to the cattle, I ordered the party to prepare to move off this morning  soon after sunrise; and while the people were packing up and loading, I  again ascended Perimbungay. The range we had crossed at Turi was near us  to the westward, and a conical hill, called Uriary, in the direction of  Turi, was the most prominent feature to the south-west. The Peel  continued its course westward, passing through this range, which  presented a more defined and elevated outline where it continued beyond  the river. The highest summits there were Periguaguey, bearing west by  south, and Waroga. Turial, a hill still more remote, bore  west-north-west; and between it and Waroga appeared an opening, which I  judged therefore to be the best direction for our route, after crossing  the Peel, for I saw that it was impossible to pass to the westward of  that range at any part nearer the river; but by that opening we could  pursue the further course of the Peel, as the nature of the country  permitted. The land immediately beyond the Peel was inviting enough; one  green hill arose from a level country which lay between the river and the  base of these hills. The waters of the Peel, and the shady trees  overhanging its banks, were visible for several miles; and the varying  outlines of wood, tinted with the delicate lights, around which the deep  grey shadows of early morning were still slumbering, contrasted finely  with the rugged rocks of the hill on which I stood, already sharpened by  the first rays of the rising sun. This hill consisted of trap-rock.    FORD OF WALLANBURRA.    The passage between it and the river was not very safe for the carts, so  that we made a detour on leaving the camp, and did not again see the Peel  until we arrived near the ford of Wallanburra, distant from Perimbungay 4  1/4 miles. The bed of the river was here broad and gravelly; and the  banks on each side were low, qualities most essential to a good ford, but  by no means common on the Peel. Two emus, the first we had seen on this  journey, were drinking on the opposite side, as we approached the ford,  but they ran away on seeing the party. The current was strong, though the  water did not reach above the axles of the carts, and by half-past seven  A.M. everything was safe on the other side of the Peel. On quitting the  immediate banks of the river, we passed through a forest of the tree  resembling pine (Callitris) with bushes of the Acacia pendula  interspersed. There was also a tree new to us, having a small round leaf.    PLAINS OF MULLUBA.    After proceeding six miles, we reached the borders of an extensive open  tract, named Mulluba. It could scarcely bear the usual designation of  plain (the term applied in New South Wales to almost all land free from  trees) for the undulations were as great as those which occur between  London and Hampstead, and, indeed, the whole territory bore a remarkable  resemblance to an enclosed and cultivated country. The ridges, of the  kind already described, I observed in directions, both with the slopes,  and across them, exactly resembling furrows in fallow land. Trees grew in  rows, as if connected with field enclosures, and parts, where bushes or  grass had been recently burnt, looked red or black, thus contributing to  the appearance of cultivation. The soil was, indeed, well worthy of being  cultivated, for it consisted of a rich black mould, so loose and deep  that it yawned in cracks, as if for want of feet to tread it down. It  appeared very probable however that in wet weather such parts of the  country might be too soft for the passage of carts. I then supposed the  ridge on our left might be that called Hardwick's range, by Oxley; its  general direction being about 20 degrees westward of north. We at length  reached the remarkable opening in that range, which I had observed from  Perimbungay, and passing through it, over a narrow flat, we arrived at a  low woody country westward of these ranges. Having now travelled sixteen  miles, I was anxious to encamp here, but we could not, at first, find any  watercourse; and one small, dry channel appeared to be the only line of  drainage in wet weather from the extensive open country of Mulluba. It  struck me at the time that much might be done to remedy the natural  disadvantages, whether of a superfluity of water lodging on the plains in  rainy seasons, or of too great a scarcity of moisture in dry weather.  Channels might be cut in the lines of natural drainage, which would serve  to draw off the water from the plains, and concentrate and preserve a  sufficient supply for use in times of drought, when it would not be  obtained elsewhere.    VIEW FROM MOUNT YDIRE.    We had followed the dry channel for about a mile and a half in search of  water, without much prospect of finding any, when we came to a rocky  part, which still contained, in several pools, more indeed than  sufficient for all our wants, and here we gladly encamped. The range no  longer intercepted our view to the westward, and I lost no time in  ascending one of its pointed summits, named Ydire, accompanied by Mr.  White, and our guide, Mr. Brown. From this hill, the view extended far  and wide over the country to the westward. The most conspicuous feature  in that landscape was a lofty flat-topped hill in the middle distance,  being somewhat isolated, and on the western border of a plain which  extended from our position to its base. The native name of this was  Boonalla.    TANGULDA.    A singular-looking pic, someway northward of Boonalla, next drew my  attention. This, according to my sable authority, was Tangulda. A  meandering line of trees bounded an open part of the intervening plain,  and marked the course, as my guide informed me, of the Namoi.    HILLS SEEN AGREE WITH THE BUSHRANGER'S ACCOUNT.    Now the hills I have just mentioned and the course of this river had been  exactly described by The Bushranger, and the scene made me half believe  his story.    I determined to proceed to the pic of Tangulda, this being the course  also recommended by my guide as the best for the continued pursuit of the  Namoi.    Liverpool plains, which appear to the colonists as if boundless to the  northward, were now so far behind us that their most northern limits were  barely visible to the southward, in two faint yellow streaks. The basin  in which these plains are situated belongs however to the Namoi, which  receives all their waters; and, in the extensive landscape before me,  there appeared to be an opening near Tangulda, through which the whole of  these waters probably passed to the north-west.    The Bushranger's tale was that he had reached the Kindur, or large river,  by proceeding north-east by north from Tangulda. I then perceived only a  few low hills to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12929"],[0,"A Voyage to Terra Australis — Volume 1 (#12)"],[1,"laid,  without covering; but the putrid state of the corpse, did not allow of a  close inspection.    Upon the reefs which surround the island, square places, of about fifty  feet every way, were formed, by piling up stones of two or three feet  high. The tide flows over these; and, on the ebb, the Indians go down and  take out the fish. On all parts of the reefs, there were bamboos set up,  with pendants of dried leaves; but whether they were intended as beacons  for the canoes, or to point out the boundaries of each fishery, could not  be ascertained.    The description of the canoes is nearly the same as that given in the  voyage of Bligh and Portlock; but Mr. Bampton says, \"some of them were  ingeniously carved and painted, and had curious figures at each end.\" The  weapons of these people are bows, arrows, clubs of about four feet long,  and spears and lances of various kinds, made of black., hard, wood. Some  of the lances were jagged, from the sharp point to a foot upward; and  most of them were neatly carved.    The sole quadrupeds seen, were rats, mice, and lizards; which, when the  huts were set on fire, ran from them in great numbers. Land birds were  numerous in all parts of the island; and upon the reefs were many  curlews, large yellow-spotted plover, king's fishers, sand pipers, red  bills, and gulls.    Captain Bampton lays down Darnley's Island, which the natives call  WAMVAX, in latitude 9 deg. 39' 30\" south, and longitude 142 deg. 59' 15\" east;  but in his chart, the centre is placed in 9 deg. 34' south., and 143 deg. 1'  east. He much regretted that he could not land again, to examine the  interior parts of this fine island; but his long boat having drifted out  of sight, without water, provisions, or compass, it was judged necessary  for the ships to weigh, and look after her.    July 11. The Hormuzeer stood to the northward, with soundings of 15 to 19  fathoms. After three hours run, with a fresh breeze, a reef and sand bank  were seen ahead, and the ship was veered to the south-west. Another reef  and bank were descried, soon afterward, in the west; and, at the same  time, a signal for seeing the long boat was made by the Chesterfield. In  the afternoon, the boat was picked up, and both ships anchored under  Stephens' Island.    An armed party was immediately sent on shore, to obtain intelligence if  possible, of the lost whale boat. The natives were assembled in hostile  array, upon the hills, sounding their conchs; but, after lancing a few  arrows, they fled. Several were wounded by the shots fired in return; but  they succeeded in escaping to a canoe at the back of the island, and  getting off; all except one boy, who was taken unhurt.* In the huts,  which were burnt, several things were found; and amongst them, a sheet of  copper which belonged to the Chesterfield.    [* It does not appear in the journal, when, or where this boy was set on  shore; nor is any further mention made of him.]    July 12. Stephens' Island was traversed all over; and a spike nail, with  the king's broad arrow upon it, was brought on board, and excited many  conjectures as to whence it came.* The plantations, huts, images, skulls,  and hands, were found similar to those of Darnley's Island. Amongst the  trees, there was one resembling an almond, the nuts of which were good.  The cocoa nut grows abundantly; especially in the south-eastern part,  where the trees formed a continued grove. The sole quadruped seen, except  rats, was a pretty animal of the opossum tribe. It was found in a cage;  and had probably been brought, either from New Guinea, or New South  Wales.**    [* It had probably been obtained from the crews of either the Providence  or Assistant; which had anchored under Stephens' Island, nine months  before.]    [** Mr. Bampton's description of this animal is briefly as follows. Size  and shape, of the opossum. Colour, yellowish white with brown spots. End  of the tail, deep red: prehensile. Eyes, reddish brown: red when  irritated. No visible ears. Used its paws in feeding: five nails to each.  Habit, dull and slothful: not savage. Food, maize, boiled rice, meat,  leaves, or any thing offered. Odour, very strong at times, and  disagreeable.]    July 13. A boat was sent to Campbell's Island; but it did not contain  either plantations, cocoa-nut trees, or fixed inhabitants. This, as also  Stephens' and Nepean's Islands, are mostly low and sandy; and surrounded  with extensive reefs, upon which, it was thought, the Indians pass from  one island to the other, at low water.    In the afternoon, the ships proceeded to the westward; but meeting with  many reefs, they hauled more to the north, and discovered _Bristow  Island_, lying close to the coast of New Guinea. Their attempts to find a  passage here, were fruitless; and after incurring much danger, and the  Chesterfield getting aground, they returned to their former anchorage, in  the evening of July 21. The banks, reefs, and lands, seen during these  eight days, will be found marked in Plate XIII.    Two canoes immediately came off from Stephens' Island; and one of the  natives remained on board the Hormuzeer till eight o'clock. He seemed to  be without fear; and when inquiry was made after the lost boat and  people, he pointed to a whale boat, and made signs that such an one had  been at Darnley's Island; and that six of the people were killed.* Many  presents were made to this man; and he was clothed, and sent on shore in  one of the boats.    [* Captain Hill and four of the seamen were murdered by the natives.  Messieurs Shaw and Carter were severely wounded; but with Ascott, the  remaining seaman, they got into the boat, cut the grapnel rope, and  escaped. They were without provisions or compass; and it being impossible  to reach the ships, which lay five leagues to windward, they bore away to  the west, through the Strait; in the hope of reaching Timor. On the tenth  day, they made land; which proved to be _Timor-laoet_. They there  obtained some relief to their great distress; and went on to an island  called by the natives, _Sarrett_; where Mr. Carter died: Messieurs Shaw  and Ascott sailed in a prow, for Banda, in the April following. See  Collins' _Account of the English Colony in New South Wales_. Vol. I. page  464, 465.]    July 22. The ships' crews beginning to feel the want of fresh water,  people were sent on shore to dig a well; and the natives, though they  still appeared shy and suspicious, gave them some assistance. On the  24th, the boats had discovered a passage to the south-westward; and as  the well produced little water, and no provision could be obtained, it  was determined to proceed onward, through the Strait, without further  delay.    They weighed the same afternoon; and anchored, at dusk, in 14 fathoms;  Campbell's Island bearing N. E. by E. to E. by N. 3/4 N.; and many other  small isles being in sight to the south-west and southward. Next day, the  25th, they steered S. by W. 1/2 W., from seven in the morning to six in the  evening; when they anchored in 17 fathoms, having islands in sight nearly  all round: the nearest at the distance of five or six miles. These  islands were small; but inhabitants were seen on the greater number; and  two canoes went off to the Chesterfield.    July 26. The ships proceeded westward, very slowly; the wind being at  south-west. In the morning of the 27th, they were at anchor in 11  fathoms; Dungeness Island bearing W. by N. to N. W. by W. 1/2 W., about six  miles; and Warriors Island N. N. W. 1/2 W. eight miles. Mr. Dell had passed  the preceding night upon one of the Six Sisters, which was called _Dove  Island_, bearing from the ship, S. S. E. six miles. A fire on the beach,  with two fish broiling upon it, bespoke the presence of inhabitants; but  on searching the island over, none could be discovered: it was thought  that they had fled to a larger island, it being connected with this by a  reef, which dries at low water. Mr. Dell had a seine with him, and caught  a dozen fine fish; but the object of remaining all night, that of taking  turtle, did not succeed; although large shells of them were found upon  the shore.    Dove Island is about one mile and a half in circumference; and covered  with trees and shrubs, the fragrance of whose flowers perfumed the air.  Amongst other birds, two beautiful doves were shot. The plumage of the  body was green; the head, bill, and legs, red; the tail, and under sides  of the wings, yellow. No huts, plantations, or other signs of fixed  inhabitants were seen; nor was there any fresh water.    On the return of the boat, the vessels weighed; and the wind being at W.  S. W., they worked through. between Dungeness and Warriors Islands, with  the flood tide. They then anchored in 11 fathoms; the first Island  bearing S. S. E. to S 1/2 W. three leagues, and the second E. by S. 1/2 S.    July 28. Having a fresh breeze at E. S. E., the long boat was sent ahead,  and the ships followed, to the westward. They passed Turtle-backed  Island, the Cap, and the Brothers, on one side, and Nichols' Key on the  other: the soundings gradually shoaling from 12 to 7 fathoms. Upon the  Cap, Mr. Bampton \"saw a volcano burning with great violence,\" which  induced him to give it the name of _Fire Island_; not knowing that it had  before been named. At noon, the Brothers, with the Cap and Turtle-backed  Island behind, bore S. E. by S. to S. 1/2 E. four miles; and Mount  Cornwallis N. 16 deg. W.    The water continued to shoal; and at three p.m., the ships anchored in 5  fathoms, sand, shells, and stones; the Brothers bearing E. by S. 1/4 S.  five leagues, and Mount Cornwallis N. by E. 1/4 E. There were two large  islands in sight in the S. S. W. 1/4 W. to S. W. 1/4 S., at the distance of  eight or ten leagues; and many nearer reefs in the same direction.    July 29. The long boat was sent to sound in the north-west; and when the  ebb tide slacked, the ships followed:"]]]
