And anyway, every one on Seward Peninsula, of any nationality,  is supposed to know that whatever a driver or his dogs need, in the All  Alaska Sweepstakes, should be his without a dissenting voice or a  rebellious foot.\"    \"Moose Jones used to say,\" quoted Ben rather timidly, \"that most  Malamutes are stubborn. Was the leader you spoke of, Mukluk, stubborn  too, in the race you won with him?\"    \"Yes, he was stubborn, all right. Do you recall,\" turning to the Woman,  \"the night I made him go 'round one corner for half an hour because he  refused to take the order the first time, and I was afraid of that  trait in him. It did not take long, however, to show him that I could  spend just as much time making him obey as he could spend defying me.  There's no use in whipping a dog like that. And with all his obstinacy,  he was, next to old Dubby, more capable of keeping a trail in a storm  than any dog I've ever handled. He had pads[2] of leather, and sinews of  steel. He was surely shy on beauty, though.\"    [Footnote 2: Feet.]    \"Of course,\" her voice dropping to almost a whisper, \"I would not admit  this anywhere but right here, in the privacy of the Kennel, and I  wouldn't say it here if the dogs could understand; but when it comes to  actual good looks, 'Scotty,'\" the Woman confessed, \"we are really not in  it with Bobby Brown's big, imposing Loping Malamutes, or Captain  Crimin's cunning little Siberians, with their pointed noses, prick ears,  and fluffy tails curled up over their backs like plumes.\"    \"Yes, they do make a most attractive team,\" admitted Allan justly; \"and  they're mighty good dogs too. But somehow they seem to lack the pride  and responsiveness that I find in those with bird-dog ancestry. Of  course each man prefers his own type, the one he has deliberately  chosen; and Fox Ramsay, and John or Charlie Johnson are convinced that  the tireless gait of their 'Russian Rats' in racing more than offsets  the sudden bursts of great speed of our 'Daddy Long Legs.'\"    [Illustration: A TEAM OF SIBERIANS]    The Woman shrugged her shoulders. \"Let us hope for the sake of the sport  that the matter will not be definitely decided for some time to come.  If, as Mark Twain says, 'it is a difference of opinion that makes horse  racing,' it seems to me it's about the widest possible difference of  opinion that makes dog racing; and each year's races have made the  difference more hopelessly pronounced.\"    \"Well, there'll always be disagreements as to the merits of the various  racing dogs; but for a good all around intelligent and faithful worker,  I have never found a dog that could outdo Dubby here,\" and \"Scotty\"  affectionately caressed the old huskie who had come into the Kennel with  his friend Texas Allan, the cat, to find out what was interfering with  an expected walk.    \"Sometimes Dub and I used to have disputes about a choice of roads, the  thickness of ice, or other details of traveling; but I will say that he  always listened tolerantly to all I had to offer in the way of  suggestions, and wagged his tail courteously to show there was no ill  feeling, even if he did get his way in the end. And, frankly, he was  generally right.\"    Which was, of course, only natural; for \"Scotty\" was, after all, only  human, while Dubby had the eyes, ears, and nose of his wolf forbears.    Dubby was a licensed character indeed, but Baldy realized, as did the  others, that his freedom was a reward of merit.    That he might not feel that his days of usefulness were over, he had  been given the honorary position of Keeper of the Kennel Meat; and much  of his life was now spent dozing peacefully before the meat-room door,  though he was ever ready to resent a covetous glance from unduly curious  dogs.    To be sure, there were besides the dignity and responsibility of his  high office certain perquisites that he thoroughly enjoyed--one of which  was the hospitality that was his to dispense.    He often invited old team-mates, or pitifully hungry puppies into his  quarters, where he would treat them to dog biscuit, dried fish, or a  drink of fresh water; but he never abused his privileges, and it was  only the worthy or helpless that appealed successfully to his charity.    His ample leisure now permitted also the cultivation of certain refined  tastes which had been dormant in his busy youth. He taught Fritz, the  house dog, whose only method of expression heretofore had been an  ear-piercing bark, to howl in a clear, high tenor, with wonderfully  sustained notes; so that together they would sit on the stable runway  and wail duets happily for hours at a time.    For his many virtues and great ability, as well as for these lighter  accomplishments, Baldy conceived an admiration for Dubby that would have  been boundless but for one weakness that was absolutely  incomprehensible--the huskie's devotion to the cat, Texas.    It was a strange friendship in a place where a cat's right to live at  all is contested every hour of the day, and where nine times nine lives  would not cover a span of more than a few months at the most, as a rule.  It had begun when Texas was little more than a kitten, and had wandered  away one day from the warm kitchen fire, out into the shed, and from  there into the street.    Delighted with her unaccustomed freedom, she chased a bit of whirling,  eddying paper across a strip of snow, into the angle of a cabin; then  turning, gazed into the face of a big, ferocious dog who was already  licking his chops suggestively.    Since the prey was safely cornered, he generously decided to share the  anticipated excitement with some boon companions. And so, giving three  short, sharp cries and repeating the call several times, he was joined  by two other malamutes who, eager for the fun of killing a cat, drew in  close beside him.    It had all happened in a moment; but in that moment Dubby, out for  exercise, came upon the scene. He was no lover of cats, be it  understood; and he had often been guilty of making short work of one if  it chanced to cross his path when he was in quest of adventure. But this  was the Allan cat. He had often seen the girls carry it about in their  arms; and while it seemed a strange perversion to caress a kitten when  there were puppies about, or even babies, still the peculiarities of  your Master's Family must be respected. Even, if necessary, to the  extreme limit of defending their pet cats.    Then, too, there was something that had appealed to him in the plucky  stand of the terrified little creature. Eyes dilated with fear, every  hair on end, sputtering and spitting, she had unsheathed her tiny claws  and was prepared to make a brave fight for her life. The chances were  hopelessly against her--the dogs did not intend to let her run--and  Dubby felt that it was butchery, not sport.    Also, if Texas was hurt, the girls would be sad, and cry, and not play  for a long time. He knew, because that happened when their terrier Tige  was run over. And so, with one bound, he jumped upon the instigator of  the trouble, and caught him by the shoulder with his still strong, sharp  teeth. The other dogs wheeled in surprise; and in an instant there was a  battle as bloody as it was short and decisive. Dubby was a marvelous  tactician--the others only novices, and in a very brief period there  were three well-minced malamutes who limped disconsolately in different  directions; leaving a conquering hero on the field, with the spoils of  war--a ruffled gray kitten in a shivering state of uncertainty as to  her ultimate fate, but too weak to make any further defense.    Dubby picked her up in his mouth, and carried her back to the house,  where he carefully deposited her inside the shed, and waited until some  one answered his scratches on the door.    It marked the beginning of a companionship that lasted for years. Every  fine afternoon Dubby would take Texas out for a stroll; and even after  she was a huge seventeen pound cat, well able to hold her own, it was a  reckless dog indeed that showed any hostility toward Texas when Dub was  her body-guard.    One readily comprehends that he might graciously accept her gratitude;  but, as the French Poodle's People say, \"Noblesse Oblige,\" and it  certainly seemed unnecessary that a dog of his achievement should flaunt  his affection for a mere cat in the eyes of the whole world.    While this caused strong disapproval in all canine circles, strangely  enough it apparently made no difference in his standing with men and  women. Mr. Fink, in his exalted position as President of the Nome Kennel  Club, and one of the most brilliant lawyers in Alaska besides, always  raised his hat to Dubby when they met, as a greeting from one keen mind  to another; for the man had watched the skill of the dog on the trail,  and knew that it was unsurpassed in the whole North. \"Scotty\" Allan  never failed to give every evidence of his sincere regard, and the Woman  had even perpetuated the undesirable association by having Dubby's  picture taken with Texas when they were out on one of their daily  promenades.    And so, admired by men and feared by dogs, the faithful huskie was  singularly exempt from the tragedies of a neglected, forlorn old age.    Ben regarded Dubby with admiring interest; and pondering for a while on  all that he had heard said, finally, \"Do you think, Mr. Allan, you'll  ever find any one dog that kin race like Kid and be as smart on the  trail as Dub?\" In his eagerness he did not wait for the reply. \"Don't  you s'pose if a dog's really good t' begin with, an' some one that loves  him lots learns him all the things a' racin' dog's got t' know, that  he'd turn out so wonderful that everybody in Alaska 'ud know how great  he was--mebbe everybody in the world?\"    The Woman smiled. \"Have you any one in mind, Ben?\"    \"Yes, ma'am, no, ma'am; I was only thinkin',\" he stammered as he  earnestly listened for \"Scotty's\" answer.

It was in vain we attempted to make them sensible of  their mistake, and to recal to their memory, that he, whom they demanded,  had returned on board the frigate, as they had themselves seen; their cries  drowned the voice of reason; every thing was in their eyes Danglas; they  saw him every where, they furiously and unceasingly demanded his head, and  it was only by force of arms, that we succeeded in repressing their rage,  and in silencing their frightful cries.    On this occasion we had also reason to be alarmed for the safety of Mr.  Coudin. Wounded and fatigued by the attacks which we had sustained with the  disaffected, and in which he had displayed the most dauntless courage, he  was reposing on a barrel, holding in his arms a sailor boy, of twelve years  of age, to whom he had attached himself. The mutineers seized him with his  barrel, and threw him into the sea with the boy, whom he still held fast;  notwithstanding this burden, he had the presence of mind to catch hold of  the raft, and to save himself from this extreme danger. Dreadful night! thy  gloomy veil covered these cruel combats, instigated by the most terrible  despair.    We cannot conceive how a handful of individuals could resist such a  considerable number of madmen. There were, certainly, not more than twenty  of us to resist all these furious wretches. Let it, however, not be  imagined, that we preserved our reason unimpaired amidst all this disorder;  terror, alarm, the most cruel privations had greatly affected our  intellectual faculties; but being a little less deranged than the  unfortunate soldiers, we energetically opposed their determination to cut  the cords of the raft. Let us be allowed to make some reflections on the  various sensations with which we were affected.    The very first day, Mr. Griffon lost his senses so entirely, that he threw  himself into the sea, intending to drown himself. Mr. Savigny saved him  with his own hand. His discourse was vague and unconnected. He threw  himself into the water a second time, but by a kind of instinct he kept  hold of one of the cross pieces of the raft: and was again rescued.    The following is an account of what Mr. Savigny experienced in the  beginning of the night. His eyes closed in spite of himself, and he felt a  general lethargy; in this situation the most agreeable images played before  his fancy; he saw around him, a country covered with fine plantations, and  he found himself in the presence of objects which delighted all his senses;  yet he reasoned on his situation, and felt that courage alone would recover  him from this species of trance; he asked the master gunner of the frigate  for some wine: who procured him a little; and he recovered in a degree from  this state of torpor. If the unfortunate men, when they were attacked by  these first symptoms, had not had resolution to struggle against them,  their death was certain. Some became furious; others threw themselves into  the sea, taking leave of their comrades with great coolness; some said  \"Fear nothing, I am going to fetch you assistance: in a short time you will  see me again.\" In the midst of this general madness, some unfortunate  wretches were seen to rush upon their comrades with their sabres drawn,  demanding the _wing of a chicken_, or _bread_ to appease the hunger which  devoured them; others called for their hammocks, \"_to go_,\" they said,  \"_between the decks of the frigate and take some moments' repose_.\" Many  fancied themselves still on board the Medusa, surrounded with the same  objects which they saw there every day. Some saw ships, and called them to  their assistance, or a harbour, in the back ground of which there was a  magnificent city.    Mr. Correard fancied he was travelling through the fine plains of Italy;  one of the officers said to him, gravely, \"_I remember that we have been  deserted by the boats; but fear nothing; I have just written to the  governor, and in a few hours we shall be saved._\" Mr. Correard replied in  the same tone, and as if he had been in an ordinary situation, \"_Have you a  pigeon to carry your orders with as much celerity?_\" The cries and the  tumult soon roused us from the state in which we were plunged; but scarcely  was tranquillity restored, when we sunk back into the same species of  trance: so that the next day we seemed to awake from a painful dream, and  asked our companions if, during their sleep, they had seen combats and  heard cries of despair. Some of them replied that they had been continually  disturbed by the same visions, and that they were exhausted with fatigue:  all thought themselves deceived by the illusions of a frightful dream.    When we recal to our minds those terrible scenes, they present themselves  to our imagination like those frightful dreams which sometimes make a  profound impression on us; so that, when we awake, we remember the  different circumstances which rendered our sleep so agitated. All these  horrible events, from which we have escaped by a miracle, appear to us like  a point in our existence: we compare them with the fits of a burning fever,  which has been accompanied by a delirium: a thousand objects appear before  the imagination of the patient: when restored to health, he sometimes  recollects the visions that have tormented him during the fever which  consumed him, and exalted his imagination. We were really seized with a  fever on the brain, the consequence of a mental exaltation carried to the  extreme. As soon as daylight beamed upon us, we were much more calm:  darkness brought with it a renewal of the disorder in our weakened  intellects. We observed in ourselves that the natural terror, inspired by  the cruel situation in which we were, greatly increased in the silence of  the night: then all objects seemed to us much more terrible.    After these different combats, worn out with fatigue, want of food and of  sleep, we endeavoured to take a few moments' repose, at length daylight  came, and disclosed all the horrors of the scene. A great number had, in  their delirium, thrown themselves into the sea: we found that between sixty  and sixty-five men had perished during the night; we calculated that, at  least, a fourth part had drowned themselves in despair. We had lost only  two on our side, neither of whom was an officer. The deepest despondency  was painted on every face; every one, now that he was come to himself, was  sensible of his situation; some of us, shedding tears of despair, bitterly  deplored the rigour of our fate.    We soon discovered a new misfortune; the rebels, during the tumult, had  thrown into the sea two barrels of wine, and the only two casks of water  that we had on the raft.[24] As soon as Mr. Correard perceived that they  were going to throw the wine into the sea, and that the barrels were almost  entirely made loose, he resolved to place himself on one of them; where he  was continually thrown to and fro by the impulse of the waves; but he did  not let go his hold. His example was followed by some others, who seized  the second cask, and remained some hours at that dangerous post. After much  trouble they had succeeded in saving these two casks; which being every  moment violently driven against their legs had bruised them severely. Being  unable to hold out any longer, they made some representations to those who,  with Mr. Savigny, employed all their efforts to maintain order and preserve  the raft. One of them took his (Mr. Correard) place; others relieved the  rest: but finding this service too difficult, and being assaulted by the  mutineers, they forsook this post. Then the barrels were thrown into the  sea.    Two casks of wine had been consumed the preceding day; we had only one  left, and we were above sixty in number; so that it was necessary to put  ourselves on half allowance.    At daybreak the sea grew calm, which enabled us to put up our mast again;  we then did our utmost to direct our course towards the coast. Whether it  were an illusion or reality we thought we saw it, and that we distinguished  the burning air of the Zaara Desert. It is, in fact, very probable that we  were not very distant from it, for we had had winds from the sea which had  blown violently. In the sequel we spread the sail indifferently to every  wind that blew, so that one day we approached the coast, on the next ran  into the open sea.    As soon as our mast was replaced, we made a distribution of wine; the  unhappy soldiers murmured and accused us for privations, which we bore as  well as they: they fell down with fatigue. For forty-eight hours we had  taken nothing, and had been obliged to struggle incessantly against a  stormy sea; like them we could hardly support ourselves; courage alone  still made us act. We resolved to employ all possible means to procure  fish. We collected all the tags from the soldiers, and made little hooks of  them; we bent a bayonet to catch sharks: all this availed us nothing; the  currents carried our hooks under the raft, where they got entangled. A  shark bit at the bayonet, and straightened it. We gave up our project. But  an extreme resource was necessary to preserve our wretched existence. We  tremble with horror at being obliged to mention that which we made use of!  we feel our pen drop from our hand; a deathlike chill pervades all our  limbs; our hair stands erect on our heads!--Reader, we beseech you, do not  feel indignation towards men who are already too unfortunate; but have  compassion on them, and shed some tears of pity on their unhappy fate.    Those whom death had spared in the disastrous night which we have just  described, fell upon the dead bodies with which the raft was covered, and  cut off pieces, which some instantly devoured. Many did not touch them;  almost all the officers were of this number. Seeing that this horrid  nourishment had given strength to those who had made use "]]]
