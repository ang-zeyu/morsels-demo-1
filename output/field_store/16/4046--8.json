He says of himself that he now  lived in a world of disesteem. Nor was there wanting, to complete  his discomfiture, the practical parody of the doctrine of divorce.  A Mistress Attaway, lacewoman in Bell-alley, and she-preacher in.  Coleman-street, had been reading Master Milton's book, and remembered  that she had an unsanctified husband, who did not speak the language  of Canaan. She further reflected that Mr. Attaway was not only  unsanctified, but was also absent with the army, while William  Jenney was on the spot, and, like herself, also a preacher. Could a  \"scandalised\" Presbyterian help pointing the finger of triumphant  scorn at such examples, the natural fruits of that mischievous book,  _The Doctrine and Discipline_?    Beyond the stage of scandal and disesteem the matter did not proceed.  In dedicating _The Doctrine and Discipline_ to the Parliament, Milton  had specially called on that assembly to legislate for the relief of  men who were encumbered with unsuitable spouses. No notice was taken  of this appeal, as there was far other work on hand, and no particular  pressure from without in the direction of Milton's suit. Divorce for  incompatibility of temper remained his private crotchet, or obtained  converts only among his fellow-sufferers, who, however numerous, did  not form a body important enough to enforce by clamour their demand  for relief.    Milton was not very well pleased to find that the Parliament had no  ear for the bitter cry of distress wrung from their ardent admirer and  staunch adherent. Accordingly, in 1645, in dedicating the last of  the divorce pamphlets, which, he entitled _Tetrachordon_, to the  Parliament, he concluded with a threat, \"If the law make not a  timely provision, let the law, as reason is, bear the censure of the  consequences.\"    This threat he was prepared to put in execution, and did, in 1645, as  Phillips tells us, contemplate a union, which could not have been a  marriage, with another woman. He was able at this time to find some  part of that solace of conversation which his wife failed to give him,  among his female acquaintance. Especially we find him at home in the  house of one of the Parliamentary women, the Lady Margaret Ley, a lady  \"of great wit and ingenuity,\" the \"honoured Margaret\" of Sonnet x. But  the Lady Margaret was a married woman, being the wife of a Captain  Hobson, a \"very accomplished gentleman,\" of the Isle of Wight. The  young lady who was the object of his attentions, and who, if she were  the \"virtuous young lady\" of Sonnet ix., was \"in the prime of earliest  youth,\" was a daughter of a Dr. Davis, of whom nothing else is now  known. She is described by Phillips, who may have seen her, as a very  handsome and witty gentlewoman. Though Milton was ready to brave  public opinion. Miss Davis was not. And so the suit hung, when all  schemes of the kind were pat an end to by the unexpected submission of  Mary Powell.    Since October, 1643, when Milton's messenger had been dismissed  from Forest Hill, the face of the civil struggle was changed. The  Presbyterian army had been replaced by that of the Independents, and  the immediate consequence had been the decline of the royal cause,  consummated by its total ruin on the day of Naseby, in June, 1645.  Oxford was closely invested, Forest Hill occupied by the besiegers,  and the Powell family compelled to take refuge within the lines of  the city. Financial bankruptcy, too, had overtaken the Powells. These  influences, rather than any rumours which may hare reached them of  Milton's designs in regard to Miss Davis, wrought a change in the  views of the Powell family. By the triumph of the Independents Mr.  Milton was become a man of consideration, and might be useful as a  protector. They concluded that the best thing they could do was to  seek a reconciliation. There were not wanting friends of Milton's  also, some perhaps divining his secret discontent, who thought that  such reconciliation would be better for him too, than perilling his  happiness upon the experiment of an illegal connexion. A conspiracy of  the friends of both parties contrived to introduce Mary Powell into  a house where Milton often visited in St. Martin's-le-Grand. She was  secreted in an adjoining room, on an occasion when Milton was known  to be coming, and he was surprised by seeing her suddenly brought in,  throw herself on her knees, and ask to be forgiven. The poor young  thing, now two years older and wiser, but still only nineteen,  pleaded, truly or falsely, that her mother \"had been all along the  chief promoter of her frowardness\" Milton, with a \"noble leonine  clemency\" which became him, cared not for excuses for the past. It was  enough that she was come back, and was willing to live with him as his  wife. He received her at once, and not only her, but on the surrender  of Oxford, in June, 1646, and the sequestration of Forest Hill, took  in the whole family of Powells, including the mother-in-law, whose  influence with her daughter might even again trouble his peace.    It is impossible not to see that Milton had this impressive scene,  enacted in St. Martin's-le-Grand in 1645, before his mind, when he  wrote, twenty years afterwards, the lines in _Paradise Lost_, x.  937:--            ... Eve, with tears that ceas'd not flowing      And tresses all disorder'd, at his feet      Fell humble, and embracing them, besought      His peace...                          ... Her lowly plight      Immovable, till peace obtain'd from fault      Acknowledg'd and deplor'd, in Adam wrought      Commiseration; soon his heart relented      Tow'rds her, his life so late and sole delight,      Now at his feet submissive in distress!      Creature so fair his reconcilement seeking,           *       *       *       *       *        At once disarm'd, his anger all he lost.    The garden-house in Aldersgate-street had before been found too small  for the pupils who were being now pressed upon Milton. It was to a  larger house in Barbican, a side street leading out of Aldersgate,  that he brought the Powells and Mary Milton. Milton probably abated  his exactions on the point of companionship, and learned to be content  with her acquiescence in the duties of a wife. In July, 1646, she  became a mother, and bore in all four children. Of these, three, all  daughters, lived to grow up. Mary Milton herself died in giving birth  to the fourth child in the summer of 1652. She was only twenty-six,  and had been married to Milton nine years.          CHAPTER VI    PAMPHLETS.      We have now seen Milton engaged in teaching and writing on education,  involved in domestic unhappiness, and speculating on the obligations  of marriage. But neither of these topics formed the principal  occupation of his mind during these years. He had renounced a  cherished scheme of travel because his countrymen were engaged at home  in contending for their liberties, and it could not but be that the  gradually intensified stages of that struggle engrossed his interest,  and claimed his participation.    So imperative did he regard this claim that he allowed it to override  the purposed dedication of his life to poetry. Not indeed for ever and  aye, but for a time. As he had renounced Greece, the Aegean Isles,  Thebes, and the East for the fight for freedom, so now to the same  cause he postponed the composition of his epic of Arthurian romance,  or whatever his mind \"in the spacious circuits of her musing proposed  to herself of highest hope and hardest attempting.\" No doubt at first,  in thus deferring the work of his life, he thought the delay would be  for a brief space. He did not foresee that having once taken an oar,  he would be chained to it for more than twenty years, and that he  would finally owe his release to the ruin of the cause he had served.  But for the Restoration and the overthrow of the Puritans, we should  never have had the great Puritan epic.    The period then of his political activity is to be regarded as an  episode in the life of the poet Milton. It is indeed an episode which  fills twenty years, and those the most vigorous years of manhood, from  his thirty-second to his fifty-second year. He himself was conscious  of the sacrifice he was making, and apologises to the public for thus  defrauding them of the better work which he stood pledged to execute.  As he puts it, there was no choice for him. He could not help himself,  at this critical juncture, \"when the Church of God was at the foot  of her insulting enemies;\" he would never have ceased to reproach  himself, if he had refused to employ the fruits of his studies in her  behalf. He saw also that a generation inflamed by the passions of  conflict, and looking in breathless suspense for the issue of battles,  was not in a mood to attend to poetry. Nor, indeed, was he ready to  write, \"not having yet (this is in 1642) completed to my mind the full  circle of my private studies.\"    But though he is drawn into the strife against his will, and in  defiance of his genius, when he is in it, he throws into it the whole  vehemence of his nature. The pamphlet period, I have said, is an  episode in the life of the poet. But it is a genuine part of Milton's  life. However his ambition may have been set upon an epic crown, his  zeal for what he calls the church was an equal passion, nay had, in  his judgment, a paramount claim upon him, He is a zealot among  the zealots; his cause is the cause of God; and the sword of the  Independents is the sword of the Lord and of Gideon. He does not  refute opponents, but curses enemies. Yet his rage, even when most  delirious, is always a Miltonic rage; it is grand, sublime, terrible!  Mingled with the scurrilities of the theological brawl are passages  of the noblest English ever written.

Love's sowing is more agreeable than love's harvest: or,  let us put it, he allures us into byways leading nowhither, among  blossoms which fall before the first rough wind: so at the last, with  much excitement and breath and valuable time quite wasted, we find that  the end of all is death. Then would it have been more shrewd, dear  ladies, to have avoided love? To the contrary, we were unspeakably wise  to indulge the high-hearted insanity that love induced; since love alone  can lend young people rapture, however transiently, in a world wherein  the result of every human endeavor is transient, and the end of all is  death.\"    Then Jurgen courteously bowed to his dead loves, and left them, and  went forward as the cave stretched.    But now the light was behind him, so that Jurgen's shadow, as he  came to a sharp turn in the cave, loomed suddenly upon the cave  wall, confronting him. This shadow was clear-cut and unarguable.    Jurgen regarded it intently. He turned this way, then the other; he  looked behind him, raised one hand, shook his head tentatively; then  he twisted his head sideways with his chin well lifted, and squinted  so as to get a profile view of this shadow. Whatever Jurgen did the  shadow repeated, which was natural enough. The odd part was that it  in nothing resembled the shadow which ought to attend any man, and  this was an uncomfortable discovery to make in loneliness deep under  ground.    \"I do not exactly like this,\" said Jurgen. \"Upon my word, I do not  like this at all. It does not seem fair. It is perfectly  preposterous. Well\"--and here he shrugged,--\"well, and what could  anybody expect me to do about it? Ah, what indeed! So I shall treat  the incident with dignified contempt, and continue my exploration of  this cave.\"          9.    The Orthodox Rescue of Guenevere      Now the tale tells how the cave narrowed and again turned sharply,  so that Jurgen came as through a corridor into quite another sort of  underground chamber. Yet this also was a discomfortable place.    Here suspended from the roof of the vault was a kettle of quivering  red flames. These lighted a very old and villainous looking man in  full armor, girded with a sword, and crowned royally: he sat erect  upon a throne, motionless, with staring eyes that saw nothing. Back  of him Jurgen noted many warriors seated in rows, and all staring at  Jurgen with wide-open eyes that saw nothing. The red flaming of the  kettle was reflected in all these eyes, and to observe this was not  pleasant.    Jurgen waited non-committally. Nothing happened. Then Jurgen saw  that at this unengaging monarch's feet were three chests. The lids  had been ripped from two of them, and these were filled with silver  coins. Upon the middle chest, immediately before the king, sat a  woman, with her face resting against the knees of the glaring,  withered, motionless, old rascal.    \"And this is a young woman. Obviously! Observe the glint of that  thick coil of hair! the rich curve of the neck! Oh, clearly, a  tidbit fit to fight for, against any moderate odds!\"    So ran the thoughts of Jurgen. Bold as a dragon now, he stepped  forward and lifted the girl's head.    Her eyes were closed. She was, even so, the most beautiful creature  Jurgen had ever imagined.    \"She does not breathe. And yet, unless memory fails me, this is  certainly a living woman in my arms. Evidently this is a sleep  induced by necromancy. Well, it is not for nothing I have read so  many fairy tales. There are orthodoxies to be observed in the  awakening of every enchanted princess. And Lisa, wherever she may  be, poor dear! is nowhere in this neighborhood, because I hear  nobody talking. So I may consider myself at liberty to do the  traditional thing by this princess. Indeed, it is the only fair  thing for me to do, and justice demands it.\"    In consequence, Jurgen kissed the girl. Her lips parted and  softened, and they assumed a not unpleasant sort of submissive  ardor. Her eyes, enormous when seen thus closely, had languorously  opened, had viewed him without wonder, and then the lids had fallen,  about half-way, just as, Jurgen remembered, the eyelids of a woman  ought to do when she is being kissed properly. She clung a little,  and now she shivered a little, but not with cold: Jurgen perfectly  remembered that ecstatic shudder convulsing a woman's body:  everything, in fine, was quite as it should be. So Jurgen put an end  to the kiss, which, as you may surmise, was a tolerably lengthy  affair.    His heart was pounding as though determined to burst from his body,  and he could feel the blood tingling at his finger-tips. He wondered  what in the world had come over him, who was too old for such  emotions.    Yet, truly, this was the loveliest girl that Jurgen had ever  imagined. Fair was she to look on, with her shining gray eyes and  small smiling lips, a fairer person might no man boast of having  seen. And she regarded Jurgen graciously, with her cheeks flushed by  that red flickering overhead, and she was very lovely to observe.  She was clothed in a robe of flame-colored silk, and about her neck  was a collar of red gold. When she spoke her voice was music.    \"I knew that you would come,\" the girl said, happily.    \"I am very glad that I came,\" observed Jurgen.    \"But time presses.\"    \"Time sets an admirable example, my dear Princess--\"    \"Oh, messire, but do you not perceive that you have brought life  into this horrible place! You have given of this life to me, in the  most direct and speedy fashion. But life is very contagious. Already  it is spreading by infection.\"    And Jurgen regarded the old king, as the girl indicated. The  withered ruffian stayed motionless: but from his nostrils came slow  augmenting jets of vapor, as though he were beginning to breathe in  a chill place. This was odd, because the cave was not cold.    \"And all the others too are snorting smoke,\" says Jurgen. \"Upon my  word I think this is a delightful place to be leaving.\"    First, though, he unfastened the king's sword-belt, and girded  himself therewith, sword, dagger and all. \"Now I have arms befitting  my fine shirt,\" says Jurgen.    Then the girl showed him a sort of passage way, by which they  ascended forty-nine steps roughly hewn in stone, and so came to  daylight. At the top of the stairway was an iron trapdoor, and this  door at the girl's instruction Jurgen lowered. There was no way of  fastening the door from without.    \"But Thragnar is not to be stopped by bolts or padlocks,\" the girl  said. \"Instead, we must straightway mark this door with a cross,  since that is a symbol which Thragnar cannot pass.\"    Jurgen's hand had gone instinctively to his throat. Now he shrugged.  \"My dear young lady, I no longer carry the cross. I must fight  Thragnar with other weapons.\"    \"Two sticks will serve, laid crosswise--\"    Jurgen submitted that nothing would be easier than to lift the  trapdoor, and thus dislodge the sticks. \"They will tumble apart  without anyone having to touch them, and then what becomes of your  crucifix?\"    \"Why, how quickly you think of everything!\" she said, admiringly.  \"Here is a strip from my sleeve, then. We will tie the twigs  together.\"    Jurgen did this, and laid upon the trapdoor a recognizable crucifix.  \"Still, when anyone raises the trapdoor whatever lies upon it will  fall off. Without disparaging the potency of your charm, I cannot  but observe that in this case it is peculiarly difficult to handle.  Magician or no, I would put heartier faith in a stout padlock.\"    So the girl tore another strip, from the hem of her gown, and then  another from her right sleeve, and with these they fastened their  cross to the surface of the trapdoor, in such a fashion that the  twigs could not be dislodged from beneath. They mounted the fine  steed whose bridle was marked with a coronet, the girl riding  pillion, and they turned westward, since the girl said this was  best.    For, as she now told Jurgen, she was Guenevere, the daughter of  Gogyrvan, King of Glathion and the Red Islands. So Jurgen told her  he was the Duke of Logreus, because he felt it was not appropriate  for a pawnbroker to be rescuing princesses: and he swore, too, that  he would restore her safely to her father, whatever Thragnar might  attempt. And all the story of her nefarious capture and imprisonment  by King Thragnar did Dame Guenevere relate to Jurgen, as they rode  together through the pleasant May morning.    She considered the Troll King could not well molest them. \"For now  you have his charmed sword, Caliburn, the only weapon with which  Thragnar can be slain. Besides, the sign of the cross he cannot  pass. He beholds and trembles.\"    \"My dear Princess, he has but to push up the trapdoor from beneath,  and the cross, being tied to the trapdoor, is promptly moved out of  his way. Failing this expedient, he can always come out of the cave  by the other opening, through which I entered. If this Thragnar has  any intelligence at all and a reasonable amount of tenacity, he will  presently be at hand.\"    \"Even so, he can do no harm unless we accept a present from him. The  difficulty is that he will come in disguise.\"    \"Why, then, we will accept gifts from nobody.\"    \"There is, moreover, a sign by which you may distinguish Thragnar.  For if you deny what he says, he will promptly concede you are in  the right. This was the curse put upon him by Miramon Lluagor, for a  detection and a hindrance.\"    \"By that unhuman trait,\" says Jurgen, \"Thragnar ought to be very  easy to distinguish.\"          10.    Pitiful Disguises of Thragnar      Next, the tale tells that as Jurgen and the Princess were nearing  Gihon, a man came riding toward them, full armed in black, and  having a red serpent with an apple in its mouth painted upon his  shield.    \"Sir knight,\" says he, speaking hollowly from the closed helmet,  \"you must yield to me "]]]
