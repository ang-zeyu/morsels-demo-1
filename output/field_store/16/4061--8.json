Credit to a great  amount is obtained with difficulty, as affairs of individuals are in  general much more publicly known than in Europe; failures are,  therefore, of rare occurrence; and when a man becomes embarrassed either  from an unsuccessful speculation or inevitable losses, his creditors  forbear to press their demands, and are generally paid after a few  years patience;    [p.40] thereby saving the merchants credit, and preventing the  consequences of bankruptcy.    On the other hand, however, the Eastern merchants are liable to the  imputation of uncertainty in their payments, which they often delay  beyond the stipulated periods. Even the most respectable among them do  not hesitate to put off the payment of a debt for months; and it may be  stated as a general rule in Egypt and Syria, that assignments are never  fully paid till after a lapse of nearly double the time named. But this,  I was often assured by the best informed people here, has only become  the practice within the last twenty or thirty years, and is a  consequence of the universal decay of commerce and diminution of capital  in the Levant. At Djidda, as I have already observed, almost all  bargains are made for ready money.    Three sellers of copper vessels. A variety of well-tinned copper vessels  may be found in every Arabian kitchen. Even the Bedouins have one  capacious boiler, at least, in every tent. The whole of these come from  Egypt. The most conspicuous article of this description is the abrík, or  water-pot, with which the Muselman performs his ablutions. No Turkish  pilgrim arrives in the Hedjaz without one of these pots, or at least he  purchases one at Djidda. There are found, also, in the market a few  copper vessels from China, brought hither by the Malays; but they are  not tinned, and though the copper seems to be of a much finer quality  than that of Anatolia, which is brought from Cairo, the Arabs dislike to  use it.    Four barbers shops. The barbers are at once the surgeons and physicians  of this country. They know how to let blood, and to compound different  sorts of aperient medicines. The few Arabians whose beards are longer  and thicker than those of their country-men usually are, take great  pains in keeping them neatly cut, so that not a hair may project beyond  another. The mustachios are    [p.41] always cut closely, and never allowed to hang over the lips; in  this they differ from the northern Turks, who seldom touch their thick  bushy mustachios with scissors. The barbers shops are frequented by  loungers of the lower classes, who resort thither to hear the news, and  amuse themselves with conversation. In one of these shops I found  established a seal-engraver of Persian origin; he had a good deal of  business, for a pilgrim, after he has performed his visits to the holy  places, usually adds to the name on his seal the words El Hadjy, or The  Pilgrim.    Four tailors. Many others live in various parts of the town; they are  mostly foreigners. Tousoun Pashas court-tailor was a Christian of  Bosnia, and exercised authority over all the other tailors in the town;  who complained bitterly of being subjected, not only to the commands and  insults, but often to the stick of this Christian.    Five makers of nâl, or sandals. There is not one shoe-maker in the  Hedjaz. Those who wear shoes or slippers buy them of the merchants by  whom they are imported from Egypt.    The shape of the sandals used throughout Arabia differs in every  province; and to those delineated by Niebuhr, a dozen other forms might  be added. Some are peculiar to certain classes: a merchant, for  instance, would not wear the sandals of a mariner. This is the case in  Turkey with regard to shoes, of which each province and class has its  particular shape. Egypt and Abyssinia furnish the thick leather used in  making sandals.    Three shops where water-skins brought from Sowakin and Egypt are sold  and repaired. The greater part of the Hedjaz is furnished with water-  skins from Sowakin; they are in great request, being very light, and  sewed with much neatness. A Sowakin water-skin will last, in daily use,  about three or four months.    Two turners, who bore pipe-tubes, and make beads, &c.    Three sellers of sweet-oils or essences, civet, aloe-wood, balsam of  Mekka, and rose-water from Fayoum in Egypt. The civet    [p.42] and Mekka balsam can seldom be bought pure, except at first hand.  The Habesh or Abyssinian merchants bring the civet in large cow-horns;  they sold it at four piastres per drachm in the year 1814. Musk also is  sold in these shops, the best at two dollars per metkal. It is brought  hither by the Indian and Persian Hadjys.    One watchmaker, a Turk. All the Mekka and Djidda merchants wear watches,  many of which are of good English manufacture; they are brought either  from India, or by the Hadjys from Constantinople. As it often happens  that the Turkish pilgrims want money in the Hedjaz, they are sometimes  compelled to dispose of their most valuable articles; the watch is  always the first, then the pistols and sabre, and lastly the fine pipe,  and best copy of the Korán: all these articles are consequently very  common in the auction-markets of Djidda and Mekka.    One seller of Turkish and Persian tobacco-pipes. The latter come  principally from Baghdad. The wealthy often display in their sitting-  rooms a whole range of the finest nargils: these cost as much as one  hundred dollars a piece.    Seven money-dealers, or seráfs. They sit upon benches in the open  street, with a large box before them containing the money. Formerly,  these seráfs were all Jews, as is still the case, with few exceptions,  at Cairo, Damascus, and Aleppo; but since the Sherif-Serour drove the  Jews out of the Hedjaz, the Djiddawys themselves have taken up the  profession, to which their natural disposition and habits incline them.  There is usually at each stand a partnership of them, comprising half a  dozen individuals. A large amount of cash is required to carry on the  business; but it is very profitable. The value of money changes here  more rapidly than in any part of the East with which I am acquainted.  The price of dollars and sequins fluctuates almost daily, and the seráfs  are always sure to be gainers. During the stay of the Indian fleet, the  value of a dollar becomes very high. While I was at Djidda, it rose    [p.43] to eleven and twelve piastres. After the departure of the fleet,  when there is no immediate demand for dollars, the price falls; in  January, 1815, it was at nine piastres. The gold coins vary in  proportion.    Formerly the old current coins of the Hedjaz were Venetian and Hungarian  sequins, Spanish dollars, and money coined at Constantinople. Egyptian  coins were wholly excluded; [According to the historians of Mekka, it  appears that the sherifs there assumed the privilege of coining their  own money, in the name of the Sultan of Constantinople, as late as the  seventeenth century; but this is now abandoned.] but since the arrival  of the troops of Mohammed Ali Pasha, all the Cairo coins have been  forcibly put into circulation, and the Cairo silver money is now next in  estimation to the Spanish dollar. The Pasha of Egypt, who enjoys the  right of coining money in the name of the Sultan, has lately much abused  this privilege. In 1815, he farmed out the mint for a yearly sum of  seven millions of piastres, which is, at the present rate of exchange,  about two hundred thousand pounds sterling, obliging the people to take  the dollar at eight of his piastres, although it is well known to be now  worth twenty-two or twenty-three. In the Hedjaz he has not the same  means of enforcing his despotic measures to their full extent; and thus  it happens that in the interior of the country, where the Turkish troops  are placed, the value of the dollar is eighteen or nineteen piastres.  The Bedouins, however, refuse to take the Egyptian piastres, even at a  depreciation, and will receive nothing but dollars; a determination to  which the Pasha himself has been frequently obliged to yield.    The párá, or smallest Turkish coin, (here called diwany,) is current all  over the Hedjaz, and in great request, from its being of more intrinsic  value than the piastre, though coined like them at Cairo. Forty párás  make a piastre; but in the time of the Hadj, when small change is  necessary for the immense daily traffic of the pilgrims, the seráfs gave  twenty-five párás only in    [p.44] change for the piastre. A few Indian rupees are seen in the  Djidda market, but they have no currency. I never met with any money  coined by the Imám of Yemen.    In the same great street of shops are ten large okales, always full of  strangers and goods. Most of them were formerly the property of the  sherif; they now belong to the Pasha, who levies an annual rent on the  merchants. In Syria these buildings are called khans; in the Hedjaz  hosh, which, in the dialect of Egypt, means a court-yard.    In a street adjoining the great market-place live a few artisans,  blacksmiths, silversmiths, carpenters, some butchers, &c. most of them  natives of Egypt.    The reader will perceive, by the foregoing pages, that Djidda depends  for its commodities entirely on importations either from Egypt or the  East Indies; and this is the case even to the most trifling article. The  want of hands, and the high price of manual labour, but still more the  indolence and want of industry inherent in the natives of the Hedjaz,  have hitherto prevented them from establishing any kind of manufactory,  except of the most indispensable articles. In this respect they offer a  contrast to the Syrian and Egyptian Arabs, who in general are  industrious, and who, in spite of the obstacles often thrown in their  way by the government,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9479"],[0,"The Boy Life of Napoleon, Afterwards Emperor of the French (#11)"],[1,"to old Bouquet.\"    For, like all English boys, this young Lawley mingled with his love of  justice an equal love for teasing: and like most of the boys at Brienne  school, he declared it to be \"great fun to get the little Corsican mad.\"    \"Then must you help me to get away from here,\" Napoleon declared. \"Look  you, Lawley!\" and the boy in great secrecy pulled a paper from his  pocket; \"see now what I have written.\"    The English boy took the paper, ran his eye over it, and laughed as  loudly as he dared while on duty.    \"My eye!\" he said, \"it's in English, and pretty fair English too. A  letter to the British Admiralty? Permission to enter the British navy as  a midshipman, eh? Well, you Bonaparte, you are a cool one. A Frenchman  in the British navy! Fancy now!\"    \"No, sir; a Corsican,\" replied Napoleon. \"Why should it not be so? What  have I received but scorn and insult from these Frenchmen? You English  are more fair, and England is the friend of Corsica. Why should I not  become a midshipman in your navy? The only difficulty, I am afraid, will  be my religion.\"    \"Your religion!\" cried Lawley, with a laugh; \"why, you young rascal! I  don't believe you have any religion at all.\"    \"But my family have,\" Napoleon protested. \"My mother's race, the  Ramolini\" (and the boy rolled out the name as if that respectable farmer  family were dukes or emperors at least), \"are very strict. I should  be disinherited if I showed any signs of becoming a heretic like you  English; and if I joined the British navy, would I not be compelled to  become a heretic, like you, Lawley?\"    Lawley burst into such a loud laugh over the boy's religious scruples,  of which he had never before seen evidence, that he aroused one of the  teachers with his noise, and had to scud away, for fear of being caught,  and punished for neglect of duty.    But he kept Napoleon's letter of application. He must have sent it,  either in fun, or with some desire to befriend this badgered Corsican  boy; for to-day Napoleon's letter still exists in the crowded English  department, wherein are filed the archives of the British Admiralty.    At last, by the interest of certain of the friends whom the boy's  misfortune, if not his pluck, had made for him--such lads as Lawley, the  English boy, Bourrienne, Lauriston, and Father Patrault, the teacher of  mathematics,--Napoleon was liberated with a reprimand; while the boy who  had caused all the trouble went unpunished, save for the headache that  Napoleon's well-aimed stone had given him and the scar the blow had  left.    But the boy could not long stay out of trouble. The next time it came  about, friendship, and not vindictiveness, was the cause.    Napoleon did not forget the good offices of his friends. Indeed,  Napoleon never forgot a benefit. His final fall from his great power  came, largely, because of the very men whom he had honored and enriched,  out of friendship or appreciation for services performed in his behalf.    One day young Lauriston, who was on duty as a sort of sentry in the  chestnut avenue that was one of Napoleon's favorite walks, left his  post, and joining Napoleon, begged him to help him in a problem in  mathematics which he had been too lazy or too stupid to solve.    \"We will go to your garden, Straw-nose,\" said Lauriston; for both friend  and foe, after the manner of boys, used the nicknames that had by common  consent been fastened upon their schoolfellows.    \"We will not, then,\" Napoleon returned. For, as you know, his garden was  sacred, and not even his friends were allowed entrance. \"See, we will  go beyond, to the seat under the big chestnut. But are you not on duty  here?\"    Lauriston snapped his fingers and shrugged his shoulders in contempt of  duty. \"That for duty!\" he exclaimed. \"My duty now is to get out this pig  of a problem.\"    Under the big chestnut, which was another of Napoleon's favorite  resorts, the two boys put their heads together over Lauriston's problem,  and it was soon made clear to the lad; for Napoleon was always good at  mathematics.    But the time spent over the problem exhausted Lauriston's limit of  duty; and when the teacher came to relieve him at his post, the boy was  nowhere to be seen.    Now, at Brienne, military instruction was on military rules; and no  crime against military discipline is much greater than \"absence without  leave.\"    So when, at last, young Lauriston was found in Napoleon's company, away  from his post of duty, and beneath the big chestnut-tree, the boy was in  a \"pretty mess.\" But Napoleon never deserted his friends.    \"Sir,\" he said to the teacher, \"the fault is mine. I led young Lauriston  away to\"--he stopped: it would scarcely help his friend's cause to say  that he had been helping him at his lessons; thus he continued, \"to show  him my lists\"--which was not an untruth, for he had shown the copy to  Lauriston.    \"Your lists, unruly one,\" said the teacher--one of Napoleon's chief  persecutors. \"And what lists, pray?\"    \"My lists of the possessions of England, here in my copy-book,\" said  Napoleon, drawing the badly scrawled blank-book from his pocket.    He handed it to the teacher.    \"Ah, what handwriting! It is vilely done, young Bonaparte. Even I can  scarcely read it,\" he said. \"What is this? You would draw my portrait in  your copy-book? Wretched one! have you no manners? So! Possessions of  the English, is it? Would that the English possessed you! None then  would be happier than I.\" Thereupon the teacher read through the list,  making sarcastic comments on each entry, until he came to the end.  \"'Cabo Corso in Guinea, a pretty strong fort on the sea side of Fort  Royal, a defence of sixteen cannons.' Bad spelling, worse writing, this!  and the last, 'Saint Helena, a little island;' and where might it be,  that Saint Helena, young Bonaparte?\"    \"In the South Atlantic, well off the African coast,\" replied Napoleon.    \"Would you were there too, young malcontent!\" said the teacher, \"luring  boys from their duty. This is worse than treason. See! you shall to the  lockup once more. And you are no longer battalion captain.\"    Young Lauriston would have protested against this injustice, and  declared that he was at fault; but, like too many boys under similar  circumstances, he was afraid, and accepted anything that should save him  from punishment. Moreover, a glance at Napoleon's masterful eyes held  his tongue mute, and he saw his friend borne away to the punishment that  should have been his.    \"'Tis Saint Helena's fault, and not yours, my Lauriston,\" Napoleon  whispered in his ear. \"Bad writing is never forgiven.\"    So, as if in a prophecy of the future, Napoleon suffered unjust disgrace  in connection with Saint Helena's name; and to-day, in the splendid  exhibition-room of the historical library at Florence, jealously guarded  beneath a glass case, is Napoleon's blue paper copybook, the very last  line of which reads, by the strangest of all strange coincidences,  \"Saint Helena, a little island.\"    The boy's willingness to suffer for his friends, and, even more than  this, the unjust taking away of his office in the school battalion, of  which he was quite proud, turned the tide in young Napoleon's favor, so  far as his schoolmates were concerned.    \"Little Straw-nose is a plucky one, is he not, though?\" the boys  declared; and when he came on the field again, they welcomed him with  cheers, and made him leader for the day in their sports.    They had great fun. Napoleon, full of his readings in Plutarch's  \"Lives,\" divided the boys into two camps; one camp was to be the  Persians, the other the Greeks and Macedonians. Napoleon, of course, was  Alexander; and, like the great Macedonian, he wrought such havoc on the  Persians, that the school hall in which the battle was waged was filled  with the uproar, and all the teachers at Brienne rushed pell-mell to the  place, to quell what they were certain must be a school riot, led on by  \"that miserable Corsican.\"    Day by day, however, \"that miserable Corsican\" made more and more  friends among his schoolfellows. For boys grow tired at last of plaguing  one who has both spirit and pluck; and these Napoleon certainly  possessed. He had come to the school \"a little savage,\" so the polished  French boys declared.    \"I was in Brienne,\" he said years afterwards, as he thought over his  school-days, \"the poorest of all my schoolfellows. They always had money  in their pockets; I, never. I was proud, and was most careful that  nobody should perceive this. I could neither laugh nor amuse myself like  the others. I was not one of them. I could not be popular.\"    [Illustration: _Napoleon at the School  of Brienne (From the Painting by M R Dumas_)]    So he had to go through the same hard training that other poor boys at  boarding-school have undergone. He, however was petulant, high-spirited,  proud, and had something of that Corsican love of retaliation that has  made that rocky island famous for its feuds and family rows, or  \"vendettas\" as they are called.    He showed the boys at last that they could not impose upon him; that  he had plenty of spirit; that he was kind-hearted to those who showed  themselves friendly; and, above all, that he was fitted to lead them in  their sports, and could, in fact, help them toward having a jolly good  time.    So, gradually, they began to side with and follow him. They left him in  undisturbed possession of his fortified garden, they asked his help over  hard points in mathematics, until at last he began even to grow a little  popular. And then, to crown all, came the great Snow-ball Fight.          CHAPTER TWELVE.    THE GREAT SNOW-BALL FIGHT AT BRIENNE SCHOOL.    That Snow-ball Fight is now famous. It was in the winter of 1783.  Snow fell heavily; drifts piled up in the schoolyard at Brienne. The  schoolboys marvelled and exclaimed; for such a snow-fall was rare in  France. Then they began to"]]]
