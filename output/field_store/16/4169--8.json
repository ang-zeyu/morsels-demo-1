May be used either with roast or boiled meats.          *FRYING*      PREPARED BREAD CRUMBS FOR FRYING    All scraps of bread should be saved for crumbs, the crusts being  separated from the white part, then dried, rolled, and sifted, and put  away until needed in a covered glass jar.    The brown crumbs are good for the first coating, the white ones for the  outside, as they give better color. Cracker crumbs give a smooth  surface, but for most things bread crumbs are preferable.    For meats a little salt and pepper, and for sweet articles, a little  sugar, should be mixed with the crumbs. Crumbs left on the board should  be dried, sifted, and kept to be used again.      FRYING    Frying is cooking in very hot fat or oil, and the secret of success is  to have the fat hot enough to harden the outer surface of the article to  be fried immediately and deep enough to cover these articles of food. As  the fat or oil can be saved and used many times, the use of a large  quantity is not extravagant.    To fry easily one must have, in addition to the deep, straight-sided  frying-pan, a frying-basket, made from galvanized wire, with a side  handle. The bale handles are apt to become heated, and in looking for  something to lift them, the foods are over-fried. The frying-pan must be  at least six inches deep with a flat bottom; iron, granite ware or  copper may be used, the first two are preferable. There must be  sufficient fat to wholly cover the articles fried, but the pan must not  be too full, or there is danger of overflow when heavy articles are put  in. After each frying, drain the fat or oil, put it into a receptacle  kept for the purpose, and use it over and over again as long as it  lasts. As the quantity begins to lessen, add sufficient fresh fat or oil  to keep up the amount.    Always put the fat or oil in the frying-pan before you stand it "]]]
