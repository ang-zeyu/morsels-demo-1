It will be readily supposed that I was somewhat inquisitive as to the  person and demeanour of our visitant. After a moment's pause, I stepped  to the door and looked after him. Judge my surprize, when I beheld the  self-same figure that had appeared an half hour before upon the bank. My  fancy had conjured up a very different image. A form, and attitude, and  garb, were instantly created worthy to accompany such elocution; but  this person was, in all visible respects, the reverse of this phantom.  Strange as it may seem, I could not speedily reconcile myself to this  disappointment. Instead of returning to my employment, I threw myself  in a chair that was placed opposite the door, and sunk into a fit of  musing.    My attention was, in a few minutes, recalled by the stranger, who  returned with the empty cup in his hand. I had not thought of the  circumstance, or should certainly have chosen a different seat. He no  sooner shewed himself, than a confused sense of impropriety, added to  the suddenness of the interview, for which, not having foreseen it,  I had made no preparation, threw me into a state of the most painful  embarrassment. He brought with him a placid brow; but no sooner had he  cast his eyes upon me, than his face was as glowingly suffused as  my own. He placed the cup upon the bench, stammered out thanks, and  retired.    It was some time before I could recover my wonted composure. I had  snatched a view of the stranger's countenance. The impression that it  made was vivid and indelible. His cheeks were pallid and lank, his eyes  sunken, his forehead overshadowed by coarse straggling hairs, his teeth  large and irregular, though sound and brilliantly white, and his chin  discoloured by a tetter. His skin was of coarse grain, and sallow hue.  Every feature was wide of beauty, and the outline of his face reminded  you of an inverted cone.    And yet his forehead, so far as shaggy locks would allow it to be seen,  his eyes lustrously black, and possessing, in the midst of haggardness,  a radiance inexpressibly serene and potent, and something in the rest of  his features, which it would be in vain to describe, but which served to  betoken a mind of the highest order, were essential ingredients in the  portrait. This, in the effects which immediately flowed from it, I count  among the most extraordinary incidents of my life. This face, seen for  a moment, continued for hours to occupy my fancy, to the exclusion of  almost every other image. I had purposed to spend the evening with my  brother, but I could not resist the inclination of forming a sketch  upon paper of this memorable visage. Whether my hand was aided by any  peculiar inspiration, or I was deceived by my own fond conceptions, this  portrait, though hastily executed, appeared unexceptionable to my own  taste.    I placed it at all distances, and in all lights; my eyes were rivetted  upon it. Half the night passed away in wakefulness and in contemplation  of this picture. So flexible, and yet so stubborn, is the human mind.  So obedient to impulses the most transient and brief, and yet so  unalterably observant of the direction which is given to it! How little  did I then foresee the termination of that chain, of which this may be  regarded as the first link?    Next day arose in darkness and storm. Torrents of rain fell during  the whole day, attended with incessant thunder, which reverberated in  stunning echoes from the opposite declivity. The inclemency of the air  would not allow me to walk-out. I had, indeed, no inclination to leave  my apartment. I betook myself to the contemplation of this portrait,  whose attractions time had rather enhanced than diminished. I laid aside  my usual occupations, and seating myself at a window, consumed the day  in alternately looking out upon the storm, and gazing at the picture  which lay upon a table before me. You will, perhaps, deem this conduct  somewhat singular, and ascribe it to certain peculiarities of temper. I  am not aware of any such peculiarities. I can account for my devotion to  this image no otherwise, than by supposing that its properties were  rare and prodigious. Perhaps you will suspect that such were the  first inroads of a passion incident to every female heart, and  which frequently gains a footing by means even more slight, and more  improbable than these. I shall not controvert the reasonableness of the  suspicion, but leave you at liberty to draw, from my narrative, what  conclusions you please.    Night at length returned, and the storm ceased. The air was once more  clear and calm, and bore an affecting contrast to that uproar of the  elements by which it had been preceded. I spent the darksome hours, as  I spent the day, contemplative and seated at the window. Why was my mind  absorbed in thoughts ominous and dreary? Why did my bosom heave with  sighs, and my eyes overflow with tears? Was the tempest that had just  past a signal of the ruin which impended over me? My soul fondly dwelt  upon the images of my brother and his children, yet they only increased  the mournfulness of my contemplations. The smiles of the charming babes  were as bland as formerly. The same dignity sat on the brow of their  father, and yet I thought of them with anguish. Something whispered  that the happiness we at present enjoyed was set on mutable foundations.  Death must happen to all. Whether our felicity was to be subverted by it  to-morrow, or whether it was ordained that we should lay down our heads  full of years and of honor, was a question that no human being could  solve. At other times, these ideas seldom intruded. I either forbore to  reflect upon the destiny that is reserved for all men, or the reflection  was mixed up with images that disrobed it of terror; but now the  uncertainty of life occurred to me without any of its usual and  alleviating accompaniments. I said to myself, we must die. Sooner or  later, we must disappear for ever from the face of the earth. Whatever  be the links that hold us to life, they must be broken. This scene  of existence is, in all its parts, calamitous. The greater number is  oppressed with immediate evils, and those, the tide of whose fortunes is  full, how small is their portion of enjoyment, since they know that it  will terminate.    For some time I indulged myself, without reluctance, in these gloomy  thoughts; but at length, the dejection which they produced became  insupportably painful. I endeavoured to dissipate it with music. I had  all my grand-father's melody as well as poetry by rote. I now lighted  by chance on a ballad, which commemorated the fate of a German Cavalier,  who fell at the siege of Nice under Godfrey of Bouillon. My choice was  unfortunate, for the scenes of violence and carnage which were here  wildly but forcibly pourtrayed, only suggested to my thoughts a new  topic in the horrors of war.    I sought refuge, but ineffectually, in sleep. My mind was thronged by  vivid, but confused images, and no effort that I made was sufficient to  drive them away. In this situation I heard the clock, which hung in  the room, give the signal for twelve. It was the same instrument which  formerly hung in my father's chamber, and which, on account of its  being his workmanship, was regarded, by every one of our family, with  veneration. It had fallen to me, in the division of his property, and  was placed in this asylum. The sound awakened a series of reflections,  respecting his death. I was not allowed to pursue them; for scarcely  had the vibrations ceased, when my attention was attracted by a whisper,  which, at first, appeared to proceed from lips that were laid close to  my ear.    No wonder that a circumstance like this startled me. In the first  impulse of my terror, I uttered a slight scream, and shrunk to the  opposite side of the bed. In a moment, however, I recovered from my  trepidation. I was habitually indifferent to all the causes of fear,  by which the majority are afflicted. I entertained no apprehension  of either ghosts or robbers. Our security had never been molested by  either, and I made use of no means to prevent or counterwork their  machinations. My tranquillity, on this occasion, was quickly retrieved.  The whisper evidently proceeded from one who was posted at my bed-side.  The first idea that suggested itself was, that it was uttered by the  girl who lived with me as a servant. Perhaps, somewhat had alarmed her,  or she was sick, and had come to request my assistance. By whispering in  my ear, she intended to rouse without alarming me.    Full of this persuasion, I called; \"Judith,\" said I, \"is it you? What  do you want? Is there any thing the matter with you?\" No answer was  returned. I repeated my inquiry, but equally in vain. Cloudy as was the  atmosphere, and curtained as my bed was, nothing was visible. I withdrew  the curtain, and leaning my head on my elbow, I listened with the  deepest attention to catch some new sound. Meanwhile, I ran over in my  thoughts, every circumstance that could assist my conjectures.    My habitation was a wooden edifice, consisting of two stories. In each  story were two rooms, separated by an entry, or middle passage, with  which they communicated by opposite doors. The passage, on the lower  story, had doors at the two ends, and a stair-case. Windows answered to  the doors on the upper story. Annexed to this, on the eastern side, were  wings, divided, in like manner, into an upper and lower room; one of  them comprized a kitchen, and chamber above it for the servant, and  communicated, on both stories, with the parlour adjoining it below,  and the chamber adjoining it above. The opposite wing is of smaller  dimensions, the rooms not being above eight feet square. The lower of  these was used as a depository of household implements, the upper was a  closet in which I deposited my books and papers. They had but one inlet,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7937"],[0,"Journal of an African Cruiser (#11)"],[1,"of about two miles is cultivated by comfortable and happy-looking  colonists. A very pleasant dinner was furnished by the Governor at what  was once a great slave station, and the proprietor of which is still  hostile to the colonists, and to both English and Americans, for breaking  up the trade. We saw several alligators. One of them, about three feet in  length, lay on a log, with his mouth wide open, catching flies.    From the whole course of my observation, I cannot but feel satisfied that  the colonists are better off here than in America. They are more  independent, as healthy, and much happier. Agriculture will doubtless be  their chief employment, but, for years to come, the cultivation of sugar  cane cannot be carried to any considerable extent. There are many calls  upon the resources of the Colonization Society and the inhabitants, more  pressing, and which promise a readier and greater return. A large capital  should be invested in the business, in order to render it profitable. The  want of a steam-mill, to grind the cane, has been severely felt. Ignorance  of the most appropriate soil, and of the most productive kind of cane, and  the best methods of planting and grinding it, have likewise contributed to  retard the cultivation of sugar. But the grand difficulty is the want of a  ready capital, and the high price of labor. The present wages of labor are  from sixty to seventy-five cents per day. The natives refuse to work among  the canes, on account of the prickly nature of the leaves, and the  irritating property of a gum that exudes from them. Yet it may be doubted  whether the colony will ever make sugar to any important extent, unless  some method be found to apply native labor to that purpose. Private  enterprise is no more successful than the public efforts. A plantation has  been commenced at Millsburg, and prosecuted with great diligence, but with  no auspicious results. Sugar has been made, indeed, but at a cost of three  times as much, per pound, as would have purchased it.    Hitherto, the plantations of Coffee trees have not succeeded well. Coffee,  it is true, is sometimes exported from Liberia; and doubtless the friends  of Colonization drink it with great gusto, as an earnest of the progress  of their philanthropic work. The cup, however, will be less grateful to  their taste, when they learn that nearly all this coffee is procured at  the islands of St. Thomas and St. Prince's, in the Bight of Benin, and  entered as the produce of Liberia, _ad captandum_. The same game has been  played in England, by entering their coffee as from Sierra Leone or  Gambia, to entitle it to the benefit of the lower duties on colonial  produce. But the English custom-house officers are now aware of the  deception, and the business is abandoned.    The mode of forming a coffee-plantation is simply to go into the woods  (where the tree abounds), select the wild coffee tree, and transport it  into the prepared field. The indigenous coffee-tree of Liberia produces  fruit of a superior quality, larger and finer flavored, than that of the  West Indies. But the cultivation, I think, is conducted upon wrong  principles. Instead of having large plantations, with no other vegetables  on the land, let every man intermingle a few coffee trees with the corn,  cassada, and other vegetables in his garden or fields. These few trees,  having the benefit of the hoeing and manuring bestowed on the other crops,  will produce much more abundantly and with less trouble, than by separate  culture. In fact, after setting out the trees, there will be no trouble,  except that of gathering and preparing the berries for market. In this  burning climate, the shade afforded by the tree will be beneficial to most  vegetables.    The want of success, hitherto, in the cultivation of coffee, has been  attributed by some to the custom of transplanting the trees from the  forest, instead of raising them from seed. The colonial Secretary is now  making trial of the latter method. He has several thousand young trees in  his nursery, and will soon be able to test the comparative efficiency of  the different systems. Not improbably, the cultivation of seedlings may be  found preferable to that of transplanted trees; but, in my opinion, the  great obstacle to success has been the deficiency of care and proper  manuring. In order to bear well, trees require to have the ground  enriched, and kept free from weeds. Failing this, the plant often dies,  and never flourishes so well as in its native woods. The inhabitants of  Liberia have not the means of bestowing the requisite care upon the  cultivation of coffee, on an extended scale; and I say boldly, that large  plantations, in that region, cannot compete with those of Brazil and the  West Indies, where the plantations are well-stocked, and cultivated by  slave-labor. Free labor in Africa will not soon be so cheap as that of  slaves in other countries. Even in Cuba, the planters can barely feed  themselves and their slaves, by the culture of coffee. How, then, can it  be made profitable in Liberia, where labor commands so high a price, and  is often impossible to be procured?    As incidental, however, to other branches of agriculture, coffee may be  advantageously raised. The best trees are those seen in gardens, where,  from ten or twelve, more berries are gathered than from hundreds in a  plantation. A single tree, in the garden of Colonel Hicks, is said to have  produced sixteen pounds at a gathering; and I have seen several very fine  trees in similar situations. Fifty or a hundred trees, well selected, and  properly distributed through the fields, would yield several hundred  pounds of coffee, which, being gathered and dried by the women and  children, would be gratuitous as regards the cost of labor. Thus, the  coffee culture, in Liberia, must be considered far more eligible than that  of sugar; inasmuch as the latter requires a large capital and extensive  operations, while the former succeeds best on a very moderate scale.    Judge Benedict has probably bestowed more attention on this business, than  any other person in Liberia. He is a man of excellent sense and  information, and has the means to carry out his views, as well as the  patriotism to exert himself for the advantage of the commonwealth. With  these qualifications, he has employed five or six years in the experiment  of raising coffee, and thus far, with little success, although his  plantation comprises some thousands of growing trees. In the spring of  1841, he made presents, to myself and other officers, of genuine Liberian  coffee, in small native bags, containing two or three pounds each. The  Judge is still giving away little bags of the same kind; but I do not yet  learn that his crop is more than sufficient for his own use, and for  distribution as specimens; certainly, it is not so abundant as to render  the sale of it an object. As for the plantation itself, I must confess  that it appeared to me more flourishing three years ago, than at present.  Most of the trees, on the spot originally planted, are dead, and the rest  in a sickly condition; while the most thriving trees are to be seen on the  lower and damper land adjacent, which, at my former visit, was covered  with a dense forest. Beyond a doubt, the coffee tree is as well adapted to  this soil and climate as to those of Cuba, and produces a larger and  better flavored berry; but I repeat my opinion, that the Liberian, hiring  laborers at sixty cents a day, cannot compete with the West Indian, who  has his hundreds of slaves already paid for, and his trees growing in  well-weeded land. The mere feeding, I might almost say, of a dozen  laborers in Liberia, will cost more than all the coffee they raise would  re-imburse, at the Cuba prices.    The cultivation of rice is universal in Africa. The natives never neglect  it, for fear of famine. For an upland crop, the rice-lands are turned over  and planted in March and April. In September and October, the rice is  reaped, beaten out, and cleaned for market or storing. The lowland crop,  on the contrary, is planted in September, October, and November, in marshy  lands, and harvested in March and April. Lands will not produce two  successive crops without manuring and ploughing. About two bushels of seed  are sown to the acre; and the crop, on the acre of upland, is about thirty  bushels, and from forty to forty-five bushels on the lowlands. The rice is  transported to market on the backs of natives, packed in bundles of about  three feet long and nine inches in diameter. The wrappers are made of  large leaves, bound together by cords of bark. The load is sustained by  shoulder-straps, and by a band, passing round the forehead of the bearer.    Cassada is a kind of yam, and sends up a tall stalk, with light green  leaves. It has a long root, looking like a piece of wood with the brown  bark on; the interior is white and mealy, rather insipid, but nutritious,  and invaluable as an article of food. It is raised from the seed, root, or  stem; the latter being considered preferable. Its yield is very great. In  six months, it is fit to dig, and may be preserved fifteen or eighteen  months in the ground, but ceases to be eatable in three or four days after  being dug. Tapioca is manufactured from this root.    Indian corn is planted in May and harvested in September; or, if planted  in July, it ripens in November and December. Sweet potatoes constitute one  of the main reliances of the colonists; they are raised from seeds, roots  or vines, but most successfully from the latter. The season of planting is  in May, or June, and the crop ripens four months later. Plantains and  bananas are a valuable product; they are propagated from suckers, which  yield a first crop in about a year. The top is cut down, and new stalks  spring from the root.
