Light, sandy,  well drained peat would seem to meet with its requirements.      EUONYMUS.    EUONYMUS AMERICANA.--American Spindle Tree. North America, 1686. This  is a deciduous or semi-evergreen shrub, of about 6 feet in height,  found over a wide area in Canada and the United States. It is of  partially erect growth, with long and lithe branches, covered with  pleasing light green bark. Flowers appearing in June, and succeeded by  rough, warted, brilliant scarlet capsules, which are particularly showy  and attractive. It likes a shady situation, and rich, rather damp soil.    E. EUROPAEUS.--West Asia, Europe (Britain), &c. An indigenous species,  rarely exceeding 6 feet in height, and rendered very effective in  autumn by reason of the pale scarlet fruit, which, when fully ripe, and  having split open, reveals the orange-coloured arils of the seeds. It,  too, delights to grow in the shade.    E. FIMBRIATUS, Japan and India, and its handsome variegated form, E.  fimbriatus foliis variegatus et argenteo maculatus, are rather too  tender for cultivation in this country, even in southern districts, and  where afforded wall protection. E. verrucosus and E. atropurpureus are  also worthy of cultivation.    E. LATIFOLIUS.--Broad-leaved Spindle Tree. A European species (1730),  deciduous, and growing from 10 feet to sometimes fully 20 feet in  height. The leaves are bright, shining green, and much larger than  those of our native species. Flowers, purplish-white, appearing in  June; the capsules large, deep red, and when open contrasting very  effectively with the bright orange arils in which the seeds are  enveloped. It is a very distinct and beautiful, small-growing lawn  tree, and succeeding, as it does, best in shade is an extra  qualification.      FABIANA.    FABIANA IMBRICATA.--Chili, 1838. This is, unfortunately, not hardy in  any but the milder maritime parts of England and Ireland. It is a  charming shrub of Heather-like appearance, with small, crowded leaves,  and pure white flowers produced in May. Planted at the base of a  southern wall it does best, and where it thrives it is certainly one of  our handsomest half-hardy shrubs.      FATSIA.    FATSIA JAPONICA (_syns Aralia japonica_ and _A. Sieboldii_).--Japan,  1858. This is of no particular value as a flowering shrub, but being  hardy in most districts, and having large handsome leaves that impart  to it a tropical appearance, it is well worthy of culture. The flowers  are ivory-white, and produced in large umbels towards the end of  autumn, but our early frosts too often mar their beauty. In this  country it grows about 10 feet high, and is usually what is termed  \"leggy\" in appearance, and thrives well in any good loamy soil if  fairly dry.      FENDLERA.    FENDLERA RUPICOLA.--Mexico, 1888. A low-growing shrub, peculiar to the  dry rocky parts of the United States, particularly the south-western  district. It grows about a yard high, and bears a great profusion of  bluish-white flowers, that are rendered very conspicuous by reason of  the bright yellow stamens. It is the only known species, and is nearly  allied to the Saxifrages. Any fairly good garden soil will suit it  well, but it wants to be planted where superfluous moisture is quickly  carried off.      FORSYTHIA.    FORSYTHIA SUSPENSA (_syn F. Fortunei_ and _F. Sieboldii_).--Japan and  China, 1864. A slender-growing shrub, with variable leaves, and long,  trailing shoots. The flowers are abundantly produced, are of a  beautiful golden tint, and bell-shaped, and being of good substance  last for a long time. Either as a wall plant, or for using in some  sheltered corner, and where the branches can spread about at will, it  forms a very distinct and handsome shrub, and one that is perfectly  hardy and quite indifferent as regards the quality of soil in which it  is planted. There are several forms of this pretty shrub, but as they  do not differ to any great extent from the species, are hardly worthy  of consideration.    F. suspensa intermedia is a garden hybrid, 1891.    F. VIRIDISSIMA.--Japan, 1845. This is another desirable species, but it  is not comparable in point of beauty with the former. It is usually of  strong erect growth, with stout shoots, wreathed with bright yellow  flowers towards the end of winter. It is a very beautiful shrub, and a  valuable addition to the winter or early spring flowering section.      FOTHERGILLA.    FOTHERGILLA ALNIFOLIA.--North Eastern America, 1765. This is an  ungainly habited shrub, of dwarf growth, the branches being somewhat  slender and crooked. The flowers are white, sweetly scented, and  produced in dense terminal spikes. It is perfectly hardy.      FRAXINUS.    FRAXINUS ORNUS (_syn F. argentea, F. rotundifolia_, and _Ornus  europea_).--Manna Ash. South Europe, 1730. This is a handsome tree,  especially when young and vigorous, and by far the most ornamental  species in cultivation. For planting in situations where large-growing  subjects would be out of place this is a valuable tree, while the  wealth of flowers renders it particularly interesting and effective. It  rarely exceeds 30 feet in height, with leaves not unlike those of the  common Ash, and conspicuous panicles of light, feathery, white  petaliferous flowers, produced usually in great abundance all over the  tree. Perfectly hardy.    F. Ornus serotina alba and F. Ornus serotina violacea are beautiful  seedling forms that were raised in France, and on account of their  dwarf habit and profusion of flowers are well worthy of attention. The  flowers of the first-named variety are pure white, the stamens having  at first yellow anthers, which speedily turn to a rich blackish-brown.  The other differs but little, only in the flowers, which are of a  distinct greyish-violet hue, while the leaves are of a darker shade of  green, and the leaflets longer and narrower.    F. MARIESII.--Northern China, 1880. This is hardy in most parts of the  country. The whole tree is quite glabrous except the petioles, which  are clothed with a dense pubescence. Flowers pure white, and arranged  in large dense panicles.      FREMONTIA.    FREMONTIA CALIFORNICA.--California, 1851. A handsome and deciduous  Californian shrub, but scarcely hardy enough for the open air without  protection. In Southern England and Ireland, however, it does well, and  all the better if planted within the influence of the sea. The large  yellow flowers are often about 2 inches across, and produced singly  along the branches, while the leaves are large, lobed, and of an  enticing shade of green. Planted against a wall, in good dampish loam,  it succeeds well.      FUCHSIA.    FUCHSIA MACROSTEMA GLOBOSA (_syn F. globosa_).--Chili. This is readily  recognised by the globose form assumed by the incurved sepals, while  the flowers are smaller and less showy than those of F. Riccartoni.  Hardihood about similar to the following.    F. RICCARTONI.--This seedling from F. m. globosa is one of the two  hardiest varieties, but even this plant, except in warm, maritime  districts, is by no means satisfactory. Where it does well it is a  shrub of great beauty, and blooms profusely. This species has red,  straight sepals, and a purple corolla. In favoured districts it may  frequently be seen as much as 12 feet high, and is then during the  flowering period an object of great beauty. It originated at Riccarton,  near Edinburgh, about 1830.      GARRYA.    GARRYA ELLIPTICA.--California, 1818. This is a handsome shrub, with dark  green coreaceous leaves, resembling very nearly those of the Evergreen  Oak. The long, tassellated catkins, of a peculiar yellowish-green  colour, render the plant one of much interest and beauty. As a wall  plant it thrives well, the slight protection thus afforded favouring the  growth and expansion of the catkins. For planting in the shrubbery it is  also well suited, and where it oft-times attains to a height of 6 feet,  and is bushy in proportion. It is well to bear in mind that there are  male and female plants of the Garrya, and that the former is the more  ornamental. Good rich, well-drained loam will suit this shrub well.      GAULTHERIA.    GAULTHERIA NUMMULARIOIDES (_syn G. nummulariae_ and _G. repens_).  --Himalayas. This is a neat Alpine species, with small and very dark  green leaves. It likes a shady situation and vegetable soil. For  planting on the rockwork, amongst tree roots, or beneath the shade of  trees, the Gaultherias are particularly suitable. Light, but rich  vegetable soil suits them best.    G. PROCUMBENS.--Canada Tea, or Creeping Winter-green. North America,  1762. This is of much smaller growth than the following, rarely rising  to a greater height than about half a foot, with lanceolate, serrated  leaves, and pendulous axillary clusters of white flowers.    G. SHALLON.--North-west America, 1826. Growing in favourable situations  to fully a yard in height, this distinct evergreen shrub, which is  fairly common in cultivation, is particularly valuable, as it thrives  well under the shade and drip of trees. It is a rambling plant, with  ovate-cordate, almost sessile leaves, and bears tiny white flowers that  are succeeded by purplish fruit. G. Shallon acutifolia has more sharply  pointed leaves than those of the species.      GENISTA.    GENISTA AETNENSIS (_syn Spartium aetnensis_).--Etna Broom. Sicily and  Sardinia, 1816. This is a large-growing species of elegant growth, and  remarkable for the abundance of yellow flowers with which it is  literally covered in August. Than this South-European Pea-flower,  perhaps not another member of the family is more worthy of culture, the  neat, elegant habit of growth and profusion of flowers rendering it a  plant of particular interest and beauty. It is quite hardy, thrives in  any light soil if well drained, and is readily propagated from seed,  which it ripens in abundance.    G. ANXANTICA.--Naples, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10885"],[0,"Stories from the Italian Poets: with Lives of the Writers, Volume 1 (#12)"],[1,"accomplishment of a social duty than the result of an irresistible  impulse of the heart,\" p. 15. The accomplishment of the \"social duty\" is  an assumption, not very probable with regard to any body, and much less  so in a fiery Italian of twenty-six; but the addition of the epithets,  \"calm and cold,\" gives it a sort of horror. A reader of this article,  evidently the production of a man of ability but of great wilfulness, is  tempted to express the disappointment it has given him in plainer terms  than might be wished, in consequence of the extraordinary license which  its writer does not scruple to allow to his own fancies, in expressing  his opinion of what he is pleased to think the fancies of others.]    [Footnote 12: \"Le invettive contr' essa per tanti secoli originarono  dalla enumerazione rettorica del Boccaccio di tutti gli inconvenienti  del matrimonio, e dove per altro ei dichiara,--'Certo io non affermo  queste cose a Dante essere avvenute, che non lo so; comeche vero sia,  che o a simili cose a queste, o ad altro che ne fusse cagione, egli una  volta da lei partitosi, che per consolazione de' suoi affanni gli era  stata data, mai ne dove ella fusse volle venire, ne sofferse che dove  egli fusse ella venisse giammai, con tutto che di piu figliuoli egli  insieme con lei fusse parente.\" _Discorso sul Testo_, ut sup.

And then the \"buon Boccaccio,\" with his  accustomed sweetness of nature, begs pardon of so great a man, for being  obliged to relate such things of him, and doubts whether his spirit may  not be looking down on him that moment _disdainfully_ from _heaven_!

In the middle is the abyss, pervading  the whole depth, and 245 miles in diameter at the opening; which reduces  the different platforms, or territories that surround it, to a size  comparatively small. These territories are more or less varied with land  and water, lakes, precipices, &c. A precipice, fourteen miles high,  divides the first of them from the second. The passages from the upper  world to the entrance are various; and the descents from one circle  to another are effected by the poet and his guide in different  manners-sometimes on foot through by-ways, sometimes by the conveyance  of supernatural"]]]
