It is not a full autobiography; save for  a short Prologue and a short Epilogue, it deals exclusively with the  author's conduct in Galilee prior to the campaign of Vespasian, and it  differs materially in political color as well as in the narrative of  facts from the account of the same period in the _Wars_. In the earlier  work his object had been to excuse his countrymen for their revolt, and  at the same time to show the ability with which he had served their true  interests, as the representative of the party that sought to preserve  the nation at the sacrifice of its independence. But in the later work  he is writing not a partisan but a personal apology, composed when his  life was in danger, and when he no longer was anxious to save  appearances with his countrymen. And he devoted his ingenuity to showing  that throughout the events in Galilee he was the friend of Rome, seeking  under the guise of resistance to smooth the way for the invaders and  deliver the gates of Palestine into their hands. That he had so to  demean himself is the most pathetic commentary on the bitter position  which he was called on to endure after twenty years of servile life. The  work was published or reissued after the death of King Agrippa, which  took place in 103 C.E., and is recorded in it.[1] Agrippa was the last  of the Herodians to rule, and with his death the last part of Palestine  that had the outward show of independence was absorbed into the Roman  Empire. But though the whole of the Jewish temporal sovereignty was  shattered before his last days, Josephus may have consoled himself with  the progressive march of Judaism in the capital city of the conqueror.    [Footnote 1: See note above, p. 73.]    It may be put down to the credit of Josephus that amid the court society  at Rome he to the end professed loyalty to his religion, and that he did  not complete his political desertion by religious apostasy. His loyalty  indeed is less meritorious than might seem at first sight. The Romans  generally were tolerant of creeds and cults, and the ceremonial of  Judaism, especially its Sabbath, appealed to many of them. Within the  _pomoerium_ (limits), of the ancient city none but the city gods might  be worshiped, but in Greater Rome there were numerous synagogues. In the  time of Pompey, an important Jewish community existed in the  cosmopolitan capital of the Empire, and later we have records of a  number of congregations. Philo expressly mentions the religious  privileges his brethren enjoyed at the heart of the Empire,[1] and save  for an occasional expulsion the Jews appear to have been unmolested. The  Flavian Emperors, satisfied with the destruction of the sanctuary and  the razing of Jerusalem, did not attempt to persecute the communities of  the Diaspora. For the old offering by all Jews to the Temple, they  substituted a tax of two drachmas (the equivalent of the shekel  voluntarily given hitherto to Jerusalem), which went towards the  maintenance of the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus. Later the fiscus  Judaicus, to which every Jew and proselyte had to pay, became an  instrument of oppression, but in the reigns of Vespasian and Titus it  was not harshly administered. Domitian indeed vented his indignation on  the people which he had not had the honor of conquering, and instituted  a kind of inquisition, to ferret out the early Maranos, who dissembled  their Judaism and sought to evade the tax. But his gentle successor  Nerva (96-98) restored the habit of tolerance, and struck special coins,  with the legend calumnia Judaica sublata (on the abolition of  information against the Jews), in order to mark his clemency. Save,  therefore, for the short persecution under Domitian, Judaism remained a  _licita religio_ (legalized denomination) at Rome. More than that, it  became a powerful missionary faith among the lower classes, and in small  doses almost fashionable at the court. A near relative of the Emperor,  Flavius Clemens, outraged Roman opinion by adopting its tenets.[2] It  has been suggested, and it is likely, that the chief historical work of  Josephus was written primarily for a group of fashionable proselytes to  Judaism, to whom he ministered. He mentions members of the royal house  that commended his work.[3] Some scholars have sought to associate him  with the philosopher at Rome that was visited by the four rabbis of the  Sanhedrin, the Patriarch Rabban Gamaliel, Rabbi Joshua, Rabbi Eleazar  ben Arach, and Rabbi Akiba, when they came to Rome in the reign of  Domitian.[4] But apart from the fact that he would hardly be described  as a philosopher--a term usually reserved in the Talmud for a pagan  scholar--it is as unlikely that the leaders of the Pharisaic national  party would have had interviews with the renegade, as that the renegade  would have befriended them. At Jotapata he deserted his people, and he  passed thenceforth out of their life. It is significant that, while the  history of the war was originally written in Aramaic for the benefit of  the Eastern Jews, none of his later works was either written in his  native language or translated into it, nor were they designed to be read  by Jews.    [Footnote 1: De Leg, 82.]    [Footnote 2: It is interesting that the wife of the first Roman governor  of Britain was accused, in 57 C.E., of \"foreign superstition,\" and is  said to have lived a melancholy life (Tac. Ann. xiii. 32), which may  mean that she had adopted Jewish practices.]    [Footnote 3: C. Ap. i. 5.]    [Footnote 4: Sukkah, 22, quoted in Vogelstein and Rieger, Geschichte der  Juden in Rom, pp. 28 and 29.]    In the palace of the Caesars Josephus became a reputable Greco-Roman  chronicler, deliberately accommodating himself to the tastes of the  conquerors of his people, and deliberately seeking, as Renan said, \"to  Hellenize his compatriots,\" i.e. to describe them from a Hellenized  point of view. He achieved his ambition, if such it was, to be the  classical authority upon the early history of the Jews. His record of  his people survived through the ages, and his works were included in the  public libraries of Rome, while among the Christians they had for  centuries a place next the Bible.    As a writer, Josephus has, by the side of some glaring defects,  considerable merits: immense industry, power of vivid narrative, an  ability for using authorities, and at times a certain eloquence. But as  a man he has few qualities to attract and nothing of the heroic. He was  mediocre in character and mind, and for such there is no admiration. It  may be admitted that he lived in hard times, when it required great  strength of character for a Jew born, as he was, in the aristocratic  Romanizing section of the nation, to stand true to the Jewish people and  devote his energies to their desperate cause. He may have honestly  believed that submission to Rome was the truest wisdom; but he placed  himself in a false position by associating himself with the  insurrection. And while his national feeling led him later to attempt to  defend his people against calumny and ignorance, the conditions under  which he labored made against the production of a true and spirited  history. Yet if he does not appear worthy of admiration, we must beware  of judging him harshly; and there is deep pathos in the fact that he was  compelled in writing to be his own worst detractor. The combination,  which the autobiographical account reveals, of egoism and self-seeking,  of cowardice and vanity, of pious profession and cringing  obsequiousness, of vaunted magnanimity and spiteful malice to his foes,  of religious scruples and selfish cunning, points to a meanness of  conduct which he was forced to assume by circumstances, but which, it is  suggested, was not an expression of his true character. The document of  shame was wrung from him by his past. He might have been a reliable  historian had he not been called on to play a part in action. But the  part he played was ignoble in itself, and it blasted the whole of his  future life and his literary credit. It made his work take the form of  apology, and part of it bear the stamp of deliberate falsehood. His  besetting weakness of egoism led him as a general to betray his  countrymen; as historian of their struggle with Rome, to misrepresent  their patriotism and give a false picture of their ideals. Yet, though  to the Jews of his own day he was a traitor in life and a traducer in  letters, to the Jews of later generations he appears rather as a tragic  figure, struggling to repair his fault of perfidy, and a victim to the  forces of a hostile civilization, which in every age assail his people  intellectually, and which in his day assailed them with crushing might  physically as well as intellectually.          IV    THE WORKS OF JOSEPHUS AND HIS RELATION TO HIS PREDECESSORS      The Jews, though they are the most historical of peoples, and though  they have always regarded history as the surest revelation of God's  work, have produced remarkably few historians. It is true that a large  part of their sacred literature consists of the national annals, from  the earliest time to the restoration of the nation after its first  destruction, i.e. a period of more than two thousand years. The Book of  Chronicles, as its name suggests, is a systematic summary of the whole  of that period and proves the existence of the historical spirit. But  their very engrossment with the story of their ancestors checked in  later generations the impulse to write about their own times. They saw  contemporary affairs always in the light of the past, and they were more  concerned with revealing the hand of God in events than in depicting the  events themselves. Thus, during the whole Persian period, which extended  over two hundred years, we have but one historical document, the Book of  Esther, to acquaint us "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9799"],[0,"It Happened in Egypt (#11)"],[1,"seriously ill in Constantinople. That  instead of remaining at his relative's bedside, he had used his leave  for a dash to the Balkans. That this indiscretion might have been kept  a secret had he not capped it with another: a flight with a Greek  officer in an army aeroplane which had ended by crashing down in the  midst of a Turkish encampment.    What I and friends who knew him best supposed, was that the \"leave\" had  been a pretext--that Fenton had been sent on a secret mission of some  sort--and that he was bound to take the blame if anything went wrong.  Aeroplanes have the habits of other fierce, untamed animals: they won't  always obey their trainers. Thus Anthony and his plan had both been  upset. (Or had it really been premeditated that he should fall into  that camp?) The remainder of his \"leave\" was cancelled, in punishment,  and he had been \"recalled\" to Egypt, to be scolded in Cairo before  proceeding to Khartum.    \"Queer how many silly asses one knows!\" Anthony said. \"Still,  considering what a mess I seem to have made of things, fellows were  jolly kind, at the Turf Club. Nobody cut me, and only a few let me  alone. Maybe there'd have been still fewer if there hadn't been a hero  present who claimed attention: an American chap, Jack Dennis, who knows  Miss Gilder and was telling the good news that she was on her way to  Egypt. He called her the Gilded Rose and said it was going to be a good  flower season in Cairo and up the Nile. All the men with one exception  seemed to have heard a lot about her and to find her an interesting  subject, and to want Dennis to introduce them.\"    \"I can guess the 'one exception'!\" said I.    \"Can you? Well, I don't read newspaper gossip about heiresses. Thank  heaven, I've something better to do with my time. But the others wanted  to meet her, or pretended to, perhaps to chaff Dennis, rather a cocky  youth, though I oughtn't to say so, as he was nice to me, according to  his lights. He got Sam Blake to introduce us, when he happened to hear  my name, and went out of his way to pay me compliments, which I daresay  he thought I'd like. When there was a lull in the discussion of what  could be done to make Miss Gilder enjoy herself in Egypt--chaps  suggesting trips in their motor cars or on their camels and a lot of  rot, Dennis remarked that I was the only man who hadn't chipped into  the conversation. And hadn't I any ideas for entertaining the Golden  Girl? Naturally I said that I didn't know who she was and had never  heard of her, and even if I had, entertaining girls wasn't in my line.  They all roared, and Dennis wouldn't believe at first that I didn't  know of such an important person's existence; but the other men rotted  a bit, and described me to him according to their notions of me. So he  let me alone on the subject; and having plenty of other things to think  of, I forgot all about it till the lady in question introduced herself  this morning. Then--well, it struck me as rather amusing at first that  I, the only one in the crowd who hadn't made plans to get at her,  should have her trying to get at me. That was partly why I came up on  the terrace when she beckoned.\"    \"Partly? For purely intellectual reasons I'm curious to know the rest.  I suppose it had nothing to do with her looks?\"    \"As it happened, my cynical friend, it hadn't. I've got eyes in my head  and I could see she was pretty, very pretty, though not my ideal type  at all. That little sprite of a woman in fawn colour, the one with  green eyes and a lot of black lashes, is more what I'd fall in love  with if I were frivolous. But apart from the funny side of my meeting  with Miss Golder, or Gilder, it popped into my head that I might make  her a victim in a certain cause. Don't ask me to explain yet, because  there are a lot of things that have got to be explained first, or you  couldn't understand. You were right, of course, when you thought I'd  stationed myself in front of Shepheard's to take a rise out of you. I  gave up my room there yesterday, for reasons I'll tell you. But I knew  you'd be in the hotel, and that you'd be bound to show yourself on the  terrace, in order to go out. I wanted to see if you'd recognize me, and  to have a little fun with you if you didn't. By the way, I'm not  pleased that you did. It's a poor compliment to my make-up, which I may  tell you has been warmly praised in high quarters!\" \"Well, you see,\" I  apologized, \"I knew you were a nailer at that sort of thing, or you  would never have got to Mecca, and earned your green turban. I knew  you'd been pretty often called upon to disguise yourself and go about  among the natives for one thing or another. And besides, we were chums  before you had the shadow of a moustache, so I have an advantage over  the other Sherlock Holmeses! But even as it was, I couldn't be sure at  first. You must have got some fun out of my expression.\"    \"I did. I took revenge on you for recognizing me by tormenting you as  far as I dared. Dear old boy, I knew you'd see me through to the end,  bitter or sweet!\"    \"Which was it?\" I inquired.    \"Mixed. The girl riled me, rather, so much so that I definitely decided  it would be fair play to make use of her as a cat's-paw. But it depends  on you, whether she's to lose or win her bet.\"    \"If she loses, I get her hat. If she wins, I've engaged myself to  procure for her--your green turban.\"    \"Did you think you could, without my consent?\"    \"No. I distinctly thought I couldn't. But I would have been willing to  bet the head in the turban, served up on a charger, so sure I was that  you'd refuse to come near her. I thought I knew you _au fond_, you  see.\"    \"You do. I haven't changed. But--circumstances have changed. And that  brings me near to the stage of this business which concerns you and me.  First, before I go further though, I'll tell you a part of the reason  why I'm sporting the green turban. There's been the dickens to pay  here, about a new street that had to be made; an immensely important  and necessary street. Well, they couldn't make it, because the tomb of  a popular saint or sheikh was in the way. To move the body or even  disturb a saint's tomb would mean no end of a row. You remember or have  read enough about Mohammedans to know that. What to do, was the  question. Nobody'd been able to answer it till yesterday, when the  sight of me reminded them of a trick or two I'd brought off some time  ago, by disguising myself and hanging about the cafes. They wanted me  to try it again. Consequently Captain A. Fenton received a telegram and  had to leave Cairo at once on business. He gave up his room at  Shepheard's, and the only regrettable thing to the official mind is,  that the fellow'd been seen about town even for an hour. However, it  couldn't be helped. Luckily Ahmed Antoun is not unknown in Cairo cafes.  He's made quite an impression upon the public on several occasions  since his pilgrimage to Mecca, two years ago. And since yesterday  afternoon, he's been drinking enough coffee to give him jaundice, while  casually spreading the story of a dream he had. Our friend the Hadji  related how he had slept in the mosque of Ibn Tulun after the noon  hour, and dreamed of the sheikh whose tomb is so inconveniently placed.  In the dream, the saint clamoured to have his tomb moved on account of  a bad smell of drainage which he considers an insult to his own memory.  Also dogs have taken to howling round his resting-place at night, and  you know that to the true believer a dog is an unclean animal. Except  for hunting purposes, or watch-dogging in various branches, good  Mohammedans class dogs and Christians together in their mind. Well,  already the Hadji's dream is working like yeast. The news of it is  being carried from one cafe to another; and I hope that a few more  nights' work will do the trick. The votaries of the saint will get up a  petition to have his body moved. When it has found another abode, the  making of the new thoroughfare will be suggested.\"    \"Very neat! I see it all, except the connection with Miss Gilder. What  has your saint got to do with her?\"    \"Very little, I should say, by the look in her eyes. But though a green  turban's as good as an heirloom, and extorts respect wherever it goes,  even a Hadji may have jealous detractors. I have mine. Another green  turban in this town, whose genuineness is doubted for some obscure  reason or other, has sneered at my dream.\"    \"I say! That sounds as if you might be in danger. If one man suspects  you to-day, to-morrow------\"    \"Oh, it's only the dream he suspects--at present. I know all the little  prayer tricks so well, and I've invented my own history so ingeniously,  with a _patois_ to match my province, that I shall get through this  incident as I have through others of the sort. There's only one hole in  my jebbah. Last night, when my rival sprang a sudden question as to  what I was doing in Cairo (I'm supposed to be a Luxor man), on the spur  of the moment I replied that I was acting as dragoman to a rich family  of tourists. On that, the brute inquired with honeyed accents where  they were staying. I said Shepheard's, because I expected you to be  there, and thought if I were followed, you might be useful as a dummy.\"    \"Ah, that's where Miss Gilder comes in? A gilded gingerbread lamb,  ready for the sacrifice. Why didn't you accept her offer at once, as  she seemed so providential?\" \"I'm coming to that. It sounds  complicated, but it isn't. For one thing, though, it may be well to  wait and find out a little more about that goat-eyed Armenian of  yours.\"    \"He isn't mine. He's--\".    \"I want to know for certain whose he is. If he has anything to do with  my rival Hadji, there's more venom and wit inside that green turban  than I've given it credit for. Is there a reason, by the way, except  their riches, why one should want to 'get at' a member of the American  party?\"    \"By"]]]
