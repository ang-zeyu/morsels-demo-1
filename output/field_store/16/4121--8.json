They were of  five colors, yellow, black, white, blue and red, which in the symbolism of  their tongue meant that they were distributed around the zenith and to  each of the four cardinal points.[1]    [Footnote 1: See H. de Charencey, _Des Couleurs Considerees comme Symboles  des Points de l'Horizon chez les Peuples du Nouveau Monde_, in the _Actes  de la Societe Philologiques_, Tome vi. No. 3.]    Nor did these sages suppose that the struggle of the dark Tezcatlipoca to  master the Light-God had ceased; no, they knew he was biding his time,  with set purpose and a fixed certainty of success. They knew that in the  second heaven there were certain frightful women, without flesh or bones,  whose names were the Terrible, or the Thin Dart-Throwers, who were waiting  there until this world should end, when they would descend and eat up all  mankind.[1] Asked concerning the time of this destruction, they replied  that as to the day or season they knew it not, but it would be \"when  Tezcatlipoca should steal the sun from heaven for himself\"; in other  words, when eternal night should close in upon the Universe.[2]    [Footnote 1: These frightful beings were called the _Tzitzimime_, a word  which Molina in his Vocabulary renders \"cosa espantosa o cosa de aguero.\"  For a thorough discussion of their place in Mexican mythology, see _Anales  del Museo Nacional_, Tom. ii, pp. 358-372.]    [Footnote 2: The whole of this version of the myth is from the work of  Ramirez de Fuen-leal, which I consider in some respects the most valuable  authority we possess. It was taken directly from the sacred books of the  Aztecs, as explained by the most competent survivors of the Conquest.]    The myth which I have here given in brief is a prominent one in Aztec  cosmogony, and is known as that of the Ages of the World or the Suns. The  opinion was widely accepted that the present is the fifth age or period of  the world's history; that it has already undergone four destructions by  various causes, and that the present period is also to terminate in  another such catastrophe. The agents of such universal ruin have been a  great flood, a world-wide conflagration, frightful tornadoes and famine,  earthquakes and wild beasts, and hence the Ages, Suns or Periods were  called respectively, from their terminations, those of Water, Fire, Air  and Earth. As we do not know the destiny of the fifth, the present one, it  has as yet no name.    I shall not attempt to go into the details of this myth, the less so as it  has recently been analyzed with much minuteness by the Mexican antiquary  Chavero.[1] I will merely point out that it is too closely identified with  a great many similar myths for us to be allowed to seek an origin for it  peculiar to Mexican or even American soil. We can turn to the Tualati who  live in Oregon, and they will tell us of the four creations and  destructions of mankind; how at the end of the first Age all human beings  were changed into stars; at the end of the second they became stones; at  the end of the third into fishes; and at the close of the fourth they  disappeared, to give place to the tribes that now inhabit the world.[2] Or  we can read from the cuneiform inscriptions of ancient Babylon, and find  the four destructions of the race there specified, as by a flood, by wild  beasts, by famine and by pestilence.[3]    [Footnote 1: Alfredo Chavero, _La Piedra del Sol_, in the _Anales del  Museo Nacional_, Tom. i, p. 353, et seq.]    [Footnote 2: A.S. Gatschet, _The Four Creations of Mankind_, a Tualati  myth, in _Transactions of the Anthropological Society of Washington_, Vol.  i, p. 60 (1881).]    [Footnote 3: Paul Haupt, _Der Keilinschriftliche Sintfluthbericht_, p. 17  (Leipzig, 1881).]    The explanation which I have to give of these coincidences--which could  easily be increased--is that the number four was chosen as that of the  four cardinal points, and that the fifth or present age, that in which we  live, is that which is ruled by the ruler of the four points, by the  Spirit of Light, who was believed to govern them, as, in fact, the early  dawn does, by defining the relations of space, act as guide and governor  of the motions of men.    All through Aztec mythology, traditions and customs, we can discover this  ancient myth of the four brothers, the four ancestors of their race, or  the four chieftains who led their progenitors to their respective  habitations. The rude mountaineers of Meztitlan, who worshiped with  particular zeal Tezcatlipoca and Quetzalcoatl, and had inscribed, in  gigantic figures, the sacred five points, symbol of the latter, on the  side of a vast precipice in their land, gave the symbolic titles to the  primeval quadruplet;--    _Ixcuin_, He who has four faces.    _Hueytecpatl_, the ancient Flint-stone.    _Tentetemic_, the Lip-stone that slays.    _Nanacatltzatzi_, He who speaks when intoxicated with the poisonous  mushroom, called _nanacatl_.    These four brothers, according to the myth, were born of the goddess,  Hueytonantzin, which means \"our great, ancient mother,\" and, with unfilial  hands, turned against her and slew her, sacrificing her to the Sun and  offering her heart to that divinity.[1] In other words, it is the old  story of the cardinal points, defined at daybreak by the Dawn, the eastern  Aurora, which is lost in or sacrificed to the Sun on its appearance.    [Footnote 1: Gabriel de Chaves, _Relacion de la Provincia de Meztitlan_,  1556, in the _Colecion de Documentos Ineditos del Archivo de Indias_, Tom.  iv, pp. 535 and 536. The translations of the names are not given by  Chaves, but I think they are correct, except, possibly, the third, which  may be a compound of _tentetl_, lipstone, _temictli_, dream, instead of  with _temicti_, slayer.]    Of these four brothers I suspect the first, Ixcuin, \"he who looks four  ways,\" or \"has four faces,\" is none other than Quetzalcoatl,[1] while the  Ancient Flint is probably Tezcatlipoca, thus bringing the myth into  singularly close relationship with that of the Iroquois, given on a  previous page.    [Footnote 1: _Ixcuina_ was also the name of the goddess of pleasure. The  derivation is from _ixtli_, face, _cui_, to take, and _na_, four. See the  note of MM. Jourdanet and Simeon to their translation of Sahagun,  _Historia_ p. 22.]    Another myth of the Aztecs gave these four brothers or primitive heroes,  as:--    Huitzilopochtli.  Huitznahua.  Itztlacoliuhqui.  Pantecatl.    Of these Dr. Schultz-Sellack advances plausible reasons for believing that  Itztlacoliuhqui, which was the name of a certain form of head-dress, was  another title of Quetzalcoatl; and that Pantecatl was one of the names of  Tezcatlipoca.[1] If this is the case we have here another version of the  same myth.    [Footnote 1: Dr. Schultz Sellack, _Die Amerikanischen Goetter der Vier  Weltgegenden und ihre Tempel in Palenque_, in the _Zeitschrift fuer  Ethnologie_, Bd. xi, (1879).]      Sec.3. _Quetzalcoatl, the Hero of Tula._    But it was not Quetzalcoatl the god, the mysterious creator of the visible  world, on whom the thoughts of the Aztec race delighted to dwell, but on  Quetzalcoatl, high priest in the glorious city of Tollan (Tula), the  teacher of the arts, the wise lawgiver, the virtuous prince, the master  builder and the merciful judge.    Here, again, though the scene is transferred from heaven to earth and from  the cycles of other worlds to a date not extremely remote, the story  continues to be of his contest with Tezcatlipoca, and of the wiles of this  enemy, now diminished to a potent magician and jealous rival, to  dispossess and drive him from famous Tollan.    No one versed in the metaphors of mythology can be deceived by the thin  veil of local color which surrounds the myth in this its terrestrial and  historic form. Apart from its being but a repetition or continuation of  the genuine ancient account of the conflict of day and night, light and  darkness, which I have already given, the name Tollan is enough to point  out the place and the powers with which the story deals. For this Tollan,  where Quetzalcoatl reigned, is not by any means, as some have supposed,  the little town of Tula, still alive, a dozen leagues or so northwest from  the city of Mexico; nor was it, as the legend usually stated, in some  undefined locality from six hundred to a thousand leagues northwest of  that city; nor yet in Asia, as some antiquaries have maintained; nor,  indeed, anywhere upon this weary world; but it was, as the name denotes,  and as the native historian Tezozomoc long since translated it, where the  bright sun lives, and where the god of light forever rules so long as that  orb is in the sky. Tollan is but a syncopated form of _Tonatlan_, the  Place of the Sun.[1]    [Footnote 1: \"Tonalan, o lugar del sol,\" says Tezozomoc (_Cronica  Mexicana_, chap. i). The full form is _Tonatlan_, from _tona_, \"hacer  sol,\" and the place ending _tlan_. The derivation from _tollin_, a rush,  is of no value, and it is nothing to the point that in the picture writing  Tollan was represented by a bundle of rushes (Kingsborough, vol. vi, p.  177, note), as that was merely in accordance with the rules of the picture  writing, which represented names by rebuses. Still more worthless is the  derivation given by Herrera (_Historia de las Indias Occidentals_, Dec.  iii, Lib. i, cap. xi), that it means \"Lugar de Tuna\" or the place where  the tuna (the fruit of the Opuntia) is found; inasmuch as the word _tuna_  is not from the Aztec at all, but belongs to that dialect of the Arawack  spoken by the natives of Cuba and Haiti.]    It is worth while to examine the whereabouts and character of this  marvelous city of Tollan somewhat closely, for it is a place that we hear  of in the oldest myths"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11039"],[0,"A Woman's Journey Round the World (#12)"],[1,"Inn, where clean rooms and beds, and  skilfully spiced dishes, possessed more attraction for us.    27th September.  From Porto d'Estrella to Petropolis, the distance  is seven leagues.  This portion of the journey is generally  performed upon mules, the charge for which is four milreis (8s. 8d.)  each, but as we had been told in Rio Janeiro that the road afforded  a beautiful walk, parts of it traversing splendid woods, and that it  was besides much frequented, and perfectly safe, being the great  means of communication with Minas Gueras, we determined to go on  foot, and that the more willingly, as the Count wished to botanize,  and I to collect insects.  The first eight miles lay through a broad  valley, covered with thick brambles and young trees, and surrounded  with lofty mountains.  The wild pine-apples at the side of the road  presented a most beautiful appearance; they were not quite ripe, and  were tinged with the most delicate red.  Unfortunately, they are far  from being as agreeable to the taste as they are to the sight, and  consequently are very seldom gathered.  I was greatly amused with  the humming-birds, of which I saw a considerable number of the  smallest species.  Nothing can be more graceful and delicate than  these little creatures.  They obtain their food from the calyx of  the flowers, round which they flutter like butterflies, and indeed  are very often mistaken for them in their rapid flight.  It is very  seldom that they are seen on a branch or twig in a state of repose.  After passing through the valley, we reached the Serra, as the  Brazilians term the summit of each mountain that they cross; the  present one was 3,000 feet high.  A broad paved road, traversing  virgin forests, runs up the side of the mountain.    I had always imagined that in virgin forests the trees had  uncommonly thick and lofty trunks; I found that this was not here  the case.  The vegetation is probably too luxuriant, and the larger  trunks are suffocated and rot beneath the masses of smaller trees,  bushes, creepers, and parasites.  The two latter description of  plants are so abundant, and cover so completely the trees, that it  is often impossible to see even the leaves, much less the stems and  branches.  Herr Schleierer, a botanist, assured us that he once  found upon one tree six and thirty different kinds of creepers and  parasites.    We gathered a rich harvest of flowers, plants, and insects, and  loitered along, enchanted with the magnificent woods and not less  beautiful views, which stretched over hill and dale, towards the sea  and its bays, and even as far as the capital itself.    Frequent truppas, {34a} driven by negroes, as well as the number of  pedestrians we met, eased our minds of every fear, and prevented us  from regarding it as at all remarkable that we were being  continually followed by a negro.  As, however, we arrived at a  somewhat lonely spot, he sprang suddenly forward, holding in one  hand a long knife and in the other a lasso, {34b} rushed upon us,  and gave us to understand, more by gestures than words, that he  intended to murder, and then drag us into the forest.    We had no arms, as we had been told that the road was perfectly  safe, and the only weapons of defence we possessed were our  parasols, if I except a clasp knife, which I instantly drew out of  my pocket and opened, fully determined to sell my life as dearly as  possible.  We parried our adversary's blows as long as we could with  our parasols, but these lasted but a short time; besides, he caught  hold of mine, which, as we were struggling for it, broke short off,  leaving only a piece of the handle in my hand.  In the struggle,  however, he dropped his knife, which rolled a few steps from him; I  instantly made a dash, and thought I had got it, when he, more quick  than I, thrust me away with his feet and hands, and once more  obtained possession of it.  He waved it furiously over my head, and  dealt me two wounds, a thrust and a deep gash, both in the upper  part of the left arm; I thought I was lost, and despair alone gave  me the courage to use my own knife.  I made a thrust at his breast;  this he warded off, and I only succeeded in wounding him severely in  the hand.  The Count sprang forward, and seized the fellow from  behind, and thus afforded me an opportunity of raising myself from  the ground.  The whole affair had not taken more than a few seconds.  The negro's fury was now roused to its highest pitch by the wounds  he had received:  he gnashed his teeth at us like a wild beast, and  flourished his knife with frightful rapidity.  The Count, in his  turn, had received a cut right across the hand, and we had been  irrevocably lost, had not Providence sent us assistance.  We heard  the tramp of horses' hoofs upon the road, upon which the negro  instantly left us and sprang into the wood.  Immediately afterwards  two horsemen turned a corner of the road, and we hurried towards  them; our wounds, which were bleeding freely, and the way in which  our parasols were hacked, soon made them understand the state of  affairs.  They asked us which direction the fugitive had taken, and,  springing from their horses, hurried after him; their efforts,  however, would have been fruitless, if two negroes, who were coming  from the opposite side, had not helped them.  As it was, the fellow  was soon captured.  He was pinioned, and, as he would not walk,  severely beaten, most of the blows being dealt upon the head, so  that I feared the poor wretch's skull would be broken.  In spite of  this he never moved a muscle, and lay, as if insensible to feeling,  upon the ground.  The two other negroes were obliged to seize hold  of him, when he endeavoured to bite every one within his reach, like  a wild beast, and carry him to the nearest house.  Our preservers,  as well as the Count and myself, accompanied them.  We then had our  wounds dressed, and afterwards continued our journey; not, it is  true, entirely devoid of fear, especially when we met one or more  negroes but without any further mishap, and with a continually  increasing admiration of the beautiful scenery.    The colony of Petropolis is situated in the midst of a virgin  forest, at an elevation of 2,500 feet above the level of the sea,  and, at the time of our visit, it had been founded about fourteen  months, with the especial purpose of furnishing the capital with  certain kinds of fruit and vegetables, which, in tropical climates,  will thrive only in very high situations.  A small row of houses  already formed a street, and on a large space that had been cleared  away stood the wooden carcase of a larger building--the Imperial  Villa, which, however, would have some difficulty in presenting  anything like an imperial appearance, on account of the low doors  that contrasted strangely with the broad, lofty windows.  The town  is to be built around the villa, though several detached houses are  situated at some distance away in the woods.  One portion of the  colonists, such as mechanics, shop-keepers, etc., had been presented  with small plots of ground for building upon, near the villa; the  cultivators of the soil had received larger patches, although not  more than two or three yokes.  What misery must not these poor  people have suffered in their native country to have sought another  hemisphere for the sake of a few yokes of land!    We here found the good old woman who had been our fellow passenger  from Germany to Rio Janeiro, in company with her son.  Her joy at  being once more able to share in the toils and labours of her  favourite had, in this short space of time, made her several years  younger.  Her son acted as our guide, and conducted us over the  infant colony, which is situated in broad ravines; the surrounding  hills are so steep, that when they are cleared of timber and  converted into gardens, the soft earth is easily washed away by  heavy showers.    At a distance of four miles from the colony, a waterfall foams down  a chasm which it has worn away for itself.  It is more remarkable  for its valley-like enclosure of noble mountains, and the solemn  gloom of the surrounding woods, than for its height or body of  water.    29th September.  In spite of the danger we had incurred in coming,  we returned to Porto d'Estrella on foot, went on board a bark,  sailed all night, and arrived safely in Rio Janeiro the next  morning.  Every one, both in Petropolis and the capital, was so  astonished at the manner in which our lives had been attempted, that  if we had not been able to show our wounds we should never have been  believed.  The fellow was at first thought to have been drunk or  insane, and it was not till later that we learned the real motives  of his conduct.  He had some time previously been punished by his  master for an offence, and on meeting us in the wood, he no doubt  thought that it was a good opportunity of satisfying, with impunity,  his hatred against the whites.

We left Rio Janeiro in the morning, and proceeded in a  steamer as far as the port of Sampajo, a distance of twenty-eight  miles.  This port lies at the mouth of the river Maccacu, but  consists of only one inn and two or three small houses.  We here  hired mules to take us to the town of Morroqueimado, eighty miles  off.    I may take this opportunity of remarking that it is the custom in  the Brazils to hire the mules without muleteers--a"]]]
