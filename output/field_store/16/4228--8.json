The part of the stem below the cotyledons (_hypocotyl_)  commonly plays the greater part in bringing this about. Exalbuminous  Dicotyledons usually store reserve-food in their cotyledons, which  may in germination remain below ground (_hypogeal_). In albuminous  Monocotyledons the cotyledon itself, probably in consequence of its  terminal position, is commonly the agent by which the embryo is thrust  out of the seed, and it may function solely as a feeder, its extremity  developing as a sucker through which the endosperm is absorbed, or  it may become the first green organ, the terminal sucker dropping  off with the seed-coat when the endosperm is exhausted. Exalbuminous  Monocotyledons are either hydrophytes or strongly hygrophilous plants  and have often peculiar features in germination.    [v.02 p.0013]      _Vegetative reproduction._    Distribution by seed appears to satisfy so well the requirements of  Angiosperms that distribution by vegetative buds is only an occasional  process. At the same time every bud on a shoot has the capacity  to form a new plant if placed in suitable conditions, as the  horticultural practice of propagation by cuttings shows; in nature we  see plants spreading by the rooting of their shoots, and buds we know  may be freely formed not only on stems but on leaves and on roots.  Where detachable buds are produced, which can be transported through  the air to a distance, each of them is an incipient shoot which may  have a root, and there is always reserve-food stored in some part of  it. In essentials such a bud resembles a seed. A relation between  such vegetative distribution buds and production of flower is usually  marked. Where there is free formation of buds there is little flower  and commonly no seed, and the converse is also the case. Viviparous  plants are an illustration of substitution of vegetative buds for  flower.      _Phylogeny and taxonomy._    The position of Angiosperms as the highest plant-group is  unassailable, but of the point or points of their origin from the  general stem of the plant kingdom, and of the path or paths of their  evolution, we can as yet say little.    Until well on in the Mesozoic period geological history tells us  nothing about Angiosperms, and then only by their vegetative organs.  We readily recognize in them now-a-days the natural classes of  Dicotyledons and Monocotyledons distinguished alike in vegetative  and in reproductive construction, yet showing remarkable parallel  sequences in development; and we see that the Dicotyledons are the  more advanced and show the greater capacity for further progressive  evolution. But there is no sound basis for the assumption that  the Dicotyledons are derived from Monocotyledons; indeed, the  palaeontological evidence seems to point to the Dicotyledons being  the older. This, however, does not entitle us to assume the origin  of Monocotyledons from Dicotyledons, although there is manifestly a  temptation to connect helobic forms of the former with ranal ones of  the latter. There is no doubt that the phylum of Angiosperms has not  sprung from that of Gymnosperms.    Within each class the flower-characters as the essential feature  of Angiosperms supply the clue to phylogeny, but the uncertainty  regarding the construction of the primitive angiospermous flower gives  a fundamental point of divergence in attempts to construct progressive  sequences of the families. Simplicity of flower-structure has appeared  to some to be always primitive, whilst by others it has been taken to  be always derived. There is, however, abundant evidence that it may  have the one or the other character in different cases. Apart from  this, botanists are generally agreed that the concrescence of parts of  the flower-whorls--in the gynaeceum as the seed-covering, and in the  corolla as the seat of attraction, more than in the androecium and the  calyx--is an indication of advance, as is also the concrescence  that gives the condition of epigyny. Dorsiventrality is also clearly  derived from radial construction, and anatropy of the ovule has  followed atropy. We should expect the albuminous state of the seed  to be an antecedent one to the exalbuminous condition, and the recent  discoveries in fertilization tend to confirm this view. Amongst  Dicotyledons the gamopetalous forms are admitted to be the highest  development and a dominant one of our epoch. Advance has been along  two lines, markedly in relation to insect-pollination, one of which  has culminated in the hypogynous epipetalous bicarpellate forms with  dorsiventral often large and loosely arranged flowers such as occur  in Scrophulariaceae, and the other in the epigynous bicarpellate  small-flowered families of which the Compositae represent the most  elaborate type. In the polypetalous forms progression from hypogyny  to epigyny is generally recognized, and where dorsiventrality with  insect-pollination has been established, a dominant group has been  developed as in the Leguminosae. The starting-point of the class,  however, and the position within it of apetalous families with  frequently unisexual flowers, have provoked much discussion. In  Monocotyledons a similar advance from hypogyny to epigyny is observed,  and from the dorsiventral to the radial type of flower. In this  connexion it is noteworthy that so many of the higher forms are  adapted as bulbous geophytes, or as aerophytes to special xerophilous  conditions. The Gramineae offer a prominent example of a dominant  self-pollinated or wind-pollinated family, and this may find  explanation in a multiplicity of factors.    Though best known for his artificial (or sexual) system, Linnaeus  was impressed with the importance of elaborating a natural system of  arrangement in which plants should be arranged according to their true  affinities. In his _Philosophia Botanica_ (1751) Linnaeus grouped the  genera then known into sixty-seven orders (_fragmenta_), all except  five of which are Angiosperms. He gave names to these but did not  characterize them or attempt to arrange them in larger groups.  Some represent natural groups and had in several cases been already  recognized by Ray and others, but the majority are, in the light  of modern knowledge, very mixed. Well-defined polypetalous and  gamopetalous genera sometimes occur in the same order, and even  Monocotyledons and Dicotyledons are classed together where they have  some striking physiological character in common.    Work on the lines suggested by the Linnaean _fragmenta_ was continued  in France by Bernard de Jussieu and his nephew, Antoine Laurent,  and the arrangement suggested by the latter in his _Genera Plantarum  secundum Ordines Naturales disposita_ (1789) is the first which can  claim to be a natural system. The orders are carefully characterized,  and those of Angiosperms are grouped in fourteen classes under the two  main divisions Monocotyledons and Dicotyledons. The former comprise  three classes, which are distinguished by the relative position of the  stamens and ovary; the eleven classes of the latter are based on the  same set of characters and fall into the larger subdivisions Apetalae,  Monopetalae and Polypetalae, characterized respectively by absence,  union or freedom of the petals, and a subdivision, _Diclines  Irregulares_, a very unnatural group, including one class only. A.P.  de Candolle introduced several improvements into the system. In his  arrangement the last subdivision disappears, and the Dicotyledons fall  into two groups, a larger containing those in which both calyx and  corolla are present in the flower, and a smaller, Monochlamydeae,  representing the Apetalae and _Diclines Irregulares_ of Jussieu.  The dichlamydeous group is subdivided into three, Thalamiflorae,  Calyciflorae and Corolliflorae, depending on the position and union of  the petals. This, which we may distinguish as the French system,  finds its most perfect expression in the classic _Genera Plantarum_  (1862-1883) of Bentham and Hooker, a work containing a description,  based on careful examination of specimens, of all known genera of  flowering plants. The subdivision is as follows:--      DICOTYLEDONS.      Polypetalae:    Thalamiflorae.    Disciflorae.    Calyciflorae.      Gamopetalae:    Inferae.    Heteromerae.    Bicarpellatae.      Monochlamydeae in eight series.    Monocotyledons in seven series.    Of the Polypetalae, series 1, Thalamiflorae, is characterized by  hypogynous petals and stamens, and contains 34 orders distributed in 6  larger groups or cohorts. Series 2, Disciflorae, takes its name from  a development of the floral axis which forms a ring or cushion at the  base of the ovary or is broken up into glands; the ovary is superior.  It contains 23 orders in 4 cohorts. Series 3, Calyciflorae, has petals  and stamens perigynous, or sometimes superior. It contains 27 orders  in 5 cohorts.    Of the Gamopetalae, series 1, Inferae, has an interior ovary and  stamens usually as many as the corolla-lobes. It contains 9 orders  in 3 cohorts. Series 2, Heteromerae, has generally a superior ovary,  stamens as many as the corolla-lobes or more, and more than two  carpels. It contains 12 orders in 3 cohorts. Series 3, Bicarpellatae,  has generally a superior ovary and usually two carpels. It contains 24  orders in 4 cohorts.    The eight series of Monochlamydeae, containing 36 orders, form groups  characterized mainly by differences in the ovary and ovules, and are  now recognized as of unequal value.    The seven series of Monocotyledons represent a sequence beginning  with the most complicated epigynous orders, such as Orchideae and  Scitamineae, and passing through the petaloid hypogynous orders  (series Coronarieae) of which Liliaceae is the representative to  Juncaceae and the palms (series Calycinae) where the perianth loses  its petaloid character and thence to the Aroids, screw-pines and  others where it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13602"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#12)"],[1,"nutes. This had to be given very weak or else it would  be harmful, Aunt Arrie explained.) Garlic and whiskey, and den, dar  ain't nothin' better fer the pneumony dan splinter tea. I've cured bad  cases with it.\" (That is made by pouring boiling water over lightwood  splinters.)    Aunt Arrie told of their life on the plantation and it was not unlike  that of other slaves who had good masters who looked after them. They  had plenty to eat and to wear. Their food was given them and they cooked  and ate their meals in the cabins in family groups. Santa Claus always  found his way to the Quarters and brought them stick candy and other  things to eat. She said for their Christmas dinner there was always a  big fat hen and a hog head.    In slavery days the negroes had quiltings, dances, picnics and everybody  had a good time, Aunt Arrie said, \"an' I kin dance yit when I hears a  fiddle.\" They had their work to do in the week days, but when Sundays  came there was no work, everybody rested and on \"preachin' days\" went to  Church. Her father took them all to old Rehoboth, the neighborhood white  church, and they worshiped together, white and black, the negroes in  the gallery. That was back in the days when there was \"no lookin'  neither to the right nor to the left\" when in church; no matter what  happened, no one could even half way smile. This all was much harder  than having to listen to the long tiresome sermons of those days, Arrie  thinks, specially when she recalled on one occasion \"when Mr. Sutton wuz  a preachin' a old goat [HW: got] up under the Church an' every time Mr.  Sutton would say something out real loud that old goat would go 'Bah-a-a  Bah ba-a-a' an' we couldn't laugh a bit. I most busted, I wanted ter  laugh so bad.\"    \"Yassum, in dem days\" continued Aunt Arrie, \"all us colored folks went  to the white folks church kase us didn't have no churches of our own and  day want no colored preachers den, but some what wuz called  \"Chairbacks\". The Chairback fellows went er round preachin' an' singin'  in the cabins down in the Quarters and dey use ter have the bes'  meetin's, folks would be converted an' change dey way. De hymns dey sung  de most wuz \"Amazin' Grace\" an' \"Am I Born ter Die?\" I 'members de  meetin's us use ter have down in our cabin an' how everybody would pray  an' sing.\"    \"Dey ain't nothin' lak it use ter be,\" sighed Aunt Arrie, \"Now when I  first could recollect, when a nigger died they sot up with de corpse all  night and de next day had de funeral an' when dey started to the burial  ground with the body every body in the whole procession would sing  hymns. I've heard 'em 'nough times clear 'cross the fields, singin' and  moanin' as they went. Dem days of real feelin' an' keerin' is gone.\"    When freedom came there were sad times on the Sybert plantation, Arrie  said. \"Old Miss cried and cried, and all us cried too. Old Miss said  'You'al jest goin' off to perish.' Aunt Jennie, one of the oldest women  slaves stayed on with her and took keer of her, but all us stayed on a  while. Us didn't know whar to go an' what ter do, an' den come Dr.  Peters and Mr. Allen frum Arkansas to git han's to go out dar an' work  fer dem. My Pa took his family and we stayed two years. It took us might  nigh ar whole week to git dar, we went part way on de train and den rid  de steam boat up de Mississippi River ter de landin'. We worked in the  cotton field out dar and done all kinds er work on de farm, but us  didn't like an' Dr. Peters an' Mr. Allen give my Pa money fer us ter  come home on. 'Fore we could git started my oldest brother wanted to  come home so bad he jest pitched out and walked all de way frum Arkansas  to our old home in Georgy. We come back by Memphis and den come on home  on de train. When we wuz out dar I went to school an' got as far as  'Baker'. Dat's de only schoolin' I ever had.\"    Aunt Arrie told about her courtship and marriage, she remembers all  about it and grew rather sentimental and sad while she talked. She said  that Franklin Binns was going with her before she went to live in  Arkansas and when she came home he picked up the courtship where he had  left off when she went away. He would ride 20 miles on horseback to see  her. He brought her candy and nice things to eat, but she still wouldn't  \"give him no satisfaction 'bout whether she keered fer him er not.\" She  said other men wanted to come to see her, but she paid them not one bit  of attention. \"No mam, I wouldn't 'cept of them, I never did go with in  an' everybody, I don't do dat yit.\" She said one day Franklin was to see  her and said \"Less us marry, I think 'nough of you to marry.\" She said  she wouldn't tell him nothin' so he went to see her parents and they  agreed, so she married him sometime later. They were married by a white  minister, Mr. Joe Carter.    Aunt Arrie leads a lonely life now. She grieves for her loved ones more  than negroes usually do. She doesn't get about much, but \"I does go over  to see Sis Lou (a neighbor) every now an' den fer consolation.\" She says  she is living on borrowed time because she has always taken care of  herself and worked and been honest. She said that now she is almost at  the close of her life waiting day by day for the call to come, she is  glad she knew slavery, glad she was reared by good white people who  taught her the right way to live, and she added: \"Mistess, I'se so glad  I allus worked hard an' been honest--hit has sho paid me time an' time  agin.\"          [HW: Dist. 5  ExSlv. #7  Driskell]    HENRY BLAND--EX-SLAVE  [MAY -- --]      Henry Bland is one of the few living ex-slaves who was born on a  plantation near Edenton, Ga., in 1851. His parents were Martha and Sam  Coxton. In this family group were three other children, two girls and  one boy, who was the oldest. When questioned regarding the birthplace  and the movements of his parents, Mr. Bland stated that his father was  born in Hancock County, Ga. His mother along with her mother was brought  to Georgia by the speculator with a drove of other slaves. The first  thing that he remembers of his parents is when he was quite small and  was allowed to remain in the Master's kitchen in the \"big house\" where  his mother was cook.    Mr. Coxton, who was the owner of Mr. Bland and his family, was described  as being very rich and influential man in the community where he lived.  Says Mr. Bland, \"His only fault was that of drinking too much of the  whisky that he distilled on the plantation.\" Unlike some of the other  slave owners in that section, Mr. Coxton was very kind to his slaves.  His plantation was a large one and on it was raised cotton, corn,  cane[TR:?], vegetables, and live stock. More cotton was grown than  anything else.    From the time he was 1 year and 6 months of age until he was 9 years old  he lived in the \"big house\" with his mother. At night he slept on the  floor there. In spite of this, his and his mother's treatment was  considerably better than that received by those slaves who worked in the  fields. While their food consisted of the same things as did that of the  field slaves, sometimes choice morsels came back to the kitchen from the  Master's table. He says that his mother's clothes were of better quality  than the other slave women (those who were not employed in the house).    As a child his first job was to cut wood for the stove, pick up chips,  and to drive the cows to and from the pasture. When 9 years old he was  sent to the field as a plow boy. Here he worked with a large number of  other slaves (he does not know the exact number) who were divided into  two groups, the plow group and the hoe group. His father happened to be  the foreman of the hoe gang. His brothers and sisters also worked here  in the fields being required to hoe as well as plow. When picking time  came, everyone was required to pick. The usual amount of cotton each  person was required to pick was 200 lbs. per day. However, when this  amount was not picked by some they were not punished by the overseer, as  was the case on neighboring plantations, because Mr. Coxton realized  that some could do more work than others. Mr. Coxton often told his  overseer that he had not been hired to whip the slaves, but to teach  them how to work.    Says Mr. Bland: \"Our working hours were the same as on any other  plantation. We had to get up every morning before sun-up and when it was  good and light we were in the field. A bugle was blown to wake us.\" All  the slaves stayed in the field until dark. After leaving the field they  were never required to do any work but could spend their time as they  saw fit to. No work was required on Saturday or Sunday with the  exception that the stock had to be cared for. Besides those days when no  work was required, there was the 4th of July and Christmas on which the  slaves were permitted to do as they pleased. These two latter dates were  usually spent in true holiday spirit as the master usually gave a big  feast in the form of a barbecue and allowed them to invite their  friends.    When darkness came they sang and danced and this was what they called a  \"frolic.\" As a general rule this same thing was permitted after the  crops had been gathered. Music for these occasions was furnished by  violin, banjo and a clapping of hands. Mr. Bland says that he used to  help furnish this music as Mr. Coxton had bought him a violin.    On the Coxton plantation all slaves always had a sufficient amount of  clothing. These clothes which were issued when needed and not at any  certain time included articles for Sunday wear as well as articles for  work. Those servants who worked in the \"big house\" wore practically the  same clothes as the master and his wife with the possible exception that  it met the qualification of being second-handed. An issue of work  clothing included a heavy pair of work shoes called brogans, homespun  shirts and a pair of jeans pants. A pair of knitted socks "]]]
