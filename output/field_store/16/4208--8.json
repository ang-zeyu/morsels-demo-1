[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13127"],[0,"Observations on the Mussulmauns of India (#12)"],[1,"  Ali (the standard-bearer and relation of Hosein) appeared to him in his  dream, commanding him, that as soon as his duties at Mecca were fulfilled  he should, without delay, proceed to Kraabaallah, to the tomb of Hosein;  directing him, with great precision, how he was to find the exact spot of  earth where was deposited the very Allum[2] (banner) of Hosein, which he  (Abass Ali) had, on the great day of Kraabaallah, carried to the field.  The man was further instructed to possess himself of this relic secretly,  and convey it about his person until he should reach his native country,  when he would be more fully directed by the orderings of Providence how  the relic should be disposed of.    'The Hadjee followed all the injunctions he had received punctually; the  exact spot was easily discovered, by the impressions from his dream; and,  fearing the jealousy of the Arabs, he used the utmost precaution, working  by night, to secure to himself the possession of so inestimable a prize,  without exciting their suspicion, or attracting the notice of the numerous  pilgrims who thronged the shrine by day. After several nights of severe  labour he discovered, to his great joy, the metal crest of the banner; and  concluding the banner and staff to have mouldered away, from their having  been so long entombed in the earth, he cautiously secreted the crest about  his person, and after enduring the many vicissitudes and privations,  attendant on the long journey from Arabia to India, he finally succeeded  in reaching Lucknow in safety with his prize.    'The Nuwaub Asof ood Duolah[3] ruled at this period in Oude; the pilgrim  made his adventures known to him, narrating his dream, and the  circumstances which led to his gaining possession of the crest. The Nuwaub  gave full credence to his story, and became the holder of the relic  himself, rewarding the Hadjee handsomely for his trouble, and gave  immediate orders for a small building to be erected under the denomination  of \"Huzerut Abass Ali Ke Durgah\",[4] in which the crest was safely  deposited with due honours, and the fortunate pilgrim was appointed  guardian with a liberal salary.    'In the course of time, this Durgah grew into great repute amongst the  general classes of the Mussulmaun population, who, venerating their Emaum  Hosein, had more than common respect for this trifle, which they believed  had been used in his personal service. Here the public were permitted to  offer their sacrifices and oblations to God, on occasions of importance to  themselves; as after the performance of the rite of circumcision in  particular, grand processions were formed conveying the youthful  Mussulmaun, richly attired, attended by music, &c. and offering presents  of money and sweetmeats at the shrine which contains their Emaum's sacred  relic. On these occasions the beggars of every denomination were benefited  by the liberality of the grateful father, and the offerings at the shrine  became the property of the guardian of the Durgah, who, it was expected,  would deal out from his receipts to the necessitous as occasions served.'    This custom is still observed, with equal veneration for the shrine and  its deposit; and when a lady recovers from the perils attendant on giving  to her husband's house a desired heir, she is conveyed, with all the pomp  and parade due to her rank in life, to this Durgah, attended by her female  relatives, friends, domestics, eunuchs, and slaves, in covered conveyances;  in her train are gentlemen on horseback, in palkies, or on elephants, to  do honour to the joyful event; the Guardian's wife having charge on these  occasions of the ladies' visits; and the Guardian, with the gentlemen and  all the males, guarding the sanctuary outside; for they are not permitted  to enter whilst it is occupied by the ladies, the eunuchs alone having  that privilege where females congregate.    Recovery from sickness, preservation from any grievous calamity, danger,  or other event which excites grateful feelings, are the usual inducements  to visiting the Durgah, with both males and females, amongst the  Mussulmaun population of Lucknow. These recurrences yield ample stores of  cash, clothes, &c. left at the disposal of the Guardian, who, if a good  man, disperses these charitable donations amongst the indigent with a  liberality equal to that of the donors in their various offerings.    The Durgah had grown into general respect, when a certain reigning Nuwaub  was afflicted by a severe and tedious illness, which baffled the skill of  his physicians, and resisted the power of the medicine resorted to for his  recovery. A confidential Najoom[5] (astrologer), in the service of his  Highness, of great repute in his profession, advised his master to make a  vow, that 'If in the wisdom of Divine Providence his health should be  restored, he would build a new Durgah on the site of the old one, to be  dedicated to Abass Ali, and to be the shrine for the sacred deposit of the  crest of Hosein'. The Nuwaub, it appears, recovered rapidly after the vow  had been made, and he went in great pomp and state to return thanks to God  in this Durgah, surrounded by the nobles and officers of his Court, and  the whole strength of his establishment accompanied him on the occasion.  So grand was the spectacle, that the old people of the city talk of it at  this day as a scene never equalled in the annals of Lucknow, for splendour  and magnificence; immense sums of money were distributed on the road to  the populace, and at the Durgah; the multitude, of all classes, hailing  his emancipation from the couch of sickness with deafening cheers of  vociferous exultation.    In fulfilment of his vow, the Nuwaub gave immediate orders for erecting  the magnificent edifice, which now graces the suburbs of Lucknow, about  five miles from that part of the city usually occupied by the Sovereign  Ruler of the province of Oude. By virtue of the Nuwaub's vow and recovery,  the before-respected Durgah has, thus newly built, increased in favour  with the public; and, on account of the veneration they have for all that  concerns their Emaums, the banners which adorn the Tazias of Hosein must  be consecrated by being brought to this sacred edifice; where, by the  condescending permission of the Sovereign, both the rich and the poor are  with equal favour admitted, at that interesting period of Mahurrum, to  view the crest of their Leader, and present their own banners to be  touched and thus hallowed by the, to them, sacred relic. The crest is  fixed to a staff, but no banner attached to it; this is placed within a  high railing, supported by a platform, in the centre of the building; on  either side splendid banners are exhibited on these occasions.    The Durgah is a square building, entered by flights of steps from the  court-yard; the banner of each person is conveyed through the right  entrance, opposite the platform, where it is immediately presented to  touch the revered crest; this is only the work of a few seconds; that  party walks on, and moves out to the left again into the court-yard; the  next follows in rapid succession, and so on till all have performed this  duty: by this arrangement, confusion is obviated; and, in the course of  the day, perhaps forty or fifty thousand banners[6] may have touched the  Emaum's consecrated crest. On these occasions, the vast population of  Lucknow may be imagined by the almost countless multitude, of every rank,  who visit this Durgah: there is no tax levied on the people, but the sums  collected must be immense, since every one conscientiously offers  something, according to his inclination or his means, out of pure respect  to the memory of Hosein.    The order of procession, appointed by each noble proprietor of banners, to  be consecrated at the Durgah, forms a grand spectacle. There is no  material difference in their countless numbers; the most wealthy and the  meanest subjects of the province make displays commensurate with their  ability, whilst those persons who make the most costly exhibitions enjoy  the greatest share of popular favour, as it is considered a proof of their  desire to do honour to the memory of Hosein and Hasan, their venerated  Emaums.    A description of one, just passing my house, will give you a general idea  of these processions,--it belongs to a rich man of the city:--A guard of  soldiers surrounds four elephants on which several men are seated, on pads  or cushions, supporting the banners; the staffs of several are of  silver,--the spread hand, and other crests, are formed of the same metal,  set with precious stones. Each banner--they all resemble--is in the shape  of a long scarf of rich silk, of bright florid colours, embroidered very  deep at the ends, which are finished with gold and silver bullion fringes;  it is caught together near the middle, and tied with rich gold and silver  cords and tassels to the top of the staff, just under the hand or crest.  The silks, I observe, are of many different colours, forming an agreeable  variety, some blue, purple, green, yellow, &c. Red is not used; being the  Soonies' distinguishing colour at Mahurrum it is carefully avoided by the  zealous Sheahs--the Soonies are violently opposed to the celebration of  this festival. After the elephants, a band of music follows, composed of  every variety of Native instruments, with drums and fifes; the trumpets  strike me as the greatest novelty in their band; some of them are very  long and powerful in their effect.    Next in the order of procession I observe a man in deep mourning,  supporting a black pole, on which two swords are suspended from a bow  reversed--the swords unsheathed glittering in the sun. The person who owns  the banners, or his deputy, follows next on foot, attended by readers of  the Musseeah, and a large party of friends in mourning.

Thy mercies, Lord, how great!  We have not words nor hours enough  Their numbers to repeat.    6 When I'm afflicted, poor and low,  And light and peace depart,  My God beholds my heavy woe,  And bears me on his heart.      Psalm 40:2. 6-9. Second Part. C. M.  The incarnation and sacrifice of Christ.    1 Thus saith the Lord,  \"Your work is vain,  \"Give your burnt offerings o'er,  \"In dying goats and bullocks slain  \"My soul delights no more.\"    2 Then spake the Saviour, \"Lo, I'm here,  \"My God, to do thy will;  \"'Whate'er thy sacred books declare,  \"Thy servant shall fulfil.    3 \"Thy law is ever in my sight,  \"I keep it near my heart;  \"Mine ears are open'd with delight  \"To what thy lips impart.\"    4 And see the bless'd Redeemer comes,  Th' eternal Son appears,  And at th' appointed time assumes  The body God prepares.    5 Much he reveal'd his Father's grace,  And much his truth he shew'd,  And preach'd the way of righteousness,  Where great assemblies stood.    6 His Father's honour touch'd his heart,  He pity'd sinners' cries,  And, to fulfil a Saviour's part,  Was made a sacrifice,    PAUSE.    7 No blood of beasts on altars shed  Could wash the conscience clean,  But the rich sacrifice he paid  Atones for all our sin.    8 Then was the great salvation spread,  And Satan's kingdom shook;  Thus by the woman's promis'd seed  The serpent's head was broke.      Psalm 40:3. 5-10. L. M.  Christ our sacrifice.    1 The wonders, Lord, thy love has wrought,  Exceed our praise, surmount our thought;  Should I attempt the long detail,  My speech would faint, my numbers fail.    2 No blood of beasts on altars spilt,  Can cleanse the souls of men from guilt,  But thou hast set before our eyes  An all-sufficient sacrifice.    3 Lo! thine eternal Son appears,  To thy designs he bows his ears,  Assumes a body, well prepar'd,  And well performs a work so hard.    4 \"Behold, I come,\" (the Saviour cries,  With love and duty in his eyes)  \"I come to bear the heavy load  \"Of sins, and do thy will, my God.    5 \"'Tis written in thy great decree,  \"'Tis in thy book foretold of me,  \"I must fulfil the Saviour's part,  \"And, lo! thy law is in my heart!    6 \"I'll magnify thy holy law,  \"And rebels to obedience draw,  \"'When on my cross I'm lifted high,  \"Or to my crown above the sky.    7 \"The Spirit shall descend, and show  \"What thou hast done, and what I do;  \"The wond'ring world shall learn thy grace,  \"Thy wisdom and thy righteousness.\"      Psalm 41. 1 2 3.  Charity to the poor; or, Pity to the afflicted.    1 Blest is the man whose bowels move,  And melt with pity to the poor,  Whose soul, by sympathising love,  Feels what his fellow-saints endure.    2 His heart contrives for their relief  More good than his own hands can do;  He, in the time of general grief,  Shall find the Lord has bowels too.    3 His soul shall live secure on earth,  With secret blessings on his head,  When drought, and pestilence, and dearth  Around him multiply their dead.    4 Or if he languish on his couch,  God will pronounce his sins forgiv'n,  Will save him with a healing touch,  Or take his willing soul to heaven.      Psalm 42:1. 1-5. First Part.  Desertion and hope; or, Complaint  of absence from public worship.    1 With earnest longings of the mind,  My God, to thee I look;  So pants the hunted hart to find  And taste the cooling brook.    2 When shall I see thy courts of grace,  And meet my God again?  So long an absence from thy face  My heart endures with pain.    3 Temptations vex my weary soul,  And tears are my repast;  The foe insults without control,  \"And where's your God at last?\"    4 'Tis with a mournful pleasure now  I think on ancient days;  Then to thy house did numbers go,  And all our work was praise.    5 But why, my soul, sunk down so far  Beneath this heavy load?  Why do my thoughts indulge despair,  And sin against my God?    6 Hope in the Lord, whose mighty hand  Can all thy woes remove;  For I shall yet before him stand,  And sing restoring love.      Psalm 42:2. 6-11. Second Part.  Melancholy thoughts reproved;  or, Hope in afflictions.    1 My spirit sinks within me, Lord,  But I will call thy name to mind,  And times of past distress record,  When I have found my God was kind.    2 Huge troubles, with tumultuous noise,  Swell like a sea, and round me spread;  Thy water-spouts drown all my joys,  And rising waves roll o'er my head.    3 Yet will the Lord command his love,  When I address his throne by day,  Nor in the night his grace remove;  The night shall hear me sing and pray.    4 I'll cast myself before his feet,  And say \"My God, my heavenly Rock,  \"Why doth thy love so long forget  \"The soul that groans beneath thy stroke?\"    5 I'll chide my heart that sinks so low,  Why should my soul indulge her grief?  Hope in the Lord, and praise him too,  He is my rest, my sure relief.    6 Thy light and truth shall guide me still,  Thy word shall my best thoughts employ,  And lead me to thine heavenly hill,  My God, my most exceeding Joy.      Psalm 44. 1 2 3 8 15-26.  The church's complaint in persecution.    1 Lord, we have heard thy works of old,  Thy works of power and grace,  When to our ears our fathers told  The wonders of their days:    2 How thou didst build thy churches here,  And make thy gospel known;  Amongst them did thine arm appear,  Thy light and glory shone.    3 In God they boasted all the day,  And in a cheerful throng  Did thousands meet to praise and pray,  And grace was all their song.    4 But now our souls are seiz'd with shame,  Confusion fills our face,  To hear the enemy blaspheme,  And fools reproach thy grace.    5 Yet have we not forgot our God,  Nor falsely dealt with heaven,  Nor have our steps declin'd the road  Of duty thou hast given.    6 Tho' dragons all around us roar  With their destructive breath,  And thine own hand has bruis'd us sore  Hard by the gates of death.    PAUSE.    7 We are expos'd all day to die  As martyrs for thy cause,  As sheep for slaughter bound we lie  By sharp and bloody laws.    8 Awake, arise, almighty Lord,  Why sleeps thy wonted grace?  Why should we look like men abhorr'd,  Or banish'd from thy face?    9 Wilt thou for ever cast us off  And still neglect our cries?  For ever hide thine heavenly love  From our afflicted eyes?    10 Down to the dust our soul is bow'd,  And dies upon the ground;  Rise for our help, rebuke the proud,  And all their powers confound.    11 Redeem us from perpetual shame,  Our Saviour and our God;  We plead the honours of thy Name,  The merits of thy blood.      Psalm 45:1. S. M.  The glory of Christ; the success of  the gospel; and the Gentile church.    1 My Saviour and my King,  Thy beauties are divine;  Thy lips with blessings overflow,  And every grace is thine.    2 Now make thy glory known,  Gird on thy dreadful sword,  And ride in majesty to spread  The conquests of thy word.    Strike thro' thy stubborn foes,  Or melt their hearts t'obey,  While justice, meekness, grace, and truth,  Attend thy glorious way.    4 Thy laws, O God, are right;  Thy throne shall ever end;  And thy victorious gospel proves  A sceptre in thy hand.    5 [Thy Father and thy God  Hath without measure shed  His Spirit, like a joyful oil,  T'anoint thy sacred head.]    6 [Behold, at thy right hand  The Gentile church is seen,  Like a fair bride in rich attire,  And princes guard the queen.]    7 Fair bride, receive his love,  Forget thy father's house;  Forsake thy gods, thy idol gods,  And pay thy Lord thy vows.    8 O let thy God and King  Thy sweetest thoughts employ;  Thy children shall his honours sing  In palaces of joy.      Psalm 45:2. C. M.  The personal glories and government of Christ.    1 I'll speak the honours of my King,  His form divinely fair;  None of the sons of mortal race  May with the Lord compare.    2 Sweet is thy speech and heavenly grace  Upon thy lips is shed;  Thy God, with blessings infinite,  Hath crown'd thy sacred head.    3 Gird on thy sword, victorious Prince,  Ride with majestic sway;  Thy terrors shall strike thro' thy foes,  And make the world obey.    4 Thy throne, O God, for ever stands;  Thy word of grace shall prove  A peaceful sceptre in thy hands,  To rule the saints by love.    5 Justice and truth attend thee still  But mercy is thy choice;  And God, thy God, thy soul shall fill  With most peculiar joys.      Psalm 45:3. First Part. L. M.  The glory of Christ, and power of his gospel.    1 Now be my heart inspir'd to sing  The glories of my Saviour-king,  Jesus the Lord; how heavenly fair  His form! how 'bright his beauties are!    2 O'er all the sons of human race  He shines with a superior grace,  Love from his lips divinely flows,  And blessings all his state compose.    3 Dress thee in arms, most mighty Lord,  Gird on the terror of thy sword,  In majesty and glory ride  With truth and meekness at thy side.     4 Thine anger, like a pointed dart,  Shall pierce the foes of stubborn heart;  Or words of mercy kind and sweet  Shall melt the rebels at thy feet.    5 Thy throne, O God, for ever stands,  Grace is the sceptre in thy hands;  Thy laws and works are just and right,  Justice and grace are thy delight.    6 God, thine own God, has richly shed  His oil of gladness on thy head,  And with his sacred Spirit blest  His first-born Son above the rest.      Psalm 45:4. Second Part. L. M.  Christ and his church; or, The mystical marriage.    1 The king of saints, how fair his face,  Adorn'd with majesty and grace!  He comes with blessings from above,  And wins the nations to his love.    2 At his right hand our eyes behold  The queen array'd in purest gold;  The world admires her heavenly dress,  Her robe of joy and righteousness.    3 He forms her beauties like his own;  He calls and seats her near his throne:  Fair stranger, let thine heart forget  The idols of thy native state.    4 So shall the King the more rejoice  In thee, the"]]]
