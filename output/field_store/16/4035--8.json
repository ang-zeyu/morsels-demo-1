Though I  went twice to the door of the marble room, I could not force myself to  enter. It was beyond my strength. I went into the smoking-room and sat  down before the spinet. A small lace handkerchief lay on the keys, and I  turned away, choking. It was plain I could not stay, so I locked every  door, every window, and the three front and back gates, and went away.  Next morning Alcide packed my valise, and leaving him in charge of my  apartments I took the Orient express for Constantinople. During the two  years that I wandered through the East, at first, in our letters, we  never mentioned Genevieve and Boris, but gradually their names crept in.  I recollect particularly a passage in one of Jack's letters replying to  one of mine--    \"What you tell me of seeing Boris bending over you while you lay ill, and  feeling his touch on your face, and hearing his voice, of course troubles  me. This that you describe must have happened a fortnight after he died.  I say to myself that you were dreaming, that it was part of your  delirium, but the explanation does not satisfy me, nor would it you.\"    Toward the end of the second year a letter came from Jack to me in India  so unlike anything that I had ever known of him that I decided to return  at once to Paris. He wrote: \"I am well, and sell all my pictures as  artists do who have no need of money. I have not a care of my own, but I  am more restless than if I had. I am unable to shake off a strange  anxiety about you. It is not apprehension, it is rather a breathless  expectancy--of what, God knows! I can only say it is wearing me out.  Nights I dream always of you and Boris. I can never recall anything  afterward, but I wake in the morning with my heart beating, and all day  the excitement increases until I fall asleep at night to recall the same  experience. I am quite exhausted by it, and have determined to break up  this morbid condition. I must see you. Shall I go to Bombay, or will you  come to Paris?\"    I telegraphed him to expect me by the next steamer.    When we met I thought he had changed very little; I, he insisted, looked  in splendid health. It was good to hear his voice again, and as we sat  and chatted about what life still held for us, we felt that it was  pleasant to be alive in the bright spring weather.    We stayed in Paris together a week, and then I went for a week to Ept  with him, but first of all we went to the cemetery at Sevres, where Boris  lay.    \"Shall we place the 'Fates' in the little grove above him?\" Jack asked,  and I answered--    \"I think only the 'Madonna' should watch over Boris' grave.\" But Jack was  none the better for my home-coming. The dreams of which he could not  retain even the least definite outline continued, and he said that at  times the sense of breathless expectancy was suffocating.    \"You see I do you harm and not good,\" I said. \"Try a change without me.\"  So he started alone for a ramble among the Channel Islands, and I went  back to Paris. I had not yet entered Boris' house, now mine, since my  return, but I knew it must be done. It had been kept in order by Jack;  there were servants there, so I gave up my own apartment and went there  to live. Instead of the agitation I had feared, I found myself able to  paint there tranquilly. I visited all the rooms--all but one. I could not  bring myself to enter the marble room where Genevieve lay, and yet I felt  the longing growing daily to look upon her face, to kneel beside her.    One April afternoon, I lay dreaming in the smoking-room, just as I had  lain two years before, and mechanically I looked among the tawny Eastern  rugs for the wolf-skin. At last I distinguished the pointed ears and flat  cruel head, and I thought of my dream where I saw Genevieve lying beside  it. The helmets still hung against the threadbare tapestry, among them  the old Spanish morion which I remembered Genevieve had once put on when  we were amusing ourselves with the ancient bits of mail. I turned my eyes  to the spinet; every yellow key seemed eloquent of her caressing hand,  and I rose, drawn by the strength of my life's passion to the sealed door  of the marble room. The heavy doors swung inward under my trembling  hands. Sunlight poured through the window, tipping with gold the wings of  Cupid, and lingered like a nimbus over the brows of the Madonna. Her  tender face bent in compassion over a marble form so exquisitely pure  that I knelt and signed myself. Genevieve lay in the shadow under the  Madonna, and yet, through her white arms, I saw the pale azure vein, and  beneath her softly clasped hands the folds of her dress were tinged with  rose, as if from some faint warm light within her breast.    Bending, with a breaking heart, I touched the marble drapery with my  lips, then crept back into the silent house.    A maid came and brought me a letter, and I sat down in the little  conservatory to read it; but as I was about to break the seal, seeing the  girl lingering, I asked her what she wanted.    She stammered something about a white rabbit that had been caught in the  house, and asked what should be done with it I told her to let it loose  in the walled garden behind the house, and opened my letter. It was from  Jack, but so incoherent that I thought he must have lost his reason. It  was nothing but a series of prayers to me not to leave the house until he  could get back; he could not tell me why, there were the dreams, he  said--he could explain nothing, but he was sure that I must not leave the  house in the Rue Sainte-Cecile.    As I finished reading I raised my eyes and saw the same maid-servant  standing in the doorway holding a glass dish in which two gold-fish were  swimming: \"Put them back into the tank and tell me what you mean by  interrupting me,\" I said.    With a half-suppressed whimper she emptied water and fish into an  aquarium at the end of the conservatory, and turning to me asked my  permission to leave my service. She said people were playing tricks on  her, evidently with a design of getting her into trouble; the marble  rabbit had been stolen and a live one had been brought into the house;  the two beautiful marble fish were gone, and she had just found those  common live things flopping on the dining-room floor. I reassured her and  sent her away, saying I would look about myself. I went into the studio;  there was nothing there but my canvases and some casts, except the marble  of the Easter lily. I saw it on a table across the room. Then I strode  angrily over to it. But the flower I lifted from the table was fresh and  fragile and filled the air with perfume.    Then suddenly I comprehended, and sprang through the hall-way to the  marble room. The doors flew open, the sunlight streamed into my face, and  through it, in a heavenly glory, the Madonna smiled, as Genevieve lifted  her flushed face from her marble couch and opened her sleepy eyes.          IN THE COURT OF THE DRAGON        \"Oh, thou who burn'st in heart for those who burn    In Hell, whose fires thyself shall feed in turn;    How long be crying--'Mercy on them.' God!    Why, who art thou to teach and He to learn?\"    In the Church of St. Barnabe vespers were over; the clergy left the  altar; the little choir-boys flocked across the chancel and settled in  the stalls. A Suisse in rich uniform marched down the south aisle,  sounding his staff at every fourth step on the stone pavement; behind him  came that eloquent preacher and good man, Monseigneur C----.    My chair was near the chancel rail, I now turned toward the west end of  the church. The other people between the altar and the pulpit turned too.  There was a little scraping and rustling while the congregation seated  itself again; the preacher mounted the pulpit stairs, and the organ  voluntary ceased.    I had always found the organ-playing at St. Barnabe highly interesting.  Learned and scientific it was, too much so for my small knowledge, but  expressing a vivid if cold intelligence. Moreover, it possessed the  French quality of taste: taste reigned supreme, self-controlled,  dignified and reticent.    To-day, however, from the first chord I had felt a change for the worse,  a sinister change. During vespers it had been chiefly the chancel organ  which supported the beautiful choir, but now and again, quite wantonly as  it seemed, from the west gallery where the great organ stands, a heavy  hand had struck across the church at the serene peace of those clear  voices. It was something more than harsh and dissonant, and it betrayed  no lack of skill. As it recurred again and again, it set me thinking of  what my architect's books say about the custom in early times to  consecrate the choir as soon as it was built, and that the nave, being  finished sometimes half a century later, often did not get any blessing  at all: I wondered idly if that had been the case at St. Barnabe, and  whether something not usually supposed to be at home in a Christian  church might have entered undetected and taken possession of the west  gallery. I had read of such things happening, too, but not in works on  architecture.    Then I remembered that St. Barnabe was not much more than a hundred years  old, and smiled at the incongruous association of mediaeval superstitions  with that cheerful little piece of eighteenth-century rococo.    But now vespers were over, and there should have followed a few quiet  chords, fit to accompany meditation, while we waited for the sermon.  Instead of that, the discord at the lower end of the church broke out  with the departure of the clergy, as if now nothing could control it.

A giant of a white devil had wrested his spear from him as though he,  the mighty Kaviri, had been but a new-born babe.  Hairy monsters were  overcoming his fighting men, and a black chieftain like himself was  fighting shoulder to shoulder with the hideous pack that opposed him.    Kaviri battled bravely against his antagonist, for he felt that death  had already claimed him, and so the least that he could do would be to  sell his life as dearly as possible; but it was soon evident that his  best was quite futile when pitted against the superhuman brawn and  agility of the creature that at last found his throat and bent him back  into the bottom of the canoe.    Presently Kaviri's head began to whirl--objects became confused and dim  before his eyes--there was a great pain in his chest as he struggled  for the breath of life that the thing upon him was shutting off for  ever.  Then he lost consciousness.    When he opened his eyes once more he found, much to his surprise, that  he was not dead.  He lay, securely bound, in the bottom of his own  canoe.  A great panther sat upon its haunches, looking down upon him.    Kaviri shuddered and closed his eyes again, waiting for the ferocious  creature to spring upon him and put him out of his misery of terror.    After a moment, no rending fangs having buried themselves in his  trembling body, he again ventured to open his eyes.   Beyond the  panther kneeled the white giant who had overcome him.    The man was wielding a paddle, while directly behind him Kaviri saw  some of his own warriors similarly engaged.   Back of them again  squatted several of the hairy apes.    Tarzan, seeing that the chief had regained consciousness, addressed him.    \"Your warriors tell me that you are the chief of a numerous people, and  that your name is Kaviri,\" he said.    \"Yes,\" replied the black.    \"Why did you attack me?  I came in peace.\"    \"Another white man 'came in peace' three moons ago,\" replied Kaviri;  \"and after we had brought him presents of a goat and cassava and milk,  he set upon us with his guns and killed many of my people, and then  went on his way, taking all of our goats and many of our young men and  women.\"    \"I am not as this other white man,\" replied Tarzan.   \"I should not  have harmed you had you not set upon me.   Tell me, what was the face  of this bad white man like?  I am searching for one who has wronged me.  Possibly this may be the very one.\"    \"He was a man with a bad face, covered with a great, black beard, and  he was very, very wicked--yes, very wicked indeed.\"    \"Was there a little white child with him?\" asked Tarzan, his heart  almost stopped as he awaited the black's answer.    \"No, bwana,\" replied Kaviri, \"the white child was not with this man's  party--it was with the other party.\"    \"Other party!\" exclaimed Tarzan.  \"What other party?\"    \"With the party that the very bad white man was pursuing.   There was a  white man, woman, and the child, with six Mosula porters.  They passed  up the river three days ahead of the very bad white man.  I think that  they were running away from him.\"    A white man, woman, and child!  Tarzan was puzzled.  The child must be  his little Jack; but who could the woman be--and the man?  Was it  possible that one of Rokoff's confederates had conspired with some  woman--who had accompanied the Russian--to steal the baby from him?    If this was the case, they had doubtless purposed returning the child  to civilization and there either claiming a reward or holding the  little prisoner for ransom.    But now that Rokoff had succeeded in chasing them far inland, up the  savage river, there could be little doubt but that he would eventually  overhaul them, unless, as was still more probable, they should be  captured and killed by the very cannibals farther up the Ugambi, to  whom, Tarzan was now convinced, it had been Rokoff's intention to  deliver the baby.    As he talked to Kaviri the canoes had been moving steadily up-river  toward the chief's village.  Kaviri's warriors plied the paddles in the  three canoes, casting sidelong, terrified glances at their hideous  passengers.  Three of the apes of Akut had been killed in the  encounter, but there were, with Akut, eight of the frightful beasts  remaining, and there was Sheeta, the panther, and Tarzan and Mugambi.    Kaviri's warriors thought that they had never seen so terrible a crew  in all their lives.  Momentarily they expected to be pounced upon and  torn asunder by some of their captors; and, in fact, it was all that  Tarzan and Mugambi and Akut could do to keep the snarling, ill-natured  brutes from snapping at the glistening, naked bodies that brushed  against them now and then with the movements of the paddlers, whose  very fear added incitement to the beasts.    At Kaviri's camp Tarzan paused only long enough to eat the food that  the blacks furnished, and arrange with the chief for a dozen men to man  the paddles of his canoe.    Kaviri was only too glad to comply with any demands that the ape-man  might make if only such compliance would hasten the departure of the  horrid pack; but it was easier, he discovered, to promise men than to  furnish them, for when his people learned his intentions those that had  not already fled into the jungle proceeded to do so without loss of  time, so that when Kaviri turned to point out those who were to  accompany Tarzan, he discovered that he was the only member of his  tribe left within the village.    Tarzan could not repress a smile.    \"They do not seem anxious to accompany us,\" he said; \"but just remain  quietly here, Kaviri, and presently you shall see your people flocking  to your side.\"    Then the ape-man rose, and, calling his pack about him, commanded that  Mugambi remain with Kaviri, and disappeared in the jungle with Sheeta  and the apes at his heels.    For half an hour the silence of the grim forest was broken only by the  ordinary sounds of the teeming life that but adds to its lowering  loneliness.  Kaviri and Mugambi sat alone in the palisaded village,  waiting.    Presently from a great distance came a hideous sound.   Mugambi  recognized the weird challenge of the ape-man.   Immediately from  different points of the compass rose a horrid semicircle of similar  shrieks and screams, punctuated now and again by the blood-curdling cry  of a hungry panther.          Chapter 7    Betrayed      The two savages, Kaviri and Mugambi, squatting before the entrance to  Kaviri's hut, looked at one another--Kaviri with ill-concealed alarm.    \"What is it?\" he whispered.    \"It is Bwana Tarzan and his people,\" replied Mugambi.   \"But what they  are doing I know not, unless it be that they are devouring your people  who ran away.\"    Kaviri shuddered and rolled his eyes fearfully toward the jungle.  In  all his long life in the savage forest he had never heard such an  awful, fearsome din.    Closer and closer came the sounds, and now with them were mingled the  terrified shrieks of women and children and of men.  For twenty long  minutes the blood-curdling cries continued, until they seemed but a  stone's throw from the palisade.  Kaviri rose to flee, but Mugambi  seized and held him, for such had been the command of Tarzan.    A moment later a horde of terrified natives burst from the jungle,  racing toward the shelter of their huts.  Like frightened sheep they  ran, and behind them, driving them as sheep might be driven, came  Tarzan and Sheeta and the hideous apes of Akut.    Presently Tarzan stood before Kaviri, the old quiet smile upon his lips.    \"Your people have returned, my brother,\" he said, \"and now you may  select those who are to accompany me and paddle my canoe.\"    Tremblingly Kaviri tottered to his feet, calling to his people to come  from their huts; but none responded to his summons.    \"Tell them,\" suggested Tarzan, \"that if they do not come I shall send  my people in after them.\"    Kaviri did as he was bid, and in an instant the entire population of  the village came forth, their wide and frightened eyes rolling from one  to another of the savage creatures that wandered about the village  street.    Quickly Kaviri designated a dozen warriors to accompany Tarzan.  The  poor fellows went almost white with terror at the prospect of close  contact with the panther and the apes in the narrow confines of the  canoes; but when Kaviri explained to them that there was no  escape--that Bwana Tarzan would pursue them with his grim horde should  they attempt to run away from the duty--they finally went gloomily down  to the river and took their places in the canoe.    It was with a sigh of relief that their chieftain saw the party  disappear about a headland a short distance up-river.    For three days the strange company continued farther and farther into  the heart of the savage country that lies on either side of the almost  unexplored Ugambi.  Three of the twelve warriors deserted during that  time; but as several of the apes had finally learned the secret of the  paddles, Tarzan felt no dismay because of the loss.    As a matter of fact, he could have travelled much more rapidly on  shore, but he believed that he could hold his own wild crew together to  better advantage by keeping them to the boat as much as possible.  Twice a day they landed to hunt and feed, and at night they slept upon  the bank of the mainland or on one of the numerous little islands that  dotted the river.    Before them the natives fled in alarm, so that they found only deserted  villages in their path as they proceeded.   Tarzan was anxious to get  in touch with some of the savages who dwelt upon the river's banks, but  so far he had been unable to do so.    Finally he decided to take to the land himself, leaving his company to  follow after him by boat.  He explained to Mugambi the thing that he  had in mind, and told Akut to follow the directions of the black.    \"I will join you again in a few"]]]
