One  was a quartermaster. The general commanding the division and the colonel  commanding the brigade, with their staffs and escorts, had ridden into  the notch to have a look at the enemy's guns--which had straightway  obscured themselves in towering clouds of smoke. It was hardly  profitable to be curious about guns which had the trick of the  cuttle-fish, and the season of observation had been brief. At its  conclusion--a short remove backward from where it began--occurred the  conversation already partly reported. \"It is the only place,\" the  general repeated thoughtfully, \"to get at them.\"    The colonel looked at him gravely. \"There is room for only one gun,  General--one against twelve.\"    \"That is true--for only one at a time,\" said the commander with  something like, yet not altogether like, a smile. \"But then, your brave  Coulter--a whole battery in himself.\"    The tone of irony was now unmistakable. It angered the colonel, but he  did not know what to say. The spirit of military subordination is not  favorable to retort, nor even to deprecation.    At this moment a young officer of artillery came riding slowly up the  road attended by his bugler. It was Captain Coulter. He could not have  been more than twenty-three years of age. He was of medium height, but  very slender and lithe, and sat his horse with something of the air of a  civilian. In face he was of a type singularly unlike the men about him;  thin, high-nosed, gray-eyed, with a slight blond mustache, and long,  rather straggling hair of the same color. There was an apparent  negligence in his attire. His cap was worn with the visor a trifle  askew; his coat was buttoned only at the sword-belt, showing a  considerable expanse of white shirt, tolerably clean for that stage of  the campaign. But the negligence was all in his dress and bearing; in  his face was a look of intense interest in his surroundings. His gray  eyes, which seemed occasionally to strike right and left across the  landscape, like search-lights, were for the most part fixed upon the sky  beyond the Notch; until he should arrive at the summit of the road there  was nothing else in that direction to see. As he came opposite his  division and brigade commanders at the road-side he saluted mechanically  and was about to pass on. The colonel signed to him to halt.    \"Captain Coulter,\" he said, \"the enemy has twelve pieces over there on  the next ridge. If I rightly understand the general, he directs that you  bring up a gun and engage them.\"    There was a blank silence; the general looked stolidly at a distant  regiment swarming slowly up the hill through rough undergrowth, like a  torn and draggled cloud of blue smoke; the captain appeared not to have  observed him. Presently the captain spoke, slowly and with apparent  effort:    \"On the next ridge, did you say, sir? Are the guns near the house?\"    \"Ah, you have been over this road before. Directly at the house.\"    \"And it is--necessary--to engage them? The order is imperative?\"    His voice was husky and broken. He was visibly paler. The colonel was  astonished and mortified. He stole a glance at the commander. In that  set, immobile face was no sign; it was as hard as bronze. A moment later  the general rode away, followed by his staff and escort. The colonel,  humiliated and indignant, was about to order Captain Coulter in arrest,  when the latter spoke a few words in a low tone to his bugler, saluted,  and rode straight forward into the Notch, where, presently, at the  summit of the road, his field-glass at his eyes, he showed against the  sky, he and his horse, sharply defined and statuesque. The bugler had  dashed down the speed and disappeared behind a wood. Presently his bugle  was heard singing in the cedars, and in an incredibly short time a  single gun with its caisson, each drawn by six horses and manned by its  full complement of gunners, came bounding and banging up the grade in a  storm of dust, unlimbered under cover, and was run forward by hand to  the fatal crest among the dead horses. A gesture of the captain's arm,  some strangely agile movements of the men in loading, and almost before  the troops along the way had ceased to hear the rattle of the wheels, a  great white cloud sprang forward down the slope, and with a deafening  report the affair at Coulter's Notch had begun.    It is not intended to relate in detail the progress and incidents of  that ghastly contest--a contest without vicissitudes, its alternations  only different degrees of despair. Almost at the instant when Captain  Coulter's gun blew its challenging cloud twelve answering clouds rolled  upward from among the trees about the plantation house, a deep multiple  report roared back like a broken echo, and thenceforth to the end the  Federal cannoneers fought their hopeless battle in an atmosphere of  living iron whose thoughts were lightnings and whose deeds were death.    Unwilling to see the efforts which he could not aid and the slaughter  which he could not stay, the colonel ascended the ridge at a point a  quarter of a mile to the left, whence the Notch, itself invisible, but  pushing up successive masses of smoke, seemed the crater of a volcano in  thundering eruption. With his glass he watched the enemy's guns, noting  as he could the effects of Coulter's fire--if Coulter still lived to  direct it. He saw that the Federal gunners, ignoring those of the  enemy's pieces whose positions could be determined by their smoke only,  gave their whole attention to the one that maintained its place in the  open--the lawn in front of the house. Over and about that hardy piece  the shells exploded at intervals of a few seconds. Some exploded in the  house, as could be seen by thin ascensions of smoke from the breached  roof. Figures of prostrate men and horses were plainly visible.    \"If our fellows are doing so good work with a single gun,\" said the  colonel to an aide who happened to be nearest, \"they must be suffering  like the devil from twelve. Go down and present the commander of that  piece with my congratulations on the accuracy of his fire.\"    Turning to his adjutant-general he said, \"Did you observe Coulter's  damned reluctance to obey orders?\"    \"Yes, sir, I did.\"    \"Well, say nothing about it, please. I don't think the general will care  to make any accusations. He will probably have enough to do in  explaining his own connection with this uncommon way of amusing the  rear-guard of a retreating enemy.\"    A young officer approached from below, climbing breathless up the  acclivity. Almost before he had saluted, he gasped out:    \"Colonel, I am directed by Colonel Harmon to say that the enemy's guns  are within easy reach of our rifles, and most of them visible from  several points along the ridge.\"    The brigade commander looked at him without a trace of interest in his  expression. \"I know it,\" he said quietly.    The young adjutant was visibly embarrassed. \"Colonel Harmon would like  to have permission to silence those guns,\" he stammered.    \"So should I,\" the colonel said in the same tone. \"Present my  compliments to Colonel Harmon and say to him that the general's orders  for the infantry not to fire are still in force.\"    The adjutant saluted and retired. The colonel ground his heel into the  earth and turned to look again at the enemy's guns.    \"Colonel,\" said the adjutant-general, \"I don't know that I ought to say  anything, but there is something wrong in all this. Do you happen to  know that Captain Coulter is from the South?\"    \"No; _was_ he, indeed?\"    \"I heard that last summer the division which the general then commanded  was in the vicinity of Coulter's home--camped there for weeks, and--\"    \"Listen!\" said the colonel, interrupting with an upward gesture. \"Do you  hear _that_?\"    \"That\" was the silence of the Federal gun. The staff, the orderlies, the  lines of infantry behind the crest--all had \"heard,\" and were looking  curiously in the direction of the crater, whence no smoke now ascended  except desultory cloudlets from the enemy's shells. Then came the blare  of a bugle, a faint rattle of wheels; a minute later the sharp reports  recommenced with double activity. The demolished gun had been replaced  with a sound one.    \"Yes,\" said the adjutant-general, resuming his narrative, \"the general  made the acquaintance of Coulter's family. There was trouble--I don't  know the exact nature of it--something about Coulter's wife. She is a  red-hot Secessionist, as they all are, except Coulter himself, but she  is a good wife and high-bred lady. There was a complaint to army  headquarters. The general was transferred to this division. It is odd  that Coulter's battery should afterward have been assigned to it.\"    The colonel had risen from the rock upon which they had been sitting.  His eyes were blazing with a generous indignation.    \"See here, Morrison,\" said he, looking his gossiping staff officer  straight in the face, \"did you get that story from a gentleman or a  liar?\"    \"I don't want to say how I got it, Colonel, unless it is necessary\"--he  was blushing a trifle--\"but I'll stake my life upon its truth in the  main.\"    The colonel turned toward a small knot of officers some distance away.  \"Lieutenant Williams!\" he shouted.    One of the officers detached himself from the group and coming forward  saluted, saying: \"Pardon me, Colonel, I thought you had been informed.  Williams is dead down there by the gun. What can I do, sir?\"    Lieutenant Williams was the aide who had had the pleasure of conveying  to the officer in charge of the gun his brigade commander's  congratulations.    \"Go,\" said the colonel, \"and direct the withdrawal of that gun  instantly. No--I'll go myself.\"    He strode down the declivity toward the rear of the Notch at a  break-neck pace, over rocks and through brambles, followed by his little  retinue in tumultuous"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13341"],[0,"Hymns and Spiritual Songs (#12)"],[1," righteousness,  Faith and obedience to his word.    2 When weaker Christians we despise  We do the gospel mighty wrong,  For God the gracious and the wise  Receives the feeble with the strong.    3 Let pride and wrath be banish'd hence,  Meekness and love our souls pursue;  Nor shall our practice give offence  To saints, the Gentile or the Jew.      Hymn 1:127.  Christ's invitation to sinners; or, Humility and  pride, Matt. 11. 28 29 30.    1 \"Come hither, all ye weary souls,  \"Ye heavy laden sinners, come,  \"I'll give you rest from all your toils,  \"And raise you to my heavenly home.    2 \"They shall find rest that learn of me;  \"I'm of a meek and lowly mind;  \"But passion rages like the sea,  \"And pride is restless as the wind.    3 \"Blest is the man whose shoulders take  \"My yoke, and bear it with delight;  \"My yoke is easy to his neck,  \"My grace shall make the burden light.\"    4 Jesus, we come at thy command,  With faith and hope and humble zeal  Resign our spirits to thy hand,  To mould and guide us at thy will.      Hymn 1:128.  The Apostles' commission; or, The gospel attested by  miracles, Mark 16. 15 &c. Matt. 28. 18 &c.    1 \"Go preach my gospel, (saith the Lord,)  \"Bid the whole earth my grace receive;  \"He shall be sav'd that trusts my word,  \"He shall be damn'd that won't believe.    2 \"[I'll make your great commission known,  \"And ye shall prove my gospel true  \"By all the works that I have done,  \"By all the wonders ye shall do.    3 \"Go heal the sick, go raise the dead,  \"Go cast out devils in my name;  \"Nor let my prophets be afraid,  \"Tho' Greeks reproach, and Jews blaspheme.]    4 \"Teach all the nations my commands,  \"I'm with you till the world shall end;  \"All power is trusted to my hands,  \"I can destroy, and I defend.\"    He spake, and light shone round his head,  On a bright cloud to heaven he rode;  They to the farthest nations spread  The grace of their ascended God.      Hymn 1:129.  Submission and deliverance; or, Abraham offering  his son, Gen. 22. 6 &c.    1 Saints, at your Father's heavenly word  Give up your comforts to the Lord;  He shall restore what you resign,  Or grant you blessings more divine.    2 So Abraham with obedient hand,  Led forth his son at God's command,  The wood, the fire, the knife he took,  His arm prepar'd the dreadful stroke.    3 \"Abraham, forbear, (the angel cry'd)  \"Thy faith is known, thy love is try'd,  \"Thy son shall live, and in thy seed  \"Shall the whole earth be bless'd indeed.\"    4 Just in the last distressing hour  The Lord displays delivering power;  The mount of danger is the place  Where we shall see surprising grace.      Hymn 1:130.  Love and hatred, Phil. 2. 2. Eph. 4. 30 &c.    1 Now by the bowels of my God,  His sharp distress, his sore complaints,  By his last groans, his dying blood,  I charge my soul to love the saints.    2 Clamour, and wrath, and war be gone,  Envy and spite for ever cease,  Let bitter words no more be known  Amongst the saints, the sons of peace.    3 The Spirit, like a peaceful dove,  Flies from the realms of noise and strife;  Why should we vex and grieve his love,  Who seals our souls to heavenly life?    4 Tender and kind be all our thoughts,  Thro' all our lives let mercy run;  So God forgives our numerous faults  For the clear sake of Christ his Son.      Hymn 1:131.  The Pharisee and the Publican, Luke 18. 10 &c.    1 Behold how sinners disagree,  The Publican and Pharisee!  One doth his righteousness proclaim,  The other owns his guilt and shame.    2 This man at humble distance stands,  And cries for grace with lifted hands;  That boldly rises near the throne,  And talks of duties he has done.    3 The Lord their different language knows,  And different answers he bestows;  The humble soul with grace he crowns,  Whilst on the proud his anger frowns.    4 Dear Father, let me never be  Join'd with the boasting Pharisee;  I have no merits of my own,  But plead the sufferings of thy Son.      Hymn 1:132.  Holiness and grace, Titus 2. 10-13.    1 So let our lips and lives express  The holy gospel we profess,  So let our works and virtues shine  To prove the doctrine all divine.    2 Thus shall we best proclaim abroad  The honours of our saviour God;  When the salvation reigns within,  And grace subdues the power of sin.    3 Our flesh and sense must be deny'd,  Passion and envy, lust and pride;  While justice, temperance, truth and love  Our inward piety approve.    4 Religion bears our spirits up,  While we expect that blessed hope,  The bright appearance of the Lord,  And faith stands leaning on his word.      Hymn 1:133.  Love and charity, 1 Cor. 13. 2-7 13.    1 Let Pharisees of high esteem  Their faith and zeal declare,  All their religion is a dream  If love be wanting there.    2 Love suffers long with patient eye,  Nor is provok'd in haste;  She lets the present injury die,  And long forgets the past.    3 [Malice and rage, those fires of hell,  She quenches with her tongue;  Hopes, and believes, and thinks no ill,  Tho' she endure the wrong.]    4 [She nor desires nor seeks to know  The scandals of the time;  Nor looks with pride on those below,  Nor envies those that climb.]    5 She lays her own advantage by  To seek her neighbour's good;  So God's own Son came down to die,  And bought our lives with blood.    6 Love is the grace that keeps her power  In all the realms above;  There faith and hope are known no more,  But saints for ever love.      Hymn 1:134.  Religion vain without love, 1 Cor. 13. 1 2 3.    1 Had I the tongues of Greeks and Jews,  And nobler speech that angels use,  If love be absent, I am found  Like tinkling brass, an empty sound.    2 Were I inspir'd to preach and tell  All that is done in heaven and hell,  Or could my faith the world remove,  Still I am nothing without love.    3 Should I distribute all my store  To feed the bowels of the poor,  Or give my body to the flame  To gain a martyr's glorious name;    4 If love to God and love to men  Be absent, all my hopes are vain;  Nor tongues, nor gifts, nor fiery zeal  The work of love can e'er fulfil.      Hymn 1:135.  The love of Christ shed abroad in the heart,  Eph. 3. 16 &c.    1 Come, dearest Lord, descend and dwell  By faith and love in every breast;  Then shall we know, and taste, and feel  The joys that cannot be exprest.    2 Come, fill our hearts with inward strength,  Make our enlarged souls possess,  And learn the height, and breadth, and length  Of thine unmeasurable grace.    3 Now to the God whose power can do  More than our thoughts or wishes know,  Be everlasting honours done  By all the church, thro' Christ his Son.      Hymn 1:136.  Sincerity and hypocrisy; or, Formality in worship,  John 4. 24. Psalm 139. 23 24.    1 God is a spirit just and wise,  He sees our inmost mind;  In vain to heaven we raise our cries  And leave our souls behind.    2 Nothing but truth before his throne,  With honour can appear,  The painted hypocrites are known  Thro' the disguise they wear.    3 Their lifted eyes salute the skies,  Their bending knees the ground;  But God abhors the sacrifice  Where not the heart is found.    4 Lord, search my thoughts, and try my ways,  And make my soul sincere;  Then shall I stand before thy face,  And find acceptance there.      Hymn 1:137.  Salvation by grace in Christ, 2 Tim. 1. 9 10.    1 Now to the power of God supreme  Be everlasting honours given,  He saves from hell, (we bless his Name)  He calls our wandering feet to heaven.    2 Not for our duties or deserts,  But of his own abounding grace,  He works salvation in our hearts,  And forms a people for his praise.    3 'Twas his own purpose that begun  To rescue rebels doom'd to die;  He gave us grace in Christ his Son  Before he spread the starry sky.    4 Jesus the Lord appears at last,  And makes his Father's counsels known;  Declares the great transactions past,  And brings immortal blessings down.    5 He dies; and in that dreadful night  Did all the powers of hell destroy;  Rising he brought our heaven to light,  And took possession of the joy.      Hymn 1:138.  Saints in the hands of Christ, John 10. 28 29.    1 Firm as the earth thy gospel stands,  My Lord, my hope, my trust;  If I am found in Jesus' hands,  My soul can ne'er be lost.    2 His honour is engag'd to save  The meanest of his sheep,  All that his heavenly Father gave  His hands securely keep.    3 Nor death, nor hell shall e'er remove  His favourites from his breast;  In the dear bosom of his love  They must for ever rest.      Hymn 1:139.  Hope in the covenant; or, God's promise and truth  unchangeable, Heb. 6. 17 18 19.    1 How oft have sin and Satan strove  To rend my soul from thee, my God,  But everlasting is thy love,  And Jesus seals it with his blood.    2 The oath and promise of the Lord  Join to confirm the wondrous grace;  Eternal power performs the word,  And fills all heaven with endless praise.    3 Amidst temptations sharp and long  My soul to this dear refuge flies:  Hope is my anchor firm and strong,  While tempests blow, and billows rise.    4 The gospel bears my spirits up;  A faithful and unchanging God  Lays the foundation for my hope  In oaths, and promises, and blood.      Hymn 1:140.  A living and a dead faith. Collected from  several scriptures.    1 Mistaken souls! that dream of heaven,  And make their empty boast  Of inward joys, and sins forgiven,  While they are slaves to lust.    2 Vain are our fancies airy flights,  If faith be cold and dead,  None but a living power unites  To Christ the living head.    3 'Tis faith that changes all the heart;  'Tis faith that works by love;  That bids all sinful joys depart,  And lifts the thoughts above.    4 'Tis faith that conquers earth and hell  By a celestial power;  This is the grace that shall prevail  In the decisive hour.    5 [Faith must obey her Father's will  As well as trust his grace;  A pardoning God is jealous still  For his own holiness.    6 When from the curse he sets us free,"]]]
