Meanwhile, their existence as a separate and authentic  nationality in Turkey was officially recognized by the Porte in 1906.    The stages of the Macedonian question up to 1908 must at this point be  quite briefly enumerated. Russia and Austria-Hungary, the two 'most  interested powers', who as far back as the eighteenth century had divided  the Balkans into their respective spheres of interest, east and west, came  to an agreement in 1897 regarding the final settlement of affairs in  Turkey; but it never reached a conclusive stage and consequently was never  applied. The Macedonian chaos meanwhile grew steadily worse, and the  serious insurrections of 1902-3, followed by the customary reprisals,  thoroughly alarmed the powers. Hilmi Pasha had been appointed  Inspector-General of Macedonia in December 1902, but was not successful in  restoring order. In October 1903 the Emperor Nicholas II and the Emperor  of Austria, with their foreign ministers, met at Muerzsteg, in Styria, and  elaborated a more definite plan of reform known as the Muerzsteg programme,  the drastic terms of which had been largely inspired by Lord Lansdowne,  then British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; the principal feature  was the institution of an international gendarmerie, the whole of  Macedonia being divided up into five districts to be apportioned among the  several great powers. Owing to the procrastination of the Porte and to the  extreme complexity of the financial measures which had to be elaborated in  connexion with this scheme of reforms, the last of the negotiations was  not completed, nor the whole series ratified, until April 1907, though the  gendarmerie officers had arrived in Macedonia in February 1904.    At this point again it is necessary to recall the position in regard to  this question of the various nations concerned. Great Britain and France  had no territorial stake in Turkey proper, and did their utmost to secure  reform not only in the _vilayets_ of Macedonia, but also in the realm of  Ottoman finance. Italy's interest centred in Albania, whose eventual fate,  for geographical and strategic reasons, could not leave it indifferent.  Austria-Hungary's only care was by any means to prevent the aggrandizement  of the Serb nationality and of Serbia and Montenegro, so as to secure the  control, if not the possession, of the routes to Salonika, if necessary  over the prostrate bodies of those two countries which defiantly barred  Germanic progress towards the East. Russia was already fatally absorbed in  the Far Eastern adventure, and, moreover, had, ever since the war of 1878,  been losing influence at Constantinople, where before its word had been  law; the Treaty of Berlin had dealt a blow at Russian prestige, and Russia  had ever since that date been singularly badly served by its ambassadors  to the Porte, who were always either too old or too easy-going. Germany,  on the other hand, had been exceptionally fortunate or prudent in the  choice of its representatives. The general trend of German diplomacy in  Turkey was not grasped until very much later, a fact which redounds to the  credit of the German ambassadors at Constantinople. Ever since the  triumphal journey of William II to the Bosphorus in 1889, German  influence, under the able guidance of Baron von Radowitz, steadily  increased. This culminated in the regime of the late Baron Marschall von  Bieberstein, who was ambassador from 1897 to 1912. It was German policy to  flatter, support, and encourage Turkey in every possible way, to refrain  from taking part with the other powers in the invidious and perennial  occupation of pressing reforms on Abdul Hamid, and, above all, to give as  much pocket-money to Turkey and its extravagant ruler as they asked for.  Germany, for instance, refused to send officers or to have a district  assigned it in Macedonia in 1904, and declined to take part in the naval  demonstration off Mitylene in 1905. This attitude of Germany naturally  encouraged the Porte in its policy of delay and subterfuge, and Turkey  soon came to look on Germany as its only strong, sincere, and  disinterested friend in Europe. For the indefinite continuance of chaos  and bloodshed in Macedonia, after the other powers had really braced  themselves to the thankless task of putting the reforms into practice,  Germany alone was responsible.    The blow which King Ferdinand had inflicted on the prestige of the Young  Turks in October 1908, by proclaiming his independence, naturally lent  lustre to the Bulgarian cause in Macedonia. Serbia, baffled by the  simultaneous Austrian annexation of Bosnia and Hercegovina, and maddened  by the elevation of Bulgaria to the rank of a kingdom (its material  progress had hitherto been discounted in Serbian eyes by the fact that it  was a mere vassal principality), seemed about to be crushed by the two  iron pots jostling it on either side. Its international position was at  that time such that it could expect no help or encouragement from western  Europe, while the events of 1909 (cf. p. 144) showed that Russia was not  then in a position to render active assistance. Greece, also screaming  aloud for compensation, was told by its friends amongst the great powers  that if it made a noise it would get nothing, but that if it behaved like  a good child it might some day be given Krete. Meanwhile Russia, rudely  awakened by the events of 1908 to the real state of affairs in the Near  East, beginning to realize the growth of German influence at  Constantinople, and seeing the unmistakable resuscitation of  Austria-Hungary as a great power, made manifest by the annexation of  Bosnia and Hercegovina, temporarily reasserted its influence in Bulgaria.  From the moment when Baron Aehrenthal announced his chimerical scheme of  an Austrian railway through the _Sandjak_ of Novi Pazar in January 1908--  everybody knows that the railway already built through Serbia along the  Morava valley is the only commercially remunerative and strategically  practicable road from Berlin, Vienna, and Budapest to Salonika and  Constantinople--Russia realized that the days of the Muerzsteg programme  were over, that henceforward it was to be a struggle between Slav and  Teuton for the ownership of Constantinople and the dominion of the Near  East, and that something must be done to retrieve the position in the  Balkans which it was losing. After Baron Aehrenthal, in January 1909, had  mollified the Young Turks by an indemnity, and thus put an end to the  boycott, Russia in February of the same year liquidated the remains of the  old Turkish war indemnity of 1878 still due to itself by skilfully  arranging that Bulgaria should pay off its capitalized tribute, owed to  its ex-suzerain the Sultan, by very easy instalments to Russia instead.    The immediate effects of the Young Turk revolution amongst the Balkan  States, and the events, watched benevolently by Russia, which led to the  formation of the Balkan League, when it was joyfully realized that neither  the setting-up of parliamentary government, nor even the overthrow of  Abdul Hamid, implied the commencement of the millennium in Macedonia and  Thrace, have been described elsewhere (pp. 141, 148). King Ferdinand and  M. Venezelos are generally credited with the inception and realisation of  the League, though it was so secretly and skilfully concerted that it is  not yet possible correctly to apportion praise for the remarkable  achievement. Bulgaria is a very democratic country, but King Ferdinand,  owing to his sagacity, patience, and experience, and also thanks to his  influential dynastic connexions and propensity for travel, has always been  virtually his own foreign minister; in spite of the fact that he is a  large feudal Hungarian landlord, and has temperamental leanings towards  the Central European Empires, it is quite credible that King Ferdinand  devoted all his undeniable talents and great energy to the formation of  the League when he saw that the moment had come for Bulgaria to realize  its destiny at Turkey's expense, and that, if the other three Balkan  States could be induced to come to the same wise decision, it would be so  much the better for all of them. That Russia could do anything else than  whole-heartedly welcome the formation of the Balkan League was absolutely  impossible. Pan-Slavism had long since ceased to be the force it was, and  nobody in Russia dreamed of or desired the incorporation of any Balkan  territory in the Russian Empire. It is possible to control Constantinople  without possessing the Balkans, and Russia could only rejoice if a  Greco-Slavonic league should destroy the power of the Turks and thereby  make impossible the further advance of the Germanic powers eastward.    That Russia was ever in the least jealous of the military successes of the  league, which caused such gnashing of teeth in Berlin, Vienna, and  Budapest, is a mischievous fiction, the emptiness of which was evident to  any one who happened to be in Russia during the winter of 1912-13.    The years 1908 to 1912 were outwardly uneventful in Bulgaria, though a  great deal of quiet work was done in increasing the efficiency of the  army, and the material prosperity of the country showed no falling off.  Relations with the other Balkan States, especially with Serbia and  Montenegro, improved considerably, and there was ample room for such  improvement. This was outwardly marked by frequent visits paid to each  other by members of the several royal families of the three Slavonic  kingdoms of the Balkans. In May 1912 agreements for the eventual  delimitation of the provinces to be conquered from Turkey in the event of  war were signed between Bulgaria and Serbia, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11718"],[0,"The Camp Fire Girls at School; Or, The Wohelo Weavers (#12)"],[1,"nor time to spend in the company of her classmates. Gladys was  sorry for her because she always looked so sad and lonely, and, thinking  to give her one good time at least to treasure up in the memory of her  school days, invited her to the party. Emily accepted the invitation  gratefully.    The night of the party came at last. Migwan's dress was finished and  when she was finally arrayed in it she could compare favorably with the  wealthiest girl in the crowd. She even wore her mother's high-heeled  white satin wedding slippers with the little gold buckles, which fitted  her perfectly. She skipped away happily with a good-bye kiss to her  mother, who was tired out with her labors.    Gladys had relented at the last minute, and promised the Winnebagos that  if they would come a half hour early they might help her dress. That was  because the Winnebagos were closer kin to her than the rest of the  girls, and it would be a shame to have any one else see the dress first.  So they all gathered in Gladys's room, where the dress lay on the bed.  It was of light blue chiffon, exquisitely hand embroidered in  dainty-colored butterflies. \"Oh-h,\" they gasped, not daring to touch it.    \"There goes the bell!\" exclaimed Gladys, \"and I'm not even dressed. It's  some of the boys, I hear their voices,\" she said presently, after  listening for the sounds from below. \"Run down, will you, girls, and  entertain them until I come?\"    The Winnebagos departed to act the part of hostesses for their friend  and Gladys got hurriedly into her dress. Before she was ready to go down  she heard a large group of girls arriving, then another delegation of  boys. The orchestra had begun playing. Gladys's foot tapped the floor in  time to the music as she fastened up the dress. \"Just wait until they  see me dance the Butterfly Dance,\" she was thinking, with innocent  pride. She clasped the butterflies on her shoulders in place and with a  last survey of herself in the glass she set forth to greet her guests.  When she reached the head of the stairs the bell rang again and she  paused to see who it was. From the hall upstairs she could get a view of  the entire reception room without being seen herself. The last comer was  Emily Meeks, whom the maid was relieving of her wraps. She was all  alone, apparently at a loss what to do in company, and--dressed in a  white skirt and middy blouse! Gladys could see the coldly amused glances  some of the girls were bestowing on her, and the indifference with which  she was being treated by the boys. Why did she come dressed in such a  fashion? Gladys felt a little indignant at her. Then she reflected that  Emily probably had nothing else to wear, and, besides, it didn't make  any difference if one was dressed so plainly; there were enough brightly  dressed girls to make the brilliant scene that she loved.    But at the same time a thought struck her which made her decidedly  uncomfortable. It was, \"How would you like to be the odd one in the  crowd, and have all the others take notice of you because you didn't  match your surroundings? To face a battery of eyes that were amused or  scornful or pitying, according to the disposition of the owner of the  eyes? To feel lonesome in the midst of a crowd and wish you were miles  away?\" With one foot on the top step Gladys hesitated. In her mind there  rose a picture--the picture of her first night in camp when she had seen  a Camp Fire Ceremonial for the first time, when she felt lonesome and  far away and out of place. Again she saw the figures circling around the  fire and heard the words of their song:      \"Whose hand above this blaze is lifted    Shall be with magic touch engifted    To warm the hearts of lonely mortals    Who stand without their open portals.           *       *       *       *       *      \"Whoso shall stand    By this hearthstone    Flame fanned,    Shall never stand alone----\"    And later the flame had been given into her keeping, and she was  supposed to possess the magic touch to warm lonely hearts. She glanced  at herself in the long mirror in the hall, and was struck afresh by the  beauty of the dress. The shade of blue was just the right one to bring  out the tint of her eyes and the gold of her hair. From head to foot she  was a vision of loveliness such as delighted her dainty nature. One  interpretation of \"Seek Beauty\" was to always dress as beautifully and  becomingly as possible. Her mother was impatiently waiting for her to  come down and show herself. Then she looked over the railing again.  Emily Meeks had withdrawn from the groups of laughing girls and boys and  had crept into a corner by herself. The words of the Fire Song echoed  again in her ears:      \"_Whoso shall stand    By this hearthstone    Flame fanned,    Shall never stand alone!_\"    Gladys turned and fled to her room and resolutely began to unclasp the  fasteners of her butterfly dress. A ripple of astonishment went through  the rooms downstairs when she descended clad in a white linen skirt and  a middy blouse. All the girls had heard about the dress from New York  and were impatient to see it. Frances Jones and Caroline Davis stood  right at the foot of the stairs waiting for Gladys to come down so they  would not lose a detail of it, and Mrs. Evans was watching them to see  what effect the butterfly dress would have on them. When Gladys came  down dressed in a white skirt and middy she could not believe her eyes.  She hurried forward and asked in a low voice what was the matter with  the new dress.    \"Nothing, mother,\" said Gladys sweetly, with such a beautiful smile that  her mother dropped back in perplexity. Gladys advanced straight to Emily  Meeks and greeted her first of all, with a friendly cordiality that put  her at her ease at once. Emily, who had been dismayed when she found  herself so conspicuous among all the brightly gowned girls, was  reassured when she saw Gladys similarly clad, and never found out about  that quick change of costume that had taken place after her coming. The  other girls of course understood this fine little act of courtesy, and  shamefacedly began to include Emily in their conversation and  merrymaking.    So, if Mrs. Evans had counted on Gladys's dress that night to testify to  the soundness of the Evans fortune she was destined to be disappointed;  but on the other hand, if inborn courtesy is a sign of high birth and  breeding, then Gladys had proven herself to be a princess of the royal  blood.          CHAPTER VII.      HARD TIMES FOR POETS.    True to her word, Nyoda brought it about that Migwan might use the  typewriter which belonged to her landlady, and every evening after her  lessons were learned she worked diligently to master the keys. In a week  or so she managed to copy her story and sent it out again. It came back  as promptly as before, with the same kind of rejection slip. She sent it  to another magazine and began writing a new one. She worked feverishly,  and far beyond her strength. The room where the typewriter was was  directly below Nyoda's sitting room, and hearing the machine still  rattling after ten o'clock one night she calmly walked in and pulled  Migwan away from the keys. Migwan protested. \"It's past closing time,\"  said Nyoda firmly.    \"But I must finish this page,\" said Migwan.    \"You must nothing of the kind,\" said Nyoda, forcing Migwan into her  coat. \"'Hold on to Health' does not mean work yourself to death.  Hereafter you stop writing at nine o'clock or I will take the typewriter  away from you.\"    \"Oh, mayn't I stay until half past nine?\" asked Migwan coaxingly.    \"No, ma'm,\" said Nyoda emphatically. \"Nine o'clock is the time. That's a  bargain. As long as you keep your part of it you may use the typewriter,  but as soon as you step over the line I go back on my part. Now  remember, 'No checkee, no shirtee.'\" And Migwan perforce had to submit.    The stories came back as fast as they were sent out, and Migwan began to  have new sidelights on the charmed life supposedly led by authors and  authoresses. The struggle to get along without getting into debt was  becoming an acute one with the Gardiner family. Tom delivered papers  during the week and helped out in a grocery store on Saturday, and his  earnings helped slightly, but not much. Midwinter taxes on two houses  ate up more than two weeks' income. With almost superhuman ingenuity  Migwan apportioned their expenses so the money covered them. This she  had to do practically alone, for her mother was as helpless before a  column of figures as she would have been in a flood. Meat practically  disappeared from the table. The big bag of nuts which Tom had gathered  in the fall and which they had thought of only as a treat to pass around  in the evening now became a prominent part of the menu. Dried peas and  beans, boiled and made into soup, made their appearance on the table  several times a week. Cornbread was another standby. Long years  afterward Migwan would shudder at the sight of either bean soup or  cornbread. She nearly wore out the cook book looking for new ways in  which to serve potatoes, squash, turnips, onions and parsnips.    She soon discovered that most provisions could be bought a few cents  cheaper in the market than in the stores, so every Saturday afternoon  she made a trip downtown with a big market basket and bought the week's  supply of butter, eggs and vegetables. At first the necessity for  spending carfare cut into her profits, but she got around this in an  adroit way that promised well for her future ability to handle her  affairs to the best advantage. She tried a little publicity work to  swing things around to suit her purpose. She simply exalted the joys of  marketing until the other Winnebagos were crazy to do the family  marketing, too. As soon as Gladys caught the fever her object was  accomplished, for Gladys took all the girls to market in her father's  big car and brought all their"]]]
