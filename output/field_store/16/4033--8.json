Dire Economy: In the early days of the hospital, the Japanese issued a  few cartons of condensed milk that they had captured on Bataan for the  benefit of the seriously ill. Unfortunately, most of the recipients of  the extra milk proceeded to die in spite of the extra nourishment  taking the milk with them. We quickly learned a harsh but valuable  lesson: \"Do not give extra nourishment to dying patients!\"    From then on, the extra food went only to patients who possessed the  possibility of recovering plus the will to live.    Malaria: Fully 50% of the 2,400 patients had malaria. For many months  all we could do was to give one quinine tablet after each malaria  chill, hoping to make them more comfortable. But after the Japs  conquered the Dutch East Indies, we received 30,000 three grain  tablets of quinine. This allowed us to control most cases of malaria  and to cure some.    Occasionally we saw a few cases of cerebral malaria; most of these  died in spite of quinine therapy.    Multiple Diseases: Most patients had more than one disease, usually  multiple vitamin diseases. Many had lost from one third to one-half of  their body weight. Most everyone had either wet or dry beriberi, or a  few both.    Beriberi: Wet beriberi cases were bloated with edema usually beginning  in the feet and gradually progressing upward to the head. A patient  with edema of the feet and legs, after lying in bed all night,  frequently found that the edema had spread to his chest and face in  the morning.    After being up for several hours, the edema slowly returned to his  legs and feet. When the edema became extensive, the patient became  nearly helpless unable to get about.    Tropical ulcers often developed in swollen legs, and continued to weep  as long as the edema existed. If the edema had been caused by salt  intake, it could be, controlled by eliminating salt, but for the most  part salt was not a factor, because we rarely had any salt in our  diet.    Patients with dry beriberi were usually very thin. Their chief  complaint was lightning-like pains (neuralgia) in their legs and feet.  The only relief came from soaking their legs in buckets of cold water.  Many sat up all night trying to obtain some comfort.    On a rare occasion a dry beriberi patient would develop edema in his  feet and legs; strange as it may seem, the edema seemed to relieve the  pains of the dry beriberi.    Forty years later, some of the survivors still have leg pains in spite  of heavy vitamin therapy indicating permanent nerve damage.    Beriberi Heart Disease: Beriberi heart disease was seen frequently,  and often resulted in sudden death. Like the legs and abdomen, the  heart became enlarged with edema; the beat became irregular. As some  patients lay down, their heart would stop beating, especially if lying  on the left side.    If you could get to them in time to sit them up, or to massage their  heart, it was sometimes possible to get the heart started again.    Sudden death at night was a rather frequent occurrence. Many American  trained cardiologists still consider beriberi heart disease as a  reversible condition, but some ex-P.O.W.s still have the same  irregularities.    Pellagra: Pellagra was common, manifest by conjunctivitis, glossitis,  amblyopia, angular stomatitis, geographic tongues (often with deep  grooves and severe sensitivity), and scrotal dermatitis of varying  degrees including sloughing. There was increased pigmentation of the  skin sometimes patchy.    Xerophthalmia: Xerophthalmia and optic atrophy were seen occasionally  and often left permanent damage to vision, and sometimes complete  blindness.    Diphtheria: We had an epidemic of diphtheria some two hundred cases of  which 125 died before the Japs obtained a limited amount of antitoxin.  Most survivors had permanent residuals.    Infectious Hepatitis: We had several epidemics of infectious  hepatitis, which seemed to be self-limited. At times it was difficult  to differentiate it from malaria with jaundice following Atabrine  therapy.    In 1943, I had infectious hepatitis for about ten days and turned a  bright yellow accompanied by severe nausea and vomiting. Every time  someone would mention \"food,\" I would run to    the window and retch. It seemed this happened about every five minutes  during the day, as prisoners rarely talked about anything else. The  individual would apologize for mentioning food, but it would be only a  short time before it was the subject again.    Scurvy: There were several widespread epidemics of scurvy; we could  stop these quickly if and when we could persuade the Japs to get a  lime or two for each captive.    Diabetes Mellitus: When I entered camp, I was worried about diabetes  mellitus, because there was no insulin or other medicine available to  treat it. Ironically, starvation solved the problem.    The blood sugar never got up high enough to produce any symptoms.    Red Cross Packages: Just before Christmas in 1942, 1943 and    1944, the laps issued one or two Red Cross food packages, each of  which contained seven pounds of food. After the package in 1942, the  camp mortality fell miraculously from forty deaths daily to one or two  a month. December 15, 1942, was the first day in camp in which there  was not a single death.    Refeeding Gynecomastia: Three times during our thirty to thirty-six  months of incarceration at Cabanatuan and in Bilibid, following the  receipt of one, two or three Red Cross packages, making our diet  adequate for from one to six weeks, up to six hundred \"refeeding\" type  of breast swellings (gynecomastia) of various sizes appeared.    After the food in the packages was consumed by the captives, and the  diet returned to the starvation-type, the captives with the swollen  breasts noticed that the breasts were slowly and gradually returning  to normal size.    Again after liberation, when the diet returned to normal and remained  adequate, many hundreds of refeeding gynecomastia were seen, and  lasted from one to eight months, before disappearing. At times the  enlarged breasts were rather tender and even painful.    Dysentery Section of Hospital: Fenced off from the hospital was a  quarantined area containing about ten wards-called the Dysentery  Section-under the supervision of a separate staff of medical officers  and corpsmen.    There was a tremendous sanitary problem. Many of the patients were too  weak to leave their wards. Some \"passed out\" on their way to and from  the latrine. There was essentially no medicine for these debilitated  patients-unless they were lucky enough to    have a friend in Manila and knew how to contact him via the  Underground.    Zero Ward: In the Dysentery Section, there was a building that was  missed when the wards were numbered. Later, it was called \"Zero Ward\"  and served as a place to put the seriously ill, essentially dying  patients. It was an empty building with wooden floors, and usually  contained about thirty extremely ill patients naked lying on the  floor, frequently in their own vomitus and dysenteric stool.    Their chances of survival were just about zero. Flies walked casually  over their leathery skin; rarely did a patient arouse himself  sufficiently to threaten a fly. Most of the patients did not want to  be disturbed, typically responding \"Please leave me alone; I have  suffered enough! Just go away!\"    Exhausted and sick corpsmen moved slowly among the dying, trying to  keep them clean, and giving them food or medicine, when available.    Operating Room: In the early days of the hospital, the Japanese  permitted several medical officers to return to Bataan to retrieve an  operating table, minimal surgical equipment and a field X-ray unit  from the abandoned U.s. Army hospital.       Captives who had needed operations prior to the obtaining of the  surgical equipment were operated in Cabanatuan city by Japanese  doctors with 100% mortality.       Our American surgeons said, \"We can do better than that!\" The  American surgeons had no mortality.    A Camera: Ingenious Americans built a camera: they used X-ray film,  took pictures around the camp and developed the film in X-ray  solutions. They, of course, had to hide the camera and pictures when  Japs were in the area.    A Radio: After hearing no news during the early months of the camp  some other clever Americans decided to build a radio.    Several of the captives operated the electric generating and pumping  station. In the evening, when they suspected' the Japanese were  listening to their radios, they would run the voltage up high and  blowout the Jap radio sets. The following morning, the Japs would  bring their sets to the Americans and say: \"You fix!\"    After a quick examination, the Americans would exclaim, \"We must get  some new parts in Manila!\" In Manila, they would get extra parts and  eventually built a radio-in the bottom of a canteen; in the upper half  was water that they could pour out, if the Japs became  suspicious. Gradually, the captives became very knowledgeable  concerning war activities; Jap guards contacted the Americans for the  latest news.    Scuttlebutt (Rumors): The word \"scuttlebutt\" was an old Navy term  probably antedating the father of the U.S. Navy and his first ship,  the U.S.S. Alfred in 1775. The butt was a bucket or cask often placed  near the ship's ladder, where sailors congregated for a drink of fresh  water, and to exchange rumors.    When the sailors joined the soldiers and airmen on Bataan, scuttlebutt  soon followed, and usually referred to: Long convoys filled with food,  vast supplies and equipment and loaded with troops-replacements-that  President Roosevelt kept assuring us were \"On the way.\" The convoys  always proved to be phantom, or arrived safely in Ireland, Australia  or Africa, never in the Philippines.    In the Cabanatuan P.O.W. Camp, rumors were always rampant, especially  in the evening when daily activities"]]]
