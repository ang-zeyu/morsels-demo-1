Three times only in those three nights the  tolulu-bird was scared and stopped his song, and each time I awoke  with a start and found no ship and saw that he was only scared by the  dawn.  Those indescribable dawns upon the Yann came up like flames in  some land over the hills where a magician burns by secret means  enormous amethysts in a copper pot.  I used to watch them in wonder  while no bird sang--till all of a sudden the sun came over a hill and  every bird but one began to sing, and the tolulu-bird slept fast, till  out of an opening eye he saw the stars.    I would have waited three more days, but on the third day I had gone  in my loneliness to see the very spot where first I met _Bird of the  River_ at her anchorage with her bearded captain sitting on the deck.  And as I looked at the black mud of the harbour and pictured in my  mind that band of sailors whom I had not seen for two years, I saw an  old hulk peeping from the mud.  The lapse of centuries seemed partly  to have rotted and partly to have buried in the mud all but the prow  of the boat and on the prow I faintly saw a name.  I read it slowly--  it was _Bird of the River._ And then I knew that, while in Ireland and  London two years had barely passed over my head, ages had gone over  the region of Yann and wrecked and rotted that once familiar ship, and  buried years ago the bones of the youngest of my friends, who so often  sang to me of Durl and Duz or told the dragon-legends of Belzoond.  For beyond the world we know there roars a hurricane of centuries  whose echo only troubles--though sorely--our fields; while elsewhere  there is calm. I stayed a moment by that battered hulk and said a  prayer for whatever may be immortal of those who were wont to sail it  down the Yann, and I prayed for them to the gods to whom they loved to  pray, to the little lesser gods that bless Belzoond.  Then leaving the  hut that I built to those ravenous years I turned my back to the Yann  and entering the forest at evening just as its orchids were opening  their petals to perfume the night came out of it in the morning, and  passed that day along the amethyst gulf by the gap in the blue-grey  mountains.  I wondered if Singanee, that mighty elephant-hunter, had  returned again with his spear to his lofty ivory palace or if his doom  had been one with that of Perdondaris.  I saw a merchant at a small  back door selling new sapphires as I passed the palace, then I went on  and came as twilight fell to those small cottages where the elfin  mountains are in sight of the fields we know.  And I went to the old  witch that I had seen before and she sat in her parlour with a red  shawl round her shoulders still knitting the golden cloak, and faintly  through one of her windows the elfin mountains shone and I saw again  through another the fields we know.    \"Tell me something,\" I said, \"of this strange land!\"    \"How much do you know?\" she said.  \"Do you know that dreams are  illusion?\"    \"Of course I do,\" I said.  \"Every one knows that.\"    \"Oh no they don't,\" she said, \"the mad don't know it.\"    \"That is true,\" I said.    \"And do you know,\" she said, \"that Life is illusion?\"    \"Of course it is not,\" I said.  \"Life is real, Life is earnest----.\"    At that the witch and her cat (who had not moved from her old place by  the hearth) burst into laughter.  I stayed some time, for there was  much that I wished to ask, but when I saw that the laughter would not  stop I turned and went away.          THE AVENGER OF PERDONDARIS    I was rowing on the Thames not many days after my return from the Yann  and drifting eastwards with the fall of the tide away from Westminster  Bridge, near which I had hired my boat.  All kinds of things were on  the water with me--sticks drifting, and huge boats--and I was  watching, so absorbed the traffic of that great river that I did not  notice I had come to the City until I looked up and saw that part of  the Embankment that is nearest to Go-by Street. And then I suddenly  wondered what befell Singanee, for there was a stillness about his  ivory palace when I passed it by, which made me think that he had not  then returned.  And though I had seen him go forth with his terrific  spear, and mighty elephant-hunter though he was, yet his was a fearful  quest for I knew that it was none other than to avenge Perdondaris by  slaying that monster with the single tusk who had overthrown it  suddenly in a day. So I tied up my boat as soon as I came to some  steps, and landed and left the Embankment, and about the third street  I came to I began to look for the opening of Go-by Street; it is very  narrow, you hardly notice it at first, but there it was, and soon I  was in the old man's shop.  But a young man leaned over the counter.  He had no information to give me about the old man--he was sufficient  in himself.  As to the little old door in the back of the shop, \"We  know nothing about that, sir.\"  So I had to talk to him and humour  him.  He had for sale on the counter an instrument for picking up a  lump of sugar in a new way.  He was pleased when I looked at it and he  began to praise it.  I asked him what was the use of it, and he said  that it was of no use but that it had only been invented a week ago  and was quite new and was made of real silver and was being very much  bought.  But all the while I was straying towards the back of the  shop.  When I enquired about the idols there he said that they were  some of the season's novelties and were a choice selection of mascots;  and while I made a pretence of selecting one I suddenly saw the  wonderful old door.  I was through it at once and the young  shop-keeper after me.  No one was more surprised than he when he saw  the street of grass and the purple flowers on it; he ran across in his  frock-coat on to the opposite pavement and only just stopped in time,  for the world ended there. Looking downward over the pavement's edge  he saw, instead of accustomed kitchen-windows, white clouds and a  wide, blue sky.  I led him to the old back door of the shop, looking  pale and in need of air, and pushed him lightly and he went limply  through, for I thought the air was better for him on the side of the  street that he knew. As soon as the door was shut on that astonished  man I turned to the right and went along the street till I saw the  gardens and the cottages, and a little red patch moving in a garden,  which I knew to be the old witch wearing her shawl.    \"Come for a change of illusion again?\" she said.    \"I have come from London,\" I said.  \"And I want to see Singanee.  I  want to go to his ivory palace over the elfin mountains where the  amethyst precipice is.\"    \"Nothing like changing your illusions,\" she said, \"or you grow tired.  London's a fine place but one wants to see the elfin mountains  sometimes.\"    \"Then you know London?\" I said.    \"Of course I do,\" she said.  \"I can dream as well as you.  You are not  the only person that can imagine London.\"  Men were toiling dreadfully  in her garden; it was in the heat of the day and they were digging  with spades; she suddenly turned from me to beat one of them over the  back with a long black stick that she carried.  \"Even my poets go to  London sometimes,\" she said to me.    \"Why did you beat that man?\" I said.    \"To make him work,\" she answered.    \"But he is tired,\" I said.    \"Of course he is,\" said she.    And I looked and saw that the earth was difficult and dry and that  every spadeful that the tired men lifted was full of pearls; but some  men sat quite still and watched the butterflies that flitted about the  garden and the old witch did not beat them with her stick.  And when I  asked her who the diggers were she said, \"These are my poets, they are  digging for pearls.\"  And when I asked her what so many pearls were  for she said to me: \"To feed the pigs of course.\"    \"But do the pigs like pearls?\" I said to her.    \"Of course they don't,\" she said.  And I would have pressed the matter  further but the old black cat had come out of the cottage and was  looking at me whimsically and saying nothing so that I knew I was  asking silly questions.  And I asked instead why some of the poets  were idle and were watching butterflies without being beaten.  And she  said: \"The butterflies know where the pearls are hidden and they are  waiting for one to alight above the buried treasure.  They cannot dig  until they know where to dig.\"  And all of a sudden a faun came out of  a rhododendron forest and began to dance upon a disk of bronze in  which a fountain was set; and the sound of his two hooves dancing on  the bronze was beautiful as bells.    \"Tea-bell,\" said the witch; and all the poets threw down their spades  and followed her into the house, and I followed them; but the witch  and all of us followed the black cat, who arched his back and lifted  his tail and walked along the garden-path of blue enamelled tiles and  through the black-thatched porch and the open, oaken door and into a  little room where tea was ready.  And in the garden the flowers began  to sing and the fountain tinkled on the disk of bronze.  And I learned  that the fountain came from an otherwise unknown sea, and sometimes it  threw gilded fragments up from the wrecks of unheard-of galleons,  foundered in storms of some sea that was nowhere in the world; or  battered to bits in wars waged with we know not whom.  Some said that  it was salt because of the sea and others that it was salt with  mariners' tears.  And some of the poets took large flowers out of  vases and threw their petals all about the room, and others talked two  at a time and other sang.  \"Why they are only children after all,\" I  said.    \"Only children!\" repeated the old witch who was pouring out cowslip  wine.    _\"Only_ children,\" said the old black cat.  And every one laughed at  me.    \"I sincerely apologize,\" I said.  \"I did not mean"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11464"],[0,"Cuba, Old and New (#12)"],[1,"the strangers.  Many horsemen appeared in the procession, and the central promenade was  thronged with those who walked, either because they preferred to or because  they could not afford to ride around and around. In the Parque Central were  other walkers, chatting groups, and lookers-on. Some days the band played.  Then the Prado was extended to the water-front; the _glorieta_ was erected;  and that became another centre for chatterers and watchers. The building of  the Malecon extended the range of the driveway. This afternoon function is  an old established institution and a good one. It may not compare favorably  with the drive in some of our parks in this country, but it is the best  substitute possible in Havana. Indulgence in ices, cooling drinks,  chocolate, or other refections, during this daily ceremony, is fairly  common but by no means a general practice. The afternoon tea habit has not  yet seized upon Havana. The ices are almost invariably excellent. Some of  them are prepared from native fruit flavors that are quite unknown here.  The _guanabana_ ice is particularly to be recommended. All such matters are  quite individual, but a decoction called _chocolate Espanol_ is also to be  recommended. It is served hot, too thick to drink, and is to be taken with  a spoon, to the accompaniment of cake. It is highly nourishing as well as  palatable. There is a wide variety of \"soft drinks,\" made with oranges,  limes, or other fruits, and the _orchata_, made from almonds, and the  products of American soda fountains, but there is little use of the  high-ball or the cocktail except by Americans.    [Illustration: STREET AND CHURCH OF THE ANGELS _Havana_]    The Cubans are an exceedingly temperate people. Wine is used by all  classes, and _aguadiente_, the native rum, is consumed in considerable  quantity, but the Cuban rarely drinks to excess. I recall an experience  during the earlier years. I was asked to write a series of articles on the  use of intoxicants in the island, for a temperance publication in this  country. My first article so offended the publishers that they declined  to print it, and cancelled the order for the rest of the series. It was  perhaps somewhat improper, but in that article I summed up the situation  by stating that \"the temperance question in Cuba is only a question of how  soon we succeed in converting them into a nation of drunkards.\" Beer is  used, both imported and of local manufacture. Gin, brandy, and anisette,  cordials and liqueurs are all used to some but moderate extent, but  intoxication is quite rare. One fluid extract I particularly recommend,  that is the milk of the cocoanut, the green nut. Much, however, depends  upon the cocoanut. Properly ripened, the \"milk\" is delicious, cooling and  wholesome, more so perhaps on a country journey than in the city. The nut  not fully ripened gives the milk, or what is locally called the \"water,\" an  unpleasant, woody taste. I have experimented with it in different parts of  the world, in the Philippines, Ceylon, and elsewhere, and have found it  wholesome and refreshing in all places.    The houses in the new Havana are, on the whole, vastly more cheerful  than are the dwellings in the old city. They are of the same general  architectural type, but because of the wider streets, more air and sunshine  gets into them. Some of the best and most costly are along the Prado.  A Cuban house interior generally impresses an American as lacking in  home-like quality. Some of the best are richly adorned, but there is a  certain bareness and an absence of color. As is usual with customs unlike  our own, and which we are therefore prone to regard as inferior to ours,  there are excellent reasons for Cuban interior decoration, or rather the  lack of it. A little experience, or even a little reflection, shows clearly  the impossibility of anything resembling American house decoration in  such a climate as that of Cuba. Our warm colors, hangings, upholstered  furniture, rugs, and much else that we regard as essential in northern  latitudes, would be utterly unendurable in Cuba. There, the marble or tiled  floors, the cool tones of wall and ceiling, and the furniture of wood and  cane, are not only altogether fitting but as well altogether necessary. Our  glass windows would only serve to increase heat and shut out air. As some  barrier is necessary to keep passers, even Americans, from intrusive  entrance by the windows whose bottoms are at floor level, the system of  iron bars or elaborate grille work is adopted. Few Americans see much, if  anything, of Cuban home life except as they see it through these barriers  as they pass. It is not the custom of the country to invite promiscuous or  casual acquaintances to call. It is even less the custom there than it is  with us. A book about Cuba, published a few years ago, gives a somewhat  extended account of what is called \"home life,\" but it is the home life of  workmen and people who do laundry work to eke out a meagre living. It is  not even the life of fairly paid artisans, or of people of modest but  comfortable income. It is no more a proper description of the domestic life  of the island than would be a presentation of the life in the palaces of  the wealthy. Such attempts at description are almost invariably a mistake,  conveying, whether from purpose or from indifference to truth, a false  impression. Domestic economy and household management vary in Cuba as  they vary in the United States, in France, England, Japan, or Mexico. The  selection of an individual home, or of several, as a basis for description,  in Cuba or anywhere else, can only result in a picture badly out of drawing  and quite misleading.    There are Cuban homes, as there are American homes, that are slatternly and  badly managed, and there are Cuban homes that are as spick and span and as  orderly in their administration as any home in this country. Their customs,  as are ours, are the result of environment and tradition. To some of us, a  rectangle of six or eight rocking-chairs, placed in the centre of a room,  in which family and visitors sit and rock while they talk, may seem  curious, but it is a custom that we may not criticize either with fairness  or common decency. The same may be said of the not uncommon custom of using  a part of the street floor of the house as a stable. It is an old custom,  brought from Spain. But I have wandered from description to incident. I  have no intention to attempt a description of Cuban home life, beyond  saying that I have been a guest in costly homes in the city and in the  little palm-leaf \"shacks\" of peasants, and have invariably found in both,  and in the homes of intermediate classes, only cordial hospitality and  gracious courtesy. Those who have found anything different have carried it  with them in their own attitude toward their hosts. Many of us, probably  most of us, in the United States, make a sort of fetich of the privacy of  what we call our home life. We are encased in walls of wood or masonry,  with blinds, curtains, or shades at our windows. It might be supposed that  we wanted to hide, that there was something of which to be ashamed. It  might at least be so interpreted by one unfamiliar with our ways. It is  only, like the open domestic life in Cuba, a custom, a habit of long  standing. Certainly, much of the domestic life of Cuba is open. The  mistress of the house chides a servant, rebukes or comforts a child, sits  with her embroidery, chaffers with an itinerant merchant or with the  clerk from a store, all in plain sight and hearing of the passer-by. What  everyone does, no one notices. The customs of any country are curious only  to those from other countries where customs are different. Our ways of life  are quite as curious to others as are their ways to us. We are quite  blind to that fact chiefly because of an absurd conviction of the  immense superiority of our ways. We do not stop to consider reasons for  differences. A cup of coffee on an American breakfast table usually  consists of about four parts coffee and one part milk or cream. Most Cubans  usually reverse these percentages. There is a good reason for it. In  our climate, we do not need the large open doors and windows, the high  ceilings, and the full and free ventilation that make life endurable  in tropical and sub-tropical countries. Their system here would be as  impossible as would be our system there. Houses in Cuba like those of an  American city or town would make life a miserable burden. The publicity, or  semi-publicity, of Cuban home life is a necessary result of conditions.  It is, naturally, more in evidence in the city proper, where the houses,  abutting immediately on the street, as do most of our city houses, are  built, as ours are, in solid rows. We avoid a good deal of publicity by  piling our homes on top of each other, and by elevators and stair-climbing.    The location of a residence in Havana gives no special idea of the wealth  or the social standing of those who occupy it. Not a few well-to-do people  still live in the old city, where the streets are narrow and where business  is trying to crowd out everything except itself. The home in that quarter  may be in a block in which a number of buildings are residences, or it  may stand with a warehouse on one side and a workshop on the other. A few  people, of unquestionable social position still live in buildings in which  the street floor is a store or an office. There is nothing curious about  this. In many American cities, old families have clung to old homes, and  not a few new families have, from one reason or another, occupied similar  quarters. Such a residence may not conform to modern social ideas and  standards, but there are Americans in this country, as well as Cubans and  Spaniards in Havana, who can afford to ignore those standards. The same is  true of many who live in the newer city, outside the "]]]
