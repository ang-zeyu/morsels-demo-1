In every case we went to sixty feet long before they could have seen  our \"stick.\" [2] Weissman is evidently as cautious in this matter as he  is hardy in others; the more I see of him the more I like him; he is a  man of breeding, and it is of value to serve in this boat.    [Footnote 1: Probably \"P\" boats.--ETIENNE.]    [Footnote 2: Periscope.--ETIENNE.]    As I write we are on the surface about ten miles east of the Isle of  Wight, still steering down channel. To-night at midnight we report our  position to Zeebrugge, up till now we have maintained wireless silence  for fear of the British and French directional stations picking up our  signals and fixing our position.    After supper this evening Von Weissman explained to me the general plan  of our operations for the next eight days. Our cruising billet is about  150 miles south-west of the Scillys, at the focal point where trade for  Liverpool and Bristol and the up-channel trade diverges. Von Weissman  says that this is a plum billet and we should do well.    I feel this is going to be better than those piffling little  mine-laying trips, and though we shall be away ten days, it will  qualify me for four days' leave in Belgium.           *       *       *       *       *    There was nearly an awkward moment last night, or, rather, there was an  awkward moment, and nearly an awkward accident. I relieved the  navigator at midnight (the pilot is an unassuming individual called  Siegel) and took on the middle watch. It was blowing about force 4 from  the south-west, and a nasty short, lumpy sea was running which caught  us just on the port bow. About once every ten seconds she missed her  step with the waves and, dipping her nose into it, shovelled up tons of  water, which, as the bow lifted, raced aft and, breaking against the  gun, flung itself in clouds of spray against the bridge. In a very few  minutes every exposed portion of me was streaming with water.    At about 2 a.m. I had turned my back to the sea for a moment, and my  thoughts were for an instant in Bruges, when, on facing forward once  again I saw a sight which effectually brought me back to earth.    This was the spectacle of two black shapes, evidently steamers, one on  either bow, distant, I should estimate, 600 or 700 metres. I had to  make a quick decision, and I decided that to fire a torpedo in that sea  with any hope of a hit, especially with the boat on surface, was  useless; furthermore, that at any moment either of the steamers might  sight us from their high bridge and turn and ram.    These thoughts were the work of an instant, and I at once rang the  diving bell, and, pushing the look-out before me, in five seconds I was  in the conning tower and had the hatch down. I at once proceeded down  into the boat, and the first thing that struck my eye was the diving  gauge with the needle practically stationary at two metres.    The boat was not going down properly! and for an instant I was rudely  shaken, until a cool voice from the wardroom remarked, \"Helm hard  a-port,\" an order that was instantly obeyed, and as she began to turn  the moving needle on the depth gauge began its journey round the dial.  It was the Captain who had spoken. As soon as he heard the diving alarm  he was out of his bunk, and a glance at the gauge he has fitted in the  wardroom told him we were not sinking rapidly. In an instant he had put  his finger on the trouble, which was that we were almost head on to the  sea, with the result that he had given the order as stated above,  which, bringing us beam on to the sea, had caused her to dive with  ease. He is efficiency itself!    As I explained to him what had happened, the noise of propellers at  varying distances from us overhead led him to state his belief that we  had run into a convoy homeward bound to Southampton from the Atlantic.    He approved of my actions in every particular, save only in my omission  to bring the boat away from the sea as I began to dive.    This morning we are beginning to get the full force of what is  evidently going to be a south-westerly gale of some violence. The seas  are getting larger as we debouch into the Atlantic. This looks bad for  business.           *       *       *       *       *    At the moment we are practically hove to on the surface, with the port  engine just jogging to keep her head on to sea and the starboard  ticking round to give her a long, slow charge of 200 amps.    The wind is force 7-8 and a very big sea is running which makes it  entirely impossible to open the conning tower hatch; the engine is  getting its air through the special mushroom ventilator, which is  apparently not designed to supply both the boat's requirements and  those of the engine; the whole ventilator gets covered with sea every  now and then, during which period until the baffle drains get the water  away no air can get in, so the engine has a good suck at the air in the  boat, the result of all this being a slight vacuum in the boat. It is a  very unpleasant sensation, and made me very sick. This is really a form  of sickness due to the rarefied air.    I had a great surprise when I looked at the barograph this morning as  the needle had gone right off the paper at the bottom, and at first  glance I thought we had struck a tropical depression of the first  magnitude, which, flouting all the laws of meteorology, had somehow  found its way to the English Channel; but the engineer explained to me  that, as I have already stated, the low atmospheric pressure in the  boat was due to the conning-tower hatch being shut down.    [Illustration: \"As the dim lights on the mole disappeared, the  ceaseless fountain of starshells mingling with the flashing of guns,  rose inland on our port beam.\"]    [Illustration: \"We hit her aft for the second time.\"]    I have discovered that Von Weissman is a martyr to sea-sickness--all  day he has been lying down as white as a sheet and subsisting on milk  tablets and sips of brandy; yet such is the man's inflexibility of will  that he forces himself to make a tour of inspection right round the  boat every six hours, night and day. It is this will to conquer which  has made Germans unconquerable, though \"Come the four corners of the  world in arms\" against us, as the great poet says.    We are, of course, keeping watch from inside the conning tower; it is,  at all events, dry, but as to seeing anything one might as well be  looking out through a small glass window from inside a breakwater! To  bed till 4 a.m.           *       *       *       *       *    A most unprofitable day. I grudge every day away from Zoe on which we  do nothing. This morning about noon the gale blew itself out, but a  heavy confused sea continued to run.    At 2 p.m. we saw a most tantalizing spectacle. A big tank steamer,  fully 600 feet long and of probably 17,000 tons burthen hove in sight,  escorted by two destroyers. To attack with the gun was impossible, as  we could only keep the conning tower open when stern to sea, and in any  case the two destroyers prevented any surface work. We tried to get in  for an attack, but we had not seen her in time, and the best we could  do was to get within 3,000 yards, at which range it would have been  absurd to have wasted a torpedo, the chances of hitting being 100 to 1  against, even if the torpedo had run properly in the sea that was on.    I had a good look at her through the foremost periscope in between the  waves, and it maddened me to see all that oil, doubtless from Tampico  for the Grand Fleet, going safely by. The destroyers were having a bad  time of it, crashing into the sea like porpoises, their funnels white  with salt, and their bridges enveloped in sheets of water and spray.  They little thought that, barely a mile away, amidst the tumbling,  crested waves a German eye was watching them!    There is no doubt these damned British have pluck, for it was the last  sort of weather in which one would have expected to find destroyers at  sea, and yet I suppose they do this throughout the winter.    After all, one would expect them to be tough fellows--they are of  Teutonic stock--though by their bearing one might imagine that the  Creator made an Englishman and then Adam.    Let's hope we get some decent weather to-morrow. I have just been  refreshing my memory by reading of what I wrote in the book, concerning  the day in the forest with the adorable girl. There is an exquisite  pleasure in transporting the mind into such memories of the past when  the body is in such surroundings as the present, if only I could will  myself to dream of her!           *       *       *       *       *    A fine day in every sense of the word. The weather has been and remains  excellent, and I have been present at my first sinking. It was absurdly  commonplace. At 10 a.m. this morning a column of smoke crept upwards  from the southern horizon.    Von Weissman steered towards it on the surface until two masts and the  top of a funnel appeared. We dived and proceeded slowly under water on  a southerly course.    Half an hour passed and Von Weissman brought the boat up to periscope  depth and had a look. He called to me to come and see, an invitation I  accepted with alacrity.    With natural excitement I looked through the periscope and there she  was, unconsciously ambling to her doom like a fat sheep.    She was a steamer (British) of about 4,000 tons, slugging home at a  steady ten knots, but she was destined to come to her last mooring  place ahead of schedule time!    We dipped our periscope and I went forward to the tubes. Five minutes  elapsed and the order instrument bell rang, the pointer flicking to  \"Stand by.\" I personally removed the firing gear safety pin and put the  repeat to \"Ready.\" A breathless pause, then a slight shake and  destruction was on its way, whilst I realized by the angle of the boat  that Weissman was taking us down a few metres.    That shows "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7951"],[0,"Glimpses of Bengal (#11)"],[1,"the flower and its scent. She has, therefore, no  doubts or hesitations.    But the character of man has still many hollows and protuberances; each of  the varied circumstances and forces which have contributed to his making  has left its mark upon him. That is why the features of one will display  an indefinite spread of forehead, of another an irresponsible prominence  of nose, of a third an unaccountable hardness about the jaws. Had man but  the benefit of continuity and uniformity of purpose, Nature must have  succeeded in elaborating a definite mould for him, enabling him to  function simply and naturally, without such strenuous effort. He would not  have so complicated a code of behaviour; and he would be less liable to  deviate from the normal when disturbed by outside influences.    Woman was cast in the mould of mother. Man has no such primal design to go  by, and that is why he has been unable to rise to an equal perfection of  beauty.          PATISAR,    _19th February 1894._      We have two elephants which come to graze on this bank of the river. They  greatly interest me. They give the ground a few taps with one foot, and  then taking hold of the grass with the end of their trunks wrench off an  enormous piece of turf, roots, soil, and all. This they go on swinging  till all the earth leaves the roots; they then put it into their mouths  and eat it up.    Sometimes the whim takes them to draw up the dust into their trunks, and  then with a snort they squirt it all over their bodies; this is their  elephantine toilet.    I love to look on these overgrown beasts, with their vast bodies, their  immense strength, their ungainly proportions, their docile harmlessness.  Their very size and clumsiness make me feel a kind of tenderness for  them--their unwieldy bulk has something infantile about it. Moreover, they  have large hearts. When they get wild they are furious, but when they calm  down they are peace itself.    The uncouthness which goes with bigness does not repel, it rather  attracts.          PATISAR,    _27th February 1894._      The sky is every now and then overcast and again clears up. Sudden little  puffs of wind make the boat lazily creak and groan in all its seams. Thus  the day wears on.    It is now past one o'clock. Steeped in this countryside noonday, with its  different sounds--the quacking of ducks, the swirl of passing boats,  bathers splashing the clothes they wash, the distant shouts from drovers  taking cattle across the ford,--it is difficult even to imagine the  chair-and-table, monotonously dismal routine-life of Calcutta.    Calcutta is as ponderously proper as a Government office. Each of its days  comes forth, like coin from a mint, clear-cut and glittering. Ah! those  dreary, deadly days, so precisely equal in weight, so decently  respectable!    Here I am quit of the demands of my circle, and do not feel like a wound  up machine. Each day is my own. And with leisure and my thoughts I walk  the fields, unfettered by bounds of space or time. The evening gradually  deepens over earth and sky and water, as with bowed head I stroll along.          PATISAR,    _22nd March 1894._      As I was sitting at the window of the boat, looking out on the river, I  saw, all of a sudden, an odd-looking bird making its way through the water  to the opposite bank, followed by a great commotion. I found it was a  domestic fowl which had managed to escape impending doom in the galley by  jumping overboard and was now trying frantically to win across. It had  almost gained the bank when the clutches of its relentless pursuers closed  on it, and it was brought back in triumph, gripped by the neck. I told the  cook I would not have any meat for dinner.    I really must give up animal food. We manage to swallow flesh only because  we do not think of the cruel and sinful thing we do. There are many crimes  which are the creation of man himself, the wrongfulness of which is put  down to their divergence from habit, custom, or tradition. But cruelty is  not of these. It is a fundamental sin, and admits of no argument or nice  distinctions. If only we do not allow our heart to grow callous, its  protest against cruelty is always clearly heard; and yet we go on  perpetrating cruelties easily, merrily, all of us--in fact, any one who  does not join in is dubbed a crank.    How artificial is our apprehension of sin! I feel that the highest  commandment is that of sympathy for all sentient beings. Love is the  foundation of all religion. The other day I read in one of the English  papers that 50,000 pounds of animal carcasses had been sent to some army  station in Africa, but the meat being found to have gone bad on arrival,  the consignment was returned and was eventually auctioned off for a few  pounds at Portsmouth. What a shocking waste of life! What callousness to  its true worth! How many living creatures are sacrificed only to grace the  dishes at a dinner-party, a large proportion of which will leave the table  untouched!    So long as we are unconscious of our cruelty we may not be to blame. But  if, after our pity is aroused, we persist in throttling our feelings  simply in order to join others in their preying upon life, we insult all  that is good in us. I have decided to try a vegetarian diet.          PATISAR,    _28th March 1894._      It is getting rather warm here, but I do not mind the heat of the sun  much. The heated wind whistles on its way, now and then pauses in a whirl,  then dances away twirling its skirt of dust and sand and dry leaves and  twigs.    This morning, however, it was quite cold--almost like a cold-weather  morning; in fact, I did not feel over-enthusiastic for my bath. It is so  difficult to account for what veritably happens in this big thing called  Nature. Some obscure cause turns up in some unknown corner, and all of a  sudden things look completely different.    The mind of man works in just the same mysterious fashion as outside  Nature--so it struck me yesterday. A wondrous alchemy is being wrought in  artery, vein, and nerve, in brain and marrow. The blood-stream rushes on,  the nerve--strings vibrate, the heart-muscle rises and falls, and the  seasons in man's being change from one to another. What kind of breezes  will blow next, when and from what quarter--of that we know nothing.    One day I am sure I shall get along splendidly; I feel strong enough to  leap over all the obstructing sorrows and trials of the world; and, as if  I had a printed programme for the rest of my life tucked safely away in my  pocket, I am at ease. The next day there is a nasty wind, sprung up from  some unknown _inferno_, the aspect of the sky is threatening, and I  begin to doubt whether I shall ever weather the storm. Merely because  something has gone wrong in some blood-vessel or nerve-fibre, all my  strength and intelligence seem to fail me.    This mystery within frightens me. It makes me diffident about talking of  what I shall or shall not do. Why was this tacked on to me--this immense  mystery which I can neither understand nor control? I know not where it  may lead me or I lead it. I cannot see what is happening, nor am I  consulted about what is going to happen, and yet I have to keep up an  appearance of mastery and pretend to be the doer....    I feel like a living pianoforte with a vast complication of machinery and  wires inside, but with no means of telling who the player is, and with  only a guess as to why the player plays at all. I can only know what is  being played, whether the mode is merry or mournful, when the notes are  sharp or flat, the tune in or out of time, the key high-pitched or low.  But do I really know even that?          PATISAR,    _30th March 1894._      Sometimes when I realise that Life's journey is long, and that the sorrows  to be encountered are many and inevitable, a supreme effort is required to  keep up my strength of mind. Some evenings, as I sit alone staring at the  flame of the lamp on the table, I vow I will live as a brave man  should--unmoved, silent, uncomplaining. The resolve puffs me up, and for  the moment I mistake myself for a very, very brave person indeed. But as  soon as the thorns on the road worry my feet, I writhe and begin to feel  serious misgivings as to the future. The path of life again seems long,  and my strength inadequate.    But this last conclusion cannot be the true one, for it is these petty  thorns which are the most difficult to bear. The household of the mind is  a thrifty one, and only so much is spent as is necessary. There is no  squandering on trifles, and its wealth of strength is saved up with  miserly strictness to meet the really big calamities. So any amount of  weeping and wailing over the lesser griefs fails to evoke a charitable  response. But when sorrow is deepest there is no stint of effort. Then the  surface crust is pierced, and consolation wells up, and all the forces of  patience and courage are banded together to do their duty. Thus great  suffering brings with it the power of great endurance.    One side of man's nature has the desire for pleasure--there is another  side which desires self-sacrifice. When the former meets with  disappointment, the latter gains strength, and on its thus finding fuller  scope a grand enthusiasm fills the soul. So while we are cowards before  petty troubles, great sorrows make us brave by rousing our truer manhood.  And in these, therefore, there is a joy.    It is not an empty paradox to say that there is joy in sorrow, just as, on  the other hand, it is true that there is a dissatisfaction in pleasure. It  is not difficult to understand why this should be so.          SHELIDAH,    _24th June 1894_.      I have been only four days here, but, having lost count of the hours, it  seems such a long while, I feel that if I were to return to Calcutta  to-day I should find much of it changed--as if I alone had been standing  still outside the "]]]
