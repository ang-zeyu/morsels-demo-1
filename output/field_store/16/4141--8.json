Five minutes of such  travelling brought them abreast of a grounded berg, to which they  resolved to make fast. The order was given to cast off the rope. Away  went their white tug on his race to the far north, and the ship swung  round in safety under the lee of the berg, where the crew acknowledged  with gratitude their merciful deliverance from imminent danger.        CHAPTER VII.    _New characters introduced--An old game under novel  circumstances--Remarkable appearances in the sky--O'Riley meets with a  mishap_.      Dumps was a remarkably grave and sly character, and Poker was a wag--an  incorrigible wag--in every sense of the term. Moreover, although they  had an occasional fight, Dumps and Poker were excellent friends, and  great favourites with the crew.    We have not yet introduced these individuals to our reader, but as they  will act a conspicuous part in the history of the _Dolphin's_  adventurous career in the Arctic Regions, we think it right now to  present them.    While at Upernavik, Captain Guy had purchased a team of six good, tough  Esquimau dogs, being desirous of taking them to England, and there  presenting them to several of his friends who were anxious to possess  specimens of those animals. Two of these dogs stood out conspicuous from  their fellows, not only in regard to personal appearance, but also in  reference to peculiarities of character. One was pure white, with a  lively expression of countenance, a large shaggy body, two erect,  sharp-pointed ears, and a short projection that once had been a tail.  Owing to some cause unknown, however, his tail had been cut or bitten  off, and nothing save the stump remained. But this stump did as much  duty as if it had been fifty tails in one. It was never at rest for a  moment, and its owner evidently believed that wagging it was the true  and only way to touch the heart of man; therefore the dog wagged it, so  to speak, doggedly. In consequence of this animal's thieving  propensities, which led him to be constantly _poking_ into every hole  and corner of the ship in search of something to steal, he was named  _Poker_. Poker had three jet-black spots in his white visage--one was  the point of his nose, the other two were his eyes.    Poker's bosom friend, Dumps, was so named because he had the sulkiest  expression of countenance that ever fell to the lot of a dog. Hopelessly  incurable melancholy seemed to have taken possession of his mind, for he  never by any chance smiled--and dogs do smile, you know, just as  evidently as human beings do, although not exactly with their mouths.  Dumps never romped either, being old, but he sat and allowed his friend  Poker to romp round him with a sort of sulky satisfaction, as if he  experienced the greatest enjoyment his nature was capable of in  witnessing the antics of his youthful companion--for Poker was young.  The prevailing colour of Dumps's shaggy hide was a dirty brown, with  black spots, two of which had fixed themselves rather awkwardly round  his eyes, like a pair of spectacles. Dumps, also, was a thief, and,  indeed, so were all his brethren. Dumps and Poker were both of them  larger and stronger, and in every way better, than their comrades; and  they afterwards were the sturdy, steady, unflinching leaders of the team  during many a toilsome journey over the frozen sea.    One magnificent afternoon, a few days after the escape of the _Dolphin_  just related, Dumps and Poker lay side by side in the lee-scuppers,  calmly sleeping off the effects of a surfeit produced by the eating of a  large piece of pork, for which the cook had searched in vain for  three-quarters of an hour, and of which he at last found the bare bone  sticking in the hole of the larboard pump.    \"Bad luck to them dogs,\" exclaimed David Mizzle, stroking his chin as he  surveyed the bone. \"If I could only find out, now, which of ye it was,  I'd have ye slaughtered right off, and cooked for the mess, I would.\"    \"It was Dumps as did it, I'll bet you a month's pay,\" said Peter Grim,  as he sat on the end of the windlass refilling his pipe, which he had  just smoked out.    \"Not a bit of it,\" remarked Amos Parr, who was squatted on the deck  busily engaged in constructing a rope mat, while several of the men sat  round him engaged in mending sails, or stitching canvas slippers,  etc.--\"not a bit of it, Grim; Dumps is too honest by half to do sich a  thing. 'Twas Poker as did it, I can see by the roll of his eye below the  skin. The blackguard's only shammin' sleep.\"    On hearing his name mentioned, Poker gently opened his right eye, but  did not move. Dumps, on the contrary, lay as if he heard not the base  aspersion on his character.    \"What'll ye bet it was Dumps as did it?\" cried Davie Summers, who passed  at the moment with a dish of some sort of edible towards the galley or  cooking-house on deck.    \"I'll _bet_ you over the 'ead, I will, if you don't mind your business,\"  said Mivins.    \"You'd _better_ not,\" retorted Davie with a grin. \"It's as much as your  situation's worth to lay a finger on me.\"    \"That's it, youngster, give it 'im,\" cried several of the men, while the  boy confronted his superior, taking good care, however, to keep the  fore-mast between them.    \"What do you mean, you young rascal?\" cried Mivins with a frown.    \"Mean!\" said Davie, \"why, I mean that if you touch me I'll resign  office; and if I do that, you'll have to go out, for every one knows you  can't get on without me.\"    \"I say, Mivins,\" cried Tom Green, the carpenter's mate, \"if you were  asked to say, '_H_old on _h_ard to this _h_andspike _h_ere, my  _h_earties,' how would ye go about it?\"    \"He'd 'it you a pretty 'ard crack _h_over the 'ead with it, 'e would,\"  remarked one of the men, throwing a ball of yarn at Davie, who stood  listening to the conversation with a broad grin.    In stepping back to avoid the blow, the lad trod on Dumps's paw, and  instantly there came from the throat of that excellent dog a roar of  anguish that caused Poker to leap, as the cook expressed it, nearly out  of his own skin. Dogs are by nature extremely sympathetic and remarkably  inquisitive; and no sooner was Dumps's yell heard than it was vigorously  responded to by every dog in the ship, as the whole pack rushed each  from his respective sleeping-place and looked round in amazement.    \"Hallo! what's wrong there for'ard?\" inquired Saunders, who had been  pacing the quarter-deck with slow giant strides, arguing mentally with  himself in default of a better adversary.    \"Only trod on Dumps's paw, sir,\" said Mivins, as he hurried aft; \"the  men are sky-larking.\"    \"Sky-larking, are you?\" said Saunders, going forward. \"Weel, lads,  you've had a lot o' hard work of late, ye may go' and take a run on the  ice.\"    Instantly the men, like boys set free from school, sprang up, tumbled  over the side, and were scampering over the ice like madmen.    \"Pitch over the ball--the football!\" they cried. In a second the ball  was tossed over the ship's side, and a vigorous game was begun.    For two days past the _Dolphin_ had been sailing with difficulty through  large fields of ice, sometimes driving against narrow necks and tongues  that interrupted her passage from one lead or canal to another; at other  times boring with difficulty through compact masses of sludge; or  occasionally, when unable to advance farther, making fast to a large  berg or a field. They were compelled to proceed north, however, in  consequence of the pack having become fixed towards, the south, and thus  rendering retreat impossible in that direction until the ice should be  again set in motion. Captain Guy, however, saw, by the steady advance of  the larger bergs, that the current of the ocean in that place flowed  southward, and trusted that in a short time the ice which had been  forced into the strait by the late gales would be released, and open up  a passage. Meanwhile he pushed along the coast, examining every bay and  inlet in the hope of discovering some trace of the _Pole Star_ or her  crew.    On the day about which we are writing, the ship was beset by large  fields, the snow-white surfaces of which extended north and south to the  horizon, while on the east the cliffs rose in dark, frowning precipices  from the midst of the glaciers that encumber them all the year round.    It was a lovely Arctic day. The sun shone with unclouded splendour, and  the bright air, which trembled with that liquidity of appearance that  one occasionally sees in very hot weather under peculiar circumstances,  was vocal with the wild music of thousands of gulls, and auks, and other  sea-birds, which clustered on the neighbouring cliffs and flew overhead  in clouds. All round the pure surfaces of the ice-fields were broken by  the shadows which the hummocks and bergs cast over them, and by the  pools of clear water which shone like crystals in their hollows, while  the beautiful beryl blue of the larger bergs gave a delicate colouring  to the dazzling scene. Words cannot describe the intense _glitter_ that  characterized everything. Every point seemed a diamond, every edge sent  forth a gleam of light, and many of the masses reflected the rich  prismatic colours of the rainbow. It seemed as if the sun himself had  been multiplied in order to add to the excessive brilliancy, for he was  surrounded by _parhelia_, or _sun-dogs,_ as the men called them. This  peculiarity in the sun's appearance was very striking. The great orb of  day was about ten degrees above the horizon, and a horizontal line of  white passed completely through it, extending to a considerable distance  on either hand, while around it were two distinct halos, or circles of  light.

Wherefore, unless thou give  thyself wholly to laborious research into the nature of things, and  diligently examine the _causes and reasons_ of the art thou teachest,  believe me, thou shalt but see with other men's eyes, and hear with other  men's ears. But the minds of many are preoccupied with a certain perverse  opinion, or rather ignorant conceit, that in grammar, or the art of  speaking, there are no causes, and that reason is scarcely to be appealed  to for any thing;--than which idle notion, I know of nothing more  foolish;--nothing can be thought of which is more offensive. Shall man,  endowed with reason, do, say, or contrive any thing, without design, and  without understanding? Hear the philosophers; who positively declare that  nothing comes to pass without a cause. Hear Plato himself; who affirms that  names and words subsist by nature, and contends that language is derived  from nature, and not from art.\"    19. \"I know,\" says he, \"that the Aristotelians think otherwise; but no one  will doubt that names are the signs, and as it were the instruments, of  things. But the instrument of any art is so adapted to that art, that for  any other purpose it must seem unfit; thus with an auger we bore, and with  a saw we cut wood; but we split stones with wedges, and wedges are driven  with heavy mauls. We cannot therefore but believe that those who first gave  names to things, did it with design; and this, I imagine, Aristotle himself  understood when he said, _ad placitum nomina significare._ For those who  contend that names were made by chance, are no less audacious than if they  would endeavour to persuade us, that the whole order of the universe was  framed together fortuitously.\"    20. \"You will see,\" continues he, \"that in the first language, whatever it  was, the names of things were taken from Nature herself; but, though I  cannot affirm this to have been the case in other tongues, yet I can easily  persuade myself that in every tongue a reason can be rendered for the  application of every name; and that this reason, though it is in many cases  obscure, is nevertheless worthy of investigation. Many things which were  not known to the earlier philosophers, were brought to light by Plato;  after the death of Plato, many were discovered by Aristotle; and Aristotle  was ignorant of many which are now everywhere known. For truth lies hid,  but nothing is more precious than truth. But you will say, 'How can there  be any certain origin to names, when one and the same thing is called by  different names, in the several parts of the world?' I answer, of the same  thing there may be different causes, of which some people may regard one,  and others, an other. * * * There is therefore no doubt, that of all  things, even of words, a reason is to be rendered: and if we know not what  that reason is, when we are asked; we ought rather to confess that we do  not know, than to affirm that none can be given. I know that Scaliger  thinks otherwise; but this is the true account of the matter.\"    21. \"These several observations,\" he remarks further, \"I have unwillingly  brought together against those stubborn critics who, while they explode  reason from grammar, insist so much on the testimonies of the learned. But  have they never read Quintilian, who says, (Lib. i, Cap. 6,) that,  'Language is established by reason, antiquity, authority, and custom?' He  therefore does not exclude reason, but makes it the principal thing. Nay,  in a manner, Laurentius, and other grammatists, even of their fooleries,  are forward to offer _reasons_, such as they are. Moreover, use does not  take place without reason; otherwise, it ought to be called abuse, and not  use. But from use authority derives all its force; for when it recedes from  use, authority becomes nothing: whence Cicero reproves Coelius and Marcus  Antonius for speaking according to their own fancy, and not according to  use. But, 'Nothing can be lasting,' says Curtius, (Lib. iv,) 'which is not  based upon reason.' It remains, therefore, that of all things the reason be  first assigned; and then, if it can be done, we may bring forward  testimonies; that the thing, having every advantage, may be made the more  clear.\"--_Sanctii Minerva_, Lib. i, Cap. 2.    22. Julius Caesar Scaliger, from whose opinion Sanctius dissents above,  seems to limit the science of grammar to bounds considerably too narrow,  though he found within them room for the exercise of much ingenuity and  learning. He says, \"Grammatica est scientia loquendi ex usu; neque enim  constituit regulas scientibus usus modum, sed ex eorum statis  frequentibusque usurpatiombus colligit communem rationem loquendi, quam  discentibus traderet.\"--_De Causis L. Latinae_, Lib. iv, Cap. 76. \"Grammar  is the science of speaking according to use; for it does not establish  rules for those who know the manner of use, but from the settled and  frequent usages of these, gathers the common fashion of speaking, which it  should deliver to learners.\" This limited view seems not only to exclude  from the science the use of the pen, but to exempt the learned from any  obligation to respect the rules prescribed for the initiation of the young.  But I have said, and with abundant authority, that the acquisition of a  good style of writing is the main purpose of the study; and, surely, the  proficients and adepts in the art can desire for themselves no such  exemption. Men of genius, indeed, sometimes affect to despise the pettiness  of all grammatical instructions; but this can be nothing else than  affectation, since the usage of the learned is confessedly the basis of all  such instructions, and several of the loftiest of their own rank appear on  the list of grammarians.    23. Quintilian, whose authority is appealed to above, belonged to that age  in which the exegesis of histories, poems, and other writings, was  considered an essential part of grammar. He therefore, as well as Diomedes,  and other ancient writers, divided the grammarian's duties into two parts;  the one including what is now called grammar, and the other the  explanation of authors, and the stigmatizing of the unworthy. Of the  opinion referred to by Sanctius, it seems proper to make here an ampler  citation. It shall be attempted in English, though the paragraph is not an  easy one to translate. I understand the author to say, \"Speakers, too, have  their rules to observe; and writers, theirs. Language is established by  reason, antiquity, authority, and custom. Of reason the chief ground is  analogy, but sometimes etymology. Ancient things have a certain majesty,  and, as I might say, religion, to commend them. Authority is wont to be  sought from orators and historians; the necessity of metre mostly excuses  the poets. When the judgement of the chief masters of eloquence passes for  reason, even error seems right to those who follow great leaders. But, of  the art of speaking, custom is the surest mistress; for speech is evidently  to be used as money, which has upon it a public stamp. Yet all these things  require a penetrating judgement, especially analogy; the force of which is,  that one may refer what is doubtful, to something similar that is clearly  established, and thus prove uncertain things by those which are  sure.\"--QUINT, _de Inst. Orat._, Lib. i, Cap. 6, p. 48.    24. The science of grammar, whatever we may suppose to be its just limits,  does not appear to have been better cultivated in proportion as its scope  was narrowed. Nor has its application to our tongue, in particular, ever  been made in such a manner, as to do _great_ honour to the learning or the  talents of him that attempted it. What is new to a nation, may be old to  the world. The development of the intellectual powers of youth by  instruction in the classics, as well as the improvement of their taste by  the exhibition of what is elegant in literature, is continually engaging  the attention of new masters, some of whom may seem to effect great  improvements; but we must remember that the concern itself is of no recent  origin. Plato and Aristotle, who were great masters both of grammar and of  philosophy, taught these things ably at Athens, in the fourth century  _before_ Christ. Varro, the grammarian, usually styled the most learned of  the Romans, was _contemporary_ with the Saviour and his apostles.  Quintilian lived in the _first_ century of our era, and before he wrote his  most celebrated book, taught a school twenty years in Rome, and received  from the state a salary which made him rich. This \"consummate guide of  wayward youth,\" as the poet Martial called him, being neither ignorant of  what had been done by others, nor disposed to think it a light task to  prescribe the right use of his own language, was at first slow to undertake  the work upon which his fame now reposes; and, after it was begun, diligent  to execute it worthily, that it might turn both to his own honour, and to  the real advancement of learning.    25. He says, at the commencement of his book: \"After I had obtained a quiet  release from those labours which for twenty years had devolved upon me as  an instructor of youth, certain persons familiarly demanded of me, that I  should compose something concerning the proper manner of speaking; but for  a long time I withstood their solicitations, because I knew there were  already illustrious authors in each language, by whom many things which  might pertain to such a work, had been very diligently written, and left to  posterity. But the reason which I thought would obtain for me an easier  excuse, did but excite more earnest entreaty;"]]]
