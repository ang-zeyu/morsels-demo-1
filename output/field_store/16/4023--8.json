No general  attack was made in revenge for what they saw was the result of  misunderstanding, although they were ignorant of the exact circumstances  which led, first to the uncommon and extraordinary veneration with which  he had been treated, and then to the sudden change in the native  behaviour.    It was found necessary to fire on the natives who prevented the watering  party from working, and some of the sailors on this duty burnt some  houses; but before the ships left, friendly relations were again  established, and many natives visited them.    After Cook's remains had been committed to the sea, the prosecution of  the voyage was determined upon, although Captain Clerke was in the last  stage of consumption, and as soon as the Resolution's mast could be  repaired, the two vessels once more departed, on February 22nd, 1779.    Cook's intentions were carried out as if he had still been in command.  The remainder of the Sandwich Group was mapped, and the ships proceeded  once more to the north. Calling at Petropavlovsk in Avatcha Bay,  Kamtchatka, they again passed through Bering Strait, and sought in vain  for a passage either to the north-east or north-west, being everywhere  baffled by dense masses of ice. Captain Clerke at last abandoned the  struggle, and repassed Bering Strait on his way south on August 1st.    On August 22nd Captain Clerke died.    This officer had accompanied Captain Cook in all his voyages, and had  also circumnavigated the globe in the Dolphin with Captain Byron before.  No man had seen more of the Pacific, and he proved himself, during his  short period of command, a worthy successor of Cook.    Captain Gore, who had been with Cook on his First Voyage, now succeeded,  King being put as Commander into the Discovery, and the two ships made  the best of their way home, via Macao and the Straits of Sunda, arriving  at the Nore on October 4th, 1780, after an absence of four years and two  months. During the whole of this voyage not the slightest symptom of  scurvy appeared in either ship, so completely were Cook's precautions  successful.    Cook had six children. Three died young. Of the others, all boys, the  eldest, James, entered the Navy, and lived to be a Commander, when, in  1794, he was drowned. The second, Nathaniel, also in the Navy, was lost  in a hurricane in 1780. The third died when at Cambridge. They none of  them lived to be married, and no descendant of the great navigator has  perpetuated his race.    Of Cook's private life during his brief intervals at home we know  nothing. A man rising from the ranks, and of his reserved character,  would have but few friends, when he had such short time to make them in  his new sphere. He lived at Mile End when at home, but after his death  his widow removed to Clapham, living there for forty years, at first with  her cousin, Isaac Smith, who had served with Cook in the Endeavour and  Resolution. She died in 1835, at the great age of ninety-three.    Of Cook's character, none could be a better judge than Captain King, who  writes as follows, after describing his death:--    \"Thus fell our great and excellent commander. After a life of so much  distinguished and successful enterprise, his death, as far as regards  himself, cannot be considered premature, since he lived to finish the  great work for which he seems to have been designed. How sincerely his  loss was felt and lamented, by those who had so long found their general  security in his skill and conduct, and every consolation in their  hardships in his tenderness and humanity, it is neither necessary nor  possible for me to describe. The constitution of his body was robust,  inured to labour, and capable of undergoing the severest hardships. His  stomach bore without difficulty the coarsest and most ungrateful food.  Indeed, temperance with him was scarcely a virtue, so great was the  indifference with which he submitted to every kind of self-denial. The  qualities of his mind were of the same hardy, vigorous kind with those of  his body. His understanding was strong and perspicacious. His judgment in  whatever related to the service he was engaged in quick and sure. His  designs were bold and manly, and both in the conception and in the mode  of execution bore evident marks of a great original genius. His courage  was cool and determined, and accompanied by an admirable presence of mind  in the moment of danger. His manners were plain and unaffected. His  temper might, perhaps, have been justly blamed as subject to haughtiness  and passion, had not these been disarmed by a disposition the most  benevolent and humane. Those intervals of recreation, which sometimes  unavoidably occurred, and were looked for by us with a longing that  persons who have experienced the fatigues of service will readily excuse,  were submitted to by him with a certain impatience whenever they could  not be employed in making further provision for the more effectual  prosecution of his designs.\"    This is a pretty complete picture, and of a great man; a man who had  before him continually his duty, and who had in an eminent degree the  capacity to carry it out.    Though, under his determination to do this, he drove his people hard;  though he tried them with his irascibility; their conviction of his  greatness, their confidence in his leadership and in his justice, led  them to love him. He had no sympathy with the ordinary foibles and  weaknesses of his men. The charms of Tahiti, the paradise of the sailor,  were no charms for him; he hardly notices the attractive ladies of that  island; the attractions of the place to him were the abundance of  provisions, as a means of fitting his expedition for further exploration  and hardship. The strongest proof of his capacity as a commander is the  devotion of his officers. Those who know the Navy know how difficult it  is for any man who rises from the ranks to be successful in command. But  Cook was a gentleman born; he had the intuition of great minds for  fitting themselves to every position to which they may rise, and there is  never a whisper of disinclination to submit to the rule of the once  collier boy, the son of a labourer.    His intelligence is remarkably shown in his greatest triumph, the  suppression of scurvy. That it should be left to a man of little  education to discern the combination of means by which this enemy of long  voyages could be conquered, is the most remarkable thing about this  remarkable man. He himself notices the disinclination of the sailor to  any new article of food, especially when not particularly palatable; but  he soon found the means to induce them to understand that their lives  greatly depended upon these rather nasty messes. Sour krout; the  unsavoury portable soups of that day; the strange greens that Cook  insisted on hunting up at every land he visited, and boiling with their  ordinary food; the constant washing between decks; the drying below with  stoves, even in the hottest weather; the personal baths; the change of  wet clothing; the airing of bedding, were all foreign and repugnant to  the notions of the seamen of the day, and it required constant  supervision and wise management to enforce the adoption of these odd  foods and customs.    It is evident that it is to Cook's personal action the success was due.  Wallis and Byron had anti-scorbutics, but they suffered from scurvy;  Furneaux, sailing with Cook in the second voyage, under precisely similar  circumstances, suffered from scurvy. It was only in Cook's ships, and in  the Discovery, commanded and officered by men who had sailed with Cook,  and seen his methods, that exemption occurred.    Cook did more, incomparably more, than any other navigator to discover  new lands. This was only accomplished by dint of hard work; and yet his  men suffered less than in any ships, British or foreign, or similar  expeditions. Though his tracks were in new and unknown waters, we never  hear of starvation; he always manages to have an abundant supply of  water.    The completeness and accuracy of his accounts and charts are no less  remarkable.    M. de La Perouse, one of the foremost of the great French navigators,  told Captain Phillip, the founder of the Colony of New South Wales, that  \"Cook had left him nothing but to admire.\" This was all but literally  true; wherever Cook went he finished his work, according to the  requirements of navigation of his time. He never sighted a land but he  determined its dimensions, its shape, its position, and left true guides  for his successors. His charts are still for some parts unsuperseded, and  his recorded observations still save us from hasty and incorrect  alterations desired by modern navigators.    Well may Englishmen be proud that this greatest of navigators was their  countryman.      PERSONS WHO LEFT ENGLAND IN H.M.S. ENDEAVOUR, 26TH AUGUST, 1768.

They haue an opinion that ther are two Goddes, one  immortall, by whome all thinges haue their beginning and continuance vnder  his gouernement, and another mortall, and he is vncerteine. Their king, and  him that best deserueth of the city next vnto him, they honour as Goddes.  This was the state of Ethiope from the beginning, and many yeares sence.    But at this daye as myne Authour Sabellicus saieth that he learned of those  that are enhabitantes in that countrey: The King of Ethiope (whom we  commonly calle Pretoianes or Presbiter Ihon) is a man of suche power, that  he is reported to haue vndre him thre skore and two other kinges. If the  heade Bysshoppess of the Realme desire to do, or to haue aughte done, al is  referred vnto him. Of him be giuen al benefices, and spiritual promocions,  which prerogatiue the Pope hath giuen, to the maiestie of kinges. Yet is he  him selfe no priest, he hath any maner of ordres. There is of  Archebisshoppes (that is to say of superiour and head bisshoppes) a great  nombre, whiche haue euery one vndre them at the least twenty other. The  Princes, Dukes, Earles, and head Bishoppes, and suche other of like  dignitie, when they come abrode, haue a crosse, and a basine of golde  filled ful of earthe caried before them: that thone [Footnote: The one.]  maye put them in remembraunce that earth into earth must again be resolued,  and the other renewe the memory of Christes suffering. Their priestes to  haue yssue, mary one wyfe, but she ones beyng dead, it is vnlawfull to mary  another. The temples and churches ther, are muche larger, much richer, and  more gorgeous then ours, for the moste part voulted from the floore to the  toppe. They haue many ordres of deuout men, moche like to our ordres of  Religious: as the ordre of S. Anthony, Dominique, Calaguritani, Augustines,  and Machareanes, whiche are bound to no colour but weare some suche one as  Tharchebysshoppe shall allowe. Next vnto the supreame and souereigne GOD,  and Mary the virgin his mother, they haue moste in honour Thomas sirnamed  Didimus. This King, of all other the worthiest, whome they call Gias (a  name giuen him of his mightiness and power) is of the bloud of Dauid,  continued from one generation to another (as they are perswaded) by so many  yeres of succession. And he is not as the moste of the Ethiopians are,  blacke, but white. Gamma the chiefe citie, and as we terme it the chambre  of the king, stondeth not by building of masonrie, and carpentrie as ours,  but strieted with tentes and pauilions placed in good ordre, of veluet and  saten, embrauded with silkes and purples of many diuers sortes. By an  auncient ordre of the realme, the king liueth euer in presence and sighte  of his people, and neuer soiourneth within the walles aboue two daies.  Either for that they iudge it an vncomely thing, and a token of delicate  slouthfulnes, or elles for that some law doth forbid it. His army in the  warres is ten hundred thousande men, fiue hundred Elephantes, and horses,  and Cameles, a wonderfull nomber, and this is but a meane preparacion. Ther  are througheout the whole nacion certeine houses and stockes, that are  pencionaries at armes, whose issue is as it ware branded with the marcke of  the crosse, the skinne beyng pretely slitte. Thei vse in the warres, Bowe,  Pique, Habregeon, and helmette. Their highest dignitie is priesthode, the  next, thordre of the Sages, whiche thei cal Balsamates, and Tamquates. They  attribute moche also to the giltelesse and vprighte dealing man, whiche  vertue they estieme as the firste staier to climbe to the dignitie of the  sages. The nobilitie hath the thirde place of dignitie, and the  pencionaries aforesaid, the fourthe. When the iudges haue giuen sentence of  life, or of deathe, the sentence is brought to the headborough of the Citie  (whom we call the Mayour) and they Licomegia: he supplieth the place of the  King. Lawes written thei occupy none, but iudge accordyng to reason and  conscience. If any man be conuict of adulterie he forfeicteth the fourtieth  parte of his goodes, but thadulteresse is punished at home, accordyng to  the discretion of the partie offended. The men giue dowrie to those whom  thei mary withal, but not to those that thei purchase besides. Their womens  attire is of Golde, (whereof that country hathe plentie) of pearle, and of  Sarsenette. Bothe men and women are apparelled in long garmentes downe to  the foote, slieued, and close rounde aboute of al maner of colours, sauing  only blacke for that in that contry is proper for morning. They bewaile  their dead xl. daies space. In bancquettes of honour, in the place of our  fruicte (which the latine calleth the seconde boorde) they serue in rawe  flesshe very finely minced and spiced, whervpon the gestes fiede very  licouricely. [Footnote: Gluttonously, daintily. (N. Wiley's Dictionary,  1737).] They haue no maner of wollen webbe, but are eyther cladde in  sarsenettes, or in linnen. One maner of speache serueth not througheout the  whole contry, but sondry and diuerse, aswel in phrase as in naming of  thinges. Thei haue twise in the yere haruest, and twise in the yere somer.  These Ethiopians or Indianes excepted, al the reste of the people of Libia  Westward, are worshippers of Mahomet, and liue aftre the same sorte in  maner, that the Barbariens do in Egipte at this present, and are called  Maures, or Moores, as I thincke of their outleapes and wilde rowming. For  that people was no lesse noysome to Lybie in those cursed tymes (when so  greate mutacion of thinges happened, when peoples ware so chaunged, suche  alteration of seruice, and religion broughte in, and so many newe names  giuen vnto contries) then the Sarasens ware.      ¶ The v. Chapiter    ¶ Of Aegipte, and the auncient maners of that people.    Aegipte is a Countrie lying in Affrike, or as some hold opinion, borderyng  thervpon, so named of Aegiptus, Danaus brother, where afore it was called  Aeria. This Aegipte (as Plinie recordeth in his fiueth boke) toucheth on  the East, vppon the redde Sea, and the land of Palestine; On the West  fronteth vpon Cirene, and the residue of Afrike. On the South it stretcheth  to Aethiope: And on the Northe is ended with the sea, to whom it giueth  name. The notable Cities of that Countrie, were in tyme past, Thebes,  Abydos, Alexandrie, Babilon, and Memphis, at this daie called Damiate,  alias Chairas or Alkair, and the seate of the Soldan, a citie of notable  largenesse. In Aegipt as Plato affirmeth, it was neuer sene rain. But Nilus  suppliyng that defaulte, yerely about saincte Barnabies tide, with his  ouerflowynges maketh the soile fertile. It is nombred of the moste parte of  writers, emong the Islandes: For that Nilus so parteth hymself aboute it,  that he facioneth it triangle wise.    The Aegiptians firste of all other, deuised the names of the twelue Goddes,  builte vp Altares, and Images, erected Chappelles and Temples, and graued  in stone the similitude of many sondrie beastes. All whiche their doynges,  dooe manifestly make, that thei came of the Aethiopes, who (as Diodore the  Sicilian saieth) ware the firste inuentours of all these. Their women in  old tyme, had all the trade of occupiyng, and brokage [Footnote: To _broke_  i.e. to deal, or transact business particularly of an amorous character.  (See Fansh. Lusiad, ix., 44; and Daniel, Queen's Arcadia, iii., 3.)]  abrode, and reuelled at the Tauerne, and kepte lustie chiere: And the men  satte at home spinnyng, and woorkyng of Lace, and suche other thynges as  women are wonte. The men bare their burdeins on the heade, the women on the  shulder. In the easemente of vrine, the men rowked [Footnote: To bend.]  doune, the women stoode vprighte. The easemente of ordure thei vsed at  home, but commonly feasted abrode in the stretes. No woman tooke ordres,  either of God or Goddesse. Their maner of ordres, is not to make seuerally  for euery Goddesse and God, a seuerall priest, but al at a shuffe, in  generall for all. Emong the whiche, one is an heade, whose sonne enheriteth  his roume by succession. The men children, euen of a custome of that  people, did with good wil kepe their fathers and mothers, but the women  children (yf they refused it) ware compelled. The moste part of men in  solempne burialles, shaue their heades, and let theyr beardes growe, but  Thegiptians shaued their beardes and let their heades grow. They wrought  their doughe with their fiete, and their claye with their handes. As the  Grecians do beleue, this people, and their ofspring, are they that vsed  circumcision. Thei ordre their writyng from their right hande towarde their  left, contrary to vs. It was the maner emong them, that the menne should  weare two garmentes at ones, the women but one. As the Aethiopes had, so  learned they of them, two maner of lettres; the one seuerall to the  priestes thother vsed in commune. Their priestes, euery thirde daye shaued  their bodies, that there might be none occasion of filthinesse when they  shold ministre or sacrifie. Thei did were garmentes of linnen, euer cleane  wasshed, and white: and shoes of a certeine kinde of russhes, named  Papyrus, whiche aftre became stuffe, to geue name to our paper. They  neither sette beane their selues, ne eate them where soeuer they grewe: ne  the priest may not loke vpon a beane, for that it is iudged an vncleane  puls. They are wasshed euery daye in colde water thrise, and euery nighte  twise. The heades of their sacrifices (for that they vsed to curse them  with many terrible woordes) did they not eate, but either the priestes  solde them to such strangiers as had trade emonge them, or if there ware no  suche ready in time, they threwe them in to Nilus.    All the Egiptians offer in sacrifice, neither cowe, ne cowe calfe, because  they are hallowed to Isis their goddesse, but"]]]
