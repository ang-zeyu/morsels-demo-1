They had founded colonies after the  Phoenician pattern. They had even improved upon the Phoenician methods  by a more general use of money in dealing with foreign customers. In  the sixth century before our era they had established themselves firmly  along the coast of Asia Minor and they were taking away trade from the  Phoenicians at a fast rate. This the Phoenicians of course did not  like but they were not strong enough to risk a war with their Greek  competitors. They sat and waited nor did they wait in vain.    In a former chapter, I have told you how a humble tribe of Persian  shepherds had suddenly gone upon the warpath and had conquered the  greater part of western Asia. The Persians were too civilised to plunder  their new subjects. They contented themselves with a yearly tribute.  When they reached the coast of Asia Minor they insisted that the Greek  colonies of Lydia recognize the Persian Kings as their over-Lords and  pay them a stipulated tax. The Greek colonies objected. The Persians  insisted. Then the Greek colonies appealed to the home-country and the  stage was set for a quarrel.    For if the truth be told, the Persian Kings regarded the Greek  city-states as very dangerous political institutions and bad examples  for all other people who were supposed to be the patient slaves of the  mighty Persian Kings.    Of course, the Greeks enjoyed a certain degree of safety because their  country lay hidden beyond the deep waters of the AEgean. But here their  old enemies, the Phoenicians, stepped forward with offers of help and  advice to the Persians. If the Persian King would provide the soldiers,  the Phoenicians would guarantee to deliver the necessary ships to carry  them to Europe. It was the year 492 before the birth of Christ, and Asia  made ready to destroy the rising power of Europe.    As a final warning the King of Persia sent messengers to the Greeks  asking for \"earth and water\" as a token of their submission. The Greeks  promptly threw the messengers into the nearest well where they would  find both \"earth and water\" in large abundance and thereafter of course  peace was impossible.    But the Gods of High Olympus watched over their children and when the  Phoenician fleet carrying the Persian troops was near Mount Athos, the  Storm-God blew his cheeks until he almost burst the veins of his brow,  and the fleet was destroyed by a terrible hurricane and the Persians  were all drowned.    Two years later they returned. This time they sailed straight across  the AEgean Sea and landed near the village of Marathon. As soon as the  Athenians heard this they sent their army of ten thousand men to guard  the hills that surrounded the Marathonian plain. At the same time they  despatched a fast runner to Sparta to ask for help. But Sparta was  envious of the fame of Athens and refused to come to her assistance.  The other Greek cities followed her example with the exception of tiny  Plataea which sent a thousand men. On the twelfth of September of the  year 490, Miltiades, the Athenian commander, threw this little army  against the hordes of the Persians. The Greeks broke through the Persian  barrage of arrows and their spears caused terrible havoc among the  disorganised Asiatic troops who had never been called upon to resist  such an enemy.    That night the people of Athens watched the sky grow red with the flames  of burning ships. Anxiously they waited for news. At last a little  cloud of dust appeared upon the road that led to the North. It was  Pheidippides, the runner. He stumbled and gasped for his end was near.  Only a few days before had he returned from his errand to Sparta. He had  hastened to join Miltiades. That morning he had taken part in the attack  and later he had volunteered to carry the news of victory to his beloved  city. The people saw him fall and they rushed forward to support him.  \"We have won,\" he whispered and then he died, a glorious death which  made him envied of all men.    As for the Persians, they tried, after this defeat, to land near Athens  but they found the coast guarded and disappeared, and once more the land  of Hellas was at peace.    Eight years they waited and during this time the Greeks were not idle.  They knew that a final attack was to be expected but they did not agree  upon the best way to avert the danger. Some people wanted to increase  the army. Others said that a strong fleet was necessary for success. The  two parties led by Aristides (for the army) and Themistocles (the leader  of the bigger-navy men) fought each other bitterly and nothing was done  until Aristides was exiled. Then Themistocles had his chance and he  built all the ships he could and turned the Piraeus into a strong naval  base.    In the year 481 B.C. a tremendous Persian army appeared in Thessaly, a  province of northern Greece. In this hour of danger, Sparta, the  great military city of Greece, was elected commander-in-chief. But the  Spartans cared little what happened to northern Greece provided their  own country was not invaded, They neglected to fortify the passes that  led into Greece.    A small detachment of Spartans under Leonidas had been told to guard  the narrow road between the high mountains and the sea which connected  Thessaly with the southern provinces. Leonidas obeyed his orders. He  fought and held the pass with unequalled bravery. But a traitor by the  name of Ephialtes who knew the little byways of Malis guided a regiment  of Persians through the hills and made it possible for them to attack  Leonidas in the rear. Near the Warm Wells--the Thermopylae--a terrible  battle was fought.    When night came Leonidas and his faithful soldiers lay dead under the  corpses of their enemies.    But the pass had been lost and the greater part of Greece fell into the  hands of the Persians. They marched upon Athens, threw the garrison from  the rocks of the Acropolis and burned the city. The people fled to the  Island of Salamis. All seemed lost. But on the 20th of September of the  year 480 Themistocles forced the Persian fleet to give battle within the  narrow straits which separated the Island of Salamis from the mainland  and within a few hours he destroyed three quarters of the Persian ships.    In this way the victory of Thermopylae came to naught. Xerxes was forced  to retire. The next year, so he decreed, would bring a final decision.  He took his troops to Thessaly and there he waited for spring.    But this time the Spartans understood the seriousness of the hour.  They left the safe shelter of the wall which they had built across the  isthmus of Corinth and under the leadership of Pausanias they marched  against Mardonius the Persian general. The united Greeks (some one  hundred thousand men from a dozen different cities) attacked the three  hundred thou-sand men of the enemy near Plataea. Once more the heavy  Greek infantry broke through the Persian barrage of arrows. The Persians  were defeated, as they had been at Marathon, and this time they left for  good. By a strange coincidence, the same day that the Greek armies won  their victory near Plataea, the Athenian ships destroyed the enemy's  fleet near Cape Mycale in Asia Minor.    Thus did the first encounter between Asia and Europe end. Athens had  covered herself with glory and Sparta had fought bravely and well. If  these two cities had been able to come to an agreement, if they had been  willing to forget their little jealousies, they might have become the  leaders of a strong and united Hellas.    But alas, they allowed the hour of victory and enthusiasm to slip by,  and the same opportunity never returned.          ATHENS vs. SPARTA    HOW ATHENS AND SPARTA FOUGHT A LONG AND DISASTROUS WAR FOR THE  LEADERSHIP OF GREECE      ATHENS and Sparta were both Greek cities and their people spoke a common  language. In every other respect they were different. Athens rose high  from the plain. It was a city exposed to the fresh breezes from the sea,  willing to look at the world with the eyes of a happy child. Sparta, on  the other hand, was built at the bottom of a deep valley, and used the  surrounding mountains as a barrier against foreign thought. Athens was a  city of busy trade. Sparta was an armed camp where people were soldiers  for the sake of being soldiers. The people of Athens loved to sit in the  sun and discuss poetry or listen to the wise words of a philosopher.  The Spartans, on the other hand, never wrote a single line that was  considered literature, but they knew how to fight, they liked to fight,  and they sacrificed all human emotions to their ideal of military  preparedness.    No wonder that these sombre Spartans viewed the success of Athens with  malicious hate. The energy which the defence of the common home had  developed in Athens was now used for purposes of a more peaceful nature.  The Acropolis was rebuilt and was made into a marble shrine to the  Goddess Athena. Pericles, the leader of the Athenian democracy, sent far  and wide to find famous sculptors and painters and scientists to make  the city more beautiful and the young Athenians more worthy of their  home. At the same time he kept a watchful eye on Sparta and built high  walls which connected Athens with the sea and made her the strongest  fortress of that day.    An insignificant quarrel between two little Greek cities led to the  final conflict. For thirty years the war between Athens and Sparta  continued. It ended in a terrible disaster for Athens.    During the third year of the war the plague had entered the city. More  than half of the people and Pericles, the great leader, had been killed.  The plague was followed by a period of bad and untrustworthy leadership.

I went up there, hearing the dog in the yard bark after me all the way  while I climbed the stairs; and, looking as blank and strange upon the  room as the room looked upon me, sat down with my small hands crossed,  and thought.    I thought of the oddest things. Of the shape of the room, of the  cracks in the ceiling, of the paper on the walls, of the flaws in  the window-glass making ripples and dimples on the prospect, of the  washing-stand being rickety on its three legs, and having a discontented  something about it, which reminded me of Mrs. Gummidge under the  influence of the old one. I was crying all the time, but, except that I  was conscious of being cold and dejected, I am sure I never thought  why I cried. At last in my desolation I began to consider that I was  dreadfully in love with little Em'ly, and had been torn away from her to  come here where no one seemed to want me, or to care about me, half as  much as she did. This made such a very miserable piece of business of  it, that I rolled myself up in a corner of the counterpane, and cried  myself to sleep.    I was awoke by somebody saying 'Here he is!' and uncovering my hot head.  My mother and Peggotty had come to look for me, and it was one of them  who had done it.    'Davy,' said my mother. 'What's the matter?'    I thought it was very strange that she should ask me, and answered,  'Nothing.' I turned over on my face, I recollect, to hide my trembling  lip, which answered her with greater truth. 'Davy,' said my mother.  'Davy, my child!'    I dare say no words she could have uttered would have affected me  so much, then, as her calling me her child. I hid my tears in the  bedclothes, and pressed her from me with my hand, when she would have  raised me up.    'This is your doing, Peggotty, you cruel thing!' said my mother. 'I have  no doubt at all about it. How can you reconcile it to your conscience,  I wonder, to prejudice my own boy against me, or against anybody who is  dear to me? What do you mean by it, Peggotty?'    Poor Peggotty lifted up her hands and eyes, and only answered, in a  sort of paraphrase of the grace I usually repeated after dinner, 'Lord  forgive you, Mrs. Copperfield, and for what you have said this minute,  may you never be truly sorry!'    'It's enough to distract me,' cried my mother. 'In my honeymoon, too,  when my most inveterate enemy might relent, one would think, and not  envy me a little peace of mind and happiness. Davy, you naughty boy!  Peggotty, you savage creature! Oh, dear me!' cried my mother, turning  from one of us to the other, in her pettish wilful manner, 'what a  troublesome world this is, when one has the most right to expect it to  be as agreeable as possible!'    I felt the touch of a hand that I knew was neither hers nor Peggotty's,  and slipped to my feet at the bed-side. It was Mr. Murdstone's hand, and  he kept it on my arm as he said:    'What's this? Clara, my love, have you forgotten?--Firmness, my dear!'    'I am very sorry, Edward,' said my mother. 'I meant to be very good, but  I am so uncomfortable.'    'Indeed!' he answered. 'That's a bad hearing, so soon, Clara.'    'I say it's very hard I should be made so now,' returned my mother,  pouting; 'and it is--very hard--isn't it?'    He drew her to him, whispered in her ear, and kissed her. I knew as  well, when I saw my mother's head lean down upon his shoulder, and her  arm touch his neck--I knew as well that he could mould her pliant nature  into any form he chose, as I know, now, that he did it.    'Go you below, my love,' said Mr. Murdstone. 'David and I will come  down, together. My friend,' turning a darkening face on Peggotty, when  he had watched my mother out, and dismissed her with a nod and a smile;  'do you know your mistress's name?'    'She has been my mistress a long time, sir,' answered Peggotty, 'I ought  to know it.' 'That's true,' he answered. 'But I thought I heard you, as  I came upstairs, address her by a name that is not hers. She has taken  mine, you know. Will you remember that?'    Peggotty, with some uneasy glances at me, curtseyed herself out of the  room without replying; seeing, I suppose, that she was expected to go,  and had no excuse for remaining. When we two were left alone, he shut  the door, and sitting on a chair, and holding me standing before him,  looked steadily into my eyes. I felt my own attracted, no less steadily,  to his. As I recall our being opposed thus, face to face, I seem again  to hear my heart beat fast and high.    'David,' he said, making his lips thin, by pressing them together, 'if I  have an obstinate horse or dog to deal with, what do you think I do?'    'I don't know.'    'I beat him.'    I had answered in a kind of breathless whisper, but I felt, in my  silence, that my breath was shorter now.    'I make him wince, and smart. I say to myself, \"I'll conquer that  fellow\"; and if it were to cost him all the blood he had, I should do  it. What is that upon your face?'    'Dirt,' I said.    He knew it was the mark of tears as well as I. But if he had asked the  question twenty times, each time with twenty blows, I believe my baby  heart would have burst before I would have told him so.    'You have a good deal of intelligence for a little fellow,' he said,  with a grave smile that belonged to him, 'and you understood me very  well, I see. Wash that face, sir, and come down with me.'    He pointed to the washing-stand, which I had made out to be like Mrs.  Gummidge, and motioned me with his head to obey him directly. I had  little doubt then, and I have less doubt now, that he would have knocked  me down without the least compunction, if I had hesitated.    'Clara, my dear,' he said, when I had done his bidding, and he walked me  into the parlour, with his hand still on my arm; 'you will not be made  uncomfortable any more, I hope. We shall soon improve our youthful  humours.'    God help me, I might have been improved for my whole life, I might have  been made another creature perhaps, for life, by a kind word at that  season. A word of encouragement and explanation, of pity for my childish  ignorance, of welcome home, of reassurance to me that it was home, might  have made me dutiful to him in my heart henceforth, instead of in my  hypocritical outside, and might have made me respect instead of hate  him. I thought my mother was sorry to see me standing in the room so  scared and strange, and that, presently, when I stole to a chair, she  followed me with her eyes more sorrowfully still--missing, perhaps, some  freedom in my childish tread--but the word was not spoken, and the time  for it was gone.    We dined alone, we three together. He seemed to be very fond of my  mother--I am afraid I liked him none the better for that--and she was  very fond of him. I gathered from what they said, that an elder sister  of his was coming to stay with them, and that she was expected that  evening. I am not certain whether I found out then, or afterwards, that,  without being actively concerned in any business, he had some share in,  or some annual charge upon the profits of, a wine-merchant's house  in London, with which his family had been connected from his  great-grandfather's time, and in which his sister had a similar  interest; but I may mention it in this place, whether or no.    After dinner, when we were sitting by the fire, and I was meditating an  escape to Peggotty without having the hardihood to slip away, lest  it should offend the master of the house, a coach drove up to the  garden-gate and he went out to receive the visitor. My mother followed  him. I was timidly following her, when she turned round at the parlour  door, in the dusk, and taking me in her embrace as she had been used to  do, whispered me to love my new father and be obedient to him. She did  this hurriedly and secretly, as if it were wrong, but tenderly; and,  putting out her hand behind her, held mine in it, until we came near  to where he was standing in the garden, where she let mine go, and drew  hers through his arm.    It was Miss Murdstone who was arrived, and a gloomy-looking lady she  was; dark, like her brother, whom she greatly resembled in face and  voice; and with very heavy eyebrows, nearly meeting over her large nose,  as if, being disabled by the wrongs of her sex from wearing whiskers,  she had carried them to that account. She brought with her two  uncompromising hard black boxes, with her initials on the lids in hard  brass nails. When she paid the coachman she took her money out of a hard  steel purse, and she kept the purse in a very jail of a bag which hung  upon her arm by a heavy chain, and shut up like a bite. I had never, at  that time, seen such a metallic lady altogether as Miss Murdstone was.    She was brought into the parlour with many tokens of welcome, and there  formally recognized my mother as a new and near relation. Then she  looked at me, and said:    'Is that your boy, sister-in-law?'    My mother acknowledged me.    'Generally speaking,' said Miss Murdstone, 'I don't like boys. How d'ye  do, boy?'    Under these encouraging circumstances, I replied that I was very well,  and that I hoped she was the same; with such an indifferent grace, that  Miss Murdstone disposed of me in two words:    'Wants manner!'    Having uttered which, with great distinctness, she begged the favour of  being shown to her room, which became to me from that time forth a place  of awe and dread, wherein the two black boxes were never seen open or  known to be left unlocked, and where (for I peeped in once or twice when  she was out) numerous little steel fetters and rivets, with which Miss  Murdstone embellished herself when she was dressed, generally hung upon  the looking-glass in"]]]
