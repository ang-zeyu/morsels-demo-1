[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12539"],[0,"Observations Upon the Windward Coast of Africa (#12)"],[1," a counter, or pebble, &c. is put  down, representing every bar of merchandize, until the whole is exhausted,  when the palaver is finished; and, as they have very little idea of the  value of time, they will use every artifice of delay and chicane to gain a  bar.    In matters of less consequence they reckon with their fingers, by bending  the little finger of the right hand close to the palm, and the other  fingers in succession, proceeding to the left hand, concluding the  calculation by clapping both the hands together; and if it requires to be  extended, the same process is repeated.    Among the Foulahs in particular, commercial transactions are carried on  with extreme tardiness; a _palaver_ is held over every thing they have for  barter. The season in which they chiefly bring their trade to the coast is  during the dry months, and they generally travel in caravans, under the  control of a chief or head man. The head man of the party expects to be  lodged and accommodated by the factor, and before they enter upon business,  he expects the latter _to give him service_, or a present of kola,  Malaguetta pepper, tobacco, palm oil, and rice; if they eat of the kola,  and the present is not returned, the head man begins the trade, by making a  long speech, in which he magnifies the difficulties and dangers he has had  to surmount, &c.; mutual interpreters report this harangue. The trade for  rice is settled with little delay, but every tooth of ivory requires a new  palaver, and they will dispute for a whole day for a bar with the most  determined firmness.    When the palaver and trade is gone through, they again expect a present,  and if they are pleased with the factor, they march off singing his  praises, which they communicate to all they meet on the road.    The annual return from this commerce in colonial productions, has been from  _two_ to _three millions sterling_; for although large remittances have  been made in bills to the African merchants, yet these bills have been  provided for in produce by the planters. Politically considered, it will  appear, that its regeneration might have been more appropriately the  progressive work of time; and humanely viewed, it will also appear, from my  subsequent remarks, that by those means alone the African can be freed from  his shackles, and his condition efficaciously improved.    But to proceed with the intention of this chapter, I shall next make some  remarks on the religion, customs, and character of the natives of the  Windward Coast.    The natives on this part of the coast, and indeed throughout Africa, are in  general extremely superstitious; they believe in witchcraft, incantations,  and charms, and in certain Mahomedan doctrines, adopted from itinerant  devotees and priests of that persuasion, who are numerous among them, and  make a trade of selling charms. The Baggoes, Nellos, Susees, Timinees, &c.  occasionally worship and offer sacrifices to the Devil, and are equally  confused in their conception of the Supreme Being, of whose attributes they  entertain an assemblage of indistinct ideas, of which it is impossible to  give any clear description. They will tell the traveller with great apathy,  \"they never saw him, and if he live he be too good to hurt them.\" Their  acts of devotion are the consequence of fear alone, and are apparently  divested of any feelings of thankfulness or gratitude for the blessing they  receive from the good Spirit which they suppose to exist. The Devil, or  evil spirit, which they suppose to exist also, claims their attention from  the injury they suppose him capable of inflicting, and is worshipped under  a variety of forms; at one time in a grove, or under the shade of a large  tree, consecrated to his worship, they place, for the gratification of his  appetite; a _country mess_, a goat, or other offering of this nature, which  they may conceive to be acceptable to his divinity, who, however, is often  cozened out of the offering by some sacreligious and more corporeal  substance, to whose nature and wants it is more congenial; at some periods  great faith is attached to their _fetish_, as an antidote against evil; and  at others the alligator, the snake, the guava, and a number of other living  animals and inanimate substances are the objects of their worship. Like  other unenlightened nations, a variety of external beings supply the want  of the principles of Christianity; hence the counterfeit adoption and  substitution of corporate qualities as objects of external homage and  reverence.    _Fetish_, derived from the word _Feitico_, denotes witchcraft among the  majority of the maritime nations of Africa: this superstition is even  extended to some Europeans after a long residence in that country, and is  an expression of a compound meaning, forming an arrangement of various  figures, which constitute the objects of adoration, whether intellectually  conceived, or combined with corporeal substances; even the act of devotion  itself; or the various charms, incantations, and buffoonery of the priests  and fetish makers, who abound among them. In short, it is an incongruous  composition of any thing dedicated to the purpose; one kind of fetish is  formed of a piece of parchment containing an expression or sentence from  the Koran, which is associated with other substances, sewed up in a piece  of leather, and worn upon several parts of their bodies. Another kind is  placed over the doors of their huts, composed of distorted images besmeared  with palm oil, and stuck with feathers, some parts are tinged with blood,  and the whole is bedaubed with other preposterous applications.    _Ghresh_, or _Gresh_, is an expression in the Arabic tongue, meaning to  expel or drive away, and, as I apprehend, by the repetition of the word, is  the expression from which the African _gris-gris_ is derived, consisting of  exorcised feathers, cloth, &c., short sentences from the Koran, written on  parchment, and enclosed in small ornamented leathern cases, worn about  their persons, under the idea that it will keep away evil spirits, and is a  species of _fetish_.    The Mandingos, or book-men, are great _fetish_ makers, many of them being  well versed in the Arabic tongue, and writing it in a neat character. From  the impression of their superior learning and address, their influence and  numbers daily increase, many of them having become rulers and chiefs in  places where they sojourned as strangers, The religion they profess in  common with the Foolahs, Jolliffs, and other Mahomedan tribes, is  peculiarly adapted to the sensual effiminacy of the Africans: the doctrines  of Mahomet contained in their book I have procured from a very intelligent  chief in the Rio Pongo, and when I compare his account with others of his  nation on this part of the coast, the Foolahs, and the Mahomedan tribes in  the vicinity of the Island of Goree, I am persuaded the following is the  portion of the Islam faith believed by them.    1st. That God is above all, and not born of woman.    2d. That Mahomet stands between God and man, to intercede for him; that he  is superior to all beings born of woman, and is the favorite of God. And,    3d. That he has prepared for the meanest of his followers and believers  _seventy-two bouris_, or black-eyed girls of superior beauty, who are to  administer to all their pleasures, and participate with them in the  enjoyment of the fountains and groves of paradise, and in the gratification  of those appetites congenial to their nature and existence in this world.  This nearly amounts to the entire belief of Mahomet's doctrine, which is  nothing but a compound of this eternal truth and necessary fiction; namely,  \"that there is only one God, and Mahomet is the apostle of God:\" from  hence, in the idiom of the Koran, the belief of God is inseparable from the  apostolic character of Mahomet. The fertile and politic imagination of this  impostor admirably adapted his tenets to the prevailing and established  customs; he tolerates polygamy, &c. and to add to the sanctity of his  pernicious doctrines, he represents himself as having been visited by the  angel Gabriel, in the cave of Hera, where he communicated to him the  precepts of the Koran, in the month of Ramadan, which he enjoins as a fast;  he interdicts wine, and inculcates the necessity of praying five times a  day, facing the holy city, &c.; forming together a system of the most  insidious character towards the establishment of pure Christianity. In the  performance of the duties of their belief, the Mahomedan nations of Africa,  upon the coast, are exact and scrupulous, but they have no idea of the  intellectual doctrines of the Islam faith, or the happiness described by  Mahomet as enjoyed by superior saints in the beatitude of vision; they are  as perplexed on this subject as they are in their conceptions of the divine  nature, and discover a surprising contraction of mental powers, when  considered as human beings endowed with reason.    The nations, upon the Windward Coast, are in general little influenced by  belief in their actions. Forgiveness of injuries they conceive incompatible  with the nature of man; and a spirit of retaliation is very prevalent and  hereditary, descending in succession from father to son. They are extremely  jealous of white men, designing, ferocious, and cowardly; but there are,  notwithstanding, a great variety of localities existing among them, and it  will be found that their climate and habits are closely assimilated.    To the Africans, the indispensible articles of life are reduced to a very  narrow compass, and they are unacquainted with the insatiate wants of  Europeans. The heat of the climate renders cloathing an incumberance, and  occasions a carelessness with regard to their dwellings: for the former,  they require only a stripe of linen, and their _gris-gris_; while a  building of mud, covered with an interwoven and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12545"],[0,"Traditions of the Tinguian: a Study in Philippine Folk-Lore (#12)"],[1," arrived at  the well by the river I met a pretty girl whose name was Gimbangonan,  the daughter of It-tonagan of Natpangan. We chewed betel-nuts and  told our names, but as soon as she told her name she disappeared and  I could not see her. She said that she lived in Natpangan. I want to  marry her. Will you go and arrange the _pakalon?\"_ [125] So Langa-an  went at once and got her hat which was as large as the _salakasak_  [126] for she saw that Aponitolau was sorrowful.    When she took her hat it clucked. [127] \"Why does my hat cluck  when I take it down? I think they do not like you, Aponitolau,\"  said Langa-an. \"No, you go and try.\" So Langa-an went again to get  her hat and again it clucked, but nevertheless she took it and  went. When she was in the middle of the way the head of the hat  which was like a bird swung and made Langa-an turn her head and it  clucked again. Langa-an sat down by the trail and wondered what would  happen. Not long after she went on again and she met Asindamayan near  the ford. She asked where the ford was and when Asindamayan told her,  she spread her belt on the water and it ferried her across. Not long  after she reached the other side of the river, and she inquired for  the house of Gimbangonan. Asindamayan answered, \"You look for the  house where many people are putting props under the house. That is  the house of Gimbangonan. Her porch has many holes in it.\"    When Langa-an arrived at the house she said, \"Good afternoon.\" And  It-tonagan and Gimbangonan answered, \"Good afternoon.\" They invited  her to go up into the house and she went. \"Why do you come here,  Aunt?\" said Gimbangonan. \"I came to arrange for you to marry  Aponitolau, for he wants to marry you and has sent me to talk about  the _pakalon_.\" Gimbangonan was very happy and said to her mother,  \"You tell him yes, for I wish to marry Aponitolau.\" So It-tonagan  agreed to the marriage and Langa-an asked how much the marriage price  would be. \"The regular custom of the people with magical power which  is the _balaua_ nine times full,\" said Aldasan, because It-tonagan  was always restless and was walking outside the house. So Langa-an  left a little jar and agate bead, as a sign of the engagement, for  Gimbangonan. Not long after she went back home to Kadalayapan. When  she arrived where Aponitolau was lying down she said, \"_Wes_\" for she  was tired and Aponitolau heard her and he went and inquired what was  the matter. His mother answered that they had agreed on the marriage  and the next day he could go and marry Gimbangonan.    As soon as the next day came they prepared jars of _basi_, [128] and  pigs to be carried to Natpangan, and Aponitolau carried one large  empty jar. [129] So they went. As soon as they arrived Aponitolau  asked where Gimbangonan was, and the people said, \"Look at the big  woman.\" He looked and saw that she was a very big woman and Aponitolau  cried, for she was not the girl he had seen before, and he bent his  head. While the old men were talking to each other Gimbangonan said  to Aponitolau, \"Come here, Aponitolau. Be very happy. Why do you bend  your head?\" Aponitolau did not listen, and he did not go. Not long  after Langa-an and the others went back home and left Aponitolau to  be joined to Gimbangonan. Aponitolau was afraid to go to Gimbangonan,  for she was a very big woman. She called to him all the time, but he  did not go to her. It-tonagan was restless and did not stay in the  house even in the night, and they could not sleep.    After ten days Aponitolau said, \"I am going to Kadalayapan for a  little while. I will return soon.\" \"If you go to Kadalayapan I will  go with you,\" she said. \"Do not go this time and I will take you next  time,\" he said, and he went. When he was near the gate of the town of  Kadalayapan he hung his head until he reached his house. His mother  asked why he hung his head. \"I do not wish to marry Gimbangonan for  she is not the woman I met by the river.\" \"Do not be angry with me for  I did what you wished. I would not have engaged you to Gimbangonan  if you had not sent me.\" They sent their _liblibayan_ [130] to go  and get betel-nuts which were covered with gold, for they intended  to make _Sayang_, so that they could find out who the woman was who  had been by the river. Soon the _liblibayan_ returned and they said,  \"We did not get the betel-nuts which you desired for we found a pretty  toy among the branches of the tree.\" Aponitolau took the branch of the  tree which shone as if covered with fire and he put a blanket on it  and many pillows around it. As soon as they had again commanded the  _liblibayan_ to get the betel-nuts they went and soon they arrived  with the fruit. They oiled the betel-nuts and sent them to every  place in the world and if anyone refused to come they were to grow  on their knees. Not long after the betel-nuts went to the different  towns and invited all the people.    When they arrived they danced and Aponitolau looked at them to see if  the woman he met at the river was there, but she was not among them,  and he wondered what had become of the woman, for the betel-nuts had  gone to all parts of the world. Aponitolau went into the house for  he was sorrowful, and he laid down near the blankets and he noticed  that the blankets appeared as if on fire and he was frightened. [131]  He got up and unwrapped the blankets and he saw a pretty girl. \"I  did not think you were here. I have been engaged. You said your  name was Gimbangonan, and I sent my mother to engage me to you, but  when I saw Gimbangonan she was a big woman so I left her and came  here to make _balaua_ so I might find you. You cannot escape from  me now for I shall hold your hand. Let us chew betel-nut.\" So they  chewed and Aponitolau said, \"My name is Aponitolau of Kadalayapan  who is the son of Langa-an and Pagbokasan to whom you told a lie  for you said you were Gimbangonan, and now I want to know your real  name.\" \"My name is Aponibolinayen of Natpangan who is the daughter  of Ebang and Pagatipanan.\" When they had told their names they saw  that they were related and that they both possessed magical power,  so they were married.    After three days, Aponitolau said to Aponibolinayen, \"Wait for me in  the house. Do not be lonesome, for our mother is here. I am going to  see my pasture.\" \"Do not stay long,\" said Aponibolinayen. \"If anyone  comes you hide in the house,\" said Aponitolau. Not long after he  went and when he arrived in the pasture all the jars went around him  and all the jars stuck out their tongues for they were very hungry  for they had not been fed for a long time. The jars were _somadag,  ginlasan, malayo_, and _tadogan_, and other kinds also. [132] When  Aponitolau thought that all the jars had arrived where he was he fed  them with betel-nut, first covered with _lawed_ [133] leaves. As  soon as he had fed them he gave them some salt. Not long after he  went back home and he rode on a carabao.    When he arrived at their house he called to Aponibolinayen, but no one  answered him and he was surprised. So he hurried to the house and he  saw that Aponibolinayen was dead and he was grieved. He took her in his  lap and while her body was in his lap it began to sweat. He used his  power so that when he whipped [134] his perfume _banawes_ she said,  \"_Wes_.\" When he whipped his perfume _dagimonau_ she awoke. When he  whipped his perfume _alikadakad_ she stood up and said, \"I told you not  to go, Aponitolau, but you went anyway. A big woman came here and stole  all my things and killed me. I don't know who she was.\" Aponitolau  called his mother and asked who it was and his mother replied that  it was Gimbangonan. So Aponitolau went to Natpangan. \"Why did you go  to kill Aponibolinayen?\" \"I went to kill her for you do not care for  me any more.\" \"I do not like you, for you are a very big woman. Every  time you step the floor is broken. If you come again to Kadalayapan I  will cut your head off. Do not come again to harm Aponibolinayen.\" He  went home to Kadalayapan and he divorced Gimbangonan.    Not long after they went to the pasture and they rode on the back of a  carabao. As soon as they arrived, all the jars rolled around them and  stuck out their tongues and Aponibolinayen was afraid, for she feared  the jars would eat them. The wide field was full of jars. Aponitolau  gave them betel-nut and _lawed_ vine and salt. As soon as they fed them  they went back home. Not long after Aponibolinayen said to Aponitolau,  \"We are going to Natpangan to visit my father and mother,\" so they  went. As soon as they arrived there Aponibolinayen told her father and  mother that Aponitolau had a pasture filled with many different kinds  of jars, in the place of Kabinalan. When they had been in Natpangan  ten days they returned home and Aponibolinayen's father and mother  went with them and saw the jars. When they reached the field where  the jars were they were afraid that the jars would eat them, but  Aponitolau fed them. The father and mother of Aponibolinayen were  surprised for there were many valuable jars which filled the wide  field of Kabinalan. Not long after they went back home to Natpangan.    (Told by Angtan, a woman of Lagangilang.)            4    \"Sinogyaman, come and oil my hair so that I can go to war,\" said  Aponitolau. \"And you, Sinagayan, put some rice in the pot and cook  it, and also some fish for us to eat.\" Not long after she cooked,  and Sinogyaman oiled his hair. When Sinagayan finished cooking they  ate and started to go to Gegenawan where Asibowan lived. Sinogyaman  and Sinagayan did not want him to go, but Aponitolau went anyway.    When he arrived at the edge of the town he stood still a long time,  for he did not know the way to Gegenawan. A bird went to him and said,  \"Why do you stand here for a long time, Aponitolau?\" \"Why do you stand  a long time, you say, and I am going to the town of Asibowan, whom  every one says is a"]]]
