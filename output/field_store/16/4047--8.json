My guide already seated on the haunch  Of the fierce animal I found; and thus  He me encourag'd.  \"Be thou stout; be bold.  Down such a steep flight must we now descend!  Mount thou before: for that no power the tail  May have to harm thee, I will be i' th' midst.\"    As one, who hath an ague fit so near,  His nails already are turn'd blue, and he  Quivers all o'er, if he but eye the shade;  Such was my cheer at hearing of his words.  But shame soon interpos'd her threat, who makes  The servant bold in presence of his lord.    I settled me upon those shoulders huge,  And would have said, but that the words to aid  My purpose came not, \"Look thou clasp me firm!\"    But he whose succour then not first I prov'd,  Soon as I mounted, in his arms aloft,  Embracing, held me up, and thus he spake:  \"Geryon! now move thee! be thy wheeling gyres  Of ample circuit, easy thy descent.  Think on th' unusual burden thou sustain'st.\"    As a small vessel, back'ning out from land,  Her station quits; so thence the monster loos'd,  And when he felt himself at large, turn'd round  There where the breast had been, his forked tail.  Thus, like an eel, outstretch'd at length he steer'd,  Gath'ring the air up with retractile claws.    Not greater was the dread when Phaeton  The reins let drop at random, whence high heaven,  Whereof signs yet appear, was wrapt in flames;  Nor when ill-fated Icarus perceiv'd,  By liquefaction of the scalded wax,  The trusted pennons loosen'd from his loins,  His sire exclaiming loud, \"Ill way thou keep'st!\"  Than was my dread, when round me on each part  The air I view'd, and other object none  Save the fell beast.  He slowly sailing, wheels  His downward motion, unobserv'd of me,  But that the wind, arising to my face,  Breathes on me from below.  Now on our right  I heard the cataract beneath us leap  With hideous crash; whence bending down to' explore,  New terror I conceiv'd at the steep plunge:    For flames I saw, and wailings smote mine ear:  So that all trembling close I crouch'd my limbs,  And then distinguish'd, unperceiv'd before,  By the dread torments that on every side  Drew nearer, how our downward course we wound.    As falcon, that hath long been on the wing,  But lure nor bird hath seen, while in despair  The falconer cries, \"Ah me! thou stoop'st to earth!\"  Wearied descends, and swiftly down the sky  In many an orbit wheels, then lighting sits  At distance from his lord in angry mood;  So Geryon lighting places us on foot  Low down at base of the deep-furrow'd rock,  And, of his burden there discharg'd, forthwith  Sprang forward, like an arrow from the string.          CANTO XVIII    THERE is a place within the depths of hell  Call'd Malebolge, all of rock dark-stain'd  With hue ferruginous, e'en as the steep  That round it circling winds.  Right in the midst  Of that abominable region, yawns  A spacious gulf profound, whereof the frame  Due time shall tell.  The circle, that remains,  Throughout its round, between the gulf and base  Of the high craggy banks, successive forms  Ten trenches, in its hollow bottom sunk.    As where to guard the walls, full many a foss  Begirds some stately castle, sure defence  Affording to the space within, so here  Were model'd these; and as like fortresses  E'en from their threshold to the brink without,  Are flank'd with bridges; from the rock's low base  Thus flinty paths advanc'd, that 'cross the moles  And dikes, struck onward far as to the gulf,  That in one bound collected cuts them off.  Such was the place, wherein we found ourselves  From Geryon's back dislodg'd. The bard to left  Held on his way, and I behind him mov'd.    On our right hand new misery I saw,  New pains, new executioners of wrath,  That swarming peopled the first chasm.  Below  Were naked sinners.  Hitherward they came,  Meeting our faces from the middle point,  With us beyond but with a larger stride.  E'en thus the Romans, when the year returns  Of Jubilee, with better speed to rid  The thronging multitudes, their means devise  For such as pass the bridge; that on one side  All front toward the castle, and approach  Saint Peter's fane, on th' other towards the mount.    Each divers way along the grisly rock,  Horn'd demons I beheld, with lashes huge,  That on their back unmercifully smote.  Ah! how they made them bound at the first stripe!    None for the second waited nor the third.    Meantime as on I pass'd, one met my sight  Whom soon as view'd; \"Of him,\" cried I, \"not yet  Mine eye hath had his fill.\"  With fixed gaze  I therefore scann'd him.  Straight the teacher kind  Paus'd with me, and consented I should walk  Backward a space, and the tormented spirit,  Who thought to hide him, bent his visage down.  But it avail'd him nought; for I exclaim'd:  \"Thou who dost cast thy eye upon the ground,  Unless thy features do belie thee much,  Venedico art thou.  But what brings thee  Into this bitter seas'ning?\" He replied:  \"Unwillingly I answer to thy words.  But thy clear speech, that to my mind recalls  The world I once inhabited, constrains me.  Know then 'twas I who led fair Ghisola  To do the Marquis' will, however fame  The shameful tale have bruited.  Nor alone  Bologna hither sendeth me to mourn  Rather with us the place is so o'erthrong'd  That not so many tongues this day are taught,  Betwixt the Reno and Savena's stream,  To answer SIPA in their country's phrase.  And if of that securer proof thou need,  Remember but our craving thirst for gold.\"    Him speaking thus, a demon with his thong  Struck, and exclaim'd, \"Away! corrupter! here  Women are none for sale.\"  Forthwith I join'd  My escort, and few paces thence we came  To where a rock forth issued from the bank.  That easily ascended, to the right  Upon its splinter turning, we depart  From those eternal barriers. When arriv'd,  Where underneath the gaping arch lets pass  The scourged souls: \"Pause here,\" the teacher said,  \"And let these others miserable, now  Strike on thy ken, faces not yet beheld,  For that together they with us have walk'd.\"    From the old bridge we ey'd the pack, who came  From th' other side towards us, like the rest,  Excoriate from the lash.  My gentle guide,  By me unquestion'd, thus his speech resum'd:  \"Behold that lofty shade, who this way tends,  And seems too woe-begone to drop a tear.  How yet the regal aspect he retains!  Jason is he, whose skill and prowess won  The ram from Colchos. To the Lemnian isle  His passage thither led him, when those bold  And pitiless women had slain all their males.  There he with tokens and fair witching words  Hypsipyle beguil'd, a virgin young,  Who first had all the rest herself beguil'd.  Impregnated he left her there forlorn.  Such is the guilt condemns him to this pain.  Here too Medea's inj'ries are avenged.  All bear him company, who like deceit  To his have practis'd.  And thus much to know  Of the first vale suffice thee, and of those  Whom its keen torments urge.\"  Now had we come  Where, crossing the next pier, the straighten'd path  Bestrides its shoulders to another arch.    Hence in the second chasm we heard the ghosts,  Who jibber in low melancholy sounds,  With wide-stretch'd nostrils snort, and on themselves  Smite with their palms.  Upon the banks a scurf  From the foul steam condens'd, encrusting hung,  That held sharp combat with the sight and smell.    So hollow is the depth, that from no part,  Save on the summit of the rocky span,  Could I distinguish aught.  Thus far we came;  And thence I saw, within the foss below,  A crowd immers'd in ordure, that appear'd  Draff of the human body.  There beneath  Searching with eye inquisitive, I mark'd  One with his head so grim'd, 't were hard to deem,  If he were clerk or layman.  Loud he cried:  \"Why greedily thus bendest more on me,  Than on these other filthy ones, thy ken?\"    \"Because if true my mem'ry,\" I replied,  \"I heretofore have seen thee with dry locks,  And thou Alessio art of Lucca sprung.  Therefore than all the rest I scan thee more.\"    Then beating on his brain these words he spake:  \"Me thus low down my flatteries have sunk,  Wherewith I ne'er enough could glut my tongue.\"    My leader thus: \"A little further stretch  Thy face, that thou the visage well mayst note  Of that besotted, sluttish courtezan,  Who there doth rend her with defiled nails,  Now crouching down, now risen on her feet.    \"Thais is this, the harlot, whose false lip  Answer'd her doting paramour that ask'd,  'Thankest me much!'--'Say rather wondrously,'  And seeing this here satiate be our view.\"          CANTO XIX    WOE to thee, Simon Magus! woe to you,  His wretched followers! who the things of God,  Which should be wedded unto goodness, them,  Rapacious as ye are, do prostitute  For gold and silver in adultery!  Now must the trumpet sound for you, since yours  Is the third chasm.  Upon the following vault  We now had mounted, where the rock impends  Directly o'er the centre of the foss.    Wisdom Supreme! how wonderful the art,  Which thou dost manifest in heaven, in earth,  And in the evil world, how just a meed  Allotting by thy virtue unto all!    I saw the livid stone, throughout the sides  And in its bottom full of apertures,  All equal in their width, and circular each,  Nor ample less nor larger they appear'd  Than in Saint John's fair dome of me belov'd  Those fram'd to hold the pure baptismal streams,  One of the which I brake, some few years past,  To save a whelming infant; and be this  A seal to undeceive whoever doubts  The motive of my deed.  From out the mouth  Of every one, emerg'd a sinner's feet  And of the legs high upward as the calf  The rest beneath was hid.  On either foot  The soles were burning, whence the flexile joints  Glanc'd with such violent motion, as had snapt  Asunder cords or twisted withs.  As flame,  Feeding on unctuous matter, glides along  The surface, scarcely touching where it moves;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8795"],[0,"The Divine Comedy (#11)"],[1," us of ourselves, we take no mark  Though round about us thousand trumpets clang!  What moves thee, if the senses stir not?  Light  Kindled in heav'n, spontaneous, self-inform'd,  Or likelier gliding down with swift illapse  By will divine.  Portray'd before me came  The traces of her dire impiety,  Whose form was chang'd into the bird, that most  Delights itself in song: and here my mind  Was inwardly so wrapt, it gave no place  To aught that ask'd admittance from without.    Next shower'd into my fantasy a shape  As of one crucified, whose visage spake  Fell rancour, malice deep, wherein he died;  And round him Ahasuerus the great king,  Esther his bride, and Mordecai the just,  Blameless in word and deed.  As of itself  That unsubstantial coinage of the brain  Burst, like a bubble, Which the water fails  That fed it; in my vision straight uprose  A damsel weeping loud, and cried, \"O queen!  O mother! wherefore has intemperate ire  Driv'n thee to loath thy being?  Not to lose  Lavinia, desp'rate thou hast slain thyself.  Now hast thou lost me.  I am she, whose tears  Mourn, ere I fall, a mother's timeless end.\"    E'en as a sleep breaks off, if suddenly  New radiance strike upon the closed lids,  The broken slumber quivering ere it dies;  Thus from before me sunk that imagery  Vanishing, soon as on my face there struck  The light, outshining far our earthly beam.  As round I turn'd me to survey what place  I had arriv'd at, \"Here ye mount,\" exclaim'd  A voice, that other purpose left me none,  Save will so eager to behold who spake,  I could not choose but gaze.  As 'fore the sun,  That weighs our vision down, and veils his form  In light transcendent, thus my virtue fail'd  Unequal.  \"This is Spirit from above,  Who marshals us our upward way, unsought;  And in his own light shrouds him.  As a man  Doth for himself, so now is done for us.  For whoso waits imploring, yet sees need  Of his prompt aidance, sets himself prepar'd  For blunt denial, ere the suit be made.  Refuse we not to lend a ready foot  At such inviting: haste we to ascend,  Before it darken: for we may not then,  Till morn again return.\"  So spake my guide;  And to one ladder both address'd our steps;  And the first stair approaching, I perceiv'd  Near me as 'twere the waving of a wing,  That fann'd my face and whisper'd: \"Blessed they  The peacemakers: they know not evil wrath.\"    Now to such height above our heads were rais'd  The last beams, follow'd close by hooded night,  That many a star on all sides through the gloom  Shone out.  \"Why partest from me, O my strength?\"  So with myself I commun'd; for I felt  My o'ertoil'd sinews slacken.  We had reach'd  The summit, and were fix'd like to a bark  Arriv'd at land.  And waiting a short space,  If aught should meet mine ear in that new round,  Then to my guide I turn'd, and said: \"Lov'd sire!  Declare what guilt is on this circle purg'd.  If our feet rest, no need thy speech should pause.\"    He thus to me: \"The love of good, whate'er  Wanted of just proportion, here fulfils.  Here plies afresh the oar, that loiter'd ill.  But that thou mayst yet clearlier understand,  Give ear unto my words, and thou shalt cull  Some fruit may please thee well, from this delay.    \"Creator, nor created being, ne'er,  My son,\" he thus began, \"was without love,  Or natural, or the free spirit's growth.  Thou hast not that to learn.  The natural still  Is without error; but the other swerves,  If on ill object bent, or through excess  Of vigour, or defect.  While e'er it seeks  The primal blessings, or with measure due  Th' inferior, no delight, that flows from it,  Partakes of ill.  But let it warp to evil,  Or with more ardour than behooves, or less.  Pursue the good, the thing created then  Works 'gainst its Maker.  Hence thou must infer  That love is germin of each virtue in ye,  And of each act no less, that merits pain.  Now since it may not be, but love intend  The welfare mainly of the thing it loves,  All from self-hatred are secure; and since  No being can be thought t' exist apart  And independent of the first, a bar  Of equal force restrains from hating that.    \"Grant the distinction just; and it remains  The' evil must be another's, which is lov'd.  Three ways such love is gender'd in your clay.  There is who hopes (his neighbour's worth deprest,)  Preeminence himself, and coverts hence  For his own greatness that another fall.  There is who so much fears the loss of power,  Fame, favour, glory (should his fellow mount  Above him), and so sickens at the thought,  He loves their opposite: and there is he,  Whom wrong or insult seems to gall and shame  That he doth thirst for vengeance, and such needs  Must doat on other's evil.  Here beneath  This threefold love is mourn'd.  Of th' other sort  Be now instructed, that which follows good  But with disorder'd and irregular course.    \"All indistinctly apprehend a bliss  On which the soul may rest, the hearts of all  Yearn after it, and to that wished bourn  All therefore strive to tend.  If ye behold  Or seek it with a love remiss and lax,  This cornice after just repenting lays  Its penal torment on ye.  Other good  There is, where man finds not his happiness:  It is not true fruition, not that blest  Essence, of every good the branch and root.  The love too lavishly bestow'd on this,  Along three circles over us, is mourn'd.  Account of that division tripartite  Expect not, fitter for thine own research.\"          CANTO XVIII    The teacher ended, and his high discourse  Concluding, earnest in my looks inquir'd  If I appear'd content; and I, whom still  Unsated thirst to hear him urg'd, was mute,  Mute outwardly, yet inwardly I said:  \"Perchance my too much questioning offends\"  But he, true father, mark'd the secret wish  By diffidence restrain'd, and speaking, gave  Me boldness thus to speak: 'Master, my Sight  Gathers so lively virtue from thy beams,  That all, thy words convey, distinct is seen.  Wherefore I pray thee, father, whom this heart  Holds dearest! thou wouldst deign by proof t' unfold  That love, from which as from their source thou bring'st  All good deeds and their opposite.'\"  He then:  \"To what I now disclose be thy clear ken  Directed, and thou plainly shalt behold  How much those blind have err'd, who make themselves  The guides of men.  The soul, created apt  To love, moves versatile which way soe'er  Aught pleasing prompts her, soon as she is wak'd  By pleasure into act.  Of substance true  Your apprehension forms its counterfeit,  And in you the ideal shape presenting  Attracts the soul's regard.  If she, thus drawn,  incline toward it, love is that inclining,  And a new nature knit by pleasure in ye.  Then as the fire points up, and mounting seeks  His birth-place and his lasting seat, e'en thus  Enters the captive soul into desire,  Which is a spiritual motion, that ne'er rests  Before enjoyment of the thing it loves.  Enough to show thee, how the truth from those  Is hidden, who aver all love a thing  Praise-worthy in itself: although perhaps  Its substance seem still good.  Yet if the wax  Be good, it follows not th' impression must.\"  \"What love is,\" I return'd, \"thy words, O guide!  And my own docile mind, reveal.  Yet thence  New doubts have sprung.  For from without if love  Be offer'd to us, and the spirit knows  No other footing, tend she right or wrong,  Is no desert of hers.\"  He answering thus:  \"What reason here discovers I have power  To show thee: that which lies beyond, expect  From Beatrice, faith not reason's task.  Spirit, substantial form, with matter join'd  Not in confusion mix'd, hath in itself  Specific virtue of that union born,  Which is not felt except it work, nor prov'd  But through effect, as vegetable life  By the green leaf.  From whence his intellect  Deduced its primal notices of things,  Man therefore knows not, or his appetites  Their first affections; such in you, as zeal  In bees to gather honey; at the first,  Volition, meriting nor blame nor praise.  But o'er each lower faculty supreme,  That as she list are summon'd to her bar,  Ye have that virtue in you, whose just voice  Uttereth counsel, and whose word should keep  The threshold of assent.  Here is the source,  Whence cause of merit in you is deriv'd,  E'en as the affections good or ill she takes,  Or severs, winnow'd as the chaff.  Those men  Who reas'ning went to depth profoundest, mark'd  That innate freedom, and were thence induc'd  To leave their moral teaching to the world.  Grant then, that from necessity arise  All love that glows within you; to dismiss  Or harbour it, the pow'r is in yourselves.  Remember, Beatrice, in her style,  Denominates free choice by eminence  The noble virtue, if in talk with thee  She touch upon that theme.\"  The moon, well nigh  To midnight hour belated, made the stars  Appear to wink and fade; and her broad disk  Seem'd like a crag on fire, as up the vault  That course she journey'd, which the sun then warms,  When they of Rome behold him at his set.  Betwixt Sardinia and the Corsic isle.  And now the weight, that hung upon my thought,  Was lighten'd by the aid of that clear spirit,  Who raiseth Andes above Mantua's name.  I therefore, when my questions had obtain'd  Solution plain and ample, stood as one  Musing in dreary slumber; but not long  Slumber'd; for suddenly a multitude,    The steep already turning, from behind,  Rush'd on.  With fury and like random rout,  As echoing on their shores at midnight heard  Ismenus and Asopus, for his Thebes  If Bacchus' help were needed; so came these  Tumultuous, curving each his rapid step,  By eagerness impell'd of holy love.    Soon they o'ertook us; with such swiftness mov'd  The mighty crowd.  Two spirits at their head  Cried weeping; \"Blessed Mary sought with haste  The hilly region.  Caesar to subdue  Ilerda, darted in Marseilles his sting,  And flew to Spain.\"--\"Oh tarry not: away;\"  The others shouted; \"let not time be lost  Through"]]]
