Therefore my will  Were satisfied to know the lot awaits me,  The arrow, seen beforehand, slacks its flight.\"    So said I to the brightness, which erewhile  To me had spoken, and my will declar'd,  As Beatrice will'd, explicitly.  Nor with oracular response obscure,  Such, as or ere the Lamb of God was slain,  Beguil'd the credulous nations; but, in terms  Precise and unambiguous lore, replied  The spirit of paternal love, enshrin'd,  Yet in his smile apparent; and thus spake:  \"Contingency, unfolded not to view  Upon the tablet of your mortal mold,  Is all depictur'd in the' eternal sight;  But hence deriveth not necessity,  More then the tall ship, hurried down the flood,  Doth from the vision, that reflects the scene.  From thence, as to the ear sweet harmony  From organ comes, so comes before mine eye  The time prepar'd for thee.  Such as driv'n out  From Athens, by his cruel stepdame's wiles,  Hippolytus departed, such must thou  Depart from Florence.  This they wish, and this  Contrive, and will ere long effectuate, there,  Where gainful merchandize is made of Christ,  Throughout the livelong day.  The common cry,  Will, as 't is ever wont, affix the blame  Unto the party injur'd: but the truth  Shall, in the vengeance it dispenseth, find  A faithful witness.  Thou shall leave each thing  Belov'd most dearly: this is the first shaft  Shot from the bow of exile.  Thou shalt prove  How salt the savour is of other's bread,  How hard the passage to descend and climb  By other's stairs, But that shall gall thee most  Will be the worthless and vile company,  With whom thou must be thrown into these straits.  For all ungrateful, impious all and mad,  Shall turn 'gainst thee: but in a little while  Theirs and not thine shall be the crimson'd brow  Their course shall so evince their brutishness  T' have ta'en thy stand apart shall well become thee.    \"First refuge thou must find, first place of rest,  In the great Lombard's courtesy, who bears  Upon the ladder perch'd the sacred bird.  He shall behold thee with such kind regard,  That 'twixt ye two, the contrary to that  Which falls 'twixt other men, the granting shall  Forerun the asking.  With him shalt thou see  That mortal, who was at his birth impress  So strongly from this star, that of his deeds  The nations shall take note.  His unripe age  Yet holds him from observance; for these wheels  Only nine years have compass him about.  But, ere the Gascon practice on great Harry,  Sparkles of virtue shall shoot forth in him,  In equal scorn of labours and of gold.  His bounty shall be spread abroad so widely,  As not to let the tongues e'en of his foes  Be idle in its praise.  Look thou to him  And his beneficence: for he shall cause  Reversal of their lot to many people,  Rich men and beggars interchanging fortunes.  And thou shalt bear this written in thy soul  Of him, but tell it not;\" and things he told  Incredible to those who witness them;  Then added: \"So interpret thou, my son,  What hath been told thee.--Lo! the ambushment  That a few circling seasons hide for thee!  Yet envy not thy neighbours: time extends  Thy span beyond their treason's chastisement.\"    Soon, as the saintly spirit, by his silence,  Had shown the web, which I had streteh'd for him  Upon the warp, was woven, I began,  As one, who in perplexity desires  Counsel of other, wise, benign and friendly:  \"My father! well I mark how time spurs on  Toward me, ready to inflict the blow,  Which falls most heavily on him, who most  Abandoned himself.  Therefore 't is good  I should forecast, that driven from the place  Most dear to me, I may not lose myself  All others by my song.  Down through the world  Of infinite mourning, and along the mount  From whose fair height my lady's eyes did lift me,  And after through this heav'n from light to light,  Have I learnt that, which if I tell again,  It may with many woefully disrelish;  And, if I am a timid friend to truth,  I fear my life may perish among those,  To whom these days shall be of ancient date.\"    The brightness, where enclos'd the treasure smil'd,  Which I had found there, first shone glisteningly,  Like to a golden mirror in the sun;  Next answer'd: \"Conscience, dimm'd or by its own  Or other's shame, will feel thy saying sharp.  Thou, notwithstanding, all deceit remov'd,  See the whole vision be made manifest.  And let them wince who have their withers wrung.  What though, when tasted first, thy voice shall prove  Unwelcome, on digestion it will turn  To vital nourishment.  The cry thou raisest,  Shall, as the wind doth, smite the proudest summits;  Which is of honour no light argument,  For this there only have been shown to thee,  Throughout these orbs, the mountain, and the deep,  Spirits, whom fame hath note of.  For the mind  Of him, who hears, is loth to acquiesce  And fix its faith, unless the instance brought  Be palpable, and proof apparent urge.\"          CANTO XVIII    CANTO XVIII    Now in his word, sole, ruminating, joy'd  That blessed spirit; and I fed on mine,  Tempting the sweet with bitter: she meanwhile,  Who led me unto God, admonish'd: \"Muse  On other thoughts: bethink thee, that near Him  I dwell, who recompenseth every wrong.\"    At the sweet sounds of comfort straight I turn'd;  And, in the saintly eyes what love was seen,  I leave in silence here: nor through distrust  Of my words only, but that to such bliss  The mind remounts not without aid.  Thus much  Yet may I speak; that, as I gaz'd on her,  Affection found no room for other wish.  While the everlasting pleasure, that did full  On Beatrice shine, with second view  From her fair countenance my gladden'd soul  Contented; vanquishing me with a beam  Of her soft smile, she spake: \"Turn thee, and list.  These eyes are not thy only Paradise.\"    As here we sometimes in the looks may see  Th' affection mark'd, when that its sway hath ta'en  The spirit wholly; thus the hallow'd light,  To whom I turn'd, flashing, bewray'd its will  To talk yet further with me, and began:  \"On this fifth lodgment of the tree, whose life  Is from its top, whose fruit is ever fair  And leaf unwith'ring, blessed spirits abide,  That were below, ere they arriv'd in heav'n,  So mighty in renown, as every muse  Might grace her triumph with them.  On the horns  Look therefore of the cross: he, whom I name,  Shall there enact, as doth in summer cloud  Its nimble fire.\"  Along the cross I saw,  At the repeated name of Joshua,  A splendour gliding; nor, the word was said,  Ere it was done: then, at the naming saw  Of the great Maccabee, another move  With whirling speed; and gladness was the scourge  Unto that top.  The next for Charlemagne  And for the peer Orlando, two my gaze  Pursued, intently, as the eye pursues  A falcon flying.  Last, along the cross,  William, and Renard, and Duke Godfrey drew  My ken, and Robert Guiscard.  And the soul,  Who spake with me among the other lights  Did move away, and mix; and with the choir  Of heav'nly songsters prov'd his tuneful skill.    To Beatrice on my right l bent,  Looking for intimation or by word  Or act, what next behoov'd; and did descry  Such mere effulgence in her eyes, such joy,  It past all former wont.  And, as by sense  Of new delight, the man, who perseveres  In good deeds doth perceive from day to day  His virtue growing; I e'en thus perceiv'd  Of my ascent, together with the heav'n  The circuit widen'd, noting the increase  Of beauty in that wonder.  Like the change  In a brief moment on some maiden's cheek,  Which from its fairness doth discharge the weight  Of pudency, that stain'd it; such in her,  And to mine eyes so sudden was the change,  Through silvery whiteness of that temperate star,  Whose sixth orb now enfolded us.  I saw,  Within that Jovial cresset, the clear sparks  Of love, that reign'd there, fashion to my view  Our language.  And as birds, from river banks  Arisen, now in round, now lengthen'd troop,  Array them in their flight, greeting, as seems,  Their new-found pastures; so, within the lights,  The saintly creatures flying, sang, and made  Now D. now I. now L. figur'd I' th' air.    First, singing, to their notes they mov'd, then one  Becoming of these signs, a little while  Did rest them, and were mute.  O nymph divine  Of Pegasean race! whose souls, which thou  Inspir'st, mak'st glorious and long-liv'd, as they  Cities and realms by thee! thou with thyself  Inform me; that I may set forth the shapes,  As fancy doth present them.  Be thy power  Display'd in this brief song.  The characters,  Vocal and consonant, were five-fold seven.  In order each, as they appear'd, I mark'd.  Diligite Justitiam, the first,  Both verb and noun all blazon'd; and the extreme  Qui judicatis terram.  In the M.  Of the fifth word they held their station,  Making the star seem silver streak'd with gold.  And on the summit of the M. I saw  Descending other lights, that rested there,  Singing, methinks, their bliss and primal good.  Then, as at shaking of a lighted brand,  Sparkles innumerable on all sides  Rise scatter'd, source of augury to th' unwise;  Thus more than thousand twinkling lustres hence  Seem'd reascending, and a higher pitch  Some mounting, and some less; e'en as the sun,  Which kindleth them, decreed.  And when each one  Had settled in his place, the head and neck  Then saw I of an eagle, lively  Grav'd in that streaky fire.  Who painteth there,  Hath none to guide him; of himself he guides;  And every line and texture of the nest  Doth own from him the virtue, fashions it.

But the Lord of Rays was not a man to abide patiently their lingering  processes. Pleased with their comfortable quarters, they jogged on from  day to day, and would have done so for years, had they been permitted.  But he suddenly dismissed them all, with the exception of the Italian  Prelati, and the physician of Poitou. These he retained to aid him to  discover the secret of the philosopher's stone by a bolder method. The  Poitousan had persuaded him that the devil was the great depositary of  that and all other secrets, and that he would raise him before Gilles,  who might enter into any contract he pleased with him. Gilles expressed  his readiness, and promised to give the devil anything but his soul, or  do any deed that the arch-enemy might impose upon him. Attended solely  by the physician, he proceeded at midnight to a wild-looking place in  a neighbouring forest; the physician drew a magic circle around them  on the sward, and muttered for half an hour an invocation to the Evil  Spirit to arise at his bidding, and disclose the secrets of alchymy.  Gilles looked on with intense interest, and expected every moment to see  the earth open, and deliver to his gaze the great enemy of mankind. At  last the eyes of the physician became fixed, his hair stood on end, and  he spoke, as if addressing the fiend. But Gilles saw nothing except  his companion. At last the physician fell down on the sward as if  insensible. Gilles looked calmly on to see the end. After a few minutes  the physician arose, and asked him if he had not seen how angry the  devil looked? Gilles replied, that he had seen nothing; upon which his  companion informed him that Beelzebub had appeared in the form of a wild  leopard, growled at him savagely, and said nothing; and that the reason  why the Marshal had neither seen nor heard him, was that he hesitated  in his own mind as to devoting himself entirely to the service. De Rays  owned that he had indeed misgivings, and inquired what was to be done to  make the devil speak out, and unfold his secret? The physician replied,  that some person must go to Spain and Africa to collect certain herbs  which only grew in those countries, and offered to go himself, if De  Rays would provide the necessary funds. De Rays at once consented; and  the physician set out on the following day with all the gold that his  dupe could spare him. The Marshal never saw his face again.    But the eager Lord of Champtoce could not rest. Gold was necessary  for his pleasures; and unless, by supernatural aid, he had no means of  procuring many further supplies. The physician was hardly twenty leagues  on his journey, before Gilles resolved to make another effort to force  the devil to divulge the art of gold making. He went out alone for  that purpose, but all his conjurations were of no effect. Beelzebub was  obstinate, and would not appear. Determined to conquer him if he could,  he unbosomed himself to the Italian alchymist, Prelati. The latter  offered to undertake the business, upon condition that De Rays did not  interfere in the conjurations, and consented besides to furnish him with  all the charms and talismans that might be required. He was further to  open a vein in his arm, and sign with his blood a contract that he would  work the devil's will in all things, and offer up to him a sacrifice of  the heart, lungs, hands, eyes, and blood of a young child. The grasping  monomaniac made no hesitation; but agreed at once to the disgusting  terms proposed to him. On the following night, Prelati went out alone;  and after having been absent for three or four hours, returned to  Gilles, who sat anxiously awaiting him. Prelati then informed him that  he had seen the devil in the shape of a handsome youth of twenty. He  further said, that the devil desired to be called Barron in all future  invocations; and had shown him a great number of ingots of pure gold,  buried under a large oak in the neighbouring forest, all of which, and  as many more as he desired, should become the property of the Marechal  de Rays if he remained firm, and broke no condition of the contract.  Prelati further showed him a small casket of black dust, which would  turn iron into gold; but as the process was very troublesome, he advised  that they should be contented with the ingots they found under the  oak tree, and which would more than supply all the wants that the most  extravagant imagination could desire. They were not, however, to attempt  to look for the gold till a period of seven times seven weeks, or  they would find nothing but slates and stones for their pains. Gilles  expressed the utmost chagrin and disappointment, and at once said that  he could not wait for so long a period; if the devil were not more  prompt, Prelati might tell him, that the Marechal de Rays was not to  be trifled with, and would decline all further communication with him.  Prelati at last persuaded him to wait seven times seven days. They then  went at midnight with picks and shovels to dig up the ground under the  oak, where they found nothing to reward them but a great quantity of  slates, marked with hieroglyphics. It was now Prelati's turn to be  angry; and he loudly swore that the devil was nothing but a liar and  a cheat. The Marshal joined cordially in the opinion, but was easily  persuaded by the cunning Italian to make one more trial. He promised  at the same time that he would endeavour, on the following night, to  discover the reason why the devil had broken his word. He went out alone  accordingly, and on his return informed his patron that he had seen  Barron, who was exceedingly angry that they had not waited the proper  time ere they looked for the ingots. Barron had also said, that the  Marechal de Rays could hardly expect any favours from him, at a time  when he must know that he had been meditating a pilgrimage to the Holy  Land, to make atonement for his sins. The Italian had doubtless surmised  this, from some incautious expression of his patron, for De Rays frankly  confessed that there were times when, sick of the world and all its  pomps and vanities, he thought of devoting himself to the service of  God.    In this manner the Italian lured on from month to month his credulous  and guilty patron, extracting from him all the valuables he possessed,  and only waiting a favourable opportunity to decamp with his plunder.  But the day of retribution was at hand for both. Young girls and boys  continued to disappear in the most mysterious manner; and the rumours  against the owner of Champtoce grew so loud and distinct, that the  Church was compelled to interfere. Representations were made by the  Bishop of Nantes to the Duke of Brittany, that it would be a public  scandal if the accusations against the Marechal de Rays were not  inquired into. He was arrested accordingly in his own castle, along with  his accomplice Prelati, and thrown into a dungeon at Nantes to await his  trial.    The judges appointed to try him were the Bishop of Nantes Chancellor  of Brittany, the Vicar of the Inquisition in France, and the celebrated  Pierre l'Hopital, the President of the Provincial Parliament. The  offences laid to his charge were sorcery, sodomy, and murder. Gilles, on  the first day of his trial, conducted himself with the utmost insolence.  He braved the judges on the judgment seat, calling them simoniacs and  persons of impure life, and said he would rather be hanged by the neck  like a dog without trial, than plead either guilty or not guilty to such  contemptible miscreants. But his confidence forsook him as the trial  proceeded, and he was found guilty on the clearest evidence of all the  crimes laid to his charge. It was proved that he took insane pleasure  in stabbing the victims of his lust, and in observing the quivering of  their flesh, and the fading lustre of their eyes as they expired. The  confession of Prelati first made the judges acquainted with this horrid  madness, and Gilles himself confirmed it before his death. Nearly a  hundred children of the villagers around his two castles of Champtoce  and Machecoue, had been missed within three years the greater part,  if not all, of whom were immolated to the lust or the cupidity of this  monster. He imagined that he thus made the devil his friend, and that  his recompence would be the secret of the philosopher's stone.    Gilles and Prelati were both condemned to be burned alive. At the place  of execution they assumed the air of penitence and religion. Gilles  tenderly embraced Prelati, saying, \"Farewell, friend Francis! In this  world we shall never meet again; but let us place our hopes in God; we  shall see each other in Paradise.\" Out of consideration for his  high rank and connections, the punishment of the Marshal was so far  mitigated, that he was not burned alive like Prelati. He was first  strangled, and then thrown into the flames: his body, when half  consumed, was given over to his relatives for interment; while that of  the Italian was burned to ashes, and then scattered in the winds.

This remarkable pretender to the secret of the philosopher's stone, was  contemporary with the last mentioned. He was a great personage at the  court of Charles VII, and in the events of his reign played a prominent  part. From a very humble origin he rose to the highest honours of the  state, and amassed enormous wealth, by peculation and the plunder of the  country which he should have served. It was to hide his delinquencies  in this respect, and to divert attention from the real source of his  riches, that he boasted of having discovered the art of"]]]
