Thus many houses of worship were built,  and the more numerous were the churches, the more did farms, cows, grain  fields, and happy people multiply.    Now when the gnomes and kabouters, who like to do work for pleasant  people, heard that the good teachers wanted church bells, to call the  people to worship, they resolved to help the strangers. They would make  not only a bell, or a chime, but, actually a carillon, or concert of  bells to hang up in the air.    The dark dwarfs did not like to dig metal for swords or spears, or what  would hurt people; but the church bells would guide travellers in the  forest, and quiet the storms, that destroyed houses and upset boats and  killed or drowned people, besides inviting the people to come and pray  and sing. They knew that the good teachers were poor and could not buy  bells in France or Italy. Even if they had money, they could not get  them through the thick forests, or over the stormy seas, for they were  too heavy.    When all the kabouters were told of this, they came together to work,  night and day, in the mines. With pick and shovel, crowbar and chisel,  and hammer and mallet, they broke up the rocks containing copper and  tin. Then they built great roaring fires, to smelt the ore into ingots.  They would show the teachers that the Dutch kabouters could make bells,  as well as the men in the lands of the South. These dwarfish people are  jealous of men and very proud of what they can do.    It was the funniest sight to see these short legged fellows, with tiny  coats coming just below their thighs, and little red caps, looking like  a stocking and ending in a tassel, on their heads, and in shoes that had  no laces, but very long points. They flew around as lively as monkeys,  and when the fire was hot they threw off everything and worked much  harder and longer than men do.    Were they like other fairies? Well, hardly. One must put away all his  usual thoughts, when he thinks of kabouters. No filmy wings on their  backs! No pretty clothes or gauzy garments, or stars, or crowns, or  wands! Instead of these were hammers, pickaxes, and chisels. But how  diligent, useful and lively these little folks, in plain, coarse coats  and with bare legs, were! In place of things light, clean and easy, the  kabouters had furnaces, crucibles and fires of coal and wood.    Sometimes they were grimy, with smoke and coal dust, and the sweat ran  down their faces and bodies. Yet there was always plenty of water in the  mines, and when hard work was over they washed and looked plain but  tidy. Besides their stores of gold, and silver, and precious stones,  which they kept ready, to give to good people, they had tools with which  to tease or tantalize cruel, mean or lazy folks.    Now when the kabouter daddies began the roaring fires for the making of  the bells, the little mothers and the small fry in the kabouter world  could not afford to be idle. One and all, they came down from off the  earth, and into the mines they went in a crowd. They left off teasing  milkmaids, tangling skeins of flax, tearing fishermen's nets, tying  knots in cows' tails, tumbling pots, pans and dishes, in the kitchen, or  hiding hats, and throwing stones down the chimneys onto the fireplaces.  They even ceased their fun of mocking children, who were calling the  cows home, by hiding behind the rocks and shouting to them. Instead of  these tricks, they saved their breath to blow the fires into a blast.  Everybody wondered where the \"kabs\" were, for on the farms and in town  nothing happened and all was as quiet as when a baby is asleep.    For days and weeks underground, the dwarfs toiled, until their skins,  already dark, became as sooty as the rafters in the houses of our  ancestors. Finally, when all the labor was over, the chief gnomes were  invited down into the mines to inspect the work.    What a sight! There were at least a hundred bells, of all sizes, like as  in a family; where there are daddy, mother, grown ups, young sons and  daughters, little folk and babies, whether single, twins or triplets.  Big bells, that could scarcely be put inside a hogshead, bells that  would go into a barrel, bells that filled a bushel, and others a peck,  stood in rows. From the middle, and tapering down the row, were scores  more, some of them no larger than cow-bells. Others, at the end, were so  small, that one had to think of pint and gill measures.    Besides all these, there were stacks of iron rods and bars, bolts, nuts,  screws, and wires and yokes on which to hang the bells.    One party of the strongest of the kabouters had been busy in the forest,  close to a village, where some men, ordered to do so by a foreign  teacher, had begun to cut down some of the finest and most sacred of the  grand old trees. They had left their tools in the woods; but the \"kabs,\"  at night, seized their axes and before morning, without making any  noise, they had levelled all but the holy trees. Those they spared.  Then, the timber, all cut and squared, ready to hold the bells, was  brought to the mouth of the mine.    Now in Dutch, the name for bell is \"klok.\" So a wise and gray-bearded  gnome was chosen by the high sounding title of klokken-spieler, or bell  player, to test the bells for a carillon. They were all hung, for  practice, on the big trestles, in a long row. Each one of these frames  was called a \"hang,\" for they were just like those on which fishermen's  nets were laid to dry and be mended.    So when all were ready, washed, and in their clean clothes, every one of  the kabouter families, daddies, mothers, and young ones, were ranged in  lines and made to sing. The heavy male tenors and baritones, the female  sopranos and contraltos, the trebles of the little folks, and the  squeaks of the very small children, down to the babies' cooing, were all  heard by the gnomes, who were judges. The high and mighty  klokken-spieler, or master of the carillon, chose those voices with best  tone and quality, from which to set in order and regulate the bells.    It was pitiful to see how mad and jealous some of the kabouters, both  male and female, were, when they were not appointed to the first row, in  which were some of the biggest of the males, and some of the fattest of  the females. Then the line tapered off, to forty or fifty young folks,  including urchins of either sex, down to mere babies, that could hardly  stand. These had bibs on and had to be held up by their fond mothers.  Each one by itself could squeal and squall, coo and crow lustily; but,  at a distance, their voices blended and the noise they made sounded like  a tinkle.    All being ready, the old gnome bit his tuning fork, hummed a moment, and  then started a tune. Along the line, at a signal from the chief gnome,  they started a tune.    In the long line, there were, at first, booms and peals, twanging and  clanging, jangling and wrangling, making such a clangor that it sounded  more like an uproar than an opera. The chief gnome was almost  discouraged.    But neither a gnome nor a kabouter ever gives up. The master of the  choir tried again and again. He scolded one old daddy, for singing too  low. He frowned at a stalwart young fellow, who tried to drown out all  the rest with his bull-like bellow. He shook his finger at a kabouter  girl, that was flirting with a handsome lad near her. He cheered up the  little folks, encouraging them to hold up their voices, until finally he  had all in order. Then they practiced, until the master gnome thought he  had his scale of notation perfect and gave orders to attune the bells.  To the delight of all the gnomes, kabouters and elves, that had been  invited to the concert, the rows of bells, a hundred or more, from  boomers to tinklers, made harmony. Strung one above the other, they  could render merriment, or sadness, in solos, peals, chimes, cascades  and carillons, with sweetness and effect. At the low notes the babies  called out \"cow, cow;\" but at the high notes, \"bird, bird.\"    So it happened that, on the very day that the bishop had his great  church built, with a splendid bulb spire on the top, and all nicely  furnished within, but without one bell to ring in it, that the kabouters  planned a great surprise.    It was night. The bishop was packing his saddle bags, ready to take a  journey, on horseback, to Rheims. At this city, the great caravans from  India and China ended, bringing to the annual fair, rugs, spices, gems,  and things Oriental, and the merchants of Rheims rolled in gold. Here  the bishop would beg the money, or ask for a bell, or chimes.    Suddenly, in the night, while in his own house, there rang out music in  the air, such as the bishop had never heard in Holland, or in any of the  seventeen provinces of the Netherlands. Not even in the old lands,  France, or Spain, or Italy, where the Christian teachers, builders and  singers, and the music of the bells had long been heard, had such a  flood of sweet sounds ever fallen on human ears. Here, in these northern  regions, rang out, not a solo, nor a peal, nor a chime, nor even a  cascade, from one bell, or from many bells; but, a long programme of  richest music in the air--something which no other country, however rich  or old, possessed. It was a carillon, that is, a continued mass of real  music, in which whole tunes, songs, and elaborate pieces of such length,  mass and harmony, as only a choir of many voices, a band of music, or an  orchestra of many performers could produce.    To get this grand work of hanging in the spire done in one night, and  before daylight, also, required a whole regiment of fairy toilers, who  must work like bees. For if one ray of sunshine struck any one of the  kabouters, he was at once petrified. The light elves lived in the  sunshine and thrived on it; but for dark elves, like the kabouters,  whose home was underground, sunbeams were as poisoned arrows bringing  sure death; for by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7882"],[0,"The Life of Kit Carson: Hunter, Trapper, Guide, Indian Agent and Colonel U.S.A. (#11)"],[1,"swaggered back  and forth through camp, boasting that he could trounce any one there. In  the midst of his bluster, Carson walked up in front of him and said in a  voice loud enough to be heard by those around:    \"Captain Shunan, there are plenty here who can easily chastise you, but  they prefer to submit to your impudence for the sake of peace: however,  we have had enough and now I notify you to stop at once or I shall kill  you!\"    These were astounding words, and, as may be supposed, when uttered by  a man six inches shorter and many pounds lighter than the blustering  Captain, they fairly took away his breath. Carson spoke in his quiet,  soft voice, as though there was not the least cause for excitement;  but those who knew him, noted the flash of his clear, gray eye and  understood his deadly earnestness.    Captain Shunan was infuriated by the words of Carson. As soon as he  could recover himself, he turned about and without speaking a word,  walked to his quarters. Kit did not need be told what that meant. He  did the same, walking to his own lodge, from which he speedily emerged  holding a single barrel pistol. He was so anxious to be on the ground in  time, that he caught up the first weapon that presented itself.    Almost at the same moment, Captain Shunan appeared with his rifle.  Carson observed him, and, though he could have secured without  difficulty a similar weapon, he did not do so. He was willing to give  his burly antagonist the advantage, if it should prove such. The other  trappers as may be supposed, watched the actions of the two men with  breathless interest. The quarrel had taken such a course that they  were convinced that one or the other of the combatants would be killed.  Captain Shunan had been so loud in his boasts that he did not dare  swallow the insult, put on him by the fragile Kit Carson. Had he done  so, he would have been hooted out of camp and probably lynched.    As for Kit, his courage was beyond suspicion. He feared no man and was  sure to acquit himself creditably no matter in what circumstances he was  placed. He was the most popular member of the large company, while his  antagonist was the most detested; but the love of fair play was such  that no one would interfere, no matter how great the need for doing so.    The duellists, as they may be called, mounted each his horse and  circling about the plain, speedily headed toward each other and dashed  forward on a dead run. As they approached, they reined up and halted  face to face, within arm's length.    Looking his antagonist straight in the eye, Carson demanded:    \"Are you looking for me?\"    \"Have you any business with me?\"    \"No,\" growled the savage Frenchman; but, while the words were in his  mouth, brought his rifle to his shoulder, and, pointing it at the breast  of Carson, pulled the trigger; but Kit expected some such treacherous  act, and, before the gun could be fired, he threw up his pistol and  discharged it as may be said, across the barrel of the leveled weapon.    The ball broke the forearm of Captain Shunan, at the very moment he  discharged his gun. The shock diverted the aim so that the bullet grazed  his scalp, inflicting a trifling wound; but the combatants were so close  that the powder of the rifle scorched the face of the mountaineer.    Captain Shunan had been badly worsted, and was disabled for weeks  afterward. He accepted his fate without complaint and was effectually  cured of his overbearing manner toward his associates.        CHAPTER XIII.       On the Yellowstone--Repeated Disappointments--Carson Enters the Employ   of a Hudson Bay Trader--Poor Success--A Trying Journey--Arrival at Fort   Hall--The American Buffalo or Bison.    With the approach of cool weather, preparations were made for the fall  hunt. When all was ready, the trappers headed for the Yellowstone, which  was reached without mishap, and they immediately set their traps. The  country as a rule, was a good one for those valuable animals, but the  visitors were disappointed to learn they were unusually scarce.    When it became evident that it was useless to work on the Yellowstone,  they gathered up their traps and made their way to the Big Horn, but,  failing again, tried their fortunes on other rivers in that vicinity  with no better results.    It was while engaged in this discouraging work that they met a trader  belonging to the Hudson Bay Company. He had been pushing operations in  every direction, but the stories he told were of the same general tenor  as those of the larger party. He had been as unsuccessful in the way of  trade as they had been in catching the fur bearing animals.    The Hudson Bay trader, however, was confident he could succeed where  they had failed, and he made such liberal offers to Carson that he and  several of his companions accepted them on the spot.    The first point which they visited was the Humboldt River, from which  had come reports of the abundance of beavers. They began near the head  waters of the stream, and carefully trapped down to the Great Basin.  Meeting with only moderate success, they made their way to Big Snake  River. After remaining there a considerable time, the party divided,  the Hudson Bay trader and his friends going northward toward Fort Walla  Walla, while Carson and the larger number set out for Fort Hall.    The journey thither was one of the most distressing which Kit Carson  ever undertook. The country through which most of the march led is one  of the most dismal wastes on the American continent. Except in extent, a  journey across it is similar to that of the parched caravans across the  flaming sands of Sahara. Carson and his companions were accustomed to  all manner of privations, but more than once their endurance was tried  to the utmost point.    The trappers had gathered some nutritious roots upon which they managed  to subsist for a time, but these soon gave out, and their situation grew  desperate. When almost famishing they bled their mules and drank the  warm current. They would have killed one of the animals, but for the  fact that they could not spare it, and, as there was no calculating how  long the others would last, they were afraid to take the step, which was  likely to cripple them fatally.    This strange source of nourishment served them for the time, but a  repetition would endanger the lives of their animals, who were also in  sore straits, inasmuch as the grass was not only poor but very scanty.  Matters rapidly grew worse, and soon became so desperate that Carson  said they would have to kill one of their animals or else lie down and  perish themselves.    At this trying crisis, they discovered a band of Indians approaching.  Perhaps the hapless situation in which all were placed left no room for  enmity, for the red men showed a friendly disposition. The high hopes of  Carson and his friends were chilled when it was found that the Indians  were in about as bad a plight as themselves. They had barely a mouthful  of food among them, and, when besought to barter with the whites, they  shook their heads. They had nothing to trade, and, while they felt no  hostility toward the suffering trappers, they gave them to understand  they could not afford any help at all.    But Carson had fixed his eyes on a plump old horse, and never did a  shrewd New Englander apply himself more persistently to secure a prize  than did he. Kit's companions put forth all their powers of persuasion,  but in vain, and they advised Carson that he was throwing away his  efforts in attempting the impossible.    But Carson succeeded, and when the equine was slaughtered and broiled,  the trappers enjoyed one of the most delicious feasts of their lives.  They filled themselves to repletion and felt that the enjoyment it  brought was almost worth the suffering they had undergone to obtain it.    When their strength was recruited, they resumed their journey and a few  days later reached Fort Hall. There they found abundance of food and  received a cordial welcome. In a brief while they were as strong as ever  and eager for any new enterprise.    Hundreds of bisons were in the neighborhood of the fort and Carson  and his friends slew them by the score. Indeed they kept the post well  supplied with fresh meet as long as they remained there.    The animal almost universally known as the \"buffalo\" is miscalled, his  correct name being the \"bison,\" of which there are droves numbering, it  is said, as high as a hundred thousand. The flesh is held in high  repute by hunters, and not only is nourishing but possesses the valuable  quality of not cloying the appetite. The most delicate portion of the  animal is the hump which gives the peculiar appearance to his back. That  and the tongue and marrow bones are frequently the only portions made  use of by the hunter.    The hide answers many useful purposes. All know how much a \"buffalo  robe\" is appreciated in wintry weather by those exposed to cold. It  serves to form the Indian's tents, his bed, parts of his dress and is  sometimes made into a shield which will turn aside a rifle ball that  does not strike it fairly.    Hundreds of thousands of bisons are killed annually--myriads of them  in pure wantonness--and yet enormous droves may be encountered today in  many portions of the west, where it is hard for the experienced hunters  to detect any decrease in their numbers.    Some of the methods employed to slay bisons are cruel in the extreme.  Many a time a large herd has been stampeded in the direction of some  precipice. When the leaders found themselves on the edge, they have  endeavored to recoil; but there was no stemming the tide behind them.  The terrified animals literally pushed the leaders over the rocks and  then tumbled upon them. In a little while the gully or stream would be  choked with the furiously struggling creatures and hundreds would be  killed within a few minutes.    The bison is as fond"]]]
