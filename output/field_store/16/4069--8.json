[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9629"],[0,"Ghost Stories of an Antiquary Part 2: More Ghost Stories (#11)"],[1," After a few  minutes they were brought to him, and he was settling the one he wanted  first upon the desk, when he thought he heard his own name whispered  behind him. He turned round hastily, and in doing so, brushed his little  portfolio of loose papers on to the floor. He saw no one he recognized  except one of the staff in charge of the room, who nodded to him, and he  proceeded to pick up his papers. He thought he had them all, and was  turning to begin work, when a stout gentleman at the table behind him,  who was just rising to leave, and had collected his own belongings,  touched him on the shoulder, saying, 'May I give you this? I think it  should be yours,' and handed him a missing quire. 'It is mine, thank  you,' said Mr Dunning. In another moment the man had left the room. Upon  finishing his work for the afternoon, Mr Dunning had some conversation  with the assistant in charge, and took occasion to ask who the stout  gentleman was. 'Oh, he's a man named Karswell,' said the assistant; 'he  was asking me a week ago who were the great authorities on alchemy, and  of course I told him you were the only one in the country. I'll see if I  can't catch him: he'd like to meet you, I'm sure.'    'For heaven's sake don't dream of it!' said Mr Dunning, 'I'm particularly  anxious to avoid him.'    'Oh! very well,' said the assistant, 'he doesn't come here often: I dare  say you won't meet him.'    More than once on the way home that day Mr Dunning confessed to himself  that he did not look forward with his usual cheerfulness to a solitary  evening. It seemed to him that something ill-defined and impalpable had  stepped in between him and his fellow-men--had taken him in charge, as it  were. He wanted to sit close up to his neighbours in the train and in the  tram, but as luck would have it both train and car were markedly empty.  The conductor George was thoughtful, and appeared to be absorbed in  calculations as to the number of passengers. On arriving at his house he  found Dr Watson, his medical man, on his doorstep. 'I've had to upset  your household arrangements, I'm sorry to say, Dunning. Both your  servants _hors de combat_. In fact, I've had to send them to the Nursing  Home.'    'Good heavens! what's the matter?'    'It's something like ptomaine poisoning, I should think: you've not  suffered yourself, I can see, or you wouldn't be walking about. I think  they'll pull through all right.'    'Dear, dear! Have you any idea what brought it on?'    'Well, they tell me they bought some shell-fish from a hawker  at their dinner-time. It's odd. I've made inquiries, but  I can't find that any hawker has been to other  houses in the street. I couldn't send word to you; they won't be back for  a bit yet. You come and dine with me tonight, anyhow, and we can make  arrangements for going on. Eight o'clock. Don't be too anxious.'    The solitary evening was thus obviated; at the expense of some distress and  inconvenience, it is true. Mr Dunning spent the time pleasantly enough  with the doctor (a rather recent settler), and returned to his lonely  home at about 11.30. The night he passed is not one on which he looks  back with any satisfaction. He was in bed and the light was out. He was  wondering if the charwoman would come early enough to get him hot water  next morning, when he heard the unmistakable sound of his study door  opening. No step followed it on the passage floor, but the sound must  mean mischief, for he knew that he had shut the door that evening after  putting his papers away in his desk. It was rather shame than courage  that induced him to slip out into the passage and lean over the banister  in his nightgown, listening. No light was visible; no further sound came:  only a gust of warm, or even hot air played for an instant round his  shins. He went back and decided to lock himself into his room. There was  more unpleasantness, however. Either an economical suburban company had  decided that their light would not be required in the small hours, and  had stopped working, or else something was wrong with the meter; the  effect was in any case that the electric light was off. The obvious  course was to find a match, and also to consult his watch: he might as  well know how many hours of discomfort awaited him. So he put his hand  into the well-known nook under the pillow: only, it did not get so far.  What he touched was, according to his account, a mouth, with teeth, and  with hair about it, and, he declares, not the mouth of a human being. I  do not think it is any use to guess what he said or did; but he was in a  spare room with the door locked and his ear to it before he was clearly  conscious again. And there he spent the rest of a most miserable night,  looking every moment for some fumbling at the door: but nothing came.    The venturing back to his own room in the morning was attended with many  listenings and quiverings. The door stood open, fortunately, and the  blinds were up (the servants had been out of the house before the hour of  drawing them down); there was, to be short, no trace of an inhabitant.  The watch, too, was in its usual place; nothing was disturbed, only the  wardrobe door had swung open, in accordance with its confirmed habit. A  ring at the back door now announced the charwoman, who had been ordered  the night before, and nerved Mr Dunning, after letting her in, to  continue his search in other parts of the house. It was equally  fruitless.    The day thus begun went on dismally enough. He dared not go to the  Museum: in spite of what the assistant had said, Karswell might turn up  there, and Dunning felt he could not cope with a probably hostile  stranger. His own house was odious; he hated sponging on the doctor. He  spent some little time in a call at the Nursing Home, where he was  slightly cheered by a good report of his housekeeper and maid. Towards  lunch-time he betook himself to his club, again experiencing a gleam of  satisfaction at seeing the Secretary of the Association. At luncheon  Dunning told his friend the more material of his woes, but could not  bring himself to speak of those that weighed most heavily on his spirits.  'My poor dear man,' said the Secretary, 'what an upset! Look here: we're  alone at home, absolutely. You must put up with us. Yes! no excuse: send  your things in this afternoon.' Dunning was unable to stand out: he was,  in truth, becoming acutely anxious, as the hours went on, as to what that  night might have waiting for him. He was almost happy as he hurried home  to pack up.    His friends, when they had time to take stock of him, were rather shocked  at his lorn appearance, and did their best to keep him up to the mark.  Not altogether without success: but, when the two men were smoking alone  later, Dunning became dull again. Suddenly he said, 'Gayton, I believe  that alchemist man knows it was I who got his paper rejected.' Gayton  whistled. 'What makes you think that?' he said. Dunning told of his  conversation with the Museum assistant, and Gayton could only agree that  the guess seemed likely to be correct. 'Not that I care much,' Dunning  went on, 'only it might be a nuisance if we were to meet. He's a  bad-tempered party, I imagine.' Conversation dropped again; Gayton became  more and more strongly impressed with the desolateness that came over  Dunning's face and bearing, and finally--though with a considerable  effort--he asked him point-blank whether something serious was not  bothering him. Dunning gave an exclamation of relief. 'I was perishing to  get it off my mind,' he said. 'Do you know anything about a man named  John Harrington?' Gayton was thoroughly startled, and at the moment could  only ask why. Then the complete story of Dunning's experiences came  out--what had happened in the tramcar, in his own house, and in the  street, the troubling of spirit that had crept over him, and still held  him; and he ended with the question he had begun with. Gayton was at a  loss how to answer him. To tell the story of Harrington's end would  perhaps be right; only, Dunning was in a nervous state, the story was a  grim one, and he could not help asking himself whether there were not a  connecting link between these two cases, in the person of Karswell. It  was a difficult concession for a scientific man, but it could be eased by  the phrase 'hypnotic suggestion'. In the end he decided that his answer  tonight should be guarded; he would talk the situation over with his  wife. So he said that he had known Harrington at Cambridge, and believed  he had died suddenly in 1889, adding a few details about the man and his  published work. He did talk over the matter with Mrs Gayton, and, as he  had anticipated, she leapt at once to the conclusion which had been  hovering before him. It was she who reminded him of the surviving  brother, Henry Harrington, and she also who suggested that he might be  got hold of by means of their hosts of the day before. 'He might be a  hopeless crank,' objected Gayton. 'That could be ascertained from the  Bennetts, who knew him,' Mrs Gayton retorted; and she undertook to see  the Bennetts the very next day.           *       *       *       *       *    It is not necessary to tell in further detail the steps by which Henry  Harrington and Dunning were brought together.           *       *       *       *       *    The next scene that does require to be narrated is a conversation that  took place between the two. Dunning had told Harrington of the strange  ways in which the dead man's name had been brought before him, and had  said something, besides, of his own subsequent experiences. Then he had  asked if Harrington was disposed, in return, to recall any of the  circumstances connected with his brother's death. Harrington's surprise  at what he heard can be imagined: but his reply was readily given.    'John,' he said, 'was in a very odd state, undeniably, from time to time,  during some"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/964"],[0,"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood (#11)"],[1," Saxon face like thine right well--more  especially when it cometh from Locksley Town, and most especially when  the man that owneth it is to marry a bonny lass on Thursday next. But  come, tell me for what price thou wilt sell me all of thy meat and thy  horse and cart.\"    \"At four marks do I value meat, cart, and mare,\" quoth the Butcher, \"but  if I do not sell all my meat I will not have four marks in value.\"    Then Robin Hood plucked the purse from his girdle, and quoth he, \"Here  in this purse are six marks. Now, I would fain be a butcher for the day  and sell my meat in Nottingham Town. Wilt thou close a bargain with me  and take six marks for thine outfit?\"    \"Now may the blessings of all the saints fall on thine honest head!\"  cried the Butcher right joyfully, as he leaped down from his cart and  took the purse that Robin held out to him.    \"Nay,\" quoth Robin, laughing loudly, \"many do like me and wish me well,  but few call me honest. Now get thee gone back to thy lass, and give her  a sweet kiss from me.\" So saying, he donned the Butcher's apron, and,  climbing into the cart, he took the reins in his hand and drove off  through the forest to Nottingham Town.    When he came to Nottingham, he entered that part of the market where  butchers stood, and took up his inn(2) in the best place he could find.  Next, he opened his stall and spread his meat upon the bench, then,  taking his cleaver and steel and clattering them together, he trolled  aloud in merry tones:         (2) Stand for selling.         \"Now come, ye lasses, and eke ye dames,       And buy your meat from me;       For three pennyworths of meat I sell       For the charge of one penny.         \"Lamb have I that hath fed upon nought       But the dainty dames pied,       And the violet sweet, and the daffodil       That grow fair streams beside.         \"And beef have I from the heathery words,       And mutton from dales all green,       And veal as white as a maiden's brow,       With its mother's milk, I ween.         \"Then come, ye lasses, and eke ye dames,       Come, buy your meat from me,       For three pennyworths of meat I sell       For the charge of one penny.\"    Thus he sang blithely, while all who stood near listened amazedly. Then,  when he had finished, he clattered the steel and cleaver still more  loudly, shouting lustily, \"Now, who'll buy? Who'll buy? Four fixed  prices have I. Three pennyworths of meat I sell to a fat friar or priest  for sixpence, for I want not their custom; stout aldermen I charge  threepence, for it doth not matter to me whether they buy or not; to  buxom dames I sell three pennyworths of meat for one penny for I like  their custom well; but to the bonny lass that hath a liking for a good  tight butcher I charge nought but one fair kiss, for I like her custom  the best of all.\"    Then all began to stare and wonder and crowd around, laughing, for never  was such selling heard of in all Nottingham Town; but when they came to  buy they found it as he had said, for he gave goodwife or dame as much  meat for one penny as they could buy elsewhere for three, and when a  widow or a poor woman came to him, he gave her flesh for nothing; but  when a merry lass came and gave him a kiss, he charged not one penny for  his meat; and many such came to his stall, for his eyes were as blue as  the skies of June, and he laughed merrily, giving to each full measure.  Thus he sold his meat so fast that no butcher that stood near him could  sell anything.    Then they began to talk among themselves, and some said, \"This must be  some thief who has stolen cart, horse, and meat;\" but others said, \"Nay,  when did ye ever see a thief who parted with his goods so freely and  merrily? This must be some prodigal who hath sold his father's land, and  would fain live merrily while the money lasts.\" And these latter being  the greater number, the others came round, one by one to their way of  thinking.    Then some of the butchers came to him to make his acquaintance. \"Come,  brother,\" quoth one who was the head of them all, \"we be all of one  trade, so wilt thou go dine with us? For this day the Sheriff hath asked  all the Butcher Guild to feast with him at the Guild Hall. There will  be stout fare and much to drink, and that thou likest, or I much mistake  thee.\"    \"Now, beshrew his heart,\" quoth jolly Robin, \"that would deny a butcher.  And, moreover, I will go dine with you all, my sweet lads, and that as  fast as I can hie.\" Whereupon, having sold all his meat, he closed his  stall and went with them to the great Guild Hall.    There the Sheriff had already come in state, and with him many butchers.  When Robin and those that were with him came in, all laughing at some  merry jest he had been telling them, those that were near the Sheriff  whispered to him, \"Yon is a right mad blade, for he hath sold more meat  for one penny this day than we could sell for three, and to whatsoever  merry lass gave him a kiss he gave meat for nought.\" And others said,  \"He is some prodigal that hath sold his land for silver and gold, and  meaneth to spend all right merrily.\"    Then the Sheriff called Robin to him, not knowing him in his butcher's  dress, and made him sit close to him on his right hand; for he loved a  rich young prodigal--especially when he thought that he might lighten  that prodigal's pockets into his own most worshipful purse. So he made  much of Robin, and laughed and talked with him more than with any of the  others.    At last the dinner was ready to be served and the Sheriff bade Robin say  grace, so Robin stood up and said, \"Now Heaven bless us all and eke good  meat and good sack within this house, and may all butchers be and remain  as honest men as I am.\"    At this all laughed, the Sheriff loudest of all, for he said to himself,  \"Surely this is indeed some prodigal, and perchance I may empty his  purse of some of the money that the fool throweth about so freely.\" Then  he spake aloud to Robin, saying, \"Thou art a jolly young blade, and I  love thee mightily;\" and he smote Robin upon the shoulder.    Then Robin laughed loudly too. \"Yea,\" quoth he, \"I know thou dost love  a jolly blade, for didst thou not have jolly Robin Hood at thy shooting  match and didst thou not gladly give him a bright golden arrow for his  own?\"    At this the Sheriff looked grave and all the guild of butchers too, so  that none laughed but Robin, only some winked slyly at each other.    \"Come, fill us some sack!\" cried Robin. \"Let us e'er be merry while we  may, for man is but dust, and he hath but a span to live here till the  worm getteth him, as our good gossip Swanthold sayeth; so let life be  merry while it lasts, say I. Nay, never look down i' the mouth, Sir  Sheriff. Who knowest but that thou mayest catch Robin Hood yet, if thou  drinkest less good sack and Malmsey, and bringest down the fat about thy  paunch and the dust from out thy brain. Be merry, man.\"    Then the Sheriff laughed again, but not as though he liked the jest,  while the butchers said, one to another, \"Before Heaven, never have  we seen such a mad rollicking blade. Mayhap, though, he will make the  Sheriff mad.\"    \"How now, brothers,\" cried Robin, \"be merry! nay, never count over your  farthings, for by this and by that I will pay this shot myself, e'en  though it cost two hundred pounds. So let no man draw up his lip, nor  thrust his forefinger into his purse, for I swear that neither butcher  nor Sheriff shall pay one penny for this feast.\"    \"Now thou art a right merry soul,\" quoth the Sheriff, \"and I wot thou  must have many a head of horned beasts and many an acre of land, that  thou dost spend thy money so freely.\"    \"Ay, that have I,\" quoth Robin, laughing loudly again, \"five hundred and  more horned beasts have I and my brothers, and none of them have we been  able to sell, else I might not have turned butcher. As for my land, I  have never asked my steward how many acres I have.\"    At this the Sheriff's eyes twinkled, and he chuckled to himself. \"Nay,  good youth,\" quoth he, \"if thou canst not sell thy cattle, it may be I  will find a man that will lift them from thy hands; perhaps that man may  be myself, for I love a merry youth and would help such a one along the  path of life. Now how much dost thou want for thy horned cattle?\"    \"Well,\" quoth Robin, \"they are worth at least five hundred pounds.\"    \"Nay,\" answered the Sheriff slowly, and as if he were thinking within  himself, \"well do I love thee, and fain would I help thee along, but  five hundred pounds in money is a good round sum; besides I have it not  by me. Yet I will give thee three hundred pounds for them all, and that  in good hard silver and gold.\"    \"Now thou old miser!\" quoth Robin, \"well thou knowest that so many  horned cattle are worth seven hundred pounds and more, and even that is  but small for them, and yet thou, with thy gray hairs and one foot in  the grave, wouldst trade upon the folly of a wild youth.\"    At this the Sheriff looked grimly at Robin. \"Nay,\" quoth Robin, \"look  not on me as though thou hadst sour beer in thy mouth, man. I will take  thine offer, for I and my brothers do need the money. We lead a merry  life, and no one leads a merry life for a farthing, so I will close  the bargain with thee. But mind that thou bringest a good three hundred  pounds with thee, for I trust not one that driveth so shrewd a bargain.\"    \"I will bring the money,\" said the Sheriff. \"But what is thy name, good  youth?\"    \"Men call me Robert o' Locksley,\" quoth bold Robin.    \"Then, good Robert o' Locksley,\" quoth the Sheriff, \"I will come this  day to see thy horned beasts. But first my clerk shall draw up a paper  in which thou shalt be bound to the sale, for thou gettest not my money  without I get thy beasts in return.\"    Then Robin Hood laughed again. \"So be it,\" he said, smiting his palm  upon the Sheriff's hand. \"Truly my brothers will be thankful to thee for  thy "]]]
