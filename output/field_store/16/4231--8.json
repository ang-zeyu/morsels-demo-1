The great European public baths have long been above suspicion in      this respect (though homosexual practices are not quite      excluded), while it is well recognized that many kinds of hot      baths now in use produce a powerfully stimulating action upon the      sexual system, and patients taking such baths for medical      purposes are frequently warned against giving way to these      influences.        The struggle which in former ages went on around bathing      establishments has now been in part transferred to massage      establishments. Massage is an equally powerful stimulant to the      skin and the sexual sphere,--acting mainly by friction instead of      mainly by heat,--and it has not yet attained that position of      general recognition and popularity which, in the case of bathing      establishments, renders it bad policy to court disrepute.        Like bathing, massage is a hygienic and therapeutic method of      influencing the skin and subjacent tissues which, together with      its advantages, has certain concomitant disadvantages in its      liability to affect the sexual sphere. This influence is apt to      be experienced by individuals of both sexes, though it is perhaps      specially marked in women. Jouin (quoted in Paris _Journal de      Medecine_, April 23, 1893) found that of 20 women treated by      massage, of whom he made inquiries, 14 declared that they      experienced voluptuous sensations; 8 of these belonged to      respectable families; the other 6 were women of the _demimonde_      and gave precise details; Jouin refers in this connection to the      _aliptes_ of Rome. It is unnecessary to add that the      gynaecological massage introduced in recent years by the Swedish      teacher of gymnastics, Thure-Brandt, as involving prolonged      rubbing and kneading of the pelvic regions, \"_pression glissante      du vagin_\" etc. (_Massage Gynecologique_, by G. de Frumerie,      1897), whatever its therapeutic value, cannot fail in a large      proportion of cases to stimulate the sexual emotions. (Eulenburg      remarks that for sexual anaesthesia in women the Thure-Brandt      system of massage may \"naturally\" be recommended, _Sexuale      Neuropathie_, p. 78.) I have been informed that in London and      elsewhere massage establishments are sometimes visited by women      who seek sexual gratification by massage of the genital regions      by the _masseuse_.      FOOTNOTES:    [21] \"_Dicens munditiam corporis atque vestitus animae esse  immunditiam_\"--St. Jerome, _Ad Eustochium Virginem_.    [22] With regard to the physiological mechanism by which bathing produces  its tonic and stimulating effects Woods Hutchinson has an interesting  discussion (Chapter VII) in his _Studies in Human and Comparative  Pathology_.    [23] Thus among the young women admitted to the Chicago Normal School to  be trained as teachers, Miss Lura Sanborn, the director of physical  training, states (_Doctor's Magazine_, December, 1900) that a bath once a  fortnight is found to be not unusual.          V.    Summary--Fundamental Importance of Touch--The Skin the Mother of All the  Other Senses.      The sense of touch is so universally diffused over the whole skin, and in  so many various degrees and modifications, and it is, moreover, so truly  the Alpha and the Omega of affection, that a broken and fragmentary  treatment of the subject has been inevitable.    The skin is the archaeological field of human and prehuman experience, the  foundation on which all forms of sensory perception have grown up, and as  sexual sensibility is among the most ancient of all forms of sensibility,  the sexual instinct is necessarily, in the main, a comparatively slightly  modified form of general touch sensibility. This primitive character of  the great region of tactile sensation, its vagueness and diffusion, the  comparatively unintellectual as well as unaesthetic nature of the mental  conceptions which arise on the tactile basis make it difficult to deal  precisely with the psychology of touch. The very same qualities, however,  serve greatly to heighten the emotional intensity of skin sensations. So  that, of all the great sensory fields, the field of touch is at once the  least intellectual and the most massively emotional. These qualities, as  well as its intimate and primitive association with the apparatus of  tumescence and detumescence, make touch the readiest and most powerful  channel by which the sexual sphere may be reached.    In disentangling the phenomena of tactile sensibility ticklishness has  been selected for special consideration as a kind of sensation, founded on  reflexes developing even before birth, which is very closely related to  sexual phenomena. It is, as it were, a play of tumescence, on which  laughter supervenes as a play of detumescence. It leads on to the more  serious phenomena of tumescence, and it tends to die out after  adolescence, at the period during which sexual relationships normally  begin. Such a view of ticklishness, as a kind of modesty of the skin,  existing merely to be destroyed, need only be regarded as one of its  aspects. Ticklishness certainly arose from a non-sexual starting-point,  and may well have protective uses in the young animal.    The readiness with which tactile sensibility takes on a sexual character  and forms reflex channels of communication with the sexual sphere proper  is illustrated by the existence of certain secondary sexual foci only  inferior in sexual excitability to the genital region. We have seen that  the chief of these normal foci are situated in the orificial regions where  skin and mucous membrane meet, and that the contact of any two orificial  regions between two persons of different sex brought together under  favorable conditions is apt, when prolonged, to produce a very intense  degree of sexual erethism. This is a normal phenomenon in so far as it is  a part of tumescence, and not a method of obtaining detumescence. The kiss  is a typical example of these contacts, while the nipple is of special  interest in this connection, because we are thereby enabled to bring the  psychology of lactation into intimate relationship with the psychology of  sexual love.    The extreme sensitiveness of the skin, the readiness with which its  stimulation reverberates into the sexual sphere, clearly brought out by  the present study, enable us to understand better a very ancient  contest--the moral struggle around the bath. There has always been a  tendency for the extreme cultivation of physical purity to lead on to the  excessive stimulation of the sexual sphere; so that the Christian ascetics  were entirely justified, on their premises, in fighting against the bath  and in directly or indirectly fostering a cult of physical uncleanliness.  While, however, in the past there has clearly been a general tendency for  the cult of physical purity to be associated with moral licentiousness,  and there are sufficient grounds for such an association, it is important  to remember that it is not an inevitable and fatal association; a  scrupulously clean person is by no means necessarily impelled to  licentiousness; a physically unclean person is by no means necessarily  morally pure. When we have eliminated certain forms of the bath which must  be regarded as luxuries rather than hygienic necessities, though they  occasionally possess therapeutic virtues, we have eliminated the most  violent appeals of the bath to the sexual impulse. So imperative are the  demands of physical purity now becoming, in general opinion, that such  small risks to moral purity as may still remain are constantly and wisely  disregarded, and the immoral traditions of the bath now, for the most  part, belong to the past.          SMELL.    I.    The Primitiveness of Smell--The Anatomical Seat of the Olfactory  Centres--Predominance of Smell among the Lower Mammals--Its Diminished  Importance in Man--The Attention Paid to Odors by Savages.      The first more highly organized sense to arise on the diffused tactile  sensitivity of the skin is, in most cases, without doubt that of smell. At  first, indeed, olfactory sensibility is not clearly differentiated from  general tactile sensibility; the pit of thickened and ciliated epithelium  or the highly mobile antennae which in many lower animals are sensitive to  odorous stimuli are also extremely sensitive to tactile stimuli; this is,  for instance, the case with the snail, in whom at the same time olfactive  sensibility seems to be spread over the whole body.[24] The sense of smell  is gradually specialized, and when taste also begins to develop a kind of  chemical sense is constituted. The organ of smell, however, speedily  begins to rise in importance as we ascend the zooelogical scale. In the  lower vertebrates, when they began to adopt a life on dry land, the sense  of smell seems to have been that part of their sensory equipment which  proved most useful under the new conditions, and it developed with  astonishing rapidity. Edinger finds that in the brain of reptiles the  \"area olfactoria\" is of enormous extent, covering, indeed, the greater  part of the cortex, though it may be quite true, as Herrick remarks, that,  while smell is preponderant, it is perhaps not correct to attribute an  exclusively olfactory tone to the cerebral activities of the _Sauropsida_  or even the _Ichthyopsida_. Among most mammals, however, in any case,  smell is certainly the most highly developed of the senses; it gives the  first information of remote objects that concern them; it gives the most  precise information concerning the near objects that concern them; it is  the sense in terms of which most of their mental operations must be  conducted and their emotional impulses reach consciousness.

But you are not pessimistic. You have superior      abilities, for they are intuitively intellectual. There is a cold      reticence which restrains generous impulses and which inclines to      acquisitiveness; it will make you deliberate, inventive, adding      self-esteem, some vanity.'        \"At an early age I was left much alone in the nursery and there      contracted the habit of masturbation long before the age of      puberty. I use the word 'masturbation' for want of a better,      though it may not quite describe my case. I have never used my      hand to the penis. As far back as I can remember I have had what      a Frenchman has described as 'le fetichisme de la chaussure,' and      in those early days, before I was 6 years old, I would put on my      father's boots, taken from a cupboard at hand, and then tying or      strapping my legs together would produce an erection, and all the      pleasurable feelings experienced, I suppose, by means of      masturbation. I always did this secretly, but couldn't tell why.      I continued this practice on and off all my boyhood and youth.      When I discovered the first emission I was much surprised. I      always did this thing without loosening my trousers. As to how      these feelings arose I am totally unable to say. I can't remember      being without such feelings, and they seem to me perfectly      normal. The sight, or even thought, of high boots, or leggings,      especially if well polished or in patent leather, would set all      my sexual passions aflame, and does yet. As a boy my great desire      was to wear these things. A soldier in boots and spurs, a groom      in tops, or even an errand-boy in patent leather leggings,      fascinated me, and to this day, despite reason and everything      else. The sight of such things produced an erection. An emission      I could always produce by tightly tying my legs together, but      only when wearing boots, and preferably leggings, which when I      had pocket money I bought for this purpose. (At the present      moment I have five pairs in the house and two pairs of high      boots, quite unjustified by ordinary use.) This habit I lapse      into yet at times. The smell of leather affects me, but I never      know how far this may be due to association with boots; the smell      suggests the image. Restraint by a leather strap is more exciting      than by cords. Erotic dreams always take the form of restraint on      the limbs when booted.        \"Uniforms and liveries have a great temptation for me, but only      when of a tight-fitting nature and smart, as soldiers', grooms',      etc., but not sailors'; most powerfully when the person is in      boots or leggings and breeches.        \"I was a quiet, sensitive boy, taking no part in games or sports.      Have always been indifferent to them. I made few friends, but      didn't want them. The craving for friendship came much later,      after I was 21. I was a day boy at a private school, and never      had any conversation with any boy on sexual matters, though I was      dimly aware of much 'nastiness' about the school. I knew nothing      of sodomy. But all these things were repulsive to me,      notwithstanding my secret practices. I was a 'good boy.'        \"Up to the age of 21 I was perfectly satisfied with my own      society, something of a prig, fond of books and reading, etc. I      was and ever have been absolutely insensible to the influence of      the other sex. I am not a woman hater, and take intellectual      pleasure in the society of certain ladies, but they are nearly      all much older than myself. I have a strong repulsion from sexual      relations with women. I should not mind being married for the      sake of companionship and for the sake of having boys of my own.      But the sexual act would frighten me. I could not in my present      frame of mind go to bed with a woman. Yet I feel an immense envy      of my married friends in that they are able to give out, and find      satisfaction for, their affection in a way that is quite      impossible for me. I picture certain boys in the place of the      wife.        \"I am now only happy in the society of men younger than myself,      age 17 to (say) 23 or 24, youths with smooth faces, or first sign      of hair on lip, well groomed, slightly effeminate in feature, of      sympathetic, perhaps weak nature. I feel I want to help them, do      something for them, devote myself entirely to their welfare.        \"With such there is no fixed line between friendship and love. I      yearn for intimacy with particular friends, but never dare      express it. I find so many people object to any strong expression      of feeling that I dare not run the risk of appearing ridiculous      in the eyes of these desired intimates.        \"I have no desire for _paedicatio_, but the idea itself does not      repulse me or seem unnatural, though personally it repels me a      little. But I think this to be mere prejudice on my part, which      might be broken down if the loved person showed a willingness to      act a passive part. I should never dare to make an advance,      however.        \"I am restrained by moral and religious considerations from      making my real feelings known, and I feel I should sink in my own      estimation if I gave way, though my natural desire is to do so.      In the face of opportunities (not I mean of _paedicatio_, but of      expression of excessive affection, etc.), or what might be such,      I always fail to speak lest I should forfeit the esteem of the      other person. I have a feeling of surprise when any one I like      evinces a liking for me. I feel that those I love are      immeasurably my superiors, though my reason may tell me it is not      so. I would grovel at their feet, do anything to win a smile from      them, or to make them give me their company.        \"Ordinary bodily contact with the boy I love gives me most      exquisite pleasure, and I never lose an opportunity of bringing      such contact about when it can be done naturally. I feel an      immense desire to embrace, kiss, squeeze, etc., the person, to      generally maul him, and say nice things--the kind of things a man      usually says to a woman. A handshake, the mere presence of the      person, makes me happy and content.        \"I can say with the Albanian: 'If I find myself in the presence      of the beloved, I rest absorbed in gazing on him. Absent, I think      of nought but him. If the beloved unexpectedly appears I fall      into confusion. My heart beats faster. I have eyes and ears only      for the beloved.'        \"I feel that my capacity of affection is finer and more spiritual      than that which commonly subsists between persons of different      sexes. And so, while trying to fight my instincts by religion, I      find my natural feeling to be part of my religion, and its      highest expression. In this sense I can speak from experience in      my own case, and more especially in that of my brother, that what      you have said about philanthropic activity resulting from      repressed homosexuality is very true indeed. I can say with one      of your female cases: 'Love is to me a religion. The very nature      of my affection for my friends precludes the possibility of any      element entering into it which is not absolutely pure and      sacred.' I am, however, madly jealous. I want entire possession,      and I can't bear for a moment that any one I do not care for      should know the person I love.        \"I am never attracted by men older than myself. The youths who      attract me may be of any class, though preferably, I think, of a      class a little lower than myself. I am not quite sure of this,      however, as circumstances may have contributed more than      deliberate choice to bring certain youths under my notice. Those      who have exercised the most powerful influence on me have been an      Oxford undergraduate, a barber's assistant, and a plumber's      apprentice. Though naturally fond of intellectual society, I do      not ask for intellect in those I love. It goes for nothing. I      always prefer their company to that of the most educated persons.      This preference has alienated me to some extent from more refined      and educated circles that formerly I was intimate with.        \"I have been led entirely out of my old habits by association      with younger friends, and now do things which before I should      never have dreamed of doing. My thoughts now are always with      certain youths, and if they speak of leaving the town, or in any      way talk of a future that I cannot share, I suffer horrid      sinkings of the heart and depression of spirits.\"    This case, while it concerns a person of quite different temperament, with  a more innate predisposition to specific perversions, is yet in many  respects analogous to the previous case. There is boot-fetichism; nothing  is felt to be so attractive as the foot-gear, and there is also at the  same time more than this; there is the attraction of repression and  constraint developed into a sexual symbol. In C.P.'s case that symbolism  arises from the experience of an abnormal heterosexual relationship; in  A.N.'s case it is founded on auto-erotic experiences associated with  inversion; in both alike the entire symbolism has become diffused and  generalized.    In the two cases just brought forward we have an erotic symbolism of act  founded on, and closely associated with, an erotic symbolism of object. It  may be instructive to bring forward another case in which no fetichistic  feeling toward an object can be traced, but an erotic symbolism still  clearly exists. In this case pain, even when self-inflicted, has acquired  a symbolic value as a stimulus to tumescence, without any element of  masochism. Such a case serves to"]]]
