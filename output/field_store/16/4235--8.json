The improvements proved a serious stumbling  block in the way of the inventors, who found that an ordinary locomotive  was able to climb a much steeper grade than was commonly supposed. The  first railroads were laid almost level, but it was soon discovered that  a grade of a few feet to the mile was no impediment to progress, and  gradually the grade was steepened.    The inventors of mountain railroad transportation might have been  discouraged by this discovery, but it is a characteristic of an inventor  that he is not set back by opposition, which, in fact, only serves to  stimulate his zeal. The projectors of inclined roads and mountain  engines kept steadily on, and in France, Germany, England, and the  United States many experimental roads were constructed, each of a few  hundred yards in length, and locomotive models were built and put in  motion to the amazement of the general public, who jeered alike at the  contrivances and the contrivers, deeming the former impracticable and  the latter crazy.    But the idea of building a road up the side of a hill was not to be  dismissed. There was money in it for the successful man, so the cranky  inventors kept on at work in spite of the jeers of the rabble and the  discouragements of capitalists loath to invest their money in an  uncertain scheme. To the energy and perseverance of railroad inventors  the success of the mountain railroad is due, as also is the construction  of the various mountain roads, of which the road up Mt. Washington,  finished in 1868, was the first, and the road up Pike's Peak, completed  the other day, was the latest.    Of all the mountain roads which have been constructed since the one up  Mt. Washington was finished, the best known is that which ascends the  world-famous Rigi. With the exception of Mont Blanc, Rigi is, perhaps,  the best known of any peak in the Alps, though it is by no means the  highest, its summit being but 5,905 feet above the level of the sea.  Although scarcely more than a third of the height of some other  mountains in the Alps, it seems much higher because of its isolated  position. Standing as it does between lakes Lucerne, Zug, and Lowertz,  it commands a series of fine views in every direction, and he who looks  from the summit of Rigi, if he does no other traveling in Switzerland,  can gain a fair idea of the Swiss mountain scenery. Many of the most  noted peaks are in sight, and from the Rigi can be seen the three lakes  beneath, the villages which here and there dot the shores, and, further  on, the mighty Alps, with their glaciers and eternal snows.    Many years ago a hotel was built on the summit of the Rigi for the  benefit of the tourists who daily flocked to this remarkable peak to  enjoy the benefit of its wonderful scenery. The mountain is densely  wooded save where the trees have been cut away to clear the land for  pastures. The ease of its ascent by the six or eight mule paths which  had been made, the gradual and almost regular slope, and the throngs of  travelers who resorted to it, made it a favorable place for an  experiment, and to Rigi went the engineers in order to ascertain the  practicability of such a road. The credit of the designs is due to a  German engineer named Regenbach, who, about the year 1861, designed the  idea of a mountain road, and drew up plans not only for the bed but also  for the engine and cars. The scheme dragged. Capitalists were slow to  invest their money in what they deemed a wild and impracticable  undertaking, and even the owners of the land on the Rigi were reluctant  for such an experiment to be tried. But Regenbach persevered, and toward  the close of the decade the inhabitants of Vitznau, at the base of the  Rigi, were astonished to see gangs of laborers begin the work of making  a clearing through the forests on the mountain slope. They inquired what  it meant, and were told that a road up the Rigi was to be made. The  Vitznauers were delighted, for they had no roads, and there was not a  wheeled vehicle in the town, nor a highway by which it could be brought  thither. The idea of a railroad in their desolate mountain region, and,  above all, a railroad up the Rigi, never entered their heads, and a  report which some time after obtained currency in the town, that the  laborers were beginning the construction of a railroad, was greeted with  a shout of derision.    Nevertheless, that was the beginning of the Rigi line, and in May, 1871,  the road was opened for traffic. It begins at Vitznau, on Lake Lucerne,  and extends to the border of the canton and almost to the top of the  mountain. It is 19,000 feet long, and during that distance rises 4,000  feet at an average grade of 1 foot in 4. Though steep, it is by no means  so much so as the Mt. Washington road, which rises 5,285 feet above the  sea, at an average of 1 foot in 3. There are, however, stretches of the  Rigi road at which the grade is about 1 foot in 21/2, which is believed to  be the steepest in the world.    The Rigi road has several special features aside from its terrific  slopes which entitle it to be considered a triumph of the engineer's  skill. About midway up the mountains the builders came to a solid mass  of rock, which presented a barrier that to a surface road was  impassable. They determined to tunnel it, and, after an enormous  expenditure of labor, finished an inclined tunnel 225 feet in length, of  the same gradient as the road. A gorge in the side of the mountain where  a small stream, the Schnurtobel, had cut itself a passage also hindered  their way, and was crossed by a bridge of lattice girder work in three  spans, each 85 feet long. The entire roadbed, from beginning to end, was  cut in the solid rock. A channel was chiseled out to admit the central  beam, which contains the cogs fitting the driving wheel of the  locomotive. The engine is in the rear of the train, and presents the  exceedingly curious feature of a boiler greatly inclined, in order that  at the steeper gradients it may remain almost perpendicular. The coal  and water are contained in boxes over the driving wheels, so that all  the weight of the engine is really concentrated on the cogs--a  precaution to prevent their slipping. The cost of the road, including  three of these strangely constructed locomotives, three passenger  coaches, and three open wagons, was $260,000, and it is a good paying  investment. The fare demanded for the trip up the mountains is 5 francs,  while half that sum is required for the downward passage, and the road  is annually traversed by from 30,000 to 50,000 passengers.    Curious sensations are produced by a ride up this remarkable line. The  seats of the cars are inclined like the boiler of the locomotive, and so  long as the cars are on a level the seats tilt at an angle which renders  it almost impossible to use them. But when the start is made the  frightful tilt places the body in an upright position, and, with the  engine in the rear, the train starts up the hill with an easy, gliding  motion, passing up the ascent, somewhat steeper than the roof of a  house, without the slightest apparent effort. But if the going up  excites tremor, much more peculiar are the feelings aroused on the down  grade. The trip begins with a gentle descent, and all at once the  traveler looking ahead sees the road apparently come an end. On a nearer  approach he is undeceived and observes before him a long decline which  appears too steep even to walk down. Involuntarily he catches at the  seats, expecting a great acceleration of speed. Very nervous are his  feelings as the train approaches this terrible slope, but on coming to  the incline the engine dips and goes on not a whit faster than before  and not more rapidly on the down than on the up grade. Many people are  made sick by the sensation of falling experienced on the down run. Some  faint, and a few years ago one traveler, supposed to be afflicted with  heart disease, died of fright when the train was going over the  Schnurtobel bridge. The danger is really very slight, there not having  been a serious accident since the road was opened. The attendants are  watchful, the brakes are strong, but even with all these safeguards, men  of the steadiest nerves cannot help wondering what would become of them  in case anything went wrong.    Bold as was the project of a railroad on the Rigi, a still bolder scheme  was broached ten years later, when a daring genius proposed a railroad  up Mt. Vesuvius. A railroad up the side of an ordinary mountain seemed  hazardous enough, but to build a line on the slope of a volcano, which  in its eruption had buried cities, and every few years was subject to a  violent spasm, seemed as hazardous as to trust the rails of an ordinary  line to the rotten river ice in spring time. The proposal was not,  however, so impracticable as it looked. While the summit of Vesuvius  changes from time to time from the frequent eruptions, and varies in  height and in the size of the crater, the general slope and contour of  the mountain are about the same to-day as when Vesuvius, a wooded hill,  with a valley and lake in the center of its quiescent crater, served as  the stronghold of Spartacus and his rebel gladiators. There have been  scores of eruptions since that in which Herculaneum and Pompeii were  overthrown, but the sides of the mountain have never been seriously  disturbed.    A road on Vesuvius gave promise of being a good speculation. Naples and  the other resorts of the neighborhood annually attracted many thousands  of visitors, and a considerable number of these every year ascended the  volcano, even when forced to contend with all the difficulties of the  way. Many, however, desiring to ascend, but being unable or unwilling to  walk up, a chair service was established--a peculiar chair being slung  on poles and borne by porters. In course of time the chair service  proved to be inadequate for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13642"],[0,"The Journal of Negro History, Volume 1, January 1916 (#12)"],[1,"ase, we  countenance the infamous violation, and sacrifice at the shrine of cruelty,  all the finer feelings of elevated humanity.    Considering things in this view, there surely can be nothing more justly  reprehensible or disgusting than the extravagant finery of many country  people's daughters. It hath not been at all uncommon to observe as much  gauze, lace and other trappings, on one of those country maidens as hath  employed two or three of her father's slaves, for twelve months afterwards,  to raise tobacco to pay for. Tis an ungrateful reflexion that all this  frippery and effected finery, can only he supported by the sweat of another  person's brow, and consequently only by lawful rapine and injustice. If  these young females could devote as much time from their amusements, as  would be necessary for reflexion; or was there any person of humanity at  hand who could inculcate the indecency of this kind of extravagance, I am  persuaded that they have hearts good enough to reject with disdain, the  momentary pleasure of making a figure, in behalf of the rational and  lasting delight of contributing by their forbearance to the happiness of  many thousand individuals.    In Maryland where slaves are treated with as much lenity, as perhaps they  are any where, their situation is to the last degree ineligible. They live  in wretched cots, that scarcely secure them from the inclemency of the  weather; sleep in the ashes or on straw, wear the coarsest clothing, and  subsist on the most ordinary food that the country produces. In all things  they are subject to their master's absolute command, and, of course, have  no will of their own. Thus circumstanced, they are subject to great  brutality, and are often treated with it. In particular instances, they may  be better provided for in this state, but this suffices for a general  description. But in the Carolinas and the island of Jamaica, the cruelties  that have been wantonly exercised on those miserable creatures, are without  a precedent in any other part of the world. If those who have written on  the subject, may be believed, it is not uncommon there, to tie a slave up  and whip him to death.    On all occasions impartiality in the distribution of justice should be  observed. The little state of Rhode Island has been reprobated by other  states, for refusing to enter into measures respecting a new general  government; and so far it is admitted that she is culpable.[4] But if she  is worthy of blame in this respect, she is entitled to the highest  admiration for the philanthropy, justice, and humanity she hath displayed,  respecting the subject I am treating on. She hath passed an act prohibiting  the importation of slaves into that state, and forbidding her citizens to  engage in the iniquitous traffic. So striking a proof of her strong  attachment to the rights of humanity, will rescue her name from oblivion,  and bid her live in the good opinion of distant and unborn generations.    Slavery, unquestionably, should be abolished, particularly in this country;  because it is inconsistent with the declared principles of the American  Revolution. The sooner, therefore, we set about it, the better. Either we  should set our slaves at liberty, immediately, and colonize them in the  western territory;[5] or we should immediately take measures for the  gradual abolition of it, so that it may become a known, and fixed point,  that ultimately, universal liberty, in these united states, shall  triumph.--This is the least we can do in order to evince our sense of the  irreparable outrages we have committed, to wipe off the odium we have  incurred, and to give mankind a confidence again in the justice,  liberality, and honour of our national proceedings.    It would not be difficult to show, were it necessary, that America would  soon become a richer and more happy country, provided the step was adopted.  That corrosive anguish of persevering in anything improper, which now  embitters the enjoyments of life, would vanish as the mist of a foggy morn  doth before the rising sun; and we should find as great a disparity between  our present situation, and that which would succeed to it, as subsists  between a cloudy winter, and a radiant spring.--Besides, our lands would  not be then cut down for the support of a numerous train of useless  inhabitants--useless, I mean, to themselves, and effectually to us, by  encouraging sloth and voluptuousness among our young farmers and planters,  who might otherwise know how to take care of their money, as well as how to  dissipate it.--In all other respects, I conceive them to be as valuable as  we are--as capable of worthy purposes, and to possess the same dignity that  we do, in the estimation of providence; although the value of their work  apart, for which we are dependent on them, we generally consider them as  good for nothing, and accordingly, treat them with greatest neglect.    But be it remembered, that this cause is the cause of heaven; and that the  father of them as well as of us, will not fail, at a future settlement, to  adjust the account between us, with a dreadful attention to justice.    Othello  Baltimore, May 10, 1788.    --_American Museum_, IV, 412-415.        ESSAY ON NEGRO SLAVERY    _No. II_      Upon no better principle do we plunder the coasts of Africa, and bring away  its wretched inhabitants as slaves than that, by which the greater fish  swallows up the lesser. Superior power seems only to produce superior  brutality; and that weakness and imbecility, which ought to engage our  protection, and interest the feelings of social benevolence in behalf of  the defenceless, seems only to provoke us to acts of illiberal outrage and  unmanly violence.    The practice which has been followed by the English nation, since the  establishment of the slave trade--I mean that of stirring up the natives  of Africa, against each other, with a view of purchasing the prisoners  mutually taken in battle, must strike the humane mind with sentiments of  the deepest abhorrence, and confer on that people a reproach, as lasting  as time itself. It is surprising that the eastern world did not unite, to  discourage a custom so diabolical in its tendency, and to exterminate a  species of oppression which humbles the dignity of all mankind. But this  torpid inattention can only be accounted for, by adverting to the savage  disposition of the times, which countenanced cruelties unheard of at this  enlightened period. What rudeness of demeanor and brutality of manner,  which had been introduced into Europe, by those swarms of barbarians, that  overwhelmed it from the north, had hardly begun to dissipate before the  enlivening sun of civilization, when this infernal practice first sprang  up into existence. Before this distinguished era of refined barbarity, the  sons of Africa were in possession of all the mild enjoyments of peace--all  the pleasing delights of uninterrupted harmony--and all the diffusive  blessings of profound tranquility. Boundless must be the punishment, which  irritated providence will inflict on those whose wanton cruelty has  prompted them to destroy this fair arrangement of nature--this flowery  prospect of human felicity. Engulphed in the dark abyss of never ending  misery, they shall in bitterness atone for the stab thus given to human  nature; and in anguish unutterable expiate crimes, for which nothing less  than eternal sufferings can make adequate retribution!--Equally iniquitous  is the practice of robbing that country of its inhabitants; and equally  tremendous will be the punishment. The voice of injured thousands, who  have been violently torn from their native country, and carried to distant  and inhospitable climes--the bitter lamentations of the wretched, helpless  female--the cruel agonizing sensations of the husband, the father and the  friend--will ascend to the throne of Omnipotence, and, from the elevated  heights of heaven, cause him, with the whole force of almighty vengeance,  to hurl the guilty perpetrators of those inhuman beings, down the steep  precipice of inevitable ruin, into the bottomless gulph of final,  irretrievable, and endless destruction!    Ye sons of America, forbear!--Consider the dire consequences, that will  attend the prosecution, against which the all-powerful God of nature holds  up his hands, and loudly proclaims, desist!    In the insolence of self-consequence, we are accustomed to esteem ourselves  and the Christian powers of Europe, the only civilized people on the  globe; the rest without distinction, we presumptuously denominate  barbarians. But, when the practices above mentioned, come to be  deliberately considered--when added to these, we take a view of the  proceedings of the English in the East Indies, under the direction of the  late Lord Clive, and remember what happened in the streets of Bengal and  Calcutta--when we likewise reflect on our American mode of driving,  butchering and exterminating the poor defenceless Indians, the native and  lawful proprietors of the soil--we shall acknowledge, if we possess the  smallest degree of candor, that the appellation of barbarian does not  belong to them alone. While we continue those practices the term christian  will only be a burlesque expression, signifying no more than that it  ironically denominates the rudest sect of barbarians that ever disgraced  the hand of their Creator. We have the precepts of the gospel for the  government of our moral deportment, in violation of which, those outrageous  wrongs are committed; but they have no such meliorating influence among  them, and only adhere to the simple dictates of reason, and natural  religion, which they never violate.    Might not the inhabitants of Africa, with still greater justice on their  side, than we have on ours, cross the Atlantic, seize our citizens, carry  them into Africa, and make slaves of them, provided they were able to do  it?
