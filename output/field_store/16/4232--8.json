[17] Ellen Key has admirably dealt with proposals of this kind (as put  forth by C.P. Stetson) in her Essays \"On Love and Marriage.\" In opposition  to such proposals Ellen Key suggests that such women as have been properly  trained for maternal duties and are unable entirely to support themselves  while exercising them should be subsidized by the State during the child's  first three years of life. It may be added that in Leipzig the plan of  subsidizing mothers who (under proper medical and other supervision)  suckle their infants has already been introduced.          CHAPTER II.

It may seem to some that in attaching weight to the ancestry, the  parentage, the conception, the gestation, even the first infancy, of the  child we are wandering away from the sphere of the psychology of sex. That  is far from being the case. We are, on the contrary, going to the root of  sex. All our growing knowledge tends to show that, equally with his  physical nature, the child's psychic nature is based on breed and nurture,  on the quality of the stocks he belongs to, and on the care taken at the  early moments when care counts for most, to preserve the fine quality of  those stocks.        It must, of course, be remembered that the influences of both      breed and nurture are alike influential on the fate of the      individual. The influence of nurture is so obvious that few are      likely to under-rate it. The influence of breed, however, is less      obvious, and we may still meet with persons so ill informed, and      perhaps so prejudiced, as to deny it altogether. The growth of      our knowledge in this matter, by showing how subtle and      penetrative is the influence of heredity, cannot fail to dispel      this mischievous notion. No sound civilization is possible except      in a community which in the mass is not only well-nurtured but      well-bred. And in no part of life so much as in the sexual      relationships is the influence of good breeding more decisive. An      instructive illustration may be gleaned from the minute and      precise history of his early life furnished to me by a highly      cultured Russian gentleman. He was brought up in childhood with      his own brothers and sisters and a little girl of the same age      who had been adopted from infancy, the child of a prostitute who      had died soon after the infant's birth. The adopted child was      treated as one of the family, and all the children supposed that      she was a real sister. Yet from early years she developed      instincts unlike those of the children with whom she was      nurtured; she lied, she was cruel, she loved to make mischief,      and she developed precociously vicious sexual impulses; though      carefully educated, she adopted the occupation of her mother, and      at the age of twenty-two was exiled to Siberia for robbery and      attempt to murder. The child of a chance father and a prostitute      mother is not fatally devoted to ruin; but such a child is      ill-bred, and that fact, in some cases, may neutralize all the      influences of good nurture.    When we reach the period of infancy we have already passed beyond the  foundations and potentialities of the sexual life; we are in some cases  witnessing its actual beginnings. It is a well-established fact that  auto-erotic manifestations may sometimes be observed even in infants of  less than twelve months. We are not now called upon to discuss the  disputable point as to how far such manifestations at this age can be  called normal.[18] A slight degree of menstrual and mammary activity  sometimes occurs at birth.[19] It seems clear that nervous and psychic  sexual activity has its first springs at this early period, and as the  years go by an increasing number of individuals join the stream until at  puberty practically all are carried along in the great current.    While, therefore, it is possibly, even probably, true that the soundest  and healthiest individuals show no definite signs of nervous and psychic  sexuality in childhood, such manifestations are still sufficiently  frequent to make it impossible to say that sexual hygiene may be  completely ignored until puberty is approaching.        Precocious physical development occurs as a somewhat rare      variation. W. Roger Williams (\"Precocious Sexual Development with      Abstracts of over One Hundred Cases,\" _British Gynaecological      Journal_, May, 1902) has furnished an important contribution to      the knowledge of this anomaly which is much commoner in girls      than in boys. Roger Williams's cases include only twenty boys to      eighty girls, and precocity is not only more frequent but more      pronounced in girls, who have been known to conceive at eight,      while thirteen is stated to be the earliest age at which boys      have proved able to beget children. This, it may be remarked, is      also the earliest age at which spermatozoa are found in the      seminal fluid of boys; before that age the ejaculations contain      no spermatozoa, and, as Fuerbringer and Moll have found, they may      even be absent at sixteen, or later. In female children      precocious sexual development is less commonly associated with      general increase of bodily development than in boys. (An      individual case of early sexual development in a girl of five has      been completely described and figured in the _Zeitschrift fuer      Ethnologie_, 1896, Heft 4, p. 262.)        Precocious sexual impulses are generally vague, occasional, and      more or less innocent. A case of rare and pronounced character,      in which a child, a boy, from the age of two had been sexually      attracted to girls and women, and directed all his thoughts and      actions to sexual attempts on them, has been described by Herbert      Rich, of Detroit (_Alienist and Neurologist_, Nov., 1905).      General evidence from the literature of the subject as to sexual      precocity, its frequency and significance, has been brought      together by L.M. Terman (\"A Study in Precocity,\" _American      Journal Psychology_, April, 1905).        The erections that are liable to occur in male infants have      usually no sexual significance, though, as Moll remarks, they may      acquire it by attracting the child's attention; they are merely      reflex. It is believed by some, however, and notably by Freud,      that certain manifestations of infant activity, especially      thumb-sucking, are of sexual causation, and that the sexual      impulse constantly manifests itself at a very early age. The      belief that the sexual instinct is absent in childhood, Freud      regards as a serious error, so easy to correct by observation      that he wonders how it can have arisen. \"In reality,\" he remarks,      \"the new-born infant brings sexuality with it into the world,      sexual sensations accompany it through the days of lactation and      childhood, and very few children can fail to experience sexual      activities and feelings before the period of puberty\" (Freud,      \"Zur Sexuellen Aufklaerung der Kinder,\" _Soziale Medizin und      Hygiene_, Bd. ii, 1907; cf., for details, the same author's _Drei      Abhandlungen zur Sexualtheorie_, 1905). Moll, on the other hand,      considers that Freud's views on sexuality in infancy are      exaggerations which must be decisively rejected, though he admits      that it is difficult, if not impossible, to differentiate the      feelings in childhood (Moll, _Das Sexualleben des Kindes_, p.      154). Moll believes also that psycho-sexual manifestations      appearing after the age of eight are not pathological; children      who are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13618"],[0,"The Cathedral Church of Peterborough (#12)"],[1,"the tower); three lilies; three fishes with  intersecting tails. The roof over the apse is flat. It has been  decorated from a design by Sir G.G. Scott, with an emblematical  representation of Christ as a Vine, the Disciples being half-figures in  medallions among the foliage. An inscription bearing upon the subject  forms the border. The general effect will be like, though not identical  with, the original painting in this place. This was one of the  decorations of the church that excited the fury of the soldiers and  others who dismantled the minster in the civil war in the seventeenth  century. \"This is the Idol they worship and adore\" was the cry of some  of the party; upon which muskets were discharged, and the picture wholly  defaced. The description of the design is given in these words:[26]  \"Over this place\" (that is, the altar-screen) \"in the Roof of the  Church, in a large Oval yet to be seen, was the Picture of our Saviour  seated on a Throne, one hand erected, and holding a Globe in the other:  attended with the four Evangelists and Saints on each side, with Crowns  in their hands; intended, I suppose, for a Representation of our  Saviour's coming to judgment.\"    [Illustration: North Transept and Morning Chapel.]    The flat roof of the apse being lower than the roof of the choir, the  space between the levels is filled with twelve painted figures.    The whole of the internal fittings of the choir (speaking now of the  ritual choir) are new, and are part of the recent restoration. The new  woodwork began to be placed in position in 1890. There is indeed a  little old work, which was in the old choir before it was altered in the  early part of this century. When removed, some of the front desks had  been placed in the morning chapel, though much of the projecting tracery  work was taken off. It was realised, when the existing stall-work was  being designed, that these would be very suitable for use in their old  position. Accordingly, all that could be so used have been placed again  in the choir, with their traceried panels restored; and the new work is  made of the same character. The =New Stalls= are of the finest oak, with  miserere seats; the backs have rich tracery, with raised shields,  moulded groined ceilings, and carved bosses at the intersection of the  ribs. They are surmounted by octagonal canopies, in three stages, the  uppermost containing a niche for a carved figure to each stall, while  other figures, of much smaller size, are to be seen below. A few have at  the back the armorial bearings of the donor, or some other symbol, such  as the masonic emblems in those given by the Freemasons of England. The  names of the cathedral officers and others to whom the different stalls  are assigned, have been inscribed on the label at the head of each; the  donor's name is recorded on the seats.    With the exception of the first figure, the whole of the larger figures  at the top of the canopies have some special connection with the  monastery or the cathedral. Beginning at the Dean's stall, and  proceeding eastwards, the statues on the south side represent the  following:--    Two at the summit of the Dean's stall, SS. Paul and  Andrew.    1. S. Peter, the Patron Saint.  2. Saxulf (656), the first Abbot.  3. Adulf (971), Abbot, afterwards Archbishop of York.  4. Kenulf (992), Abbot, afterwards Bishop of Winchester.  5. Leofric (1057), Abbot.  6. Turold (1069), Abbot, appointed by William the Conqueror.  7. Ernulf (1107), Abbot, afterwards Bishop of Rochester.  8. Martin de Bee (1133), Abbot when the choir was dedicated.  9. Benedict (1175), Abbot. He built the greater part, if  not all, of the nave.  10. Martin of Ramsey (1226), Abbot.  11. John of Calais (1249), Abbot. He built the infirmary,  probably the refectory, and part of the cloisters.  12. Richard of London (1274), Abbot. He built the north-western tower.  13. Adam of Boothby (1321), Abbot.  14. William Genge (1396), first mitred Abbot.  15. Richard Ashton (1438), Abbot. He began the new building.  16. Robert Kirton (1496), Abbot. He finished the new  building, and built the Deanery gateway.  17. John Towers (1638), Bishop. Previously Dean (1630).  18. Thomas White (1685), Bishop. Nonjuror.  19. William Connor Magee (1868), Bishop, afterwards Archbishop of York.  20. Simon Patrick (1679), Dean, afterwards Bishop of Chichester,  and finally of Ely.  21. Augustus Page Saunders (1853), Dean.  22. John James Stewart Perowne (1878), Dean, afterwards Bishop of  Worcester.    The upper figures on the north side are these:--    Two at the summit of the Vice-Dean's stall, Kings Wolfere  and Ethelred.[27]    1. Peada, King of Mercia, founder of the monastery.  2. Cuthbald (675), second Abbot.  3. Edgar, King of Mercia and Wessex, restorer of the monastery.  4. Ethelfleda, his queen.  5. Brando (1066), Abbot.  6. Hereward, the Saxon patriot (1070), nephew of Abbot  Brando, and knighted by him.  7. John deSais (1114), Abbot. He commenced the building  of the existing choir.  8. Hedda (died 870), Abbot, murdered by the Danes.  9. Robert of Lindsey (1214), Abbot. He holds a model of  the west front, probably built or begun in his time.  10. Godfrey of Crowland (1299), Abbot. He bears a model  of the gateway to the palace grounds.  11. William Ramsey (1471), Abbot. He was one of the  donors of the brass eagle lectern still in use.  12. William Parys (died 1286), Prior. He built the Lady Chapel.  13. S. Giles, the famous Benedictine Abbot, with his tame  hind beside him.  14. Hugo Candidus, the chronicler.  15. Henry of Overton (1361), Abbot.  16. Queen Katherine of Arragon.  17. John Cosin (1640), Dean, afterwards Bishop of Durham.  18. Simon Gunton (1646), Prebendary, the historian of the church.  19. Herbert Marsh (1819), Bishop.  20. George Davys (1839), Bishop.  21. James Henry Monk (1822), Dean, afterwards Bishop of  Gloucester and Bristol.  22. Marsham Argles (1891), Dean. Previously Canon  (1849).    The dates in the above lists, unless stated otherwise, are the dates of  appointment. With the single exception of Henry of Overton, of whom very  little indeed is known except that he was abbot for nearly thirty years,  the selection that has been made appears to be very good. In some way or  other all the persons represented are eminent. The authorities are to be  congratulated upon their including in the series several dignitaries of  the last century.    The smaller figures on the south side are all characters from the New  Testament; those on the north side are taken from the Old Testament. The  carving on the sides of the two westernmost stalls is of great interest.  The panels on the south represent the miraculous preservation of the arm  of S. Oswald. This arm was one of the greatest treasures of the house,  and was reputed to be the cause of many cures. The legend is given  hereafter in the notice of Abbot Elsinus, the great collector of relics.  In the corresponding position on the north side is represented the story  of S. Ethelwold, Bishop of Winchester. On the back of the stalls in the  south aisle are two pieces of tapestry, picturing the release of S.  Peter and the healing of the lame man at the Gate Beautiful.    The carving on the =Pulpit= and =Throne= will repay careful study. In  the niches at the base of the pulpit are four abbots, chiefly connected  with the erection of the building. They are John de Sais, who holds a  model of the apse, Martin de Bec, William of Waterville, and Walter of  S. Edmunds. Round the main body of the pulpit are four saints in niches,  SS. Peter, Paul, John and James, each easily identified by what is held  in the hand. Between these niches are wide panels carved with subjects  associated with preaching. Abbot Saxulf preaching to the Mercians;  Christ sending forth the Apostles; S. Peter preaching after the descent  of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost.    The throne is raised on three steps. Above the canopy is a lofty spire.  On the sides of the seat are SS. Peter and Paul. On the book board are  symbolical representations of the virtues of Temperance, Wisdom,  Fortitude, and Justice. In the lower tier on the canopy are six figures:  Saxulf, first Abbot; Cuthwin, first Bishop of Leicester; John de Sais;  Benedict; S. Hugh, Bishop of Lincoln, his hand resting on the head of  his tame swan; and John Chambers, last Abbot and first Bishop of  Peterborough. In the upper tier are four Bishops: Bishop Dove, the  theologian; Bishop Cumberland, the philosopher; Bishop Kennett, the  antiquary; and Archbishop Magee, the orator.    One of the statues over the stalls, that representing S. Giles, has also  a figure of a hind; in the representation of S. Hugh of Lincoln on the  throne we see a swan. The hind was really a type of solitude and purity  of life, and as such is found in many ancient carvings and paintings  accompanying various Saints. There is also a legend specially connecting  this creature with S. Giles. In a retreat in a forest in the diocese of  Nismes, the recluse, with one companion, is said to have lived on the  fruits of the earth and the milk of a hind. Some dogs that were out  hunting pursued this hind, and she took refuge in the dwelling of the  Saint. The sportsman, Flavius Wamba, King of the Goths, treated him with  every mark of respect, and gave him land wherewith to endow a monastery.  Of S. Hugh's swan a long account is given in the \"Vita S. Hugonis  Lincolniensis\" published in the Rolls Series. A swan never before seen  at the place flew to the Bishop at his manor at Stowe directly after he  had been enthroned at Lincoln. He became passionately attached to the  bishop, but exhibited no liking for anyone else, he considered himself  bound to protect his master, driving other people away from him, \"As I  myself,\" writes Giraldus Cambrensis, \"have often with wonder seen,\"  with his wings and beak.
