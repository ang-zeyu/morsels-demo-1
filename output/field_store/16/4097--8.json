A  little after we saw several islands, amongst which, to the left of  us, stood Phello, to which these men were going, a city built in the  middle of a large round cork; towards the right hand, and at a  considerable distance, were many others, very large and high, on  which we saw a prodigious large fire:  fronting the prow of our  ship, we had a view of one very broad and flat, and which seemed to  be about five hundred stadia off; as we approached near to it, a  sweet and odoriferous air came round us, such as Herodotus tells us  blows from Arabia Felix; from the rose, the narcissus, the hyacinth,  the lily, the violet, the myrtle, the laurel, and the vine.  Refreshed with these delightful odours, and in hopes of being at  last rewarded for our long sufferings, we came close up to the  island; here we beheld several safe and spacious harbours, with  clear transparent rivers rolling placidly into the sea; meadows,  woods, and birds of all kinds, chanting melodiously on the shore;  and, on the trees, the soft and sweet air fanning the branches on  every side, which sent forth a soft, harmonious sound, like the  playing on a flute; at the same time we heard a noise, not of riot  or tumult, but a kind of joyful and convivial sound, as of some  playing on the lute or harp, with others joining in the chorus, and  applauding them.    We cast anchor and landed, leaving our ship in the harbour with  Scintharus and two more of our companions.  As we were walking  through a meadow full of flowers, we met the guardians of the isle,  who, immediately chaining us with manacles of roses, for these are  their only fetters, conducted us to their king.  From these we  learned, on our journey, that this place was called the Island of  the Blessed, {116a} and was governed by Rhadamanthus.  We were  carried before him, and he was sitting that day as judge to try some  causes; ours was the fourth in order.  The first was that of Ajax  Telamonius, {116b} to determine whether he was to rank with the  heroes or not.  The accusation ran that he was mad, and had made an  end of himself.  Much was said on both sides.  At length  Rhadamanthus pronounced that he should be consigned to the care of  Hippocrates, and go through a course of hellebore, after which he  might be admitted to the Symposium.  The second was a love affair,  to decide whether Theseus or Menelaus should possess Helen in these  regions; and the decree of Rhadamanthus was, that she should live  with Menelaus, who had undergone so many difficulties and dangers  for her; besides, that Theseus had other women, the Amazonian lady  and the daughters of Minos.  The third cause was a point of  precedency between Alexander the son of Philip, and Hannibal the  Carthaginian, which was given in favour of Alexander, who was placed  on a throne next to the elder Cyrus, the Persian.  Our cause came on  the last.  The king asked us how we dared to enter, alone as we  were, into that sacred abode.  We told him everything that had  happened; he commanded us to retire, and consulted with the  assessors concerning us.  There were many in council with him, and  amongst them Aristides, the just Athenian, and pursuant to his  opinion it was determined that we should suffer the punishment of  our bold curiosity after our deaths, but at present might remain in  the island for a certain limited time, associate with the heroes,  and then depart; this indulgence was not to exceed seven months.    At this instant our chains, if so they might be called, dropped off,  and we were left at liberty to range over the city, and to partake  of the feast of the blessed.  The whole city was of gold, {118} and  the walls of emerald; the seven gates were all made out of one trunk  of the cinnamon-tree; the pavement, within the walls, of ivory; the  temples of the gods were of beryl, and the great altars, on which  they offered the hecatombs, all of one large amethyst.  Round the  city flowed a river of the most precious ointment, a hundred cubits  in breadth, and deep enough to swim in; the baths are large houses  of glass perfumed with cinnamon, and instead of water filled with  warm dew.  For clothes they wear spider's webs, very fine, and of a  purple colour.  They have no bodies, but only the appearance of  them, insensible to the touch, and without flesh, yet they stand,  taste, move, and speak.  Their souls seem to be naked, and separated  from them, with only the external similitude of a body, and unless  you attempt to touch, you can scarce believe but they have one; they  are a kind of upright shadows, {119} only not black.  In this place  nobody ever grows old:  at whatever age they enter here, at that  they always remain.  They have no night nor bright day, but a  perpetual twilight; one equal season reigns throughout the year; it  is always spring with them, and no wind blows but Zephyrus.  The  whole region abounds in sweet flowers and shrubs of every kind;  their vines bear twelve times in the year, yielding fruit every  month, their apples, pomegranates, and the rest of our autumnal  produce, thirteen times, bearing twice in the month of Minos.  Instead of corn the fields bring forth loaves of ready-made bread,  like mushrooms.  There are three hundred and sixty-five fountains of  water round the city, as many of honey, and five hundred rather  smaller of sweet-scented oil, besides seven rivers of milk and eight  of wine.    Their symposia are held in a place without the city, which they call  the Elysian Field.  This is a most beautiful meadow, skirted by a  large and thick wood, affording an agreeable shade to the guests,  who repose on couches of flowers; the winds attend upon and bring  them everything necessary, except wine, which is otherwise provided,  for there are large trees on every side made of the finest glass,  the fruit of which are cups of various shapes and sizes.  Whoever  comes to the entertainment gathers one or more of these cups, which  immediately, becomes full of wine, and so they drink of it, whilst  the nightingales and other birds of song, with their bills peck the  flowers out of the neighbouring fields, and drop them on their  heads; thus are they crowned with perpetual garlands.  Their manner  of perfuming them is this.  The clouds suck up the scented oils from  the fountains and rivers, and the winds gently fanning them, distil  it like soft dew on those who are assembled there.  At supper they  have music also, and singing, particularly the verses of Homer, who  is himself generally at the feast, and sits next above Ulysses, with  a chorus of youths and virgins.  He is led in accompanied by Eunomus  the Locrian, {121a} Arion of Lesbos, Anacreon, and Stesichorus,  {121b} whom I saw there along with them, and who at length is  reconciled to Helen.  When they have finished their songs, another  chorus begins of swans, {122a} swallows, and nightingales, and to  these succeeds the sweet rustling of the zephyrs, that whistle  through the woods and close the concert.  What most contributes to  their happiness is, that near the symposium are two fountains, the  one of milk, the other of pleasure; from the first they drink at the  beginning of the feast; there is nothing afterwards but joy and  festivity.    I will now tell you what men of renown I met with there.  And first  there were all the demigods, and all the heroes that fought at Troy  except Ajax the Locrian, {122b} who alone, it seems, was condemned  to suffer for his crimes in the habitations of the wicked.  Then  there were of the barbarians both the Cyruses, Anacharsis the  Scythian, Zamolxis of Thrace, {123a} and Numa the Italian; {123b}  besides these I met with Lycurgus the Spartan, Phocion and Tellus of  Athens, and all the wise men except Periander. {123c}  I saw also  Socrates, the son of Sophroniscus, prating with Nestor and  Palamedes; near him were Hyacinthus of Sparta, Narcissus the  Thespian, Hylas, and several other beauties:  he seemed very fond of  Hyacinthus.  Some things were laid to his charge:  it was even  reported that Rhadamanthus was very angry with him, and threatened  to turn him out of the island if he continued to play the fool, and  would not leave off his irony and sarcasm.  Of all the philosophers,  Plato {123d} alone was not to be found there, but it seems he lived  in a republic of his own building, and which was governed by laws  framed by himself.  Aristippus and Epicurus were in the highest  esteem here as the most polite, benevolent, and convivial of men.  Even AEsop the Phrygian was here, whom they made use of by way of  buffoon.  Diogenes of Sinope had so wonderfully changed his manners  in this place, that he married Lais the harlot, danced and sang, got  drunk, and played a thousand freaks.  Not one Stoic did I see  amongst them; they, it seems, were not yet got up to the top of the  high hill {124a} of virtue; and as to Chrysippus, we were told that  he was not to enter the island till he had taken a fourth dose of  hellebore.  The Academicians, we heard, were very desirous of coming  here, but they stood doubting and deliberating about it, neither  were they quite certain whether there was such a place as Elysium or  not; perhaps they were afraid of Rhadamanthus's judgment {124b} on  them, as decisive judgments are what they would never allow.  Many  of them, it is reported, followed those who were coming to the  island, but being too lazy to proceed, turned back when they were  got half way.    Such were the principal persons whom I met with here.  Achilles is  had in the greatest honour among them, and next to him Theseus.    Two or three days after my "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10444"],[0,"The Peace Negotiations: A Personal Narrative (#12)"],[1,"as to the relative value of the settlement of an  international controversy, which is by its nature justiciable, by a body  of diplomats and of the settlement by a body of trained jurists were  fully set forth in an address which I delivered before the American Bar  Association at its annual meeting at Boston on September 5,1919.    An extract from that address will show the radical difference between  the President's views and mine.       \"While abstract justice cannot [under present conditions] be depended     upon as a firm basis on which to constitute an international concord     for the preservation of peace and good relations between nations,     legal justice offers a common ground where the nations can meet to     settle their controversies. No nation can refuse in the face of the     opinion of the world to declare its unwillingness to recognize the     legal rights of other nations or to submit to the judgment of an     impartial tribunal a dispute involving the determination of such     rights. The moment, however, that we go beyond the clearly defined     field of legal justice we enter the field of diplomacy where national     interests and ambitions are to-day the controlling factors of     national action. Concession and compromise are the chief agents of     diplomatic settlement instead of the impartial application of legal     justice which is essential to a judicial settlement. Furthermore, the     two modes of settlement differ in that a judicial settlement rests     upon the precept that all nations, whether great or small, are equal,     but in the sphere of diplomacy the inequality of nations is not only     recognized, but unquestionably influences the adjustment of     international differences. Any change in the relative power of     nations, a change which is continually taking place, makes more or     less temporary diplomatic settlements, but in no way affects a     judicial settlement.       \"However, then, international society may be organized for the future     and whatever machinery may be set up to minimize the possibilities of     war, I believe that the agency which may be counted upon to function     with certainty is that which develops and applies legal justice.\"    Every other agency, regardless of its form, will be found, when  analyzed, to be diplomatic in character and subject to those impulses  and purposes which generally affect diplomatic negotiations. With a full  appreciation of the advantage to be gained for the world at large  through the common consideration of a vexatious international question  by a body representing all nations, we ought not to lose sight of the  fact that such consideration and the action resulting from it are  essentially diplomatic in nature. It is, in brief, the transference of a  dispute in a particular case from the capitals of the disputants to the  place where the delegates of the nations assemble to deliberate together  on matters which affect their common interests. It does not--and this we  should understand--remove the question from the processes of diplomacy  or prevent the influences which enter into diplomacy from affecting its  consideration. Nor does it to an appreciable extent change the actual  inequality which exists among nations in the matter of power and  influence.       \"On the other hand, justice applied through the agency of an     impartial tribunal clothed with an international jurisdiction     eliminates the diplomatic methods of compromise and concession and     recognizes that before the law all nations are equal and equally     entitled to the exercise of their rights as sovereign and independent     states. In a word, international democracy exists in the sphere of     legal justice and, up to the present time, in no other relation     between nations.       \"Let us, then, with as little delay as possible establish an     international tribunal or tribunals of justice with The Hague Court     as a foundation; let us provide an easier, a cheaper, and better     procedure than now exists; and let us draft a simple and concise body     of legal principles to be applied to the questions to be adjudicated.     When that has been accomplished--and it ought not to be a difficult     task if the delegates of the Governments charged with it are chosen     for their experience and learning in the field of jurisprudence--we     shall, in my judgment, have done more to prevent international wars     through removing their causes than can be done by any other means     that has been devised or suggested.\"    The views, which I thus publicly expressed at Boston in September, 1919,  while the President was upon his tour of the country in favor of the  Covenant of the League of Nations, were the same as those that I held at  Paris in December, 1918, before I had seen the President's first draft  of a Covenant, as the following will indicate.    On December 17, 1918, three days after arriving in Paris, I had, as has  been stated, a long conference with Colonel House on the Peace  Conference and the subjects to come before it. I urged him in the course  of our conversation \"to persuade the President to make the nucleus of  his proposed League of Nations an international court pointing out that  it was the simplest and best way of organizing the world for peace, and  that, if in addition the general principles of international law were  codified and the right of inquiry confided to the court, everything  practical would have been done to prevent wars in the future\" (quoted  from a memorandum of the conversation made at the time). I also urged  upon the Colonel that The Hague Tribunal be made the basis of the  judicial organization, but that it be expanded and improved to meet the  new conditions. I shall have something further to say on this subject.    Reverting now to the draft of articles which I had in form on January 5,  1919, it must be borne in mind that I then had no reason to think that  the President would omit from his plan an independent judicial agency  for the administration of legal justice, although I did realize that he  gave first place to the mutual guaranty and intended to build a League  on that as a nucleus. It did not seem probable that an American, a  student of the political institutions of the United States and familiar  with their operation, would fail to incorporate in any scheme for world  organization a judicial system which would be free from the control and  even from the influence of the political and diplomatic branch of the  organization. The benefit, if not the necessity, of such a division of  authority seemed so patent that the omission of a provision to that  effect in the original draft of the Covenant condemned it to one who  believed in the principles of government which found expression in  American institutions. Fortunately the defect was in a measure cured  before the Commission on the League of Nations formally met to discuss  the subject, though not before the Covenant had been laid before the  American Commissioners.    The articles of a proposed convention for the creation of an  international organization were not intended, as I have said, to form a  complete convention. They were suggestive only of the principal features  of a plan which could, if the President desired, arouse discussion as to  the right theory and the fundamental principles of the international  organization which there seemed little doubt would be declared by the  Paris Conference.    Among the suggested articles there was none covering the subject of  disarmament, because the problem was highly technical requiring the  consideration of military and naval experts. Nor was there any reference  to the mandatory system because there had not been, to my knowledge, any  mention of it at that time in connection with the President's plan,  though General Smuts had given it prominence in his proposed scheme.    During the preparation of these suggestive articles I made a brief  memorandum on the features, which seemed to me salient, of any  international agreement to prevent wars in the future, and which in my  opinion ought to be in mind when drafting such an agreement. The first  three paragraphs of the memorandum follow:       \"There are three doctrines which should be incorporated in the Treaty     of Peace if wars are to be avoided and equal justice is to prevail in     international affairs.       \"These three doctrines may be popularly termed 'Hands Off,' the 'Open     Door,' and 'Publicity.'       \"The first pertains to national possessions and national rights; the     second to international commerce and economic conditions; and the     third, to international agreements.\"    An examination of the articles which I prepared shows that these  doctrines are developed in them, although at the time I was uncertain  whether they ought to appear in the convention creating the League or in  the Preliminary Treaty of Peace, which I believed, in common with the  prevailing belief, would be negotiated. My impression was that they  should appear in the Peace Treaty and possibly be repeated in the League  Treaty, if the two were kept distinct.          CHAPTER V    THE AFFIRMATIVE GUARANTY AND BALANCE OF POWER      While I was engaged in the preparation of these articles for discussion,  which were based primarily on the equality of nations and avoided a  mutual guaranty or other undertaking necessitating a departure from that  principle, M. Clemenceau delivered an important address in the Chamber  of Deputies at its session on December 30, 1918. In this address the  French Premier declared himself in favor of maintaining the doctrine of  \"the balance of power\" and of supporting it by a concert of the Great  Powers. During his remarks he made the following significant assertion,  \"This system of alliances, which I do not renounce, will be my guiding  thought at the Conference, if your confidence sends me to it,"]]]
