[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10738"],[0,"Mahomet, Founder of Islam (#12)"],[1," amid a wealth of gardens, and is renowned  for its fruits and flowers. Thither in 620 Mahomet set out, filled with  the knowledge of his invincible mission, strong in his power to conquer  and persuade. Zeid, his slave and foster-child, was his only companion,  and together they had resolved to convert Taif to the one true religion.  But their adventure was doomed to failure, and though we have necessarily  brief descriptions of it, all Mahomet's biographers naturally passing  quickly over so painful a scene, there is sufficient evidence to show how  really disastrous their venture proved.    The chief men of the city remained unconvinced, and at last the populace,  in one of those blind furies that attack crowds at the sight of  impotence, egged on the rabble to stone them. Chased from the city, sore,  bleeding and despairing, Mahomet found shelter in one of the hill gardens  of the locality. There he was solaced with fruit by some kindly owners of  the place, and there he remained, meditating in profound dejection at his  failure, but still with supreme trust in the support of his God.      \"O Lord, I seek refuge in the light of Thy countenance;    It is Thine to cleanse away the darkness,    And to give peace both for this world and the next.\"    In this valley of Nakhla, too, so runs the tale, he was consoled by  genii, who refreshed him, after the fashion of angels upholding the weary  prophets in the wilderness. Mahomet was now in dire straits; he could not  return to Mecca at once, because the object of his Taif journey was  known; as Taif had spurned him, so he was forced to halt in Hira until he  obtained the protection of Mutaim, an influential man in Mecca, and after  some difficulty made his way back to the city, discredited and solitary,  except for his former followers. For some months he rested in obscurity  and contempt at Mecca, gaining none to his cause, but still filled with  the fervent conviction of his future triumph, which neither wavered  nor faltered. The divine fire which upheld him during the period of  his violent persecution burned within his soul, and never was his  steadfastness of character and faith in himself and his mission more  fully manifested than during these despondent months.    He now began to seek in greater measure the society of women, although  the consuming sexual life of his later years had hardly awakened. While  Khadijah was with him he remained faithful to her, but her bright  presence once withdrawn, he was impelled by a kind of impassioned seeking  to the quest for her substitute, and not finding it in one woman, to  continue his search among others. He now married Sawda, a nonentity with  a certain physical charm but no personality, and sued for the hand of  Ayesha, the small daughter of Abu Bekr.    Mahomet at this time was not blessed with many riches. His frugal,  anxious life led him to perform many small duties of his household for  himself. His food was coarse and often scanty, and he lived among his  followers as one of themselves. It is no small tribute to his singleness  of mind and lofty character that in the \"dreary intercourse of daily  life,\" lived in that primitive, communal fashion, which admits of no  illusions and scarcely any secrets, he retained by the force of  personality the reverence of the faithful, and ever in this hour of  defeat and negation remained their leader and lord--the symbol, in fact,  of their loyalty to Allah, and their supreme belief in his guidance and  care.          CHAPTER VII      THE CHOSEN CITY    Medina, city of exile and despairing beginnings, destined to achieve  glory by difficult ways, only to be eclipsed finally by its mightier  neighbour and mistress, became, rather by chance than by design, the  scene of Mahomet's struggles for temporal power and his ruthless wielding  of the sword for God and Islam. The city lies north-east of Mecca, on the  opposite side of the mountain spur that skirts the eastern boundary.  Always weakly peopled, it remained from immemorial time an arena of  strife, for it was on the borderland, the boundary of several tribes, and  was far enough north for the outer waves of Syrian disturbances to fling  their varying tides upon its shores--a meagre city, always fiercely at  civil warfare, impotent, unfertile.    In the dark days of Judaea's humiliation at the hands of Titus, two  Jewish tribes, the Kainukua and the Koreitza, outcast and desolate, even  as they had been warned in their time of dominion, lighted upon Medina in  desperate search for a dwelling-place and a respite from persecution, and  forthwith took possession of the little hill-girt town. They settled  there, driving out or conciliating the former inhabitants, until in the  fourth century their tenuous prosperity was disturbed by the inroads of  two Bedouin tribes, the Beni Aus and the Beni Khazraj. The desert was  wide, and these tribes were familiar with its manifold opportunities and  devious ways. Against such a foe, who swooped down suddenly upon the  city, plundered and then escaped into the limitless unknown, the Jews had  no chance of reprisal.    Before long the Beni Aus and Khazraj had subjugated the Jewish  communities, and their dominion in Medina was only weakened by their  devastating quarrels among themselves. The city therefore offered a  peculiar opening for the teaching of Islam within it. Its religious life  indeed was varied and chaotic. Jews, Arabian idolaters, immigrants from  Christian Syria, torn by schisms, thronged its public places, and this  confusion of faiths sharpened the religious and debating instincts of its  people. The ground was thus broken up for the reception of the new creed  of one God and of his messenger, who had already divided Mecca into  believers and heretics, and who was spoken of in the city with that awe  that attaches itself to distant marvels.    Intercourse with Mecca was chiefly carried on at the time of the yearly  Pilgrimage; the Greater Pilgrimage, only undertaken during Dzul Hijj,  corresponding then to our March, and in Dzul Hijj, 620, came a band of  strangers over the hills, along the toilsome caravan route to the Kaaba,  the goal of their intentions, the shrine of all their prayers. They  performed all the necessary ceremonies at Mecca, and were proceeding to  Mina, a small valley just east of Mecca, for the completion of their  sacred duties, when they were accosted by Mahomet.    The Prophet was despondent and sceptical of his power to persuade, though  his belief in Allah's might never wavered. He had failed so far to  produce any decisive impression upon the Meccan people, but might there  not be another town in Arabia which would receive his message? The little  band of pilgrims seemed to him sent in answer to his self-distrust, and  his failure at Taif as eclipsed by this sudden success. The caravan  returned to its native city, and there remained little for Mahomet to do  except to wait for the arrival of next year's pilgrims, and to keep  shining and ambient the flame of his religious fervour. He remained in  Mecca virtually on sufferance, and rapidly recognised the uselessness of  attempting any further conversions. His hopes were now definitely set on  Medina, and to this end he seems to devoted himself more than ever to the  perusal and interpretation of the Jewish scriptures.    The portion of the Kuran written at this time contains little else than  Bible stories told and retold to the point of weariness. Lot, of course,  is the characteristic figure; but we also have the life stories of  Abraham, Moses, Jonah, Joseph, and many others. The style has suffered a  marked diminution in poetic qualities. It has become reiterative and even  laboured. He continues his practice of alluding to current events, which  at Medina he was to pursue to the extent of making the Kuran a kind of  spasmodic history of his time, as well as an elementary text-book of law  and morality. In one of the suras--\"The Cow\"--Mahomet makes first mention  of that comfortable doctrine of \"cancelling,\" by which later verses of  the Kuran cancel all previous revelations dealing with the same subject  if these prove contradictory: \"Whatever verses we cancel or cause thee to  forget, we bring a better or its like; knowest thou not that God hath  power over all things?\"    There is not much record in the Kuran of the influence of Christian  thought upon Islam. We have a few stories of Elizabeth and Mary, and  scattered allusions to the despised \"Prophet of the Jews.\" But the great  body of Christian thought, its central dogmas of Incarnation and  Redemption, passed Mahomet entirely by, for his mind was practical and  not speculative, and indeed to himself no less than to his followers the  fundamentals of Christianity were of necessity too philosophic to be  realised with any intensity of belief. The Christian virtues of meekness  and resignation, too, might be respected in the abstract--passages in the  Kuran and tradition assure us they were--but they were so utterly  antagonistic to the fierce, free nature of the Arab that they never  entered into his religious life. Mahomet revered the Founder of  Christianity, and placed Him with John in the second Heaven of his  Immortals, but though He is secure among the teachers of the world, He  can never compete with the omnipotence and glory of the Prophet.    During the period of Mahomet's life immediately preceding his departure  to Medina, we have his personal appearance described in detail by Ali. He  is a man of medium stature, with a magnificent head and a thick, flowing  beard. His eyes were black and ardent, his jaw firm but not prominent. He  looked an upstanding man of open countenance, benignant and powerful,  bearing between his shoulders the sign of his divine mission. He had  great patience, says Ali, and \"in nowise despised the poor for their  poverty, nor honoured the rich for their possessions. Nor if any took him  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10743"],[0,"Moonfleet (#12)"],[1,"of jewels of silver and jewels  of gold; and among those cruel taskmasters, Some of the worst must  certainly have been the tax-gatherers.'           *       *       *       *       *    The first walk I took when I grew stronger and was able to get about was  up to Aunt Jane's, notwithstanding she had never so much as been to ask  after me all these days. She knew, indeed, where I was, for Ratsey had  told her I lay at the Why Not?, explaining that Elzevir had found me one  night on the ground famished and half-dead, yet not saying where. But my  aunt greeted me with hard words, which I need not repeat here; for,  perhaps, she meant them not unkindly, but only to bring me back again to  the right way. She did not let me cross the threshold, holding the door  ajar in her hand, and saying she would have no tavern-loungers in her  house, but that if I liked the Why Not? so well, I could go back there  again for her. I had been for begging her pardon for playing truant; but  when I heard such scurvy words, felt the devil rise in my heart, and only  laughed, though bitter tears were in my eyes. So I turned my back upon  the only home that I had ever known, and sauntered off down the village,  feeling very lone, and am not sure I was not crying before I came again  to the Why Not?    Then Elzevir saw that my face was downcast, and asked what ailed me, and  so I told him how my aunt had turned me away, and that I had no home to  go to. But he seemed pleased rather than sorry, and said that I must come  now and live with him, for he had plenty for both; and that since chance  had led him to save my life, I should be to him a son in David's place.  So I went to keep house with him at the Why Not? and my aunt sent down my  bag of clothes, and would have made over to Elzevir the pittance that my  father left for my keep, but he said it was not needful, and he would  have none of it.          CHAPTER 6    AN ASSAULT                       Surely after all,  The noblest answer unto such  Is perfect stillness when they brawl--_Tennyson_      I have more than once brought up the name of Mr. Maskew; and as I shall  have other things to tell of him later on, I may as well relate here what  manner of man he was. His stature was but medium, not exceeding five feet  four inches, I think; and to make the most of it, he flung his head far  back, and gave himself a little strut in walking. He had a thin face with  a sharp nose that looked as if it would peck you, and grey eyes that  could pierce a millstone if there was a guinea on the far side of it. His  hair, for he wore his own, had been red, though it was now grizzled; and  the colour of it was set down in Moonfleet to his being a Scotchman, for  we thought all Scotchmen were red-headed. He was a lawyer by profession,  and having made money in Edinburgh, had gone so far south as Moonfleet to  get quit, as was said, of the memories of rascally deeds. It was about  four years since he bought a parcel of the Mohune Estate, which had been  breaking up and selling piecemeal for a generation; and on his land stood  the Manor House, or so much of it as was left. Of the mansion I have  spoken before. It was a very long house of two storeys, with a projecting  gable and doorway in the middle, and at each end gabled wings running out  crosswise. The Maskews lived in one of these wings, and that was the only  habitable portion of the place; for as to the rest, the glass was out of  the windows, and in some places the roofs had fallen in. Mr. Maskew made  no attempt to repair house or grounds, and the bough of the great cedar  which the snows had brought down in '49 still blocked the drive. The  entrance to the house was through the porchway in the middle, but more  than one tumble-down corridor had to be threaded before one reached  the inhabited wing; while fowls and pigs and squirrels had possession of  the terrace lawns in front. It was not for want of money that Maskew let  things remain thus, for men said that he was rich enough, only that his  mood was miserly; and perhaps, also, it was the lack of woman's company  that made him think so little of neatness and order. For his wife was  dead; and though he had a daughter, she was young, and had not yet weight  enough to make her father do things that he did not choose.    Till Maskew came there had been none living in the Manor House for a  generation, so the village children used the terrace for a playground,  and picked primroses in the woods; and the men thought they had a right  to snare a rabbit or shoot a pheasant in the chase. But the new owner  changed all this, hiding gins and spring-guns in the coverts, and nailing  up boards on the trees to say he would have the law of any that  trespassed. So he soon made enemies for himself, and before long had  everyone's hand against him. Yet he preferred his neighbour's enmity to  their goodwill, and went about to make it more bitter by getting himself  posted for magistrate, and giving out that he would put down the  contraband thereabouts. For no one round Moonfleet was for the Excise;  but farmers loved a glass of Schnapps that had never been gauged, and  their wives a piece of fine lace from France. And then came the affair  between the _Elector_ and the ketch, with David Block's death; and after  that they said it was not safe for Maskew to walk at large, and that he  would be found some day dead on the down; but he gave no heed to it, and  went on as if he had been a paid exciseman rather than a magistrate.    When I was a little boy the Manor woods were my delight, and many a sunny  afternoon have I sat on the terrace edge looking down over the village,  and munching red quarantines from the ruined fruit gardens. And though  this was now forbidden, yet the Manor had still a sweeter attraction to  me than apples or bird-batting, and that was Grace Maskew. She was an  only child, and about my own age, or little better, at the time of which  I am speaking. I knew her, because she went every day to the old  almshouses to be taught by the Reverend Mr. Glennie, from whom I also  received my schooling. She was tall for her age, and slim, with a thin  face and a tumble of tawny hair, which flew about her in a wind or when  she ran. Her frocks were washed and patched and faded, and showed more of  her arms and legs than the dressmaker had ever intended, for she was a  growing girl, and had none to look after her clothes. She was a favourite  playfellow with all, and an early choice for games of 'prisoner's base',  and she could beat most of us boys at speed. Thus, though we all hated  her father, and had for him many jeering titles among ourselves; yet we  never used an evil nickname nor a railing word against him when she was  by, because we liked her well.    There were a half-dozen of us boys, and as many girls, whom Mr. Glennie  used to teach; and that you may see what sort of man Maskew was, I will  tell you what happened one day in school between him and the parson. Mr.  Glennie taught us in the almshouses; for though there were now no  bedesmen, and the houses themselves were fallen to decay, yet the little  hall in which the inmates had once dined was still maintained, and served  for our schoolroom. It was a long and lofty room, with a high wainscot  all round it, a carved oak screen at one end, and a broad window at the  other. A very heavy table, polished by use, and sadly besmirched with  ink, ran down the middle of the hall with benches on either side of it  for us to use; and a high desk for Mr. Glennie stood under the window at  the end of the room. Thus we were sitting one morning with our  summing-slates and grammars before us when the door in the screen opens  and Mr. Maskew enters.    I have told you already of the verses which Mr. Glennie wrote for David  Block's grave; and when the floods had gone down Ratsey set up the  headstone with the poetry carved on it. But Maskew, through not going to  church, never saw the stone for weeks, until one morning, walking through  the churchyard, he lighted on it, and knew the verses for Mr. Glennie's.  So 'twas to have it out with the parson that he had come to school this  day; and though we did not know so much then, yet guessed from his  presence that something was in the wind, and could read in his face that  he was very angry. Now, for all that we hated Maskew, yet were we glad  enough to see him there, as hoping for something strange to vary the  sameness of school, and scenting a disturbance in the air. Only Grace was  ill at ease for fear her father should say something unseemly, and kept  her head down with shocks of hair falling over her book, though I could  see her blushing between them. So in vapours Maskew, and with an angry  glance about him makes straight for the desk where our master sits at the  top of the room.    For a moment Mr. Glennie, being shortsighted, did not see who 'twas; but  as his visitor drew near, rose courteously to greet him.    'Good day to you, Mister Maskew,' says he, holding out his hand.    But Maskew puts his arms behind his back and bubbles out, 'Hold not out  your hand to me lest I spit on it. 'Tis like your snivelling cant to  write sweet psalms for smuggling rogues and try to frighten honest men  with your judgements.'    At first Mr. Glennie did not know what the other would be at, and  afterwards understanding, turned very pale; but said as a minister he  would never be backward in reproving those whom he considered in the  wrong, whether from the pulpit or from the gravestone. Then Maskew  flies into a great passion, and pours out many vile and insolent words,  saying Mr. Glennie is in league with the smugglers and fattens on their  crimes; that the poetry is a libel; and that he, Maskew, will have the  law of him for calumny.    After that he took Grace by the arm, and bade her get hat and cape and  come with him. 'For,' says he, 'I will not have thee taught any more by a"]]]
