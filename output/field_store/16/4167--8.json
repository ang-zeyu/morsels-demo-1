His parents Charlie and Anna Dorsey were natives of Maryland  and free people. In those days, Dorsey relates there were people known  as \"Nigger Traders\" who used any subterfuge to catch Negroes and sell  them into slavery. There was one Jeff Davis who was known as a  professional \"Nigger Trader,\" his slave boat docked in the slip at  Maryland and Jeff Davis and his henchmen went out looking for their  victims. Unfortunately, his mother Anna and his father were caught one  night and were bound and gagged and taken to Jeff Davis' boat which was  waiting in the harbor, and there they were put into stocks. The boat  stayed in port until it was loaded with Negroes, then sailed for Florida  where Davis disposed of his human cargo.    Douglas Dorsey's parents were sold to Colonel Louis Matair, who had a  large plantation that was cultivated by 85 slaves. Colonel Matair's  house was of the pretentious southern colonial type which was quite  prevalent during that period. The colonel had won his title because of  his participation in the Indian War in Florida. He was the typical  wealthy southern gentleman, and was very kind to his slaves. His wife,  however was just the opposite. She was exceedingly mean and could easily  be termed a tyrant.    There were several children in the Matair family and their home and  plantation were located in Suwannee County, Florida.    Douglas' parents were assigned to their tasks, his mother was house-maid  and his father was the mechanic, having learned this trade in Maryland  as a free man. Charlie and Anna had several children and Douglas was  among them. When he became large enough he was kept in the Matair home  to build fires, assist in serving meals and other chores.    Mrs. Matair being a very cruel woman, would whip the slaves herself for  any misdemeanor. Dorsey recalls an incident that is hard to obliterate  from his mind, it is as follows: Dorsey's mother was called by Mrs.  Matair, not hearing her, she continued with her duties, suddenly Mrs.  Matair burst out in a frenzy of anger over the woman not answering. Anna  explained that she did not hear her call, thereupon Mrs. Matair seized a  large butcher knife and struck at Anna, attempting to ward off the blow,  Anna received a long gash on the arm that laid her up for for some  time. Young Douglas was a witness to this brutal treatment of his mother  and he at that moment made up his mind to kill his mistress. He intended  to put strychnine that was used to kill rats into her coffee that he  usually served her. Fortunately freedom came and saved him of this act  which would have resulted in his death.    He relates another incident in regard to his mistress as follows: To his  mother and father was born a little baby boy, whose complexion was  rather light. Mrs. Matair at once began accusing Colonel Matair as being  the father of the child. Naturally the colonel denied, but Mrs. Matair  kept harassing him about it until he finally agreed to his wife's desire  and sold the child. It was taken from its mother's breast at the age of  eight months and auctioned off on the first day of January to the  highest bidder. The child was bought by a Captain Ross and taken across  the Suwannee River into Hamilton County. Twenty years later he was  located by his family, he was a grown man, married and farming.    Young Douglas had the task each morning of carrying the Matair  children's books to school. Willie, a boy of eight would teach Douglas  what he learned in school, finally Douglas learned the alphabet and  numbers. In some way Mrs. Matair learned that Douglas was learning to  read and write. One morning after breakfast she called her son Willie to  the dining room where she was seated and then sent for Douglas to come  there too. She then took a quill pen the kind used at that time, and  began writing the alphabet and numerals as far as ten. Holding the paper  up to Douglas, she asked him if he knew what they were; he proudly  answered in the affirmative, not suspecting anything. She then asked him  to name the letters and numerals, which he did, she then asked him to  write them, which he did. When he reached the number ten, very proud of  his learning, she struck him a heavy blow across the face, saying to him  \"If I ever catch you making another figure anywhere I'll cut off your  right arm.\" Naturally Douglas and also her son Willie were much  surprised as each thought what had been done was quite an achievement.  She then called Mariah, the cook to bring a rope and tying the two of  them to the old colonial post on the front porch, she took a chair and  sat between the two, whipping them on their naked backs for such a time,  that for two weeks their clothes stuck to their backs on the lacerated  flesh.    To ease the soreness, Willie would steal grease from the house and  together they would slip into the barn and grease each other's backs.    As to plantation life, Dorsey said that the slaves lived in quarters  especially built for them on the plantation. They would leave for the  fields at \"sun up\" and remain until \"sun-down,\" stopping only for a meal  which they took along with them.    Instead of having an overseer they had what was called a \"driver\" by  the name of Januray[TR:?]. His duties were to get the slaves together in  the morning and see that they went to the fields and assigned them to  their tasks. He worked as the other slaves, though, he had more  priveliges. He would stop work at any time he pleased and go around to  inspect the work of the others, and thus rest himself. Most of the  orders from the master were issued to him. The crops consisted of  cotton, corn, cane and peas, which was raised in abundance.    When the slaves left the fields, they returned to their cabins and after  preparing and eating of their evening meal they gathered around a cabin  to sing and moan songs seasoned with African melody. Then to the tune of  an old fiddle they danced a dance called the \"Green Corn Dance\" and \"Cut  the Pigeon wing.\" Sometimes the young men on the plantation would slip  away to visit a girl on another plantation. If they were caught by the  \"Patrols\" while on these visits they would be lashed on the bare backs  as a penalty for this offense.    A whipping post was used for this purpose. As soon as one slave was  whipped, he was given the whip to whip his brother slave. Very often the  lashes would bring blood very soon from the already lacerated skin, but  this did not stop the lashing until one had received their due number of  lashes.    Occasionally the slaves were ordered to church to hear a white  minister, they were seated in the front pews of the master's church,  while the whites sat in the rear. The minister's admonition to them to  honor their masters and mistresses, and to have no other God but them,  as \"we cannot see the other God, but you can see your master and  mistress.\" After the services the driver's wife who could read and write  a little would tell them that what the minister said \"was all lies.\"    Douglas says that he will never forget when he was a lad 14 years of  age, when one evening he was told to go and tell the driver to have all  the slaves come up to the house; soon the entire host of about 85 slaves  were gathered there all sitting around on stumps, some standing. The  colonel's son was visibly moved as he told them they were free. Saying  they could go anywhere they wanted to for he had no more to do with  them, or that they could remain with him and have half of what was  raised on the plantation.    The slaves were happy at this news, as they had hardly been aware that  there had been a war going on. None of them accepted the offer of the  colonel to remain, as they were only too glad to leaver the cruelties of  the Matair plantation.    Dorsey's father got a job with Judge Carraway of Suwannee where he  worked for one year. He later homesteaded 40 acres of land that he  received from the government and began farming. Dorsey's father died in  Suwannee County, Florida when Douglas was a young man and then he and  his mother moved to Arlington, Florida. His mother died several years  ago at a ripe old age.    Douglas Dorsey, aged but with a clear mind lives with his daughter in  Spring Glen.      REFERENCE    1.

Richardson, Field Worker  Brooksville, Florida    AMBROSE DOUGLASS      In 1861, when he was 16 years old, Ambrose Hilliard Douglass was given a  sound beating by his North Carolina master because he attempted to  refuse the mate that had been given to him--with the instructions to  produce a healthy boy-child by her--and a long argument on the value of  having good, strong, healthy children. In 1937, at the age of 92,  Ambrose Douglass welcomed his 38th child into the world.    The near-centenarian lives near Brooksville, in Hernando County, on a  run-down farm that he no longer attempts to tend now that most of his 38  children have deserted the farm for the more lucrative employment of the  cities of the phosphate camps.    Douglass was born free in Detroit in 1845. His parents returned South to  visit relatives still in slavery, and were soon reenslaved themselves,  with their children. Ambrose was one of these.    For 21 years he remained in slavery; sometimes at the plantation of his  original master in North Carolina, sometimes in other sections after he  had been sold to different masters.    \"Yassuh, I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12299"],[0,"The Mechanical Properties of Wood (#12)"],[1,"   |  |   white           |     145    |     187    |  | Hemlock           |     168    |     151    |  | Pine, lodgepole   |     142    |     140    |  |   longleaf        |     187    |     180    |  |   red             |     161    |     154    |  |   sugar           |     168    |     189    |  |   western yellow  |     162    |     187    |  |   white           |     144    |     160    |  | Spruce, Engelmann |     110    |     135    |  | Tamarack          |     167    |     159    |  |---------------------------------------------|          PART II FACTORS  AFFECTING THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF WOOD        INTRODUCTION      Wood is an organic product--a structure of infinite variation of  detail and design.[17] It is on this account that no two woods  are alike--in reality no two specimens from the same log are  identical. There are certain properties that characterize each  species, but they are subject to considerable variation. Oak,  for example, is considered hard, heavy, and strong, but some  pieces, even of the same species of oak, are much harder,  heavier, and stronger than others. With hickory are associated  the properties of great strength, toughness, and resilience, but  some pieces are comparatively weak and brash and ill-suited for  the exacting demands for which good hickory is peculiarly  adapted.    [Footnote 17: For details regarding the structure of wood see  Record, Samuel J.: Identification of the economic woods of the  United States. New York, John Wiley & Sons, 1912.]    It follows that no definite value can be assigned to the  properties of any wood and that tables giving average results of  tests may not be directly applicable to any individual stick.  With sufficient knowledge of the intrinsic factors affecting the  results it becomes possible to infer from the appearance of  material its probable variation from the average. As yet too  little is known of the relation of structure and chemical  composition to the mechanical and physical properties to permit  more than general conclusions.        RATE OF GROWTH      To understand the effect of variations in the rate of growth it  is first necessary to know how wood is formed. A tree increases  in diameter by the formation, between the old wood and the inner  bark, of new woody layers which envelop the entire stem, living  branches, and roots. Under ordinary conditions one layer is  formed each year and in cross section as on the end of a log  they appear as rings--often spoken of as _annual rings_. These  growth layers are made up of wood cells of various kinds, but  for the most part fibrous. In timbers like pine, spruce,  hemlock, and other coniferous or softwood species the wood cells  are mostly of one kind, and as a result the material is much  more uniform in structure than that of most hardwoods. (See  Frontispiece.) There are no vessels or pores in coniferous wood  such as one sees so prominently in oak and ash, for example.  (See Fig. 22.)    [Illustration: FIG. 22.--Cross sections of a ring-porous  hardwood (white ash), a diffuse-porous hardwood (red gum), and a  non-porous or coniferous wood (eastern hemlock). X 30.  _Photomicrographs by the author._]    The structure of the hardwoods is more complex. They are more or  less filled with vessels, in some cases (oak, chestnut, ash)  quite large and distinct, in others (buckeye, poplar, gum) too  small to be seen plainly without a small hand lens. In  discussing such woods it is customary to divide them into two  large classes--_ring-porous_ and _diffuse-porous_. (See Fig.  22.) In ring-porous species, such as oak, chestnut, ash, black  locust, catalpa, mulberry, hickory, and elm, the larger vessels  or pores (as cross sections of vessels are called) become  localized in one part of the growth ring, thus forming a region  of more or less open and porous tissue. The rest of the ring is  made up of smaller vessels and a much greater proportion of wood  fibres. These fibres are the elements which give strength and  toughness to wood, while the vessels are a source of weakness.    In diffuse-porous woods the pores are scattered throughout the  growth ring instead of being collected in a band or row.  Examples of this kind of wood are gum, yellow poplar, birch,  maple, cottonwood, basswood, buckeye, and willow. Some species,  such as walnut and cherry, are on the border between the two  classes, forming a sort of intermediate group.    If one examines the smoothly cut end of a stick of almost any  kind of wood, he will note that each growth ring is made up of  two more or less well-defined parts. That originally nearest the  centre of the tree is more open textured and almost invariably  lighter in color than that near the outer portion of the ring.  The inner portion was formed early in the season, when growth  was comparatively rapid and is known as _early wood_ (also  spring wood); the outer portion is the _late wood_, being  produced in the summer or early fall. In soft pines there is not  much contrast in the different parts of the ring, and as a  result the wood is very uniform in texture and is easy to work.  In hard pine, on the other hand, the late wood is very dense and  is deep-colored, presenting a very decided contrast to the soft,  straw-colored early wood. (See Fig. 23.) In ring-porous woods  each season's growth is always well defined, because the large  pores of the spring abut on the denser tissue of the fall  before. In the diffuse-porous, the demarcation between rings is  not always so clear and in not a few cases is almost, if not  entirely, invisible to the unaided eye. (See Fig. 22.)    [Illustration: FIG. 23.--Cross section of longleaf pine showing  several growth rings with variations in the width of the  dark-colored late wood. Seven resin ducts are visible. X 33.  _Photomicrograph by U.S. Forest Service_]    If one compares a heavy piece of pine with a light specimen it  will be seen at once that the heavier one contains a larger  proportion of late wood than the other, and is therefore  considerably darker. The late wood of all species is denser than  that formed early in the season, hence the greater the  proportion of late wood the greater the density and strength.  When examined under a microscope the cells of the late wood are  seen to be very thick-walled and with very small cavities, while  those formed first in the season have thin walls and large  cavities. The strength is in the walls, not the cavities. In  choosing a piece of pine where strength or stiffness is the  important consideration, the principal thing to observe is the  comparative amounts of early and late wood. The width of ring,  that is, the number per inch, is not nearly so important as the  proportion of the late wood in the ring.    It is not only the proportion of late wood, but also its  quality, that counts. In specimens that show a very large  proportion of late wood it may be noticeably more porous and  weigh considerably less than the late wood in pieces that  contain but little. One can judge comparative density, and  therefore to some extent weight and strength, by visual  inspection.    The conclusions of the U.S. Forest Service regarding the effect  of rate of growth on the properties of Douglas fir are  summarized as follows:    \"1. In general, rapidly grown wood (less than eight rings per  inch) is relatively weak. A study of the individual tests upon  which the average points are based shows, however, that when it  is not associated with light weight and a small proportion of  summer wood, rapid growth is not indicative of weak wood.    \"2. An average rate of growth, indicated by from 12 to 16 rings  per inch, seems to produce the best material.    \"3. In rates of growths lower than 16 rings per inch, the  average strength of the material decreases, apparently  approaching a uniform condition above 24 rings per inch. In such  slow rates of growth the texture of the wood is very uniform,  and naturally there is little variation in weight or strength.    \"An analysis of tests on large beams was made to ascertain if  average rate of growth has any relation to the mechanical  properties of the beams. The analysis indicated conclusively  that there was no such relation. Average rate of growth [without  consideration also of density], therefore, has little  significance in grading structural timber.\"[18] This is because  of the wide variation in the percentage of late wood in  different parts of the cross section.    [Footnote 18: Bul. 88: Properties and uses of Douglas fir, p.  29.]    Experiments seem to indicate that for most species there is a  rate of growth which, in general, is associated with the  greatest strength, especially in small specimens. For eight  conifers it is as follows:[19]    [Footnote 19: Bul. 108, U. S. Forest Service: Tests of  structural timbers, p. 37.]                      Rings per inch  Douglas fir             24  Shortleaf pine          12  Loblolly pine            6  Western larch           18  Western hemlock         14  Tamarack                20  Norway pine             18  Redwood                 30    No satisfactory explanation can as yet be given for the real  causes underlying the formation of early and late wood. Several  factors may be involved. In conifers, at least, rate of growth  alone does not determine the proportion of the two portions of  the ring, for in some cases the wood of slow growth is very hard  and heavy, while in others the opposite is true. The quality of  the site where the tree grows undoubtedly affects the character  of the wood formed, though it is not possible to formulate a  rule governing it. In general, however, it may be said that  where strength or ease of working is essential, woods of  moderate to slow growth should be chosen. But in choosing a  particular specimen it is not the width of ring, but the  proportion and character of the late wood which should govern.    In the case of the ring-po"]]]
