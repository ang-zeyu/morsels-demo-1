'You are a philosopher,' said the lady, 'and a lover of liberty. You  are the author of a treatise, called \"Philosophical Gas; or, a Project  for a General Illumination of the Human Mind.\"'    'I am,' said Scythrop, delighted at this first blossom of his renown.    'I am a stranger in this country,' said the lady; 'I have been but a  few days in it, yet I find myself immediately under the necessity of  seeking refuge from an atrocious persecution. I had no friend to whom  I could apply; and, in the midst of my difficulties, accident threw  your pamphlet in my way. I saw that I had, at least, one kindred mind  in this nation, and determined to apply to you.'    'And what would you have me do?' said Scythrop, more and more amazed,  and not a little perplexed.    'I would have you,' said the young lady, 'assist me in finding some  place of retreat, where I can remain concealed from the indefatigable  search that is being made for me. I have been so nearly caught once or  twice already, that I cannot confide any longer in my own ingenuity.'    Doubtless, thought Scythrop, this is one of my golden candle-sticks.  'I have constructed,' said he, 'in this tower, an entrance to a small  suite of unknown apartments in the main building, which I defy any  creature living to detect. If you would like to remain there a day or  two, till I can find you a more suitable concealment, you may rely on  the honour of a transcendental eleutherarch.'    'I rely on myself,' said the lady. 'I act as I please, go where I  please, and let the world say what it will. I am rich enough to set  it at defiance. It is the tyrant of the poor and the feeble, but the  slave of those who are above the reach of its injury.'    Scythrop ventured to inquire the name of his fair _protegee_. 'What  is a name?' said the lady: 'any name will serve the purpose of  distinction. Call me Stella. I see by your looks,' she added, 'that  you think all this very strange. When you know me better, your  surprise will cease. I submit not to be an accomplice in my sex's  slavery. I am, like yourself, a lover of freedom, and I carry my  theory into practice. _They alone are subject to blind authority who  have no reliance on their own strength_.'    Stella took possession of the recondite apartments. Scythrop intended  to find her another asylum; but from day to day he postponed his  intention, and by degrees forgot it. The young lady reminded him of  it from day to day, till she also forgot it. Scythrop was anxious to  learn her history; but she would add nothing to what she had already  communicated, that she was shunning an atrocious persecution. Scythrop  thought of Lord C. and the Alien Act, and said, 'As you will not  tell your name, I suppose it is in the green bag.' Stella, not  understanding what he meant, was silent; and Scythrop, translating  silence into acquiescence, concluded that he was sheltering an  _illuminee_ whom Lord S. suspected of an intention to take the  Tower, and set fire to the Bank: exploits, at least, as likely to be  accomplished by the hands and eyes of a young beauty, as by a drunken  cobbler and doctor, armed with a pamphlet and an old stocking.    Stella, in her conversations with Scythrop, displayed a highly  cultivated and energetic mind, full of impassioned schemes of liberty,  and impatience of masculine usurpation. She had a lively sense of all  the oppressions that are done under the sun; and the vivid pictures  which her imagination presented to her of the numberless scenes of  injustice and misery which are being acted at every moment in every  part of the inhabited world, gave an habitual seriousness to her  physiognomy, that made it seem as if a smile had never once hovered on  her lips. She was intimately conversant with the German language and  literature; and Scythrop listened with delight to her repetitions of  her favourite passages from Schiller and Goethe, and to her encomiums  on the sublime Spartacus Weishaupt, the immortal founder of the sect  of the Illuminati. Scythrop found that his soul had a greater capacity  of love than the image of Marionetta had filled. The form of Stella  took possession of every vacant corner of the cavity, and by degrees  displaced that of Marionetta from many of the outworks of the citadel;  though the latter still held possession of the _keep_. He judged, from  his new friend calling herself Stella, that, if it were not her real  name, she was an admirer of the principles of the German play from  which she had taken it, and took an opportunity of leading the  conversation to that subject; but to his great surprise, the lady  spoke very ardently of the singleness and exclusiveness of love, and  declared that the reign of affection was one and indivisible; that it  might be transferred, but could not be participated. 'If I ever love,'  said she, 'I shall do so without limit or restriction. I shall hold  all difficulties light, all sacrifices cheap, all obstacles gossamer.  But for love so total, I shall claim a return as absolute. I will have  no rival: whether more or less favoured will be of little moment. I  will be neither first nor second--I will be alone. The heart which I  shall possess I will possess entirely, or entirely renounce.'    Scythrop did not dare to mention the name of Marionetta; he trembled  lest some unlucky accident should reveal it to Stella, though he  scarcely knew what result to wish or anticipate, and lived in the  double fever of a perpetual dilemma. He could not dissemble to himself  that he was in love, at the same time, with two damsels of minds and  habits as remote as the antipodes. The scale of predilection always  inclined to the fair one who happened to be present; but the absent  was never effectually outweighed, though the degrees of exaltation and  depression varied according to accidental variations in the outward  and visible signs of the inward and spiritual graces of his respective  charmers. Passing and repassing several times a day from the company  of the one to that of the other, he was like a shuttlecock between two  battledores, changing its direction as rapidly as the oscillations of  a pendulum, receiving many a hard knock on the cork of a sensitive  heart, and flying from point to point on the feathers of a  super-sublimated head. This was an awful state of things. He had  now as much mystery about him as any romantic transcendentalist or  transcendental romancer could desire. He had his esoterical and his  exoterical love. He could not endure the thought of losing either of  them, but he trembled when he imagined the possibility that some fatal  discovery might deprive him of both. The old proverb concerning two  strings to a bow gave him some gleams of comfort; but that concerning  two stools occurred to him more frequently, and covered his forehead  with a cold perspiration. With Stella, he could indulge freely in all  his romantic and philosophical visions. He could build castles in the  air, and she would pile towers and turrets on the imaginary edifices.  With Marionetta it was otherwise: she knew nothing of the world and  society beyond the sphere of her own experience. Her life was all  music and sunshine, and she wondered what any one could see to  complain of in such a pleasant state of things. She loved Scythrop,  she hardly knew why; indeed she was not always sure that she loved him  at all: she felt her fondness increase or diminish in an inverse ratio  to his. When she had manoeuvred him into a fever of passionate love,  she often felt and always assumed indifference: if she found that her  coldness was contagious, and that Scythrop either was, or pretended to  be, as indifferent as herself, she would become doubly kind, and raise  him again to that elevation from which she had previously thrown him  down. Thus, when his love was flowing, hers was ebbing: when his was  ebbing, hers was flowing. Now and then there were moments of level  tide, when reciprocal affection seemed to promise imperturbable  harmony; but Scythrop could scarcely resign his spirit to the pleasing  illusion, before the pinnace of the lover's affections was caught in  some eddy of the lady's caprice, and he was whirled away from the  shore of his hopes, without rudder or compass, into an ocean of mists  and storms. It resulted, from this system of conduct, that all that  passed between Scythrop and Marionetta, consisted in making and  unmaking love. He had no opportunity to take measure of her  understanding by conversations on general subjects, and on his  favourite designs; and, being left in this respect to the exercise of  indefinite conjecture, he took it for granted, as most lovers would do  in similar circumstances, that she had great natural talents, which  she wasted at present on trifles: but coquetry would end with  marriage, and leave room for philosophy to exert its influence on her  mind. Stella had no coquetry, no disguise: she was an enthusiast in  subjects of general interest; and her conduct to Scythrop was always  uniform, or rather showed a regular progression of partiality which  seemed fast ripening into love.           *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER XI      Scythrop, attending one day the summons to dinner, found in the  drawing-room his friend Mr Cypress the poet, whom he had known at  college, and who was a great favourite of Mr Glowry.

There are in the British Museum several fragments of Neo-Babylonian  copies of the Seven Tablets of Creation, the exact position of which is  at present uncertain. One of these (S. 2013) is of some importance  because it speaks of one object which was in the \"upper Tiamat\", and of  another which was in the \"lower Tiamat\". This shows that the Babylonians  thought that one half of the body of Tiamat, which was split up by  Marduk, was made into the celestial ocean, and the other half into the  terrestrial ocean, in other words, into \"the waters that were above\" and  \"the waters that were beneath\" the firmament respectively.    2. When George Smith published his _Chaldean Account of Genesis_  in 1876, he was of opinion that the Creation Tablets in the British  Museum contained descriptions of the Temptation of Eve by the serpent  and of the building and overthrow of the Tower of Babel.  The  description of Paradise in Genesis ii seems to show traces of  Babylonian influence, and the cylinder seal, Brit. Mus. No. 89,326,  was thought to be proof that a Babylonian legend of the Temptation  existed. In fact, George Smith printed a copy of the seal in his book  (p. 91). But it is now known that the tablet which was believed to  refer to man's eating of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge (K. 3, 473  + 79-7-8, 296 + R. 615) describes the banquet of the gods to which  they invited Marduk. In like manner the text on K. 3657, which Smith  thought referred to the Tower of Babel, is now known to contain no  mention of a tower or building of any sort. It was also thought by him  that K. 3364 contained a set of instructions which God gave to Adam  and Eve after their creation, but it is now known and admitted by all  Assyriologists that the text on this tablet contains moral precepts  and has nothing to do with the Creation Series. Enquiries are from  time to time made at the Museum for tablets which deal with the  Temptation of Eve, and the destruction of the Tower of Babel, and the  Divine commands to Adam and Eve; it is perhaps not superfluous to say  that nothing of the kind exists.
