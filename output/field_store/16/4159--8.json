Love lit the flame, and Love himself allays    My burning fever, as when gathering clouds    Rise o'er the earth in summer's dazzling noon,    And grateful showers dispel the morning heat.    [S']AKOONTALA.    You must consent, then, dear friends, to contrive some means by  which I may find favour with the King, or you will have ere long  to assist at my funeral.    KING.    Enough! These words remove all my doubts.    PRIYAMVADA.                                  [_Aside to_ ANASUYA.    She is far gone in love, dear Anasuya, and no time ought to be  lost. Since she has fixed her affections on a monarch who is the  ornament of Puru's line, we need not hesitate for a moment to  express our approval.    ANASUYA.    I quite agree with you.    PRIYAMVADA.                                             [_Aloud_.    We wish you joy, dear [S']akoontala. Your affections are fixed on an  object in every respect worthy of you,. The noblest river will unite itself  to the ocean, and the lovely Madhavi-creeper clings naturally to the  Mango, the only tree capable of supporting it.    KING.    Why need we wonder if the beautiful constellation Vi[s']akha pines  to be united with the Moon[53]?    ANASUYA.    By what stratagem can we best secure to our friend the  accomplishment of her heart's desire both speedily and secretly?    PRIYAMVADA.    The latter point is all we have to think about. As to 'speedily,'  I look upon the whole affair as already settled.    ANASUYA.    How so?    PRIYAMVADA.    Did you not observe how the King betrayed his liking by the  tender manner in which he gazed upon her, and how thin he has  become the last few days, as if he had been lying awake thinking  of her?    KING.                                      [_Looking at himself_.    Quite true! I certainly am becoming thin from want of sleep:      As night by night in anxious thought I raise    This wasted arm to rest my sleepless head,    My jewelled bracelet, sullied by the tears    That trickle from my eyes in scalding streams,    Slips towards my elbow from my shrivelled wrist.    Oft I replace the bauble, but in vain;    So easily it spans the fleshless limb    That e'en the rough and corrugated skin,    Scarred by the bow-string, will not check its fall[54].    PRIYAMVADA.    An idea strikes me, Anasuya. Let [S']akoontala write a love-letter;  I will conceal it in a flower, and contrive to drop it in the  King's path. He will surely mistake it for the remains of some  sacred offering, and will, in all probability, pick it up.    ANASUYA.    A very ingenious device! It my entire approval; but what says  [S']akoontala?    [S']AKOONTALA.    I must consider before I can consent to it.    PRIYAMVADA.    Could, you not, dear [S']akoontala, think of some pretty  composition in verse, containing a delicate declaration of your  love?    [S']AKOONTALA.    Well, I will do my best; but my heart trembles when I think of  the chances of a refusal.    KING.                                            [_With rapture_.      Too timid maid, here stands the man from whom    Thou fearest a repulse; supremely blessed    To call thee all his own. Well might he doubt    His title to thy love; but how could'st thou    Believe thy beauty powerless to subdue him?    PRIYAMVADA AND ANASUYA.    You undervalue your own merits, dear [S']akoontala. What man in his  senses would intercept with the skirt of his robe the bright rays  of the autumnal moon, which alone can allay the fever of his  body?    [S']AKOONTALA.                                           [_Smiling_.    Then it seems I must do as I am bid.                             [_Sits down and appears to be thinking_.    KING.    How charming she looks! My very eyes forget to wink, jealous of  losing even for an instant a sight so enchanting.      How beautiful the movement of her brow,    As through her mind love's tender fancies flow!    And, as she weighs her thoughts, how sweet to trace    The ardent passion mantling in her face!    [S']AKOONTALA.    Dear girls, I have thought of a verse, but I have no  writing-materials at hand.    PRIYAMVADA.    Write the letters with your nail on this lotus-leaf, which is  smooth as a parrot's breast.    [S']AKOONTALA.                          [_After writing the verse_.    Listen, dear friends, and tell me whether the ideas are  appropriately expressed.    PRIYAMVADA AND ANASUYA.    We are all attention.    [S']AKOONTALA.                                             [_Reads_.      I know not the secret thy bosom conceals,    Thy form is not near me to gladden my sight;    But sad is the tale that my fever reveals,    Of the love that consumes me by day and by night.    KING.                           [_Advancing hastily towards her_.      Nay, Love does but warm thee, fair maiden,--thy frame    Only droops like the bud in the glare of the noon;    But me he consumes with a pitiless flame,    As the beams of the day-star destroy the pale moon.    PRIYAMVADA AND ANASUYA.                 [_Looking at him joyfully and rising to salute him_.    Welcome, the desire of our hearts, that so speedily presents  itself!                              [[S']AKOONTALA _makes an effort to rise_.    KING.    Nay, trouble not thyself, dear maiden.      Move not to do me homage; let thy limbs    Still softly rest upon their flowery couch;    And gather fragrance from the lotus-stalks,    Bruised by the fevered contact of thy frame.    ANASUYA.    Deign, gentle Sir, to seat yourself on the rock on which our  friend is reposing.                  [_The_ KING _sits down_. [S']AKOONTALA _is confused_.    PRIYAMVADA.    Any one may see at a glance that you are deeply attached to each  other. But the affection I have for my friend prompts me to say  something of which you hardly require to be informed.    KING.    Do not hesitate to speak out, my good girl. If you omit to say  what is in your mind, you may be sorry for it afterwards.    PRIYAMVADA.    Is it not your special office as a King to remove the suffering  of your subjects who are in trouble?    KING.    Such is my duty, most assuredly.    PRIYAMVADA.    Know, then, that our dear friend has been brought to her present  state of suffering entirely through love for you. Her life is in  your hands; take pity on her and restore her to health.    KING.    Excellent maiden, our attachment is mutual. It is I who am the  most honoured by it.    [S']AKOONTALA.                            [_Looking at PRIYAMVADA_.    What do you mean by detaining the King, who must be anxious to  return to his royal consorts after so long a separation?    KING.      Sweet maiden, banish from thy mind the thought    That I could love another. Thou dost reign    Supreme, without a rival, in my heart,    And I am thine alone; disown me not,    Else must I die a second deadlier death,    Killed by thy words, as erst by Kama's[47] shafts.    ANASUYA.    Kind Sir, we have heard it said that kings have many favourite  consorts. You must not, then, by your behaviour towards our dear  friend, give her relations cause to sorrow for her.    KING.    Listen, gentle maiden, while in a few words I quiet your anxiety.      Though many beauteous forms my palace grace,    Henceforth two things alone will I esteem    The glory of my royal dynasty--    My sea-girt realm, and this most lovely maid.    PRIYAMVADA AND ANASUYA.    We are satisfied by your assurances.    PRIYAMVADA.                              [_Glancing on one side_.    See, Anasuya, there is our favourite little fawn running about in  great distress, and turning its eyes in every direction as if  looking for its mother; come, let us help the little thing to  find her. [_Both move away_.    [S']AKOONTALA.    Dear friends, dear friends, leave me not alone and unprotected.  Why need you both go?    PRIYAMVADA AND ANASUYA.    Unprotected! when the Protector of the world is at your side.                                                           [_Exeunt_.    [S']AKOONTALA.    What! have they both really left me?    KING.    Distress not thyself, sweet maiden. Thy adorer is at hand to wait  upon thee.      Oh let me tend thee, fair one, in the place    Of thy dear friends; and with broad lotus fans    Raise cooling breezes to refresh thy frame;    Or shall I rather, with caressing touch,    Allay the fever of thy limbs, and soothe    Thy aching feet, beauteous as blushing lilies?    [S']AKOONTALA.    Nay, touch me not. I will not incur the censure of those whom I  am bound to respect.                                         [_Rises and attempts to go_.    KING.    Fair one, the heat of noon has not yet subsided, and thy body is  still feeble.      How canst thou quit thy fragrant couch of flowers,    And from thy throbbing bosom cast aside    Its covering of lotus-leaves, to brave    With weak and fainting limbs the noon-day heat?                                          [_Forces her to turn back_.    [S']AKOONTALA.    Infringe not the rules of decorum, mighty descendant of Puru.  Remember, though I love you, I have no power to dispose of  myself.    KING.    Why this fear of offending your relations, timid maid? When your  venerable foster-father hears of it, he will not find fault with  you. He knows that the law permits us to be united without  consulting him.      In Indra's heaven, so at least 'tis said,    No nuptial rites prevail[55], nor is the bride    Led to the altar by her future lord;    But all in secret does the bridegroom plight    His troth, and each unto the other vow    Mutual allegiance. Such espousals, too,    Are authorised on earth, and many daughters    Of royal saints thus wedded to their lords    Have still received their father's benison.    [S']AKOONTALA.    Leave me, leave me; I must take counsel with my female friends.    KING.    I will leave thee when--    [S']AKOONTALA.    When?    KING.      When I have gently stolen from thy lips    Their yet untasted nectar, to allay    The raging of my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12187"],[0,"The Mystery of 31 New Inn (#12)"],[1,"to open our business.    \"My friend here, Dr. Jervis, who has very kindly been looking after my  work for a week or two, has had a most remarkable experience, and he  wants to tell you about it.\"    \"Something in my line of business?\" the officer inquired.    \"That,\" said I, \"is for you to judge. I think it is, but you may think  otherwise\"; and hereupon, without further preamble, I plunged into the  history of the case, giving him a condensed statement similar to that  which I had already made to Stillbury.    He listened with close attention, jotting down from time to time a brief  note on a sheet of paper; and, when I had finished, he wrote out in a  black-covered notebook a short precis of my statement.    \"I have written down here,\" he said, \"the substance of what you have  told me. I will read the deposition over to you, and, if it is correct,  I will ask you to sign it.\"    He did so, and, when I had signed the document, I asked him what was  likely to be done in the matter.    \"I am afraid,\" he replied, \"that we can't take any active measures. You  have put us on our guard and we shall keep our eyes open. But I think  that is all we can do, unless we hear something further.\"    \"But,\" I exclaimed, \"don't you think that it is a very suspicious  affair?\"    \"I do,\" he replied. \"A very fishy business indeed, and you were quite  right to come and tell us about it.\"    \"It seems a pity not to take some measures,\" I said. \"While you are  waiting to hear something further, they may give the poor wretch a fresh  dose and kill him.\"    \"In which case we should hear something further, unless some fool of a  doctor were to give a death certificate.\"    \"But that is very unsatisfactory. The man ought not to be allowed to  die.\"    \"I quite agree with you, sir. But we've no evidence that he is going to  die. His friends sent for you, and you treated him skilfully and left  him in a fair way to recovery. That's all that we really know about it.  Yes, I know,\" the officer continued as I made signs of disagreement,  \"you think that a crime is possibly going to be committed and that we  ought to prevent it. But you overrate our powers. We can only act on  evidence that a crime has actually been committed or is actually being  attempted. Now we have no such evidence. Look at your statement, and  tell me what you can swear to.\"    \"I think I could swear that Mr. Graves had taken a poisonous dose of  morphine.\"    \"And who gave him that poisonous dose?\"    \"I very strongly suspect--\"    \"That's no good, sir,\" interrupted the officer. \"Suspicion isn't  evidence. We should want you to swear an information and give us enough  facts to make out a <i>prima facie</i> case against some definite person. And  you couldn't do it. Your information amounts to this: that a certain  person has taken a poisonous dose of morphine and apparently recovered.  That's all. You can't swear that the names given to you are real names,  and you can't give us any address or even any locality.\"    \"I took some compass bearings in the carriage,\" I said. \"You could  locate the house, I think, without much difficulty.\"    The officer smiled faintly and fixed an abstracted gaze on the clock.    \"<i>You</i> could, sir,\" he replied. \"I have no doubt whatever that <i>you</i>  could. <i>I</i> couldn't. But, in any case, we haven't enough to go upon. If  you learn anything fresh, I hope you will let me know; and I am very  much obliged to you for taking so much trouble in the matter. Good  evening sir. Good evening, Dr. Stillbury.\"    He shook hands with us both genially, and, accepting perforce this very  polite but unmistakable dismissal, we took our departure.    Outside the station, Stillbury heaved a comfortable sigh. He was  evidently relieved to find that no upheavals were to take place in his  domain.    \"I thought that would be their attitude,\" he said, \"and they are quite  right, you know. The function of law is to prevent crime, it is true;  but prophylaxis in the sense in which we understand it is not possible  in legal practice.\"    I assented without enthusiasm. It was disappointing to find that no  precautionary measures were to be taken. However, I had done all that I  could in the matter. No further responsibility lay upon me, and, as it  was practically certain that I had seen and heard the last of Mr. Graves  and his mysterious household, I dismissed the case from my mind. At the  next corner Stillbury and I parted to go our respective ways; and my  attention was soon transferred from the romance of crime to the  realities of epidemic influenza.    The plethora of work in Dr. Stillbury's practice continued longer than I  had bargained for. Day after day went by and still found me tramping the  dingy streets of Kennington or scrambling up and down narrow stairways;  turning in at night dead tired, or turning out half awake to the hideous  jangle of the night bell.    It was very provoking. For months I had resisted Thorndyke's persuasion  to give up general practice and join him. Not from lack of inclination,  but from a deep suspicion that he was thinking of my wants rather than  his own; that his was a charitable rather than a business proposal. Now  that I knew this not to be the case, I was impatient to join him; and,  as I trudged through the dreary thoroughfares of this superannuated  suburb, with its once rustic villas and its faded gardens, my thoughts  would turn enviously to the quiet dignity of the Temple and my friend's  chambers in King's Bench Walk.    The closed carriage appeared no more; nor did any whisper either of good  or evil reach me in connection with the mysterious house from which it  had come. Mr. Graves had apparently gone out of my life for ever.    But if he had gone out of my life, he had not gone out of my memory.  Often, as I walked my rounds, would the picture of that dimly-lit room  rise unbidden. Often would I find myself looking once more into that  ghastly face, so worn, so wasted and haggard, and yet so far from  repellent. All the incidents of that last night would reconstitute  themselves with a vividness that showed the intensity of the impression  that they had made at the time. I would have gladly forgotten the whole  affair, for every incident of it was fraught with discomfort. But it  clung to my memory; it haunted me; and ever as it returned it bore with  it the disquieting questions: Was Mr. Graves still alive? And, if he was  not, was there really nothing which could have been done to save him?    Nearly a month passed before the practice began to show signs of  returning to its normal condition. Then the daily lists became more and  more contracted and the day's work proportionately shorter. And thus the  term of my servitude came to an end. One evening, as we were writing up  the day-book, Stillbury remarked:    \"I almost think, Jervis, I could manage by myself now. I know you are  only staying on for my sake.\"    \"I am staying on to finish my engagement, but I shan't be sorry to clear  out if you can do without me.\"    \"I think I can. When would you like to be off?\"    \"As soon as possible. Say to-morrow morning, after I have made a few  visits and transferred the patients to you.\"    \"Very well,\" said Stillbury. \"Then I will give you your cheque and  settle up everything to-night, so that you shall be free to go off when  you like to-morrow morning.\"    Thus ended my connection with Kennington Lane. On the following day at  about noon, I found myself strolling across Waterloo Bridge with the  sensations of a newly liberated convict and a cheque for twenty-five  guineas in my pocket. My luggage was to follow when I sent for it. Now,  unhampered even by a hand-bag, I joyfully descended the steps at the  north end of the bridge and headed for King's Bench Walk by way of the  Embankment and Middle Temple Lane.          Chapter V    Jeffrey Blackmore's Will      My arrival at Thorndyke's chambers was not unexpected, having been  heralded by a premonitory post-card. The \"oak\" was open and an  application of the little brass knocker of the inner door immediately  produced my colleague himself and a very hearty welcome.    \"At last,\" said Thorndyke, \"you have come forth from the house of  bondage. I began to think that you had taken up your abode in Kennington  for good.\"    \"I was beginning, myself, to wonder when I should escape. But here I am;  and I may say at once that I am ready to shake the dust of general  practice off my feet for ever--that is, if you are still willing to have  me as your assistant.\"    \"Willing!\" exclaimed Thorndyke, \"Barkis himself was not more willing  than I. You will be invaluable to me. Let us settle the terms of our  comradeship forthwith, and to-morrow we will take measures to enter you  as a student of the Inner Temple. Shall we have our talk in the open air  and the spring sunshine?\"    I agreed readily to this proposal, for it was a bright, sunny day and  warm for the time of year--the beginning of April. We descended to the  Walk and thence slowly made our way to the quiet court behind the  church, where poor old Oliver Goldsmith lies, as he would surely have  wished to lie, in the midst of all that had been dear to him in his  chequered life. I need not record the matter of our conversation. To  Thorndyke's proposals I had no objections to offer but my own  unworthiness and his excessive liberality. A few minutes saw our  covenants fully agreed upon, and when Thorndyke had noted the points on  a slip of paper, signed and dated it and handed it to me, the business  was at an end.    \"There,\" my colleague said with a smile as he put away his pocket-book,  \"if people would only settle their affairs in that way, a good part of  the occupation of lawyers would be gone. Brevity is the soul of wit; and  the fear of simplicity is the beginning of litigation.\"    \"And now,\" I said, \"I propose that we go and feed. I will invite you to  lunch to celebrate our "]]]
