The second condition enforcing a uniform course of study in certain  subjects is the use of uniform examinations in those subjects. We  would merely suggest here that it is possible to use supervisory  examinations without making them uniform for all schools. Different  types of school may well have different types of examination.    Different social classes often exist within the same school.  Administrative limitations probably must prevent the use of more than  one course of study in a single elementary school. But as the work of  the grammar grades is departmentalized, and as junior high schools  are developed, it will become possible to offer alternative courses  in these grades. Those practically certain of going on to higher  educational work requiring foreign languages and higher mathematics  should probably be permitted to begin these studies by the sixth or  seventh grade. On the other hand, those who are practically certain  to drop out of school at the end of the grammar grades or junior high  school should have full opportunities for applied science, applied  design, practical mathematics, civics, hygiene, vocational studies,  etc. When the necessary studies are once organized and departmental  work introduced, it is not difficult to arrange for the necessary  differentiation of courses in the same school.    Finally, courses of study should provide for children of differing  natural ability. Extra materials and opportunities should be provided  for children of large capacity; and abbreviated courses for those  of less than normal ability. In departmentalized grammar grades  and junior high schools this can be taken care of rather easily by  permitting the brighter pupils to carry more studies than normal,  and the backward ones a smaller number than normal. Under the present  elementary school organization with classes so large and with so many  things for the teachers to do, it is practically impossible to effect  such desirable differentiations.          SUMMARY      1. The fundamental social point of view of this discussion of the  courses of study of the Cleveland schools is that effective teaching  is preparation for adult life through participation in the activities  of life.    2. The schools of Cleveland devote far more time to reading than do  those of the average city. In too large measure this time is employed  in mastering the mechanics of reading and in the analytical study  of the manner in which the words are combined in sentences and the  sentences in paragraphs. The main object of the reading should be  the mastery of the thought rather than the study of the construction.  Through it the children should gain life-long habits of exploring,  through reading, the great fields of history, industry, applied  science, life in other lands, travel, invention, biography, and  wholesome fiction. To this end the work should be made more extensive  and less intensive. As an indispensable means toward this end the  books should be supplied by the schools instead of being purchased by  the parents.    3. The teaching of spelling should aim to give the pupils complete  mastery over those words which they need to use in writing and it  should instil in them the permanent habit of watching their spelling  as they write. Drill on lists of isolated words should give way to  practice in spelling correctly every word in everything written. The  dictionary habit should be cultivated, and every written lesson should  be a spelling lesson.    4. The time devoted to language, composition, and grammar is about the  same as in the average city. The chief result of the work as done in  Cleveland is to enable the pupil to recite well on textbook grammar  and to pass examinations in the subject. The work in technical grammar  should be continued for the purpose of giving the pupils a  foundation acquaintance with forms, terms, relations, and grammatical  perspective, but this training need not be so extensive and intensive  as at present. The time saved should be given to oral and written  expression in connection with the reading of history, geography,  industrial studies, civics, sanitation, and the like. Facility and  accuracy in oral and written expression are developed through practice  rather than through precept. They are perfected through the conscious  and unconscious imitation of good models rather than through the  advanced study of technical grammar. Only as knowledge is put to work  is it really learned or assimilated.    5. Cleveland gives more time to mathematics than does the average  city. The content of courses in mathematics is to be determined by  human needs. A fundamental need of our scientific age is more accurate  quantitative thinking about our vocations, civic problems, taxation,  income, insurance, expenditures, public improvements, and the  multitude of other public and private problems involving quantities.  We need to think accurately and easily in quantities, proportions,  forms, and relationships. Arithmetic teaching, like the teaching  of penmanship, is for the purpose of providing tools to be used in  matters that lie beyond. The present course of study is of superior  character, providing for efficient elementary training and dispensing  with most of the things of little practical use. The greatest  improvement in the work is to be found in its further carrying over  into the other fields of school work and in applying it in other  classes as well as in the arithmetic class. In the advanced classes  mathematics should be differentiated according to the needs of  different pupils. Algebra should be more closely related to practical  matters and developed in connection with geometry and trigonometry.    6. History receives much less attention in this city than in the  average city. The character of the work is really indicated by the  last sentence of the eighth-grade history assignment: \"The text of our  book should be thoroughly mastered.\" The work is too brief, abstract,  and barren to help the pupils toward an understanding of the social,  political, economic, and industrial problems with which we are  confronted. It should be amply supplemented by a wide range of  reading on social welfare topics. This reading should be biographical,  anecdotal, thrilling dramas of human achievement, rich with  human interest. It should be at every stage on the level with the  understanding and degree of maturity of the pupils so that much  reading can be covered rapidly.    7. In Cleveland, where there has been an almost unequalled amount of  civic discussion and progressive human-welfare effort, the teaching  of civics in the public schools receives too little attention. It is  recommended that the principals and teachers make such a civic survey  as that made in Cincinnati as the method of discovering the topics  that should enter into a grammar-grade course. Not much civics  teaching should be attempted in the intermediate grades, but it should  be given in the higher grades.    8. A new course of study in geography is now being put into use. The  work as laid out in the old manual and as seen in the classrooms  has been forbiddingly formal. It has mainly consisted of the teacher  assigning to the pupils a certain number of paragraphs or pages in  the textbook as the next lesson, and then questioning them next day to  ascertain how much of this printed material they have remembered and  how well. The new course of study recognizes, on the contrary, that  the proper end of geographical teaching is rather to stimulate and  guide the children toward an inquiring interest as to how the world  is made, and the skies above, and the waters round about, and the  conditions of nature that limit and determine in a measure the  development of mankind. To attain this ideal will require in every  school 10 times as adequate provision of geographical reading and  geographical material as is now found in the best equipped school.    9. Drawing and applied art have been taught in Cleveland since  1849. The object of the teaching is to develop an understanding and  appreciation of the principles of graphic art and ability to use these  principles in practical applications. Where this work is done best, it  shows, in both the elementary and high schools, balanced understanding  and complete modernness. What is needed is extension of this best  type of work to all parts of the city through specially trained  departmental teachers.    10. Where teaching of household arts is at its best in Cleveland,  it is of a superior character and should be extended along lines  now being followed. Manual training for boys should be extended and  broadened with a view to giving the pupils real contact with more  types of industry than those represented by the present woodwork.    11. Elementary science finds no place in the course of study of  Cleveland. The future citizens of Cleveland will need an understanding  of electricity, heat, expansion and contraction of gases and solids,  the mechanics of machines, distillations, common chemical reactions,  and the multitude of other matters of science met with daily in their  activities. The schools should help supply this need.    12. Teaching in matters pertaining to health is assigned little time  in the elementary schools, and the time that is assigned to it is  frequently given to something else. The subject gets pushed off the  program by one of the so-called \"essentials.\" A course in hygiene  should be drawn up, and practical applications of the work should be  arranged through having pupils look after the sanitary conditions of  rooms and grounds. The school doctors and nurses should help in this  teaching and practice.    13.

Know ye not that  I was before your fathers' fathers, and that I can foresee your fate,  and the end of the gold ye covet? I am the Wise One who ordereth all.\"    Then they went, but Regin afterwards often recalled Odin's words and  the evening filled with the gleam of the gold, but little cared he  then, so well he loved the gold. And he prayed his father to keep the  treasure, but give a little unto him and Fafnir for the help they had  given him that day.    His father in no wise heeded his words, but sat ever on his ivory  throne, staring moodily at the gold. But Fafnir grew fierce and grim  as he watched him.      \"The night waned into the morning, and still above the Hoard    Sat Reidmar clad in purple; but Fafnir took his sword,    And I took my smithying-hammer, and apart in the world we went;    But I came aback in the even, and my heart was heavy and spent;    And I longed, but fear was upon me and I durst not go to the Gold;    So I lay in the house of my toil mid the things I had fashioned of old;    And methought as I lay in my bed 'twixt waking and slumber of night    That I heard the tinkling metal and beheld the hall alight,    But I slept and dreamed of the Gods, and the things that never have slept,    Till I woke to a cry and a clashing and forth from the bed I leapt,    And there by the heaped-up Elf-gold my brother Fafnir stood,    And there at his feet lay Reidmar and reddened the Treasure with blood;    And e'en as I looked on his eyen they glazed and whitened with death,    And forth on the torch-litten hall he shed his latest breath.      \"But I looked on Fafnir and trembled for he wore the Helm of Dread,    And his sword was bare in his hand, and the sword and the hand were red    With the blood of our father Reidmar, and his body was wrapped in gold,    With the ruddy-gleaming mailcoat of whose fellow hath nought been told,    And it seemed as I looked upon him that he grew beneath mine eyes:    And then in the mid-hall's silence did his dreadful voice arise:      \"'I have slain my father Reidmar, that I alone might keep    The Gold of the darksome places, the Candle of the Deep.    I am such as the Gods have made me, lest the Dwarf-kind people the earth,    Or mingle their ancient wisdom with its short-lived latest birth.    I shall dwell alone henceforward, and the Gold and its waxing curse,    I shall brood on them both together, let my life grow better or worse.    And I am a King henceforward and long shall be my life,    And the Gold shall grow with my longing, for I shall hide it from strife,'    And hoard up the Ring of Andvari in the house thine hand hath built.    O thou, wilt thou tarry and tarry, till I cast thy blood on the guilt?    Lo, I am a King for ever, and alone on the Gold shall I dwell    And do no deed to repent of and leave no tale to tell.'      \"More awful grew his visage as he spake the word of dread,    And no more durst I behold him, but with heart a-cold I fled;    I fled from the glorious house my hands had made so fair,    As poor as the new-born baby with nought of raiment or gear:    I fled from the heaps of gold, and my goods were the eager will,    And the heart that remembereth all, and the hand that may never be still.      \"Then unto this land I came, and that was long ago.    As men-folk count the years; and I taught them to reap and to sow,           *       *       *       *       *      \"And I grew the master of masters--Think thou how strange it is    That the sword in the hands of a stripling shall one day end all this!      \"Yet oft mid all my wisdom did I long for my brother's part,    And Fafnir's mighty kingship weighed heavy on my heart    When the Kings of the earthly kingdoms would give me golden gifts    From out of their scanty treasures, due pay for my cunning shifts.    And once--didst thou number the years thou wouldst think it long ago--    I wandered away to the country from whence our stem did grow.           *       *       *       *       *      \"Then I went to the pillared hall-stead, and lo, huge heaps of gold,    And to and fro amidst them a mighty Serpent rolled:    Then my heart grew chill with terror, for I thought on the wont of our race,    And I, who had lost their cunning, was a man in a deadly place,    A feeble man and a swordless in the lone destroyer's fold;    For I knew that the Worm was Fafnir, the Wallower on the Gold.      \"So I gathered my strength and fled, and hid my shame again    Mid the foolish sons of men-folk; and the more my hope was vain,    The more I longed for the Treasure, and deliv'rance from the yoke:    And yet passed the generations, and I dwelt with the short-lived folk.      \"Long years, and long years after, the tale of men-folk told    How up on the Glittering Heath was the house and the dwelling of gold,    And within that house was the Serpent, and the Lord of the Fearful Face:    Then I wondered sore of the desert; for I thought of the golden place    My hands of old had builded; for I knew by many a sign    That the Fearful Face was my brother, that the blood of the Worm was mine.    This was ages long ago, and yet in that desert he dwells,    Betwixt him and men death lieth, and no man of his semblance tells;    But the tale of the great Gold-wallower is never the more outworn.    Then came thy kin, O Sigurd, and thy father's father was born,    And I fell to the dreaming of dreams, and I saw thine eyes therein,    And I looked and beheld thy glory and all that thy sword should win;    And I thought that thou shouldst be he, who should bring my heart its rest,    That of all the gifts of the Kings thy sword should give me the best.      \"Ah, I fell to the dreaming of dreams; and oft the gold I saw,    And the golden-fashioned Hauberk, clean-wrought without a flaw,    And the Helm that aweth the world; and I knew of Fafnir's heart    That his wisdom was greater than mine, because he had held him apart,    Nor spilt on the sons of men-folk our knowledge of ancient days,    Nor bartered one whit for their love, nor craved for the people's praise.      \"And some day I shall have it all, his gold and his craft and his heart    And the gathered and garnered wisdom he guards in the mountains apart.\"           *       *       *       *       *      And he spake: \"Hast thou hearkened, Sigurd, wilt thou help a man that is old    To avenge him for his father? Wilt thou win that Treasure of Gold    And be more than the Kings of the earth? Wilt thou rid the earth of a wrong    And heal the woe and the sorrow my heart hath endured o'erlong?\"      Then Sigurd looked upon him with steadfast eyes and clear,    And Regin drooped and trembled as he stood the doom to hear:    But the bright child spake as aforetime, and answered the Master and said:    \"Thou shalt have thy will, and the Treasure, and take the curse on thine         head.\"      _Of the forging of the Sword that is called The Wrath of Sigurd._           *       *       *       *       *      But when the morrow was come he went to his mother and spake:    \"The shards, the shards of the sword, that thou gleanedst for my sake    In the night on the field of slaughter, in the tide when my father fell,    Hast thou kept them through sorrow and joyance? hast thou warded them trusty         and well?    Where hast thou laid them, my mother?\"                                      Then she looked upon him and said:    \"Art thou wroth, O Sigurd my son, that such eyes are in thine head?    And wilt thou be wroth with thy mother? do I withstand thee at all?\"      \"Nay,\" said he, \"nought am I wrathful, but the days rise up like a wall    Betwixt my soul and the deeds, and I strive to rend them through.           *       *       *       *       *      \"Now give me the sword, my mother, that Sigmund gave thee to keep.\"      She said: \"I shall give it thee gladly, for fain shall I be of thy praise    When thou knowest my careful keeping of that hope of the earlier days.\"      So she took his hand in her hand, and they went their ways, they twain;    Till they came to the treasure of queen-folk, the guarded chamber of gain:    They were all alone with its riches, and she turned the key in the gold,    And lifted the sea-born purple, and the silken web unrolled,    And lo, 'twixt her hands and her bosom the shards of Sigmund's sword;    No rust-fleck stained its edges, and the gems of the ocean's hoard    Were as bright in the hilts and glorious, as when in the Volsungs' hall    It shone in the eyes of the earl-folk and flashed from the shielded wall.      But Sigurd smiled upon it, and he said: \"O Mother of Kings,    Well hast thou warded the war-glaive for a mirror of many things,    And a hope of much fulfilment: well hast thou given to me    The message of my fathers, and the word of thing to be:    Trusty hath been thy warding, but its hour is over now:    These shards shall be knit together, and shall hear the war-wind blow.\"           *       *       *       *       *      Then she felt his hands about her as he took the fateful sword,    And he kissed her soft and sweetly; but she answered never a word:           *       *       *       *       *      But swift on his ways went Sigurd, and to Regin's house he came,    Where the Master stood in the doorway and behind him leapt the flame,    And dark he looked and little: no more his speech was sweet,    No words on his lip were gathered the Volsung child to greet,    Till he took the sword from Sigurd and the shards of the days of old;    Then he spake:                 \"Will nothing serve thee save this blue steel and cold,    The bane of thy father's father, the fate of all his kin,    The baleful blade I fashioned, the Wrath that the Gods would win?\"      Then answered the eye-bright Sigurd: \"If thou thy craft wilt do,    Nought save these battle-gleanings shall be my helper true:\"    So"]]]
