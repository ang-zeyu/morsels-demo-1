It was in the hot weather that a tired  traveller passed that way, and, for the sake of the shade, he laid his  bow and arrows down, and dropped asleep under the tree. Before long the  shadow of the tree shifted, and left his face exposed to the glare;  which the Heron perceiving, like the kindly bird he was, perched on the  Peepul-tree, and spread his wings out so as to cast a shadow on the  traveller's face. There the poor fellow, weary with his travel,  continued to sleep soundly, and snored away comfortably with open mouth.  The sight of his enjoyment was too much for the malevolent Crow, who,  perching over him, dropped an unwelcome morsel into the sleeper's mouth,  and straightway flew off. The traveller, starting from his slumber,  looked about, and, seeing no bird but the Heron, he fitted an arrow and  shot him dead. No!' concluded the Parrot, 'I like the society of honest  folk.'    'But why these words, my brother?' I said; 'his Majesty's herald is to  me even as his Majesty.'    'Very fine!' replied the Parrot; 'but--        'Kindly courtesies that issue from a smiling villain's mouth      Serve to startle, like a flower blossoming in time of drouth.'    Needs must that thou art a bad man; for by thy talk war will have  arisen, which a little conciliation had averted:--        'Conciliation!--weapon of the wise!      Wheedled therewith, by woman's quick device,      The Wheelwright let his ears betray his eyes.'    'How came that about?' asked the King. The Parrot related:--      THE STORY OF THE APPEASED WHEELWRIGHT    \"There was a Wheelwright in Shri-nuggur, whose name was 'Heavy-head,' He  had good reason to suspect the infidelity of his wife, but he had no  absolute proof of it. One day he gave out that he should go to a  neighboring town, and he started accordingly; but he went a very little  way, and then returning, hid himself in his wife's chamber. She being  quite satisfied that he was really gone away, invited her gallant to  pass the evening with her, and began to spend it with him in  unrestrained freedom. Presently, by chance, she detected the presence of  her husband, and her manner instantly changed.    'Life of my soul! what ails you?' said her lover; 'you are quite dull  to-night.'    'I am dull,' she replied, 'because the lord of my life is gone. Without  my husband the town is a wilderness. Who knows what may befall him, and  whether he will have a nice supper?'    'Trouble thyself no more about the quarrelsome dullard,' said her  gallant.    'Dullard, quotha!' exclaimed the wife. 'What matter what he is, since he  is my all? Knowest thou not--        'Of the wife the lord is jewel, though no gems upon her beam;      Lacking him, she lacks adornment, howsoe'er her jewels gleam?'    Thou, and the like of thee, may serve a whim, as we chew a betel-leaf  and trifle with a flower; but my husband is my master, and can do with  me as he will. My life is wrapped up in him--and when he dies, alas! I  will certainly die too. Is it not plainly said--        'Hairs three-crore, and half-a-crore hairs, on a man so many grow--      And so many years to Swerga shall the true wife surely go?'    And better still is promised; as herein--        'When the faithful wife,[17] embracing tenderly her husband dead,      Mounts the blazing pile beside him, as it were the bridal-bed;      Though his sins were twenty thousand, twenty thousand times o'er-told,      She shall bring his soul to splendor, for her love so large and bold.'    All this the Wheelwright heard. 'What a lucky fellow I am,' he thought,  'to have a wife so virtuous,' and rushing from his place of concealment,  he exclaimed in ecstasy to his wife's gallant, 'Sir I saw you ever truer  wife than mine?'    'When the story was concluded,' said Long-bill, 'the King, with a  gracious gift of food, sent me off before the Parrot; but he is coming  after me, and it is now for your Majesty to determine as it shall please  you.'    'My Liege,' observed the Brahmany-goose with a sneer, 'the Crane has  done the King's business in foreign parts to the best of his power,  which is that of a fool.'    \"Let the past pass,\" replied the King, \"and take thought for the  present.\"    \"Be it in secret, then, your Majesty,\" said the Brahmany-goose--        'Counsel unto six ears spoken, unto all is notified:--      When a King holds consultation, let it be with one beside,'    Thereupon all withdrew, but the Rajah and the Minister.    'What think you?' said Silver-sides.    'That the Crane has been employed to bring this about,' replied the  other.    'What shall we do?' asked the King.    'Despatch two spies--the first to inform and send back the other, and  make us know the enemy's strength or weakness. They must be such as can  travel by land and water, so the Crane will serve for one, and we will  keep his family in pledge at the King's gate. The other must be a very  reserved character; as it is said--        'Sick men are for skilful leeches--prodigals for prisoning--      Fools for teachers--and the man who keeps a secret, for a King,'    'I know such a one,' said his Majesty, after a pause.    'It is half the victory,' responded the Minister.    At this juncture a chamberlain entered with a profound obeisance, and  announced the arrival from Jambudwipa of the Parrot.    'Let him be shown to a reception-room,' commanded the Goose, in reply to  a look from the King. 'He shall presently have audience.'    'War is pronounced, then,' said the King, as the attendant withdrew.    'It is offered, my Liege; but must not be rashly accepted,' replied the  other--        'With gift, craft, promise, cause thy foe to yield;      When these have failed thee, challenge him a-field.'    To gain time for expedients is the first point. Expedients are good for  great and little matters equally, like        'The subtle wash of waves, that smoothly pass,      But lay the tree as lowly as the grass.'    Let his Excellency the Parrot, then, be cajoled and detained here, while  we place our fort in condition to be useful. Is it not said--        'Ten true bowmen on a rampart fifty's onset may sustain;      Fortalices keep a country more than armies in the plain?'    And your Majesty,' continued the Goose, 'will recall the points of a  good fortress--        'Build it strong, and build it spacious, with an entry and retreat;      Store it well with wood and water, fill its garners full with wheat.'    'Whom, then, shall we entrust with this work?' asked King Silver-sides.    'The Paddy-bird[18] is a good bird, and a skilful,' replied his  Minister.    'Let him be summoned!' said the King. And upon the entrance of the  Paddy-bird, the superintendence of the fortress was committed to him,  and accepted with a low prostration.    'As to the fort, Sire!' remarked the Paddy-bird, 'it exists already in  yonder large pool; the thing is to store the island in the middle of it  with provisions--        'Gems will no man's life sustain;      Best of gold is golden grain.'    'Good!' said King Silver-sides; 'let it be looked to.' Thereupon, as the  Paddy-bird was retiring, the Usher entered again, and making  prostration, said: 'May it please your Majesty, the King of all the  Crows, Night-cloud by name, has just arrived from Singhala-dwipa, and  desires to lay his homage at your Majesty's feet.'    'He is a wise bird, and a far-travelled,' said the King; 'I think we  must give him audience.'    Nevertheless, Sire,' interrupted the Goose, 'we must not forget that he  is a land-bird, and therefore not to be received as a water-fowl. Your  royal memory doubtless retains the story of        'The Jackal's fate, who being colored blue,      Leaving his party, left his own life too.'    'No! How was that?' asked King Silver-sides. The Goose related--      THE STORY OF THE DYED JACKAL    \"A Jackal once on a time, as he was prowling about the suburbs of a  town, slipped into an indigo-tank; and not being able to get out he laid  himself down so as to be taken for dead. The dyer presently coming and  finding what seemed a dead Jackal, carried him into the jungle and then  flung him away. Left to himself, the Jackal found his natural color  changed to a splendid blue. 'Really,' he reflected, 'I am now of a most  magnificent tint; why should I not make it conduce to my elevation?'  With this view, he assembled the other Jackals, and thus harangued  them:--    'Good people, the Goddess of the Wood, with her own divine hand, and  with every magical herb of the forest, has anointed me King. Behold the  complexion of royalty!--and henceforward transact nothing without my  imperial permission.\"    \"The Jackals, overcome by so distinguished a color, could do nothing but  prostrate themselves and promise obedience. His reign, thus begun,  extended in time to the lions and tigers; and with these high-born  attendants he allowed himself to despise the Jackals, keeping his own  kindred at a distance, as though ashamed of them. The Jackals were  indignant, but an old beast of their number thus consoled them:--    \"Leave the impudent fellow to me. I will contrive his ruin. These tigers  and the rest think him a King, because he is colored blue; we must show  them his true colors. Do this, now!--in the evening-time come close  about him, and set up a great yell together--he is sure to join in, as  he used to do--        'Hard it is to conquer nature: if a dog were made a King,      Mid the coronation trumpets, he would gnaw his sandal-string.'    And when he yells the Tigers will know him for a Jackal and fall upon  him.'    'The thing befell exactly so, and the Jackal,' concluded the Minister,  'met the fate of one who leaves his proper party.'    'Still,' said the King, 'the Crow has come a long way, and we might see  him, I think.'    'Admit the Parrot first, Sire,' said the Goose; 'the fort has been put  in order and the spy despatched.'    \"Thereupon a Court was called, and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13272"],[0,"Beethoven's Letters 1790-1826, Volume 2 (#12)"],[1,"1).]      305.    TO F. RIES,--LONDON.    Vienna, April 6, 1822.    MY DEAREST AND BEST RIES,--    Having been again in bad health during the last ten months, I have hitherto  been unable to answer your letter. I duly received the 26l. sterling, and  thank you sincerely; I have not, however, yet got the sonata you dedicated  to me. My greatest work is a _Grand Mass_ that I have recently written. As  time presses, I can only say what is most urgent. What would the  Philharmonic give me for a symphony?    I still cherish the hope of going to London next spring, if my health  admits of it! You will find in me one who can thoroughly appreciate my dear  pupil, now become a great master, and who can tell what benefit art might  derive from our conjunction! I am, as ever, wholly devoted to my Muse, who  constitutes the sole happiness of my life, and I toil and act for others as  I best can. You have two children; I only one (my brother's son); but you  are married, so both yours will not cost you so much as my one costs me.    Now farewell! kiss your handsome wife for me until I can perform this  solemn act in person.    Your attached    BEETHOVEN.    Pray send me your dedication, that I may strive to return the compliment,  which I mean to do as soon as I receive your work.      306.    TO HERREN PETERS & CO., MUSIC PUBLISHERS,--LEIPZIG.    Vienna, June 5, 1822.    GENTLEMEN,--    You did me the honor to address a letter to me at a time when I was much  occupied, and I have also been extremely unwell for the last five months. I  now only reply to the principal points. Although I met Steiner by chance a  few days ago, and asked him jestingly what he had brought me from Leipzig,  he did not make _the smallest_ allusion to _your commission or to  yourself_. He urged me, however, in the very strongest manner, to _pledge  myself to give him the exclusive right of publishing all my works, both  present and future_,--and indeed to _sign a contract to that  effect_,--which I declined. This _trait_ sufficiently proves to you why I  often give the preference to other publishers both home and foreign. I love  uprightness and integrity, and am of opinion that no one should drive a  hard bargain with artists, for, alas! however brilliant the exterior of  Fame may appear, an artist does not enjoy the privilege of being the daily  guest of Jupiter on Olympus; unhappily commonplace humanity only too often  unpleasantly drags him down from these pure ethereal heights.    The _greatest_ work I have hitherto written is a _Grand Mass_ with  Choruses, and four _obbligati_ voice parts, and full orchestra. Several  persons have applied to me for this work, and I have been offered 100 Louis  d'or, hard cash, for it; but I demand at least 1000 florins C.M. [20  florins to the mark], for which sum I will also furnish a pianoforte  arrangement. Variations on a waltz [Diabelli's] for the piano (they are  numerous), 30 ducats in gold,--N.B. Vienna ducats. With regard to songs, I  have several rather important descriptive ones: as, for example, a comic  Aria, with full orchestra, on Goethe's text, \"Mit Maedeln sich vertragen;\"  and another Aria, in the same style, 16 ducats each (furnishing also a  pianoforte arrangement if required); also several descriptive songs, with  pianoforte accompaniment, 12 ducats each; among these is a little Italian  Cantata, with Recitative; there is also a Song with recitative among the  German ones. A Song with pianoforte accompaniment, 8 ducats. An Elegy, four  voices, with the accompaniment of _two violins, viola, and violoncello_, 24  ducats. A Dervise Chorus, with full orchestra, 20 ducats.    Also the following instrumental music: a Grand March for full orchestra,  with pianoforte accompaniment, 12 ducats, written for the tragedy of  \"Tarpeia.\" Romance for the violin (a solo with full orchestra), 15 ducats.  Grand Terzet for two oboes, and one English horn (which might be arranged  for other instruments), 30 ducats. Four military Marches with Turkish  music; when applied for, I will name the sum. _Bagatelles_, or minor  pianoforte solos, the price to be fixed when required. The above works are  all completed. Solo pianoforte Sonata, 40 ducats (which could soon be  delivered); Quartet for _two violins, tenor, and violoncello_, 50 ducats  (this will also soon be ready). I am by no means so anxious about these,  however, as about _a full and complete edition of my works_, being desirous  to edit them during my lifetime. I have indeed received many proposals on  this subject, but accompanied by stipulations to which I could scarcely  agree, and which I neither could nor would fulfil. I am willing to  undertake, in the course of two years, or possibly a year, or a year and a  half, with proper assistance, to edit and superintend a complete edition of  my works, and to furnish a new composition in each style; namely, a new  work in the style of variations, one in the sonata style, and so on in  every separate class of work that I have ever composed, and for the whole  combined I ask 10,000 florins C.M.    I am no man of business, and only wish I were; as it is, I am guided by the  offers made to me by different competitors for my works, and such a  competition is rather strong just now. I request you to say nothing on the  subject, because, as you may perceive from the proceedings of these  gentlemen, I am exposed to a great deal of annoyance. When once my works  appear published by you, I shall no longer be plagued. I shall be very glad  if a connection be established between us, having heard you so well spoken  of. You will then also find that I infinitely prefer dealing with _one_  person of your description than with a variety of people of the ordinary  stamp.    Pray, let me have an immediate answer, as I am now on the verge of deciding  on the publication of various works. If you consider it worth while, be so  good as to send me a duplicate of the list with which you furnished Herr  Steiner. In the expectation of a speedy reply, I remain, with esteem,    Your obedient    LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.      307.    TO HERREN PETERS & CO.    Vienna, July 26, 1822.    I write merely to say that I agree to give you the Mass and pianoforte  arrangement of it for 1000 florins C.M. You shall receive the above,  written out in score, by the end of July, perhaps a few days sooner or  later. As I am always very much occupied, and have been indisposed for the  last five months, and works to be sent to a distance requiring the most  careful supervision, I must proceed rather more slowly than usual. At all  events, Steiner shall get nothing further from me, as he has just played me  a most Jewish trick; so he is not one of those who might have had the Mass.  The competition for my works is at present very great, for which I thank  the Almighty, as I have hitherto been such a loser. I am the foster-father  of my brother's destitute child, a boy who shows so much aptitude for  scientific pursuits that not only does his study of these, and his  maintenance, cost a great deal of money, but I must also strive to make  some future provision for him; being neither Indians nor Iroquois, who, as  we know, leave everything to Providence, whereas we consider a pauper's  existence to be a very sad one.    I assure you on my honor, which, next to God, is what I prize most, that I  authorized no one to accept commissions for me. My fixed principle has  always been never to make any offer to publishers; not from pride, but  simply from a wish to ascertain how far the empire of my small talents  extended.    I must conclude for to-day, and wishing you every success, I am, with  esteem,    Your obedient    BEETHOVEN.      308.[1]    TO HERR PETERS.    Vienna, August 3, 1822.    I already wrote to you that my health was still far from being quite  restored. I am obliged to have recourse to baths and mineral waters as well  as to medicine; all this makes me rather unpunctual, especially as I must  go on writing; corrections, too, run away with a great deal of time.    As to the songs and marches and other trifles, my choice is still  undecided, but by the 15th of this month everything shall be ready to be  sent off. I await your orders on the subject, and in the mean time shall  make no use of your bill of exchange. As soon as I know that the money for  the Mass and the other works has arrived here, all shall be ready for  delivery by the 15th; and after that date I must set off to some mineral  waters near this, when it will be most desirable for me to avoid all  business for a time. More as to other matters when less occupied. Pray, do  not suspect me of any ignoble motives. It pains me when I am obliged to  bargain.    In haste. With esteem, yours,    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: Schindler states that the advance of 360 florins C.M. was  made to Beethoven in August, 1822. The receipt is dated Nov. 30, 1825.]      309.    TO HERR ARTARIA.    August 22, 1822.    Being overwhelmed with work, I can only briefly say that I will always do  what I can to repay your obliging kindness to me. With regard to the Mass,  I have been offered 1000 florins (C.M.) for it. My circumstances do not  permit me to accept a less sum from you; all that I can do is to give you  the preference. Rest assured that I do not ask you one farthing more than  others have offered me, which I can prove to you by written documents. You  can consider about this, but I must request you to send me an answer on the  subject to-morrow, it being a post-day, and my decision expected elsewhere.  With regard to the 150 florins for which I am your debtor, I intend to make  you a proposal, as I stand in great need of the 1000 florins.    I beg you will observe strict secrecy as to the Mass. Now, as ever,    Your grateful friend,    BEETHOVEN.      310.    TO HERR PETERS,--LEIPZIG    Vienna, November 22, 1822.    I now reply to your letter of the 9th November, in which I expected to find"]]]
