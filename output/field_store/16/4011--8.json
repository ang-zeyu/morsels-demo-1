[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7853"],[0,"Quentin Durward (#11)"],[1,"Maitre Pierre, who probably had sufficiency of whims,  and was rich enough to ensure their being attended to.    The thought, the lingering thought, again returned on him, that he  ought to make the old gentleman understand the difference betwixt their  conditions, and call on him to mark, that, how rich soever he might be,  his wealth put him on no level with a Durward of Glen Houlakin. Yet,  whenever he looked on Maitre Pierre's countenance with such a purpose,  there was, notwithstanding the downcast look, pinched features, and  mean and miserly dress, something which prevented the young man from  asserting the superiority over the merchant which he conceived himself  to possess. On the contrary, the oftener and more fixedly Quentin looked  at him, the stronger became his curiosity to know who or what this man  actually was; and he set him down internally for at least a Syndic or  high magistrate of Tours, or one who was, in some way or other, in the  full habit of exacting and receiving deference. Meantime, the merchant  seemed again sunk into a reverie, from which he raised himself only to  make the sign of the cross devoutly, and to eat some of the dried fruit,  with a morsel of biscuit. He then signed to Quentin to give him the cup,  adding, however, by way of question, as he presented it, \"You are noble,  you say?\"    \"I surely am,\" replied the Scot, \"if fifteen descents can make me so--so  I told you before. But do not constrain yourself on that account, Maitre  Pierre--I have always been taught it is the duty of the young to assist  the more aged.\"    \"An excellent maxim,\" said the merchant, availing himself of the youth's  assistance in handing the cup, and filling it from a ewer which seemed  of the same materials with the goblet, without any of those scruples in  point of propriety which, perhaps, Quentin had expected to excite.    \"The devil take the ease and familiarity of this old mechanical  burgher!\" said Durward once more to himself. \"He uses the attendance of  a noble Scottish gentleman with as little ceremony as I would that of a  gillie from Glen Isla.\"    The merchant, in the meanwhile, having finished his cup of water, said  to his companion, \"From the zeal with which you seem to relish the  Vin de Beaulne, I fancy you would not care much to pledge me in this  elemental liquor. But I have an elixir about me which can convert even  the rock water into the richest wines of France.\"    As he spoke, he took a large purse from his bosom, made of the fur of  the sea otter, and streamed a shower of small silver pieces into the  goblet, until the cup, which was but a small one, was more than half  full.    \"You have reason to be more thankful, young man,\" said Maitre Pierre,  \"both to your patron Saint Quentin and to Saint Julian, than you seemed  to be but now. I would advise you to bestow alms in their name. Remain  in this hostelry until you see your kinsman, Le Balafre, who will be  relieved from guard in the afternoon. I will cause him to be acquainted  that he may find you here, for I have business in the Castle.\"    Quentin Durward would have said something to have excused himself from  accepting the profuse liberality of his new friend; but Maitre Pierre,  bending his dark brows, and erecting his stooping figure into an  attitude of more dignity than he had yet seen him assume, said in a tone  of authority, \"No reply, young man, but do what you are commanded.\"    With these words he left the apartment, making a sign, as he departed,  that Quentin must not follow him.    The young Scotsman stood astounded, and knew not what to think of  the matter. His first most natural, though perhaps not most dignified  impulse, drove him to peer into the silver goblet, which assuredly was  more than half full of silver pieces to the number of several scores, of  which perhaps Quentin had never called twenty his own at one time during  the course of his whole life. But could he reconcile it to his dignity  as a gentleman, to accept the money of this wealthy plebeian?--This was  a trying question; for, though he had secured a good breakfast, it was  no great reserve upon which to travel either back to Dijon, in case he  chose to hazard the wrath and enter the service of the Duke of Burgundy,  or to Saint Quentin, if he fixed on that of the Constable Saint Paul;  for to one of those powers, if not to the king of France, he was  determined to offer his services. He perhaps took the wisest resolution  in the circumstances, in resolving to be guided by the advice of his  uncle; and, in the meantime, he put the money into his velvet hawking  pouch, and called for the landlord of the house, in order to restore the  silver cup--resolving, at the same time, to ask him some questions about  this liberal and authoritative merchant.    The man of the house appeared presently; and, if not more communicative,  was at least more loquacious, than he had been formerly. He positively  declined to take back the silver cup. It was none of his, he said, but  Maitre Pierre's, who had bestowed it on his guest. He had, indeed, four  silver hanaps of his own, which had been left him by his grandmother,  of happy memory, but no more like the beautiful carving of that in his  guest's hand, than a peach was like a turnip--that was one of the famous  cups of Tours, wrought by Martin Dominique, an artist who might brag all  Paris.    \"And, pray, who is this Maitre Pierre,\" said Durward, interrupting him,  \"who confers such valuable gifts on strangers?\"    \"Who is Maitre Pierre?\" said the host, dropping the words as slowly from  his mouth as if he had been distilling them.    \"Ay,\" said Durward, hastily and peremptorily, \"who is this Maitre  Pierre, and why does he throw about his bounties in this fashion?  And who is the butcherly looking fellow whom he sent forward to order  breakfast?\"    \"Why, fair sir, as to who Maitre Pierre is, you should have asked the  question of himself; and for the gentleman who ordered breakfast to be  made ready, may God keep us from his closer acquaintance!\"    \"There is something mysterious in all this,\" said the young Scot. \"This  Maitre Pierre tells me he is a merchant.\"    \"And if he told you so,\" said the innkeeper, \"surely he is a merchant.\"    \"What commodities does he deal in?\"    \"Oh, many a fair matter of traffic,\" said the host; \"and especially he  has set up silk manufactories here which match those rich bales that  the Venetians bring from India and Cathay. You might see the rows  of mulberry trees as you came hither, all planted by Maitre Pierre's  command, to feed the silk worms.\"    \"And that young person who brought in the confections, who is she, my  good friend?\" said the guest.    \"My lodger, sir, with her guardian, some sort of aunt or kinswoman, as I  think,\" replied the innkeeper.    \"And do you usually employ your guests in waiting on each other?\" said  Durward; \"for I observed that Maitre Pierre would take nothing from your  hand, or that of your attendant.\"    \"Rich men may have their fancies, for they can pay for them,\" said the  landlord; \"this is not the first time Maitre Pierre has found the true  way to make gentlefolks serve at his beck.\"    The young Scotsman felt somewhat offended at the insinuation; but,  disguising his resentment, he asked whether he could be accommodated  with an apartment at this place for a day, and perhaps longer.    \"Certainly,\" the innkeeper replied; \"for whatever time he was pleased to  command it.\"    \"Could he be permitted,\" he asked, \"to pay his respects to the ladies,  whose fellow lodger he was about to become?\"    The innkeeper was uncertain. \"They went not abroad,\" he said, \"and  received no one at home.\"    \"With the exception, I presume, of Maitre Pierre?\" said Durward.    \"I am not at liberty to name any exceptions,\" answered the man, firmly  but respectfully.    Quentin, who carried the notions of his own importance pretty high,  considering how destitute he was of means to support them, being  somewhat mortified by the innkeeper's reply, did not hesitate to avail  himself of a practice common enough in that age. \"Carry to the ladies,\"  he said, \"a flask of vernat, with my humble duty; and say that Quentin  Durward, of the house of Glen Houlakin, a Scottish cavalier of honour,  and now their fellow lodger, desires the permission to dedicate his  homage to them in a personal interview.\"    The messenger departed, and returned, almost instantly, with the thanks  of the ladies, who declined the proffered refreshment, and, with their  acknowledgments to the Scottish cavalier, regretted that, residing there  in privacy, they could not receive his visit.    Quentin bit his lip, took a cup of the rejected vernat, which the host  had placed on the table. \"By the mass, but this is a strange country,\"  said he to himself, \"where merchants and mechanics exercise the manners  and munificence of nobles, and little travelling damsels, who hold their  court in a cabaret [a public house], keep their state like disguised  princesses! I will see that black browed maiden again, or it will go  hard, however;\" and having formed this prudent resolution, he demanded  to be conducted to the apartment which he was to call his own.    The landlord presently ushered him up a turret staircase, and from  thence along a gallery, with many doors opening from it, like those of  cells in a convent; a resemblance which our young hero, who recollected,  with much ennui, an early specimen of a monastic life, was far from  admiring. The host paused at the very end of the gallery, selected a key  from the large bunch which he carried at his girdle, opened the door,  and showed his guest the interior of a turret chamber; small, indeed,  but which, being clean and solitary, and having the pallet bed and  the few articles of furniture, in unusually good order, seemed, on the  whole, a little palace.    \"I hope you will find your dwelling agreeable here, fair sir,\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7864"],[0,"The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose (#11)"],[1,"have been expatiated upon. This is the twelfth Parva  the favourite of the wise. It consists of three hundred and thirty-nine  sections, and contains fourteen thousand, seven hundred and thirty-two  slokas.    \"Next in order is the excellent Anusasana Parva. In it is described how  Yudhishthira, the king of the Kurus, was reconciled to himself on hearing  the exposition of duties by Bhishma, the son of Bhagirathi. This Parva  treats of rules in detail and of Dharma and Artha; then the rules of  charity and its merits; then the qualifications of donees, and the supreme  ride-regarding gifts. This Parva also describes the ceremonials of  individual duty, the rules of conduct and the matchless merit of truth.  This Parva showeth the great merit of Brahmanas and kine, and unraveleth  the mysteries of duties in relation to time and place. These are embodied  in the excellent Parva called Anusasana of varied incidents. In this hath  been described the ascension of Bhishma to Heaven. This is the thirteenth  Parva which hath laid down accurately the various duties of men. The  number of sections, in this is one hundred and forty-six. The number of  slokas is eight thousand.    \"Then comes the fourteenth Parva Aswamedhika. In this is the excellent  story of Samvarta and Marutta. Then is described the discovery (by the  Pandavas) of golden treasuries; and then the birth of Parikshit who was  revived by Krishna after having been burnt by the (celestial) weapon of  Aswatthaman. The battles of Arjuna the son of Pandu, while following the  sacrificial horse let loose, with various princes who in wrath seized it.  Then is shown the great risk of Arjuna in his encounter with Vabhruvahana  the son of Chitrangada (by Arjuna) the appointed daughter of the chief of  Manipura. Then the story of the mongoose during the performance of the  horse-sacrifice. This is the most wonderful Parva called Aswamedhika. The  number of sections is one hundred and three. The number of slokas composed  (in this) by Vyasa of true knowledge is three thousand, three hundred and  twenty.    \"Then comes the fifteenth Parva called Asramvasika. In this, Dhritarashtra,  abdicating the kingdom, and accompanied by Gandhari and Vidura went to the  woods. Seeing this, the virtuous Pritha also, ever engaged in cherishing  her superiors, leaving the court of her sons, followed the old couple. In  this is described the wonderful meeting through the kindness of Vyasa of  the king (Dhritarashtra) with the spirits of his slain children, grand-  children, and other princes, returned from the other world. Then the  monarch abandoning his sorrows acquired with his wife the highest fruit of  his meritorious actions. In this Parva, Vidura after having leaned on  virtue all his life attaineth to the most meritorious state.    \"The learned son of Gavalgana, Sanjaya, also of passions under full  control, and the foremost of ministers, attained, in the Parva, to the  blessed state. In this, Yudhishthira the just met Narada and heard from  him about the extinction of the race of Vrishnis. This is the very  wonderful Parva called Asramvasika. The number of sections in this is  forty-two, and the number of slokas composed by Vyasa cognisant of truth  is one thousand five hundred and six.    \"After this, you know, comes the Maushala of painful incidents. In this,  those lion-hearted heroes (of the race of Vrishni) with the scars of many  a field on their bodies, oppressed with the curse of a Brahmana, while  deprived of reason from drink, impelled by the fates, slew each other on  the shores of the Salt Sea with the Eraka grass which (in their hands)  became (invested with the fatal attributes of the) thunder. In this, both  Balarama and Kesava (Krishna) after causing the extermination of their  race, their hour having come, themselves did not rise superior to the sway  of all-destroying Time. In this, Arjuna the foremost among men, going to  Dwaravati (Dwaraka) and seeing the city destitute of the Vrishnis was much  affected and became exceedingly sorry. Then after the funeral of his  maternal uncle Vasudeva the foremost among the Yadus (Vrishnis), he saw  the heroes of the Yadu race lying stretched in death on the spot where  they had been drinking. He then caused the cremation of the bodies of the  illustrious Krishna and Balarama and of the principal members of the  Vrishni race. Then as he was journeying from Dwaraka with the women and  children, the old and the decrepit--the remnants of the Yadu race--he was  met on the way by a heavy calamity. He witnessed also the disgrace of his  bow Gandiva and the unpropitiousness of his celestial weapons. Seeing all  this, Arjuna became despondent and, pursuant to Vyasa's advice, went to  Yudhishthira and solicited permission to adopt the Sannyasa mode of life.  This is the sixteenth Parva called Maushala. The number of sections is  eight and the number of slokas composed by Vyasa cognisant of truth is  three hundred and twenty.    \"The next is Mahaprasthanika, the seventeenth Parva.    \"In this, those foremost among men the Pandavas abdicating their kingdom  went with Draupadi on their great journey called Mahaprasthana. In this,  they came across Agni, having arrived on the shore of the sea of red  waters. In this, asked by Agni himself, Arjuna worshipped him duly,  returned to him the excellent celestial bow called Gandiva. In this,  leaving his brothers who dropped one after another and Draupadi also,  Yudhishthira went on his journey without once looking back on them. This  the seventeenth Parva is called Mahaprasthanika. The number of sections in  this is three. The number of slokas also composed by Vyasa cognisant of  truth is three hundred and twenty.    \"The Parva that comes after this, you must know, is the extraordinary one  called Svarga of celestial incidents. Then seeing the celestial car come  to take him, Yudhishthira moved by kindness towards the dog that  accompanied him, refused to ascend it without his companion. Observing the  illustrious Yudhishthira's steady adherence to virtue, Dharma (the god of  justice) abandoning his canine form showed himself to the king. Then  Yudhishthira ascending to heaven felt much pain. The celestial messenger  showed him hell by an act of deception. Then Yudhishthira, the soul of  justice, heard the heart-rending lamentations of his brothers abiding in  that region under the discipline of Yama. Then Dharma and Indra showed  Yudhishthira the region appointed for sinners. Then Yudhishthira, after  leaving the human body by a plunge in the celestial Ganges, attained to  that region which his acts merited, and began to live in joy respected by  Indra and all other gods. This is the eighteenth Parva as narrated by the  illustrious Vyasa. The number of slokas composed, O ascetics, by the great  Rishi in this is two hundred and nine.    \"The above are the contents of the Eighteen Parvas. In the appendix  (Khita) are the Harivansa and the Vavishya. The number of slokas contained  in the Harivansa is twelve thousand.    \"These are the contents of the section called Parva-sangraha.\" Sauti  continued, \"Eighteen Akshauhinis of troops came together for battle. The  encounter that ensued was terrible and lasted for eighteen days. He who  knows the four Vedas with all the Angas and Upanishads, but does not know  this history (Bharata), cannot be regarded as wise. Vyasa of immeasurable  intelligence, has spoken of the Mahabharata as a treatise on Artha, on  Dharma, and on Kama. Those who have listened to his history can never bear  to listen to others, as, indeed, they who have listened to the sweet voice  of the male Kokila can never hear the dissonance of the crow's cawing. As  the formation of the three worlds proceedeth from the five elements, so do  the inspirations of all poets proceed from this excellent composition. O  ye Brahman, as the four kinds of creatures (viviparous, oviparous, born of  hot moisture and vegetables) are dependent on space for their existence,  so the Puranas depend upon this history. As all the senses depend for  their exercise upon the various modifications of the mind, so do all acts  (ceremonials) and moral qualities depend upon this treatise. There is not  a story current in the world but doth depend on this history, even as body  upon the food it taketh. All poets cherish the Bharata even as servants  desirous of preferment always attend upon masters of good lineage. Even as  the blessed domestic Asrama can never be surpassed by the three other  Asramas (modes of life) so no poets can surpass this poem.    \"Ye ascetics, shake off all inaction. Let your hearts be fixed on virtue,  for virtue is the one only friend of him that has gone to the other world.  Even the most intelligent by cherishing wealth and wives can never make  these their own, nor are these possessions lasting. The Bharata uttered by  the lips of Dwaipayana is without a parallel; it is virtue itself and  sacred. It destroyeth sin and produceth good. He that listeneth to it  while it is being recited hath no need of a bath in the sacred waters of  Pushkara. A Brahmana, whatever sins he may commit during the day through  his senses, is freed from them all by reading the Bharata in the evening.  Whatever sins he may commit also in the night by deeds, words, or mind, he  is freed from them all by reading Bharata in the first twilight (morning).  He that giveth a hundred kine with horns mounted with gold to a Brahmana  well-posted up in the Vedas and all branches of learning, and he that  daily listeneth to the sacred narrations of the Bharata, acquireth equal  merit. As the wide ocean is easily passable by men having ships, so is  this extensive history of great excellence and deep import with the help  of this chapter called Parva sangraha.\"    Thus endeth the section called Parva-sangraha of the Adi Parva of the  blessed Mahabharata.
