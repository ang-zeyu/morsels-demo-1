He went down the few stairs  leading to a ground-floor landing, on which the front door opened.    There were two men there, of whom one said:    \"You can't pass.\"    \"But--\"    \"You can't pass: those are our orders.\"    \"Your orders? Who gave them?\"    \"The Prefect himself.\"    \"No luck,\" said Perenna, laughing. \"I have been up all night and I am  starving. Is there no way of getting something to eat?\"    The two policemen exchanged glances and one of them beckoned to Silvestre  and spoke to him. Silvestre went toward the dining-room, and returned  with a horseshoe roll.    \"Good,\" thought Don Luis, after thanking him. \"This settles it. I'm  nabbed. That's what I wanted to know. But M. Desmalions is deficient in  logic. For, if it's Arsene Lupin whom he means to detain here, all these  worthy plain-clothesmen are hardly enough; and, if it's Don Luis Perenna,  they are superfluous, because the flight of Master Perenna would deprive  Master Perenna of every chance of seeing the colour of my poor Cosmo's  shekels. Having said which, I will take a chair.\"    He resumed his seat in the passage and awaited events.    Through the open door of the study he saw the magistrates pursuing  their investigations. The divisional surgeon made a first examination  of the two bodies and at once recognized the same symptoms of poisoning  which he himself had perceived, the evening before, on the corpse of  Inspector Verot.    Next, the detectives took up the bodies and carried them to the adjoining  bedrooms which the father and son formerly occupied on the second floor  of the house.    The Prefect of Police then came downstairs; and Don Luis heard him say to  the magistrates:    \"Poor woman! She refused to understand.... When at last she understood,  she fell to the ground in a dead faint. Only think, her husband and her  son at one blow!... Poor thing!\"    From that moment Perenna heard and saw nothing. The door was shut. The  Prefect must afterward have given some order through the outside, through  the communication with the front door offered by the garden, for the two  detectives came and took up their positions in the hall, at the entrance  to the passage, on the right and left of the dividing curtain.    \"One thing's certain,\" thought Don Luis. \"My shares are not booming. What  a state Alexandre must be in! Oh, what a state!\"    At twelve o'clock Silvestre brought him some food on a tray.    And the long and painful wait began anew.    In the study and in the house, the inquiry, which had been adjourned for  lunch, was resumed. Perenna heard footsteps and the sound of voices on  every side. At last, feeling tired and bored, he leaned back in his chair  and fell asleep.           *       *       *       *       *    It was four o'clock when Sergeant Mazeroux came and woke him. As he led  him to the study, Mazeroux whispered:    \"Well, have you discovered him?\"    \"Whom?\"    \"The murderer.\"    \"Of course!\" said Perenna. \"It's as easy as shelling peas!\"    \"That's a good thing!\" said Mazeroux, greatly relieved and failing to see  the joke. \"But for that, as you saw for yourself, you would have been  done for.\"    Don Luis entered. In the room were the public prosecutor, the examining  magistrate, the chief detective, the local commissary of police, two  inspectors, and three constables in uniform.    Outside, on the Boulevard Suchet, shouts were raised; and, when the  commissary and his three policemen went out, by the Prefect's orders, to  listen to the crowd, the hoarse voice of a newsboy was heard shouting:    \"The double murder on the Boulevard Suchet! Full particulars of the death  of Inspector Verot! The police at a loss!--\"    Then, when the door was closed, all was silent.    \"Mazeroux was quite right,\" thought Don Luis. \"It's I or the other one:  that's clear. Unless the words that will be spoken and the facts that  will come to light in the course of this examination supply me with some  clue that will enable me to give them the name of that mysterious X,  they'll surrender me this evening for the people to batten on. Attention,  Lupin, old chap, the great game is about to commence!\"    He felt that thrill of delight which always ran through him at the  approach of the great struggles. This one, indeed, might be numbered  among the most terrible that he had yet sustained.    He knew the Prefect's reputation, his experience, his tenacity, and the  keen pleasure which he took in conducting important inquiries and in  personally pushing them to a conclusion before placing them in the  magistrate's hands; and he also knew all the professional qualities of  the chief detective, and all the subtlety, all the penetrating logic  possessed by the examining magistrate.    The Prefect of Police himself directed the attack. He did so in a  straightforward fashion, without beating about the bush, and in a rather  harsh voice, which had lost its former tone of sympathy for Don Luis. His  attitude also was more formal and lacked that geniality which had struck  Don Luis on the previous day.    \"Monsieur,\" he said, \"circumstances having brought about that, as the  residuary legatee and representative of Mr. Cosmo Mornington, you spent  the night on this ground floor while a double murder was being committed  here, we wish to receive your detailed evidence as to the different  incidents that occurred last night.\"    \"In other words, Monsieur le Prefet,\" said Perenna, replying directly to  the attack, \"in other words, circumstances having brought about that you  authorized me to spend the night here, you would like to know if my  evidence corresponds at all points with that of Sergeant Mazeroux?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Meaning that the part played by myself strikes you as suspicious?\"    M. Desmalions hesitated. His eyes met Don Luis's eyes; and he was visibly  impressed by the other's frank glance. Nevertheless he replied, plainly  and bluntly:    \"It is not for you to ask me questions, Monsieur.\"    Don Luis bowed.    \"I am at your orders, Monsieur le Prefet.\"    \"Please tell us what you know.\"    Don Luis thereupon gave a minute account of events, after which M.  Desmalions reflected for a few moments and said:    \"There is one point on which we want to be informed. When you entered  this room at half-past two this morning and sat down beside M. Fauville,  was there nothing to tell you that he was dead?\"    \"Nothing, Monsieur le Prefet. Otherwise, Sergeant Mazeroux and I would  have given the alarm.\"    \"Was the garden door shut?\"    \"It must have been, as we had to unlock it at seven o'clock.\"    \"With what?\"    \"With the key on the bunch.\"    \"But how could the murderers, coming from the outside, have opened it?\"    \"With false keys.\"    \"Have you a proof which allows you to suppose that it was opened with  false keys?\"    \"No, Monsieur le Prefet.\"    \"Therefore, until we have proofs to the contrary, we are bound to believe  that it was not opened from the outside, and that the criminal was inside  the house.\"    \"But, Monsieur le Prefet, there was no one here but Sergeant Mazeroux  and myself!\"    There was a silence, a pause whose meaning admitted of no doubt.  M. Desmalions's next words gave it an even more precise value.    \"You did not sleep during the night?\"    \"Yes, toward the end.\"    \"You did not sleep before, while you were in the passage?\"    \"No.\"    \"And Sergeant Mazeroux?\"    Don Luis remained undecided for a moment; but how could he hope that the  honest and scrupulous Mazeroux had disobeyed the dictates of his  conscience?    He replied:    \"Sergeant Mazeroux went to sleep in his chair and did not wake until Mme.  Fauville returned, two hours later.\"    There was a fresh silence, which evidently meant:    \"So, during the two hours when Sergeant Mazeroux was asleep, it was  physically possible for you to open the door and kill the two Fauvilles.\"    The examination was taking the course which Perenna had foreseen; and  the circle was drawing closer and closer around him. His adversary was  conducting the contest with a logic and vigour which he admired  without reserve.    \"By Jove!\" he thought. \"How difficult it is to defend one's self when one  is innocent. There's my right wing and my left wing driven in. Will my  centre be able to stand the assault?\"    M. Desmalions, after a whispered colloquy with the examining magistrate,  resumed his questions in these terms:    \"Yesterday evening, when M. Fauville opened his safe in your presence and  the sergeant's, what was in the safe?\"    \"A heap of papers, on one of the shelves; and, among those papers, the  diary in drab cloth which has since disappeared.\"    \"You did not touch those papers?\"    \"Neither the papers nor the safe, Monsieur le Prefet. Sergeant Mazeroux  must have told you that he made me stand aside, to insure the regularity  of the inquiry.\"    \"So you never came into the slightest contact with the safe?\"    \"Not the slightest.\"    M. Desmalions looked at the examining magistrate and nodded his head. Had  Perenna been able to doubt that a trap was being laid for him, a glance  at Mazeroux would have told him all about it. Mazeroux was ashen gray.    Meanwhile, M. Desmalions continued:    \"You have taken part in inquiries, Monsieur, in police inquiries.  Therefore, in putting my next question to you, I consider that I am  addressing it to a tried detective.\"    \"I will answer your question, Monsieur le Prefet, to the best of  my ability.\"    \"Here it is, then: Supposing that there were at this moment in the safe  an object of some kind, a jewel, let us say, a diamond out of a tie pin,  and that this diamond had come from a tie pin which belonged to somebody  whom we knew, somebody who had spent the night in this house, what would  you think of the coincidence?\"    \"There we are,\" said Perenna to himself. \"There's the trap. It's clear  that they've found something in the safe, and next,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13065"],[0,"Beethoven's Letters 1790-1826, Volume 1 (#12)"],[1,"you to dwell chiefly on the great importance to me  of adequate opportunities to exercise my art; by so doing you will write  what is most in accordance with my head and my heart. The preamble must set  forth what I am to have in Westphalia--600 ducats in gold, 150 ducats for  travelling expenses; all I have to do in return for this sum being to  direct the King's [Jerome's] concerts, which are short and few in number. I  am not even bound to direct any opera I may write. So, thus freed from all  care, I shall be able to devote myself entirely to the most important  object of my art--to write great works. An orchestra is also to be placed  at my disposition.    N.B. As member of a theatrical association, the title need not be insisted  on, as it can produce nothing but annoyance. With regard to the _Imperial  service_, I think that point requires delicate handling, and not less so  the solicitation for the title of _Imperial Kapellmeister_. It must,  however, be made quite clear that I am to receive a sufficient salary from  the Court to enable me to renounce the annuity which I at present receive  from the gentlemen in question [the Archduke Rudolph, Prince Kinsky, and  Prince Lobkowitz], which I think will be most suitably expressed by my  stating that it is my hope, and has ever been my most ardent wish, to enter  the Imperial service, when I shall be ready to give up as much of the above  salary as the sum I am to receive from His Imperial Majesty amounts to.  (N.B. We must have it to-morrow at twelve o'clock, as we go to Kinsky then.  I hope to see you to-day.)    [Footnote 1: This note, now first published, refers to the call Beethoven  had received, mentioned in the previous No. The sketch of the memorial that  follows is not, however, in Beethoven's writing, and perhaps not even  composed by him [see also No. 46]. It is well known that the Archduke  Rudolph, Prince Kinsky, and Prince Lobkowitz had secured to the _maestro_ a  salary of 4000 gulden.]      49.    The aim and endeavor of every true artist must be to acquire a position in  which he can occupy himself exclusively with the accomplishment of great  works, undisturbed by other avocations or by considerations of economy. A  composer, therefore, can have no more ardent wish than to devote himself  wholly to the creation of works of importance, to be produced before the  public. He must also keep in view the prospect of old age, in order to make  a sufficient provision for that period.    The King of Westphalia has offered Beethoven a salary of 600 gold ducats  for life, and 150 ducats for travelling expenses, in return for which his  sole obligations are, occasionally to play before His Majesty, and to  conduct his chamber concerts, which are both few and short. This proposal  is of a most beneficial nature both to art and the artist.    Beethoven, however, much prefers a residence in this capital, feeling so  much gratitude for the many proofs of kindness he has received in it, and  so much patriotism for his adopted father-land, that he will never cease to  consider himself an Austrian artist, nor take up his abode elsewhere, if  anything approaching to the same advantages are conferred on him here.    As many persons of high, indeed of the very highest rank, have requested  him to name the conditions on which he would be disposed to remain here, in  compliance with their wish he states as follows:--    1. Beethoven must receive from some influential nobleman security for a  permanent salary for life: various persons of consideration might  contribute to make up the amount of this salary, which, at the present  increased price of all commodities, must not consist of less than 4000  florins _per annum_. Beethoven's wish is that the donors of this sum should  be considered as cooperating in the production of his future great works,  by thus enabling him to devote himself entirely to these labors, and by  relieving him from all other occupations.    2. Beethoven must always retain the privilege of travelling in the  interests of art, for in this way alone can he make himself known, and  acquire some fortune.    3. His most ardent desire and eager wish is to be received into the  Imperial service, when such an appointment would enable him partly or  wholly to renounce the proposed salary. In the mean time the title of  _Imperial Kapellmeister_ would be very gratifying to him; and if this wish  could be realized, the value of his abode here would be much enhanced in  his eyes.    If his desire be fulfilled, and a salary granted by His Majesty to  Beethoven, he will renounce so much of the said 4000 florins as the  Imperial salary shall amount to; or if this appointment be 4000 florins, he  will give up the whole of the former sum.    4. As Beethoven wishes from time to time to produce before the public at  large his new great works, he desires an assurance from the present  directors of the theatre on their part, and that of their successors, that  they will authorize him to give a concert for his own benefit every year on  Palm Sunday, in the Theatre \"an der Wien.\" In return for which Beethoven  agrees to arrange and direct an annual concert for the benefit of the poor,  or, if this cannot be managed, at all events to furnish a new work of his  own for such a concert.      50.    TO ZMESKALL.    December, 1808.    MY EXCELLENT FRIEND,--    All would go well now if we had only a curtain, without it the _Aria_ [\"Ah!  Perfido\"] _will be a failure_.[1] I only heard this to-day from S.  [Seyfried], and it vexes me much: a curtain of any kind will do, even a  bed-curtain, or merely a _kind of gauze screen_, which could be instantly  removed. There must be something; for the Aria is in the _dramatic style_,  and better adapted for the stage than for effect in a concert-room.  _Without a curtain, or something of the sort, the Aria will be devoid of  all meaning, and ruined! ruined! ruined!! Devil take it all!_ The Court  will probably be present. Baron Schweitzer [Chamberlain of the Archduke  Anton] requested me earnestly to make the application myself. Archduke Carl  granted me an audience and promised to come. The Empress _neither promised  nor refused_.    A hanging curtain!!!! or the Aria and I will both be hanged to-morrow.  Farewell! I embrace you as cordially on this new year as in the old one.  _With or without a curtain!_ Your    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: Reichardt, in his _Vertraute Briefe_ relates among other  things about the concert given by Beethoven in the Royal Theatre \"an der  Wien,\" Oct. 22, 1808, as follows:--\"Poor Beethoven, who derived from this  concert the first and only net profits which accrued to him during the  whole year, met with great opposition and very slender support in arranging  and carrying it out. First came the _Pastoral Symphony; or, Reminiscences  of Rural Life_; then followed, as the sixth piece, a long Italian _scena_,  sung by Demoiselle Killitzky, a lovely Bohemian with a lovely voice.\" The  above note [to Zmeskall?] certainly refers to this concert.]      51.    TO FERDINAND RIES.[1]    1809.    MY DEAR FELLOW,--    Your friends have at any rate given you very bad advice; but I know all  about them: they are the very same to whom you sent that fine news about me  from Paris; the very same who inquired about my age--information that you  contrived to supply so correctly!--the very same who have often before  injured you in my opinion, but now permanently. Farewell!    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: Ries himself gives the date of this note as 1809, though he  cannot recall what gave rise to it. It is probably connected with a fact  mentioned by Wegeler, p. 95, that Reichardt, who was at that time in  Vienna, had advised Beethoven's young pupil, Ries, to apply to the King of  Westphalia for the appointment of Kapellmeister, which he had recently  given up. This was reported to Beethoven, and roused his ire. Ries, too,  had written from Paris that the taste in music there was very indifferent;  that Beethoven's works were little known or played in that city. Beethoven  was also very susceptible with regard to his age. At the request of some of  Beethoven's friends, Ries, in 1806, obtained Beethoven's baptismal  certificate, and sent it to Vienna. But the _maestro's_ wrath on this  occasion passed away as quickly as usual.]      52.    TO ZMESKALL.[1]    March 7, 1809.    It is just what I expected! As to the blows, that is rather far-fetched.  The story is at least three months' old, and very different from what he  now makes it out to be. The whole stupid affair was caused by a female  huckster and a couple of low fellows. I lose very little. He no doubt was  corrupted in the very house where I am now living.    [Footnote 1: [See No. 10.] The notes to Zmeskall generally have the dates  written by himself. This one bears the date March 7, 1809. In all points  connected with domestic life, and especially in household matters and  discords, Zmeskall was always a kind and consolatory friend. Beethoven at  that time lived in the same house with Countess Erdoedy. [See No. 74.]]      53.    TO ZMESKALL.    My most excellent, high, and well-born Herr v. Zmeskall, Court Secretary  and Member of the Society of the Single Blessed,--If I come to see you  to-day, ascribe it to the fact that a person wishes to speak to me at your  house whom I could not refuse to see. I come without any _card_ from you,  but I hope you will not on that account _discard_ me.    Yours truly--most truly,    L. V. BEETHOVEN.      54.    TO ZMESKALL.    It seems to me, dear Zmeskall, if war really does break out, when it comes  to an end you will be the very man for an appointment in the Peace  Legation. What a glorious office!!! I leave it entirely to you to do the  best you can about my servant, only henceforth Countess Erdoedy must not  attempt to exercise the smallest influence over him. She says she made him  a present of twenty-five florins,"]]]
