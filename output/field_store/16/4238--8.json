We had  captured Hit a few weeks previously, and the aeroplanes flying low over  the town had reported the disagreeable smell, attributing it to dirt and  filth. \"Eyewitness,\" the official newspaper correspondent, mentioned this  in despatches, and when I was passing through, a proclamation of apology  was being prepared to soothe the outraged and slandered townsfolk.    [Illustration: A water-wheel on the Euphrates]    After taking the army commander back to rail-head, we retraced our steps  with all speed to Hit, and thence the eight miles up-stream to Salahiyeh.  The road beyond Hit was in fearful shape, and the engineers were working  night and day to keep it open and in some way passable. In the proposed  attack we were to jump off from Salahiyeh, and it was here that the  armored cars were assembled. Our camp was close to a Turkish hospital.  There were two great crescents and stars laid out for a signal to warn our  aeroplanes not to drop bombs. One of the crescents was made of turf and  the other of limestone. The batteries took turns in making the  reconnaissances, in the course of which they would come in for a good deal  of shelling. The road was unpleasant, because the camels and transport  animals that had been killed during the Turkish retreat from Hit were by  now very high. For some unknown reason there were no jackals or vultures  to form a sanitary section. After reconnoitring the enemy positions and  noting the progress they were making in constructing their defenses, we  would make a long circuit back to camp.    One unoccupied morning I went over to an island on the river. Its cool,  restful look had attracted me on the day I arrived, and it quite fulfilled  its promise. Indeed, it was the only place I came across in Mesopotamia  that might have been a surviving fragment of the Garden of Eden. It was  nearly a mile long, and scattered about on it were seven or eight  thick-walled and well-fortified houses. The entire island was one great  palm-grove, with pomegranates, apricots, figs, orange-trees, and  grape-vines growing beneath the palms. The grass at the foot of the trees  was dotted with blue and pink flowers. Here and there were fields of  spring wheat. The water-ditches which irrigated the island were filled by  giant water-wheels, thirty to fifty feet in diameter. These \"naurs\" have  been well described in the Bible, and I doubt if they have since been  modified in a single item. There are sometimes as many as sixteen in a  row. As they scoop the water up in the gourd-shaped earthenware jars bound  to their rims, they shriek and groan on their giant wooden axles.    On the night of March 25 we got word that the long-expected attack would  take place next morning. We had the cars ready to move out by three. Since  midnight shadowy files had been passing on their way forward to get into  position. One of our batteries went with the infantry to advance against  the main fortified position at Khan Baghdadi. The rest of us went with the  cavalry around the flank to cut the Turks off if they tried to retreat  up-stream. We were well on our way at daybreak. The country was so broken  up with ravines and dry river-beds that we knew we had a long, hard march  ahead of us. Our maps were poor. A German officer that we captured had in  some manner got hold of our latest map, and noting that we had omitted  entirely a very large ravine, became convinced that any enveloping  movement we attempted would prove a failure. As it happened, we came close  to making the blunder he had anticipated, for we started to advance down  to the river along the bank of a nullah which would have taken us to Khan  Baghdadi instead of eight or ten miles above it, as we wished. I think it  was our aeroplanes that set us straight. I was in charge of the tenders  with supplies and spares, and spent most of the time in the leading  Napier lorry. Occasionally I slipped into an armored car to go off  somewhere on a separate mission. The Turks had doubtless anticipated a  flanking movement and kept shelling us to a certain extent, but we could  hear that they were occupying themselves chiefly with the straight  attacking force. By afternoon we had turned in toward the river and our  cavalry was soon engaged. The country was too broken for the cars to get  in any really effective work. By nightfall we hoped we were approximately  where we should be, and after making our dispositions as well as the  circumstances would permit, we lay down beside the cars and were soon  sound asleep. At midnight we were awakened by the bullets chipping the  rocks and stones among which we were sleeping. A night attack was  evidently under way, and it is always an eerie sensation. We correctly  surmised that the Turks were in retreat from Khan Baghdadi and had run  into our outposts. In a few minutes we were replying in volume, and the  rat-tat-tats of the machine-guns on either side were continuous. The enemy  must have greatly overestimated our numbers, for in a short time small  groups started surrendering, and before things had quieted we had twelve  hundred prisoners. The cavalry formed a rough prison-camp and we turned in  again to wait for daylight.    At dawn we started to reconnoitre our position to find out just how  matters stood. We came upon a body of two thousand of the enemy which had  been held up by us in the night and had retreated a short distance to wait  till it became light before surrendering. Among them were a number of  German officers. They were all of them well equipped with machine-guns and  rifles. Their intrenching tools and medical supplies were of Austrian  manufacture, as were also the rolling kitchens. These last were of an  exceedingly practical design. While we were taking stock of our capture we  got word that Khan Baghdadi had been occupied and a good number of  prisoners taken. We were instructed to press on and take Haditha, thirty  miles above Khan Baghdadi. It was hoped that we might recapture Colonel  Tennant, who was in command of the Royal Flying Corps forces in  Mesopotamia. He had been shot down at Khan Baghdadi the day before the  attack. We learned from prisoners that he had been sent up-stream  immediately, on his way to Aleppo, but it was thought that he might have  been held over at Haditha or at Ana.    We found that a lot of the enemy had got by between us and the river and  had then swung back into the road. We met with little opposition, save  from occasional bands of stragglers who concealed themselves behind rocks  and sniped at us. Numbers surrendered without resistance as we caught up  with them. We disarmed them and ordered them to walk back until they fell  in with our cavalry, or the infantry, which was being brought forward in  trucks. As we bowled along in pursuit the scene reminded me of  descriptions in the novels of Sienkiewicz or Erckmann-Chatrian. The road  was littered with equipment of every sort, disabled pack-animals, and dead  or dying Turks. It was hard to see the wounded withering in the increasing  heat--the dead were better off. We reached the heights overlooking Haditha  to find that the garrison was in full retreat. Most of it had left the  night before. Those remaining opened fire upon us, but in a half-hearted  way, that was not calculated to inflict much loss. Many of the inhabitants  of the town lived in burrows in the hillsides. Some of these caves had  been filled with ammunition. The enemy had fired all their dumps, and  rocks were flying about. We endeavored to save as much of the material as  was possible. We were particularly anxious to get all papers dealing with  the Arabs, to enable us to check up which were our friends and which of  the ones behind our lines were dealing treacherously with us. We  recaptured a lot of medical equipment and some ammunition that had been  taken from our forces during the Gallipoli campaign.    Haditha is thirty-five miles from Khan Baghdadi, and Ana is an equal  distance beyond. It was decided that we should push on to a big bridge  shown on the map as eight miles this side of Ana. We were to endeavor to  secure this before the Turks could destroy it, and cross over to bivouac  on the far side. The road was in fair shape. Many of the small bridges  were of recent construction. We soon found that our map was exceedingly  inaccurate. Our aeroplanes were doing a lot of damage to the fleeing  Turks, and as we began to catch up with larger groups we had some sharp  engagements. The desert Arabs hovered like vultures in the distance  waiting for nightfall to cover them in their looting.    That night we camped near the bridge. At dusk the Red Cross ambulances and  some cavalry caught up. The latter had had a long, hard two days, with  little to eat for the men and less for the horses, but both were standing  up wonderfully. They were the Seventh Hussars and just as they reached us  we recaptured one of their sergeants who had been made prisoner on the  previous night. He had covered forty miles on foot, but the Turks had  treated him decently and he had come through in good shape. We always felt  that the Turk was a clean fighter. Our officers he treated well as long as  he had anything to give or share with them. With the enlisted men he was  not so considerate, but I am inclined to think that it was because he was  not accustomed to bother his head much about his own rank and file, so it  never occurred to him to consider ours. The Turkish private would thrive  on what was starvation issue to our men. The attitude of many of the  Turkish officers was amusing, if exasperating. They seemed to take it for  granted that they would be treated with every consideration due an honored  guest. They would complain bitterly about not being supplied with coffee,  although at the time we might be totally without it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13670"],[0,"The Happy Family (#12)"],[1,"at ease in the presence of strange women, and he felt, just now,  quite unequal to the ordeal of facing those two. He sat huddled in the  shadow of a rock and wished profanely that women would stay at home  and not go camping out in the Badlands, where their presence was  distinctly inappropriate and undesirable. If the men down there were  alone, he felt sure that he could make them understand. Seeing they  were not alone, however, he stayed where he was and watched the fires,  while his teeth chattered with cold and his stomach ached with the  hunger he could not appease.    Till daylight he sat there unhappily and watched the unwinking  challenge of the flames below, and miserably wished himself elsewhere;  even the jibes of the Happy Family would be endurable, so long as he  had the comfort afforded by the Flying U camp. But that was miles  away. And when daylight brought warmth and returning courage, he went  so far as to wish the Flying U camp farther away than it probably was.  He wanted to get somewhere, and ask help from strangers rather than  those he knew best.    With that idea fixed in his mind, he got stiffly to his bruised feet,  readjusted the sheepskin and began wearily to climb higher. When the  sun tinged all the hilltops golden yellow, he turned and shook his  fist impotently at the camp far beneath him. Then he went on doggedly.    Standing at last on a high peak, he looked away toward the sunrise and  made out a white speck on a grassy side-hill; beside it, a gray square  moved slowly over the green. Sheep, and a sheep camp--and Happy Jack,  hater of sheep though he was, hailed the sight as a bit of rare good  luck. His spirits rose immediately, and he started straight for the  place.    Down in the next coulee--there were always coulees to cross, no matter  in what direction one would travel--he came near running plump into  three riders, who were Irish Mallory, and Weary, and Pink. They were  riding down from the direction of the camp where were the women, and  they caught sight of him immediately and gave chase. Happy Jack had no  mind to be rounded up by that trio; he dodged into the bushes, and  though they dug long, unmerciful scratches in his person, clung to the  shelter they gave and made off at top speed. He could hear the others  shouting at one another as they galloped here and there trying to  locate him, and he skulked where the bushes were deepest, like a  criminal in fear of lynching.    Luck, for once, was with him, and he got out into another  brush-fringed coulee without being seen, and felt himself, for the  present, safe from that portion of the Happy Family. Thereafter he  avoided religiously the higher ridges, and kept the direction more by  instinct than by actual knowledge. The sun grew hot again and he  hurried on, shifting the sheepskin as the need impressed.    When at last he sighted again the sheep, they were very close. Happy  Jack grew cautious; he crept down upon the unsuspecting herder as  stealthily as an animal hunting its breakfast. Herders sometimes carry  guns--and the experience of last night burned hot in his memory.    Slipping warily from rock to rock, he was within a dozen feet, when a  dog barked and betrayed his presence. The herder did not have a gun.  He gave a yell of pure terror and started for camp after his weapon.  Happy Jack, yelling also, with long leaps followed after. Twice the  herder looked over his shoulder at the weird figure in gray hat and  flapping sheepskin, and immediately after each glance his pace  increased perceptibly. Still Happy Jack, desperate beyond measure,  doggedly pursued, and his long legs lessened at each jump the distance  between. From a spectacular viewpoint, it must have been a pretty  race.    The herder, with a gasp, dove into the tent; into the tent Happy Jack  dove after him--and none too soon. The hand of the herder had almost  clasped his rifle when the weight of Happy bore him shrieking to the  earthen floor.    \"Aw, yuh locoed old fool, shut up, can't yuh, a minute?\" Happy Jack,  with his fingers pressed against the windpipe of the other, had the  satisfaction of seeing his request granted at once. The shrieks died  to mere gurgling. \"What I want uh _you_,\" Happy went on crossly,  \"ain't your lifeblood, yuh dam' Swede idiot. I want some clothes, and  some grub; and I want to borry that pinto I seen picketed out in the  hollow, down there. Now, will yuh let up that yelling and act white,  or must I pound some p'liteness into yuh? Say!\"    \"By damn, Ay tank yo' vas got soom crazy,\" apologized the herder  humbly, sanity growing in his pale blue eyes. \"Ay tank--\"    \"Oh, I don't give a cuss what you _tank_,\" Happy Jack cut in. \"I ain't  had anything to eat sence yesterday forenoon, and I ain't had any  clothes on sence yesterday, either. Send them darn dogs back to watch  your sheep, and get busy with breakfast! I've got a lot to do, t'-day.  I've got to round up my horse and get my clothes that's tied to the  saddle, and get t' where I'm going. Get up, darn yuh! I ain't going t'  eat yuh--not unless you're too slow with that grub.\"    The herder was submissive and placating, and permitted Happy Jack to  appropriate the conventional garb of a male human, the while coffee  and bacon were maddening his hunger with their tantalizing odor. He  seemed much more at ease, once he saw that Happy Jack, properly  clothed, was not particularly fearsome to look upon, and talked  volubly while he got out bread and stewed prunes and boiled beans for  the thrice-unexpected guest.    Happy Jack, clothed and fed, became himself again and prophesied  gloomily: \"The chances is, that horse uh mine'll be forty miles away  and still going, by this time; but soon as I can round him up, I'll  bring your pinto back. Yuh needn't t' worry none; I guess I got all  the sense I've ever had.\"    Once more astride a horse--albeit the pinto pony of a  sheepherder--Happy Jack felt abundantly able to cope with the  situation. He made a detour that put him far from where the three he  most dreaded to meet were apt to be, and struck out at the pinto's  best pace for the river at the point where he had crossed so  disastrously the day before.    Having a good memory for directions and localities, he easily found  the place of unhappy memory; and taking up Stranger's trail through  the sand from there, he got the general direction of his flight and  followed vengefully after; rode for an hour up a long, grassy coulee,  and came suddenly upon the fugitive feeding quietly beside a spring.  The bundle of clothing was still tied firmly to the saddle, and at  sight of it the face of Happy Jack relaxed somewhat from its gloom.    When Happy rode up and cast a loop over his head Stranger nickered a  bit, as if he did not much enjoy freedom while he yet bore the  trappings of servitude. And his submission was so instant and  voluntary that Happy Jack had not the heart to do as he had threatened  many times in the last few hours--\"to beat the hide off him.\" Instead,  he got hastily into his clothes--quite as if he feared they might  again be whisked away from him--and then rubbed forgivingly the nose  of Stranger, and solicitously pulled a few strands of his forelock  from under the brow-band. In the heart of Happy Jack was a great  peace, marred only by the physical discomforts of much sun-blister and  many deep scratches. After that he got thankfully into his own saddle  and rode gladly away, leading the pinto pony behind him. He had got  out of the scrape, and the Happy Family would never find it out; it  was not likely that they would chance upon the Swede herder, or if  they did, that they would exchange with him many words. The Happy  Family held itself physically, mentally, morally and socially far  above sheepherders--and in that lay the safety of Happy Jack.    It was nearly noon when he reached again the sheep camp, and the Swede  hospitably urged him to stay and eat with him; but Happy Jack would  not tarry, for he was anxious to reach the camp of the Flying U. A  mile from the herder's camp he saw again on a distant hilltop three  familiar figures. This time he did not dodge into shelter, but urged  Stranger to a gallop and rode boldly toward them. They greeted him  joyfully and at the top of their voices when he came within shouting  distance.    \"How comes it you're riding the pinnacles over here?\" Weary wanted to  know, as soon as he rode alongside.    \"Aw, I just came over after more orders; hope they send somebody else  over there, if they want any more repping done,\" Happy Jack said, in  his customary tone of discontent with circumstances.    \"Say! Yuh didn't see anything of a wild man, down next the river, did  yuh?\" put in Pink.    \"Aw, gwan! what wild man?\" Happy Jack eyed them suspiciously.    \"Honest, there's a wild man ranging around here in these hills,\" Pink  declared. \"We've been mooching around all forenoon, hunting him. Got  sight of him, early this morning, but he got away in the brush.\"    Happy Jack looked guilty, and even more suspicious. Was it possible  that they had recognized him?    \"The way we come to hear about him,\" Weary explained, \"we happened  across some campers, over in a little coulee to the west uh here. They  was all worked up over him. Seems he went into camp last night, and  like to scared the ladies into fits. He ain't got enough clothes on to  flag an antelope, according to them, and he's about seven feet high,  and looks more like a missing link than a plain, ordinary man. The one  that didn't faint away got the best look at him, and she's ready to  take oath he ain't more'n half human. They kept fires burning all  night to scare him out uh the coulee, and they're going to break camp  to-day and hike for home. They say he give a screech that'd put a  crimp in the devil himself, and went galloping off, jumping about  twenty feet at a lick. And--\"    \"Aw, gwan!\" protested Happy Jack, feebly.  "]]]
