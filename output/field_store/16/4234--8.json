Thus a Ghoorka's religious  conscience is respected: an Englishman's is insulted and outraged.    But, indeed, all these oaths are obstructive and useless superstitions.  No recruit will hesitate to pledge his word of honour to fight to the  death for his country or for a cause with which he sympathizes; and that  is all we require. There is no need to drag in Almighty God and no need  to drag in the King. Many an Irishman, many a colonial Republican, many  an American volunteer who would fight against the Prussian monarchy  shoulder to shoulder with the French Republicans with a will, would  rather not pretend to do it out of devotion to the British throne. To  vanquish Prussia in this war we need the active aid or the sympathy of  every Republican in the world. America, for instance, sympathizes with  England, but classes the King with the Kaiser as an obsolete  institution. Besides, even from the courtly point of view the situation  is a delicate one. Why emphasize the fact that, formally speaking, the  war is between two grandsons of Albert the Good, that thoroughbred  German whose London monument is so much grander than Cromwell's?    The Labour Party should also set its face firmly against the abandonment  of Red Cross work and finance, or the support of soldiers' families, or  the patrolling of the streets, to amateurs who regard the war as a  wholesome patriotic exercise, or as the latest amusement in the way of  charity bazaars, or as a fountain of self-righteousness. Civil  volunteering is needed urgently enough: one of the difficulties of war  is that it creates in certain departments a demand so abnormal that no  peace establishment can cope with it. But the volunteers should be  disciplined and paid: we are not so poor that we need spunge on anyone.  And in hospital and medical service war ought not at present to cost  more than peace would if the victims of our commercial system were  properly tended, and our Public Health service adequately extended and  manned. We should therefore treat our Red Cross department as if it were  destined to become a permanent service. No charity and no amateur  anarchy and incompetence should be tolerated. As to allowing that  admirable detective agency for the defence of the West End against  begging letter writers, the Charity Organization Society to touch the  soldier's home, the very suggestion is an outrage. The C.O.S., the Poor  Law, and the charitable amateur, whether of the patronizing or prying or  gushing variety, must be kept as far from the army and its folk as if  they were German spies. The business of our fashionable amateurs is to  pay Income Tax and Supertax. This time they will have to pay through the  nose, vigorously wrung for that purpose by the House of Commons; so they  had better set their own houses in order and leave the business of the  war to be officially and responsibly dealt with and paid for at full  standard rates.      *Wanted: Labour Representation in the War Office.*    But parliamentary activity is not sufficient. There must be a more  direct contact between representative Labour and the Army, because  Parliament can only remedy grievances, and that not before years of  delay and agitation elapse. Even then the grievances are not dealt with  on their merits; for under our party system, which is the most  abominable engine for the perversion and final destruction of all  political conscience ever devized by man, the House of Commons never  votes on any question but whether the Government shall remain in office  or give the Opposition a turn, no matter what the pretext for the  division may be. Only in such emergencies as the present, when the  Government is forced to beg the Labour members to help them to recruit,  is there a chance of making reasonable conditions for the soldier.      *The Four Inoculations.*    It is therefore necessary that the War Office should have working class  representatives on all committees and councils which issue notices to  the public. There is at present, it would seem, not a single person in  authority there who has the faintest notion of what the immense majority  of possible British recruits are thinking about. The results have been  beyond description ludicrous and dangerous. Every proclamation is  urgently worded so as to reassure recruits with L5,000 a year and repel  recruits with a pound a week. On the very day when the popular Lord  Kitchener, dropping even the _et rex meus_ of Wolsey, frankly asked the  nation for 100,000 men for his army, and when it was a matter of life  and death that every encouragement should be held out to working men to  enlist, the War Office decided that this was the psychological moment to  remind everybody that soldiers on active service often die of typhoid  fever, and to press inoculation on the recruits pending the officially  longed-for hour when Sir Almroth Wright's demand for compulsion can be  complied with. I say nothing here about the efficacy of inoculation.  Efficacious or not, Sir Almroth Wright himself bases his demand for  compulsion on the ground that it is hopeless to expect the whole army to  submit to it voluntarily. That being so, it seems to me that when men  are hesitating on the threshold of the recruiting station, only a German  spy or our War Office (always worth ten thousand men to our enemies)  would seize that moment to catch the nervous postulant by the sleeve and  say, \"Have you thought of the danger of dysentery?\" The fact that the  working class forced the Government, very much against its doctor-ridden  will, to abolish compulsory vaccination, shews the extent to which its  households loathe and dread these vaccines (so called, but totally  unconnected with cows or Jenner) which, as they are continually reminded  by energetic anti-inoculation propagandists in largely circulated  journals and pamphlets, not to mention ghastly photographs of disfigured  children, sometimes produce worse effects than the diseases they are  supposed to prevent. Indifferent or careless recruits are easily induced  to submit to inoculation by little privileges during the ensuing  indisposition or by small money bribes; and careful ones are  proselytized by Sir Almroth's statistics; but on the whole both  inoculation and amateur medical statistics are regarded with suspicion  by the poor; and the fact that revaccination is compulsory in the  regular army, and that the moral pressure applied to secure both typhoid  inoculation and vaccination both in the regular army and the  Territorials is such as only a few stalwarts are able to resist, is  deeply resented. At present the inoculation mania has reached the pitch  of proposing no less than four separate inoculations: revaccination,  typhoid, cholera, and--Sir Almroth's last staggerer--inoculation against  wounds! When the War Office and its medical advisers have been  successfully inoculated against political lunacy, it will be time enough  to discuss such extravagances. Meanwhile, the sooner the War Office  issues a proclamation that no recruit will be either compelled or  importuned to submit to any sort of inoculation whatever against his  will, the better for the recruiting, and the worse for the enemy.      *The War Office Bait of Starvation.*    But this blunder was a joke compared to the next exploit of the War  Office. It suddenly began to placard the country with frantic assurances  to its five-thousand-a-year friends that they would be \"discharged with  all possible speed THE MINUTE THE WAR IS OVER.\" Only considerations of  space restrained them, I presume, from adding \"LAWN TENNIS, SHOOTING,  AND ALL THE DELIGHTS OF FASHIONABLE LIFE CAN BE RESUMED IMMEDIATELY ON  THE FIRING OF THE LAST SHOT.\" Now what does this mean to the wage  worker? Simply that the moment he is no longer wanted in the trenches he  will be flung back into the labour market to sink or swim without an  hour's respite. If we had had a Labour representative or two to help in  drawing up these silly placards--I am almost tempted to say if we had  had any human being of any class with half the brains of a rabbit  there--the placards would have contained a solemn promise that no single  man should be discharged at the conclusion of the war, save at his own  request, until a job had been found for him in civil life. I ask the  heavens, with a shudder, do these class-blinded people in authority  really intend to take a million men out of their employment; turn them  into soldiers; and then at one blow hurl them back, utterly unprovided  for, into the streets?    But a War Office capable of placarding Lord Roberts's declaration that  the men who are enlisting are doing \"what all able-bodied men in the  kingdom should do\" is clearly ignorant enough for anything. I do not  blame Lord Roberts for his oratorical flourish: we have all said things  just as absurd on the platform in moments of enthusiasm. But the  officials who reproduced it in cold blood would have us believe that  soldiers live on air; that ammunition drops from heaven like manna; and  that an army could hold the field for twenty-four hours without the  support of a still more numerous body of civilians working hard to  support it. Sane men gasp at such placards and ask angrily, \"What sort  of fools do you take us for?\" I have in my hand a copy of _The Torquay  Times_ containing a hospitable invitation to soldiers' wives to call at  the War Office, Whitehall, S.W., if they desire \"assistance and  explanation of their case.\" The return fare from Torquay to London is  thirty shillings and sixpence third class; but the War Office no doubt  assumes that all soldiers' wives keep motor cars. Still, let "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1364"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Electric Locomotive; Or, Two Miles a Minute on the Rails (#12)"],[1,"ws! who left his bundle of overalls in here?  Better take 'em out to be manicured. Whose are these?\"    Two or three of the mechanics working near looked up from their tasks.  Mr. Swift turned back to the door of the cab again.    \"What is the matter now, Tom?\" he asked, in added curiosity.    \"That bundle, Dad.\"    Tom once more appeared and addressed the workmen: \"Whose bundle of  dirty overalls is this in here? Come and take 'em away. They shouldn't  have been left here.\"    \"Why, Mr. Tom,\" said the foreman who was near, \"I didn't see any soiled  overalls in there when I left last evening. Any of you fellows,\" he  asked the group of hands, \"know anything about any overalls?\"    \"The bundle is here all right. Pushed back against the third series  motors. Come up here, one of you fellows--\"    Suddenly there was a noise at the end of the shed where the door to the  offices lay. Two figures burst through from the glass doors and charged  down the lanes between the lathes and cranes.  Ned Newton led, Rad  Sampson, his face a mouse-gray with fear, followed.    \"Massa Tom! Massa Tom!\" shouted the colored man. \"Look out fo' de bomb!  Look out fo' de bomb!\"    The foreman sprang toward the high door of the locomotive where Tom  stood, staring out. The young inventor, quick as his mind usually  functioned, did not understand at all what Eradicate meant.    \"There's something wrong in there, Mr. Tom!\" shouted the foreman. \"Come  down, sir, and let me get up there and see what it is.\"    But Mr. Barton Swift grasped the meaning of what was going on more  quickly than anybody else. Tom's father, Tom frequently said, had spent  so many years investigating chemical and mechanical mysteries that he  saw more clearly and more exactly into and through most problems than  other people.    His raised voice now cut through the rumble of machinery and all the  other noises of the shop. Even Rad Sampson's delirious cry was dwarfed  by Mr. Swift's sharp tone:    \"Tom! The ticking of that watch! That means danger!\"    The declaration seemed to rip away a curtain from Tom's thoughts.  Perhaps Rad's cry about \"de bomb\" aided the young inventor to  understand the peril that threatened.    The faint ticking sound that had begun to annoy him during the past few  minutes betrayed the nature of the threatening peril.  Tom swung back  from the open doorway of the locomotive cab, reached in to the space  between the motors, and seized the bundle of overall stuff that he had  previously spied.    He knew instantly that the rapid ticking came from that bundle.  It  could be nothing but a time bomb. He had heard of such things and,  indeed, had seen one before, an infernal machine which, set like an  alarm clock, would go off at a certain time. That indicated time might  be an hour hence, or might be within a few seconds! Ned Newton, almost  at the spot, shouted to Tom when the latter reappeared with the bundle  in his hands:    \"Get down out of that, Tom Swift! Quick! For your life!\"    But Tom was cool enough now. He saw his father's white, strained face  at one side and the young inventor could even smile at him. Behind the  foreman was set a barrel of water in which tools were cooled and  tempered.    \"Stoop, McAvoy!\" Tom shouted, and tossed the bundle from him.    Had the infernal machine exploded in midair Tom would not have been  surprised. But McAvoy dodged, Rad clapped his hands over his ears, and,  even Ned Newton halted like a bird-dog at point.    The bundle splashed into the barrel of water. It sank to the bottom.  There was no explosion. When a few seconds had passed the group of  excited men began to relax. The barrel was carried carefully to a  neighboring field.    \"Fo' de lawsy sake!\" gasped Rad, and got a full breath again.    \"That was touch and go, sure enough,\" muttered Ned Newton.    \"Those overalls sure went to the wash, Boss,\" declared the foreman.  \"What was in 'em? And who put 'em in the cab up there?\"    But Tom dropped down the ladder and went to his father. Their hands  sought each other and gripped, hard.    \"Better not tell Mary about this,\" whispered Tom. \"She's worried enough  as it is.\"    \"Right, Tom,\" agreed the old inventor. \"From this time on we cannot be  too careful. If there proves to be an infernal machine in that package  we may be sure that we are dealing with desperate men. We've got to  keep our eyes open.\"    \"Wide open,\" added Ned.    \"I'll say we have,\" said Tom.          Chapter XII    The Try-Out Day Arrives      It did not need Ned Newton's story of what he had overheard at the bank  to prove that an attempt had been made to blow to pieces Tom Swift's  electric locomotive before even it had been tested.    An examination of the water-soaked package in the open yard of the  shops of the Swift Construction Company, proved that there was enough  explosive in the bomb to blow the shed itself to pieces. But the  stopping of the clockwork attachment of course made the bomb harmless.    \"The main thing to be explained,\" Tom said, when he and his father and  Ned discussed the particulars of the affair, \"is not who did it, or  what it was done for. Those are comparatively easy questions to answer.\"    \"Yes,\" agreed Ned. \"O'Malley did it, or caused it to be done; and it  was an attempt to balk Mr. Bartholomew and the H, & P. A.  rather than  a direct attack upon the Swift Construction Company.\"    \"I am afraid, however,\" remarked Mr. Swift, \"that Tom has aroused the  personal antagonism of this spy from the West. We must not overlook  that.\"    \"I don't,\" replied the young inventor. \"O'Malley has it in for me. No  doubt of that. But he could not be sure that I would be hurt by the  explosion he arranged for.\"    \"True,\" said his father.    \"The attempt was against my invention. And O'Malley was doubtless urged  to destroy the locomotive that I am building because my success will  aid Mr. Bartholomew and his railroad.\"    \"Quite agreed,\" said Ned. \"But--\"    \"But the important question,\" interrupted Tom, \"is this: How did the  bomb get into the interior of the electric locomotive?  That is the  first and most important problem. Its having been done once warns us  that it can be done again until our system of guarding the works is  changed.\"    \"We have five watchmen on the job at night, and the gates are never  opened in the daytime to anybody for any purpose without a pass,\"  declared Ned. \"I don't see how that fellow got in here with the time  bomb.\"    \"Exactly. It shows that there is a fault in our system somewhere,\" said  Tom grimly. \"We cannot surround the place at night with an armed guard.  It would cost too much. Even Koku cannot be everywhere. And I have  reason to know that he was wandering about the stockade last night as  usual.\"    \"The fellow was pretty sharp to slip by,\" Ned observed.    \"The stockade is no mean barrier, especially with the rows of barbed  wire at the top,\" said Mr. Swift.    \"Barbed wire! That's it!\" exclaimed Tom. It was just here that Mr.  Damon's idea for guarding his prize buff Orpingtons came into play in  Tom's scheme of things. \"Barbed wire doesn't seem to keep out spies,\"  he added slowly. \"But believe me, something else will!\"    For Tom to think of a thing was to start action without delay.  Immediately he called a gang from the shops and set them to work  stringing copper wire along the top of the stockade.    He was sure that the man who had set the time bomb in place had got  into the enclosure over the fence. If he tried the same trick again he  was very apt to have the surprise of his life!    Each night when the shops closed and the watchmen went on duty, a  current of electricity was turned into those copper wires entwined with  the barbed wire entanglement at the top of the stockade that would  certainly double up any marauder who sought to get over the top.    However, no further attempt was made against Tom's peace of mind and  against his invention during the immediate weeks that followed. The  young inventor was so closely engaged in his work that he scarcely left  the house or the confines of the shops.  Even Mary Nestor saw very  little of him.    But Mary realized fully that at such a time as this Tom must give all  his thought and energy to the task in hand. She was proud of Tom's  ability and took a deep interest in his inventions.    \"I want to see the test when you try the locomotive, Tom,\" she told  him, when she came to the shops the first time to look at the monster  locomotive. \"What a wonderful thing it is!\"    \"Its wonder is yet to be proved,\" rejoined the young inventor.  \"I  believe I've got the right idea; but nothing is sure as yet.\"    In addition to his mechanical contrivances inside the locomotive, Tom  had to arrange for an increased supply of electric power to drive the  huge machine around the track that was being built inside the stockade.    A regular station had to be built for receiving the electricity in a  100,000-volt alternating current and delivering it to the locomotive in  a 3,000-volt direct current. Therefore, this station had two functions  to perform--reducing the voltage and changing the current from  alternating to direct.    The reduction of the voltage was accomplished as follows: The  100,000-volt alternating current was received through an oil switch and  was conveyed to a high-tension current distributor made up of three  lines of copper tubing, thus forming the source of power for this  station.    From the current distributor the current was conducted through other  oil switches to the transformers--entering at 100,000 volts and  emerging at 2,300 volts. Then the current was conducted from the  transformers through switches to the motor-generator sets and became  the power employed to operate them.    The motor generator consisted of one alternating current motor driving  two direct current generators. The motor Tom established in his station  was of the 60-cycle synchronous type, which means that"]]]
