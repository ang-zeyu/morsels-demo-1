At the  request of James V. he translated the _Historia Gentis Scotorum_ of  Boece. This translation, _Chroniklis of Scotland_ is a very free one,  with a good deal of matter not in the original, so that it may be almost  considered as a new work. It was _pub._ in 1536, and is the earliest  existing specimen of Scottish literary prose. He also translated the  first five books of Livy. He enjoyed the Royal favour, and was Archdeacon  of Moray. He latterly, however, became involved in controversy which led  to his going to Rome, where he _d._, according to one account, about  1550. Another authority, however, states that he was living in 1587.      BENTHAM, JEREMY (1748-1832).--Writer on jurisprudence and politics, _b._  in London, _s._ of a prosperous attorney, _ed._ at Westminster and  Oxford, was called to the Bar at Lincoln's Inn, but disliking the law, he  made little or no effort to practise, but devoted himself to physical  science and the theory of jurisprudence. In 1776 he _pub._ anonymously  his _Fragment on Government_, an able criticism of Blackstone's  _Commentaries_, which brought him under the notice of Lord Shelburne, and  in 1780 his _Introduction to Principles of Morals and Legislation_. Other  works were _Panopticon_, in which he suggested improvements on prison  discipline, _Discourse on Civil and Penal Legislation_ (1802),  _Punishments and Rewards_ (1811), _Parliamentary Reform Catechism_  (1817), and _A Treatise on Judicial Evidence_. By the death of his _f._  he inherited a competency on which he was able to live in frugal  elegance, not unmixed with eccentricity. B. is the first and perhaps the  greatest of the \"philosophical radicals,\" and his fundamental principle  is utilitarianism or \"the greatest happiness of the greatest number,\" a  phrase of which he is generally, though erroneously, regarded as the  author. The effect of his writings on legislation and the administration  of the law has been almost incalculable. He left his body to be  dissected; and his skeleton, clothed in his usual attire, is preserved in  University College, London.    _Life_ by Bowring in collected works (J.H. Barton, 11 vols., 1844).  _Study of Life and Work_, Atkinson, 1903.      BENTLEY, RICHARD (1662-1742).--Theologian, scholar, and critic, _b._ in  Yorkshire of humble parentage, went at the age of 14 to Camb.,  afterwards had charge of a school at Spalding, and then becoming tutor to  the _s._ of Dr. Stillingfleet, Dean of St. Paul's, afterwards Bishop of  Worcester (_q.v.i_), accompanied his pupil to Oxf. After taking his  degree at both universities, and entering the Church, he laid the  foundation of his reputation as perhaps the greatest scholar England has  produced by his letter in Mill's ed. of the _Chronicle of John Malelas_,  and his _Dissertation on the Letters of Phalaris_ (1699), which spread  his fame through Europe. After receiving various preferments, including  the Boyle lectureship and the Keepership of the Royal Library, he was, in  1700, appointed Master of Trinity, and afterwards was, largely owing to  his own pugnacity and rapacity, which were almost equal to his learning,  involved in a succession of litigations and controversies. These lasted  for 20 years, and led to the temporary loss of his academic preferments  and honours. In 1717, however, he was appointed Regius Prof. of Divinity.  During the contentions referred to he continued his literary activity  without abatement, and _pub._ various ed. of the classics, including  Horace and Terence. He was much less successful in certain emendations of  Milton which he attempted. Having incurred the resentment of Pope he was  rewarded by being assigned a niche in _The Dunciad!_ His style is strong  and nervous, and sparkles with wit and sarcasm. His classical  controversies called forth Swift's _Battle of the Books_.    _Life_ by Monk (1833). _Life_ by Sir R. Jebb in _English Men of Letters_  (1882).      BERESFORD, JAMES (1764-1840).--Miscellaneous writer and clergyman. He  made translations and wrote religious books, but was chiefly known as the  author of a satirical work, _The Miseries of Human Life_ (1806-7.)      BERKELEY, GEORGE (1685-1753).--Philosopher, eldest _s._ of William B., a  cadet of the noble family of Berkeley, _b._ at Kilcrin near Kilkenny, and  _ed._ at the school of his native place and at Trinity Coll., Dublin,  where he graduated and took a Fellowship in 1707. His earliest  publication was a mathematical one; but the first which brought him into  notice was his _Essay towards a New Theory of Vision_, _pub._ in 1709.  Though giving rise to much controversy at the time, its conclusions are  now accepted as an established part of the theory of optics. There next  appeared in 1710 the _Treatise concerning the Principles of Human  Knowledge_, which was followed in 1713 by _Dialogues between Hylas_ and  _Philonous_, in which he propounded his system of philosophy, the leading  principle of which is that the world as represented to our senses depends  for its existence on being perceived. Of this theory the _Principles_  gives the exposition and the _Dialogues_ the defence. One of his main  objects was to combat the prevailing materialism of the time. A theory so  novel was, as might be expected, received with widespread ridicule,  though his genius was realised by some of the more elect spirits, such as  Dr. S. Clarke. Shortly afterwards B. visited England, and was received  into the circle of Addison, Pope, and Steele. He then went to the  Continent in various capacities, and on his return was made Lecturer in  Divinity and Greek in his university, D.D. in 1721, and Dean of Derry in  1724. In 1725 he formed the project of founding a college in Bermuda for  training ministers for the colonies, and missionaries to the Indians, in  pursuit of which he gave up his deanery with its income of L1100, and  went to America on a salary of L100. Disappointed of promised aid from  Government he returned, and was appointed Bishop of Cloyne. Soon  afterwards he _pub._ _Alciphron, or The Minute Philosopher_, directed  against Shaftesbury, and in 1734-37 _The Querist_. His last publications  were _Siris_, a treatise on the medicinal virtues of tar-water, and  _Further Thoughts on Tar-water_. He _d._ at Oxford in 1753. His  affectionate disposition and genial manners made him much beloved. As a  thinker his is the greatest name in English philosophy between Locke and  Hume. His style is clear and dignified.    The best ed. of B. is Prof. A.C. Fraser's, with Life (4 vols., 1871, and  new, 1902); there is also a small work by the same (1881).      BERNERS, BERNES, or BARNES, JULIANA (_b._ 1388?).--Writer on heraldry and  sports. Nothing of her real history is known, but statements more or less  mythical have gathered round her name. The work attributed to her is _The  Boke of St. Albans_ (1486). It consists of four treatises on _Hawking_,  _Hunting_, _The Lynage of Coote Armiris_, and _The Blasynge of Armis_.  She was said to be the _dau._ of Sir James B., and to have been Prioress  of Sopwell Nunnery, Herts.      BERNERS, JOHN BOURCHIER, 2ND LORD (1467-1553).--Translator, _b._ at  Sherfield, Herts and _ed._ at Oxf., held various offices of state,  including that of Chancellor of the Exchequer to Henry VIII., and  Lieutenant of Calais, where he _d._ He translated, at the King's desire,  _Froissart's Chronicles_ (1523-25), in such a manner as to make distinct  advance in English historical writing, and the _Golden Book of Marcus  Aurelius_ (1534); also _The History of Arthur of Lytell Brytaine_  (Brittany), and the romance of _Huon of Bordeaux_.      BESANT, SIR WALTER (1836-1901).--Novelist and historian of London, _b._  at Portsmouth and _ed._ at King's Coll., London, and Camb., was for a few  years a professor at Mauritius, but a breakdown in health compelled him  to resign, and he returned to England and took the duties of Secretary to  the Palestine Exploration Fund, which he held 1868-85. He _pub._ in 1868  _Studies in French Poetry_. Three years later he began his collaboration  with James Rice (_q.v._). Among their joint productions are _Ready-money  Mortiboy_ (1872), and the _Golden Butterfly_ (1876), both, especially the  latter, very successful. This connection was brought to an end by the  death of Rice in 1882. Thereafter B. continued to write voluminously at  his own hand, his leading novels being _All in a Garden Fair_, _Dorothy  Forster_ (his own favourite), _Children of Gibeon_, and _All Sorts and  Conditions of Men_. The two latter belonged to a series in which he  endeavoured to arouse the public conscience to a sense of the sadness of  life among the poorest classes in cities. In this crusade B. had  considerable success, the establishment of The People's Palace in the  East of London being one result. In addition to his work in fiction B.  wrote largely on the history and topography of London. His plans in this  field were left unfinished: among his books on this subject is _London in  the 18th Century_.    Other works among novels are _My Little Girl_, _With Harp and Crown_,  _This Son of Vulcan_, _The Monks of Thelema_, _By Celia's Arbour_, and  _The Chaplain of the Fleet_, all with Rice; and _The Ivory Gate_, _Beyond  the Dreams of Avarice_, _The Master Craftsman_, _The Fourth Generation_,  etc., alone. _London under the Stuarts_, _London under the Tudors_ are  historical.      BICKERSTAFFE, ISAAC (_c._ 1735-1812?).--Dramatic writer, in early life a  page to Lord Chesterfield when Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, produced  between 1756 and 1771 many dramatic pieces, which had considerable  popularity, the best known of which are _Love in a Village_ (1762), and  _The Maid of the Mill_. Owing to misconduct he was dismissed from being  an officer in the Marines, and had ultimately, in 1772, to fly the  country. The remainder of his life seems to have been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13241"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science - Volume 1, No. (#12)"],[1,"decided indirectly my future fortunes--and, in the next chapter,  both shall be detailed.           *       *       *       *       *    CHAPTER II.      \"_Antonio_. Thou knowest that all my fortunes are at sea;    Nor have I money or commodity,    To raise a present sum.\"    _Merchant of Venice_.    The _Boheeil Kistanaugh_, called in plain English, the kitchen boy,  had entered, not like Caliban, \"bearing a log,\" but with a basket  full. He deposited the supply, and was directed by the commander  to replenish the fire. I believe that Petereeine's allegiance to my  father originated in fear rather than affection. He dreaded      \"the deep damnation of his 'Bah!'\"    but what was a still more formidable consideration, was a black-thorn  stick which the colonel had carried since he gave up the sword; it  was a beauty, upon which every fellow that came for law, in or out of  custody, lavished his admiration--a clean crop, with three inches of  an iron ferule on the extremity. My father was, \"good easy man,\" a  true Milesian philosopher--his arguments were those impressive ones,  called _ad hominem_, and after he had _grassed_ his man, he explained  the reason at his leisure.    _Petereeine_ (little Peter), as he was called, to distinguish him from  another of that apostolic name--who was six feet two--approached the  colonel in his best state of health with much alarm; but, when a fit  of the gout was on--when a foot swathed in flannel, or slippered and  rested on a hassock, announced the anthritic visitation, Petereeine  would hold strong doubts whether, had the choice been allowed, he  should not have preferred entering one of Van Amburgh's dens, to  facing the commander in the dining-room.    Petereeine was nervous--he had overheard his master blowing to the  skies the Reverend George Cantwell, and the red-headed rector, Paul  Macrony. If a parson and a priest were so treated, what chance had he?  and great was his trepidation, accordingly, when he entered the state  chamber, as in duty bound.    \"Why the devil did you not answer the bell? You knew well enough, you  incorrible scoundrel! that I wanted you.\"    Now my father's opening address was not calculated to restore  Petereeine's mental serenity--and to add to his uneasiness, he also  caught sight of that infernal implement, the black-thorn, which, in  treacherous repose, was resting at my father's elbow.    \"On with some wood, you vagabond.\"    The order was obeyed--and Petereeine conveyed a couple of billets  safely from the basket to the grate. The next essay, however, was a  failure--the third log fell--and if the fall were not great, as it  dropped on the fender, it certainly was very noisy. The accident  was harmless--for, according to honest admeasurement, it evaded my  father's foot by a full yard--but, under nervous alarm, he swore,  and, as troopers will swear, that it had descended direct upon his  afflicted member, and, consequently that he was ruined for life. This  was a subsequent explanation--while the unhappy youth was extended  on the hearth-rug, protesting innocence, and also declaring that  his jaw-bone was fractured. The fall of the billet and the boy were  things simultaneous--and while my mother, in great alarm, inculcated  patience under suffering, and hinted at resignation, my father, in  return, swore awfully, that no man with a toe of treble its natural  dimensions, and scarlet as a soldiers jacket, had ever possessed  either of those Christian articles. My mother quoted the case of  Job--and my father begged to inquire if there was any authority to  prove that Job ever had the gout? In the mean time, the kitchen-boy  had gathered himself up and departed--and as he left the presence with  his hand pressed upon his cheek, loud were his lamentations. Constance  and I--nobody enjoyed the ridiculous more than she did--laughed  heartily, while the colonel resented this want of sympathy, by calling  us a brace of fools, and expressing his settled conviction, that were  he, the commander, hanged, we, the delinquents, would giggle at the  foot of the gallows.    Such was the state of affairs, when the entrance of the chief butler  harbingered other occurrences, and much more serious than Petereeine's  damaged jaw. Mick Kalligan had been in the \"heavies\" with my father,  and at Salamanca, had ridden the opening charge, side by side, with  him, greatly to the detriment of divers Frenchmen, and much to the  satisfaction of his present master. In executing this achievement,  Mick had been a considerable sufferer--his ribs having been invaded by  a red lancer of the guard--while a _chausseur-a-cheval_ had inserted  a lasting token of his affection across his right cheek, extremely  honorable, but by no means ornamental.    Mick laid a couple of newspapers, and as many letters, on the  table--but before we proceed to open either, we will favor the reader  with another peep into our family history.    Manifold are the ruinous phantasies which lead unhappy mortals to  pandemonium. This one has a fancy for the turf, another patronizes the  last imported _choryphee_. The turf is generally a settler--the stage  is also a safe road to a safe settlement, and between a race-horse and  a _danseuse_, we would not give a sixpence for choice. Now, as far as  horse-flesh went, my grandfather was innocent; a _pirouette_ or _pas  seul_, barring an Irish jig, he never witnessed in his life--but he  had discovered as good a method for settling a private gentleman. He  had an inveterate fancy for electioneering. The man who would reform  state abuses, deserves well of his country; there is a great deal of  patriotism in Ireland; in fact, it is, like linen, a staple article  generally, but still the best pay-master is safe to win; and hence, my  poor grandfather generally lost the race.    My father looked very suspiciously at the letters--one had his own  armorial bearings displayed in red wax--and the formal direction was  at a glance detected to be that of his aunt Catharine--Catharine's  missives were never agreeable--she had a rent charge on the property  for a couple of thousands; and, like Moses and Son, her system was  \"quick returns,\" and the interest was consequently expected to the  day. For a few seconds my father hesitated, but he manfully broke the  seal--muttering, audibly, \"What can the old rattle-trap write about?  Her interest-money is not due for another fortnight.\" He threw his  eyes hastily over the contents--his color heightened--and my aunt  Catharine's epistle was flung, and most unceremoniously, upon the  ground--the hope that accompanied the act, being the reverse of a  benediction.    \"Is there anything wrong, dear James?\" inquired my mother, in her  usual quiet and timid tone.    \"Wrong!\" thundered my father; \"Frank will read this spiritual  production to you. Every line breathes a deep anxiety on old  Kitty's part for my soul's welfare, earthly considerations being  non-important. Read, Frank, and if you will not devoutly wish that the  doting fool was at the dev--\"    \"Stop, my dear James.\"    \"Well-read, Frank, and say, when you hear the contents, whether you  would be particularly sorry to learn that the old lady had, as sailors  say, her hands well greased, and a fast hold upon the moon? Read,  d----n it, man! there's no trouble in deciphering my aunt Catharine's  penmanship. Hers is not what Tony Lumpkin complained of--a cursed  cramp hand; all clear and unmistakable--the _t_'s accurately stroked  across, and the _i_'s dotted to a nicety. Go on--read, man, read.\"    I obeyed the order, and thus ran the missive, my honored father adding  a running commentary at every important passage; shall place them in  italics--    \"'MY DEAR NEPHEW,'\"    \"_Oh, ---- her affection!_\"    \"'If, by a merciful dispensation, I shall be permitted to have a few  spiritual minded friends to-morrow, at four o'clock, at dinner--'\"    \"_Temps militaire--they won't fail you, my old girl._\"    \"'I shall then have reached an age to which few arrive--look to the  psalm--namely, to eighty--'\"    \"_She's eighty-three_--\"    \"'I have, under the mercy of Providence, and the ministry of a  chosen vessel, the Reverend Carter Kettlewell, and also a worshiping  Christian learned in the law, namely, Mr. Selby Sly, put my earthly  house in order.
