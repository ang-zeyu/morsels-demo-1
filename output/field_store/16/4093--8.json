She  wouldn't tell me a darn word you said. But she hung onto my hands,  an' showed every way without speakin' how she wanted to thank me fer  bringin' you over. Buck, it was plain to me thet you'd either gone the  limit or else you'd been kinder prodigal of cheer an' hope. I'd hate to  think you'd led Jennie to hope more'n ever would come true.\"    Euchre paused, and, as there seemed no reply forthcoming, he went on:    \"Buck, I've seen some outlaws whose word was good. Mine is. You can  trust me. I trusted you, didn't I, takin' you over there an' puttin' you  wise to my tryin' to help thet poor kid?\"    Thus enjoined by Euchre, Duane began to tell the conversations with  Jennie and Mrs. Bland word for word. Long before he had reached an end  Euchre set down the coffee-cup and began to stare, and at the conclusion  of the story his face lost some of its red color and beads of sweat  stood out thickly on his brow.    \"Wal, if thet doesn't floor me!\" he ejaculated, blinking at Duane.  \"Young man, I figgered you was some swift, an' sure to make your mark on  this river; but I reckon I missed your real caliber. So thet's what  it means to be a man! I guess I'd forgot. Wal, I'm old, an' even if my  heart was in the right place I never was built fer big stunts. Do you  know what it'll take to do all you promised Jen?\"    \"I haven't any idea,\" replied Duane, gravely.    \"You'll have to pull the wool over Kate Bland's eyes, ant even if she  falls in love with you, which's shore likely, thet won't be easy.  An' she'd kill you in a minnit, Buck, if she ever got wise. You ain't  mistaken her none, are you?\"    \"Not me, Euchre. She's a woman. I'd fear her more than any man.\"    \"Wal, you'll have to kill Bland an' Chess Alloway an' Rugg, an' mebbe  some others, before you can ride off into the hills with thet girl.\"    \"Why? Can't we plan to be nice to Mrs. Bland and then at an opportune  time sneak off without any gun-play?\"    \"Don't see how on earth,\" returned Euchre, earnestly. \"When Bland's  away he leaves all kinds of spies an' scouts watchin' the valley trails.  They've all got rifles. You couldn't git by them. But when the boss is  home there's a difference. Only, of course, him an' Chess keep their  eyes peeled. They both stay to home pretty much, except when they're  playin' monte or poker over at Benson's. So I say the best bet is to  pick out a good time in the afternoon, drift over careless-like with a  couple of hosses, choke Mrs. Bland or knock her on the head, take Jennie  with you, an' make a rush to git out of the valley. If you had luck you  might pull thet stunt without throwin' a gun. But I reckon the best  figgerin' would include dodgin' some lead an' leavin' at least Bland or  Alloway dead behind you. I'm figgerin', of course, thet when they come  home an' find out you're visitin' Kate frequent they'll jest naturally  look fer results. Chess don't like you, fer no reason except you're  swift on the draw--mebbe swifter 'n him. Thet's the hell of this  gun-play business. No one can ever tell who's the swifter of two gunmen  till they meet. Thet fact holds a fascination mebbe you'll learn some  day. Bland would treat you civil onless there was reason not to, an'  then I don't believe he'd invite himself to a meetin' with you. He'd set  Chess or Rugg to put you out of the way. Still Bland's no coward, an' if  you came across him at a bad moment you'd have to be quicker 'n you was  with Bosomer.\"    \"All right. I'll meet what comes,\" said Duane, quickly. \"The great point  is to have horses ready and pick the right moment, then rush the trick  through.\"    \"Thet's the ONLY chance fer success. An' you can't do it alone.\"    \"I'll have to. I wouldn't ask you to help me. Leave you behind!\"    \"Wal, I'll take my chances,\" replied Euchre, gruffly. \"I'm goin' to help  Jennie, you can gamble your last peso on thet. There's only four men in  this camp who would shoot me--Bland, an' his right-hand pards, an' thet  rabbit-faced Benson. If you happened to put out Bland and Chess, I'd  stand a good show with the other two. Anyway, I'm old an' tired--what's  the difference if I do git plugged? I can risk as much as you, Buck,  even if I am afraid of gun-play. You said correct, 'Hosses ready, the  right minnit, then rush the trick.' Thet much 's settled. Now let's  figger all the little details.\"    They talked and planned, though in truth it was Euchre who planned,  Duane who listened and agreed. While awaiting the return of Bland and  his lieutenants it would be well for Duane to grow friendly with the  other outlaws, to sit in a few games of monte, or show a willingness  to spend a little money. The two schemers were to call upon Mrs. Bland  every day--Euchre to carry messages of cheer and warning to Jennie,  Duane to blind the elder woman at any cost. These preliminaries decided  upon, they proceeded to put them into action.    No hard task was it to win the friendship of the most of those  good-natured outlaws. They were used to men of a better order than  theirs coming to the hidden camps and sooner or later sinking to their  lower level. Besides, with them everything was easy come, easy go. That  was why life itself went on so carelessly and usually ended so cheaply.  There were men among them, however, that made Duane feel that terrible  inexplicable wrath rise in his breast. He could not bear to be near  them. He could not trust himself. He felt that any instant a word,  a deed, something might call too deeply to that instinct he could no  longer control. Jackrabbit Benson was one of these men. Because of  him and other outlaws of his ilk Duane could scarcely ever forget  the reality of things. This was a hidden valley, a robbers' den, a  rendezvous for murderers, a wild place stained red by deeds of wild men.  And because of that there was always a charged atmosphere. The merriest,  idlest, most careless moment might in the flash of an eye end in  ruthless and tragic action. In an assemblage of desperate characters it  could not be otherwise. The terrible thing that Duane sensed was this.  The valley was beautiful, sunny, fragrant, a place to dream in; the  mountaintops were always blue or gold rimmed, the yellow river slid  slowly and majestically by, the birds sang in the cottonwoods, the  horses grazed and pranced, children played and women longed for love,  freedom, happiness; the outlaws rode in and out, free with money and  speech; they lived comfortably in their adobe homes, smoked, gambled,  talked, laughed, whiled away the idle hours--and all the time life there  was wrong, and the simplest moment might be precipitated by that evil  into the most awful of contrasts. Duane felt rather than saw a dark,  brooding shadow over the valley.    Then, without any solicitation or encouragement from Duane, the Bland  woman fell passionately in love with him. His conscience was never  troubled about the beginning of that affair. She launched herself. It  took no great perspicuity on his part to see that. And the thing which  evidently held her in check was the newness, the strangeness, and for  the moment the all-satisfying fact of his respect for her. Duane exerted  himself to please, to amuse, to interest, to fascinate her, and always  with deference. That was his strong point, and it had made his part  easy so far. He believed he could carry the whole scheme through without  involving himself any deeper.    He was playing at a game of love--playing with life and deaths Sometimes  he trembled, not that he feared Bland or Alloway or any other man, but  at the deeps of life he had come to see into. He was carried out of his  old mood. Not once since this daring motive had stirred him had he  been haunted by the phantom of Bain beside his bed. Rather had he been  haunted by Jennie's sad face, her wistful smile, her eyes. He never was  able to speak a word to her. What little communication he had with her  was through Euchre, who carried short messages. But he caught glimpses  of her every time he went to the Bland house. She contrived somehow to  pass door or window, to give him a look when chance afforded. And Duane  discovered with surprise that these moments were more thrilling to  him than any with Mrs. Bland. Often Duane knew Jennie was sitting just  inside the window, and then he felt inspired in his talk, and it was  all made for her. So at least she came to know him while as yet she was  almost a stranger. Jennie had been instructed by Euchre to listen, to  understand that this was Duane's only chance to help keep her mind from  constant worry, to gather the import of every word which had a double  meaning.    Euchre said that the girl had begun to wither under the strain, to burn  up with intense hope which had flamed within her. But all the difference  Duane could see was a paler face and darker, more wonderful eyes. The  eyes seemed to be entreating him to hurry, that time was flying, that  soon it might be too late. Then there was another meaning in them, a  light, a strange fire wholly inexplicable to Duane. It was only a flash  gone in an instant. But he remembered it because he had never seen it in  any other woman's eyes. And all through those waiting days he knew that  Jennie's face, and especially the warm, fleeting glance she gave him,  was responsible for a subtle and gradual change in him. This change  he fancied, was only that through remembrance of her he got rid of his  pale, sickening ghosts.    One day a careless Mexican threw a lighted cigarette up into the brush  matting that served as a ceiling for Benson's den, and there was a fire  which left little more than the adobe walls standing. The result was  that while repairs were being made there was no gambling and drinking.  Time hung very heavily on the hands of some two-score outlaws. Days  passed by without a brawl, and Bland's valley saw more successive hours  of peace than ever "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10317"],[0,"Betty Gordon at Boarding School; Or, The Treasure of Indian Chasm (#12)"],[1,"excitement.    \"The day before she was to drive to Edentown,\" repeated Norma, \"a band of  Indians from the reservation in the next state came through on their  annual tramping trip and walked in on poor little grandma as she sat at  her mahogany secretary turning over her jewels and counting her beautiful  shining gold. Every darkey on the place fled in terror, and those  rascally Indians simply scooped up everything in sight and locked grandma  and mother in the room!\"    \"Couldn't any one stop them?\" demanded Betty eagerly. \"Surely a band of  Indians could have been easily traced. Didn't any one try?\"    \"Oh, they tried,\" admitted Norma. \"That's the maddening part. Suppose I  told you, Betty, that I know where grandma's inheritance is this minute?\"          CHAPTER XIII    THE MYSTERIOUS FOUR      \"Well, for mercy's sake!\" said Betty in exasperation, \"if you know  where the property is, why don't you claim it? Why doesn't your mother?  Where is it?\"    \"At the bottom of Indian Chasm,\" declared Norma calmly.    \"Where's that?\"    \"I don't know exactly,\" admitted Norma. \"It's around here somewhere. You  see the Indians streaked for the woods, and mother got out by way of a  window and ran to the next estate. The men and boys there armed  themselves and took horses and chased the Redskins, and when they were  almost up with them the robbers tossed everything down this great canyon  in the earth. There was no way to get into it, and though they tried  lowering men with ropes, they couldn't find a solitary gold piece. As far  as any one knows it is all at the bottom of the chasm now.\"    \"And grandma had to mortgage the house and they couldn't pay the interest  and it was sold and all the lovely mahogany furniture,\" mourned Alice.  \"And grandma and mother moved to New York and mother taught school and  met dad, who was a medical student. And they were married when he  graduated, and grandma came to live with 'em.\"    Betty crept away to her own bed when the story was finished. Bobby was  asleep, for which her chum was thankful. Betty wanted to think. Surely  there must be a way to recover the Macklin fortune, if it was still down  in the big chasm.    \"I'll tell Bob and we'll go and find that place. Perhaps he can think of  a plan,\" was Betty's last thought before she went to sleep.    The next few days were very busy ones for every pupil. Ada and Ruth, in  tears, submitted to having their wardrobes censored, and thereafter  appeared in clothes that were not too striking.    The appointments with Mrs. Eustice materialized, and Betty, after her  interview, was conscious of a sincere affection for the woman who seemed  to understand girls so thoroughly.    Bobby was \"crazy,\" to quote her own expression, about the gymnasium  classes, and Miss Anderson beamed approvingly upon her. Betty, too, was  often to be found in the gymnasium after school hours, but Libbie had to  be driven to regular exercise. She liked to dance, but unless some one  was made responsible for her, she was prone to cut her regular gymnasium  period and devote the time to some thrilling novel. When the other girls  discovered this they good-naturedly made up a schedule for the week,  assigning a different day to every girl whose duty it should be to \"seal,  sign and deliver\" the reluctant Libbie at the gymnasium door at the  appointed time.    Mrs. Eustice, rather peculiarly some people thought--Ada Nansen's mother  among them--held the theory that school girls should spend a fair  proportion of their time in study. She had small patience with the  faddist type of school that abhorred \"night work\" and whose students  specialized on \"manners\" to the neglect of spelling.    \"I dislike the term 'finishing school,'\" she had once said. \"I try  to teach my girls that what they learn in school fits them for  beginning life.\"    So from seven to half-past eight every night, except Friday, the pupils  at Shadyside were busy with their books. They might study in their rooms,  provided their marks for the preceding week were satisfactory, but those  who fell below a certain percentage were sentenced to prepare their  lessons in the study hall under the eye of a teacher.    The second Friday night of the term the new students were warned by  little pink cocked notes to remain in their rooms after dinner until they  had been inspected by the \"Mysterious Four.\"    \"It's a secret society,\" Bobby announced the moment she had read her  note. \"Well, let's go upstairs and prepare to be inspected.\"    The eight gathered in Betty and Bobby's room, and though they were  expecting it, the knock, when it finally did come, made them all jump.    \"Come--come in,\" stammered Betty and Bobby together.    Four veiled figures entered, each carrying something in her hand. They  spoke in disguised voices, though as they were upper classmen they were  fairly safe from recognition; the new girls were hardly acquainted among  themselves and knew few of the older students by name.    \"Freshmen,\" said the tallest figure, \"when we enter, rise.\"    The eight leaped to their feet at a bound.    \"Do you wish to become members of the Mysterious Four?\" demanded the  second figure.    \"Oh, yes,\" chorused the willing victims.    \"It is well,\" chanted the third figure.    \"It is well,\" echoed the fourth.    \"I don't,\" said Libbie calmly.    \"Don't what?\" questioned the tallest figure, evidently appointed chief  spokesman.    \"Want to be a member of the Mysterious Four,\" announced Libbie, who had  an obstinate streak in her make-up.    \"Unfortunately,\" the spokesman informed her, \"you haven't any choice in  the matter; you're elected one already.\"    While Libbie was thinking up an answer, which considering the finality  of that statement, was not an easy matter, the tall draped figure went  on to explain to the interested girls that there were two degrees to  be undergone before one could be a full fledged member of the  Mysterious Four.    \"You must take the first degree to-night,\" they were told. \"The second  will be several weeks later.\"    \"Are we allowed to ask a question?\" asked Betty respectfully.    \"Oh, yes. But we may not answer it,\" was the cheering response.    \"Why is the society called the 'Mysterious Four'?\" asked Betty \"All the  freshman class received notes, so the membership must be large; where  does the four enter?\"    \"You'll learn that at the close of your first degree,\" said the spokesman  with firm kindness. \"Now you're to remain here for five minutes, and then  go down to the study hall. Five minutes, remember.\"    They departed majestically, and the girls were left to spend their five  minutes in discussion of the visit.    \"I don't see why I have to belong,\" grumbled Libbie.    \"It will do you good,\" said Bobby severely. \"When I promised Aunt  Elizabeth to look after you, I didn't know that meant I would have to  risk my head by sleeping under 'Lady Gwendolyn' in two volumes--and fat  ones at that\"    Libbie had the grace to blush. Bobby, who was fond of books but whose  taste ran to \"Rules for Basketball\" and \"How to Gain Health Through  Exercise,\" had put up a small shelf directly over her bed to hold her  literary treasures. Libbie, exhausting the space in her tiny corner  bookcase had thoughtlessly placed the two heavy volumes of the story  Bobby mentioned on top of her cousin's books with the awful result that  the shelf broke in the night and spilled the books on the wrathful Bobby.    \"Let's go down to the study hall,\" suggested peace-loving Louise. \"The  five minutes are up.\"    Down they trooped, to find a number of girls already there, for the most  part looking rather frightened.    At five minute intervals other groups entered, until all the freshman  class was assembled.    \"I don't care anything about this society,\" whispered Ada Nansen to  Ruth Royal. \"I wouldn't give fifty cents for an organization where no  discrimination is shown in choosing the members. However, this is  Mrs. Eustice's pet scheme, they tell me, and I want to stand well  with her. Next year I'm going to get elected to the White Scroll,  you see if I don't.\"    The Mysterious Four came in as the last group of girls were seated and  slowly mounted the platform.    \"Candidates,\" announced the leader, \"you are summoned here to take your  first degree. It is simple, but no shirking is to be permitted. You are  to do the one thing that you do best. As your names are called, you will  mount the platform and comply. Four minutes is allowed for decision--on  the platform.\"    There was a gasp from the audience, and one could almost see the mental  cog wheels of sixty girls going furiously to work.    \"Betty,\" whispered the desperate Bobby, \"what can you do best?\"    \"Ride, I guess,\" said Betty, recollections of Clover coming to mind.    There was a crashing chord from the piano. One of the veiled figures had  seated herself at the instrument and now proceeded to play \"appropriate  selections\" as the candidates performed their turns.    As the clever leader had foreseen, no one relished spending her allotted  four minutes for reflection on the platform in full view of the audience,  and the majority of the victims made up their minds with a rush.    After they had entered into the spirit of the thing, it was fun, and  their shrieks of laughter aroused sympathetic smiles in other rooms. No  teachers and no member of the other classes were permitted to enter, but  Aunt Nancy, the fat cook, and half a dozen young waitresses peeped in at  the door and enjoyed the spectacle hugely.    Betty Gordon obligingly cantered across the platform on a chair and won  applause by her realistic interpretation of western riding. Bobby  convulsed the room with her imaginary efforts to cut and fit a dress, her  mistakes being glaring ones, for Bobby never touched a needle if she  could help it. Clever Constance Howard had gone for her ukulele and  played it charmingly. Libbie insisted on giving the \"balcon"]]]
