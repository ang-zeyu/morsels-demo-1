Six--a box of  monies, three pounds of Limousine gold-work, a pair of boots, silver  tagged, and, lastly, a store of naping linen. So, the tally is complete!  Here is a groat apiece, and you may go.\"    \"Go whither, worthy sir?\" asked one of the carriers.    \"Whither? To the devil if ye will. What is it to me? Now, ma belle, to  supper. A pair of cold capons, a mortress of brawn, or what you will,  with a flask or two of the right Gascony. I have crowns in my pouch,  my sweet, and I mean to spend them. Bring in wine while the food is  dressing. Buvons my brave lads; you shall each empty a stoup with me.\"    Here was an offer which the company in an English inn at that or any  other date are slow to refuse. The flagons were re-gathered and came  back with the white foam dripping over their edges. Two of the woodmen  and three of the laborers drank their portions off hurriedly and trooped  off together, for their homes were distant and the hour late. The  others, however, drew closer, leaving the place of honor to the right  of the gleeman to the free-handed new-comer. He had thrown off his steel  cap and his brigandine, and had placed them with his sword, his quiver  and his painted long-bow, on the top of his varied heap of plunder in  the corner. Now, with his thick and somewhat bowed legs stretched in  front of the blaze, his green jerkin thrown open, and a great quart  pot held in his corded fist, he looked the picture of comfort and of  good-fellowship. His hard-set face had softened, and the thick crop of  crisp brown curls which had been hidden by his helmet grew low upon his  massive neck. He might have been forty years of age, though hard toil  and harder pleasure had left their grim marks upon his features. Alleyne  had ceased painting his pied merlin, and sat, brush in hand, staring  with open eyes at a type of man so strange and so unlike any whom he had  met. Men had been good or had been bad in his catalogue, but here was a  man who was fierce one instant and gentle the next, with a curse on his  lips and a smile in his eye. What was to be made of such a man as that?    It chanced that the soldier looked up and saw the questioning glance  which the young clerk threw upon him. He raised his flagon and drank to  him, with a merry flash of his white teeth.    \"A toi, mon garcon,\" he cried. \"Hast surely never seen a man-at-arms,  that thou shouldst stare so?\"    \"I never have,\" said Alleyne frankly, \"though I have oft heard talk of  their deeds.\"    \"By my hilt!\" cried the other, \"if you were to cross the narrow sea you  would find them as thick as bees at a tee-hole. Couldst not shoot a  bolt down any street of Bordeaux, I warrant, but you would pink archer,  squire, or knight. There are more breastplates than gaberdines to be  seen, I promise you.\"    \"And where got you all these pretty things?\" asked Hordle John, pointing  at the heap in the corner.    \"Where there is as much more waiting for any brave lad to pick it up.  Where a good man can always earn a good wage, and where he need look  upon no man as his paymaster, but just reach his hand out and help  himself. Aye, it is a goodly and a proper life. And here I drink to  mine old comrades, and the saints be with them! Arouse all together,  mes enfants, under pain of my displeasure. To Sir Claude Latour and the  White Company!\"    \"Sir Claude Latour and the White Company!\" shouted the travellers,  draining off their goblets.    \"Well quaffed, mes braves! It is for me to fill your cups again, since  you have drained them to my dear lads of the white jerkin. Hola! mon  ange, bring wine and ale. How runs the old stave?--            We'll drink all together          To the gray goose feather          And the land where the gray goose flew.\"    He roared out the catch in a harsh, unmusical voice, and ended with a  shout of laughter. \"I trust that I am a better bowman than a minstrel,\"  said he.    \"Methinks I have some remembrance of the lilt,\" remarked the gleeman,  running his fingers over the strings. \"Hoping that it will give thee no  offence, most holy sir\"--with a vicious snap at Alleyne--\"and with the  kind permit of the company, I will even venture upon it.\"    Many a time in the after days Alleyne Edricson seemed to see that scene,  for all that so many which were stranger and more stirring were soon  to crowd upon him. The fat, red-faced gleeman, the listening group, the  archer with upraised finger beating in time to the music, and the huge  sprawling figure of Hordle John, all thrown into red light and black  shadow by the flickering fire in the centre--memory was to come often  lovingly back to it. At the time he was lost in admiration at the deft  way in which the jongleur disguised the loss of his two missing strings,  and the lusty, hearty fashion in which he trolled out his little ballad  of the outland bowmen, which ran in some such fashion as this:              What of the bow?              The bow was made in England:          Of true wood, of yew wood,            The wood of English bows;              So men who are free              Love the old yew tree          And the land where the yew tree grows.              What of the cord?              The cord was made in England:          A rough cord, a tough cord,            A cord that bowmen love;              So we'll drain our jacks              To the English flax          And the land where the hemp was wove.              What of the shaft?              The shaft was cut in England:          A long shaft, a strong shaft,            Barbed and trim and true;              So we'll drink all together              To the gray goose feather          And the land where the gray goose flew.              What of the men?              The men were bred in England:          The bowman--the yeoman--            The lads of dale and fell              Here's to you--and to you;              To the hearts that are true          And the land where the true hearts dwell.    \"Well sung, by my hilt!\" shouted the archer in high delight. \"Many a  night have I heard that song, both in the old war-time and after in the  days of the White Company, when Black Simon of Norwich would lead the  stave, and four hundred of the best bowmen that ever drew string would  come roaring in upon the chorus. I have seen old John Hawkwood, the same  who has led half the Company into Italy, stand laughing in his beard as  he heard it, until his plates rattled again. But to get the full smack  of it ye must yourselves be English bowmen, and be far off upon an  outland soil.\"    Whilst the song had been singing Dame Eliza and the maid had placed a  board across two trestles, and had laid upon it the knife, the spoon,  the salt, the tranchoir of bread, and finally the smoking dish which  held the savory supper. The archer settled himself to it like one who  had known what it was to find good food scarce; but his tongue still  went as merrily as his teeth.    \"It passes me,\" he cried, \"how all you lusty fellows can bide scratching  your backs at home when there are such doings over the seas. Look at  me--what have I to do? It is but the eye to the cord, the cord to the  shaft, and the shaft to the mark. There is the whole song of it. It is  but what you do yourselves for pleasure upon a Sunday evening at the  parish village butts.\"    \"And the wage?\" asked a laborer.    \"You see what the wage brings,\" he answered. \"I eat of the best, and I  drink deep. I treat my friend, and I ask no friend to treat me. I clap  a silk gown on my girl's back. Never a knight's lady shall be better  betrimmed and betrinketed. How of all that, mon garcon? And how of the  heap of trifles that you can see for yourselves in yonder corner? They  are from the South French, every one, upon whom I have been making  war. By my hilt! camarades, I think that I may let my plunder speak for  itself.\"    \"It seems indeed to be a goodly service,\" said the tooth-drawer.    \"Tete bleu! yes, indeed. Then there is the chance of a ransom. Why, look  you, in the affair at Brignais some four years back, when the companies  slew James of Bourbon, and put his army to the sword, there was scarce a  man of ours who had not count, baron, or knight. Peter Karsdale, who  was but a common country lout newly brought over, with the English fleas  still hopping under his doublet, laid his great hands upon the Sieur  Amaury de Chatonville, who owns half Picardy, and had five thousand  crowns out of him, with his horse and harness. 'Tis true that a French  wench took it all off Peter as quick as the Frenchman paid it; but what  then? By the twang of string! it would be a bad thing if money was not  made to be spent; and how better than on woman--eh, ma belle?\"    \"It would indeed be a bad thing if we had not our brave archers to bring  wealth and kindly customs into the country,\" quoth Dame Eliza, on whom  the soldier's free and open ways had made a deep impression.    \"A toi, ma cherie!\" said he, with his hand over his heart. \"Hola! there  is la petite peeping from behind the door. A toi, aussi, ma petite! Mon  Dieu! but the lass has a good color!\"    \"There is one thing, fair sir,\" said the Cambridge student in his  piping voice, \"which I would fain that you would make more clear. As  I understand it, there was peace made at the town of Bretigny some six  years back between our most gracious monarch and the King of the French.  This being so, it seems most passing strange that you should talk so  loudly of war and of companies when there is no quarrel between the  French and us.\"    \"Meaning that I lie,\" said the archer, laying down his knife.    \"May heaven forfend!\" cried the student hastily. \"_Magna est veritas sed  rara_, which means in the Latin tongue that archers are all honorable  men. I come to you seeking knowledge, for it is my trade to learn.\"    \"I fear that you are yet a 'prentice"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9069"],[0,"Saint Augustin (#11)"],[1,"agaste. These two future  shepherds of Christ roamed the streets with the lost sheep. They spent  the nights in the open spaces of the town, playing, or wantonly dreaming  before cups of cool drinks. They lounged there, stretched out on mats, with  a crown of leaves on the head, a jasmine garland round the neck, a rose  or marigold thrust above the ear. They never knew what to do next to kill  time. So one fine evening the reckless crew took it into their heads to  rifle a pear tree of one of Patricius's neighbours. This pear tree was just  beyond the vineyard belonging to Augustin's father. The rascals shook down  the pears. They took a few bites to find out the taste, and having decided  this to be rather disappointing, they chucked all the rest to the hogs.    In this theft, done merely for the pleasure of the thing, Augustin sees  an evidence of diabolical mischief. Doubtless he committed many another  misdeed where, like this, the whole attraction lay in the Satanic joy  of breaking the law. His fury for dissolute courses knew no rest. Did  Monnica observe anything of this change in Augustin? The boy, grown big,  had escaped from the supervision of the women's apartments. If the mother  guessed anything, she did not guess all. It fell to her husband to open her  eyes. With the freedom of manners among the ancients, Augustin relates the  fact quite plainly.... That took place in the bath-buildings at Thagaste.  He was bathing with his father, probably in the _piscina_ of cold baths.  The bathers who came out of the water with dripping limbs were printing  wet marks of their feet upon the mosaic flooring, when Patricius, who was  watching them, suddenly perceived that his son had about him the signs  of manhood, that he was already bearing--as Augustin says himself in his  picturesque language--the first signs of turbulent youth, like another  _toga praetexta_. Patricius, as a good pagan, welcomed with jubilation this  promise of grand-children, and rushed off joyously to brag of his discovery  to Monnica. She took the news in quite another way. Frightened at the idea  of the dangers to which her son's virtue was exposed, she lectured him  in private. But Augustin, from the height of his sixteen years, laughed  at her. \"A lot of old-women's gossip! Why does she want to talk about  things she can't understand!...\" Tired out at last, Monnica tried to get  a promise from her son that he would at least have some restraint in his  dissipation--that he would avoid women of the town, and above all, that he  would have nothing to do with married women. For the rest, she put him in  God's hands.    It may be wondered--Augustin himself wonders--that she did not think of  finding him a wife. They marry early in Africa. Even now any Arab labourer  buys a wife for his son, hardly turned sixteen, so that the fires of a too  warm youth may be quenched in marriage. But Monnica, who was not yet a  saint, acted in this matter like a foreseeing and practical woman of the  prosperous class. A wife would be a drag for a young man like Augustin, who  seemed likely to have such a brilliant career. A too early marriage would  jeopardize his future. Before all things, it was important that he should  become an illustrious rhetorician, and raise the fortunes of the family.  For her, all else yielded to this consideration. But she hoped at least  that the headstrong student might consent to be good into the bargain.    This was also Patricius's way of looking at the matter. And so, says  Augustin, \"My father gave himself no concern how I grew towards Thee, or  how chaste I was, provided only that I became a man of culture--however  destitute of Thy culture, O God.... My mother and he slackened the curb  without regard to due severity, and I was suffered to enjoy myself  according to my dissolute fancy.\" Meanwhile, Patricius was now become  (very tardily) a catechumen. The entreaties of his wife had won him to the  Catholic faith. But his sentiments were not much more Christian--\"He hardly  thought of Thee, my God,\" acknowledges his son, who nevertheless was  pleased at this conversion. If Patricius decided to get converted, it was  probably from political reasons. Since the death of Julian the Apostate,  paganism appeared finally conquered. The Emperor Valentinianus had just  proclaimed heavy penalties against night-sacrifices. In Africa, the  Count Romanus persecuted the Donatists. All the Christians in Thagaste  were Catholic. What was the good of keeping up a useless and dangerous  resistance? Perhaps the end of Patricius--which was near--was as edifying  as Monnica could wish. But at all events, at the present moment, he was  not the man to interfere with Augustin's pleasures: he only thought of  the eventual fortune of the young man. Alone, Monnica might have had some  influence on him, and she herself was fascinated by his future career in  the world. Perhaps, to quiet her conscience, she said to herself that this  frivolous education would be more or less of a help to her son towards  bringing him back to God, that a day would come when the famous rhetorician  would plead the cause of Christ?...    Scandalized though she might be at his conduct, it is however apparent that  it was about this time she began to get fonder of him, to worry over him as  her favourite child. But it was not till much later that the union between  mother and son became quite complete. Too many old customs still remained  preventing close intercourse between the men and women of a family. And it  will hardly do to picture such intimacy from the intimacy which may exist  between a mother and son of our own time. There was none of the spoiling,  or indulgence, or culpable weakness which enervates maternal tenderness and  makes it injurious to the energy of a manly character. Monnica was severe  and a little rough. If she let her feelings be seen, it was solely before  God. And yet it is most certain that in the depth of her heart she loved  Augustin, not only as a future member of Christ, but humanly, as a woman  frustrated of love in a badly assorted marriage may spend her love on her  child. The brutality of pagan ways revolted her, and she poured on this  young head all her stored-up affection. In Augustin she loved the being she  wished she could love in her husband.    A number of personal considerations were no doubt involved in the deep and  unselfish attachment she had for her son: instinctively, she looked for him  to protect her against the father's violence. She felt that he would be the  support of her old age, and also, she foresaw dimly what one day he would  be. All this aided to bring about the tie, the understanding, which grew  more and more close between Augustin and Monnica. And so from this time  they both appear to us as they were to appear to all posterity--the pattern  of the Christian Mother and Son. Thanks to them, the hard law of the  ancients has been abrogated. There shall be no more barriers between the  mother and her child. No longer shall it be vain exterior rites which draw  together the members of the same family: they shall communicate in spirit  and truth. Heart speaketh to heart. The fellowship of souls is founded,  and the ties of the domestic hearth are drawn close, as they never were in  antiquity. No more shall they work in concert only for material things;  they will join together to love--and to love each other more. The son will  belong more to his mother.    At the time we have now come to, Monnica was already undertaking the  conquest of Augustin's soul. She prayed for him fervently. The young man  cared very little: gratitude came to him only after his conversion. At this  time he was thinking of nothing but amusement. For this he even forgot his  career. But Monnica and Patricius thought of it constantly--especially  Patricius, who gave himself enormous trouble to enable this student on a  holiday to finish his studies. Eventually he got together the necessary  money, possibly borrowed enough to make up the sum from some rich landowner  who was the patron of the people of small means in Thagaste--say, that  gorgeous Romanianus, to whom Augustin, in acknowledgment, dedicated one of  his first books. The young man could now take the road for Carthage.    He left by himself, craving for knowledge and glory and pleasure, his heart  full of longing for what he knew not, and melancholy without cause. What  was going to become of him in the great, unknown city?          THE SECOND PART    THE ENCHANTMENT OF CARTHAGE        Amare et amari.    \"To love and to be loved.\"    _Confessions_, III, i.          I    CARTHAGO VENERIS      \"I went to Carthage, where shameful loves bubbled round me like boiling  oil.\"    This cry of repentance, uttered by the converted Augustin twenty-five  years later, does not altogether stifle his words of admiration for the  old capital of his country. One can see this patriotic admiration stirring  between the lines. Carthage made a very strong impression on him. He gave  it his heart and remained faithful to the end. His enemies, the Donatists,  called him \"the Carthaginian arguer.\" After he became Bishop of Hippo, he  was continually going to Carthage to preach, or dispute, or consult his  colleagues, or to ask something from men in office. When he is not there,  he is ever speaking of it in his treatises and plain sermons. He takes  comparisons from it: \"You who have been to Carthage--\" he often says to  his listeners. For the boy from little Thagaste to go to Carthage, was  about the same as for our youths from the provinces to go to Paris. _Veni  Carthaginem_--in these simple words there is a touch of naive emphasis  which reveals the bewilderment of the Numidian student just landed in the  great city.    And, in fact, it was one of the five great capitals of the Empire: there  were Rome, Constantinople, Antioch, Alexandria--Carthage. Carthage was the  sea-port capital of the"]]]
