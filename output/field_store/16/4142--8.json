Come and take one good long look at yourself in the  glass, then I will turn it to the wall, and you must promise me that for  three or four weeks you will not look in a mirror. I will put as many as  I can out of your way, and you must avoid the remainder. During this  time I will take you in hand, and you must follow my directions  implicitly. Will you agree? You will be surprised what a nice-looking  little girl I will make of you.\"    Of course I agreed. I took a long and critical survey of myself in the  glass. There was reflected a pair of hands, red and coarsened with rough  work, a round face, shiny and swollen with crying, and a small round  figure enshrouded in masses of hair falling in thick waves to within an  inch or two of the knees. A very ugly spectacle, I thought. Aunt Helen  turned the face of the large mirror flat against the wall, while I  remarked despondently, \"you can make me only middling ugly, you must be  a magician.\"    \"Come now, part of my recipe is that you must not think of yourself at  all. I'll take you in hand in the morning. I hope you will like your  room; I have arranged it on purpose to suit you. And now good night, and  happy dreams.\"    I awoke next morning in very fine spirits, and slithering out of my bed  with alacrity, revelled--literally wallowed--in the appointments of my  room. My poor old room at Possum Gully was lacking in barest  necessaries. We could not afford even a wash-hand basin and jug; Gertie,  the boys, and myself had to perform our morning ablutions in a leaky tin  dish on a stool outside the kitchen door, which on cold frosty mornings  was a pretty peppery performance: but this room contained everything  dear to the heart of girlhood. A lovely bed, pretty slippers, dainty  white China-matting and many soft skins on the floor, and in one corner  a most artistic toilet set, and a wash-stand liberally supplied with a  great variety of soap--some of it so exquisitely perfumed that I felt  tempted to taste it. There were pretty pictures on the walls, and on a  commodious dressing-table a big mirror and large hand-glasses, with  their faces to the wall at present. Hairpins, fancy combs, ribbons  galore, and a pretty work-basket greeted my sight, and with delight I  swooped down upon the most excruciatingly lovely little writing-desk. It  was stuffed full with all kinds of paper of good quality--fancy, all  colours, sizes, and shapes, plain, foreign note, pens, ink, and a  generous supply of stamps. I felt like writing a dozen letters there and  then, and was on the point of giving way to my inclination, when my  attention was arrested by what I considered the gem of the whole  turn-out. I refer to a nice little bookcase containing copies of all our  Australian poets, and two or three dozen novels which I had often longed  to read. I read the first chapters of four of them, and then lost myself  in Gordon, and sat on my dressing-table in my nightgown, regardless of  cold, until brought to my senses by the breakfast-bell. I made great  pace, scrambled into my clothes helter-skelter, and appeared at table  when the others had been seated and unfolded their serviettes.    Aunt Helen's treatment for making me presentable was the wearing of  gloves and a shady hat every time I went outside; and she insisted upon  me spending a proper time over my toilet, and would not allow me to  encroach upon it with the contents of my bookshelf.    \"Rub off some of your gloomy pessimism and cultivate a little more  healthy girlish vanity, and you will do very well,\" she would say.    I observed these rites most religiously for three days. Then I  contracted a slight attack of influenza, and in poking around the  kitchen, doing one of the things I oughtn't at the time I shouldn't, a  servant-girl tipped a pot of boiling pot-liquor over my right foot,  scalding it rather severely. Aunt Helen and grannie put me to bed, where  I yelled with pain for hours like a mad Red Indian, despite their  applying every alleviative possible. The combined forces of the burn and  influenza made me a trifle dicky, so a decree went forth that I was to  stay in bed until recovered from both complaints. This effectually  prevented me from running in the way of any looking-glasses.    I was not sufficiently ill to be miserable, and being a pampered invalid  was therefore fine fun. Aunt Helen was a wonderful nurse. She dressed my  foot splendidly every morning, and put it in a comfortable position many  times throughout the day. Grannie brought me every dainty in the house,  and sent special messengers to Gool-Gool for more. Had I been a  professional glutton I would have been in paradise. Even Mr Hawden  condescended so far as to express his regret concerning the accident,  and favoured me with visits throughout each day; and one Sunday his  gallantry carried him to a gully where he plucked a bouquet of  maidenhair fern--the first of the season--and put them in a bowl beside  my bed. My uncle Julius, the only other member of the family besides the  servants, was away \"up the country\" on some business or another, and was  not expected home for a month or so.    The Bossiers and Beechams were leaders of swelldom among the  squattocracy up the country, and firm and intimate friends. The Beechams  resided at Five-Bob Downs, twelve miles from Caddagat, and were a family  composed of two maiden ladies and their nephew, Harold. One of these  ladies was aunt Helen's particular friend, and the other had stood in  the same capacity to my mother in days gone by, but of late years, on  account of her poverty, mother had been too proud to keep up  communication with her. As for Harold Beecham, he was nearly as much at  home at Caddagat as at Five-Bob Downs. He came and went with that  pleasant familiarity practised between congenial spirits among  squatterdom. The Bossiers and Beechams were congenial spirits in every  way--they lived in the one sphere and held the one set of ideas, the  only difference between them, and that an unnoticeable one, being that  the Bossiers, though in comfortable circumstances, were not at all rich,  while Harold Beecham was immensely wealthy. When my installation in the  role of invalid took place, one Miss Beecham was away in Melbourne, and  the other not well enough to come and see me, but Harold came regularly  to inquire how I was progressing. He always brought me a number of  beautiful apples. This kindness was because the Caddagat orchard had  been too infested with codlin moth for grannie to save any last season.    Aunt Helen used to mischievously tease me about this attention.    \"Here comes Harry Beecham with some more apples,\" she would say. \"No  doubt he is far more calculating and artful than I thought he was  capable of being. He is taking time by the forelock and wooing you ere  he sees you, and so will take the lead. Young ladies are in the minority  up this way, and every one is snapped up as soon as she arrives.\"    \"You'd better tell him how ugly I am, auntie, so that he will carry  apples twelve miles on his own responsibility, and when he sees me won't  be vexed that all his work has been for nothing. Perhaps, though, it  would be better not to describe me, or I will get no more apples,\" I  would reply.        Aunt Helen was a clever needlewoman. She made all grannie's dresses and  her own. Now she was making some for me, which, however, I was not to  see until I wore them. Aunt Helen had this as a pleasant surprise, and  went to the trouble of blindfolding me while I was being fitted. While  in bed, grannie and auntie being busy, I was often left hours alone, and  during that time devoured the contents of my bookshelf.    The pleasure, so exquisite as to be almost pain, which I derived from  the books, and especially the Australian poets, is beyond description.  In the narrow peasant life of Possum Gully I had been deprived of  companionship with people of refinement and education who would talk of  the things I loved; but, at last here was congeniality, here was  companionship.    The weird witchery of mighty bush, the breath of wide sunlit plains, the  sound of camp-bells and jingle of hobble chains, floating on the soft  twilight breezes, had come to these men and had written a tale on their  hearts as had been written on mine. The glory of the starlit heavens,  the mighty wonder of the sea, and the majesty of thunder had come home  to them, and the breathless fulness of the sunset hour had whispered of  something more than the humour of tomorrow's weather. The wind and rain  had a voice which spoke to Kendall, and he too had endured the misery of  lack of companionship. Gordon, with his sad, sad humanism and bitter  disappointment, held out his hand and took me with him. The regret of it  all was I could never meet them--Byron, Thackeray, Dickens, Longfellow,  Gordon, Kendall, the men I loved, all were dead; but, blissful thought!  Caine, Paterson, and Lawson were still living, breathing human  beings--two of them actually countrymen, fellow Australians!    I pored with renewed zeal over the terse realism and pathos of Lawson,  and enjoyed Paterson's redolence of the rollicking side of the wholesome  life beneath these sunny skies, which he depicted with grand touches of  power flashing here and there. I learnt them by heart, and in that  gloriously blue receptacle, by and by, where many pleasant youthful  dreams are stowed, I put the hope that one day I would clasp hands with  them, and feel and know the unspeakable comfort and heart-rest of  congenial companionship.          CHAPTER TEN    Everard Grey      Uncle Julius had taken a run down to Sydney before returning to  Caddagat, and was to be home during the first week in September,  bringing with him Everard Grey. This young gentleman always spent  Christmas at Caddagat,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11647"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 458, October 11, 1884 (#12)"],[1,"the leading wheels 4 ft. 3 in., the total wheel base being  16 ft. 6 in., and the tractive force 104 lb. for each lb. of mean cylinder  pressure. The boiler is of best Yorkshire iron, 10 ft. 4 in. long and 4  ft. 1 in. diameter. The grate area is 17.5 square feet, and the heating  surface is, in the tubes, 1,096; fire-box, 110; total, 1,206. There are  double frames to give outside bearings to the leading axle, as in the  Great Western engine, and the engine is fitted with a steam brake. The  weight in full working order is--leading wheels, 12 tons 2 cwt.; driving  wheels, 15 tons; trailing wheels, 11 tons 6 cwt.; total, 38 tons 8 cwt.  The tender weighs 26 tons 2 cwt., and holds 3,300 gallons of water and 5  tons of coal. Latterly a fine type of bogie express engine has been  introduced, with inside cylinders 18 in. diameter and 26 in. stroke, and  four coupled driving wheels 7 ft. diameter. The total wheel base to the  center of the bogie pin is 18 ft. 6 in. The grate area is 17.5 square  feet, and the heating surface is, in tubes, 1,203 square feet, and  fire-box, 110; total, 1,313; and the engine weighs 42 tons in working  order. These engines take fourteen coaches, or a gross load of 222 tons,  at 50 miles an hour over gradients of 1 in 120 to 1 in 130, with a  consumption of 28 lb. of coal per mile. The London, Chatham, and Dover  Company has also some fine engines of a similar type. They have inside  cylinders 171/2 in. diameter and 26 in. stroke; the coupled wheels are 6 ft.  6 in. diameter, and the bogie wheels 3 ft. 6 in., the wheel base to the  center of the bogie pin being 18 ft. 2 in. The boiler is 10 ft. 2 in. long  and 4 ft. 2 in. diameter, the grate area is 16.3 square feet, and the  heating surface is, in the tubes, 962 square feet; fire-box, 107 square  feet; total, 1,069. The boiler pressure is 140 lb., and the tractive force  per lb. of steam in the cylinder 102 lb. The weight in full working order  is, on the bogie wheels, 15 tons 10 cwt.; driving wheels, 13 tons 10 cwt.;  trailing wheels, 13 tons; total, 42 tons.    Mr. Worsdell has lately designed for the Great Eastern Railway a fine type  of coupled express engine, which deserves mention. It has inside  cylinders 18 in. diameter and 24 in. stroke, with coupled wheels 7 ft.  diameter and leading wheels 4 ft. diameter, the latter being fitted with a  radial axle on a somewhat similar plan to that previously described as  adopted by Mr. Webb for the new North-Western engines; the frames are  single, with inside bearings to all the wheels, and Joy's valve gear is  used. The boiler pressure is 140 lb., and the tractive power per lb. of  mean cylinder pressure 92 lb. The total wheel base is 17 ft. 6 in. The  boiler, which is fed by two injectors, is of steel, 11 ft. 5 in. long and  4 ft. 2 in. diameter. The grate area is 17.3 square feet, and the heating  surface is, in the tubes, 1,083; fire-box, 117; total, 1,200 sq. ft. The  weight in working order is, on the leading wheels, 12 tons 19 cwt.;  driving wheels, 15 tons; trailing wheels, 13 tons 4 cwt.; total, 41 tons 3  cwt. These engines burn 27 lb. of coal per train mile with trains  averaging thirteen coaches. It has been seen that the Cheshire lines  express between Liverpool and Manchester is one of the fastest in England,  and the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railway Company, who works  the trains, has just introduced a new class of engine specially for this  and other express trains on the line. The cylinders are outside, 171/2 in.  diameter and 26 in. stroke, with single driving wheels 7 ft. 5 in.  diameter, the leading and trailing wheels being 3 ft. 8 in. diameter. The  total wheel base is 15 ft. 9 in., and the frames are double, giving  outside bearings to the leading and trailing axles, and inside bearings to  the driving axle. The boiler is 11 ft. 6 in. long and 3 ft. 11 in.  diameter, and the grate area is 17 square feet. The heating surface is in  the tubes 1,057 square feet; fire-box, 87 square feet; total, 1,144 square  feet. The tractive force per pound of mean cylinder pressure is 88.4 lb.  The weight in full working order is, on the leading wheels, 11 tons 3  cwt.; driving wheels, 17 tons 11 cwt.; trailing wheels, 11 tons 18 cwt.;  total, 40 tons 12 cwt. This engine is remarkable for the great weight  thrown on the driving wheels, and its cylinder power is great in  proportion to its adhesion, thus allowing the steam to be worked at a high  rate of expansion, which is most favorable to the economical consumption  of fuel. There are numerous fine engines running on other lines, such as  the new bogie locomotives on the North-Eastern and Lancashire and  Yorkshire railways, and the coupled express engines on the Caledonian; but  those already described represent fairly the lending features of modern  practice, and the author will now notice briefly the two other classes of  engines--tank passenger engines for suburban and local traffic and goods  engines. The Brighton tank passenger engine is a good example of the  former class; it has inside cylinders 17 in. diameter and 24 in. stroke.  The two coupled wheels under the barrel of the boiler are 5 ft. 6 in.  diameter, and the trailing wheels 4 ft. 6 in.; there are single frames  with inside bearings to all the axles. The boiler pressure is 140 lb., and  the tractive force per pound of mean cylinder pressure 106 lb.; the total  wheel base is 14 ft. 6 in. The boiler is 10 ft. 2 in. long and 4 ft. 4 in.  diameter, and the heating surface is in the tubes, 858 square feet;  fire-box, 90 square feet; total, 948 square feet. The engine is furnished  with wing tanks holding 860 gallons of water, and carries 30 cwt. of coal.  The weight in working order is 38 tons. These engines have taken a maximum  load of twenty-five coaches between London and Brighton, but are mainly  employed in working the suburban and branch line traffic; their average  consumption of coal is 23.5 lb. per mile, with trains averaging about ten  coaches.    Another example is Mr. Webb's tank engine on the North-Western Railway,  which presents a contrast to the foregoing. It has inside cylinders 17 in.  diameter and 20 in. stroke, coupled wheels 4 ft. 6 in. diameter, and a  tractive power per lb. of mean cylinder pressure of 107 lb.; the wheel  base is 14 ft. 6 in. with a radial box to the leading axle; the heating  surface is in the tubes, 887; fire-box, 84; total, 971 square feet; the  weight in working order is 35 tons 15 cwt. The engine is fitted with  Webb's hydraulic brake, and steel, manufactured at Crewe, is largely used  in its construction. The consumption of coal-working fast passenger trains  has been 281/2 lb. per mile. There are many other types, such as the ten  wheel bogie tank engines of the London, Tilbury, and Southend and  South-Western railways; the saddle tank bogie engines, working the broad  gauge trains on the Great Western Railway, west of Newton; and the  familiar class working the Metropolitan and North London traffic. But the  same principle is adopted in nearly all--a flexible wheel base to enable  them to traverse sharp curves, small driving wheels coupled for adhesion,  and wing or saddle tanks to take the water. One notable exception is,  however, the little six wheel all-coupled engines weighing only 24 tons,  which work the South London traffic, burning 241/4 lb. of coal per mile,  with an average load of eleven coaches.    Goods engines on all lines do not vary much. As a rule they are six wheel  all-coupled engines, with generally 5 ft. wheels, and cylinders varying  between 17 in. and 18 in. diameter and 24 in. to 26 in. stroke; the grate  area is about 17 square feet, and the total heating surface from 1,000 to  1,200 sq. ft.; the average weight in full working order varies from 30 to  38 tons. One noteworthy exception occurs, however, on the Great Eastern  Railway, where a type of goods engine with a pony truck in front has been  introduced. The cylinders are outside 19 in. diameter and 26 in. stroke,  there are six coupled wheels 4 ft. 10 in. diameter, and the pony truck  wheels are 2 ft. 10 in. diameter; the total wheel wheel base is 23 ft. 2  in., but there are no flanges on the driving wheels. The boiler is 11 ft.  5 in. long and 4 ft. 5 in. diameter, the boiler pressure is 140 lb., and  the tractive force per lb. of mean cylinder pressure 162 lb.; the grate  area is 18.3 square feet, and the heating surface is in the tubes, 1,334  square feet; fire-box, 122 square feet; total, 1,456 square feet.    The weight in working order is on the pony truck, 8 tons 10 cwt.; leading  coupled, 12 tons 8 cwt.; driving coupled, 13 tons 5 cwt.; trailing  coupled, 12 tons 15 cwt.; total, 47 tons.    The tender weighs 28 tons in full working order. These engines take 40  loaded coal trucks or sixty empty ones, and burn 52 lb. of coal per train  mile, the worst gradient being 1 in 176. A notice of goods engines would  not be complete without alluding to a steep gradient locomotive, and a  good example is the engine which works the Redheugh Bank on the  North-Eastern Railway. This incline is 1,040 yards long, and rises for 570  yards 1 in 33, then for 260 yards 1 in 21.7, for 200 yards 1 in 25, and  finally for 110 yards 1 in 27. The engine, which is an all-coupled six  wheel tank engine, weighs 481/2 tons in working order, it has cylinders 18  in. diameter and 24 in. stroke, and 4 ft. wheels, the boiler pressure is  160 lb., and the tractive force per lb. of mean steam pressure in the  cylinders is 162 lb. This engine will take up the incline twenty-six coal  wagons, or a gross load of 218 tons, which is a very good duty indeed.    Having now passed in review the general types of engines adopted in modern  English practice, the author would briefly draw attention to some points  of design and some improvements effected in late years. And first, as to  the question of single or coupled engines, there is a great diversity of "]]]
