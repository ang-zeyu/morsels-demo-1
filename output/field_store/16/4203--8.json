He said, Petty (whom I had mentioned) had come      forward after having felt his way and got possession of      himself in the House, and that if he had done the same, he      perhaps would not hesitate. As it was, he inclined to the      second place, but had written to Lord Malmesbury. We walked up      to Hyde Park discussing the subject. Among other topics which      I urged, one seemed to impress him much; which was, the great      difference there would be in his situation and pretensions      upon a return to office, in the event of our going out, if      he retired as a Cabinet Minister instead of a subordinate      capacity. He allowed it much flattered his ambition, but      feared the prejudice it would occasion to his own reputation      and the interest of his friends if he failed. I left him      inclining to the Secretary at War; and admired his prudence,      as I have long done the talents and excellent understanding,      as well as the many other good qualities as well as      accomplishments, of this very fine young man.\"    One portion of the diary relates to the Regency. New facts are  scarcely advanced, but we think some freshness is given from the  light and coloring of the author. Unless Sheridan really persuaded  the Prince to throw over the Whigs, out of revenge for Whig hauteur,  his Royal Highness would seem to have acted entirely from himself.  The arrogance of Grey and Grenville comes out very strongly in the  painting of his opponent. After all, however, it is doubtful whether  they _could_ have come in. The Tories would have been strong in  Opposition; the Whigs could scarcely form a Government without the  Canning votes, and the hatred with which the old Whigs regarded their  leader rendered that junction impossible: what was more than all,  their cowardly anti-national policy would have rendered their position  one of great difficulty with the country. The fact is, that poor in  point of talent as the Perceval Ministry was, it best represented the  opinion of the country; as the Whigs now are in a similar position.  Some of these points are well put in this report of a conversation in  the House of Commons; which will also give an idea of the manner of  the diary.        \"J.W. Ward told me what he called a bon mot, and seemed much      to enjoy, of Lady ----'s. He had said there was a difficulty      in getting people to accept of offices just now; she answered,      she thought Lord Grenville would be not unwilling to accept      them _all_ in his own person. Oh strange union, where this,      by one of their party, is thought characteristic and told      with glee! I understand, however, that Tierney has confessed      a difficulty. The Prince, it seems, wants them to accept, and      they are afraid to accept. They are therefore reduced to tell      the Prince, We would accept if it were to do ourselves good;      but not when it is inconvenient, though to do you good.      The remarkable part of the evening was a conversation with      Brand, who came over to sit by me. Though he had spoken, and      strongly, against us in the debate, he opened immediately upon      the merits of Perceval; he admired his conduct and ability      so much, that if he had ever given him a vote in his life, he      said, he would have supported him on these questions; that      his character had enabled him to commence the stand he had      made, and character had attached his party so much to him as      to continue the majority all through; that this sentiment      was not peculiar to him in the Opposition, but partaken      by many--indeed, all without exception admired him; that      this would give him extraordinary influence as the head of      an Opposition, which must give great trouble, to the new      Government when it was formed: nevertheless, he thought we      were not going out, it was too dangerous to come in; probably,      he added, laughing, the Regent will keep Perceval three months      as his father's Minister, and then 'fall so much in love with      him' (that was the expression) that he will continue him      as his own. He then entered much on the comparison between      him and Canning; the latter of whom, he said, spite of his      abilities, was discarded by all parties; that he could tell      me it was finally resolved not to admit him in the new      Government, into which some on account of those abilities      had wished to introduce him. I may say, he observed, that I      had some share in the rejection: I protested against such a      junction whenever it was talked of; I told my friends it would      ruin that without which they never could make a Government,      character; that the eyes of a great number whom they could by      no means command were upon them: I bade them look at the back      rows on the side of Opposition, and asked them if they could      count such men as Nicholson, Calvert, Halsey, Coke of Norfolk,      &c., &c., as their regular supporters, unless it was from      an esteem for their character--and if that character would      not sustain a deep wound in the outset--if, for the sake of      power, they allied themselves with a man who had deserted all      alliances he had ever made; that he had deserted them before,      after a treaty made, and had then deserted Perceval, after      endeavoring to undermine Castlereagh; his conduct to whom had      injured himself with the public in the most serious manner,      in having allowed him to retain his office and undertake that      melancholy expedition, five months after he had declared      him so incapable that he put his own resignation upon his      dismissal, that to ally with such a man could be only lowering      themselves in public esteem without gaining anything but a      hollow support. I would inform Canning myself, he added, that      this was my protest, if he asked me.\"    The heads of the \"great Whig families,\" however, were more sanguine,  and hoped, or at least were occupied, to the last. Their treatment  by the Prince was characteristic; and one can fancy the magnates at  Adam's announcement in the following extract:        \"What most offended them was the manner in which the Prince      announced his resolution. They were in the very act of forming      the Administration, filling offices, &c., &c., when Adam came      in from the Prince. They said they could not be disturbed;      he said he must disturb them, for he had a message from the      Prince: they replied that it was for the Prince they were at      work, for they were making the Government; Adam told them to      spare all trouble, for no Government was to be made. This was      on Friday the 1st, in the evening; and what affronted them      was, that after having had such a task committed to them, the      Prince should have presumed to take a counter resolution by      himself without first consulting them.\"    This is a characteristic trait of the Duke of Wellington's way of  getting through, business.        \"He was fond of relating, that soon after the Duke's      appointment, he was leaving his office at the usual hour,      when, on coming out at the Park entrance, he perceived his new      chief just in the act of getting on horseback. He went up to      the Duke, and mentioned that there were some matters connected      with the department on which he would like to communicate      with him when he had time. 'No time like the present,' said      the Duke, and, at once dismissing his horse, returned with      Mr. Ward into the Ordnance Office. There, then, he remained      closeted with the Duke till past eight, listening to and      answering his pertinent queries upon manifold points connected      with the department. From that moment the Duke appeared to be      au fait of the business in hand, and ready to cope with the      details as they from time to time presented themselves.\"    The Duke seems to have been more alarmed at the state of the nation  about 1819 than the nature of the case justified; deceived, probably,  by the official \"reports\" of Messrs. Castles and Co. The following  remark, however, exhibits his penetration:        \"He said, if the rising broke out anywhere, it would be      at Glasgow and Paisley; where many rich merchants and all      they supported would be sure to suffer, while no one could      certainly foretell how soon it might be put down. This led      him to his favorite notion, that the loyal should be taught      to rely more upon themselves, and less upon the Government,      in their own defense against the disloyal. It was this, he      thought, that formed and kept up a national character: while      every one was accustomed to rely upon the Government, upon a      sort of commutation for what they paid to it, personal energy      went to sleep, and the end was lost: that in England, he      observed, every man who had the commonest independence, one,      two, five or six hundred, or a thousand a year, had his own      little plan of comfort--his favorite personal pursuit, whether      his library, his garden, his hunting, or his farm, which he      was unwilling to allow anything (even his own defense) to      disturb; he therefore deceived himself into a notion that if      there was a storm it would not reach him, and went on his own      train till it was actually broke in upon by force. This led      to supineness and apathy as to public exertion; which would in      the end ruin us: the disposition therefore must be changed,      by forcing them to exert themselves; which would not be if      Government did everything in civil war, they nothing: hence      his wish for a volunteer force. All this was exceedingly      sound, and showed the reach of his reflecting mind as an      observer of human nature, as well as a statesman and soldier,      more than anything I have yet "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13056"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 10 (#12)"],[1," close.  Give my best regards to mamma, and kiss the little one for me on the  left eye. Day after tomorrow, then, if I do not get the Stettin letter  sooner. Good-by, my sweet angel. Yours forever, v.B. Schoenhausen,  July 18, '49.    _My Pet_,--  * * * I wanted to write you in the evening, but the air was  so heavenly that I sat for two hours or so on the bench in front of  the garden-house, smoked and looked at the bats flying, just as with  you two years ago, my darling, before we started on our trip. The  trees stood so still and high near me, the air fragrant with linden  blossoms; in the garden a quail whistled and partridges allured, and  over beyond Arneburg lay the last pink border of the sunset. I was  truly filled with gratitude to God, and there arose before my soul the  quiet happiness of a family life filled with love, a peaceful haven,  into which a gust of wind perchance forces its way from the storms of  the world-ocean and ruffles the surface, but its warm depths remain  clear and still so long as the cross of the Lord is reflected in them.  Though the reflected image be often faint and distorted, God knows his  sign still. Do you give thanks to Him, too, my angel; think of the  many blessings He has conferred upon us, and the many dangers against  which He has protected us, and, with firm reliance on His strong hand,  confront the evil spirits with that when they try to affright your  sick fancy with all sorts of images of fear. * * *    Your most faithful  v.B.      Brandenburg, July 23, '49.    _My Beloved Nanne!_--I have just received your short letter of Friday,  which reassures me somewhat, as I infer from it that our little one  has not the croup, but the whooping-cough, which is, indeed, bad, but  not so dangerous as the other. You, poor dear, must have worried  yourself sick. It is very fortunate that you have such good assistance  from our people and the preacher, yet are you all somewhat lacking in  confidence, and increase each other's anxiety instead of comforting  one another. Barschall has just told me that all of his children have  had this croupy cough--that it was endemic in Posen in his time; his  own and other children were attacked by it repeatedly in the course of  a few days; that every family had an emetic of a certain kind on hand  in the house, and by that means overcame the enemy easily every time,  and without permanent consequences for the child. Be comforted, then,  and trust in the Lord God; He does, indeed, show us the rod that He  has ready for us, but I have the firm belief that He will put it back  behind the mirror. As a child I, too, suffered from whooping-cough to  the extent of inflammation of the lungs, and yet entirely outgrew it.  I have the greatest longing to be with you, my angel, and think day  and night about you and your distress, and about the little creature,  during all the wild turmoil of the elections. * * *    Here in Brandenburg the party of the centre is decidedly stronger than  ours; in the country districts I hope it is the other way, yet the  fact cannot be overlooked. It is incredible what cock-and-bull stories  the democrats tell the peasants about me; in fact, one from the  Schoenhausen district, three miles from us, confided to me yesterday  that, when my name is mentioned among them, a regular shudder goes  through them from head to foot, as though they should get a couple of  \"old-Prussian broadsword strokes\" laid across their shoulders. As an  opponent said recently, at a meeting, \"Do you mean to elect Bismarck  Schoenhausen, the man 'who, in the countryman's evening prayer, stands  hard by the devil'?\" (From Grillparzer's _Ahnfrau_.) And yet I am the  most soft-hearted person in the world towards the common people. On  the whole, my election here in these circumstances seems very doubtful  to me; and as I do not believe I shall be elected in the other place  either, when I am not there personally, we may live together quietly  the rest of the summer, if it be God's will, and I will pet you into  recovery from your fright about the child, my darling. Have no anxiety  whatever about my personal safety; one hears nothing of the cholera  here except in a letter from Reinfeld. The first rule to observe, if  it should come nearer to you, is to speak of it as little as possible;  by speaking, one always augments the fear of others, and fear of it  is the easiest bridge on which it can enter the human body. * * *    God guard you and your child, and all our house.    Your most faithful    v.B.    It is better not to leave the doors all open constantly, for the child  often gets shock from the draught, when one is opened, before you can  prevent it.      (Postmark, Berlin, August 8, '49.)    _My Love_,--I sent you a letter this morning, and have just received  yours, in reply to which I will add a few more words touching the  wet-nurse. If any one besides you and father and mother already knows  about the matter, in the house or outside, then tell her the truth  unhesitatingly, for in that case it will not stay hidden. If the  matter is still known to yourselves alone, let it continue so, but  then keep watch on the mail-bag, lest she learn of it unexpectedly.  The wet-nurse's sister here is unwilling to have it told to her. I  shall look her up today and speak with her. But if you do not wish to  keep it secret any longer, when once the child is rid of her cough,  you should at any rate look about you for a wet-nurse or woman who, in  case of necessity, can take Friederike's place immediately, if the  effect is such that the child cannot stay with her. I shall get the  sister to give me a letter to her, in which the story will be told  exactly and soothingly; this I shall send to you, so that you may make  use of it in case of need; that, I think, is the best way she can  learn of it. To tell her first that her child is sick, and so forth, I  do not consider a good plan, for anxiety has a worse effect than the  truth. God will graciously bring us out of this trouble. He holds us  with a short rein lest we should become self-confident, but He will  not let us fall. Good-by, my best-of-all; pray and keep your head up.    Your very faithful    v.B.      Berlin, August 11, '49.    _Mon Ange_,--I went to see the wet-nurse's kinsfolk, and there learned  that the _fiance_ had written to her last Wednesday and revealed all  to her; so the matter will go as God directs. If you chanced to  intercept the letter, and on receipt of this have not yet delivered  it, please delay it until my next arrives. I could not find the  _fiance_ himself, and directed him to come to me this evening, and  shall write you what I learn from him. If Friederike knows everything  already, my wishes will reach you too late; otherwise I should like,  if in accordance with medical opinion, not to have the wet-nurse sent  away altogether, but only relieved from service for a few hours or  days; if, however, there are scruples on that point, it can't be done,  of course. From my many doubts, you will see that I cannot decide the  matter very well at this distance. Act quite in accordance with the  advice of your mother and the other experienced friends. I give my  views, merely, not commands. * * * Be content with these lines for  today; be courageous and submissive to God's will, my darling; all  will surely go well. Cordial remembrances to the parents.    Your most faithful    v.B.      Berlin, Friday. (Postmark, August 17, '49.)    _Dearest Nanne_,-- * * * Your last letter, in which you inform me of  the happy solution of the wet-nurse difficulty, took a real load off  my heart; I thanked God for His mercy, and could almost have got drunk  from pure gayety. May His protection extend henceforward, too, over  you and the little darling. I am living with Hans here at the corner  of Taubenstrasse, three rooms and one alcove, quite elegant, but  narrow little holes; Hans' bed full of bugs, but mine not as yet--I  seem not to be to their taste. We pay twenty-five rix-dollars a month,  together. If there were one additional small room, and not two flights  of stairs, I could live with you here, and Hans could get another  apartment below in this house. But, as it is, it would be too cramped  for us. I have talked with the _fiance_ of the wet-nurse, a  modest-looking person. He spoke of her with love, and declared in  reply to my question that he certainly is willing to marry her. What  he wrote about the \"white pestilence\" is nonsense; no such sickness  exists, least of all in Berlin. The cholera is fast disappearing. I  have not heard a word more about it since I came here; one sees it  only in newspaper reports. Isn't our mammy jealous because, according  to the paper, I have been in company with \"strikingly handsome\"  Englishwomen? Lady Jersey was really something uncommon, such as is  usually seen only in _keepsakes_. I would have paid a rix-dollar  admission if she had been exhibited for money. She is now in Vienna.  For the rest, I have not had a letter from you this long time; my last  news comes from Bernhard, who left you a week ago today. God has  upheld you meantime, I trust, my angel. It is possible that a letter  from you is here. The delivery is always rather irregular: sometimes  the letter-carrier brings them, sometimes they are delivered at the  Chamber postal station. I will go immediately and inquire if anything  is there; then I will take a bath, and return at least ten calls that  have been paid me. It is a misery that now the people always receive  one--one loses a terrible amount of time at it.... Hans is still  inclined to treat me tyrannically, but I resist, and have been so far  successful that I sleep as long as I please, whereat the coffee grows  cold, however, as he is obstinately bent on not breakfasting alone.  So, too, he will not go to bed if I do not go at the same time, but  sleeps, just like my little Nanne, on the sofa.... Now, good-by"]]]
