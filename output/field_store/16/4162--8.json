Be sure that the wood extends out to both ends of the  fire-box. Replace the covers, and if the stove needs blacking, mix the  polish, and apply it, rubbing with a dry brush until nearly dry, then  light the fuel, as a little heat will facilitate the polishing. When the  wood is burning briskly, place a shovelful or two of rather small pieces  of coal upon the wood, and, as they ignite, gradually add more, until  there is a clear, bright body of fire, remembering, however, never to  fill the stove above the fire bricks; then partly close the direct  draft. When wood or soft coal is used, the fuel may be added at the same  time with the kindling.    CARE OF FIRES.--Much fuel is wasted through the loss of heat from  too much draft. Only just enough air should be supplied to promote  combustion. A coal fire, when well kindled, needs only air enough to  keep it burning. When the coal becomes red all through, it has parted  with the most of its heat, and the fire will soon die unless  replenished. To keep a steady fire, add but a small amount of fuel at a  time, and repeat often enough to prevent any sensible decrease of the  degree of heat. Rake the fire from the bottom, and keep it clear of  ashes and cinders. If a very hot fire is needed, open the drafts; at  other times, keep them closed, or partially so, and not waste fuel.  There is no economy in allowing a fire to get low before fuel is added;  for the fresh fuel cools the fire to a temperature so low that it is not  useful, and thus occasions a direct waste of all fuel necessary to again  raise the heat to the proper degree, to say nothing of the waste of time  and patience. The addition of small quantities of fuel at short  intervals so long as continuous heat is needed, is far better than to  let the fuel burn nearly out, and then add a larger quantity. The  improper management of the drafts and dampers has also much to do with  waste of fuel. As stoves are generally constructed, it is necessary for  the heat to pass over the top, down the back, and under the bottom of  the oven before escaping into the flue, in order to properly heat the  oven for baking. In order to force the heat to make this circuit, the  direct draft of the stove needs to be closed. With this precaution  observed, a quick fire from a small amount of fuel, used before its  force is spent, will produce better results than a fire-box full under  other circumstances.    An item of economy for those who are large users of coal, is the careful  sifting of the cinders from the ashes. They can be used to good  advantage to put first upon the kindlings, when building the fire, as  they ignite more readily than fresh coal, and give a greater, quicker  heat, although much less enduring.    METHODS OF COOKING.--A proper source of heat having been secured,  the next step is to apply it to the food in some manner. The principal  methods commonly employed are roasting, broiling, baking, boiling,  stewing, simmering, steaming, and frying.    _Roasting_ is cooking food in its own juices before an open fire. A  clear fire with intense heat is necessary.    _Broiling_, or _grilling_, is cooking by radiant heat over glowing  coals. This method is only adapted to thin pieces of food with a  considerable amount of surface. Larger and more compact foods should be  roasted or baked. Roasting and broiling are allied in principle. In  both, the work is chiefly done by the radiation of heat directly upon  the surface of the food, although some heat is communicated by the hot  air surrounding the food. The intense heat applied to the food soon  sears its outer surfaces, and thus prevents the escape of its juices. If  care be taken frequently to turn the food so that its entire surface  will be thus acted upon, the interior of the mass is cooked by its own  juices.    _Baking_ is the cooking of food by dry heat in a closed oven. Only foods  containing a considerable degree of moisture are adapted for cooking by  this method. The hot, dry air which fills the oven is always thirsting  for moisture, and will take from every moist substance to which it has  access a quantity of water proportionate to its degree of heat. Foods  containing but a small amount of moisture, unless protected in some  manner from the action of the heated air, or in some way supplied with  moisture during the cooking process, come from the oven dry, hard, and  unpalatable.    Proper cooking by this method depends greatly upon the facility with  which the heat of the oven can be regulated. When oil or gas is the fuel  used, it is an easy matter to secure and maintain almost any degree of  heat desirable, but with a wood or coal stove, especial care and  painstaking are necessary.    It is of the first importance that the mechanism of the oven to be used,  be thoroughly understood by the cook, and she should test its heating  capacity under various conditions, with a light, quick fire and with a  more steady one; she should carefully note the kind and amount of fuel  requisite to produce a certain degree of heat; in short, she should  thoroughly know her \"machine\" and its capabilities before attempting to  use it for the cooking of food. An oven thermometer is of the utmost  value for testing the heat, but unfortunately, such thermometers are not  common. They are obtainable in England, although quite expensive. It is  also possible at the present time to obtain ranges with a very reliable  thermometer attachment to the oven door.    [Illustration: An Oven Thermometer]    A cook of good judgment by careful observation and comparison of  results, can soon learn to form quite a correct idea of the heat of her  oven by the length of time she can hold her hand inside it without  discomfort, but since much depends upon the construction of stoves and  the kind of fuel used, and since the degree of heat bearable will vary  with every hand that tries it, each person who depends upon this test  must make her own standard. When the heat of the oven is found to be too  great, it may be lessened by placing in it a dish of cold water.    _Boiling_ is the cooking of food in a boiling liquid. Water is the usual  medium employed for this purpose. When water is heated, as its  temperature is increased, minute bubbles of air which have been  dissolved by it are given off. As the temperature rises, bubbles of  steam will begin to form at the bottom of the vessel. At first these  will be condensed as they rise into the cooler water above, causing a  simmering sound; but as the heat increases, the bubbles will rise higher  and higher before collapsing, and in a short time will pass entirely  through the water, escaping from its surface, causing more or less  agitation, according to the rapidity with which they are formed. Water  boils when the bubbles thus rise to the surface, and steam is thrown  off. If the temperature is now tested, it will be found to be about  212 deg. F. When water begins to boil, it is impossible to increase its  temperature, as the steam carries off the heat as rapidly as it is  communicated to the water. The only way in which the temperature can be  raised, is by the confinement of the steam; but owing to its enormous  expansive force, this is not practicable with ordinary cooking utensils.  The mechanical action of the water is increased by rapid bubbling, but  not the heat; and to boil anything violently does not expedite the  cooking process, save that by the mechanical action of the water the  food is broken into smaller pieces, which are for this reason more  readily softened. But violent boiling occasions an enormous waste of  fuel, and by driving away in the steam the volatile and savory elements  of the food, renders it much less palatable, if not altogether  tasteless. The solvent properties of water are so increased by heat that  it permeates the food, rendering its hard and tough constituents soft  and easy of digestion.    The liquids mostly employed in the cooking of foods are water and milk.  Water is best suited for the cooking of most foods, but for such  farinaceous foods as rice, macaroni, and farina, milk, or at least part  milk, is preferable, as it adds to their nutritive value. In using milk  for cooking purposes, it should be remembered that being more dense than  water, when heated, less steam escapes, and consequently it boils sooner  than does water. Then, too, milk being more dense, when it is used alone  for cooking, a little larger quantity of fluid will be required than  when water is used.    The boiling point for water at the sea level is 212 deg. At all points  above the sea level, water boils at a temperature below 212 deg., the exact  temperature depending upon the altitude. At the top of Mt. Blanc, an  altitude of 15,000 feet, water boils at 185 deg. The boiling point is  lowered one degree for every 600 feet increase in altitude. The boiling  point may be increased by adding soluble substances to the water. A  saturated solution of common baking soda boils at 220 deg. A saturated  solution of chloride of sodium boils at 227 deg. A similar solution of  sal-ammoniac boils at 238 deg. Of course such solutions cannot be used  advantageously, except as a means of cooking articles placed in  hermetically sealed vessels and immersed in the liquid.    Different effects upon food are produced by the use of hard and soft  water. Peas and beans boiled in hard water containing lime or gypsum,  will not become tender, because these chemical substances harden  vegetable casein, of which element peas and beans are largely composed.  For extracting the juices of meat and the soluble parts of other foods,  soft water is best, as it more readily penetrates the tissue; but when  it is desired to preserve the articles whole, and retain their juices  and flavors, hard water is preferable.    Foods should be put to cook in cold or boiling water, in accordance"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12242"],[0,"Poems (#12)"],[1,"Mr. Thomson's sheaves.    Still is the bustle in the brook,  Sealed are the spicy valves;  Mesmeric fingers softly touch  The eyes of many elves.    Perhaps a squirrel may remain,  My sentiments to share.  Grant me, O Lord, a sunny mind,  Thy windy will to bear!            L.    THE SNOW.    It sifts from leaden sieves,  It powders all the wood,  It fills with alabaster wool  The wrinkles of the road.    It makes an even face  Of mountain and of plain, --  Unbroken forehead from the east  Unto the east again.    It reaches to the fence,  It wraps it, rail by rail,  Till it is lost in fleeces;  It flings a crystal veil    On stump and stack and stem, --  The summer's empty room,  Acres of seams where harvests were,  Recordless, but for them.    It ruffles wrists of posts,  As ankles of a queen, --  Then stills its artisans like ghosts,  Denying they have been.            LI.    THE BLUE JAY.    No brigadier throughout the year  So civic as the jay.  A neighbor and a warrior too,  With shrill felicity    Pursuing winds that censure us  A February day,  The brother of the universe  Was never blown away.    The snow and he are intimate;  I 've often seen them play  When heaven looked upon us all  With such severity,    I felt apology were due  To an insulted sky,  Whose pompous frown was nutriment  To their temerity.    The pillow of this daring head  Is pungent evergreens;  His larder -- terse and militant --  Unknown, refreshing things;    His character a tonic,  His future a dispute;  Unfair an immortality  That leaves this neighbor out.              IV. TIME AND ETERNITY.      I.    Let down the bars, O Death!  The tired flocks come in  Whose bleating ceases to repeat,  Whose wandering is done.    Thine is the stillest night,  Thine the securest fold;  Too near thou art for seeking thee,  Too tender to be told.            II.    Going to heaven!  I don't know when,  Pray do not ask me how, --  Indeed, I 'm too astonished  To think of answering you!  Going to heaven! --  How dim it sounds!  And yet it will be done  As sure as flocks go home at night  Unto the shepherd's arm!    Perhaps you 're going too!  Who knows?  If you should get there first,  Save just a little place for me  Close to the two I lost!    The smallest \"robe\" will fit me,  And just a bit of \"crown;\"  For you know we do not mind our dress  When we are going home.    I 'm glad I don't believe it,  For it would stop my breath,  And I 'd like to look a little more  At such a curious earth!  I am glad they did believe it  Whom I have never found  Since the mighty autumn afternoon  I left them in the ground.            III.    At least to pray is left, is left.  O Jesus! in the air  I know not which thy chamber is, --  I 'm knocking everywhere.    Thou stirrest earthquake in the South,  And maelstrom in the sea;  Say, Jesus Christ of Nazareth,  Hast thou no arm for me?            IV.    EPITAPH.    Step lightly on this narrow spot!  The broadest land that grows  Is not so ample as the breast  These emerald seams enclose.    Step lofty; for this name is told  As far as cannon dwell,  Or flag subsist, or fame export  Her deathless syllable.            V.    Morns like these we parted;  Noons like these she rose,  Fluttering first, then firmer,  To her fair repose.    Never did she lisp it,  And 't was not for me;  She was mute from transport,  I, from agony!    Till the evening, nearing,  One the shutters drew --  Quick! a sharper rustling!  And this linnet flew!            VI.    A death-blow is a life-blow to some  Who, till they died, did not alive become;  Who, had they lived, had died, but when  They died, vitality begun.            VII.    I read my sentence steadily,  Reviewed it with my eyes,  To see that I made no mistake  In its extremest clause, --    The date, and manner of the shame;  And then the pious form  That \"God have mercy\" on the soul  The jury voted him.    I made my soul familiar  With her extremity,  That at the last it should not be  A novel agony,    But she and Death, acquainted,  Meet tranquilly as friends,  Salute and pass without a hint --  And there the matter ends.            VIII.    I have not told my garden yet,  Lest that should conquer me;  I have not quite the strength now  To break it to the bee.    I will not name it in the street,  For shops would stare, that I,  So shy, so very ignorant,  Should have the face to die.    The hillsides must not know it,  Where I have rambled so,  Nor tell the loving forests  The day that I shall go,    Nor lisp it at the table,  Nor heedless by the way  Hint that within the riddle  One will walk to-day!            IX.    THE BATTLE-FIELD.    They dropped like flakes, they dropped like stars,     Like petals from a rose,  When suddenly across the June     A wind with fingers goes.    They perished in the seamless grass, --     No eye could find the place;  But God on his repealless list     Can summon every face.            X.    The only ghost I ever saw  Was dressed in mechlin, -- so;  He wore no sandal on his foot,  And stepped like flakes of snow.  His gait was soundless, like the bird,  But rapid, like the roe;  His fashions quaint, mosaic,  Or, haply, mistletoe.    His conversation seldom,  His laughter like the breeze  That dies away in dimples  Among the pensive trees.  Our interview was transient,--  Of me, himself was shy;  And God forbid I look behind  Since that appalling day!            XI.    Some, too fragile for winter winds,  The thoughtful grave encloses, --  Tenderly tucking them in from frost  Before their feet are cold.    Never the treasures in her nest  The cautious grave exposes,  Building where schoolboy dare not look  And sportsman is not bold.    This covert have all the children  Early aged, and often cold, --  Sparrows unnoticed by the Father;  Lambs for whom time had not a fold.            XII.    As by the dead we love to sit,  Become so wondrous dear,  As for the lost we grapple,  Though all the rest are here, --    In broken mathematics  We estimate our prize,  Vast, in its fading ratio,  To our penurious eyes!            XIII.    MEMORIALS.    Death sets a thing significant  The eye had hurried by,  Except a perished creature  Entreat us tenderly    To ponder little workmanships  In crayon or in wool,  With \"This was last her fingers did,\"  Industrious until    The thimble weighed too heavy,  The stitches stopped themselves,  And then 't was put among the dust  Upon the closet shelves.    A book I have, a friend gave,  Whose pencil, here and there,  Had notched the place that pleased him, --  At rest his fingers are.    Now, when I read, I read not,  For interrupting tears  Obliterate the etchings  Too costly for repairs.            XIV.    I went to heaven, --  'T was a small town,  Lit with a ruby,  Lathed with down.  Stiller than the fields  At the full dew,  Beautiful as pictures  No man drew.  People like the moth,  Of mechlin, frames,  Duties of gossamer,  And eider names.  Almost contented  I could be  'Mong such unique  Society.            XV.    Their height in heaven comforts not,  Their glory nought to me;  'T was best imperfect, as it was;  I 'm finite, I can't see.    The house of supposition,  The glimmering frontier  That skirts the acres of perhaps,  To me shows insecure.    The wealth I had contented me;  If 't was a meaner size,  Then I had counted it until  It pleased my narrow eyes    Better than larger values,  However true their show;  This timid life of evidence  Keeps pleading, \"I don't know.\"            XVI.    There is a shame of nobleness  Confronting sudden pelf, --  A finer shame of ecstasy  Convicted of itself.    A best disgrace a brave man feels,  Acknowledged of the brave, --  One more \"Ye Blessed\" to be told;  But this involves the grave.            XVII.    TRIUMPH.    Triumph may be of several kinds.  There 's triumph in the room  When that old imperator, Death,  By faith is overcome.    There 's triumph of the finer mind  When truth, affronted long,  Advances calm to her supreme,  Her God her only throng.    A triumph when temptation's bribe  Is slowly handed back,  One eye upon the heaven renounced  And one upon the rack.    Severer triumph, by himself  Experienced, who can pass  Acquitted from that naked bar,  Jehovah's countenance!            XVIII.    Pompless no life can pass away;      The lowliest career  To the same pageant wends its way      As that exalted here.  How cordial is the mystery!      The hospitable pall  A \"this way\" beckons spaciously, --      A miracle for all!            XIX.    I noticed people disappeared,  When but a little child, --  Supposed they visited remote,  Or settled regions wild.    Now know I they both visited  And settled regions wild,  But did because they died, -- a fact  Withheld the little child!            XX.    FOLLOWING.    I had no cause to be awake,  My best was gone to sleep,  And morn a new politeness took,  And failed to wake them up,    But called the others clear,  And passed their curtains by.  Sweet morning, when I over-sleep,  Knock, recollect, for me!    I looked at sunrise once,  And then I looked at them,  And wishfulness in me arose  For circumstance the same.    'T was such an ample peace,  It could not hold a sigh, --  'T was Sabbath with the bells divorced,  'T was sunset all the day.    So choosing but a gown  And taking but a prayer,  The only raiment I should need,  I struggled, and was there.            XXI.    If anybody's friend be dead,  It 's sharpest of the theme  The thinking how they walked alive,  At such and such a time.    Their costume, of a Sunday,  Some manner of the hair, --  A prank nobody knew but them,  Lost, in the sepulchre.    How warm they were on such a day:  You almost feel the date,  So short way off it seems; and now,  They 're centuries from that.    How pleased they were at what you said;  You try to touch the smile,  And dip your fingers in the frost:  When was it, can you tell,    You asked the company to tea,  "]]]
