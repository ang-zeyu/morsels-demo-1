Oh, dear me, things are getting so  mixed up!\"    \"Polly, you won't leave me, will you, till I get able to sit up?\" cried  Mrs. Whitney one day, a week after.    \"No, Aunty, indeed I won't,\" declared Polly, leaning over to drop a kiss  on the soft hair against the pillows.    Mrs. Whitney put up her hands to draw down the young face.    \"Oh, Aunty!\" exclaimed Polly in dismay, \"be careful; you know doctor  said you mustn't raise your arms.\"    \"Well, just let me kiss you, dear, then,\" said Mrs. Whitney with a wan  little smile. \"Oh, Polly,\" when the kiss and two or three others had  been dropped on the rosy cheek, \"you are sure you can stay with me?\"    \"I'm sure I can, and I will,\" said Polly firmly. \"Oh, Aunty, I shall be  so glad to be with you; you can't think how glad.\"    She softly patted the pillows into the position Mrs. Whitney best liked,  and then stood off a bit and beamed at her.    \"It's dreadfully selfish in me to keep you,\" said Mrs. Whitney, \"when  you love your work so; and what will the music scholars do, Polly?\"    \"Oh, they are all right,\" said Polly gaily, \"they're working like  beavers. Indeed, Aunty, I believe they'll practice a great deal more  than if I were home to be talking to them all the while.\"    \"You are a dear blessed comfort, Polly,\" said Mrs. Whitney, turning on  her pillow with a sigh of relief. \"Now I do believe I shall get up very  soon. But Jasper must go back; it won't do for him to stay away any  longer from his business. Promise me, Polly, that you will make him see  that he ought to go.\"    \"I'll try, Aunty,\" said Polly, \"and now that you are so much better,  why, I do believe that Jasper will be willing to go.\"    \"Oh, do make him,\" begged Mrs. Whitney, and then she tucked her hand  under her cheek, and the first thing Polly knew she heard the slow,  regular breathing that told she was asleep.    \"Now that's just lovely,\" cried Polly softly, \"and I will run and speak  to Jasper this very minute, for he really ought to go back to his  business.\"    But instead of doing this, she met a young girl, as she was running  through the hall, who stopped her and asked, \"Can I see Mr. King?\"    \"What!\" cried Polly, astonished that the domestics had admitted any one,  as it was against the orders.    \"Oh, I am a relation,\" said the girl coolly, \"and I told the man at the  door that I should come in; and he said then I must wait, for I could  not see Mr. King now, and he put me up in that little reception room,  but I just walked out to meet the first person coming in the hall. Will  you be so kind as to arrange it?\"    She looked as if she fully expected to have her wish fulfilled, and her  gaze wandered confidently around the picture-hung wall, until such time  as Polly could answer.    \"I'll see,\" said Polly, who couldn't help smiling, \"what I can do for  you; but you mustn't be disappointed if Grandpapa doesn't feel able to  see you. He is very much occupied, you know, with his daughter's ill\"--    \"Oh, I understand,\" said the other girl, guilty of interrupting, \"but he  will see me, I know,\" and her light blue eyes were as calm as ever.    \"Who shall I tell him wants to see him?\" asked Polly, her own eyes wide  at the stranger and her ways.    \"Oh, you needn't tell him any name,\" said the girl carelessly.    \"Then I certainly shall not tell him you wish to see him, unless I carry  your name to him,\" Polly said quite firmly, and she looked steadily into  the fair face before her.    \"Oh, dear me,\" said the girl; \"well, you may say I am Mr. Alexander  Chatterton's daughter Charlotte.\"    Polly kept herself from starting as the name met her ear. \"Very well,\"  she said, \"I will do what I can,\" moving off. \"O, Grandpapa!\"    For down the hall came Mr. King in velvet morning jacket and cap.    \"Hoity-toity, I thought no one was to be admitted,\" he exclaimed, as he  neared the door.    \"Grandpapa,\" Polly endeavored to draw him off, but the young girl ran  past her.    \"Mr. King,\" she said quickly, \"I am Charlotte Chatterton.\"    \"The dickens you are!\" exclaimed the old gentleman, looking her full in  the face.    \"Yes, sir; and my father is very ill.\" For a moment her voice trembled,  but she quickly recovered herself. \"It isn't money I want, Mr. King,\"  and she threw her head back proudly, \"but oh, will you come and see  father?\"    Mr. King looked at her again, then over at Polly. \"Bring her in here,\"  he said, pointing to the same little reception room that Charlotte had  deserted, \"I want you to stay, too, Polly,\" and the door closed upon  them.          CHAPTER VI.    OF MANY THINGS.      \"And father has asked her to go home when you and he go!\" cried Jasper in  irritation.    \"Yes,\" said Polly; \"oh, Jasper, never mind; I daresay it will be for the  best; and I'm so sorry for Charlotte.\"    \"She'll be no end of bother to you, I know,\" said Jasper. \"And you must  take her everywhere, Polly, and look out for her. What was father  thinking of?\" He could not conceal his annoyance, and Polly put aside  her own dismayed feelings at the new programme, to help him into his  usual serene mood.    \"But think, Jasper, how she has never had any fun all her life, and now  her father is sick.\"    \"She'd much better stay and take care of him,\" declared Jasper.    \"But he's sick because he has worried so, I do believe,\" Polly went on,  \"for you ought to have seen his face when we took Charlotte home, and  Grandpapa talked with him, and asked him to let Charlotte pass the rest  of the winter with us. Oh, I am glad, Jasper, for I do like Charlotte.\"    \"The girl may be well enough,\" said Jasper shortly, \"but she will bother  you, nevertheless, Polly, I am afraid.\"    \"Never mind,\" said Polly brightly, with a little pang at her heart for  the nice times with the girls that now must be shared with another.  \"Grandpapa thought he ought to do it, I suppose, and that's enough.\"    \"It does seem as if the Chattertons would never be done annoying us,\"  said Jasper gloomily. \"Now when we once get this girl fastened on us,  there'll be an end to the hope of shaking her off.\"    \"Perhaps we sha'n't want to,\" said Polly merrily, \"for Charlotte may  turn out perfectly lovely; I do believe she's going to.\" And then she  remembered her promise to Mrs. Whitney, and she began: \"Aunty is  worrying about your staying away so long from your business, Jasper, and  she wants you to go back.\"    A shade passed over his face. \"I suppose I ought to go, Polly,\" he said,  and he pulled a letter from his pocket and held it out to her, \"I was  going to show this to you, only the other matter came up.\"    Polly seized it with dread.    \"We need your services very much\" [the letter ran] \"and cannot wait  longer for your return. We are very sorry to be so imperative, but the  rush of work at this time of the year, makes it necessary for all our  force to be in place.    \"Very sincerely    \"DAVID MARLOWE.\"    \"You see they are getting all the books planned out, and put in shape  for the next year; and business just rushes,\" cried Jasper, with shining  eyes, showing his eagerness to be in the midst of the bustle of  manufacture.    \"What, so early!\" cried Polly, letting the letter drop. \"Why, I thought  you didn't do anything until spring, Jasper--about making the books, I  mean.\"    He laughed. \"The travelers go out on the road then,\" he said, \"with  almost all the books ready to sell.\"    \"Out on the road?\" repeated Polly in amaze. \"Oh, what do you mean,  Jasper?\"    \"Well, you see the business of selling is a good part of it done by  salesmen, who travel with samples and take advance orders,\" said Jasper,  finding it quite jolly to explain business intricacies to such an eager  listener.    \"Oh!\" said Polly.    \"And when I get back I shall be plunged at once into all the thick of  the manufacturing work,\" he went on, straightening himself up; \"Mr.  Marlowe is as good as he can be, and he has waited now longer than he  ought to.\"    \"Oh, you must go, Jasper,\" cried Polly quickly; \"at once, this very  day,\" and her face glowed.    \"If you think sister Marian is really well enough to spare me,\" he said,  trying to restrain his impatience to be off.    \"Yes--yes, I do,\" declared Polly. \"Doctor Palfrey said this morning that  all danger was over now from inflammation, and really it worries her  dreadfully to think of your being here any longer. It really does hurt  her, Jasper,\" repeated Polly emphatically.    \"In that case I'm off, then, this afternoon,\" said Jasper, with a glad  ring in his voice. \"Polly, my work is the very grandest in all the  world.\"    \"Isn't it?\" cried Polly, with kindling eyes; \"just think--to make good  books, Jasper, that will never stop, perhaps, being read. Oh, I wish I  was a man and could help you.\"    \"Polly?\" he stopped a minute, looked down into her"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7499"],[0,"Through Five Republics on Horseback, Being an Account of Many Wanderings in (#11)"],[1,"   What shall I say of the domestic life of these people? Unfortunately,  marriage is practically unknown among them. The father gives his son a  few cattle, and the young man, after building himself a house, conducts  thither his chosen one. Unhappily, constancy in either man or woman is  a rare virtue.    Of the superstitious side of the Gancho race I might speak much. In the  saints the female especially implicitly believes. These, her deities,  are all-powerful, and to them she appeals for the satisfaction of her  every desire. Saint Clementina's help is sought by the girl when her  lover betrays her. Another saint will aid her in poisoning him. If the  wife thinks her husband long in bringing the evening meal, she has  informed me, a word with Saint Anthony is sufficient, and she hears the  sound of his horse's hoofs. Saint Anthony seems to be useful on many  occasions of distress. One evening I called at a _rancho_ made of dry  thistle-stalks bound together with hide and thatched with reeds,  Finding the inmates very hospitable, I stayed there two or three hours  to rest. Coming out of the house again, I found to my dismay that  during our animated gossip my horse had broken loose and left me. Now  the loss of a horse is too trivial a matter to interest Anthony the  saint, but a horse having saddle and bridle attached to him makes it  quite a different matter, for these often cost ten times the price of  the horse. One of the saint's especial duties is to find a lost saddled  horse, if the owner or interested one only promises to burn a candle in  his honor. The night was very dark, and no sign of the animal was to be  seen. Mine host laid his ear to the ground and listened, then, leaping  on his horse, he galloped into the darkness, from whence he brought my  lost animal. I did not learn until afterwards that Mrs. Jesus, for such  was the woman's name, had sought the help of Saint Anthony on my  behalf. I am sure she lost her previous good opinion of me when I  thanked her husband but did not offer a special colored candle to her  saint.    Among these strange people I commenced a school, and had the joy of  teaching numbers of them to read the Spanish Bible. Boys and girls came  long distances on horseback, and, although some of them had perhaps  never seen a book before, I found them exceedingly quick to learn. In  four or five months the older ones were able to read any ordinary  chapter. In arithmetic they were inconceivably dull, and after three  months' tuition some of them could not count ten.    I have said the saints are greatly honored among these people. My  Christmas cards generally found their way to adorn their altars. Every  house has its favorite, and some of these are regarded as especially  clever in curing sickness. It being a very unhealthful, low-lying  district where my school was, I contracted malarial fever, and went to  bed very sick. Every day some of the children would come to enquire  after me, but Celestino, one of the larger boys, came one morning with  a very special message from his mother. This communication was to the  effect that they did not wish the school-teacher to die, he being  \"rather a nice kind of a man and well liked.\" Because of this she would  be pleased to let me have her favorite saint. This image I could stand  at the head of my bed, and its very presence would cure me. When I  refused this offer and smiled at its absurdity, the boy thought me very  strange. To be so wise in some respects, and yet so ignorant as to  refuse such a chance, was to him incomprehensible. The saints, I found,  are there often lent out to friends that they may exercise their  healing powers, or rented out to strangers at so much a day, When they  are not thus on duty, but in a quiet corner of the hut, they get  lonely. The woman will then go for a visit, taking her saint with her,  either in her arms or tied to the saddle. This image she will place  with the saint her host owns, and _they will talk together and teach  one another_. A saint is supposed to know only its own particular work,  although one named Santa Rita is said to be a worker of  impossibilities. Some of them are only very rudely carved images,  dressed in tawdry finery. I have sometimes thought that a Parisian doll  of modern make, able to open and close its eyes, etc., would in their  esteem be even competent to raise the dead! [Footnote: Writing of  Spanish American Romanism, Everybody's Magazine says: \"To the student  of human nature, which means the study of evil as well as good, this  religious body is of absorbing interest. One would look to find these  enthusiasts righteous and virtuous in their daily life; but, apart from  the annual week of penance, their religion influences them not at all,  and on the whole the members of the Brotherhood constitute a desperate  class, dangerous to society.\"]    In cases of sickness very simple remedies are used, and not a few  utterly nonsensical. To cure pains in the stomach they tie around them  the skin of the _comadreka_, a small, vile-smelling animal. This they  told me was a sovereign remedy. If the sufferer be a babe, a cross made  on its stomach is sufficient to perfectly cure it. I have seen seven  pieces of the root of the white lily, which there grows wild, tied  around the neck of an infant in order that its teeth might come with  greater promptitude and less pain. A string of dog's teeth serves the  same purpose. To cure a bad wound, the priest will be called in that he  may write around the sore some Latin prayer backwards. Headache is  easily cured by tying around the head the cast-off skin of a snake. Two  puppies are killed and bound one on each side of a broken limb. If a  charm is worn around the neck no poison can be harmful. For a sore  throat it is sufficient to expectorate in the fire three times, making  a cross. Lockjaw is effectually stopped by tying around the sufferer's  jaws the strings from a virgin's skirt; and they say also that powdered  excrement of a dog, taken in a glass of water, cures the smallpox  patient,    As Mrs. Jesus sent her boy to my school, so Mrs. Flower sent her girl.  The latter was perhaps the most deluded woman I have met. Her every act  was bad in itself or characterized by superstitious devotion. She was  one of the Church's favorite worshippers, and while I was in the  neighborhood she sold her cows and horses and presented the priest at  the nearest town with a large and expensive silver cross--the emblem of  suffering purity. Near her lived a person for whom she had an especial  aversion, but that enemy she got rid of in surely the strangest of  ways, which she described to me. Catching a snake, and holding it so  that its poison might not reach her, she passed a threaded needle  through both its eyes. When this was done she let it go again, alive,  and, carefully guarding the needle, approached the person from behind  and made a cross with the thread. The undesired one disappeared, having  probably heard of the enchantment, and being equally superstitious,  or--the charm worked!    Mrs. Flower was a most repulsive-looking creature. Her skin was exactly  the color of an old copper coin. She did not resemble any _flower_ I  have seen in either hemisphere. Far was she from being a rose, but she  certainly possessed the thorn. Her love for the saints was most marked,  and I have known her promise St. Roque that she would walk six miles  carrying his image if he would only grant her a certain prayer. This  petition he granted, and off she trudged with her divine (?) load.  Those acquainted with dwellers on the prairie know that this was indeed  a great task, horses being so cheap and riding so universal. Mrs.  Flower was unaccustomed to walk even the shortest distance. I myself  can bear witness to the fact that even strong men find it hard to walk  a mile after spending years in equestrian travel. The native tells you  that God formed your legs so that you might be able to sit on a horse  rather than to walk with them. A favorite expression with them is, \"I  was born on horseback.\"    Stone not being found on the pampas, these people generally build their  houses of square sods, with a roof of plaited grasses--sometimes I have  observed these beautifully woven together. Two or more holes, according  to the size of the house, are left to serve for door and window. Wood  cannot be obtained, glass has not been introduced, so the holes are  left as open spaces, across which, when the pampa wind blows, a hide is  stretched. No hole is left in the roof for the smoke of the fire to  escape, for this to the native is no inconvenience whatever. When I  have been compelled to fly with racking cough and splitting head, he  has calmly asked the reason. Never could I bear the blinding smoke that  issues from his fire of sheep or cow dung burning on the earthen floor,  though he heeds it not as, sitting on a bullock's skull, he ravenously  eats his evening meal.    If entertaining a stranger, he will press uncut joint after joint of  his _asado_ upon him. This asado is meat roasted over the fire on a  spit; if beef, with the skin and hair still attached. Meat cooked in  this way is a real delicacy. A favorite dish with them (I held a  different opinion) is a half-formed calf, taken before its proper time  of birth. The meat is often dipped in the ashes in lieu of salt. I have  said the Gaucho has no chair. I might add that neither has he a table,  for with his fingers and knife he eats the meat off the fire. Forks he  is without, and a horn or shell spoon conveys the soup to his mouth  direct from the copper pan. So universal is the use of the shell for  this service that the native does not speak of it as _caracol_, the  real word for shell, but calls it _cuchara del agua_, or water spoon.  Of knives he possesses more than enough, and heavy, long, sharp-pointed  ones they are. When his hunger is appeased the knife goes, not "]]]
