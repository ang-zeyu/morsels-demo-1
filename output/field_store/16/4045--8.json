[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8743"],[0,"Mary Schweidler, the amber witch (#11)"],[1,"  PROPOSED TO MY DAUGHTER    The Lord blessed my parish wonderfully this winter, inasmuch as not only a  great quantity of fish were caught and sold in all the villages, but in  Coserow they even killed four seals: _item_, the great storm of the 12th  of December threw a goodly quantity of amber on the shore, so that many  found amber, although no very large pieces, and they began to buy cows and  sheep from Liepe and other places, as I myself also bought two cows;  _item_, my grain which I had sown, half on my own field and half on old  Paasch's, sprang up bravely and gladly, as the Lord had till _datum_  bestowed on us an open winter; but so soon as it had shot up a finger's  length, we found it one morning again torn up and ruined, and this time  also by the devil's doings, since now, as before, not the smallest trace  of oxen or of horses was to be seen in the field. May the righteous God,  however, reward it, as indeed he already has done. Amen.    Meanwhile, however, something uncommon happened. For one morning, as I  have heard, when Lord Wittich saw out of the window that the daughter of  his fisherman, a child of sixteen, whom he had diligently pursued, went  into the coppice to gather dry sticks, he went thither too; wherefore, I  will not say, but every one may guess for himself. When he had gone some  way along the convent mound, and was come to the first bridge, where the  mountain-ash stands, he saw two wolves coming towards him; and as he had  no weapon with him, save a staff, he climbed up into a tree; whereupon the  wolves trotted round it, blinked at him with their eyes, licked their  lips, and at last jumped with their fore-paws up against the tree,  snapping at him; he then saw that one was a he-wolf, a great fat brute  with only one eye. Hereupon in his fright he began to scream, and the  long-suffering of God was again shown to him, without, however, making him  wiser; for the maiden, who had crept behind a juniper-bush in the field  when she saw the Sheriff coming, ran back again to the castle and called  together a number of people, who came and drove away the wolves, and  rescued his lordship. He then ordered a great wolf-hunt to be held next  day in the convent wood, and he who brought the one-eyed monster, dead or  alive, was to have a barrel of beer for his pains. Still they could not  catch him, albeit they that day took four wolves in their nets, and killed  them. He therefore straightway ordered a wolf-hunt to be held in my  parish. But when the fellow came to toll the bell for a wolf-hunt, he did  not stop a while, as is the wont for wolf-hunts, but loudly rang the bell  on, _sine mora_, so that all the folk thought a fire had broken out, and  ran screaming out of their houses. My child also came running out (I  myself had driven to visit a sick person at Zempin, seeing that walking  began to be wearisome to me, and that I could now afford to be more at  mine ease); but she had not stood long, and was asking the reason of the  ringing, when the Sheriff himself, on his grey charger, with three  cart-loads of toils and nets following him, galloped up and ordered the  people straightway to go into the forest and to drive the wolves with  rattles. Hereupon he, with his hunters and a few men whom he had picked  out of the crowd, were to ride on and spread the nets behind Damerow,  seeing that the island is wondrous narrow there, and the wolf dreads the  water. When he saw my daughter he turned his horse round, chucked her  under the chin, and graciously asked her who she was, and whence she came?  When he had heard it, he said she was as fair as an angel, and that he had  not known till now that the parson here had so beauteous a girl. He then  rode off, looking round at her two or three times. At the first beating  they found the one-eyed wolf, who lay in the rushes near the water. Hereat  his lordship rejoiced greatly, and made the grooms drag him out of the net  with long iron hooks, and hold him there for near an hour, while my lord  slowly and cruelly tortured him to death, laughing heartily the while,  which is a _prognosticon_ of what he afterwards did with my poor child,  for wolf or lamb is all one to this villain. Just God! But I will not be  beforehand with my tale.    Next day came old Seden his squint-eyed wife, limping like a lame dog, and  put it to my daughter whether she would not go into the service of the  Sheriff; praised him as a good and pious man; and vowed that all the world  said of him were foul lies, as she herself could bear witness, seeing that  she had lived in his service for above ten years. _Item_, she praised the  good cheer they had there, and the handsome beer-money that the great  lords who often lay there gave the servants which waited upon them; that  she herself had more than once received a rose-noble from his Princely  Highness Duke Ernest Ludewig; moreover, many pretty fellows came there,  which might make her fortune, inasmuch as she was a fair woman, and might  take her choice of a husband; whereas here in Coserow, where nobody ever  came, she might wait till she was old and ugly before she got a curch on  her head, etc. Hereat my daughter was beyond measure angered, and  answered, \"Ah! thou old witch, and who has told thee that I wish to go  into service to get a curch on my head? Go thy ways, and never enter the  house again, for I have nought to do with thee.\" Whereupon she walked away  again, muttering between her teeth.    Scarce had a few days passed, and I was standing in the chamber with the  glazier, who was putting in new windows, when I heard my daughter scream  in the kitchen. Whereupon I straightway ran in thither, and was shocked  and affrighted when I saw the Sheriff himself standing in the corner with  his arm round my child her neck; he, however, presently let her go, and  said: \"Aha, reverend Abraham, what a coy little fool you have for a  daughter! I wanted to greet her with a kiss, as I always use to do, and  she struggled and cried out as if I had been some young fellow who had  stolen in upon her, whereas I might be her father twice over.\" As I  answered nought, he went on to say that he had done it to encourage her,  seeing that he desired to take her into his service, as indeed I knew,  with more excuses of the same kind which I have forgot. Hereupon I pressed  him to come into the room, seeing that after all he was the ruler set over  me by God, and humbly asked what his lordship desired of me. Whereupon he  answered me graciously that it was true he had just cause for anger  against me, seeing that I had preached at him before the whole  congregation, but that he was ready to forgive me, and to have the  complaint he had sent in _contra me_ to his Princely Highness at Stettin,  and which might easily cost me my place, returned to him if I would but do  his will. And when I asked what his Lordship's will might be, and excused  myself as best I might with regard to the sermon, he answered that he  stood in great need of a faithful housekeeper whom he could set over the  other women-folk; and as he had learnt that my daughter was a faithful and  trustworthy person, he would that I should send her into his service. \"See  there,\" said he to her, and pinched her cheek the while, \"I want to lead  you to honour, though you are such a young creature, and yet you cry out  as if I were going to bring you to dishonour. Fie upon you!\" (My child  still remembers all this _verbotenus_; I myself should have forgot it a  hundred times over in all the wretchedness I since underwent.) But she was  offended at his words, and, jumping up from her seat, she answered  shortly, \"I thank your lordship for the honour, but will only keep house  for my papa, which is a better honour for me\"; whereupon he turned to me  and asked what I said to that. I must own that I was not a little  affrighted, inasmuch as I thought of the future and of the credit in which  the Sheriff stood with his Princely Highness. I therefore answered with  all humility that I could not force my child, and that I loved to have her  about me, seeing that my dear huswife had departed this life during the  heavy pestilence, and I had no child but only her. That I hoped therefore  his lordship would not be displeased with me that I could not send her  into his lordship's service. This angered him sore, and after disputing  some time longer in vain he took leave, not without threats that he would  make me pay for it. _Item_, my man, who was standing in the stable, heard  him say as he went round the corner, \"I will have her yet, in spite of  him!\"    I was already quite disheartened by all this, when, on the Sunday  following, there came his huntsman Johannes Kurt, a tall, handsome fellow,  and smartly dressed. He brought a roebuck tied before him on his horse,  and said that his lordship had sent it to me for a present, in hopes that  I would think better of his offer, seeing that he had been ever since  seeking on all sides for a housekeeper in vain. Moreover, that if I  changed my mind about it his lordship would speak for me to his Princely  Highness, so that the dotation of Duke Philippus Julius should be paid to  me out of the princely _aerarium_, etc. But the young fellow got the same  answer as his master had done, and I desired him to take the roebuck away  with him again. But this he refused to do; and as I had by chance told him  at first that game was my favourite meat, he promised to supply me with it  abundantly, seeing that there was plenty of game in the forest, and that  he often went a-hunting on the Streckelberg; moreover, that I (he meant my  daughter) pleased him uncommonly, the more because I would not do his  master's will, who, as he told me in confidence, would never leave any  girl in peace, and certainly would not let my damsel alone. Although I had  rejected his game, he brought it notwithstanding, and in the course of  three weeks he was sure"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8745"],[0,"Wulf the Saxon: A Story of the Norman Conquest (#11)"],[1,"when they heard they were both to  accompany Harold to Bosham, which was one of the favourite abodes  of the Earls of Wessex. It had originally been built as a hunting-seat,  but Godwin had grown to love the place, with its woods extending  for miles back and its quiet landlocked harbour, and additions had  been made until it had grown to be, in point of size at least, a  residence worthy of the great earls, and Harold preferred it to any  of the many mansions belonging to him. It was a large and gay party  that rode down the road through the quiet woods of Surrey and Sussex.  They put up each night at the houses of thanes, where, as notice  had been sent of their coming, they were royally entertained, and  those selected were proud to afford hospitality to the earl.    For a week they stayed at Bosham, hunting in the forests, going off  in parties under the guidance of the foresters, some who cared not  for hard labour, hunting in the woods between Bosham and the hills,  while others went far inland into the weald, which was for the most  part covered by a great forest, with but a few scattered hamlets  here and there. Smoke rising among the trees showed where the  charcoal-burners were at work, or where the furnaces were glowing,  converting the ore into the tough iron that furnished arms and  armour for the greater portion of the men of the south. At the end  of the week the earl announced to his guests that he had provided  a new diversion for them.    \"You see those three ships in the harbour,\" he said. \"They were  brought here last night, and three hundred men have been at work  all day preparing them for our reception. I propose that we all  embark with our dogs and servants, and sail along the coast, landing  where we please and taking our sport. As we sail eastward there  are abundant forests, and the game is far more plentiful than here,  and our trip will partake of the character of an adventure in thus  dropping upon unknown places. Tents have been stored on board the  vessels, with abundance of good cheer of all kinds, so that we can  establish ourselves where we will, and sleep on shore instead of  rocking uneasily on the waves.\"    The proposal was received with acclamation, and the following morning  the whole party embarked upon the three ships. The largest was  occupied by Harold himself, his brother and nephew, and six or seven  of his principal thanes. In this craft too went Wulf and Beorn with  their men. On issuing from the harbour the ships' heads were turned  to the east. The wind was light and fitful, the sails therefore  were not loosed, and they proceeded under oars. There was but little  tide until they reached the extremity of the long point of Selsea,  past which they were hurried at great speed by the rapid current.  Rowing closer inshore they got into quieter water, and continued  their way until tide turned, when they anchored, and landing with  their dogs hunted in the woods for some hours.    On their return to the sea-shore they found the tents erected and  supper prepared, and the sport having been good they remained another  day. The tide took them the next day past the shore of Wulf's estate,  and he begged the earl to land there and to pass a day or two with  his company at Steyning; but all were bent upon the chase, and they  kept on until they reached the point where the white cliffs began  to rise from the edge of the water. Here they landed again, and  spent two or three days in hunting. Neither Wulf nor Beorn had been  to sea before, and the quiet motion of the ships with their bellying  sails and banks of sturdy oarsmen delighted them. There had been  scarcely any motion, and neither had felt the qualms which they had  been warned were generally experienced for a while by those who  went upon the sea for the first time.    When the journey was resumed Wulf was struck with surprise and  almost awe by the mighty cliffs that rose up from the water's edge.  Neither he nor Beorn had seen anything like this, for although both  their estates bordered the sea, the shores were flat, and vessels,  if needs be, could be hauled up on shore.    \"What would happen if a gale were to burst upon us here?\" Wulf said  to his companion. \"If the waves were to dash us against those white  rocks the ships would be broken up like egg-shells.\"    \"Your question is answered,\" Beorn said, as a bay suddenly opened  to their sight. \"You see we are going in here, and shall anchor  snugly somewhere up this river in front of us, which is truly the  best haven we have seen since we left Bosham.\" Half an hour later  the vessels were moored to the bank, close to a wooden bridge which  spanned the little river.          CHAPTER IV.      A STORM.    After hunting for two days in the forests lying behind Newhaven,  and in the valley in which Lewes lies, they again embarked. The  master of Harold's ship had expressed some doubts as to the weather,  but as he stated that it was but some eight miles round the great  cliff that they saw to the east, and that beyond this the rocks  ceased and there was a bay in which they could ride at anchor, or  if necessary beach their vessels, it was determined to proceed, as  Harold had the day before been visited by a thane whose house lay  but two miles from the shore, and had accepted his invitation for  the party to take up their abode there for a few days, as he promised  them good sport in the forest. The cliffs rose higher as they  proceeded. They kept closer inshore, and although they could see  that the clouds were flying rapidly overhead they felt no breeze  whatever, being protected from the wind by the lofty cliffs. The  master was evidently uneasy, for he urged the rowers to exert  themselves to the utmost. Wulf and Beorn stood looking with amazement  at the cliffs towering up beside them.    \"Is it not strange that they should rise like this--like a wall  from the water?\" Wulf said. \"Had they been built up by human hands  they could scarcely have been more erect and regular. I have never  seen anything at all like it on land.\"    \"Then it must be something formed by the sea, Wulf. Do you see those  caverns at the foot of the cliff, and in some places you see there  is a mound of rocks as if newly formed? It may be that this white  stone is soft, and that the sea beating against the foot wears it  away in time, and then the rock overhead gives way by its weight  and so leaves an upright wall. Perhaps, long back, these hills were  like other hills, sloping gradually down into the sea; but in time,  perhaps many, many years before the Romans landed here, the sea  began to eat them away, and has continued to do so ever since, until  they are as we see them.\"    \"That may be so, Beorn. My father has told me that he could remember  when our estates stretched a good half-mile farther seaward, but  had since been eaten away by the waves, and he says that his father  had told him the same thing; therefore, as you say, in many hundreds  of years even hills, if the stone were soft, might also be worn  away. There we are rounding the point, and beyond there are no more  cliffs; doubtless it is in this bay that the Shipmaster Edred thinks  to anchor.\"    At that moment their conversation was cut short by a tremendous  gust of wind rushing down the sloping hill into the bay striking  them with such terrible force that the ship heeled over until the  water rushed above the bulwark. The men were thrown against each  other, and several fell down to leeward. The confusion was heightened  by the fact that the great sail, which was but loosely furled to  its yard, burst the ropes, and the wind catching it buried the craft  still further, and she would have filled and sunk had not the  ship-master seized the tiller, and aided by the two sailors there  pushed it up, and so the boat's head payed off from the wind and  ran before it.    The master shouted to the men to lower the sail, which was bellying  and flapping violently, but before his orders could be obeyed there  was a crash. The mast snapped off at the slings of the yard, and  the wreck fell over the bow of the boat. All hands were employed  for some minutes in getting the sail on board and furling it to its  yard, which was laid lengthways along the thwarts. It was found  that three men standing in the bows had been killed, and several  others badly hurt. The vessel was by this time some distance from  shore. Nothing could be done until she was freed of the water, with  which she was nigh half-full, and all hands were employed in bailing  it out.    The squall had increased rather than lessened in fury, and by the  time the water was cleared out they were two miles from the headland.  Orders were then given to man the oars again but it was found that  several of these had been lost, having been washed away when the  men leapt up, believing that the boat would capsize, or had slipped  from the rowlocks unnoticed while they were engaged in getting in  the sail. This was a serious misfortune, for every oar was needed  to force her through the water in the teeth of the wind, which was  blowing directly off shore. The remaining oars were all double-banked,  Harold himself and his thanes taking their places among the rowers.    For an hour they laboured their hardest, but at the end of that  time they were farther from shore than when they began, the force  of the wind acting on the poop and broad hull driving her seaward  faster than the rowers could force her shoreward. The sea, too,  was now getting up, and the motion of the vessel rendered it  increasingly difficult to row. Edred left his place at the tiller  and went forward to Harold.    \"My lord,\" he said, \"it is useless. In spite of your efforts we are  drifting farther and farther out, and from the look of the sky I  fear that we are going to have a great gale, and there is nothing  to do but to set a little sail and to run before it. Maybe there  will"]]]
