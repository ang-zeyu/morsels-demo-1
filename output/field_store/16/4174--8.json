For, soon after this, we find Thomas  Day entering the lists again as the champion of the injured Africans. He  had lived to see his poem of The Dying Negro, which had been published in  1773, make a considerable impression. In 1776, he had written a letter to a  friend in America, who was the possessor of slaves, to dissuade him by a  number of arguments from holding such property. And now, when the knowledge  of the case of the ship Zong was spreading, he published that letter under  the title of Fragment of an Original Letter on the Slavery of the Negroes.    In this same year, Dr. Porteus, bishop of Chester, but now bishop of  London, came forward as a new advocate for the natives of Africa. The way  in which he rendered them service, was by preaching a sermon in their  behalf, before the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. Of the wide  circulation of this sermon, I shall say something in another place, but  much more of the enlightened and pious author of it, who from this time  never failed to aid, at every opportunity, the cause, which he had so ably  undertaken.    In the year 1784, Dr. Gregory produced his Essays Historical and Moral. He  took an opportunity of disseminating in these a circumstantial knowledge of  the Slave-trade, and an equal abhorrence of it at the same time. He  explained the manner of procuring slaves in Africa; the treatment of them  in the passage, (in which he mentioned the case of the ship Zong,) and the  wicked and cruel treatment of them in the colonies. He recited and refuted  also the various arguments adduced in defence of the trade. He showed that  it was destructive to our seamen. He produced many weighty arguments also  against the slavery itself. He proposed clauses for an act of parliament  for the abolition of both; showing the good both to England and her  colonies from such a measure, and that a trade might be substituted in  Africa, in various articles, for that which he proposed to suppress. By  means of the diffusion of light like this, both of a moral and political  nature, Dr. Gregory is entitled to be ranked among the benefactors to the  African race.    In the same year, Gilbert Wakefield preached a sermon at Richmond in Surry,  where, speaking of the people of this nation, he says, \"Have we been as  renowned for a liberal communication of our religion and our laws as for  the possession of them? Have we navigated and conquered to save, to  civilize, and to instruct; or to oppress, to plunder, and to destroy? Let  India and Africa give the answer to these questions. The one we have  exhausted of her wealth and her inhabitants by violence, by famine, and by  every species of tyranny and murder. The children of the other we daily  carry from off the land of their nativity, like sheep to the slaughter, to  return no more. We tear them from every object of their affection, or, sad  alternative, drag them together to the horrors of a mutual servitude! We  keep them in the profoundest ignorance. We gall them in a tenfold chain,  with an unrelenting spirit of barbarity, inconceivable to all but the  spectators of it, unexampled among former ages and other nations, and  unrecorded even in the bloody registers of heathen persecution. Such is the  conduct of us enlightened Englishmen, reformed Christian. Thus have we  profited by our superior advantages, by the favour of God, by the doctrines  and example of a meek and lowly Saviour. Will not the blessings which we  have abused loudly testify against us? Will not the blood which we have  shed cry from the ground for vengeance upon our sins?\"    In the same year, James Ramsay, vicar of Teston in Kent, became also an  able, zealous, and indefatigable patron of the African cause. This  gentleman had resided nineteen years in the island of St. Christopher,  where he had observed the treatment of the slaves, and had studied the laws  relating to them. On his return to England, yielding to his own feelings of  duty and the solicitations of some amiable friends, he published a work,  which he called An Essay on the Treatment and Conversion of the African  Slaves in the British Sugar Colonies. After having given an account of the  relative situation of master and slave in various parts of the world, he  explained the low and degrading situation which the Africans held in  society in our own islands. He showed that their importance would be  increased, and the temporal interest of their masters promoted, by giving  them freedom, and by granting them other privileges. He showed the great  difficulty of instructing them in the state in which they then were, and  such as he himself had experienced both in his private and public attempts,  and such as others had experienced also. He stated the way in which private  attempts of this nature might probably be successful. He then answered all  objections against their capacities, as drawn from philosophy, form,  anatomy, and observation; and vindicated these from his own experience. And  lastly, he threw out ideas for the improvement of their condition, by an  establishment of a greater number of spiritual pastors among them; by  giving them more privileges than they then possessed; and by extending  towards them the benefits of a proper police. Mr. Ramsay had no other  motive for giving this work to the public, than that of humanity, or a wish  to serve this much-injured part of the human species. For he compiled it at  the hazard of forfeiting that friendship, which he had contracted with many  during his residence in the islands, and of suffering much in his private  property, as well as subjecting himself to the ill-will and persecution of  numerous individuals.    The publication of this book by one, who professed to have been so long  resident in the islands, and to have been an eye-witness of facts,  produced, as may easily be supposed, a good deal of conversation, and made  a considerable impression, but particularly at this time, when a storm was  visibly gathering over the heads of the oppressors of the African race.  These circumstances occasioned one or two persons to attempt to answer it,  and these answers brought Mr. Ramsay into the first controversy ever  entered into on this subject, during which, as is the case in most  controversies, the cause of truth was spread.    The works, which Mr. Ramsay wrote upon this subject, were, the Essay, just  mentioned, in 1784. An Enquiry, also, into the Effects of the Abolition of  the Slave-trade, in 1784. A Reply to personal Invectives and Objections, in  1785. A Letter to James Tobin, Esq., in 1787. Objections to the Abolition  of the Slave-trade, with Answers: and an Examination of Harris's Scriptural  Researches on the Licitness of the Slave-trade, in 1788;--and An Address on  the proposed Bill for the Abolition of the Slave-trade, in 1789. In short,  from the time when he first took up the cause, he was engaged in it till  his death, which was not a little accelerated by his exertions. He lived  however to see this cause in a train for parliamentary inquiry, and he died  satisfied, being convinced, as he often expressed, that the investigation  must inevitably lead to the total abolition of the Slave-trade.    In the next year, that is, in the year 1785, another advocate was seen in  monsieur Necker, in his celebrated work on the French Finances, which had  just been translated into the English language from the original work, in  1784. This virtuous statesman, after having given his estimate of the  population and revenue of the French West Indian colonies, proceeds thus:  \"The colonies of France contain, as we have seen, near five hundred  thousand slaves, and it is from the number of these poor wretches that the  inhabitants set a value on their plantations. What a dreadful prospect! and  how profound a subject for reflection! Alas! how little are we both in our  morality and our principles! We preach up humanity, and yet go every year  to bind in chains twenty thousand natives of Africa! We call the Moors  barbarians and ruffians, because they attack the liberty of Europeans at  the risk of their own; yet these Europeans go, without danger, and as mere  speculators, to purchase slaves by gratifying the avarice of their masters,  and excite all those bloody scenes, which are the usual preliminaries of  this traffic!\" He goes on still further in the same strain. He then shows  the kind of power, which has supported this execrable trade. He throws out  the idea of a general compact, by which all the European nations should  agree to abolish it. And he indulges the pleasing hope, that it may take  place even in the present generation.    In the same year we find other coadjutors coming before our view, but these  in a line different from that, in which any other belonging to this class  had yet moved. Mr. George White, a clergyman of the established church, and  Mr. John Chubb, suggested to Mr. William Tucket, the mayor of Bridgewater,  where they resided, and to others of that town, the propriety of  petitioning parliament for the abolition of the Slave-trade. This petition  was agreed upon, and, when drawn up, was as follows:--        \"The humble petition of the inhabitants of Bridgewater showeth,        \"That your petitioners, reflecting with the deepest sensibility on      the deplorable condition of that part of the human species, the      African Negros, who by the most flagitious means are reduced to      slavery and misery in the British colonies, beg leave to address      this honourable house in their behalf, and to express a just      abhorrence of a system of oppression, which no prospect of private      gain, no consideration of public advantage, no plea of political"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12434"],[0,"Twelve Studies on the Making of a Nation: The Beginnings of Israel's History (#12)"],[1,"and forests of Africa and blazed the way for the  conquest of the dark continent.  Equally significant is that noble  ambition, coupled with heroic perseverance, that has enabled  settlement workers to bring light to the darkest parts of our great  cities.    Ambition without persistency is but a dream or hope.  Observe  Jacob's persistency in the Biblical stories.  Does persistency,  which has always been a marked characteristic of the Hebrew race,  largely explain the achievements of the Jews throughout the world?  Note the apparently scientific knowledge regarding breeding of  lambs by Jacob in his dealings with Laban.  Is it a fact recognized  by science to-day?  If he knew this and Laban did not, can you  justify his acts?  Can you justify the act of the director of a  corporation who uses his prior knowledge of the business of his  corporation to make profit from buying or selling its stocks?  Who  loses?  Is he a trustee for their interests?    What is the meaning of the strange story of Jacob's midnight  struggle with the angel?  (_Hist. Bible_ I, 119-20.)  What lessons  did Jacob learn from this struggle?  Would you call Jacob a truly  religious man, according to his light and training, or were his  religious professions only hypocritical?  May he have been sincere,  but have had a wrong conception of religion?  What is hypocrisy?  Did Jacob's faith in Jehovah, in the end prove the strongest force  in his life?  Is there any trace in his later years, of the selfish  ambition which earlier dominated him?  What are his chief interests  in the latter part of his life?  Did he become the strong and noble  character that he might have been had he from the first been guided  by a worthy ambition?  Were the misfortunes that came to him in his  old age due largely to his own faults reappearing in the characters  of his sons?      V.    THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF AMBITION.    In the ultimate analysis it is the man's motive which determines  his character as well as his acts.      \"As he thinketh within himself, so is he.\"--_Prov. 23:7_.      \"Man looketh on the outward appearance, but Jehovah on    the heart.\"--_I Sam_. 16:7.    With many men the strongest motive is the desire to surpass others.  It not only leads them to perform certain acts, but in so doing  shapes their habits; and character is largely the result of man's  habitual way of acting.  Jacob grew up narrow and crafty because of  the selfish, dwarfing nature of his ambition, At first his ambition  was of a low type, that of the child which desires to acquire  possessions and power simply for himself.  In the child this  impulse is perfectly natural.  In the normally developed  individual, during the years of early adolescence (the years of 14  to 16) the social and altruistic impulses begin to develop and to  take the place of those which are purely egoistic or selfish.  When  the fully developed man fails, as did Jacob, to leave behind  childish things and retains the ambitions and impulses of the  child, his condition is pitiable.    Men of this type of ambition often achieve great things from the  economic or political point of view.  Economically they are of  greater value to society than the drifter.  Sometimes, however,  they bring ruin and disaster to society, as well as to themselves.  Despots like Herod the Great and Napoleon, corrupt political  bosses, who play into the hands of certain classes at the expense  of the general public, and men who employ grafting methods in  business or politics, belong to this class.      VI.    THE DEVELOPMENT OF RIGHT AMBITIONS.    The desire to spare one's energies is natural to man.  To gain  wealth with the least expenditure of energy is said to be the chief  economic motive.  Most men are by nature lazy.  This law of inertia  applies not only in the physical world, but also in the  intellectual, moral and spiritual fields.  The great majority of  men follow the line of least resistance.  In politics and morals  they accept the standards of their associates.  Unconsciously they  join the great army of the drifters, or followers, who preserve the  traditions of the past, but contribute little to the future  progress of the race.  To deliver man from the control of his  natural inertia he must be touched by some strong compelling power.  Ambition is one great force that enables most men to overcome this  inertia.  The influences, therefore, which kindle ambition are  among the most important which enter the life of man.    In the Orient the mother stands in especially close relation to the  son.  How far was Jacob's desire to surpass his brother inspired by  his mother?  Many of the world's greatest leaders trace the impulse  which has led them to achieve directly to their parents and  especially to their mothers.  The mother of Charles and John Wesley  is but one of the many mothers to whom the human race owes an  inestimable debt.  Of all the heritages which parents can leave  their children none is greater than a worthy ambition.  Sometimes  it is the personality of a great teacher which inspires the  youthful ambition and directs it in lines of worthy achievement.  How much of England's greatness may be traced to the quiet  influence of Arnold of Rugby!  Consider the unparalleled influence  of Socrates, Plato, Aristotle--all primarily teachers.    The true pastor with the spirit of a prophet is often able to guide  those with whom he comes into intimate contact to great fields of  service.  In encouraging Sophia Smith to found Smith College that  quiet New England pastor, the Reverend John M.  Greene, won a high  place among those in America who first appreciated the importance  of education of woman.  Equally great opportunities may lie before  every pastor and teacher and citizen.  Frequently it is the contact  through literature or in life with men or women who have done  heroic deeds or have won success in the face of great obstacles  that kindles the youthful ambition and stirs the latent motives  which in turn develop strong and noble characters.  Therein lies  the perennial value of the Biblical narratives.    For many men that which arouses their ambitions is the call of a  great opportunity or responsibility.  Note the change in General  Grant's life with the outbreak of the Civil War.  The unambitious  tanner becomes the untiring, rigid, unconquerable soldier.  Striking illustrations of this fact are many men, whose character,  as well as conduct after they have been called to positions of  political or judicial trust, is in marked contrast to their  previous record.  A corrupt lawyer has sometimes become an upright  judge.  The pride of office, the traditions of the bench have  sustained him.  It is the privilege and duty of each man, by  thoughtful deliberation and study to shape and develop his own  individual ambitions that they may conform to the highest ideals  and thus guide him to the noblest and most worthy achievement.  Of  what value to a man is biography in forming his ambitions?  Mention  some biographies that you consider of the greatest help.  In what  ways are the life and teachings of Jesus of practical service in  developing the ambitions of a man to-day?      _Questions for Further Consideration_.    Is it possible for a man without ambition to develop or to achieve  anything really significant?    In your judgment, what percentage of the men in your community  really think out and carefully plan their lives?  What proportion  drift or take the way shown them by others?    Some people consider mental or moral inertia the chief force that  sustains the corrupt political boss.  Is this true?    What proportion of the voters in your voting district actually  study and appreciate the issues in each election?    What proportion of church members drift into their church  membership, and what proportion join only after a careful study of  the relative merits of the different churches?    What are the chief ambitions that stir men to action?    What was Jesus' ambition?  Paul's?  Florence Nightingale's?  Abraham Lincoln's?  Peter Cooper's?  Garibaldi's?  Dwight L.  Moody's?  Was there a common element in the ambition of each of  these leaders of men?    Is the realization of the ambition to serve one's fellow-men  limited to those who possess unique powers or opportunities?      _Subjects for Further Study_.

But Jehovah was with Joseph so that he became a prosperous man, and  was in the house of his master the Egyptian.  When his master saw  that Jehovah was with him, and that Jehovah caused everything that  he did to prosper in his hands, Joseph found favor in his eyes, as  he ministered to him, so that he made him overseer of his house,  and all that he had he put in his charge.
