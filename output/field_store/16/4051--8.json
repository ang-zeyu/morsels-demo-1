[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8911"],[0,"Explorations in Australia (#11)"],[1,"there is a high  table-topped hill, which I think is granite. I intended going down to it,  but the country, so far as I could see, was apparently not good, and,  having crossed the tracks of some horses going towards it, and being very  unwell myself, I thought it would be useless my going. Distance to-day,  thirty-eight miles. No water.    Tuesday, 7th September, Freeling Range. Started for the range at 8 on a  bearing of 60 degrees. At eleven miles ascended the south-west hill of  Freeling range, Mount Sturt bearing 266 degrees. Changed the bearing to  96 degrees to a stony hill of granite. Found a little water, and halted  for the remainder of the day. Distance, fifteen miles.    Wednesday, 8th September, Freeling Range. Started at 7.30 for Separation  Camp, bearing 72 degrees. Halted at thirty-three miles. The first  twenty-five miles were mallee scrub with patches of grass; the last eight  miles were over elevated table land, salt bush, and a little grass with a  few patches of scrub, the soil being red, with a few fragments of quartz  and ironstone on the surface. No water.    Thursday, 9th September, Salt-Bush Country. Started at 9.15 on the same  bearing, 72 degrees, fourteen miles; changed to 160 degrees (1.30 p.m.)  two miles and a half; thence 80 degrees three miles to a small creek,  where we can obtain water by digging in the sand. Camped. Distance  to-day, twenty miles. Did not see Separation Camp; it is wrongly placed  on the map.    Friday, 10th September, Small Creek. Started at 9 on a bearing of 110  degrees for Cooroona; at seventeen miles made Cooroona. Camped fifteen  miles beyond.    Saturday, 11th September. Arrived at Mr. Thompson's station, Mount Arden.    I cannot conclude this narrative of my first journey, without  acknowledging that it was with the advice and assistance of my friend Mr.  Finke SOLELY, that I undertook this exploration of the country. I  therefore look upon him as the original pioneer (if I may be allowed so  to express myself) of all my subsequent expeditions, in which our friend  Mr. Chambers afterwards joined.      JOURNAL OF MR. STUART'S SECOND EXPEDITION (IN THE VICINITY OF LAKE  TORRENS). APRIL TO JULY, 1859.    Saturday, 2nd April, 1859. Started from Mr. Glen's for St. A'Becket's  Pool, where we camped. This water hole is a large one, and likely to last  a long time. The country around is good--a large salt bush and grassy  plain, with upwards of 300 cattle feeding upon it. Found the native  cucumber growing.    Sunday, 3rd April. Shortly after sunrise started from St. A'Becket's  Pool, over low sand hills with large valleys between, well grassed, as  described by Mr. Parry. Camped about two miles to the north-east of it,  in a polyganum and grassy valley.    Monday, 4th April. The saddles injuring our horses' backs, we must stop  and repair them. Herrgott and I rode to Shamrock Pool. There is still  water there. It may last about a month, but it is not permanent.    Tuesday, 5th April. The horses could not be found before noon. One of  them has lost a shoe, which will require to be put on. It is too late to  start to-day for St. Francis' Ponds, the distance being thirty-two miles,  and no water between. I deem it advisable to remain until to-morrow.    Wednesday, 6th April. Started on a bearing of 330 degrees, and at six  miles came upon a gum creek, with abundance of water, which I believe is  permanent. For fifty yards on each side of the creek there is a great  quantity of polyganum and other water-bushes. On the water there are a  great many ducks, cranes, and water-hens. The water hole is upwards of  three-quarters of a mile long; at the broadest place it is fifty yards in  breadth. There are two trees marked \"J.G. and W. Latitude, 30 degrees 4  minutes 1 second.\" At one mile struck Mr. Parry's tracks; had a view of  the country on the bearing that I intended to steer; saw that it would  lead me into a very rough country, therefore followed his tracks to where  he had camped. Camped south of Mount Delusion, without water. I do not  doubt that there is water further down the creek to the eastward.    Thursday, 7th April. Went to the top of Mount Delusion and took bearings.  Had some difficulty in finding St. Francis' Ponds. Towards sunset we  found them, and, to our great disappointment, quite dry; all the water  had disappeared, except a little in one of the creeks, which was salter  than the sea, and of no use to us. There seems to have been no rain here  this season; I have searched the country all round, but can see no sign  of water. I must return to-morrow morning to the creek that I passed  yesterday. The horses have now been two nights without water; they appear  to feel it very much.    Friday, 8th April. Started back on a straight line, 6.40, for the gum  creek, and arrived at 1.40 p.m., the horses being so much done up that I  must give them two days' rest. I expect they will endure it better next  time; they now know what it is to be without. In our course we crossed  the middle of Mr. Parry's dry lake. It can be crossed at any time, for  there are large courses of slate running through it in a north and south  direction, level with the bed of the lake. The country around St.  Francis' Ponds is as Mr. Parry describes it, with the exception of the  water, which is gone. There is a great deal of Cooper's Creek grass  growing in places. It is my intention to start with one man (as soon as  the horses recover), and endeavour to find water nearer Mount North-west  range. If I can find water east or west of St. Francis I shall then be  able to make the Finniss Spring.    Saturday, 9th April. Resting the horses.    Sunday, 10th April. I intended to have gone to the north to-day to search  for water, but I am so unwell from the effects of the water of this creek  that I am unable to do so. I have been very ill all yesterday and all  night, but I hope I shall be right to-morrow.    Monday, 11th April. I am unable to go and search for water, being too  weak and not able to ride. I have sent Herrgott and Muller to find St.  Stephen's Ponds, and see if there is water; they are to return by the  foot of the range and endeavour to find water there also. I have been  very ill indeed during the night; I have had no sleep for the last two  nights, and I am so weak that I am scarcely able to move.    Tuesday, 12th April. Feel a little better this morning, but still very  unwell.    Wednesday, 13th April. I feel a good deal better. I hope by to-morrow I  shall be all right again. Herrgott did not return until noon to-day. He  reports that there is no water in St. Stephen's Ponds, which I expected;  but he also states that he has found a batch of springs three miles on  this side of the ponds, with abundance of water. They are twelve in  number. I shall go to-morrow with the party to them. I am very glad he  has found them. There will now be no difficulty in taking stock to  Chambers Creek. From this camp to the springs will be the longest journey  to be encountered in a season like this, in which so little rain has  fallen. After rain has fallen there will be no difficulty at all. The  native cucumber grows about here.    Thursday, 14th April. Started at 8.10. The country travelled over was  fine salt-bush country, but there was no water on our course, although we  disturbed numerous pigeons and other birds. There are three table-topped  hills to the east of the end of our north line; I think they are those  within a short distance of which Major Warburton mentions that he found  water. It would take me too much to the east of my course to examine them  at present. I should have gone that way if Herrgott had not found those  twelve springs, which we hope to make early to-morrow morning, and then  proceed to the Finniss Springs. Camped on the east side of Decoy Hill,  without water.    Friday, 15th April, East Side of Decoy Hill. At daybreak despatched  Campbell for the horses. At 7.30 he returned with only five, and said  that he found them on the track, going back for the water from which we  have come, and that the others had left the tracks and gone west towards  the hills. I immediately despatched Muller on horseback to track and  bring them back, and I sent the others by Herrgott to get water at the  springs. Sundown: no appearance of the horses. They must have gone back.  If they have, it will be the middle of the night before Muller can be  here. It is vexing to be delayed thus with the brutes.    Saturday, 16th April, Same Place. Muller and the horses have not yet  come. I must go to the top of Decoy Hill to take some bearings. At 9.30  returned to the camp, and found Muller had just returned, but no horses;  he had followed upon their tracks until they crossed a stony hill, where  he lost them, and, on purpose to find them again, he tied the mare to a  bush; she broke loose, and would not allow him to catch her until she got  to the water. It was then sundown; he remained there during the greater  part of the night to see if the others would come in: they did not, and  he therefore came up to inform me of what had occurred. He was without  fire, blankets, or anything to eat. I did not pity him; he ought to have  been more careful. I had several times warned him not to leave the mare  insecurely tied, or she would be off. I gave him a fresh horse, and sent  him and Campbell off to follow them up to wherever they go, and not to  come back without them. It is most dreadfully annoying to be kept back in  this manner, all through the carelessness of one man: he must have been  quite close to them when the mare got away. They were short hobbled, and  I had looked at them at half-past two in the morning, to see if they were  all right, and found them feeding quietly, so that they could not have  gone far. Sundown: no appearance of the horses. I feel much better  to-day.    Sunday, 17th April, Same Place. Still neither horses nor men. At 1.30  they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8914"],[0,"England, My England (#11)"],[1,"brow, would be coming in from the outhouses.    He had been home for a year now. He was totally blind. Yet they had been  very happy. The Grange was Maurice's own place. The back was a farmstead,  and the Wernhams, who occupied the rear premises, acted as farmers.  Isabel lived with her husband in the handsome rooms in front. She and he  had been almost entirely alone together since he was wounded. They talked  and sang and read together in a wonderful and unspeakable intimacy. Then  she reviewed books for a Scottish newspaper, carrying on her old  interest, and he occupied himself a good deal with the farm. Sightless,  he could still discuss everything with Wernham, and he could also do a  good deal of work about the place--menial work, it is true, but it gave  him satisfaction. He milked the cows, carried in the pails, turned the  separator, attended to the pigs and horses. Life was still very full and  strangely serene for the blind man, peaceful with the almost  incomprehensible peace of immediate contact in darkness. With his wife he  had a whole world, rich and real and invisible.    They were newly and remotely happy. He did not even regret the loss of  his sight in these times of dark, palpable joy. A certain exultance  swelled his soul.    But as time wore on, sometimes the rich glamour would leave them.  Sometimes, after months of this intensity, a sense of burden overcame  Isabel, a weariness, a terrible _ennui_, in that silent house approached  between a colonnade of tall-shafted pines. Then she felt she would go  mad, for she could not bear it. And sometimes he had devastating fits of  depression, which seemed to lay waste his whole being. It was worse than  depression--a black misery, when his own life was a torture to him, and  when his presence was unbearable to his wife. The dread went down to the  roots of her soul as these black days recurred. In a kind of panic she  tried to wrap herself up still further in her husband. She forced the old  spontaneous cheerfulness and joy to continue. But the effort it cost her  was almost too much. She knew she could not keep it up. She felt she  would scream with the strain, and would give anything, anything, to  escape. She longed to possess her husband utterly; it gave her inordinate  joy to have him entirely to herself. And yet, when again he was gone in a  black and massive misery, she could not bear him, she could not bear  herself; she wished she could be snatched away off the earth altogether,  anything rather than live at this cost.    Dazed, she schemed for a way out. She invited friends, she tried to give  him some further connexion with the outer world. But it was no good.  After all their joy and suffering, after their dark, great year of  blindness and solitude and unspeakable nearness, other people seemed to  them both shallow, prattling, rather impertinent. Shallow prattle seemed  presumptuous. He became impatient and irritated, she was wearied. And so  they lapsed into their solitude again. For they preferred it.    But now, in a few weeks' time, her second baby would be born. The first  had died, an infant, when her husband first went out to France. She  looked with joy and relief to the coming of the second. It would be her  salvation. But also she felt some anxiety. She was thirty years old, her  husband was a year younger. They both wanted the child very much. Yet she  could not help feeling afraid. She had her husband on her hands, a  terrible joy to her, and a terrifying burden. The child would occupy her  love and attention. And then, what of Maurice? What would he do? If only  she could feel that he, too, would be at peace and happy when the child  came! She did so want to luxuriate in a rich, physical satisfaction of  maternity. But the man, what would he do? How could she provide for him,  how avert those shattering black moods of his, which destroyed them both?    She sighed with fear. But at this time Bertie Reid wrote to Isabel. He  was her old friend, a second or third cousin, a Scotchman, as she was a  Scotchwoman. They had been brought up near to one another, and all her  life he had been her friend, like a brother, but better than her own  brothers. She loved him--though not in the marrying sense. There was a  sort of kinship between them, an affinity. They understood one another  instinctively. But Isabel would never have thought of marrying Bertie. It  would have seemed like marrying in her own family.    Bertie was a barrister and a man of letters, a Scotchman of the  intellectual type, quick, ironical, sentimental, and on his knees before  the woman he adored but did not want to marry. Maurice Pervin was  different. He came of a good old country family--the Grange was not a  very great distance from Oxford. He was passionate, sensitive, perhaps  over-sensitive, wincing--a big fellow with heavy limbs and a forehead  that flushed painfully. For his mind was slow, as if drugged by the  strong provincial blood that beat in his veins. He was very sensitive to  his own mental slowness, his feelings being quick and acute. So that he  was just the opposite to Bertie, whose mind was much quicker than his  emotions, which were not so very fine.    From the first the two men did not like each other. Isabel felt that they  _ought_ to get on together. But they did not. She felt that if only each  could have the clue to the other there would be such a rare understanding  between them. It did not come off, however. Bertie adopted a slightly  ironical attitude, very offensive to Maurice, who returned the Scotch  irony with English resentment, a resentment which deepened sometimes into  stupid hatred.    This was a little puzzling to Isabel. However, she accepted it in the  course of things. Men were made freakish and unreasonable. Therefore,  when Maurice was going out to France for the second time, she felt that,  for her husband's sake, she must discontinue her friendship with Bertie.  She wrote to the barrister to this effect. Bertram Reid simply replied  that in this, as in all other matters, he must obey her wishes, if these  were indeed her wishes.    For nearly two years nothing had passed between the two friends. Isabel  rather gloried in the fact; she had no compunction. She had one great  article of faith, which was, that husband and wife should be so important  to one another, that the rest of the world simply did not count. She and  Maurice were husband and wife. They loved one another. They would have  children. Then let everybody and everything else fade into insignificance  outside this connubial felicity. She professed herself quite happy and  ready to receive Maurice's friends. She was happy and ready: the happy  wife, the ready woman in possession. Without knowing why, the friends  retired abashed and came no more. Maurice, of course, took as much  satisfaction in this connubial absorption as Isabel did.    He shared in Isabel's literary activities, she cultivated a real interest  in agriculture and cattle-raising. For she, being at heart perhaps an  emotional enthusiast, always cultivated the practical side of life, and  prided herself on her mastery of practical affairs. Thus the husband and  wife had spent the five years of their married life. The last had been  one of blindness and unspeakable intimacy. And now Isabel felt a great  indifference coming over her, a sort of lethargy. She wanted to be  allowed to bear her child in peace, to nod by the fire and drift vaguely,  physically, from day to day. Maurice was like an ominous thunder-cloud.  She had to keep waking up to remember him.    When a little note came from Bertie, asking if he were to put up a  tombstone to their dead friendship, and speaking of the real pain he felt  on account of her husband's loss of sight, she felt a pang, a fluttering  agitation of re-awakening. And she read the letter to Maurice.    'Ask him to come down,' he said.    'Ask Bertie to come here!' she re-echoed.    'Yes--if he wants to.'    Isabel paused for a few moments.    'I know he wants to--he'd only be too glad,' she replied. 'But what about  you, Maurice? How would you like it?'    'I should like it.'    'Well--in that case--But I thought you didn't care for him--'    'Oh, I don't know. I might think differently of him now,' the blind man  replied. It was rather abstruse to Isabel.    'Well, dear,' she said, 'if you're quite sure--'    'I'm sure enough. Let him come,' said Maurice.    So Bertie was coming, coming this evening, in the November rain and  darkness. Isabel was agitated, racked with her old restlessness and  indecision. She had always suffered from this pain of doubt, just an  agonizing sense of uncertainty. It had begun to pass off, in the lethargy  of maternity. Now it returned, and she resented it. She struggled as  usual to maintain her calm, composed, friendly bearing, a sort of mask  she wore over all her body.    A woman had lighted a tall lamp beside the table, and spread the cloth.  The long dining-room was dim, with its elegant but rather severe pieces  of old furniture. Only the round table glowed softly under the light. It  had a rich, beautiful effect. The white cloth glistened and dropped its  heavy, pointed lace corners almost to the carpet, the china was old and  handsome, creamy-yellow, with a blotched pattern of harsh red and deep  blue, the cups large and bell-shaped, the teapot gallant. Isabel looked  at it with superficial appreciation.    Her nerves were hurting her. She looked automatically again at the high,  uncurtained windows. In the last dusk she could just perceive outside a  huge fir-tree swaying its boughs: it was as if she thought it rather  than saw it. The rain came flying on the window panes. Ah, why had she  no peace? These two men, why did they tear at her? Why did they not  come--why was there this suspense?    She sat in a lassitude that was really suspense and irritation. Maurice,  at least, might come in--there was"]]]
