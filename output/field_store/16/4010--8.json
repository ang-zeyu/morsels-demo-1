Our hero was anxious to get back to Resaca, knowing that his prolonged  absence might have already cost him his situation as engineer on the  railroad, and as Plum Plucky had fully decided to go with him, they lost  no further time in starting for that place.    They found the railroad officials in a fever of excitement.    Believing that Jack had left them and finding no one to take his place,  the bush-raiders having grown bolder in their depredations, in their  despair, the managers were offering double their previous pay for a man  who would dare to undertake the work of getting a train through from St.  Resa to de la Pama.    Jack felt unbounded delight upon finding that the pay had been raised to  over a hundred dollars a trip, and without any explanation he offered  himself for the situation a second time.    He was gladly accepted, with no questions asked while Plum was given the  position of fireman at a salary which caused him to look with amazement.    \"Well!\" he exclaimed, \"it's too good to last.\"    \"Wait till you meet the bush-raiders,\" said Jack.    \"I reckon I can take any medicine that you can,\" was the answer, and the  boy engineer realized that he had filled Fret Offut's place with a  companion of altogether different make-up.    Somewhat to their surprise three trips were made without any molestation  from the outlaw band, when the young couple were put to a test few would  have the courage to meet.    A party of Peruvian soldiers had been sent out to protect, as far as  possible, the road, but upon this run Jack learned at a small station  before coming to the stream where the bridge had been repaired, that this  squad had been completely routed by the outlaws of the forest, and the  victorious raiders were lying in wait for the train.    In this dangerous prospect every passenger left the cars at this place,  but the order came for the train to go on if a suitable escort could be  raised.    In twenty minutes as many armed men were waiting a start, though, as Jack  looked over the motley party, he realized that not one of them would be  worth a fig in a fight with the bush-raiders. Worse than that, he felt  confident that the majority, if not all, were in league with the outlaws,  and when the proper time came would openly join with them in trying to  capture the train.    But the station agent, blind to this fact, priding himself upon having  done his duty, pompously ordered Jack to proceed on his way.    As if not to be outdone, the conductor who remained with one brakeman,  reiterated the command.    \"It looks so we were in for it,\" said Jack, as he took his post at the  lever. \"What do you say, Plum, have you the grit to try it?\"    \"I am with you, Jack, let come what may. See! I have got on a smashing  head of steam.\"    Without another word Jack pulled the bell-cord, and, throwing the valves  wide open, sent the train thundering out of the station along the gleaming  track into dangers which the bravest would not have cared to anticipate.          Chapter XIII    Precious Moments        The little crowd at the station waved their hands and gave expression to  prolonged cries, as the train thundered away on its perilous run.    Soon beyond the hearing of these outcries the two youths, standing so  bravely at their posts, heard no sound save the deep rumbling of the  engine and cars, as they sped swiftly on their way through the wilderness.    Jack was the first to speak.    \"Fix the fire so you can leave it for a short time if necessary, Plum.\"    \"Leave it any time, Jack. I wasn't so green firing as they thought me.  Reckon my firing Joe Staples' old saw-mill didn't hurt me any for this  business.\"    \"Did you burn it down, Plum, or was it sav--\"    \"Scat! you know what I mean. But do yeou begin to see anything ahead?\"    \"I could hardly expect to so soon, for they will be pretty sure to keep  out of sight until we are into their trap.\"    \"Do yeou think they will have a rock on the track?\"    \"Perhaps some obstruction. I can't just imagine how they will take us this  time.\"    \"Say, Jack, what do yeou think of 'em fellers on the train?\"    The words seemed so much like an echo of his own thoughts that the boy  engineer started with surprise at the question.    \"I'll bet yeou,\" continued Plum, \"they'll make us more trouble than the  fellers in the bushes.\"    \"Plum Plucky, you just speak my mind. I was thinking how we could best get  rid of them.\"    \"Bully for yeou, Jack North! Tell me what to do and I'm with yeou tooth  and nail.\"    \"In one respect we are fortunate,\" said Jack, in a tone which showed that  he had been pondering carefully over the matter. \"The car they are in is  to the extreme rear.\"    \"You intend to take the freight through if possible?\"    \"At any cost.\"    \"Well, then, what does their being in the rear car have to do with our  getting the rest through? Looks so they air fixed to help the raiders best  so.\"    \"Why simply--look yonder!\" said Jack, pointing suddenly a little to their  right in the distance ahead.    Plum Plucky did as he was told.    \"What is it, Jack, a big rock?\"    \"Rock? No! Look over those tree-tops; don't you see that thin column of  smoke rising high into the air and as straight as a church spire?\"    \"Gosh! yes. What of it? There can't be much wind.\"    \"It is a signal of the bush-raiders.\"    \"S'pose it is?\"    The train was now winding through the valley of the Rio Tasma, and the  sullen roar of the mountain stream was beginning to be heard above the  thunder of the cars, which were rushing along at a rapid rate.    \"I am sure of it,\" replied Jack, as he continued to watch the ascending  smoke, though without neglecting his survey ahead. \"What else can it  mean?\"    \"Sure enough.\"    \"Do you think we have a brakeman we can count on in case of an attack?\"    Plum hesitated a moment before replying.    \"Not unless it is little Pedro.\"    \"Just my mind. See! the smoke is dying out. Whatever message they had to  make has been made.\"    \"What do you think it could be?\"    \"I will tell you what I think. Just before that column appeared we must  have been in sight of whoever was on that height, and they gave that as a  signal that we were coming.\"    \"Jack you are nobody's fool; but couldn't they hear the sound of the  train?\"    \"Not above the roar of the river if they are on the other side.\"    \"I didn't think of that. But what about little Pedro?\"    \"Only this: In case those chaps in the rear car show signs of being  against us we must get rid of them as soon as possible. Do you think you  can go back to Pedro?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Well, do so at once and return as soon as you can, for every moment is  precious now. Tell Pedro the moment he hears the bell ring to uncouple the  rear car. Mind you, only that. He must be there ready at all times until  we have passed through the woods. Get back as soon as you can.\"    \"You can count on that,\" and with these words Plum began to climb over the  tender toward the line of cars behind.    The bridge of the Rio Tasma was now in plain sight, and Jack's whole  attention was fixed upon the new structure that spanned the rapid stream.    Everything seemed all right there, so he allowed the train to rush on at  unabated speed.    There was a wild fascination about this perilous trip that Jack could not  shake off. Every moment he expected to run into some unknown danger, and  he would not have been surprised to find the bridge suddenly collapsing  beneath the train.    But nothing of the kind occurred, and the engine was speedily across the  stream.    He was approaching the place where he had so narrowly escaped death from  the falling bowlder, and he could not help glancing toward the top of the  cliff, as he was carried around the curve.    At that moment the report of a gun rang out sharply on the air, the sound  coming from the rear of the train.    Then an answering report came from the depths of the forest ahead!    \"The men in the car are signaling to the raiders!\" flashed through Jack's  mind, and, simultaneously with the thought, he gave the bell cord a quick  jerk.    \"If Plum has only got there,\" he thought, as he turned his gaze upon the  course ahead.    He knew that Plum nor Pedro could not uncouple the car as long as they  were climbing the upgrade, but immediately beyond the bend a descent was  made into the valley.    He was rapidly approaching the summit, when he made a discovery which sent  a thrill of horror through his frame.    Not a hundred yards ahead lay on the right hand rail a huge bowlder!    That the bush-raiders had put it there to wreck the train he had no doubt.    Just then the train gave a sharp lurch, and the reports of firearms pealed  above the din of the moving train.    Instantly the bell cord was pulled vigorously three or four times.    Plum Plucky was in trouble.          Chapter XVI    The Attack on the Train        The firing from the rear increased, but Jack had enough to attend to  without giving it a second thought.    Out from the depths of the forest overhanging the track ahead had sprung a  score or more of armed men.    Expecting the terrible collision they had planned, they had leaped upon  the track in front of the oncoming train, flourishing their weapons and  uttering wild yells of triumph.    It was a moment to Jack North which meant all to him. To stop the train  was to throw it into the hands of his enemies; to keep on was like rushing  into the very jaws of destruction. The commotion still raging at the rear  of the train, the exulting fiends in the pathway ahead, and not less the  silent but ominous bowlder on the gleaming track foretold the end, let him  act as he might.    With that unerring precision of gaze which never failed him, Jack saw that  the stone"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7849"],[0,"The Trial (#11)"],[1,"le, but I am for him.  I've got no protection from him, even my  husband has had to get used to it; if he wants to keep his job he's got  to put up with it as that man's a student and he'll almost certainly be  very powerful later on.  He's always after me, he'd only just left when  you arrived.\"  \"That fits in with everything else,\" said K., \"I'm not  surprised.\"  \"Do you want to make things a bit better here?\" the woman  asked slowly, watching him as if she were saying something that could be  as dangerous for K. as for herself.  \"That's what I thought when I heard  you speak, I really liked what you said.  Mind you, I only heard part of  it, I missed the beginning of it and at the end I was lying on the floor  with the student - it's so horrible here,\" she said after a pause, and  took hold of K.'s hand.  \"Do you believe you really will be able to make  things better?\"  K. smiled and twisted his hand round a little in her  soft hands.  \"It's really not my job to make things better here, as you  put it,\" he said, \"and if you said that to the examining judge he would  laugh at you or punish you for it.  I really would not have become  involved in this matter if I could have helped it, and I would have lost  no sleep worrying about how this court needs to be made better.  But  because I'm told that I have been arrested - and I am under arrest - it  forces me to take some action, and to do so for my own sake.  However,  if I can be of some service to you in the process I will, of course, be  glad to do so.  And I will be glad to do so not only for the sake of  charity but also because you can be of some help to me.\"  \"How could I  help you, then?\" said the woman.  \"You could, for example, show me the  books on the table there.\"  \"Yes, certainly,\" the woman cried, and  pulled K. along behind her as she rushed to them.  The books were old  and well worn, the cover of one of them had nearly broken through in its  middle, and it was held together with a few threads.  \"Everything is so  dirty here,\" said K., shaking his head, and before he could pick the  books up the woman wiped some of the dust off with her apron.  K. took  hold of the book that lay on top and threw it open, an indecent picture  appeared.  A man and a woman sat naked on a sofa, the base intent of  whoever drew it was easy to see but he had been so grossly lacking in  skill that all that anyone could really make out were the man and the  woman who dominated the picture with their bodies, sitting in overly  upright postures that created a false perspective and made it difficult  for them to approach each other.  K. didn't thumb through that book any  more, but just threw open the next one at its title page, it was a novel  with the title, What Grete Suffered from her Husband, Hans.  \"So this is  the sort of law book they study here,\" said K., \"this is the sort of  person sitting in judgement over me.\"  \"I can help you,\" said the woman,  \"would you like me to?\"  \"Could you really do that without placing  yourself in danger?  You did say earlier on that your husband is wholly  dependent on his superiors.\"  \"I still want to help you,\" said the  woman, \"come over here, we've got to talk about it.  Don't say any more  about what danger I'm in, I only fear danger where I want to fear it.  Come over here.\"  She pointed to the podium and invited him to sit down  on the step with her.  \"You've got lovely dark eyes,\" she said after  they had sat down, looking up into K.'s face, \"people say I've got nice  eyes too, but yours are much nicer.  It was the first thing I noticed  when you first came here.  That's even why I came in here, into the  assembly room, afterwards, I'd never normally do that, I'm not really  even allowed to.\"  So that's what all this is about, thought K., she's  offering herself to me, she's as degenerate as everything else around  here, she's had enough of the court officials, which is understandable I  suppose, and so she approaches any stranger and makes compliments about  his eyes.  With that, K. stood up in silence as if he had spoken his  thoughts out loud and thus explained his action to the woman.  \"I don't  think you can be of any assistance to me,\" he said, \"to be of any real  assistance you would need to be in contact with high officials.  But I'm  sure you only know the lower employees, and there are crowds of them  milling about here.  I'm sure you're very familiar with them and could  achieve a great deal through them, I've no doubt of that, but the most  that could be done through them would have no bearing at all on the  final outcome of the trial.  You, on the other hand, would lose some of  your friends as a result, and I have no wish of that.  Carry on with  these people in the same way as you have been, as it does seem to me to  be something you cannot do without.  I have no regrets in saying this  as, in return for your compliment to me, I also find you rather  attractive, especially when you look at me as sadly as you are now,  although you really have no reason to do so.  You belong to the people I  have to combat, and you're very comfortable among them, you're even in  love with the student, or if you don't love him you do at least prefer  him to your husband.  It's easy to see that from what you've been  saying.\"  \"No!\" she shouted, remained sitting where she was and grasped  K.'s hand, which he failed to pull away fast enough.  \"You can't go away  now, you can't go away when you've misjudged me like that!  Are you  really capable of going away now?  Am I really so worthless that you  won't even do me the favour of staying a little bit longer?\"  \"You  misunderstand me,\" said K., sitting back down, \"if it's really important  to you for me to stay here then I'll be glad to do so, I have plenty of  time, I came here thinking there would be a trial taking place.  All I  meant with what I said just now was to ask you not to do anything on my  behalf in the proceedings against me.  But even that is nothing for you  to worry about when you consider that there's nothing hanging on the  outcome of this trial, and that, whatever the verdict, I will just laugh  at it.  And that's even presupposing it ever even reaches any  conclusion, which I very much doubt.  I think it's much more likely that  the court officials will be too lazy, too forgetful, or even too fearful  ever to continue with these proceedings and that they will soon be  abandoned if they haven't been abandoned already.  It's even possible  that they will pretend to be carrying on with the trial in the hope of  receiving a large bribe, although I can tell you now that that will be  quite in vain as I pay bribes to no-one.  Perhaps one favour you could  do me would be to tell the examining judge, or anyone else who likes to  spread important news, that I will never be induced to pay any sort of  bribe through any stratagem of theirs - and I'm sure they have many  stratagems at their disposal.  There is no prospect of that, you can  tell them that quite openly.  And what's more, I expect they have  already noticed themselves, or even if they haven't, this affair is  really not so important to me as they think.  Those gentlemen would only  save some work for themselves, or at least some unpleasantness for me,  which, however, I am glad to endure if I know that each piece of  unpleasantness for me is a blow against them.  And I will make quite  sure it is a blow against them.  Do you actually know the judge?\"  \"Course I do,\" said the woman, \"he was the first one I thought of when I  offered to help you.  I didn't know he's only a minor official, but if  you say so it must be true.  Mind you, I still think the report he gives  to his superiors must have some influence.  And he writes so many  reports.  You say these officials are lazy, but they're certainly not  all lazy, especially this examining judge, he writes ever such a lot.  Last Sunday, for instance, that session went on till the evening.  Everyone had gone, but the examining judge, he stayed in the hall, I had  to bring him a lamp in, all I had was a little kitchen lamp but he was  very satisfied with it and started to write straight away.  Meantime my  husband arrived, he always has the day off on Sundays, we got the  furniture back in and got our room sorted out and then a few of the  neighbours came, we sat and talked for a bit by a candle, in short, we  forgot all about the examining judge and went to bed.  All of a sudden  in the night, it must have been quite late in the night, I wakes up,  next to the bed, there's the examining judge shading the lamp with his  hand so that there's no light from it falls on my husband, he didn't  need to be as careful as that, the way my husband sleeps the light  wouldn't have woken him up anyway.  I was quite shocked and nearly  screamed, but the judge was very friendly, warned me I should be  careful, he whispered to me he's been writing all this time, and now  he's brought me the lamp back, and he'll never forget how I looked when  he found me there asleep.  What I mean, with all this, I just wanted to  tell you how the examining judge really does write lots of reports,  especially about you as questioning you was definitely one of the main  things on the agenda that Sunday.   If he writes reports as long as that  they must be of some importance.   And besides all that, you can see  from what happened that the examining judge is after me, and it's right  now, when he's first begun to notice me, that I can have a lot of  influence on him.  And I've got other proof I mean a lot to him, too.  Yesterday, he sent that student to me, the one he really trusts and who  he works with, he sent him with a present for me, silk stockings.  He  said it was because I clear up in the courtroom but that's only a  pretence, that job's no more than what I'm supposed to do, it's what my  husband gets paid for.  Nice stockings, they are, look,\" - she stretched  out her leg, drew her"]]]
