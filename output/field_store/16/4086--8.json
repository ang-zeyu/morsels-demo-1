Therefore say  Which hand leads nearest to the rifted rock?\"    So spake my guide, to whom a shade return'd:  \"Come after us, and thou shalt find the cleft.  We may not linger: such resistless will  Speeds our unwearied course.  Vouchsafe us then  Thy pardon, if our duty seem to thee  Discourteous rudeness.  In Verona I  Was abbot of San Zeno, when the hand  Of Barbarossa grasp'd Imperial sway,  That name, ne'er utter'd without tears in Milan.  And there is he, hath one foot in his grave,  Who for that monastery ere long shall weep,  Ruing his power misus'd: for that his son,  Of body ill compact, and worse in mind,  And born in evil, he hath set in place  Of its true pastor.\"  Whether more he spake,  Or here was mute, I know not: he had sped  E'en now so far beyond us.  Yet thus much  I heard, and in rememb'rance treasur'd it.    He then, who never fail'd me at my need,  Cried, \"Hither turn.  Lo! two with sharp remorse  Chiding their sin!\"  In rear of all the troop  These shouted: \"First they died, to whom the sea  Open'd, or ever Jordan saw his heirs:  And they, who with Aeneas to the end  Endur'd not suffering, for their portion chose  Life without glory.\"  Soon as they had fled  Past reach of sight, new thought within me rose  By others follow'd fast, and each unlike  Its fellow: till led on from thought to thought,  And pleasur'd with the fleeting train, mine eye  Was clos'd, and meditation chang'd to dream.          CANTO XIX    It was the hour, when of diurnal heat  No reliques chafe the cold beams of the moon,  O'erpower'd by earth, or planetary sway  Of Saturn; and the geomancer sees  His Greater Fortune up the east ascend,  Where gray dawn checkers first the shadowy cone;  When 'fore me in my dream a woman's shape  There came, with lips that stammer'd, eyes aslant,  Distorted feet, hands maim'd, and colour pale.    I look'd upon her; and as sunshine cheers  Limbs numb'd by nightly cold, e'en thus my look  Unloos'd her tongue, next in brief space her form  Decrepit rais'd erect, and faded face  With love's own hue illum'd. Recov'ring speech  She forthwith warbling such a strain began,  That I, how loth soe'er, could scarce have held  Attention from the song.  \"I,\" thus she sang,  \"I am the Siren, she, whom mariners  On the wide sea are wilder'd when they hear:  Such fulness of delight the list'ner feels.  I from his course Ulysses by my lay  Enchanted drew.  Whoe'er frequents me once  Parts seldom; so I charm him, and his heart  Contented knows no void.\"  Or ere her mouth  Was clos'd, to shame her at her side appear'd  A dame of semblance holy.  With stern voice  She utter'd; \"Say, O Virgil, who is this?\"  Which hearing, he approach'd, with eyes still bent  Toward that goodly presence: th' other seiz'd her,  And, her robes tearing, open'd her before,  And show'd the belly to me, whence a smell,  Exhaling loathsome, wak'd me.  Round I turn'd  Mine eyes, and thus the teacher: \"At the least  Three times my voice hath call'd thee.  Rise, begone.  Let us the opening find where thou mayst pass.\"    I straightway rose.  Now day, pour'd down from high,  Fill'd all the circuits of the sacred mount;  And, as we journey'd, on our shoulder smote  The early ray.  I follow'd, stooping low  My forehead, as a man, o'ercharg'd with thought,  Who bends him to the likeness of an arch,  That midway spans the flood; when thus I heard,  \"Come, enter here,\" in tone so soft and mild,  As never met the ear on mortal strand.    With swan-like wings dispread and pointing up,  Who thus had spoken marshal'd us along,  Where each side of the solid masonry  The sloping, walls retir'd; then mov'd his plumes,  And fanning us, affirm'd that those, who mourn,  Are blessed, for that comfort shall be theirs.    \"What aileth thee, that still thou look'st to earth?\"  Began my leader; while th' angelic shape  A little over us his station took.    \"New vision,\" I replied, \"hath rais'd in me  Surmisings strange and anxious doubts, whereon  My soul intent allows no other thought  Or room or entrance.\"--\"Hast thou seen,\" said he,  \"That old enchantress, her, whose wiles alone  The spirits o'er us weep for?  Hast thou seen  How man may free him of her bonds?  Enough.  Let thy heels spurn the earth, and thy rais'd ken  Fix on the lure, which heav'n's eternal King  Whirls in the rolling spheres.\"  As on his feet  The falcon first looks down, then to the sky  Turns, and forth stretches eager for the food,  That woos him thither; so the call I heard,  So onward, far as the dividing rock  Gave way, I journey'd, till the plain was reach'd.    On the fifth circle when I stood at large,  A race appear'd before me, on the ground  All downward lying prone and weeping sore.  \"My soul hath cleaved to the dust,\" I heard  With sighs so deep, they well nigh choak'd the words.  \"O ye elect of God, whose penal woes  Both hope and justice mitigate, direct  Tow'rds the steep rising our uncertain way.\"    \"If ye approach secure from this our doom,  Prostration--and would urge your course with speed,  See that ye still to rightward keep the brink.\"    So them the bard besought; and such the words,  Beyond us some short space, in answer came.    I noted what remain'd yet hidden from them:  Thence to my liege's eyes mine eyes I bent,  And he, forthwith interpreting their suit,  Beckon'd his glad assent. Free then to act,  As pleas'd me, I drew near, and took my stand  O`er that shade, whose words I late had mark'd.  And, \"Spirit!\"  I said, \"in whom repentant tears  Mature that blessed hour, when thou with God  Shalt find acceptance, for a while suspend  For me that mightier care.  Say who thou wast,  Why thus ye grovel on your bellies prone,  And if in aught ye wish my service there,  Whence living I am come.\"  He answering spake  \"The cause why Heav'n our back toward his cope  Reverses, shalt thou know: but me know first  The successor of Peter, and the name  And title of my lineage from that stream,  That' twixt Chiaveri and Siestri draws  His limpid waters through the lowly glen.  A month and little more by proof I learnt,  With what a weight that robe of sov'reignty  Upon his shoulder rests, who from the mire  Would guard it: that each other fardel seems  But feathers in the balance.  Late, alas!  Was my conversion: but when I became  Rome's pastor, I discern'd at once the dream  And cozenage of life, saw that the heart  Rested not there, and yet no prouder height  Lur'd on the climber: wherefore, of that life  No more enamour'd, in my bosom love  Of purer being kindled.  For till then  I was a soul in misery, alienate  From God, and covetous of all earthly things;  Now, as thou seest, here punish'd for my doting.  Such cleansing from the taint of avarice  Do spirits converted need.  This mount inflicts  No direr penalty.  E'en as our eyes  Fasten'd below, nor e'er to loftier clime  Were lifted, thus hath justice level'd us  Here on the earth.  As avarice quench'd our love  Of good, without which is no working, thus  Here justice holds us prison'd, hand and foot  Chain'd down and bound, while heaven's just Lord shall please.  So long to tarry motionless outstretch'd.\"    My knees I stoop'd, and would have spoke; but he,  Ere my beginning, by his ear perceiv'd  I did him reverence; and \"What cause,\" said he,  \"Hath bow'd thee thus!\"--\"Compunction,\" I rejoin'd.  \"And inward awe of your high dignity.\"    \"Up,\" he exclaim'd, \"brother! upon thy feet  Arise: err not: thy fellow servant I,  (Thine and all others') of one Sovran Power.  If thou hast ever mark'd those holy sounds  Of gospel truth, 'nor shall be given ill marriage,'  Thou mayst discern the reasons of my speech.  Go thy ways now; and linger here no more.  Thy tarrying is a let unto the tears,  With which I hasten that whereof thou spak'st.  I have on earth a kinswoman; her name  Alagia, worthy in herself, so ill  Example of our house corrupt her not:  And she is all remaineth of me there.\"          CANTO XX    Ill strives the will, 'gainst will more wise that strives  His pleasure therefore to mine own preferr'd,  I drew the sponge yet thirsty from the wave.    Onward I mov'd: he also onward mov'd,  Who led me, coasting still, wherever place  Along the rock was vacant, as a man  Walks near the battlements on narrow wall.  For those on th' other part, who drop by drop  Wring out their all-infecting malady,  Too closely press the verge.  Accurst be thou!  Inveterate wolf! whose gorge ingluts more prey,  Than every beast beside, yet is not fill'd!  So bottomless thy maw!--Ye spheres of heaven!  To whom there are, as seems, who attribute  All change in mortal state, when is the day  Of his appearing, for whom fate reserves  To chase her hence?--With wary steps and slow  We pass'd; and I attentive to the shades,  Whom piteously I heard lament and wail;    And, 'midst the wailing, one before us heard  Cry out \"O blessed Virgin!\"  as a dame  In the sharp pangs of childbed; and \"How poor  Thou wast,\" it added, \"witness that low roof  Where thou didst lay thy sacred burden down.  O good Fabricius! thou didst virtue choose  With poverty, before great wealth with vice.\"    The words so pleas'd me, that desire to know  The spirit, from whose lip they seem'd to come,  Did draw me onward.  Yet it spake the gift  Of Nicholas, which on the maidens he  Bounteous bestow'd, to save their youthful prime  Unblemish'd.  \"Spirit! who dost speak of deeds  So worthy, tell me who thou was,\" I said,  \"And why thou dost with single voice renew  Memorial of such praise. That boon vouchsaf'd  Haply shall meet reward; if I return  To finish the Short pilgrimage of life,  Still speeding to its close on restless wing.\"    \"I,\" answer'd he, \"will tell"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10065"],[0,"The Constitution of the United States (#12)"],[1,"un. He then prophetically added:        \"I have often and often in the course of the sessions and the      vicissitudes of my hopes and fears in its issues, looked at that      behind the President without being able to tell whether it was      rising or setting. But now at length I have the happiness to know      that it is a rising and not a setting sun.\"    Time has verified the genial doctor's prediction. The career of the new  nation thus formed has hitherto been a rising and not a setting sun. He  had in his sixty years of conspicuously useful citizenship--and perhaps  no nation ever had a more untiring and unselfish servant--done more than  any American to develop the American Commonwealth, but like Moses, he  was destined to see the promised land only from afar, for the new  Government had hardly been inaugurated, before Franklin died, as full of  years as honours. Prophetic as was his vision, he could never have  anticipated the reality of to-day, for this nation, thus deliberately  formed in the light of reason and without blood or passion, is to-day,  by common consent, one of the greatest and, I trust I may add, one of  the noblest republics of all time.          _III. The Political Philosophy of the Constitution_      In my last address I left Doctor Franklin predicting to the discouraged  remnant of the constitutional convention that the nation then formed  would be a \"rising sun\" in the constellation of the nations. The sun,  however, was destined to rise through a bank of dark and murky clouds,  for the Constitution could not take effect until it was ratified by nine  of the thirteen States; and when it was submitted to the people, who  selected State conventions for the purpose of ratifying or rejecting the  proposed plan of government, a bitter controversy at once ensued between  two political parties, then in process of formation, one called the  Constitution ratified without controversy. In the remaining ten the  struggle was long and arduous, and nearly a year passed before the  requisite nine States gave their assent. Two of the States refused to  become parts of the new nation, even after it began, and three years  passed before the thirteen States were re-united under the Constitution.    It could not have been ratified had there not been an assurance that  there would be immediate amendments to provide a Bill of Rights to  safeguard the individual. Thus came into existence the first ten  amendments to the Constitution, with their perpetual guaranty of the  fundamental rights of religion, freedom of speech and of the Press, the  right of assemblage, the immunity from unreasonable searches and  seizures, the right of trial by jury, and similar guarantees of  fundamental individual rights.    Distrustful as the American people were of the new Constitution, they  yet had the political sagacity to prefer its imperfections, whatever  they imagined them to be, to the mad spirit of innovation; and in order  that the great instrument should not, through the excesses of party  passion or the temporary caprices of fleeting generations, speedily  become a mere \"scrap of paper\" they very wisely provided that no  amendment should, in the future, be made unless it was proposed by at  least two-thirds of the Senate and the House of Representatives and  ratified by three-fourths of the States through their legislatures or  through special conventions. This was only one of many striking  negations of the principle of majority rule. As a result of this  provision, if we count the first ten amendments as virtually part of the  original document, only nine amendments have been adopted in 185 years,  and of these, excepting the amendments which ended slavery as the result  of the Civil War, only the last three, passed in recent years partly  through the relaxing influence of the world war, mark a serious  departure from the basic principles of the Constitution.    This stability is the more remarkable when we recall the profound and  revolutionary change that has taken place in the social life of man  since the Constitution was adopted. It was framed at the very end of the  pastoral-agricultural age of humanity. The industrial revolution, which  has more profoundly affected man in the last century and a half than all  the changes which had theretofore taken place in the life of man since  the cave-dweller, was only then beginning. Measured in terms of  mechanical power, men when the Constitution was formed were Lilliputians  as compared with the Brobdingnagians of our day, when man outflies the  eagle, outswims the fish, and by his conquest and utilization of the  invisible forces of nature has become the superman; and yet the  Constitution of 1787 is, in most of its essential principles, still the  Constitution of 1922. This surely marks it as a marvel in statecraft  and can only be explained by the fact that the Constitution was  developed by a people who, as \"children brave and free of the great  mother-tongue,\" had a real genius for self-government and its essential  element, the spirit of self-restraint.    While it is true that the _text_ of the instrument has suffered almost  as little change as the Nicene Creed, yet it would be manifest error to  suggest that in its development by practical application the  Constitution has not undergone great changes.    The first and greatest of all its expounders, Chief Justice Marshall,  said, in one of his greatest opinions, that the Constitution was--        \"intended to endure for ages to come, and consequently to be      _adapted_ to the various crises of human affairs. To have prescribed      the means by which government should in all future times execute      its powers would have been to change entirely the character of the      instrument and to give it the properties of a legal code. It would      have been an unwise attempt to provide by immutable rules for      exigencies which, if foreseen at all, must have been foreseen dimly,      and can best be provided for as they occur.\"    In this great purpose of enumerating rather than defining the powers of  government its framers were supremely wise. While it was marvellously  sagacious in what it provided, it was wise to the point of inspiration  in what it left unprovided.    Nothing is more admirable than the self-restraint of men who, venturing  upon an untried experiment, and after debating for four months upon the  principles of government, were content to embody their conclusions in  not more than four thousand words. To this we owe the elasticity of the  instrument. Its vitality is due to the fact that, by usage, judicial  interpretation, and, when necessary, formal amendment, it can be thus  adapted to the ever-accelerating changes of the most progressive age in  history, and that a people have administered the Constitution who, in  the process of such adaptation, have generally shown the same spirit of  conservative self-restraint as did the men who framed it.    The Constitution is neither, on the one hand, a Gibraltar rock, which  wholly resists the ceaseless washing of time or circumstance, nor is it,  on the other hand, a sandy beach, which is slowly destroyed by the  erosion of the waves. It is rather to be likened to a floating dock,  which, while firmly attached to its moorings, and not therefore the  caprice of the waves, yet rises and falls with the tide of time and  circumstance.    While in its practical adaptation to this complex age the men who framed  it, if they could \"revisit the glimpses of the moon,\" would as little  recognize their own handiwork as their own nation, yet they would still  be able to find in successful operation the essential principles which  they embodied in the document more than a century ago.    Its success is also due to the fact that its framers were little  influenced by the spirit of doctrinarianism. They were not empiricists,  but very practical men. This is the more remarkable because they worked  in a period of an emotional fermentation of human thought. The  long-repressed intellect of man had broken into a violent eruption like  that of a seemingly extinct volcano.    From the middle of the eighteenth century until the end of the French  Revolution the masses everywhere were influenced by the emotional, and  at times hysterical, abstractions of the French encyclopedists; and that  these had influenced thought in the American colonies is readily shown  in the preamble of the Declaration of Independence, with its  unqualified assertion of the equality of men and the absolute right of  self-determination. The Declaration sought in its noble idealism to make  the \"world safe for democracy,\" but the Constitution attempted the  greater task of making democracy safe for the world by inducing a people  to impose upon themselves salutary restraints upon majority rule.    Fortunately, the framers of the Constitution had learned a rude and  terrible lesson in the anarchy that had followed the War of  Independence. They were not so much concerned about the rights of man as  about his duties, and their great purpose was to substitute for the  visionary idealism of a rampant individualism the authority of law. Of  the hysteria of that time, which was about to culminate in the French  Revolution, there is no trace in the Constitution.    They were less concerned about Rousseau's social contract than to  restore law and order. Hard realities and not generous and impossible  abstractions interested them. They had suffered grievously for more than  ten years from misrule and had a distaste for mere phrase-making, of  which they had had a satiety, for the Constitution, in which there is  not a wasted word, is as cold and dry a document as a problem in  mathematics or a manual of parliamentary law. Its mandates have the  simplicity and directness of the Ten Commandments, and, like the  Decalogue, it consists more of what shall not be done than what shall be  done."]]]
