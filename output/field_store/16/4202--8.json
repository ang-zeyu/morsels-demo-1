Surely you remember! That was the place, the firm  fortress, where it was safe from us even without being locked up. We  used to amuse ourselves by slapping flies, when it stood there, because  we could not endure to see them flying around happily and enjoying what  we ourselves were unable to reach.    CLARA.    I should think people would forget about such things when they had  hundreds and thousands of books to study.    SECRETARY.    Indeed they do forget it! To be sure, what does one not forget over  Justinian and Gaius? Small boys who persistently resist their A B C's  know very well why they do it; they have a presentiment that if they do  not apply themselves too hard to the primer they will never have to  struggle with the Bible. But it is a downright shame! People deceive the  innocent souls! They are shown the red rooster with the basket full of  eggs on the last page, so that of their own accord they say: \"Ah!\" And  then there is no more holding back; they go tearing down the hill to Z,  and so forth and so forth, until all of a sudden they find themselves in  the midst of the _Corpus Juris_, and are horrified when they realize  what a wilderness the accursed twenty-four letters have enticed them  into--the letters, which, in the beginning, formed themselves, in a  merry dance, only into nice-tasting and nice-smelling words such as  \"cherry\" and \"rose.\"    CLARA.    And [_Absent-mindedly, and without interest_]--what happens then?    SECRETARY.    That depends upon the difference of temperament. Some work themselves  through. Those usually come forth into daylight again after three or  four years, but looking somewhat thin and pale; however, one must not  blame them for that; I myself am one of that kind. Others lie down in  the middle of the forest; they intend merely to rest themselves, but  they seldom get up again. I myself have a friend who has been drinking  his beer for three years already in the shade of the _Lex Julia_; he  selected the place on account of its name--it recalls pleasant memories.  Still others give up in despair and turn back; those are the stupid  ones; people let them out of one thicket only on condition that they  will run at full speed into another. And then there are some who are  still worse, and who don't get anywhere!    [_To himself._]    How one chatters when one has something in his mind and does not know  how to bring it out!    CLARA.    Everything is bright and cheerful today; that's because it is such  beautiful weather.    SECRETARY.    Yes, in weather like this the owls fall out of their nests, the bats  kill themselves because they feel the devil has created them, the mole  burrows so deep into the earth that he cannot find his way out again and  must pitifully suffocate unless he bores through to the other side and  emerges again in America. Today every ear of corn shoots up twice as  high, and every poppy grows twice as red as usual, even if only out of  shame at not having been so at first. Shall man remain behind? Shall he  defraud the dear Lord of the only reward which His world offers Him--a  happy face and a bright eye, which mirrors and at the same time  transfigures all this gloriousness? Truly, when I see one of these  recluses sneaking out of his door in the morning, his brow furrowed with  wrinkles, and staring at the sky as if it were a vault of  blotting-paper, I often think to myself: It is going to rain soon; God  will have to let down the curtain of clouds, so that that sour face will  not irritate Him. They ought to take legal action against fellows like  that on the ground that they are thwarters of merry parties and  destroyers of harvest weather. How are you going to render thanks for  your life if not by living? Sing joyously, bird, or else you will not  deserve your voice!    CLARA.    Oh, that is true, so true! It almost makes me cry!    SECRETARY.    It was not meant for you. That for eight days you have been breathing  more heavily than you used to, I well understand--I know your father.  But, God be praised! I can make your heart free again, and for that very  purpose I am here. You shall see your brother again this very evening,  and people shall point their fingers, not at him, but at those who cast  him into prison. Does that deserve a kiss, a sisterly kiss, if it cannot  be any other kind? Or shall we play blindman's buff for it?--If I do not  catch you in ten minutes, I am to go away without the kiss and take a  box on the ear into the bargain.    CLARA (_to herself_).    I feel as if I had suddenly grown to be a thousand years old, and time  were standing still with me. I can go neither backwards nor forwards!  Oh, all this brazen sunshine and cheerfulness round about me!    SECRETARY.    You do not answer me. To be sure, I forgot--you are engaged. Oh, girl!  Why did you do that to me? And yet have I any right to complain? She is  like all that is dear and good, and all that is dear and good should  have made me think of her. And yet to me she was for years as if she no  longer existed in the world! For that reason she--If it only were a  fellow before whom one had to cast down one's eyes! But this Leonard--    CLARA (_suddenly, when she hears the name_).    I must go to him. That is just it--I am no longer the sister of a  thief!--Oh, God! what shall I do? Leonard will, he must! He needs only  not to be a fiend! Everything will be as it used to be [_Shudders_]--as  it used to be!    [_To the SECRETARY._]    Do not be offended, Frederick!--Why are my legs so heavy all of a  sudden?    SECRETARY.    You will--    CLARA.    To Leonard! Where else should I go? Only that one road lies before me in  this world!    SECRETARY.    You love him, then! Well--    CLARA (_wildly_).    Love him? It is either he or death! Does anybody wonder that I choose  him? I would not do it had I only myself to consider!    SECRETARY.    He or death? Girl, thus speaks Despair, or--    CLARA.    Do not make me frantic! Do not mention that word again! You! It is you I  love! There! I cry it out to you as if I were already wandering on the  other side of the grave, where no one blushes any more, where cold and  naked forms glide past one another, because the fearful, holy presence  of God has entirely consumed in every one all thought of others.    SECRETARY.    Me? Still me? Clara, I divined it when I saw you out in the garden.    CLARA.    Did you? Oh, the other too!    [_Gloomily, as if she were alone._]    He stepped up in front of me--he or I!--Oh, my heart, my accursed heart!  In order to prove to him, prove to myself, that it was not so, or to  stifle it if it were so, I did what now [_Breaks out into tears_]--God  in Heaven! I would have pity on myself, were I Thou, and Thou I!    SECRETARY.    Clara, be my wife! I came to look once more into your eyes in the old  way. Had you not understood the look I should have gone away again  without speaking. Everything that I am and have I now offer to you. It  is little, but it may grow to be more. I should have been here long ago,  but your mother was sick, and then she died.    [Illustration: Alfred Rethel DEATH PLAYING THE FINALE]    CLARA (_laughs crazily_).    SECRETARY.    Take courage, girl! The fellow has your word--that worries you. And, to  be sure, it is a damnable thing! How could you--    CLARA.    Oh, ask me everything that conspires to drive a poor girl crazy! Scorn  and derision from all sides when you went to the University, and did not  let me hear from you.--\"She still thinks of him!\" \"She thinks that  child's play was meant seriously!\" \"Does she receive any letters from  him?\"--And then, too, my mother: \"Stay with people of your class!\"  \"Pride never succeeds!\" \"Leonard is a very nice fellow; everybody is  surprised that you look at him over your shoulder so!\" And added to all  the rest, my own heart: \"If he has forgotten you, show him that you  too--\" Oh, God!    SECRETARY.    I am to blame. I realize it. Well, what is difficult is not necessarily  impossible. I will get him to release you. Perhaps--    CLARA.    Release me? There!    [_Throws LEONARD'S letter to him._]    SECRETARY (_reads_).    As cashier, I--your brother--thief--very sorry--but out of consideration  for my office, I cannot help it--[_To CLARA._] He wrote you that on the  very day your mother died? For he adds his condolence on her sudden  death!    CLARA.    I suppose so!    SECRETARY.    The Devil take him! Great God, the cats, snakes and other monsters  which, so to speak, slipped through Thy fingers at Creation, so  delighted Beelzebub that he imitated Thy patterns--but he finished them  off better than Thou didst; he put them in a human skin, and now they  stand in rank and file with the rest of Thy humanity, and one does not  recognize them until they begin to scratch and sting!    [_To CLARA._]    But it is well, indeed it is fine!    [_He tries to embrace her._]    Come! Forever! With this kiss--    CLARA (_sinks into his arms_).    No, not forever! Only to keep me from falling--but no kiss!    SECRETARY.    Girl, you do not love him, you have your release--    CLARA (_gloomily, straightening herself up again_).    And yet I must go to him, I must throw myself on my knees before him and  cry out: \"Behold my father's white hairs! Take me!\"    SECRETARY.    Unhappy girl! Do I understand you?    CLARA.    Yes!    SECRETARY.    No man can overlook that! Think of having to cast down one's eyes before  a man into whose face one would like to spit!    [_He presses CLARA wildly to him._]    Poor, poor girl!    CLARA.    Go now, go!

We proceeded along the right bank of the Lachlan, crossing at five miles  a small arm or ana-branch* which had been seen higher up diverging from  the river, and flowing towards the north-west by Mr. Oxley. The local  name of it is Yamorrima. Beyond this watercourse Cannil plains extend and  were more grassy than plains in general. I observed a small ridge of  trap-rock near the river. We crossed soon after the base of Mount  Torrens, also a hill of trap; and a continuation on this bank of the  Lachlan of the Goulburn range. Mount Torrens is however only an elongated  hill. The trap-rock reappears in some lower hills further northward, of  which Mount Davison is the highest and most eastern.    (*Footnote. See Footnote below.)    QUAWYS.    Beyond Mount Torrens we entered the region which lies to the westward of  the Macquarie range, and found several new plants, especially a very  pretty Xerotes, with sweetly perfumed flowers, being a good deal like X.  leucocephala, but with the leaves filamentous at the edges, and the male  spikes interrupted.* We encamped on a deep pond at a bend of the Lachlan  named Gonniguldury. I learnt from the old native guide who accompanied us  from Regent's lake that they call those ponds of a river which never dry  up quawy, a word which proved to be of use to us in descending the  Lachlan. At this camp I found, by a careful observation of alpha and beta  Centauri, that the magnetic variation was 8 degrees 56 minutes 15 seconds  East.    (*Footnote. X. typhina, Lindley manuscripts; acaulis, foliis longissimis  angusto-linearibus margine laevibus filamentosis basi laceris, capitulis  omnibus cylindraceis lanatis foemincis simplicibus masculis interruptis.)    WALLANGOME.    April 18.    We continued along the riverbank passing quawys of various names as they  were pointed out by our guide. We crossed the skirt of an extensive plain  (Eeoappa) which brought in view just ahead of us a low ridge named  Wallangome. At 8 1/2 miles we found the river close under the southern  extremity of this hill, and its rocks so obstructed our passage that we  were delayed an hour in clearing a way. I ascended that point nearest the  river and determined its position by taking angles on various heights  already laid down in my map such as Granard, Yarrarar, Mount Torrens,  etc. The hill itself consisted chiefly of quartz rock, but at its base  were water-worn blocks of quartzose sandstone containing pebbles of  quartz, and they seemed to be the principal rock in the bed of the  Lachlan.    As we proceeded a low rocky ridge or extremity from Wallangome extended  upwards of a mile along the river. Soon after we had passed a bend called  Taralago we crossed the southern limits of a plain of which the local  name is Nyaindurry, being bounded on the north-west by an isolated hill  named Moriattu. After passing successively two similar points of the  river we reached that of Gooda, where we encamped, the latitude observed  being 33 degrees 23 minutes 3 seconds South.    WILD CATTLE.    Mr. Stapylton, with overseer Burnett and the natives, had gone forward  early in the morning towards the hills near this place in pursuit of wild  cattle, which were said to abound near it. The tracks we perceived were  old, and although the other party had found many that were newer they  returned without having seen any of these wild animals. It appeared that  a herd of such cattle had got together about Macquarie's range, then only  a short way ahead of us, and I saw no objections to the overseer's  killing one or two, as he wished to do, in order that we might feed our  native guides without drawing so largely as we were otherwise compelled  to do on our own stock of provisions. This was a fortunate day for us in  regard to plants. Besides several curious kinds of grass,* a splendid  blue Brunonia was found on Wallangome. Its colour surpassed any azure I  had ever seen in flowers, the tinge being rather deeper than that of the  turquoise. We also obtained the seed so that I hoped this plant, which  seemed hardy enough, might become a pleasing addition to our  horticultural treasures.    The flowers are nature's jewels.**    (*Footnote. Lappago racemosa, W. and Aristida ramosa, R. Br.)    (**Footnote. Croly's Gems.)    The pink lily* was also found, as on Yerrarar, amongst rocks, but growing  in rich red soil. We gathered a number of the bulbs, being very desirous  to propagate this plant, which differs from the common white amaryllis  and others belonging to the plains not only in colour, but also in the  absence from their corona of intermediate teeth. We again found here the  new Xerotes, having the flower in five or six round tufts on the blade.  The flowered blades drooped around, radiating from the centre, while  those without flowers stood upright, giving to the whole an uncommon  appearance; the flower had a very pleasant perfume.    ASCEND MORIATTU.    April 19.    Mr. Stapylton conducted the party forward while I went to the summit of  Moriattu with the theodolite. Thence I saw Mount Granard, Yerrarar, and  Mount Torrens, also the various points which I had intersected from  Wallangome. A level plain appeared to extend southward in the midst of  the groups of ridges composing Macquarie and Peel's ranges. Coccaparra, a  range very abrupt on the eastern side, appeared to be Macquarie's range  of Oxley, and an elevated extremity of it, near the river, I took to be  Mount Porteous, and of which the local name is Willin.* To the northward  the most remarkable feature was a line of plains similar to those beside  the main channel of the river, and they appeared to border a branch from  it, which extended in a western direction under the base of a small hill  named Murrangong, and far beyond it. The hill on which I stood was the  most perfectly isolated that I had ever seen, low level ground  surrounding it on every side. It consisted of a variety of the same  quartz rock as Wallangome, but contained pebbles of laminated compact  felspar. This hill was abrupt and rocky on the west and north-west sides,  the best ascent being from the south-east.    (*Footnote. Willi, an opossum)    We overtook the party after it had crossed some extensive plains, where  we observed a species of solanum, the berries of which our native guides  gathered and ate.* Overseer Burnett made another search this day on  Coccaparra range for the wild bullocks; the party fell in with a herd but  it kept at a great distance and got off into scrubs. Their bedding places  and paths were numerous, and it thus appeared that the number of these  animals was considerable. We gathered on Coccaparra and Mount Porteous  several bulbous plants of a species quite new to me, the root being very  large. There also we found a remarkable acacia, having long upright  needle-like leaves among which a few small tufts of yellow flowers were  sparingly scattered.** We encamped on a pond of the river named  Burrabadimba, after travelling fifteen miles.
