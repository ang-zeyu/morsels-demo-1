He taught that Nirvana was  not attained by Brahmanical rites, but by individual virtues; and that  punishment is the inevitable result of evil deeds by the inexorable law  of cause and effect.    Buddhism is essentially rationalistic and ethical, while Brahmanism is a  pantheistic tendency to polytheism, and ritualistic even to the most  offensive sacerdotalism. The Brahman reminds me of a Dunstan,--the  Buddhist of a Benedict; the former of the gloomy, spiritual despotism of  the Middle Ages,--the latter of self-denying monasticism in its best  ages. The Brahman is like Thomas Aquinas with his dogmas and  metaphysics; the Buddhist is more like a mediaeval freethinker,  stigmatized as an atheist. The Brahman was so absorbed with his  theological speculation that he took no account of the sufferings of  humanity; the Buddhist was so absorbed with the miseries of man that the  greatest blessing seemed to be entire and endless rest, the cessation of  existence itself,--since existence brought desire, desire sin, and sin  misery. As a religion Buddhism is an absurdity; in fact, it is no  religion at all, only a system of moral philosophy. Its weak points,  practically, are the abuse of philanthropy, its system of organized  idleness and mendicancy, the indifference to thrift and industry, the  multiplication of lazy fraternities and useless retreats, reminding us  of monastic institutions in the days of Chaucer and Luther. The Buddhist  priest is a mendicant and a pauper, clothed in rags, begging his living  from door to door, in which he sees no disgrace and no impropriety.  Buddhism failed to ennoble the daily occupations of life, and produced  drones and idlers and religious vagabonds. In its corruption it lent  itself to idolatry, for the Buddhist temples are filled with hideous  images of all sorts of repulsive deities, although Buddha himself did  not hold to idol worship any more than to the belief in a personal God.    \"Buddhism,\" says the author of its accepted catechism, \"teaches goodness  without a God, existence without a soul, immortality without life,  happiness without a heaven, salvation without a saviour, redemption  without a redeemer, and worship without rites.\" The failure of Buddhism,  both as a philosophy and a religion, is a confirmation of the great  historical fact, that in the ancient Pagan world no efforts of reason  enabled man unaided to arrive at a true--that is, a helpful and  practically elevating--knowledge of deity. Even Buddha, one of the most  gifted and excellent of all the sages who have enlightened the world,  despaired of solving the great mysteries of existence, and turned his  attention to those practical duties of life which seemed to promise a  way of escaping its miseries. He appealed to human consciousness; but  lacking the inspiration and aid which come from a sense of personal  divine influence, Buddhism has failed, on the large scale, to raise its  votaries to higher planes of ethical accomplishment. And hence the  necessity of that new revelation which Jesus declared amid the moral  ruins of a crumbling world, by which alone can the debasing  superstitions of India and the godless materialism of China be replaced  with a vital spirituality,--even as the elaborate mythology of Greece  and Rome gave way before the fervent earnestness of Christian apostles  and martyrs.    It does not belong to my subject to present the condition of Buddhism as  it exists to-day in Thibet, in Siam, in China, in Japan, in Burmah, in  Ceylon, and in various other Eastern countries. It spread by reason of  its sympathy with the poor and miserable, by virtue of its being a great  system of philanthropy and morals which appealed to the consciousness of  the lower classes. Though a proselyting religion it was never a  persecuting one, and is still distinguished, in all its corruption, for  its toleration.          AUTHORITIES.

I have  derived some instruction from Samuel Johnson's bulky and diffuse books,  but more from James Freeman Clarke's Ten Great Religions^ and  Rawlinson's Religions of the Ancient World.          RELIGION OF THE GREEKS AND ROMANS.      CLASSIC MYTHOLOGY.    Religion among the lively and imaginative Greeks took a different form  from that of the Aryan race in India or Persia. However the ideas of  their divinities originated in their relations to the thought and life  of the people, their gods were neither abstractions nor symbols. They  were simply men and women, immortal, yet having a beginning, with  passions and appetites like ordinary mortals. They love, they hate, they  eat, they drink, they have adventures and misfortunes like men,--only  differing from men in the superiority of their gifts, in their  miraculous endowments, in their stupendous feats, in their more than  gigantic size, in their supernal beauty, in their intensified pleasures.  It was not their aim \"to raise mortals to the skies,\" but to enjoy  themselves in feasting and love-making; not even to govern the world,  but to protect their particular worshippers,--taking part and interest  in human quarrels, without reference to justice or right, and without  communicating any great truths for the guidance of mankind.    The religion of Greece consisted of a series of myths,--creations for  the most part of the poets,--and therefore properly called a mythology.  Yet in some respects the gods of Greece resembled those of Phoenicia and  Egypt, being the powers of Nature, and named after the sun, moon, and  planets. Their priests did not form a sacerdotal caste, as in India and  Egypt; they were more like officers of the state, to perform certain  functions or duties pertaining to rites, ceremonies, and sacrifices.  They taught no moral or spiritual truths to the people, nor were they  held in extraordinary reverence. They were not ascetics or enthusiasts;  among them were no great reformers or prophets, as among the sacerdotal  class of the Jews or the Hindus. They had even no sacred books, and  claimed no esoteric knowledge. Nor was their office hereditary. They  were appointed by the rulers of the state, or elected by the people  themselves; they imposed no restraints on the conscience, and apparently  cared little for morals, leaving the people to an unbounded freedom to  act and think for themselves, so far as they did not interfere with  prescribed usages and laws. The real objects of Greek worship were  beauty, grace, and heroic strength. The people worshipped no supreme  creator, no providential governor, no ultimate judge of human actions.  They had no aspirations for heaven and no fear of hell. They did not  feel accountable for their deeds or thoughts or words to an irresistible  Power working for righteousness or truth. They had no religious sense,  apart from wonder or admiration of the glories of Nature, or the good or  evil which might result from the favor or hatred of the divinities  they accepted.    These divinities, moreover, were not manifestations of supreme power and  intelligence, but were creations of the fancy, as they came from popular  legends, or the brains of poets, or the hands of artists, or the  speculations of philosophers. And as everything in Greece was beautiful  and radiant,--the sea, the sky, the mountains, and the valleys,--so was  religion cheerful, seen in all the festivals which took the place of the  Sabbaths and holy-days of more spiritually minded peoples. The  worshippers of the gods danced and played and sported to the sounds of  musical instruments, and revelled in joyous libations, in feasts and  imposing processions,--in whatever would amuse the mind or intoxicate  the senses. The gods were rather unseen companions in pleasures, in  sports, in athletic contests and warlike enterprises, than beings to be  adored for moral excellence or supernal knowledge. \"Heaven was so near  at hand that their own heroes climbed to it and became demigods.\" Every  grove, every fountain, every river, every beautiful spot, had its  presiding deity; while every wonder of Nature,--the sun, the moon, the  stars, the tempest, the thunder, the lightning,--was impersonated as an  awful power for good or evil. To them temples were erected, within which  were their shrines and images in human shape, glistening with gold and  gems, and wrought in every form of grace or strength or beauty, and by  artists of marvellous excellence.    This polytheism of Greece was exceedingly complicated, but was not so  degrading as that of Egypt, since the gods were not represented by the  forms of hideous animals, and the worship of them was not attended by  revolting ceremonies; and yet it was divested of all spiritual  aspirations, and had but little effect on personal struggles for truth  or holiness. It was human and worldly, not lofty nor even reverential,  except among the few who had deep religious wants. One of its  characteristic features was the acknowledged impotence of the gods to  secure future happiness. In fact, the future was generally ignored, and  even immortality was but a dream of philosophers. Men lived not in view  of future rewards and punishments, or future existence at all, but for  the enjoyment of the present; and the gods themselves set the example of  an immoral life. Even Zeus, \"the Father of gods and men,\" to whom  absolute supremacy was ascribed, the work of creation, and all majesty  and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10478"],[0,"Beacon Lights of History, Volume 02: Jewish Heroes and Prophets (#12)"],[1,"written history of which we have record.    And surely what poetry, pathos, and eloquence, what simplicity and  beauty, what rich and varied lessons of human experience, what treasures  of moral wisdom, are revealed in that little book! How sublimely the  poet-prophet narrates the misery of the Fall, and the promised glories  of the Restoration! How concisely the historian compresses the incidents  of patriarchal life, the rise of empires, the fall of cities, the  certitudes of faith, of friendship, and of love! All that is vital in  the history of thousands of years is condensed into a few chapters,--not  dry and barren annals, but descriptions of character, and the unfolding  of emotions and sensibilities, and insight into those principles of  moral government which indicate a superintending Power, creating faith  in a world of sin, and consolation amid the wreck of matter.    Thus when forty more years are passed in study, in literary composition,  in religious meditation, and active duties, in sight of grand and barren  mountains, amid affections and simplicities,--years which must have  familiarized him with every road and cattle-drive and sheep-track, every  hill and peak, every wady and watercourse, every timber-belt and oasis  in the Sinaitic wilderness, through which his providentially trained  military instincts were to safely conduct a vast multitude,--Moses,  still strong and laborious, is fitted for his exalted mission as a  deliverer. And now he is directly called by the voice of God himself,  amid the wonders of the burning bush,--Him whom, thus far, he had, like  Abraham, adored as the Elohim, the God Almighty, but whom henceforth he  recognizes as Jehovah (Jahveh) in His special relations to the Jewish  nation, rather than as the general Deity who unites the attributes  ascribed to Him as the ruler of the universe. Moses quakes before that  awful voice out of the midst of the bush, which commissions him to  deliver his brethren. He is no longer bold, impetuous, impatient, but  timid and modest. Long study and retirement from the busy haunts of men  have made him self-distrustful. He replies to the great _I Am_, \"Who am  I, that _I_ should bring forth the Children of Israel out of Egypt?  Behold, I am not eloquent; they will not believe me, nor hearken to my  voice.\" In spite of the miracle of the rod, Moses obeys reluctantly, and  Aaron, his elder brother, is appointed as his spokesman.    Armed with the mysterious wonder-working rod, at length Moses and Aaron,  as representatives of the Jewish people, appear in the presence of  Pharaoh, and in the name of Jehovah request permission for Israel to go  and hold a feast in the wilderness. They do not demand emancipation or  emigration, which would of course be denied. I cannot dwell on the  haughty scepticism and obdurate hardness of the King--\"Who is Jehovah,  that I should obey _his_ voice?\"--the renewed persecution of the  Hebrews, the successive plagues and calamities sent upon Egypt, which  the magicians could not explain, and the final extorted and unwilling  consent of Pharaoh to permit Israel to worship the God of Moses in the  wilderness, lest greater evils should befall him than the destruction of  the first-born throughout the land.    The deliverance of a nation of slaves is at last, it would seem,  miraculously effected; and then begins the third period of the life of  Moses, as the leader and governor of these superstitious, sensual,  idolatrous, degraded slaves. Then begin the real labors and trials of  Moses; for the people murmur, and are consumed with fears as soon as  they have crossed the sea, and find themselves in the wilderness. And  their unbelief and impatience are scarcely lessened by the tremendous  miracle of the submersion of the pursuing host, and all successive  miracles,--the mysterious manna, the pillar of cloud and of fire, the  smitten rock at Horeb, and the still more impressive and awful  wonders of Sinai.    The guidance of the Israelites during these forty years in the  wilderness is marked by transcendent ability on the part of Moses, and  by the most disgraceful conduct on the part of the Israelites. They are  forgetful of mercies, ungrateful, rebellious, childish in their  hankerings for a country where they had been more oppressed than Spartan  Helots, idolatrous, and superstitious. They murmur for flesh to eat;  they make golden calves to worship; they seek a new leader when Moses is  longer on the Mount than they expect. When any new danger threatens they  lay the blame on Moses; they even foolishly regret that they had not  died in Egypt.    Obviously such a people were not fit for freedom, or even for the  conquest of the promised land. They were as timid and cowardly as they  were rebellious. Even the picked men sent out to explore Canaan, with  the exception of Caleb and Joshua, reported nations of giants impossible  to subdue. A new generation must arise, disciplined by forty years'  experience, made hardy and strong by exposure and suffering. Yet what  nation, in the world's history, ever improved so much in forty years?  What ruler ever did so much for a people in a single reign? This abject  race of slaves in forty years was transformed into a nation of valiant  warriors, made subject to law and familiar with the fundamental  principles of civilization. What a marvellous change, effected by the  genius and wisdom of one man, in communion with Almighty power!    But the distinguishing labor of Moses during these forty years, by which  he linked his name with all subsequent ages, and became the greatest  benefactor of mind the world has seen until Christ, was his system of  Jurisprudence. It is this which especially demands our notice, and hence  will form the main subject of this lecture.    In reviewing the Mosaic legislation, we notice both those ordinances  which are based on immutable truth for the rule of all nations to the  end of time, and those prescribed for the peculiar situation and  exigencies of the Jews as a theocratic state, isolated from  other nations.    The moral code of Moses, by far the most important and universally  accepted, rests on the fundamental principles of theology and morality.  How lofty, how impressive, how solemn this code! How it appeals at once  to the consciousness of all minds in every age and nation, producing  convictions that no sophistry can weaken, binding the conscience with  irresistible and terrific bonds,--those immortal Ten Commandments,  engraven on the two tables of stone, and preserved in the holy and  innermost sanctuary of the Jews, yet reappearing in all their  literature, accepted and reaffirmed by Christ, entering into the  religious system of every nation that has received them, and forming the  cardinal principles of all theological belief! Yet it was by Moses that  these Commandments came. He is the first, the favored man, commissioned  by God to declare to the world, clearly and authoritatively, His supreme  power and majesty, whom alone all nations and tribes and people are to  worship to remotest generations. In it he fearfully exposes the sin of  idolatry, to which all nations are prone,--the one sin which the  Almighty visits with such dreadful penalties, since this involves, and  implies logically, rebellion against Him, the supreme ruler of the  universe, and disloyalty to Him as a personal sovereign, in whatever  form this idolatry may appear, whether in graven images of tutelary  deities, or in the worship of Nature (ever blind and indefinite), or in  the exaltation of self, in the varied search for pleasure, ambition, or  wealth, to which the debased soul bows down with grovelling instincts,  and in the pursuit of which the soul forgets its higher destiny and its  paramount obligations. Moses is the first to expose with terrific force  and solemn earnestness this universal tendency to the oblivion of the  One God amid the temptations, the pleasures, and the glories of the  world, and the certain displeasure of the universal sovereign which must  follow, as seen in the fall of empires and the misery of individuals  from his time to ours, the uniform doom of people and nations, whatever  the special form of idolatry, whenever it reaches a peculiar fulness and  development,--the ultimate law of all decline and ruin, from which there  is no escape, \"for the Lord God is a jealous God, visiting the  iniquities of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth  generation.\" So sacred and awful is this controlling Deity, that it is  made a cardinal sin even to utter His name in vain, in levity or  blasphemy. In order also to keep Him before the minds of men, a day is  especially appointed--one in seven--which it is the bounden duty as well  as privilege of all generations to keep with peculiar sanctity,--a day  of rest from labor as well as of adoration; an entirely new institution,  which no Pagan nation, and no other ancient nation, ever recognized.  After thus laying solemn injunctions upon all men to render supreme  allegiance to this personal God,--for we can find no better word,  although Matthew Arnold calls it \"the Power which maketh for  righteousness,\"--Moses presents the duties of men to each other, chiefly  those which pertain to the abstaining from injuries they are most  tempted to commit, extending to the innermost feelings of the heart, for  \"thou shalt not covet anything which is thy neighbor's;\" thus covering,  in a few sentences, the primal obligations of mankind to God and to  society, afterward expanded by a greater teacher into the more  comprehensive law of Love, which is to bind together mortals on earth,  as it binds together immortals in heaven.    All Christian nations have accepted these Ten Commandments, even  Mohammedan nations, as appealing to the universal conscience,--not a  mere Jewish code, but a primary law, susceptible of boundless  obligation, never to be abrogated; a direct"]]]
