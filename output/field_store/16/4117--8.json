One moment he was about as dangerous as an eighteen-year-old  girl. The next second he was like a panther that's tasted blood.  That's all there was to it, Terry. After the first blow, he was all  over the chief. You know Silent's a bad man with his hands?\"    \"I guess we all know that,\" said Jordan, with a significant smile.    \"Well,\" said Haines, \"he was like a baby in the hands of Barry. I  don't like to talk about it--none of us do. It makes the flesh creep.\"    There was a loud crackling among the underbrush several hundred yards  away. It drew closer and louder.    \"Start up your works agin, will you, Bill?\" called Silent. \"Here comes  Shorty Rhinehart, an' he's overdue.\"    In a moment Shorty swung from his horse and joined the group. He  gained his nickname from his excessive length, being taller by an inch  or two than Jim Silent himself, but what he gained in height he lost  in width. Even his face was monstrously long, and marked with such sad  lines that the favourite name of \"Shorty\" was affectionately varied to  \"Sour-face\" or \"Calamity.\" Silent went to him at once.    \"You seen Hardy?\" he asked.    \"I sure did,\" said Rhinehart, \"an' it's the last time I'll make that  trip to him, you can lay to that.\"    \"Did he give you the dope?\"    \"No.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"I jest want you to know that this here's my last trip to Elkhead--on  _any_ business.\"    \"Why?\"    \"I passed three marshals on the street, an' I knew them all. They was  my friends, formerly. One of them was--\"    \"What did they do?\"    \"I waved my hand to them, glad an' familiar. They jest grunted. One of  them, he looked up an' down the street, an' seein' that no one was in  sight, he come up to me an' without shakin' hands he says: 'I'm some  surprised to see you in Elkhead, Shorty.' 'Why,' says I, 'the town's  all right, ain't it?' 'It's all right,' he says, 'but you'd find it a  pile more healthier out on the range.'\"    \"What in hell did he mean by that?\" growled Silent.    \"He simply meant that they're beginnin' to think a lot more about  us than they used to. We've been pullin' too many jobs the last six  months.\"    \"You've said all that before, Shorty. I'm runnin' this gang. Tell me  about Hardy.\"    \"I'm comin' to that. I went into the Wells Fargo office down by the  railroad, an' the clerk sent me back to find Hardy in the back room,  where he generally is. When he seen me he changed colour. I'd jest  popped my head through the door an' sung out: 'Hello, Hardy, how's the  boy?' He jumped up from the desk an' sung out so's his clerk in the  outside room could hear: 'How are you, lad?' an' he pulled me quick  into the room an' locked the door behind me.    \"'Now what in hell have you come to Elkhead for?' says he.    \"'For a drink' says I, never battin' an eye.    \"'You've come a damn long ways,' says he.    \"'Sure,' says I, 'that's one reason I'm so dry. Will you liquor, pal?'    \"He looked like he needed a drink, all right. He begun loosening his  shirt collar.    \"'Thanks, but I ain't drinkin', says he. 'Look here, Shorty, are you  loco to come ridin' into Elkhead this way?'    \"'I'm jest beginnin' to think maybe I am,' says I.    \"'Shorty,' he says in a whisper, 'they're beginnin' to get wise to the  whole gang--includin' me.'    \"'Take a brace,' says I. 'They ain't got a thing on you, Hardy.'    \"'That don't keep 'em from thinkin' a hell of a pile,' says he, 'an'  I tell you, Shorty, I'm jest about through with the whole works. It  ain't worth it--not if there was a million in it. Everybody is gettin'  wise to Silent, an' the rest of you. Pretty soon hell's goin' to bust  loose.'    \"'You've been sayin' that for two years,' says I.    \"He stopped an' looked at me sort of thoughtful an' pityin'. Then he  steps up close to me an' whispers in that voice: 'D'you know who's on  Silent's trail now? Eh?'    \"'No, an' I don't give a damn,' says I, free an' careless.    \"'Tex Calder!' says he.\"    Silent started violently, and his hand moved instinctively to his  six-gun.    \"Did he say Tex Calder?\"    \"He said no less,\" answered Shorty Rhinehart, and waited to see his  news take effect. Silent stood with head bowed, scowling.    \"Tex Calder's a fool,\" he said at last. \"He ought to know better'n to  take to _my_ trail.\"    \"He's fast with his gun,\" suggested Shorty.    \"Don't I know that?\" said Silent. \"If Alvarez, an' Bradley, an'  Hunter, an' God knows how many more could come up out of their graves,  they'd tell jest how quick he _is_ with a six-gun. But I'm the one man  on the range that's faster.\"    Shorty was eloquently mute.    \"I ain't askin' you to take my word for it,\" said Jim Silent. \"Now  that he's after me, I'm glad of it. It had to come some day. The  mountains ain't big enough for both of us to go rangin' forever. We  had to lock horns some day. An' I say, God help Tex Calder!\"    He turned abruptly to the rest of the men.    \"Boys, I got somethin' to tell you that Shorty jest heard. Tex Calder  is after us.\"    There came a fluent outburst of cursing.    Silent went on: \"I know jest how slick Calder is. I'm bettin' on  my draw to be jest the necessary half a hair quicker. He may die  shootin'. I don't lay no bets that I c'n nail him before he gets his  iron out of its leather, but I say he'll be shootin' blind when he  dies. Is there any one takin' that bet?\"    His eyes challenged them one after another. Their glances travelled  past Silent as if they were telling over and over to themselves the  stories of those many men to whom Tex Calder had played the part of  Fate. The leader turned back to Shorty Rhinehart.    \"Now tell me what he had to say about the coin.\"    \"Hardy says the shipment's delayed. He don't know how long.\"    \"How'd it come to be delayed?\"    \"He figures that Wells Fargo got a hunch that Silent was layin' for  the train that was to carry it.\"    \"Will he let us know when it _does_ come through?\"    \"I asked him, an' he jest hedged. He's quitting on us cold.\"    \"I was a fool to send you, Shorty. I'm goin' myself, an' if Hardy  don't come through to me--\"    He broke off and announced to the rest of his gang that he intended to  make the journey to Elkhead. He told Haines, who in such cases usually  acted as lieutenant, to take charge of the camp. Then he saddled his  roan.    In the very act of pulling up the cinch of his saddle, Silent stopped  short, turned, and raised a hand for quiet. The rest were instantly  still. Hal Purvis leaned his weazened face towards the ground. In this  manner it was sometimes possible to detect far-off sounds which to one  erect would be inaudible. In a moment, however, he straightened up,  shaking his head.    \"What is it?\" whispered Haines.    \"Shut up,\" muttered Silent, and the words were formed by the motion of  his lips rather than through any sound. \"That damned whistling again.\"    Every face changed. At a rustling in a near-by willow, Terry Jordan  started and then cursed softly to himself. That broke the spell.    \"It's the whisperin' of the willows,\" said Purvis.    \"You lie,\" said Silent hoarsely. \"I hear the sound growing closer.\"    \"Barry is dead,\" said Haines.    Silent whipped out his revolver--and then shoved it back into the  holster.    \"Stand by me, boys,\" he pleaded. \"It's his ghost come to haunt me! You  can't hear it, because he ain't come for you.\"    They stared at him with a fascinated horror.    \"How do you know it's him?\" asked Shorty Rhinehart.    \"There ain't no sound in the whole world like it. It's a sort of cross  between the singing of a bird an' the wailin' of the wind. It's the  ghost of Whistlin' Dan.\"    The tall roan raised his head and whinnied softly. It was an unearthly  effect--as if the animal heard the sound which was inaudible to all  but his master. It changed big Jim Silent into a quavering coward.  Here were five practised fighters who feared nothing between heaven  and hell, but what could they avail him against a bodiless spirit? The  whistling stopped. He breathed again, but only for a moment.    It began again, and this time much louder and nearer. Surely the  others must hear it now, or else it was certainly a ghost. The men sat  with dilated eyes for an instant, and then Hal Purvis cried, \"I heard  it, chief! If it's a ghost, it's hauntin' me too!\"    Silent cursed loudly in his relief.    \"It ain't a ghost. It's Whistlin' Dan himself. An' Terry Jordan has  been carryin' us lies! What in hell do you mean by it?\"    \"I ain't been carryin' you lies,\" said Jordan, hotly. \"I told you  what I heard. I didn't never say that there was any one seen his dead  body!\"    The whistling began to die out. A babble of conjecture and exclamation  broke out, but Jim Silent, still sickly white around the mouth, swung  up into the saddle.    \"That Whistlin' Dan I'm leavin' to you, Haines,\" he called. \"I've had  his blood onct, an' if I meet him agin there's goin' to be another  notch filed into my shootin' iron.\"          CHAPTER X      THE STRENGTH OF WOMEN    He rode swiftly into the dark of the willows, and the lack of noise  told that he was picking his way carefully among the bended branches.    \"It seems to me,\" said Terry Jordan, \"which I'm not suggestin'  anything--but it seems to me that the chief was in a considerable  hurry to leave the camp.\"    \"He was,\" said Hal Purvis, \"an' if you seen that play in Morgan's  place you wouldn't be wonderin' why. If I was the chief I'd do the  same.\"    \"Me speakin' personal,\" remarked Shorty Rhinehart, \"I ain't layin' out  to be no man-eater like the chief, but I ain't seen the man that'd  make me take to the timbers that way. I don't noways expect there _is_  such a man!\"    \"Shorty,\" said Haines calmly, \"we all knows that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10890"],[0,"Dio's Rome, Volume 5 (#12)"],[1,"eight. After doing this he appeared as charioteer.--A certain  Larcius, a Lydian, approached him with an offer of twenty-five myriads if  he would play and sing for them. Nero would not take the money, disdaining  to do anything for pay; and so Tigillinus collected it, as the price of  not putting Larcius to death. However, the emperor did appear on the stage  with an accompanied song and he also gave a tragedy. In the equestrian  contests he was seldom absent, and sometimes he would voluntarily let  himself be defeated in order to make it more credible that he really won  at other times.    Dio 62nd Book: \"And he inflicted uncounted woes on many cities.\"    [Sidenote:--22--] This was the kind of life Nero led, this was the way he  ruled. I shall narrate also how he was put down and driven from his  throne.    While Nero was still in Greece, the Jews revolted openly and he sent  Vespasian against them. The inhabitants of Britain and of Gaul, likewise,  oppressed by the taxes, experienced an even keener distress, which added  fuel to the already kindled fire of their indignation.    --There was a Gaul named Gaius Julius Vindex [an Aquitanian], descended  from the native royal race and on his father's side entitled to rank as a  Roman senator. He was strong of body, had an intelligent mind, was skilled  in warfare and was full of daring for every enterprise. [He was to the  greatest degree a lover of freedom and was ambitious; and he stood at the  head of the Gauls.] Now this Vindex made an assembly of the Gauls, who had  suffered much during the numerous forced levies of money, and were still  suffering at Nero's hands. And ascending a tribunal he delivered a long  and detailed speech against Nero, saying that they ought to revolt from  the emperor and join him in an attack [upon him],--\"because,\" said he, \"he  has despoiled the whole Roman world, because he has destroyed all the  flower of their senate, because he debauched and likewise killed his  mother, and does not preserve even the semblance of sovereignty. Murders,  seizures and outrages have often been committed and by many other persons:  but how may one find words to describe the remainder of his conduct as it  deserves? I have seen, my friends and allies,--believe me,--I have seen  that man (if he is a man, who married Sporus and was given in marriage to  Pythagoras) in the arena of the theatre and in the orchestra, sometimes  with the zither, the loose tunic, the cothurnus, [Footnote: The two kinds  of footwear mentioned here appear in the Greek as _chothornos_ and  _embates_ respectively. These words are often synonymous, and both  may refer, as a rule, to _high_ boots. In the present passage,  however, some kind of contrast is evidently intended, and the most  acceptable solution of the question is that given by Sturz, in his  edition, who says that the _chothornos_ seems to have been used by  Nero only in singing, whereas he wore the _embates_ (as also the  mask) while acting.] sometimes with wooden shoes [Footnote: see previous  footnote] and mask. I have often heard him sing, I have heard him make  proclamations, I have heard him perform tragedy. I have seen him in  chains, I have seen him dragged about, pregnant, bearing children, going  through all the situations of mythology, by speech, by being addressed, by  being acted upon, by acting. Who, then, will call such a person Caesar and  emperor and Augustus? Let no one for any consideration so abuse those  sacred titles. They were held by Augustus and by Claudius. This fellow  might most properly be termed Thyestes and Oedipus, Alcmeon and Orestes.  These are the persons he represents on the stage and it is these titles  that he has assumed rather than the others. Therefore now at length rise  against him: come to the succor of yourselves and of the Romans; liberate  the entire world!\"    [Sidenote:--23--] Such words falling from the lips of Vindex met with  entire approval from all. Vindex was not working to get the imperial  office for himself but chose Servius Sulpicius Galba for that position:  this man was distinguished for his upright behavior and knowledge of war,  was governor of Spain, and had a not inconsiderable force. He was also  nominated by the soldiers as emperor.    It is stated that Nero having offered by proclamation  two hundred and fifty myriads to the person who should kill Vindex, the  latter when he heard of it remarked: \"The person who kills Nero and brings  his head to me may take mine in return.\" That was the sort of man Vindex  was.    [Sidenote:--24--] Rufus, governor of Germany, set out to make war on  Vindex; but when he reached Vesontio he sat down to besiege the city, for  the alleged reason that it had not received him. Vindex came against him  to the aid of the city and encamped not far off. They then sent messages  back and forth to each other and finally held a conference together at  which no one else was present and made a mutual agreement,--against Nero,  as it was thought. After this Vindex set his army in motion for the  apparent purpose of occupying the town: and the soldiers of Rufus,  becoming aware of their approach, and thinking the force was marching  straight against them, set out without being ordered to oppose their  progress. They fell upon the advancing troop while the men were off their  guard and in disarray, and so cut down great numbers of them. Vindex  seeing this was afflicted with so great grief that he slew himself. For he  felt, besides, at odds with Heaven itself, in that he had not been able to  attain his goal in an undertaking of so great magnitude, involving the  overthrow of Nero and the liberation of the Romans.    This is the truth of the matter. Many afterwards inflicted wounds on his  body, and so gave currency to the erroneous supposition that they had  themselves killed him.    [Sidenote:--25--] Rufus mourned deeply his demise, but refused to accept  the office of emperor, although his soldiers frequently obtained it. He  was an energetic man and had a large, wide-awake body of troops. His  soldiers tore down and shattered the image of Nero and called their  general Caesar and Augustus. When he would not heed them, one of the  soldiers thereupon quickly inscribed these words on one of his standards.  He erased the terms, however, and after a great deal of trouble brought  the men to order and persuaded them to submit the question [Footnote:  [Greek: ta pragmata] supplied by Polak.] to the senate and the people. It  is hard to say whether this was merely because he did not deem it right  for the soldiers to bestow the supreme authority upon any one (for he  declared this to be the prerogative of the senate and the people), or  because he was entirely highminded and felt no personal desire for the  imperial power, to secure which others were willing to do everything.    [Sidenote:--26--] [Nero was informed of the Vindex episode as he was in  Naples viewing the gymnastic contest just after luncheon. He was naturally  far from sorry, and leaping from his seat vied in prowess with some  athlete. He did not hurry back to Rome but merely sent a letter to the  senate, in which he asked them to regard leniently his non-arrival,  because he had a sore throat, implying that when he did come he wanted to  sing to them. And he continued to devote the same care and attention to  his voice, to his songs, and to the zither tunes, not only just then but  also subsequently: so he would not try a tone of his intended program. If  he was at any time compelled by circumstances to make some exclamation,  yet somebody, reminding him that he was to appear as citharoedist, would  straightway check and control him.    In general he still behaved in his accustomed manner and  he was pleased with the news brought him because he had been expecting in  any event to overcome Vindex and because he thought he had now secured a  justifiable ground for money-getting and murders. He enjoyed the same  degree of luxury; and upon the completion and adornment of the heroum of  Sabina he gave it a brilliant dedication, taking care to have inscribed  upon it: \"The Women have built This to Sabina, the Goddess Venus.\" And the  writing told the truth: for the building had been constructed with money  of which a great part had been stolen from women. Also he had his numerous  little jokes, of which I shall mention only one, omitting the rest.] One  night he suddenly summoned in haste the foremost senators and knights,  apparently to make some communication to them regarding the political  situation. When they were assembled, he said: \"I have discovered a way by  which the water organ\"--I must write exactly what he said--\"will produce a  greater and more harmonious volume of sound.\" Such were his jokes about  this period. And little did he reck that both sets of doors, those of the  monument and those of the bedchamber of Augustus, opened of their own  accord in one and the same night, or that at Albanum it rained so much  blood that rivers of it flowed over the land, or that the sea retreated a  good distance from Egypt and covered a large portion of Lycia.  [Sidenote:--27--] But when he heard about Galba's being proclaimed emperor  by the soldiers and about the desertion of Rufus, he fell into great fear:  he made preparations in person at Rome and he sent against the rebels  Rubrius Gallus and some others.    On learning that Petronius, [Footnote: _P. Petronius Turpilianus_.]  whom he had sent ahead against the rebels with the larger portion of the  army, also favored the cause of Galba, Nero reposed no further hope in  arms.    Being abandoned by all without exception he began forming plans to kill  the senators, burn the city to the ground, and sail to Alexandria. He  dropped this hint in regard to his future course: \"Even though we be  driven from our empire, yet this little artistic gift of ours shall  support us there.\" To such a pitch of folly had he"]]]
