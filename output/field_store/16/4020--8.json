And             the king sware unto him.    10:019:024 And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king,             and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor             washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the             day he came again in peace.    10:019:025 And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the             king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou             with me, Mephibosheth?    10:019:026 And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for             thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride             thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant is lame.    10:019:027 And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but             my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is             good in thine eyes.    10:019:028 For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord             the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did             eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry             any more unto the king?    10:019:029 And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy             matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.    10:019:030 And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all,             forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his             own house.    10:019:031 And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went             over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.    10:019:032 Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old:             and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at             Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.    10:019:033 And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and             I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem.    10:019:034 And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live,             that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?    10:019:035 I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between             good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I             drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and             singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a             burden unto my lord the king?    10:019:036 Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king:             and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?    10:019:037 Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die             in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and             of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over             with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto             thee.    10:019:038 And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I             will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and             whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.    10:019:039 And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was             come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he             returned unto his own place.    10:019:040 Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him:             and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half             the people of Israel.    10:019:041 And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said             unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen             thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and             all David's men with him, over Jordan?    10:019:042 And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because             the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for             this matter? have we eaten at all of the king's cost? or hath             he given us any gift?    10:019:043 And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We             have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in             David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice             should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the             words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the             men of Israel.    10:020:001 And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was             Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet,             and said, We have no part in David, neither have we             inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O             Israel.    10:020:002 So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed             Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their             king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.    10:020:003 And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took             the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the             house, and put them in ward, and fed them, but went not in             unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death,             living in widowhood.    10:020:004 Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah             within three days, and be thou here present.    10:020:005 So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried             longer than the set time which he had appointed him.    10:020:006 And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri             do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord's             servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities,             and escape us.    10:020:007 And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites,             and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out             of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.    10:020:008 When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa             went before them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was             girded unto him, and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened             upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it             fell out.    10:020:009 And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother? And             Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.    10:020:010 But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand:             so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his             bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died.             So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of             Bichri.    10:020:011 And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that             favoureth Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after             Joab.    10:020:012 And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And             when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed             Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon             him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.    10:020:013 When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on             after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.    10:020:014 And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to             Bethmaachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered             together, and went also after him.    10:020:015 And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and             they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the             trench: and all the people that were with Joab battered the             wall, to throw it down.    10:020:016 Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I             pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with             thee.    10:020:017 And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou             Joab? And he answered, I am he. Then she said unto him, Hear             the words of thine handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.    10:020:018 Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time,             saying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they             ended the matter.    10:020:019 I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel:             thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why             wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?    10:020:020 And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that             I should swallow up or destroy.    10:020:021 The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the             son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the             king, even against David: deliver him only, and I will depart             from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head             shall be thrown to thee over the wall.    10:020:022 Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And             they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it             out to Joab. And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the             city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem             unto the king.    10:020:023 Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son             of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:    10:020:024 And Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of             Ahilud"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8018"],[0,"The Bible, King James version, Book 18: Job (#11)"],[1," his eyes from the righteous: but with kings             are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever,             and they are exalted.    18:036:008 And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of             affliction;    18:036:009 Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that             they have exceeded.    18:036:010 He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that             they return from iniquity.    18:036:011 If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in             prosperity, and their years in pleasures.    18:036:012 But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they             shall die without knowledge.    18:036:013 But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when             he bindeth them.    18:036:014 They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.    18:036:015 He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their             ears in oppression.    18:036:016 Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a             broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which             should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.    18:036:017 But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment             and justice take hold on thee.    18:036:018 Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his             stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.    18:036:019 Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of             strength.    18:036:020 Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.    18:036:021 Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen             rather than affliction.    18:036:022 Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?    18:036:023 Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast             wrought iniquity?    18:036:024 Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.    18:036:025 Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.    18:036:026 Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the             number of his years be searched out.    18:036:027 For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain             according to the vapour thereof:    18:036:028 Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.    18:036:029 Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the             noise of his tabernacle?    18:036:030 Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the             bottom of the sea.    18:036:031 For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in             abundance.    18:036:032 With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to             shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.    18:036:033 The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also             concerning the vapour.    18:037:001 At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his             place.    18:037:002 Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that             goeth out of his mouth.    18:037:003 He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto             the ends of the earth.    18:037:004 After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his             excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.    18:037:005 God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth             he, which we cannot comprehend.    18:037:006 For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to             the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.    18:037:007 He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his             work.    18:037:008 Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.    18:037:009 Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the             north.    18:037:010 By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the             waters is straitened.    18:037:011 Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth             his bright cloud:    18:037:012 And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do             whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in             the earth.    18:037:013 He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his             land, or for mercy.    18:037:014 Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the             wondrous works of God.    18:037:015 Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of             his cloud to shine?    18:037:016 Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous             works of him which is perfect in knowledge?    18:037:017 How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the             south wind?    18:037:018 Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as             a molten looking glass?    18:037:019 Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our             speech by reason of darkness.    18:037:020 Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he             shall be swallowed up.    18:037:021 And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds:             but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.    18:037:022 Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible             majesty.    18:037:023 Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent             in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will             not afflict.    18:037:024 Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise             of heart.    18:038:001 Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,    18:038:002 Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?    18:038:003 Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee,             and answer thou me.    18:038:004 Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?             declare, if thou hast understanding.    18:038:005 Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who             hath stretched the line upon it?    18:038:006 Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid             the corner stone thereof;    18:038:007 When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God             shouted for joy?    18:038:008 Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if             it had issued out of the womb?    18:038:009 When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness             a swaddlingband for it,    18:038:010 And brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors,    18:038:011 And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here             shall thy proud waves be stayed?    18:038:012 Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the             dayspring to know his place;    18:038:013 That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the             wicked might be shaken out of it?

or hast thou             walked in the search of the depth?    18:038:017 Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou             seen the doors of the shadow of death?    18:038:018 Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou             knowest it all.    18:038:019 Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness,             where is the place thereof,    18:038:020 That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that             thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?    18:038:021 Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born? or because the             number of thy days is great?    18:038:022 Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou             seen the treasures of the hail,    18:038:023 Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the             day of battle and war?    18:038:024 By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the east             wind upon the earth?    18:038:025 Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters,             or a way for the lightning of thunder;    18:038:026 To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the             wilderness, wherein there is no man;    18:038:027 To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud             of the tender herb to spring forth?    18:038:028 Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?    18:038:029 Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven,             who hath gendered it?    18:038:030 The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep             is frozen.    18:038:031 Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the             bands of Orion?    18:038:032 Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou             guide Arcturus with his sons?    18:038:033 Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the             dominion thereof in the earth?    18:038:034 Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of             waters may cover thee?    18:038:035 Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go and say unto             thee, Here we are?    18:038:036 Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given             understanding to the heart?    18:038:037 Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the             bottles of heaven,    18:038:038 When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast             together?    18:038:039 Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of             the young lions,    18:038:040 When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie             in wait?"]]]
