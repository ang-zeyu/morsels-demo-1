Nor was  he tempted, in the pride of success, to term that an expedition or a  victory; which was only bridling the vanquished; nor even to announce  his success in laureate despatches. [88] But this concealment of his  glory served to augment it; since men were led to entertain a high idea  of the grandeur of his future views, when such important services were  passed over in silence.    19. Well acquainted with the temper of the province, and taught by the  experience of former governors how little proficiency had been made  by arms, when success was followed by injuries, he next undertook to  eradicate the causes of war. And beginning with himself, and those next  to him, he first laid restrictions upon his own household, a task no  less arduous to most governors than the administration of the province.  He suffered no public business to pass through the hands of his slaves  or freedmen. In admitting soldiers into regular service, [89] to  attendance about his person, he was not influenced by private favor, or  the recommendation or solicitation of the centurions, but considered the  best men as likely to prove the most faithful. He would know everything;  but was content to let some things pass unnoticed. [90] He could pardon  small faults, and use severity to great ones; yet did not always punish,  but was frequently satisfied with penitence. He chose rather to confer  offices and employments upon such as would not offend, than to  condemn those who had offended. The augmentation [91] of tributes and  contributions he mitigated by a just and equal assessment, abolishing  those private exactions which were more grievous to be borne than the  taxes themselves. For the inhabitants had been compelled in mockery to  sit by their own locked-up granaries, to buy corn needlessly, and to  sell it again at a stated price. Long and difficult journeys had also  been imposed upon them; for the several districts, instead of being  allowed to supply the nearest winter quarters, were forced to carry  their corn to remote and devious places; by which means, what was easy  to be procured by all, was converted into an article of gain to a few.    20. By suppressing these abuses in the first year of his administration,  he established a favorable idea of peace, which, through the negligence  or oppression of his predecessors, had been no less dreaded than war.  At the return of summer [92] he assembled his army. On their march, he  commended the regular and orderly, and restrained the stragglers; he  marked out the encampments, [93] and explored in person the estuaries  and forests. At the same time he perpetually harassed the enemy by  sudden incursions; and, after sufficiently alarming them, by an interval  of forbearance, he held to their view the allurements of peace. By  this management, many states, which till that time had asserted their  independence, were now induced to lay aside their animosity, and to  deliver hostages. These districts were surrounded with castles and  forts, disposed with so much attention and judgment, that no part of  Britain, hitherto new to the Roman arms, escaped unmolested.    21. The succeeding winter was employed in the most salutary measures.  In order, by a taste of pleasures, to reclaim the natives from that rude  and unsettled state which prompted them to war, and reconcile them to  quiet and tranquillity, he incited them, by private instigations  and public encouragements, to erect temples, courts of justice, and  dwelling-houses. He bestowed commendations upon those who were prompt  in complying with his intentions, and reprimanded such as were dilatory;  thus promoting a spirit of emulation which had all the force of  necessity. He was also attentive to provide a liberal education for the  sons of their chieftains, preferring the natural genius of the Britons  to the attainments of the Gauls; and his attempts were attended with  such success, that they who lately disdained to make use of the Roman  language, were now ambitious of becoming eloquent. Hence the Roman habit  began to be held in honor, and the toga was frequently worn. At length  they gradually deviated into a taste for those luxuries which stimulate  to vice; porticos, and baths, and the elegancies of the table; and this,  from their inexperience, they termed politeness, whilst, in reality, it  constituted a part of their slavery.    22. The military expeditions of the third year [94] discovered new  nations to the Romans, and their ravages extended as far as the estuary  of the Tay. [95] The enemies were thereby struck with such terror that  they did not venture to molest the army though harassed by violent  tempests; so that they had sufficient opportunity for the erection of  fortresses. [96] Persons of experience remarked, that no general had  ever shown greater skill in the choice of advantageous situations than  Agricola; for not one of his fortified posts was either taken by storm,  or surrendered by capitulation. The garrisons made frequent sallies;  for they were secured against a blockade by a year's provision in their  stores. Thus the winter passed without alarm, and each garrison proved  sufficient for its own defence; while the enemy, who were generally  accustomed to repair the losses of the summer by the successes of the  winter, now equally unfortunate in both seasons, were baffled and driven  to despair. In these transactions, Agricola never attempted to arrogate  to himself the glory of others; but always bore an impartial testimony  to the meritorious actions of his officers, from the centurion to the  commander of a legion. He was represented by some as rather harsh  in reproof; as if the same disposition which made him affable to the  deserving, had inclined him to austerity towards the worthless. But  his anger left no relics behind; his silence and reserve were not to  be dreaded; and he esteemed it more honorable to show marks of open  displeasure, than to entertain secret hatred.    23. The fourth summer [97] was spent in securing the country which had  been overrun; and if the valor of the army and the glory of the Roman  name had permitted it, our conquests would have found a limit within  Britain itself. For the tides of the opposite seas, flowing very far up  the estuaries of Clota and Bodotria, [98] almost intersect the country;  leaving only a narrow neck of land, which was then defended by a  chain of forts. [99] Thus all the territory on this side was held in  subjection, and the remaining enemies were removed, as it were, into  another island.    24. In the fifth campaign, [100] Agricola, crossing over in the first  ship, [101] subdued, by frequent and successful engagements, several  nations till then unknown; and stationed troops in that part of Britain  which is opposite to Ireland, rather with a view to future advantage,  than from any apprehension of danger from that quarter. For the  possession of Ireland, situated between Britain and Spain, and  lying commodiously to the Gallic sea, [102] would have formed a very  beneficial connection between the most powerful parts of the empire.  This island is less than Britain, but larger than those of our sea.  [103] Its soil, climate, and the manners and dispositions of its  inhabitants, are little different from those of Britain. Its ports  and harbors are better known, from the concourse of merchants for the  purposes of commerce. Agricola had received into his protection one  of its petty kings, who had been expelled by a domestic sedition; and  detained him, under the semblance of friendship, till an occasion should  offer of making use of him. I have frequently heard him assert, that  a single legion and a few auxiliaries would be sufficient entirely to  conquer Ireland and keep it in subjection; and that such an event would  also have contributed to restrain the Britons, by awing them with the  prospect of the Roman arms all around them, and, as it were, banishing  liberty from their sight.    25. In the summer which began the sixth year [104] of Agricola's  administration, extending his views to the countries situated beyond  Bodotria, [105] as a general insurrection of the remoter nations was  apprehended, and the enemy's army rendered marching unsafe, he caused  the harbors to be explored by his fleet, which, now first acting in aid  of the land-forces gave the formidable spectacle of war at once pushed  on by sea and land. The cavalry, infantry, and marines were frequently  mingled in the same camp, and recounted with mutual pleasure their  several exploits and adventures; comparing, in the boastful language of  military men, the dark recesses of woods and mountains, with the  horrors of waves and tempests; and the land and enemy subdued, with  the conquered ocean. It was also discovered from the captives, that the  Britons had been struck with consternation at the view of the fleet,  conceiving the last refuge of the vanquished to be cut off, now the  secret retreats of their seas were disclosed. The various inhabitants of  Caledonia immediately took up arms, with great preparations, magnified,  however, by report, as usual where the truth is unknown; and by  beginning hostilities, and attacking our fortresses, they inspired  terror as daring to act offensively; insomuch that some persons,  disguising their timidity under the mask of prudence, were for instantly  retreating on this side the firth, and relinquishing the country rather  than waiting to be driven out. Agricola, in the meantime, being informed  that the enemy intended to bear down in several bodies, distributed  his army into three divisions, that his inferiority of numbers,  and ignorance of the country, might not give them an opportunity of  surrounding him.    26. When this was known to the enemy, they suddenly changed their  design; and making a general"]]]
