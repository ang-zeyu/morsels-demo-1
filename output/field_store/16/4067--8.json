So, having won the war, let us go home again  and make merry and feast, having after many years proved the Flatheads  to be greater and more powerful than the Skeezers.\"    So the Flatheads marched away and passed through the row of palms and  went back to their mountain, where the Su-dic and a few of his officers  feasted and all the others were forced to wait on them.    \"I'm sorry we couldn't have roast pig,\" said the Su-dic, \"but as the  only pig we have is made of gold, we can't eat her. Also the Golden Pig  happens to be my wife, and even were she not gold I am sure she would  be too tough to eat.\"          Chapter Twelve    The Diamond Swan      When the Flatheads had gone away the Diamond Swan swam back to the boat  and one of the young Skeezers named Ervic said to her eagerly:    \"How can we get back to the island, your Majesty?\"    \"Am I not beautiful?\" asked Coo-ee-oh, arching her neck gracefully and  spreading her diamond-sprinkled wings. \"I can see my reflection in the  water, and I'm sure there is no bird nor beast, nor human as  magnificent as I am!\"    \"How shall we get back to the island, your Majesty?\" pleaded Ervic.    \"When my fame spreads throughout the land, people will travel from all  parts of this lake to look upon my loveliness,\" said Coo-ee-oh, shaking  her feathers to make the diamonds glitter more brilliantly.    \"But, your Majesty, we must go home and we do not know how to get  there,\" Ervic persisted.    \"My eyes,\" remarked the Diamond Swan, \"are wonderfully blue and bright  and will charm all beholders.\"    \"Tell us how to make the boat go--how to get back into the island,\"  begged Ervic and the others cried just as earnestly: \"Tell us,  Coo-ee-oh; tell us!\"    \"I don't know,\" replied the Queen in a careless tone.    \"You are a magic-worker, a sorceress, a witch!\"    \"I was, of course, when I was a girl,\" she said, bending her head over  the clear water to catch her reflection in it; \"but now I've forgotten  all such foolish things as magic. Swans are lovelier than girls,  especially when they're sprinkled with diamonds. Don't you think so?\"  And she gracefully swam away, without seeming to care whether they  answered or not.    Ervic and his companions were in despair. They saw plainly that  Coo-ee-oh could not or would not help them. The former Queen had no  further thought for her island, her people, or her wonderful magic; she  was only intent on admiring her own beauty.    \"Truly,\" said Ervic, in a gloomy voice, \"the Flatheads have conquered  us!\"       *     *     *     *     *    Some of these events had been witnessed by Ozma and Dorothy and Lady  Aurex, who had left the house and gone close to the glass of the dome,  in order to see what was going on. Many of the Skeezers had also  crowded against the dome, wondering what would happen next. Although  their vision was to an extent blurred by the water and the necessity of  looking upward at an angle, they had observed the main points of the  drama enacted above. They saw Queen Coo-ee-oh's submarine come to the  surface and open; they saw the Queen standing erect to throw her magic  rope; they saw her sudden transformation into a Diamond Swan, and a cry  of amazement went up from the Skeezers inside the dome.    \"Good!\" exclaimed Dorothy. \"I hate that old Su-dic, but I'm glad  Coo-ee-oh is punished.\"    \"This is a dreadful misfortune!\" cried Lady Aurex, pressing her hands  upon her heart.    \"Yes,\" agreed Ozma, nodding her head thoughtfully; \"Coo-ee-oh's  misfortune will prove a terrible blow to her people.\"    \"What do you mean by that?\" asked Dorothy in surprise. \"Seems to me the  Skeezers are in luck to lose their cruel Queen.\"    \"If that were all you would be right,\" responded Lady Aurex; \"and if  the island were above water it would not be so serious. But here we all  are, at the bottom of the lake, and fast prisoners in this dome.\"    \"Can't you raise the island?\" inquired Dorothy.    \"No. Only Coo-ee-oh knew how to do that,\" was the answer.    \"We can try,\" insisted Dorothy. \"If it can be made to go down, it can  be made to come up. The machinery is still here, I suppose.    \"Yes; but the machinery works by magic, and Coo-ee-oh would never share  her secret power with any one of us.\"    Dorothy's face grew grave; but she was thinking.    \"Ozma knows a lot of magic,\" she said.    \"But not that kind of magic,\" Ozma replied.    \"Can't you learn how, by looking at the machinery?\"    \"I'm afraid not, my dear. It isn't fairy magic at all; it is  witchcraft.\"    \"Well,\" said Dorothy, turning to Lady Aurex, \"you say there are other  sub-sub-sinking boats. We can get in one of those, and shoot out to the  top of the water, like Coo-ee-oh did, and so escape. And then we can  help to rescue all the Skeezers down here.\"    \"No one knows how to work the under-water boats but the Queen,\"  declared Lady Aurex.    \"Isn't there any door or window in this dome that we could open?\"    \"No; and, if there were, the water would rush in to flood the dome, and  we could not get out.\"    \"The Skeezers,\" said Ozma, \"could not drown; they only get wet and  soggy and in that condition they would be very uncomfortable and  unhappy. But you are a mortal girl, Dorothy, and if your Magic Belt  protected you from death you would have to lie forever at the bottom of  the lake.\"    \"No, I'd rather die quickly,\" asserted the little girl. \"But there are  doors in the basement that open--to let out the bridges and the  boats--and that would not flood the dome, you know.\"    \"Those doors open by a magic word, and only Coo-ee-oh knows the word  that must be uttered,\" said Lady Aurex.    \"Dear me!\" exclaimed Dorothy, \"that dreadful Queen's witchcraft upsets  all my plans to escape. I guess I'll give it up, Ozma, and let you save  us.\"    Ozma smiled, but her smile was not so cheerful as usual. The Princess  of Oz found herself confronted with a serious problem, and although she  had no thought of despairing she realized that the Skeezers and their  island, as well as Dorothy and herself, were in grave trouble and that  unless she could find a means to save them they would be lost to the  Land of Oz for all future time.    \"In such a dilemma,\" said she, musingly, \"nothing is gained by haste.  Careful thought may aid us, and so may the course of events. The  unexpected is always likely to happen, and cheerful patience is better  than reckless action.\"    \"All right,\" returned Dorothy; \"take your time, Ozma; there's no hurry.  How about some breakfast, Lady Aurex?\"    Their hostess led them back to the house, where she ordered her  trembling servants to prepare and serve breakfast. All the Skeezers  were frightened and anxious over the transformation of their Queen into  a swan. Coo-ee-oh was feared and hated, but they had depended on her  magic to conquer the Flatheads and she was the only one who could raise  their island to the surface of the lake again.    Before breakfast was over several of the leading Skeezers came to Aurex  to ask her advice and to question Princess Ozma, of whom they knew  nothing except that she claimed to be a fairy and the Ruler of all the  land, including the Lake of the Skeezers.    \"If what you told Queen Coo-ee-oh was the truth,\" they said to her,  \"you are our lawful mistress, and we may depend on you to get us out of  our difficulties.\"    \"I will try to do that,\" Ozma graciously assured them, \"but you must  remember that the powers of fairies are granted them to bring comfort  and happiness to all who appeal to them. On the contrary, such magic as  Coo-ee-oh knew and practiced is unlawful witchcraft and her arts are  such as no fairy would condescend to use. However, it is sometimes  necessary to consider evil in order to accomplish good, and perhaps by  studying Coo-ee-oh's tools and charms of witchcraft I may be able to  save us. Do you promise to accept me as your Ruler and to obey my  commands?\"    They promised willingly.    \"Then,\" continued Ozma, \"I will go to Coo-ee-oh's palace and take  possession of it. Perhaps what I find there will be of use to me. In  the meantime tell all the Skeezers to fear nothing, but have patience.  Let them return to their homes and perform their daily tasks as usual.  Coo-ee-oh's loss may not prove a misfortune, but rather a blessing.\"    This speech cheered the Skeezers amazingly. Really, they had no one now  to depend upon but Ozma, and in spite of their dangerous position their  hearts were lightened by the transformation and absence of their cruel  Queen.    They got out their brass band and a grand procession escorted Ozma and  Dorothy to the palace, where all of Coo-ee-oh's former servants were  eager to wait upon them. Ozma invited Lady Aurex to stay at the palace  also, for she knew all about the Skeezers and their island and had also  been a favorite of the former Queen, so her advice and information were  sure to prove valuable.    Ozma was somewhat disappointed in what she found in the palace. One  room of Coo-ee-oh's private suite was entirely devoted to the practice  of witchcraft, and here were countless queer instruments and jars of  ointments and bottles of potions labeled with queer names, and strange  machines that Ozma could not guess the use of, and pickled toads and  snails and lizards, and a shelf of books that were written in blood,  but in a language which the Ruler of Oz did not know.    \"I do not see,\" said Ozma to Dorothy, who accompanied her in her  search, \"how Coo-ee-oh knew the use of the magic tools she stole from  the three Adept Witches. Moreover, from all reports these Adepts  practiced only good witchcraft, such as would be helpful to their  people, while Coo-ee-oh performed only evil.\"    \"Perhaps she turned the good things to evil uses?\" suggested Dorothy.    \"Yes, and with the knowledge she gained Coo-ee-oh doubtless invented  many evil things quite unknown "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9612"],[0,"The Botanic Garden (#11)"],[1,"  and decomposition of water, there would seem another source of thunder-  showers; and that is, that the two gasses termed oxygene gas or vital  air, and hydrogene gas or inflammable air, may exist in the summer  atmosphere in a state of mixture but not of combination, and that the  electric spark or flash of lightning may combine them and produce water  instantaneously.]             \"Thus when ELIJA mark'd from Carmel's brow  560  In bright expanse the briny flood below;       Roll'd his red eyes amid the scorching air,       Smote his firm breast, and breathed his ardent prayer;       High in the midst a massy altar stood,       And slaughter'd offerings press'd the piles of wood;  565  While ISRAEL'S chiefs the sacred hill surround,       And famish'd armies crowd the dusty ground;       While proud Idolatry was leagued with dearth,       And wither'd famine swept the desert earth.--       \"OH, MIGHTY LORD! thy woe-worn servant hear,  570  \"Who calls thy name in agony of prayer;       \"Thy fanes dishonour'd, and thy prophets slain,       \"Lo!

I. \"GNOMES! YOUR bright forms, presiding at her birth,       Clung in fond squadrons round the new-born EARTH;       When high in ether, with explosion dire,       From the deep craters of his realms of fire,   15  The whirling Sun this ponderous planet hurl'd,       And gave the astonish'd void another world.       When from it's vaporous air, condensed by cold,       Descending torrents into oceans roll'd;       And fierce attraction with relentless force   20  Bent the reluctant wanderer to it's course.      [_From the deep craters_. l. 14. The existence of solar volcanos is  countenanced by their analogy to terrestrial, and lunar volcanos; and by  the spots on the sun's disk, which have been shewn by Dr. Wilson to be  excavations through its luminous surface, and may be supposed to be the  cavities from whence the planets and comets were ejected by explosions.  See additional notes, No. XV. on solar volcanos.]    [_When from its vaporous air_. l. 17. If the nucleus of the earth was  thrown out from the sun by an explosion along with as large a quantity  of surrounding hot vapour as its attraction would occasion to accompany  it, the ponderous semi-fluid nucleus would take a spherical form from  the attraction of its own parts, which would become an oblate spheroid  from its diurnal revolution. As the vapour cooled the water would be  precipitated, and an ocean would surround the spherical nucleus with a  superincumbent atmosphere. The nucleus of solar lava would likewise  become harder as it became cooler. To understand how the strata of the  earth were afterwards formed from the sediments of this circumfluent  ocean the reader is referred to an ingenious Treatise on the Theory of  the Earth by Mr. Whitehurst, who was many years a watch-maker and  engineer at Derby, but whose ingenuity, integrity, and humanity, were  rarely equalled in any station of life.]               \"Where yet the Bull with diamond-eye adorns       The Spring's fair forehead, and with golden horns;       Where yet the Lion climbs the ethereal plain,       And shakes the Summer from his radiant mane;   25  Where Libra lifts her airy arm, and weighs,       Poised in her silver ballance, nights and days;       With paler lustres where Aquarius burns,       And showers the still snow from his hoary urns;       YOUR ardent troops pursued the flying sphere,   30  Circling the starry girdle of the year;       While sweet vicissitudes of day and clime       Mark'd the new annals of enascent Time.           II. \"You trod with printless step Earth's tender globe,       While Ocean wrap'd it in his azure robe;   35  Beneath his waves her hardening strata spread,       Raised her PRIMEVAL ISLANDS from his bed,       Stretch'd her wide lawns, and sunk her winding dells,       And deck'd her shores with corals, pearls, and shells.      [_While ocean wrap'd_. l. 34. See additional notes, No. XVI. on the  production of calcareous earth.]    [_Her hardening srata spread_.  l. 35. The granite, or moor-stone, or  porphory, constitute the oldest part of the globe, since the limestone,  shells, coralloids, and other sea-productions rest upon them; and upon  these sea-productions are found clay, iron, coal, salt, and siliceous  sand or grit-stone. Thus there seem to be three divisions of the globe  distinctly marked; the first I suppose to have been the original nucleus  of the earth, or lava projected from the sun; 2. over this lie the  recrements of animal and vegetable matter produced in the ocean; and, 3.  over these the recrements of animal and vegetable matter produced upon  the land. Besides these there are bodies which owe their origin to a  combination of those already mentioned, as siliceous sand, fluor,  alabaster; which seem to have derived their acids originally from the  vegetable kingdom, and their earthy bases from sea-productions. See  additional notes, No. XVI. on calcareous earth.]    [_Raised her primeval islands_. l. 36. The nucleus of the earth, still  covered with water, received perpetual increase by the immense  quantities of shells and coralloids either annually produced and  relinquishied, or left after the death of the animals. These would  gradually by their different degrees of cohesion be some of them more  and others less removable by the influence of solar tides, and gentle  tropical breezes, which then must have probably extended from one pole  to the other; for it is supposed the moon was not yet produced, and that  no storms or unequal winds had yet"]]]
