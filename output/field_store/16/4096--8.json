Joseph said to them:  Suppose ye that God may not give me grace to interpret it? Tell to me  what ye saw in your sleep. Then the butler told first and said:  Methought I saw a vine had three branches, and after they had flowered  the grapes were ripe, and then I took the cup of Pharaoh in my hand, and  took the grapes and wrang out of them wine into the cup that I held,  and presented it to Pharaoh to drink. Joseph answered: The three  branches be yet three days, after which Pharaoh shall remember thy  service and shall restore thee into thy foremost office and gree, for to  serve him as thou wert wont to do. Then I pray thee to remember me when  thou art at thine above, and be to me so merciful to sue unto Pharaoh  that he take me out of this prison, for I was stolen out of the land of  Hebrews and am innocently set here in prison. Then the master baker saw  that he had wisely interpreted the butler's dream; he said: Methought  that I had three baskets of meat upon my head, and in that one basket  that was highest methought I bare all the meat of the bakehouse and  birds came and ate of it. Joseph answered: This is the interpretation of  the dream; the three baskets be three days yet to come, after which  Pharaoh shall smite off thy head and shall hang thee on the cross, and  the birds shall tear thy flesh. And the third day after this Pharaoh  made a great feast unto his children, and remembered him, among the  meals, on the master butler and the master baker. He restored his butler  unto his office, and to serve him of the cup, and that other was hanged,  that the truth of the interpreter was believed and proved.  Notwithstanding the master butler in his wealth forgat Joseph his  interpreter.    Two years after Pharaoh saw in his sleep a dream. Him thought he stood  upon the river, from which he saw seven oxen ascend to the land which  were fair and right fat, and were fed in a fat pasture; he saw other  seven come out of the river, poor and lean, and were fed in places  plenteous and burgeoning. These devoured the other that were so fat and  fair. Herewith he started out of his sleep, and after slept again, and  saw another dream. He saw seven ears of corn standing on one stalk, full  and fair of corns, and as many other ears void and smitten with drought,  which devoured the beauty of the first seven. In the morning Pharaoh  awoke and was greatly afeard of these dreams, and sent for all  conjectors and diviners of Egypt, and wise men; and when they were  gathered he told to them his dream, and there was none that could  interpret it. Then at last the master butler, remembering Joseph, said:  I knowledge my sin, on a time the king being wroth with his servants,  sent me and the master of the bakers into prison, where we in one night  dreamed both prodigies of things coming. And there was a child of the  Hebrews, servant to the jailer, to whom we told our dreams and he  expounded them to us and said what should happen; I am restored to mine  office and that other is hanged on the cross.    Anon, by the king's commandment, Joseph was taken out of prison and  shaved, bathed, and changed his clothes, and brought tofore Pharaoh, to  whom he said: I saw a dream which I have showed unto wise men, and there  is none that can tell me the interpretation thereof. To whom Joseph  answered: God shall answer by me things prosperous to Pharaoh. Then  Pharaoh told to him his dreams, like as is tofore written, of the seven  fat oxen and seven lean, and how the lean devoured the fat, and in  likewise of the ears. Joseph answered: The king's dreams are one thing  which God hath showed to Pharaoh. The seven fat oxen and the seven ears  full, betoken seven years to come of great plenty and commodious, and  the seven lean oxen, and the seven void ears smitten with drought,  betoken seven years after them of great hunger and scarcity. Lo! there  shall come first seven years of great fertility and plenty in all the  land of Egypt, after whom shall follow other seven years of so great  sterility, barrenness, and scarcity, that the abundance of the first  shall be all forgotten. The great hunger of these latter years shall  consume all the plenty of the first years. The latter dream pertaineth  to the same, because God would that it should be fulfilled. Now  therefore let the king provide for a man that is wise and witty, that  may command and ordain provosts and officers in all places of the realm,  that they gather into garners and barns the fifth part of all the corn  and fruits that shall grow these first seven plenteous years that be to  come, and that all this wheat may be kept in barns and garners in towns  and villages, that it may be made ready against the coming of the seven  scarce years that shall oppress by hunger all Egypt, to the end that the  people be not enfamined. This counsel pleased much to Pharaoh and to all  his ministers. Then Pharaoh said to his servants: Where should we find  such a man as this is, which is fulfilled with the spirit of God? And  then he said to Joseph: Forasmuch as God hath showed to thee all that  thou hast spoken, trowest thou that we might find any wiser than thou  or like to thee? Thou shalt be upperest of my house, and to the  commandment of thy mouth all people shall obey. I only shall go tofore  thee and sit but one seat above thee. Yet said Pharaoh to Joseph: Lo! I  have ordained thee above and master upon all the land of Egypt. He took  a ring from his hand and gave it into his hand, and clad him with a  double stole furred with bise; and a golden collar he put about his  neck, and made him to ascend upon his chair; the second trumpet crying  that all men should kneel tofore him, and that they should know him  upperest provost of all the land of Egypt. Then said the king of Egypt  to Joseph: I am Pharaoh, without thy commandment shall no man move hand  nor foot in all the land of Egypt. He changed his name and called him in  the tongue of Egypt: The saviour of the world. He gave to him a wife  named Asenath, daughter of Poti-phera, priest of Eliopoleos.    Joseph went forth then into the land of Egypt. Joseph was thirty years  old when he stood in the favor and grace of Pharaoh. And he went round  about all the region of Egypt. The plenteousness and fertility of the  seven years came, and sheaves and shocks of corn were brought in to the  barns; all the abundance of fruits was laid in every town. There was so  great plenty of wheat that it might be compared to the gravel of the  sea, and the plenty thereof exceedeth measure. Joseph had two sons by  his wife ere the famine and hunger came, which Asenath the priest's  daughter brought forth, of whom he called the name of the first  Manasseh, saying: God hath made me to forget all my labors, and the  house of my father hath forgotten me. He called the name of the second  son Ephraim, saying: God hath made me to grow in the land of my poverty.    Then passed the seven years of plenty and fertility that were in Egypt,  and the seven years of scarcity and hunger began to come, which Joseph  had spoken of tofore, and hunger began to wax and grow in the universal  world; also in all the land of Egypt was hunger and scarcity. And when  the people hungered they cried to Pharaoh asking meat, to whom he  answered: Go ye to Joseph, and whatsoever he saith to you do ye. Daily  grew and increased the hunger in all the land. Then Joseph opened the  barns and garners, and sold corn to the Egyptians, for the hunger  oppressed them sore. All provinces came into Egypt for to buy meat to  them, and to eschew the hunger.    Jacob, father unto Joseph, heard tell that corn and victuals were sold  in Egypt, and said to his sons: Why be ye negligent? I have heard say  that corn is sold in Egypt; go ye thither and buy for us that is  necessary and behoveful, that we may live, and consume not for need.  Then the ten brethren of Joseph descended into Egypt for to buy wheat,  and Benjamin was left at home with the father, because whatsoever happed  to the brethren in their journey. Then they entered into the land of  Egypt with others for to buy corn. There was great famine in the land of  Canaan, and Joseph was prince in the land of Egypt, also by his  commandment wheat was sold unto the people. Then when his brethren were  come and had adored and worshipped him, he anon knew them, and spake to  them, as to strangers, hard words, demanding them saying: Whence be ye?  Which answered: Of the land of Canaan, and come hither to buy that is  necessary for us. And though he knew his brethren, yet was he unknown of  them. He remembered the dreams that he sometime had seen, and told them  and said: Ye be spies and be come hither for to espy the weakest places  of this land, which said to him: It is not so, my lord, but we thy  servants be come for to buy victuals. We be all sons to one man, we come  peaceably, ne we thy servants think ne imagine none evil. To whom he  answered: It is all otherwise, ye be come for to espy and consider the  secretest places of this realm. Then they said: We are twelve brethren,  thy servants, sons of one man in the land of Canaan, the youngest is at  home with our father, and that other is dead. That is, said he, that I  said; ye be spies. Now I have of you the experience. I swear to you by  the health of Pharaoh ye shall not depart till that your youngest  brother come. Send ye one of you for him to bring him hither. Ye shall  abide in fetters in prison till the truth be proved whether the things  that ye have said be true or false, else, by the health of Pharaoh, ye  be spies. And delivered them to be kept three days. The third day they  were brought out of prison, to whom he said: I dread God, if ye be  peaceable as ye say, do as ye have said, and ye shall live. Let one  brother be bounden in prison, and go ye your way, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1039"],[0,"Missionary Travels and Researches in South Africa (#12)"],[1,"with their medicines. The doctors  themselves had none, so the poor resorted to us for aid. We took the  hint, and henceforth cured the disease by giving a teaspoonful of salt,  minus the other remedies. Either milk or meat had the same effect,  though not so rapidly as salt. Long afterward, when I was myself  deprived of salt for four months, at two distinct periods, I felt no  desire for that condiment, but I was plagued by very great longing for  the above articles of food. This continued as long as I was confined  to an exclusively vegetable diet, and when I procured a meal of flesh,  though boiled in perfectly fresh rain-water, it tasted as pleasantly  saltish as if slightly impregnated with the condiment. Milk or meat,  obtained in however small quantities, removed entirely the excessive  longing and dreaming about roasted ribs of fat oxen, and bowls of cool  thick milk gurgling forth from the big-bellied calabashes; and I could  then understand the thankfulness to Mrs. L. often expressed by poor  Bakwain women, in the interesting condition, for a very little of  either.    In addition to other adverse influences, the general uncertainty, though  not absolute want of food, and the necessity of frequent absence for the  purpose of either hunting game or collecting roots and fruits, proved  a serious barrier to the progress of the people in knowledge. Our own  education in England is carried on at the comfortable breakfast and  dinner table, and by the cosy fire, as well as in the church and school.  Few English people with stomachs painfully empty would be decorous at  church any more than they are when these organs are overcharged. Ragged  schools would have been a failure had not the teachers wisely provided  food for the body as well as food for the mind; and not only must we  show a friendly interest in the bodily comfort of the objects of our  sympathy as a Christian duty, but we can no more hope for healthy  feelings among the poor, either at home or abroad, without feeding them  into them, than we can hope to see an ordinary working-bee reared into a  queen-mother by the ordinary food of the hive.    Sending the Gospel to the heathen must, if this view be correct, include  much more than is implied in the usual picture of a missionary, namely,  a man going about with a Bible under his arm. The promotion of commerce  ought to be specially attended to, as this, more speedily than any thing  else, demolishes that sense of isolation which heathenism engenders,  and makes the tribes feel themselves mutually dependent on, and mutually  beneficial to each other. With a view to this, the missionaries at  Kuruman got permission from the government for a trader to reside at  the station, and a considerable trade has been the result; the trader  himself has become rich enough to retire with a competence. Those laws  which still prevent free commercial intercourse among the civilized  nations seem to be nothing else but the remains of our own heathenism.  My observations on this subject make me extremely desirous to promote  the preparation of the raw materials of European manufactures in Africa,  for by that means we may not only put a stop to the slave-trade, but  introduce the negro family into the body corporate of nations, no one  member of which can suffer without the others suffering with it. Success  in this, in both Eastern and Western Africa, would lead, in the course  of time, to a much larger diffusion of the blessings of civilization  than efforts exclusively spiritual and educational confined to any one  small tribe. These, however, it would of course be extremely desirable  to carry on at the same time at large central and healthy stations, for  neither civilization nor Christianity can be promoted alone. In fact,  they are inseparable.          Chapter 2.

Another adverse influence with which the mission had to contend was  the vicinity of the Boers of the Cashan Mountains, otherwise named  \"Magaliesberg\". These are not to be counfounded with the Cape colonists,  who sometimes pass by the name. The word Boer simply means \"farmer\", and  is not synonymous with our word boor. Indeed, to the Boers generally  the latter term would be quite inappropriate, for they are a sober,  industrious, and most hospitable body of peasantry. Those, however, who  have fled from English law on various pretexts, and have been joined  by English deserters and every other variety of bad character in their  distant localities, are unfortunately of a very different stamp. The  great objection many of the Boers had, and still have, to English law,  is that it makes no distinction between black men and white. They  felt aggrieved by their supposed losses in the emancipation of their  Hottentot slaves, and determined to erect themselves into a republic, in  which they might pursue, without molestation, the \"proper treatment of  the blacks\". It is almost needless to add that the \"proper treatment\"  has always contained in it the essential element of slavery, namely,  compulsory unpaid labor.    One section of this body, under the late Mr. Hendrick Potgeiter,  penetrated the interior as far as the Cashan Mountains, whence a Zulu  or Caffre chief, named Mosilikatze, had been expelled by the well-known  Caffre Dingaan; and a glad welcome was given them by the Bechuana  tribes, who had just escaped the hard sway of that cruel chieftain. They  came with the prestige of white men and deliverers; but the Bechuanas  soon found, as they expressed it, \"that Mosilikatze was cruel to his  enemies, and kind to those he conquered; but that the Boers destroyed  their enemies, and made slaves of their friends.\" The tribes who still  retain the semblance of independence are forced to perform all the labor  of the fields, such as manuring the land, weeding, reaping, building,  making dams and canals, and at the same time to support themselves.  I have myself been an eye-witness of Boers coming to a village, and,  according to their usual custom, demanding twenty or thirty women to  weed their gardens, and have seen these women proceed to the scene of  unrequited toil, carrying their own food on their heads, their children  on their backs, and instruments of labor on their shoulders. Nor have  the Boers any wish to conceal the meanness of thus employing unpaid  labor; on the contrary, every one of them, from Mr. Potgeiter and Mr.  Gert Krieger, the commandants, downward, lauded his own humanity and  justice in making such an equitable regulation. \"We make the people work  for us, in consideration of allowing them to live in our country.\"    I can appeal to the Commandant Krieger if the foregoing is not a fair  and impartial statement of the views of himself and his people. I am  sensible of no mental bias toward or against these Boers; and during the  several journeys I made to the poor enslaved tribes, I never avoided  the whites, but tried to cure and did administer remedies to their sick,  without money and without price. It is due to them to state that I was  invariably treated with respect; but it is most unfortunate that  they should have been left by their own Church for so many years to  deteriorate and become as degraded as the blacks, whom the stupid  prejudice against color leads them to detest.    This new species of slavery which they have adopted serves to supply the  lack of field-labor only. The demand for domestic servants must be met  by forays on tribes which have good supplies of cattle. The Portuguese  can quote instances in which blacks become so degraded by the love of  strong drink as actually to sell themselves; but never in any one case,  within the memory of man, has a Bechuana chief sold any of his people,  or a Bechuana man his child. Hence the necessity for a foray to seize  children. And those individual Boers who would not engage in it for the  sake of slaves can seldom resist the two-fold plea of a well-told  story of an intended uprising of the devoted tribe, and the prospect of  handsome pay in the division of the captured cattle besides.    It is difficult for a person in a civilized country to conceive that  any body of men possessing the common attributes of humanity (and these  Boers are by no means destitute of the better feelings of our nature)  should with one accord set out, after loading their own wives and  children with caresses, and proceed to shoot down in cold blood men  and women, of a different color, it is true, but possessed of domestic  feelings and affections equal to their own. I saw and conversed with  children in the houses of Boers who had, by their own and their masters'  account, been captured, and in several instances I traced the parents  of these unfortunates, though the plan approved by the long-headed among  the burghers is to take children so young that they soon forget their  parents and their native language also. It was long before I could give  credit to the tales of bloodshed told by native witnesses, and had I  received no other testimony but theirs I should"]]]
