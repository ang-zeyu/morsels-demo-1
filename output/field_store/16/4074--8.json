[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9806"],[0,"Mr. Justice Raffles (#11)"],[1," all, \"owing  to the serious illness of his father.\"    \"His father!\" I exclaimed. \"Why, his father's closeted with somebody or  other at this very moment behind the door you're looking at!\"    \"I know, Bunny. I've seen him.\"    \"But what an extraordinary fabrication to get into a decent paper! I  don't wonder you went to the office about it.\"    \"You'll wonder still less when I tell you I have an old pal on the  staff.\"    \"Of course you made him take it straight out?\"    \"On the contrary, Bunny, I persuaded him to put it in!\"    And Raffles chuckled in my face as I have known him chuckle over many a  more felonious--but less incomprehensible--exploit.    \"Didn't you see, Bunny, how bad the poor old boy looked in his library  this morning? That gave me my idea; the fiction is at least founded on  fact. I wonder you don't see the point; as a matter of fact, there are  two points, just as there were two jobs I took on this morning; one was  to find Teddy, and the other was to save his face at Lord's. Well, I  haven't actually found him yet; but if he's in the land of the living he  will see this statement, and when he does see it even you may guess what  he will do! Meanwhile, there's nothing but sympathy for him at Lord's.  Studley couldn't have been nicer; a place will be kept for Teddy up to  the eleventh hour to-morrow. And if that isn't killing two birds with one  stone, Bunny, may I never perform the feat!\"    \"But what will old Garland say, A. J.?\"    \"He has already said, Bunny. I told him what I was doing in a note  before lunch, and the moment I arrived just now he came out to hear what  I had done. He doesn't mind what I do so long as I find Teddy and save  his face before the world at large and Miss Belsize in particular. Look  out, Bunny--here she is!\"    The excitement in his whisper was not characteristic of Raffles, but it  was less remarkable than the change in Camilla Belsize as she entered the  hall through the drawing-room as we had done before her. For one moment I  suspected her of eavesdropping; then I saw that all traces of personal  pique had vanished from her face, and that some anxiety for another had  taken its place. She came up to Raffles and me as though she had forgiven  both of us our trespasses of two or three minutes ago.    \"I didn't go into the library after all,\" she said, looking askance at  the library door. \"I am afraid Mr. Garland is having a trying interview  with somebody. I had just a glimpse of the man's face as I hesitated, and  I thought I recognised him.\"    \"Who was it?\" I asked, for I myself had wondered who the rather  mysterious visitor might be for whom Mr. Garland had deserted us so  abruptly in the conservatory, and with whom he was still conferring in  the hour of so many issues.    \"I believe it's a dreadful man I know by sight down the river,\" said  Miss Belsize; and hardly had she spoke before the library door opened  and out came the dreadful man in the portentous person of Dan Levy, the  usurer of European notoriety, our victim of the morning and our certain  enemy for life.          CHAPTER VII    In Which We Fail to Score      Mr. Levy sailed in with frock-coat flying, shiny hat in hand; he was  evidently prepared for us, and Raffles for once behaved as though we  were prepared for Mr. Levy. Of myself I cannot speak. I was ready for a  terrific scene. But Raffles was magnificent, and to do our enemy justice  he was quite as good; they faced each other with a nod and a smile of  mutual suavity, shot with underlying animosity on the one side and  delightful defiance on the other. Not a word was said or a tone employed  to betray the true situation between the three of us; for I took my cue  from the two protagonists just in time to preserve the triple truce.  Meanwhile Mr. Garland, obviously distressed as he was, and really ill as  he looked, was not the least successful of us in hiding his emotions;  for having expressed a grim satisfaction in the coincidence of our all  knowing each other, he added that he supposed Miss Belsize was an  exception, and presented Mr. Levy forthwith as though he were an  ordinary guest.    \"You must find a better exception than this young lady!\" cried that  worthy with a certain _aplomb_. \"I know you very well by sight, Miss  Belsize, and your mother, Lady Laura, into the bargain.\"    \"Really?\" said Miss Belsize, without returning the compliment at  her command.    \"The bargain!\" muttered Raffles to me with sly irony. The echo was not  meant for Levy's ears, but it reached them nevertheless, and was taken up  with adroit urbanity.    \"I didn't mean to use a trade term,\" explained the Jew, \"though  bargains, I confess, are somewhat in my line; and I don't often get the  worst of one, Mr. Raffles; when I do, the other fellow usually lives to  repent it.\"    It was said with a laugh for the lady's benefit, but with a gleam of the  eyes for ours. Raffles answered the laugh with a much heartier one; the  look he ignored. I saw Miss Belsize beginning to watch the pair, and only  interrupted by the arrival of the tea-tray, over which Mr. Garland begged  her to preside. Mr. Garland seemed to have an anxious eye upon us all in  turn; at Raffles he looked wistfully as though burning to get him to  himself for further consultation; but the fact that he refrained from  doing so, coupled with a grimly punctilious manner towards the  money-lender, gave the impression that his son's whereabouts was no  longer the sole anxiety.    \"And yet,\" remarked Miss Belsize, as we formed a group about her in the  firelight, \"you seem to have met your match the other day, Mr. Levy?\"    \"Where was that, Miss Belsize?\"    \"Somewhere on the Continent, wasn't it? It got into the newspapers, I  know, but I forget the name of the place.\"    \"Do you mean when my wife and I were robbed at Carlsbad?\"    I was holding my breath now as I had not held it all day. Raffles was  merely smiling into his teacup as one who knew all about the affair.    \"Carlsbad it was!\" certified Miss Belsize, as though it mattered. \"I  remember now.\"    \"I don't call that meeting your match,\" said the money-lender. \"An  unarmed man with a frightened wife at his elbow is no match for a  desperate criminal with a loaded revolver.\"    \"Was it as bad as all that?\" whispered Camilla Belsize.    Up to this point one had felt her to be forcing the unlucky topic with  the best of intentions towards us all; now she was interested in the  episode for its own sake, and eager for more details than Mr. Levy had a  mind to impart.    \"It makes a good tale, I know,\" said he, \"but I shall prefer telling  it when they've got the man. If you want to know any more, Miss  Belsize, you'd better ask Mr. Raffles; 'e was in our hotel, and came  in for all the excitement. But it was just a trifle too exciting for  me and my wife.\"    \"Raffles at Carlsbad?\" exclaimed Mr. Garland.    Miss Belsize only stared.    \"Yes,\" said Raffles. \"That's where I had the pleasure of meeting  Mr. Levy.\"    \"Didn't you know he was there?\" inquired the money-lender of our host.  And he looked sharply at Raffles as Mr. Garland replied that this was the  first he had heard of it.    \"But it's the first we've seen of each other, sir,\" said Raffles,  \"except those few minutes this morning. And I told you I only got back  last night.\"    \"But you never told me you had been at Carlsbad, Raffles!\"    \"It's a sore subject, you see,\" said Raffles, with a sigh and a laugh.  \"Isn't it, Mr. Levy?\"    \"You seem to find it so,\" replied the moneylender.    They were standing face to face in the firelight, each with a shoulder  against the massive chimney-piece; and Camilla Belsize was still staring  at them both from her place behind the tea-tray; and I was watching the  three of them by turns from the other side of the hall.    \"But you're the fittest man I know. Raffles,\" pursued old Garland with  terrible tact. \"What on earth were you doing at a place like Carlsbad?\"    \"The cure,\" said Raffles. \"There's nothing else to do there--is there,  Mr. Levy?\"    Levy replied with his eyes on Raffles:    \"Unless you've got to cope with a _swell mobsman_ who steals your  wife's jewels and then gets in such a funk that he practically gives  them back again!\"    The emphasised term was the one that Dan Levy had applied to Raffles and  myself in his own office that very morning.    \"Did he give them back again?\" asked Camilla Belsize, breaking her  silence on an eager note.    Raffles turned to her at once.    \"The jewels were found buried in the woods,\" said he. \"Out there  everybody thought the thief had simply hidden them. But no doubt Mr. Levy  has the better information.\"    Mr. Levy smiled sardonically in the firelight. And it was at this point I  followed the example of Miss Belsize and put in my one belated word.    \"I shouldn't have thought there was such a thing as a swell mob in the  wilds of Austria,\" said I.    \"There isn't,\" admitted the money-lender readily. \"But your true mobsman  knows his whole blooming Continent as well as Piccadilly Circus. His  'ead-quarters are in London, but a week's journey at an hour's notice is  nothing to him if the swag looks worth it. Mrs. Levy's necklace was  actually taken at Carlsbad, for instance, but the odds are that it was  marked down at some London theatre--or restaurant, eh, Mr. Raffles?\"    \"I'm afraid I can't offer an expert opinion,\" said Raffles very merrily  as their eyes met. \"But if the man was an Englishman and knew that you  were one, why didn't he bully you in the vulgar tongue?\"    \"Who told you he didn't?\" cried Levy, with a sudden grin that left no  doubt about the thought behind it. To me that thought had been obvious  from its birth within the last few minutes; but this expression of it was  as obvious a mistake.    \"Who told me anything about it,\" retorted Raffles, \"except yourself and  Mrs. Levy? Your gospels clashed a little here and there; but both agreed  that the fellow "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/984"],[0,"Who Was Who: 5000 B. C. to Date (#11)"],[1," they said.

A hand other than his own made him president. Here his newspaper  career really began. R. first opened a three-ring circus in the White  House, wore a rough rider hat, and told the country what a great  president he was. The voters believed him, and did not object to four  years more. During this administration R. successfully advertised  himself, the family, started the Panama Canal, and appointed one William  Howard Taft (see Poor Bill) his successor. R. then traveled through  Africa with a magnificent body guard of photographers and newspaper men.  After shooting a museum-full of specimens, he toured Europe and told the  king how to king and the emperors how to emp. Returning to the United  States he placed his hand in state politics. Fingers were badly burned.  When it came time to elect another president, R. was tired of scene  shifting and yearned for the bouquets of the audience. He girded up  his loins with the robes of sanctity, placed an international Harvester  Trust halo over his head, and proclaimed himself a second Moses who was  destined to lead the children of America out of the Land of the Frying  Pan into that of the Fire. With a mighty army of politicians, who also  wanted to get back, R. started his campaign with such a huge band he  could not hear any others. The fight was based on telling"]]]
