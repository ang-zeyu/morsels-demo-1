The Virginian made no reply to this frivolous suggestion. He was gazing  over the wide landscape gravely and with apparent inattention. He  invariably saw game before I did, and was off his horse and crouched  among the sage while I was still getting my left foot clear of the  stirrup. I succeeded in killing an antelope, and we rode home with the  head and hind quarters.    \"No,\" said he. \"It's sure the thunder, and not the lonesomeness. How do  yu' like the lonesomeness yourself?\"    I told him that I liked it.    \"I could not live without it now,\" he said. \"This has got into my  system.\" He swept his hand out at the vast space of world. \"I went back  home to see my folks onced. Mother was dyin' slow, and she wanted me.  I stayed a year. But them Virginia mountains could please me no more.  Afteh she was gone, I told my brothers and sisters good-by. We like each  other well enough, but I reckon I'll not go back.\"    We found Em'ly seated upon a collection of green California peaches,  which the Judge had brought from the railroad.    \"I don't mind her any more,\" I said; \"I'm sorry for her.\"    \"I've been sorry for her right along,\" said the Virginian. \"She does  hate the roosters so.\" And he said that he was making a collection of  every class of object which he found her treating as eggs.    But Em'ly's egg-industry was terminated abruptly one morning, and her  unquestioned energies diverted to a new channel. A turkey which had been  sitting in the root-house appeared with twelve children, and a family of  bantams occurred almost simultaneously. Em'ly was importantly scratching  the soil inside Paladin's corral when the bantam tribe of newly born  came by down the lane, and she caught sight of them through the bars.  She crossed the corral at a run, and intercepted two of the chicks that  were trailing somewhat behind their real mamma. These she undertook  to appropriate, and assumed a high tone with the bantam, who was the  smaller, and hence obliged to retreat with her still numerous family.  I interfered, and put matters straight; but the adjustment was only  temporary. In an hour I saw Em'ly immensely busy with two more bantams,  leading them about and taking a care of them which I must admit seemed  perfectly efficient.    And now came the first incident that made me suspect her to be demented.    She had proceeded with her changelings behind the kitchen, where one of  the irrigation ditches ran under the fence from the hay-field to supply  the house with water. Some distance along this ditch inside the field  were the twelve turkeys in the short, recently cut stubble. Again Em'ly  set off instantly like a deer. She left the dismayed bantams behind her.  She crossed the ditch with one jump of her stout blue legs, flew over  the grass, and was at once among the turkeys, where, with an instinct  of maternity as undiscriminating as it was reckless, she attempted to  huddle some of them away. But this other mamma was not a bantam, and in  a few moments Em'ly was entirely routed in her attempt to acquire a new  variety of family.    This spectacle was witnessed by the Virginian and myself, and it  overcame him. He went speechless across to the bunk-house, by himself,  and sat on his bed, while I took the abandoned bantams back to their own  circle.    I have often wondered what the other fowls thought of all this. Some  impression it certainly did make upon them. The notion may seem out of  reason to those who have never closely attended to other animals than  man; but I am convinced that any community which shares some of our  instincts will share some of the resulting feelings, and that birds and  beasts have conventions, the breach of which startles them. If there be  anything in evolution, this would seem inevitable. At all events,  the chicken-house was upset during the following several days. Em'ly  disturbed now the bantams and now the turkeys, and several of these  latter had died, though I will not go so far as to say that this was  the result of her misplaced attentions. Nevertheless, I was seriously  thinking of locking her up till the broods should be a little older,  when another event happened, and all was suddenly at peace.    The Judge's setter came in one morning, wagging her tail. She had had  her puppies, and she now took us to where they were housed, in between  the floor of a building and the hollow ground. Em'ly was seated on the  whole litter.    \"No,\" I said to the Judge, \"I am not surprised. She is capable of  anything.\"    In her new choice of offspring, this hen had at length encountered an  unworthy parent. The setter was bored by her own puppies. She found the  hole under the house an obscure and monotonous residence compared with  the dining room, and our company more stimulating and sympathetic than  that of her children. A much-petted contact with our superior race had  developed her dog intelligence above its natural level, and turned her  into an unnatural, neglectful mother, who was constantly forgetting her  nursery for worldly pleasures.    At certain periods of the day she repaired to the puppies and fed them,  but came away when this perfunctory ceremony was accomplished; and she  was glad enough to have a governess bring them up. She made no quarrel  with Em'ly, and the two understood each other perfectly. I have never  seen among animals any arrangement so civilized and so perverted.  It made Em'ly perfectly happy. To see her sitting all day jealously  spreading her wings over some blind puppies was sufficiently curious;  but when they became large enough to come out from under the house and  toddle about in the proud hen's wake, I longed for some distinguished  naturalist. I felt that our ignorance made us inappropriate spectators  of such a phenomenon. Em'ly scratched and clucked, and the puppies ran  to her, pawed her with their fat limp little legs, and retreated beneath  her feathers in their games of hide and seek. Conceive, if you can, what  confusion must have reigned in their infant minds as to who the setter  was!    \"I reckon they think she's the wet-nurse,\" said the Virginian.    When the puppies grew to be boisterous, I perceived that Em'ly's  mission was approaching its end. They were too heavy for her, and their  increasing scope of playfulness was not in her line. Once or twice they  knocked her over, upon which she arose and pecked them severely, and  they retired to a safe distance, and sitting in a circle, yapped at  her. I think they began to suspect that she was only a hen after all.  So Em'ly resigned with an indifference which surprised me, until I  remembered that if it had been chickens, she would have ceased to look  after them by this time.    But here she was again \"out of a job,\" as the Virginian said.    \"She's raised them puppies for that triflin' setter, and now she'll  be huntin' around for something else useful to do that ain't in her  business.\"    Now there were other broods of chickens to arrive in the hen-house, and  I did not desire any more bantam and turkey performances. So, to avoid  confusion, I played a trick upon Em'ly. I went down to Sunk Creek and  fetched some smooth, oval stones. She was quite satisfied with these,  and passed a quiet day with them in a box. This was not fair, the  Virginian asserted.    \"You ain't going to jus' leave her fooled that a-way?\"    I did not see why not.    \"Why, she raised them puppies all right. Ain't she showed she knows how  to be a mother anyways? Em'ly ain't going to get her time took up for  nothing while I'm round hyeh,\" said the cow-puncher.    He laid a gentle hold of Em'ly and tossed her to the ground. She, of  course, rushed out among the corrals in a great state of nerves.    \"I don't see what good you do meddling,\" I protested.    To this he deigned no reply, but removed the unresponsive stones from  the straw.    \"Why, if they ain't right warm!\" he exclaimed plaintively. \"The poor,  deluded son-of-a-gun!\" And with this unusual description of a lady, he  sent the stones sailing like a line of birds. \"I'm regular getting stuck  on Em'ly,\" continued the Virginian. \"Yu' needn't to laugh. Don't yu' see  she's got sort o' human feelin's and desires? I always knowed hawsses  was like people, and my collie, of course. It is kind of foolish, I  expect, but that hen's goin' to have a real aigg di-rectly, right now,  to set on.\" With this he removed one from beneath another hen. \"We'll  have Em'ly raise this hyeh,\" said he, \"so she can put in her time  profitable.\"    It was not accomplished at once; for Em'ly, singularly enough, would  not consent to stay in the box whence she had been routed. At length we  found another retreat for her, and in these new surroundings, with a  new piece of work for her to do, Em'ly sat on the one egg which the  Virginian had so carefully provided for her.    Thus, as in all genuine tragedies, was the stroke of Fate wrought by  chance and the best intentions.    Em'ly began sitting on Friday afternoon near sundown. Early next morning  my sleep was gradually dispersed by a sound unearthly and continuous.  Now it dwindled, receding to a distance; again it came near, took a  turn, drifted to the other side of the house; then, evidently, whatever  it was, passed my door close, and I jumped upright in my bed. The high,  tense strain of vibration, nearly, but not quite, a musical note, was  like the threatening scream of machinery, though weaker, and I bounded  out of the house in my pajamas.    There was Em'ly, dishevelled, walking wildly about, her one egg  miraculously hatched within ten hours. The little lonely yellow ball of  down went cheeping along behind, following its mother as best it could.  What, then, had happened to the established period of incubation? For  an instant the thing was like a portent, and I was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12982"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science — Volume 1, No. (#12)"],[1,"thought was, had he overslept  himself! He sat up in bed to look at the clock which was exactly  opposite, and as he did so, in the large mirror over the fireplace,  he perceived a figure standing behind him. As the dilated eyes met his  own, he saw it was the face of Jacques Rollet. Overcome with horror he  sunk back on his pillow, and it was some minutes before he ventured  to look again in that direction; when he did so, the figure had  disappeared.    The sudden revulsion of feeling such a vision was calculated to  occasion in a man elate with joy, may be conceived! For some time  after the death of his former foe, he had been visited by not  unfrequent twinges of conscience; but of late, borne along by success,  and the hurry of Parisian life, these unpleasant remembrances had  grown rarer, till at length they had faded away altogether. Nothing  had been further from his thoughts than Jacques Rollet, when he closed  his eyes on the preceding night, nor when he opened them to that sun  which was to shine on what he expected to be the happiest day of his  life! Where were the high-strung nerves now! The elastic frame! The  bounding heart!    Heavily and slowly he arose from his bed, for it was time to do so;  and with a trembling hand and quivering knees, he went through  the processes of the toilet, gashing his cheek with the razor, and  spilling the water over his well polished boots. When he was dressed,  scarcely venturing to cast a glance in the mirror as he passed it,  he quitted the room and descended the stairs, taking the key of the  door with him for the purpose of leaving it with the porter; the man,  however, being absent, he laid it on the table in his lodge, and with  a relaxed and languid step proceeded on his way to the church, where  presently arrived the fair Natalie and her friends. How difficult it  was now to look happy, with that pallid face and extinguished eye!    \"How pale you are! Has anything happened? You are surely ill?\" were  the exclamations that met him on all sides. He tried to carry it off  as well as he could, but felt that the movements he would have wished  to appear alert were only convulsive; and that the smiles with which  he attempted to relax his features, were but distorted grimaces.  However, the church was not the place for further inquiries; and while  Natalie gently pressed his hand in token of sympathy, they advanced  to the altar, and the ceremony was performed; after which they stepped  into the carriages waiting at the door, and drove to the apartments of  Madme. de Bellefonds, where an elegant _dejeuner_ was prepared.    \"What ails you, my dear husband?\" inquired Natalie, as soon as they  were alone.    \"Nothing, love,\" he replied; \"nothing. I assure you, but a restless  night and a little overwork, in order that I might have to-day free to  enjoy my happiness!\"    \"Are you quite sure? Is there nothing else?\"    \"Nothing, indeed; and pray don't take notice of it, it only makes me  worse!\"    Natalie was not deceived, but she saw that what he said was true;  notice made him worse; so she contented herself with observing him  quietly, and saying nothing; but, as he _felt_ she was observing him,  she might almost better have spoken; words are often less embarrassing  things than too curious eyes.    When they reached Madame de Bellefonds' he had the same sort of  questioning and scrutiny to undergo, till he grew quite impatient  under it, and betrayed a degree of temper altogether unusual to him.  Then everybody looked astonished; some whispered their remarks, and  others expressed them by their wondering eyes, till his brow knit, and  his pallid cheeks became flushed with anger. Neither could he divert  attention by eating; his parched mouth would not allow him to swallow  anything but liquids, of which, however, he indulged in copious  libations; and it was an exceeding relief to him when the carriage,  which was to convey them to St. Denis, being announced, furnished  an excuse for hastily leaving the table. Looking at his watch, he  declared it was late; and Natalie, who saw how eager he was to be  gone, threw her shawl over her shoulders, and bidding her friends  _good morning_, they hurried away.    It was a fine sunny day in June; and, as they drove along the crowded  boulevards, and through the Porte St. Denis, the young bride and  bridegroom, to avoid each other's eyes, affected to be gazing out of  the windows; but when they reached that part of the road where there  was nothing but trees on each side, they felt it necessary to draw  in their heads, and make an attempt at conversation. De Chaulieu  put his arm round his wife's waist, and tried to rouse himself from  his depression; but it had by this time so reacted upon her, that  she could not respond to his efforts, and thus the conversation  languished, till both felt glad when they reached their destination,  which would, at all events, furnish them something to talk about.    Having quitted the carriage, and ordered a dinner at the Hotel  de l'Abbaye, the young couple proceeded to visit Mademoiselle  Hortense de Bellefonds, who was overjoyed to see her sister and new  brother-in-law, and doubly so when she found that they had obtained  permission to take her out to spend the afternoon with them. As there  is little to be seen at St. Denis but the Abbey, on quitting that part  of it devoted to education, they proceeded to visit the church, with  its various objects of interest; and as De Chaulieu's thoughts were  now forced into another direction, his cheerfulness began insensibly  to return. Natalie looked so beautiful, too, and the affection betwixt  the two young sisters was so pleasant to behold! And they spent a  couple of hours wandering about with Hortense, who was almost as well  informed as the Suisse, till the brazen doors were open which admitted  them to the royal vault. Satisfied, at length, with what they had  seen, they began to think of returning to the inn, the more especially  as De Chaulieu, who had not eaten a morsel of food since the previous  evening, owned to being hungry; so they directed their steps to the  door, lingering here and there as they went, to inspect a monument or  a painting, when, happening to turn his head aside to see if his wife,  who had stopt to take a last look at the tomb of King Dagobert, was  following, he beheld with horror the face of Jacques Rollet appearing  from behind a column! At the same instant, his wife joined him, and  took his arm, inquiring if he was not very much delighted with what  he had seen. He attempted to say yes, but the word would not be  forced out; and staggering out of the door, he alleged that a sudden  faintness had overcome him.    They conducted him to the Hotel, but Natalie now became seriously  alarmed; and well she might. His complexion looked ghastly, his limbs  shook, and his features bore an expression of indescribable horror and  anguish. What could be the meaning of so extraordinary a change in the  gay, witty, prosperous De Chaulieu, who, till that morning, seemed not  to have a care in the world? For, plead illness as he might, she felt  certain, from the expression of his features, that his sufferings were  not of the body but of the mind; and, unable to imagine any reason for  such extraordinary manifestations, of which she had never before seen  a symptom, but a sudden aversion to herself, and regret for the step  he had taken, her pride took the alarm, and, concealing the distress  she really felt, she began to assume a haughty and reserved manner  toward him, which he naturally interpreted into an evidence of anger  and contempt. The dinner was placed upon the table, but Du Chaulieu's  appetite of which he had lately boasted, was quite gone, nor was his  wife better able to eat. The young sister alone did justice to the  repast; but although the bridegroom could not eat, he could swallow  champagne in such copious draughts, that ere long the terror and  remorse that the apparition of Jacques Rollet had awakened in his  breast were drowned in intoxication. Amazed and indignant, poor  Natalie sat silently observing this elect of her heart, till overcome  with disappointment and grief, she quitted the room with her sister,  and retired to another apartment, where she gave free vent to her  feelings in tears.    After passing a couple of hours in confidences and lamentations, they  recollected that the hours of liberty granted, as an especial favor,  to Mademoiselle Hortense, had expired; but ashamed to exhibit her  husband in his present condition to the eyes of strangers, Natalie  prepared to re-conduct her to the _Maison Royale_ herself. Looking  into the dining-room as they passed, they saw De Chaulieu lying on a  sofa fast asleep, in which state he continued when his wife returned.  At length, however, the driver of their carriage begged to know if  Monsieur and Madame were ready to return to Paris, and it became  necessary to arouse him. The transitory effects of the champagne had  now sub sided; but when De Chaulieu recollected what had happened,  nothing could exceed his shame and mortification. So engrossing indeed  were these sensations that they quite overpowered his previous ones,  and, in his present vexation, he, for the moment, forgot his fears.  He knelt at his wife's feet, begged her pardon a thousand times, swore  that he adored her, and declared that the illness and the effect of  the wine had been purely the consequences of fasting and over-work.  It was not the easiest thing in the world to reassure a woman whose  pride, affection, and taste, had been so severely wounded; but Natalie  tried to believe, or to appear to do so, and a sort of reconciliation  ensued, not quite sincere on the part of the wife, and very humbling  on the part of the husband. Under these circumstances it was  impossible that he should recover his spirits or facility of manner;  his gayety was forced, his"]]]
