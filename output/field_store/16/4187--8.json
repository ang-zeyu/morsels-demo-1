Around are the names of the angels, Kokaviel, Ghedoriah,  Savaniah, and Chokmahiel (see fig. 25).      CORNELIUS AGRIPPA, in his _Three Books of Occult Philosophy_, describes  another interesting system of talismans. FRANCIS BARRETT'S _Magus, or  Celestial Intelligencer_, a well-known occult work published in the  first year of the nineteenth century, I may mention, copies AGRIPPA'S  system of talismans, without acknowledgment, almost word for word. To  each of the planets is assigned a magic square or table, _i.e_. a square  composed of numbers so arranged that the sum of each row or column is  always the same. For example, the table for Mars is as follows:--         11   24   7    20   3       4    12   25   8    16       17   5    13   21   9       10   18   1    14   22       23   6    19   2    15      It will be noticed that every number from 1 up to the highest possible  occurs once, and that no number occurs twice. It will also be seen that  the sum of each row and of each column is always 65. Similar squares  can be constructed containing any square number of figures, and it is,  indeed, by no means surprising that the remarkable properties of such  \"magic squares,\" before these were explained mathematically, gave rise  to the belief that they had some occult significance and virtue. From  the magic squares can be obtained certain numbers which are said to be  the numbers of the planets; their orderliness, we are told, reflects  the order of the heavens, and from a consideration of them the magical  properties of the planets which they represent can be arrived at. For  example, in the above table the number of rows of numbers is 5. The  total number of numbers in the table is the square of this number,  namely, 25, which is also the greatest number in the table. The sum of  any row or column is 65. And, finally, the sum of all the numbers is  the product of the number of rows (namely, 5) and the sum of any row  (namely, 65), _i.e_. 325. These numbers, namely, 5, 25, 65, and 325, are  the numbers of Mars. Sets of numbers for the other planets are obtained  in exactly the same manner.(1)      (1) Readers acquainted with mathematics will notice that if _n_ is the  number of rows in such a \"magic square,\" the other numbers derived as  above will be n<2S>, 1/2_n_(_n_<2S> + 1), and 1/2_n_<2S>(_n_<2S> + 1).  This can readily be proved by the laws of arithmetical progressions.  Rather similar but more complicated and less uniform \"magic squares\" are  attributed to PARACELSUS.      Now to each planet is assigned an Intelligence or good spirit, and an  Evil Spirit or demon; and the names of these spirits are related to  certain of the numbers of the planets. The other numbers are also  connected with holy and magical Hebrew names. AGRIPPA, and BARRETT  copying him, gives the following table of \"names answering to the  numbers of Mars\":--         5. He, the letter of the holy name.          <hb >       25.                                <hb ___>       65. Adonai.                             <hb ____>       325. Graphiel, the Intelligence of Mars.     <hb _______>       325. Barzabel, the Spirit of Mars.      <hb _______>    Similar tables are given for the other planets. The numbers can be  derived from the names by regarding the Hebrew letters of which they  are composed as numbers, in which case <hb > (Aleph) to <hb > (Teth)  represent the units 1 to 9 in order, <hb > (Jod) to <hb > (Tzade) the  tens 10 to 90 in order, <hb > (Koph) to <hb > (Tau) the hundreds 100 to  400, whilst the hundreds 500 to 900 are represented by special terminal  forms of certain of the Hebrew letters.(2) It is evident that no little  wasted ingenuity must have been employed in working all this out.      (2) It may be noticed that this makes <hb _______> equal to 326, one  unit too much. Possibly an Alelph should be omitted.      Each planet has its own seal or signature, as well as the signature of  its intelligence and the signature of its demon. These signatures were  supposed to represent the characters of the planets' intelligences and  demons respectively. The signature of Mars is shown in fig. 26, that of  its intelligence in fig. 27, and that of its demon in fig. 28.    These various details were inscribed on the talismans each of which was  supposed to confer its own peculiar benefits--as follows: On one side  must be engraved the proper magic table and the astrological sign of  the planet, together with the highest planetary number, the sacred names  corresponding to the planet, and the name of the intelligence of  the planet, but not the name of its demon. On the other side must be  engraved the seals of the planet and of its intelligence, and also the  astrological sign. BARRETT says, regarding the demons:(1) \"It is to be  understood that the intelligences are the presiding good angels that are  set over the planets; but that the spirits or daemons, with their names,  seals, or characters, are never inscribed upon any Talisman, except to  execute any evil effect, and that they are subject to the intelligences,  or good spirits; and again, when the spirits and their characters are  used, it will be more conducive to the effect to add some divine name  appropriate to that effect which we desire.\" Evil talismans can also be  prepared, we are informed, by using a metal antagonistic to the signs  engraved thereon. The complete talisman of Mars is shown in fig. 29.      (1) FRANCIS BARRETT: _The Magus, or Celestial Intelligencer_ (1801), bk.  i. p. 146.      ALPHONSE LOUIS CONSTANT,(1) a famous French occultist of the nineteenth  century, who wrote under the name of \"ELIPHAS LEVI,\" describes yet  another system of talismans. He says: \"The Pentagram must be always  engraved on one side of the talisman, with a circle for the Sun, a  crescent for the Moon, a winged caduceus for Mercury, a sword for Mars,  a G for Venus, a crown for Jupiter, and a scythe for Saturn. The other  side of the talisman should bear the sign of Solomon, that is, the  six-pointed star formed by two interlaced triangles; in the centre there  should be placed a human figure for the sun talismans, a cup for those  of the Moon, a dog's head for those of Jupiter, a lion for those of  Mars, a dove's for those of Venus, a bull's or goat's for those of  Saturn. The names of the seven angels should be added either in Hebrew,  Arabic, or magic characters similar to those of the alphabets of  Trimethius. The two triangles of Solomon may be replaced by the double  cross of Ezekiel's wheels, this being found on a great number of ancient  pentacles. All objects of this nature, whether in metals or in precious  stones, should be carefully wrapped in silk satchels of a colour  analogous to the spirit of the planet, perfumed with the perfumes of the  corresponding day, and preserved from all impure looks and touches.\"(2)    (1) For a biographical and critical account of this extraordinary  personage and his views, see Mr A. E. WAITE'S _The Mysteries of Magic: a  Digest of the writings of_ ELIPHAS LEVI (1897).    (2) _Op. cit_., p. 201.      ELIPHAS LEVI, following PYTHAGORAS and many of the mediaeval magicians,  regarded the pentagram, or five-pointed star, as an extremely powerful  pentacle. According to him, if with one horn in the ascendant it is the  sign of the microcosm--Man. With two horns in the ascendant, however,  it is the sign of the Devil, \"the accursed Goat of Mendes,\" and an  instrument of black magic. We can, indeed, trace some faint likeness  between the pentagram and the outline form of a man, or of a goat's  head, according to whether it has one or two horns in the ascendant  respectively, which resemblances may account for this idea. Fig. 30  shows the pentagram embellished with other symbols according to ELIPHAS  LEVI, whilst fig. 31 shows his embellished form of the six-pointed star,  or Seal of SOLOMON. This, he says, is \"the sign of the Macrocosmos,  but is less powerful than the Pentagram, the microcosmic sign,\" thus  contradicting PYTHAGORAS, who, as we have seen, regarded the pentagram  as the sign of the Macrocosm. ELIPHAS LEVI asserts that he attempted the  evocation of the spirit of APOLLONIUS of Tyana in London on 24th July  1854, by the aid of a pentagram and other magical apparatus and ritual,  apparently with success, if we may believe his word. But he sensibly  suggests that probably the apparition which appeared was due to the  effect of the ceremonies on his own imagination, and comes to the  conclusion that such magical experiments are injurious to health.(1)      (1) _Op cit_. pp. 446-450.      Magical rings were prepared on the same principle as were talismans.  Says CORNELIUS AGRIPPA: \"The manner of making these kinds of Magical  Rings is this, viz.: When any Star ascends fortunately, with the  fortunate aspect or conjunction of the Moon, we must take a stone and  herb that is under that Star, and make a ring of the metal that is  suitable to this Star, and in it fasten the stone, putting the herb  or root under it--not omitting the inscriptions of images, names, and  characters, as also the proper suffumigations....\"(1) SOLOMON'S ring  was supposed to have been possessed of remarkable occult virtue. Says  JOSEPHUS (_c_. A.D. 37-100): \"God also enabled him (SOLOMON) to learn  that skill which expels demons, which is a science useful and sanative  to men. He composed such incantations also by which distempers are  alleviated. And he left behind him the manner of using exorcisms, by  which they drive away demons, so that they never return; and this method  of cure is of great force unto"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12753"],[0,"The Legends of King Arthur and His Knights (#12)"],[1,"help each other, as brethren ought  to do.\"    Anon by chance, as they were talking, came King Mark, of Cornwall, by that  way, and when he saw the two dead bodies of Sir Lancear and his lady lying  there, and heard the story of their death, he vowed to build a tomb to  them before he left that place. So pitching his pavilion there, he sought  through all the country round to find a monument, and found at last a rich  and fair one in a church, which he took and raised above the dead knight  and his damsel, writing on it--\"Here lieth Lancear, son of the King of  Ireland, who, at his own request, was slain by Balin; and here beside him  also lieth his lady Colombe, who slew herself with her lover's sword for  grief and sorrow.\"    Then as Sir Balin and Sir Balan rode away, Merlin met with them, and said  to Balin, \"Thou hast done thyself great harm not to have saved that lady's  life who slew herself; and because of it, thou shalt strike the most  Dolorous Stroke that ever man struck, save he that smote our Lord. For  thou shalt smite the truest and most worshipful of living knights, who  shall not be recovered from his wounds for many years, and through that  stroke three kingdoms shall be overwhelmed in poverty and misery.\"    \"If I believed,\" said Balin, \"what thou sayest, I would slay myself to  make thee a liar.\"    At that Merlin vanished suddenly away; but afterwards he met them in  disguise towards night, and told them he could lead them to King Ryence,  whom they sought. \"For this night he is to ride with sixty lances only  through a wood hard by.\"    So Sir Balin and Sir Balan hid themselves within the wood, and at midnight  came out from their ambush among the leaves by the highway, and waited for  the king, whom presently they heard approaching with his company. Then did  they suddenly leap forth and smote at him and overthrew him and laid him  on the ground, and turning on his company wounded and slew forty of them,  and put the rest to flight. And returning to King Ryence they would have  slain him there, but he craved mercy, and yielded to their grace, crying,  \"Knights full of prowess, slay me not; for by my life ye may win  something--but my death can avail ye nought.\"    \"Ye say truth,\" said the two knights, and put him in a horse-litter, and  went swiftly through all the night, till at cock-crow they came to King  Arthur's palace. There they delivered him to the warders and porters, to  be brought before the king, with this message--\"That he was sent to King  Arthur by the knight of the two swords (for so was Balin known by name,  since his adventure with the damsel) and by his brother.\" And so they rode  away again ere sunrise.    Within a month or two thereafter, King Arthur being somewhat sick, went  forth outside the town, and had his pavilion pitched in a meadow, and  there abode, and laid him down on a pallet to sleep, but could get no  rest. And as he lay he heard the sound of a great horse, and looking out  of the tent door, saw a knight ride by, making great lamentation.    \"Abide, fair sir,\" said King Arthur, \"and tell me wherefore thou makest  this sorrow.\"    \"Ye may little amend it,\" said the knight, and so passed on.    Presently after Sir Balin, rode, by chance, past that meadow, and when he  saw the king he alighted and came to him on foot, and kneeled and saluted  him.    \"By my head,\" said King Arthur, \"ye be welcome, Sir Balin;\" and then he  thanked him heartily for revenging him upon King Ryence, and for sending  him so speedily a prisoner to his castle, and told him how King Nero,  Ryence's brother, had attacked him afterwards to deliver Ryence from  prison; and how he had defeated him and slain him, and also King Lot, of  Orkney who was joined with Nero, and whom King Pellinore had killed in the  battle. Then when they had thus talked, King Arthur told Sir Balin of the  sullen knight that had just passed his tent, and desired him to pursue him  and to bring him back.    So Sir Balin rode and overtook the knight in a forest with a damsel, and  said, \"Sir knight, thou must come back with me unto my lord, King Arthur,  to tell him the cause of thy sorrow, which thou hast refused even now to  do.\"    \"That will I not,\" replied the knight, \"for it would harm me much, and do  him no advantage.\"    \"Sir,\" said Sir Balin, \"I pray thee make ready, for thou must needs go  with me--or else I must fight with thee and take thee by force.\"    \"Wilt thou be warrant for safe conduct, if I go with thee?\" inquired the  knight.    \"Yea, surely,\" answered Balin, \"I will die else.\"    So the knight made ready to go with Sir Balin, and left the damsel in the  wood.    But as they went, there came one invisible, and smote the knight through  the body with a spear. \"Alas,\" cried Sir Herleus (for so was he named), \"I  am slain under thy guard and conduct, by that traitor knight called  Garlon, who through magic and witchcraft rideth invisibly. Take,  therefore, my horse, which is better than thine, and ride to the damsel  whom we left, and the quest I had in hand, as she will lead thee--and  revenge my death when thou best mayest.\"    \"That will I do,\" said Sir Balin, \"by my knighthood, and so I swear to  thee.\"    Then went Sir Balin to the damsel, and rode forth with her; she carrying  ever with her the truncheon of the spear wherewith Sir Herleus had been  slain. And as they went, a good knight, Perin de Mountbelgard, joined  their company, and vowed to take adventure with them wheresoever they  might go. But presently as they passed a hermitage fast by a churchyard,  came the knight Garlon, again invisible, and smote Sir Perin through the  body with a spear, and slew him as he had slain Sir Herleus. Whereat, Sir  Balin greatly raged, and swore to have Sir Garlon's life, whenever next he  might encounter and behold him in his bodily shape. Anon, he and the  hermit buried the good knight Sir Perin, and rode on with the damsel till  they came to a great castle, whereinto they were about to enter. But when  Sir Balin had passed through the gateway, the portcullis fell behind him  suddenly, leaving the damsel on the outer side, with men around her,  drawing their swords as if to slay her.    When he saw that, Sir Balin climbed with eager haste by wall and tower,  and leaped into the castle moat, and rushed towards the damsel and her  enemies, with his sword drawn, to fight and slay them. But they cried out,  \"Put up thy sword, Sir knight, we will not fight thee in this quarrel, for  we do nothing but an ancient custom of this castle.\"    Then they told him that the lady of the castle was sick, and had lain ill  for many years, and might never more be cured, unless she had a silver  dish full of the blood of a pure maid and a king's daughter. Wherefore the  custom of the castle was, that never should a damsel pass that way but she  must give a dish full of her blood. Then Sir Balin suffered them to bleed  the damsel with her own consent, but her blood helped not the lady of the  castle. So on the morrow they departed, after right good cheer and rest.    Then they rode three or four days without adventure and came at last to  the abode of a rich man, who sumptuously lodged and fed them. And while  they sat at supper Sir Balin heard a voice of some one groaning  grievously. \"What noise is this?\" said he.    \"Forsooth,\" said the host, \"I will tell you. I was lately at a tournament,  and there I fought a knight who is brother to King Pelles, and overthrew  him twice, for which he swore to be revenged on me through my best friend,  and so he wounded my son, who cannot be recovered till I have that  knight's blood, but he rideth through witchcraft always invisibly, and I  know not his name.\"    \"Ah,\" said Sir Balin, \"but I know him; his name is Garlon, and he hath  slain two knights, companions of mine own, in the same fashion, and I  would rather than all the riches in this realm that I might meet him face  to face.\"    \"Well,\" said his host, \"let me now tell thee that King Pelles hath  proclaimed in all the country a great festival, to be held at Listeniss,  in twenty days from now, whereto no knight may come without a lady. At  that great feast we might perchance find out this Garlon, for many will be  there; and if it please thee we will set forth together.\"    So on the morrow they rode all three towards Listeniss, and travelled  fifteen days, and reached it on the day the feast began. Then they  alighted and stabled their horses, and went up to the castle, and Sir  Balin's host was denied entrance, having no lady with him. But Sir Balin  was right heartily received, and taken to a chamber, where they unarmed  him, and dressed him in rich robes, of any colour that he chose, and told  him he must lay aside his sword. This, however, he refused, and said, \"It  is the custom of my country for a knight to keep his sword ever with him;  and if I may not keep it here, I will forthwith depart.\" Then they gave  him leave to wear his sword. So he went to the great hall, and was set  among knights of rank and worship, and his lady before him.    Soon he found means to ask one who sat near him, \"Is there not here a  knight whose name is Garlon?\"    \"Yonder he goeth,\" said his neighbour, \"he with that black face; he is the  most marvellous knight alive, for he rideth invisibly, and destroyeth whom  he will.\"    \"Ah, well,\" said Balin, drawing a long breath, \"is that indeed the man? I  have aforetime heard of him.\"    Then he mused long within himself, and thought, \"If I shall slay him here  and now, I shall not escape myself; but if I leave him, peradventure I  shall never meet with him again at such advantage; and if he live, how  much more harm and mischief will he do!\"    But while he deeply thought, and cast his eyes from time to time upon Sir  Garlon, that false knight saw that he watched him, and thinking that he  could at such a time escape revenge, he came and smote Sir Balin on the  face with the"]]]
