The firing of a second musket  over their heads did not draw from them any kind of notice. At last  one of them having lifted up his spear to dart it at the boat, another  piece was fired, by which he was shot dead. At the fall of their  associate, the three remaining Indians stood for awhile motionless,  and seemed petrified with astonishment. No sooner had they recovered  themselves, than they went back, dragging after them the dead body,  which, however, they were obliged to leave, that it might not retard  their flight. Lieutenant Cook and his friends, who had straggled to a  little distance from each other, were drawn together upon the report  of the first musket, and returned speedily to the boat, in which  having crossed the river, they soon beheld the Indian lying dead upon  the ground. After their return to the ship, they could hear the people  on shore talking with great earnestness, and in a very loud tone of  voice.    Notwithstanding this disaster, the lieutenant being desirous of  establishing an intercourse with the natives, ordered, on the  following day, three boats to be manned with seamen and marines, and  proceeded towards the shore, accompanied by Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander,  the other gentlemen, and Tupia. About fifty of the inhabitants seemed  to wait for their landing, having seated themselves upon the ground,  on the opposite side of the river. This being regarded as a sign of  fear, Mr. Cook, with only Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and Tupia, advanced  towards them; but they had not gone many paces before all the Indians  started up, and every man produced either a long pike, or a small  weapon of green talk. Though Tupia called to them in the language of  Otaheite, they only answered by flourishing their weapons, and making  signs for the gentlemen to depart. On a musket being fired wide of  them, they desisted from their threats; and our commander, who had  prudently retreated till the marines could be landed, again advanced  towards them, with Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and Tupia, to whom were  now added Mr. Green and Mr. Monkhouse. Tupia was a second time  directed to speak to them, and it was perceived with great pleasure  that he was perfectly understood, his and their language being the  same, excepting only in a diversity of dialect. He informed them that  our voyagers only wanted provision and water, in exchange for iron,  the properties of which he explained as far as he was able. Though the  natives seemed willing to trade, Tupia was sensible, during the course  of his conversation with them, that their intentions were unfriendly;  and of this he repeatedly warned the English gentlemen. At length,  twenty or thirty of the Indians were induced to cross the river, upon  which presents were made them of iron and beads. On these they  appeared to set little value and particularly on the iron, not having  the least conception of its use, so that nothing was obtained in  return excepting a few feathers. Their arms, indeed, they offered to  exchange for those of our voyagers, and this being refused, they made  various attempts to snatch them out of their hands. Tupia was now  instructed to acquaint the Indians, that our gentlemen would be  obliged to kill them, if they proceeded to any further violence;  notwithstanding which, one of them, while Mr. Green happened to turn  about, seized his hanger, and retired to a little distance, with a  shout of exultation. The others, at the same time, began to be  extremely insolent, and more of the natives were seen coming to join  them from the opposite side of the river. It being, therefore,  necessary to repress them, Mr. Banks fired, with small shot, at the  distance of about fifteen yards, upon the man who had taken the  hanger. Though he was struck, he did not return the hanger, but  continued to wave it round his head, while he slowly made his retreat.  Mr. Monkhouse then fired at him with ball, and he instantly dropped.  So far, however, were the Indians from being sufficiently terrified,  that the main body of them, who, upon the first discharge, had retired  to a rock in the middle of the river, began to return, and it was with  no small difficulty that Mr. Monkhouse secured the hanger. The whole  number of them continuing to advance, three of the English party  discharged their pieces at them, loaded only with small shot, upon  which they swam back for the shore, and it appeared, upon their  landing, that two or three of them were wounded. While they retired  slowly up the country, Lieutenant Cook and his companions re-embarked  in their boats.    As the lieutenant had unhappily experienced that nothing, at this  place, could be done with these people and found that the water in the  river was salt, he proceeded in the boats round the head of the bay in  search of fresh water. Beside this, he had formed a design of  surprising some of the natives, and taking them on board, that, by  kind treatment and presents he might obtain their friendship, and  render them the instruments of establishing for him an amicable  intercourse with their countrymen. While, upon account of a dangerous  surf which every where beat upon the shore, the boats were prevented  from landing, our commander saw two canoes coming in from the sea, one  under sail, and the other worked with paddles. This he thought to be a  favourable opportunity for executing his purpose. Accordingly, the  boats were disposed in such a manner as appeared most likely to be  successful in intercepting the canoes. Notwithstanding this, the  Indians in the canoe which was paddled exerted themselves with so much  vigour, at the first apprehension of danger, that they escaped to the  nearest land. The other canoe sailed on without discerning the  English, till she was in the midst of them; but no sooner had she  discovered them, than the people on board struck their sail, and plied  their paddles so briskly, as to outrun the boat by which they were  pursued. Being within hearing, Tupia called to them to come alongside,  with assurances that they should not in any degree be hurt or injured.  They trusted, however, more to their own paddles than to Tupia's  promises, and continued to flee from our navigators with all their  power. Mr. Cook, as the least exceptionable expedient of accomplishing  his design, ordered a musket to be fired over their heads. This, he  hoped, would either make them surrender or leap into the water, but it  produced a contrary effect. The Indians, who were seven in number,  immediately formed a resolution not to fly, but to fight. When,  therefore, the boat came up, they began to attack with their paddles,  and with stones and other offensive weapons; and they carried it on  with so much vigour and violence, that the English thought themselves  obliged to fire upon them in their own defence; the consequence of  which was, that four were unhappily killed. The other three, who were  boys, the eldest about nineteen, and the youngest about eleven,  instantly leaped into the water, and endeavoured to make their escape;  but being with some difficulty overpowered by our people, they were  brought into the boat.    It is impossible to reflect upon this part of Lieutenant Cook's  conduct with any degree of satisfaction. He, himself, upon a calm  review, did not approve of it; and he was sensible that it would be  censured by the feelings of every reader of humanity. It is probable  that his mind was so far irritated by the disagreeable preceding  events of this unfortunate day, and by the unexpected violence of the  Indians in the canoe, as to lose somewhat of that self-possession, by  which his character in general was eminently distinguished. Candour,  however, requires, that I should relate what he hath offered in  extenuation, not in defence, of the transaction; and this shall be  done in his own words. \"These people certainly did not deserve death  for not choosing to confide in my promises, or not consenting to come  on board my boat, even if they had apprehended no danger. But the  nature of my service required me to obtain a knowledge of their  country, which I could no otherwise effect, than by forcing my way  into it in a hostile manner, or gaining admission through the  confidence and goodwill of the people. I had already tried the power  of presents without effect; and I was now prompted, by my desire to  avoid further hostilities, to get some of them on board, as the only  method left of convincing them, that we intended them no harm, and had  it in our power to contribute to their gratification and convenience.  Thus far my intentions certainly were not criminal; and though in the  contest, which I had not the least reason to expect, our victory might  have been complete without so great an expense of life; yet in such  situations, when the command to fire has been given, no man can  restrain its excess, or prescribe its effect.\"    Our voyagers were successful in conciliating the minds of the three  boys, to which Tupia particularly contributed. When their fears were  allayed, and their cheerfulness returned, they sang a song with a  degree of taste, that surprised the English gentlemen. The tune, like  those of our psalms, was solemn and slow, containing many notes and  semitones.    Some further attempts were made to establish an intercourse with the  natives, and Mr. Cook and his friends, on the 10th, went on shore for  that purpose; but being unsuccessful in their endeavours, they  resolved to re-embark lest their stay should embroil them in another  quarrel, and cost more of the Indians their lives. On the next day the  lieutenant weighed anchor, and stood away from this unfortunate and  inhospitable place. As it had not afforded a single article that was  wanted excepting wood, he gave it the name of Poverty Bay. By the  inhabitants it is called Taoneroa, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7787"],[0,"A Complete Grammar of Esperanto (#11)"],[1,"blankan cxevalon.\" La ruza juna  viro ne hontis.

THE DEMONSTRATIVE ADVERB OF PLACE.    68. The demonstrative adverbs of place related to the pronouns \"tiu\" and  \"cxi tiu\" are \"tie\", there, in (at) that place, and \"cxi tie\", here, in  (at) this place:       La telero estas tie, the plate is there (in that place).     La libroj kusxas cxi tie, the books lie here (in this place).     Mi trovis vin tie kaj lin tie cxi, I found you there and him here.     Tie la vetero sxajnas tre agrabla,        there the weather seems very pleasant.    69. If the verb in the sentence expresses motion toward the place  indicated by \"tie\" or \"cxi tie\", the ending \"-n\" is added to the adverb  (46), forming \"tien\", thither, there, and \"cxi tien\", hither, here:       Li iros tien, he will go there (thither).     Mi venis cxi tien, I came here (hither).     Ni estis tie, kaj venis cxi tien,        we were there and came here (hither).                                   ACCOMPANIMENT.    70. Accompaniment or association is expressed by the preposition \"kun\",  with, along with:       La viro venis kun sia amiko, the man came with his friend.     Mi promenos kun vi, I shall go walking with you.     La knabo kun tiu viro estas lia frato,        the boy with that man is his brother.    [Footnote: \"Kun\" must not be confused with \"per\" (64), which expresses  instrumentality, although per may often be translated by English \"with.\"  The English preposition \"with\" may be said to have three rather clearly  defined different meanings. In the linguistic history of this word,  the original meaning was \"against,\" still shown in \"fight with, strive  with, contend with, withstand\", etc. (Cf. German \"widerstreiten\", to  strive with, \"widerhalten\", to resist, etc.) Gradually this word \"with\"  usurped the meaning of the original preposition \"mid,\" expressing  association or accompaniment (cf. German \"mit\", with, which it crowded  out of the language except in one unimportant compound). The word  \"by\" was also encroaching upon \"mid\" from another direction, and so  \"mid's\" successor \"with\" came to be interchangeable with \"by\" in  expressing instrumentality. Thus, English \"with\" indicates opposition,  accompaniment, or instrumentality, for which three senses Esperanto has  the three prepositions \"kontraux\", \"kun\", and \"per\", respectively.]                                 THE ADVERB \"FOR\".    71. The adverb \"for\", away, may be used independently, as \"Li iris  for de mi\", he went away from me, but it is more frequently used as a  prefix to give a sense of departure, loss or somewhat forcible removal:       foriri = to go away, to depart.     forkuri = to run away, to escape.     forlasi = to leave alone, to abandon, to desert.     formangxi = to eat away, to eat up.     forpreni = to take away, to remove.     fortrinki = to drink away, to drink up.    [Footnote: Cf. the prefix \"for-\" in English \"forfend,\" to keep away,  to avert, \"forbid,\" to exclude from, to command against, \"forbear,\" to  refrain from, etc.]                               THE MEANING OF \"POVI\".    72. The verb \"povi\", to be able, is used to translate English \"can\",  which is defective, that is, does not occur in all of the forms a verb  may have:       Mi povas paroli, I am able to talk, I can talk.     Mi povis paroli, I was able to talk, I could talk.     Mi povos paroli, I shall be able to talk, ------.     Mi volas povi paroli, I wish to be able to talk, ------.                                     VOCABULARY       el = out of, out.                  peli = to drive, to chase.     cxirkaux = around, roundabout.     posxo = pocket.     for = away (71).                   rajdi = to ride.     frua = early.                      rapidi = to hasten.     glavo = sword.                     resti = to remain, to stay.     horo = hour.                       sagxa = wise.     kun = with (70).                   tie = there (68).     lasi = to leave.                   voki = to call.                              MALAMIKOJ EN LA DEZERTO.    Juna viro kaj lia sagxa patro volis iri trans la dezerton, kun siaj  amikoj. La amikoj estis fortaj, kaj la juna viro estis tre kuragxa. Ili  restis en malgranda urbo dum la nokto, kaj forrajdis kun tiuj amikoj.  La patro kaj la filo opiniis ke la amikoj kun ili povos helpi per siaj  akraj glavoj. Ili opiniis ke ili povos forpeli la malamikojn. Ecx en  la dezerto oni trovas malamikojn. Tiaj malamikoj forprenas la monon de  bonaj viroj. La juna viro estis kontenta, cxar li estis kun la amikoj.  La maljuna viro estis kontenta cxar li estis kun sia filo. Baldaux la  nokto venis. Estis tre malluma tie en la dezerto, kaj ili preskaux ne  povis vidi. Dum la fruaj horoj de la nokto la patro auxdis vocxojn, kaj  preskaux tuj li vidis la malamikojn. La ruzaj malbonaj viroj rapidis  tien, kaj vokis la maljunan viron. La malkuragxaj amikoj de la patro kaj  filo nek restis tie, nek helpis forpeli la malamikojn. Ili tuj forkuris.  La malamikoj staris cxirkaux la patro, kaj forpusxis lin de lia cxevalo.  La filo volis malhelpi ilin, sed li ne povis. Li povis nur resti kun la  patro, kaj gardi lin tie kontraux la glavoj de la malamikoj. Baldaux la  malamikoj komencis forpreni la monon el la posxoj de la sagxa maljuna  viro. La kolera filo diris per maldolcxa (\"bitter\") vocxo \"Cxu vi ne  hontas? Cxu vi lasos al ni nek la cxevalojn nek nian monon?\" Sed la  malamikoj respondis \"Ne, ni lasos al vi nek la cxevalojn nek la monon.  Ni ne estas malsagxaj.\" Post tiu diro ili tuj forrapidis, kaj prenis kun  si la cxevalojn.                             SENTENCES FOR TRANSLATION.    1. The foolish friends of the young man and his aged father did not stay  with them. 2. They did not help them with their swords, but ran away at  once (\"tuj\"), and were not ashamed. 3. The old man heard disagreeable  voices behind him, and soon he saw the enemy. 4. The enemy called them,  and hastened there (69). 5. Those sly bad men took the money out of  the pockets of the courageous young man. 6. They stood around him, and  also around his father. 7. The father and son could not even guard  their horses. 8. The enemy did not leave (to) these their horses, but  took both the horses and the money. 9. Soon the enemy rode away, during  the late hours of the night. 10. The father and son were angry and  dissatisfied. 11. They said \"We fear and dislike such men.\" 12. The  father said \"By the help of our neighbors we can (\"povos\") find those  bad men, and drive them away, out of the desert.\" 13. The son replied,  \"Dear Father, such a proposal seems good, and I will help with my long  sharp sword. 14. But we are now in the desert, and the road to the city  is long. 15. We cannot ride thither, but we can walk thither. 16. Can  you not hasten, with (\"per\") my help?\" 17. The wise old man answered,  \"Yes, my son, with such help I can walk thither.\"                                      LESSON XVII.                       THE DEMONSTRATIVE TEMPORAL ADVERB.    73. The demonstrative temporal adverb related to the demonstrative  pronoun \"tiu\" is \"tiam\", then, at that time:       Tiam li rajdos al la urbo, then he will ride to the city.     Nun ili estas sagxaj, sed tiam ili estis malsagxaj,        now they are wise, but at that time they were foolish.                             COMPARISON OF ADJECTIVES.    74. An adjective may have three degrees, \"positive\", \"comparative\" and  \"superlative.\" English has various ways of forming the comparative  and superlative degrees (as by the suffixes \"-er, -est,\" the adverbs  \"more, most,\" and irregular methods as in \"good, better, best,\" etc.).  Esperanto has only one method, using the adverbs \"pli\", more, and  \"plej\", most:       POSITIVE.        COMPARATIVE.              SUPERLATIVE.     ---------------  ------------------------  --------------------------     bela, beautiful  pli bela, more beautiful  plej bela, most beautiful     bona, good       pli bona, better          plej bona, best     malbona, bad     pli malbona, worse        plej malbona, worst     sagxa, wise      pli sagxa, wiser          plej sagxa, wisest    75.
