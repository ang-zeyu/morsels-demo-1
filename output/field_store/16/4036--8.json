In the horse the  quantity secreted in twenty-four hours varies from twelve to fifteen pints;  in cattle from ten to forty pints; in sheep from one-half to one and  three-quarter pints. The normal color of the urine varies. In the horse it  is yellow or yellowish-red; in cattle and sheep yellowish; and in the dog a  straw yellow. The specific gravity varies with the quantity secreted and  the ration fed. When the quantity of urine secreted is above the average,  the specific gravity is usually low.    THE NECESSITY OF EXAMINING THE URINE.--In diseases of the urinary  apparatus, a careful examination of the urine is very necessary in order to  be able to form a correct diagnosis. In domestic animals it is impractical  to attempt to determine the exact amount of urine passed within a certain  time, but we can make a general estimate of the quantity passed by  carefully observing the animal and noting the condition of the bedding in  the stall. The sample of urine to be examined is best taken from urine  collected at different periods during the day. We should note its color and  consistency. The different substances in the urine can be determined only  by determining the specific gravity, testing with certain chemical reagents  and by making a microscopic examination of the sediment. Normal urine from  the horse may be turbid or cloudy and more or less slimy, because of the  presence of mucin. This is less true of other species. In disease the color  of the urine may be changed to a pale yellow, red or brown. For example, in  congestion of the kidneys the urine is light in color and rather  transparent; in southern cattle fever it may be red; and in azoturia it may  be brown.    EXCESSIVE URINATION.--The horse is the most common sufferer from excessive  secretion of urine. The most common _causes_ are musty feeds, such as hay,  grain and shipped feeds. New oats, succulent feeds and acrid plants may  sometimes cause it. In the fall of the year, when the season is changing  from warm to cool weather and the horse eliminates less water from the body  by way of the skin, the kidneys may become more active and the quantity of  urine secreted be greatly increased. This, however, is a normal  physiological condition and should not be confused with this disease.    The first _symptom_ noted is the frequent passing of a large quantity of  urine. The animal drinks more water than usual and the appetite is poor.  Dulness and a weak, emaciated condition are prominent symptoms. Death  occurs unless the cause of the disease is removed. If the poisonous  substance has been acting for some time, it is difficult to cure the  animal.    This disease can be _prevented_ by eliminating spoiled feeds from the  ration fed to animals in our care. Early in the attack the necessary  attention to the ration and the feeding of a clean, nourishing ration is  sufficient to correct the disease. The quantity of water drunk by the  animal should be limited. Complete rest is indicated. Laxatives, stimulants  and tonics should be given if necessary.    NEPHRITIS.--Congestion and inflammation of the kidneys commonly occur in  mixed and specific infectious diseases, such as septicaemia, pyaemia and  influenza. The toxic effect of spoiled feeds, impure drinking water, and  irritating drugs like cantharides and turpentine may so irritate the  kidneys as to cause them to become inflamed. Chilling of the skin and  nervousness or extreme fear may sometimes cause a congestion of these  organs. Inflammation of the kidneys is a common complication of azoturia.  Irritation from parasites should be included among the causes of this  disease.    The _symptoms_ vary in the different stages of the disease. During the  period of active congestion the quantity of urine secreted is increased.  The scant secretion of urine, dark in color and thick or turbid, is  suggestive of an inflammation of the kidneys. The animal moves stiffly, the  back may be arched, urination is painful and the urine is passed in very  small amounts. The appetite is irregular or suppressed, the pulse strong at  first but later small and weak, and the body temperature is elevated. On  making a rectal examination we find the bladder empty and the kidneys  enlarged and sensitive.    When the kidneys become so badly diseased that they can no longer perform  their function of separating from the blood the nitrogenous end-products of  digestion, uraemic poisoning occurs. In this later stage of the disease the  animal staggers about if moved, and finally goes down in the stall and is  unable to get up. Death is usually preceded by convulsions and coma.    _The prognosis_ is very unfavorable, death occurring in the majority of  cases. In azoturia of horses and in infectious diseases, the inflammation  is nearly always acute. The color of the urine, its high specific gravity  and the small quantity passed are valuable symptoms to consider in the  recognition of this disease. Chronic inflammation generally develops slowly  and may not give rise to any very prominent symptoms at first.    _The preventive treatment_ of nephritis consists in careful nursing of  animals affected with acute infectious diseases, a clean water supply and  avoiding the feeding of spoiled feeds. The _curative treatment_ is largely  careful nursing. The animal should be given comfortable, well-ventilated  quarters and complete rest. Chilling of the skin should be especially  guarded against by protecting the body with heavy blankets and applying  roller bandages to the limbs when necessary. The diet must be of such a  nature as not to increase the work of the kidneys. For the first few days  the animal should receive very little feed or water. Later a sloppy diet of  sweet milk, green feed and mashes should be fed. Such purgatives as aloes  and Glauber's salts are indicated at a very early stage in the disease. We  must encourage the elimination of waste products by way of the skin in the  larger animals by vigorous rubbing, blanketing and the administration of  such drugs as pilocarpine. If the animal becomes weak, general and heart  tonics may be given.    CYSTITIS.--Inflammation of the bladder is not an uncommon disease of  horses. It is commonly _caused_ by retention of the urine, calculi in the  bladder and chilling of the body. Irritating drugs that are eliminated from  the body in the urine, and infection of the bladder by germs may cause it.    _The symptoms_ are usually marked. The inflammation is characterized by  more or less pain, depending on the degree of the inflammation, and  frequent passing of urine. Only a small amount of urine is passed at each  attempt, and in severe inflammation it may contain pus or blood. Colicky  pains sometimes occur. The pain is usually manifested by a stiff,  straddling gait and tenderness when pressure on the bladder is made by  introducing the hand into the rectum or vagina, and pressing over the  region of the bladder. General symptoms, such as elevation in body  temperature and irregular appetite, may be manifested.    _The treatment_ should be first directed at removing the cause. If a cystic  calculus is present in the bladder it should be removed. If the retention  of the urine is caused by some local condition, and this is very often the  case in nervous, well-bred animals, this must first be corrected. It is  best to feed green and soft feeds, such as bran mash and chopped hay, and,  if the animal will take them, gruels. A physic of castor or linseed oil  should be given occasionally. It is very necessary that the animal be kept  quiet. Comfortable, clean quarters and a good bed should be provided.  Whenever necessary the animal should be blanketed. The medicinal treatment  consists in irrigating the bladder with antiseptic solutions, and  administering drugs that when eliminated by way of the urine may change its  composition and render it less irritating. The following mixture may be  given: potassium chlorate two ounces, salol one-half ounce, and powdered  nux vomica one ounce. This mixture may be divided into sixteen powders. One  of the powders should be given with each feed.    RETENTION OF THE URINE.--This may be due to a variety of _causes_. In the  ox and ram, small calculi collect in the S-shaped curvature of the urethra,  or at its terminal extremity. In the horse, cystic calculi are more common  than urethral. In cattle and hogs, fatty secretions from the inflamed  lining membrane of the sheath of the male may accumulate, and obstruct the  flow of urine from the anterior opening. The giving of feed rich in salts,  concentrated urine resulting from feeding of too dry a ration, insufficient  exercise and inflammation of the bladder are the direct causes of calculi.    Compression of the urethra by growths or tumors, strictures of the urethra,  distended bladder, spasm of the neck of the bladder in nervous animals,  paralysis of the bladder and injuries to the penis are common causes of  retention of the urine.    _The early symptoms in ruminants_ are not usually recognized until a day or  two after retention of the urine has occurred. The symptoms are then quite  marked. The animal acts dull, refuses to eat, rumination is stopped, and  there is a constant effort to urinate, as indicated by the raising of the  tail and rhythmical contractions of the urinary muscles just below the  anus. Urine may dribble from the sheath or the flow may be completely  suppressed. The odor of urine may be marked.    _Horses show symptoms_ of abdominal pain. The animal may move about the  stall, lie down and get up again, or make unsuccessful attempts to urinate.  On examination the bladder is found to be greatly distended with urine. In  the horse the retention is recognized at an earlier period than in  ruminants, because of the prompt, decided symptom of pain.    Retention of the urine commonly terminates in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8508"],[0,"The Evolution of Man Scientifically Disproved in 50 Arguments (#11)"],[1,"00, defective hearing; 1,000,000 have active  tuberculosis; 250,000, heart trouble; 3,000,000 to 5,000,000 are  underfed; total, 12,250,000,--more than half. Must all these  defectives perish in order that man may reach perfection? Less than  half are the \"fittest\" and they only could survive.    LOCATION OF ORGANS. But if the evolutionist _could_  convince the thoughtful student that the marvelous eye could have been  so formed, by blind chance or natural selection, how could he account  for the advantageous location of the eye and other organs? While we  can not well name a fraction small enough to express the mathematical  probability of the formation of the eye, the ear, and other organs of  the body, we easily can compute the fraction of the probability of  their location, though very small. In the passage quoted from Darwin,  he begins with the simple eye, but does not say how the eye  originated. Hon.  William J. Bryan in his book, \"In His Image,\" p. 97,  says, \"But how does the evolutionist explain the eye, when he leaves  God out? Here is the only guess that I have seen,--if you find any  others, I shall be glad to know of them, as I am collecting the  guesses of the evolutionists.  The evolutionist guesses that there was  a time when eyes were unknown--that is a necessary part of the  hypothesis.  And since the eye is a universal possession, among living  things, the evolutionist guesses that it came into being,--not by  design or act of God--I will give you the guess,--a piece of pigment,  or as some say, a freckle, appeared upon the skin of an animal that  had no eyes. This piece of pigment or freckle converged the rays of  the sun upon that spot, and when the little animal felt the heat on  that spot, it turned the spot to the sun to get more heat. This  increased heat irritated the skin,--so the evolutionists guess--and a  nerve came there and out of the nerve came the eye. Can you beat it?  But this only accounts for one eye; there must have been another piece  of pigment or freckle soon afterward, and just in the right place in  order to give the animal two eyes.\"    Now assuming, what seems an utter impossibility, that the wonderful  mechanism of the eye can be accounted for by chance or natural  selection (another name for chance since design is excluded), how can  we account for the _location_ of the eyes, and, in fact, of all  the other organs of the body? We can easily calculate the mathematical  probability on the basis of natural selection. There are from 2500 to  3500 square inches of surface to the human body, a space easily 3000  times the space occupied by an eye.  The eye, by the laws of  probability, is just as likely to be located any where else, and has  one chance out of 3000 to be located where it is. But out, of our  abundant margin, we will concede the chance to be one out of 1000, and  hence its mathematical probability is .001. For mathematical  probability includes possibility and even improbability.  The compound  probability of two things happening together is ascertained by  multiplying together their fractions of probability. Now the  probability of the location of the second eye where it is, also is  .001. And the compound probability of the location of both eyes where  they are, is .001 x .001 or .000,001. In like manner, the probability  of the location of each ear where it is, is .001, and of the two ears  .000,001. The compound probability of the location of two eyes and two  ears where they are, is .000001 x .000001 or .000,000,000,001. The two  eyes and two ears have but one chance out of a trillion or a million  million to be located where they are. The location of the mouth, the  nose, and every organ of the body diminishes this probability a  thousand fold. We are speaking mildly when we say that this  calculation proves that the evolution of the body, by chance or  natural selection, has not one chance in a million to be true. So  ruthlessly does the pure and reliable science of mathematics shatter  the theory of evolution, which so called scientists claim is as firmly  established as the law of gravitation.    Concerning the wild guess of the development of the legs, we again  quote from Mr. Bryan, \"In His Image,\" p. 98: \"And according to the  evolutionist, there was a time when animals had no legs, and so the  legs came by accident. How? Well, the guess is that a little animal  was wiggling along on its belly one day, when it discovered a wart--it  just happened so,--and it was in the right place to be used to aid it  in locomotion; so, it came to depend upon the wart, and use finally  developed it into a leg. And then another wart, and another leg, at  the proper time--by accident--and accidentally in the proper place. Is  it not astonishing that any person, intelligent enough to teach  school, would talk such tommyrot to students, and look serious while  doing so?\"    Some one has counted that Darwin has used phrases of doubt, like \"We  may well suppose,\" 800 times in his two principal works. The whole  theory is built up on guesses and suppositions. \"Let us suppose\" that  each guess is 95 per cent certain, which is far higher than the  average or any. The compound probability would equal .95 raised to the  800th power which would be .000,000,000,000,000,006,281 which means  there are 6 chances out of a quintillion that evolution is true. Since  not all of these 800 suppositions are dependent upon each other, we  are willing to multiply this result by 10,000,000,000 which still  shows that the theory has less than one chance in a million to be  true. Darwin himself says, \"The belief that an organ so perfect as the  eye could have been formed by natural selection, is more than enough  to STAGGER ANY ONE.\" Yet he and his followers refuse to be  \"staggered,\" and proceed to argue as if this unanswerable objection  had little or no weight. _Any hypothesis is weakened or damaged by  every support that is an uncertain guess_. Gravitation has no such  support.    Mr. Alfred W. McCann, in his great volume \"God or Gorilla,\" shows that  H. G. Wells, the novelist _alias_ historian(?), in his \"Outline  of History,\" uses 103 pages to show man's descent from an ape-like  ancestry, and employs 96 expressions of doubt or uncertainty, such as  \"probably,\" \"perhaps,\" \"possibly,\" etc. He does not hesitate to  endorse the wildest guesses of the evolutionists, and sits upon the  top of this pyramid of doubt, and proclaims, _ex cathedra_,  apparently without a blush, of our ancestors: \"It was half-ape,  half-monkey [elsewhere, he says the lemur was our ancestor]. It  clambered about the trees and ran, and probably ran well, on its hind  legs upon the ground. It was small brained by our present standards,  but it had clever hands with which it handled fruit and beat nuts upon  the rocks, and perhaps caught up sticks and stones to smite its  fellows. IT WAS OUR ANCESTOR.\"!!!    And he does not hesitate to give a picture of our ancestor drawn by an  artist 500,000 years after its death.  Yet this book so dangerous, so  anti-christian, and so untruthful concerning the origin of man, is  recommended by careless librarians, by scholars, and even by  Christians.  It will take a long time to erase from the mind of the  youth, the false teachings of this book. It is one of the most  cunningly devised plans ever attempted to teach infidelity and atheism  in the name of history.    PLANS FOR MAN PROVE DESIGN. All nature is crowded with evidence  that God intended to create man. He made great preparation for his  coming. He provided many things useful to man but to no other  species. Veins of coal, almost innumerable--the canned sunshine of  past ages--, are placed near the earth's surface, accessible for man,  when needed for his use. Of no value whatever to any other species,  because they can not make or replenish a fire. A colored preacher did  not miss the mark, when he said, \"God stored his coal in his great big  cellar for the use of man.\" The man who fills his own cellar with  provisions for the winter exhibits no more foresight or design.    The oil and gas were also evidently stored away in the earth for the  use of man. It is worth nothing to animals. Over 41,000,000,000  gallons of oil were consumed in the U.S. in 1924.    All the other minerals likewise were stored in the earth for the use  of man alone,--iron, copper, gold, silver, all the valuable  minerals,--knowing that man would make use of them. The most precious  and most useful minerals are of no value whatever to any species of  animals. God foresaw the marvelous inventions of the present and the  future, and provided the means ages ahead of time. The universe is  crowded so full of design, that there is no room for chance or natural  selection.        15. EVOLUTION ATHEISTIC      Evolution harmonizes with atheism and kindred false theories. This  raises a presumption against its truth, as falsehood does not agree  with the truth. It is reconcilable with infidelity and atheism, but  not with Christianity.  Many, like Prof. Coulter, of the Chicago  University, endeavor to show that evolution is reconcilable with  _religion_--and he does show that it harmonizes with the religion  of deism or infidelity. No one doubts that evolution harmonizes with  atheism or the religion of Thomas Paine.  But why should we be anxious  to reconcile it with Christianity, when there is so little truth to  support it?    Many evolutionists are atheists. Some believe in the eternity of  matter. This can not be. Both mind and matter can not be eternal. Mind  controls matter; and not matter, mind. Hence the mind of God created  matter.    Some believe the universe came into being by its own power, though  that can not be. Power or force cannot create itself. It must be  attached directly or indirectly to a person. No force can be  disconnected from its cause. Detached force is unthinkable. All force  in the universe can be traced to God."]]]
