Is it possible that in Lineland  proximity is not necessary for marriage and for the generation of  children?\"    \"How can you ask so absurd a question?\" replied the Monarch.  \"If it  were indeed as you suggest, the Universe would soon be depopulated.  No, no; neighbourhood is needless for the union of hearts; and the  birth of children is too important a matter to have been allowed to  depend upon such an accident as proximity.  You cannot be ignorant of  this.  Yet since you are pleased to affect ignorance, I will instruct  you as if you were the veriest baby in Lineland.  Know, then, that  marriages are consummated by means of the faculty of sound and the  sense of hearing.    \"You are of course aware that every Man has two mouths or voices--as  well as two eyes--a bass at one and a tenor at the other of his  extremities.  I should not mention this, but that I have been unable to  distinguish your tenor in the course of our conversation.\" I replied  that I had but one voice, and that I had not been aware that his Royal  Highness had two.  \"That confirms my impression,\" said the King, \"that  you are not a Man, but a feminine Monstrosity with a bass voice, and an  utterly uneducated ear.  But to continue.    \"Nature having herself ordained that every Man should wed two wives--\"  \"Why two?\" asked I.  \"You carry your affected simplicity too far,\" he  cried.  \"How can there be a completely harmonious union without the  combination of the Four in One, viz. the Bass and Tenor of the Man and  the Soprano and Contralto of the two Women?\"  \"But supposing,\" said I,  \"that a man should prefer one wife or three?\"  \"It is impossible,\" he  said; \"it is as inconceivable as that two and one should make five, or  that the human eye should see a Straight Line.\"  I would have  interrupted him; but he proceeded as follows:    \"Once in the middle of each week a Law of Nature compels us to move to  and fro with a rhythmic motion of more than usual violence, which  continues for the time you would take to count a hundred and one.  In  the midst of this choral dance, at the fifty-first pulsation, the  inhabitants of the Universe pause in full career, and each individual  sends forth his richest, fullest, sweetest strain.  It is in this  decisive moment that all our marriages are made.  So exquisite is the  adaptation of Bass and Treble, of Tenor to Contralto, that oftentimes  the Loved Ones, though twenty thousand leagues away, recognize at once  the responsive note of their destined Lover; and, penetrating the  paltry obstacles of distance, Love unites the three.  The marriage in  that instance consummated results in a threefold Male and Female  offspring which takes its place in Lineland.\"    \"What!  Always threefold?\" said I.  \"Must one wife then always have  twins?\"    \"Bass-voice Monstrosity! yes,\" replied the King.  \"How else could the  balance of the Sexes be maintained, if two girls were not born for  every boy?  Would you ignore the very Alphabet of Nature?\" He ceased,  speechless for fury; and some time elapsed before I could induce him to  resume his narrative.    \"You will not, of course, suppose that every bachelor among us finds  his mates at the first wooing in this universal Marriage Chorus.  On  the contrary, the process is by most of us many times repeated.  Few  are the hearts whose happy lot is at once to recognize in each other's  voice the partner intended for them by Providence, and to fly into a  reciprocal and perfectly harmonious embrace.  With most of us the  courtship is of long duration.  The Wooer's voices may perhaps accord  with one of the future wives, but not with both; or not, at first, with  either; or the Soprano and Contralto may not quite harmonize.  In such  cases Nature has provided that every weekly Chorus shall bring the  three Lovers into closer harmony.  Each trial of voice, each fresh  discovery of discord, almost imperceptibly induces the less perfect to  modify his or her vocal utterance so as to approximate to the more  perfect.  And after many trials and many approximations, the result is  at last achieved.  There comes a day at last when, while the wonted  Marriage Chorus goes forth from universal Lineland, the three far-off  Lovers suddenly find themselves in exact harmony, and, before they are  aware, the wedded Triplet is rapt vocally into a duplicate embrace; and  Nature rejoices over one more marriage and over three more births.\"          SECTION 14  How I vainly tried to explain the nature of Flatland      Thinking that it was time to bring down the Monarch from his raptures  to the level of common sense, I determined to endeavour to open up to  him some glimpses of the truth, that is to say of the nature of things  in Flatland.  So I began thus:  \"How does your Royal Highness  distinguish the shapes and positions of his subjects?  I for my part  noticed by the sense of sight, before I entered your Kingdom, that some  of your people are lines and others Points; and that some of the lines  are larger--\"  \"You speak of an impossibility,\" interrupted the King;  \"you must have seen a vision; for to detect the difference between a  Line and a Point by the sense of sight is, as every one knows, in the  nature of things, impossible; but it can be detected by the sense of  hearing, and by the same means my shape can be exactly ascertained.  Behold me--I am a Line, the longest in Lineland, over six inches of  Space--\" \"Of Length,\" I ventured to suggest.  \"Fool,\" said he, \"Space  is Length.  Interrupt me again, and I have done.\"    I apologized; but he continued scornfully, \"Since you are impervious to  argument, you shall hear with your ears how by means of my two voices I  reveal my shape to my Wives, who are at this moment six thousand miles  seventy yards two feet eight inches away, the one to the North, the  other to the South.  Listen, I call to them.\"    He chirruped, and then complacently continued:  \"My wives at this  moment receiving the sound of one of my voice, closely followed by the  other, and perceiving that the latter reaches them after an interval in  which sound can traverse 6.457 inches, infer that one of my mouths is  6.457 inches further from them than the other, and accordingly know my  shape to be 6.457 inches.  But you will of course understand that my  wives do not make this calculation every time they hear my two voices.  They made it, once for all, before we were married.  But they COULD  make it at any time.  And in the same way I can estimate the shape of  any of my Male subjects by the sense of sound.\"    \"But how,\" said I, \"if a Man feigns a Woman's voice with one of his two  voices, or so disguises his Southern voice that it cannot be recognized  as the echo of the Northern?  May not such deceptions cause great  inconvenience?  And have you no means of checking frauds of this kind  by commanding your neighbouring subjects to feel one another?\" This of  course was a very stupid question, for feeling could not have answered  the purpose; but I asked with the view of irritating the Monarch, and I  succeeded perfectly.    \"What!\" cried he in horror, \"explain your meaning.\"  \"Feel, touch, come  into contact,\" I replied.  \"If you mean by FEELING,\" said the King,  \"approaching so close as to leave no space between two individuals,  know, Stranger, that this offence is punishable in my dominions by  death.  And the reason is obvious.  The frail form of a Woman, being  liable to be shattered by such an approximation, must be preserved by  the State; but since Women cannot be distinguished by the sense of  sight from Men, the Law ordains universally that neither Man nor Woman  shall be approached so closely as to destroy the interval between the  approximator and the approximated.    \"And indeed what possible purpose would be served by this illegal and  unnatural excess of approximation which you call TOUCHING, when all the  ends of so brutal and course a process are attained at once more easily  and more exactly by the sense of hearing?  As to your suggested danger  of deception, it is non-existent: for the Voice, being the essence of  one's Being, cannot be thus changed at will.  But come, suppose that I  had the power of passing through solid things, so that I could  penetrate my subjects, one after another, even to the number of a  billion, verifying the size and distance of each by the sense of  FEELING:  How much time and energy would be wasted in this clumsy and  inaccurate method!  Whereas now, in one moment of audition, I take as  it were the census and statistics, local, corporeal, mental and  spiritual, of every living being in Lineland.  Hark, only hark!\"    So saying he paused and listened, as if in an ecstasy, to a sound which  seemed to me no better than a tiny chirping from an innumerable  multitude of lilliputian grasshoppers.    \"Truly,\" replied I, \"your sense of hearing serves you in good stead,  and fills up many of your deficiencies.  But permit me to point out  that your life in Lineland must be deplorably dull.  To see nothing but  a Point!  Not even to be able to contemplate a Straight Line!  Nay, not  even to know what a Straight Line is!  To see, yet to be cut off from  those Linear prospects which are vouchsafed to us in Flatland!

Are ye tryin' to torment me, or do ye  really care for McTee?\"    She tried with all her might, but could not answer. The rumble and ring  of his voice brought her heart to her throat.    \"You're tremblin',\" said Harrigan, and he released her. \"So it's all  true. McTee!\"    He turned on his heel like a soldier, lest she should mark the change  of his expression; but she must have noticed something, for she called:  \"Harrigan--Dan!\"    He stopped, but would not face her.    \"You have your hands clenched. Are you going out to hunt for McTee in  that black mood?\"    \"Kate,\" said Harrigan, \"by my honor I'm swearin' he's as safe in my  hands as a child.\"          CHAPTER 13      Harrigan strode off through the trees. To loosen the tight, aching  muscles of his throat he began to sing--old Irish songs with a wail and  a swing to them. He had taken no certain direction, for he only wished  to be alone and far away from the other two; but after a time he  realized that he was on the side of the central hill to which McTee had  gone to look for the dry wood. Above all things in the world he wished  to avoid the Scotchman now, and as soon as he became conscious of his  whereabouts, he veered sharply to the right. He had scarcely walked a  minute in the new direction before he met McTee. The latter had seen  him first, and now stood with braced feet in his position of battle,  rolling the sleeves of his shirt away from his forearms. Harrigan  stepped behind a tree.    \"Come out,\" roared McTee. \"I've seen you. Don't try to sneak behind and  take me from the back.\"    With an exceeding bitterness of heart, Harrigan stepped into view  again.    \"You look sick,\" went on McTee. \"If you knew what would happen when we  met, why did you come? If you fear me, go back and hug the skirts of  the girl. She'll take pity on you, Harrigan.\"    The Irishman groaned. \"Think your thoughts an' say your say, McTee. I  can't lay a hand on you today.\"    The latter stepped close, stupefied with wonder.    \"Do I hear you right? Are you taking water, Harrigan?\"    Harrigan bowed his head, praying mutely for strength to endure.    \"Don't say it!\" pleaded McTee. \"I've hunted the world and worn the  roads bare looking for one man who could stand up to me--and now that  I've found him, he turns yellow inside!\"    And he looked upon the Irishman with a sick horror, as if the big  fellow were turning into a reptile before his eyes. On the face of  Harrigan there was an expression like that of the starving man whom the  fear of poison induces to push away food.    \"There's no word I can speak to you, McTee. You could never understand.  Go back to the girl. Maybe she'll explain.\"    \"The girl?\"    At the wild hope in that voice Harrigan shuddered, and he could not  look up.    \"Harrigan, what do you mean?\"    \"Don't ask me. Leave me alone, McTee.\"    \"Here's a mystery,\" said the Scotchman, \"and our little party is  postponed. The date is changed, that's all. Remember!\"    He stepped off through the trees in the direction of the shelter on the  beach, leaving Harrigan to throw himself upon the ground in a paroxysm  of shame and hate.    But McTee, with hope to spur him on--a vague hope; a thought half  formed and therefore doubly delightful--went with great strides until  he came to Kate where she sat tending the fire. He broke at once into  the heart of his question.    \"I met Harrigan. He's changed. Something has happened. Tell me what it  is. He says you know.\"    He crouched close to her, intent and eager, his eyes ready to read a  thousand meanings into the very lowering of her lashes; but she let her  glance rove past him.    \"Well?\" he asked impatiently.    \"It is hard to speak of it.\"    Cold doubt fell upon the captain; he moistened his lips before he  spoke.    \"Hit straight from the shoulder. There's something between you and the  Irishman?\"    She dropped a hand over his mighty fist.    \"After all, you are our only friend, Angus. Why shouldn't you know?\"    He stood up and made a few paces to and fro, his hands locked behind  him and his leonine head fallen low.    \"Yes, why shouldn't you tell me! I think I understand already.\"    All desire to laugh went from her, and deep fear took its place; her  eyes were held fascinated upon his interlaced fingers, white under  their own terrific pressure; yet she understood that she must go on. If  she failed, this mighty force would be turned against Harrigan; and  Harrigan, not less grim in battle, as she could guess, would be turned  against him.    She said quickly, to conceal her fear: \"I thought there was some  trouble between you and Dan. I asked him to promise that he would not  fight with you. But I don't need to ask you to promise not to fight  with him, for now that you know--\"    He leaped up and beat his hands together over his head.    \"And that was why! I taunted him and all the time he was laughing to  himself!\"    He stopped and then whispered to himself: \"Still, it's only postponed.  The tune will come! The time will come!\"    She understood the promise.    \"Angus! What are you saying?\"    He said quietly: \"Harrigan's safe from me while you care for him. Do  you think I'm fool enough to make a martyr of him? Not I! But when we  get back to the world--\"    He finished the sentence by slowly flexing his fingers.    \"I love you, Kate, and until the strength goes out of my hands, I'll  still love you. I want you; and what I want I get. You'll hate me for  it, eh?\"    He went off without waiting for an answer, stumbling as he walked like  one who was dazed. Her strength held with her until he was out of sight  among the trees, but then she sank to the ground, panting. Sooner or  later they were sure to discover her ruse, and the moment one of them  learned that she did not love the other, they would rush into battle.  She only prayed that the discovery would not come till they were safely  off the island. Once back in the world the strong arm of the law might  suffice to keep them apart.    The falling of the fire roused her at last and she set about gathering  wood to keep it alive. It was the Irishman who returned first. He waved  her to the shade of the shelter and finished collecting the wood.          CHAPTER 14      Afterward he inquired, frowning: \"Where's McTee? I met him an' he  started back to find you.\"    \"He's gone off with his thoughts, Dan.\"    Harrigan sighed, looking up to the stainless blue of the sky: \"Aye,  that's the way of the Scotch. When they're happy in love, they go off  by themselves an' brood like a dog that's thinking of a fight. But were  I he, I'd never be leavin' your side, colleen.\"    His head tilted back in the way she had come to know, and she waited  for the soft dialect: \"I'd be singin' songs av love an' war-r-r, an'  braggin' me hear-rt out, an' talkin' av the sea-green av your eyes,  colleen. Look at him now!\"    For the great form of McTee left the circle of the trees and approached  them.    \"He's got his head down between his shoulders like a whipped cur. He's  broodin', an' his soul is thick in a fog.\"    \"Dan, I trust you to cheer him up; but you'll not speak of me?\"    \"Not I. He's a proud man, Black McTee, an' he'd be angered to the core  of him if he thought you'd talked about him an' his love to Harrigan.  Whisht, Kate, I'll handle him like fire!    \"The wood,\" he began, as McTee came in. \"Did you find it on top of the  hill, lad?\"    McTee rumbled after a pause, and without looking at Harrigan: \"There's  plenty of it there. I made a little heap of the driest on the crown of  the hill.\"    \"Then the next thing is to move our fire up there.\"    \"Move our fire?\" cried Kate. \"How can you carry the fire?\"    \"Easy. Take two pieces of burnin' wood an' walk along holdin' them  close together. That way they burn each other an' the flame keeps  goin'. Watch!\"    He selected two good-sized brands from the fire and raised them,  holding one in either hand and keeping the ignited portions of the  sticks together. McTee looked from Kate to Harrigan.    \"Sit down and talk to Kate. I'll carry the sticks; I know where the  pile of timber is.\"    Harrigan made a significant and covert nod and winked at McTee with  infinite understanding.    \"Stay here yourself, lad. I wouldn't be robbing you----\"    Kate coughed for warning, and he broke off sharply.    \"You've made one trip to the hill. This is my turn. Besides, you  wouldn't know how to keep the stick burnin'. I've done it before.\"    McTee stared, agape with astonishment. The meaning of that wink still  puzzled his brain. He turned to Kate for explanation, and she beckoned  him to stay. When Harrigan disappeared, he said: \"What's the meaning?  Doesn't Harrigan want to be with you?\"    She allowed her eyes to wander dreamily after Harrigan.    \"Don't you see? He's like a big boy. He's overflowing with happiness  and he has to go off to play by himself.\"    McTee watched her with deep suspicion.    \"It's queer,\" he pondered. \"I know the Irish like a book, and when  they're in love, they're always singing and shouting and raising the  devil. It looked to me as if Harrigan was making himself be cheerful.\"    He went on: \"I'll take him aside and tell him that I understand.  Otherwise he'll think he's fooling me.\"    \"Please! You won't do that? Angus, you know how proud he is! He will be  furious if he finds out that I've spoken to you about--about--our love.  Won't you wait until he tells you of his own accord?\"    He ground his teeth in an ugly fury.    \"You understand? If I find you've been playing with me, it'll mean  death for Harrigan, and worse than that for you?\"    She made her glance sad and gentle.    \"Will you never trust me, Angus?\"    He answered, with a sort of wonder at himself: \"Since I was a child,  you are the first person in the world who has had the right to call me  by my first name.\"    \"Not a single woman?\" and she shivered.    \"No"]]]
