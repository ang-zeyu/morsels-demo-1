He often appeals to the practice and traditions of the English  Parliament, and there are few Continental statesmen who would have been  so completely at home in the English House of Commons; he belonged to  the class of men from whom so many of the great English statesmen had  come and whom he himself describes:      \"What with us is lacking is the whole class which in England    carries on politics, the class of gentlemen who are well-to-do    and therefore Conservative, who are independent of material    interests and whose whole education is directed towards making    them English statesmen, and the object of whose life is to take    part in the Commonwealth of England.\"    They were the class to whom he belonged, and he would gladly have taken  part in a Parliamentary government of this kind.    The weakness of his position arose from the fact that he was really  acquainted with and represented the inhabitants of only one-half of the  monarchy. So long as he is dealing with questions of landed property, or  of the condition of the peasants, he has a minute and thorough  knowledge. He did not always, however, avoid the danger of speaking as  though Prussia consisted entirely of agriculturists. The great  difficulty then as now of governing the State, was that it consisted of  two parts: the older provinces, almost entirely agricultural, where the  land was held chiefly by the great nobles, and the new provinces, the  Rhine and Westphalia, where there was a large and growing industrial  population. To the inhabitants of these provinces Bismarck's constant  appeal to the old Prussian traditions and to the achievements of the  Prussian nobility could have little meaning. What did the citizens of  Cologne and Aachen care about the Seven Years' War? If their ancestors  took part in the war, it would be as enemies of the Kings of Prussia.  When Bismarck said that they were Prussians, and would remain Prussian,  he undoubtedly spoke the opinion of the Mark and of Pomerania. But the  inhabitants of the Western Provinces still felt and thought rather as  Germans than as Prussians; they had scarcely been united with the  monarchy thirty years; they were not disloyal, but they were quite  prepared--nay, they wished to see Prussia dissolved in Germany. No one  can govern Prussia unless he is able to reconcile to his policy these  two different classes in the State. It was this which the Prussian  Conservatives, to which Bismarck at that time belonged, have always  failed to do. The Liberals whom he opposed failed equally. In later  years he was very nearly to succeed in a task which might appear almost  impossible.    [Illustration]          CHAPTER IV.    THE GERMAN PROBLEM.    1849-1852.      Bismarck, however, did not confine himself to questions of  constitutional reform and internal government. He often spoke on the  foreign policy of the Government, and it is in these speeches that he  shews most originality.    The Revolution in Germany, as in Italy, had two sides; it was Liberal,  but it was also National. The National element was the stronger and more  deep-seated. The Germans felt deeply the humiliation to which they were  exposed owing to the fact that they did not enjoy the protection of a  powerful Government; they wished to belong to a national State, as  Frenchmen, Englishmen, and Russians did. It was the general hope that  the period of revolution might be used for establishing a government to  which the whole of Germany would pay obedience. This was the task of the  Constituent Assembly, which since the spring of 1848 had with the  permission of the Governments been sitting at Frankfort. Would they be  able to succeed where the diplomatists of Vienna had failed? They had  at least good-will, but it was to be shewn that something more than  honest endeavour was necessary. There were three great difficulties with  which they had to contend. The first was the Republican party, the men  who would accept no government but a Republic, and who wished to found  the new state by insurrection. They were a small minority of the German  people; several attempts at insurrection organised by them were  suppressed, and they were outvoted in the Assembly. The second  difficulty was Austria. A considerable portion of Germany was included  in the Austrian Empire. If the whole of Germany were to be included in  the new State which they hoped to found, then part of the Austrian  Empire would have to be separated from the rest, subjected to different  laws and a different government; nothing would remain but a personal  union between the German and Slavonic provinces. The Government of  Austria, after it had recovered its authority at the end of 1848,  refused to accept this position, and published a new Constitution,  binding all the provinces together in a closer union. The Assembly at  Frankfort had no power to coerce the Emperor of Austria; they therefore  adopted the other solution, viz.: that the rest of Germany was to be  reconstituted, and the Austrian provinces left out. The question,  however, then arose: Would Austria accept this--would she allow a new  Germany to be created in which she had no part? Surely not, if she was  able to prevent it. The third difficulty was the relation between the  individual States and the new central authority. It is obvious that  whatever powers were given to the new Government would be taken away  from the Princes of the individual States, who hitherto had enjoyed  complete sovereignty. Those people who in Germany were much influenced  by attachment to the existing governments, and who wished to maintain  the full authority of the Princes and the local Parliaments, were called  _Particularists_. During the excitement of the Revolution they had been  almost entirely silenced. With the restoration of order and authority  they had regained their influence. It was probable that many of the  States would refuse to accept the new Constitution unless they were  compelled to do so. Where was the power to do this? There were many in  the National Assembly who wished to appeal to the power of the people,  and by insurrection and barricades compel all the Princes to accept the  new Constitution. There was only one other power in Germany which could  do the work, and that was the Prussian army. Would the King of Prussia  accept this task?    The German Constitution was completed in March, 1849. By the exercise of  much tact and great personal influence, Heinrich von Gagern, the  President of the Assembly and the leader of the Moderate party in it,  had procured a majority in favour of an hereditary monarchy, and the  King of Prussia was elected to the post of first German Emperor. At the  beginning of April there arrived in Berlin the deputation which was to  offer to him the crown, and on his answer depended the future of  Germany. Were he to accept, he would then have undertaken to put  himself at the head of the revolutionary movement; it would be his duty  to compel all the other States to accept the new Constitution, and, if  necessary, to defend it on the field of battle against Austria. Besides  this he would have to govern not only Prussia but Germany; to govern it  under a Constitution which gave almost all the power to a Parliament  elected by universal suffrage, and in which he had only a suspensive  veto. Can we be surprised that he refused the offer? He refused it on  the ground that he could not accept universal suffrage, and also because  the title and power of German Emperor could not be conferred on him by a  popular assembly; he could only accept it from his equals, the German  Princes.    The decision of the King was discussed in the Prussian Assembly, and an  address moved declaring that the Frankfort Constitution was in legal  existence, and requesting the King to accept the offer. It was on this  occasion that Bismarck for the first time came forward as the leader of  a small party on the Extreme Right. He at once rose to move the previous  question. He denied to the Assembly even the right of discussing this  matter which belonged to the prerogative of the King.    He was still more strongly opposed to the acceptance of the offered  crown. He saw only that the King of Prussia would be subjected to a  Parliamentary Assembly, that his power of action would be limited. The  motto of his speech was that Prussia must remain Prussia. \"The crown of  Frankfort,\" he said, \"may be very bright, but the gold which gives  truth to its brilliance has first to be won by melting down the  Prussian crown.\" His speech caused great indignation; ten thousand  copies of it were printed to be distributed among the electors so as to  show them the real principles and objects of the reactionary party.    His opposition to any identification of Prussia and Germany was  maintained when the Prussian Government itself took the initiative and  proposed its own solution. During the summer of 1849, the Prussian  programme was published. The Government invited the other States of  Germany to enter into a fresh union; the basis of the new Constitution  was to be that of Frankfort, but altered so far as might be found  necessary, and the union was to be a voluntary one. The King in order to  carry out this policy appointed as one of his Ministers Herr von  Radowitz. He was a man of the highest character and extreme ability. An  officer by profession, he was distinguished by the versatility of his  interests and his great learning. The King found in him a man who shared  his own enthusiasm for letters. He had been a member of the Parliament  at Frankfort, and had taken a leading part among the extreme  Conservatives; a Roman Catholic, he had come forward in defence of  religion and order against the Liberals and Republicans; a very eloquent  speaker, by his earnestness and eloquence he was able for a short time  to give new life"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12422"],[0,"Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation: 1838-1839 (#12)"],[1,"bags, to the height  of ten, twelve, and fourteen feet. This huge water-waggon floats lazily  down the river, from the upper country to Darien. They are flat bottomed,  and, of course, draw little water. The stream from whence they are named  is an up country river, which, by its junction with the Ocmulgee, forms  the Altamaha. Here at least, you perceive the Indian names remain, and  long may they do so, for they seem to me to become the very character of  the streams and mountains they indicate, and are indeed significant to the  learned in savage tongues, which is more than can be said of such titles  as Jones's Creek, Onion Creek, &c. These Ocone boxes are broken up at  Darien, where the cotton is shipped either for the Savannah, Charleston  or Liverpool markets, and the timber, of which they are constructed,  sold.    We rowed the doctor over to see some of his patients on the island, and  before his departure a most animated discussion took place upon the  subject of the President of the United States, his talents,  qualifications, opinions, above all, his views with regard to the slave  system. Mr. ----, who you know is no abolitionist, and is a very devoted  Van Buren man, maintained with great warmth the President's  straight-forwardness, and his evident and expressed intention of  protecting the rights of the South. The doctor, on the other hand, quoted  a certain speech of the President's, upon the question of abolishing  slavery in the district of Columbia, which his fears interpreted into a  mere evasion of the matter, and an indication that, at some future period,  he (Mr. Van Buren), might take a different view of the subject. I confess,  for my own part, that if the doctor quoted the speech right, and if the  President is not an honest man, and if I were a Southern slave holder, I  should not feel altogether secure of Mr. Van Buren's present opinions or  future conduct upon this subject. These three _ifs_, however, are material  points of consideration. Our friend the doctor inclined vehemently to Mr.  Clay, as one on whom the slave holders could depend. Georgia, however, as  a state, is perhaps the most democratic in the Union; though here, as well  as in other places, that you and I know of, a certain class, calling  themselves the first, and honestly believing themselves the best, set  their faces against the modern fashioned republicanism, professing, and, I  have no doubt, with great sincerity, that their ideas of democracy are  altogether of a different kind.    I went again to-day to the Infirmary, and was happy to perceive that there  really was an evident desire to conform to my instructions, and keep the  place in a better condition than formerly. Among the sick I found a poor  woman suffering dreadfully from the ear-ache. She had done nothing to  alleviate her pain but apply some leaves, of what tree or plant I could  not ascertain, and tie up her head in a variety of dirty cloths, till it  was as large as her whole body. I removed all these, and found one side of  her face and neck very much swollen, but so begrimed with filth that it  was really no very agreeable task to examine it. The first process, of  course, was washing, which, however, appeared to her so very unusual an  operation, that I had to perform it for her myself. Sweet oil and  laudanum, and raw cotton, being then applied to her ear and neck, she  professed herself much relieved, but I believe in my heart that the warm  water sponging had done her more good than anything else. I was sorry not  to ascertain what leaves she had applied to her ear. These simple remedies  resorted to by savages, and people as ignorant, are generally approved by  experience, and sometimes condescendingly adopted by science. I remember  once, when Mr. ---- was suffering from a severe attack of inflammatory  rheumatism, Doctor C---- desired him to bind round his knee the leaves of  the tulip-tree--poplar, I believe you call it--saying that he had learnt  that remedy from the negroes in Virginia, and found it a most effectual  one. My next agreeable office in the Infirmary this morning was  superintending the washing of two little babies, whose mothers were  nursing them with quite as much ignorance as zeal. Having ordered a large  tub of water, I desired Rose to undress the little creatures and give them  a warm bath; the mothers looked on in unutterable dismay, and one of them,  just as her child was going to be put into the tub, threw into it all the  clothes she had just taken off it, as she said, to break the unusual shock  of the warm water. I immediately rescued them, not but what they were  quite as much in want of washing as the baby, but it appeared, upon  enquiry, that the woman had none others to dress the child in, when it  should have taken its bath; they were immediately wrung and hung by the  fire to dry, and the poor little patients having undergone this novel  operation were taken out and given to their mothers. Anything, however,  much more helpless and inefficient than these poor ignorant creatures you  cannot conceive; they actually seemed incapable of drying or dressing  their own babies, and I had to finish their toilet myself. As it is only a  very few years since the most absurd and disgusting customs have become  exploded among ourselves, you will not, of course, wonder that these poor  people pin up the lower part of their infants, bodies, legs and all, in  red flannel as soon as they are born, and keep them in the selfsame  envelope till it literally falls off.    In the next room I found a woman lying on the floor in a fit of epilepsy,  barking most violently. She seemed to excite no particular attention or  compassion; the women said she was subject to these fits, and took little  or no notice of her, as she lay barking like some enraged animal on the  ground. Again I stood in profound ignorance, sickening with the sight of  suffering, which I knew not how to alleviate, and which seemed to excite  no commiseration, merely from the sad fact of its frequent occurrence.  Returning to the house, I passed up the 'street.' It was between eleven  o'clock and noon, and the people were taking their first meal in the day.  By the by, E----, how do you think Berkshire county farmers would relish  labouring hard all day upon _two meals_ of Indian corn or hominy? Such is  the regulation on this plantation, however, and I beg you to bear in mind  that the negroes on Mr. ----'s estate, are generally considered well off.  They go to the fields at daybreak, carrying with them their allowance of  food for the day, which towards noon, _and not till then_, they eat,  cooking it over a fire, which they kindle as best they can, where they are  working. Their second meal in the day is at night, after their labour is  over, having worked, at the _very least_, six hours without intermission  of rest or refreshment since their noon-day meal (properly so called, for  'tis meal, and nothing else). Those that I passed to-day, sitting on their  doorsteps, or on the ground round them eating, were the people employed at  the mill and threshing-floor. As these are near to the settlement, they  had time to get their food from the cook-shop. Chairs, tables, plates,  knives, forks, they had none; they sat, as I before said, on the earth or  doorsteps, and ate either out of their little cedar tubs, or an iron pot,  some few with broken iron spoons, more with pieces of wood, and all the  children with their fingers. A more complete sample of savage feeding, I  never beheld. At one of the doors I saw three young girls standing, who  might be between sixteen and seventeen years old; they had evidently done  eatings and were rudely playing and romping with each other, laughing and  shouting like wild things. I went into the house, and such another  spectacle of filthy disorder I never beheld. I then addressed the girls  most solemnly, showing them that they were wasting in idle riot the time  in which they might be rendering their abode decent, and told them that it  was a shame for any woman to live in so dirty a place, and so beastly a  condition. They said they had seen buckree (white) women's houses just as  dirty, and they could not be expected to be cleaner than white women. I  then told them that the only difference between themselves and buckree  women was, that the latter were generally better informed, and, for that  reason alone, it was more disgraceful to them to be disorderly and dirty.  They seemed to listen to me attentively, and one of them exclaimed, with  great satisfaction, that they saw I made no difference between them and  white girls, and that they never had been so treated before. I do not know  anything which strikes me as a more melancholy illustration of the  degradation of these people, than the animal nature of their recreations  in their short seasons of respite from labour. You see them, boys and  girls, from the youngest age to seventeen and eighteen, rolling, tumbling,  kicking, and wallowing in the dust, regardless alike of decency, and  incapable of any more rational amusement; or, lolling, with half-closed  eyes, like so many cats and dogs, against a wall, or upon a bank in the  sun, dozing away their short leisure hour, until called to resume their  labours in the field or the mill. After this description of the meals of  our labourers, you will, perhaps, be curious to know how it fares with our  house servants in this respect. Precisely in the same manner, as far as  regards allowance, with the exception of what is left from our table, but,  if possible, with even less comfort, in one respect, inasmuch as no time  whatever is set apart for their meals, which they snatch at any hour, and  in any way that they can--generally, however, standing, or squatting on  their hams round the kitchen fire. They have no sleeping-rooms in the  house, but when their work is over, retire, like the rest, to their  hovels,"]]]
