Job Hortop and Miles Philips  were caught by the Spaniards and sent back to Mexico. Philips escaped to  England fourteen years later. But Hortop was sent to Spain, where he  served twelve years as a galley-slave and ten as a servant before he  contrived to get aboard an English vessel.    The ten Spanish hostages were found safe and sound aboard the _Jesus_;  though, by all the rules of war, Hawkins would have been amply justified  in killing them. The English hostages were kept fast prisoners. 'If all  the miseries of this sorrowful voyage,' says Hawkins's report, 'should  be perfectly written, there should need a painful man with his pen, and  as great a time as he had that wrote the lives and deaths of martyrs.'    Thus, in complete disaster, ended that third voyage to New Spain on  which so many hopes were set. And with this disastrous end began those  twenty years of sea-dog rage which found their satisfaction against the  Great Armada.          CHAPTER VI    DRAKE'S BEGINNING      We must now turn back for a moment to 1545, the year in which the Old  World, after the discovery of the mines of Potosi, first awoke to the  illimitable riches of the New; the year in which King Henry assembled  his epoch-making fleet; the year, too, in which the British National  Anthem was, so to say, born at sea, when the parole throughout the  waiting fleet was _God save the King!_ and the answering countersign was  _Long to reign over us!_    In the same year, at Crowndale by Tavistock in Devon, was born Francis  Drake, greatest of sea-dogs and first of modern admirals. His father,  Edmund Drake, was a skipper in modest circumstances. But from time  immemorial there had been Drakes all round the countryside of Tavistock  and the family name stood high. Francis was called after his godfather,  Francis Russell, son and heir of Henry's right-hand reforming peer, Lord  Russell, progenitor of the Dukes of Bedford down to the present day.    Though fortune thus seemed to smile upon Drake's cradle, his boyhood  proved to be a very stormy one indeed. He was not yet five when the  Protestant zeal of the Lord Protector Somerset stirred the Roman  Catholics of the West Country into an insurrection that swept the  anti-Papal minority before it like flotsam before a flood. Drake's  father was a zealous Protestant, a 'hot gospeller,' much given to  preaching; and when he was cast up by the storm on what is now Drake's  Island, just off Plymouth, he was glad to take passage for Kent. His  friends at court then made him a sort of naval chaplain to the men who  took care of His Majesty's ships laid up in Gillingham Reach on the  River Medway, just below where Chatham Dockyard stands to-day. Here, in  a vessel too old for service, most of Drake's eleven brothers were born  to a life as nearly amphibious as the life of any boy could be. The tide  runs in with a rush from the sea at Sheerness, only ten miles away; and  so, among the creeks and marshes, points and bends, through tortuous  channels and hurrying waters lashed by the keen east wind of England,  Drake reveled in the kind of playground that a sea-dog's son should  have.    During the reign of Mary (1553-58) 'hot gospellers' like Drake's father  were of course turned out of the Service. And so young Francis had to be  apprenticed to 'the master of a bark, which he used to coast along the  shore, and sometimes to carry merchandise into Zeeland and France.' It  was hard work and a rough life for the little lad of ten. But Drake  stuck to it, and 'so pleased the old man by his industry that, being a  bachelor, at his death he bequeathed his bark unto him by will and  testament.' Moreover, after Elizabeth's accession, Drake's father came  into his own. He took orders in the Church of England, and in 1561, when  Francis was sixteen, became vicar of Upchurch on the Medway, the same  river on which his boys had learned to live amphibious lives.    No dreams of any Golden West had Drake as yet. To the boy in his teens  _Westward Ho!_ meant nothing more than the usual cry of London boatmen  touting for fares up-stream. But, before he went out with Sir John  Hawkins, on the 'troublesome' voyage which we have just followed, he  must have had a foretaste of something like his future raiding of the  Spanish Main; for the Channel swarmed with Protestant privateers, no  gentler, when they caught a Spaniard, than Spaniards were when they  caught them. He was twenty-two when he went out with Hawkins and would  be in his twenty-fourth year when he returned to England in the little  _Judith_ after the murderous Spanish treachery at San Juan de Ulua.    Just as the winter night was closing in, on the 20th of January, 1569,  the _Judith_ sailed into Plymouth. Drake landed. William Hawkins, John's  brother, wrote a petition to the Queen-in-Council for letters-of-marque  in reprisal for Ulua, and Drake dashed off for London with the missive  almost before the ink was dry. Now it happened that a Spanish treasure  fleet, carrying money from Italy and bound for Antwerp, had been driven  into Plymouth and neighboring ports by Huguenot privateers. This money  was urgently needed by Alva, the very capable but ruthless governor of  the Spanish Netherlands, who, having just drowned the rebellious Dutch  in blood, was now erecting a colossal statue to himself for having  'extinguished sedition, chastised rebellion, restored religion, secured  justice, and established peace.' The Spanish ambassador therefore  obtained leave to bring it overland to Dover.    But no sooner had Elizabeth signed the order of safe conduct than in  came Drake with the news of San Juan de Ulua. Elizabeth at once saw that  all the English sea-dogs would be flaming for revenge. Everyone saw that  the treasure would be safer now in England than aboard any Spanish  vessel in the Channel. So, on the ground that the gold, though payable  to Philip's representative in Antwerp, was still the property of the  Italian bankers who advanced it, Elizabeth sent orders down post-haste  to commandeer it. The enraged ambassador advised Alva to seize  everything English in the Netherlands. Elizabeth in turn seized  everything Spanish in England. Elizabeth now held the diplomatic trumps;  for existing treaties provided that there should be no reprisals without  a reasonable delay; and Alva had seized English property before giving  Elizabeth the customary time to explain.    John Hawkins entered Plymouth five days later than Drake and started for  London with four pack horses carrying all he had saved from the wreck.  By the irony of fate he travelled up to town in the rear of the long  procession that carried the commandeered Spanish gold.    The plot thickened fast; for England was now on the brink of war with  France over the secret aid Englishmen had been giving to the Huguenots  at La Rochelle. But suddenly Elizabeth was all smiles and affability for  France. And when her two great merchant fleets put out to sea, one, the  wine-fleet, bound for La Rochelle, went with only a small naval escort,  just enough to keep the pirates off; while the other, the big  wool-fleet, usually sent to Antwerp but now bound for Hamburg, went with  a strong fighting escort of regular men-of-war.    Aboard this escort went Francis Drake as a lieutenant in the Royal Navy.  Home in June, Drake ran down to Tavistock in Devon; wooed, won, and  married pretty Mary Newman, all within a month. He was back on duty in  July.    For the time being the war cloud passed away. Elizabeth's tortuous  diplomacy had succeeded, owing to dissension among her enemies. In the  following year (1570) the international situation was changed by the  Pope, who issued a bull formally deposing Elizabeth and absolving her  subjects from their allegiance to her. The French and Spanish monarchs  refused to publish this order because they did not approve of deposition  by the Pope. But, for all that, it worked against Elizabeth by making  her the official standing enemy of Rome. At the same time it worked for  her among the sea-dogs and all who thought with them. 'The case,' said  Thomas Fuller, author of _The Worthies of England_, 'the case was clear  in _sea divinitie_.' Religious zeal and commercial enterprise went hand  in hand. The case _was_ clear; and the English navy, now mobilized and  ready for war, made it much clearer still.    _Westward Ho!_ in chief command, at the age of twenty-five, with the  tiny flotilla of the _Dragon_ and the _Swan_, manned by as good a lot of  daredevil experts as any privateer could wish to see! Out and back in  1570, and again in 1571, Drake took reprisals on New Spain, made money  for all hands engaged, and gained a knowledge of the American coast that  stood him in good stead for future expeditions.           *       *       *       *       *    It was 1572 when Drake, at the age of twenty-seven, sailed out of  Plymouth on the Nombre de Dios expedition that brought him into fame.  He led a Lilliputian fleet: the _Pascha_ and the _Swan_, a hundred tons  between them, with seventy-three men, all ranks and ratings, aboard of  them. But both vessels were 'richly furnished with victuals and apparels  for a whole year, and no less heedfully provided with all manner of  ammunition, artillery [which then meant every kind of firearm as well as  cannon], artificers' stuff and tools; but especially three dainty  pinnaces made in Plymouth, taken asunder all in pieces,' and stowed  aboard to be set up as occasion served.    Without once striking sail Drake made the channel between Dominica and  Martinique in twenty-five days and arrived off a previously chosen  secret harbor on the Spanish Main towards the end of July. To his  intense surprise a column of smoke was rising from it, though there was  no settlement within a hundred miles.

I cultivate myself then for  this world, and, accordingly, work in it and for it, while cultivating  one of its members. I pursue in it, and in it alone, without  vacillation or doubt, according to fixed rules, my aim--sure of  success, since there is no foreign power that opposes my intent.           *       *       *       *       *    That our good-will, in and for and through itself, must have  consequences, we know, even in this life; for Reason cannot require  anything without a purpose. But what these consequences are--nay, how  it is possible that a mere will can effect anything--is a question to  which we cannot even imagine a solution, so long as we are entangled  with this material world, and it is the part of wisdom not to  undertake an inquiry concerning which, we know beforehand, it must be  unsuccessful.           *       *       *       *       *    This then is my whole sublime destination, my true essence. I am a  member of two systems--a purely spiritual one, in which I rule by pure  will alone; and a sensuous one, in which I work by my deed.           *       *       *       *       *    These two systems, the purely spiritual and the sensuous--which last  may consist of an immeasurable series of particular lives--exist in  me from the moment in which my active reason is developed, and pursue  their parallel courses. The latter system is only an appearance, for  me and for those who share with me the same life. The former alone  gives to the latter meaning, and purpose, and value. I _am_ immortal,  imperishable, eternal, so soon as I form the resolution to obey the  law of Reason; and do not first have to _become_ so. The supersensuous  world is not a future world; it is present. It never can be more  present at any one point of finite existence than at any other point.  After an existence of myriad lives, it cannot be more present than at  this moment. Other conditions of my sensuous existence are to come;  but these are no more the true life than the present condition. By  means of that resolution I lay hold on eternity, and strip off this  life in the dust and all other sensuous lives that may await me, and  raise myself far above them. I become to myself the sole fountain  of all my being and of all my phenomena; and have henceforth,  unconditioned by aught without me, life in myself. My will, which  I myself, and no stranger, fit to the order of that world, is this  fountain of true life and of eternity.    But only my will is this fountain; and only when I acknowledge this  will to be the true seat of moral excellence, and actually elevate it  to this excellence, do I attain to the certainty and the possession of  that supersensuous world.           *       *       *       *       *    The sense by which we lay hold on eternal life we acquire only by  renouncing and offering up sense, and the aims of sense, to the law  which claims our will alone, and not our acts--by renouncing it with  the conviction that to do so is reasonable and alone reasonable. With  this renunciation of the earthly, the belief in the eternal first  enters our soul and stands isolated there, as the only stay by which  we can still sustain ourselves when we have relinquished everything  else, as the only animating principle that still uplifts our hearts  and still inspires our life. Well was it said, in the metaphors of  a sacred doctrine, that man must first die to the world and be born  again, in order to enter into the kingdom of God.    I see, oh, I see now, clear before mine eyes, the cause of my former  heedlessness and blindness concerning spiritual things! Filled with  earthly aims, and lost in them with all my scheming and striving; put  in motion and impelled only by the idea of a result, which is to be  actualized without us, by the desire of such a result and pleasure in  it--insensible and dead to the pure impulse of that Reason which gives  the law to itself, which sets before us a purely spiritual aim, the  immortal Psyche remains chained to the earth; her wings are bound. Our  philosophy becomes the history of our own heart and life. As we find  ourselves, so we imagine man in general and his destination. Never  impelled by any other motive than the desire of that which can be  realized in this world, there is no true liberty for us, no liberty  which has the reason for its destination absolutely and entirely in  itself. Our liberty, at the utmost, is that of the self-forming  plant, no higher in its essence, only more curious in its result, not  producing a form of matter with roots, leaves and blossoms, but a form  of mind with impulses, thoughts, actions. Of the true liberty we  are positively unable to comprehend anything, because we are not in  possession of it. Whenever we hear it spoken of, we draw the words  down to our own meaning, or briefly dismiss it with a sneer, as  nonsense. With the knowledge of liberty, the sense of another world  is also lost to us. Everything of this sort floats by like words which  are not addressed to us; like an ash-gray shadow without color or  meaning, which we cannot by any end take hold of and retain. Without  the least interest, we let everything go as it is stated. Or if ever  a robuster zeal impels us to consider it seriously, we see clearly and  can demonstrate that all those ideas are untenable, hollow visions,  which a man of sense casts from him. And, according to the premises  from which we set out and which are taken from our own innermost  experience, we are quite right, and are alike unanswerable and  unteachable, so long as we remain what we are. The excellent doctrines  which are current among the people, fortified with special authority,  concerning freedom, duty and eternal life, change themselves for us  into grotesque fables, like those of Tartarus and the Elysian fields,  although we do not disclose the true opinion of our hearts, because we  think it more advisable to keep the people in outward decency by means  of these images. Or if we are less reflective, and ourselves fettered  by the bands of authority, then we sink, ourselves, to the true  plebeian level, by believing that which, so understood, would be  foolish fable; and by finding, in those purely spiritual indications,  nothing but the promise of a continuance, to all eternity, of the same  miserable existence which we lead here below.    To say all in a word: Only through a radical reformation of my will  does a new light arise upon my being and destination. Without this,  however much I may reflect, and however distinguished my mental  endowments, there is nothing but darkness in me and around me. The  reformation of the heart alone conducts to true wisdom. So then, let  my whole life be directed unrestrainedly toward this one end!          IV    My lawful will, simply as such, in and through itself, must  have consequences, certain and without exception. Every dutiful  determination of my will, although no act should flow from it, must  operate in another, to me incomprehensible, world; and, except this  dutiful determination of the will, nothing can take effect in that  world. What do I suppose when I suppose this? What do I take for  granted?    Evidently, a law, a rule absolutely and without exception valid,  according to which the dutiful will must have consequences. Just as in  the earthly world which environs me, I assume a law according to which  this ball, when impelled by my hand with this given force, in this  given direction, must necessarily move in such a direction, with a  determinate measure of rapidity, perhaps impel another ball with  this given degree of force by which the other ball moves on with a  determinate rapidity; and so on indefinitely. As in this case, with  the mere direction and movement of my hand, I know and comprehend all  the directions and movements which shall follow it, as certainly as if  they were already present and perceived by me; even so I comprise, in  my dutiful will, a series of necessary and infallible consequences  in the spiritual world, as if they were already present, only that I  cannot, as in the material world, determine them--i.e., I merely know  that they shall be, not how they shall be. I suppose a law of the  spiritual world, in which my mere will is one of the moving forces,  just as my hand is one of the moving forces in the material world.  That firmness of my confidence and the thought of this law of a  spiritual world are one and the same thing--not two thoughts of which  one is the consequence of the other, but precisely the same thought,  just as the certainty with which I count upon a certain motion, and  the thought of a mechanical law of Nature, are the same. The idea  of _Law_ expresses generally nothing else but the fixed, immovable  reliance of Reason on a proposition, and the impossibility of  supposing the contrary.    I assume such a law of a spiritual world, which my own will did not  enact, nor the will of any finite being, nor the will of all finite  beings together, but to which my will and the will of all finite  beings is subject.           *       *       *       *       *    Agreeably to what has now been advanced, the law of the supersensuous  world should be a _Will_.    A Will which acts purely and simply as will, by its own agency,  entirely without any instrument or sensuous medium of its efficacy;  which is absolutely, in itself, at once action and result; which  wills and it is done, which commands and it stands fast; in  which, accordingly, the demand of Reason to be absolutely free and  self-active is represented. A Will which is law in itself; which  determines itself, not according to humor and caprice, not after  previous deliberation, vacillation and doubt, but which is forever "]]]
