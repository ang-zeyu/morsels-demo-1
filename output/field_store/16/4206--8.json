There is more definiteness of impression and readiness of recall for  auditory than for articulatory motor sense feelings.    4. After the acquirement of speech by the child, auditory feelings are  still necessary for articulate speech processes; for if it were not so, how  could we explain the fact that a child up to the fifth or sixth year in  full possession of speech will become dumb if it loses the sense of hearing  from middle-ear disease, unless it be educated later by lip language.    5. Cases have been recorded of bilateral lesion of the auditory centre of  the brain producing loss of hearing and loss of speech, the motor centres  being unaffected. This is called Wernicke's sensory aphasia. The following  case occurring in my own practice is probably the most complete instance  recorded.          CASE OF DEAFNESS ARISING FROM DESTRUCTION OF THE AUDITORY CENTRES IN THE  BRAIN CAUSING LOSS OF SPEECH      A woman at the age of twenty suddenly became unconscious and remained so  for three hours; on recovery of consciousness it was found she could not  speak; this condition remained for a fortnight; speech gradually returned,  although it was impaired for a month or more. She married, but soon after  marriage she suddenly lost her hearing completely, remaining permanently  stone deaf; and although she could understand anything of a simple  character when written, and was able imperfectly to copy sentences, she was  unable to speak. Once, however, under great emotional excitement, while I  was examining her by written questions, she uttered, \"Is that.\" But she was  never heard to speak again during the subsequent five years that she lived.  The utterance of those two words, however, showed that the loss of speech  was not due to a defect of the physiological mechanism of the vocal  instrument of speech, nor to the motor centres in the brain that preside  over its movements in the production of articulate speech. She recognised  pictures and expressed satisfaction or dissatisfaction when correct or  incorrect names were written beneath the pictures; moreover, in many ways,  by gestures, facial expression, and curious noises of a high-pitched,  musical, whining character, showed that she was not markedly deficient in  intelligence. Although in an asylum and partially paralysed, she was not  really insane in the proper sense, but incapable of taking care of herself.  When other patients were getting into mischief this patient would give a  warning to the attendants by the utterance of inarticulate sounds, showing  that she was able to comprehend what was taking place around and reason  thereon, indicating thereby that although stone deaf and dumb, it was  probable that she possessed the power of silent thought. I observed that  during emotional excitement the pitch of the sounds she uttered increased  markedly with the increase of excitement. After having been discharged from  Claybury Asylum she was sent to Colney Hatch Asylum. Upon one of my visits  to that institution I learnt that she had been admitted, and upon my  entering the ward, although more than a year had elapsed since I last saw  her, she immediately and from afar recognised me; and by facial expression,  gesture, and the utterance of inarticulate sounds showed her great pleasure  and satisfaction in seeing one who had taken a great interest in her case.  This poor woman must have felt some satisfaction in knowing that someone  had interpreted her mental condition, for of course, her husband and  friends did not understand why she could not speak. I may mention that the  first attack of loss of speech was attributed to hysteria.    This woman died of tuberculosis seven years after the second attack, and  examination of the brain _post-mortem_ revealed the cause of the deafness.  There was destruction of the centre of hearing in both hemispheres (_vide_  fig. 17), caused by blocking of an artery supplying in each hemisphere that  particular region with blood. The cause of the blocking of the two arteries  was discovered, for little warty vegetations were found on the mitral valve  of the left side of the heart. I interpreted the two attacks thus: one of  these warty vegetations had become detached, and escaping into the arterial  circulation, entered the left carotid artery and eventually stuck in the  posterior branch of the middle cerebral artery, causing a temporary loss of  word memory, consequently a disturbance of the whole speech zone of the  left hemisphere. This would account for the deafness to spoken language and  loss of speech for a fortnight, with impairment for more than a month,  following the first attack. But both ears are represented in each half of  the brain; that is to say, sound vibrations entering either ear, although  they produce vibrations only in one auditory nerve, nevertheless proceed  subsequently to both auditory centres. The path most open, however, for  transmission is to the opposite hemisphere; thus the right hemisphere  receives most vibrations from the left ear and _vice versa_. Consequently  the auditory centre in the right hemisphere was able very soon to take on  the function of associating verbal sounds with the sense of movement of  articulate speech and recovery took place. _But_, when by a second attack  the corresponding vessel of the opposite half of the brain was blocked the  terminal avenues, and the central stations for the reception of the  particular modes of motion associated with sound vibration of all kinds  were destroyed _in toto_; and the patient became stone deaf. It would have  been extremely interesting to have seen whether, having lost that portion  of the brain which constitutes the primary incitation of speech, this  patient could have been taught lip language.    There is no doubt that persons who become deaf from destruction of the  peripheral sense organ late in life do not lose the power of speech, and  children who are stone deaf from ear disease and dumb in consequence can be  trained to learn to speak by watching and imitating the movements of  articulation. Helen Keller indeed, although blind, was able to learn to  speak by the education of the tactile motor sense. By placing the hand on  the vocal instrument she appreciated by the tactile motor sense the  movements associated with phonation and articulation. The tactile motor  sense by education replaced in her the auditory and visual senses. The  following physiological experiment throws light on this subject. A dog that  had been deprived of sight by removal of the eyes when it was a puppy found  its way about as well as a normal dog; but an animal made blind by removal  of the occipital lobes of the brain was quite stupid and had great  difficulty in finding its way about. Helen Keller's brain, as shown by her  accomplishments in later life, was a remarkable one; not long after birth  she became deaf and blind, consequently there was practically only one  avenue of intelligence left open for the education of that brain, viz. the  tactile kinaesthetic. But the tactile motor sense is the active sense that  waits upon and contributes to every other sense. The hand is the instrument  of the mind and the agent of the will; consequently the tactile motor sense  is intimately associated in its structural representation in the brain with  every other sense. This avenue being open in Helen Keller, was used by her  teacher to the greatest possible advantage, and all the innate  potentialities of a brain naturally endowed with remarkable intellectual  powers were fully developed, and those cortical structures which normally  serve as the terminal stations (_vide_ fig. 16) for the reception and  analysis of light and sound vibrations were utilised to the full by Helen  Keller by means of association tracts connecting them with the tactile  motor central stations. The brain acts as a whole in even the simplest  mental processes by virtue of the fact that the so-called functional  centres in the brain are not isolated fields of consciousness, but are  inextricably associated one with another by association fibres.          THE PRIMARY REVIVAL OF SOME SENSATIONS IN THE BRAIN      I have on page 77 referred to Stricker's views on the primary revival of  words in the sense of movement of the lips and tongue. Mach (\"Analysis of  the Sensations\") says: \"The supposition that the processes in the larynx  during singing have had something to do with the formation of the tonal  series I noticed in one of my earlier publications, but did not find it  tenable. Singing is connected in too extrinsic and accidental a manner with  hearing to bear out such an hypothesis. I can hear and imagine tones far  beyond the range of my own voice. In listening to an orchestral performance  with all the parts, or in having an hallucination of such a performance, it  is impossible for me to think that my understanding of this broad and  complicated sound-fabric has been effected by my _one_ larynx, which is,  moreover, no very practised singer. I consider the sensations which in  listening to singing are doubtless occasionally noticed in the larynx a  matter of subsidiary importance, like the pictures of the keys touched  which when I was more in practice sprang up immediately into my imagination  on hearing a performance on the piano or organ. When I imagine music, I  always distinctly hear the notes. Music can no more come into being merely  through the motor sensations accompanying musical performances, than a deaf  man can hear by watching the movements of players. I cannot therefore agree  with Stricker on this point\" (comp. Stricker, \"Du langage et de la  musique,\" Paris, 1885).    Of the motor type myself and having a fairly good untrained ear for music,  I find that to memorise a melody, whether played by an instrument or by an  orchestra, I must either try to sing or hum that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13117"],[0,"The Nests and Eggs of Indian Birds, Volume 1 (#12)"],[1,"nests  consist of soft hair, downy feathers, and moss, all of which they  collect in large quantities. They build in the months of February and  March; but I once found a nest of young Indian Grey Tits so late as  the 10th November. They lay six eggs, white with light red spots. On  one occasion I saw a nest in a bank by the side of the road; when the  only young bird it contained was nearly fledged the road had to be  widened, and workmen were employed in cutting down the bank. The poor  parent birds appeared to be perfectly aware that their nest would soon  be reached, and after trying in vain to persuade the young one to come  out, they pushed it down into the road but could get it no further,  though they did their utmost to take it out of the reach of danger. I  placed it among the bushes above the road, and then the parents seemed  to be immediately conscious of its safety.\"    Mr. H.R.P. Carter notes that he \"found a nest of the Grey Tit at  Coonoor, on the Nilgiris, on the 15th May. It was placed in a hole in  a bank by the roadside. It was a flat pad, composed of the fur of  the hill-hare, hairs of cattle, &c., and was fluffy and without  consistence. It contained three half-set eggs.\"    Mr. J. Darling, Jun., says:--\"I have found the nests at Ooty, Coonoor,  Neddivattam, and Kartary, at all heights from 5000 to nearly 8000 feet  above the sea, on various dates between 17th February and 10th May.    \"It builds in banks, or holes in trees, at all heights from the  ground, from 3 to 30 feet. It is fond of taking possession of the old  nest-holes of the Green Woodpecker. The nest is built of fur or fur  and moss, and always lined with fine fur, generally that of hares. Its  shape depends upon that of the hole in which it is placed, but the  egg-cavity or depression is about 3 inches in diameter and an inch in  depth.    \"It lays four, five, and sometimes six eggs, but I think more commonly  only four.\"    Dr. Jerdon remarks:--\"I once found its nest in a deserted bungalow at  Kallia, in the corner of the house. It was made chiefly of the down of  hares (_Lepus nigricollis_), mixed with feathers, and contained six  eggs, white spotted with rusty red.\"    The eggs resemble in their general character those of many of our  English Tits, and though, I think, typically slightly longer, they  appear to me to be very close to those of _Parus palustris_. In shape  they are a broad oval, but somewhat elongated and pointed towards the  small end. The ground-colour is pinkish white, and round the large end  there is a conspicuous, though irregular and imperfect, zone of red  blotches, spots, and streaks. Spots and specks of the same colour, or  occasionally of a pale purple, are scantily sprinkled over the rest of  the surface of the egg, and are most numerous in the neighbourhood of  the zone. The eggs have a faint gloss. Some eggs do not exhibit the  zone above referred to, but even in these the markings are much more  numerous and dense towards the large end.    In length the eggs vary from 0.65 to 0.78, and in breadth from 0.5 to  0.58; but the average of thirty-eight is 0.71 by 0.54, so that they  are really, as indeed they look _as a body_, a shade shorter and  decidedly broader than those of _P. monticola_.      34. Parus monticola, Vig. _The Green-backed Tit_.    Parus monticolus, _Vig., Jerd. B. Ind._ ii, p. 277; _Hume, Rough Draft  N. & E._ no. 644.    The Green-backed Tit breeds through the Himalayas, at elevations of  from 4000 to 7000 or 8000 feet.    The breeding-season lasts from March to June, and some birds at any  rate must have two broods, since I found three fresh eggs in the  wall of the Pownda dak bungalow about the 20th June. More eggs are,  however, to be got in April than in any other month.    They build in holes, in trees, bamboos, walls, and even banks, but  walls receive, I think, the preference.    The nests are loose dense masses of soft downy fur or feathers, with  more or less moss, according to the situation.    The eggs vary from six to eight, and I have repeatedly found seven  and eight young ones; but Captain Beavan has found only five of  these latter, and although I consider from six to eight the normal  complement, I believe they very often fail to complete the full  number.    Captain Beavan says:--\"At Simla, on May 4th, 1866, I found a nest of  this species in the wall of one of my servant's houses. It contained  five young ones, and was composed of fine grey pushm or wool resting  on an understructure of moss.\"    At Murree Colonel C.H.T. Marshall notes that this species \"breeds  early in May in holes in walls and trees, laying white eggs covered  with red spots.\"    Speaking of a nest he took at Dhurmsala, Captain Cock says:--    \"The nest was in a cavity of a rhododendron tree, and was a large mass  of down of some animal; it looked like rabbit's fur, which of course  it was not, but it was some dark, soft, dense fur. The nest contained  seven eggs, and was found on the 28th April, 1869. The eggs were all  fresh.\"    Mr. Gammie says:--\"I got one nest of this Tit here on the 14th May in  the Chinchona reserves (Sikhim), at an elevation of about 4500 feet.  It was in partially cleared country, in a natural hole of a stump,  about 5 feet from the ground. The nest was made of moss and lined  with soft matted hair; but I pulled it out of the hole carelessly and  cannot say whether it had originally any defined shape. It contained  four hard-set eggs.\"    The eggs are very like those of _Parus atriceps_; but they are  somewhat longer and more slender, and as a rule are rather more  thickly and richly marked.    They are moderately broad ovals, sometimes almost perfectly  symmetrical, at times slightly pointed towards one end, and almost  entirely devoid of gloss. The ground is white, or occasionally a  delicate pinkish white, in some richly and profusely spotted and  blotched, in others more or less thickly speckled and spotted with  darker or lighter shades of blood-, brick-, slightly purplish-, or  brownish-red, as the case may be. The markings are much denser towards  the large end, where in some eggs they form an imperfect and irregular  cap. In size they vary from 0.68 to 0.76 in length, and from 0.49 to  0.54 in breadth; but the average of thirty-two eggs is 0.72 by 0.52  nearly.      35. Aegithaliscus erythrocephalus (Vig.). _Red-headed Tit_.    Aegithaliscus erythrocephalus (_Vig._) _Jerd. B. Ind._ ii, p. 270;  _Hume, Rough Draft N. & E._ no. 634.    The Red-headed Tit breeds throughout the Himalayas from Murree to  Bhootan, at elevations of from 6000 to 9000 or perhaps 10,000 feet.    They commence breeding very early. I have known nests to be taken  quite at the beginning of March, and they continue laying till the end  of May.    The nest is, I think, most commonly placed in low stunted hill-oak  bushes, either suspended between several twigs, to all of which it is  more or less attached, or wedged into a fork. _I have_ found the nest  in a deodar tree, _laid_ on a horizontal bough. I have seen them in  tufts of grass, in banks and other unusual situations; but the great  bulk build in low bushes, and of these the hill-oak is, I think, their  favourite.    The nests closely resemble those of the Long-tailed Tit (_Acredula  rosea_). They are large ovoidal masses of moss, lichen, and  moss-roots, often tacked together a good deal outside with  cotton-wool, down of different descriptions, and cobwebs. They average  about 41/2 inches in height or length, and about 31/2 inches in diameter.  The aperture is on one side near the top. The egg-cavity, which may  average about 21/4 inches in diameter and about the same in depth below  the lower edge of the aperture, is densely lined with very soft down  or feathers.    They lay from six to eight eggs, but I once found only four eggs in a  nest, and these fully incubated.    From Murree, Colonel C.H.T. Marshall notes that this species \"builds a  globular nest of moss and hair and feathers in thorny bushes. The eggs  we found were pinkish white, with a ring of obsolete brown spots at  the larger end. Size 0.55 by 0.43. Lays in May.\"    Captain Hutton tells us that the Red-cap Tit is \"common at Mussoorie  and in the hills generally, throughout the year. It breeds in April  and May. The situation chosen is various, as one taken in the former  month at Mussoorie, at 7000 feet elevation, was placed on the side  of a bank among overhanging coarse grass, while another taken in the  latter month, at 5000 feet, was built among some ivy twining round a  tree, and at least 14 feet from the ground. The nest is in shape a  round ball with a small lateral entrance, and is composed of green  mosses warmly lined with feathers. The eggs are five in number, white  with a pinkish tinge, and sparingly sprinkled with lilac spots or  specks, and having a well-defined lilac ring at the larger end.\"    From Nynee Tal, Colonel G.F.L. Marshall writes:--\"This species makes  a beautifully neat nest of fine moss and lichens, globular, with  side entrance, and thickly lined with soft feathers. A nest found on  Cheena, above Nynee Tal, on the 24th May, 1873, at an elevation of  about 7000 feet, was wedged into a fork at the end of a bough of a  cypress tree, about 10 feet from the ground, the entrance turned  inwards towards the trunk of the tree. It contained one tiny egg,  white, with a dark cloudy zone round the larger end.    \"About the 10th of May, at Naini Tal, I was watching one of these  little birds, which kept hanging about a small rhododendron stump  about 2 feet high, with very few leaves on it, but I could see no  nest. A few days later I saw the bird carry a big caterpillar to the  same stump and come away shortly without it; so I looked more  closely and found the nest, containing nearly full-fledged young, so  beautifully wedged into the stump that it appeared to be part of it,  and nothing but the tiny circular entrance revealed that the "]]]
