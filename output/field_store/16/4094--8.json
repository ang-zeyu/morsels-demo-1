[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10324"],[0,"Bull Hunter (#12)"],[1," the sheriff  straight to the hotel. Anderson arrived with his best pair of guns in  his holsters, for the sheriff was a two-gun man of the best variety.  He came with the aggressive manner of one ready to beat down all  opposition, but when he stepped into the room, his manner changed. For  he found sitting about the table in the dining room, which was to be  the scene of the conference, the six most influential men of the  town--men strong enough to reelect him next year, or to throw him  permanently out of office.    At the lower end of the table stood Bull Hunter, his arms folded, his  face blank. Standing with the light from the lamp shining upon his  face, the others seated, he seemed a man among pygmies.    \"Shall I lock the door?\" asked the proprietor, and he turned to Bull,  as if the latter had the right to dictate.    Bull nodded.    \"All right, sheriff,\" the proprietor went on to explain. \"Our young  friend yonder says that he's got something to say to you. He's asked  each of us to hang around and be a witness. Are you ready?\"    \"Jud,\" burst out the sheriff, \"you're an idiot! This overgrown booby  needs a horsewhipping, and that's the sort of an answer I'd like to  make to him.\"    Having delivered this broadside he strode up and confronted Bull. It  was a very poor move. In the first place, the sheriff had insulted one  of the men who was about to act as his official judge. In the second  place, by putting himself so close to Bull, he made himself appear a  trifle ludicrous. Also, if he expected to throw Bull out of the poise  with this blustering, he failed. It was not that Bull did not feel  fear, but he had seen a curious thing--the sinewy, long neck of the  sheriff--and he was wondering what would happen if one of his hands  should grip that throat for a single instant. He grew so fascinated by  this study that he forgot his fear of the sheriff's guns.    Anderson hastened to retreat from his false position. \"Gents,\" he  said, \"excuse me for getting edgy. But, if you want me to listen to  this fellow's talk--\"    \"Hunter is his name--Bull Hunter,\" said the proprietor.    The sheriff took his place at the far end of the long table. Like  Bull, he preferred to stand. \"Start in your talk,\" he commanded.    \"It looks to me,\" said Bull gently, \"that they's only one gent here  that's wearing a gun.\" He had thrown his own belt on a chair; and now  he fixed his eyes on the weapons of Anderson.    The sheriff glared. \"You want me to take off my guns? Son, I'd rather  go naked!\"    Jud, the hotel man, had already been insulted once by the sheriff, and  he had been biding his time. This seemed an excellent opening. \"Looks  to me,\" he remarked, \"like Mr. Hunter was right. He's got something  pretty serious to say, and he don't want to take no chances on your  cutting him short with a bullet!\"    The sheriff glared at Bull and then cast a swift glance over the faces  of the others. He read upon them only one expression--a cold  curiosity. Plainly they agreed with Jud, and the sheriff gave way. He  took off his belt and tossed it upon a chair near him. Then he faced  Bull again, but he faced the big man with half his confidence  destroyed. As he had said, he felt worse than naked without his  revolvers under his touch, but now he attempted to brave out the  situation.    \"Well,\" he said jocularly, \"what you going to accuse me of, Bull  Hunter?\"    \"I'm just going to tell a little story that I been thinking about,\"  said Bull.    \"Story--nothing!\" exclaimed Anderson.    \"Wait a minute,\" broke in Jud. \"Let him tell this his own way--I think  you'd best, sheriff!\"    Bull was looking at the sheriff and through him into the distance.  After all, it was a story, as distinctly a story as if he had it in a  book. As he began to tell it, he forgot Sheriff Anderson at the  farther end of the table. He talked slowly, bringing the words out one  by one, as if what he said were coming to him by inspiration--a kind  of second sight.    \"It starts in,\" said Bull, \"the other night when the gent come in with  word that Pete Reeve was out playing cards with Armstrong and losing  money. When the sheriff heard that, he started to thinking. He was  remembering how he'd hated Armstrong for a good many years, and that  made him think that maybe Armstrong would get into trouble with Reeve,  because Reeve is a pretty good shot, and the sheriff hoped that, if it  come to a showdown, Reeve would shoot Armstrong full of holes. And  that started him wishing pretty strong that Armstrong would  get killed!\"    \"Do I have to stand here and listen to this fool talk?\" demanded the  sheriff.    \"I'm just supposing,\" said Bull. \"Surely they ain't any harm in just  supposing?\"    \"Not a bit,\" decided Jud, who had taken the position of main arbiter.    \"Well, the sheriff got to wishing Armstrong was dead so strong that it  didn't seem he could stand to have him living much more. He told the  folks that he was going out to see that no harm come to Armstrong from  Reeve. Then he got on his hoss and went out. All the way he was  thinking hard. Armstrong was the gent that was sheriff before  Anderson; Armstrong was the gent that might get the job and throw him  out again. Ain't that clear? Well, the sheriff gets close to the  cabin and--\"    He paused and slowly extended his long arm toward the sheriff. \"What'd  you do then?\"    \"Me? I heard a shot--\"    \"You left your hoss standing in the brush near the house,\" interrupted  Bull, \"and you went along on foot.\"    \"Does that sound reasonable, a gent going on foot when he might ride?\"  demanded the sheriff.    \"You didn't want to make no noise,\" said Bull, and his great voice  swallowed the protest of the sheriff.    Anderson cast another glance at the listeners. Plainly they were  fascinated by this tale, and they were following it step by step  with nods.    \"You didn't make no noise, either,\" went on Bull Hunter. \"You slipped  up to the cabin real soft, and you climbed up on the east side of the  house over some rocks.\"    \"Why in reason should a man climb over rocks? Why wouldn't he go right  to the door?\"    \"Because you didn't want to be seen.\"    \"Then why not the west window, fool!\"    \"You tried that window first, but they was some dry brush lying in  front of it, and you couldn't come close enough to look in without  making a noise stepping on the dead wood. So then you went around to  the other side and climbed over the rocks until you could look into  the cabin. Am I right?\"    \"I--no, curse you, no! Of course you ain't right!\" shouted Anderson.    \"Looking right through that window,\" said Bull heavily, \"you seen  Armstrong, the man you hated, facing you, and, with his back turned,  was Pete Reeve. You said to yourself, 'Drop Armstrong with a bullet,  catch Reeve, and put the blame on him!' Then you pulled your gun.\"    He pushed aside the ponderous armchair which stood beside him at the  head of the table.    \"Say,\" shouted the sheriff, paler than ever now, \"what are you  accusing me of?\"    \"Murder!\" thundered Bull Hunter.    The roar of Bull's voice chained every one in his place, the sheriff  with staring eyes, and Jud in the act of raising his hand.    \"I'll jail you for slander!\" said the sheriff, fighting to assurance  and knowing that he was betrayed by his pallor and by the icy  perspiration which he felt on his forehead.    \"Anderson,\" said Bull, \"I seen the marks of them iron heels of yours  on the rock!\"    That was a little thing, of course. As evidence it would not have  convinced the most prejudiced jury in the world, but Sheriff Anderson  was not weighing small points. Into his mind leaped one image--the  whiteness of those rocks on which he had stood and the indelible mark  his heels must have made against that whiteness. He was lost, he felt,  and he acted on the impulse to fight for his life.    One last glance he cast at the six listeners, and in their wide-eyed  interest he read his own damnation. Then Anderson whirled and leaped  for his belt with the guns.    Out of six throats came six yells of fear; there was a noise of chairs  being pushed back and a wild scramble to find safety under the table.  Jud, risking a moment's delay, knocked the chimney off the lamp before  he dived. The flame leaped once and went out, but the pale moonshine  poured through the window and filled the room with a weird play  of shadows.    What Bull Hunter saw was not the escape of the sheriff, but a sudden  blind rage against everything and everybody. It was a passion that set  him trembling through all of his great body. One touch of trust, one  word of encouragement had been enough to make him a giant to tear up  the stump in the presence of Jessie and his cousins; how far more  mighty he was in the grip of this new emotion, this rage.    His own gun was far away, but guns were not what he wanted. They were  uncongenial toys to his great hands. Instead, he reached down and  caught up that massive chair of oak, built to resist time, built to  bear even such a bulk as that of Bull Hunter with ease. Yet he caught  it up in one hand, weighed it behind his head at the full limit of his  extended arm, and then, bending forward, he catapulted the great  missile down the length of the table. It hit the lamp on the way and  splintered it to small bits, its momentum unimpeded. Hurtling on  across the table it shot at the sheriff as he whirled with his guns in  his hands.    Fast as the chair shot forward, the hand of the sheriff was faster  still. Bull saw the big guns twitch up, silver in the moonshine. They  exploded in one voice, as if the flying mass of wood were an animate  object. Then the sheriff was struck and hurled crashing along  the floor.          CHAPTER 9      At that fall the six men scampered from beneath the table to seize the  downed man. There was no need of their haste. Sheriff Anderson was a  wreck rather than a fighting man. One arm was horribly crumpled  beneath him; "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1036"],[0,"Joe Wilson and His Mates (#12)"],[1,"n't  seen her look round) she said--    'Go to bed.'    'Beg pardon?' (Her face was the same as before the tears.)    'Go to bed. There's a bed made for you inside on the sofa.'    'But--the team--I must----'    'What?'    'The team. I left it at the camp. I must look to it.'    'Oh! Well, Brighten will ride down and bring it up in the morning--or  send the half-caste. Now you go to bed, and get a good rest. The boy  will be all right. I'll see to that.'    I went out--it was a relief to get out--and looked to the mare. Brighten  had got her some corn* and chaff in a candle-box, but she couldn't eat  yet. She just stood or hung resting one hind-leg and then the other,  with her nose over the box--and she sobbed. I put my arms round her neck  and my face down on her ragged mane, and cried for the second time since  I was a boy.         * Maize or Indian corn--wheat is never called corn in       Australia.--    As I started to go in I heard Brighten's sister-in-law say, suddenly and  sharply--    'Take THAT away, Jessie.'    And presently I saw Mrs Brighten go into the house with the black  bottle.    The moon had gone behind the range. I stood for a minute between the  house and the kitchen and peeped in through the kitchen window.    She had moved away from the fire and sat near the table. She bent over  Jim and held him up close to her and rocked herself to and fro.    I went to bed and slept till the next afternoon. I woke just in time  to hear the tail-end of a conversation between Jim and Brighten's  sister-in-law. He was asking her out to our place and she promising to  come.    'And now,' says Jim, 'I want to go home to \"muffer\" in \"The Same Ol'  Fling\".'    'What?'    Jim repeated.    'Oh! \"The Same Old Thing\",--the waggon.'    The rest of the afternoon I poked round the gullies with old Brighten,  looking at some 'indications' (of the existence of gold) he had found.  It was no use trying to 'pump' him concerning his sister-in-law;  Brighten was an 'old hand', and had learned in the old Bush-ranging and  cattle-stealing days to know nothing about other people's business. And,  by the way, I noticed then that the more you talk and listen to a bad  character, the more you lose your dislike for him.    I never saw such a change in a woman as in Brighten's sister-in-law  that evening. She was bright and jolly, and seemed at least ten years  younger. She bustled round and helped her sister to get tea ready. She  rooted out some old china that Mrs Brighten had stowed away somewhere,  and set the table as I seldom saw it set out there. She propped Jim up  with pillows, and laughed and played with him like a great girl. She  described Sydney and Sydney life as I'd never heard it described before;  and she knew as much about the Bush and old digging days as I did. She  kept old Brighten and me listening and laughing till nearly midnight.  And she seemed quick to understand everything when I talked. If she  wanted to explain anything that we hadn't seen, she wouldn't say that it  was 'like a--like a'--and hesitate (you know what I mean); she'd hit the  right thing on the head at once. A squatter with a very round, flaming  red face and a white cork hat had gone by in the afternoon: she said  it was 'like a mushroom on the rising moon.' She gave me a lot of good  hints about children.    But she was quiet again next morning. I harnessed up, and she dressed  Jim and gave him his breakfast, and made a comfortable place for him  on the load with the 'possum rug and a spare pillow. She got up on the  wheel to do it herself. Then was the awkward time. I'd half start to  speak to her, and then turn away and go fixing up round the horses, and  then make another false start to say good-bye. At last she took Jim up  in her arms and kissed him, and lifted him on the wheel; but he put his  arms tight round her neck, and kissed her--a thing Jim seldom did  with anybody, except his mother, for he wasn't what you'd call an  affectionate child,--he'd never more than offer his cheek to me, in his  old-fashioned way. I'd got up the other side of the load to take him  from her.    'Here, take him,' she said.    I saw his mouth twitching as I lifted him. Jim seldom cried nowadays--no  matter how much he was hurt. I gained some time fixing Jim comfortable.    'You'd better make a start,' she said. 'You want to get home early with  that boy.'    I got down and went round to where she stood. I held out my hand and  tried to speak, but my voice went like an ungreased waggon wheel, and I  gave it up, and only squeezed her hand.    'That's all right,' she said; then tears came into her eyes, and she  suddenly put her hand on my shoulder and kissed me on the cheek. 'You be  off--you're only a boy yourself. Take care of that boy; be kind to your  wife, and take care of yourself.'    'Will you come to see us?'    'Some day,' she said.    I started the horses, and looked round once more. She was looking up at  Jim, who was waving his hand to her from the top of the load. And I saw  that haggard, hungry, hopeless look come into her eyes in spite of the  tears.      I smoothed over that story and shortened it a lot, when I told it to  Mary--I didn't want to upset her. But, some time after I brought Jim  home from Gulgong, and while I was at home with the team for a few days,  nothing would suit Mary but she must go over to Brighten's shanty and  see Brighten's sister-in-law. So James drove her over one morning in the  spring-cart: it was a long way, and they stayed at Brighten's overnight  and didn't get back till late the next afternoon. I'd got the place in a  pig-muck, as Mary said, 'doing for' myself, and I was having a snooze  on the sofa when they got back. The first thing I remember was some one  stroking my head and kissing me, and I heard Mary saying, 'My poor boy!  My poor old boy!'    I sat up with a jerk. I thought that Jim had gone off again. But it  seems that Mary was only referring to me. Then she started to pull grey  hairs out of my head and put 'em in an empty match-box--to see how many  she'd get. She used to do this when she felt a bit soft. I don't  know what she said to Brighten's sister-in-law or what Brighten's  sister-in-law said to her, but Mary was extra gentle for the next few  days.          'Water Them Geraniums'.          I. A Lonely Track.      The time Mary and I shifted out into the Bush from Gulgong to 'settle on  the land' at Lahey's Creek.    I'd sold the two tip-drays that I used for tank-sinking and dam-making,  and I took the traps out in the waggon on top of a small load of rations  and horse-feed that I was taking to a sheep-station out that way. Mary  drove out in the spring-cart. You remember we left little Jim with  his aunt in Gulgong till we got settled down. I'd sent James (Mary's  brother) out the day before, on horseback, with two or three cows and  some heifers and steers and calves we had, and I'd told him to clean up  a bit, and make the hut as bright and cheerful as possible before Mary  came.    We hadn't much in the way of furniture. There was the four-poster cedar  bedstead that I bought before we were married, and Mary was rather proud  of it: it had 'turned' posts and joints that bolted together. There was  a plain hardwood table, that Mary called her 'ironing-table', upside  down on top of the load, with the bedding and blankets between the  legs; there were four of those common black kitchen-chairs--with apples  painted on the hard board backs--that we used for the parlour; there was  a cheap batten sofa with arms at the ends and turned rails between the  uprights of the arms (we were a little proud of the turned rails); and  there was the camp-oven, and the three-legged pot, and pans and buckets,  stuck about the load and hanging under the tail-board of the waggon.    There was the little Wilcox & Gibb's sewing-machine--my present to Mary  when we were married (and what a present, looking back to it!). There  was a cheap little rocking-chair, and a looking-glass and some  pictures that were presents from Mary's friends and sister. She had her  mantel-shelf ornaments and crockery and nick-nacks packed away, in the  linen and old clothes, in a big tub made of half a cask, and a box  that had been Jim's cradle. The live stock was a cat in one box, and in  another an old rooster, and three hens that formed cliques, two against  one, turn about, as three of the same sex will do all over the world. I  had my old cattle-dog, and of course a pup on the load--I always had a  pup that I gave away, or sold and didn't get paid for, or had 'touched'  (stolen) as soon as it was old enough. James had his three spidery,  sneaking, thieving, cold-blooded kangaroo-dogs with him. I was taking  out three months' provisions in the way of ration-sugar, tea, flour, and  potatoes, &c.    I started early, and Mary caught up to me at Ryan's Crossing on Sandy  Creek, where we boiled the billy and had some dinner.    Mary bustled about the camp and admired the scenery and talked too much,  for her, and was extra cheerful, and kept her face turned from me as  much as possible. I soon saw what was the matter. She'd been crying  to herself coming along the road. I thought it was all on account of  leaving little Jim behind for the first time. She told me that she  couldn't make up her mind till the last moment to leave him, and that,  a mile or two along the road, she'd have turned back for him, only that  she knew her sister would laugh at her. She was always terribly anxious  about the children.    We cheered each other up, and Mary drove with me the rest of the way  to the creek, along the lonely branch track, across native-apple-tree  flats. It was a dreary, hopeless track. There was no horizon, nothing  but the rough ashen trunks of the gnarled and stunted trees in all  directions, little or no undergrowth, and the ground, save for the  coarse, brownish tufts of dead grass, as bare as the road, for it was "]]]
