Yours most sincerely,        JOHN ELLER,        Metropolitan Opera Co., Chicago, Ill.    From this letter it was fairly inferable that although the defendant  might be innocent of the precise crime with which he was charged, he  was, nevertheless, upon his own evidence, guilty of having \"faked\" a  cheap Nicholas violin into a Strad., and of having offered it for sale  for the exorbitant price of five thousand dollars. This luckless piece  of evidence undoubtedly influenced the jury to convict him.    It will be recalled that ten witnesses for the prosecution had sworn  that the violin offered in evidence at the trial was _not_ the one  produced in the police court, as against the defendant's five who  asserted that it _was_.    The testimony was all highly technical and confusing, and the jury  probably relied more upon their general impressions of the credibility  of the witnesses than upon anything else. It is likely that most of the  testimony, on both sides, in regard to the identity of the violin was  honestly given, for the question was one upon which a genuine divergence  of opinion was easily possible.    Eller's letter from Chicago so affected the jury that they disregarded  his testimony and reverted to that of August Gemunder, to whose evidence  attention has already been called, and who swore that it was \"The Duke  of Cambridge\" which Flechter had tried to sell to Durden. Alas for the  fallibility of even the most honest of witnesses!    The case was ably argued by both sides, and every phase of this curious  tangle of evidence given its due consideration. The defense very  properly laid stress upon the fact that it would have been a ridiculous  performance for Flechter to write the \"Cave Dweller\" letter and state  therein that he was \"a violin dealer or maker,\" thus pointing,  unmistakably, to himself, and to further state that for one in his  position to dispose of it would be difficult and dangerous. The only  explanation for the \"Cave Dweller\" letter which they could offer,  however, was that some one interested in procuring Flechter's downfall  had caused it to be sent for that purpose. This might either be a  business rival or some one connected with the prosecution.    While Palmer was summing up for the defense he noticed Assistant  District Attorney Allen smiling and dramatically turning upon him, he  shouted: \"This is no laughing matter, Colonel Allen. It is a very  serious matter whether this man is to be allowed to-night to go home and  kiss his little ones, or whether he is to be cast into jail because you  used your brains to concoct a theory against him.\"    Another consideration, which seemed deserving of weight, was that if  Flechter did steal \"The Duke of Cambridge\" it would have been a piece of  incredible folly and carelessness upon his part to leave it in such an  exposed place as the safe of his store, where it could be found by the  police or shown by the office-boy to any one who called.    Yet the positive identification of August Gemunder and the fatal  disclosures of Eller, coupled with the vehement insistence of the  prosecution, led the jury to resolve what doubt they had in the case  against the prisoner, and, after deliberating eight or ten hours and  being out all night, they returned a verdict of guilty. Flechter broke  down and declared bitterly that he was the victim of a conspiracy upon  the part of his enemies, assisted by a too credulous prosecuting  attorney. Everybody admitted that it was an extraordinary case, but the  press was consistent in its clamor against Flechter, and opinion  generally was that he had been rightly convicted. On May 22nd he was  sentenced to the penitentiary for twelve months, but, after being  incarcerated in the Tombs for three weeks, he secured a certificate of  reasonable doubt and a stay until his conviction could be reviewed on  appeal. Then he gave bail and was released. But he had been in jail!  Flechter will never forget that! And, for the time being at least, his  reputation was gone, his family disgraced, and his business ruined.    A calm reading of the record of the trial suggests that the case  abounded in doubts more or less reasonable, and that the Court might  well have taken it from the jury on that account. But a printed page of  questions and answers carries with it no more than a suggestion of the  value of testimony the real significance of which lies in the manner in  which it is given, the tone of the voice and the flash of the eye.    Once again Flechter sat at his desk in the window behind the great  gilded fiddle. To him, as to its owner, the great Stradivarius had  brought only sorrow. But for him the world had no pity. Surely the  strains of this wonderful instrument must have had a \"dying fall\" even  when played by the loving hand of old Jean Bott.    At last, after several years, in 1899, the case came up in the Appellate  Division of the Supreme Court. Flechter had been led to believe that his  conviction would undoubtedly be reversed and a new trial ordered, which  would be tantamount to an acquittal, for it was hardly likely in such an  event that a second trial would be considered advisable upon the same  evidence. But to his great disappointment his conviction was sustained  by a divided court, in which only two of the five justices voted for a  new trial. Again Fortune had averted her face. If only one more judge  had thought the evidence insufficient! The great gilded fiddle seemed to  Flechter an omen of misfortune. Once more he gave bail, this time in  five thousand dollars, and was set at liberty pending his appeal to the  highest court in the State. Once more he took his seat in his office and  tried to carry on his business.    But time had dragged on. People had forgotten all about Flechter and the  lost Stradivarius, and when his conviction was affirmed little notice  was taken of the fact. It was generally assumed that having been  sentenced he was in jail.    Then something happened which once more dragged Flechter into the  limelight. Editors rushed to their files and dusted the cobwebs off the  issues containing the accounts of the trial. The sign of the gilded  fiddle became the daily centre of a throng of excited musicians, lawyers  and reporters. The lost Stradivarius--the great \"Duke of Cambridge\"--the  nemesis of Bott and of Flechter--was found--by Flechter himself, as he  claimed, on August 17, 1900. According to the dealer and his witnesses  the amazing discovery occurred in this wise. A violin maker named Joseph  Farr, who at one time had worked for Flechter and had testified in his  behalf at the trial (to the effect that the instrument produced in the  police court was _not_ Bott's Stradivarius) saw by chance a very fine  violin in the possession of a family named Springer in Brooklyn, and  notified Flechter of the fact. The latter, who was always ready to  purchase choice violins, after vainly trying for a long time to induce  the Springers to bring it to New York, called with Farr upon Mrs.  Springer and asked to examine it. To his utter astonishment she produced  for his inspection Bott's long-lost Stradivarius. Hardly able to control  his excitement Flechter immediately returned to New York and reported  the discovery to the police, who instantly began a thorough examination  of the circumstances surrounding its discovery.    The District Attorney's office and the Detective Bureau were at first  highly suspicious of this opportune discovery on the part of a convicted  felon of the precise evidence necessary to clear him, but it was soon  demonstrated to their pretty general satisfaction that the famous  Stradivarius had in fact been pawned in the shop of one Benjamin Fox on  the very day and within an hour of the theft, together with its case and  two bows, for the insignificant sum of four dollars. After the legal  period of redemption had expired it had been put up at auction and bid  in by the pawnbroker for a small advance over the sum for which it had  been pawned. It lay exposed for purchase on Fox's shelf for some months,  until, in December, 1895, a tailor named James Dooly visited the shop to  redeem a silver watch. Being, at the same time, in funds, and able to  satisfy his taste as a virtuoso, he felt the need of and bought a violin  for ten dollars, but, Fox urging upon him the desirability of getting a  good one while he was about it, was finally persuaded to purchase the  Bott violin for twenty dollars in its stead. Dooly took it home, played  upon it as the spirit moved, and whenever in need of ready money brought  it back to Fox as security, always redeeming it in time to prevent its  sale. One day, being at Mrs. Springer's, where he was accustomed to  purchase tailor trimmings, he offered it to her for sale, and, as her  son was taking violin lessons, induced her to buy it for thirty dollars.  And in the house of the Springers it had quietly remained ever since,  while lawyers and prosecutors wrangled and thundered and witnesses swore  positively to the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, to  prove that Flechter stole the violin and tried to sell it to Durden.    On these facts, which did not seem to admit of contradiction, Recorder  Goff ordered an oral examination of all the witnesses, the hearing of  which, sandwiched in between the current trials in his court, dragged  along for months, but which finally resulted in establishing to the  Court's satisfaction that the violin discovered in the possession of the  Springers was the genuine \"Duke of Cambridge,\" and that it could not  have been in Flechter's possession at the time he was arrested.    On July 7, 1902, eight years after Bott's death and the arrest and  indictment of Flechter for the theft of the violin, a picturesque group  assembled in the General Sessions. There was Flechter and his lawyer,  Mrs."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13177"],[0,"Chocolate and Cocoa Recipes and Home Made Candy Recipes (#12)"],[1,"in cold water; remove it from the pan and  dispose above the cocoanut layer. Let stand until cold and firm, then  cut in cubes; wrap each cube in waxed paper.      FONDANT        4 cups of granulated sugar,      1-1/2 cups of cold water,      1/4 a teaspoonful of cream of tartar, or 3 drops of acetic acid.    Stir the sugar and water in a saucepan, set on the back part of the  range, until the sugar is melted, then draw the saucepan to a hotter  part of the range, and stir until the boiling point is reached; add the  cream of tartar or acid and, with the hand or a cloth wet repeatedly in  cold water, wash down the sides of the saucepan, to remove any grains of  sugar that have been thrown there. Cover the saucepan and let boil  rapidly three or four minutes. Remove the cover, set in the  thermometer--if one is to be used--and let cook very rapidly to 240 deg. F.,  or the soft ball degree. Wet the hand in cold water and with it dampen a  marble slab or a large platter, then without jarring the syrup turn it  onto the marble or platter. Do not scrape out the saucepan or allow the  last of the syrup to drip from it, as sugary portions will spoil the  fondant by making it grainy. When the syrup is cold, with a metal  scraper or a wooden spatula, turn the edges of the mass towards the  center, and continue turning the edges in until the mass begins to  thicken and grow white, then work it up into a ball, scraping all the  sugar from the marble onto the mass; knead slightly, then cover closely  with a heavy piece of cotton cloth wrung out of cold water. Let the  sugar stand for an hour or longer to ripen, then remove the damp cloth  and cut the mass into pieces; press these closely into a kitchen bowl,  cover with a cloth wrung out of water (this cloth must not touch the  fondant) and then with heavy paper. The fondant may be used the next  day, but is in better condition after several days, and may be kept  almost indefinitely, if the cloth covering it be wrung out of cold water  and replaced once in five or six days. Fondant may be used, white or  delicately colored with vegetable color-pastes or with chocolate, as  frosting for small cakes, or eclairs or for making candy \"centers,\" to  be coated with chocolate or with some of the same fondant tinted and  flavored appropriately.      ALMOND CHOCOLATE CREAMS        CENTERS        1/4 a cup of blanched almonds, chopped fine,      1/2 a cup of fondant,      1/4 a teaspoonful of vanilla,      Confectioner's sugar for kneading and shaping.        CHOCOLATE COATING        About 1 cup of fondant,      2 squares of Baker's Chocolate,      1 teaspoonful of vanilla extract,      Few drops of water, as needed,      Halves of blanched almonds.    Mix the chopped almonds with the fondant and vanilla; add confectioner's  sugar, a little at a time, and knead the mass thoroughly, on a marble or  large platter; shape into a long roll, then cut into small pieces of the  same size. Shape these into balls a generous half inch in diameter and  leave them about an hour to harden on the outside. Put the fondant for  the coating and the chocolate (shaved or broken in pieces) in a double  boiler (with hot water in the lower receptacle); add the vanilla and the  water and heat until melted; take out the spoon and put in a dipping  fork (a wire fork costing about ten cents) beat the fondant, to keep it  from crusting and drop in a \"center;\" with the fork cover it with  fondant; put the fork under it and lift it out, scrape the fork lightly  on the edge of the dish, to remove superfluous candy, turn the fork over  and drop the bon-bon onto waxed paper. Make a design with the fork in  taking it from the candy. At once press half of a blanched almond on the  top of the candy, or the design made with the fork will suffice. If at  any time the coating be too thick, add a few drops of water. If any be  left over, use it to coat whole nuts or cherries.    [Illustration: ALMOND AND CHERRY CHOCOLATE CREAMS.]      CHERRY CHOCOLATE CREAMS        CENTERS        1/4 a cup of candied cherries, chopped fine,      1/2 a cup of fondant.        CHOCOLATE COATING        About one cup of fondant,      2 squares of Baker's Chocolate,      1 teaspoonful of vanilla extract,      Bits of cherry.    Prepare the centers and coat in the same manner as the almond creams.      CHOCOLATE PEPPERMINTS    [Illustration: CHOCOLATE PEPPERMINTS.]    Melt a little fondant and flavor it to taste with essence of peppermint;  leave the mixture white or tint very delicately with green or pink  color-paste. With a teaspoon drop the mixture onto waxed paper to make  rounds of the same size--about one inch and a quarter in diameter--let  these stand in a cool place about one hour. Put about a cup of fondant  in a double boiler, add two ounces of chocolate and a teaspoonful of  boiling water, then stir (over hot water) until the fondant and  chocolate are melted and evenly mixed together; then drop the  peppermints, one by one, into the chocolate mixture, and remove them  with the fork to a piece of oil cloth; let stand until the chocolate is  set, when they are ready to use.      FIG-AND-NUT CHOCOLATES    [Illustration: FIG AND NUT CHOCOLATES.]        5 figs,      3 or 4 tablespoonfuls of water or sherry wine,      1/2 a cup of English walnut meats,      Powdered sugar,      Fondant,      3 or 4 ounces of Baker's Chocolate,      1 teaspoonful of vanilla.    Remove the stem and hard place around the blossom end of the figs, and  let steam, with the water or wine, in a double boiler until softened,  then add the nuts and chop very fine. Add powdered sugar as is needed to  shape the mixture into balls. Melt the chocolate, using enough to secure  the shade of brown desired in the coating and add to the fondant with  the vanilla. Coat the fig-and-nut balls and drop them with the fork onto  a piece of oil cloth or waxed paper in the same manner as the cherry  bon-bons. These may be dipped in \"Dot\" Chocolate instead of fondant.      CHOCOLATE MARSHMALLOWS    [Illustration: CHOCOLATE MARSHMALLOWS.]    Cut the marshmallows in halves, and put them, one by one, cut side down,  in chocolate fondant (as prepared for almond and cherry chocolate  creams), melted over hot water and flavored to taste with vanilla. Beat  the chocolate with the fork, that it may not crust over, lift out the  marshmallow, turn it and, in removing the fork, leave its imprint in the  chocolate; sprinkle at once with a little fine-chopped pistachio nut  meat. To prepare the nuts, set them over the fire in tepid water to  cover, heat to the boiling point, drain, cover with cold water, then  take them up, one by one, and with the thumb and finger push the meat  from the skin.      MAPLE FONDANT ACORNS    [Illustration: MAPLE FONDANT ACORNS.]        2 cups of maple syrup,      1-3/4 cups of granulated sugar,      3/4 a cup of cold water,      Confectioner's sugar,      2 or more squares of Baker's Chocolate,      1 teaspoon of vanilla,      About 1/4 a cup of fine-chopped almonds, browned in the oven.    Make fondant of the syrup, granulated sugar and cold water, following  the directions given for fondant made of granulated sugar (cream of  tartar or other acid is not required in maple fondant). Work some of the  fondant, adding confectioner's sugar as needed, into cone shapes; let  these stand an hour or longer to harden upon the outside. Put a little  of the fondant in a dish over hot water; add Baker's Chocolate and  vanilla as desired and beat till the chocolate is evenly mixed through  the fondant, then dip the cones in the chocolate and set them on a piece  of oil cloth or waxed paper. When all are dipped, lift the first one  dipped from the paper and dip the base again in the chocolate, and then  in the chopped-and-browned almonds. Continue until all have been dipped.      CHOCOLATE ALMOND BARS    [Illustration: CHOCOLATE ALMOND BARS.]        1/2 a cup of sugar,      3/4 a cup of glucose,      1/2 a cup of water,      (1/4 an ounce of paraffine at discretion),      1/2 a cup of blanched almonds, chopped fine,      1/3 the recipe for fondant,      3 or 4 ozs. of Baker's Chocolate,      1 teaspoonful of vanilla.    Melt the sugar in the water and glucose and let boil to about 252 deg. F.,  or between a soft and a hard ball. Without the paraffine cook a little  higher than with it. Add the almonds and the vanilla, mix thoroughly and  turn onto a marble or platter over which powdered sugar has been sifted.  Turn out the candy in such a way that it will take a rectangular shape  on the marble. When cool enough score it in strips about an inch and a  quarter wide, and, as it grows cooler, lift the strips, one by one, to a  board and cut them in pieces half or three-quarters of an inch wide.  When cold, drop them, sugar side down, in chocolate fondant prepared for  \"dipping.\" With the fork push them below the fondant, lift out, drain as  much as possible, and set onto oil cloth. These improve upon keeping.      ALMOND FONDANT STICKS    [Illustration: ALMOND FONDANT STICKS.]        2-1/2 cups of coffee A or granulated sugar,      1/4 a cup of glucose,      1/2 a cup of water,      1/4 a pound of almond paste,      1/4 a pound of Baker's Premium Chocolate,      1 teaspoonful of vanilla extract,      1/2 a pound of Baker's \"Dot\" Chocolate.    Put the sugar, glucose and water over the fire. Stir until the sugar is  dissolved. Wash down the sides of the kettle as in making fondant. Let  boil to the soft ball degree or to 238 deg. F. Add the almond paste, cut  into small, thin pieces, let boil up vigorously, then turn onto a damp  marble. When nearly cold turn to a cream with a wooden spatula. It will  take considerable time to turn this mixture to fondant. Cover and let  stand half an hour. Add the Baker's Premium Chocolate, melted over hot  water, and knead it in thoroughly. Add at the same time the vanilla. The  chocolate must be added warm. At once cut off a portion of"]]]
