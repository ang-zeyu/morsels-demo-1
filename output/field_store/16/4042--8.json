And here was Major Allardyce's big girl,  Coppy's property, preparing to venture into their borders! What would  Coppy say if anything happened to her? If the Goblins ran off with her as  they did with Curdie's Princess? She must at all hazards be turned back.    The house was still. Wee Willie Winkie reflected for a moment on the very  terrible wrath of his father; and then--broke his arrest! It was a crime  unspeakable. The low sun threw his shadow, very large and very black, on  the trim garden-paths, as he went down to the stables and ordered his  pony. It seemed to him in the hush of the dawn that all the big world had  been bidden to stand still and look at Wee Willie Winkie guilty of mutiny.  The drowsy groom handed him his mount, and, since the one great sin made  all others insignificant, Wee Willie Winkie said that he was going to ride  over to Coppy Sahib, and went out at a foot-pace, stepping on the soft  mould of the flower-borders.    The devastating track of the pony's feet was the last misdeed that cut him  off from all sympathy of Humanity, He turned into the road, leaned  forward; and rode as fast as the pony could put foot to the ground in the  direction of the river.    But the liveliest of twelve-two ponies can do little against the long  canter of a Waler. Miss Allardyce was far ahead, had passed through the  crops, beyond the Police-post when all the guards were asleep, and her  mount was scattering the pebbles of the river bed as Wee Willie Winkie  left the cantonment and British India behind him. Bowed forward and still  flogging, Wee Willie Winkie shot into Afghan territory, and could just see  Miss Allardyce a black speck, flickering across the stony plain. The  reason of her wandering was simple enough. Coppy, in a tone of  too-hastily-assumed authority, had told her over night, that she must not  ride out by the river. And she had gone to prove her own spirit and teach  Coppy a lesson.    Almost at the foot of the inhospitable hills, Wee Willie Winkie saw the  Waler blunder and come down heavily. Miss Allardyce struggled clear, but  her ankle had been severely twisted, and she could not stand. Having thus  demonstrated her spirit, she wept copiously, and was surprised by the  apparition of a white, wide-eyed child in khaki, on a nearly spent pony.    \"Are you badly, badly hurted?\" shouted Wee Willie Winkie, as soon as he  was within range. \"You didn't ought to be here.\"    \"I don't know,\" said Miss Allardyce, ruefully, ignoring the reproof. \"Good  gracious, child, what are _you_ doing here?\"    \"You said you was going acwoss ve wiver,\" panted Wee Willie Winkie,  throwing himself off his pony. \"And nobody--not even Coppy--must go acwoss  ve wiver, and I came after you ever so hard, but you wouldn't stop, and  now you've hurted yourself, and Coppy will be angwy wiv me, and--I've  bwoken my awwest! I've bwoken my awwest!\"    The future Colonel of the 195th sat down and sobbed. In spite of the pain  in her ankle the girl was moved.    \"Have you ridden all the way from cantonments, little man? What for?\"    \"You belonged to Coppy. Coppy told me so!\" wailed Wee Willie Winkie,  disconsolately. \"I saw him kissing you, and he said he was fonder of you  van Bell or ve Butcha or me. And so I came. You must get up and come back.  You didn't ought to be here. Vis is a bad place, and I've bwoken my  awwest.\"    \"I can't move, Winkie,\" said Miss Allardyce, with a groan. \"I've hurt my  foot. What shall I do?\"    She showed a readiness to weep afresh, which steadied Wee Willie Winkie,  who had been brought up to believe that tears were the depth of  unmanliness. Still, when one is as great a sinner as Wee Willie Winkie,  even a man may be permitted to break down,    \"Winkie,\" said Miss Allardyce, \"when you've rested a little, ride back and  tell them to send out something to carry me back in. It hurts fearfully.\"    The child sat still for a little time and Miss Allardyce closed her eyes;  the pain was nearly making her faint. She was roused by Wee Willie Winkie  tying up the reins on his pony's neck and setting it free with a vicious  cut of his whip that made it whicker. The little animal headed toward the  cantonments.    \"Oh, Winkie! What are you doing?\"    \"Hush!\" said Wee Willie Winkie. \"Vere's a man coming--one of ve Bad Men. I  must stay wiv you. My faver says a man must _always_ look after a girl.  Jack will go home, and ven vey'll come and look for us. Vat's why I let  him go.\"    Not one man but two or three had appeared from behind the rocks of the  hills, and the heart of Wee Willie Winkie sank within him, for just in  this manner were the Goblins wont to steal out and vex Curdie's soul. Thus  had they played in Curdie's garden, he had seen the picture, and thus had  they frightened the Princess's nurse. He heard them talking to each other,  and recognized with joy the bastard Pushto that he had picked up from one  of his father's grooms lately dismissed. People who spoke that tongue  could not be the Bad Men. They were only natives after all.    They came up to the bowlders on which Miss Allardyce's horse had  blundered.    Then rose from the rock Wee Willie Winkie, child of the Dominant Race,  aged six and three-quarters, and said briefly and emphatically \"_Jao!_\"  The pony had crossed the river-bed.    The men laughed, and laughter from natives was the one thing Wee Willie  Winkie could not tolerate. He asked them what they wanted and why they did  not depart. Other men with most evil faces and crooked-stocked guns crept  out of the shadows of the hills, till, soon, Wee Willie Winkie was face to  face with an audience some twenty strong, Miss Allardyce screamed.    \"Who are you?\" said one of the men.    \"I am the Colonel Sahib's son, and my order is that you go at once. You  black men are frightening the Miss Sahib. One of you must run into  cantonments and take the news that Miss Sahib has hurt herself, and that  the Colonel's son is here with her.\"    \"Put our feet into the trap?\" was the laughing reply. \"Hear this boy's  speech!\"    \"Say that I sent you--I, the Colonel's son. They will give you money.\"    \"What is the use of this talk? Take up the child and the girl, and we can  at least ask for the ransom. Ours are the villages on the heights,\" said a  voice in the background.    These _were_ the Bad Men--worse than Goblins--and it needed all Wee Willie  Winkie's training to prevent him from bursting into tears. But he felt  that to cry before a native, excepting only his mother's _ayah_, would be  an infamy greater than any mutiny. Moreover, he, as future Colonel of the  195th, had that grim regiment at his back.    \"Are you going to carry us away?\" said Wee Willie Winkie, very blanched  and uncomfortable.    \"Yes, my little _Sahib Bahadur_,\" said the tallest of the men, \"and eat  you afterward.\"    \"That is child's talk,\" said Wee Willie Winkie. \"Men do not eat men.\"    A yell of laughter interrupted him, but he went on firmly,--\"And if you do  carry us away, I tell you that all my regiment will come up in a day and  kill you all without leaving one. Who will take my message to the Colonel  Sahib?\"    Speech in any vernacular--and Wee Willie Winkie had a colloquial  acquaintance with three--was easy to the boy who could not yet manage his  \"r's\" and \"th's\" aright.    Another man joined the conference, crying:--\"O foolish men! What this babe  says is true. He is the heart's heart of those white troops. For the sake  of peace let them go both, for if he be taken, the regiment will break  loose and gut the valley. _Our_ villages are in the valley, and we shall  not escape. That regiment are devils. They broke Khoda Yar's breast-bone  with kicks when he tried to take the rifles; and if we touch this child  they will fire and rape and plunder for a month, till nothing remains.  Better to send a man back to take the message and get a reward. I say that  this child is their God, and that they will spare none of us, nor our  women, if we harm him.\"    It was Din Mahommed, the dismissed groom of the Colonel, who made the  diversion, and an angry and heated discussion followed. Wee Willie Winkie,  standing over Miss Allardyce, waited the upshot. Surely his \"wegiment,\"  his own \"wegiment,\" would not desert him if they knew of his extremity.             *         *         *         *         *    The riderless pony brought the news to the 195th, though there had been  consternation in the Colonel's household for an hour before. The little  beast came in through the parade ground in front of the main barracks,  where the men were settling down to play Spoil-five till the afternoon.  Devlin, the Color Sergeant of E Company, glanced at the empty saddle and  tumbled through the barrack-rooms, kicking up each Room Corporal as he  passed. \"Up, ye beggars! There's something happened to the Colonel's son,\"  he shouted.    \"He couldn't fall off! S'elp me, 'e _couldn't_ fall off,\" blubbered a  drummer-boy, \"Go an' hunt acrost the river. He's over there if he's  anywhere, an' maybe those Pathans have got 'im. For the love o' Gawd don't  look for 'im in the nullahs! Let's go over the river.\"    \"There's sense in Mott yet,\" said Devlin. \"E Company, double out to the  river--sharp!\"    So E Company, in its shirt-sleeves mainly, doubled for the dear life, and  in the rear toiled the perspiring Sergeant, adjuring it to double yet  faster. The cantonment was alive with the men of the 195th hunting for Wee  Willie Winkie, and the Colonel finally overtook E Company, far too  exhausted to swear, struggling in the pebbles of the river-bed.    Up the hill under which Wee Willie Winkie's Bad Men were discussing the  wisdom of carrying off the child and the girl, a look-out fired two shots.    \"What have I said?\" shouted Din Mahommed. \"There is the warning!

Though  he was a man of dignity, for he sat in his own pew, he could not escape the  rod of the pragmatical tithingman. Being rudely disturbed, but not wholly  wakened, the bewildered sheep-farmer sprung to his feet, seized his  astonished and mortified wife by the shoulders and shook her violently,  shouting at the top of his voice, \"Haw back! haw back! Stand still, will  ye?\" Poor goodman and goodwife! many years elapsed ere they recovered from  that keen disgrace.    The ministers encouraged and urged the tithingmen to faithfully perform  their allotted work. One early minister \"did not love sleepers in ye  meeting-house, and would stop short in ye exercise and call pleasantlie to  wake ye sleepers, and once of a warm Summer afternoon he did take hys hat  off from ye pegg in ye beam, and put it on, saying he would go home and  feed his fowles and come back again, and maybe their sleepe would be ended,  and they readie to hear ye remainder of hys discourse.\" Another time he  suggested that they might like better the Church of England service of  sitting down and standing up, and we can be sure that this \"was competent  to keepe their eyes open for a twelvemonth.\"    All this was in the church of Mr. Whiting, of Lynn, a somewhat jocose  Puritan,--if jocularity in a Puritan is not too anomalous an attribute  to have ever existed. We can be sure that there was neither sleeping nor  jesting allusion to such an irreverence in Mr. Mather's, Mr. Welde's, or  Mr. Cotton's meetings. In many rigidly severe towns, as in Portsmouth in  1662 and in Boston in 1667, it was ordered by the selectmen as a proper  means of punishment that a \"cage be made or some other means invented for  such as sleepe on the Lord's Daie.\" Perhaps they woke the offender up and  rudely and summarily dragged him out and caged him at once and kept him  thus prisoned throughout the nooning,--a veritable jail-bird.    A rather unconventional and eccentric preacher in Newbury awoke one sleeper  in a most novel manner. The first name of the sleeping man was Mark, and  the preacher in his sermon made use of these Biblical words: \"I say unto  you, mark the perfect man and behold the upright.\" But in the midst of his  low, monotonous sermon-voice he roared out the word \"mark\" in a loud shout  that brought the dozing Mark to his feet, bewildered but wide awake.    Mr. Moody, of York, Maine, employed a similar device to awaken and mortify  the sleepers in meeting. He shouted \"Fire, fire, fire!\" and when the  startled and blinking men jumped up, calling out \"Where?\" he roared back in  turn, \"In hell, for sleeping sinners.\" Rev. Mr. Phillips, of Andover, in  1755, openly rebuked his congregation for \"sleeping away a great part of  the sermon;\" and on the Sunday following an earthquake shock which was felt  throughout New England, he said he hoped the \"Glorious Lord of the Sabbath  had given them such a shaking as would keep them awake through one  sermon-time.\" Other and more autocratic parsons did not hesitate to call  out their sleeping parishioners plainly by name, sternly telling them also  to \"Wake up!\" A minister in Brunswick, Maine, thus pointedly wakened one of  his sweet-sleeping church-attendants, a man of some dignity and standing  in the community, and received the shocking and tautological answer, \"Mind  your own business, and go on with your sermon.\"    The women would sometimes nap a little without being discovered. \"Ye women  may sometimes sleepe and none know by reason of their enormous bonnets. Mr.  Whiting doth pleasantlie say from ye pulpit hee doth seeme to be preaching  to stacks of straw with men among them.\"    From this seventeenth-century comment upon the size of the women's bonnets,  it may be seen that objections to women's overwhelming and obscuring  headgear in public assemblies are not entirely complaining protests of  modern growth. Other records refer to the annoyance from the exaggerated  size of bonnets. In 1769 the church in Andover openly \"put to vote whether  the parish Disapprove of the Female sex sitting with their Hats on in the  Meeting-house in time of Divine Service as being Indecent.\" The parish did  Disapprove, with a capital D, for the vote passed in the affirmative. There  is no record, however, to tell whether the Indecent fashion was abandoned,  but I warrant no tithingman was powerful enough to make Andover women take  off their proudly worn Sunday bonnets if they did not want to. Another town  voted that it was the \"Town's Mind\" that the women should take off their  bonnets and \"hang them on the peggs,\" as did the men their headgear. But  the Town's Mind was not a Woman's Mind; and the big-bonnet wearers, vain  though they were Puritans, did as they pleased with their own bonnets.  And indeed, in spite of votes and in spite of expostulations, the female  descendants of the Puritans, through constantly recurring waves of fashion,  have ever since been indecently wearing great obscuring hats and bonnets in  public assemblies, even up to the present day.    The tithingman had other duties than awakening the sleepers and looking  after \"the boyes that playes and rapping those boyes,\"--in short, seeing  that every one was attentive in meeting except himself,--and the duties  and powers of the office varied in different communities. Several of these  officers were appointed in each parish. In Newbury, in 1688, there were  twenty tithingmen, and in Salem twenty-five. They were men of authority,  not only on Sunday, but throughout the entire week. Each had several  neighboring families (usually ten, as the word \"tithing\" would signify)  under his charge to watch during the week, to enforce the learning of the  catechism at home, especially by the children, and sometimes he heard them  \"Say their Chatachize.\" These families he also watched specially on the  Sabbath, and reported whether all the members thereof attended public  worship. Not content with mounting guard over the boys on Sundays, he also  watched on weekdays to keep boys and \"all persons from swimming in the  water.\" Do you think his duties were light in July and August, when school  was out, to watch the boys of ten families? One man watching one family  cannot prevent such \"violations of the peace\" in country towns now-a-days.  He sometimes inspected the \"ordinaries\" and made complaint of any disorders  which he there discovered, and gave in the names of \"idle tiplers and  gamers,\" and he could warn the tavern-keeper to sell no more liquor to any  toper whom he knew or fancied was drinking too heavily. Josselyn complained  bitterly that during his visit to New England in 1663 at \"houses of  entertainment called ordinaries into which a stranger went, he was  presently followed by one appointed to that office who would thrust himself  into his company uninvited, and if he called for more drink than the  officer thought in his judgment he could soberly bear away, he would  presently countermand it, and appoint the proportion beyond which he could  not get one drop.\" The tithingman had a \"spetial eye-out\" on all bachelors,  who were also carefully spied upon by the constables, deacons, elders,  and heads of families in general. He might, perhaps, help to collect the  ministerial rate, though his principal duty was by no means the collecting  of tithes. He \"worned peple out of ye towne.\" This warning was not at all  because the new-comers were objectionable or undesired, but was simply a  legal form of precaution, so that the parish would never be liable for the  keeping of the \"worned\" ones in case they thereafter became paupers. He  administered the \"oath of fidelity\" to new inhabitants. The tithingman  also watched to see that \"no young people walked abroad on the eve of the  Sabbath,\"--that is, on a Saturday night. He also marked and reported all  those \"who lye at home,\" and others who \"prophanely behaved, lingered  without dores at meeting time on the Lordes Daie,\" all the \"sons of Belial  strutting about, setting on fences, and otherwise desecrating the  day.\" These last two classes of offenders were first admonished by the  tithingman, then \"Sett in stocks,\" and then cited before the Court. They  were also confined in the cage on the meeting-house green, with the Lord's  Day sleepers. The tithingman could arrest any who walked or rode at too  fast a pace to and from meeting, and he could arrest any who \"walked or  rode unnecessarily on the Sabath.\" Great and small alike were under his  control, as this notice from the \"Columbian Centinel\" of December, 1789,  abundantly proves. It is entitled \"The President and the Tything man:\"--        \"The President, on his return to New York from his late tour through      Connecticut, having missed his way on Saturday, was obliged to ride a      few miles on Sunday morning in order to gain the town at which he had      previously proposed to have attended divine service. Before he arrived      however he was met by a Tything man, who commanding him to stop,      demanded the occasion of his riding; and it was not until the President      had informed him of every circumstance and promised to go no further      than the town intended that the Tything man would permit him to proceed      on his journey.\"    Various were the subterfuges to outwit the tithingman and elude his  vigilance on the Sabbath. We all remember the amusing incident in \"Oldtown  Folks.\" A similar one really happened. Two gay young sparks driving through  the town on the Sabbath were stopped by the tithingman; one offender said  mournfully in excuse of his Sabbath travel, \"My grandmother is lying dead  in the next town.\" Being allowed to drive on, he stood up in his wagon when  at a safe distance and impudently shouted back, \"And she's been lying dead  in the graveyard there for thirty years.\"    Thus it may be seen that the ancient tithingman was pre-eminently a general  _snook_, to use an old and expressive"]]]
