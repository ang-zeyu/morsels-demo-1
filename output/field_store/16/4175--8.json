There ain't a doubt of it, and if I  held you, you'd get clear on self-defense. So I ain't going to lay a  hand on you. You're free: but one thing more. You cut off  there--see?--and bear away north from the Three B's. You got a hoss that  _is_, and believe me, you'll need him before you're through.\" He  lowered his voice and his eyes bulged with the terror of his tidings:  \"Feed him the leather; ride to beat hell; never stop while your hoss can  raise a trot; and then slide off your hoss and get another. Son, in  three days Mac Strann'll be on your trail!\"    He stepped back and waved his arms.    \"Now, _vamos!_\"    The black stallion flicked back its ears and winced from the outflung  hands, but the rider remained imperturbed.    \"I never heard of Mac Strann,\" said Barry.    \"You never heard of Mac Strann?\" echoed the other.    \"But I'd like to meet him,\" said Barry.    The deputy marshal blinked his eyes rapidly, as though he needed to  clear his vision.    \"Son,\" he said hoarsely. \"I c'n see you're game. But don't make a fall  play. If Mac Strann gets you, he'll California you like a yearling. You  won't have no chance. You've done for Jerry, there ain't a doubt of  that, but Jerry to Mac is like a tame cat to a mountain-lion. Lad, I c'n  see you're a stranger to these parts, but ask me your questions and I'll  tell you the best way to go.\"    Barry slipped from the saddle.    He said: \"I'd like to know the best place to put up my hoss.\"    The deputy marshal was speechless.    \"But I s'pose,\" went on Barry, \"I can stable him over there behind the  hotel.\"    Matthews pushed off his sombrero and rubbed his short fingers through  his hair. Anger and amazement still choked him, but he controlled  himself by a praiseworthy effort.    \"Barry,\" he said, \"I don't make you out. Maybe you figure to wait till  Mac Strann gets to town before you leave; maybe you think your hoss can  outrun anything on four feet. And maybe it can. But listen to me: Mac  Strann ain't fast on a trail, but the point about him is that he never  leaves it! You can go through rain and over rocks, but you can't never  shake Mac Strann--not once he gets the wind of you.\"    \"Thanks,\" returned the gentle-voiced stranger. \"I guess maybe he'll be  worth meeting.\"    And so saying he turned on his heel and walked calmly towards the big  stables behind the hotel and at his heels followed the black dog and the  black horse. As for deputy marshal Matthews, he moistened his lips to  whistle, but when he pursed them, not a sound came. He turned at length  into the barroom and as he walked his eye was vacant. He was humming  brokenly:       _\"Sweet Adeline, my Adeline,     At night, dear heart, for you I pine.\"_    Inside, he took firm hold upon the bar with both pudgy hands.    \"O'Brien,\" he said, \"red-eye.\"    He pushed away the small glass which the bartender spun towards him and  seized in its place a mighty water-tumbler.    \"O'Brien,\" he explained, \"I need strength, not encouragement.\" And  filling the glass nearly to the brim he downed the huge potion at a  single draught.          CHAPTER XI    THE BUZZARD      Most animals have their human counterparts, and in that room where Jerry  Strann had fallen a whimsical observer might have termed Jerry, with his  tawny head, the lion, and O'Brien behind the bar, a shaggy bear, and the  deputy marshal a wolverine, fat but dangerous, and here stood a man as  ugly and hardened as a desert cayuse, and there was Dan Barry, sleek and  supple as a panther; but among the rest this whimsical observer must  have noticed a fellow of prodigious height and negligible breadth, a  structure of sinews and bones that promised to rattle in the wind, a  long, narrow head, a nose like a beak, tiny eyes set close together and  shining like polished buttons, and a vast Adam's apple that rolled up  and down the scraggy throat. He might have done for the spirit of Famine  in an old play; but every dweller of the mountain-desert would have  found an apter expression by calling him the buzzard of the scene.  Through his prodigious ugliness he was known far and wide as \"Haw-Haw\"  Langley; for on occasion Langley laughed, and his laughter was an  indescribable sound that lay somewhere between the braying of a mule and  the cawing of a crow. But Haw-Haw Langley was usually silent, and he  would sit for hours without words, twisting his head and making little  pecking motions as his eyes fastened on face after face. All the  bitterness of the mountain-desert was in Haw-Haw Langley; if his body  looked like a buzzard, his soul was the soul of the vulture itself, and  therefore he had followed the courses of Jerry Strann up and down the  range. He stuffed his gorge with the fragments of his leader's food; he  fed his soul with the dangers which Jerry Strann met and conquered.    In the barroom Haw-Haw Langley had stood turning his sharp little eyes  from Jerry Strann to Dan Barry, and from Dan Barry back to Strann; and  when the shot was fired something like a grin twisted his thin lips; and  when the spot of red glowed on the breast of the staggering man, the  eyes of Haw-Haw blazed as if with the reflection of a devouring fire.  Afterwards he lingered for a few minutes making no effort to aid the  fallen man, but when he had satisfied himself with the extent of the  injury, and when he had noted the froth of bloody bubbles which stained  the lips of Strann, Haw-Haw Langley turned and stalked from the room.  His eyes were points of light and his soul was crammed to repletion with  ill-tidings.    At the hitching rack he stepped into the saddle of a diminutive horse,  whirled it into the street with a staggering jerk of the reins, and  buried the spurs deep in the cow-pony's flanks. The poor brute snorted  and flirted its heels in the air, but Langley wrapped his long legs  around the barrel of his mount and goaded it again.    His smile, which began with the crack of Barry's gun in O'Brien's place,  did not die out until he was many a mile away, headed far up through the  mountains; but as he put peak after peak behind him and as the white  light of the day diminished and puffs of blue shadow drowned the  valleys, the grin disappeared from Haw-Haw's face. He became keenly  intent on his course until, having reached the very summit of a tall  hill, he came to a halt and peered down before him.    It was nearly dusk by this time and the eyes of an ordinary man could  not distinguish a tree from a rock at any great distance; but it seemed  that Haw-Haw was gifted with eyes extraordinary--the buzzard at the top  of its sky-towering circles does not see the brown carcass far below  with more certainty than Haw-Haw sensed his direction. He waited only a  few seconds before he rolled the rowel once more along the scored flanks  of his mustang and then plunged down the slope at a reckless gallop.    His destination was a hut, or rather a lean-to, that pressed against the  side of the mountain, a crazy structure with a single length of stove  pipe leaning awry from the roof. And at the door of this house Haw-Haw  Langley drew rein and stepped to the ground. The interior of the hut was  dark, but Haw-Haw stole with the caution of a wild Indian to the  entrance and reconnoitered the interior, probing every shadowy corner  with his glittering eyes. For several long moments he continued this  examination, and even when he was satisfied that there was no one in the  place he did not enter, but moved back several paces from the door and  swept the sides of the mountains with an uneasy eye. He made out, a  short distance from the door, a picketed horse which now reared up its  head from the miserable scattering of grass on which it fed and stared  at the stranger. The animal must have bulked at least twice as large as  the mount which had brought Langley to the mountain-side. And it was  muscled even out of proportion to its bulk. The head was so tremendously  broad that it gave an almost square appearance, the neck, short and  thick, the forelegs disproportionately small but very sturdy; and the  whole animal was built on a slope towards the hind quarters which seemed  to equal in massiveness all the rest of the body. One would have said  that the horse was a freak meant by nature for the climbing of hills.  And to glance at it no man could suppose that those ponderous limbs  might be moved to a gallop. However, Haw-Haw Langley well knew the  powers of the ugly beast, and he even made a detour and walked about the  horse to view it more closely.    Now he again surveyed the darkening landscape and then turned once more  to the house. This time he entered with the boldness of a possessor  approaching his hearth. He lighted a match and with this ignited a  lantern hanging from the wall to the right of the door. The furnishings  of the dwelling were primitive beyond compare. There was no sign of a  chair; a huddle of blankets on the bare boards of the floor made the  bed; a saddle hung by one stirrup on one side and on the other side  leaned the skins of bob-cats, lynx, and coyotes on their stretching and  drying boards. Haw-Haw took down the lantern and examined the pelts. The  animals had been skinned with the utmost dexterity. As far as he could  see the hides had not been marred in a single place by slips of the  knife, nor were there any blood stains to attest hurried work, or  careless shooting in the first place. The inner surfaces shone with the  pure white of old parchment But Haw-Haw gave his chief attention to the  legs and the heads of the skins, for these were the places where  carelessness or stupidity with the knife were sure to show; but the work  was perfect in every respect. Until even the critical Haw-Haw Langley  was forced to step back and shake his head in admiration. He continued  his survey of the room.    In one corner stood a rifle"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12443"],[0,"The Jute Industry: From Seed to Finished Cloth (#12)"],[1," rolls or spools appear against the wall near  the bank.    The completed chain from the warping mill or the linking machine is  now taken to the beaming frame, and after the threads, or rather the  small groups of threads, in the pin lease have been disposed in a  kind of coarse comb or reed, termed an veneer or radial, and  arranged to occupy the desired width in the veneer, they are  attached in some suitable way to the weaver's beam. The chain is  held taut, and weights applied to the presser on the beam while the  latter is rotated. In this way a solid compact beam of yarn is  obtained. The end of the warp--that one that goes on to the beam  last--contains the weaver's lease, and when the completed beam is  removed from the beaming or winding-on frame, this single-thread  lease enables the next operative to select the threads individually  and to draw the threads, usually single, but sometimes in pairs, in  which case the lease would be in pairs, through the eyes of the  camas or HEALDS, or to select them for the purpose of tying them to  the ends of the warp in the loom, that is to the \"thrum\" of a cloth  which has been completed.    Instead of first making a warp or chain on the warping mill, or on  the linking machine, and then beaming such warp on to the weaver's  beam or loom beam as already described, two otherwise distinct  processes of warping and beaming may be conducted simultaneously.  Thus, the total number of threads required for the manufacture of any  particular kind of cloth--unless the number of threads happens to be  very high--may be wound on to the loom beam direct from the spools.  Say, for example, a warp was required to be 600 yards long, and that  there should be 500 threads in all. Five hundred spools of warp yarn  would be placed in the two wings of a V-shaped bank, and the threads  from these spools taken in regular order, and threaded through the  splits or openings of a reed which is placed in a suitable position  in regard to the winding-on mechanism. Some of the machines which  perform the winding-on of the yarn are comparatively simple, while  others are more or less complicated. In some the loom beam rotates  at a fixed number of revolutions per minute, while in others the  beam rotates at a gradually decreasing number of revolutions per  minute. One of the latter types made by MESSRS Urquhart, Lindsay & Co.,  Ltd., Dundee, is illustrated in Fig. 29, and the mechanism displayed  is identical with that employed for No. 4 method of preparing warps.    The V-shaped bank with its complement of spools (500 in our example)  would occupy a position immediately to the left of Fig. 29. The  threads would pass through a reed and then in a straight wide sheet  between the pair of rollers, these parts being contained in the  supplementary frame on the left. A similar frame appears on the  extreme right of the figure, and this would be used in conjunction  with another V-shaped bank, not shown, but which would occupy a  position further to the right, i.e. if one bank was not large enough  to hold the required number of spools. The part on the extreme right  can be ignored at present.    The threads are arranged in exactly the same way as indicated in Fig.  28 from the bank to the reed in front of the rollers in Fig. 29,  and on emerging from the pair of rollers are taken across the  stretch between the supplementary frame and the main central frame,  and attached to the weavers beam just below the pressing rollers. It  may be advisable to have another reed just before the beam, so that  the width occupied by the threads in the beam may be exactly the  same as the width between the two flanges of the loom beam.    [Illustration: FIG. 29 WINDING-ON OR DRY BEAMING MACHINE _By  permission of Messrs. Urquhart, Lindsay & Co. Ltd_.]    The speed of the threads is determined by the surface speed of the  two rollers in the supplementary frame, the bottom roller being  positively driven from the central part through the long horizontal  shaft and a train of wheels caged in as shown. The loom beam, which  is seen clearly immediately below the pressing rollers, is driven by  friction because the surface speed of the yarn must be constant;  hence, as the diameter over the yarn on the beam increases, the  revolutions per minute of the beam must decrease, and a varying  amount of slip takes place between the friction-discs and their  flannels.    As the loom beam rotates, the threads are arranged in layers between  the flanges of the loom beam. Thus, the 500 threads would be  arranged side by side, perhaps for a width of 45 to 46 in., and  bridging the gap between the flanges of the beam; the latter is thus,  to all intents and purposes, a very large bobbin upon which 500  threads are wound at the same time, instead of one thread as in the  ordinary but smaller bobbin or reel. It will be understood that in  the latter case the same thread moves from side to side in order to  bridge the gap, whereas in the former case each thread maintains a  fixed position in the width.    The last and most important method of making a warp, No. 4 method,  for the weaver is that where, in addition to the simultaneous  processes of warping and beaming as exemplified in the last example,  all the threads are coated with some suitable kind of starch or size  immediately they reach the two rollers shown in the supplementary  frame in Fig. 29. The moistened threads must, however, be dried  before they reach the loom beam. When a warp is starched, dried and  beamed simultaneously, it is said to be \"dressed.\"    In the modern dressing machine, such as that illustrated in Fig. 30,  there are six steam-heated cylinders to dry the starched yarns  before the latter reach the loom beams. Both banks, or rather part  of both, can be seen in this view, from which some idea will be  formed of the great length occupied. Several of the threads from the  spools in the left bank are seen converging towards the back reed,  then they pass between the two rollers--the bottom one of which is  partially immersed in the starch trough--and forward to the second  reed. After the sheet of threads leaves the second reed, it passes  partially round a small guide roller, then almost wholly round each  of three cylinders arranged  deg.o deg., and finally on to the loom beam.  Each cylinder is 4 feet diameter, and three of them occupy a  position between the left supplementary frame, and the central frame  in Fig. 29, while the remaining three cylinders are similarly  disposed between the central frame and the supplementary frame of  the right in the same illustration.    The number of steam-heated cylinders, and their diameter, depend  somewhat upon the type of yarn to be dressed, and upon the speed  which it is desired to run the yarn. A common speed for  ordinary-sized jute is from 18 to 22 yards per minute.    [Illustration: FIG. 30 A MODERN YARN DRESSING MACHINE WITH SIX  STEAM-HEATED CYLINDERS]    A different way of arranging the cylinders is exemplified in Fig. 31.  This view, which illustrates a machine made by Messrs. Charles Parker,  Sons & Co., Dundee, has been introduced to show that if the warps  under preparation contain a comparatively few threads, or if the  banks are made larger than usual, two warps may be dressed at the  same time. In such a case, three cylinders only would be used for  each warp, and the arrangement would be equivalent to two single  dressing machines. The two weaver's beams, with their pressing  rollers, are shown plainly in the centre of the illustration. Some  machines have four cylinders, others have six, while a few have eight.  A very similar machine to that illustrated in Fig. 31 is made so that  all the six cylinders may be used to dry yarns from two banks, and  all the yarns wound on to one weaver's beam, or all the yarns may be  wound on to one of the beams in the machine in Fig. 31 if the number  of threads is too many for one bank.    [Illustration: FIG. 31 DRESSING MACHINE FOR PREPARING TWO WARPS  SIMULTANEOUSLY _By permission of Messrs. Charles Parker, Sons & Co_.]    Suppose it is desired to make a warp of 700 threads instead of 500,  as in the above example; then 350 spools would be placed in each of  the two banks, the threads disposed as already described to use as  much of the heating surface of the cylinder as possible, and one  sheet of threads passed partially round what is known as a measuring  roller. Both sheets of threads unite into one sheet at the centre of  the machine in Fig. 31, and pass in this form on to one of the loom  beams.    It has already been stated that the lower roller in the starch box  is positively driven by suitable mechanism from the central part of  the machine, Fig. 29, while the upper roller, see Fig. 30, is a  pressing roller and is covered with cloth, usually of a flannel type.  Between the two rollers the sheet of 350 threads passes, becomes  impregnated with the starch which is drawn up by the surface of the  lower roller, and the superfluous quantity is squeezed out and  returns to the trough, or joins that which is already moving upwards  towards the nip of the rollers. The yarn emerges from the rollers  and over the cylinders at a constant speed, which may be chosen to  suit existing conditions, and it must also be wound on to the loom  beam at the same rate. But since the diameter of the beam increases  each revolution by approximately twice the diameter of the thread,  it is necessary to drive the beam by some kind of differential motion.    The usual way in machines for dressing jute yarns is to drive the  beam support and the beam by means of friction plates. A certain  amount of slip is always taking place--the drive is designed for  this purpose--and the friction plates are adjusted by the yarn  dresser during the operation of dressing to enable them to draw  forward the beam, and to slip in infinitesimal sections, so that the  yarn is drawn forward "]]]
