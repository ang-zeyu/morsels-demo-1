The late Mr. Caspari was a \"destroyer\" of books. His rare collection of  early woodcuts, exhibited in 1877 at the Caxton Celebration, had been  frequently augmented by the purchase of illustrated books, the plates  of which were taken out, and mounted on Bristol boards, to enrich  his collection. He once showed me the remains of a fine copy of  \"Theurdanck,\" which he had served so, and I have now before me several  of the leaves which he then gave me, and which, for beauty of engraving  and cleverness of typography, surpasses any typographical work known to  me. It was printed for the Emperor Maximilian, by Hans Schonsperger, of  Nuremberg, and, to make it unique, all the punches were cut on purpose,  and as many as seven or eight varieties of each letter, which, together  with the clever way in which the ornamental flourishes are carried above  and below the line, has led even experienced printers to deny its being  typography. It is, nevertheless, entirely from cast types. A copy in  good condition costs about L50.    Many years since I purchased, at Messrs. Sotheby's, a large lot of MS.  leaves on vellum, some being whole sections of a book, but mostly single  leaves. Many were so mutilated by the excision of initials as to be  worthless, but those with poor initials, or with none, were quite good,  and when sorted out I found I had got large portions of nearly twenty  different MSS., mostly Horae, showing twelve varieties of fifteenth  century handwriting in Latin, French, Dutch, and German. I had each sort  bound separately, and they now form an interesting collection.    Portrait collectors have destroyed many books by abstracting the  frontispiece to add to their treasures, and when once a book is made  imperfect, its march to destruction is rapid. This is why books  like Atkyns' \"Origin and Growth of Printing,\" 4o, 1664, have become  impossible to get.    When issued, Atkyns' pamphlet had a fine frontispiece, by Logan,  containing portraits of King Charles II, attended by Archbishop Sheldon,  the Duke of Albermarle, and the Earl of Clarendon. As portraits of  these celebrities (excepting, of course, the King) are extremely rare,  collectors have bought up this 4o tract of Atkyns', whenever it has been  offered, and torn away the frontispiece to adorn their collection.    This is why, if you take up any sale catalogue of old books, you are  certain to find here and there, appended to the description, \"Wanting  the title,\" \"Wanting two plates,\" or \"Wanting the last page.\"    It is quite common to find in old MSS., especially fifteenth century,  both vellum and paper, the blank margins of leaves cut away. This will  be from the side edge or from the foot, and the recurrence of this  mutilation puzzled me for many years. It arose from the scarcity of  paper in former times, so that when a message had to be sent which  required more exactitude than could be entrusted to the stupid memory of  a household messenger, the Master or Chaplain went to the library, and,  not having paper to use, took down an old book, and cut from its broad  margins one or more slips to serve his present need.    I feel quite inclined to reckon among \"enemies\" those bibliomaniacs and  over-careful possessors, who, being unable to carry their treasures into  the next world, do all they can to hinder their usefulness in this. What  a difficulty there is to obtain admission to the curious library of old  Samuel Pepys, the well-known diarist. There it is at Magdalene College,  Cambridge, in the identical book-cases provided for the books by Pepys  himself; but no one can gain admission except in company of two Fellows  of the College, and if a single book be lost, the whole library goes  away to a neighbouring college. However willing and anxious to oblige,  it is evident that no one can use the library at the expense of the  time, if not temper, of two Fellows. Some similar restrictions are in  force at the Teylerian Museum, Haarlem, where a lifelong imprisonment is  inflicted upon its many treasures.    Some centuries ago a valuable collection of books was left to the  Guildford Endowed Grammar School. The schoolmaster was to be held  personally responsible for the safety of every volume, which, if lost,  he was bound to replace. I am told that one master, to minimize his risk  as much as possible, took the following barbarous course:--As soon as  he was in possession, he raised the boards of the schoolroom floor, and,  having carefully packed all the books between the joists, had the boards  nailed down again. Little recked he how many rats and mice made their  nests there; he was bound to account some day for every single volume,  and he saw no way so safe as rigid imprisonment.    The late Sir Thomas Phillipps, of Middle Hill, was a remarkable instance  of a bibliotaph. He bought bibliographical treasures simply to bury  them. His mansion was crammed with books; he purchased whole libraries,  and never even saw what he had bought. Among some of his purchases was  the first book printed in the English language, \"The Recuyell of the  Histories of Troye,\" translated and printed by William Caxton, for the  Duchess of Burgundy, sister to our Edward IV. It is true, though almost  incredible, that Sir Thomas could never find this volume, although it  is doubtless still in the collection, and no wonder, when cases of books  bought twenty years before his death were never opened, and the only  knowledge of their contents which he possessed was the Sale Catalogue or  the bookseller's invoice.        CHAPTER X. SERVANTS AND CHILDREN.    READER! are you married? Have you offspring, boys especially I mean, say  between six and twelve years of age? Have you also a literary workshop,  supplied with choice tools, some for use, some for ornament, where you  pass pleasant hours? and is--ah! there's the rub!--is there a special  hand-maid, whose special duty it is to keep your den daily dusted and  in order? Plead you guilty to these indictments? then am I sure of a  sympathetic co-sufferer.    Dust! it is all a delusion. It is not the dust that makes women anxious  to invade the inmost recesses of your Sanctum--it is an ingrained  curiosity. And this feminine weakness, which dates from Eve, is a common  motive in the stories of our oldest literature and Folk-lore. What made  Fatima so anxious to know the contents of the room forbidden her by  Bluebeard? It was positively nothing to her, and its contents caused not  the slightest annoyance to anybody. That story has a bad moral, and it  would, in many ways, have been more satisfactory had the heroine been  left to take her place in the blood-stained chamber, side by side with  her peccant predecessors. Why need the women-folk (God forgive me!)  bother themselves about the inside of a man's library, and whether  it wants dusting or not? My boys' playroom, in which is a carpenter's  bench, a lathe, and no end of litter, is never tidied--perhaps it can't  be, or perhaps their youthful vigour won't stand it--but my workroom  must needs be dusted daily, with the delusive promise that each book and  paper shall be replaced exactly where it was. The damage done by such  continued treatment is incalculable. At certain times these observances  are kept more religiously than others; but especially should the  book-lover, married or single, beware of the Ides of March. So soon as  February is dead and gone, a feeling of unrest seizes the housewife's  mind. This increases day by day, and becomes dominant towards the middle  of the month, about which period sundry hints are thrown out as to  whether you are likely to be absent for a day or two. Beware! the fever  called \"Spring Clean\" is on, and unless you stand firm, you will rue it.  Go away, if the Fates so will, but take the key of your own domain with  you.    Do not misunderstand. Not for a moment would I advocate dust and dirt;  they are enemies, and should be routed; but let the necessary routing be  done under your own eye. Explain where caution must be used, and in  what cases tenderness is a virtue; and if one Eve in the family can  be indoctrinated with book-reverence you are a happy man; her price is  above that of rubies; she will prolong your life. Books MUST now and  then be taken clean out of their shelves, but they should be tended  lovingly and with judgment. If the dusting can be done just outside the  room so much the better. The books removed, the shelf should be lifted  quite out of its bearings, cleansed and wiped, and then each volume  should be taken separately, and gently rubbed on back and sides with a  soft cloth. In returning the volumes to their places, notice should be  taken of the binding, and especially when the books are in whole calf  or morocco care should be taken not to let them rub together. The best  bound books are soonest injured, and quickly deteriorate in bad company.  Certain volumes, indeed, have evil tempers, and will scratch the faces  of all their neighbours who are too familiar with them. Such are books  with metal clasps and rivets on their edges; and such, again, are those  abominable old rascals, chiefly born in the fifteenth century, who are  proud of being dressed in REAL boards with brass corners, and pass their  lives with fearful knobs and metal bosses, mostly five in number, firmly  fixed on one of their sides. If the tendencies of such ruffians are not  curbed, they will do as much mischief to their gentle neighbours as when  a \"collie\" worries the sheep. These evil results may always be minimized  by placing a piece of millboard between the culprit and his victim. I  have seen lovely bindings sadly marked by such uncanny neighbours.    When your books are being \"dusted,\" don't impute too much common sense  to your assistants; take their ignorance for granted, and tell them at  once never to lift any book by one of its covers;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13029"],[0,"The Art of the Moving Picture (#12)"],[1,"round, a  representative of the crowd of prisoners. Nathan is photographed on the  wall as the particular defender of the town in whom we are most  interested.    The pictures of the crowd's normal activities avoid jerkiness and haste.  They do not abound in the boresome self-conscious quietude that some  producers have substituted for the usual twitching. Each actor in the  assemblies has a refreshing equipment in gentle gesticulation; for the  manners and customs of Bethulia must needs be different from those of  America. Though the population moves together as a river, each citizen is  quite preoccupied. To the furthest corner of the picture, they are  egotistical as human beings. The elder goes by, in theological  conversation with his friend. He thinks his theology is important. The  mother goes by, all absorbed in her child. To her it is the only child in  the world.    Alternated with these scenes is the terrible rush of the Assyrian army,  on to exploration, battle, and glory. The speed of their setting out  becomes actual, because it is contrasted with the deliberation of the  Jewish town. At length the Assyrians are along those hills and valleys  and below the wall of defence. The population is on top of the  battlements, beating them back the more desperately because they are  separated from the water-supply, the wells in the fields where once the  lovers met. In a lull in the siege, by a connivance of the elders, Judith  is let out of a little door in the wall. And while the fortune of her  people is most desperate she is shown in the quiet shelter of the tent of  Holofernes. Sinuous in grace, tranced, passionately in love, she has  forgotten her peculiar task. She is in a sense Bethulia itself, the race  of Israel made over into a woman, while Holofernes is the embodiment of  the besieging army. Though in a quiet tent, and on the terms of love, it  is the essential warfare of the hot Assyrian blood and the pure and  peculiar Jewish thoroughbredness.    Blanche Sweet as Judith is indeed dignified and ensnaring, the more so  because in her abandoned quarter of an hour the Jewish sanctity does not  leave her. And her aged woman attendant, coming in and out, sentinel and  conscience, with austere face and lifted finger, symbolizes the fire of  Israel that shall yet awaken within her. When her love for her city and  God finally becomes paramount, she shakes off the spell of the divine  honors which she has followed all the camp in according to that living  heathen deity Holofernes, and by the very transfiguration of her figure  and countenance we know that the deliverance of Israel is at hand. She  beheads the dark Assyrian. Soon she is back in the city, by way of the  little gate by which she emerged. The elders receive her and her bloody  trophy.    The people who have been dying of thirst arise in a final whirlwind of  courage. Bereft of their military genius, the Assyrians flee from the  burning camp. Naomi is delivered by her lover Nathan. This act is taken  by the audience as a type of the setting free of all the captives. Then  we have the final return of the citizens to their town. As for Judith,  hers is no crass triumph. She is shown in her gray and silvery room in  her former widow's dress, but not the same woman. There is thwarted love  in her face. The sword of sorrow is there. But there is also the prayer  of thanksgiving. She goes forth. She is hailed as her city's deliverer.  She stands among the nobles like a holy candle.    Providing the picture may be preserved in its original delicacy, it has  every chance to retain a place in the affections of the wise, if a humble  pioneer of criticism may speak his honest mind.    Though in this story the archaic flavor is well-preserved, the way the  producer has pictured the population at peace, in battle, in despair, in  victory gives me hope that he or men like unto him will illustrate the  American patriotic crowd-prophecies. We must have Whitmanesque scenarios,  based on moods akin to that of the poem By Blue Ontario's Shore. The  possibility of showing the entire American population its own face in the  Mirror Screen has at last come. Whitman brought the idea of democracy to  our sophisticated literati, but did not persuade the democracy itself to  read his democratic poems. Sooner or later the kinetoscope will do what  he could not, bring the nobler side of the equality idea to the people  who are so crassly equal.    The photoplay penetrates in our land to the haunts of the wildest or the  dullest. The isolated prospector rides twenty miles to see the same film  that is displayed on Broadway. There is not a civilized or half-civilized  land but may read the Whitmanesque message in time, if once it is put on  the films with power. Photoplay theatres are set up in ports where  sailors revel, in heathen towns where gentlemen adventurers are willing  to make one last throw with fate.    On the other hand, as a recorder Whitman approaches the wildest, rawest  American material and conquers it, at the same time keeping his nerves in  the state in which Swinburne wrote Only the Song of Secret Bird, or  Lanier composed The Ballad of Trees and The Master. J.W. Alexander's  portrait of Whitman in the Metropolitan Museum, New York, is not too  sophisticated. The out-of-door profoundness of this poet is far richer  than one will realize unless he has just returned from some cross-country  adventure afoot. Then if one reads breathlessly by the page and the score  of pages, there is a glory transcendent. For films of American  patriotism to parallel the splendors of Cabiria and Judith of Bethulia,  and to excel them, let us have Whitmanesque scenarios based on moods like  that of By Blue Ontario's Shore, The Salute au Monde, and The Passage to  India. Then the people's message will reach the people at last.    The average Crowd Picture will cling close to the streets that are, and  the usual Patriotic Picture will but remind us of nationality as it is at  present conceived and aflame, and the Religious Picture will for the most  part be close to the standard orthodoxies. The final forms of these merge  into each other, though they approach the heights by different avenues.  We Americans should look for the great photoplay of to-morrow, that will  mark a decade or a century, that prophesies of the flags made one, the  crowds in brotherhood.          CHAPTER VII    RELIGIOUS SPLENDOR      As far as the photoplay is concerned, religious emotion is a form of  crowd-emotion. In the most conventional and rigid church sense this phase  can be conveyed more adequately by the motion picture than by the stage.  There is little, of course, for the anti-ritualist in the art-world  anywhere. The thing that makes cathedrals real shrines in the eye of the  reverent traveller makes them, with their religious processions and the  like, impressive in splendor-films.    For instance, I have long remembered the essentials of the film, The  Death of Thomas Becket. It may not compare in technique with some of our  present moving picture achievements, but the idea must have been  particularly adapted to the film medium. The story has stayed in my mind  with great persistence, not only as a narrative, but as the first hint to  me that orthodox religious feeling has here an undeveloped field.    Green tells the story in this way, in his History of the English  People:--    \"Four knights of the King's court, stirred to outrage by a passionate  outburst of their master's wrath, crossed the sea and on the twenty-ninth  of December forced their way into the Archbishop's palace. After a stormy  parley with him in his chamber they withdrew to arm. Thomas was hurried  by his clerks into the cathedral, but as he reached the steps leading  from the transept into the choir his pursuers burst in from the  cloisters. 'Where,' cried Reginald Fitzurse, 'is the traitor, Thomas  Becket?' 'Here am I, no traitor, but a priest of God,' he replied. And  again descending the steps he placed himself with his back against a  pillar and fronted his foes.... The brutal murder was received with a  thrill of horror throughout Christendom. Miracles were wrought at the  martyr's tomb, etc....\"    It is one of the few deaths in moving pictures that have given me the  sense that I was watching a tragedy. Most of them affect one, if they  have any effect, like exhibits in an art gallery, as does Josef Israels'  oil painting, Alone in the World. We admire the technique, and as for  emotion, we feel the picturesqueness only. But here the church  procession, the robes, the candles, the vaulting overhead, the whole  visualized cathedral mood has the power over the reverent eye it has in  life, and a touch more.    It is not a private citizen who is struck down. Such a taking off would  have been but nominally impressive, no matter how well acted. Private  deaths in the films, to put it another way, are but narrative statements.  It is not easy to convey their spiritual significance. Take, for  instance, the death of John Goderic, in the film version of Gilbert  Parker's The Seats of the Mighty. The major leaves this world in the  first third of the story. The photoplay use of his death is, that he may  whisper in the ear of Robert Moray to keep certain letters of La  Pompadour well hidden. The fact that it is the desire of a dying man  gives sharpness to his request. Later in the story Moray is hard-pressed  by the villain for those same papers. Then the scene of the death is  flashed for an instant on the screen, representing the hero's memory of  the event. It is as though he should recollect and renew a solemn oath.  The documents are more important than John Goderic. His departure is but  one of their attributes. So it is in any film. There is no emotional  stimulation in the final departure of a non-public character to bring  tears, such tears as have been provoked by the novel or the stage over  the"]]]
