Friedrich's next most important move was to Paris (1802), where he  gave lectures on philosophy, and attempted another journal. Here he  began his enthusiastic studies of the Sanskrit language and  literature, which proved to have an important influence on the  development of modern philology. This is eminently true of his work  _On the Language and Wisdom of the Indians_ (1808). In 1804 he removed  to Cologne, where he entered with great eagerness into the work of  re-discovering the medieval Lower Rhenish School of religious art and  Gothic architecture. In 1808 he, with his wife Dorothea (the daughter  of Moses Mendelssohn, who years before this time had left her home and  family to become his partner for life), entered the Roman Catholic  church, the interests of which engaged much of his energies for the  remainder of his life.    [Illustration: #A HERMIT WATERING HORSES# MORITZ VON SCHWIND]    He lived most of the time in Vienna, partly engaged in the literary  service of the Austrian government, partly in lecturing on history and  literature. He died in 1829 in Dresden, whither he had gone to deliver  a course of lectures.    Friedrich Schlegel's philosophy of life was based upon the theory of  supremacy of the artist, the potency of poetry, with its incidental  corollaries of disregard for the Kantian ideal of Duty, and aversion  to all Puritanism and Protestantism. \"There is no great world but that  of artists,\" he declared in the _Athenaeum_; \"artists form a higher  caste; they should separate themselves, even in their way of living,  from other people.\" Poetry and philosophy formed in his thought an  inseparable unit, forever joined, \"though seldom together--like Castor  and Pollux.\" His interest is in \"Humanity,\" that is to say, a superior  type of the species, with a corresponding contempt for \"commonness,\"  especially for the common man as a mere machine of \"duty.\" On  performances he set no great store: \"Those countenances are most  interesting to me in which Nature seems to have indicated a great  design without taking time to carry it out.\"    August Wilhelm von Schlegel (1767-1845), more simply known as  \"Wilhelm,\" was the more balanced, dignified, and serene nature, and  possessed in a far higher degree than Friedrich the art of steering  his course smoothly through life. Of very great significance in his  training were his university years at Goettingen, and his acquaintance  there with the poet Buerger, that early apostle of revolt from a formal  literature, whose own life had become more and more discredited and  was destined to go out in wretchedness and ignominy; the latter's  fecundating activities had never been allowed full scope, but  something of his spirit of adventure into new literary fields was  doubtless caught by the younger man. Buerger's attempts at naturalizing  the sonnet, for instance, are interesting in view of the fact that  Wilhelm Schlegel became the actual creator of this literary form among  the Germans. Schlegel's own pursuits as a student were prevailingly  in the field of Hellenism, in which his acquisitions were astounding;  his influence was especially potent in giving a philological character  to much of the work of the Romanticists. In Goettingen he became  acquainted with one of the most gifted women which Germany has ever  produced, Caroline, the daughter of the Goettingen professor Michaelis,  at the time a young widow in the home of her father, and destined to  become not only his wife, but the Muse of much of his most important  work. This office she performed until the time of their unfortunate  separation.    After finishing his university studies, Wilhelm was for a while  private tutor in a wealthy family at Amsterdam, where conditions of  living were most agreeable, but where a suitable stimulus to the  inborn life of his mind was lacking. He accordingly gave up this  position and returned, with little but hopes, to Germany. Then came a  call which was both congenial and honorable. Schiller's attention had  been drawn, years before, to a review of his own profound  philosophical poem, _The Artists_, by an unknown young man, whom he at  once sought to secure as a regular contributor to his literary  journal, _The New Thalia_. Nothing came of this, chiefly because of  Schlegel's intimate relations to Buerger at the time. Schiller had  published, not long before, his annihilatory review of Buerger's poems,  which did so much to put that poet out of serious consideration for  the remainder of his days. In the meantime Schiller had addressed  himself to his crowning enterprise, the establishing of a literary  journal which should be the final dictator of taste and literary  criticism throughout the German-speaking world. In 1794 the plan for  _The Hours_ was realized under favorable auspices, and in the same  year occurred the death of Buerger. In 1796 Schiller invited Wilhelm to  become one of the regular staff of _The Hours_, and this invitation  Schlegel accepted, finding in it the opportunity to marry Caroline,  with whom he settled in Jena in July of that year. His first  contribution to _The Hours_ was a masterful and extended treatise on  _Dante_, which was accompanied by translations which were clearly the  most distinguished in that field which the German language had ever  been able to offer. Schlegel also furnished elaborated poems, somewhat  in Schiller's grand style, for the latter's _Almanac of the Muses_.  During the years of his residence at Jena (which continued until 1801)  Schlegel, with the incalculable assistance of his wife, published the  first eight volumes of those renderings of Shakespeare's plays into  German which doubtless stand at the very summit of the art of  transferring a poet to an alien region, and which have, in actual  fact, served to make the Bard of Avon as truly a fellow-citizen of the  Germans as of the Britons. Wilhelm's brother Friedrich had remained  but a year with him in Jena, before his removal to Berlin and his  establishment of the _Athenaeum_. Although separated from his brother,  Wilhelm's part in the conduct of the journal was almost as important  as Friedrich's, and, in effect, they conducted the whole significant  enterprise out of their own resources. The opening essay, _The  Languages_, is Wilhelm's, and properly, for at this time he was by far  the better versed in philological and literary matters. His cultural  acquisitions, his tremendous spoils of reading, were greater, and his  judgment more trustworthy. In all his work in the _Athenaeum_ he  presents a seasoned, many-sided sense of all poetical, phonetic and  musical values: rhythm, color, tone, the lightest breath and aroma of  an elusive work of art. One feels that Wilhelm overhauls the whole  business of criticism, and clears the field for coming literary  ideals. Especially telling is his demolition of Klopstock's violent  \"Northernism,\" to which he opposes a far wider philosophy of grammar  and style. The universality of poetry, as contrasted with a narrow  \"German\" clumsiness, is blandly defended, and a joyous abandon is  urged as something better than the meticulous anxiety of chauvinistic  partisanism. In all his many criticisms of literature there are charm,  wit, and elegance, an individuality and freedom in the reviewer, who,  if less penetrating than his brother, displays a far more genial  breadth and humanity, and more secure composure. His translations,  more masterly than those of Friedrich, carry out Herder's demand for  complete absorption and re-creation.    In 1801 Schlegel went to Berlin, where for three successive winters he  lectured on art and literature. His subsequent translations of  Calderon's plays (1803-1809) and of Romance lyrics served to  naturalize a large treasure of southern poetry upon German soil. In  1804, after having separated from his wife, he became attached to the  household of Madame de Stael, and traversed Europe with her. It is  through this association that she was enabled to write her brilliant  work, _On Germany_. In 1808 he delivered a series of lectures on  dramatic art and literature in Vienna, which enjoyed enormous  popularity, and are still reckoned the crowning achievement of his  career; perhaps the most significant of these is his discourse on  Shakespeare. In the first volume of the _Athenaeum_, Shakespeare's  universality had already been regarded as \"the central point of  romantic art.\" As Romanticist, it was Schlegel's office to portray the  independent development of the modern English stage, and to defend  Shakespeare against the familiar accusations of barbaric crudity and  formlessness. In surveying the field, it was likewise incumbent upon  him to demonstrate in what respects the classic drama differed from  the independently developed modern play, and his still useful  generalization regards antique art as limited, clear, simple, and  perfected--as typified by a work of sculpture; whereas romantic art  delights in mingling its subjects--as a painting, which embraces many  objects and looks out into the widest vistas. Apart from the clarity  and smoothness of these Vienna discourses, their lasting merit lies in  their searching observation of the import of dramatic works from their  inner soul, and in a most discriminating sense of the relation of all  their parts to an organic whole.    In 1818 Schlegel accepted a professorship at the University of Bonn,  in which place he exercised an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12083"],[0,"Eric; Or, Little (#12)"],[1,"ry, which gave them the privilege of sitting up later than  usual, and enjoying a more quiet and pleasant evening than was possible  in the noisy rooms. Boys and master were soon quite at home with each  other, and in this way Mr. Rose had an opportunity of instilling many a  useful warning without the formality of regular discipline or  stereotyped instruction.    Eric found the life of the \"boarders' room\" far rougher than he had  expected. Work was out of the question there, except during the hours of  preparation, and the long dark winter evenings were often dull enough.  Sometimes, indeed, they would all join in some regular indoor boys' game  like \"baste the bear,\" or \"high-cockolorum;\" or they would have amusing  \"ghost-hunts,\" as they called them, after some dressed-up boy among the  dark corridors and staircases. This was good enough fun, but at other  times they got tired of games, and could not get them up, and then  numbers of boys felt the idle time hang heavy on their hands. When this  was the case, some of the worse sort, as might have been expected, would  fill up their leisure with bullying or mischief.    For some time they had a form of diversion which disgusted and annoyed  Eric exceedingly. On each of the long iron-bound deal tables were placed  two or three tallow candles in tin candlesticks, and this was the only  light the boys had. Of course, these candles often, wanted snuffing, and  as snuffers were sure to be thrown about and broken as soon as they  were brought into the room, the only resource was to snuff them with the  fingers, at which all the boys became great adepts from necessity. One  evening Barker, having snuffed the candle, suddenly and slyly put the  smouldering wick unnoticed on the head of a little quiet inoffensive  fellow named Wright, who happened to be sitting next to him. It went on  smouldering for some time without Wright's perceiving it, and at last  Barker, highly delighted, exclaimed--    \"I see a chimney,\" and laughed.    Four or five boys looked up, and very soon every one in the room had  noticed the trick except little Wright himself, who unconsciously wrote  on at the letter he was sending home.    Eric did not like this; but not wishing to come across Barker again,  said nothing, and affected not to have observed. But Russell said  quietly, \"There's something on your head, Wright,\" and the little boy  putting up his hand, hastily brushed off the horrid wick.    \"What a shame!\" he said, as it fell on his letter, and made a smudge.    \"Who told you to interfere?\" said Barker, turning fiercely to Russell.  Russell, as usual, took not the slightest notice of him, and Barker,  after a little more bluster, repeated the trick on another boy. This  time Russell thought that every one might be on the look out for  himself, and so went on with his work. But when Barker again chanted  maliciously--    \"I see a chimney,\" every boy who happened to be reading or writing,  uneasily felt to discover this time he was himself the victim or no; and  so things continued for half an hour.    Ridiculous and disgusting as this folly was, it became, when constantly  repeated, very annoying. A boy could not sit down to any quiet work  without constant danger of having some one creep up behind him and put  the offensive fragment of smoking snuff on his head; and neither Barker  nor any of his little gang of imitators seemed disposed to give up their  low mischief.    One night, when the usual exclamation was made, Eric felt sure, from  seeing several boys looking at him, that this time some one had been  treating him in the same way. He indignantly shook his head, and sure  enough the bit of wick dropped off. Eric was furious, and springing up,  he shouted--    \"By Jove! I _won't_ stand this any longer.\"    \"You'll have to sit it then,\" said Barker.    \"O, it was _you_ who did it, was it? Then take that;\" and, seizing one  of the tin candlesticks, Eric hurled it at Barker's head. Barker dodged,  but the edge of it cut open his eyebrow as it whizzed by, and the blood  flowed fast.    \"I'll kill you for that,\" said Barker, leaping at Eric, and seizing him  by the hair.    \"You'll get killed yourself then, you brute,\" said Upton, Russell's  cousin, a fifth-form boy, who had just come into the room--and he boxed  his ears as a premonitory admonition. \"But, I say, young un,\" continued  he to Eric, \"this kind of thing won't do, you snow. You'll get into  rows if you shy candlesticks at fellows' heads at that rate.\"    \"He has been making the room intolerable for the last month by his  filthy tricks,\" said Eric hotly; \"some one must stop him, and I will  somehow, if no one else does.\"    \"It wasn't I who put the thing on your head, you passionate young fool,\"  growled Barker.    \"Who was it then? How was I to know? You began it.\"    \"You shut up, Barker,\" said Upton; \"I've heard of your ways before, and  when I catch you at your tricks, I'll teach you a lesson. Come up to my  study, Williams, if you like.\"    Upton was a fine sturdy fellow of eighteen, immensely popular in the  school for his prowess and good looks. He hated bullying, and often  interfered to protect little boys, who accordingly idolised him, and did  anything he told them very willingly. He meant to do no harm, but he did  great harm. He was full of misdirected impulses, and had a great notion  of being manly, which he thought consisted in a fearless disregard of  all school rules, and the performance of the wildest tricks. For this  reason he was never very intimate with his cousin Russell, whom he liked  very much, but who was too scrupulous and independent to please him.  Eric, on the other hand, was just the boy to take his fancy, and to  admire him in return; his life, strength, and pluck, made him a ready  pupil in all schemes of mischief, and Upton, who had often noticed him,  would have been the first to shudder had he known how far his example  went to undermine all Eric's lingering good resolutions, and ruin for  ever the boy of whom he was so fond.    From this time Eric was much in Upton's study, and constantly by his  side in the playground. In spite of their disparity in age and position  in the school, they became sworn friends, though, their friendship was  broken every now and then by little quarrels, which united them all the  more closely after they had not spoken to each other perhaps for a week.    \"Your cousin Upton has 'taken up' Williams,\" said Montagu to Russell one  afternoon, as he saw the two strolling together on the beach, with  Eric's arm in Upton's.    \"Yes, I am sorry for it.\"    \"So am I. We shan't see so much of him now.\"    \"O, that's not my only reason,\" answered Russell, who had a rare habit  of always going straight to the point.    \"You mean you don't like the 'taking-up' system.\"    \"No, Montagu; I used once to have fine theories about it. I used to  fancy that a big fellow would do no end of good to one lower in the  school, and that the two would stand to each other in the relation of  knight to squire. You know what the young knights were taught, Monty--to  keep their bodies under, and bring them into subjection; to love God,  and speak the truth always. That sounds very grand and noble to me. But  when a big fellow takes up a little one _you_ know pretty well that  _those_ are not the kind of lessons he teaches.\"    \"No, Russell; you're quite right. It's bad for a fellow in every way.  First of all, it keeps him in an unnatural sort of dependence; then ten  to one it makes him conceited, and prevents his character from really  coming out well. And besides, the young chap generally gets paid out in  kicks and abuse from the jealousy and contempt of the rest; and if his  protector happens to leave, or anything of that kind, woe betide him!\"    \"No fear for Eric in that line, though,\" said Russell; \"he can hold his  own pretty well against any one. And after all, he is a most jolly  fellow. I don't think even Upton will spoil him; it's chiefly the soft  self-indulgent fellows, who are all straw and no iron, who get spoilt by  being 'taken up.'\"    Russell was partly right. Eric learnt a great deal of harm from Upton,  and the misapplied hero-worship led to bad results. But he was too manly  a little fellow, and had too much self-respect, to sink into the  effeminate condition which usually grows on the young delectables who  have the misfortune to be \"taken up.\"    Nor did he in the least drop his old friends, except Owen. A coolness  grew up between the latter and Eric, not unmingled with a little mutual  contempt. Eric sneered at Owen as a fellow who did nothing but grind all  day long, and had no geniality in him; while Owen pitied the love of  popularity which so often led Eric into delinquencies, which he himself  despised. Owen had, indeed, but few friends in the school; the only boy  who knew him well enough to respect and like him thoroughly was Russell,  who found in him the only one who took the same high, ground with  himself. But Russell loved the good in every one, and was loved by all  in return, and Eric he loved most of all, while he often mourned over  his increasing failures.    One day as the two were walking together in the green playground, Mr.  Gordon passed by; and as the boys touched their caps, he nodded and  smiled pleasantly at Russell, but hardly noticed, and did not return  Eric's salute. He had begun to dislike the latter more and more, and had  given him up altogether as one of the reprobates.    \"What a surly devil that is,\" said Eric, when he had passed; \"did you  see how he purposely cut me?\"    \"A surly ...? Oh Eric, that's the first time I ever heard you swear.\"    Eric blushed. He hadn't meant the word to slip out in Russell's hearing,  though similar expressions were common enough in his talk with other  boys. But he didn't like to be reproved, even by Russell, and in the  ready spirit of self-defence, he answered--    \"Pooh, Edwin, you"]]]
