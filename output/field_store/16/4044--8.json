Else thou  wilt be a slave amid slaves, wert thou ten thousand times a consul; aye,  not a whit the less, though thou climb the Palace steps. And thou  shalt know how true the saying of Cleanthes, that though the words of  philosophers may run counter to the opinions of the world, yet have they  reason on their side.          CXLIII    Asked how a man should best grieve his enemy, Epictetus replied, \"By  setting himself to live the noblest life himself.\"          CXLIV    I am free, I am a friend of God, ready to render Him willing obedience.  Of all else I may set store by nothing--neither by mine own body, nor  possessions, nor office, nor good report, nor, in a word, aught else  beside. For it is not His Will, that I should so set store by these  things. Had it been His pleasure, He would have placed my Good therein.  But now He hath not done so: therefore I cannot transgress one jot of  His commands. In everything hold fast to that which is thy Good--but to  all else (as far as is given thee) within the measure of Reason only,  contented with this alone. Else thou wilt meet with failure, ill  success, let and hindrance. These are the Laws ordained of God--these  are His Edicts; these a man should expound and interpret; to these  submit himself, not to the laws of Masurius and Cassius.          CXLV    Remember that not the love of power and wealth sets us under the heel  of others, but even the love of tranquillity, of leisure, of change of  scene--of learning in general, it matters not what the outward thing  may be--to set store by it is to place thyself in subjection to another.  Where is the difference then between desiring to be a Senator, and  desiring not to be one: between thirsting for office and thirsting to  be quit of it? Where is the difference between crying, Woe is me, I know  not what to do, bound hand and foot as I am to my books so that I cannot  stir! and crying, Woe is me, I have not time to read! As though a book  were not as much an outward thing and independent of the will, as office  and power and the receptions of the great.    Or what reason hast thou (tell me) for desiring to read? For if thou  aim at nothing beyond the mere delight of it, or gaining some scrap of  knowledge, thou art but a poor, spiritless knave. But if thou desirest  to study to its proper end, what else is this than a life that flows on  tranquil and serene? And if thy reading secures thee not serenity, what  profits it?--\"Nay, but it doth secure it,\" quoth he, \"and that is why I  repine at being deprived of it.\"--And what serenity is this that lies at  the mercy of every passer-by? I say not at the mercy of the Emperor or  Emperor's favorite, but such as trembles at a raven's croak and piper's  din, a fever's touch or a thousand things of like sort! Whereas the  life serene has no more certain mark than this, that it ever moves with  constant unimpeded flow.          CXLVI    If thou hast put malice and evil speaking from thee, altogether, or  in some degree: if thou hast put away from thee rashness, foulness of  tongue, intemperance, sluggishness: if thou art not moved by what once  moved thee, or in like manner as thou once wert moved--then thou mayest  celebrate a daily festival, to-day because thou hast done well in this  manner, to-morrow in that. How much greater cause is here for offering  sacrifice, than if a man should become Consul or Prefect?          CXLVII    These things hast thou from thyself and from the Gods: only remember who  it is that giveth them--to whom and for what purpose they were given.  Feeding thy soul on thoughts like these, dost thou debate in what place  happiness awaits thee? in what place thou shalt do God's pleasure?  Are not the Gods nigh unto all places alike; see they not alike what  everywhere comes to pass?          CXLVIII    To each man God hath granted this inward freedom. These are the  principles that in a house create love, in a city concord, among nations  peace, teaching a man gratitude towards God and cheerful confidence,  wherever he may be, in dealing with outward things that he knows are  neither his nor worth striving after.          CXLIX    If you seek Truth, you will not seek to gain a victory by every possible  means; and when you have found Truth, you need not fear being defeated.          CL    What foolish talk is this? how can I any longer lay claim to right  principles, if I am not content with being what I am, but am all  aflutter about what I am supposed to be?          CLI    God hath made all things in the world, nay, the world itself, free from  hindrance and perfect, and its parts for the use of the whole. No other  creature is capable of comprehending His administration thereof; but the  reasonable being Man possesses faculties for the consideration of all  these things--not only that he is himself a part, but what part he is,  and how it is meet that the parts should give place to the whole. Nor is  this all. Being naturally constituted noble, magnanimous, and free, he  sees that the things which surround him are of two kinds. Some are  free from hindrance and in the power of the will. Other are subject to  hindrance, and depend on the will of other men. If then he place his own  good, his own best interest, only in that which is free from hindrance  and in his power, he will be free, tranquil, happy, unharmed,  noble-hearted, and pious; giving thanks to all things unto God,  finding fault with nothing that comes to pass, laying no charge against  anything. Whereas if he place his good in outward things, depending not  on the will, he must perforce be subject to hindrance and restraint, the  slave of those that have power over the things he desires and fears;  he must perforce be impious, as deeming himself injured at the hands  of God; he must be unjust, as ever prone to claim more than his due; he  must perforce be of a mean and abject spirit.          CLII    Whom then shall I fear? the lords of the Bedchamber, lest they should  shut me out? If they find me desirous of entering in, let them shut me  out, if they will.    \"Then why comest thou to the door?\"    Because I think it meet and right, so long as the Play lasts, to take  part therein.    \"In what sense art thou then shut out?\"    Because, unless I am admitted, it is not my will to enter: on the  contrary, my will is simply that which comes to pass. For I esteem what  God wills better than what I will. To Him will I cleave as His minister  and attendant; having the same movements, the same desires, in a word  the same Will as He. There is no such thing as being shut out for me,  but only for them that would force their way in.          CLIII    But what says Socrates?--\"One man finds pleasure in improving his land,  another his horses. My pleasure lies in seeing that I myself grow better  day by day.\"          CLIV    The dress is suited to the craft; the craftsman takes his name from  the craft, not from the dress. For this reason Euphrates was right in  saying, \"I long endeavoured to conceal my following the philosophic  life; and this profited me much. In the first place, I knew that what I  did aright, I did not for the sake of lookers-on, but for my own. I  ate aright--unto myself; I kept the even tenor of my walk, my glance  composed and serene--all unto myself and unto God. Then as I fought  alone, I was alone in peril. If I did anything amiss or shameful,  the cause of Philosophy was not in me endangered; nor did I wrong the  multitude by transgressing as a professed philosopher. Wherefore those  that knew not my purpose marvelled how it came about, that whilst all my  life and conversation was passed with philosophers without exception, I  was yet none myself. And what harm that the philosopher should be known  by his acts, instead of mere outward signs and symbols?\"          CLV    First study to conceal what thou art; seek wisdom a little while unto  thyself. Thus grows the fruit; first, the seed must be buried in the  earth for a little space; there it must be hid and slowly grow, that it  may reach maturity. But if it produce the ear before the jointed stalk,  it is imperfect--a thing from the garden of Adonis. Such a sorry growth  art thou; thou hast blossomed too soon: the winter cold will wither thee  away!          CLVI    First of all, condemn the life thou art now leading: but when thou  hast condemned it, do not despair of thyself--be not like them of mean  spirit, who once they have yielded, abandon themselves entirely and  as it were allow the torrent to sweep them away. No; learn what the  wrestling masters do. Has the boy fallen? \"Rise,\" they say, \"wrestle  again, till thy strength come to thee.\" Even thus should it be with  thee. For know that there is nothing more tractable than the human soul.  It needs but to will, and the thing is done; the soul is set upon the  right path: as on the contrary it needs but to nod over the task, and  all is lost. For ruin and recovery alike are from within.          CLVII    It is the critical moment that shows the man. So when the crisis is upon  you, remember that God, like a trainer of wrestlers, has matched you  with a rough and stalwart antagonist.--\"To what end?\" you ask. That you  may prove the victor at the Great Games. Yet without toil and sweat this  may not be!          CLVIII    If thou wouldst make progress, be content to seem foolish and void of  understanding with respect to outward things. Care not to be thought to  know anything. If any should make account of thee, distrust thyself.          CLIX    Remember that in life thou shouldst order thy conduct as at a banquet.  Has any dish that is being served reached thee? Stretch forth thy hand  and help thyself modestly. Doth it pass thee by? Seek not to detain  it. Has it not yet come?

Aubrey is certain it was  that horrible book-maker's men who did it, but of course he can prove  nothing. But his last words to me were, 'Slip it into Percy again this  week.' He has given me one or two things to mention. I don't understand  them, but Aubrey says they will make him wild.\"    Roland's flesh crept. The idea of making Mr. Pook any wilder than he  appeared to be at present horrified him. Panic gave him strength, and  he addressed Miss March, who was looking more like a modern Joan of Arc  than anything else on earth, firmly.    \"Miss March,\" he said, \"I realize that this is a crisis, and that we  must all do all that we can for the paper, and I am ready to do anything  in reason--but I will not slip it into Percy. You have seen the effects  of slipping it into Percy. What he or his minions will do if we repeat  the process I do not care to think.\"    \"You are afraid?\"    \"Yes,\" said Roland simply.    Miss March turned on her heel. It was plain that she regarded him as a  worm. Roland did not like being thought a worm, but it was infinitely  better than being regarded as an interesting case by the house-surgeon  of a hospital. He belonged to the school of thought which holds that it  is better that people should say of you, \"There he goes!\" than that they  should say, \"How peaceful he looks\".    Stress of work prevented further conversation. It was a revelation to  Roland, the vigor and energy with which Miss March threw herself into  the breach. As a matter of fact, so tremendous had been the labors of  the departed Mr. Petheram, that her work was more apparent than real.  Thanks to Mr. Petheram, there was a sufficient supply of material in  hand to enable 'Squibs' to run a fortnight on its own momentum. Roland,  however, did not know this, and with a view to doing what little he  could to help, he informed Miss March that he would write the Scandal  Page. It must be added that the offer was due quite as much to prudence  as to chivalry. Roland simply did not dare to trust her with the Scandal  Page. In her present mood it was not safe. To slip it into Percy would,  he felt, be with her the work of a moment.           *       *       *       *       *    Literary composition had never been Roland's forte. He sat and stared at  the white paper and chewed the pencil which should have been marring its  whiteness with stinging paragraphs. No sort of idea came to him.    His brow grew damp. What sort of people--except book-makers--did things  you could write scandal about? As far as he could ascertain, nobody.    He picked up the morning paper. The name Windlebird [*] caught his eye.  A kind of pleasant melancholy came over him as he read the paragraph.  How long ago it seemed since he had met that genial financier. The  paragraph was not particularly interesting. It gave a brief account of  some large deal which Mr. Windlebird was negotiating. Roland did not  understand a word of it, but it gave him an idea.    [*] He is a character in the Second Episode, a fraudulent financier.    Mr. Windlebird's financial standing, he knew, was above suspicion. Mr.  Windlebird had made that clear to him during his visit. There could be  no possibility of offending Mr. Windlebird by a paragraph or two about  the manners and customs of financiers. Phrases which his kindly host had  used during his visit came back to him, and with them inspiration.    Within five minutes he had compiled the following        WE JUST WANT TO KNOW, YOU KNOW        WHO is the eminent financier at present engaged upon one of his      biggest deals?        WHETHER the public would not be well-advised to look a little      closer into it before investing their money?        IF it is not a fact that this gentleman has bought a first-class      ticket to the Argentine in case of accidents?        WHETHER he may not have to use it at any moment?    After that it was easy. Ideas came with a rush. By the end of an hour  he had completed a Scandal Page of which Mr. Petheram himself might have  been proud, without a suggestion of slipping it into Percy. He felt that  he could go to Mr. Pook, and say, \"Percy, on your honor as a British  book-maker, have I slipped it into you in any way whatsoever?\" And Mr.  Pook would be compelled to reply, \"You have not.\"    Miss March read the proofs of the page, and sniffed. But Miss March's  blood was up, and she would have sniffed at anything not directly  hostile to Mr. Pook.           *       *       *       *       *    A week later Roland sat in the office of 'Squibs,' reading a letter. It  had been sent from No. 18-A Bream's Buildings, E.C., but, from Roland's  point of view, it might have come direct from heaven; for its contents,  signed by Harrison, Harrison, Harrison & Harrison, Solicitors, were to  the effect that a client of theirs had instructed them to approach him  with a view to purchasing the paper. He would not find their client  disposed to haggle over terms, so, hoped Messrs. Harrison, Harrison,  Harrison & Harrison, in the event of Roland being willing to sell, they  could speedily bring matters to a satisfactory conclusion.    Any conclusion which had left him free of 'Squibs' without actual  pecuniary loss would have been satisfactory to Roland. He had conceived  a loathing for his property which not even its steadily increasing sales  could mitigate. He was around at Messrs. Harrison's office as soon as a  swift taxi could take him there. The lawyers were for spinning the thing  out with guarded remarks and cautious preambles, but Roland's methods of  doing business were always rapid.    \"This chap,\" he said, \"this fellow who wants to buy 'Squibs,' what'll he  give?\"    \"That,\" began one of the Harrisons ponderously, \"would, of course,  largely depend----\"    \"I'll take five thousand. Lock, stock, and barrel, including the present  staff, an even five thousand. How's that?\"    \"Five thousand is a large----\"    \"Take it or leave it.\"    \"My dear sir, you hold a pistol to our heads. However, I think that our  client might consent to the sum you mention.\"    \"Good. Well, directly I get his check, the thing's his. By the way, who  is your client?\"    Mr. Harrison coughed.    \"His name,\" he said, \"will be familiar to you. He is the eminent  financier, Mr. Geoffrey Windlebird.\"            THE DIVERTING EPISODE OF THE EXILED MONARCH    Fifth of a Series of Six Stories [First published in _Pictorial Review_,  September 1916]      The caoutchouc was drawing all London. Slightly more indecent than the  Salome dance, a shade less reticent than ragtime, it had driven the  tango out of existence. Nor, indeed, did anybody actually caoutchouc,  for the national dance of Paranoya contained three hundred and  fifteen recognized steps; but everybody tried to. A new revue, \"Hullo,  Caoutchouc,\" had been produced with success. And the pioneer of the  dance, the peerless Maraquita, a native Paranoyan, still performed it  nightly at the music-hall where she had first broken loose.    The caoutchouc fascinated Roland Bleke. Maraquita fascinated him more.  Of all the women to whom he had lost his heart at first sight, Maraquita  had made the firmest impression upon him. She was what is sometimes  called a fine woman.    She had large, flashing eyes, the physique of a Rugby International  forward, and the agility of a cat on hot bricks.    There is a period of about fifty steps somewhere in the middle of the  three hundred and fifteen where the patient, abandoning the comparative  decorum of the earlier movements, whizzes about till she looks like a  salmon-colored whirlwind.    That was the bit that hit Roland.    Night after night he sat in his stage-box, goggling at Maraquita and  applauding wildly.    One night an attendant came to his box.    \"Excuse me, sir, but are you Mr. Roland Bleke? The Senorita Maraquita  wishes to speak to you.\"    He held open the door of the box. The possibility of refusal did not  appear to occur to him. Behind the scenes at that theater, it was  generally recognized that when the Peerless One wanted a thing, she got  it--quick.    They were alone.    With no protective footlights between himself and her, Roland came to  the conclusion that he had made a mistake. It was not that she was any  less beautiful at the very close quarters imposed by the limits of  the dressing-room; but he felt that in falling in love with her he had  undertaken a contract a little too large for one of his quiet, diffident  nature. It crossed his mind that the sort of woman he really liked was  the rather small, drooping type. Dynamite would not have made Maraquita  droop.    For perhaps a minute and a half Maraquita fixed her compelling eyes on  his without uttering a word. Then she broke a painful silence with this  leading question:    \"You love me, _hein_?\"    Roland nodded feebly.    \"When men make love to me, I send them away--so.\"    She waved her hand toward the door, and Roland began to feel almost  cheerful again. He was to be dismissed with a caution, after all. The  woman had a fine, forgiving nature.    \"But not you.\"    \"Not me?\"    \"No, not you. You are the man I have been waiting for. I read about you  in the paper, Senor Bleke. I see your picture in the 'Daily Mirror!' I  say to myself, 'What a man!'\"    \"Those picture-paper photographs always make one look rather weird,\"  mumbled Roland.    \"I see you night after night in your box. Poof! I love you.\"    \"Thanks awfully,\" bleated Roland.    \"You would do anything for my sake, _hein_? I knew you were that kind  of man directly I see you. No,\" she added, as Roland writhed uneasily  in his "]]]
