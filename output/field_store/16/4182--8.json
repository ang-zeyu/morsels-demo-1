This is an art unborn, though quickening in the womb of the  future. The things that reflect light have been organized aesthetically  into the arts of architecture, painting, and sculpture, but light  itself has never been thus organized.    And yet the scientific development and control of light has reached a  stage which makes this new art possible. It awaits only the advent of  the creative artist. The manipulation of light is now in the hands  of the illuminating engineers and its exploitation (in other than  necessary ways) in the hands of the advertisers.    Some results of their collaboration are seen in the sky signs of upper  Broadway, in New York, and of the lake front, in Chicago. A carnival  of contending vulgarities, showing no artistry other than the most  puerile, these displays nevertheless yield an effect of amazing  beauty. This is on account of an occult property inherent in the  nature of light--_it cannot be vulgarized_. If the manipulation of  light were delivered into the hands of the artist, and dedicated  to noble ends, it is impossible to overestimate the augmentation of  beauty that would ensue.    For light is a far more potent medium than sound. The sphere of sound  is the earth-sphere; the little limits of our atmosphere mark the  uttermost boundaries to which sound, even the most strident can  possibly prevail. But the medium of light is the ether, which links  us with the most distant stars. May not this serve as a symbol of the  potency of light to usher the human spirit into realms of being at the  doors of which music itself shall beat in vain? Or if we compare the  universe accessible to sight with that accessible to sound--the  plight of the blind in contrast to that of the deaf--there is the same  discrepancy; the field of the eye is immensely richer, more various  and more interesting than that of the ear.    The difficulty appears to consist in the inferior impressionability  of the eye to its particular order of beauty. To the average man  color--as color--has nothing significant to say: to him grass is  green, snow is white, the sky blue; and to have his attention drawn to  the fact that sometimes grass is yellow, snow blue, and the sky green,  is disconcerting rather than illuminating. It is only when his retina  is assaulted by some splendid sunset or sky-encircling rainbow that  he is able to disassociate the idea of color from that of form and  substance. Even the artist is at a disadvantage in this respect, when  compared with the musician. Nothing in color knowledge and analysis  analogous to the established laws of musical harmony is part of the  equipment of the average artist; he plays, as it were, by ear. The  scientist, on the other hand, though he may know the spectrum from  end to end, and its innumerable modifications, values this \"rainbow  promise of the Lord\" not for its own beautiful sake but as a means  to other ends than those of beauty. But just as the art of music  has developed the ear into a fine and sensitive instrument of  appreciation, so an analogous art of light would educate the eye to  nuances of color to which it is now blind.    [Illustration: PLATE XIV. SONG AND LIGHT: AN APPROACH TOWARD \"COLOR  MUSIC\"]    It is interesting to speculate as to the particular form in which this  new art will manifest itself. The question is perhaps already answered  in the \"color organ,\" the earliest of which was Bambridge Bishop's,  exhibited at the old Barnum's Museum--before the days of electric  light--and the latest A.W. Rimington's. Both of these instruments were  built upon a supposed correspondence between a given scale of colors,  and the musical chromatic scale; they were played from a musical score  upon an organ keyboard. This is sufficiently easy and sufficiently  obvious, and has been done, with varying success in one way or  another, time and again, but its very ease and obviousness should give  us pause.    It may well be questioned whether any arbitrary and literal  translation, even though practicable, of a highly complex, intensely  mobile art, unfolding in time, as does music, into a correspondent  light and color expression, is the best approach to a new art of  mobile color. There is a deep and abiding conviction, justified by the  history of aesthetics, that each art-form must progress from its  own beginnings and unfold in its own unique and characteristic way.  Correspondences between the arts--such a correspondence, for  example, as inspired the famous saying that architecture is frozen  music--reveal themselves usually only after the sister arts have  attained an independent maturity. They owe their origin to that  underlying unity upon which our various modes of sensuous perception  act as a refracting medium, and must therefore be taken for granted.  Each art, like each individual, is unique and singular; in this  singularity dwells its most thrilling appeal. We are likely to miss  light's crowning glory, and the rainbow's most moving message to the  soul if we preoccupy ourselves too exclusively with the identities  existing between music and color; it is rather their points of  difference which should first be dwelt upon.    Let us accordingly consider the characteristic differences between  the two sense-categories to which sound and light--music and  color--respectively belong. This resolves itself into a comparison  between time and space. The characteristic thing about time is  succession--hence the very idea of music, which is in time, involves  perpetual change. The characteristic of space, on the other hand, is  simultaneousness--in space alone perpetual immobility would reign.  That is why architecture, which is pre-eminently the art of space, is  of all the arts the most static. Light and color are essentially  of space, and therefore an art of mobile colour should never lack a  certain serenity and repose. A \"tune\" played on a color organ is only  distressing. If there is a workable correspondence between the musical  art and an art of mobile color, it will be found in the domain of  harmony which involves the idea of simultaneity, rather than in  melody, which is pure succession. This fundamental difference between  time and space cannot be over-emphasized. A musical note prolonged,  becomes at last scarcely tolerable; while a beautiful color, like the  blue of the sky, we can enjoy all day and every day. The changing hues  of a sunset, are _andante_ if referred to a musical standard, but to  the eye they are _allegretto_--we would have them pass less swiftly  than they do. The winking, chasing, changing lights of illuminated  sky-signs are only annoying, and for the same reason. The eye longs  for repose in some serene radiance or stately sequence, while the ear  delights in contrast and continual change. It may be that as the eye  becomes more educated it will demand more movement and complexity, but  a certain stillness and serenity are of the very nature of light,  as movement and passion are of the very nature of sound. Music is a  seeking--\"love in search of a word\"; light is a finding--a \"divine  covenant.\"    With attention still focussed on the differences rather than the  similarities between the musical art and a new art of mobile color,  we come next to the consideration of the matter of form. Now form  is essentially of space: we speak about the \"form\" of a musical  composition, but it is in a more or less figurative and metaphysical  sense, not as a thing concrete and palpable, like the forms of space.  It would be foolish to forego the advantage of linking up form with  colour, as there is opportunity to do. Here is another golden ball to  juggle with, one which no art purely in time affords. Of course it is  known that musical sounds weave invisible patterns in the air, and to  render these patterns perceptible to the eye may be one of the more  remote and recondite achievements of our uncreated art. Meantime,  though we have the whole treasury of natural forms to draw from, of  these we can only properly employ such as are _abstract_. The reason  for this is clear to any one who conceives of an art of mobile color,  not as a moving picture show--a thing of quick-passing concrete  images, to shock, to startle, or to charm--but as a rich and various  language in which light, proverbially the symbol of the spirit, is  made to speak, through the senses, some healing message to the soul.  For such a consummation, \"devoutly to be wished,\" natural forms--forms  abounding in every kind of association with that world of materiality  from which we would escape--are out of place; recourse must be had  rather to abstract forms, that is, geometrical figures. And because  the more remote these are from the things of sense, from knowledge and  experience, the projected figures of four-dimensional geometry would  lend themselves to these uses with an especial grace. Color without  form is as a soul without a body; yet the body of light must be  without any taint of materiality. Four-dimensional forms are as  immaterial as anything that could be imagined and they could be made  to serve the useful purpose of separating colors one from another,  as lead lines do in old cathedral windows, than which nothing more  beautiful has ever been devised.    Coming now to the consideration, not of differences, but similarities,  it is clear that a correspondence can be established between the  colors of the spectrum and the notes of a musical scale. That is,  the spectrum, considered as the analogue of a musical octave can  be subdivided into twelve colors which may be representative of  the musical chromatic scale of twelve semi-tones: the very word,  _chromatic_, being suggestive of such a correspondence between sound  and light. The red end of the spectrum would "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12629"],[0,"Language: An Introduction to the Study of Speech (#12)"],[1,"pitch differences which are  inseparable from the actual practice of language may not affect the word  as such, but, as in English, may be a more or less random or, at best,  but a rhetorical phenomenon, while in other languages, as in Swedish,  Lithuanian, Chinese, Siamese, and the majority of African languages,  they may be more finely graduated and felt as integral characteristics  of the words themselves. Varying methods of syllabifying are also  responsible for noteworthy acoustic differences. Most important of all,  perhaps, are the very different possibilities of combining the phonetic  elements. Each language has its peculiarities. The _ts_ combination, for  instance, is found in both English and German, but in English it can  only occur at the end of a word (as in _hats_), while it occurs freely  in German as the psychological equivalent of a single sound (as in  _Zeit_, _Katze_). Some languages allow of great heapings of consonants  or of vocalic groups (diphthongs), in others no two consonants or no two  vowels may ever come together. Frequently a sound occurs only in a  special position or under special phonetic circumstances. In English,  for instance, the _z_-sound of _azure_ cannot occur initially, while the  peculiar quality of the _t_ of _sting_ is dependent on its being  preceded by the _s_. These dynamic factors, in their totality, are as  important for the proper understanding of the phonetic genius of a  language as the sound system itself, often far more so.    We have already seen, in an incidental way, that phonetic elements or  such dynamic features as quantity and stress have varying psychological  \"values.\" The English _ts_ of _fiats_ is merely a _t_ followed by a  functionally independent _s_, the _ts_ of the German word _Zeit_ has an  integral value equivalent, say, to the _t_ of the English word _tide_.  Again, the _t_ of _time_ is indeed noticeably distinct from that of  _sting_, but the difference, to the consciousness of an English-speaking  person, is quite irrelevant. It has no \"value.\" If we compare the  _t_-sounds of Haida, the Indian language spoken in the Queen Charlotte  Islands, we find that precisely the same difference of articulation has  a real value. In such a word as _sting_ \"two,\" the _t_ is pronounced  precisely as in English, but in _sta_ \"from\" the _t_ is clearly  \"aspirated,\" like that of _time_. In other words, an objective  difference that is irrelevant in English is of functional value in  Haida; from its own psychological standpoint the _t_ of _sting_ is as  different from that of _sta_ as, from our standpoint, is the _t_ of  _time_ from the _d_ of _divine_. Further investigation would yield the  interesting result that the Haida ear finds the difference between the  English _t_ of _sting_ and the _d_ of _divine_ as irrelevant as the  naive English ear finds that of the _t_-sounds of _sting_ and _time_.  The objective comparison of sounds in two or more languages is, then, of  no psychological or historical significance unless these sounds are  first \"weighted,\" unless their phonetic \"values\" are determined. These  values, in turn, flow from the general behavior and functioning of the  sounds in actual speech.    These considerations as to phonetic value lead to an important  conception. Back of the purely objective system of sounds that is  peculiar to a language and which can be arrived at only by a painstaking  phonetic analysis, there is a more restricted \"inner\" or \"ideal\" system  which, while perhaps equally unconscious as a system to the naive  speaker, can far more readily than the other be brought to his  consciousness as a finished pattern, a psychological mechanism. The  inner sound-system, overlaid though it may be by the mechanical or the  irrelevant, is a real and an immensely important principle in the life  of a language. It may persist as a pattern, involving number, relation,  and functioning of phonetic elements, long after its phonetic content is  changed. Two historically related languages or dialects may not have a  sound in common, but their ideal sound-systems may be identical  patterns. I would not for a moment wish to imply that this pattern may  not change. It may shrink or expand or change its functional  complexion, but its rate of change is infinitely less rapid than that of  the sounds as such. Every language, then, is characterized as much by  its ideal system of sounds and by the underlying phonetic pattern  (system, one might term it, of symbolic atoms) as by a definite  grammatical structure. Both the phonetic and conceptual structures show  the instinctive feeling of language for form.[25]    [Footnote 25: The conception of the ideal phonetic system, the phonetic  pattern, of a language is not as well understood by linguistic students  as it should be. In this respect the unschooled recorder of language,  provided he has a good ear and a genuine instinct for language, is often  at a great advantage as compared with the minute phonetician, who is apt  to be swamped by his mass of observations. I have already employed my  experience in teaching Indians to write their own language for its  testing value in another connection. It yields equally valuable evidence  here. I found that it was difficult or impossible to teach an Indian to  make phonetic distinctions that did not correspond to \"points in the  pattern of his language,\" however these differences might strike our  objective ear, but that subtle, barely audible, phonetic differences, if  only they hit the \"points in the pattern,\" were easily and voluntarily  expressed in writing. In watching my Nootka interpreter write his  language, I often had the curious feeling that he was transcribing an  ideal flow of phonetic elements which he heard, inadequately from a  purely objective standpoint, as the intention of the actual rumble of  speech.]          IV    FORM IN LANGUAGE: GRAMMATICAL PROCESSES      The question of form in language presents itself under two aspects. We  may either consider the formal methods employed by a language, its  \"grammatical processes,\" or we may ascertain the distribution of  concepts with reference to formal expression. What are the formal  patterns of the language? And what types of concepts make up the content  of these formal patterns? The two points of view are quite distinct. The  English word _unthinkingly_ is, broadly speaking, formally parallel to  the word _reformers_, each being built up on a radical element which may  occur as an independent verb (_think_, _form_), this radical element  being preceded by an element (_un-_, _re-_) that conveys a definite and  fairly concrete significance but that cannot be used independently, and  followed by two elements (_-ing_, _-ly_; _-er_, _-s_) that limit the  application of the radical concept in a relational sense. This formal  pattern--(b) + A + (c) + (d)[26]--is a characteristic feature of the  language. A countless number of functions may be expressed by it; in  other words, all the possible ideas conveyed by such prefixed and  suffixed elements, while tending to fall into minor groups, do not  necessarily form natural, functional systems. There is no logical  reason, for instance, why the numeral function of _-s_ should be  formally expressed in a manner that is analogous to the expression of  the idea conveyed by _-ly_. It is perfectly conceivable that in another  language the concept of manner (_-ly_) may be treated according to an  entirely different pattern from that of plurality. The former might have  to be expressed by an independent word (say, _thus unthinking_), the  latter by a prefixed element (say, _plural[27]-reform-er_). There are,  of course, an unlimited number of other possibilities. Even within the  confines of English alone the relative independence of form and function  can be made obvious. Thus, the negative idea conveyed by _un-_ can be  just as adequately expressed by a suffixed element (_-less_) in such a  word as _thoughtlessly_. Such a twofold formal expression of the  negative function would be inconceivable in certain languages, say  Eskimo, where a suffixed element would alone be possible. Again, the  plural notion conveyed by the _-s_ of _reformers_ is just as definitely  expressed in the word _geese_, where an utterly distinct method  is employed. Furthermore, the principle of vocalic change  (_goose_--_geese_) is by no means confined to the expression of the idea  of plurality; it may also function as an indicator of difference of time  (e.g., _sing_--_sang_, _throw_--_threw_). But the expression in English  of past time is not by any means always bound up with a change of vowel.  In the great majority of cases the same idea is expressed by means of a  distinct suffix (_die-d_, _work-ed_). Functionally, _died_ and _sang_  are analogous; so are _reformers_ and _geese_. Formally, we must arrange  these words quite otherwise. Both _die-d_ and _re-form-er-s_ employ the  method of suffixing grammatical elements; both _sang_ and _geese_ have  grammatical form by virtue of the fact that their vowels differ from the  vowels of other words with which they are closely related in form and  meaning (_goose_; _sing_, _sung_).    [Footnote 26: For the symbolism, see chapter II.]    [Footnote 27: \"_Plural_\" is here a symbol for any prefix indicating  plurality.]    Every language possesses one or more formal methods or indicating the  relation of a secondary concept to the main concept of the radical  element. Some of these grammatical processes, like suffixing, are  exceedingly wide-spread; others, like vocalic change, are less common  but far from rare; still others, like accent and consonantal change, are  somewhat exceptional as functional processes. Not all languages are as  irregular as English in the assignment of functions to its stock of  grammatical processes. As a rule, such basic concepts as those of  plurality and time are rendered by means of one or"]]]
