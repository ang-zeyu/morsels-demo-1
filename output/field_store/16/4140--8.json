But my Aunt Marjory was forever going on about my coming to  London, and entering the shop of Master Nicholas Fleming, and as it  seemed an easy thing to sell yards of silks and velvets, I did not stand  against her wishes, especially as she promised that if in a year's time  I did not like the life, she would ask Master Nicholas to cancel my  indentures, and let me go back again to the farm.\"    \"Ah, well,\" Jacob said, \"it is useful to have an aunt who has been nurse  to a city merchant. The life is not a bad one, though our master is  strict with all. But Dame Alice is a good housewife, and has a light  hand at confections, and when there are good things on the table she  does not, as do most of the wives of the traders, keep them for herself  and her husband, but lets us have a share also.\"    \"I am fond of confections,\", Harry said; \"and my Aunt Marjory is famous  at them; and now, as I am very sleepy, I will go off. But methinks,  Jacob, that you take up hugely more than your share of the bed.\"    After a little grumbling on both sides the boys disposed themselves to  sleep, each wondering somewhat over the character of the other, and  determining to make a better acquaintance shortly.          CHAPTER VI.    A NARROW ESCAPE.      During the next few days Harry was kept hard at work delivering the  various minute documents which he had brought in the hollow of his  stick. Sometimes of an evening he attended his master to the houses  where he had taken such messages, and once or twice was called in to be  present at discussions, and asked to explain various matters connected  with the position of the king. During this time he saw but little of the  apprentice Jacob, except at his meals, and as the boy did not touch upon  his frequent absence, or make any allusion to political matters, when in  their bedroom alone at night, Harry hoped that his suspicions had been  allayed.    One morning, however, on waking up, he saw the boy sitting upright in  bed, staring fixedly at him.    \"What is the matter; Jacob, and what are you doing?\"    \"I am wondering who and what you are!\" the boy said.    \"I am Roger, your fellow apprentice,\" Harry replied, laughing.    \"I am not sure that you are Roger; I am not sure that you are an  apprentice,\" the boy said. \"But if you were, that would not tell me who  you are. If you were merely Roger the apprentice, Dame Alice would not  pick out all the tit-bits at dinner, and put them on your plate, while I  and Master Hardwood have to put up with any scraps which may come. Nor  do I think that, even for the purpose of carrying his cloak, our master  would take you with him constantly of an evening. He seems mighty  anxious too, for you to learn your way about London. I do not remember  that he showed any such care as to my geographical knowledge. But, of  course, there is a mystery, and I want to get to the bottom of it, and  mean to do so if I can.\"    \"Even supposing that there was a mystery,\" Harry said, \"what good would  it do to you to learn it, and what use would you make of your  knowledge?\"    \"I do not know,\" the boy said carelessly. \"But knowledge is power.\"    \"You see,\" Harry said, \"that supposing there were, as you say, a  mystery, the secret would not be mine to tell, and even were it so  before I told it, I should want to know whether you desired to know it  for the sake of aiding your master, if possible, or of doing him an  injury.    \"I would do him no injury, assuredly,\" Jacob said. \"Master Fleming is as  good a master as there is in London. I want to find out, because it is  my nature to find out. The mere fact that there is a mystery excites my  curiosity, and compels me to do all in my power to get to the bottom of  it. Methinks that if you have aught that you do not want known, it would  be better to take Jacob Plummer into your confidence. Many a man's head  has been lost before now because he did not know whom to trust.\"    \"There is no question of losing heads in the matter,\" Harry said,  smiling.    \"Well, you know best,\" Jacob replied, shrugging his shoulders; \"but  heads do not seem very firmly on at present.\"    When he went out with Master Fleming that evening Harry related to him  the conversation which he had had with Jacob.    \"What think you, Master Furness? Is this malapert boy to be trusted, or  not?\"    \"It were difficult to say, sir,\" Harry answered. \"His suspicions are  surely roused, and as it seemed to me that his professions of affection  and duty toward yourself were earnest, methinks that you might enlist  him in your cause, and would find him serviceable hereafter, did you  allow me frankly to speak to him. He has friends among the apprentice  boys, and might, should he be mischievously inclined, set one to follow  us of a night, and learn whither you go; he might even now do much  mischief. I think that it is his nature to love plotting for its own  sake. He would rather plot on your side than against it; but if you will  not have him, he may go against you.\"    \"I have a good mind to send him home to his friends,\" the merchant said.  \"He can know nothing as yet.\"    \"He might denounce me as a Royalist,\" Harry said; \"and you for harboring  me. I will sound him again to-night, and see further into his  intentions. But methinks it would be best to trust him.\"    That night the conversation was again renewed.    \"You see, Jacob,\" Harry said, \"that it would be a serious matter,  supposing what you think to be true, to intrust you with the secret. I  know not whether you are disposed toward king or Parliament, and to put  the lives of many honorable gentlemen into the hands of one of whose  real disposition I know little would be but a fool's trick.\"    \"You speak fairly, Roger,\" the boy said. \"Indeed, What I said to you was  true. I trouble my head in no way as to the politics and squabbles of  the present day; but I mean to rise some day, and there is no better way  to rise than to be mixed up in a plot. It is true that the rise may be  to the gallows; but if one plays for high stakes, one must risk one's  purse. I love excitement, and believe that I am no fool. I can at least  be true to the side that I engage upon, and of the two, would rather  take that of the king than of the Parliament, because it seems to me  that there are more fools on his side than on the other, and therefore  more chance for a wise head to prosper.\"    Harry laughed.    \"You have no small opinion of yourself, Master Jacob.\"    \"No,\" the boy said; \"I always found myself able to hold my own. My  father, who is a scrivener, predicted me that I should either come to  wealth or be hanged, and I am of the same opinion myself.\"    After further conversation next day with the merchant, Harry frankly  confided to Jacob that evening that he was the bearer of letters from  the king. Of their contents he said that he knew nothing; but had reason  to believe that another movement was on foot for bringing about the  overthrow of the party of Puritans who were in possession of the  government of London.    \"I deemed that such was your errand,\" the boy said. \"You played your  part well; but not well enough. You might have deceived grown-up people;  but you would hardly take in a boy of your own age. Now that you have  told me frankly, I will, if I can, do anything to aid. I care nothing  for the opinions of one side or the other; but as I have to go to the  cathedral three times on Sunday, and to sit each time for two hours  listening to the harangues of Master Ezekiel Proudfoot, I would gladly  join in anything which would be likely to end by silencing that fellow  and his gang. It is monstrous that, upon the only day in the week we  have to ourselves, we should be compelled to undergo the punishment of  listening to these long-winded divines.\"    When Harry was not engaged in taking notes, backward and forward,  between the merchant and those with whom he was negotiating, he was  occupied in the shop. There the merchant kept up appearances before the  scrivener and any customers who might come in, by instructing him in the  mysteries of his trade; by showing him the value of the different  velvets and silks; and by teaching him his private marks, by which, in  case of the absence of the merchant or his apprentice, he could state  the price of any article to a trader who might come in. Harry judged, by  the conversations which he had with his host, that the latter was not  sanguine as to the success of the negotiations which he was carrying on.    \"If,\" he said, \"the king could obtain one single victory, his friends  would raise their heads, and would assuredly be supported by the great  majority of the population, who wish only for peace; but so long as the  armies stood facing each other, and the Puritans are all powerful in the  Parliament and Council of the city, men are afraid to be the first to  move, not being sure how popular support would be given.\"    One evening after work was over Harry and Jacob walked together up the  Cheap, and took their place among a crowd listening to a preacher at  Paul's Cross. He was evidently a popular character, and a large number  of grave men, of the straitest Puritan appearance, were gathered round  him.    \"I wish we could play some trick with these somber-looking knaves,\"  Jacob whispered.    \"Yes,\" Harry said; \"I would give much to be able to do so; but at the  present moment I scarcely wish to draw attention upon myself.\"    \"Let us get out of this, then,\" Jacob said, \"if there is no fun to be  had. I am sick of these long-winded orations.\"    They turned to go, and as they made their way through the crowd, Harry  trod upon the toe of a small man in a high steeple hat and black coat.    \"I beg your pardon,\" Harry said, as there burst from the lips of the  little man an exclamation which was somewhat less decorous than would  have been expected from a personage so gravely clad. The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1159"],[0,"Fire-Tongue (#12)"],[1,"to  express my opinion.\"    She continued to look at him challengingly, but:    \"Quite right, Mr. Harley,\" said Doctor McMurdoch, \"but if you were, your  opinion would be the same as mine.\"    Mrs. McMurdoch's glance became positively beseeching, but the physician  ignored it. \"As your father's oldest friend,\" he continued, \"I feel  called upon to remark that it isn't usual for strangers to thrust their  attentions upon a bereaved family.\"    \"Oh,\" said Phil Abingdon with animation, \"do I understand that this is  also your opinion, Mr. Harley?\"    \"As a man of the world,\" declared Doctor McMurdoch, gloomily, \"it cannot  fail to be.\"    Tardily enough he now succumbed to the silent entreaties of his wife.  \"I will speak of this later,\" he concluded. \"Mayhap I should not have  spoken now.\"    Tears began to trickle down Phil Abingdon's cheeks.    \"Oh, my dear, my dear!\" cried little Mrs. McMurdoch, running to her  side.    But the girl sprang up, escaping from the encircling arm of the motherly  old lady. She shook her head disdainfully, as if to banish tears and  weakness, and glanced rapidly around from face to face. \"I think you are  all perfectly cruel and horrible,\" she said in a choking voice, turned,  and ran out.    A distant door banged.    \"H'm,\" muttered Doctor McMurdoch, \"I've put my foot in it.\"    His wife looked at him in speechless indignation and then followed Phil  Abingdon from the room.        CHAPTER IX. TWO REPORTS    On returning to his office Paul Harley found awaiting him the report  of the man to whom he had entrusted the study of the movements of Nicol  Brinn. His mood was a disturbed one, and he had observed none of his  customary precautions in coming from Doctor McMurdoch's house. He  wondered if the surveillance which he had once detected had ceased.  Perhaps the chambers of Nicol Brinn were the true danger zone upon which  these subtle but powerful forces now were focussed. On the other hand,  he was quite well aware that his movements might have been watched  almost uninterruptedly since the hour that Sir Charles Abingdon had  visited his office.    During the previous day, in his attempt to learn the identity of  Ormuz Khan, he had covered his tracks with his customary care. He had  sufficient faith in his knowledge of disguise, which was extensive,  to believe that those mysterious persons who were interested in his  movements remained unaware of the fact that the simple-minded visitor  from Vancouver who had spent several hours in and about the Savoy, and  Paul Harley of Chancery Lane, were one and the same.    His brain was far too alertly engaged with troubled thoughts of Phil  Abingdon to be susceptible to the influence of those delicate etheric  waves which he had come to recognize as the note of danger. Practically  there had been no development whatever in the investigation, and he was  almost tempted to believe that the whole thing was a mirage, when the  sight of the typewritten report translated him mentally to the luxurious  chambers in Piccadilly.    Again, almost clairvoyantly, he saw the stoical American seated before  the empty fireplace, his foot restlessly tapping the fender. Again he  heard the curious, high tones: \"I'll tell you... You have opened the  gates of hell....\"    The whole scene, with its tantalizing undercurrent of mystery, was  reenacted before his inner vision. He seemed to hear Nicol Brinn,  startled from his reverie, exclaim: \"I think it was an owl.... We  sometimes get them over from the Green Park....\"    Why should so simple an incident have produced so singular an effect?  For the face of the speaker had been ashen.    Then the pendulum swung inevitably back: \"You are all perfectly cruel  and horrible....\"    Paul Harley clenched his hands, frowning at the Burmese cabinet as  though he hated it.    How persistently the voice of Phil Abingdon rang in his ears! He could  not forget her lightest words. How hopelessly her bewitching image  intruded itself between his reasoning mind and the problem upon which he  sought to concentrate.    Miss Smith, the typist, had gone, for it was after six o'clock, and  Innes alone was on duty. He came in as Harley, placing his hat and cane  upon the big writing table, sat down to study the report.    \"Inspector Wessex rang up, Mr. Harley, about an hour ago. He said he  would be at the Yard until six.\"    \"Has he obtained any information?\" asked Paul Harley, wearily, glancing  at his little table clock.    \"He said he had had insufficient time to do much in the matter, but that  there were one or two outstanding facts which might interest you.\"    \"Did he seem to be surprised?\"    \"He did,\" confessed Innes. \"He said that Ormuz Khan was a well-known  figure in financial circles, and asked me in what way you were  interested in him.\"    \"Ah!\" murmured Harley. He took up the telephone. \"City 400,\" he said....  \"Is that the Commissioner's Office, New Scotland Yard? ... Paul Harley  speaking. Would you please inquire if Detective Inspector Wessex has  gone?\"    While awaiting a reply he looked up at Innes. \"Is there anything else?\"  he asked.    \"Only the letters, Mr. Harley.\"    \"No callers?\"    \"No.\"    \"Leave the letters, then; I will see to them. You need not wait.\" A  moment later, as his secretary bade him good-night and went out of the  office:    \"Hello,\" said Harley, speaking into the mouthpiece... \"The inspector  has gone? Perhaps you would ask him to ring me up in the morning.\" He  replaced the receiver on the hook.    Resting his chin in his hands, he began to read from the typewritten  pages before him. His assistant's report was conceived as follows:    'Re Mr. Nicol Brinn of Raleigh House, Piccadilly, W. I.    'Mr. Nicol Brinn is an American citizen, born at Cincinnati, Ohio,  February 15, 1884. He is the son of John Nicolas Brinn of the same  city, founder of the firm of J. Nicolas Brinn, Incorporated, later  reconstituted under the style of Brinn's Universal Electric Supply  Corporation.    'Nicol Brinn is a graduate of Harvard. He has travelled extensively  in nearly all parts of the world and has access to the best society  of Europe and America. He has a reputation for eccentricity, has won  numerous sporting events as a gentleman rider; was the first airman to  fly over the Rockies; took part in the Uruguay rebellion of 1904, and  held the rank of lieutenant colonel of field artillery with the American  forces during the Great War.    'He has published a work on big game and has contributed numerous travel  articles to American periodicals. On the death of Mr. Brinn, senior, in  1914, he inherited an enormous fortune and a preponderating influence  in the B.U.E.S.C. He has never taken any active part in conduct of the  concern, but has lived a restless and wandering life in various parts of  the world.    'Mr. Nicol Brinn is a confirmed bachelor. I have been unable to find  that he has ever taken the slightest interest in any woman other than  his mother throughout his career. Mrs. J. Nicolas Brinn is still living  in Cincinnati, and there is said to be a strong bond of affection  between mother and son. His movements on yesterday, 4th June, 1921, were  as follows:    'He came out of his chambers at eight o'clock and rode for an hour in  the park, when he returned and remained indoors until midday. He then  drove to the Carlton, where he lunched with the Foreign Secretary, with  whom he remained engaged in earnest conversation until ten minutes to  three. The Rt. Hon. gentleman proceeded to the House of Commons and Mr.  Brinn to an auction at Christie's. He bought two oil paintings. He then  returned to his chambers and did not reappear again until seven o'clock.  He dined alone at a small and unfashionable restaurant in Soho, went on  to his box at Covent Garden, where he remained for an hour, also alone,  and then went home. He had no callers throughout the day.'    Deliberately Paul Harley had read the report, only removing his hand  from his chin to turn over the pages. Now from the cabinet at his elbow  he took out his tin of tobacco and, filling and lighting a pipe, lay  back, eyes half closed, considering what he had learned respecting Nicol  Brinn.    That he was concerned in the death of Sir Charles Abingdon he did  not believe for a moment; but that this elusive case, which upon  investigation only seemed the more obscure, was nevertheless a case of  deliberate murder he was as firmly convinced as ever. Of the identity of  the murderer, of his motive, he had not the haziest idea, but that the  cloud which he had pictured as overhanging the life of the late Sir  Charles was a reality and not a myth of the imagination he became more  completely convinced with each new failure to pick up a clue.    He found himself helplessly tied. In which direction should he move and  to what end? Inclination prompted him in one direction, common sense  held him back. As was his custom, he took a pencil and wrote upon a  little block:    Find means to force Brinn to speak.    He lay back in his chair again, deep in thought, and presently added the  note:    Obtain interview with Ormuz Khan.    Just as he replaced the pencil on the table, his telephone bell rang.  The caller proved to be his friend, Inspector Wessex.    \"Hello, Mr. Harley,\" said the inspector. \"I had occasion to return to  the Yard, and they told me you had rung up. I don't know why you are  interested in this Ormuz Khan, unless you want to raise a loan.\"    Paul Harley laughed. \"I gather that he is a man of extensive means,\"  he replied, \"but hitherto he has remained outside my radius of  observation.\"    \"And outside mine,\" declared the inspector. \"He hasn't the most distant  connection with anything crooked. It gave me a lot of trouble to find  out what little I have found out. Briefly, all I have to tell you is  this: Ormuz Khan--who is apparently entitled to be addressed as  'his excellency'--is a director of the Imperial "]]]
