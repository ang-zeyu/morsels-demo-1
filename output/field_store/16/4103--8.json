He was born in the  town of Shrewsbury[1] as himself affirms in his book made in verse of  the Worthiness of Wales. He was equally addicted to arts and arms;  he had a liberal education, and inherited some fortune, real and  personal; but he soon exhausted it, in a tedious and unfruitful  attendance at court, for he gained no other equivalent for that  mortifying dependance, but the honour of being retained a domestic  in the family of lord Surry: during which time by his lordship's  encouragement he commenced poet. Upon his master's death he betook  himself to arms; was in many engagements, and was frequently wounded;  he was twice a prisoner, and redeemed by the charity of two noble  ladies, yet still languishing in distress, and bitterly complaining of  fortune. Neither of his employments afforded him a patron, who would  do justice to his obscure merit; and unluckily he was as unhappy in  his amours as in his circumstances, some of his mistresses treating  his addresses with contempt, perhaps, on account of his poverty;  for tho' it generally happens that Poets have the greatest power in  courtship, as they can celebrate their mistresses with more elegance  than people of any other profession; yet it very seldom falls out that  they marry successfully, as their needy circumstances naturally deter  them from making advances to Ladies of such fashion as their genius  and manners give them a right to address. This proved our author's  case exactly; he made love to a widow named Browning, who possessed a  very good jointure; but this lady being more in love with money than  laurels, with wealth than merit, rejected his suit; which not a little  discouraged him, as he had spent his money in hopes of effecting this  match, which, to his great mortification, all his rhimes and sonnets  could not do. He dedicated his vorks to Sir Christopher Hatton; but  addresses of that nature don't always imply a provision for their  author. It is conjectured that he died about the eleventh year of  Queen Elizabeth, and according to Mr. Wood was buried near Skelton  in the Chancel of St. Margaret's, Westminster. By his writings, he  appears a man of sense, and sometimes a poet, tho' he does not seem to  possess any degree of invention. His language is generally pure, and  his numbers not wholly inharmonious. The Legend of Jane Shore is the  most finished of all his works, from which I have taken a quotation.  His death, according to the most probable conjecture, happened in  1570. Thus like a stone (says Winstanley) did he trundle about, but  never gathered any moss, dying but poor, as may be seen by his epitaph  in Mr. Camden's Remains, which runs thus:      Come Alecto, lend me thy torch    To find a Church-yard in a Church-porch;    Poverty and poetry his tomb doth enclose,    Wherefore good neighbours, be merry in prose.    His works according to Winstanley are as follow:    The Siege of Leith.    A Farewell to the world.    A feigned Fancy of the Spider and the Gaul.    A doleful Discourse of a Lady and a Knight.    The Road into Scotland, by Sir William Drury.    Sir Simon Burley's Tragedy.    A lamentable Description of the Wars in Flanders in prose, and  dedicated to Walsingham secretary of state.    A light Bundle of lively Discourses, called Churchyard's Charge 1580,  dedicated to his noble patron the Earl of Surry.    A Spark of Friendship, a treatise on that writer, address'd to Sir  Walter Raleigh.    A Description and Discourse on the use of paper, in which he praises a  paper-mill built near Darthsend, by a German called Spillman.    The Honour of the Law 1596.    Jane Shore, mistress to King Edward IV.    A Tragical Discourse of the unhappy Man's Life.    A Discourse of Virtue.    Churchyard's Dream.    A Tale of a Fryar and a Shoemaker's Wife,    The Siege of Edinburgh Castle.    Queen Elizabeth's reception into Bristol.    These twelve several pieces he bound together, calling them  Churchyard's Chips, which he dedicated to Sir Christopher Hatton. He  wrote beside,      The Tragedy of Thomas Moubray Duke of    Norfolk.    Among the rest by fortune overthrowne,    I am not least, that most may waile her fate:    My fame and brute, abroad the world is    blowne,    Who can forget a thing thus done so late?    My great mischance, my fall, and heavy state,    Is such a marke whereat each tongue doth shoot    That my good name, is pluckt up by the root,      [Footnote 1: Winst. 61.]           *       *       *       *       *      JOHN HEYWOOD    One of the first who wrote English plays, was a noted jester, of some  reputation in poetry in his time. Wood says, that notwithstanding he  was stiled Civis Londinensis, yet he laid a foundation of learning at  Oxford, but the severity of an academical life not suitng with his  airy genius, he retired to his native place, and had the honour to  have a great intimacy with Sir Thomas More. It is said, that he had  admirable skill both in instrumental and vocal music, but it is not  certain whether he left any compositions of that sort behind him. He  found means to become a favourite with King Henry VIII on account  of the quickness of his conceits, and was well rewarded by that  Monarch.[1] After the accession of Queen Mary to the throne, he  was equally valued by her, and was admitted into the most intimate  conversation with her, in diverting her by his merry stories, which he  did, even when she lay languishing on her death-bed. After the decease  of that princess, he being a bigotted Roman Catholic, and finding the  protestant interest was like to prevail under the patronage of the  renowned Queen Elizabeth, he sacrificed the enjoyment of living in his  own country, to that of his religion: For he entered into a voluntary  exile, and settled at Mechlin in Brabant.    The Play called the Four P's being a new and and merry interlude of  a Palmer, Pardoner, Poticary, and Pedler--printed in an old English  character in quarto, has in the title page the pictures of four men in  old-fashioned habits, wrought off, from a wooden cut. He has likewise  writ the following interludes.      Between John the Husband and Tib the Wife.    Between the Pardoner and the Fryer, the Curate    and neighbouring Pratt.    Play of Gentleness and Nobility, in two parts.    The Pindar of Wakefield, a comedy.    Philotas Scotch, a comedy.    This author also wrote a dialogue, containing the number in effect of  all the proverbs in the English tongue, compact in a matter concerning  two manner of marriages. London 1547, and 1598, in two parts in  quarto, all writ in old English verse, and printed in an English  character.    Three hundred epigrams upon three hundred proverbs, in old English  character.    A fourth hundred of epigrams, printed in quarto, London 1598.    A fifth hundred of epigrams, printed in quarto, London 1598.    The Spider and Fly. A Parable of the Spider and Fly, London 1556, in a  pretty thick quarto, all in old English verse. Before the title is the  picture of John Heywood at full length, printed from a wooden cut,  with a fur gown on, almost representing the fashion of that, belonging  to a master of arts, but the bottom of the sleeve reach no lower than  his knees; on his head is a round cap, his chin and lips are close  shaved, and hath a dagger hanging to his girdle.[2]    Dr. Fuller mentions a book writ by our author,[3] entitled Monumenta  Literaria, which are said to Non tam labore, condita, quam Lepore  condita: The author of English poetry, speaking of several of our old  English bards, says thus of our poet. \"John Heywood for the mirth and  quickness of conceit, more than any good learning that was in him,  came to be well rewarded by the king.\"    That the reader may judge of his epigrams, to which certainly the  writer just mentioned alludes, I shall present him with one writ by  him on himself.      Art thou Heywood, with thy mad merry wit?    Yea for sooth master, that name is even hit.    Art thou Heywood, that apply's mirth more than    thrift?    Yes sir, I take merry mirth, a golden gift.    Art thou Heywood, that hast made many mad    plays?    Yea many plays, few good works in my days.    Art thou Heywood, that hath made men merry    long?    Yea, and will, if I be made merry among.    Art thou Heywood, that would'st be made merry    now?    Yes, Sir, help me to it now, I beseech you.    He died at Mechlin, in the year 1565, and was buried there, leaving  behind him several children, to whom he had given liberal education,  one of whom is Jasper, who afterwards made a considerable figure, and  became a noted Jesuit.      [Footnote 1: Wood Athen, Oxon.]    [Footnote 2: Wood ubi supra.]    [Footnote 3: Worthies of London, p. 221.]           *       *       *       *       *      GEORGE FERRARS,    Descended of an ancient family seated in Hertfordshire, was born there  in a village not far from St. Alban's about the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/106"],[0,"Jungle Tales of Tarzan (#12)"],[1," He had set out to approach and examine God and  nothing upon earth might now stay his feet.  Seeing that his antics had  no potency with the visitor, the witch-doctor tried some new medicine.  Spitting upon the zebra's tail, which he still clutched in one hand, he  made circles above it with the arrows in the other hand, meanwhile  backing cautiously away from Tarzan and speaking confidentially to the  bushy end of the tail.    This medicine must be short medicine, however, for the creature, god or  demon, was steadily closing up the distance which had separated them.  The circles therefore were few and rapid, and when they were completed,  the witch-doctor struck an attitude which was intended to be awe  inspiring and waving the zebra's tail before him, drew an imaginary  line between himself and Tarzan.    \"Beyond this line you cannot pass, for my medicine is strong medicine,\"  he cried.  \"Stop, or you will fall dead as your foot touches this spot.  My mother was a voodoo, my father was a snake; I live upon lions'  hearts and the entrails of the panther; I eat young babies for  breakfast and the demons of the jungle are my slaves.  I am the most  powerful witch-doctor in the world; I fear nothing, for I cannot die.  I--\" But he got no further; instead he turned and fled as Tarzan of the  Apes crossed the magical dead line and still lived.    As the witch-doctor ran, Tarzan almost lost his temper.  This was no  way for God to act, at least not in accordance with the conception  Tarzan had come to have of God.    \"Come back!\" he cried.  \"Come back, God, I will not harm you.\" But the  witch-doctor was in full retreat by this time, stepping high as he  leaped over cooking pots and the smoldering embers of small fires that  had burned before the huts of villagers.  Straight for his own hut ran  the witch-doctor, terror-spurred to unwonted speed; but futile was his  effort--the ape-man bore down upon him with the speed of Bara, the deer.    Just at the entrance to his hut the witch-doctor was overhauled.  A  heavy hand fell upon his shoulder to drag him back.  It seized upon a  portion of the buffalo hide, dragging the disguise from him.  It was a  naked black man that Tarzan saw dodge into the darkness of the hut's  interior.    So this was what he had thought was God! Tarzan's lip curled in an  angry snarl as he leaped into the hut after the terror-stricken  witch-doctor. In the blackness within he found the man huddled at the  far side and dragged him forth into the comparative lightness of the  moonlit night.    The witch-doctor bit and scratched in an attempt to escape; but a few  cuffs across the head brought him to a better realization of the  futility of resistance.  Beneath the moon Tarzan held the cringing  figure upon its shaking feet.    \"So you are God!\" he cried.  \"If you be God, then Tarzan is greater  than God,\" and so the ape-man thought.  \"I am Tarzan,\" he shouted into  the ear of the black.  \"In all the jungle, or above it, or upon the  running waters, or the sleeping waters, or upon the big water, or the  little water, there is none so great as Tarzan.  Tarzan is greater than  the Mangani; he is greater than the Gomangani.  With his own hands he  has slain Numa, the lion, and Sheeta, the panther; there is none so  great as Tarzan.  Tarzan is greater than God.  See!\" and with a sudden  wrench he twisted the black's neck until the fellow shrieked in pain  and then slumped to the earth in a swoon.    Placing his foot upon the neck of the fallen witch-doctor, the ape-man  raised his face to the moon and uttered the long, shrill scream of the  victorious bull ape.  Then he stooped and snatched the zebra's tail  from the nerveless fingers of the unconscious man and without a  backward glance retraced his footsteps across the village.    From several hut doorways frightened eyes watched him.  Mbonga, the  chief, was one of those who had seen what passed before the hut of the  witch-doctor. Mbonga was greatly concerned.  Wise old patriarch that he  was, he never had more than half believed in witch-doctors, at least  not since greater wisdom had come with age; but as a chief he was well  convinced of the power of the witch-doctor as an arm of government, and  often it was that Mbonga used the superstitious fears of his people to  his own ends through the medium of the medicine-man.    Mbonga and the witch-doctor had worked together and divided the spoils,  and now the \"face\" of the witch-doctor would be lost forever if any saw  what Mbonga had seen; nor would this generation again have as much  faith in any future witch-doctor.    Mbonga must do something to counteract the evil influence of the forest  demon's victory over the witch-doctor. He raised his heavy spear and  crept silently from his hut in the wake of the retreating ape-man. Down  the village street walked Tarzan, as unconcerned and as deliberate as  though only the friendly apes of Kerchak surrounded him instead of a  village full of armed enemies.    Seeming only was the indifference of Tarzan, for alert and watchful was  every well-trained sense.  Mbonga, wily stalker of keen-eared jungle  creatures, moved now in utter silence.  Not even Bara, the deer, with  his great ears could have guessed from any sound that Mbonga was near;  but the black was not stalking Bara; he was stalking man, and so he  sought only to avoid noise.    Closer and closer to the slowly moving ape-man he came.  Now he raised  his war spear, throwing his spear-hand far back above his right  shoulder.  Once and for all would Mbonga, the chief, rid himself and  his people of the menace of this terrifying enemy.  He would make no  poor cast; he would take pains, and he would hurl his weapon with such  great force as would finish the demon forever.    But Mbonga, sure as he thought himself, erred in his calculations.  He  might believe that he was stalking a man--he did not know, however,  that it was a man with the delicate sense perception of the lower  orders.  Tarzan, when he had turned his back upon his enemies, had  noted what Mbonga never would have thought of considering in the  hunting of man--the wind.  It was blowing in the same direction that  Tarzan was proceeding, carrying to his delicate nostrils the odors  which arose behind him.  Thus it was that Tarzan knew that he was being  followed, for even among the many stenches of an African village, the  ape-man's uncanny faculty was equal to the task of differentiating one  stench from another and locating with remarkable precision the source  from whence it came.    He knew that a man was following him and coming closer, and his  judgment warned him of the purpose of the stalker.  When Mbonga,  therefore, came within spear range of the ape-man, the latter suddenly  wheeled upon him, so suddenly that the poised spear was shot a fraction  of a second before Mbonga had intended.  It went a trifle high and  Tarzan stooped to let it pass over his head; then he sprang toward the  chief.  But Mbonga did not wait to receive him.  Instead, he turned and  fled for the dark doorway of the nearest hut, calling as he went for  his warriors to fall upon the stranger and slay him.    Well indeed might Mbonga scream for help, for Tarzan, young and  fleet-footed, covered the distance between them in great leaps, at the  speed of a charging lion.  He was growling, too, not at all unlike Numa  himself.  Mbonga heard and his blood ran cold.  He could feel the wool  stiffen upon his pate and a prickly chill run up his spine, as though  Death had come and run his cold finger along Mbonga's back.    Others heard, too, and saw, from the darkness of their huts--bold  warriors, hideously painted, grasping heavy war spears in nerveless  fingers.  Against Numa, the lion, they would have charged fearlessly.  Against many times their own number of black warriors would they have  raced to the protection of their chief; but this weird jungle demon  filled them with terror.  There was nothing human in the bestial growls  that rumbled up from his deep chest; there was nothing human in the  bared fangs, or the catlike leaps.    Mbonga's warriors were terrified--too terrified to leave the seeming  security of their huts while they watched the beast-man spring full  upon the back of their old chieftain.    Mbonga went down with a scream of terror.  He was too frightened even  to attempt to defend himself.  He just lay beneath his antagonist in a  paralysis of fear, screaming at the top of his lungs.  Tarzan half rose  and kneeled above the black.  He turned Mbonga over and looked him in  the face, exposing the man's throat, then he drew his long, keen knife,  the knife that John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, had brought from England  many years before.  He raised it close above Mbonga's neck.  The old  black whimpered with terror.  He pleaded for his life in a tongue which  Tarzan could not understand.    For the first time the ape-man had a close view of the chief.  He saw  an old man, a very old man with scrawny neck and wrinkled face--a  dried, parchment-like face which resembled some of the little monkeys  Tarzan knew so well.  He saw the terror in the man's eyes--never before  had Tarzan seen such terror in the eyes of any animal, or such a  piteous appeal for mercy upon the face of any creature.    Something stayed the ape-man's hand for an instant.  He wondered why it  was that he hesitated to make the kill; never before had he thus  delayed.  The old man seemed to wither and shrink to a bag of puny  bones beneath his eyes.  So weak and helpless and terror-stricken he  appeared that the ape-man was filled with a great contempt; but another  sensation also claimed him--something new to Tarzan of the Apes in  relation to an enemy.  It was pity--pity for a poor, frightened, old  man.    Tarzan rose and turned away, leaving Mbonga, the chief, unharmed.    With head held high the ape-man walked through the village, swung  himself into the"]]]
