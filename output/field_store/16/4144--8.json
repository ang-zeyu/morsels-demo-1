[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1167"],[0,"A Strange Disappearance (#12)"],[1," the  interview.    The Countess De Mirac possessed to its fullest extent the present fine  lady's taste for bric-a-brac. So much I had learned in my inquiries  concerning her. Remembering this, I took the bold resolution of  profiting by this weakness of hers to gain admission to her presence,  she being the only one sharing Mr. Blake's mysterious secret. Borrowing  a valuable antique from a friend of mine at that time in the business,  I made my appearance the very next day at her apartments, and sending  in an urgent request to see Madame, by the trim negress who answered my  summons, waited in some doubt for her reply.    It came all too soon; Madame was ill and could see no one. I was not,  however, to be baffled by one rebuff. Handing the basket I held to the  girl, I urged her to take it in and show her mistress what it contained,  saying it was a rare article which might never again come her way.    The girl complied, though with a doubtful shake of the head which was  anything but encouraging. Her incredulity, however, must have been  speedily rebuked, for she almost immediately returned without the  basket, saying Madame would see me.    My first thoughts upon entering the grand lady's presence, was that the  girl had been mistaken, for I found the Countess walking the floor in an  abstracted way, drying a letter she had evidently but just completed, by  shaking it to and fro with an unsteady hand; the placque I had brought,  lying neglected on the table.    But at sight of my respectful form standing with bent head in the  doorway, she hurriedly thrust the letter into a book and took up the  placque. As she did so I marked her well and almost started at the  change I observed in her since that evening at the Academy. It was not  only that she was dressed in some sort of loose dishabille that was  in eminent contrast to the sweeping silks and satins in which I had  hitherto beheld her adorned; or that she was laboring under some  physical disability that robbed her dark cheek of the bloom that was its  chiefest charm. The change I observed went deeper than that; it was more  as if a light had been extinguished in her countenance. It was the same  woman I had beheld standing like a glowing column of will and strength  before the melancholy form of Mr. Blake, but with the will and strength  gone, and with them all the glow.    \"She no longer hopes,\" thought I, and already felt repaid for my  trouble.    \"This is a very pretty article you have brought me,\" said she with  something of the unrestrained love of art which she undoubtedly  possessed, showing itself through all her languor. \"Where did it come  from, and what recommendations have you, to prove it is an honest sale  you offer me?\"    \"None,\" returned I, ignoring with a reassuring smile the first question,  \"except that I should not be afraid if all the police in New York knew I  was here with this fine placque for sale.\"    She gave a shrug of her proud shoulder that bespoke the French Countess  and softly ran her finger round the edge of the placque.    \"I don't need anything more of this kind,\" said she languidly;  \"besides,\" and she set it down with a fretful air, \"I am in no mood to  buy this afternoon.\" Then shortly, \"What do you ask for it?\"    I named a fabulous price.    She started and cast me a keen glance. \"You had better take it to some  one else; I have no money to throw away.\"    With a hesitating hand I lifted the placque towards the basket. \"I would  very much like to sell it to you,\" said I. \"Perhaps--\"    Just then a lady's fluttering voice rose from the room beyond inquiring  for the Countess, and hurriedly taking the placque from my hand with  an impulsive \"O there's Amy,\" she passed into the adjoining apartment,  leaving the door open behind her.    I saw a quick interchange of greetings between her and a fashionably  dressed lady, then they withdrew to one side with the ornament I had  brought, evidently consulting in regard to its merits. Now was my time.  The book in which she had placed the letter she had been writing lay on  the table right before me, not two inches from my hand. I had only  to throw back the cover and my curiosity would be satisfied. Taking  advantage of a moment when their backs were both turned, I pressed open  the book with a careful hand, and with one eye on them and one on the  sheet before me, managed to read these words:--          MY DEAREST CECILIA.        I have tried in vain to match the sample you sent me at Stewart's,      Arnold's and McCreery's. If you still insist upon making up the      dress in the way you propose, I will see what Madame Dudevant can      do for us, though I cannot but advise you to alter your plans and      make the darker shade of velvet do. I went to the Cary reception      last night and met Lulu Chittenden. She has actually grown old,      but was as lively as ever. She created a great stir in Paris when      she was there; but a husband who comes home two o'clock in the      morning with bleared eyes and empty pockets, is not conducive to      the preservation of a woman's beauty. How she manages to retain      her spirits I cannot imagine. You ask me news of cousin Holman. I      meet him occasionally and he looks well, but has grown into the      most sombre man you ever saw. In regard to certain hopes of which      you have sometimes made mention, let me assure you they are no      longer practicable. He has done what--    Here the conversation ceased in the other room, the Countess made a  movement of advance and I closed the book with an inward groan over my  ill-luck.    \"It is very pretty,\" said she with a weary air; \"but as I remarked  before, I am not in the buying mood. If you will take half you mention,  I may consider the subject, but--\"    \"Pardon me, Madame,\" I interrupted, being in no wise anxious to leave  the placque behind me, \"I have been considering the matter and I hold to  my original price. Mr. Blake of Second Avenue may give it to me if you  do not.\"    \"Mr. Blake!\" She eyed me suspiciously. \"Do you sell to him?\"    \"I sell to anyone I can,\" replied I; \"and as he has an artist's eye for  such things--\"    Her brows knitted and she turned away. \"I do not want it;\" said she,  \"sell it to whom you please.\"    I took up the placque and left the room.        CHAPTER IX. A FEW GOLDEN HAIRS      When a few days from that I made my appearance before Mr. Gryce, it was  to find him looking somewhat sober. \"Those Schoenmakers,\" said he, \"are  making a deal of trouble. It seems they escaped the fellows up north and  are now somewhere in this city, but where--\"    An expressive gesture finished the sentence.    \"Is that so?\" exclaimed I. \"Then we are sure to nab them. Given time and  a pair of low, restless German thieves, I will wager anything, our hands  will be upon them before the month is over. I only hope, when we do come  across them, it will not be to find their betters too much mixed up with  their devilish practices.\" And I related to him what Fanny had told me a  few evenings before.    \"The coil is tightening,\" said he. \"What the end will be I don't know.  Crime, said she? I wish I knew in what blind hole of the earth that girl  we are after lies hidden.\"    As if in answer to this wish the door opened and one of our men came  in with a letter in his hand. \"Ha!\" exclaimed Mr. Gryce, after he had  perused it, \"look at that.\"    I took the letter from his hand and read:        The dead body of a girl such as you describe was found in the East      river off Fiftieth Street this morning. From appearance has been      dead some time. Have telegraphed to Police Headquarters for      orders. Should you wish to see the body before it is removed to      the Morgue or otherwise disturbed, please hasten to Pier 48 E. R.                                                             GRAHAM.    \"Come,\" said I, \"let's go and see for ourselves. If it should be the  one--\"    \"The dinner party proposed by Mr. Blake for to-night, may have its  interruptions,\" he remarked.    I do not wish to make my story any longer than is necessary, but I must  say that when in an hour or so later, I stood with Mr. Gryce before the  unconscious form of that poor drowned girl I felt an unusual degree  of awe stealing over me: there was so much mystery connected with this  affair, and the parties implicated were of such standing and repute.    I almost dreaded to see the covering removed from her face lest I should  behold, what? I could not have told if I had tried.    \"A trim made body enough,\" cried the official in charge as Mr. Gryce  lifted an end of the cloth that enveloped her and threw it back. \"Pity  the features are not better preserved.\"    \"No need for us to see the features,\" exclaimed I, pointing to the locks  of golden red hair that hung in tangled masses about her. \"The hair is  enough; she is not the one.\" And I turned aside, asking myself if it was  relief I felt.    To my surprise Mr. Gryce did not follow.    \"Tall, thin, white face, black eyes.\" I heard him whisper to himself.  \"It is a pity the features are not better preserved.\"    \"But,\" said I, taking him by the arm, \"Fanny spoke particularly of  her hair being black, while this girl's--Good heavens!\" I suddenly  ejaculated as I looked again at the prostrate form before me. \"Yellow  hair or black, this is the girl I saw him speaking to that day in  Broome Street. I remember her clothes if nothing more.\" And opening my  pocketbook, I took out the morsel of cloth I had plucked that day from  the ash barrel, lifted up the discolored rags that hung about the body  and compared the two. The pattern, texture and color were the same.    \"Well,\" said Mr. Gryce, pointing to certain contusions, like marks from  the blow of some heavy instrument on the head and bared arms of the girl  before us; \"he will have to answer me one question anyhow, and that  is, who this poor creature is who lies here the victim of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11692"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 03 (#12)"],[1,"s--behold        From the dull clay the metal rise,          Pure-shining, as a star of gold!            Neck and lip, but as one beam,            It laughs like a sunbeam.    And even the scutcheon, clear-graven, shall tell    That the art of a master has fashioned the Bell!        Come in--come in,        My merry men--we'll form a ring        The new-born labor christening;          And \"CONCORD\" we will name her!        To union may her heart-felt call          In brother-love attune us all!        May she the destined glory win          For which the master sought to frame her--        Aloft--(all earth's existence under)          In blue-pavilioned heaven afar        To dwell--the Neighbor of the Thunder,          The borderer of the Star!        Be hers above a voice to raise          Like those bright hosts in yonder sphere,        Who, while they move, their Maker praise,          And lead around the wreathed year!        To solemn and eternal things          We dedicate her lips sublime,        As hourly, calmly, on she swings,          Fanned by the fleeting wings of Time!        No pulse--no heart--no feeling hers!          She lends the warning voice to Fate;        And still companions, while she stirs,          The changes of the Human State!        So may she teach us, as her tone          But now so mighty, melts away--        That earth no life which earth has known        From the last silence can delay!        Slowly now the cords upheave her!          From her earth-grave soars the Bell;        'Mid the airs of Heaven we leave her!          In the Music-Realm to dwell!            Up--upwards--yet raise--            She has risen--she sways.    Fair Bell to our city bode joy and increase,    And oh, may thy first sound be hallowed to--PEACE.[15]           *       *       *       *       *        THE GERMAN ART (1800)        By no kind Augustus reared,    To no Medici endeared,      German Art arose;    Fostering glory smil'd not on her,    Ne'er with kingly smiles to sun her,      Did her blooms unclose.      No! She went, by Monarchs slighted    Went unhonored, unrequited,      From high Frederick's throne;    Praise and Pride be all the greater,    That Man's genius did create her,      From Man's worth alone.      Therefore, all from loftier mountains,    Purer wells and richer Fountains,      Streams our Poet-Art;    So no rule to curb its rushing--    All the fuller flows it gushing      From its deep--The Heart!           *       *       *       *       *        COMMENCEMENT OF THE NEW CENTURY (1801)        Where can Peace find a refuge? Whither, say,      Can Freedom turn? Lo, friend, before our view    The CENTURY rends itself in storm away,      And, red with slaughter, dawns on earth the New!    The girdle of the lands is loosen'd[16]--hurl'd      To dust the forms old Custom deem'd divine,--    Safe from War's fury not the watery world;--      Safe not the Nile-God nor the antique Rhine.    Two mighty nations make the world their field,      Deeming the world is for their heirloom given--    Against the freedom of all lands they wield      This--Neptune's trident; that--the Thund'rer's levin    Gold to their scales each region must afford;      And, as fierce Brennus in Gaul's early tale,    The Frank casts in the iron of his sword,      To poise the balance, where the right may fail--    Like some huge Polypus, with arms that roam      Outstretch'd for prey--the Briton spreads his reign;    And, as the Ocean were his household home,      Locks up the chambers of the liberal main.    On to the Pole where shines, unseen, the Star,      Onward his restless course unbounded flies;    Tracks every isle and every coast afar,      And undiscover'd leaves but--Paradise!    Alas, in vain on earth's wide chart, I ween,      Thou seek'st that holy realm beneath the sky--    Where Freedom dwells in gardens ever green--      And blooms the Youth of fair Humanity!    O'er shores where sail ne'er rustled to the wind,      O'er the vast universe, may rove thy ken;    But in the universe thou canst not find      A space sufficing for ten happy men!    In the heart's holy stillness only beams      The shrine of refuge from life's stormy throng;    Freedom is only in the land of Dreams;      And only blooms the Beautiful in Song!           *       *       *       *       *        CASSANDRA (1802)      [There is peace between the Greeks and Trojans--Achilles is to wed  Polyxena, Priam's daughter. On entering the Temple, he is shot through  his only vulnerable part by Paris.--The time of the following Poem is  during the joyous preparations for the marriage.]      And mirth was in the halls of Troy,      Before her towers and temples fell;    High peal'd the choral hymns of joy,      Melodious to the golden shell.    The weary had reposed from slaughter--      The eye forgot the tear it shed;    This day King Priam's lovely daughter      Shall great Pelides wed!      Adorn'd with laurel boughs, they come,      Crowd after crowd--the way divine,    Where fanes are deck'd--for gods the home--      And to the Thymbrian's[17] solemn shrine.    The wild Bacchantic joy is madd'ning      The thoughtless host, the fearless guest;    And there, the unheeded heart is sadd'ning      _One_ solitary breast!      Unjoyous in the joyful throng,      Alone, and linking life with none,    Apollo's laurel groves among      The still Cassandra wander'd on!    Into the forest's deep recesses      The solemn Prophet-Maiden pass'd,    And, scornful, from her loosen'd tresses,      The sacred fillet cast!      \"To all its arms doth Mirth unfold,      And every heart foregoes its cares;    And Hope is busy in the old;      The bridal-robe my sister wears.    But I alone, alone am weeping;      The sweet delusion mocks not me--    Around these walls destruction sweeping      More near and near I see!      \"A torch before my vision glows,      But not in Hymen's hand it shines;    A flame that to the welkin goes,      But not from holy offering-shrines;    Glad hands the banquet are preparing,      And near, and near the halls of state    I hear the God that comes unsparing;      I hear the steps of Fate.      \"And men my prophet-wail deride!      The solemn sorrow dies in scorn;    And lonely in the waste, I hide      The tortured heart that would forewarn.    Amidst the happy, unregarded,      Mock'd by their fearful joy, I trod;    Oh, dark to me the lot awarded,      Thou evil Pythian god!      \"Thine oracle, in vain to be,      Oh, wherefore am I thus consign'd    With eyes that every truth must see,      Lone in the City of the Blind?    Cursed with the anguish of a power      To view the fates I may not thrall,    The hovering tempest still must lower--      The horror must befall!      \"Boots it the veil to lift, and give      To sight the frowning fates beneath?    For error is the life we live,      And, oh, our knowledge is but death!    Take back the clear and awful mirror,      Shut from mine eyes the blood-red glare    Thy truth is but a gift of terror      When mortal lips declare.      \"My blindness give to me once more[18]--      The gay dim senses that rejoice;    The Past's delighted songs are o'er      For lips that speak a Prophet's voice.    To me _the future_ thou hast granted;      I miss _the moment_ from the chain--    The happy Present-Hour enchanted!      Take back thy gift again!      \"Never for me the nuptial wreath      The odor-breathing hair shall twine;    My heavy heart is bow'd beneath      The service of thy dreary shrine.    My youth was but by tears corroded,--      My sole familiar is my pain,    Each coming ill my heart foreboded,      And felt it first--in vain!      \"How cheer'ly sports the careless mirth--      The life that loves, around I see;    Fair youth to pleasant thoughts give birth--      The heart is only sad to me.    Not for mine eyes the young spring gloweth,      When earth her happy feast-day keeps;    The charm of life who ever knoweth      That looks into the deeps?      \"Wrapt in thy bliss, my sister, thine      The heart's inebriate rapture-springs;--    Longing with bridal arms to twine      The bravest of the Grecian kings.    High swells the joyous bosom, seeming      Too narrow for its world of love,    Nor envies, in its heaven of dreaming,      The heaven of gods above!      \"I too might know the soft control      Of one the longing heart could choose,    With look which love illumes with soul--      The look that supplicates and woos.    And sweet with him, where love presiding      Prepares our hearth, to go--but, dim,    A Stygian shadow, nightly gliding,      Stalks between me and him!      \"Forth from the grim funereal shore,      The Hell-Queen sends her ghastly bands;    Where'er I turn--behind--before--      Dumb in my path--a Spectre stands!    Wherever gayliest, youth assembles--      I see the shades in horror clad,    Amidst Hell's ghastly People trembles      One soul for ever sad!      \"I see the steel of Murder gleam--      I see the Murderer's glowing eyes--    To right--to left, one gory stream--      One circling fate--my flight defies!    I may not turn my gaze--all seeing,      Foreknowing all, I dumbly stand--    To close in blood my ghastly being      In the far strangers' land!\"      Hark! while the sad sounds murmur round,      Hark, from the Temple-porch, the cries!--    A wild, confused, tumultuous sound!--      Dead the divine Pelides lies!    Grim Discord rears her snakes devouring--      The last departing god hath gone!    And, womb'd in cloud, the thunder, lowering,      Hangs black on Ilion.
