Their vengeance was chiefly bent against the  Camp-Marshal, Aufidienus Rufus: him they dragged from his chariot, and,  loading him with baggage, drove him before the first ranks; they then  insulted him, and asked in scorn, \"whether he would gladly bear such  enormous burdens, whether endure such immense marches?\" Rufus had  been long a common soldier, then became a Centurion, and afterwards  Camp-Marshal; a severe restorer of primitive strictness and discipline;  an indefatigable observer of every military duty, which he exacted from  others with the more rigour, as he had himself undergone them all with  patience.    By the arrival of this tumultuous band the sedition was again awakened  to its former outrage, and the seditious, roving abroad without control,  ravaged the country on every side. Blesus, for an example of terror  to the rest, commanded those who were most laden with plunder, to be  punished with stripes and cast into prison: for the General was still  dutifully obeyed by the Centurions, and by all the soldiers of any  merit; but the criminals refused to submit, and even struggled with  the guard who were carrying them off; they clasped the knees of the  bystanders, implored help from their fellows, now calling upon every  individual, and conjuring them by their particular names; then appealed  to them in a body, and supplicated the company, the cohort, the legion  to which they belonged; warning and proclaiming that the same ignominy  and chastisement hung over them all. With the same breath they heaped  invectives without measure upon their General, and called upon heaven  and all the Gods to be their witnesses and avengers; nor left they aught  unattempted to raise effectual hatred, compassion, terror, and every  species of fury. Hence the whole body rushed to their relief, burst open  the prison, unbound and rescued the prisoners: thus they owned for their  brethren, and incorporated with themselves, infamous revolters, and  traitors convict and condemned.    Hence the violence became more raging, and hence more sedition from more  leaders. There was particularly one Vibulenus, a common soldier, who,  exalted on the shoulders of his comrades, before the tribunal of Blesus,  thus declaimed in the ears of a multitude already outrageous, and eager  to hear what he had to say. \"To these innocents,\" says he, \"to these  miserable sufferers, our fellow-soldiers, you have indeed restored  breath and liberty: but who will restore life to my poor brother; who  my poor brother to me? He was sent hither by the German armies, with  propositions for our common good; and for this, was last night butchered  by that same Blesus, who in the murder employed his gladiators, bloody  men, whom he purposely entertains and arms for our common execution.  Where, oh where, Blesus, hast thou thrown his unoffending and mangled  corpse? Even open enemies do not inhumanly deny burial to the slain:  when I have satiated my sorrow with a thousand kisses, and a flood  of tears; command me also to be murdered, that these our brethren may  together bury my poor brother and me, slaughtered both as victims, yet  both guiltless of any crime but that of studying the common interest of  the legions.\"    He inflamed those his complaints and expostulations with affecting sighs  and lamentations, beat his breast, tore his face, and showed all the  symptoms of anguish. Then those who carried him giving way, he threw  himself headlong at the feet of his companions; and thus prostrate and  supplicating, in them raised such a spirit of commiseration and such a  storm of vengeance, that one party of them instantly seized and bound  the General's gladiators; another, the rest of his family; while many  ran and dispersed themselves to search for the corpse: and had it not  been quickly manifest that there was no corpse to be found, that  the slaves of Blesus had upon the rack cleared themselves, and that  Vibulenus never had any brother; they had gone nigh to have sacrificed  the General. As it was, they expulsed the Camp-Marshal and Tribunes;  and as they fled, plundered their baggage: they likewise put to  death Lucilius the Centurion, whom they had sarcastically named _Cedo  Alteram_, because when upon the back of a soldier he had broken one  wand, he was wont to call for another, and then a third. The other  Centurions lurked in concealment, all but Julius Clemens, who for his  prompt capacity was saved, in order to manage the negotiations of the  soldiers: even two of the legions, the eighth and the fifteenth, were  ready to turn their swords upon each other; and had, but for the ninth:  one Sirpicus, a centurion, was the subject of the quarrel; him the  eighth required to be put to death, and the fifteenth protected him; but  the ninth interposed with entreaties to both, and with threats to those  who would not listen to prayers.    Tiberius, however, close and impenetrable, and ever labouring to smother  all melancholy tidings, was yet driven by those from Pannonia, to  despatch his son Drusus thither, accompanied by the principal nobility  and guarded by two Praetorian cohorts; but charged with no precise  instructions, only to adapt his measures to the present exigency: the  cohorts were strengthened with an extraordinary addition of chosen men,  with the greatest part of the Praetorian horse, and main body of the  German, then the Emperor's guards. Aelius Sejanus, lately joined with  his father Strabo in the command of the Praetorian bands, was also sent,  not only as Governor to the young Prince, but as his credit with the  Emperor was known to be mighty, to deal with the revolters by promises  and terrors. When Drusus approached, the legions, for show of respect,  marched out to meet him; not with the usual symptoms and shouts of  joy, nor with gay ensigns and arms glittering, but in a dress and  accoutrements hideous and squalid: in their countenances too, though  composed to sadness, were seen greater marks of sullenness and  contumacy.    As soon as he was within the camp, they secured the entrances with  guards, and in several quarters of it placed parties upon duty: the rest  crowded about the tribunal of Drusus, who stood beckoning with his hand  for silence. Here as often as they surveyed their own numbers and met  one another's resentful looks, they uttered their rage in horrible  cries: again, when upon the tribunal they beheld Caesar, awe and  trembling seized them: now, there prevailed an hollow and inarticulate  murmur; next, a furious clamour; then suddenly a dead silence: so that,  by a hasty succession of opposite passions, they were at once dismayed  and dreadful. When at last the uproar was stayed, he read his father's  letters, who in them declared, \"that he would take an affectionate  care of the brave and invincible legions by whom he had sustained  successfully so many wars; and, as soon as his grief was a little  abated, deal with the Senate about their demands; in the meantime he  had sent them his son, on purpose to make them forthwith all the  concessions, which could instantly be made them: the rest were to  be reserved for the Senate, the proper distributers of rewards and  punishments by a right altogether unalienable.\"    The assembly answered, that to Julius Clemens they had intrusted what  to speak in their name: he began with their demands, \"to be discharged  after sixteen years' service, to have the reward which, for past  services upon that discharge, they claimed; their pay to be increased  to a Roman denarius; the veterans to be no longer detained under their  ensigns.\" When Drusus urged, that wholly in the judgment of the Senate  and his father, these matters rested he was interrupted by their  clamours: \"To what purpose came he; since he could neither augment their  pay, nor alleviate their grievances? and while upon them every officer  was allowed to inflict blows and death, the son of their Emperor wanted  power to relieve them by one beneficent action. The policy this of the  late reign, when Tiberius frustrated every request of the soldiers, by  referring all to Augustus; now Drusus was come with the same artifices  to delude them: were they never to have a higher visit than from the  children of their Prince? It was, indeed, unaccountable, that to the  Senate the Emperor should leave no part in the direction of the army,  only the rewarding of the soldiery: ought not the same Senate to be  consulted as often as a battle was to be fought, or a private man to be  punished? or, were their recompenses to be adjudged by many masters,  but their punishments to remain without any restraint or moderator  whatsoever?\"    At last they abandoned the tribunal, and with menaces and insults fell  upon all they met belonging to Drusus, either as guards or friends;  meditating thus to provoke a quarrel, and an introduction to blood.  Chiefly enraged they were against Cneius Lentulus, as one for years and  warlike renown superior to any about the person of Drusus, and thence  suspected to have hardened the Prince, and been himself the foremost to  despise these outrages in the soldiery: nor was it long after, that as  he was leaving Drusus, and from the foresight of danger returning to the  winter quarters, they surrounded him and demanded \"whither he went? to  the Emperor or Senate? there also to exercise his enmity to the legions,  and oppose their interest?\" and instantly assaulted him with stones.  He was already covered with wounds and blood, and awaiting certain  assassination, when the troops attending Drusus flew to his assistance  and saved him.    The following night had a formidable aspect, and threatened the speedy  eruption of some tragical vengeance; when a phenomenon intervened and  assuaged all. The Moon, in the midst of a clear sky, seemed to the  soldiers suddenly to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7960"],[0,"Early European History (#11)"],[1," as 2000 B.C. Then they occupied the valley of the Ganges and so brought  all northern India under their control.    INDIA AND THE WEST    India did not remain entirely isolated from the rest of Asia, The Punjab  was twice conquered by invaders from the West; by the Persians in the  sixth century B.C., [3] and about two hundred years later by the Greeks.  [4] After the end of foreign rule India continued to be of importance  through its commerce, which introduced such luxuries as precious stones,  spices, and ivory among the western peoples.    NEARER ASIA    Nearer, or Western Asia, the smaller of the two grand divisions of the  Asiatic continent, is bounded by the Black and Caspian seas on the north,  by the Red Sea, Persian Gulf, and Indian Ocean on the south, eastward by  the Indus River, and westward by the Mediterranean and the Nile. Almost  all the countries within this area played a part in the ancient history of  the Orient.    COUNTRIES OF NEARER ASIA    The lofty plateaus of central Asia decline on the west into the lower but  still elevated region of Iran. The western part of Iran was occupied in  antiquity by the kindred people known as Medes and Persians. Armenia, a  wild and mountainous region, is an extension to the northwest of the  Iranian table-land. Beyond Armenia we cross into the peninsula of Asia  Minor, a natural link between Asia and Europe. Southward from Asia Minor  we pass along the Mediterranean coast through Syria to Arabia. The Arabian  peninsula may be regarded as the link between Asia and Africa.    INFLUENCE OF GEOGRAPHICAL CONDITIONS    These five countries of Nearer Asia were not well fitted to become centers  of early civilization. They possessed no great rivers which help to bring  people together, and no broad, fertile plains which support a large  population. Armenia, Asia Minor, and Syria were broken up into small  districts by chains of mountains. Iran and Arabia were chiefly barren  deserts. But two other divisions of Nearer Asia resembled distant India  and China in the possession of a warm climate, a fruitful soil, and an  extensive river system. These lands were Babylonia and Egypt, the first  homes of civilized man.      8. BABYLONIA AND EGYPT    THE TIGRIS AND THE EUPHRATES    Two famous rivers rise in the remote fastnesses of Armenia--the Tigris and  the Euphrates. As they flow southward, the twin streams approach each  other to form a common valley, and then proceed in parallel channels for  the greater part of their course. In antiquity each river emptied into the  Persian Gulf by a separate mouth. This Tigris-Euphrates valley was called  by the Greeks Mesopotamia, \"the land between the rivers.\"    PRODUCTIONS OF BABYLONIA    Babylonia is a remarkably productive country. The annual inundation of the  rivers has covered its once rocky bottom with deposits of rich silt. Crops  planted in such a soil, under the influence of a blazing sun, ripen with  great rapidity and yield abundant harvests. \"Of all the countries that we  know,\" says an old Greek traveler, \"there is no other so fruitful in  grain.\" [5] Wheat and barley were perhaps first domesticated in this part  of the world. [6] Wheat still grows wild there. Though Babylonia possessed  no forests, it had the date palm, which needed scarcely any cultivation.  If the alluvial soil yielded little stone, clay, on the other hand, was  everywhere. Molded into brick and afterwards dried in the sun, the clay  became _adobe_, the cheapest building material imaginable.    BABYLONIA AN EARLY CENTER OF CIVILIZATION    In Babylonia Nature seems to have done her utmost to make it easy for  People to gain a living. We can understand, therefore, why from  prehistoric times men have been attracted to this region, and why it is  here that we must look for one of the earliest seats of civilization. [7]    LOWER AND UPPER EGYPT    Egypt may be described as the valley of the Nile. Rising in the Nyanza  lakes of central Africa, that mighty stream, before entering Egypt,  receives the waters of the Blue Nile near the modern town of Khartum. From  this point the course of the river is broken by a series of five rocky  rapids, misnamed cataracts, which can be shot by boats. The cataracts  cease near the island of Philae, and Upper Egypt begins. This is a strip  of fertile territory, about five hundred miles in length but averaging  only eight miles in width. Not far from modern Cairo the hills inclosing  the valley fall away, the Nile divides into numerous branches, and Lower  Egypt, or the Delta, begins. The sluggish stream passes through a region  of mingled swamp and plain, and at length by three principal mouths  empties its waters into the Mediterranean.    [Illustration: PHILAE  The island was originally only a heap of granite bowlders. Retaining walls  were built around it, and the space within when filled with rich Nile mud,  became beautiful with groves of palms and mimosas. As the result of the  construction of the Assuan dam, Philae and its exquisite temples are now  submerged during the winter months, when the reservoir is full.]    EGYPT THE GIFT OF THE NILE    Egypt owes her existence to the Nile. All Lower Egypt is a creation of the  river by the gradual accumulation of sediment at its mouths. Upper Egypt  has been dug out of the desert sand and underlying rock by a process of  erosion centuries long. Once the Nile filled all the space between the  hills that line its sides. Now it flows through a thick layer of alluvial  mud deposited by the yearly inundation.    ANNUAL INUNDATION OF THE NILE    The Nile begins to rise in June, when the snow melts on the Abyssinian  mountains. High-water mark, some thirty feet above the ordinary level, is  reached in September. The inhabitants then make haste to cut the confining  dikes and to spread the fertilizing water over their fields. Egypt takes  on the appearance of a turbid lake, dotted here and there with island  villages and crossed in every direction by highways elevated above the  flood. Late in October the river begins to subside and by December has  returned to its normal level. As the water recedes, it deposits that  dressing of fertile vegetable mold which makes the soil of Egypt perhaps  the richest in the world. [8]    EGYPT AN EARLY CENTER OF CIVILIZATION    It was by no accident that Egypt, like Babylonia, became one of the first  homes of civilized men. Here, as there, every condition made it easy for  people to live and thrive. Food was cheap, for it was easily produced. The  peasant needed only to spread his seed broadcast over the muddy fields to  be sure of an abundant return. The warm, dry climate enabled him to get  along with little shelter and clothing. Hence the inhabitants of this  favored region rapidly increased in number and gathered in populous towns  and cities. At a time when most of their neighbors were still in the  darkness of the prehistoric age, the Egyptians had entered the light of  history.      9. THE BABYLONIANS AND THE EGYPTIANS    INHABITANTS OF BABYLONIA    The earliest inhabitants of Babylonia of whom we know anything were a  people called Sumerians. They entered the Babylonian plain through the  passes of the eastern mountains, three or four thousand years before the  Christian era. Here they formed a number of independent states, each with  its capital city, its patron god, and its king. After them came Semitic  tribes from the deserts of northern Arabia. The Semites mingled with the  Sumerians and adopted Sumerian civilization.    HAMMURABI, KING OF BABYLONIA, ABOUT 2000 B.C.    Of all the early Babylonian kings the most famous was Hammurabi. Some  inscriptions still remain to tell how he freed his country from foreign  invaders and made his native Babylon the capital of the entire land. This  city became henceforth the real center of the Euphrates valley, to which,  indeed, it gave its name. Hammurabi was also an able statesman, who sought  to develop the territories his sword had won. He dug great canals to  distribute the waters of the Euphrates and built huge granaries to store  the wheat against a time of famine. In Babylon he raised splendid temples  and palaces. For all his kingdom he published a code of laws, the oldest  in the world. [9] Thus Hammurabi, by making Babylonia so strong and  flourishing, was able to extend her influence in every direction. Her only  important rival was Egypt.    [Illustration: TOP OF MONUMENT CONTAINING THE CODE OF HAMMURABI (British  Museum, London)  A block of black diorite nearly 8 feet high, on which the code is chiseled  in 44 columns and over 3600 lines. The relief at the top of the monument  shows the Babylonian king receiving the laws from the sun god who is  seated at the right.]    The origin of the Egyptians is not known with certainty. In physical  characteristics they resembled the native tribes of northern and  inhabitants eastern Africa. Their language, however, shows of Egypt close  kinship to the Semitic tongues of western Asia and Arabia. It is probable  that the Egyptians, like the Babylonians, arose from the mingling of  several peoples.    MENES, KING OF EGYPT, ABOUT 3400 B.C.    The history of Egypt commences with the union of the two kingdoms of Upper  and Lower Egypt under Menes. An ancient tradition made him the builder of  Memphis, near the head of the Delta, and the founder of the Egyptian  monarchy. Scholars once doubted these exploits and even regarded Menes  himself as mythical. Recently, however, his tomb has been discovered. In  the gray dawn of history Menes appears as a real personage, the first of  that line of kings, or \"Pharaohs,\" who for nearly three thousand years  ruled over Egypt.    [Illustration: Map, EGYPTIAN EMPIRE About 1450 B.C.]    THE PYRAMID KINGS, ABOUT 3000-2500 B.C.    Several centuries after Menes we reach the age of the kings who raised the  pyramids. Probably no other rulers have ever stamped their memory so  indelibly on the pages of "]]]
