But some person, perhaps, will make an objection to one of the former  arguments. \"If men, from _superiority_ of their nature, cannot be  considered, like lands, goods, or houses, among possessions, so neither  can cattle: for being endued with life, motion, and sensibility, they  are evidently _superiour_ to these.\" But this objection will  receive its answer from those observations which have been already made;  and will discover the true reason, why cattle are justly to be estimated  as property. For first, the right to empire over brutes, is  _natural_, and not _adventitious_, like the right to empire  over men. There are, secondly, many and evident signs of the  _inferiority_ of their nature; and thirdly, their liberty can be  bought and sold, because, being void of reason, they cannot be  _accountable_ for their actions.    We might stop here for a considerable time, and deduce many valuable  lessons from the remarks that have been made, but that such a  circumstance might be considered as a digression. There is one, however,  which, as it is so intimately connected with the subject, we cannot but  deduce. We are taught to treat men in a different manner from brutes,  because they are so manifestly superiour in their nature; we are taught  to treat brutes in a different manner from stones, for the same reason;  and thus, by giving to every created thing its due respect, to answer  the views of Providence, which did not create a variety of natures  without a purpose or design.    But if these things are so, how evidently against reason, nature, and  every thing human and divine, must they act, who not only force men into  _slavery_, against their own _consent_; but treat them altogether  as _brutes_, and make the _natural liberty_ of man an article  of publick commerce! and by what arguments can they possibly  defend that commerce, which cannot be carried on, in any single  instance, without a flagrant violation of the laws of nature and of God?             *        *        *        *        *        CHAP. V.    That we may the more accurately examine the arguments that are advanced  on this occasion, it will be proper to divide the _commerce_ into  two parts; first, as it relates to those who _sell_, and secondly,  as it relates to those who _purchase_, the _human species_  into slavery. To the former part of which, having given every previous  and necessary information in the history of servitude, we shall  immediately proceed.    Let us inquire first, by what particular right the _liberties_ of  the harmless people are invaded by the _prince_. \"By the _right  of empire_,\" it will be answered; \"because he possesses dominion and  power by their own approbation and consent.\" But subjects, though under  the dominion, are not the _property_, of the prince. They cannot be  considered as his _possessions_. Their _natures_ are both the  same; they are both born in the same manner; are subject to the same  disorders; must apply to the same remedies for a cure; are equally  partakers of the grave: an _incidental_ distinction accompanies  them through life, and this--is all.    We may add to this, that though the prince possesses dominion and power,  by the consent and approbation of his subjects, he possesses it only for  the most _salutary_ ends. He may tyrannize, if he can: he may alter  the _form_ of his government: he cannot, however, alter its  _nature_ and _end_. These will be immutably the same, though  the whole system of its administration should be changed; and he will be  still bound to _defend_ the lives and properties of his subjects,  and to make them _happy_.    Does he defend those therefore, whom he invades at discretion with the  sword? Does he protect the property of those, whose houses and effects  he consigns at discretion to the flames? Does he make those happy, whom  he seizes, as they are trying to escape the general devastation, and  compels with their wives and families to a wretched _servitude?_ He  acts surely, as if the use of empire consisted in violence and  oppression; as if he, that was most exalted, ought, of necessity, to be  most unjust. Here then the voice of _nature_ and _justice_ is  against him. He breaks that law of _nature_, which ordains, \"that no  just man shall be given into slavery, against his own _consent_:\"  he violates the first law of _justice_, as established among men,  \"that no person shall do harm to another without a previous and  sufficient _provocation_;\" and he violates also the sacred  condition of _empire_, made with his ancestors, and necessarily  understood in every species of government, \"that, the power of the  multitude being given up to the wisdom and justice of the prince, they  may experience, in return, the most effectual protection from injury,  the highest advantages of society, the greatest possible  _happiness_.\"    But if kings then, to whom their own people have granted dominion and  power, are unable to invade the liberties of their harmless subjects,  without the highest _injustice_; how can those private persons be  justified, who treacherously lie in wait for their fellow-creatures, and  sell them into slavery? What arguments can they possibly bring in  their defence? What treaty of empire can they produce, by which their  innocent victims ever resigned to them the least portion of their  _liberty_? In vain will they plead the _antiquity_ of the  custom: in vain will the _honourable_ light, in which _piracy_  was considered in the ages of barbarism, afford them an excuse. Impious  and abandoned men! ye invade the liberties of those, who, (with respect  to your impious selves) are in a state of _nature_, in a state of  original _dissociation_, perfectly _independent_, perfectly  _free_.    It appears then, that the two orders of slaves, which have been  mentioned in the history of the African servitude, \"of those who are  publickly seized by virtue of the authority of their prince; and of  those, who are privately kidnapped by individuals,\" are collected by  means of violence and oppression; by means, repugnant to _nature_,  the principles of _government_, and the common notions of  _equity_, as established among men.             *        *        *        *        *        CHAP. VI.    We come now to the third order of _involuntary_ slaves, \"to  convicts.\" The only argument that the sellers advance here, is this,  \"that they have been found guilty of offences, and that the punishment  is just.\" But before the equity of the sentence can be allowed two  questions must be decided, whether the punishment is _proportioned_  to the offence, and what is its particular _object_ and _end_?    To decide the first, we may previously observe, that the African  servitude comprehends _banishment_, a _deprivation_ of _liberty_,  and many _corporal_ sufferings.    On _banishment_, the following observations will suffice. Mankind  have their _local_ attachments. They have a particular regard for  the spot, in which they were born and nurtured. Here it was, that they  first drew their infant-breath: here, that they were cherished and  supported: here, that they passed those scenes of childhood, which, free  from care and anxiety, are the happiest in the life of man; scenes,  which accompany them through life; which throw themselves frequently  into their thoughts, and produce the most agreeable sensations. These  then are weighty considerations; and how great this regard is, may be  evidenced from our own feelings; from the testimony of some, who, when  remote from their country, and, in the hour of danger and distress, have  found their thoughts unusually directed, by some impulse or other, to  their native spot; and from the example of others, who, having braved  the storms and adversities of life, either repair to it for the  remainder of their days, or desire even to be conveyed to it, when  existence is no more.    But separately from these their _local_, they have also their  _personal_ attachments; their regard for particular men. There are  ties of blood; there are ties of friendship. In the former case, they  must of necessity be attached: the constitution of their nature demands  it. In the latter, it is impossible to be otherwise, since friendship is  founded on an harmony of temper, on a concordance of sentiments and  manners, on habits of confidence, and a mutual exchange of favours.    We may now mention, as perfectly distinct both from their _local_  and_ personal_, the _national_ attachments of mankind, their  regard for the whole body of the people, among whom they were born and  educated. This regard is particularly conspicuous in the conduct of  such, as, being thus _nationally_ connected, reside in foreign  parts. How anxiously do they meet together! how much do they enjoy the  fight of others of their countrymen, whom fortune places in their way!  what an eagerness do they show to serve them, though not born on the  same particular spot, though not connected by consanguinity or  friendship, though unknown to them before! Neither is this affection  wonderful, since they are creatures of the same education; of the same  principles; of the same manners and habits; cast, as it were, in the  same mould; and marked with the same impression.    If men therefore are thus separately attached to the several objects  described, it is evident that a separate exclusion from either must  afford them considerable pain. What then must be their sufferings, to be  forced for ever from their country, which includes them all? Which  contains the _spot_, in which they were born and nurtured; which  contains their _relations_ and _friends_; which contains the  whole body of the _people_, among whom they were bred and educated.  In these sufferings, which arise to men, both in bidding, and in having "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10633"],[0,"The History of the Rise, Progress and Accomplishment of the Abolition of the (#12)"],[1," over to France. Labat, a Roman missionary, in  his account of the isles of America, mentions that Louis the Thirteenth  was very uneasy when he was about to issue the edict by which all  Africans coming into his colonies were to be made slaves, and that this  uneasiness continued till he was assured that the introduction of them  in this capacity into his foreign dominions was the readiest way of  converting them to the principles of the Christian religion.    These, then, were the first forerunners in the great cause of the  abolition of the Slave Trade: nor have their services towards it been of  small moment; for, in the first place, they have enabled those who came  after them, and who took an active interest in the same cause, to state  the great authority of their opinions and of their example. They have  enabled them, again, to detail the history connected with these, in  consequence of which circumstances have been laid open which it is of  great importance to know; for have they not enabled them to state that  the African Slave Trade never would have been permitted to exist but for  the ignorance of those in authority concerning it--that at its  commencement there was a revolting of nature against it--a suspicion, a  caution, a fear, both as to its unlawfulness and its effects? Have they  not enabled them to state that falsehoods were advanced, and these  concealed under the mask of religion, to deceive those who had the power  to suppress it? Have they not enabled them to state that this trade  began in piracy, and that it was continued upon the principles of force?  And, finally, have not they who have been enabled to make these  statements, knowing all the circumstances connected with them, found  their own zeal increased, and their own courage and perseverance  strengthened; and have they not, by the communication of them to others,  produced many friends and even labourers in the cause?          CHAPTER III.    Forerunners continued to 1787; divided from this time into four  classes.--First class consists principally of persons in Great Britain  of various descriptions: Godwyn; Baxter; Tryon; Southern; Primatt;  Montesquieu; Hutcheson; Sharp; Ramsay; and a multitude of others,  whose names and services follow.      I have hitherto traced the history of the forerunners in this great  cause only up to about the year 1640. If I am to pursue my plan, I am to  trace it to the year 1787. But in order to show what I intend in a  clearer point of view, I shall divide those who have lived within this  period, and who will now consist of persons in a less elevated station,  into four classes: and I shall give to each class a distinct  consideration by itself.    Several of our old English writers, though they have not mentioned the  African Slave Trade, or the slavery consequent upon it, in their  respective works, have yet given their testimony of condemnation against  both. Thus our great Milton:--        O execrable son, so to aspire,    Above his brethren, to himself assuming    Authority usurpt, from God not given;    He gave us only over beast, fish, fowl,    Dominion absolute; that right we hold    By his donation; but man over men    He made not lord, such title to himself    Reserving, human left from human free.      I might mention Bishop Saunderson and others, who bore a testimony  equally strong against the lawfulness of trading in the persons of men,  and of holding them in bondage; but as I mean to confine myself to those  who have favoured the cause of the Africans specifically, I cannot admit  their names into any of the classes which have been announced.    Of those, who compose the first class, defined as it has now been, I  cannot name any individual who took a part in this cause till between  the years 1670 and 1680; for in the year 1640, and for a few years  afterwards, the nature of the trade and of the slavery was but little  known, except to a few individuals, who were concerned in them; and it  is obvious that these would neither endanger their own interest nor  proclaim their own guilt by exposing it. The first, whom I shall mention  is Morgan Godwyn, a clergyman of the established church. This pious  divine wrote a treatise upon the subject, which he dedicated to the then  archbishop of Canterbury. He gave it to the world, at the time  mentioned, under the title of \"_The Negroes' and Indians' Advocate._\" In  this treatise he lays open the situation of these oppressed people, of  whose sufferings he had been an eye-witness in the island of Barbados.  He calls forth the pity of the reader in an affecting manner, and  exposes with a nervous eloquence the brutal sentiments and conduct of  their oppressors. This seems to have been the first work undertaken in  England expressly in favour of the cause.    The next person, whom I shall mention, is Richard Baxter, the celebrated  divine among the nonconformists. In his _Christian Directory_, published  about the same time as _The Negroes' and Indians' Advocate_, he gives  advice to those masters in foreign plantations, who have negroes and  other slaves. In this he protests loudly against this trade. He says  expressly that they, who go out as pirates, and take away poor Africans,  or people of another land, who never forfeited life or liberty, and make  them slaves and sell them, are the worst of robbers, and ought to be  considered as the common enemies of mankind; and that they who buy them,  and use them as mere beasts for their own convenience, regardless of  their spiritual welfare, are fitter to be called demons than christians.  He then proposes several queries, which he answers in a clear and  forcible manner, showing the great inconsistency of this traffic, and  the necessity of treating those then in bondage with tenderness and a  due regard to their spiritual concerns.    The _Directory_ of Baxter was succeeded by a publication called  _Friendly Advice to the Planters_ in three parts. The first of these  was, _A brief Treatise of the principal Fruits and Herbs that grow in  Barbados, Jamaica, and other Plantations in the West Indies_. The second  was, _The Negroes' Complaint, or their hard Servitude, and the Cruelties  practised upon them by divers of their Masters professing Christianity_.  And the third was, _A Dialogue between an Ethiopian and a Christian, his  Master, in America_. In the last of these, Thomas Tryon, who was the  author, inveighs both against the commerce and the slavery of the  Africans, and in a striking manner examines each by the touchstone of  reason, humanity, justice, and religion.    In the year 1696, Southern brought forward his celebrated tragedy of  _Oronooko_, by means of which many became enlightened upon the subject,  and interested in it. For this tragedy was not a representation of  fictitious circumstances, but of such as had occurred in the colonies,  and as had been communicated in a publication by Mrs. Behn.    The person who seems to have noticed the subject next was Dr. Primatt.  In his _Dissertation on the Duty of Mercy, and on the Sin of Cruelty to  Brute Animals_, he takes occasion to advert to the subject of the  African Slave Trade. \"It has pleased God,\" says he, \"to cover some men  with white skins and others with black; but as there is neither merit  nor demerit in complexion, the white man, notwithstanding the barbarity  of custom and prejudice, can have no right by virtue of his colour to  enslave and tyrannize over the black man. For whether a man be white or  black, such he is by God's appointment, and, abstractly considered, is  neither a subject for pride, nor an object of contempt.\"    After Dr. Primatt, we come to Baron Montesquieu, \"Slavery,\" says he, \"is  not good in itself. It is neither useful to the master nor to the slave;  not to the slave, because he can do nothing from virtuous motives; not  to the master, because he contracts among his slaves all sorts of bad  habits, and accustoms himself to the neglect of all the moral virtues.  He becomes haughty, passionate, obdurate, vindictive, voluptuous, and  cruel.\" And with respect to this particular species of slavery, he  proceeds to say, \"It is impossible to allow the negroes are men,  because, if we allow them to be men, it will begin to be believed that  we ourselves are not Christians.\"    Hutcheson, in his _System of Moral Philosophy_, endeavours to show, that  he who detains another by force in slavery, can make no good title to  him, and adds, \"Strange that in any nation where a sense of liberty  prevails, and where the Christian religion is professed, custom and high  prospect of gain can so stupify the consciences of men, and all sense of  natural justice, that they can hear such computations made about the  value of their fellow-men and their liberty, without abhorrence and  indignation!\"    Foster, in his _Discourses on Natural Religion and Social Virtue_, calls  the slavery under our consideration \"a criminal and outrageous violation  of the natural rights of mankind.\" I am sorry that I have not room to  say all that he says on this subject. Perhaps the following beautiful  extracts may suffice:--          \"But notwithstanding this, we ourselves, who profess to be      Christians, and boast of the peculiar advantages we enjoy by      means of an express revelation of our duty from heaven, are in      effect these very untaught and rude heathen countries. With all      our superior light, we instil into those whom we call savage and      barbarous, the most despicable opinion of human nature. We, to      the utmost of our power, weaken and dissolve the universal tie      that binds and unites mankind. We practise what we should      exclaim against as the utmost excess of cruelty and tyranny, if      nations of the world, differing in colour and form of government      from ourselves, were so possessed of empire as to be able to      reduce us to a state of unmerited and brutish servitude.
