But such misuse of the  Will brings pain and unrest to the user, and he is eventually driven into  the right road.    We do not expect our students to grasp fully this idea of the Expansion  of Self. Even the highest grasp it only partially. But until you get a  glimmering of the consciousness you will not be able to progress far  on the path of Raja Yoga. You must understand _what you are_, before you  are able to use the power that lies dormant within you. You must realize  that you are the Master, before you can claim the powers of the Master,  and expect to have your commands obeyed. So bear patiently with us, your  Teachers, while we set before you the lessons to be learned--the tasks to  be performed. The road is long, and is rough in places--the feet may  become tired and bruised, but the reward is great, and there are resting  places along the path. Be not discouraged if your progress seem slow, for  the soul must unfold naturally as does the flower, without haste, without  force.    And be not dismayed nor affrighted if you occasionally catch a glimpse  of your higher self. As \"M.C.\" says, in her notes on \"Light on the Path\"  (see \"Advanced Course,\" page 95): \"To have seen thy soul in its bloom, is  to have obtained a momentary glimpse in thyself of the transfiguration  which shall eventually make thee more than man; to recognize, is to  achieve the great task of gazing upon the blazing light without dropping  the eyes, and not falling back in terror as though before some ghastly  phantom. This happens to some, and so, when the victory is all but won,  it is lost.\"    Peace be with thee.      MANTRAM (AFFIRMATION) FOR THE THIRD LESSON.    There is but one ultimate form of Matter; one ultimate form of Energy;  one ultimate form of Mind. Matter proceeds from Energy, and Energy from  Mind, and all are an emanation of the Absolute, threefold in appearance  but One in substance. There is but One Life, and that permeates the  Universe, manifesting in various forms, but being, at the last, but One.  My body is one with Universal Matter; My energy and vital force is one  with the Universal Energy; My Mind is one with the Universal Mind; My  Life is one with the Universal Life. The Absolute has expressed and  manifested itself in Spirit, which is the real \"I\" overshadowing and  embracing all the apparently separate \"I\"s. \"I\" feel my identity with  Spirit and realize the Oneness of All Reality. I feel my unity with all  Spirit, and my Union (through Spirit) with the Absolute. I realize that  \"I\" am an Expression and Manifestation of the Absolute, and that its  very essence is within me. I am filled with Divine Love. I am filled with  Divine Power. I am filled with Divine Wisdom. I am conscious of identity  in spirit, in substance; and in nature; with the One Reality.          THE FOURTH LESSON.    MENTAL CONTROL.      In our first three lessons of this series, we have endeavored to bring  into realization within your mind (1) the consciousness of the \"I\"; its  independence from the body; its immortality; its invincibility and  invulnerability; (2) the superiority of the \"I\" over the mind, as well as  over the body; the fact that the mind is not the \"I,\" but is merely an  instrument for the expression of the \"I\"; the fact that the \"I\" is master  of the mind, as well as of the body; that the \"I\" is behind all thought;  that the \"I\" can set aside for consideration the sensations, emotions,  passions, desires, and the rest of the mental phenomena, and still  realize that it, the \"I,\" is apart from these mental manifestations, and  remains unchanged, real and fully existent; that the \"I\" can set aside  any and all of its mental tools and instruments, as \"not I\" things, and  still consciously realize that after so setting them aside there remains  something--itself--the \"I\" which cannot be set aside or taken from; that  the \"I\" is the master of the mind, and not its slave; (3) that the \"I\" is  a much greater thing than the little personal \"I\" we have been  considering it to be; that the \"I\" is a part of that great One Reality  which pervades all the Universe; that it is connected with all other  forms of life by countless ties, mental and spiritual filaments and  relations; that the \"I\" is a Centre of Consciousness in that great One  Reality or Spirit, which is behind and back of all Life and Existence,  the Centre of which Reality or Existence, is the Absolute or God; that  the sense of Reality that is inherent in the \"I,\" is really the  reflection of the sense of Reality inherent in the Whole--the Great \"I\"  of the Universe.    The underlying principle of these three lessons is the Reality of the  \"I,\" in itself, over and above all Matter, Force, or Mind--positive to  all of them, just as they are positive or negative to each other--and  negative only to the Centre of the One--the Absolute itself. And this is  the position for the Candidate or Initiate to take: \"I am positive to  Mind, Energy, and Matter, and control them all--I am negative only to the  Absolute, which is the Centre of Being, of which Being I Am. And, as I  assert my mastery over Mind, Energy, and Matter, and exercise my Will  over them, so do I acknowledge my subordination to the Absolute, and  gladly open my soul to the inflow of the Divine Will, and partake of its  Power, Strength, and Wisdom.\"    In the present lesson, and those immediately following it, we shall  endeavor to assist the Candidate or Initiate in acquiring a mastery of  the subordinate manifestations, Matter, Energy, and Mind. In order to  acquire and assert this mastery, one must acquaint himself with the  nature of the thing to be controlled.    In our \"Advanced Course\" we have endeavored to explain to you the nature  of the Three Great Manifestations, known as _Chitta_, or Mind-Substance;  _Prana_, or Energy; and _Akasa_, or the Principle of Matter. We also  explained to you that the \"I\" of man is superior to these three, being  what is known as _Atman_ or Spirit. Matter, Energy, and Mind, as we have  explained, are manifestations of the Absolute, and are relative things.  The Yogi philosophy teaches that Matter is the grossest form of  manifested substance, being below Energy and Mind, and consequently  negative to, and subordinate to both. One stage higher than Matter, is  Energy or Force, which is positive to, and has authority over, Matter  (Matter being a still grosser form of substance), but which is negative  to and subordinate to Mind, which is a still higher form of substance.  Next in order comes the highest of the three--Mind--the finest form of  substance, and which dominates both Energy and Matter, being positive to  both. Mind, however is negative and subordinate to the \"I,\" which is  Spirit, and obeys the orders of the latter when firmly and intelligently  given. The \"I\" itself is subordinate only to the Absolute--the Centre of  Being--the \"I\" being positive and dominant over the threefold  manifestation of Mind, Energy, and Matter.    The \"I,\" which for the sake of the illustration must be regarded as a  separate thing (although it is really only a Centre of Consciousness in  the great body of Spirit), finds itself surrounded by the triple-ocean of  Mind, Energy and Matter, which ocean extends into Infinity. The body is  but a physical form through which flows an unending stream of matter,  for, as you know the particles and atoms of the body are constantly  changing; being renewed; replaced; thrown off, and supplanted. One's body  of a few years ago, or rather the particles composing that body, have  passed off and now form new combinations in the world of matter. And  one's body of to-day is passing away and being replaced by new particles.  And one's body of next year is now occupying some other portion of space,  and its particles are now parts of countless other combinations, from  which space and combinations they will later come to combine and form the  body of next year. There is nothing permanent about the body--even the  particles of the bones are being constantly replaced by others. And  so it is with the Vital Energy, Force, or Strength of the body (including  that of the brain). It is constantly being used up, and expended, a fresh  supply taking its place. And even the Mind of the person is changeable,  and the Mind-substance or _Chitta_, is being used up and replenished, the  new supply coming from the great Ocean of Mind, into which the discarded  portion slips, just as is the case with the matter and energy.    While the majority of our students, who are more or less familiar with  the current material scientific conceptions, will readily accept the  above idea of the ocean of Matter, and Energy, and the fact that there  is a continual using up and replenishing of one's store of both, they may  have more or less trouble in accepting the idea that Mind is a substance  or principle amenable to the same general laws as are the other two  manifestations, or attributes of substance. One is so apt to think of his  Mind as \"himself\"--the \"I.\" Notwithstanding the fact that in our Second  Lesson of this series we showed you that the \"I\" is superior to the  mental states, and that it can set them aside and regard and consider  them as \"not-I\" things, yet the force of the habit of thought is very  strong, and it may take some of you considerable time before you \"get  into the way\" of realizing that your Mind is \"something that you use,\"  instead of being You--yourself. And yet, you must persevere in attaining  this realization, for in the degree that you realize your dominance over  your mind, so will be your control of it, and its amenability to that  control. And, as is the degree of that dominance and control, so will  be the character, grade and extent of the work that your Mind will do for  you. So you see: _Realization brings Control_--_and Control brings  results_.

The moon was bright, but they were in the shadow of some trees, and  their son did not see them. He came singing in the moonlight, and his  face shining.        CHAPTER VIII    While the burgomaster was exposing Gerard at Tergou, Margaret had a  trouble of her own at Sevenbergen. It was a housewife's distress, but  deeper than we can well conceive. She came to Martin Wittenhaagen, the  old soldier, with tears in her eyes.    \"Martin, there's nothing in the house, and Gerard is coming, and he is  so thoughtless. He forgets to sup at home. When he gives over work, then  he runs to me straight, poor soul; and often he comes quite faint. And  to think I have nothing to set before my servant that loves me so dear.\"    Martin scratched his head. \"What can I do?\"    \"It is Thursday; it is your day to shoot; sooth to Say, I counted on you  to-day.\"    \"Nay,\" said the soldier, \"I may not shoot when the Duke or his friends  are at the chase; read else. I am no scholar.\" And he took out of his  pouch a parchment with a grand seal. It purported to be a stipend and a  licence given by Philip, Duke of Burgundy, to Martin Wittenhaagen, one  of his archers, in return for services in the wars, and for a wound  received at the Dukes side. The stipend was four merks yearly, to be  paid by the Duke's almoner, and the licence was to shoot three arrows  once a week, viz., on Thursday, and no other day, in any of the Duke's  forests in Holland, at any game but a seven-year-old buck or a doe  carrying fawn; proviso, that the Duke should not be hunting on that day,  or any of his friends. In this case Martin was not to go and disturb the  woods on peril of his salary and his head, and a fine of a penny.    Margaret sighed and was silent.    \"Come, cheer up, mistress,\" said he; \"for your sake I'll peril my  carcass; I have done that for many a one that was not worth your  forefinger. It is no such mighty risk either. I'll but step into the  skirts of the forest here. It is odds but they drive a hare or a fawn  within reach of my arrow.\"    \"Well, if I let you go, you must promise me not to go far, and not to  be seen; far better Gerard went supperless than ill should come to you,  faithful Martin.\"    The required promise given, Martin took his bow and three arrows, and  stole cautiously into the wood: it was scarce a furlong distant. The  horns were heard faintly in the distance, and all the game was afoot.  \"Come,\" thought Martin, \"I shall soon fill the pot, and no one be the  wiser.\" He took his stand behind a thick oak that commanded a view of  an open glade, and strung his bow, a truly formidable weapon. It was  of English yew, six feet two inches high, and thick in proportion; and  Martin, broad-chested, with arms all iron and cord, and used to the bow  from infancy, could draw a three-foot arrow to the head, and, when  it flew, the eye could scarce follow it, and the bowstring twanged as  musical as a harp. This bow had laid many a stout soldier low in the  wars of the Hoecks and Cabbel-jaws. In those days a battlefield was not  a cloud of smoke; the combatants were few, but the deaths many--for they  saw what they were about; and fewer bloodless arrows flew than bloodless  bullets now. A hare came cantering, then sat sprightly, and her ears  made a capital V. Martin levelled his tremendous weapon at her. The  arrow flew, the string twanged; but Martin had been in a hurry to pot  her, and lost her by an inch: the arrow seemed to hit her, but it struck  the ground close to her, and passed under her belly like a flash, and  hissed along the short grass and disappeared. She jumped three feet  perpendicular and away at the top of her speed. \"Bungler!\" said Martin.  A sure proof he was not an habitual bungler, or he would have blamed  the hare. He had scarcely fitted another arrow to his string when a  wood-pigeon settled on the very tree he stood under. \"Aha!\" thought he,  \"you are small, but dainty.\" This time he took more pains; drew his arrow  carefully, loosed it smoothly, and saw it, to all appearance, go clean  through the bird, carrying feathers skyward like dust. Instead of  falling at his feet, the bird, whose breast was torn, not fairly  pierced, fluttered feebly away, and, by a great effort, rose above the  trees, flew some fifty yards and dead at last; but where, he could not  see for the thick foliage.    \"Luck is against me,\" said he despondingly. But he fitted another arrow,  and eyed the glade keenly. Presently he heard a bustle behind him, and  turned round just in time to see a noble buck cross the open, but too  late to shoot at him. He dashed his bow down with an imprecation. At  that moment a long spotted animal glided swiftly across after the deer;  its belly seemed to touch the ground as it went. Martin took up his bow  hastily: he recognized the Duke's leopard. \"The hunters will not be far  from her,\" said he, \"and I must not be seen. Gerard must go supperless  this night.\"    He plunged into the wood, following the buck and leopard, for that was  his way home. He had not gone far when he heard an unusual sound ahead  of him--leaves rustling violently and the ground trampled. He hurried in  the direction. He found the leopard on the buck's back, tearing him  with teeth and claw, and the buck running in a circle and bounding  convulsively, with the blood pouring down his hide. Then Martin formed a  desperate resolution to have the venison for Margaret. He drew his arrow  to the head, and buried it in the deer, who, spite of the creature on  his back, bounded high into the air, and fell dead. The leopard went on  tearing him as if nothing had happened.    Martin hoped that the creature would gorge itself with blood, and then  let him take the meat. He waited some minutes, then walked resolutely  up, and laid his hand on the buck's leg. The leopard gave a frightful  growl, and left off sucking blood. She saw Martin's game, and was  sulky and on her guard. What was to be done? Martin had heard that wild  creatures cannot stand the human eye. Accordingly, he stood erect, and  fixed his on the leopard: the leopard returned a savage glance, and  never took her eye off Martin. Then Martin continuing to look the beast  down, the leopard, brutally ignorant of natural history, flew at his  head with a frightful yell, flaming eyes, and jaws and distended. He had  but just time to catch her by the throat, before her teeth could crush  his face; one of her claws seized his shoulder and rent it, the other,  aimed at his cheek, would have been more deadly still, but Martin was  old-fashioned, and wore no hat, but a scapulary of the same stuff as his  jerkin, and this scapulary he had brought over his head like a hood; the  brute's claw caught in the loose leather. Martin kept her teeth off his  face with great difficulty, and griped her throat fiercely, and she  kept rending his shoulder. It was like blunt reaping-hooks grinding and  tearing. The pain was fearful; but, instead of cowing the old soldier,  it put his blood up, and he gnashed his teeth with rage almost as fierce  as hers, and squeezed her neck with iron force. The two pair of eyes  flared at one another--and now the man's were almost as furious as the  brute's. She found he was throttling her, and made a wild attempt  to free herself, in which she dragged his cowl all over his face and  blinded him, and tore her claw out of his shoulder, flesh and all; but  still he throttled her with hand and arm of iron. Presently her  long tail, that was high in the air, went down. \"Aha!\" cried Martin,  joyfully, and gripped her like death; next, her body lost its  elasticity, and he held a choked and powerless thing: he gripped it  still, till all motion ceased, then dashed it to the earth; then,  panting, removed his cowl: the leopard lay mute at his feet with tongue  protruding and bloody paw; and for the first time terror fell on Martin.  \"I am a dead man: I have slain the Duke's leopard.\" He hastily seized  a few handfuls of leaves and threw them over her; then shouldered the  buck, and staggered away, leaving a trail of blood all the way his own  and the buck's. He burst into Peter's house a horrible figure, bleeding  and bloodstained, and flung the deer's carcass down.    \"There--no questions,\" said he, \"but broil me a steak on't, for I am  faint.\"    Margaret did not see he was wounded; she thought the blood was all from  the deer.    She busied herself at the fire, and the stout soldier stanched and bound  his own wound apart; and soon he and Gerard and Margaret were supping  royally on broiled venison.    They were very merry; and Gerard, with wonderful thoughtfulness, had  brought a flask of Schiedam, and under its influence Martin revived,  and told them how the venison was got; and they all made merry over the  exploit.    Their mirth was strangely interrupted. Margaret's eye became fixed and  fascinated, and her cheek pale with fear. She gasped, and could not  speak, but pointed to the window with trembling finger. Their eyes  followed hers, and there in the twilight crouched a dark form with eyes  "]]]
