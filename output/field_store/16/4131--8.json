He must also form a clear conception of the special duties to be  fulfilled by the nation, the guidance of whose fortunes rests in his  hands. He must clearly and definitely formulate these duties as the  fixed goal of statesmanship. When he is absolutely clear upon this point  he can judge in each particular case what corresponds to the true  interests of the State; then only can he act systematically in the  definite prospect of smoothing the paths of politics, and securing  favourable conditions for the inevitable conflicts; then only, when the  hour for combat strikes and the decision to fight faces him, can he rise  with a free spirit and a calm breast to that standpoint which Luther  once described in blunt, bold language: \"It is very true that men write  and say often what a curse war is. But they ought to consider how much  greater is that curse which is averted by war. Briefly, in the business  of war men must not regard the massacres, the burnings, the battles, and  the marches, etc.--that is what the petty and simple do who only look  with the eyes of children at the surgeon, how he cuts off the hand or  saws off the leg, but do not see or notice that he does it in order to  save the whole body. Thus we must look at the business of war or the  sword with the eyes of men, asking, Why these murders and horrors? It  will be shown that it is a business, divine in itself, and as needful  and necessary to the world as eating or drinking, or any other work.\"[O]    [Footnote O: Luther, \"Whether soldiers can be in a state of salvation.\"]    Thus in order to decide what paths German policy must take in order to  further the interests of the German people, and what possibilities of  war are involved, we must first try to estimate the problems of State  and of civilization which are to be solved, and discover what political  purposes correspond to these problems.          CHAPTER III        A BRIEF SURVEY OF GERMANY'S HISTORICAL  DEVELOPMENT    The life of the individual citizen is valuable only when it is  consciously and actively employed for the attainment of great ends. The  same holds good of nations and States. They are, as it were,  personalities in the framework of collective humanity, infinitely  various in their endowments and their characteristic qualities, capable  of the most different achievements, and serving the most multifarious  purposes in the great evolution of human existence.    Such a theory will not be accepted from the standpoint of the  materialistic philosophy which prevails among wide circles of our nation  to-day.    According to it, all that happens in the world is a necessary  consequence of given conditions; free will is only necessity become  conscious. It denies the difference between the empiric and the  intelligible Ego, which is the basis of the notion of moral freedom.    This philosophy cannot stand before scientific criticism. It seems  everywhere arbitrarily restricted by the narrow limits of the  insufficient human intelligence. The existence of the universe is  opposed to the law of a sufficient cause; infinity and eternity are  incomprehensible to our conceptions, which are confined to space and  time.    The essential nature of force and volition remains inexplicable. We  recognize only a subjectively qualified phenomenon in the world; the  impelling forces and the real nature of things are withdrawn from our  understanding. A systematic explanation of the universe is quite  impossible from the human standpoint. So much seems clear--although no  demonstrable certainty attaches to this theory--that spiritual laws  beyond the comprehension of us men govern the world according to a  conscious plan of development in the revolving cycles of a perpetual  change. Even the gradual evolution of mankind seems ruled by a hidden  moral law. At any rate we recognize in the growing spread of  civilization and common moral ideas a gradual progress towards purer and  higher forms of life.    It is indeed impossible for us to prove design and purpose in every  individual case, because our attitude to the universal whole is too  limited and anomalous. But within the limitations of our knowledge of  things and of the inner necessity of events we can at least try to  understand in broad outlines the ways of Providence, which we may also  term the principles of development. We shall thus obtain useful guidance  for our further investigation and procedure.    The agency and will of Providence are most clearly seen in the history  of the growth of species and races, of peoples and States. \"What is  true,\" Goethe once said in a letter to Zelter, \"can but be raised and  supported by its history; what is false only lowered and dissipated by  its history.\"    The formation of peoples and races, the rise and fall of States, the  laws which govern the common life, teach us to recognize which forces  have a creative, sustaining, and beneficent influence, and which work  towards disintegration, and thus produce inevitable downfall. We are  here following the working of universal laws, but we must not forget  that States are personalities endowed with very different human  attributes, with a peculiar and often very marked character, and that  these subjective qualities are distinct factors in the development of  States as a whole. Impulses and influences exercise a very different  effect on the separate national individualities. We must endeavour to  grasp history in the spirit of the psychologist rather than of the  naturalist. Each nation must be judged from its own standpoint if we  wish to learn the general trend of its development. We must study the  history of the German people in its connection with that of the other  European States, and ask first what paths its development has hitherto  followed, and what guidance the past gives for Our future policy. From  the time of their first appearance in history the Germans showed  themselves a first-class civilized people.    When the Roman Empire broke up before the onslaught of the barbarians  there were two main elements which shaped the future of the West,  Christianity and the Germans. The Christian teaching preached equal  rights for all men and community of goods in an empire of masters and  slaves, but formulated the highest moral code, and directed the  attention of a race, which only aimed at luxury, to the world beyond the  grave as the true goal of existence. It made the value of man as man,  and the moral development of personality according to the laws of the  individual conscience, the starting-point of all development. It thus  gradually transformed the philosophy of the ancient world, whose  morality rested solely on the relations with the state. Simultaneously  with this, hordes of Germans from the thickly-populated North poured  victoriously in broad streams over the Roman Empire and the decaying  nations of the Ancient World. These masses could not keep their  nationality pure and maintain their position as political powers. The  States which they founded were short-lived. Even then men recognized how  difficult it is for a lower civilization to hold its own against a  higher. The Germans were gradually merged in the subject nations. The  German element, however, instilled new life into these nations, and  offered new opportunities for growth. The stronger the admixture of  German blood, the more vigorous and the more capable of civilization did  the growing nations appear.    In the meantime powerful opponents sprung up in this newly-formed world.  The Latin race grew up by degrees out of the admixture of the Germans  with the Roman world and the nations subdued by them, and separated  itself from the Germans, who kept themselves pure on the north of the  Alps and in the districts of Scandinavia. At the same time the idea of  the Universal Empire, which the Ancient World had embraced, continued to  flourish.    In the East the Byzantine Empire lasted until A.D. 1453. In the West,  however, the last Roman Emperor had been deposed by Odoacer in 476.  Italy had fallen into the hands of the East Goths and Lombards  successively. The Visigoths had established their dominion in Spain, and  the Franks and Burgundians in Gaul.    A new empire rose from the latter quarter. Charles the Great, with his  powerful hand, extended the Frankish Empire far beyond the boundaries of  Gaul. By the subjugation of the Saxons he became lord of the country  between the Rhine and the Elbe; he obtained the sovereignty in Italy by  the conquest of the Lombards, and finally sought to restore the Western  Roman Empire. He was crowned Emperor in Rome in the year 800. His  successors clung to this claim; but the Frankish Empire soon fell to  pieces. In its partition the western half formed what afterwards became  France, and the East Frankish part of the Empire became the later  Germany. While the Germans in the West Frankish Empire, in Italy and  Spain, had abandoned their speech and customs, and had gradually  amalgamated with the Romans, the inhabitants of the East Frankish  Empire, especially the Saxons and their neighbouring tribes, maintained  their Germanic characteristics, language, and customs. A powerful  German [A] kingdom arose which renewed the claims of Charles the Great to  the Western Roman Empire. Otto the Great was the first _German_ King who  took this momentous step. It involved him and his successors in a  quarrel with the Bishops of Rome, who wished to be not only Heads of the  Church, but lords of Italy, and did not hesitate to falsify archives in  order to prove their pretended title to that country.    [Footnote A: German (Deutsch=diutisk) signifies originally \"popular,\"  opposed to \"foreign\"--_e.g._, the Latin Church dialect. It was first  used as the name of a people, in the tenth century A.D.]    The Popes made good this right, but they did not stop there.

As the name implies, the plant is smooth, except for the chaffy scales at  or near the rootstock, which mark all the Woodsias, and many other ferns,  and which serve as a protective covering against sudden changes in extremes  of heat and cold.    (5) OREGON WOODSIA. _Woodsia oregana_    Fronds two to ten inches high, smooth, bright green, glandular beneath,  narrowly lance-oblong, bipinnatifid. Pinnse triangular-oblong, obtuse,  pinnatifid. Segments ovate or oblong, obtuse, crenate, the teeth or margin  nearly always reflexed. Indusium minute, concealed beneath the sorus,  divided into a few beaded hairs.    Like the obtuse Woodsia this fern has no joint near the base of the stipe,  but is much smaller and has several points of difference. Limestone cliffs,  Gaspe Peninsula, southern shore of Lake Superior, Colorado, Oregon to the  northwest. Its eastern limit is northern Michigan.    (6) ROCKY MOUNTAIN WOODSIA. _Woodsia scopulina_    Fronds six to fifteen inches long [smooth], lanceolate, pinnatifid. Pinnae  triangular-ovate, the lowest pair shortened. Under surface of the whole  frond hispidulous with minute, white hairs and stalked glands. Indusium  hidden beneath the sporangia, consisting mostly of a few hair-like  divisions.    In crevices of rocks, mountains of West Virginia, Gaspe Peninsula, Rocky  Mountains, and westward to Oregon and California.    (7) CATHCART'S WOODSIA. _Woodsia Cathcartiana_    Fronds eight to twelve inches high, lanceolate, bipinnatifid, finely  glandular-puberulent. Pinnse oblong; the lower distant segments oblong,  denticulate, separated by wide sinuses.    Rocky river banks, west Michigan to northeast Minnesota.          DENNSTAEDTIA. _Dicksonia_    Fruit-dots small, globular, marginal, each on the apex of a vein or fork.  Sporangia borne on an elevated, globular receptacle in a membranous,  cup-shaped indusium which is open at the top.    (Named in honor of August Wilhelm Dennstaed.)    HAYSCENTED FERN.

Primary  pinnae in outline like the frond; the secondary, pinnatifid into oblong and  obtuse, cut-toothed lobes. Fruit-dots minute, each on a recurved toothlet,  usually one at the upper margin of each lobe. Indusium fixed under the  sporangia, appearing like a tiny green cup filled with spore cases.

G.E.D.)]    [Illustration: Forked Variety of Hayscented Fern]      [Illustration: Hayscented Fern. _Dennstaedtia punctilobula_]    While _Dennstaedtia_ is the approved scientific name of this species, the  name _Dicksonia_ has come to be used almost as commonly as hay scented fern  or boulder fern. It is one of our most graceful and delicate species, its  long-tapering outline suggesting the bulblet bladder fern. It delights to  cluster around rocks and boulders in upland fields and pastures and in the  margin of rocky woods. It is sweet-scented in drying. A fine species for  the fernery and one of the most decorative of the entire fern family.  The effect of the shimmering fronds, so delicately wrought, flanked by  evergreens, is highly artistic. Fine-haired mountain fern, pasture fern,  and hairy _Dicksonia_ are other names. Canada to Tennessee and westward.    Var. _cristata_ has the fronds more or less forked at the top.

PTERETIS. _Matteuccia_. _Struthiopteris_    (Last three names applied to Ostrich Fern only.)    It is a question whether the sensitive and ostrich fern should be included  in the same genus. They are similar in many respects, but not in all. The  sensitive fern has a running rootstock, scattered fronds, and netted veins;  while the ostrich fern has an upright rootstock, fronds in crowns, and  free veins.    [Illustration: Sensitive Fern. Gradations from Leaf to Fruit.  _Obtusilobata_ Form]    (1) SENSITIVE FERN. _Onoclea sensibilis_    Fronds one to three feet high, scattered along a creeping rootstock,  broadly triangular, deeply pinnatifid, with segments sinuately lobed or  nearly entire. Veins reticulated with fine meshes. The fertile fronds  shorter, closely bipinnate with the pinnules rolled up into berry-like  structures which contain the spore cases. (The name in Greek means a closed  vessel, in allusion to the berry-like fertile segments.) The sensitive  fern is so called from its being very sensitive to frost. The sterile and  fertile fronds are totally unlike, the latter not coming out of the ground  until about July, when they appear like rows of small, green grapes or  berries, but soon turn dark and remain erect all winter, and often do not  discharge their spores until the following spring. The little berry-like  structures of the fertile frond represent pinnules, bearing fruit-dots,  around which they are closely rolled. As Waters remarks, \"Most ferns hold  the sori in the open hand, but the sensitive fern grasps them tightly in  the clenched fist.\"    Var. _obtusilobata_ is an abortive form with the fertile segments only  partially developed. The illustration shows several intermediate forms.    [Illustration: Sori of Sensitive Fern]    [Illustration: Sensitive Fern. _Onoclea sensibilis_]    [Illustration: Sensitive Fern, Fertile and Sterile Fronds on one  Stock _Onoclea sensibilis_ (From the collection of Mr. and Mrs. L.P.

PTERETIS NODULOSA    _Struthiopteris Germanica_. _Matteuccia struthiopteris_    Fronds two to eight feet high, growing in a crown; broadly lanceolate,  pinnate, the numerous pinnae deeply pinnatifid, narrowed toward the  channeled stipe. Fertile fronds shorter, pinnate with margins of the pinnae  revolute into a necklace form containing the sori.    [Illustration: Ostrich Fern. Sterile Fronds (New Hampshire)]    The rootstocks send out slender, underground stolons which bear fronds the  next year. Sterile fronds appear throughout the summer, fertile ones in  July. Seen from a distance its graceful leaf-crowns resemble those of the  cinnamon fern. An intermediate form between the fertile and sterile fronds  is sometimes found, as in the sensitive fern. This handsome species  thrives under cultivation. For grace and dignity it is unrivaled, and for  aggressiveness it is, perhaps, equaled only by the lady fern. For the  climax of beauty it should be combined with the maidenhair. The ostrich  fern is fairly common in alluvial soil over the United States and Canada.    [Illustration: Sori and sporangia of Ostrich Fern]        II    THE FLOWERING FERN FAMILY    _OSMUNDACEAE_    This family is represented in North America by three species, all of which  belong to the single genus.    OSMUNDA    The _osmundas_ are tall swamp ferns growing in large crowns from strong,  thickened rootstocks; the fruiting portion of the fertile frond much  contracted and quite unlike the sterile. Sporangia large, globular,  short-stalked, borne on the margin of the divisions and opening into two  valves by a longitudinal slit. Ring obscure. (From Osmunder, a name of the  god Thor.)    (1) FLOWERING FERN, ROYAL FERN    _Osmunda regalis. Osmunda regalis_, var. SPECTABILIS    Fronds pale green, one to six feet high; sterile part bipinnate, each pinna  having numerous pairs of lance-oblong, serrulate pinnules alternate along  the midrib. Fruiting panicle of the frond six to twelve inches long, brown  when mature and sometimes leafy.    A magnificent fern, universally admired. Well named by the great  Linnaeus, _regalis_, royal, indeed, in its type of queenly beauty. The  wine-colored stipes of the uncoiling fronds shooting up in early spring,  lifting gracefully their pink pinnae and pretty panicles of bright green  spore cases, throw an indescribable charm over the meadows and clothe even  the wet, stagnant swamps with beauty nor is the attraction less when the  showy fronds expand in summer and the green sporangia are turned to brown.  The stout rootstocks are often erect, rising several inches to a foot  above the ground, as if in imitation of a tree fern. The poet Wordworth  hints at somewhat different origin of the name from that given here.      \"Fair ferns and flowers and chiefly that tall fern     So stately of the Queen Osmanda named.\"    [Illustration: Royal or Flowering Fern _Osmunda regalis_]    The royal fern may be transplanted with success if given good soil,  sufficient shade and plenty of water. Common in swamps and damp places.  Newfoundland to Virginia and northwestward.    [Illustration: Sori of _Osmunda regalis_ (From Waters's \"Ferns,\" Henry Holt  & Co.)]    (2) INTERRUPTED FERN. CLAYTON'S FERN    Osmunda Claytoniana    Fronds pinnate, one to five feet high. Pinnae cut into oblong, obtuse lobes.  Fertile fronds taller than the sterile, having from one to five pairs of  intermediate pinnae contracted and bearing sporangia.    [Illustration: Interrupted Fern. _Osmunda Claytoniana_]    The fronds have a bluish-green tint; they mature their spores about the  last of May. The sterile fronds may be distinguished from those of the  cinnamon fern by not having retained, like those, a tuft of wool at the  base of each pinna. Besides, in Clayton's fern the fronds are broader,  blunter and thinner in texture, and the segments more rounded; the fronds  are also more inclined to curve outwards.
