All this took but a few minutes for the savage to discover, when he  gave a whoop of triumph at his success in probing the matter, and  started off on the trail.    Unluckily, this led straight toward the bowlder behind which the boy  had concealed himself; and ere he could find a new hiding-place the  Indian was upon him.    At sight of the boy, the savage gave a whoop, and raised his tomahawk;  but the youngster was expecting this, and instantly raising his gun,  he discharged it full into his heart.    As he heard the shriek of the Indian, and saw him throw up his arms,  he did not wait to bear or see anything else, but instantly fled with  might and main, scarcely looking or knowing whither he was going.    A short time after he found himself at the base of the mountain, very  near the spot where he had first come, and glancing again toward the  steam man, he saw him standing motion less, as before, and with not a  single Indian in sight!                          CHAPTER XIII. AN APPALLING DANGER.    NOT a second was to be lost. The next moment the boy had run across  the intervening space and pulled open the furnace door of the steam  man. He saw a few embers yet smoldering in the bottom, enough to  rekindle the wood. Dashing in a lot from the wagon, he saw it begin  blazing up. He pulled the valve wide open, so that there might not be  a moment's delay in starting, and held the water in the boiler at a  proper level. The smoke immediately began issuing from the pipe or  hat, and the hopes of the boy rose correspondingly.    The great danger was that the Indians would return before he could  start. He kept glancing behind him, and it was with a heart beating  with despair that he heard several whoops, and saw at the same instant  a number of red-skins coming toward him.    The boy gave a jolt to the wagon, which communicated to the steam man,  and it instantly started, at quite a moderate gait, but rapidly  increased to its old-fashioned run.    It was just in the nick of time, for two minutes later the savages  would have been upon him. As it was, when they saw the giant moving  off they paused for a moment in amazement.    But their previous acquaintance with the apparatus had robbed it of  all its supernatural attributes, and their halt lasted but a few  seconds. The next moment they understood that there was some human  agency about it, and uttering their blood-curdling yells, they started  in full pursuit. But by this time the steam gentleman was getting down  to his regular pace, and was striding over the prairie like a  dromedary. For a time the Indians gained, then the intervening  distance became stationary, and then he began pulling steadily away  from them.    Still the savages maintained the chase until satisfied of its  hopelessness, when they gave it up and sullenly withdrew in the  direction of the mountains.    The young fellow, in his triumph, could not avoid rising in the wagon,  shouting and waving his hat defiantly at his baffled pursuers. The  daring act came near costing his life, for it was instantly followed  by the discharge of several guns, and the singing of the bullets about  his ears caused him to duck back into his seat as suddenly as he had  risen from it.    The afternoon was now quite well advanced, and besides feeling hungry,  Johnny Brainerd was anxious to get back to camp.    The intervening distance was rapidly passed, and the sun was just  setting as he slacked up within a short distance of Wolf Ravine.    For some unaccountable reason, the nearer he approached 'camp,' as it  was called, a feeling akin to fear came over him. It was a  presentiment of coming evil, which he found it impossible either to  shake off or to define, and that was why he halted some distance away.    From where he stood it was impossible to see his two friends at work,  but at that time of day he knew they were accustomed to stop work and  come out upon the prairie for the purpose of enjoying the cool breeze  of evening. At the same time, when such constant danger threatened,  they were accustomed to have one of their number, either all or a part  of the time, on the ground above, where the approach of enemies could  be detected.    The absence of anything like a sentinel increased the boy's  apprehensions, and when he had waited some fifteen minutes without  seeing anything of his friends he became painfully uneasy.    'What if they had been killed? What if they were prisoners? What if a  hundred Indians were at that moment in the possession of Wolf Ravine?    Such and similar were the questions which the affrighted boy asked  himself, and which, with all his shrewdness, he was unable to answer.    In the hope of attracting attention he set up a shrieking with the  whistle, which sounded so loud on the still evening air that it must  have gone miles away over the level prairie.    There being no response to this he kept it up for some time, but it  still failed, and all this confirmed him in the belief that 'something  was up.'    What that particular something was it was impossible to say, so long  as he sat in the wagon, and for five minutes he endeavored to decide  whether it was best to get out and make a reconnoissance on his own  hook or remain where, in case of danger, he could seek safety in  flight.    As the day wore rapidly away, and he still failed to see or hear  anything of his friends, he finally concluded to get out and make an  examination of the ravine.    Accordingly he sprung lightly to the ground, but had scarcely alighted  when a peculiar signal, something resembling a tremulous whistle, reached  his ear, and he instantly clambered back again, fully satisfied that  the whistle was intended as a signal, and that it concerned him,  although whether from friend or foe he could only conjecture.    However, his alarm was such that he moved a hundred yards or so  further away from the ravine, where there was less likelihood of being  surprised by any sudden rush upon the part of the thieving red-skins.    From this standpoint he carefully scanned what could be seen of the  ravine. It descended quite gradually from the edge of the bank, so  that he gained a partial view of the rocks and bowlders upon the  opposite side. Some of the trees growing in the narrow valley rose to  such a height that one-half or two-thirds of them were exposed to  view.    It was while the boy was gazing at these that he detected a peculiar  movement in one of the limbs, which instantly arrested his attention.    A moment showed him that the peculiar waving motion was made by human  agency, and he strained his eyes in the hope of detecting the cause of  the curious movement.    The gathering darkness made his vision quite uncertain; but he either  saw, or fancied he saw, a dark object among the limbs which resembled  the form of Baldy Bicknell, the trapper.    Johnny Brainerd would have given almost anything in the world could he  have understood what it all meant.    But the vary fact of these singular demonstrations was prima facie  evidence of the most unquestionable kind; and, after a moment's  consultation with himself, he began moving away, just as the sharp  crack of several rifles notified him of the fearful peril which he had  escaped.                            CHAPTER XIV. THE HUGE HUNTER.    SIMULTANEOUS with the report of the rifles came the pinging of the  bullets about the ears of young Brainerd, who, having started the  steam man, kept on going until he was a considerable distance from the  ravine.    All the time he kept looking back, but could see nothing of his  enemies, nor could he detect the point from which the rifle-shots were  fired.    Now, as night descended over the prairie, and the retreat of his  friends became shrouded in impenetrable darkness, he fully appreciated  the fact that not only were they in great danger, but so was he  himself.    The heathenish terror with which the steam man had at first inspired  the savages had rapidly worn away, the circumstances unfortunately  having been such that they had very speedily learned that it was  nothing more than a human invention, which of itself could accomplish  little or no harm.    He could but reflect, as the man glided slowly along, that if he had  the three friends beside him, how easily they could glide away in the  darkness and leave all danger behind.    But they were in the extremity of peril already, and, reflect and  cogitate as much as he chose, he could see no earthly way of assisting  them out of their difficulty.    Besides the concern which he naturally felt regarding his friends,  there was a matter that more clearly related to himself that demanded  his attention.    The water in the tank was at its lowest ebb, and it would be dangerous  for him to attempt to run more than one hour or so longer before  replenishing it. Consequently he was unable to stand anything like  another chase from the Indians.    As the part of prudence, therefore, he turned toward the river,  following slowly along the bank, in quest of some place where it would  be easy and safe for him to secure the much-needed water.    It was a long and discouraging hunt. The banks were so high that he  could find no point where it was safe for him to descend to the  water's edge. There was too great a risk of 'upsetting his cart,' a  calamity which, in all probability, would be irreparable.    At length, however, when he had wandered about a mile distant from the  Wolf Ravine, he discovered a place, where the bank had about six feet  elevation, and sloped down gradually to the river.    Here he paused, and with a small vessel, descended to the stream,  muttering to himself as he did so:    'Why didn't I think and put a pumping arrangement to the machine? I  could have done it as well as not, and it would"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7509"],[0,"The Logbooks of the Lady Nelson (#11)"],[1,"urned.  In many an old print she is depicted lying at anchor there almost  alone--a small ship in a great harbour--with the Union Jack flying at her  stern, and in the small Sydney newspapers of those early times her  comings and goings are recorded, and her discoveries related with the  keenest interest.    By the Governor's command May 28th, 1801, being the King's birthday, was  observed as a holiday. It was a memorable occasion, for on that day the  Royal Proclamation announcing the Union between Great Britain and Ireland  was read in public by the Provost Marshal. At sunrise the old Union Jack  was hoisted as usual, but at a quarter to nine it was hauled down and the  new Union run up at Dawes Battery and on board the Lady Nelson to the  accompaniment of salutes from the battery and from the brig.    Shortly afterwards Grant received orders to take Colonel Paterson, the  Lieutenant-Governor, to Hunter River, then better known as Coal River.*  (* From the abundance of coal found on its banks. Flinders says its  native name was Yohaaba. The Hunter River was discovered and named by Mr.  Shortland in 1797.) The object of the voyage was to make a survey of the  river and to gain some knowledge of its natural productions, for at this  time much of the coast, both to the north and to the south, was chiefly  known from Cook's chart, and the geography of the more distant parts,  marked but not explored by him, was still as he had left it. Governor  King was also anxious that the Lady Nelson should discover a passage at  Port Stephens (called by the natives Yacaaba), and wrote to Paterson  requesting him to complete the exploration of this port before September,  \"for,\" he said, \"it will then be necessary to despatch Her Ladyship (i.e.  the Lady Nelson) to the southward.\"*)  * This particular voyage to Port  Stephens does not appear to have been carried out, for in August the brig  was \"refitting.\" (See Historical Records of New South Wales.) The  Francis, schooner, was equipped to accompany the Lady Nelson, and orders  were given that the schooner should be loaded with coals immediately on  her arrival at the Hunter River and sent back to Sydney without delay.  Dr. Harris and Ensign Barrallier of the New South Wales Corps (who were  appointed to execute the survey) accompanied Colonel Paterson. A number  of workmen and labourers were also received on board together with a  native of Rose Bay named Bungaree.    The Lady Nelson left the harbour on June 10th, and as she passed out  between the Heads, met the ship Cornwallis inward bound from England. On  June 11th she made North Head of Broken Bay distant 10 or 12 miles.    On the next day the weather was variable, but as there was a Sydney pilot  on board Grant thought that the ship would be safe in his hands. The man,  however, mistook his course at a place called Reid's Mistake, which lies  to the northward of Broken Bay. He imagined that he had arrived at Hunter  River, and was not convinced of his error till the vessel was within half  a mile of an island at the entrance.* (* Reid's Mistake was so called  because a seaman of that name had previously made a similar error, and  lost his ship there. The island lies at the entrance of Lake Macquarie  (and still bears the name). The wrecked vessel was the Martha, 30 tons,  and doubtless was the ship which first saw King Island in 1799.)    Here, as the Lady Nelson was in 17 fathoms water, and the weather was  fair, a boat was lowered and Dr. Harris was sent to explore the place. On  his return the doctor reported that there was not the least sign of a  river here, but that the sea broke heavily over an inlet behind the  island. He brought with him a native, who on first seeing the boat had  run towards it crying out alternately \"Whale boat\" and \"Budgeree (i.e.  good) Dick.\" It was supposed that this native had been given this name by  some of the people sent in search of the convicts who had run away with  the Norfolk. Be this as it may, Budgeree Dick had some fish with him,  which he threw into the bottom of the boat, and then without the least  hesitation jumped in himself. As soon as he had got on board the brig he  continued to cry incessantly, \"Whale boat, Whale boat.\" In order to find  out his meaning he was introduced to the Sydney native Bungaree, who was  directed to question the visitor. Bungaree, by signs, invited him to sit  down, an invitation, observes Grant, which, according to native ideas,  \"implied that a stranger was received with friendship.\" But it was  useless to ask Bungaree to proceed with his inquiries, for another item  of etiquette demanded that a profound silence should follow, which lasted  for twenty minutes. By degrees the two black men entered into  conversation, drawing nearer to one another as they began to talk. The  information sought was not obtained, and it was inferred that they did  not well understand each other's language.    The ship got under way about 3 P.M., and two hours later another high  perpendicular island bearing north 8 or 9 miles came into view. It was  thought to be the real entrance of Hunter's River. At half-past ten, in  company with Dr. Harris, the Commander went in a boat to discover if it  was their port of destination. The entrance was narrow with a heavy sea  running through it. It had a reef on one side, over which broke a very  heavy surf, and on the other side were some sand-breakers. At one time  Grant put the boat's head round to the swell and \"pulled out,\" but the  risk of bringing in the two ships without knowing the size of the channel  made him determine to ascertain it, and accordingly he pulled through and  found from 5 to 4 and 3 1/2 fathoms close to the island. It was high  water when he landed with a party on the island and climbed to the top of  its steep side. The side near the entrance was covered with grass,  although everywhere else the island was perpendicular and crumbled away  by degrees into the sea. From the highest point a beautiful view of  Hunter's River, and of the surrounding islands was obtained. Here  Lieutenant Grant hoisted the Union Jack as a signal to the vessels that  this was the right entrance to the river. He thought, as have most people  since, that this island had been separated from the mainland \"by some  violent convulsion of nature.\" It was named Coal Island by Colonel  Paterson, but is now known as the Nobbys. The commander's journal tells  how plentiful wood and coal were on the mainland, and thus describes his  coming:--    \"We returned on board and set about towing and sweeping her in with all  possible dispatch. At noon the latitude was by observation 32 degrees 57  minutes 34 seconds south, the island which we named Coal Island bearing  west-north-west distant 3 or 4 miles. By the time we approached the  entrance the ebb had set strong out and ran with much force; however, by  dint of warping we brought up under the island for the night within  pistol shot of the shore. At daylight we proceeded up to a saw pit (made  for the purpose of cutting cedar of a large size and excellent quality,  which is growing in abundance on the banks of the river) and came to  abreast of it in 3 fathoms water, steadying the vessel by a hawser made  fast to a tree on the shore. The harbour is of several miles extent and  capable of containing many sail of shipping, and well sheltered from  every wind that blows.    \"We immediately set about making the different arrangements for  completing the objects of our voyage. The Colonel and I went on shore to  examine the different strata of coals, taking with us a miner who pointed  them out to us very distinctly. We found them running from side to side  of the mountain of various qualities and degrees of thickness. At low  water coals proper for fuel were to be gathered up from the reef  before-mentioned, and when the tide was up we could work a pier.  Accordingly, having orders to load the schooner...with coals and wood, I  had the satisfaction to see her sail with a cargo of both on June 26th,  eleven days after her arrival.    \"It may be imagined that coals were found in great plenty when I mention  that the schooner sailed with forty tons, and that we had only one man  employed to dig the mine. The spot where these coals are found is clear  of trees or bush for the space of many acres, which are covered with a  short tender grass very proper for grazing sheep, the ground rising with  a gradual ascent intersected with valleys on which wood grows in plenty,  sheltered from the winds, forming the most delightful prospect. This  place might serve as a station for the woodcutters and colliers.* (* The  point of land where the colliers were put to work was named Collier's  Point by Colonel Paterson. Newcastle now stands on this site.) It affords  pasture for sheep, its soil in general being good...Dr. Harris and Mr.  Barrallier penetrated to some distance inland and met a native who  followed them for some time and left them. Our native Dick also thought  proper to leave us in an excursion we made with him into the country.  Colonel Paterson discovered some copper and iron ores, the latter  strongly impregnated and rich in metal. The seine was hauled and plenty  of excellent fish caught, particularly mullet, with a fish much  resembling the herring which I am inclined to think go in shoals. On an  island in the harbour a tree is found, the quality of whose timber much  resembles that of the ash, and from the great numbers growing there has  given this name to the island.    \"Of this timber I had orders to send a quantity to Sydney, and had  brought out sawyers for that purpose, but as every object could not be at  once accomplished they were employed in the meantime in cutting down and  sawing into planks a tree, the bark of which is much like cork. The  timber...is light, close, and durable, and promises to stand against the  effects of worms on the bottoms of vessels. I had a boat"]]]
