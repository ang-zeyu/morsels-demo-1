The two splendid dogs  were the children's special protectors and companions.    [Illustration: \"Their dog trains were in almost constant demand.\"]          CHAPTER VIII.      Happy Christmas Holidays--Indians Made Glad with  Presents--Souwanas Tells How Nanahboozhoo Stole the  Fire from the Old Magician and Gave It to the Indians.    The Christmas holidays were times of innocent festivities and gladness  among the Indians and their white friends, both at the mission and at the  trading post.    The gifts which it was possible to give to the Indians were not of very  great value, but they were articles much needed and were always prized by  the recipients even if they were never very profuse in their words of  thanks. Minnehaha and Sagastao were wild with delight at these times, and  were eager to be the almoners of the mission, and carry the gifts to the  Indians whom they loved so well. The fact that the temperature of those  bright, cold Northern winters kept steadily many degrees below zero did not  chill their ardor nor lessen their enthusiasm. Their dog trains were in  almost constant demand, for they kept flying over the various icy trails  until in the different wigwams all had been remembered with some useful  gift.    Faithful Mary had made for them the warmest of fur and blanket suits.  Dressed in these, and tucked in among the robes in the cariole by their  careful driver, they sped along the trails. They made the woods echo with  their merry shouts and laughter--unless it was so bitterly cold that they  had to be completely covered up. It is not to be wondered at that there  were times when, on reaching some distant wigwam, there were little hard,  white spots on their cheeks or noses which told the watchful Indians that  the Frost King had been at work and that speedily those frostbites must be  removed. Little cared they for the momentary pain that ensued, when the  frozen parts were being thawed out. They were out for a good time, and they  had too much grit and courage to let such trifles as a few frostbites  disturb their happiness. The bright fires burning in the center of the  wigwams, or in the fireplaces at the end or side of the little Indian  houses, were of course always welcome after a long run in the bitter cold.    \"Tell us, Souwanas,\" said Sagastao one very cold day, as they were gathered  around his wigwam fire, \"how it was that Nanahboozhoo stole the fire from  those who were guarding it and gave it to the Indians.\"    \"It must not be too long a story,\" said Minnehaha, \"as we have yet to go to  the wigwam of Kinnesasis, Little Fish, with his presents, and it would be  too bad to be late when they know we are coming.\"    So Souwanas pledged himself to make the story as short as he could without  spoiling it, and then, after a few more whiffs from his beloved calumet, he  began:    \"It was long ago, when there were fewer people in the forests and on the  prairies than now. They did not have as many comforts as they have now, and  one of the rarest things among them was fire. Sometimes when the  lightning's flash set a tree on fire they would have it for a little while,  but they did not seem to be able to keep it going, and they were often very  cold and generally had to eat their food without cooking it.    \"Nanahboozhoo was then still living with his grandmother, Nokomis, and was  sorry to see that she often suffered from the cold and that the food was  miserable because it was not cooked. So he set his wits to work and decided  that something must be done. As he should now have to deal with the Muche  Munedoos, evil spirits, he had to be very careful. He put himself in  various disguises and at length he heard all about how the coyote had  stolen some of the fire from the watchers in the underground world, who  possess enormous quantities of it. It frightened him a little when he heard  that there was so much fire in the world under us, but he was not apt to be  afraid very long and so as he went on searching, and on the sly listening  to the talks of windegoos and others, he found that the fire for which he  had been so long searching was in the possession of a fierce old medicine  warrior who guarded it with the greatest care. Those who had employed the  coyote to get it had intrusted its keeping to him. In those days they had  an idea that fire was such a dangerous thing that it would be almost  certain destruction to the race if it was given to all. This old warrior  had his two daughters, who were great, fierce women, to assist him in  guarding the fire.    \"Several attempts had been made to steal the fire ere Nanahboozhoo resolved  to see what he could do. All of these other efforts had failed, and the  parties who tried them were killed. Nokomis heard of these unsuccessful  attempts and tried to dissuade her grandson, Nanahboozhoo, from such a  dangerous enterprise.    \"Nanahboozhoo, however, was a very skillful fellow, and although this was  one of his first great undertakings, for it was long ago, he was not to be  stopped by her fears, and so away he went. As the ice was not yet on the  waters he took his birch canoe and paddled eastward as far as he could.  Then he hid his canoe where he could easily find it on his return.    \"The next thing he did was to transform himself into a rabbit, and in that  shape he hurried on until he saw in the distance the sacred wigwam where  dwelt the old guardian of the fire and his two daughters, who were famous  for their height and their strength. To excite the pity of these daughters  Nanahboozhoo jumped into some water, and then crawling out, wet and cold,  he slowly approached the wigwam. Here the two daughters found him, and he  looked so miserable that they took pity on him and at once carried him into  the wigwam and set him down near the sacred fire, that he might soon get  warm and dry.\"    [Illustration: \"Where the fire was stolen out of the center of the earth.\"]    \"How very kind that was of the old man's daughters,\" said Minnehaha.    \"I don't know about that,\" said the more matter-of-fact Sagastao; \"folks  sometimes get into trouble by taking up everything that comes along.  Remember that old rascal that humbugged father.\"    But Souwanas, remembering his promise, adroitly shunted off the youngsters  and resumed his story.    \"The two girls, after seeing how contented and happy the rabbit seemed to  be as it warmed itself by the fire, again returned to their duties in  different parts of the large wigwam. The rabbit soon after hopped a little  nearer to the fire, that he might be able to seize hold of a burning stick  or brand, but as he moved the ground shook and trembled under him so that  it awoke the old man, who had fallen into a heavy sleep. Thus disturbed, he  called out to his daughters in alarm:    \"'My daughters, what was it that caused the ground to tremble?'    \"The girls replied that they did not know. They had done nothing beyond  their usual work except to bring in to warm a poor little shivering  half-frozen rabbit that they had found outside. At first the old man was a  little suspicious and, rolling over, he took a good look at Nanahboozhoo.  But he had made himself into such a poor little wretched half-drowned  rabbit that the old man's suspicions were completely dispelled, and he  turned over again and went to sleep.    \"Nanahboozhoo was pleased to hear the old man snoring again, and he only  waited now until the two girls should both be busy in the wigwam on the  opposite side from the door; then he suddenly changed himself into a fleet  young Indian runner, and quickly seizing hold of a burning stick he dashed  out of the wigwam and away he rushed toward the place where he had left his  canoe.    \"Of course there was instant pursuit. The two daughters, although they were  magicians, like their father, well knew that they would be punished by the  superior evil spirits if they allowed any of the sacred fire to be stolen,  and they were furious at the cunning and deceitful Nanahboozhoo, whom they  now recognized, for playing such a trick upon them. Shouting to their  father, to arouse him, they immediately ran after the retreating  Nanahboozhoo, who with the burning brand in his hand was speeding rapidly  over the trail. But, fleet as he was, he soon discovered that the two  girls, by their magic, were rapidly gaining upon him. They were the  fleetest of runners, even if they were girls, and it was for that reason  that they and their father were intrusted with the sacred fire. Great  honors were to be theirs if they guarded it to the satisfaction of those  who had intrusted it to them, while, on the other hand, great would be  their disgrace if they failed in their duty.    \"When they found that they were gaining on Nanahboozhoo, and were likely  to regain possession of the firebrand, with shouts and threats they  declared that severe indeed would be his punishment, when he fell into  their hands, for his abuse of their kindness and his trickery.    \"Nanahboozhoo felt that he was indeed in a tight place. He did not,  however, intend to be overtaken, and he sped on, if possible faster than  ever, until there was only a large dried-up, barren meadow between him and  the spot where he had tied his canoe on the shore of the lake. The girls  were only a few hundred yards behind him, and he resolved to fight them  with this sacred fire. So, as he rapidly continued his flight, he plunged  the now blazing firebrand into the dry grass, here and there, on each side  of the trail.

Am Abend bewegten  sich in der kleinen Strasse, wo sich das Haus des alten Bischofs  befindet, weit ueber 10000 Menschen, alte Freunde, Nachbarn und Mitbuerger  der Stadt, um sie zu begruessen. Die Stadtverwaltung hatte alle  oeffentlichen Gebaeude dekoriert und beflaggt, und die drei groesseren  Plaetze von Dayton herrlich illuminiert. Auch die Einwohner waren in  Beflaggung und Illumination nicht sparsam gewesen, so dass Dayton ein  praechtiges Bild gab, wie man es noch nie zuvor gesehen hatte.    [Illustration: *Schematische Ansicht der Trageflaechen nach der      Verbindung*]    Am 17. und 18. Juni hatte die Stadt eine grosse Feierlichkeit  veranstaltet, bei der drei goldene Medaillen den Bruedern ueberreicht  wurden: eine von der Nation, eine vom Staate Ohio und eine von der Stadt  Dayton. Doch die Mission der beiden Brueder war noch nicht erfuellt;  alsbald begaben sie sich nach Washington, wo Orville Wright die  Abnahmefahrten fuer die amerikanische Regierung begann. Nach anfaenglich  kleinen Havarien, die bei neuen Apparaten fast immer vorkommen, jedoch  in zwei, drei Fahrten bald beseitigt sind, zeigte der Flieger wieder,  was er leisten konnte, und schon am 20. Juli blieb Wright 80 Minuten in  der Luft und legte dabei in der Stunde 45 Meilen zurueck. Damit waren die  Bedingungen, welche die amerikanische Regierung gestellt hatte, erfuellt  und nunmehr konnte sich Orville nach Europa begeben, um Berlin sein  Koennen zu zeigen und Piloten auszubilden fuer die deutsche Gesellschaft  \"Flugmaschine Wright\", die aus der Motorluftschiff-Studiengesellschaft  und der Luftfahrzeug-Gesellschaft hervorgegangen ist, um Flieger nach  der Bauart der Brueder Wright und anderer Erfinder herzustellen. Damit  duerften wir auch in Deutschland bald so weit sein, dass der Flugsport  allgemeine Verbreitung findet.          *      *      *      *      *          Anhang: Korrespondenz von A.

Dear Sir,    Relating to the acquaintance which to make of you I had the Honour at  the end of October in 1907 during my visit at Dayton I beg to adress to  you with a demand to day. I am going to write a book about your  celebrated sons. I should be very thankful to you for willing send me  some material. I should like to have any dates of the youth of your  sons, of the first experiences and also of you and the lated Madame  Wright; perhaps do you write me also of your feeling, having had during  the bold experiences of your sons. If You could let me have portraits of  you and the lated Madame Wright, of your children and your house at  Dayton, I should very obliged to you. Please, will you have then the  kindness, to get reproduce such pictures an my account and to send me  the wished materiel as soon as possible, as I have to make haste, for  being the book ready still before the visit of your sonns in  Germany.    Hoping, that you will accomplish my wishes and thanking you beforehand,  I remain, Dear Sir,    Yours very most obedient    [Signature: Capt. A. Hildebrandt.]      A. Hildebrandt  Hauptmann a. D.

Bishop Milton Wright, Esquire,  Dayton (Ohio)    Dear Sir,    With best thanks I confirm you the receipt of your kind letter of the  11th inst. Your family-history has interested me very much. I shall  make use of them soon. But about something I am not clear. You write:  \"This brings us in line with general United States Grant and  Grover-Cleveland.\" I do not know, if you mean two persons, the same  general Grant and general Grover from Cleveland? Also I thank you for  your photograph. It is of moment to me, also to have still photographs  of the late Madame Wright and her father, Mr. John Koerner, whom Germany  the native has been of. I should like to get still other photographs of  your children Wilbur and Orville, presenting them in young years and  also of Miss Katherine and if you have still a photograph presenting  your whole family joined. At last you would oblige me much for sending  me pictures also of your present house, the flight-square near Dayton  and the whole sight of Dayton. As being immodest of me, to pronounce so  many wishes to you, I propose and beg you, to give order to anybody, to  procure me all the wished photographs and pictures on my account. With  great interest I am awaiting your further informations, promised me in  your letter, about the youth of your sons and the matter, how these are  gotten to the intention to make experiences with a flying mashine.

Schleits in Saxony?]    Thanking you once more for the material, which to send me, you have had  the kindness, I remain, Dear Sir,    Yours most obedient    [Signature: Hildebrandt]    [Hand-written note: PS.

Dear Sir:    You did not quite understand my letter. It was General Ulysses S. Grant  that I wrote of, and President Grover Cleveland, of whom I spoke. They  were two presidents of our country, decended like myself from John  Porter of Windsor (16_37) from whom I am also descended. Hence they are  distant cousins of ours, and of each other.    My wife's father was a regular German in his looks. He was born six  miles west of Scleitz in Saxony, the southwest part, as you will see on  any large map of Saxony. The family, of whom we never had any group  picture, is as follows:    Milton Wright, born November 17, 1828, in Rush County, Indiana.    Susan Catharine (Koerner) Wright, born near Hillsboro, Virginia, April  30, 1831.    Reuchlin Wright, born in Grant County, Indiana, March 17, 1861.    Lorin Wright, born in Fayette County, Indiana, November 18, 1862.    (These two older brothers are still living, are married, and have lovely    children--Reuchlin three, Lorin four, Reuchlin's oldest married).    Wilbur Wright, born, in Henry county, Indiana, April 16, 1867.    Otis Wright and Ida Wright (twins) born April 24, 1870, in Dayton, Ohio.    (Without sickness or pain, they died at 13 and 18 days of age).    Orville Wright, born August 19, in Dayton, Ohio, 1871.    Katharine Wright, born in Dayton, Ohio, August 19, 1874.    They were all good children. And they are all of unimpeachable morals  yet. Reuchlin is a deacon on the Congregational Church, in Tonganoxie,  Kan. They are about equal in intellect, the others having had better  education than the inventors. Katharine graduated in the Classical  Course in Oberlin College, and teaches in Dayton High School. I am a  traveling minister in the United Brethren in Christ, served several  years as pastor, ten as presiding elder, eight as editor of our Church  paper, and twenty-four as bishop. As bishop and editor I was elected by  General Conference every four years, those offices being filled every  four years by a ballot election. In filling my duties, I have visited  all the states west of the River, and territories; and all states east  of the Mississipi, except the six New England states and five others. In  all I have traveled by rail, over two hundred thousand miles. My change  of residence every two years must account for my three older children  being born in three different counties in Indiana. Mrs. Wright, the  sweetest spirit earth ever knew, died twenty years ago, in Dayton, July  4, 1889. From that on I raised the children, left to my care. All the  children sprang to help their mother, but Wilbur cared for her,  prolonged her life, and I gave him five hundred dollars for his  incomparable care for her. [Hand-written note: He had no promise of  reward.]    Their first interest in the art of flying, they date back to about the  year 1879, when I brought home to them a Heliocoptere, a toy which could  fly. Later on they began to watch Lilienthal, and followed him to his  death, in the art of gliding. Their first active work began in the year  1900, when as a vacation, they built a gliding machine on the coast of  North Carolina, and each year in the fall of the year, spent a few weeks  there till in 1903, they attached a gasoline motor to it and flew,  December 17th, four short flights. They flew against the wind and made  at the longest only about a half mile, counting the velocity of the  wind. In actual measurment considerably less than a half mile. The  place of flight was on the sandy plain near Kill Devil Mills, in Dare  County, four miles from Kitty Hawk in Cerrituck County. The following  two summers and falls, they experimented at Simson's(?) Station (a  mere stopping place, on the Dayton and Springfield traction railroad, a  perfectly level meadow ground) where they made a few miles flight, but  in 1905, September, they flew as much as twenty-four miles, at one  flight. They flew no more for part of two years, but began negotiations  for the sale of their invention. In 1908, they engaged to a Company in  France, to sell their rights, and sold to the United states government a  single machine at twenty-five thousand dollars, they in each case, to  perform certain exploits with the machine. Time crowding on them to meet  engagements, they separated in June 1908, Wilbur going to France, and  Orville remaining to complete at Ft. Myer (near Washington) the United  States contract. Of Wilbur's scalding his arm in regulating his machine,  and his successful trial, before his arm was well, all have read. But  Orville having his machine ready at Ft. Myer, went far ahead of Wilbur,  but an easily avoided defect in his machine, having under strain caused  friction between the propeller of his machine and a wire, and--far worst  of all broke the management of the _tail_ of his machine, a most"]]]
