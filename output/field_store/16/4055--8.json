Trebellius fuga ac latebris vitata  exercitus ira, indecorus atque humilis, precario mox praefuit: ac velut  pacti, exercitus licentiam, dux salutem; et seditio sine sanguina stetit.  Nec Vettius Bolanus, manentibus adhuc civilibus bellis, agitavit  Britanniam disciplina: eadem inertia erga hostes, similis petulantia  castrorum: nisi quod innocens Bolanus et nullis delictis invisus,  caritatem paraverat loco auctoritatis.    XVII. Sed, ubi cum cetero orbe Vespasianus et Britanniam recuperavit,  magni duces, egregii exercitus, minuta hostium spes. Et terrorem statira  intulit Petilius Cerialis, Brigantum civitatem, quae numerosissima  provinciae totius perhibetur, aggressus. Multa proelia, et aliquando non  incruenta magnamque Brigantum partem aut victoria amplexus est aut bello.  Et, cum Cerialis quidem alterius successoris curam famamque obruisset,  sustinuit quoque molem Julius Frontinus, vir magnus quantum licebat,  validamque et pugnacem Silurum gentem armis subegit, super virtutem  hostium, locorum quoque difficultates eluctatus.    XVIII. Hunc Britanniae statum, has bellorum vices media jam aestate  transgressus Agricola invenit, cum et milites, velut omissa expeditione,  ad securitatem, et hostes ad occasionem verterentur. Ordovicum civitas,  haud multo ante adventum ejus, alam, in finibus suis agentem, prope  universam obtriverat eoque initio erecta provincia: et, quibus bellum  volentibus erat, probare exemplum, ac recentis legati animum opperiri,  cum Agricola, quanquam transvecta aestas, sparsi per provinciam numeri,  praesumpta apud militem illius anni quies, tarda et contraria bellum  inchoaturo, et plerisque custodiri suspecta potius videbatur, ire obviam  discrimini statuit: contractisque legionum vexillis et modica auxiliorum  manu, quia in aequum degredi Ordovices non audebant, ipse ante agmen, quo  ceteris par animus simili periculo esset, erexit aciem: caesaque prope  universa gente, non ignarus instandum famae, ac, prout prima cessissent,  terrorem ceteris fore, Monam insulam, cujus possessione revocatum  Paullinum rebellione totius Britanniae supra memoravi, redigere in  potestatem animo intendit. Sed, ut in dubiis consiliis, naves deerant:  ratio et constantia ducis transvexit. Depositis omnibus sarcinis,  lectissimos auxiliarium, quibus nota vada et patrius nandi usus, quo  simul seque et arma et equos regunt, ita repente immisit, ut obstupefacti  hostes, qui classem, qui naves, qui mare expectabant, nihil arduum aut  invictum crediderint sic ad bellum venientibus. Ita petita pace ac dedita  insula, clarus ac magnus haberi Agricola: quippe cui ingredienti  provinciam, quod tempus alii per ostentationem aut officiorum ambitum  transigunt, labor et periculum placuisset. Nec Agricola, prosperitate  rerum in vanitatem usus, expeditionem aut victoriam vocabat victos  continuisse: ne laureatis quidem gesta prosecutus est: sed ipsa  dissimulatione famae famam auxit, aestimantibus, quanta futuri spe tam  magna tacuisset.    XIX. Ceterum animorum provinciae prudens, simulque doctus per aliena  experimenta parum profici armis, si injuriae sequerentur, causas bellorum  statuit excidere. A se suisque orsus, primum domum suam coercuit; quod  plerisque haud minus arduum est, quam provinciam regere. Nihil per  libertos servosque publicae rei: non studiis privatis nec ex  commendatione aut precibus centurionum milites ascire, sed optimum  quemque fidissimum putare: omnia scire, non omnia exsequi: parvis  peccatis veniam, magnis severitatem commodare: nec poena semper, sed  saepius poenitentia contentus esse: officiis et administrationibus potius  non peccaturos praeponere, quam damnare, cum peccassent. Frumenti et  tributorum auctionem aequalitate munerum mollire, circumcisis, quae, in  quaestum reperta, ipso tributo gravius tolerabantur: namque per ludibrium  assidere clausis horreis et emere ultro frumenta, ac vendere pretio  cogebantur: devortia itinerum et longinquitas regionum indicebatur, ut  civitates a proximis hibernis in remota et avia referrent, donec, quod  omnibus in promptu erat, paucis lucrosum fieret.    XX. Haec primo statim anno comprimendo, egregiam famam paci circumdedit;  quae vel incuria vel intolerantia priorum haud minus quam bellum  timebatur. Sed, ubi aestas advenit, contracto exercitu, multus in agmine  laudare modestiam, disjectos coercere: loca castris ipse capere,  aestuaria ac silvas ipse praetentare; et nihil interim apud hostes  quietum pati, quo minus subitis excursibus popularetur: atque, ubi satis  terruerat, parcendo rursus irritamenta pacis ostentare. Quibus rebus  multae civitates, quae in illum diem ex aequo egerant, datis obsidibus,  iram posuere, et praesidiis castellisque circumdatae tanta ratione  curaque, ut nulla ante Britanniae nova pars illacessita transierit.    XXI. Sequens hiems saluberrimis consiliis absumpta: namque, ut homines  dispersi ac rudes, eoque in bella faciles, quieti et otio per voluptates  assuescerent, hortari privatim, adjuvare publice, ut templa, fora, domus  exstruerent, laudando promptos et castigando segnes: ita honoris  aemulatio pro necessitate erat. Jam vero principum filios liberalibus  artibus erudire, et ingenia Britannorum studiis Gallorum anteferre, ut,  qui modo linguam Romanam abnuebant, eloquentiam concupiscerent. Inde  etiam habitus nostri honor et frequens toga: paulatimque discessum ad  delenimenta vitiorum, porticus et balnea et conviviorum elegantiam: idque  apud imperitos humanitas vocabatur, cum pars servitutis esset.    XXII. Tertius expeditionum annus novas gentes aperuit, vastatis usque ad  Taum (aestuario nomen est) nationibus: qua formidine territi hostes  quanquam conflictatum saevis tempestatibus exercitum lacessere non ausi;  ponendisque insuper castellis spatium fuit. Annotabant periti non alium  ducem opportunitates locorum sapientius legisse: nullum ab Agricola  positum castellum aut vi hostium expugnatum aut pactione ac fuga  desertum. Crebrae eruptiones: nam adversus moras obsidionis annuis copiis  firmabantur: ita intrepida ibi hiems, et sibi quisque praesidio, irritis  hostibus eoque desperantibus, quia soliti plerumque damna aestatis  hibernis eventibus pensare, tum aestate atque hieme juxta pellebantur.  Nec Agricola unquam per alios gesta avidus intercepit: seu centurio seu  praefectus, incorruptum facti testem habebat. Apud quosdam acerbior in  conviciis narrabatur; ut erat comis bonis, adversus malos injucundus:  ceterum ex iracundia nihil supererat; secretum et silentium ejus non  timeres: honestius putabat offendere, quam odisse.    XXIII. Quarta aestas obtinendis, quae percurrerat, insumpta: ac, si  virtus exercituum et Romani nominis gloria pateretur, inventus in ipsa  Britannia terminus. Nam Clota et Bodotria, diversi maris aestibus per  immensum revectae, angusto terrarum spatio dirimuntur: quod tum  praesidiis firmabatur: atque omnis propior sinus tenebatur, summotis  velut in aliam insulam hostibus.    XXIV. Quinto expeditionum anno, nave prima transgressus, ignotas ad id  tempus gentes crebris simul ac prosperis proeliis domuit: eamque partem  Britanniae, quae Hiberniam aspicit, copiis instruxit in spem magis quam  ob formidinem; si quidem Hibernia, medio inter Britanniam atque Hispaniam  sita et Gallico quoque mari opportuna, valentissimam imperii partem  magnis invicem usibus miscuerit. Spatium ejus, si Britanniae comparetur,  angustius, nostri maris insulas superat. Solum coelumque et ingenia  cultusque hominum haud multum a Britannia differunt: in melius aditus  portusque per commercia et negotiatores cogniti. Agricola expulsum  seditione domestica unum ex regulis gentis exceperat ac specie amicitiae  in occasionem retinebat. Saepe ex eo audivi, legione una et modicis  auxiliis debellari obtinerique Hiberniam posse. Idque etiam adversus  Britanniam profuturum, si Romana ubique arma, et velut e conspectu  libertas tolleretur.    XXV. Ceterum aestate, qua sextum officii annum inchoabat, amplexus  civitates trans Bodotriam sitas, quia motus universarum ultra gentium et  infesta hostilis exercitus itinera timebantur, portus classe exploravit:  quae, ab Agricola primum assumpta in partem virium, sequebatur egregia  specie, cum simul terra, simul mari bellum impelleretur, ac saepe iisdem  castris pedes equesque et nauticus miles, mixti copiis et laetitia, sua  quisque facta, suos casus attollerent: ac modo silvarum ac montium  profunda, modo tempestatum ac fluctuum adversa, hinc terra et hostis,  hinc victus Oceanus militari jactantia compararentur. Britannos quoque,  ut ex captivis audiebatur, visa classis obstupefaciebat, tanquam, aperto  maris sui secreto, ultimum victis perfugium clauderetur. Ad manus et arma  conversi Caledoniam incolentes populi, paratu magno, majore fama, uti mos  est de ignotis, oppugnasse ultro, castella adorti, metum, ut provocantes,  addiderant: regrediendumque citra Bodotriam, et excedendum potius, quam  pellerentur, specie prudentium ignavi admonebant: cum interim cognoscit  hostes pluribus agminibus irrupturos. Ac, ne superante numero et peritia  locorum circumiretur, diviso et ipse in tres partes exercitu incessit.    XXVI. Quod ubi cognitum hosti, mutato repente consilio, universi nonam  legionem, ut maxime invalidam, nocte aggressi, inter somnum ac  trepidationem caesis vigilibus, irrupere. Jamque in ipsis castris  pugnabant, cum Agricola, iter hostium ab exploratoribus edoctus et  vestigiis insecutus, velocissimos equitum peditumque assultare tergis  pugnantium jubet, mox ab universis adjici clamorem; et propinqua luce  fulsere signa: ita ancipiti malo territi Britanni: et Romanis redit  animus, ac, securi pro salute, de gloria certabant. Ultro quin etiam  erupere: et fuit atrox in ipsia portarum angustiis proelium, donec pulsi  hostes; utroque exercitu certante, his, ut tulisse opem, illis, ne  eguisse auxilio viderentur.

By examining the above list, it will be found, that, while free debate  is allowed upon every principal question [Sec. 6], it is permitted or  prohibited upon other questions in accordance with the following  principles:    (a) Highly privileged questions, as a rule, should not be debated, as in  that case they could be used to prevent the assembly from coming to a  vote on the main question; (for instance, if the motion to adjourn were  debatable, it could be used [see Sec. 11] in a way to greatly hinder  business).  High privilege is, as a rule, incompatible with the right of  debate on the privileged question.    (b) A motion that has the effect to suppress a question before the  assembly, so that it cannot again be taken up that session [Sec. 42],  allows of free debate.  And a subsidiary motion [Sec. 7, except commit,  which see below,] is debatable to just the extent that it interferes  with the right of the assembly to take up the original question at its  pleasure.    Illustrations:  To \"Indefinitely Postpone\" [Sec. 24] a question, places it  out of the power of the assembly to again take it up during that  session, and consequently this motion allows of free debate, even  involving the whole merits of the original question.    To \"Postpone to a certain time\" prevents the assembly taking up the  question till the specified time, and therefore allows of limited debate  upon the propriety of the postponement.    To \"Lie on the Table\" leaves the question so    === Page 71 ============================================================    that the assembly can at any time consider it, and therefore should not  be, and is not debatable.    To \"Commit\" would not be very debatable, according to this rule, but it  is an exception, because it is often important that the committee should  know the views of the assembly on the question, and it therefore is not  only debatable, but opens to debate the whole question which it is  proposed to refer to the committee.    36. Decorum in Debate [see Sec. 2].  In debate a member must confine  himself to the question before the assembly, and avoid personalities.  He cannot reflect upon any act of the assembly, unless he intends to  conclude his remarks with a motion to rescind such action, or else while  debating such motion.  In referring to another member, he should, as  much as possible, avoid using his name, rather referring to him as \"the  member who spoke last,\" or in some other way describing him.  The  officers of the assembly should always be referred to by their official  titles.  It is not allowable to arraign the motives of a member, but the  nature or consequences of a measure may be condemned in strong terms.  It is not the man, but the measure, that is the subject of debate.  If  at any time the Chairman rises to state a point of order, or give  information, or otherwise speak, within his privilege [see    === Page 72 ============================================================    Sec. 40], the member speaking must take his seat till the Chairman has been  first heard.  When called to order, the member must sit down until the  question of order is decided.  If his remarks are decided to be  improper, he cannot proceed, if any one objects, without the leave of  the assembly expressed by a vote, upon which question there shall be no  debate.    Disorderly words should be taken down by the member who objects to them,  or by the clerk, and then read to the member; if he denies them, the  assembly shall decide by a vote whether they are his words or not.  If a  member cannot justify the words he used, and will not suitably apologize  for using them, it is the duty of the assembly to act in the case,  requiring both members to withdraw* [If both are personally interested.  [See page 161.]] till it has decided its course, it being a general rule  that no member should he present in the assembly when any matter  relating to himself is under debate.  If any business has taken place  since the member spoke, it is too late to take notice of any disorderly  words he used.    37. Closing Debate.  Debate upon a question is not closed by the  Chairman rising to put the question, as, until both the affirmative    === Page 73 ============================================================    and negative are put, a member can claim the floor, and re-open debate  [see Sec. 38].  Debate can be closed by the following motions, which are  undebatable [Sec. 35], and, except to Lie on the Table, shall require a  two-thirds* [In Congress, where each speaker can occupy the floor one  hour, any of these motions to cut off debate can be adopted by a mere  majority.  In ordinary societies harmony is so essential, that a  two-thirds vote should be required to force the assembly to a final vote  without allowing free debate.] vote for their adoption [Sec. 39]:      (a) An objection to the consideration of a question [only allowable  when the question is first introduced, Sec. 15], which, if sustained, not only  stops debate, but also throws the subject out of the assembly for that  session [Sec. 42]; which latter effect is the one for which it was  designed.      (b) To lie on the table [Sec. 19], which, if adopted, carries the  question to the table, from which it cannot be taken without a majority  favors such action.      (c) The previous question [Sec. 20], which has the effect of requiring  all the questions before the assembly [excepting as limited in Sec. 20] to  be put to vote at once without further debate.  It may be applied merely  to an amendment or to an amendment of an amendment.    === Page 74 ============================================================      (d) For the assembly to adopt an order (1) limiting debate upon a  special subject, either as to the number or length of the speeches; or  (2) closing debate upon the subject at a stated time, when all pending  questions shall be put to vote without further debate.  Either of these  two measures may be applied only to a pending amendment, or an amendment  thereto, and when this is voted upon, the original question is still  open to debate and amendment.    Art. VI.  Vote.  [Sec.Sec. 38-39.]    38. Voting.  Whenever from the nature of the question it permits of no  modification or debate, the Chairman immediately puts it to vote; if the  question is debatable, when the Chairman thinks the debate has been  brought to a close, he should inquire if the assembly is ready for the  question, and if no one rises he puts the question to vote.  There are  various forms for putting the question, in use in different parts of the  country.  The rule in Congress, in    === Page 75 ============================================================    the House of Representatives, is as follows:  \"Questions shall be  distinctly put in this form, to-wit:  'As many as are of the opinion  that (as the question may be) say Aye;' and after the affirmative voice  is expressed, 'As many as are of the contrary opinion, say No.'\"  The  following form is very common:  \"It has been moved and seconded that  (here state the question).  As many as are favor of the motion say Aye;  those opposed, No.\"  Or, if the motion is for the adoption of a certain  resolution, after it has been read the Chairman can say, \"You have heard  the resolution read; those in favor of its adoption will hold up the  right hand; those opposed will manifest it by the same sign.\"  These  examples are sufficient to show the usual methods of putting a question,  the affirmative being always put first.    When a vote is taken, the Chairman should always announce the result in  the following form:  \"The motion is carried--the resolution is  adopted,\" or, \"The ayes have it--the resolution is adopted.\"  If, when  he announces a vote, any member rises and states that he doubts the  vote, or calls for a \"division,\" the    === Page 76 ============================================================    Chairman shall say, \"A division is called for; those in favor of the  motion will rise.\"  After counting these, and announcing the number, he  shall say, \"Those opposed will rise.\" will count these, announce the  number, and declare the result; that is, whether the motion is carried  or lost.  Instead of counting the vote himself, he can appoint tellers  to make the count and report to him.  When tellers are appointed, they  should be selected from both sides of the question.  A member has the  right to change his vote (when not made by ballot) before the decision  of the question has been finally and conclusively pronounced by the  Chair, but not afterwards.    Until the negative is put, it is in order for any member, in the same  manner as if the voting had not been commenced, to rise and speak, make  motions for amendment or otherwise, and thus renew the debate; and this,  whether the member was in the assembly room or not when the question was  put and the vote partly taken.  In such case the question is in the same  condition as if it had never been put.    No one can vote on a question affecting    === Page 77 ============================================================    himself, but if more than one name is included in the resolution (though  a sense of delicacy would prevent this right being exercised, excepting  when it would change the vote) all are entitled to vote; for if this  were not so, a minority could control an assembly by including the names  of a sufficient number in a motion, say for preferring charges against  them, and suspend them, or even expel them from the assembly.  When  there is a tie vote the motion fails, without the Chairman gives his  vote for the affirmative, which in such case he can do.  Where his vote  will make a tie, he can cast it and thus defeat the measure.    Another form of voting is by"]]]
