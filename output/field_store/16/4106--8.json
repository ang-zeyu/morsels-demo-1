I fully agree with  him.\"--PANIZZI, _ut sup_. Vol. iii p. 333.]    [Footnote 3: \"Tisbina,\" says Panizzi, in a note on this passage, \"very  wisely acted like Emilia (in Chaucer), who, when she saw she could not  marry Arcita, because he was killed, thought of marrying Palemone, rather  than 'be a mayden all hire lyf.' It is to be observed, that although she  regretted very much what had happened, and even fainted away, she did  not, however, stand on ceremonies, as the poet says in the next stanza,  but yielded immediately, and married Prasildo. This, at first, I thought  to be a somewhat inconsistent; but on consideration I found I was wrong.  Tisbina was wrong; because, having lost Iroldo, she did not know what  Prasildo would do; but so soon as the latter offered to fill up the  place, she nobly and magnanimously resigned herself to her fate.\"--_Ut  sup_. vol. iii. p. 336.    It might be thought inconsistent in Tisbina, notwithstanding Mr.  Panizzi's pleasantry, to be so willing to take another husband, after  having poisoned herself for the first; but she seems intended by the poet  to exhibit a character of impulse in contradistinction to permanency of  sentiment. She cannot help shewing pity for Prasildo; she cannot help  poisoning herself for her husband; and she cannot help taking his friend,  when she has lost him. Nor must it be forgotten, that the husband was the  first to break the tie. We respect him more than we do her, because he  was capable of greater self-denial; but if he himself preferred his  friend to his love, we can hardly blame her (custom apart) for following  the example.]      SEEING AND BELIEVING.    ARGUMENT    A lady has two suitors, a young and an old one, the latter of whom wins  her against her inclinations by practising the artifice of Hippomanes in  his race with Atalanta. Being very jealous, he locks her up in a tower;  and the youth, who continued to be her lover, makes a subterraneous  passage to it; and pretending to have married her sister, invites the old  man to his house, and introduces his own wife to him as the bride. The  husband, deceived, but still jealous, facilitates their departure out of  the country, and returns to his tower to find himself deserted.    This story, like that of the _Saracen Friends_, is told by a damsel to a  knight while riding in his company; with this difference, that she is the  heroine of it herself. She is a damsel of a nature still lighter than the  former; and the reader's sympathy with the trouble she brings on herself,  and the way she gets out of it, will be modified accordingly. On the  other hand, nobody can respect the foolish old man with his unwarrantable  marriage; and the moral of Boiardo's story is still useful for these  \"enlightened times,\" though conveyed with an air of levity.    In addition to the classics, the poet has been to the Norman fablers for  his story. The subterranean passage has been more than once repeated in  romance; and the closing incident, the assistance given by the husband  to his wife's elopement, has been imitated in the farce of _Lionel and  Clarissa._    SEEING AND BELIEVING.    My father (said the damsel) is King of the Distant Islands, where the  treasure of the earth is collected. Never was greater wealth known, and I  was heiress of it all.    But it is impossible to foresee what is most to be desired for us in this  world. I was a king's daughter, I was rich, I was handsome, I was lively;  and yet to all those advantages I owed my ill-fortune.    Among other suitors for my hand there came two on the same day, one of  whom was a youth named Ordauro, handsome from head to foot; the other an  old man of seventy, whose name was Folderico. Both were rich and of noble  birth; but the greybeard was counted extremely wise, and of a foresight  more than human. As I did not feel in want of his foresight, the youth  was far more to my taste; and accordingly I listened to him with perfect  good-will, and gave the wise man no sort of encouragement. I was not at  liberty, however, to determine the matter; my father had a voice in it;  so, fearing what he would advise, I thought to secure a good result by  cunning and management. It is an old observation, that the craft of a  woman exceeds all other craft. Indeed, it is Solomon's own saying. But  now-a-days people laugh at it; and I found to my cost that the laugh is  just. I requested my father to proclaim, first, that nobody should have  me in marriage who did not surpass me in swiftness (for I was a damsel of  a mighty agility); and secondly, that he who did surpass me should be my  husband. He consented, and I thought my happiness secure. You must know,  I have run down a bird, and caught it with my own hand.    Well, both my suitors came to the race; the youth on a large war-horse,  trapped with gold, which curvetted in a prodigious manner, and seemed  impatient for a gallop; the old roan on a mule, carrying a great bag at  his side, and looking already tired out. They dismounted on the place  chosen for the trial, which was a meadow. It was encircled by a world of  spectators; and the greybeard and myself (for his age gave him the first  chance) only waited for the sound of the trumpet to set off.    I held my competitor in such contempt, that I let him get the start of  me, on purpose to make him ridiculous; but I was not prepared for his  pulling a golden apple out of his bag, and throwing it as far as he could  in a direction different from that of the goal. The sight of a curiosity  so tempting was too much for my prudence; and it rolled away so roundly,  and to such a distance, that I lost more time in reaching it than I  looked for. Before I overtook the old gentleman, he threw another apple,  and this again led me a chase after it. In short, I blush to say, that,  resolved as I was to be tempted no further, seeing that the end of our  course was now at hand, and my marriage with an old man instead of a  young man was out of the question, he seduced me to give chase to a  third apple, and fairly reached the goal before me. I wept for rage and  disgust, and meditated every species of unconjugal treatment of the old  fox. What right had he to marry such a child as I was? I asked myself the  question at the time; I asked it a thousand times afterwards; and I must  confess, that the more I have tormented him, the more the retaliation  delights me.    However, it was of no use at the moment. The old wretch bore me off  to his domains with an ostentatious triumph; and then, his jealousy  misgiving him, he shut me up in a castle on a rock, where he endeavoured  from that day forth to keep me from the sight of living being. You may  judge what sort of castle it was by its name--_Altamura_ (lofty wall). It  overlooked a desert on three sides, and the sea on the fourth; and a man  might as well have flown as endeavoured to scale it. There was but one  path up to the entrance, very steep and difficult; and when you were  there, you must have pierced outwork after outwork, and picked the lock  of gate after gate. So there sat I in this delicious retreat, hopeless,  and bursting with rage. I called upon death day and night, as my only  refuge. I had no comfort but in seeing my keeper mad with jealousy, even  in that desolate spot. I think he was jealous of the very flies.    My handsome youth, Ordauro, however, had not forgotten me; no, nor even  given me up. Luckily he was not only very clever, but rich besides;  without which, to be sure, his brains would not have availed him a pin.  What does he do, therefore, but take a house in the neighbourhood on the  sea-shore; and while my tormentor, in alarm and horror, watches every  movement, and thinks him coming if he sees a cloud or a bird, Ordauro  sets people secretly to work night and day, and makes a subterraneous  passage up to the very tower! Guess what I felt when I saw him enter!  Assuredly I did not show him the face which I shewed Folderico. I  die with joy this moment to think of my delight. As soon as we could  discourse of any thing but our meeting, Ordauro concerted measures for my  escape; and the greatest difficulty being surmounted by the subterraneous  passage, they at last succeeded. But our enemy gave us a frightful degree  of trouble.    There was no end of the old man's pryings, peepings, and precautions.  He left me as little as possible by myself; and he had all the coast  thereabouts at his command, together with the few boats that ever touched  it.    Ordauro, however, did a thing at once the most bold and the most  ingenious. He gave out that he was married; and inviting my husband to  dinner, who had heard the news with transport, presented me, to his  astonished eyes, for the bride. The old man looked as if he would have  died for rage and misery.    \"Horrible villain!\" cried he,\" what is this?\"    Ordauro professed astonishment in his turn.    \"What!\" asked he; \"do you not know that the princess, your lady's sister,  is wonderfully like her, and that she has done me the honour of becoming  my wife? I invited you in order to do honour to yourself, and so bring  the good families together.\"    \"Detestable falsehood!\" cried Folderico. \"Do you think I'm blind, or a  born idiot? But I'll see to this business directly; and terrible shall be  my revenge.\"    So saying, he flung out, and hastened, as fast as age would let him, to  the room in the tower, where he expected to find me not. But there he did  find me:--there was I, sitting as if nothing had happened, with my hand  on my cheek, and full of my old melancholy.    \"God preserve me!\" exclaimed he; \"this is astonishing indeed! Never could  I have dreamt that one sister could be so like another! But is it so, or  is it not? I have terrible suspicions. It is impossible to believe it.  Tell me truly,\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10657"],[0,"\"De Bello Gallico\" and Other Commentaries (#12)"],[1,"themselves was this.  There were 6000 horse, and as many very active and courageous foot, one  of whom each of the horse selected out of the whole army for his own  protection. By these [foot] they were constantly accompanied in their  engagements; to these the horse retired; these on any emergency rushed  forward; if any one, upon receiving a very severe wound, had fallen from  his horse, they stood around him: if it was necessary to advance  farther: than usual, or to retreat more rapidly, so great, from  practice, was their swiftness, that, supported by the manes of the  horses, they could keep pace with their speed.    XLIX.--Perceiving that Ariovistus kept himself in camp, Caesar, that he  might not any longer be cut off from provisions, chose a convenient  position for a camp beyond that place in which the Germans had encamped,  at about 600 paces from them, and having drawn up his army in three  lines, marched to that place. He ordered the first and second lines to  be under arms; the third to fortify the camp. This place was distant  from the enemy about 600 paces, as has been stated. Thither Ariovistus  sent light troops, about 16,000 men in number, with all his cavalry;  which forces were to intimidate our men, and hinder them in their  fortification. Caesar nevertheless, as he had before arranged, ordered  two lines to drive off the enemy: the third to execute the work. The  camp being fortified, he left there two legions and a portion of the  auxiliaries; and led back the other four legions into the larger camp.    L.--The next day, according to his custom, Caesar led out his forces  from both camps, and having advanced a little from the larger one, drew  up his line of battle, and gave the enemy an opportunity of fighting.  When he found that they did not even then come out [from their  entrenchments], he led back his army into camp about noon. Then at last  Ariovistus sent part of his forces to attack the lesser camp. The battle  was vigorously maintained on both sides till the evening. At sunset,  after many wounds had been inflicted and received, Ariovistus led back  his forces into camp. When Caesar inquired of his prisoners, wherefore  Ariovistus did not come to an engagement, he discovered this to be the  reason--that among the Germans it was the custom for their matrons to  pronounce from lots and divination whether it were expedient that the  battle should be engaged in or not; that they had said, \"that it was not  the will of heaven that the Germans should conquer, if they engaged in  battle before the new moon.\"    LI.--The day following, Caesar left what seemed sufficient as a guard  for both camps; [and then] drew up all the auxiliaries in sight of the  enemy, before the lesser camp, because he was not very powerful in the  number of legionary soldiers, considering the number of the enemy; that  [thereby] he might make use of his auxiliaries for appearance. He  himself, having drawn up his army in three lines, advanced to the camp  of the enemy. Then at last of necessity the Germans drew their forces  out of camp, and disposed them canton by canton, at equal distances, the  Harudes, Marcomanni, Tribocci, Vangiones, Nemetes, Sedusii, Suevi; and  surrounded their whole army with their chariots and waggons, that no  hope might be left in flight. On these they placed their women, who,  with dishevelled hair and in tears, entreated the soldiers, as they went  forward to battle, not to deliver them into slavery to the Romans.    LII.--Caesar appointed over each legion a lieutenant and a questor, that  every one might have them as witnesses of his valour. He himself began  the battle at the head of the right wing, because he had observed that  part of the enemy to be the least strong. Accordingly our men, upon the  signal being given, vigorously made an attack upon the enemy, and the  enemy so suddenly and rapidly rushed forward, that there was no time for  casting the javelins at them. Throwing aside [therefore] their javelins,  they fought with swords hand to hand. But the Germans, according to  their custom, rapidly forming a phalanx, sustained the attack of our  swords. There were found very many of our soldiers who leaped upon the  phalanx, and with their hands tore away the shields, and wounded the  enemy from above. Although the army of the enemy was routed on the left  wing and put to flight, they [still] pressed heavily on our men from the  right wing, by the great number of their troops. On observing which, P.  Crassus, a young man, who commanded the cavalry--as he was more  disengaged than those who were employed in the fight--sent the third  line as a relief to our men who were in distress.    LIII.--Thereupon the engagement was renewed, and all the enemy turned  their backs, nor did they cease to flee until they arrived at the river  Rhine, about fifty miles from that place. There some few, either relying  on their strength, endeavoured to swim over, or, finding boats, procured  their safety. Among the latter was Ariovistus, who meeting with a small  vessel tied to the bank, escaped in it: our horse pursued and slew all  the rest of them. Ariovistus had two wives, one a Suevan by nation, whom  he had brought with him from home; the other a Norican, the sister of  king Vocion, whom he had married in Gaul, she having been sent [thither  for that purpose] by her brother. Both perished in that flight. Of their  two daughters, one was slain, the other captured. C. Valerius Procillus,  as he was being dragged by his guards in the flight, bound with a triple  chain, fell into the hands of Caesar himself, as he was pursuing the  enemy with his cavalry. This circumstance indeed afforded Caesar no less  pleasure than the victory itself; because he saw a man of the first rank  in the province of Gaul, his intimate acquaintance and friend, rescued  from the hand of the enemy, and restored to him, and that fortune had  not diminished aught of the joy and exultation [of that day] by his  destruction. He [Procillus] said that in his own presence the lots had  been thrice consulted respecting him, whether he should immediately be  put to death by fire, or be reserved for another time: that by the  favour of the lots he was uninjured. M. Mettius, also, was found and  brought back to him [Caesar].    LIV.--This battle having been reported beyond the Rhine, the Suevi, who  had come to the banks of that river, began to return home, when the  Ubii, who dwelt nearest to the Rhine, pursuing them, while much alarmed,  slew a great number of them. Caesar having concluded two very important  wars in one campaign, conducted his army into winter quarters among the  Sequani, a little earlier than the season of the year required. He  appointed Labienus over the winter quarters, and set out in person for  Hither Gaul to hold the assizes.        BOOK II    I.--While Caesar was in winter quarters in Hither Gaul, as we have shown  above, frequent reports were brought to him, and he was also informed by  letters from Labienus, that all the Belgae, who we have said are a third  part of Gaul, were entering into a confederacy against the Roman people,  and giving hostages to one another; that the reasons of the confederacy  were these--first, because they feared that, after all [Celtic] Gaul was  subdued, our army would be led against them; secondly, because they were  instigated by several of the Gauls; some of whom as [on the one hand]  they had been unwilling that the Germans should remain any longer in  Gaul, so [on the other] they were dissatisfied that the army of the  Roman people should pass the winter in it, and settle there; and others  of them, from a natural instability and fickleness of disposition, were  anxious for a revolution; [the Belgae were instigated] by several, also,  because the government in Gaul was generally seized upon by the more  powerful persons and by those who had the means of hiring troops, and  they could less easily effect this object under our dominion.    II.--Alarmed by these tidings and letters, Caesar levied two new legions  in Hither Gaul, and, at the beginning of summer, sent Q. Pedius, his  lieutenant, to conduct them further into Gaul. He himself, as soon as  there began to be plenty of forage, came to the army. He gives a  commission to the Senones and the other Gauls who were neighbours of the  Belgae, to learn what is going on amongst them [_i.e._ the Belgae], and  inform him of these matters. These all uniformly reported that troops  were being raised, and that an army was being collected in one place.  Then, indeed, he thought that he ought not to hesitate about proceeding  towards them, and having provided supplies, moves his camp, and in about  fifteen days arrives at the territories of the Belgae.    III.--As he arrived there unexpectedly and sooner than any one  anticipated, the Remi, who are the nearest of the Belgae to [Celtic]  Gaul, sent to him Iccius and Antebrogius, [two of] the principal persons  of the state, as their ambassadors: to tell him that they surrendered  themselves and all their possessions to the protection and disposal of  the Roman people: and that they had neither combined with the rest of  the Belgae, nor entered into any confederacy against the Roman people:  and were prepared to give hostages, to obey his commands, to receive him  into their towns, and to aid him with corn and other things; that all  the rest of the Belgae were in arms; and that the Germans, who dwell on  this side the Rhine, had joined themselves to them; and that so great  was the infatuation of them all that they could not restrain even the  Suessiones, their own brethren and kinsmen, who enjoy the same rights,  and the same laws, and who have one government and one magistracy [in  common] with themselves, from uniting with them.    IV.--When Caesar inquired of them what states were in arms, how powerful  they were, and what they could do in war, he received the"]]]
