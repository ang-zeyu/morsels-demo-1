Upon this the Weymouth boats came back with such diligence that in less  than three hours they were on board them again with an anchor and cable,  which they immediately bent in its place, and let go to assist the other,  and thereby secured the ship.  It is true that they took a good price of  the master for the help they gave him; for they made him draw a bill on  his owners at London for 12 pounds for the use of the anchor, cable, and  boat, besides some gratuities to the men.  But they saved the ship and  cargo by it, and in three or four days the weather was calm, and he  proceeded on his voyage, returning the anchor and cable again; so that,  upon the whole, it was not so extravagant as at first I thought it to be.    The Isle of Portland, on which the castle I mentioned stands, lies right  against this Port of Weymouth.  Hence it is that our best and whitest  freestone comes, with which the Cathedral of St. Paul's, the Monument,  and all the public edifices in the City of London are chiefly built; and  it is wonderful, and well worth the observation of a traveller, to see  the quarries in the rocks from whence they are cut out, what stones, and  of what prodigious a size are cut out there.    The island is indeed little more than one continued rock of freestone,  and the height of the land is such that from this island they see in  clear weather above half over the Channel to France, though the Channel  here is very broad.  The sea off of this island, and especially to the  west of it, is counted the most dangerous part of the British Channel.  Due south, there is almost a continued disturbance in the waters, by  reason of what they call two tides meeting, which I take to be no more  than the sets of the currents from the French coast and from the English  shore meeting: this they call Portland Race; and several ships, not aware  of these currents, have been embayed to the west of Portland, and been  driven on shore on the beach (of which I shall speak presently), and  there lost.    To prevent this danger, and guide the mariner in these distresses, they  have within these few months set up two lighthouses on the two points of  that island; and they had not been many months set up, with the  directions given to the public for their bearings, but we found three  outward-bound East India ships which were in distress in the night, in a  hard extreme gale of wind, were so directed by those lights that they  avoided going on shore by it, which, if the lights had not been there,  would inevitably happened to their destruction.    This island, though seemingly miserable, and thinly inhabited, yet the  inhabitants being almost all stone-cutters, we found there were no very  poor people among them, and when they collected money for the re-building  St. Paul's, they got more in this island than in the great town of  Dorchester, as we were told.    Though Portland stands a league off from the mainland of Britain, yet it  is almost joined by a prodigious riff of beach--that is to say, of small  stones cast up by the sea--which runs from the island so near the shore  of England that they ferry over with a boat and a rope, the water not  being above half a stone's-throw over; and the said riff of beach ending,  as it were, at that inlet of water, turns away west, and runs parallel  with the shore quite to Abbotsbury, which is a town about seven miles  beyond Weymouth.    I name this for two reasons: first, to explain again what I said before  of ships being embayed and lost here.  This is when ships coming from the  westward omit to keep a good offing, or are taken short by contrary  winds, and cannot weather the high land of Portland, but are driven  between Portland and the mainland.  If they can come to an anchor, and  ride it out, well and good; and if not, they run on shore on that vast  beach and are lost without remedy.    On the inside of this beach, and between it and the land, there is, as I  have said, an inlet of water which they ferry over, as above, to pass and  re-pass to and from Portland: this inlet opens at about two miles west,  and grows very broad, and makes a kind of lake within the land of a mile  and a half broad, and near three miles in length, the breadth unequal.  At  the farthest end west of this water is a large duck-coy, and the verge of  the water well grown with wood, and proper groves of trees for cover for  the fowl: in the open lake, or broad part, is a continual assembly of  swans: here they live, feed, and breed, and the number of them is such  that, I believe, I did not see so few as 7,000 or 8,000.  Here they are  protected, and here they breed in abundance.  We saw several of them upon  the wing, very high in the air, whence we supposed that they flew over  the riff of beach, which parts the lake from the sea, to feed on the  shores as they thought fit, and so came home again at their leisure.    From this duck-coy west, the lake narrows, and at last almost closes,  till the beach joins the shore; and so Portland may be said, not to be an  island, but part of the continent.  And now we came to Abbotsbury, a town  anciently famous for a great monastery, and now eminent for nothing but  its ruins.    From hence we went on to Bridport, a pretty large corporation town on the  sea-shore, though without a harbour.  Here we saw boats all the way on  the shore, fishing for mackerel, which they take in the easiest manner  imaginable; for they fix one end of the net to a pole set deep into the  sand, then, the net being in a boat, they row right out into the water  some length, then turn and row parallel with the shore, veering out the  net all the while, till they have let go all the net, except the line at  the end, and then the boat rows on shore, when the men, hauling the net  to the shore at both ends, bring to shore with it such fish as they  surrounded in the little way they rowed.  This, at that time, proved to  be an incredible number, insomuch that the men could hardly draw them on  shore.  As soon as the boats had brought their fish on shore we observed  a guard or watch placed on the shore in several places, who, we found,  had their eye, not on the fishermen, but on the country people who came  down to the shore to buy their fish; and very sharp we found they were,  and some that came with small carts were obliged to go back empty without  any fish.  When we came to inquire into the particulars of this, we found  that these were officers placed on the shore by the justices and  magistrates of the towns about, who were ordered to prevent the country  farmers buying the mackerel to dung their land with them, which was  thought to be dangerous as to infection.  In short, such was the plenty  of fish that year that the mackerel, the finest and largest I ever saw,  were sold at the seaside a hundred for a penny.    From Bridport (a town in which we see nothing remarkable) we came to  Lyme, the town particularly made famous by the landing of the Duke of  Monmouth and his unfortunate troops in the time of King James II., of  which I need say nothing, the history of it being so recent in the memory  of so many living.    This is a town of good figure, and has in it several eminent merchants  who carry on a considerable trade to France, Spain, Newfoundland, and the  Straits; and though they have neither creek or bay, road or river, they  have a good harbour, but it is such a one as is not in all Britain  besides, if there is such a one in any part of the world.    It is a massy pile of building, consisting of high and thick walls of  stone, raised at first with all the methods that skill and art could  devise, but maintained now with very little difficulty.  The walls are  raised in the main sea at a good distance from the shore; it consists of  one main and solid wall of stone, large enough for carts and carriages to  pass on the top, and to admit houses and warehouses to be built on it, so  that it is broad as a street.  Opposite to this, but farther into the  sea, is another wall of the same workmanship, which crosses the end of  the first wall and comes about with a tail parallel to the first wall.    Between the point of the first or main wall is the entrance into the  port, and the second or opposite wall, breaking the violence of the sea  from the entrance, the ships go into the basin as into a pier or harbour,  and ride there as secure as in a millpond or as in a wet dock.    The townspeople have the benefit of this wonderful harbour, and it is  carefully kept in repair, as indeed it behoves them to do; but they could  give me nothing of the history of it, nor do they, as I could perceive,  know anything of the original of it, or who built it.  It was lately  almost beaten down by a storm, but is repaired again.    This work is called the Cobb.  The Custom House officers have a lodge and  warehouse upon it, and there were several ships of very good force and  rich in value in the basin of it when I was there.  It might be  strengthened with a fort, and the walls themselves are firm enough to  carry what guns they please to plant upon it; but they did not seem to  think it needful, and as the shore is convenient for batteries, they have  some guns planted in proper places, both for the defence of the Cobb and  the town also.    This town is under the government of a mayor and aldermen, and may pass  for a place of wealth, considering the bigness of it.  Here, we found,  the merchants began to trade in the pilchard-fishing, though not to so  considerable a degree as they do farther west--the pilchards seldom"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11498"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 601, July 9, 1887 (#12)"],[1,"specks and small pits, and a  stack of them often looks uninviting; yet a skillful bricklayer, by  throwing out the worst, by placing those of bad colors or much out of  shape in the heart of the wall, and by bringing to the front the best  end or side of those bricks which form part of the face, can always make  the bricks in his work look far better than in the stack. Another  important group is the group of Suffolk and Norfolk bricks, red and  white. These are very largely employed as facing bricks and for arches  and cut mouldings.    Moulded bricks are also to a large extent made of the same material.  These bricks are brought to London in large quantities. They have a  sanded face, are mostly square, true, and of uniform color, but they are  usually porous, soft, and absorbent. Still, they are in great demand as  facing bricks, and the moulded bricks enable the architect to produce  many architectural effects at a moderate outlay. These fields furnish  many sorts of bricks, which are called rubbers, and which are employed  (as malm stocks also are) for arches of the more elaborate sort, where  each brick is cut to its shape and rubbed true, and for mouldings, and  even sometimes for carving.    Mouldings that are formed by cutting the bricks can be got more  perfectly true than when moulded bricks are used; but the expense is  greater, and when it is done the material is less durable, for the  softer sorts of brick are naturally used for cutting, and the moulded  face is less sound than the original burnt face of any brick. Red bricks  are to some extent made in fields within easy reach of London; but the  best come from some distance. Red Suffolk bricks have been alluded to.  There is a considerable importation of red Fareham bricks, brought all  the way from the vicinity of Portsmouth; these are good both in quality  and color. Good red bricks are also now made at Ascot, and are being  used to a considerable extent in the metropolis. A strawberry-colored  brick from Luton has been extensively used at Hampstead. It is hard, and  of a color which contrasts well with stone, but not very pleasing used  alone. Glazed bricks of all colors are obtainable. They are usually very  hard and square, and the use of them where an impervious glazed face is  required, as, for example, in a good stable, is better than the  employment of glazed tiles, in the employment of which there is always a  possibility of part of the lining becoming loose or falling off. There  is a difficulty in obtaining a large quantity (of some colors, at least)  exactly uniform in tint. Bricks with a very hard face, but not glazed,  are obtainable. What is called a washing brick is now made in various  colors, adapted for the lining of interiors, and there are hard bricks  of a very pale straw color, known as Beart's patent bricks, made, I  believe, of gault clay, which were some years ago bought up by the Great  Northern Railway in large numbers. These bricks have the peculiarity of  being pierced with holes about 1/2 in. in diameter, passing quite through  the brick, and they are extremely hard, partly because these holes  permit the hot air and smoke in the kiln to approach very near to the  interior of the brick. I am of opinion that the glazed or dull qualities  of hard bricks might with great advantage be often introduced into  London streets. What we want is something that will wash. The rough  surface of stocks or Suffolk facing bricks catches the black in the  London atmosphere and gradually gets dark and dull. A perfectly hard  face is washed clean by every shower. A good many years ago I built a  warehouse with stock bricks, and formed the arches, strings, etc., of  bricks with a very hard face, and, as I expected, the effect of time has  been to make these features stand out far better than when they were  fresh; in fact, the only question is whether they have not now become  too conspicuous. To return to the bricks in the London market: we have  firebricks made of fireclay, and almost vitrified and capable of  standing intense heat. These are used for lining furnaces, ovens, flues,  etc.    Then we have almost, if not quite, as refractory a material in  Staffordshire blue bricks, used--in various forms--for paving channels,  jambs of archways, etc. There are also small bricks called clinkers,  chiefly used for stable paving. Dutch clinkers, formerly imported  largely from Holland, were small, rough bricks, laid on edge, and  affording a good foothold for the horse. Adamantine clinkers, made of  gault clay, are much used; they must have chamfered edges, otherwise  they make too smooth a floor for a stable. Many other varieties are  obtainable in London, and are more or less used, but these are the most  prominent. In many parts of England special varieties of brick are to be  found, and every here and there one falls upon a good brickmaker who is  able to produce good moulded or embossed or ornamental bricks, such as  those which have been supplied to me years ago by Mr. Gunton, and more  recently by Mr. Brown, both of Norwich, or by Mr. Cooper, of Maidenhead.    It is of importance to those whose business it is to look after or  engage in building operations, that they should early learn what to look  out for in each material. Of course, a man only becomes a judge of  bricks, or timber, or stone by experience; but he is far better able to  take the benefit of experience when it comes to him if he knows from the  first to what points to direct attention. Wherefore I make no apology  for trying to put before you the points of a good brick, and in doing so  I shall partly quote from a memorandum published now a good many years  ago by the Manchester Society of Architects.    A good brick is uniform in size; standard, 9 by 41/2 by 21/2 in.; weight  about 7 lb. each = 110 lb. per foot cube; is rectangular, true faced,  but only one end and one side need be smooth; has no print sinking on  either face, but a hollow on one or both beds. When saturated with  water, a brick should not absorb more than 20 per cent, of its own  weight of water, should absorb it reluctantly, and part with it freely  at ordinary temperatures. It should be uniformly burnt, should be sound,  free from cracks, flaws, stones, lumps of any kind, but especially lumps  of lime, should be of a good color for its sort (whether red, yellow, or  white), should have a metallic clang when two bricks are struck  together; when broken should be sound right through, should be tough and  pasty in texture, not granular, and should require repeated blows to  break it, rather than one hard blow (such bricks will withstand cartage  and handling best). So much for bricks. To make brickwork, however,  another ingredient is required--namely, mortar or cement.    All mortars and, in fact, all the cementing materials used (except  bituminous ones) in bricklaying have lime as their base, and depend upon  the setting quality of quicklime, which has to be mixed with sand or  some suitable substitute for it, to make mortars. Limes and cements are  far too wide a subject to be dealt with as part of an evening's lecture  on another topic, and no doubt they will hereafter form the subject of a  lecture or lectures. To-night I propose only to remind you that there  are such substances as these, and that they possess certain qualities  and are obtainable and available for the bricklayer's purposes, without  attempting an investigation into the chemistry of cements, or their  manufacture, etc. Ordinarily, brickwork may be divided into brickwork in  mortar and in cement; but there are many qualities of mortar and several  sorts of cement. Mortar made with what are called fat or rich  limes--that is to say, nearly pure lime, such as is got by calcining  marble or pure chalk--sets slowly, with difficulty, and is rarely  tenacious. Burnt clay or brick reduced to powder improves the setting of  such lime, especially if the two materials be calcined together; so will  an admixture of cement. Mortar made with what is known as slightly  hydraulic lime, that is to say, lime containing a small proportion of  clay, such as the gray stone lime of Dorking, Merstham, and that  neighborhood, sets well, and is tenacious and strong. Mortar made with  hydraulic lime, that is to say, lime with a considerable admixture of  clay, such as the lias lime, sets under water or in contact with wet  earth. It is best to use this lime ground to powder, and not to mix so  much sand with it as is used with stone lime. A sort of mortar called  selenitic mortar, the invention of the late General Scott, has been made  use of in many of the buildings of the School Board for London, and was  first employed on a large scale in the erection of the Albert Hall. The  peculiarity consists in the addition of a small dose of plaster of Paris  (sulphate of lime) very carefully introduced and intimately mixed. The  result is that the mortar so made sets rapidly, and is very hard.    It is claimed that a larger proportion of sand can be used with  selenitic lime than with ordinary, thus counterbalancing the extra  expense occasioned by royalty under the patent and special care in  mixing. When a limestone contains 20 to 40 per cent, of clay, it becomes  what is called a cement, and its behavior is different from that of  limestones with less clay. Ordinary limestones are, as you know,  calcined in a kiln. The material which comes from the kiln is called  quicklime, and, on being dosed with water, it slakes, and crumbles to  powder, and in the state of slaked lime is mixed up with mortar. Cement  stones are also calcined; but the resulting material will not fall to  pieces or slake under water. It must be ground very fine, and when  moistened sets rapidly, and as well under water as in air, and becomes  very hard and is very tenacious. Brickwork in mortar will always settle  and compress to some extent. Not so brickwork in cement,"]]]
