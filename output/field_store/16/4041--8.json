But she will conceal a mortal grief in her  heart, and think she omitted something in the composition of her  cake. As for the other cake, you shall make a present of it to her  and press her to eat it; which she will not refuse to do, were it  only to convince you she does not mistrust you, though she has  given you so much reason to mistrust her. When she has eaten of it,  take a little water in the hollow of your hand, and throwing it in  her face, say, \"Quit that form you now wear, and take that of such  and such an animal\" as you think fit; which done, come to me with  the animal, and I will tell you what you shall do afterwards.'    King Beder thanked Abdallah in the most expressive terms, and took  his leave of him and returned to the palace. Upon his arrival, he  understood that the queen waited for him with great impatience in  the garden. He went to her, and she no sooner perceived him, than  she came in great haste to meet him. 'My dear Beder!' said she, 'it  seems ages since I have been separated from you. If you had stayed  ever so little longer, I was preparing to come and fetch you.'    'Madam,' replied King Beder, 'I can assure your majesty I was no  less impatient to rejoin you; but I could not refuse to stay a  little longer with an uncle that loves me, and had not seen me for  so long a time. He would have kept me still longer, but I tore  myself away from him, to come where love calls me. Of all he  prepared for me, I have only brought away this cake, which I desire  your majesty to accept.' King Beder had wrapped up one of the two  cakes in a handkerchief very neatly, took it out, and presented it  to the queen, saying, 'I beg your majesty to accept it.'    'I do accept it with all my heart,' replied the queen, 'and will  eat it with pleasure for your and your good uncle's sake; but  before I taste it, I desire you for my sake to eat a piece of this,  which I have made for you during your absence.'    'Fair queen,' answered King Beder, receiving it with great respect,  I cannot sufficiently acknowledge the favour you do me.'    King Beder then artfully substituted in the place of the queen's  cake the other which old Abdallah had given him, and having broken  off a piece, he put it in his mouth, and cried, while he was  eating, 'Ah! queen, I never tasted anything so charming in my  life.'    Being near a cascade, as the sorceress saw him swallow one bit of  the cake, and ready to eat another, she took a little water in the  palm of her hand, throwing it in the king's face, said, 'Wretch!  quit that form of a man, and take that of a vile horse, blind and  lame.'    These words not having the desired effect, the sorceress was  strangely surprised to find King Beder still in the same form, and  that he only started for fear. Her cheeks reddened; and as she saw  that she had missed her aim, 'Dear Beder,' cried she, 'this is  nothing; recover yourself. I did not intend you any harm; I only  did it to see what you would say.'    'Powerful queen,' replied King Beder, 'persuaded as I am that what  your majesty did was only to divert yourself, yet I could not help  being surprised. But, madam,' continued he, 'let us drop this, and  since I have eaten your cake, would you do me the favour to taste  mine?'    Queen Labe, who could not better justify herself than by showing  this mark of confidence in the King of Persia, broke off a piece of  his cake, and ate it. She had no sooner swallowed it than she  appeared much troubled, and remained as it were motionless. King  Beder lost no time, but took water out of the same basin, and  throwing it in her face, cried, 'Abominable sorceress! quit that  form of a woman, and be turned instantly into a mare.'    The same instant Queen Labe was transformed into a very beautiful  mare; and her confusion was so great to find herself in that  condition, that she shed tears in great abundance, which perhaps no  mare before had ever been known to do. She bowed her head to the  feet of King Beder, thinking to move him to compassion; but though  he could have been so moved, it was absolutely out of his power to  repair the mischief he had done. He led her into the stable  belonging to the palace, and put her into the hands of a groom, to  bridle and saddle; but of all the bridles which the groom tried  upon her, not one would fit her. This made him cause two horses to  be saddled, one for the groom, and the other for himself; and the  groom led the mare after him to old Abdallah's.    Abdallah, seeing at a distance King Beder coming with the mare,  doubted not but he had done what he advised him. 'Hateful  sorceress!' said he immediately to himself in a transport of joy,  'Heaven has at length punished thee as thou deservest.' King Beder  alighted at Abdallah's door, and entered the shop, embracing and  thanking him for all the signal services he had done him. He  related to him the whole matter, and told him that he could find no  bridle fit for the mare. Abdallah, who had one for every horse,  bridled the mare himself, and as soon as King Beder had sent back  the groom with the two horses, he said to him, 'My lord, you have  no reason to stay any longer in this city: mount the mare, and  return to your kingdom. I have but one thing more to recommend to  you; and that is, if you should ever happen to part with the mare,  be sure not to give up the bridle.' King Beder promised to remember  it; and having taken leave of the good old man, he departed.    The young King of Persia no sooner got out of the city, than he  began to reflect with joy on the deliverance he had had, and that  he had the sorceress in his power, who had given him so much cause  to tremble. Three days after he arrived at a great city, where,  entering the suburbs, he met a venerable old man. 'Sir,' said the  old man, stopping him, 'may I presume to ask from what part of the  world you come?' The king stopped to tell him, and as they were  discoursing together, an old woman came up; who, stopping likewise,  wept and sighed bitterly at the sight of the mare.    King Beder and the old man left off discoursing, to look at the old  woman, whom the king asked what cause she had to lament so much,  'Alas! sir,' replied she, 'it is because your mare resembles so  perfectly one my son had, which I still mourn the loss of on his  account. I should think yours were the same, did I not know she was  dead. Sell her to me, I beseech you: I will give you more than she  is worth, and thank you too.'    'Good woman,' replied King Beder, 'I am heartily sorry I cannot  comply with your request: my mare is not to be sold.'    'Alas! sir,' continued the old woman, 'do not refuse me this  favour. My son and I will certainly die with grief if you do not  grant it.'    'Good mother,' replied the king, 'I would grant it with all my  heart, if I was disposed to part with so good a beast; but if I  were so disposed, I believe you would hardly give a thousand pieces  of gold for her, and I could not sell her for less.'    'Why should I not give so much?' replied the old woman: 'if that be  the lowest price, you need only say you will take it, and I will  fetch you the money.'    King Beder, seeing the old woman so poorly dressed, could not  imagine she could find the money; therefore to try her, he said,  'Go, fetch me the money, and the mare is yours.' The old woman  immediately unloosed a purse she had fastened to her girdle, and  desiring him to alight, bade him tell over the money, and in case  he found it came short of the sum demanded, she said her house was  not far off, and she could quickly fetch the rest.    The surprise of King Beder, at the sight of this purse, was not  small. 'Good woman,' said he, 'do you not perceive I have been  bantering you all this while? I assure you my mare is not to be  sold.'    The old man, who had been witness to all that was said, now began  to speak. 'Son,' quoth he to King Beder, 'it is necessary you  should know one thing, which I find you are ignorant of; and that  is, that in this city it is not permitted to any one to tell a lie,  on any account whatsoever, on pain of death. You cannot refuse  taking this good woman's money, and delivering your mare, when she  gives you the sum according to the agreement; and this you had  better do without any noise, than expose yourself to what may  happen.'    King Beder, sorely afflicted to find himself thus trapped by his  rash offer, alighted with great regret. The old woman stood ready  to seize the bridle, and immediately unbridled the mare, and taking  some water in her hand, from a stream that ran in the middle of the  street, she threw it in the mare's face, uttering these words,  'Daughter, quit that strange shape, and re-assume thine own.' The  transformation was effected in a moment, and King Beder, who  swooned as soon as he saw Queen Labe appear, would have fallen to  the ground, if the old man had not caught him.    The old woman, who was mother to Queen Labe, and had instructed her  in all her magic secrets, had no sooner embraced her daughter, than  to show her fury, she whistled. Immediately rose a genie of  gigantic form and stature. This genie took King Beder on one  shoulder, and the old woman with the magic queen on the other, and  transported them in a few minutes to the palace of Queen Labe in  the City of Enchantments.    The magic queen immediately fell upon King Beder, 'Is it thus,  ungrateful wretch,' said she, 'that thou and thy unworthy uncle  repay me for all the kindnesses I have done for you? I shall soon  make you both feel what you deserve.' She said no more, but taking  water in her hand, threw it in his face with these words, 'Come out  of that shape, and take that of a vile owl.'

Unlike as was the English queen to a fairy queen, we may yet conceive  that it was the image of a queen before the poet's mind that called up  this splendid court of women. Shakspeare's range is also great; but he  has left out the heroic characters, such as the Macaria of Greece, the  Britomart of Spenser. Ford and Massinger have, in this respect, soared  to a higher flight of feeling than he. It was the holy and heroic  Woman they most loved, and if they could not paint an Imogen, a  Desdemona, a Rosalind, yet, in those of a stronger mould, they showed  a higher ideal, though with so much less poetic power to embody it,  than we see in Portia or Isabella, the simple truth of Cordelia,  indeed, is of this sort. The beauty of Cordelia is neither male nor  female; it is the beauty of virtue.    The ideal of love and marriage rose high in the mind of all the  Christian nations who were capable of grave and deep feeling. We may  take as examples of its English aspect the lines,      \"I could not love thee, dear, so much,       Loved I not honor more.\"      Or the address of the Commonwealth's man to his wife, as she looked  out from the Tower window to see him, for the last time, on his way to  the scaffold. He stood up in the cart, waved his hat, and cried, \"To  Heaven, my love, to Heaven, and leave you in the storm!\"    Such was the love of faith and honor,--a love which stopped, like  Colonel Hutchinson's, \"on this side idolatry,\" because it was  religious. The meeting of two such souls Donne describes as giving  birth to an \"abler soul.\"    Lord Herbert wrote to his love,      \"Were not our souls immortal made,     Our equal loves can make them such.\"      In the \"Broken Heart,\" of Ford, Penthea, a character which engages my  admiration even more deeply than the famous one of Calanthe, is made  to present to the mind the most beautiful picture of what these  relations should be in their purity. Her life cannot sustain the  violation of what she so clearly feels.    Shakspeare, too, saw that, in true love, as in fire, the utmost ardor  is coincident with the utmost purity. It is a true lover that exclaims  in the agony of Othello,      \"If thou art false, O then Heaven mocks Itself!\"      The son, framed, like Hamlet, to appreciate truth in all the beauty of  relations, sinks into deep melancholy when he finds his natural  expectations disappointed. He has no other. She to whom he gave the  name, disgraces from his heart's shrine all the sex.      \"Frailty, thy name is Woman.\"      It is because a Hamlet could find cause to say so, that I have put the  line, whose stigma has never been removed, at the head of my work.  But, as a lover, surely Hamlet would not have so far mistaken, as to  have finished with such a conviction. He would have felt the faith of  Othello, and that faith could not, in his more dispassionate mind,  have been disturbed by calumny.    In Spain, this thought is arrayed in a sublimity which belongs to the  sombre and passionate genius of the nation. Calderon's Justina resists  all the temptation of the Demon, and raises her lover, with her, above  the sweet lures of mere temporal happiness. Their marriage is vowed at  the stake; their goals are liberated together by the martyr flame into  \"a purer state of sensation and existence.\"    In Italy, the great poets wove into their lives an ideal love which  answered to the highest wants. It included those of the intellect and  the affections, for it was a love of spirit for spirit. It was not  ascetic, or superhuman, but, interpreting all things, gave their  proper beauty to details of the common life, the common day. The poet  spoke of his love, not as a flower to place in his bosom, or hold  carelessly in his hand, but as a light toward which he must find wings  to fly, or \"a stair to heaven.\" He delighted to speak of her, not only  as the bride of his heart, but the mother of his soul; for he saw  that, in cases where the right direction had been taken, the greater  delicacy of her frame and stillness of her life left her more open  than is Man to spiritual influx. So he did not look upon her as  betwixt him and earth, to serve his temporal needs, but, rather,  betwixt him and heaven, to purify his affections and lead him to  wisdom through love. He sought, in her, not so much the Eve as the  Madonna.    In these minds the thought, which gleams through all the legends of  chivalry, shines in broad intellectual effulgence, not to be  misinterpreted; and their thought is reverenced by the world, though  it lies far from the practice of the world as yet,--so far that it  seems as though a gulf of death yawned between.    Even with such men the practice was, often, widely different from the  mental faith. I say mental; for if the heart were thoroughly alive  with it, the practice could not be dissonant. Lord Herbert's was a  marriage of convention, made for him at fifteen; he was not  discontented with it, but looked only to the advantages it brought of  perpetuating his family on the basis of a great fortune. He paid, in  act, what he considered a dutiful attention to the bond; his thoughts  travelled elsewhere; and while forming a high ideal of the  companionship of minds in marriage, he seems never to have doubted  that its realization must be postponed to some other state of being.  Dante, almost immediately after the death of Beatrice, married a lady  chosen for him by his friends, and Boccaccio, in describing the  miseries that attended, in this case,      \"The form of an union where union is none,\"      speaks as if these were inevitable to the connection, and as if the  scholar and poet, especially, could expect nothing but misery and  obstruction in a domestic partnership with Woman.    Centuries have passed since, but civilized Europe is still in a  transition state about marriage; not only in practice but in thought.  It is idle to speak with contempt of the nations where polygamy is an  institution, or seraglios a custom, while practices far more debasing  haunt, well-nigh fill, every city and every town, and so far as union  of one with one is believed to be the only pure form of marriage, a  great majority of societies and individuals are still doubtful whether  the earthly bond must be a meeting of souls, or only supposes a  contract of convenience and utility. Were Woman established in the  rights of an immortal being, this could not be. She would not, in some  countries, be given away by her father, with scarcely more respect for  her feelings than is shown by the Indian chief, who sells his daughter  for a horse, and beats her if she runs away from her new home. Nor, in  societies where her choice is left free, would she be perverted, by  the current of opinion that seizes her, into the belief that she must  marry, if it be only to find a protector, and a home of her own.  Neither would Man, if he thought the connection of permanent  importance, form it so lightly. He would not deem it a trifle, that he  was to enter into the closest relations with another soul, which, if  not eternal in themselves, must eternally affect his growth. Neither,  did he believe Woman capable of friendship, [Footnote: See Appendix D,  Spinoza's view] would he, by rash haste, lose the chance of finding a  friend in the person who might, probably, live half a century by his  side. Did love, to his mind, stretch forth into infinity, he would not  miss his chance of its revelations, that he might the sooner rest from  his weariness by a bright fireside, and secure a sweet and graceful  attendant \"devoted to him alone.\" Were he a step higher, he would not  carelessly enter into a relation where he might not be able to do the  duty of a friend, as well as a protector from external ill, to the  other party, and have a being in his power pining for sympathy,  intelligence and aid, that he could not give.    What deep communion, what real intercourse is implied in sharing the  joys and cares of parentage, when any degree of equality is admitted  between the parties! It is true that, in a majority of instances, the  man looks upon his wife as an adopted child, and places her to the  other children in the relation of nurse or governess, rather than that  of parent. Her influence with them is sure; but she misses the  education which should enlighten that influence, by being thus  treated. It is the order of nature that children should complete the  education, moral and mental, of parents, by making them think what is  needed for the best culture of human beings, and conquer all faults  and impulses that interfere with their giving this to these dear  objects, who represent the world to them. Father and mother should  assist one another to learn what is required for this sublime  priesthood of Nature. But, for this, a religious recognition of  equality is required.    Where this thought of equality begins to diffuse itself, it is shown  in four ways.    First;--The household partnership. In our country, the woman looks for  a \"smart but kind\" husband; the man for a \"capable, sweet-tempered\"  wife. The man furnishes the house; the woman regulates it. Their  relation is one of mutual esteem, mutual dependence. Their talk is of  business; their affection shows itself by practical kindness. They  know that life goes more smoothly and cheerfully to each for the  other's aid; they are grateful and content. The wife praises her  husband as a \"good provider;\" the husband, in return, compliments her  as a \"capital housekeeper.\"   This relation is good so far as it goes.    Next comes a closer tie, which takes the form either of mutual  idolatry or of intellectual companionship. The first, we suppose, is  to no one a pleasing subject of contemplation. The parties weaken and  narrow one another; they lock the gate"]]]
