OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNKNOWN WRITERS. The belief is common among novices  that because they are unknown their work is likely to receive little or  no consideration from editors. As a matter of fact, in the majority of  newspaper and magazine offices all unsolicited manuscripts are  considered strictly on their merits. The unknown writer has as good a  chance as anybody of having his manuscript accepted, provided that his  work has merit comparable with that of more experienced writers.    With the exception of certain newspapers that depend entirely on  syndicates for their special features, and of a few popular magazines  that have the staff system or that desire only the work of well-known  writers, every publication welcomes special articles and short stories  by novices. Moreover, editors take pride in the fact that from time to  time they \"discover\" writers whose work later proves popular. They not  infrequently tell how they accepted a short story, an article, or some  verse by an author of whom they had never before heard, because they  were impressed with the quality of it, and how the verdict of their  readers confirmed their own judgment.    The relatively small number of amateurs who undertake special articles,  compared with the hundreds of thousands who try their hand at short  stories, makes the opportunities for special feature writers all the  greater. Then, too, the number of professional writers of special  articles is comparatively small. This is particularly true of writers  who are able effectively to popularize scientific and technical  material, as well as of those who can present in popular form the  results of social and economic investigations.    It is not too much to say, therefore, that any writer who is willing (1)  to study the interests and the needs of newspaper and magazine readers,  (2) to gather carefully the material for his articles, and (3) to  present it accurately and attractively, may be sure that his work will  receive the fullest consideration in almost every newspaper and magazine  office in the country, and will be accepted whenever it is found to  merit publication.    WOMEN AS FEATURE WRITERS. Since the essential qualifications just  enumerated are not limited to men, women are quite as well fitted to  write special feature and magazine articles as are their brothers in the  craft. In fact, woman's quicker sympathies and readier emotional  response to many phases of life give her a distinct advantage. Her  insight into the lives of others, and her intuitive understanding of  them, especially fit her to write good \"human interest\" articles. Both  the delicacy of touch and the chatty, personal tone that characterize  the work of many young women, are well suited to numerous topics.    In some fields, such as cooking, sewing, teaching, the care of children,  and household management, woman's greater knowledge and understanding of  conditions furnish her with topics that are vital to other women and  often not uninteresting to men. The entry of women into occupations  hitherto open only to men is bringing new experiences to many women, and  is furnishing women writers with additional fields from which to draw  subjects and material. Ever since the beginning of popular magazines and  of special feature writing for newspapers, women writers have proved  their ability, but at no time have the opportunities for them been  greater than at present.          CHAPTER II    PREPARATION FOR SPECIAL FEATURE WRITING      QUALIFICATIONS FOR FEATURE WRITING. To attain success as a writer of  special feature articles a person must possess at least four  qualifications: (1) ability to find subjects that will interest the  average man and woman, and to see the picturesque, romantic, and  significant phases of these subjects; (2) a sympathetic understanding of  the lives and interests of the persons about whom and for whom he  writes; (3) thoroughness and accuracy in gathering material; (4) skill  to portray and to explain clearly, accurately, and attractively.    The much vaunted sense of news values commonly called a \"nose for news,\"  whether innate or acquired, is a prime requisite. Like the newspaper  reporter, the writer of special articles must be able to recognize what  at a given moment will interest the average reader. Like the reporter,  also, he must know how much it will interest him. An alert, responsive  attitude of mind toward everything that is going on in the world, and  especially in that part of the world immediately around him, will reveal  a host of subjects. By reading newspapers, magazines, and books, as well  as by intercourse with persons of various classes, a writer keeps in  contact with what people are thinking and talking about, in the world at  large and in his own community. In this way he finds subjects and also  learns how to connect his subjects with events and movements of interest  the country over.    Not only should he be quick to recognize a good subject; he must be able  to see the attractive and significant aspects of it. He must understand  which of its phases touch most closely the life and the interests of the  average person for whom he is writing. He must look at things from \"the  other fellow's\" point of view. A sympathetic insight into the lives of  his readers is necessary for every writer who hopes to quicken his  subject with vital interest.    The alert mental attitude that constantly focuses the writer's attention  on the men and women around him has been called \"human curiosity,\" which  Arnold Bennett says \"counts among the highest social virtues (as  indifference counts among the basest defects), because it leads to the  disclosure of the causes of character and temperament and thereby to a  better understanding of the springs of human conduct.\" The importance of  curiosity and of a keen sense of wonder has been emphasized as follows  by Mr. John M. Siddall, editor of the _American Magazine_, who directed  his advice to college students interested in the opportunities afforded  by writing as a profession:        A journalist or writer must have consuming curiosity about other      human beings--the most intense interest in their doings and motives      and thoughts. It comes pretty near being the truth to say that a      great journalist is a super-gossip--not about trivial things but      about important things. Unless a man has a ceaseless desire to learn      what is going on in the heads of others, he won't be much of a      journalist--for how can you write about others unless you know about      others?        In journalism men are needed who have a natural sense of wonder....      You must wonder at man's achievements, at man's stupidity, at his      honesty, crookedness, courage, cowardice--at everything that is      remarkable about him wherever and whenever it appears. If you      haven't this sense of wonder, you will never write a novel or become      a great reporter, because you simply won't see anything to write      about. Men will be doing amazing things under your very eyes--and      you won't even know it.    Ability to investigate a subject thoroughly, and to gather material  accurately, is absolutely necessary for any writer who aims to do  acceptable work. Careless, inaccurate writers are the bane of the  magazine editor's life. Whenever mistakes appear in an article, readers  are sure to write to the editor calling his attention to them. Moreover,  the discovery of incorrect statements impairs the confidence of readers  in the magazine. If there is reason to doubt the correctness of any data  in an article, the editor takes pains to check over the facts carefully  before publication. He is not inclined to accept work a second time from  a writer who has once proved unreliable.    To interpret correctly the essential significance of data is as  important as to record them accurately. Readers want to know the meaning  of facts and figures, and it is the writer's mission to bring out this  meaning. A sympathetic understanding of the persons who figure in his  article is essential, not only to portray them accurately, but to give  his story the necessary \"human interest.\" To observe accurately, to feel  keenly, and to interpret sympathetically and correctly whatever he  undertakes to write about, should be a writer's constant aim.    Ability to write well enough to make the average person see as clearly,  feel as keenly, and understand as well as he does himself the persons  and things that he is portraying and explaining, is obviously the _sine  qua non_ of success. Ease, fluency, and originality of diction, either  natural or acquired, the writer must possess if his work is to have  distinction.    TRAINING FOR FEATURE WRITING. The ideal preparation for a writer of  special articles would include a four-year college course, at least a  year's work as a newspaper reporter, and practical experience in some  other occupation or profession in which the writer intends to specialize  in his writing. Although not all persons who desire to do special  feature work will be able to prepare themselves in this way, most of  them can obtain some part of this preliminary training.    A college course, although not absolutely essential for success, is  generally recognized to be of great value as a preparation for writing.  College training aims to develop the student's ability to observe  accurately, to think logically, and to express his ideas clearly and  effectively--all of which is vital to good special feature writing. In  addition, such a course gives a student a knowledge of many subjects  that he will find useful for his articles. A liberal education furnishes  a background that is invaluable for all kinds of literary work.  Universities also offer excellent opportunities for specialization.

She had chopped the verdant masses off without a thought, and had ever  after refused to allow it to grow to hairpin length, and to her father  only had granted the privilege of calling her by the pet name of  Golliwog.    \"Would you like to travel a bit, pet?\"  And the man smiled, though his  heart was heavy at the thought of the blank which his Golliwog's  departure would leave in the home and the daily round.    \"Travel!  Travel!  Oh! darling--to Egypt?    \"Why Egypt?  Why not France or--or Italy?\"    \"Because I've _got_ to go to Egypt sometime or another, Dads.  I've got  to see the desert and the mosques and the whites and blues and oranges  and camels.  It's _in_ me _here_,\" and she thumped her nightgown above  her heart.  \"I shall never be happy until I have seen them all.  Oh!  Dads, I wonder if you can understand; it--it sounds so--so silly------\"    \"Tell me,\" and the man moved over to the head of the bed and took his  daughter gently in his arms.    \"I'm so out of the picture, somehow, here, dearest,\" said the child,  striving as best she could to describe what was really only the passing  of the border-line between girl and womanhood.  \"This terrible  colouring of mine, for one thing.  Why, amongst other girls, I am like  a Raemaeker stuffed into a Heath Robinson folio, like a palette daubed  with oils hung amongst a lot of water-colours.  I want to find my own  nail and hang for one hour by myself, if it's on a barn-door or the  wall of a mosque--as long as I am by myself.\"    \"Good Lord!\" said the man inwardly, as he patted his daughter's arm;  then, aloud.  \"As it happens, Golliwog darling, I had a letter from  _Marraine_ yesterday, asking me to let you go out to her in Cairo for  the winter and see as much as possible of the ordinary sights.  We'll  talk it over with Mother to-morrow.\"    \"Oh, Dads--how wonderful!  And can't you and Mother come?  And oh!  _can_ I take Wellington?\"    \"I think so, dear, if he hasn't hydrophobia,\" and the man bent to pat  the head of the great dog which had crept from under the bed at the  sound of his name.    And later Dads stood at his window, smoking two last pipes, whilst a  glimpse into the future was allowed him.    \"Can it be--can it possibly be,\" he said, puffing clouds of smoke into  the creeper, to the annoyance of many insects, \"Big Ben Kelham?--and  the estates run alongside.  Wonder if Teresa has noticed anything.  And--by Jove!--of course!--he's at Heliopolis, getting over his hunting  accident.  I wonder------\"    And Damaris sat at her window, with her arms round the dog, who longed  inordinately for his mat.    \"The desert,\" she whispered.  \"The pyramids--the  bazaar--life--adventure.  How _wonderful_!\"  There came a long, long  pause, and then she added, as she turned towards a coloured picture of  the Sphinx upon the wall, \"And who cares if the nail is a tin-tack or a  screw?\"    As it happened, it was destined to be the jewel-hilted, double-edged,  unsheathed dagger of love.    And Fate, having mislaid her glasses, worked her shuttle at hazard in  and out of that picture of intricate pattern called Life, and having  tangled and knotted together the crimson thread of passion, the golden  thread of youth and the honest brown of a deep, undemonstrative love,  she left the disentanglement of the muddle in the hands of Olivia,  Duchess of Longacres.    Her Grace was over eighty.    Of a line of yeomen ancestors ranging back down the centuries to the  William Carew who had fought for Harold, she had been, about sixty-five  years ago, the belle of Devon.  Against the warnings of her heart and  to the delight of her friends and family, she had married the Duke of  Longacres, whose roving eye had been arrested by her beauty at a meet  of the Devon and Somerset, and his equally roving heart temporarily  captured by the indifference of her demeanour towards his autocratic  self.    She had lost him, to all intents and purposes, two years after the  marriage, but blinding her eyes and stuffing her ears, had held high  her beautiful head and high her honour, filling her empty heart with  the love of her son and the esteem of her legion of real friends;  showing the bravest of beautiful faces to the world, until a happy  widowhood had set her free.    Some years of absolute happiness of the simplest kind had followed; the  marriage of her son and birth of her grandson, who had cost his mother  her life.  Then the following year had come the Boer War, and the  heroic tragedy of Spion Kop, which left her childless; after that, many  years of utter devotion, to her grandson, who adored her; then the  Great War and the Battle of the Falkland Islands, which left her  absolutely bereft, with the care of the boy's greatest treasure, even  the grey parrot, Quarter-Deck, Dekko for short.    Methuselah of birds, it was possessed of an uncanny gift of human  speech and understanding, and had been promoted through generation to  generation, from sailing-vessel _via_ Merchant Service to British Navy.    As time and tragedy worked hard together to silver her hair and line  her face, so did a veritable imp of mischief, bred of her desolation,  seem to possess the old darling.  She cared not a brass farthing for  the opinion of her neighbours, so that after the death of the great  Queen, who had been her staunchest friend, she had instructed Maria  Hobson, her maid and also staunchest friend, to revive the faded roses  of her cheeks with the aid of cosmetics.  Things had gone from bad to  worse in that respect, until her pretty snow-white hair had been  covered by a flagrant golden perruque and the dear old face with a mask  of pink and white enamel.  Her eyes were blue, and keen as a hawk's,  undimmed by the tears shed in secret during her tumultuous and tragic  life; her teeth, each one in a perfect and pearly state of  preservation, were her own, for which asset she was never given the  benefit of the doubt; her tongue was vitriolic; her heart of pure gold,  and she owned a right hand which said nothing to the left of the spaces  between its fingers through which, daily ran deeds of kindness and  streams of love towards the unfortunate ones of the earth.    Her dress was invariably of grey taffeta or brocade, bunched at the  back and trailing on the ground; there were ruffles, of priceless lace  at the elbow-sleeves and V-shaped neck; a plain straw poke-bonnet  served for all outdoor functions, and an ebony stick, called \"the wand\"  by the denizens of the slums, who adored her, completed her picturesque  toilette.    The majority feared this _grande dame_, a minority, if they had had the  chance, would have fawned upon her in public and laughed at or  caricatured her in private; those who really knew her, and they lived  principally east of London town, would willingly have laid themselves  down and allowed her ridiculously small feet, invariably shod in  crimson, buckled, outrageously high-heeled shoes, to trample upon their  prostrate bodies, if it would have given her pleasure so to do.    She adored young things, and had an enormous family of godsons and  goddaughters, out of which crowd Ben Kelham and Damaris Hethencourt  were supreme favourites, and about whom she had been weaving plots when  she had written her letter of invitation to the Squire.    She smoked Three Castles, which she kept in a jewelled Louis XV  snuff-box, and had a perfect tartar of a maid, who simply worshipped  her.    Of a truth, a long description of a very old and very wise old woman,  of whom the great Queen had once remarked to her Consort:    \"I wish I were not a queen, so that _I_ might curtsey to Olivia.\"    And in this wise old woman's jewel-covered hands Fate placed the  twisted threads of passion, youth and love, and a wiser selection she  could not have made.    A bronchitic cough had taken her to Cairo just as a sooted-up lung,  left behind by the pneumonia which had followed the hunting accident  had taken Ben Kelham to Heliopolis, and for recuperation of body or  mind there is nothing to equal an Egyptian winter, even in a  tourist-ridden centre.    Ben Kelham, Big Ben for short, on account of his six-feet-two, was heir  to Sir Andrew Kelham, Bart., whose estate joined the lands of Squire  Hethencourt, whom he looked upon as his greatest friend, and vice  versa.  Educated at Harrow, Ben Kelham and Hugh Carden Ali had been  known on the Hill as David and Jonathan; so that the crimson, golden  and brown threads were more than uncommonly twisted.    Ben was heavy in build and slow in every way, but he was still more  sure than slow, and had never been known to give up when once he had  set his mind to the accomplishment of a task, and although he had stood  in absolute awe of beautiful Damaris since the day she had lengthened  her skirts, yet had he determined to make her his wife, even if it  meant following in Jacob's footsteps to the tune of waiting many years.    He had confided his determination to his godmother, who had immediately  taken the case in hand, and proceeded to throw bucketsful of cold water  upon his suggestion of being on the quay or doorstep to welcome the  girl to Egypt.    \"My dear man,\" replied the tactful old lady as she rasped a match on  the sole of a crimson shoe and lit a fragrant Three Castles, \"do  remember that everything will be new to the child; she will be one vast  ejaculation for at least a month.  Let her get over that, let her  realise that you are close at hand, but "]]]
