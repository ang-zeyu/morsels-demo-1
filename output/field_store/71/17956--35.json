These doors are always open, and a cool smell of  damp straw flavored with vinegar greets you from a leaky keg as you  descend into its recesses. On the hard earthen floor rest eight or ten  great casks. The walls are lined with bottles large and small, loaded on  shelves to which little white cards are tacked giving the vintage and  brand. In one corner, under the small window, you will find dozens of  boxes of French delicacies--truffles, pease, mushrooms, pate de foie  gras, mustard, and the like, and behind them rows of olive oil and  olives. I carefully draw out a bottle from the row on the last shelf  nearest the corner, mount the steps, and place it on the table. Madame  examines the cork, and puts down the bottle, remarking sententiously:--    \"Chateau Lamonte, '62! Monsieur has told you.\"    There may be ways of dining more delicious than out in the open air  under the vines in the cool of the afternoon, with Lucette, in her  whitest of aprons, flitting about, and madame garnishing the dishes each  in turn, and there may be better bottles of honest red wine to be found  up and down this world of care than \"Chateau Lamonte, '62,\" but I have  not yet discovered them.    Lucette serves the coffee in a little cup, and leaves the Roquefort and  the cigarettes on the table just as the sun is sinking behind the hill  skirting the railroad. While I am blowing rings through the grape leaves  over my head a quick noise is heard across the stream. Lucette runs past  me through the garden, picking up her oars as she goes.    \"_Oui, mon pere._ I am coming.\"    It is monsieur from his day's work in the city.    \"Who is here?\" I hear him say as he mounts the terrace steps. \"Oh, the  painter--good!\"    \"Ah, _mon ami_. So you must see the willows once more. Have you not  tired of them yet?\" Then, seating himself, \"I hope madame has taken good  care of you. What, the '62? Ah, I remember I told you.\"    When it is quite dark he joins me under the leaves, bringing a second  bottle a little better corked he thinks, and the talk drifts into his  early life.    \"What year was that, monsieur?\" I asked.    \"In 1849. I was a young fellow just grown. I had learned my trade in  Rheims, and I had come down to Paris to make my bread. Two years later  came the little affair of December 2. That 'nobody,' Louis, had  dissolved the National Assembly and the Council of State, and had issued  his address to the army. Paris was in a ferment. By the help of his  soldiers and police he had silenced every voice in Paris except his own.  He had suppressed all the journals, and locked up everybody who had  opposed him. Victor Hugo was in exile, Louis Blanc in London,  Changarnier and Cavaignac in prison. At the moment I was working in a  little shop near the Porte St. Martin decorating lacquerwork. We workmen  all belonged to a secret society which met nightly in a back room over a  wine-shop near the Rue Royale. We had but one thought--how to upset the  little devil at the Elysee. Among my comrades was a big fellow from my  own city, one Cambier. He was the leader. On the ground floor of the  shop was built a huge oven where the lacquer was baked. At night this  was made hot with charcoal and allowed to cool off in the morning ready  for the finished work of the previous day. It was Cambier's duty to  attend to this oven.    \"One night just after all but he and two others had left the shop a  strange man was discovered in a closet where the men kept their working  clothes. He was seized, brought to the light, and instantly recognized  as a member of the secret police.    \"At daylight the next morning I was aroused from my bed, and, looking  up, saw Chapot, an inspector of police, standing over me. He had known  me from a boy, and was a friend of my father's.    \"'Francois, there is trouble at the shop. A police agent has been  murdered. His body was found in the oven. Cambier is under arrest. I  know what you have been doing, but I also know that in this you have had  no hand. Here are one hundred francs. Leave Paris in an hour.'    \"I put the money in my pocket, tied my clothes in a bundle, and that  night was on my way to Havre, and the next week set sail for here.\"    \"And what became of Cambier?\" I asked.    \"I have never heard from that day to this, so I think they must have  snuffed him out.\"    Then he drifted into his early life here--the weary tramping of the  streets day after day, the half-starving result, the language and people  unknown. Suddenly, somewhere in the lower part of the city, he espied a  card tacked outside of a window bearing this inscription, \"Decorator  wanted.\" A man inside was painting one of the old-fashioned iron  tea-trays common in those days. Monsieur took off his hat, pointed to  the card, then to himself, seized the brush, and before the man could  protest had covered the bottom with morning-glories so pink and fresh  that his troubles ended on the spot. The first week he earned six  dollars; but then this was to be paid at the end of it. For these six  days he subsisted on one meal a day. This he ate at a restaurant where  at night he washed dishes and blacked the head waiter's boots. When  Saturday came, and the money was counted out in his hand, he thrust it  into his pocket, left the shop, and sat down on a doorstep outside to  think.    \"And, _mon ami_, what did I do first?\"    \"Got something to eat?\"    \"Never. I paid for a bath, had my hair cut and my face shaved, bought a  shirt and collar, and then went back to the restaurant where I had  washed dishes the night before, and the head waiter _served me_. After  that it was easy; the next week it was ten dollars; then in a few years  I had a place of my own; then came madame and Lucette--and here we are.\"    The twilight had faded into a velvet blue, sprinkled with stars. The  lantern which madame had hung against the arbor shed a yellow light,  throwing into clear relief the sharply cut features of monsieur. Up and  down the silent stream drifted here and there a phantom boat, the gleam  of its light following like a firefly. From some came no sound but the  muffled plash of the oars. From others floated stray bits of song and  laughter. Far up the stream I heard the distant whistle of the down  train.    \"It is mine, monsieur. Will you cross with me, and bring back the boat?\"    Monsieur unhooked the lantern, and I followed through the garden and  down the terrace steps.    At the water's edge was a bench holding two figures.    Monsieur turned his lantern, and the light fell upon the face of young  Francois.    When the bow grated on the opposite bank I shook his hand, and said, in  parting, pointing to the lovers,--    \"The same old story, Monsieur?\"    \"Yes; and always new.

SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY    What does the title suggest to you? At what point do you change your  idea as to the location of Laguerre's? Do you know of any picturesque  places that are somewhat like the one described here? Could you  describe one of them for the class? Why do people usually not appreciate  the scenery near at hand? What do you think of the plan of \"seeing  America first\"? What is meant here by \"my traps\"? Why is it better to  wait for Madame? Why does Madame talk so crossly? What sort of person is  she? See if you can tell accurately, from what follows in later pages,  why Monsieur left Paris so hastily. How does the author give you an idea  of Francois Laguerre's appearance? Why does the author stop to give us  the two paragraphs beginning, \"There is a quality,\" and \"Then came a  long interval\"? How does he get back to his subject? Why does he not let  Lucette bail the boat? Who does bail it at last? Why?

Then we are told \"Moses  did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had done it as the Lord  had commanded.\" Then Moses blessed them.    [Illustration: BEZALEEL AND AHOLIAB.]          THE BRAZEN SERPENT.      Jesus Christ says that \"As Moses lifted up the serpent in the  wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up.\" What did Jesus  mean?    Nearly forty years had passed since God gave His law from Mount Sinai;  and frequently the people had sinned during that time. Through their  disobedience they were compelled to wander in the wilderness for many  long years, instead of going straight to Canaan. While thus wandering  they passed round the land of Edom, and became grieved and impatient  because of the dreariness and difficulty of the way. They murmured  against God and against Moses, and said, \"Wherefore have ye brought us  up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no bread,  neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.\"  They meant the manna which God gave them daily.    God allowed fiery serpents to come among the people because of their  sin, which bit them, and many died. Then they came to Moses, saying,  \"We have sinned ... pray unto the Lord that He take away the serpents  from us.\" Moses did so; and God told him to make a serpent of brass  and to put it on a pole; and said that all who looked to the serpent  should live. The serpent of brass could not heal them, but God healed  them as they obeyed his command to look to the serpent. It was _look_  and _live_.    Now I think we see what Jesus means. God has said that all must die  because of sin; but those who look to Jesus and trust in Him will have  their sins pardoned, and will live with Him in glory forever.    [Illustration: THE BRAZEN SERPENT.]          THE PASSAGE OF THE JORDAN.      Having wandered for forty years in the wilderness, the Israelites drew  near to the river Jordan, at a place opposite Jericho. Moses was dead,  and Joshua was now the leader of the host. God told him that the time  had come when the people of Israel were to enter Canaan; to which land  they had all this long time been travelling, but which previously they  had not been permitted to enter on account of their sin. A description  of this sin is given in the Bible, in the fourteenth chapter of  Numbers.    But the people were now to cross the Jordan and enter Canaan. They  were a very great multitude, and the river lay before them. How were  they to cross? God told them! He commanded Joshua that the priests  were to take the ark of the covenant and to go before the people; who  were to follow a short distance behind. Could the priests and the  people walk across the deep water? No. But as soon as the priests  reached the river, and their feet were dipped in the water, God  divided the Jordan into two, leaving dry ground for the Israelites to  cross upon.    The priests carried the ark into the middle of the bed of the river  and then stood still, and all the people passed on before them. When  all were over, the priests carrying the ark moved forward also, and  the waters returned to their proper place again. But before they did  so, Joshua commanded twelve men, one from each tribe, each to take a  stone from the river's bed; and these stones were set up as a memorial  of the marvellous manner in which God had brought the Israelites  across the Jordan into Canaan.    [Illustration: CROSSING THE JORDAN.]          THE CAPTAIN OF THE LORD'S HOST.      News of the miraculous way in which the Israelites had been brought  across the Jordan spread rapidly among the Canaanites, and when they  heard what God had done, they were very much afraid. We are told that  \"their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more,  because of the children of Israel.\"    God had said to Joshua that the land of Canaan was to be taken  possession of by the Israelites; and had commanded him to \"Be strong  and of a good courage,\" and had strengthened him by saying, \"Be not  afraid, neither be thou dismayed, for the Lord thy God is with thee  whithersoever thou goest.\" Joshua and the people were now in Canaan,  and before them lay a stronghold of the Canaanites, named Jericho,  having high walls and strong gates. This city the Israelites had to  capture; but the inhabitants closed the gates, and prepared to fight  fiercely to prevent Joshua and his warriors from getting in.    As Joshua was alone at this time, near Jericho, he looked up, and saw  a man standing with a drawn sword in his hand. Joshua went to him and  asked, \"Art thou for us or for our adversaries?\" The man answered,  \"Nay; but as captain of the host of the Lord am I come.\" Do you know  who it was? Was it an angel? I think it was more than an angel. It was  the Lord! Joshua fell on his face to the earth and worshipped, saying,  \"What saith my Lord unto His servant?\" Then the Lord told Joshua, as  before he had told Moses, to take his shoes from his feet, for the  place on which he stood was holy; and instructed him how Jericho was  to be captured.    [Illustration: THE CAPTAIN OF THE LORD'S HOST.]          HOW JERICHO WAS CAPTURED.      When men in olden times attacked a city, they tried to batter down the  walls with heavy beams of wood, having heads of iron, called battering  rams; but God did not instruct the Israelites thus to capture Jericho.  They were to remember that it was not by their own power they could  conquer the Canaanites, but only as God gave them the victory over  their enemies. So God commanded Joshua to lay siege to Jericho in a  very strange way. He said that seven priests, each having a trumpet,  were to go before the ark. In front of them the armed men of Israel  were to march; and behind the ark the people were to follow. In this  way they were to go round the city once each day for six days, the  priests blowing their trumpets each time. The seventh day they were to  go in the same manner round the city seven times; and God said that  when the priests blew their trumpets the seventh time, the people were  to give a great shout, and the walls of the city would fall down.    Joshua and the people did as God commanded. They marched round the  city carrying the ark, the priests blowing their trumpets; and on the  seventh day they marched round seven times. The last time, when the  priests blew their trumpets, the people shouted with a great shout,  and the walls of the city fell down flat. Then the Israelites went up  and took possession of it.    Thus God delivered Jericho into the hands of His people. All the  inhabitants were killed except Rahab and her relatives. These were  spared because Rahab had been kind to the spies whom Joshua had sent.    [Illustration: THE FALL OF JERICHO.]          ACHAN'S SIN.      God commanded the Israelites to destroy Jericho; and all the gold,  silver, and other riches found there were to be devoted to the Lord.  If any disobeyed this command then a curse was to rest upon all, and  they were not to prosper.    The Israelites were to conquer the Canaanites, and drive them out of  the land. So Joshua prepared to attack a city named Ai. Three thousand  of his men went to capture it, but the inhabitants came out and drove  them back, killing some of them. Joshua was greatly grieved. He knew  that unless God made the Israelites victorious, the Canaanites would  be able to overcome them, and God had appeared to fail them this time.  Oh! he was sorry. But he told God the trouble, and God showed him the  cause of it.    One of the Israelites, named Achan, saw among the spoil of Jericho, a  handsome garment, some silver, and a bar of gold, and coveted them. He  stole these things and hid them away in his tent, thinking that no one  saw him; but God knew it all. Achan's sin was the cause of Israel's  defeat! God showed Joshua how the man who had done the wickedness was  to be discovered. Each tribe was to be brought before God, then each  family of the tribe He chose, then each household of the family taken,  and lastly each man of the family chosen. Finally, Achan was pointed  out by God. Joshua bade him confess what he had done, and he said that  he had taken the Babylonish garment and the gold and silver.    Messengers were sent to his tent, who brought what Achan had hidden;  and he, with his sons and daughters, his cattle, and all that he had,  and the garment, silver, and gold, were taken to a valley near by,  where the people stoned them, and burned them with fire; and then  raised over all a great heap of stones, which remained as a memorial  to warn others against sinning as Achan had done.    [Illustration: ACHAN CONFESSING HIS SIN.]           *       *       *       *       *          THE ALTAR ON MOUNT EBAL.      Before Moses died he called the Israelites together, and urged them to  faithfully serve God; also directing that when they entered Canaan,  they were to build an altar of rough stones, covered with plaster, on  Mount Ebal, and to write the words of God's law upon this altar. Then  six of the tribes were to stand on Mount Gerizim, and six on Mount  Ebal, and, in the hearing of all the people, the blessings for  obedience and the cursings for disobedience were to be proclaimed.    Mounts Ebal and Gerizim are two rugged mountains that face each other  in Samaria. When the Israelites advanced thus far, they remembered the  words of Moses. Joshua built the altar as directed, on which he  offered sacrifices to God, and wrote a copy of the law upon it. All  Israel stood, \"half of them over against Mount Gerizim, and half of  them over against Mount Ebal,\" and Joshua read all the words of the  law, \"the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in  the book of the law.\" Then the loud voices of the Levites were heard  from the mountain sides,"]]]
