In this  way they hoped soon to monopolize the trade with all the tribes on  the southern and western waters, and of those vast tracts comprised in  ancient Louisiana.    The government of the United States began to view with a wary eye the  growing influence thus acquired by combinations of foreigners, over  the aboriginal tribes inhabiting its territories, and endeavored to  counteract it. For this purpose, as early as 1796, the government sent  out agents to establish rival trading houses on the frontier, so as to  supply the wants of the Indians, to link their interests and feelings  with those of the people of the United States, and to divert this  important branch of trade into national channels.    The expedition, however, was unsuccessful, as most commercial expedients  are prone to be, where the dull patronage of government is counted  upon to outvie the keen activity of private enterprise. What government  failed to effect, however, with all its patronage and all its agents,  was at length brought about by the enterprise and perseverance of a  single merchant, one of its adopted citizens; and this brings us to  speak of the individual whose enterprise is the especial subject of  the following pages; a man whose name and character are worthy of being  enrolled in the history of commerce, as illustrating its noblest aims  and soundest maxims. A few brief anecdotes of his early life, and of the  circumstances which first determined him to the branch of commerce of  which we are treating, cannot be but interesting.    John Jacob Astor, the individual in question, was born in the honest  little German village of Waldorf, near Heidelberg, on the banks of the  Rhine. He was brought up in the simplicity of rural life, but, while  yet a mere stripling, left his home, and launched himself amid the  busy scenes of London, having had, from his very boyhood, a singular  presentiment that he would ultimately arrive at great fortune.    At the close of the American Revolution he was still in London, and  scarce on the threshold of active life. An elder brother had been for  some few years resident in the United States, and Mr. Astor determined  to follow him, and to seek his fortunes in the rising country. Investing  a small sum which he had amassed since leaving his native village, in  merchandise suited to the American market, he embarked, in the month  of November, 1783, in a ship bound to Baltimore, and arrived in Hampton  Roads in the month of January. The winter was extremely severe, and the  ship, with many others, was detained by the ice in and about Chesapeake  Bay for nearly three months.    During this period, the passengers of the various ships used  occasionally to go on shore, and mingle sociably together. In this  way Mr. Astor became acquainted with a countryman of his, a furrier by  trade. Having had a previous impression that this might be a lucrative  trade in the New World, he made many inquiries of his new acquaintance  on the subject, who cheerfully gave him all the information in his power  as to the quality and value of different furs, and the mode of carrying  on the traffic. He subsequently accompanied him to New York, and, by his  advice, Mr. Astor was induced to invest the proceeds of his merchandise  in furs. With these he sailed from New York to London in 1784, disposed  of them advantageously, made himself further acquainted with the course  of the trade, and returned the same year to New York, with a view to  settle in the United States.    He now devoted himself to the branch of commerce with which he had thus  casually been made acquainted. He began his career, of course, on the  narrowest scale; but he brought to the task a persevering industry,  rigid economy, and strict integrity. To these were added an aspiring  spirit that always looked upwards; a genius bold, fertile, and  expansive; a sagacity quick to grasp and convert every circumstance to  its advantage, and a singular and never wavering confidence of signal  success.    As yet, trade in peltries was not organized in the United States, and  could not be said to form a regular line of business. Furs and skins  were casually collected by the country traders in their dealings with  the Indians or the white hunters, but the main supply was derived  from Canada. As Mr. Astor's means increased, he made annual visits to  Montreal, where he purchased furs from the houses at that place engaged  in the trade. These he shipped from Canada to London, no direct trade  being allowed from that colony to any but the mother country.    In 1794 or '95, a treaty with Great Britain removed the restrictions  imposed upon the trade with the colonies, and opened a direct commercial  intercourse between Canada and the United States. Mr. Astor was in  London at the time, and immediately made a contract with the agents of  the Northwest Company for furs. He was now enabled to import them from  Montreal into the United States for the home supply, and to be shipped  thence to different parts of Europe, as well as to China, which has ever  been the best market for the richest and finest kinds of peltry.    The treaty in question provided, likewise, that the military posts  occupied by the British within the territorial limits of the United  States, should be surrendered. Accordingly, Oswego, Niagara, Detroit,  Michilimackinac, and other posts on the American side of the lakes, were  given up. An opening was thus made for the American merchant to trade on  the confines of Canada, and within the territories of the United States.  After an interval of some years, about 1807, Mr. Astor embarked in this  trade on his own account. His capital and resources had by this time  greatly augmented, and he had risen from small beginnings to take his  place among the first merchants and financiers of the country. His  genius had ever been in advance of his circumstances, prompting him  to new and wide fields of enterprise beyond the scope of ordinary  merchants. With all his enterprise and resources however, he soon found  the power and influence of the Michilimackinac (or Mackinaw) Company too  great for him, having engrossed most of the trade within the American  borders.    A plan had to be devised to enable him to enter into successful  competition. He was aware of the wish of the American government,  already stated, that the fur trade within its boundaries should be in  the hands of American citizens, and of the ineffectual measures it had  taken to accomplish that object. He now offered, if aided and protected  by government, to turn the whole of that trade into American channels.  He was invited to unfold his plans to government, and they were warmly  approved, though the executive could give no direct aid.    Thus countenanced, however, he obtained, in 1809, a charter from the  legislature of the State of New York, incorporating a company under the  name of \"The American Fur Company,\" with a capital of one million  of dollars, with the privilege of increasing it to two millions. The  capital was furnished by himself he, in fact, constituted the company;  for, though he had a board of directors, they were merely nominal; the  whole business was conducted on his plans and with his resources, but  he preferred to do so under the imposing and formidable aspect of a  corporation, rather than in his individual name, and his policy was  sagacious and effective.    As the Mackinaw Company still continued its rivalry, and as the fur  trade would not advantageously admit of competition, he made a new  arrangement in 1811, by which, in conjunction with certain partners of  the Northwest Company, and other persons engaged in the fur trade, he  bought out the Mackinaw Company, and merged that and the American Fur  Company into a new association, to be called the \"Southwest Company.\"  This he likewise did with the privity and approbation of the American  government.    By this arrangement Mr. Astor became proprietor of one half of the  Indian establishments and goods which the Mackinaw Company had within  the territory of the Indian country in the United States, and it was  understood that the whole was to be surrendered into his hands at the  expiration of five years, on condition that the American Company would  not trade within the British dominions.    Unluckily, the war which broke out in 1812 between Great Britain and  the United States suspended the association; and, after the war, it was  entirely dissolved; Congress having passed a law prohibiting the British  fur traders from prosecuting their enterprises within the territories of  the United States.

WHILE the various companies we have noticed were pushing their  enterprises far and wide in the wilds of Canada, and along the course of  the great western waters, other adventurers, intent on the same objects,  were traversing the watery wastes of the Pacific and skirting the  northwest coast of America. The last voyage of that renowned but  unfortunate discoverer, Captain Cook, had made known the vast quantities  of the sea-otter to be found along that coast, and the immense prices to  be obtained for its fur in China. It was as if a new gold coast had  been discovered. Individuals from various countries dashed into this  lucrative traffic, so that in the year 1792, there were twenty-one  vessels under different flags, plying along the coast and trading with  the natives. The greater part of them were American, and owned "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13711"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science - Volume 1, No. (#4)"],[1,"party have since called \"the great minister of  progress,\" and whom their opponents have not scrupled to designate  by appellations not to be repeated in these hours of sorrow and  bereavement. On the 17th of January, 1822, Mr. Peel was installed at  the head of the home department, where he remained undisturbed till  the political demise of Lord Liverpool in the spring of 1827. The most  distinguished man that has filled the chair of the House of Commons  in the present century was Charles Abbott, afterward Lord Colchester.  In the summer of 1817 he had completed sixteen years of hard service  in that eminent office, and he had represented the University for  eleven years. His valuable labors having been rewarded with a pension  and a peerage, he took his seat, full of years and honors, among  the hereditary legislators of the land, and left a vacancy in the  representation of his _alma mater_, which Mr. Peel above all living  men was deemed the most fitting person to occupy. At that time he was  an intense tory--or as the Irish called him, an Orange Protestant  of the deepest dye--one prepared to make any sacrifice for the  maintenance of church and state as established by the revolution of  1688. Who, therefore, so fit as he to represent the loyalty, learning,  and orthodoxy of Oxford? To have done so had been the object of Mr.  Canning's young ambition: but in 1817 he could not be so ungrateful to  Liverpool as to reject its representation even for the early object  of his parliamentary affections. Mr. Peel, therefore, was returned  without opposition, for that constituency which many consider the most  important in the land--with which he remained on the best possible  terms for twelve years. The question of the repeal of the penal  laws affecting the Roman Catholics, which severed so many political  connections, was, however, destined to separate Mr. Peel from Oxford.  In 1828 rumors of the coming change were rife, and many expedients  were devised to extract his opinions on the Catholic question. But  with the reserve which ever marked his character, left all curiosity  at fault. At last, the necessities of the government rendered further  concealment impossible, and out came the truth that he was no longer  an Orangeman. The ardent friends who had frequently supported  his Oxford elections, and the hot partisans who shouted \"Peel and  Protestantism,\" at the Brunswick Clubs, reviled him for his defection  in no measured terms. On the 4th of February, 1829, he addressed a  letter to the vice-chancellor of Oxford, stating, in many well-turned  phrases, that the Catholic question must forthwith be adjusted, under  advice in which he concurred; and that, therefore, he considered  himself bound to resign that trust which the University had during so  many years confided to his hands. His resignation was accepted; but as  the avowed purpose of that important step was to give his constituents  an opportunity of pronouncing an opinion upon a change of policy,  he merely accepted the Chiltern Hundreds with the intention of  immediately becoming a candidate for that seat in parliament which he  had just vacated. At this election Mr. Peel was opposed by Sir Robert  Inglis, who was elected by 755 to 609. Mr. Peel was, therefore,  obliged to cast himself on the favor of Sir Manasseh Lopez, who  returned him for Westbury, in Wiltshire, which constituency he  continued to represent two years, until at the general election in  1830 he was chosen for Tamworth, in the representation for which he  continued for twenty years.    The main features of his official life still remain to be noticed.  With the exception of Lord Palmerston, no statesman of modern times  has spent so many years in the civil service of the crown. If no  account be taken of the short time he was engaged upon the bullion  committee in effecting the change in the currency, and in opposing for  a few months the ministries of Mr. Canning and Lord Goderich, it may  be stated that from 1810 to 1830 he formed part of the government, and  presided over it as a first minister in 1834-5, as well as from 1841  to 1846 inclusive. During the time that he held the office of home  secretary under Lord Liverpool he effected many important changes  in the administration of domestic affairs, and many legislative  improvements of a practical and comprehensive character. But his fame  as member of parliament was principally sustained at this period of  his life by the extensive and admirable alterations which he effected  in the criminal law. Romilly and Mackintosh had preceded him in the  great work of reforming and humanizing the code of England. For his  hand, however, was reserved the introduction of ameliorations which  they had long toiled and struggled for in vain. The ministry through  whose influence he was enabled to carry these reforms lost its chief  in Lord Liverpool during the early part of the year 1827. When Mr.  Canning undertook to form a government, Mr. Peel, the late Lord Eldon,  the Duke of Wellington, and other eminent tories of that day, threw up  office, and are said to have persecuted Mr. Canning with a degree of  rancor far outstripping the legitimate bounds of political hostility.  Lord George Bentinck said \"they hounded to the death my illustrious  relative\"; and the ardor of his subsequent opposition to Sir Robert  Peel evidently derived its intensity from a long cherished sense of  the injuries supposed to have been inflicted upon Mr. Canning. It  is the opinion of men not ill informed respecting the sentiments of  Canning, that he considered Peel as his true political successor--as a  statesman competent to the task of working out that large and liberal  policy which he fondly hoped the tories might, however tardily,  be induced to sanction. At all events, he is believed not to have  entertained toward Mr. Peel any personal hostility, and to have stated  during his short-lived tenure of office that that gentleman was the  only member of his party who had not treated him with ingratitude and  unkindness.    In January, 1828, the Wellington ministry took office and held it till  November, 1830. Mr. Peel's reputation suffered during this period  very rude shocks. He gave up, as already stated, his anti-Catholic  principles, lost the force of twenty years' consistency, and under  unheard-of disadvantages introduced the very measure he had spent so  many years in opposing. The debates on Catholic emancipation, which  preceded the great reform question, constitute a period in his life,  which, twenty years ago, every one would have considered its chief  and prominent feature. There can be no doubt that the course he then  adopted demanded greater moral courage than at any previous period  of his life he had been called upon to exercise. He believed himself  incontestibly in the right; he believed, with the Duke of Wellington,  that the danger of civil war was imminent, and that such an event  was immeasurably a greater evil than surrendering the constitution  of 1688. But he was called upon to snap asunder a parliamentary  connection of twelve years with a great university, in which the most  interesting period of his youth had been passed; to encounter the  reproaches of adherents whom he had often led in well-fought contests  against the advocates of what was termed \"civil and religious  liberty;\" to tell the world that the character of public men for  consistency, however precious, is not to be directly opposed to  the common weal; and to communicate to many the novel as well as  unpalatable truth that what they deemed \"principle\" must give way to  what he called \"expediency.\"    When he ceased to be a minister of the crown, that general movement  throughout Europe which succeeded the deposition of the elder branch  of the Bourbons rendered parliamentary reform as unavoidable as two  years previously Catholic emancipation had been. He opposed this  change, no doubt with increased knowledge and matured talents, but  with impaired influence and few parliamentary followers. The history  of the reform debates will show that Sir Robert Peel made many  admirable speeches, which served to raise his reputation, but never  for a moment turned the tide of fortune against his adversaries, and  in the first session of the first reformed parliament he found himself  at the head of a party that in numbers little exceeded one hundred. As  soon as it was practicable he rallied his broken forces; either he or  some of his political friends gave them the name of \"Conservatives,\"  and it required but a short interval of reflection and observation  to prove to his sagacious intellect that the period of reaction was  at hand. Every engine of party organization was put into vigorous  activity, and before the summer of 1834 reached its close he was at  the head of a compact, powerful, and well-disciplined opposition. Such  a high impression of their vigor and efficiency had King William IV  received, that when, in November, Lord Althorp became a peer, and the  whigs therefore lost their leader to the House of Commons, his Majesty  sent in Italy to summon Sir Robert Peel to his councils, with a view  to the immediate formation of a conservative ministry. He accepted  this responsibility, though he thought the King had mistaken the  condition of the country and the chances of success which had awaited  his political friends. A new House of Commons was instantly called,  and for nearly three months Sir Robert Peel maintained a struggle  against the most formidable opposition that for nearly a century any  minister had been called to encounter. At no time did his command of  temper, his almost exhaustless resources of information, his vigorous  and comprehensive intellect appear to create such astonishment or draw  forth such unbounded admiration as in the early part of 1835. But,  after a well-fought contest he retired once more into the opposition  till the"]]]
