[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16287"],[0,"Talks To Teachers On Psychology; And To Students On Some Of Life's Ideals (#4)"],[1," avoid haziness of outline, has tried to make things appear more exact  and scientific by making the analysis more sharp.    The various fields of consciousness, according to this school, result  from a definite number of perfectly definite elementary mental states,  mechanically associated into a mosaic or chemically combined. According  to some thinkers,--Spencer, for example, or Taine,--these resolve  themselves at last into little elementary psychic particles or atoms of  'mind-stuff,' out of which all the more immediately known mental states  are said to be built up. Locke introduced this theory in a somewhat  vague form. Simple 'ideas' of sensation and reflection, as he called  them, were for him the bricks of which our mental architecture is built  up. If I ever have to refer to this theory again, I shall refer to it as  the theory of 'ideas.' But I shall try to steer clear of it altogether.  Whether it be true or false, it is at any rate only conjectural; and,  for your practical purposes as teachers, the more unpretending  conception of the stream of consciousness, with its total waves or  fields incessantly changing, will amply suffice.[A]         [A] In the light of some of the expectations that are abroad       concerning the 'new psychology,' it is instructive to read       the unusually candid confession of its founder Wundt, after       his thirty years of laboratory-experience:         \"The service which it [the experimental method] can yield       consists essentially in perfecting our inner observation, or       rather, as I believe, in making this really possible, in any       exact sense. Well, has our experimental self-observation, so       understood, already accomplished aught of importance? No       general answer to this question can be given, because in the       unfinished state of our science, there is, even inside of the       experimental lines of inquiry, no universally accepted body       of psychologic doctrine....         \"In such a discord of opinions (comprehensible enough at a       time of uncertain and groping development), the individual       inquirer can only tell for what views and insights he himself       has to thank the newer methods. And if I were asked in what       for me the worth of experimental observation in psychology       has consisted, and still consists, I should say that it has       given me an entirely new idea of the nature and connection of       our inner processes. I learned in the achievements of the       sense of sight to apprehend the fact of creative mental       synthesis.... From my inquiry into time-relations, etc.,... I       attained an insight into the close union of all those psychic       functions usually separated by artificial abstractions and       names, such as ideation, feeling, will; and I saw the       indivisibility and inner homogeneity, in all its phases, of       the mental life. The chronometric study of       association-processes finally showed me that the notion of       distinct mental 'images' [_reproducirten Vorstellungen_] was       one of those numerous self-deceptions which are no sooner       stamped in a verbal term than they forthwith thrust       non-existent fictions into the place of the reality. I       learned to understand an 'idea' as a process no less melting       and fleeting than an act of feeling or of will, and I       comprehended the older doctrine of association of 'ideas' to       be no longer tenable.... Besides all this, experimental       observation yielded much other information about the span of       consciousness, the rapidity of certain processes, the exact       numerical value of certain psychophysical data, and the like.       But I hold all these more special results to be relatively       insignificant by-products, and by no means the important       thing.\"--_Philosophische Studien_, x. 121-124. The whole       passage should be read. As I interpret it, it amounts to a       complete espousal of the vaguer conception of the stream of       thought, and a complete renunciation of the whole business,       still so industriously carried on in text-books, of chopping       up 'the mind' into distinct units of composition or function,       numbering these off, and labelling them by technical names.          III. THE CHILD AS A BEHAVING ORGANISM      I wish now to continue the description of the peculiarities of the  stream of consciousness by asking whether we can in any intelligible way  assign its _functions_.    It has two functions that are obvious: it leads to knowledge, and it  leads to action.    Can we say which of these functions is the more essential?    An old historic divergence of opinion comes in here. Popular belief has  always tended to estimate the worth of a man's mental processes by their  effects upon his practical life. But philosophers have usually cherished  a different view. \"Man's supreme glory,\" they have said, \"is to be a  _rational_ being, to know absolute and eternal and universal truth. The  uses of his intellect for practical affairs are therefore subordinate  matters. 'The theoretic life' is his soul's genuine concern.\" Nothing  can be more different in its results for our personal attitude than to  take sides with one or the other of these views, and emphasize the  practical or the theoretical ideal. In the latter case, abstraction from  the emotions and passions and withdrawal from the strife of human  affairs would be not only pardonable, but praiseworthy; and all that  makes for quiet and contemplation should be regarded as conducive to the  highest human perfection. In the former, the man of contemplation would  be treated as only half a human being, passion and practical resource  would become once more glories of our race, a concrete victory over this  earth's outward powers of darkness would appear an equivalent for any  amount of passive spiritual culture, and conduct would remain as the  test of every education worthy of the name.    It is impossible to disguise the fact that in the psychology of our own  day the emphasis is transferred from the mind's purely rational  function, where Plato and Aristotle, and what one may call the whole  classic tradition in philosophy had placed it, to the so long neglected  practical side. The theory of evolution is mainly responsible for this.  Man, we now have reason to believe, has been evolved from infra-human  ancestors, in whom pure reason hardly existed, if at all, and whose  mind, so far as it can have had any function, would appear to have been  an organ for adapting their movements to the impressions received from  the environment, so as to escape the better from destruction.  Consciousness would thus seem in the first instance to be nothing but a  sort of super-added biological perfection,--useless unless it prompted  to useful conduct, and inexplicable apart from that consideration.    Deep in our own nature the biological foundations of our consciousness  persist, undisguised and undiminished. Our sensations are here to  attract us or to deter us, our memories to warn or encourage us, our  feelings to impel, and our thoughts to restrain our behavior, so that on  the whole we may prosper and our days be long in the land. Whatever of  transmundane metaphysical insight or of practically inapplicable  aesthetic perception or ethical sentiment we may carry in our interiors  might at this rate be regarded as only part of the incidental excess of  function that necessarily accompanies the working of every complex  machine.    I shall ask you now--not meaning at all thereby to close the theoretic  question, but merely because it seems to me the point of view likely to  be of greatest practical use to you as teachers--to adopt with me, in  this course of lectures, the biological conception, as thus expressed,  and to lay your own emphasis on the fact that man, whatever else he may  be, is primarily a practical being, whose mind is given him to aid in  adapting him to this world's life.    In the learning of all matters, we have to start with some one deep  aspect of the question, abstracting it as if it were the only aspect;  and then we gradually correct ourselves by adding those neglected other  features which complete the case. No one believes more strongly than I  do that what our senses know as 'this world' is only one portion of our  mind's total environment and object. Yet, because it is the primal  portion, it is the _sine qua non_ of all the rest. If you grasp the facts  about it firmly, you may proceed to higher regions undisturbed. As our  time must be so short together, I prefer being elementary and  fundamental to being complete, so I propose to you to hold fast to the  ultra-simple point of view.    The reasons why I call it so fundamental can be easily told.    First, human and animal psychology thereby become less discontinuous. I  know that to some of you this will hardly seem an attractive reason,  but there are others whom it will affect.    Second, mental action is conditioned by brain action, and runs parallel  therewith. But the brain, so far as we understand it, is given us for  practical behavior. Every current that runs into it from skin or eye or  ear runs out again into muscles, glands, or viscera, and helps to adapt  the animal to the environment from which the current came. It therefore  generalizes and simplifies our view to treat the brain life and the  mental life as having one fundamental kind of purpose.    Third, those very functions of the mind that do not refer directly to  this world's environment, the ethical utopias, aesthetic visions,  insights into eternal truth, and fanciful logical combinations, could  never be carried on at all by a human individual, unless the mind that  produced them in him were also able to produce more practically useful  products. The latter are thus the more essential, or at least the more  primordial results.    Fourth, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16295"],[0,"The Vedanta-Sutras with the Commentary (#4)"],[1,"receive an intimation that  Drami/d/a/k/arya or Dravi/d/a/k/arya preceded /S/a@nkara in point of  time. In his /t/ika on /S/a@nkara's bhashya to the Chandogya Upanishad  III, 10, 4, Anandagiri remarks that the attempt made by his author to  reconcile the cosmological views of the Upanishad with the teaching of  Sm/ri/ti on the same point is a reproduction of the analogous attempt  made by the Dravi/d/a/k/arya.    It thus appears that that special interpretation of the Vedanta-sutras  with which the /S/ri-bhashya makes us acquainted is not due to  innovating views on the part of Ramanuja, but had authoritative  representatives already at a period anterior to that of /S/a@nkara. This  latter point, moreover, receives additional confirmation from the  relation in which the so-called Ramanuja sect stands to earlier sects.  What the exact position of Ramanuja was, and of what nature were the  reforms that rendered him so prominent as to give his name to a new  sect, is not exactly known at present; at the same time it is generally  acknowledged that the Ramanujas are closely connected with the so-called  Bhagavatas or Pa/nk/aratras, who are known to have existed already at a  very early time. This latter point is proved by evidence of various  kinds; for our present purpose it suffices to point to the fact that,  according to the interpretation of the most authoritative commentators,  the last Sutras of the second pada of the second adhyaya  (Vedanta-sutras) refer to a distinctive tenet of the Bhagavatas--which  tenet forms part of the Ramanuja system also--viz. that the highest  being manifests itself in a fourfold form (vyuha) as Vasudeva,  Sa@nkarsha/n/a, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, those four forms being identical  with the highest Self, the individual soul, the internal organ (manas),  and the principle of egoity (aha@nkara). Whether those Sutras embody an  approval of the tenet referred to, as Ramanuja maintains, or are meant  to impugn it, as /S/a@nkara thinks; so much is certain that in the  opinion of the best commentators the Bhagavatas, the direct forerunners  of the Ramanujas, are mentioned in the Sutras themselves, and hence must  not only have existed, but even reached a considerable degree of  importance at the time when the Sutras were composed. And considering  the general agreement of the systems of the earlier Bhagavatas and the  later Ramanujas, we have a full right to suppose that the two sects were  at one also in their mode of interpreting the Vedanta-sutras.    The preceding considerations suffice, I am inclined to think, to show  that it will by no means be wasted labour to enquire how Ramanuja  interprets the Sutras, and wherein he differs from /S/a@nkara. This in  fact seems clearly to be the first step we have to take, if we wish to  make an attempt at least of advancing beyond the interpretations of  scholiasts to the meaning of the Sutras themselves. A full and  exhaustive comparison of the views of the two commentators would indeed  far exceed the limits of the space which can here he devoted to that  task, and will, moreover, be made with greater ease and advantage when  the complete Sanskrit text of the /S/ri-bhashya has been printed, and  thus made available for general reference. But meanwhile it is possible,  and--as said before--even urged upon a translator of the Sutras to  compare the interpretations, given by the two bhashyakaras, of those  Sutras, which, more than others, touch on the essential points of the  Vedanta system. This will best be done in connexion with a succinct but  full review of the topics discussed in the adhikara/n/as of the  Vedanta-sutras, according to /S/a@nkara; a review which--apart from the  side-glances at Ramanuja's comments--will be useful as a guide through  the Sutras and the /S/a@nkara-bhashya. Before, however, entering on that  task, I think it advisable to insert short sketches of the philosophical  systems of /S/a@nkara as well as of Ramanuja, which may be referred to  when, later on discrepancies between the two commentators will be noted.  In these sketches I shall confine myself to the leading features, and  not enter into any details. Of /S/a@nkara's system we possess as it is  more than one trustworthy exposition; it may suffice to refer to  Deussen's System of the Vedanta, in which the details of the entire  system, as far as they can be learned from the Sutra-bhashya, are  represented fully and faithfully, and to Gough's Philosophy of the  Upanishads which, principally in its second chapter, gives a lucid  sketch of the /S/a@nkara Vedanta, founded on the Sutra-bhashya, the  Upanishad bhashyas, and some later writers belonging to /S/a@nkara's  school. With regard to Ramanuja's philosophy our chief source was,  hitherto, the Ramanuja chapter in the Sarvadar/s/a/n/asa/m/graha; the  short sketch about to be given is founded altogether on the  /S/ri-bhashya itself.    What in /S/a@nkara's opinion the Upanishads teach, is shortly as  follows.--Whatever is, is in reality one; there truly exists only one  universal being called Brahman or Paramatman, the highest Self. This  being is of an absolutely homogeneous nature; it is pure 'Being,' or,  which comes to the same, pure intelligence or thought (/k/aitanya,  j/n/ana). Intelligence or thought is not to be predicated of Brahman as  its attribute, but constitutes its substance, Brahman is not a thinking  being, but thought itself. It is absolutely destitute of qualities;  whatever qualities or attributes are conceivable, can only be denied of  it.--But, if nothing exists but one absolutely simple being, whence the  appearance of the world by which we see ourselves surrounded, and, in  which we ourselves exist as individual beings?--Brahman, the answer  runs, is associated with a certain power called Maya or avidya to which  the appearance of this entire world is due. This power cannot be called  'being' (sat), for 'being' is only Brahman; nor can it be called  'non-being' (asat) in the strict sense, for it at any rate produces the  appearance of this world. It is in fact a principle of illusion; the  undefinable cause owing to which there seems to exist a material world  comprehending distinct individual existences. Being associated with this  principle of illusion, Brahman is enabled to project the appearance of  the world, in the same way as a magician is enabled by his  incomprehensible magical power to produce illusory appearances of  animate and inanimate beings. Maya thus constitutes the upadana, the  material cause of the world; or--if we wish to call attention to the  circumstance that Maya belongs to Brahman as a /s/akti--we may say that  the material cause of the world is Brahman in so far as it is associated  with Maya. In this latter quality Brahman is more properly called  I/s/vara, the Lord.    Maya, under the guidance of the Lord, modifies itself by a progressive  evolution into all the individual existences (bheda), distinguished by  special names and forms, of which the world consists; from it there  spring in due succession the different material elements and the whole  bodily apparatus belonging to sentient Beings. In all those apparently,  individual forms of existence the one indivisible Brahman is present,  but, owing to the particular adjuncts into which Maya has specialised  itself, it appears to be broken up--it is broken up, as it were--into a  multiplicity, of intellectual or sentient principles, the so-called  jivas (individual or personal souls). What is real in each jiva is only  the universal Brahman itself; the whole aggregate of individualising  bodily organs and mental functions, which in our ordinary experience  separate and distinguish one jiva from another, is the offspring of Maya  and as such unreal.    The phenomenal world or world of ordinary experience (vyavahara) thus  consists of a number of individual souls engaged in specific cognitions,  volitions, and so on, and of the external material objects with which  those cognitions and volitions are concerned. Neither the specific  cognitions nor their objects are real in the true sense of the word, for  both are altogether due to Maya. But at the same time we have to reject  the idealistic doctrine of certain Bauddha schools according to which  nothing whatever truly exists, but certain trains of cognitional acts or  ideas to which no external objects correspond; for external things,  although not real in the strict sense of the word, enjoy at any rate as  much reality as the specific cognitional acts whose objects they are.    The non-enlightened soul is unable to look through and beyond Maya,  which, like a veil, hides from it its true nature. Instead of  recognising itself to be Brahman, it blindly identifies itself with its  adjuncts (upadhi), the fictitious offspring of Maya, and thus looks for  its true Self in the body, the sense organs, and the internal organ  (manas), i.e. the organ of specific cognition. The soul, which in  reality is pure intelligence, non-active, infinite, thus becomes limited  in extent, as it were, limited in knowledge and power, an agent and  enjoyer. Through its actions it burdens itself with merit and demerit,  the consequences of which it has to bear or enjoy in series of future  embodied existences, the Lord--as a retributor and dispenser--allotting  to each soul that form of embodiment to which it is entitled by its  previous actions. At the end of each of the great world periods called  kalpas the Lord retracts the whole world, i.e. the whole material world  is dissolved and merged into non-distinct Maya, while the individual  souls, free for the time from actual connexion with upadhis, lie in deep  slumber as it were. But as the consequences of their former deeds are  not yet exhausted, they have again to enter on embodied existence as  soon as the Lord sends forth a new material world, and the old round of  birth, action, death begins anew to last to all eternity as"]]]
