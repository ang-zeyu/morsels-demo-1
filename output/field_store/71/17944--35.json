S: And when We said: Enter this city, then eat from it a plenteous  (food) wherever you wish, and enter the gate making obeisance, and say,  forgiveness. We will forgive you your wrongs and give more to those who  do good (to others).    002.059  Y: But the transgressors changed the word from that which had been given  them; so We sent on the transgressors a plague from heaven, for that  they infringed (Our command) repeatedly.    P: But those who did wrong changed the word which had been told them for  another saying, and We sent down upon the evil-doers wrath from heaven  for their evil-doing.    S: But those who were unjust changed it for a saying other than that  which had been spoken to them, so We sent upon those who were unjust a  pestilence from heaven, because they transgressed.    002.060  Y: And remember Moses prayed for water for his people; We said:    \"Strike the rock with thy staff.\" Then gushed forth therefrom twelve  springs. Each group knew its own place for water. So eat and drink of  the sustenance provided by Allah, and do no evil nor mischief on the  (face of the) earth.    P: And when Moses asked for water for his people, We said: Smite with  thy staff the rock. And there gushed out therefrom twelve springs (so  that) each tribe knew their drinking-place. Eat and drink of that which  Allah hath provided, and do not act corruptly, making mischief in the  earth.    S: And when Musa prayed for drink for his people, We said: Strike the  rock with your staff So there gushed from it twelve springs; each tribe  knew its drinking place: Eat and drink of the provisions of Allah and  do not act corruptly in the land, making mischief.    002.061  Y: And remember ye said: \"O Moses! we cannot endure one kind of food  (always); so beseech thy Lord for us to produce for us of what the  earth groweth,- its pot-herbs, and cucumbers, its garlic, lentils, and  onions.\" He said: \"Will ye exchange the better for the worse? Go ye  down to any town, and ye shall find what ye want!\" They were covered  with humiliation and misery; they drew on themselves the wrath of  Allah. This because they went on rejecting the Signs of Allah and  slaying His Messengers without just cause. This because they rebelled  and went on transgressing.    P: And when ye said: O Moses! We are weary of one kind of food; so call  upon thy Lord for us that He bring forth for us of that which the earth  groweth - of its herbs and its cucumbers and its corn and its lentils  and its onions. He said: Would ye exchange that which is higher for  that which is lower? Go down to settled country, thus ye shall get that  which ye demand. And humiliation and wretchedness were stamped upon  them and they were visited with wrath from Allah. That was because they  disbelieved in Allah's revelations and slew the prophets wrongfully.  That was for their disobedience and transgression.    S: And when you said: O Musa! we cannot bear with one food, therefore  pray Lord on our behalf to bring forth for us out of what the earth  grows, of its herbs and its cucumbers and its garlic and its lentils  and its onions. He said: Will you exchange that which is better for  that which is worse? Enter a city, so you will have what you ask for.  And abasement and humiliation were brought down upon them, and they  became deserving of Allah's wrath; this was so because they disbelieved  in the communications of Allah and killed the prophets unjustly; this  was so because they disobeyed and exceeded the limits.    002.062  Y: Those who believe (in the Qur'an), and those who follow the Jewish  (scriptures), and the Christians and the Sabians,- any who believe in  Allah and the Last Day, and work righteousness, shall have their reward  with their Lord; on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.    P: Lo! Those who believe (in that which is revealed unto thee,  Muhammad), and those who are Jews, and Christians, and Sabaeans -  whoever believeth in Allah and the Last Day and doeth right - surely  their reward is with their Lord, and there shall no fear come upon them  neither shall they grieve.    S: Surely those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the  Christians, and the Sabians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last day  and does good, they shall have their reward from their Lord, and there  is no fear for them, nor shall they grieve.    002.063  Y: And remember We took your covenant and We raised above you (The  towering height) of Mount (Sinai) (Saying): \"Hold firmly to what We  have given you and bring (ever) to remembrance what is therein:  Perchance ye may fear Allah.\"    P: And (remember, O Children of Israel) when We made a covenant with you  and caused the mount to tower above you, (saying): Hold fast that which  We have given you, and remember that which is therein, that ye may ward  off (evil).    S: And when We took a promise from you and lifted the mountain over you:  Take hold of the law (Tavrat) We have given you with firmness and bear  in mind what is in it, so that you may guard (against evil).    002.064  Y: But ye turned back thereafter: Had it not been for the Grace and  Mercy of Allah to you, ye had surely been among the lost.    P: Then, even after that, ye turned away, and if it had not been for the  grace of Allah and His mercy ye had been among the losers.    S: Then you turned back after that; so were it not for the grace of  Allah and His mercy on you, you would certainly have been among the  losers.    002.065  Y: And well ye knew those amongst you who transgressed in the matter of  the Sabbath: We said to them: \"Be ye apes, despised and rejected.\"    P: And ye know of those of you who broke the Sabbath, how We said unto  them: Be ye apes, despised and hated!    S: And certainly you have known those among you who exceeded the limits  of the Sabbath, so We said to them: Be (as) apes, despised and hated.    002.066  Y: So We made it an example to their own time and to their posterity,  and a lesson to those who fear Allah.    P: And We made it an example to their own and to succeeding generations,  and an admonition to the Allah-fearing.    S: So We made them an example to those who witnessed it and those who  came after it, and an admonition to those who guard (against evil).    002.067  Y: And remember Moses said to his people: \"Allah commands that ye  sacrifice a heifer.\" They said: \"Makest thou a laughing-stock of us?\"  He said: \"Allah save me from being an ignorant (fool)!\"    P: And when Moses said unto his people: Lo! Allah commandeth you that ye  sacrifice a cow, they said: Dost thou make game of us? He answered:  Allah forbid that I should be among the foolish!    S: And when Musa said to his people: Surely Allah commands you that you  should sacrifice a cow; they said: Do you ridicule us? He said: I seek  the protection of Allah from being one of the ignorant.    002.068  Y: They said: \"Beseech on our behalf Thy Lord to make plain to us what  (heifer) it is!\" He said; \"He says: The heifer should be neither too  old nor too young, but of middling age. Now do what ye are commanded!\"    P: They said: Pray for us unto thy Lord that He make clear to us what  (cow) she is. (Moses) answered: Lo! He saith, Verily she is a cow  neither with calf nor immature; (she is) between the two conditions; so  do that which ye are commanded.    S: They said: Call on your Lord for our sake to make it plain to us what  she is. Musa said: He says, Surely she is a cow neither advanced in age  nor too young, of middle age between that (and this); do therefore what  you are commanded.    002.069  Y: They said: \"Beseech on our behalf Thy Lord to make plain to us Her  colour.\" He said: \"He says: A fawn-coloured heifer, pure and rich in  tone, the admiration of beholders!\"    P: They said: Pray for us unto thy Lord that He make clear to us of what  colour she is. (Moses) answered: Lo! He saith: Verily she is a yellow  cow. Bright is her colour, gladdening beholders.    S: They said: Call on your Lord for our sake to make it plain to us what  her color is. Musa said: He says, Surely she is a yellow cow; her color  is intensely yellow, giving delight to the beholders.    002.070  Y: They said: \"Beseech on our behalf Thy Lord to make plain to us what  she is: To us are all heifers alike: We wish indeed for guidance, if  Allah wills.\"    P: They said: Pray for us unto thy Lord that He make clear to us what  (cow) she is. Lo! cows are much alike to us; and Lo! if Allah wills, we  may be led aright.    S: They said: Call on your Lord for our sake to make it plain to us what  she is, for surely to us the cows are all alike, and if Allah please we  shall surely be guided aright.    002.071  Y: He said: \"He says: A heifer not trained to till the soil or water the  fields; sound and without blemish.\" They said: \"Now hast thou brought  the truth.\" Then they offered her in sacrifice, but not with good-will.    P: (Moses) answered: Lo! He saith: Verily she is a cow unyoked; she  plougheth not the soil nor watereth the tilth; whole and without mark.  They said: Now thou bringest the truth. So they sacrificed her, though  almost they did not.    S: Musa said: He says, Surely she is a cow not made submissive that she  should plough the land, nor does she irrigate the tilth; sound, without  a blemish in her. They said: Now you have brought"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16957"],[0,"Mr. Sponge's Sporting Tour (#4)"],[1,"to the inspection.    Peter Leather, having a peep-hole as well as his master, on seeing Mr.  Sponge arrive, had given himself an extra rub over, and covered his dirty  shirt with a clean, well-tied, white kerchief, and a whole coloured scarlet  waistcoat, late the property of one of his noble employers, in hopes that  Sponge's visit might lead to something. Peter was about sick of the  suburbs, and thought, of course, that he couldn't be worse off than where  he was.    'Here's Mr. Sponge wants some osses,' observed Mr. Buckram, as Leather met  them in the middle of the little yard, and brought his right arm round with  a sort of military swing to his forehead; 'what 'ave we in?' continued  Buckram, with the air of a man with so many horses that he didn't know what  were in and what were out.    'Vy we 'ave Rumbleton in,' replied Leather, thoughtfully, stroking down his  hair as he spoke, 'and we 'ave Jack o'Lanthorn in, and we 'ave the Camel  in, and there's the little Hirish oss with the sprig tail--Jack-a-Dandy, as  I calls him, and the Flyer will be in to-night, he's just out a hairing, as  it were, with old Mr. Callipash.'    'Ah, Rumbleton won't do for Mr. Sponge,' observed Buckram, thoughtfully, at  the same time letting go a tremendous avalanche of silver down his trouser  pocket, 'Rumbleton won't do,' repeated he, 'nor Jack-a-Dandy nouther.'    'Why, I wouldn't commend neither on 'em,' replied Peter, taking his cue  from his master, 'only ven you axes me vot there's in, you knows vy I must  give you a _cor_-rect answer, in course.'    'In course,' nodded Buckram.    Leather and Buckram had a good understanding in the lying line, and had  fallen into a sort of tacit arrangement that if the former was staunch  about the horses he was at liberty to make the best terms he could for  himself. Whatever Buckram said, Leather swore to, and they had established  certain signals and expressions that each understood.    'I've an unkimmon nice oss,' at length observed Mr. Buckram, with a  scrutinizing glance at Sponge, 'and an oss in hevery respect werry like  your work, but he's an oss I'll candidly state, I wouldn't put in every  one's 'ands, for, in the fust place, he's wery walueous, and in the second,  he requires an ossman to ride; howsomever, as I knows that you _can_ ride,  and if you doesn't mind taking my 'ead man,' jerking his elbow at Leather,  'to look arter him, I wouldn't mind 'commodatin' on you, prowided we can  'gree upon terms.'    'Well, let's see him,' interrupted Sponge, 'and we can talk about terms  after.'    'Certainly, sir, certainly,' replied Buckram, again letting loose a  reaccumulated rush of silver down his pocket. 'Here, Tom! Joe! Harry!  where's Sam?' giving the little tinkler of a bell a pull as he spoke.    'Sam be in the straw 'ouse,' replied Leather, passing through a stable into  a wooden projection beyond, where the gentleman in question was enjoying a  nap.    'Sam!' said he, 'Sam!' repeated he, in a louder tone, as he saw the object  of his search's nose popping through the midst of the straw.    'What now?' exclaimed Sam, starting up, and looking wildly around; 'what  now?' repeated he, rubbing his eyes with the backs of his hands.    'Get out Ercles,' said Leather, _sotto voce_.    The lad was a mere stripling--some fifteen or sixteen, years,  perhaps--tall, slight, and neat, with dark hair and eyes, and was dressed  in a brown jacket--a real boy's jacket, without laps, white cords, and  top-boots. It was his business to risk his neck and limbs at all hours of  the day, on all sorts of horses, over any sort of place that any person  chose to require him to put a horse at, and this he did with the daring  pleasure of youth as yet undaunted by any serious fall. Sam now bestirred  himself to get out the horse. The clambering of hoofs presently announced  his approach.    Whether Hercules was called Hercules on account of his amazing strength, or  from a fanciful relationship to the famous horse of that name, we know  not; but his strength and his colour would favour either supposition. He  was an immense, tall, powerful, dark brown, sixteen hands horse, with an  arched neck and crest, well set on, clean, lean head, and loins that looked  as if they could shoot a man into the next county. His condition was  perfect. His coat lay as close and even as satin, with cleanly developed  muscle, and altogether he looked as hard as a cricket-ball. He had a famous  switch tail, reaching nearly to his hocks, and making him look less than he  would otherwise have done.    Mr. Sponge was too well versed in horse-flesh to imagine that such an  animal would be in the possession of such a third-rate dealer as Buckram,  unless there was something radically wrong about him, and as Sam and  Leather were paying the horse those stable attentions that always precede a  show out, Mr. Sponge settled in his own mind that the observation about his  requiring a horseman to ride him, meant that he was vicious. Nor was he  wrong in his anticipations, for not all Leather's whistlings, or Sam's  endearings and watchings, could conceal the sunken, scowling eye, that as  good as said, 'you'd better keep clear of me.'    Mr. Sponge, however, was a dauntless horseman. What man dared he dared, and  as the horse stepped proudly and freely out of the stable, Mr. Sponge  thought he looked very like a hunter. Nor were Mr. Buckram's laudations  wanting in the animal's behalf.    'There's an 'orse!' exclaimed he, drawing his right hand out of his trouser  pocket, and flourishing it towards him. 'If that 'orse were down in  Leicestersheer,' added he, 'he'd fetch three 'under'd guineas. Sir Richard  would 'ave him in a minnit--_that he would!_' added he, with a stamp of his  foot as he saw the animal beginning to set up his back and wince at the  approach of the lad. (We may here mention by way of parenthesis, that Mr.  Buckram had brought him out of Warwicksheer for thirty pounds, where the  horse had greatly distinguished himself, as well by kicking off sundry  scarlet swells in the gaily thronged streets of Leamington, as by running  away with divers others over the wide-stretching grazing grounds of  Southam and Dunchurch.)    But to our story. The horse now stood staring on view: fire in his eye, and  vigour in his every limb. Leather at his head, the lad at his side. Sponge  and Buckram a little on the left.    'W--h--o--a--a--y, my man, w--h--o--a--a--y,' continued Mr. Buckram, as a  liberal show of the white of the eye was followed by a little wince and  hoist of the hind quarters on the nearer approach of the lad.    'Look sharp, boy,' said he, in a very different tone to the soothing one in  which he had just been addressing the horse. The lad lifted up his leg for  a hoist. Leather gave him one as quick as thought, and led on the horse as  the lad gathered up his reins. They then made for a large field at the back  of the house, with leaping-bars, hurdles, 'on and offs,' 'ins and outs,'  all sorts of fancy leaps scattered about. Having got him fairly in, and the  lad having got himself fairly settled in the saddle he gave the horse a  touch with the spur as Leather let go his head, and after a desperate  plunge or two started off at a gallop.    'He's fresh,' observed Mr. Buckram confidentially to Mr. Sponge, 'he's  fresh--wants work, in short--short of work--wouldn't put every one on  him--wouldn't put one o' your timid cocknified chaps on him, for if ever he  were to get the hupper 'and, vy I doesn't know as 'ow that we might get the  hupper 'and o' him, agen, but the playful rogue knows ven he's got a  workman on his back--see how he gives to the lad though he's only fifteen,  and not strong of his hage nouther,' continued Mr. Buckram, 'and I guess if  he had sich a consternation of talent as you on his back, he'd wery soon be  as quiet as a lamb--not that he's wicious--far from it, only play--full of  play, I may say, though to be sure, if a man gets spilt it don't argufy  much whether it's done from play or from wice.'    During this time the horse was going through his evolutions, hopping over  this thing, popping over that, making as little of everything as practice  makes them do.    Having gone through the usual routine, the lad now walked the glowing  coated snorting horse back to where the trio stood. Mr. Sponge again looked  him over, and still seeing no exception to take to him, bid the lad get off  and lengthen the stirrups for him to take a ride. That was the difficulty.  The first two minutes always did it. Mr. Sponge, however, nothing daunted,  borrowed Sam's spurs, and making Leather hold the horse by the head till he  got well into the saddle, and then lead him on a bit; he gave the animal  such a dig in both sides as fairly threw him off his guard, and made him  start away at a gallop, instead of standing and delivering, as was his  wont.    Away Mr. Sponge shot, pulling him about, trying all his paces, and putting  him at all sorts of leaps.    Emboldened by the nerve and dexterity displayed by Mr. Sponge, Mr. Buckram  stood meditating a further trial of his equestrian ability, as he watched  him bucketing 'Ercles' about. Hercules had 'spang-hewed' so many triers,  and the hideous contraction of his resolute back had deterred so many from  mounting, that Buckram had begun to fear he would have to place him in the  only remaining school for incurables, the 'bus. Hack-horse riders are  seldom great horsemen. The very fact of their being hack-horse riders shows  they are little accustomed to horses, or they would not give the fee-simple  of an animal for a few weeks' work.    'I've a wonderful clever little oss,' observed Mr. Buckram, as Sponge  returned with a slack-rein and a satisfied air on the late resolute  animal's back. '_Little_ I can 'ardly call 'im,' continued Mr. Buckram,  'only he's low; but you knows that the 'eight of an oss has nothin' to do  with his size. Now this"]]]
