It is also cultivated in Persia,  the East Indies, Liberia on the coast of Africa, the West Indies,  Brazil and other parts of South America, as well as in most tropical  climates.         _Tropical_, being within the tropics, that is, in the Torrid       Zone.      Who was the original discoverer of Coffee, for the drink of man?    It is not exactly known: the earliest written accounts of the use of  Coffee are by Arabian writers in the 15th century; it appears that in  the city of Aden it became, in the latter half of that century, a very  popular drink, first with lawyers, studious persons, and those whose  occupation required wakefulness at night, and soon after, with all  classes. Its use gradually extended to other cities, and to those on  the eastern shores of the Mediterranean. Towards the end of the  seventeenth century, it was carried to Batavia where it was soon  extensively planted, and at last young trees were sent to the  botanical garden at Amsterdam.      Who introduced it into France and England?    Thevenot, the traveller, brought it into France, and a Greek servant  named Pasqua (taken to England by Mr. Daniel Edwards, a Turkey  merchant, in 1652, to make his coffee,) first set up the profession of  coffee-man, and introduced the drink among the English.      How is it prepared?    The berries are roasted in a revolving metallic cylinder, till they  are of a deep brown color, and then ground to powder, and boiled.         _Metallic_, consisting of metal.      What is Chocolate?    A kind of cake or paste, made of the kernel of the cacao-nut.      Describe the Cacao-nut Tree.    It resembles the cherry tree, and grows to the height of fifteen or  sixteen feet. The cacao-nut tree bears leaves, flowers, and fruit, all  the year through.      Where does it grow?    In tropical regions, where it is largely cultivated.      Of what form is the fruit?    It is somewhat like a cucumber, about three inches round, and of a  yellowish red color. It contains from ten to forty seeds, each covered  with a little rind, of a violet color; when this is stripped off, the  kernel, of which they make the chocolate, is visible.      How do they make it into a drink?    By boiling it with water or milk. There are various newly-invented  ways of preparing chocolate, so that it may be made in a few minutes,  by only pouring boiling water upon it.          CHAPTER III.    CALICO, COTTON, CLOTH, WOOL, BAIZE, LINEN, FLAX, HEMP, DIAPER,  HOLLAND, CANVAS, AND FLANNEL.      What is Calico?    A kind of printed cotton cloth, of different colors.      From what place did it take its name?    From Calicut, a city on the coast of Malabar, where it was first made;  much is now manufactured in the United States, England, and many other  countries.      What is Cotton?    A downy or woolly substance, enclosed in the pod, or seed-vessel, of  the cotton-plant. The commercial classification of cotton is  determined--1, by cleanliness or freedom from sand, dry leaf, and  other impurities; 2, by absence of color; both subject also to  character of staple, length, and strength and fineness of fibre. These  together determine relative value. There are two general  classifications, long-stapled and short-stapled. Of the former the  best is the sea island cotton of the United States. The _short staple  cotton_, grows in the middle and upper country; the long staple is  cultivated in the lower country near the sea, and on the islands near  the coasts.      How is it cultivated?    The seeds are sown in ridges made with the plough or hoe; when the  plants are mature, the pods open, and the cotton is picked from them.      Where did Cotton anciently grow, and for what was it used?    In Egypt, where it was used by the priests and sacrificers, for a very  singular kind of garment worn by them alone.      In what manufacture is it now used?    It is woven into muslins, dimities, cloths, calicoes, &c.; and is  also joined with silks and flax, in the composition of other stuffs,  and in working with the needle.      How is the Cotton separated from the seed?    By machines called _cotton gins_, of which there are two kinds; the  _roller-gin_, and the _saw-gin_. In the former, the cotton, just as  gathered from the plant, is drawn between two rollers, placed so  closely together as to permit the passage of the cotton, but not of  the seeds, which are consequently left behind. In the _saw-gin_, the  cotton is placed in a receiver, one side of which consists of a  grating of parallel wires, about an eighth of an inch apart; circular  saws, revolving on a common axis between these wires, entangle in  their teeth the cotton, and draw it from the seeds, which are too  large to pass between the wires.      How is it made into Calico, &c.?    The cotton having been separated from the seed, is spun by a machine  for the purpose. It is next woven, then dressed, and printed.      What is Cloth?    The word, in its general sense, includes all kinds of stuffs woven in  the loom, whether the threads be of wool, cotton, hemp, or flax.      To what is it more particularly applied?    To a web or tissue of woollen threads.         _Web_, any thing woven.      What is Wool?    The covering or hair of sheep. To prepare it for the weaver, it is  first shorn, washed, and dried, then carded or combed by machinery  into fibres or threads: formerly this was always performed by the  hand, by means of an instrument, called a comb, with several rows of  pointed teeth; this, though not much used now, is still occasionally  employed, except in large factories. This combing is repeated two or  three times, till it is sufficiently smooth and even for spinning.  Spinning or converting wool, or cotton, silk, &c. into thread, was  anciently performed by the distaff and spindle: these we find  mentioned in sacred history, and they have been used in all ages, and  in all countries yet discovered. The natives of India, and of some  other parts of the world, still employ this simple invention.      What was the next improvement?    The invention of the hand-wheel. In 1767, a machine called the  spinning-jenny was invented by a weaver named Hargreaves; but the  greatest improvement in the art of spinning was effected by Mr.  Arkwright, in 1768: these two inventions were combined, and again  improved upon in 1776; so that by the new plan, the material can be  converted into thread in a considerably shorter space of time than in  the ancient mode; leaving to man merely to feed the machine, and join  the threads when they break. The sheep, whose wool forms the material  for nearly all woollen clothing, came originally from Africa.      Does weaving differ according to the material used?    The principle of weaving is the same in every kind of fabric, and  consists in forming any kind of thread into a flat web, or cloth, by  interlacing one thread with another; the various appearances of the  manufacture arise as much from the modes in which the threads are  interwoven, as from the difference of material.      Is not the employment of Wool in the manufacture of Clothing of great  antiquity?    In the earliest records we possess of the arts of mankind, wool is  mentioned as forming a chief article in the manufacture of clothing;  it is spoken of in the Bible, as a common material for cloth, as early  as the time of Moses. The ancient Greeks and Romans are well known to  have possessed this art. At the beginning of the thirteenth century,  the manufacture was established in many parts of Europe, particularly  in Spain, from which country it extended itself to France and Italy.  There is no doubt that it was introduced into England by its  conquerors the Romans, a manufactory being established at Winchester,  sufficiently large to supply the Roman army.         _Manufactory_, a place where things are made or       manufactured; derived from the Latin _manus_, a hand, and       the verb _facio_, to do or make.      What circumstance contributed to the progress of this manufacture  among the English?    In 1330, the English, being desirous of improving their woollen  manufacture, invited over the Flemings, by the offer of various  privileges, to establish manufactories there. The skill of these  people soon effected a great improvement in the English fabrics, so  that there no longer remained any occasion for the exportation of  English wool into Flanders, to be manufactured into fine cloth; and a  law was passed by the government to forbid it. Both the cotton and  woollen manufactures have, of late years, arisen to great importance  in the United States.      What country affords the best Wool?    The wool of Germany is most esteemed at the present day: that of Spain  was formerly the most valuable, but the Spanish breed of sheep, having  been introduced into Germany, succeeded better there than in Spain,  and increased so rapidly, that the Spanish wool trade has greatly  diminished. Australia is one of the principal wool-growing countries  in the world, for the breed of sheep sent out to that country and  Tasmania has succeeded remarkably well.      What part of the world is meant by Australia?    A British Island in the South Pacific Ocean, comprising the Colonies  of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Western  Australia. It is the principal of the group of large islands, in the  Oriental Archipelago. Tasmania is another of the same group, separated  from New South Wales by a channel called Bass's Strait, and also  belongs to Great Britain.      What is meant by an Archipelago?    A part of a sea studded with numerous islands; but the term is more  particularly applied to that lying between Europe and Asia, which  contains the Greek Islands. The word is a corruption from the Greek,  signifying the AEgean Sea.      Is the Wool of the sheep all of one quality?    No; it varies according to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16737"],[0,"International Language, Past, Present & Future (#4)"],[1,"solemn declamation of one of his hymns (given  as an appendix to this volume, with translation), embodying the lofty  ideal which has inspired him all through and sustained him through the  many difficulties he has had to face. When he came to the end, the fine  passage beginning with the words, _Ni inter popoloj la murojn detruos_  (\"we shall throw down the walls between the peoples\"), and ending _amo  kaj vero ekregos sur tero_ (\"love and truth shall begin their reign on  earth\"), the whole concourse rose to their feet with prolonged cries of  \"Vivu Zamenhof!\"    No doubt this enthusiasm may sound rather forced and unreal to those  who have not attended a congress, and the cheers may ring hollow across  intervening time and space. Neither would it be good for this or any  movement to rely upon facile enthusiasm, as easily damped as aroused.  There is something far more than this in the international language  movement.    At the same time, it is impossible for any one who has not tried it to  realize the thrill--not a weak, sentimental thrill, but a reasonable  thrill, starting from objective fact and running down the marrow of  things--given by the first real contact with an international language  in an international setting. There really is a feeling as of a new power  born into the world.    Those who were present at the Geneva Congress, 1906, will not soon  forget the singing of the song \"La Espero\" at the solemn closing of  the week's proceedings. The organ rolled out the melody, and when the  gathered thousands that thronged the floor of the hall and packed the  galleries tier on tier to the ceiling took up the opening phrase--                         En la mondon venis nova sento,                       Tra la mondo iras forta voko,[1]    they meant every word of it. It was a fitting summary of the impressions  left by the events of the week, and what the lips uttered must have been  in the hearts and minds of all.       [1]Into the world has come a new feeling,     Through the world goes a mighty call.    As an ounce of personal experience is worth a pound of second-hand  recital, a brief statement may here be given of the way in which the  present writer came to take up Esperanto, and of the experiences which  soon led him to the conviction of its absolute practicability and  utility.    In October, 1905, having just returned from an absence of some years in  Canada and the Far East, he had his attention turned to Esperanto for  the first time by reading an account of the Congress of Boulogne. He had  no previous knowledge of, or leanings towards, a universal language; and  if he had thought about it at all, it was only to laugh at the idea as a  wild and visionary scheme. In short, his attitude was quite normal.    But here was a definite statement, professing to be one of positive  accomplished fact. One of two things: either the newspaper account  was not true; or else, the facts being as represented, here was a  new possibility to be reckoned with. The only course was to send for  the books and test the thing on its merits. Being somewhat used to  languages, he did not take long to see that this one was good enough in  itself. A letter, written in Esperanto, after a few days' study of the  grammar at odd times, with a halfpenny Esperanto-English key enclosed,  was fully understood by the addressee, though he was ignorant up till  then of the very existence of Esperanto. This experience has often been  since repeated; indeed, the correspondent will often write back after a  few days in Esperanto. Such letters have always been found intelligible,  though in no case did the correspondent know Esperanto previously. The  experiment is instructive and amusing, and can be tried by any one for  an expenditure of twopence for keys and a few hours for studying the  sixteen rules and their application. To many minds these are far simpler  and more easy to grasp for practical use than the rules for scoring at  bridge.    After a month or two's playing with the language in spare time,  the writer further tested it, by sending out a flight of postcards  to various selected Esperantists' addresses in different parts of  the Russian Empire. The addressees ranged from St. Petersburg and  Helsingfors through Poland to the Caucasus and to far Siberia. In nearly  every case answers were received, and in some instances the initial  interchange of postcards led to an extremely interesting correspondence,  throwing much light on the disturbed state of things in the native  town or province of the correspondent. From a Tiflis doctor came a  graphic account of the state of affairs in the Caucasus; while a school  inspector from the depths of Eastern Siberia painted a vivid picture of  the effect of political unrest on the schools--lockouts and \"malodorous  chemical obstructions\" (_Anglice_--the schools were stunk out). Many  writers expressed themselves with great freedom, but feared their  letters would not pass the censor. Judging by the proportion of answers  received, the censorship was not at that time efficient. In no case was  there any difficulty in grasping the writer's meaning. All the answers  were in Esperanto.    This was fairly convincing, but still having doubts on the question of  pronunciation, the writer resolved to attend the Esperanto Congress  to be held at Geneva in August 1906. To this end he continued to read  Esperanto at odd minutes and took in an Esperanto gazette. About three  weeks before the congress he got a member of his family to read aloud to  him every day as far as possible a page or two of Esperanto, in order  to attune his ear. He never had an opportunity of speaking the language  before the congress, except once for a few minutes, when he travelled  some distance to attend a meeting of the nearest English group.    Thus equipped, he went through the Congress of Geneva, and found himself  able to follow most of the proceedings, and to converse freely, though  slowly, with people of the most diverse nationality. At an early sitting  of the congress he found himself next to a Russian from Kischineff,  who had been through the first great _pogrom_, and a most interesting  conversation ensued. Another day the neighbours were an Indian nawab  and an abbé from Madrid. Another time it was a Bulgarian. At the first  official banquet he sat next to a Finn, who rejoiced in the name of  Attila, and, but for the civilizing influence of a universal language,  might have been in the sunny south, like his namesake of the ancient  world, on a very different errand from his present peaceful one. Yet  here he was, rubbing elbows with Italians, as if there had never been  such things as Huns or a sack of Rome by northern barbarians.    During the meal a Frenchman, finding himself near us English and some  Germans, proposed a toast to the \"entente cordiale taking in Germany,\"  which was honoured with great enthusiasm. This is merely an instance of  the small ways in which such gatherings make for peace and good will.    With all these people it was perfectly easy to converse in the common  tongue, pronunciation and national idiom being no bar in practice.    And this experience was general throughout the duration of the congress.  Day by day sittings were held for the transaction of all kinds of  business and the discussion of the most varied subjects. It was  impressive to see people from half the countries of the world rise  from different corners of the hall and contribute their share to the  discussion in the most matter-of-fact way. Day by day the congressists  met in social functions, debates, lectures, and sectional groups  (chemical, medical, legal, etc.) for the regulation of matters touching  their special interests. Everything was done in Esperanto, and never  was there the slightest hitch or misunderstanding, or failure to give  adequate expression to opinions owing to defects of language. The  language difficulty was annihilated.    Perhaps one of the most striking demonstrations of this return to  pre-Babel conditions was the performance of a three-part comedy by a  Frenchman, a Russian, and a Spaniard. Such a thing would inevitably  have been grotesque in any national language; but here they met on  common neutral ground. No one's accent was \"foreign,\" and none of the  spectators possessed that mother-tongue acquaintance with Esperanto that  would lead them to feel slight divergences shocking, or even noticeable  without extreme attention to the point. Other theatrical performances  were given at Geneva, as also at Boulogne, where a play of Molière  was performed in Esperanto by actors of eight nationalities with one  rehearsal, and with full success.    In the face of these facts it is idle to oppose a universal artificial  language on the score of impossibility or inadequacy. The theoretical  pronunciation difficulty completely crumbled away before the test of  practice.    The \"war-at-any-price party,\" the whole-hoggers _à tous crins_ (the  juxtaposition of the two national idioms lends a certain realism, and  heightens the effect of each), are therefore driven back on their  second line of attack, if the Hibernianism may be excused. \"Yes,\" they  say, \"your language may be possible, but, after all, why not learn an  existing language, if you've got to learn one anyway?\"    Now, quite apart from the obvious fact that the nations will never agree  to give the preference to the language of one of them to the prejudice  of the others, this argument involves the suggestion that an artificial  language is no easier to learn than a natural one. We thus come to the  question of ease as a qualification.
