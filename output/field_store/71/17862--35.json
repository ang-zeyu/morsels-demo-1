[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15263"],[0,"The Underground Railroad (#4)"],[1," the  first man whom Peter Still sought advice from was his own unknown  brother (whom he had never seen or heard of), who made the discovery  that he was the long-lost boy, whose history and fate had been enveloped  in sadness so long, and for whom his mother had shed so many tears and  offered so many prayers, during the long years of their separation; and,  finally, how this self-ransomed and restored captive, notwithstanding  his great success, was destined to suffer the keenest pangs of sorrow  for his wife and children, whom he had left in Alabama bondage.    Seth Concklin was naturally too singularly sympathetic and humane not to  feel now for Peter, and especially for his wife and children left in  bonds as bound with them. Hence, as Seth was a man who seemed wholly  insensible to fear, and to know no other law of humanity and right, than  whenever the claims of the suffering and the wronged appealed to him, to  respond unreservedly, whether those thus injured were amongst his  nearest kin or the greatest strangers,--it mattered not to what race or  clime they might belong,--he, in the spirit of the good Samaritan,  owning all such as his neighbors, volunteered his services, without pay  or reward, to go and rescue the wife and three children of Peter Still.    The magnitude of this offer can hardly be appreciated. It was literally  laying his life on the altar of freedom for the despised and oppressed  whom he had never seen, whose kins-folk even he was not acquainted with.  At this juncture even Peter was not prepared to accept this proposal. He  wanted to secure the freedom of his wife and children as earnestly as he  had ever desired to see his mother, yet he could not, at first, hearken  to the idea of having them rescued in the way suggested by Concklin,  fearing a failure.    To J.M. McKim and the writer, the bold scheme for the deliverance of  Peter's family was alone confided. It was never submitted to the  Vigilance Committee, for the reason, that it was not considered a matter  belonging thereto. On first reflection, the very idea of such an  undertaking seemed perfectly appalling. Frankly was he told of the great  dangers and difficulties to be encountered through hundreds of miles of  slave territory. Seth was told of those who, in attempting to aid slaves  to escape had fallen victims to the relentless Slave Power, and had  either lost their lives, or been incarcerated for long years in  penitentiaries, where no friendly aid could be afforded them; in short,  he was plainly told, that without a very great chance, the undertaking  would cost him his life. The occasion of this interview and  conversation, the seriousness of Concklin and the utter failure in  presenting the various obstacles to his plan, to create the slightest  apparent misgiving in his mind, or to produce the slightest sense of  fear or hesitancy, can never be effaced from the memory of the writer.  The plan was, however, allowed to rest for a time.    In the meanwhile, Peter's mind was continually vacillating between  Alabama, with his wife and children, and his new-found relatives in the  North. Said a brother, \"If you cannot get your family, what will you do?  Will you come North and live with your relatives?\" \"I would as soon go  out of the world, as not to go back and do all I can for them,\" was the  prompt reply of Peter.    The problem of buying them was seriously considered, but here obstacles  quite formidable lay in the way. Alabama laws utterly denied the right  of a slave to buy himself, much less his wife and children. The right of  slave masters to free their slaves, either by sale or emancipation, was  positively prohibited by law. With these reflections weighing upon his  mind, having stayed away from his wife as long as he could content  himself to do, he took his carpet-bag in his hand, and turned his face  toward Alabama, to embrace his family in the prison-house of bondage.    His approach home could only be made stealthily, not daring to breathe  to a living soul, save his own family, his nominal Jew master, and one  other friend--a slave--where he had been, the prize he had found, or  anything in relation to his travels. To his wife and children his return  was unspeakably joyous. The situation of his family concerned him with  tenfold more weight than ever before,    As the time drew near to make the offer to his wife's master to purchase  her with his children, his heart failed him through fear of awakening  the ire of slaveholders against him, as he knew that the law and public  sentiment were alike deadly opposed to the spirit of freedom in the  slave. Indeed, as innocent as a step in this direction might appear, in  those days a man would have stood about as good a chance for his life in  entering a lair of hungry hyenas, as a slave or free colored man would,  in talking about freedom.    He concluded, therefore, to say nothing about buying. The plan proposed  by Seth Concklin was told to Vina, his wife; also what he had heard from  his brother about the Underground Rail Road,--how, that many who could  not get their freedom in any other way, by being aided a little, were  daily escaping to Canada. Although the wife and children had never  tasted the pleasures of freedom for a single hour in their lives, they  hated slavery heartily, and being about to be far separated from husband  and father, they were ready to assent to any proposition that looked  like deliverance.    So Peter proposed to Vina, that she should give him certain small  articles, consisting of a cape, etc., which he would carry with him as  memorials, and, in case Concklin or any one else should ever come for  her from him, as an unmistakable sign that all was right, he would send  back, by whoever was to befriend them, the cape, so that she and the  children might not doubt but have faith in the man, when he gave her the  sign, (cape).    Again Peter returned to Philadelphia, and was now willing to accept the  offer of Concklin. Ere long, the opportunity of an interview was had,  and Peter gave Seth a very full description of the country and of his  family, and made known to him, that he had very carefully gone over with  his wife and children the matter of their freedom. This interview  interested Concklin most deeply. If his own wife and children had been  in bondage, scarcely could he have manifested greater sympathy for them.    For the hazardous work before him he was at once prepared to make a  start. True he had two sisters in Philadelphia for whom he had always  cherished the warmest affection, but he conferred not with them on this  momentous mission. For full well did he know that it was not in human  nature for them to acquiesce in this perilous undertaking, though one of  these sisters, Mrs. Supplee, was a most faithful abolitionist.    Having once laid his hand to the plough he was not the man to look  back,--not even to bid his sisters good-bye, but he actually left them  as though he expected to be home to his dinner as usual. What had become  of him during those many weeks of his perilous labors in Alabama to  rescue this family was to none a greater mystery than to his sisters. On  leaving home he simply took two or three small articles in the way of  apparel with one hundred dollars to defray his expenses for a time; this  sum he considered ample to start with. Of course he had very safely  concealed about him Vina's cape and one or two other articles which he  was to use for his identification in meeting her and the children on the  plantation.    His first thought was, on reaching his destination, after becoming  acquainted with the family, being familiar with Southern manners, to  have them all prepared at a given hour for the starting of the steamboat  for Cincinnati, and to join him at the wharf, when he would boldly  assume the part of a slaveholder, and the family naturally that of  slaves, and in this way he hoped to reach Cincinnati direct, before  their owner had fairly discovered their escape.    But alas for Southern irregularity, two or three days' delay after being  advertised to start, was no uncommon circumstance with steamers; hence  this plan was abandoned. What this heroic man endured from severe  struggles and unyielding exertions, in traveling thousands of miles on  water and on foot, hungry and fatigued, rowing his living freight for  seven days and seven nights in a skiff, is hardly to be paralleled in  the annals of the Underground Rail Road.    The following interesting letters penned by the hand of Concklin convey  minutely his last struggles and characteristically represent the  singleness of heart which impelled him to sacrifice his life for the  slave--    EASTPORT, MISS., FEB. 3, 1851.    To Wm. Still:--Our friends in Cincinnati have failed finding anybody to  assist me on my return. Searching the country opposite Paducah, I find  that the whole country fifty miles round is inhabited only by Christian  wolves. It is customary, when a strange negro is seen, for any white man  to seize the negro and convey such negro through and out of the State of  Illinois to Paducah, Ky., and lodge such stranger in Paducah jail, and  there claim such reward as may be offered by the master.    There is no regularity by the steamboats on the Tennessee River. I was  four days getting to Florence from Paducah. Sometimes they are four days  starting, from the time appointed, which alone puts to rest the plan for  returning by steamboat. The distance from the mouth of the river to  Florence, is from between three hundred and five to three hundred and  forty-five miles by the river; by land, two hundred and fifty, or more.    I arrived at the shoe shop on the plantation, one o'clock, Tuesday,  28th. William and two boys were making shoes. I immediately gave the  first signal, anxiously waiting thirty minutes for an opportunity to  give the second and main signal, during which time I was very sociable.

And with that  one made a grab for Uncle Wiggily. But what did that brave rabbit  gentleman do but stick his red-white-and-blue crutch out in front of him,  and the fox bit on that instead of on Uncle Wiggily. Right into the crutch  the fox's teeth sank, and for a moment Uncle Wiggily was safe. But not for  long.    \"Ah, you fooled me that time, but now I'll get you!\" cried the fox, and,  letting go of the crutch, he made another grab for the rabbit.    But at that instant Fido Flip-Flop, who had been jumping about, keeping  out of the way of the fox that was after him, cried out quite loudly:    \"Look here, everybody but Uncle Wiggily, and, as for you, shut both your  eyes tight.\"    Now the old gentleman rabbit couldn't imagine why he was to shut his eyes  tight, but he did so, and then what do you s'pose Fido Flip-Flop did? Why,  he began turning somersaults so fast that he looked just like a pinwheel  going around, or an automobile tire whizzing along. Faster and faster did  Fido Flip-Flop turn around, and then, all of a sudden, he began chasing  his tail, making motions just like a merry-go-round in a circus, until  those two foxes were fairly dizzy from watching him.    \"Stop! Stop!\" cried one fox.    \"Yes do stop! We're so dizzy that we can't stand up!\" cried the other fox,  staggering about. \"Stop!\"    \"No, I'll not!\" answered Fido Flip-Flop, and he went around faster that  ever, faster and faster and faster, until those two bad foxes got so  dizzy-izzy that they fell right over on their backs, with their legs  sticking straight up in the air like clothes posts, and their tails were  wiggling back and forth in the dirt, like dusting brushes. Oh, but they  were the dizzy foxes, though.    \"Now's your chance! Run! Run! Uncle Wiggily! Run!\" called Fido Flip-Flop  \"Open your eyes and run!\"    So the old gentleman rabbit opened his eyes, took up his valise which he  had dropped, and, hopping on his crutch, he and the poodle doggie ran on  through the woods, leaving the two surprised and disappointed foxes still  lying on their backs, wiggling their tails in the dust, and too dizzy,  from having watched Fido Flip-Flop do somersaults, and chase his tail, to  be able to get up.    \"Why did you want me to shut my eyes?\" asked Uncle Wiggily, when they were  so far away from the foxes that there was no more danger.    \"That was so _you_ wouldn't get dizzy from watching me do the flip-flops,\"  answered the doggie. \"My, but that was a narrow escape, though. Have you  had many adventures like that since you started out to seek your fortune?\"    \"Yes, several,\" answered the rabbit. \"But turning flip-flops is a very  good thing to know how to do. I wonder if you could teach me, so that when  any more foxes or alligators chase me I can make them dizzy by turning  around? Can you teach me?\"    \"I'm sure I can,\" said Fido. \"Here, this is the way to begin,\" and he did  some flip-flops slow and easy-like. Then Uncle Wiggily tried them, and,  though he couldn't do them very well at first, he practised until he was  quite good at it. Then Fido showed him how to stand on one ear, and wiggle  the other, and how to blink his eyes while standing on the end of his  little tail, and then Uncle Wiggily thought of a new trick, all by  himself.    \"I'll stick my crutch in the ground, like a clothes pole,\" he said to  Fido, \"and then I'll hop up on it and sing a song,\" which he did, singing  a song that went like this:        \"Did you ever see a rabbit         Do a flipper-flopper-flap?       If not just kindly watch me,         As I wear my baseball cap.        \"It's very strange, some folks may say,         And also rather funny,       To see a kinky poodle dog         Play with a flip-flop bunny.        \"But we are on our travels,         Adventures for to seek,       We may find one, or two, or three,         'Most any day next week.\"    And then Uncle Wiggily hopped down, and waved both ears backward and  forward, and made a low bow to a make-believe crowd of people, only, of  course, there were none there.    \"Fine! Fine!\" cried Fido Flip-Flop. \"That's better than I did when I was  in the circus. Now I'll tell you what let's do.\"    \"What?\" asked Uncle Wiggily.    \"Let's go around and give little shows and entertainments, for little  folks to see,\" went on the poodle doggie. \"I can turn flip-flops, and you  can stand on your head on your crutch, and sing a song, and then we'll  take up a collection. I'll pass my hat, and perhaps we may make our  fortune--who knows?\"    \"Who, indeed?\" said Uncle Wiggily. \"We'll do it.\"    So off they started together to give a little show, and make some money,  and, as they went on through the woods, they practised doing the tricks  Uncle Wiggily had learned.    Well, in a little while, not so very long, they came to a nice place in  the forest--an open place where no trees grew.    \"Here is a good spot for our show,\" said Uncle Wiggily.    \"But there is no one to see us do the tricks,\" objected Fido.    \"Oh, yes, there are some ants, and an angle worm, and a black bug and a  grasshopper,\" said Uncle Wiggily. \"They will do to start on, and after  they see us do the tricks they'll tell other folks, and we'll have quite a  crowd.\"    So they started in to do their tricks. Fido turned a lot of flip-flops,  and Uncle Wiggily did a dance on the end of his crutch, and sang a song  about a monkey-doodle, which the angle worm said was just fine, being  quite cute, and the grasshopper made believe play a fiddle with his two  hind legs, scratching one on the other, and making lovely music.    But, all of a sudden, just as Uncle Wiggily was standing on his left ear,  and wiggling his feet in the air, which is a very hard trick for a rabbit,  what should happen but that out of the woods sprang two boys.    \"There's the dog! Grab him!\" cried one boy. \"Never mind about the rabbit!  Get the trick dog!\" And the boys rushed right up, knocking Uncle Wiggily  down, and grabbing Fido Flip-Flop. And they started off through the woods  with him, while Uncle Wiggily cried out for them to come back. But they  wouldn't.    Now please don't feel badly, for I'm going to tell you in the next story  how Uncle Wiggily saved Fido, and also how the rabbit went to Arabella  Chick's surprise party--that is I will if our automobile doesn't turn  upside down, and break my ice cream cone.          STORY VI    UNCLE WIGGILY AT THE PARTY      Well, when Uncle Wiggily Longears found that the elephant wouldn't get off  his trunk--oh, listen to me! What I meant to say was, that when Uncle  Wiggily saw those two boys running off with Fido Flip-Flop, the little  trick dog, as I told you about in the story before this, the old gentleman  rabbit was so surprised at first that he didn't know what to do.    \"Won't you please come back with that little doggie?\" begged Uncle  Wiggily, but the bad boys kept right on. I guess they knew how smart Fido  was, and they wanted to get up a show with him. Anyhow, they kept on  running through the woods, holding him tightly in their arms.    \"Oh, dear! This is terrible!\" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. \"I'll never get any  good fortune if Fido has such bad luck. And it was partly my fault, too,  for if we hadn't been doing tricks, we would have heard these boys coming,  and could have run away. Well, now I must save Fido.\"    So Uncle Wiggily sat down on a stump, and thought, and thought, and  thought of all the plans he could think of, to save the doggie from the  two boys, and at last he decided the only way to do was to scare them.    \"Then they'll drop Fido, and run away,\" said the old gentleman rabbit.  \"Let me see, how can I scare them? I know, I'll make believe I'm a tiger!\"    So what did that brave Uncle Wiggily do? but go to a mud hole, and with  his crutch dipped into the mud, he made himself all striped over like a  tiger that you see in a circus. Oh, he was a most ferocious sight when he  finished decorating himself! Then he hid his satchel in the bushes, and he  started off on a short cut through the woods, to get ahead of the boys.  Faster and faster through the woods went Uncle Wiggily, and he looked so  peculiarly terrifying that all the animals who saw him were scared out of  their wits, and one old blue-jay bird was so frightened that he wiggled  his tail up and down, and hid his head in a hollow tree.    Well, by and by, after a while, Uncle Wiggily got to a place in the woods  where he knew those boys, with Fido Flip-Flop, would soon come by. Then  the rabbit hid himself in the bushes, so that his long ears wouldn't show.  For he knew that if the boys saw them, they would know right away he  wasn't a tiger, no matter if he was striped like one.    In a few minutes along came the boys, and they were talking about what  they were going to do to Fido, and how they would put him in a cage, and  make him do lots of tricks. All of a sudden there was a rustling in the  bushes, and Uncle Wiggily just stuck out his head and part of his body,  laying his ears flat back where they could not be seen. But the boys could  see the mud stripes, only they didn't know they were just mud, you  understand.    \"Oh! See that!\" cried one boy.    \"Yes, it's a tigery-tiger!\" exclaimed the other boy.    \"Let's run!\" shouted both the boys together. \"The tiger will eat us up!\"    And just then Uncle Wiggily growled as loudly as he could, a real fierce  growl, and he rattled the bushes and stuck out his striped paws, and those  boys dropped Fido Flip-Flop, and ran away, as hard as they could through  the woods, leaving Fido to join "]]]
