The party crossed the garden patch and then took to the path which ran  down toward the river.    Here all was intensely dark, although it had stopped raining, and the  wind was trying its best to scatter the heavy clouds that obscured the  stars.    \"Not a thing to see,\" observed Randolph Rover. \"We may as well go  back.\"    \"Let us scatter and make a search,\" came from Dick, and his idea was  carried out. But though they tramped the locality for a good half hour  the pursuit of Arnold Baxter proved useless.    \"He is probably making good use of his time,\" was Tom's comment. \"He  knew we would be after him hot-footed, just as soon as we heard of his  being here.\"    \"I'm going to drive over to the railroad station,\" said Dick. \"He may  hang around and get aboard of the first morning train.\"    \"Take me along with you,\" said Sam, and Dick agreed. They got Aleck to  drive them and took the fastest team the stable afforded.    But at the depot all was dark and deserted, and if Arnold Baxter was  anywhere near he took good care not to show himself, nor was anything  seen of him in Oak Run later on.    \"He has left the neighborhood by some other way,\" said Randolph Rover,  and his surmise was correct.    When the boys reached home again they found their parent sitting up in  an easy-chair, with his forehead still bandaged. The blows he had  received were painful, but by no means serious, and when the doctor was  called in he said the patient would speedily recover.    \"But you had a narrow escape,\" said the doctor. \"Had you been struck a  little harder your skull might have been broken.\"    \"Well, I don't think Arnold Baxter would have cared if he had broken my  skull,\" answered Anderson Rover. \"He is a thoroughly bad man.\"    It was broad daylight before a complete examination of the house was  made, and then it was learned that Baxter had run away with some silver  knives, forks, and spoons, some gold napkin rings, a silver and gold  water pitcher, and half a dozen similar articles. From the desk he had  taken a pocketbook containing three hundred dollars in cash, and from  Anderson Rover's person his watch and chain, and a diamond stud. He  had also tried to rob the unconscious man of his diamond ring, but as  the ring would not come off had pried out the stone and taken that.    \"He is at his old tricks again,\" said Dick. \"Evidently his term in  prison has done him no good.\"    \"Guess it has made him worse,\" added Sam. \"Oh, how I would like to lay  my hands on him!\" And Tom said the same.    The authorities were notified, including the sheriff of the county, and  later still Anderson Rover hired a New York detective to take up the  case. But it was of no avail. Arnold Baxter did not show himself, and  not a trace of him was to be found anywhere.    \"I shouldn't be surprised if he disguised himself as soon as he got  away from here,\" remarked Tom. \"He could easily put on a false  mustache, and a wig would fit capitally over that almost bald pate of  his.\"    \"But where would he get the mustache and wig, Tom?\" asked Dick.    \"He may have bought them before he came here. I have heard that some  robbers prepare themselves for all sorts of emergencies. Only last week  I was reading about a fellow who went to a ball, and between the dances  went out and robbed a gentleman on the street of his watch. When he was  arrested, he tried to prove that he hadn't been outside of the ballroom  all night, and it was by the merest accident that the authorities found  out his story wasn't true.\"    \"Tom is right; some criminals are very shrewd,\" said his father. \"And I  fancy Arnold Baxter is about as slick as any of them.\"    \"Well, I hope we run across him some day,\" said Dick.    With so much to occupy their minds the days flew by swiftly, and almost  before they knew it Monday was at hand, and the three boys set out to  return once more to Putnam Hall.          CHAPTER V    ON THE WAY TO PUTNAM HALL      The idea of going back to dear old Putnam Hall, with all of its  pleasant memories, filled Tom with good humor, and he was fairly  bubbling over on the train which carried the boys to Ithaca, where they  were to take a steamer up Cayuga Lake to Cedarville, the nearest  village to the academy.    \"Makes me feel as I did the first time we went to the Hall,\" he  declared. \"Don't you remember that trip, and the fun we had with Peleg  Snuggers, the wagon man?\" and then he burst out singing:    \"Putnam Hall's the place for me!  Tra-la-lee! Tra-la-lee!  Putnam Hall's the place for me!  The best old school I know!\"    \"You'll have the conductor putting you off, the next thing you know,\"  remarked Sam.    \"Putting me off? Never!\" cried Tom. \"He knows that academy boys own  privileges that other passengers do not possess. He can't cork me up. I  defy him!\"    \"Wonder if we'll meet any of the other fellows,\" mused Dick.    He had hardly spoken when the train stopped at a junction, and two  other lads got aboard and came down the aisle. One was tall and handsome,  and the other stout and with a round, chubby face beaming with good humor.    \"Larry Colby!\" cried Dick, leaping up and grasping the tall boy's hand.  \"I'm awfully glad to meet you. Returning to the Hall, of course?\"    \"Yes,\" was the answer from the Rover boys' old chum. \"Isn't it odd that  I should be thinking of you just as we meet?\" and he shook hands.    \"Hullo, if it ton't peen dem Rofer brudders alretty,\" cried the  round-faced lad, with a twinkle in his eyes. \"I dink me you vos left  der Hall for goot, yah!\"    \"Hans Mueller!\" came from Sam. \"Then you are going back, too? I thought  you had scarlet fever?\"    \"Not much I ain't,\" said the German youth. \"I vos eat too much of dem  puckveat cakes alretty, und dot makes mine face preak owid, put I ain't  got no scarlet fefers, nein! How you vos alretty annahow?\" And he  shook hands as Larry had done.    \"I can hardly believe your story about being cast away on an island in  the Pacific,\" said Larry.    \"Your letter read like a fairy tale. If you tell the fellows they'll  think you are drawing the long bow.\"    \"Yes, Larry vos told me somedings apoud dot,\" broke in Hans. \"You vos  regular Robinson Roosters,\" he said.    \"Great Scott! Robinson Roosters!\" yelled Tom, bursting out into a fit  of laughter. \"Boys, we are discovered at last.\"    \"Well, if you are, you needn't crow over it,\" came from Larry.    \"Roosters and crowing! Oh, Larry, I didn't think you'd begin to pun so  early,\" put in Sam.    \"He just hatched it out,\" said Tom.    \"I suppose you think that sounds chic,\" joined in Dick. And then there  was a laugh in which all but Hans Mueller joined. The German youth  looked blankly from one to another of his companions.    \"Vos dot Robinson Rooster a choke?\" he demanded. \"Of it vos let me in  by it kvick.\"    \"Oh, you couldn't climb in on a gangway and a step-ladder combined,\"  answered Tom.    \"Put vos you Robinson Roosters or vos you not Robinson Roosters?\"    \"Oh, we were Robinson Roosters right enough,\" answered Tom, when he  could control his laughter.    \"Den vot you vos giggling apout, hey?\"    \"Nothing, only it was so funny to be a Robinson Rooster and live on a  big island with nobody but lions, buffaloes, snakes, and 'cannonballs,'\"  added the fun-loving youth.    \"Cannonballs?\" queried Larry    \"That's what Aleck Pop calls 'em, Larry. He said it was a wonder the  'cannonballs' hadn't eaten us up,\" and then came another laugh, during  which Hans was as mute as ever.    \"Vos dere lions, snakes, and buffaloes py dot island on?\" went on the  German youth.    \"To be sure there were, Hans. And likewise elephants, panthers, cats,  dogs, hippopotamuses, mice, elk, rats, and winged jibberjackers.\"    \"Mine gracious, Tom! Und you vosn't eaten up alretty kvick!\"    \"None of the animals troubled us, but the three-horned jibberjacker. He  came into our house one night, crawled upstairs, and began to swallow  Sam alive.\"    \"You ton't tole me!\"    \"Yes, I do tell you. He had Sam in his mouth, and had swallowed him as  far as his waist, when Sam began to kick on the floor with his feet.\"    \"I see, I see--\" Hans' eyes were as big as saucers.    \"That woke Dick and me up, and we ran and got Sam by the legs, and  pulled for all we were worth.\"    \"You ton't tole me, Tom! Und vot did dot vot-you-call-him do den?\"    \"He planked his ten feet on the floor, and--\"    \"His ten feet did you said, Tom?\" interrupted Hans doubtfully.    \"To be sure. Didn't you know that a real jibberjacker has ten feet?\"    \"Maype I did--I ton't oxactly remember about him.\"    \"I am surprised at your ignorance of natural history, Hans. Yes, the  real jibberjacker has ten feet, although a branch of the family, known  as the jibbertwister, has only eight feet.\"    \"Well, go on. He planked his ten feets by der floor town--\"    \"He held on and so did we, and it was a regular tug of war between us.  Sam was swallowed as far as the waist, and couldn't do anything to help  himself. You just ask Sam if that isn't so.\"    \"When Tom tells the truth it's a fact every time, Hans,\" answered Sam,  who felt as if he would choke from suppressed laughter.    \"So the blamed old jibberjacker held on and held on,\" continued Tom.  \"Then we gave a tug and he gave a tug, and all of a sudden Sam came  out. The shock was so great it threw Dick and me clear across the room,  and through a doorway into the next room. But the poor jibberjacker  fared still worse.\"    \"How vos dot?\"    \"He flew up against the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15803"],[0,"Crime and Its Causes (#4)"],[1," years ago, the magistrates and judges are adopting a more lenient line  of action, and are inflicting shorter sentences after a conviction.  Let us for a moment consider the proposition that crime is not so  grave now as it was twenty years ago. In order to arrive at a fairly  accurate conclusion on this matter, we have only to look at the number  of offences of a serious nature reported to the police. Comparing the  number of cases of murder, attempts to murder, manslaughter, shooting  at, stabbing and wounding, and adding to these offences the crimes of  burglary, housebreaking, robbery, and arson--comparing all these cases  reported to the police for the five years 1870-1874, with offences of  a like character reported in the five years 1884-1888, we find that  the proportion of grave offences to the population was, in many cases,  as great in the latter period as in the former.[7] This shows clearly  that crime, while it is increasing in extent, is not materially  decreasing in seriousness; and the chief reason the prison population  exhibits a smaller daily average is to be found in the fact that  judges are now pronouncing shorter sentences than was the custom  twenty years ago. We are not left in the dark upon this point; the  judges themselves frequently inform the public that they have taken to  shortening the terms of imprisonment. The extent to which sentences  have been shortened within the last twenty years can easily be  ascertained by comparing the committals to prison and the daily  average of the quinquenniad 1868-72 with the committals and the daily  average of the quinquenniad 1884-88. A comparison between these two  periods shows that the length of imprisonment has decreased twenty-six  per cent. In other words, whereas a man used to receive a sentence of  twelve months' imprisonment, he now receives a sentence of nine  months; and whereas he used to get a sentence of one month, he now  gets twenty-one days. If it he a serious offence, or if the criminal  be a habitual offender, he now receives eighteen months' imprisonment,  whereas he used to receive five years' penal servitude. As far as most  judges and stipendiary magistrates are concerned, sentences of  imprisonment have decreased in recent years more than twenty-six per  cent.; and if there was a corresponding movement on the part of  Chairmen of Quarter Sessions, the average decrease in the length of  sentences would amount to fifty per cent. But it is a notorious fact  that amateur judges are, with few exceptions, more inclined to  pronounce heavy sentences than professional men.

The decrease in      shooting, stabbing, wounding, &c., is very small. (Cf. _Judicial      Statistics_ for 1874 and 1888, p. xvi.)    We have now arrived at the conclusion that crime is just as serious in  its character as it was twenty years ago, and that it is growing in  dimensions year by year; the next point to be considered is, the  relation in which crime stands to the population. Crime may be  increasing, but the population may be multiplying faster than the  growth of crime. Is this the condition of things in England at the  present day? We have seen that the criminal classes are increasing  much faster than the growth of population in France and the United  States. Is England in a better position in this respect than these two  countries? At the present time there is one conviction to about every  fifty inhabitants, and the proportion of convictions to the population  was very much the same twenty years ago. If we remember the immense  development that has taken place in the industrial school system  within the last twenty years--a development that has undoubtedly had a  great deal to do with keeping down crime--we arrive at the conclusion  that, notwithstanding the beneficent effects of Industrial Schools,  the criminal classes in this country still keep pace with the annual  growth of population. If we had no Industrial and Reformatory  institutions for the detention of criminal and quasi-criminal  offenders among the young, there can be no doubt that England, as well  as other countries, would have to make the lamentable admission that  crime was not only increasing in her midst, but that it was increasing  faster than the growth of population. The number of juveniles in these  institutions has more than trebled since 1868,[8] and it is  unquestionable that if these youthful offenders were not confined  there, a large proportion of them would immediately begin to swell the  ranks of crime. That crime in England is not making more rapid strides  than the growth of population, is almost entirely to be attributed to  the action of these schools.        [8] See Appendix II.    We shall now look at another aspect of the criminal question, and that  is its cost. Crime is not merely a danger to the community; it is  likewise a vast expense; and there is no country in Europe where it  does not constitute a tremendous drain upon the national resources.  Owing to the federal system of government in America, it is almost  impossible to estimate how much is spent in the prevention and  punishment of crime in the United States, but Mr. Wines calculates  that the police force alone costs the country fifteen million dollars  annually.[9] In the United Kingdom the cost of criminal justice and  administration is continually on the increase, and it has never been  so high as it is at the present time. In the Estimates for the year  1891 the cost of Prisons and of the Asylum for criminal lunatics falls  little short of a million sterling. Reformatory and Industrial Schools  for juvenile offenders cost considerably over half-a-million, and the  expenditure on the Police force is over five and a half millions  annually. Add to these figures the cost of criminal prosecutions, the  salaries of stipendiary and other paid magistrates, a portion of the  salaries of judges, and all other expenses connected with the trial  and prosecution of delinquents, and an annual total of expenditure is  reached for the United Kingdom of more than seven and a half millions  sterling. In addition to this enormous sum, it has also to he  remembered that a great loss of property is annually entailed on the  inhabitants of the three kingdoms by the depredations of the criminal  classes. The exact amount of this loss it is impossible to estimate,  but, according to the figures in the police reports, it cannot fall  short of a million sterling per annum.        [9] _American Prisons_, 1888.    These formidable figures afford ample food for reflection. Apart from  its danger to the community, the annual loss of money which the  existence of crime entails is a most serious consideration. It is  equal to a tenth of the national expenditure, and every few years  amounts to as much as the cost of a big European war. It is tempting  to speculate on the admirable uses to which the capital consumed by  crime might be devoted, if it were free for beneficent purposes. How  easy it would be for many a scheme, which is now in the region of  dreamland, to be immediately realised. Unhappily, it is almost as vain  to look forward to the abolition of crime as it is to look forward to  the cessation of war. At the present moment the latter event, however  improbable, is more likely to happen than the former. War has ceased  to be a normal condition of things in the comity of nations; it has  become a transitory incident; but crime, which means war within the  nation, is still far from being a passing incident; on the contrary, a  conflict between the forces of moral order and social anarchy is going  on continually; and, at present, there is not the faintest prospect of  its coming to an end.    What is the cause of this state of warfare within society? Which of the  combatants is to blame? Or is the blame to be laid equally on the  shoulders of both? In other words, are the conditions in which men live  together in society of such a nature that crime is certain to flow from  them; and is crime simply a reaction against the iniquity of existing  social arrangements? Or, on the other hand, does crime spring from the  individual and his cosmical surroundings; and is it the product of  forces over which society has little or no control? These are questions  which cannot be answered off-hand, they involve considerations of a  most complicated character, and it is only after a careful examination  of all the factors responsible for crime that a true solution can  possibly be arrived at. These factors are divisible into three great  categories--cosmical, social, and individual.[10] The cosmical factors  of crime are climate and the variations of temperature; the social  factors are the political, economic and moral conditions in the midst  of which man lives as a member of society; the individual factors are a  class of attributes inherent in the individual, such as descent, sex,  age, bodily and mental characteristics. These factors, it will be seen,  can easily be reduced to two, the organism and its environment; but it  will be more convenient to"]]]
