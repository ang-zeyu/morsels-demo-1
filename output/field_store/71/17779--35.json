The first acts of the new government lie in these honorable paths.  The policy of cruel rapine and extermination that so long shocked the  universal sentiment of humanity has been reversed. Under the new  military commander a broad clemency is proffered. Measures have already  been set on foot to relieve the horrors of starvation. The power of the  Spanish armies, it is asserted, is to be used not to spread ruin and  desolation, but to protect the resumption of peaceful agricultural  pursuits and productive industries. That past methods are futile to  force a peace by subjugation is freely admitted, and that ruin without  conciliation must inevitably fail to win for Spain the fidelity of a  contented dependency.    Decrees in application of the foreshadowed reforms have already been  promulgated. The full text of these decrees has not been received, but  as furnished in a telegraphic summary from our minister are: All civil  and electoral rights of peninsular Spaniards are, in virtue of existing  constitutional authority, forthwith extended to colonial Spaniards. A  scheme of autonomy has been proclaimed by decree, to become effective  upon ratification by the Cortes. It creates a Cuban parliament, which,  with the insular executive, can consider and vote upon all subjects  affecting local order and interests, possessing unlimited powers save as  to matters of state, war, and the navy, as to which the Governor-General  acts by his own authority as the delegate of the central Government.  This parliament receives the oath of the Governor-General to preserve  faithfully the liberties and privileges of the colony, and to it the  colonial secretaries are responsible. It has the right to propose to the  central Government, through the Governor-General, modifications of the  national charter and to invite new projects of law or executive measures  in the interest of the colony.    Besides its local powers, it is competent, first, to regulate electoral  registration and procedure and prescribe the qualifications of electors  and the manner of exercising suffrage; second, to organize courts of  justice with native judges from members of the local bar; third, to  frame the insular budget, both as to expenditures and revenues, without  limitation of any kind, and to set apart the revenues to meet the Cuban  share of the national budget, which latter will be voted by the national  Cortes with the assistance of Cuban senators and deputies; fourth, to  initiate or take part in the negotiations of the national Government for  commercial treaties which may affect Cuban interests; fifth, to accept  or reject commercial treaties which the national Government may have  concluded without the participation of the Cuban government; sixth,  to frame the colonial tariff, acting in accord with the peninsular  Government in scheduling articles of mutual commerce between the mother  country and the colonies. Before introducing or voting upon a bill the  Cuban government or the chambers will lay the project before the central  Government and hear its opinion thereon, all the correspondence in such  regard being made public. Finally, all conflicts of jurisdiction arising  between the different municipal, provincial, and insular assemblies, or  between the latter and the insular executive power, and which from their  nature may not be referable to the central Government for decision,  shall be submitted to the courts.    That the government of Sagasta has entered upon a course from which  recession with honor is impossible can hardly be questioned; that in  the few weeks it has existed it has made earnest of the sincerity of its  professions is undeniable. I shall not impugn its sincerity, nor should  impatience be suffered to embarrass it in the task it has undertaken.  It is honestly due to Spain and to our friendly relations with Spain  that she should be given a reasonable chance to realize her expectations  and to prove the asserted efficacy of the new order of things to which  she stands irrevocably committed. She has recalled the commander whose  brutal orders inflamed the American mind and shocked the civilized  world. She has modified the horrible order of concentration and has  undertaken to care for the helpless and permit those who desire to  resume the cultivation of their fields to do so, and assures them of the  protection of the Spanish Government in their lawful occupations. She  has just released the _Competitor_ prisoners, heretofore sentenced  to death, and who have been the subject of repeated diplomatic  correspondence during both this and the preceding Administration.    Not a single American citizen is now in arrest or confinement in Cuba of  whom this Government has any knowledge. The near future will demonstrate  whether the indispensable condition of a righteous peace, just alike to  the Cubans and to Spain, as well as equitable to all our interests so  intimately involved in the welfare of Cuba, is likely to be attained. If  not, the exigency of further and other action by the United States will  remain to be taken. When that time comes, that action will be determined  in the line of indisputable right and duty. It will be faced, without  misgiving or hesitancy, in the light of the obligation this Government  owes to itself, to the people who have confided to it the protection of  their interests and honor, and to humanity.    Sure of the right, keeping free from all offense ourselves, actuated  only by upright and patriotic considerations, moved neither by passion  nor selfishness, the Government will continue its watchful care over  the rights and property of American citizens and will abate none of  its efforts to bring about by peaceful agencies a peace which shall  be honorable and enduring. If it shall hereafter appear to be a duty  imposed by our obligations to ourselves, to civilization, and humanity  to intervene with force, it shall be without fault on our part and only  because the necessity for such action will be so clear as to command the  support and approval of the civilized world.           *       *       *       *       *    WILLIAM McKINLEY.      JOINT RESOLUTION appropriating $50,000 for the relief of destitute  citizens of the United States in the island of Cuba.    _Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United  States of America in Congress assembled_, That the sum of $50,000 be,  and the same is hereby, appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury  not otherwise appropriated, for the relief of destitute citizens of the  United States in the island of Cuba, said money to be expended at the  discretion and under the direction of the President of the United States  in the purchase and furnishing of food, clothing, and medicines to such  citizens, and for transporting to the United States such of them as so  desire and who are without means to transport themselves.    Approved, May 24, 1897.    [Footnote 1: See p. 127.]    [Footnote 2: See p. 136.]    [Footnote 3: See Vol. VII, pp. 64-69.]          SPECIAL MESSAGES.    EXECUTIVE MANSION, _March 28, 1898._    _To the Congress of the United States_:    For some time prior to the visit of the _Maine_ to Havana Harbor  our consular representatives pointed out the advantages to flow from the  visit of national ships to the Cuban waters, in accustoming the people  to the presence of our flag as the symbol of good will and of our ships  in the fulfillment of the mission of protection to American interests,  even though no immediate need therefor might exist.    Accordingly, on the 24th of January last, after conference with the  Spanish minister, in which the renewal of visits of our war vessels to  Spanish waters was discussed and accepted, the peninsular authorities at  Madrid and Havana were advised of the purpose of this Government to  resume friendly naval visits at Cuban ports, and that in that view the  _Maine_ would forthwith call at the port of Havana.    This announcement was received by the Spanish Government with  appreciation of the friendly character of the visit of the _Maine_  and with notification of intention to return the courtesy by sending  Spanish ships to the principal ports of the United States. Meanwhile the  _Maine_ entered the port of Havana on the 25th of January, her  arrival being marked with no special incident besides the exchange of  customary salutes and ceremonial visits.    The _Maine_ continued in the harbor of Havana during the three  weeks following her arrival. No appreciable excitement attended her  stay. On the contrary, a feeling of relief and confidence followed the  resumption of the long-interrupted friendly intercourse. So noticeable  was this immediate effect of her visit that the consul-general strongly  urged that the presence of our ships in Cuban waters should be kept up  by retaining the _Maine_ at Havana, or, in the event of her recall,  by sending another vessel there to take her place.    At forty minutes past 9 in the evening of the 15th of February the  _Maine_ was destroyed by an explosion, by which the entire forward  part of the ship was utterly wrecked. In this catastrophe 2 officers and  264 of her crew perished, those who were not killed outright by her  explosion being penned between decks by the tangle of wreckage and  drowned by the immediate sinking of the hull.    Prompt assistance was rendered by the neighboring vessels anchored in  the harbor, aid being especially given by the boats of the Spanish  cruiser _Alfonso XII_ and the Ward Line steamer _City of Washington_,  which lay not far distant. The wounded were generously cared for by  the authorities of Havana, the hospitals being freely opened to them,  while the earliest recovered bodies of the dead were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/139"],[0,"The Lost World (#4)"],[1,"out from what proved to be the dining-room door.  She was a bright,  vivacious, dark-eyed lady, more French than English in her type.    \"One moment,\" she said.  \"You can wait, Austin.  Step in here, sir.  May I ask if you have met my husband before?\"    \"No, madam, I have not had the honor.\"    \"Then I apologize to you in advance.  I must tell you that he is a  perfectly impossible person--absolutely impossible.  If you are  forewarned you will be the more ready to make allowances.\"    \"It is most considerate of you, madam.\"    \"Get quickly out of the room if he seems inclined to be violent.  Don't  wait to argue with him.  Several people have been injured through doing  that.  Afterwards there is a public scandal and it reflects upon me and  all of us.  I suppose it wasn't about South America you wanted to see  him?\"    I could not lie to a lady.    \"Dear me!  That is his most dangerous subject.  You won't believe a  word he says--I'm sure I don't wonder.  But don't tell him so, for it  makes him very violent.  Pretend to believe him, and you may get  through all right.  Remember he believes it himself.  Of that you may  be assured.  A more honest man never lived.  Don't wait any longer or  he may suspect.  If you find him dangerous--really dangerous--ring the  bell and hold him off until I come.  Even at his worst I can usually  control him.\"    With these encouraging words the lady handed me over to the taciturn  Austin, who had waited like a bronze statue of discretion during our  short interview, and I was conducted to the end of the passage.  There  was a tap at a door, a bull's bellow from within, and I was face to  face with the Professor.    He sat in a rotating chair behind a broad table, which was covered with  books, maps, and diagrams.  As I entered, his seat spun round to face  me.  His appearance made me gasp.  I was prepared for something  strange, but not for so overpowering a personality as this.  It was his  size which took one's breath away--his size and his imposing presence.  His head was enormous, the largest I have ever seen upon a human being.  I am sure that his top-hat, had I ever ventured to don it, would have  slipped over me entirely and rested on my shoulders.  He had the face  and beard which I associate with an Assyrian bull; the former florid,  the latter so black as almost to have a suspicion of blue, spade-shaped  and rippling down over his chest.  The hair was peculiar, plastered  down in front in a long, curving wisp over his massive forehead.  The  eyes were blue-gray under great black tufts, very clear, very critical,  and very masterful.  A huge spread of shoulders and a chest like a  barrel were the other parts of him which appeared above the table, save  for two enormous hands covered with long black hair.  This and a  bellowing, roaring, rumbling voice made up my first impression of the  notorious Professor Challenger.    \"Well?\" said he, with a most insolent stare.  \"What now?\"    I must keep up my deception for at least a little time longer,  otherwise here was evidently an end of the interview.    \"You were good enough to give me an appointment, sir,\" said I, humbly,  producing his envelope.    He took my letter from his desk and laid it out before him.    \"Oh, you are the young person who cannot understand plain English, are  you?  My general conclusions you are good enough to approve, as I  understand?\"    \"Entirely, sir--entirely!\"  I was very emphatic.    \"Dear me!  That strengthens my position very much, does it not?  Your  age and appearance make your support doubly valuable.  Well, at least  you are better than that herd of swine in Vienna, whose gregarious  grunt is, however, not more offensive than the isolated effort of the  British hog.\"  He glared at me as the present representative of the  beast.    \"They seem to have behaved abominably,\" said I.    \"I assure you that I can fight my own battles, and that I have no  possible need of your sympathy.  Put me alone, sir, and with my back to  the wall.  G. E. C. is happiest then.  Well, sir, let us do what we can  to curtail this visit, which can hardly be agreeable to you, and is  inexpressibly irksome to me.  You had, as I have been led to believe,  some comments to make upon the proposition which I advanced in my  thesis.\"    There was a brutal directness about his methods which made evasion  difficult.  I must still make play and wait for a better opening.  It  had seemed simple enough at a distance.  Oh, my Irish wits, could they  not help me now, when I needed help so sorely?  He transfixed me with  two sharp, steely eyes.  \"Come, come!\" he rumbled.    \"I am, of course, a mere student,\" said I, with a fatuous smile,  \"hardly more, I might say, than an earnest inquirer.  At the same time,  it seemed to me that you were a little severe upon Weissmann in this  matter.  Has not the general evidence since that date tended to--well,  to strengthen his position?\"    \"What evidence?\"  He spoke with a menacing calm.    \"Well, of course, I am aware that there is not any what you might call  DEFINITE evidence.  I alluded merely to the trend of modern thought and  the general scientific point of view, if I might so express it.\"    He leaned forward with great earnestness.    \"I suppose you are aware,\" said he, checking off points upon his  fingers, \"that the cranial index is a constant factor?\"    \"Naturally,\" said I.    \"And that telegony is still sub judice?\"    \"Undoubtedly.\"    \"And that the germ plasm is different from the parthenogenetic egg?\"    \"Why, surely!\" I cried, and gloried in my own audacity.    \"But what does that prove?\" he asked, in a gentle, persuasive voice.    \"Ah, what indeed?\" I murmured.  \"What does it prove?\"    \"Shall I tell you?\" he cooed.    \"Pray do.\"    \"It proves,\" he roared, with a sudden blast of fury, \"that you are the  damnedest imposter in London--a vile, crawling journalist, who has no  more science than he has decency in his composition!\"    He had sprung to his feet with a mad rage in his eyes.  Even at that  moment of tension I found time for amazement at the discovery that he  was quite a short man, his head not higher than my shoulder--a stunted  Hercules whose tremendous vitality had all run to depth, breadth, and  brain.    \"Gibberish!\" he cried, leaning forward, with his fingers on the table  and his face projecting.  \"That's what I have been talking to you,  sir--scientific gibberish!  Did you think you could match cunning with  me--you with your walnut of a brain?  You think you are omnipotent, you  infernal scribblers, don't you?  That your praise can make a man and  your blame can break him?  We must all bow to you, and try to get a  favorable word, must we?  This man shall have a leg up, and this man  shall have a dressing down!  Creeping vermin, I know you!  You've got  out of your station.  Time was when your ears were clipped.  You've  lost your sense of proportion.  Swollen gas-bags!  I'll keep you in  your proper place.  Yes, sir, you haven't got over G. E. C.  There's  one man who is still your master.  He warned you off, but if you WILL  come, by the Lord you do it at your own risk.  Forfeit, my good Mr.  Malone, I claim forfeit!  You have played a rather dangerous game, and  it strikes me that you have lost it.\"    \"Look here, sir,\" said I, backing to the door and opening it; \"you can  be as abusive as you like.  But there is a limit.  You shall not  assault me.\"    \"Shall I not?\"  He was slowly advancing in a peculiarly menacing way,  but he stopped now and put his big hands into the side-pockets of a  rather boyish short jacket which he wore.  \"I have thrown several of  you out of the house.  You will be the fourth or fifth.  Three pound  fifteen each--that is how it averaged.  Expensive, but very necessary.  Now, sir, why should you not follow your brethren?  I rather think you  must.\"  He resumed his unpleasant and stealthy advance, pointing his  toes as he walked, like a dancing master.    I could have bolted for the hall door, but it would have been too  ignominious.  Besides, a little glow of righteous anger was springing  up within me.  I had been hopelessly in the wrong before, but this  man's menaces were putting me in the right.    \"I'll trouble you to keep your hands off, sir.  I'll not stand it.\"    \"Dear me!\"  His black moustache lifted and a white fang twinkled in a  sneer.  \"You won't stand it, eh?\"    \"Don't be such a fool, Professor!\" I cried.  \"What can you hope for?  I'm fifteen stone, as hard as nails, and play center three-quarter  every Saturday for the London Irish.  I'm not the man----\"    It was at that moment that he rushed me.  It was lucky that I had  opened the door, or we should have gone through it.  We did a  Catharine-wheel together down the passage.  Somehow we gathered up a  chair upon our way, and bounded on with it towards the street.  My  mouth was full of  his beard, our arms were locked, our bodies  intertwined, and that infernal chair radiated its legs all round us.  The watchful Austin had thrown open the hall door.  We went with a back  somersault down the front steps.  I have seen the two Macs attempt  something of the kind at the halls, but it appears to take some  practise to do it without hurting oneself.  The chair went to matchwood  at the bottom, and we rolled apart into the gutter.  He sprang to his  feet, waving his fists and wheezing like an asthmatic.    \"Had enough?\" he panted.    \"You infernal bully!\" I cried, as I gathered myself together.    Then and there we should have tried the thing out, for he was  effervescing with fight, but fortunately I was rescued from an odious  situation.  A policeman was beside us, his notebook in his hand.    \"What's all this?  You ought to be ashamed\" said the policeman.  It was  the most rational remark which I had heard in Enmore Park.  \"Well,\" he  insisted, turning to me, \"what is it, then?\"    \"This man attacked me,\" said I.    \"Did you attack him?\""]]]
