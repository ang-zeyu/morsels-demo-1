Gounod had conducted the  Funeral March of a Marionnette; Reyer, his beautiful overture to  Siguar; Saint Saens, the Danse Macabre and a Reverie Orientale;  Massenet, an unpublished Hungarian march; Guiraud, his Carnaval;  Delibes, the Valse Lente from Sylvia and the Pizzicati from Coppelia.  Mlle. Krauss had sung the bolero in the Vespri Siciliani; and Mlle.  Denise Bloch the drinking song in Lucrezia Borgia.    But the real triumph was reserved for Christine Daae, who had begun by  singing a few passages from Romeo and Juliet.  It was the first time  that the young artist sang in this work of Gounod, which had not been  transferred to the Opera and which was revived at the Opera Comique  after it had been produced at the old Theatre Lyrique by Mme. Carvalho.  Those who heard her say that her voice, in these passages, was  seraphic; but this was nothing to the superhuman notes that she gave  forth in the prison scene and the final trio in FAUST, which she sang  in the place of La Carlotta, who was ill.  No one had ever heard or  seen anything like it.    Daae revealed a new Margarita that night, a Margarita of a splendor, a  radiance hitherto unsuspected.  The whole house went mad, rising to its  feet, shouting, cheering, clapping, while Christine sobbed and fainted  in the arms of her fellow-singers and had to be carried to her  dressing-room. A few subscribers, however, protested.  Why had so great  a treasure been kept from them all that time?  Till then, Christine  Daae had played a good Siebel to Carlotta's rather too splendidly  material Margarita.  And it had needed Carlotta's incomprehensible and  inexcusable absence from this gala night for the little Daae, at a  moment's warning, to show all that she could do in a part of the  program reserved for the Spanish diva!  Well, what the subscribers  wanted to know was, why had Debienne and Poligny applied to Daae, when  Carlotta was taken ill?  Did they know of her hidden genius?  And, if  they knew of it, why had they kept it hidden?  And why had she kept it  hidden?  Oddly enough, she was not known to have a professor of singing  at that moment.  She had often said she meant to practise alone for the  future.  The whole thing was a mystery.    The Comte de Chagny, standing up in his box, listened to all this  frenzy and took part in it by loudly applauding.  Philippe Georges  Marie Comte de Chagny was just forty-one years of age.  He was a great  aristocrat and a good-looking man, above middle height and with  attractive features, in spite of his hard forehead and his rather cold  eyes.  He was exquisitely polite to the women and a little haughty to  the men, who did not always forgive him for his successes in society.  He had an excellent heart and an irreproachable conscience.  On the  death of old Count Philibert, he became the head of one of the oldest  and most distinguished families in France, whose arms dated back to the  fourteenth century.  The Chagnys owned a great deal of property; and,  when the old count, who was a widower, died, it was no easy task for  Philippe to accept the management of so large an estate.  His two  sisters and his brother, Raoul, would not hear of a division and waived  their claim to their shares, leaving themselves entirely in Philippe's  hands, as though the right of primogeniture had never ceased to exist.  When the two sisters married, on the same day, they received their  portion from their brother, not as a thing rightfully belonging to  them, but as a dowry for which they thanked him.    The Comtesse de Chagny, nee de Moerogis de La Martyniere, had died in  giving birth to Raoul, who was born twenty years after his elder  brother.  At the time of the old count's death, Raoul was twelve years  of age.  Philippe busied himself actively with the youngster's  education.  He was admirably assisted in this work first by his sisters  and afterward by an old aunt, the widow of a naval officer, who lived  at Brest and gave young Raoul a taste for the sea.  The lad entered the  Borda training-ship, finished his course with honors and quietly made  his trip round the world.  Thanks to powerful influence, he had just  been appointed a member of the official expedition on board the Requin,  which was to be sent to the Arctic Circle in search of the survivors of  the D'Artoi's expedition, of whom nothing had been heard for three  years.  Meanwhile, he was enjoying a long furlough which would not be  over for six months; and already the dowagers of the Faubourg  Saint-Germain were pitying the handsome and apparently delicate  stripling for the hard work in store for him.    The shyness of the sailor-lad--I was almost saying his innocence--was  remarkable.  He seemed to have but just left the women's apron-strings.  As a matter of fact, petted as he was by his two sisters and his old  aunt, he had retained from this purely feminine education manners that  were almost candid and stamped with a charm that nothing had yet been  able to sully.  He was a little over twenty-one years of age and looked  eighteen.  He had a small, fair mustache, beautiful blue eyes and a  complexion like a girl's.    Philippe spoiled Raoul.  To begin with, he was very proud of him and  pleased to foresee a glorious career for his junior in the navy in  which one of their ancestors, the famous Chagny de La Roche, had held  the rank of admiral.  He took advantage of the young man's leave of  absence to show him Paris, with all its luxurious and artistic  delights.  The count considered that, at Raoul's age, it is not good to  be too good.  Philippe himself had a character that was very  well-balanced in work and pleasure alike; his demeanor was always  faultless; and he was incapable of setting his brother a bad example.  He took him with him wherever he went.  He even introduced him to the  foyer of the ballet.  I know that the count was said to be \"on terms\"  with Sorelli.  But it could hardly be reckoned as a crime for this  nobleman, a bachelor, with plenty of leisure, especially since his  sisters were settled, to come and spend an hour or two after dinner in  the company of a dancer, who, though not so very, very witty, had the  finest eyes that ever were seen!  And, besides, there are places where  a true Parisian, when he has the rank of the Comte de Chagny, is bound  to show himself; and at that time the foyer of the ballet at the Opera  was one of those places.    Lastly, Philippe would perhaps not have taken his brother behind the  scenes of the Opera if Raoul had not been the first to ask him,  repeatedly renewing his request with a gentle obstinacy which the count  remembered at a later date.    On that evening, Philippe, after applauding the Daae, turned to Raoul  and saw that he was quite pale.    \"Don't you see,\" said Raoul, \"that the woman's fainting?\"    \"You look like fainting yourself,\" said the count.  \"What's the matter?\"    But Raoul had recovered himself and was standing up.    \"Let's go and see,\" he said, \"she never sang like that before.\"    The count gave his brother a curious smiling glance and seemed quite  pleased. They were soon at the door leading from the house to the  stage.  Numbers of subscribers were slowly making their way through.  Raoul tore his gloves without knowing what he was doing and Philippe  had much too kind a heart to laugh at him for his impatience.  But he  now understood why Raoul was absent-minded when spoken to and why he  always tried to turn every conversation to the subject of the Opera.    They reached the stage and pushed through the crowd of gentlemen,  scene-shifters, supers and chorus-girls, Raoul leading the way, feeling  that his heart no longer belonged to him, his face set with passion,  while Count Philippe followed him with difficulty and continued to  smile.  At the back of the stage, Raoul had to stop before the inrush  of the little troop of ballet-girls who blocked the passage which he  was trying to enter.  More than one chaffing phrase darted from little  made-up lips, to which he did not reply; and at last he was able to  pass, and dived into the semi-darkness of a corridor ringing with the  name of \"Daae!  Daae!\"  The count was surprised to find that Raoul knew  the way.  He had never taken him to Christine's himself and came to the  conclusion that Raoul must have gone there alone while the count stayed  talking in the foyer with Sorelli, who often asked him to wait until it  was her time to \"go on\" and sometimes handed him the little gaiters in  which she ran down from her dressing-room to preserve the spotlessness  of her satin dancing-shoes and her flesh-colored tights.  Sorelli had  an excuse; she had lost her mother.    Postponing his usual visit to Sorelli for a few minutes, the count  followed his brother down the passage that led to Daae's dressing-room  and saw that it had never been so crammed as on that evening, when the  whole house seemed excited by her success and also by her fainting fit.  For the girl had not yet come to; and the doctor of the theater had  just arrived at the moment when Raoul entered at his heels.  Christine,  therefore, received the first aid of the one, while opening her eyes in  the arms of the other.  The count and many more remained crowding in  the doorway.    \"Don't you think, Doctor, that those gentlemen had better clear the  room?\" asked Raoul coolly.  \"There's no breathing here.\"    \"You're quite right,\" said the doctor.    And he sent every one away, except Raoul and the maid, who looked at  Raoul with eyes of the most undisguised astonishment.  She had never  seen him before and yet dared not question him; and the doctor imagined  that the young man was only acting as he did because he had the right  to.  The viscount, therefore, remained in the room watching Christine  as she slowly returned to life, while even the joint managers, Debienne  and Poligny, who had come to offer their sympathy and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17530"],[0,"Maida's Little Shop (#4)"],[1," they're so old, and mine are all wrong because they're so young.\"    \"All right,\" Billy agreed. \"Sunshiny one for Granny, shady one for  you. That's settled! I hope you realize, Miss Maida, Elizabeth,  Fairfax, Petronilla, Pinkwink, Posie Westabrook what perfectly bully  rooms these are! They're as old as Noah.\"    \"I'm glad they're old,\" Maida said. \"But of course they must be.  This house was here when Dr. Pierce was a little boy. And that must  have been a long, long, long time ago.\"    \"Just look at the floors,\" Billy went on admiringly. \"See how uneven  they are. You'll have to walk straight here, Petronilla, to keep  from falling down. That old wooden wainscoting is simply charming.  That's a nice old fireplace too. And these old doors are perfect.\"    Granny Flynn was working the latch of one of the old doors with her  wrinkled hands. \"Manny's the toime Oi've snibbed a latch loike that  in Oireland,\" she said, and she smiled so hard that her very  wrinkles seemed to twinkle.    \"And look at the windows, Granny,\" Billy said. \"Sixteen panes of  glass each. I hope you'll make Petronilla wash them.\"    \"Oh, Granny, will you let me wash the windows?\" Maida asked  ecstatically.    \"When you're grand and sthrong,\" Granny promised.    \"I know just how I'll furnish the room,\" Billy said half to himself.    \"Oh, Billy, tell me!\" Maida begged.    \"Can't,\" he protested mischievously. \"You've got to wait till it's  all finished before you see hide or hair of it.\"    \"I know I'll die of curiosity,\" Maida protested. \"But then of course  I shall be very busy with my own business.\"    \"Ah, yes,\" Billy replied. \"Now that you've embarked on a mercantile  career, Miss Westabrook, I think you'll find that you'll have less  and less time for the decorative side of life.\"    Billy spoke so seriously that most little girls would have been awed  by his manner. But Maida recognized the tone that he always employed  when he was joking her. Beside, his eyes were all \"skrinkled up.\"  She did not quite understand what the joke was, but she smiled back  at him.    \"Now can we look at the things downstairs?\" she pleaded.    \"Yes,\" Billy assented. \"To-day is a very important day. Behind  locked doors and sealed windows, we're going to take account of  stock.\"    Granny Flynn remained in the bedrooms to make all kinds of  mysterious measurements, to open and shut doors, to examine closets,  to try window-sashes, even to poke her head up the chimney.    Downstairs, Billy and Maida opened boxes and boxes and boxes and  drawers and drawers and drawers. Every one of these had been  carefully gone over by the conscientious Mrs. Murdock. Two boxes  bulged with toys, too broken or soiled to be of any use. These they  threw into the ash-barrel at once. What was left they dumped on the  floor. Maida and Billy sat down beside the heap and examined the  things, one by one. Maida had never seen such toys in her life--so  cheap and yet so amusing.    It was hard work to keep to business with such enchanting temptation  to play all about them. Billy insisted on spinning every top--he got  five going at once--on blowing every balloon--he produced such  dreadful wails of agony that Granny came running downstairs in great  alarm--on jumping with every jump-rope--the short ones tripped him up  and once he sprawled headlong--on playing jackstones--Maida beat him  easily at this--on playing marbles--with a piece of crayon he drew a  ring on the floor--on looking through all the books--he declared that  he was going to buy some little penny-pamphlet fairy-tales as soon  as he could save the money. But in spite of all this fooling, they  really accomplished a great deal.    They found very few eatables--candy, fruit, or the like. Mrs. Murdock  had wisely sold out this perishable stock. One glass jar, however,  was crammed full of what Billy recognized to be \"bulls-eyes\"--round  lumps of candy as big as plums and as hard as stones. Billy said  that he loved bulls-eyes better than terrapin or broiled live  lobster, that he had not tasted one since he was \"half-past ten.\"  For the rest of the day, one of his cheeks stuck out as if he had  the toothache.    They came across all kinds of odds and ends--lead pencils,  blank-books, an old slate pencil wrapped in gold paper which Billy  insisted on using to draw pictures on a slate--he made this squeak so  that Maida clapped her hands over her ears. They found single pieces  from sets of miniature furniture, a great many dolls, rag-dolls,  china dolls, celluloid dolls, the latest bisque beauties, and two  old-fashioned waxen darlings whose features had all run together  from being left in too great a heat.    They went through all these things, sorting them into heaps which  they afterwards placed in boxes. At noon, Billy went out and bought  lunch. Still squatting on the floor, the three of them ate  sandwiches and drank milk. Granny said that Maida had never eaten so  much at one meal.    All this happened on Saturday. Maida did not see the little shop  again until it was finished.    By Monday the place was as busy as a beehive. Men were putting in a  furnace, putting in a telephone, putting in a bathroom, whitening  the plaster, painting the woodwork.    Finally came two days of waiting for the paint to dry. \"Will it  ever, _ever_, EVER dry?\" Maida used to ask Billy in the most  despairing of voices.    By Thursday, the rooms were ready for their second coat of paint.    \"Oh, Billy, do tell me what color it is--I can't wait to see it,\"  Maida begged.    But, \"Sky-blue-pink\" was all she got from Billy.    Saturday the furniture came.    In the meantime, Maida had been going to all the principal wholesale  places in Boston picking out new stock. Granny Flynn accompanied her  or stayed at home, according to the way she felt, but Billy never  missed a trip.    Maida enjoyed this tremendously, although often she had to go to bed  before dark. She said it was the responsibility that tired her.    To Maida, these big wholesale places seemed like the storehouses of  Santa Claus. In reality they were great halls, lined with parallel  rows of counters. The counters were covered with boxes and the boxes  were filled with toys. Along the aisles between the counters moved  crowds of buyers, busily examining the display.    It was particularly hard for Maida to choose, because she was  limited by price. She kept recalling Mrs. Murdock's advice, \"Get as  many things as you can for a cent a-piece.\" The expensive toys  tempted her, but although she often stopped and looked them  wistfully over, she always ended by going to the cheaper counters.    \"You ought to be thinking how you'll decorate the windows for your  first day's sale,\" Billy advised her. \"You must make it look as  tempting as possible. I think, myself, it's always a good plan to  display the toys that go with the season.\"    Maida thought of this a great deal after she went to bed at night.  By the end of the week, she could see in imagination just how her  windows were going to look.    Saturday night, Billy told her that everything was ready, that she  should see the completed house Monday morning. It seemed to Maida  that the Sunday coming in between was the longest day that she had  ever known.    When she unlocked the door to the shop, the next morning, she let  out a little squeal of joy. \"Oh, I would never know it,\" she  declared. \"How much bigger it looks, and lighter and prettier!\"    Indeed, you would never have known the place yourself. The ceiling  had been whitened. The faded drab woodwork had been painted white.  The walls had been colored a beautiful soft yellow. Back of the  counter a series of shelves, glassed in by sliding doors, ran the  whole length of the wall and nearly to the ceiling. Behind the show  case stood a comfortable, cushioned swivel-chair.    \"The stuff you've been buying, Petronilla,\" Billy said, pointing to  a big pile of boxes in the corner. \"Now, while Granny and I are  putting some last touches to the rooms upstairs, you might be  arranging the window.\"    \"That's just what I planned to do,\" Maida said, bubbling with  importance. \"But you promise not to interrupt me till it's all  done.\"    \"All right,\" Billy agreed, smiling peculiarly. He continued to smile  as he opened the boxes.    It did not occur to Maida to ask them what they were going to do  upstairs. It did not occur to her even to go up there. From time to  time, she heard Granny and Billy laughing. \"One of Billy's jokes,\"  she said to herself. Once she thought she heard the chirp of a bird,  but she would not leave her work to find out what it was.    When the twelve o'clock whistle blew, she called to Granny and to  Billy to come to see the results of her morning's labor.    \"I say!\" Billy emitted a long loud whistle.    \"Oh, do you like it?\" Maida asked anxiously.    \"It's a grand piece of work, Petronilla,\" Billy said heartily.    The window certainly struck the key-note of the season. Tops of all  sizes and colors were arranged in pretty patterns in the middle.  Marbles of all kinds from the ten-for-a-cent \"peeweezers\" up to the  most beautiful, colored \"agates\" were displayed at the sides.  Jump-ropes of variegated colors with handles, brilliantly painted, were  festooned at the back. One of the window shelves had been furnished  like a tiny room. A whole family of dolls sat about on the tiny  sofas and chairs. On the other shelf lay neat piles of blank-books  and paper-blocks, with files of pens, pencils, and rubbers arranged  in a decorative pattern surrounding them all.    In the show case, fresh candies had been laid out carefully on  saucers and platters of glass. On the counter was a big, flowered  bowl.    \"To-morrow, I'm going to fill that bowl with asters,\" Maida  explained.    \"OI'm sure the choild has done foine,\" Granny Flynn said, \"Oi cudn't  have done betther mesilf.\"    \"Now come and look at your rooms, Petronilla,\" Billy begged, his  eyes"]]]
