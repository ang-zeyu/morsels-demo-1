He  has been so kind and pleasant since,\" she said, with a slight tremble in  her voice.    \"You'll find out when he comes,\" laughed Max. \"Good-night,\" and he  hastened away to his own room.    A guilty conscience made Lulu very uneasy as she hurried through her  preparations for bed, and as she heard her father's step approach the door  she grew quite frightened.    He came in and closed it after him. Lulu was standing in her night-dress,  just ready for bed. He caught up a heavy shawl, wrapped it about her, and  seating himself lifted her to his knee.    \"Why, how you are trembling!\" he exclaimed. \"What is the matter?\"    \"O papa! are you--are you going to punish me for being so naughty this  evening?\" she asked, hanging her head while her cheeks grew red.    \"That was not my intention in coming in here,\" he said. \"But, Lulu, your  wilfulness is a cause of great anxiety to me. I hardly know what to do  with you. I am very loath to burden our kind friends--Grandpa Dinsmore and  Grandma Elsie--with so rebellious and unmanageable a child, for it will be  painful to them to be severe with you, and yet I see that you will compel  them to it.\"    \"I won't be punished by anybody but you! Nobody else has a right!\" burst  out Lulu.    \"Yes, my child, I have given them the right, and the only way for you to  escape punishment is not to deserve it. And if you prove too troublesome  for them, you are to be sent to a boarding-school, and that, you will  understand, involves separation from Max and Gracie, and life among total  strangers.\"    \"Papa, you wouldn't, you couldn't be so cruel!\" she said, bursting into  tears and hiding her face on his breast.    \"I hope you will not be so cruel to yourself as to make it necessary,\" he  said. \"I have fondly hoped you were improving, but your conduct to-night  shows me that you are still a self-willed, rebellious child.\"    \"Well, papa, I've wanted a bird on my hat for ever so long, and I believe  you would have let me have it, too, if Mamma Vi and Grandma Elsie hadn't  said that.\"    \"I shouldn't let you have it, if they were both in favor of it,\" he said  severely.    \"Why, papa?\"    \"Because of the cruelty it would encourage. And now, Lucilla, I want you  to reflect how very kind it is in Grandpa Dinsmore and Grandma Elsie to be  willing to take my children in and share with them their own delightful  home. You have not the slightest claim upon their kindness, and very few  people in their case would have made such an offer. I really feel almost  ashamed to accept so much without being able to make some return, even if  I knew my children would all behave as dutifully and gratefully as  possible. And knowing how likely your conduct is to be the exact reverse  of that, I can hardly reconcile it to my conscience to let you go with  them to Ion. I am afraid I ought to place you in a boarding-school at  once, before I am ordered away.\"    \"O papa, don't!\" she begged. \"I'll try to behave better.\"    \"You must promise more than that,\" he said; \"promise me that you will  yield to the authority of your mamma and her mother and grandfather as if  it were mine; obeying their orders and submitting to any punishment they  may see fit to inflict, just as if it were my act.\"    \"Papa, have you said they might punish me?\" she asked, with a look of  wounded pride.    \"Yes; I have full confidence in their wisdom and kindness. I know they  will not abuse the authority I give them, and I have told them they may  use any measures with my children that they would with their own in the  same circumstances. Are you ready to give the promise I require?\"    \"Papa, it is too hard!\"    \"The choice is between that and being sent to boarding-school.\"    \"Oh, it's so hard!\" she sobbed.    \"Not hard at all if you choose to be good,\" her father said. \"In that case  you will have a delightful life at Ion. Do you make the promise?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" she said, as if the words were wrung from her, then hid her  face on his breast again and cried bitterly.    \"My little daughter, these are tears of pride and stubbornness,\" sighed  her father, passing his hand caressingly over her hair, \"and you will  never be happy until those evil passions are cast out of your heart. They  are foes which you must fight and conquer by the help of Him who is mighty  to save, or they will cost you the loss of your soul. Any sin unrepented  of and unforsaken will drag you down to eternal death; for the Bible says,  'Without holiness no man shall see the Lord.'\"    \"Papa,\" she said, \"you are the only person God commands me to obey, and  I'm willing to do that.\"    \"No, it seems not, when my command is that you obey some one else. My  little girl, you need something that I cannot give you; and that is a  change of heart. Go to Jesus for it, daughter; ask Him to wash away all  your sins in His precious blood and to create in you a clean heart and  renew a right spirit within you. He is able and willing to do it, for He  says, 'Him that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out.' We will kneel  down and ask Him now.\"    \"Papa, I do love you so, I love you dearly, and I _will_ try to be a  better girl,\" Lulu said, clasping her arms tightly about his neck, as,  having laid her in her bed, he bent down to kiss her good-night.    \"I hope so, my darling,\" he said; \"nothing could make me happier than to  know you to be a truly good child, trying to live right that you may  please the dear Saviour who died that you might live.\"    Max, lying in his bed, was just saying to himself, \"I wonder what keeps  papa so long,\" when he heard his step on the stairs.    \"Are you awake, Max?\" the captain asked, as he opened the door and came  in.    \"Yes, sir,\" was the cheerful response; \"it's early, you know, papa, and  I'm not at all sleepy.\"    \"That is well, for I want a little talk with you,\" said his father,  sitting down on the side of the bed and taking Max's hand in his.    The talk was on the sin of profanity. Max was told to repeat the third  commandment, then his father called his attention to the words, \"The Lord  will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain.\"    \"It is a dreadful and dangerous sin, my son,\" he said; \"a most foolish  sin, too, for there is absolutely nothing to be gained by it; and the  meanest of sins, for what can be meaner than to abuse Him to whom we owe  our being and every blessing we enjoy?\"    \"Yes, papa, and I--I've done it a good many times. Do you think God will  ever forgive me?\" Max asked in trembling tones.    \"'He that covereth his sins shall not prosper; but whoso confesseth and  forsaketh them shall have mercy.' 'I, even I, am He that blotteth out thy  transgressions, for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins,'\"  quoted the captain.    \"Yes, my son, if you are truly sorry for your sins because committed  against God, and confess them with the determination to forsake them,  asking forgiveness and help to overcome the evil of your nature, for  Jesus' sake, it will be granted you. 'The blood of Jesus Christ, His Son,  cleanseth us from all sin.'\"          CHAPTER IV.        \"No day discolored with domestic strife,       No jealousy, but mutual truth believ'd,       Secure repose and kindness undeceiv'd.\"                               --Dryden.      They were a bright and cheery company in the other house. They had divided  into groups. Mrs. Elsie Travilla sat in a low rocking-chair, between her  father and his wife, with her little grandson on her lap. She doated on  the babe, and was often to be seen with it in her arms. She was now  calling her father's attention to its beauty, and talking of the time when  its mother was an infant, her own precious darling.    On a sofa on the farther side of the room the two sisters, Elsie and  Violet, sat side by side, cosily chatting of things past and present,  while a little removed from them Lester, Edward and Zoe formed another  group.    The two gentlemen were in animated conversation, to which Zoe was a silent  and absorbed listener, especially when her husband spoke; eagerly drinking  in every word that fell from his lips; her face glowing, her eyes  sparkling with proud delight.    \"Look at Zoe; Ned certainly has one devoted admirer,\" remarked Elsie,  regarding her young sister-in-law with a pleased yet half-amused smile.    \"Yes,\" said Violet, \"he is a perfect oracle in her esteem; and I believe  everything she does is right in his eyes; indeed, their mutual devotion is  a pretty thing to see. They are scarcely ever apart.\"    \"Don't you think your husband an oracle?\" asked Elsie, with a quizzical  look.    \"So you have found that out already, have you?\" laughed Violet. \"Yes, I  do, but then he is wiser than our Ned, you know. Tell me now, don't you  admire him? don't you think him worthy of all honor?\"    \"I do, indeed, and am proud to have him for a brother-in-law,\" Elsie said  with earnest sincerity; \"but,\" she added with a smile, \"I prefer Lester  for a husband.\"    \"Yes, of course, but Levis is the best of husbands--of fathers, too.\"    \"Rather more strict and stern than ours was, is he not?\"    \"Yes, but not more so than necessary with a child of Lulu's peculiar  disposition.\"    \"Ah, Vi, I pity you for being a stepmother,\" Elsie said, with a  compassionate look at her sister.    \"You needn't,\" returned Violet quickly.    \"Lulu is the only one of the three that gives me any anxiety or trouble,  and to be Captain Raymond's wife more than compensates for that.\"    \"I suppose so. And Gracie is a dear little thing.\"    \"Yes, she's a darling. And Max is a noble fellow. I hope he will make just  such a man as his father. Don't you think he resembles the captain in  looks?\"    \"Yes, and I notice he is very chivalrous in his manner toward his young  stepmother.\"    \"Yes,\" Violet said, with a happy smile, \"and more or less to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14916"],[0,"Fairy Tales Every Child Should Know (#4)"],[1,"\" Then came Two Eyes, quite comforted, from the empty  cask, and the knight was astonished to find her so beautiful.    Then he said, \"Little Two Eyes, can you break off a branch of the tree  for me?\"    \"Oh yes,\" she replied, \"I can, very easily, for the tree belongs to me.\"  And she climbed up, and, without any trouble, broke off a branch with  its silver leaves and golden fruit and gave it to the knight.    He looked down at her as she stood by his horse, and said: \"Little Two  Eyes, what shall I give you for this?\"    \"Ah!\" she answered, \"I suffer from hunger and thirst, and sorrow, and  trouble, from early morning till late at night; if you would only take  me with you, and release me, I should be so happy.\"    Then the knight lifted the little maiden on his horse, and rode home  with her to his father's castle. There she was given beautiful clothes  to wear, and as much to eat and drink as she wished, and as she grew up  the young knight loved her so dearly that they were married with great  rejoicings.    Now, when the two sisters saw little Two Eyes carried away by the  handsome young knight, they were overjoyed at their good fortune. \"The  wonderful tree belongs to us now,\" they said; \"even if we cannot break  off a branch, yet everybody who passes will stop to admire it, and make  acquaintance with us, and, who knows? we may get husbands after all.\"    But when they rose the next morning, lo! the tree had vanished, and with  it all their hopes. And on this very morning, when little Two Eyes  looked out of her chamber window of the castle, she saw, to her great  joy, that the tree had followed her.    Little Two Eyes lived for a long time in great happiness; but she heard  nothing of her sisters, till one day two poor women came to the castle,  to beg for alms. Little Two Eyes saw them, and, looking earnestly in  their faces, she recognised her two sisters, who had become so poor that  they were obliged to beg their bread from door to door.    But the good sister received them most kindly, and promised to take care  of them and give them all they wanted. And then they did indeed repent  and feel sorry for having treated her so badly in their youthful days.          CHAPTER II    THE MAGIC MIRROR      One day in the middle of winter, when the snowflakes fell from the sky  like feathers, a queen sat at a window netting. Her netting-needle was  of black ebony, and as she worked, and the snow glittered, she pricked  her finger, and three drops of blood fell into the snow. The red spots  looked so beautiful in the white snow that the queen thought to herself:  \"Oh, if I only had a little child, I should like it to be as fair as  snow, as rosy as the red blood, and with hair and eyes as black as  ebony.\"    Very soon after this the queen had a little daughter who was very fair,  had rosy cheeks, and hair as black as ebony; and they gave her the name  of Snow-white. But at the birth of the little child the queen died.    When Snow-white was a year old, the king took another wife. She was very  handsome, but so proud and vain that she could not endure that anyone  should surpass her in beauty. She possessed a wonderful mirror, and when  she stood before it to look at herself she would say:        \"Mirror, mirror on the wall,       Am I most beautiful of all?\"    Then the mirror would reply:      \"Young queen, thou are so wondrous fair,     None can with thee at all compare.\"    Then she would go away quite contented, for she knew the magic mirror  could speak only the truth.    Years went by, and as Snow-white grew up, she became day after day more  beautiful, till she reached the age of seven years, and then people  began to talk about her, and say that she would be more lovely even than  the queen herself. So the proud woman went to her magic looking-glass,  and asked:        \"Mirror, mirror on the wall,       Am I most beautiful of all?\"    But the mirror answered:      \"Queen, thou are lovely still to see,     But Snow-white will be     A thousand times more beautiful than thee.\"    Then the queen was terrified, and turned green and yellow with jealousy.  If she had caught sight of Snow-white at that moment, she would have  been ready to tear her heart out of her body, she hated the maiden so  fiercely.    And this jealousy and envy grew every day stronger and stronger in her  heart, like a disease, till she had no rest day or night.    At last she sent for a hunter, who lived near a forest, and said to him,  \"Hunter, I want to get rid of that child. Take her out into the wood,  and if you bring me some proofs that she is dead, I will reward you  handsomely. Never let her appear before my eyes again.\"    So the hunter enticed the child into the wood; but when he took out his  hunting-knife to thrust into Snow-white's innocent heart, she fell on  her knees and wept, and said, \"Ah, dear hunter, leave me my life; I will  run away into the wild wood, and never, never come home any more.\"    She looked so innocent and beautiful as she knelt, that the hunter's  heart was moved with compassion: \"Run away, then, thou poor child,\" he  cried; \"I cannot harm thee.\"    Snow-white thanked him so sweetly, and was out of sight in a few  moments.    \"She will be devoured by wild beasts,\" he said to himself. But the  thought that he had not killed her was as if a stone-weight had been  lifted from his heart.    To satisfy the queen, he took part of the inside of a young fawn, which  the wicked woman thought was poor little Snow-white, and was overjoyed  to think she was dead.    But the poor little motherless child, when she found herself alone in  the wood, and saw nothing but trees and leaves, was dreadfully  frightened, and knew not what to do. At last she began to run over the  sharp stones and through the thorns, and though the wild beasts sprang  out before her, they did her no harm. She ran on as long as she could  till her little feet became quite sore; and towards evening she saw, to  her great joy, a pretty little house. So she went up to it, and found  the door open and no one at home.    It was a tiny little house, but everything in it was so clean and neat  and elegant that it is beyond description. In the middle of the room  stood a small table, covered with a snow-white table-cloth, ready for  supper. On it were arranged seven little plates, seven little spoons,  seven little knives and forks, and seven mugs. By the wall stood seven  little beds, near each other, covered with white quilts.    Poor Snow-white, who was hungry and thirsty, ate a few vegetables and a  little bread from each plate, and drank a little drop of wine from each  cup, for she did not like to take all she wanted from one alone. After  this, feeling very tired, she thought she would lie down and rest on one  of the beds, but she found it difficult to choose one to suit her. One  was too long, another too short; so she tried them all till she came to  the seventh, and that was so comfortable that she laid herself down, and  was soon fast asleep.    When it was quite dark the masters of the house came home. They were  seven little dwarfs, who dug and searched in the mountains for minerals.  First they lighted seven little lamps, and as soon as the room was full  of light they saw that some one had been there, for everything did not  stand in the order in which they had left it.    Then said the first, \"Who has been sitting in my little chair?\"    The second exclaimed, \"Who has been eating from my little plate?\"    The third cried, \"Some one has taken part of my bread.\"    \"Who has been eating my vegetables?\" said the fourth.    Then said the fifth, \"Some one has used my fork.\"    The sixth cried, \"And who has been cutting with my knife?\"    \"And some one has been drinking out of my cup,\" said the seventh.    Then the eldest looked at his bed, and, seeing that it looked tumbled,  cried out that some one had been upon it. The others came running  forward, and found all their beds in the same condition. But when the  seventh approached his bed, and saw Snow-white lying there fast asleep,  he called the others, who came quickly, and holding their lights over  their heads, cried out in wonder as they beheld the sleeping child. \"Oh,  what a beautiful little child!\" they said to each other, and were so  delighted that they would not awaken her, but left her to sleep as long  as she liked in the little bed, while its owner slept with one of his  companions, and so the night passed away.    In the morning, when Snow-white awoke, and saw all the dwarfs, she was  terribly frightened. But they spoke kindly to her, till she lost all  fear, and they asked her name.    \"I am called Snow-white,\" she replied.    \"But how came you to our house?\" asked one.    Then she related to them all that had happened; how her stepmother had  sent her into the wood with the hunter, who had spared her life, and  that, after wandering about for a whole day, she had found their house.    The dwarfs talked a little while together, and then one said, \"Do you  think you could be our little housekeeper, to make the beds, cook the  dinner, and wash and sew and knit for us, and keep everything neat and  clean and orderly? If you can, then you shall stay here with us, and  nobody shall hurt you.\"    \"Oh yes, I will try,\" said Snow-white. So they let her stay, and she was  a clever little thing. She managed very well, and kept the house quite  clean and in order. And while they were gone to the mountains to find  gold, she got their supper ready, and they were very happy together.    But every morning when they left her, the kind little dwarfs warned  Snow-white to be careful. While the maiden was alone they knew she was  in danger, and told her not to show herself, for her stepmother would  soon find out where she was, and said, \"Whatever you do, let nobody into  the house while we are gone.\"    After the wicked queen had proved, as she thought, that Snow-white was  dead, she"]]]
