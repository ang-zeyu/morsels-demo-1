RUSSIA.--In 1914 Russia was an empire occupying one seventh of the  land area of the world and inhabited by about 180,000,000 people. During  the nineteenth century the country was ruled by absolute monarchs called  czars, under whom political and social conditions were corrupt and  oppressive. However, some progress was made during the century. Serfdom  or slavery was abolished from 1861 to 1866; restraints upon newspapers,  publishers, and schools were partly withdrawn. Natural resources were  developed, factories established, and railroads built. But these  measures only served to whet the appetite of the people for more liberal  government. The activities of revolutionists and reformers were met by  most severe measures on the part of the government. Thousands were  transported to Siberia and many were executed. Even as late as 1903  five thousand persons were imprisoned, exiled, or executed for political  activity against the Czar's government. An attempt of the people to  force a representative government upon the Czar failed after a seeming  success in 1905-1906; for the Duma, or legislative assembly, then  created was given little power.    Russia has not been fortunate in her relations with the neighboring  states. Her great ambition, the occupation of Constantinople, was  repeatedly balked by other countries. In an attempt to obtain an  ice-free harbor on the Pacific, Russia brought on the Russo-Japanese War  of 1904-1905, in which she was disastrously defeated. In another  direction Russia was more successful. She posed as the protector of the  Slavic provinces under Turkish rule and saw the day when nearly all of  them were free.    Russia is a country of vast territory, enormous population, and  unbounded natural resources. But before the war it had no experience in  self-government. Its land and mineral resources were not used for  national purposes. A small governing class, with the Czar at the head,  controlled its tremendous powers and wealth. Naturally, when an  insurrection is successful against such a government, the people lose  all self-control and go to great extremes. Liberty and self-government  succeed only when all the people are willing to abide by the laws made  by the majority. May this time soon come for Russia!        SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY.--1.

CHAPTER II    WHY GERMANY WANTED WAR      It would be impossible to make a list of all the causes which led  Germany from time to time to take such action as would tend to force war  on one or another of the nations of Europe. For besides questions of  national honor or of national rights there were the writings of German  philosophers, historians, and scientists, a great majority of whom  maintained that war was a necessity if men were to continue to live in  large groups or societies. These writers were chiefly Prussian, but  Prussia, including more than half of Germany, dominated the rest of the  empire through the organization of its government. The following  paragraphs present what seem to be the chief reasons why Germany, and  especially Prussia, wanted war.    WAR AS A PROFITABLE BUSINESS.--According to those German writers there  are two results from a successful war. First, the victors take more or  less territory from the vanquished; second, the victors may demand a  large sum of money, called an indemnity, from the defeated people, who  thus have to pay their conquerors for having taken the trouble to defeat  them.    In both of these instances the result is advantageous to the winner of  the war, and particularly to the governing class of that nation. Through  the taxes from the new territory more money flows into the national  treasury, and a great many new officials must be appointed. These, of  course, for many years are appointed by the rulers of the victorious  nation. Besides this not only do we find new markets opened up for the  manufacturers and merchants, but the conquered territory frequently  contains great stores of raw materials. In both cases the goods can now  pass to and fro without the drawbacks of possible embargoes or import  taxes which interfere with the freedom of trade. This is well  illustrated by the results of the seizure of part of Lorraine by Germany  from France in 1870. Lorraine contains great stores of coal and iron  ore. These Germany wanted. So that part of Lorraine was demanded which  would give to Germany rich mines of coal and iron. Some other ore  deposits, which could not be easily utilized, she left to France. Not  long afterwards a new process for making iron was discovered which made  the French deposits more valuable than those Germany had taken.  Undoubtedly one of the reasons for the present war was that Germany  wished to increase her national wealth by seizing the iron mines that  had become so valuable.    Many times before 1870 the Prussians had made large gains, in the way of  increased territory and prestige, by means of war. It was the boast of  many Prussian kings that each one of them had added to the lands over  which he ruled. In almost every instance this increase was due to a  successful war, enabling the king of Prussia to seize territory which  did not belong to him.    The indemnity which may be collected from a conquered nation is also a  source of profit to the conqueror. The money is deposited by the  government in banks, which thus have large sums ready to lend to  manufacturers and merchants who wish to increase their business. The  result of this is a great stimulation of manufactures and commerce. In  the case of Germany, the effect on industry of the $1,000,000,000 of  indemnity which she received from France following the Franco-Prussian  war was so great that Germany was soon manufacturing more than her  people could consume, and German commercial agents spread all over the  globe seeking to find profitable customers for the surplus.    On the other hand, the German leaders have failed to realize that the  destruction of men and materials in war is always a great national loss.  In the case of a long war, the losses from these causes may, even for  the victors, overbalance any advantage which may be secured in the way  of territory or money from the vanquished nation.    GERMANY WANTED LAND FROM HER NEIGHBORS.--The present war was largely  the result of Germany's desire to secure territory. The territory that  was particularly wanted was in a number of different places.    In the first place, Germany coveted the rest of the iron mines which she  had made the mistake (from her point of view) of letting France keep in  1870. These are located along the northeast frontier of France, about  half a dozen miles from the boundary. Germany wanted also the greater  part of Belgium, because it has valuable iron ore deposits, and  especially because it has great deposits of coal. It has been said that  without these mines of Belgian coal and of French iron, which Germany  seized at the very beginning of the war, she would soon have had to give  up the fight.    In the second place, Germany's only ports are on the shallow north  coast, and the channels are intricate and difficult of navigation. These  ports are inconveniently situated for exports from Germany's chief  manufacturing region, the lower Rhine valley. The best ports for western  Germany are Antwerp, in Belgium, and Rotterdam, in Holland. Germany  wanted a port toward the west through which she could more conveniently  reach her customers in North and South America and elsewhere. It is  interesting to notice that the river Scheldt (skelt), on which Antwerp  is situated, passes through Holland on its way to the sea. Even if  Germany secured Belgium this would not give her control of the Antwerp  outlet nor would it give her Rotterdam. It is certain that eventual  domination of Holland was part of Germany's plan.    Germany wanted that part of Russia which was along the Baltic Sea. The  part of Germany adjoining this, called East Prussia, is the stronghold  of the Prussian Junkers, or landed nobility. These people already own  great estates in the Baltic provinces of Russia. Germany wished to  govern this German-owned land and provide a place to which her surplus  population could emigrate and still be in German territory. The Junkers  were especially anxious for this to come about as it would greatly  increase their power in Germany.    \"Pan-Germanists\" is the name given to a group of German leaders who  aimed especially to bring all German-speaking peoples into the German  Empire. In general, however, the same leaders aimed to bring under  German control all the districts that have been mentioned above,  together with the Balkan states and other"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17212"],[0,"Michelangelo (#4)"],[1,"rio, Giulio de' Medici, Bibbiena, Petrucci, Farnese, Alidosi, Gonzaga,       cardinals and patrons of literature.

I    THE MADONNA AND CHILD      About two thousand years ago a babe was born in the little  Judaean village of Bethlehem whose life was to change all history. His  name was Jesus, and every Christian country now takes his birth as a  standard from which to reckon time. When we speak of the year 1900, we  are counting the number of years that have passed since that event.[3]  To make this clear we sometimes add the initials A.D., standing for  the Latin words, Anno Domini, meaning in the year of our Lord. To go  still farther back we speak of an event as so many years B.C. or  Before Christ.    [Footnote 3: To be perfectly exact we must always add four years to a  date to get the full length of time passed since the birth of Christ,  as a mistake has been made in the calculation.]    The infant Jesus came to his mother Mary as a peculiar treasure.  Before his birth she had had a vision of an angel telling her that her  son was to reign over a great kingdom. She felt that there was a great  and solemn mystery in his life.    At the time he was born, Bethlehem happened to be crowded with people  who had come there to pay their taxes. When Mary and her husband  Joseph went to the inn, there was no room for them, and the baby was  laid in a manger used to feed cattle. This was a humble cradle for  one destined to be a king; but the mother did not think too much of  outward things. Her confidence in her son's greatness was not to be  shaken by trifles like this.    The new-born babe was soon sought out. First came some shepherds  asking to see him, because, while watching their sheep at night, they  had had a vision of angels telling them that a Saviour was born in  Bethlehem. Still stranger visitors were some wise men from the East,  who said they had seen a star which signified to them the birth of a  king. They brought the babe royal gifts of gold and frankincense and  myrrh, and returned on their way well pleased with the success of  their journey.    When the babe was about a month old he was carried up to the great  city of Jerusalem, where, according to the religious custom of the  Jews, he was to be offered or presented to the Lord, in the temple.  Here a saintly old man named Simeon took him in his arms, with some  strange words of prophecy of the salvation which this child was to  bring to the world.    All these things made a deep impression upon Mary, and she was a proud  and devoted mother. Day by day she watched her child grow \"strong in  spirit, filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon him.\" It is  said that        \"All mothers worship little feet,      And kiss the very ground they've trod,\"    and this mother had special cause for child worship.    [Illustration: MADONNA AND CHILD. _National Museum, Florence._]    The Italians always refer to the mother of Jesus as the Madonna,  which is the old Italian way of addressing a lady. This representation  of the Madonna and Child makes us understand better what the two were  to each other. The confiding way in which the boy leans against his  mother's knee shows the love between them. The mother looks like a  queen; on her well-poised head she wears a headdress something like a  crown. As the mother of a prince she bears her honors proudly.    On her lap is the book from which she has been reading. The child  seems dreaming of the wonderful words he has heard, as he rests his  cheek on his little hand, his elbow bent across the open page. A  thoughtful mood is upon them both, and there is something wistful in  the boy's attitude. The message they have read must indeed be a solemn  one. Perhaps it is something which recalls to the mother the promise  of the angel in foretelling the birth of Jesus. She thinks of the  great honors that are to be his, and also of the sacrifices by which  they must be won. The book may be open at the words of one of those  old Hebrew prophets who longed for the coming of the Redeemer. There  is a verse in the prophecy of Isaiah, which speaks of a child upon  whose shoulders the government shall rest.[4] The writer tells some of  the many names by which he shall be called, and we may imagine this  mother and child going over together these strange titles: \"Wonderful,  Counsellor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The Prince of  Peace.\"    [Footnote 4: Isaiah, chapter ix. verse 6.]    Our illustration is from a bas-relief by Michelangelo, and as we  examine it closely we discover that the sculptor's work was left  unfinished. The rough marks of the chisel are still seen on the  surface of the marble. A child's figure in the background is quite  indistinct. Probably it was intended for the boy St. John the Baptist,  the cousin of Jesus. The child Jesus himself is by no means completed;  his right arm is only faintly indicated.    As we shall learn from other examples of sculpture in this book,[5]  Michelangelo often neglected to carry his work to completion. He was  so possessed with his ideas that he could not work fast enough in  sketching them on the marble, but after this, it did not matter so  much to him about the finishing. He had done enough to show his  meaning.    [Footnote 5: Note particularly the Cupid on page 15, and the tomb of  Giuliano de' Medici on page 81.]    There are reasons for liking such work all the better for being  unfinished. Some of the most delightful stories ever written, like  those of Hawthorne, leave something at the end still unexplained. The  reader's imagination is then free to go on forever exploring the  mystery, and inventing new situations. So in this bas-relief, the  great sculptor does not work out the details, but allows us to  exercise our own fancy upon them. He sketches his thought in a few  noble lines, and each may round out for himself the completed ideal.          II    DAVID      Long ago in the country of Palestine lived a lad named David, who kept  his father's sheep. His free life out of doors made him strong and  manly beyond his years. The Israelites were at this time at war with  the Philistines, and David's quick wit and indomitable courage fitted  him to play an important part in the issue of the war.    The Philistine army contained a giant named Goliath, described as \"six  cubits and a span\" in height. That is over ten feet; but perhaps his  terrible appearance, in all his armor, made him taller than he really  was.    One day this giant came out from his army and made a proposal to the  Israelites:[6] \"Choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.  If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your  servants: but if I prevail against him and kill him, then shall ye be  our servants, and serve us.\" Every day, morning and evening for forty  days, the Philistine stood forth and repeated his challenge, yet in  vain. Saul, the king, and all Israel, were \"dismayed and greatly  afraid.\"    [Footnote 6: 1 Samuel, chapter xvii. verses 8, 9.]    Now it happened that David's three elder brothers were in the  Israelite army, and one day their father sent him to them with a  present of some provisions. While the lad was talking with his  brothers, Goliath came out with his usual call of defiance. David  listened with wonder and indignation. \"Who is this Philistine?\" he  asked scornfully, \"that he should defy the armies of the living God?\"  The brothers were angry at what they thought foolish bravado on the  part of David; but there were others who reported his words to Saul,  who forthwith sent for the lad. Then David amazed the king by boldly  offering to go and fight with the Philistine.    \"And Saul said to David, 'Thou art not able to go against this  Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man  of war from his youth.' And David said unto Saul, 'Thy servant kept  his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb  out of the flock: And I went out after him, and smote him, and  delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught  him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him. Thy servant slew both"]]]
