Shall we go?\"    \"Certainly, if it suits you, Rose,\" replied Mr. Dinsmore; \"and Elsie;\" he  added, \"will you go, daughter?\"    \"If you wish it, papa,\" she answered cheerfully; yet there was a slight  reluctance in her tone.    He gave her a kind, fond look. \"You are your own mistress, and can accept  or decline as your judgment and wishes dictate.\"    \"But you would rather have me go, papa?\"    \"I would, because it would seem more kind and courteous. But what is the  objection in your mind? Perhaps it could be removed.\"    \"I wanted so much to see Lucy this morning,\" Elsie answered with a blush;  \"but to-morrow will do.\"    \"But both might be accomplished if mamma and Adelaide like to have Caesar  drive them and the little ones over to Roselands. Then you and I will  mount our horses and away to Ashlands for a call, leaving there in good  time to join the dinner party at Roselands. How will that do?\"    \"Oh, bravely, you dear darling papa! always contriving for my enjoyment.\"    Mr. Dinsmore followed his wife from the room. \"'Twill be an early return  of Carrington's call,\" he said, \"but I have a little business with him.\"    \"Yes, I'm very glad: it is a good plan; but don't hurry Elsie away. She  and Lucy will want a long talk.\"    \"I promise to be careful to obey orders,\" he answered, sportively. \"Is  that all?\"    \"Yes; only see that you don't stay too long, and keep the dinner waiting  at Roselands.\"    \"Mamma,\" asked Elsie, bringing up the rear as they entered the  sitting-room, \"can't you go, too--you and Aunt Adelaide? Four make as nice  a party as two, and the babies can be driven over quite safely, with their  mammies, to take care of them.\"    \"No,\" said Rose, \"I never accept such late invitations; I shall----\"    \"My dear,\" said her husband, \"we would be very glad.\"    \"No, no; the first arrangement is decidedly the best;\" putting on an air  of pretended pique.    \"Babies! do you call me a baby?\" cried young Horace, who had sprung to his  feet with a flash of indignation in his great black eyes, \"I'm nine years  old, Elsie. Rosie there's the only baby belonging to this house. Do you  think papa would let a baby have a pony like Gip? and a pistol of his own,  too?\"    Elsie put her arms round his neck, and gave him a kiss, \"I beg ten  thousand pardons.\"    \"Elsie, my daughter, don't allow yourself to speak so extravagantly,\"  interrupted her father.    \"I will try not, papa,\" she answered. \"I beg your pardon, Horace dear, and  assure you I think you are quite a manly young man. Now I must prepare for  my ride, papa. I shall be ready by the time the horses can be brought to  the door.\"    \"Papa,\" said Horace, as the door closed upon his sister, \"may I ride Gip  to-day?\"    \"If you promise me to keep close beside the carriage.\"    \"Oh, papa, can't I ride on ahead a little, now and then, or fall a few  paces behind if I wish?\"    \"No; you may do just what I have given permission for, and nothing else.\"          CHAPTER FOURTH.        \"Grace was in all her steps, heaven in her eye,       In ev'ry gesture, dignity and love.\"                            --MILTON'S PARADISE LOST.      \"But, Elsie, what of Mr. Travilla?\" asked her father, as he handed her  into the saddle.    \"He will not be here till evening, sir,\" she answered, the rose on her  cheek deepening slightly.    \"Then I can have undisturbed possession for to-day at least,\" replied Mr.  Dinsmore, mounting. \"We couldn't have a lovelier day for a ride.\"    \"Nor better company,\" added Elsie, archly, keeping her horse's head on a  line with that of her father's larger Steed, as they followed the winding  carriage road at a brisk canter.    \"Why, you conceited little puss?\" returned Mr. Dinsmore laughing.    Elsie blushed more deeply this time. \"Why, papa, you are the company  to-day, are you not? I wished to go, and you kindly arranged to accompany  me.\"    \"Ah! and that is how you look at it? Well, I recall my rebuke, and thank  you for your--what shall I say--pretty compliment, or appreciation of my  society?\"    \"Both, if you like. Oh, how nice it is to be at home again in our own dear  native land.\"    \"And what do you call your own dear native land?\"    \"What a strange question, papa! The great, grand old Union to be  sure--North and South, East and West--is it not all mine? Have you not  taught me so yourself?\"    \"Yes,\" he said musingly.    They rode on in silence for some minutes, and when he spoke again, it was  upon a subject entirely foreign to the last.    \"The place looks natural,\" he remarked, as they turned into the avenue  leading to the fine old dwelling of the Carringtons.    \"How kind, how very kind, to come so soon!\" was Mrs. Carrington's cordial,  joyful salutation. \"Mr. Dinsmore, I owe you a thousand thanks for not only  permitting your daughter to come, but bringing her yourself.\"    \"You are very welcome, my dear madam,\" he answered courteously; \"and,  indeed, I should like to see Mrs. Rose myself, when she is well enough and  feels that it will be agreeable to her.\"    A few moments' chat in the drawing-room, and Mr. Dinsmore drew out his  watch. \"How long a talk do you want with your friend to-day, Elsie?\" he  asked.    \"Oh, just as long as I can be allowed, papa!\" she cried, with much of the  old childish eagerness.    \"Then the sooner you begin, the better, I think, for we ought to be on our  way to Roselands in an hour, or an hour and a quarter at the farthest.\"    Upon that the gentlemen retired to the library to talk over business  matters, and Mrs. Carrington led the way for Elsie to Lucy's room. But  pausing in the upper hall, she took the young girl in her arms, folding  her in a close, loving embrace, and heaping upon her tearful, tender,  silent caresses.    \"My poor boy! my poor dear Herbert,\" she murmured at length, as she  released her hold. \"Darling, I can never forget that you might have been  my daughter. But there--I will leave you. Lucy occupies her old rooms, and  yonder is her door; you know the way.\"    \"But come in with me, dear Mrs. Carrington,\" urged Elsie, the tears  shining in her eyes.    \"No, dear, not just yet. Lucy would prefer to see you quite alone at  first, I know.\" And she glided away in the opposite direction.    A soft, cooing sound came to Elsie's ear, mingled with fondling words, in  a negro voice, as she stood an instant waiting admittance. Lucy, a good  deal paler and thinner than the Lucy of old, lay back in an easy chair,  languidly turning the leaves of a new magazine.    \"Open the door, mammy,\" she said, \"I thought I heard a rap.\" Then at sight  of Elsie, the magazine was hastily tossed aside, and with a cry of joy,  \"Oh, you darling! I thought I'd never see you again,\" she sprang forward,  caught her friend in a close embrace, and wept upon her neck.    Elsie soothed her with caresses and words of endearment, and presently she  calmed down, made her friend take a seat, and sinking back into her own,  wiped away the tears still welling up in her eyes, and with a little  hysterical laugh said, \"Please don't look so concerned, or think I'm  unhappy with my dear old Phil, or going to die, or any such nonsense: it's  just my nerves; hateful, torturing things! I wish I'd never found out I  had any.\"    \"You poor dear, I'm so sorry for your lost health,\" said Elsie, exchanging  her chair for a low ottoman at Lucy's feet, and taking the small thin  hands in hers, stroking and patting them caressingly; \"I know nerves won't  be reasoned with, and that tears are often a great relief.\"    \"And I've everything to make me happy,\" sobbed Lucy--\"the best husband in  the world, and the darlingest of babies, to say nothing of mamma and papa,  and the rest, and really almost everything one could desire.\"    \"Oh, the baby, yes!\" cried Elsie, turning towards it with eager interest;  \"the sweet, pretty darling. May I take him a moment, Lucy?\"    \"Certainly, if he's not too heavy--bring him here, mammy. I remember your  father would not allow you to lift or carry little Horace.\"    \"Ah, but that was years ago! Ah, how lovely he is!\" as the babe accepted  her mute invitation to come to her. \"You are rich indeed, with this  treasure added to all your others. And you and your Phil don't quarrel  yet?\"    \"No indeed! not the first cross word yet. Mamma calls us her turtle-doves:  says we're always billing and cooing. Ah, Elsie, how beautiful you are!  I've always thought you just as lovely as possible, yet there's an added  something--I can't divine what--that increases even your peerless  attractions.\"    \"O Lucy, Lucy, still a flatterer!\" laughed her friend.    \"Yet you've come back to us single,\" Lucy went on, ignoring the  interruption, \"though we all know you had ever so many good offers.

Some things the Bible  tells us plainly, and in regard to those we have nothing to do but obey.\"          CHAPTER FOURTH.        \"A child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame.\"                                        --PROVERBS xxix. 15.      Lucy, too, had a talk with her children, in which she begged them quite  pathetically, not to disgrace her before the expected guests, Mr. Dinsmore  especially, who was so very strict in his ideas of how children ought to  be brought up, and how they should behave.    They promised readily enough to \"behave splendidly\" and for a few days did  so astonishingly well that, as she laughingly said, \"she began to grow  frightened lest they were becoming too good to live.\"    But she need not have been alarmed; the reaction was not long in coming  and was sufficient to relieve all apprehension that they were in immediate  danger from an overplus of goodness.    It began on the morning after Mr. Dinsmore's departure. Gertrude was late  to breakfast, and when reproved by her mother answered in a manner so  disrespectful as to quite astonish the young Travillas. They expected to  see her banished at once from the table and the room; but her mother only  looked grave and said in a tone of displeasure, \"Gertrude, I cannot have  you speak to me in that way--Don't do it again.\"    \"I don't care; you needn't scold so about every little trifle then,\"  muttered the delinquent in an undertone, pulling the dish of meat toward  her, helping herself and spilling the gravy on the clean tablecloth.    Mrs. Ross did not seem to hear, she was spreading a piece of bread with  the sweetest and freshest of butter, for Sophie.    \"I don't want it, I want waffles!\" screamed the child, snatching up the  bread the instant it was laid on her plate, and dashing it on to the  carpet.    \"You are not well this morning, dear, and mamma thinks waffles might make  her darling worse,\" said Lucy in a soothing tone. \"Come now be a good  baby, and eat the bread. Shall mamma spread another piece?\"    \"No, no, naughty mamma! I'll jus' frow it on the floor if you do,\" cried  the child, bursting into angry sobs.    \"Shall mamma have some toast made for her?\" (coaxingly).    \"No, no! waffles! and butter on waffles, and 'lasses on butter, and sugar  on 'lasses!\"    The mother laughed. It seemed to irritate the child still further; and she  screamed louder than ever, slid down from her chair and stamped her foot  with rage.    Mrs. Ross was deeply mortified at the exhibition. \"Pick her up and carry  her to the nursery,\" she said to a servant.    Sophie kicked and struggled, but the girl,--a strong and determined  one--carried her away by main force.    \"I'm dreadfully ashamed of her, Elsie,\" Lucy said, turning to her friend;  \"but she's a nervous little creature and we must try to excuse her.\"    \"A few hearty slaps would reverse the nervous currents and do her an  immense amount of good, Mrs. Ross,\" remarked the governess in her slow,  precise way.    \"Slaps, Miss Fisk,\" returned Lucy reddening, \"_I_ don't approve of  corporal punishment, as _I_ have told you more than once. I was never  whipped, and I don't intend that any of my children shall be.\"    \"Most assuredly not, madam; but I was recommending it not as a punishment  for disobedience or ill temper, but simply as a remedial agent. I have  never experienced anything of the kind myself, Mrs. Ross, but have heard  it remarked that nervousness occasions greater suffering than what is  generally understood by the term pain; therefore I suggested it as I  should the amputation of a diseased member when necessary in order to  preserve life.\"    \"Permit me to remark,\" returned Lucy, \"that unmasked advice is seldom  acceptable, and now a truce to discussion, if you please. My dear Elsie,\"  turning to Mrs. Travilla, \"I beg you to excuse our ill-manners. It  strikes me that none of us are behaving quite as we ought this morning.  Hal and Archie, what's wrong between you now?\" For the two boys, seated  side by side, were scowling at each other, and muttering angrily half  under their breath.    \"Why, ma, he went and took the very piece of meat I just said I was going  to have,\" whimpered Archie, digging his fists into his eyes.    \"Well, I don't care,\" retorted Harry, \"I'd as good a right as you, and I  was ready first.\"    \"Give him a part of it, can't you?\" said his mother.    \"'Tain't more'n I want myself.\"    \"I won't have it after it's been on his plate,\" exclaimed both together.    \"Boys, I'm ashamed of you!\" said Lucy, \"I wish your father were here to  keep you straight. You don't dare behave so before him. I'm sure your  little friends would never act so. Don't you see how your naughtiness  astonishes them? Vi, would you talk to your mamma as my children do to  me?\"    The large blue eyes opened wide upon the questioner in half incredulous,  reproachful surprise, then turned upon the beautiful, gentle face of Mrs.  Travilla with an expression of ardent affection mingled with admiration  and respect. \"O Aunt Lucy! could you b'lieve I'd do that to my mamma?\"    The very thought of so wounding that tender mother heart was evidently so  full of pain to the little one, that Elsie could not refrain from  responding to the appeal, \"Mamma knows you would not, darling.\"    \"Oh, no, mamma, 'cause I love you!\" cried the child, the young face  growing bright with smiles.    \"Atmospheric influences have often a great deal to do with these things;  do you not find it so?\" Elsie said, turning to her friend.    \"Yes, I have noticed that!\" Lucy said, catching gladly at the suggestion:  \"and the air is certainly unusually oppressive this morning. I feel  nervous myself. I think we'll have a gust before night.\"    The last words were spoken in an undertone, but the quick ear of Gertrude  caught them. \"Then I shan't go to school,\" she announced decidedly.    \"Nonsense,\" said her mother, \"'twon't be here till afternoon; probably not  till night, if at all.\"    \"Now, ma, you're just saying that. Aunt Elsie, do you really think it  won't come soon?\"    Glancing through the open window at the mountains and the sky, Elsie  answered that she saw no present indications of a storm; there was nothing  to betoken it but the heat and closeness of the air.    \"Are you afraid of thunder, Aunt Elsie?\" asked Harry.    \"Lightning, you silly boy,\" corrected Gertrude, \"nobody's afraid of  thunder.\"    \"Yes, you are,\" he retorted. \"You just ought to see, Ed, how scared she  gets,\" and Harry laughed scornfully.    Gertrude was ready with an indignant retort, but her mother stopped her.  \"If you are really brave, Gertrude, you can have an excellent opportunity  to show it when the storm comes.\" Then to Harry, \"Let your sister alone,  or I'll send you from the room.\"    The gust, a very severe one, came in the afternoon. Before it was fairly  upon them, Lucy, herself pale with terror, had collected her children in a  darkened room and seated them all on a feather-bed, where they remained  during the storm, half stifled by the heat, the little ones clinging to  their mother, hiding their heads in her lap and crying with fear.    Elsie and her children formed a different group; the mother the central  figure here also, her darlings gathered closely about her, in her  dressing-room--at a safe distance from the open windows--watching with  awed delight, the bursting of the storm clouds over the mountain-tops, the  play of the lightning, the sweep of the rain down from the heights into  the valleys and river below, listening to the crash and roar of the  thunder as it reverberated among the hills, one echo taking it up after  another, and repeating it to the next, till it sounded like the  explosions of many batteries of heavy artillery, now near at hand, now  farther and farther away.    \"Mamma, isn't it grand?\" exclaimed Eddie, in one of the brief pauses in  the wild uproar of the elements.    \"Yes,\" she said, \"the thunder of his power who can understand?\"    \"Is it God, mamma? does God make it?\" asked little Herbert.    \"Yes, dear; 'when he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in  the heavens, and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the  earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of  his treasuries.'\"    \"We needn't be 'f'aid, mamma?\"    \"No, darling, no; for God is our Father; He loves us and will take care of  us.\"    The storm was very violent while it lasted, but soon passed away; the sun  shone out, and a beautiful rainbow spanned the eastern sky above the  mountain-tops.    Elsie's children clapped their hands in ecstasy, and ran to call their  little friends to enjoy the sight with them. Mrs. Ross followed, looking  so pale and exhausted, that Elsie inquired with concern if she were ill.    \"Oh, it was the storm!\" she said, \"wasn't it fearful? I was sure the house  would be struck and some of us killed. Weren't you frightened?\"    \"No,\" Elsie said, with a kindly reassuring smile, \"I presume my nerves are  stronger than yours, and I am not naturally timid in regard to thunder and  lightning. Besides, I know so well that he who guides and controls it is  my Father and my Friend. Come, look at his bow of promise.\"    The children were in a group about the window, gazing and admiring.    \"Let's ask mamma for the story of it,\" Vi was saying.    \"The story of it?\" repeated Archie Ross.    \"Yes; don't you know? about Noah and the flood.\"    \"I never heard it.\"    \"Oh, Archie, it's in the Bible; grandma told it to us once,\" exclaimed his  sister Gertrude.    \"I didn't hear it, anyhow,\" persisted the boy, \"do, Vi, coax Aunt Elsie to  tell it.\"    The petition was readily granted.
