Moene Mokaia is  now negotiating with Syde bin Habib to go and revenge this, for so much  ivory, and all he can get besides. Syde, by trying to revenge the death  of Salem bin Habib, his brother, on the Bakatala, has blocked up one  part of the country against me, and will probably block Nzige, for I  cannot get a message sent to Chowambe by anyone, and may have to go to  Karagwe on foot, and then from Rumanyika down to this water.    [In reference to the above we may add that there is a vocabulary of  Masai words at the end of a memorandum-book. Livingstone compiled this  with the idea that it would prove useful on his way towards the coast,  should he eventually pass through the Masai country. No doubt some of  the Arabs or their slaves knew the language, and assisted him at his  work.]    _29th May, 1869._--Many people went off to Unyembe, and their houses  were untenanted; I wished one, as I was in a lean-to of Zahor's, but the  two headmen tried to secure the rent for themselves, and were defeated  by Mohamad bin Saleh. I took my packet of letters to Thani, and gave two  cloths and four bunches of beads to the man who was to take them to  Unyanyembe; an hour afterwards, letters, cloths, and beads were  returned: Thani said he was afraid of English letters; he did not know  what was inside. I had sewed them up in a piece of canvas, that was  suspicious, and he would call all the great men of Ujiji and ask them if  it would be safe to take them; if they assented he would call for the  letters, if not he would not send them. I told Mohamad bin Saleh, and he  said to Thani that he and I were men of the Government, and orders had  come from Syed Majid to treat me with all respect: was this conduct  respectful? Thani then sent for the packet, but whether it will reach  Zanzibar I am doubtful. I gave the rent to the owner of the house and  went into it on 31st May. They are nearly all miserable Suaheli at  Ujiji, and have neither the manners nor the sense of Arabs.    [We see in the next few lines how satisfied Livingstone was concerning  the current in the Lake: he almost wishes to call Tanganyika _a river_.  Here then is a problem left for the future explorer to determine.  Although the Doctor proved by experiments during his lengthy stay at  Ujiji that the set is towards the north, his two men get over the  difficulty thus: \"If you blow upon the surface of a basin of water on  one side, you will cause the water at last to revolve round and round;  so with Tanganyika, the prevailing winds produce a similar  circulation.\". They feel certain there is no outlet, because at one time  or another they virtually completed the survey of the coast line and  listened to native testimony besides. How the phenomenon of sweet water  is to be accounted for we do not pretend to say. The reader will see  further on that Livingstone grapples with the difficulty which this Lake  affords, and propounds an exceedingly clever theory.]    Tanganyika has encroached on the Ujiji side upwards of a mile, and the  bank, which was in the memory of men now living, garden ground, is  covered with about two fathoms of water: in this Tanganyika resembles  most other rivers in this country, as the Upper Zambesi for instance,  which in the Barotse country has been wearing eastwards for the last  thirty years: this Lake, or river, has worn eastwards too.    _1st June, 1869._--I am thankful to feel getting strong again, and wish  to go down Tanganyika, but cannot get men: two months must elapse ere we  can face the long grass and superabundant water in the way to Manyuema.    [Illustration: Lines of Green Scum]    The green scum which forms on still water in this country is of  vegetable origin--confervae. When the rains fall they swell the lagoons,  and the scum is swept into the Lake; here it is borne along by the  current from south to north, and arranged in long lines, which bend from  side to side as the water flows, but always N.N.W. or N.N.E., and not  driven, as here, by the winds, as plants floating above the level of the  water would be.    _7th June, 1869._--It is remarkable that all the Ujiji Arabs who have  any opinion on the subject, believe that all the water in the north, and  all the water in the south, too, flows into Tanganyika, but where it  then goes they have no conjecture. They assert, as a matter of fact,  that Tanganyika, Usige water, and Loanda, are one and the same piece of  river.    Thani, on being applied to for men and a canoe to take me down this line  of drainage, consented, but let me know that his people would go no  further than Uvira, and then return. He subsequently said Usige, but I  wished to know what I was to do when left at the very point where I  should be most in need. He replied, in his silly way, \"My people are  afraid; they won't go further; get country people,\" &c. Moeneghere sent  men to Loanda to force a passage through, but his people were repulsed  and twenty killed.    Three men came yesterday from Mokamba, the greatest chief in Usige,  with four tusks as a present to his friend Moeneghere, and asking for  canoes to be sent down to the end of Urundi country to bring butter and  other things, which the three men could not bring: this seems an  opening, for Mokamba being Moeneghere's friend I shall prefer paying  Moeneghere for a canoe to being dependent on Thani's skulkers. If the  way beyond Mokamba is blocked up by the fatal skirmish referred to, I  can go from Mokamba to Rumanyika, three or four or more days distant,  and get guides from him to lead me back to the main river beyond Loanda,  and by this plan only three days of the stream will be passed over  unvisited. Thani would evidently like to receive the payment, but  without securing to me the object for which I pay. He is a poor thing, a  slaveling: Syed Majid, Sheikh Suleiman, and Koroje, have all written to  him, urging an assisting deportment in vain: I never see him but he begs  something, and gives nothing, I suppose he expects me to beg from him. I  shall be guided by Moeneghere.    I cannot find anyone who knows where the outflow of the unvisited Lake  S.W. of this goes; some think that it goes to the Western Ocean, or, I  should say, the Congo. Mohamad Bogharib goes in a month to Manyuema, but  if matters turn out as I wish, I may explore this Tanganyika line first.  One who has been in Manyuema three times, and was of the first party  that ever went there, says that the Manyuema are not cannibals, but a  tribe west of them eats some parts of the bodies of those slain in war.  Some people south of Moenekuss[5], chief of Manyuema, build strong clay  houses.    _22nd June, 1869._--After listening to a great deal of talk I have come  to the conclusion that I had better not go with Moeneghere's people to  Mokamba. I see that it is to be a mulcting, as in Speke's case: I am to  give largely, though I am not thereby assured of getting down the river.  They say, \"You must give much, because you are a great man: Mokamba will  say so\"--though Mokamba knows nothing about me! It is uncertain whether  I can get down through by Loanda, and great risk would be run in going  to those who cut off the party of Moeneghere, so I have come to the  conclusion that it will be better for me to go to Manyuema about a  fortnight hence, and, if possible, trace down the western arm of the  Nile to the north--if this arm is indeed that of the Nile, and not of  the Congo. Nobody here knows anything about it, or, indeed, about the  eastern or Tanganyika line either; they all confess that they have but  one question in their minds in going anywhere, they ask for ivory and  for nothing else, and each trip ends as a foray. Moeneghere's last trip  ended disastrously, twenty-six of his men being cut off; in extenuation  he says that it was not his war but Mokamba's: he wished to be allowed  to go down through Loanda, and as the people in front of Mokamba and  Usige own his supremacy, he said, \"Send your force with mine and let us  open the way,\" so they went on land and were killed. An attempt was made  to induce Syde bin Habib to clear the way, and be paid in ivory, but  Syde likes to battle with those who will soon run away and leave the  spoil to him.    The Manyuema are said to be friendly where they have not been attacked  by Arabs: a great chief is reported as living on a large river flowing  northwards, I hope to make my way to him, and I feel exhilarated at the  thought of getting among people not spoiled by contact with Arab  traders. I would not hesitate to run the risk of getting through Loanda,  the continuation of Usige beyond Mokamba's, had blood not been shed so  very recently there; but it would at present be a great danger, and to  explore some sixty miles of the Tanganyika line only. If I return  hither from Manyuema my goods and fresh men from Zanzibar will have  arrived, and I shall be better able to judge as to the course to be  pursued after that. Mokamba is about twenty, miles beyond Uvira; the  scene of Moeneghere's defeat, is ten miles beyond Mokamba; so the  unexplored part cannot be over sixty miles, say thirty if we take  Baker's estimate of the southing of his water to be near the truth.    Salem or Palamotto told me that he was sent for by a headman near to  this to fight his brother for him: he went and demanded prepayment; then  the brother sent him three tusks to refrain: Salem took them and came  home. The Africans have had hard measures meted out to them in the  world's history!    _28th June, 1869._--The current in Tanganyika is well marked when the  lighter-coloured water of a river flows in and does not at once mix--the  Luishe at Ujiji is a good example, and it shows by large light greenish  patches on the surface a current of nearly a mile an hour north. It  begins to flow about February, and continues running north till November  or December. Evaporation on 300 miles of the south is then at its  strongest, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1703"],[0,"Dead Men Tell No Tales (#4)"],[1,"ship, and I'll skip her as long as  I remain aboard!\"    I saw his hand go to his belt; I saw the pistols stuck there for  mutineers. I looked at Santos. He answered me with his neutral shrug,  and, by my soul, he struck a match and lit a cigarette in that hour of  life and death! Then last I looked at Ready; and he leant invertebrate  over the rail, gasping pitiably from his exertions in regaining the  poop, a dying man once more. I pointed out his piteous state.    \"At least,\" I whispered, \"you won't refuse to take him?\"    \"Will there be anything to take?\" said the captain brutally.    Santos advanced leisurely, and puffed his cigarette over the poor wasted  and exhausted frame.    \"It is for you to decide, captain,\" said he cynically; \"but this one  will make no deeference. Yes, I would take him. It will not be far,\" he  added, in a tone that was not the less detestable for being lowered.    \"Take them both!\" moaned little Eva, putting in her first and last sweet  word.    \"Then we all drown, Evasinha,\" said her stepfather. \"It is impossible.\"    \"We're too many for her as it is,\" said the captain. \"So for'ard with  ye, Mr. Cole, before it's too late.\"    But my darling's brave word for me had fired my blood, and I turned  with equal resolution on Harris and on the Portuguese. \"I will go like  a lamb,\" said I, \"if you will first give me five minutes' conversation  with Miss Denison. Otherwise I do not go; and as for the gig, you may  take me or leave me, as you choose.\"    \"What have you to say to her?\" asked Santos, coming up to me, and again  lowering his voice.    I lowered mine still more. \"That I love her!\" I answered in a soft  ecstasy. \"That she may remember how I loved her, if I die!\"    His shoulders shrugged a cynical acquiescence.    \"By all mins, senhor; there is no harm in that.\"    I was at her side before another word could pass his withered lips.    \"Miss Denison, will you grant me five minutes', conversation? It may be  the last that we shall ever have together!\"    Uncovering her face, she looked at me with a strange terror in her great  eyes; then with a questioning light that was yet more strange, for in it  there was a wistfulness I could not comprehend. She suffered me to take  her hand, however, and to lead her unresisting to the weather rail.    \"What is it you have to say?\" she asked me in her turn. \"What is it that  you--think?\"    Her voice fell as though she must have the truth.    \"That we have all a very good chance,\" said I heartily.    \"Is that all?\" cried Eva, and my heart sank at her eager manner.    She seemed at once disappointed and relieved. Could it be possible she  dreaded a declaration which she had foreseen all along? My evil first  experience rose up to warn me. No, I would not speak now; it was no  time. If she loved me, it might make her love me less; better to trust  to God to spare us both.    \"Yes, it is all,\" I said doggedly.    She drew a little nearer, hesitating. It was as though her  disappointment had gained on her relief.    \"Do you know what I thought you were going to say?\"    \"No, indeed.\"    \"Dare I tell you?\"    \"You can trust me.\"    Her pale lips parted. Her great eyes shone. Another instant, and she had  told me that which I would have given all but life itself to know. But  in that tick of time a quick step came behind me, and the light went out  of the sweet face upturned to mine.    \"I cannot! I must not! Here is--that man!\"    Senhor Santos was all smiles and rings of pale-blue smoke.    \"You will be cut off, friend Cole,\" said he. \"The fire is spreading.\"    \"Let it spread!\" I cried, gazing my very soul into the young girl's  eyes. \"We have not finished our conversation.    \"We have!\" said she, with sudden decision. \"Go--go--for my sake--for  your own sake--go at once!\"    She gave me her hand. I merely clasped it. And so I left her at the  rail-ah, heaven! how often we had argued on that very spot! So I left  her, with the greatest effort of all my life (but one); and yet in  passing, full as my heart was of love and self, I could not but lay a  hand on poor Ready's shoulders.    \"God bless you, old boy!\" I said to him.    He turned a white face that gave me half an instant's pause.    \"It's all over with me this time,\" he said. \"But, I say, I was right  about the cargo?\"    And I heard a chuckle as I reached the ladder; but Ready was no longer  in my mind; even Eva was driven out of it, as I stood aghast on the  top-most rung.          CHAPTER III. TO THE WATER'S EDGE      It was not the new panic amidships that froze my marrow; it was not that  the pinnace hung perpendicularly by the fore-tackle, and had shot out  those who had swarmed aboard her before she was lowered, as a cart  shoots a load of bricks. It was bad enough to see the whole boat-load  struggling, floundering, sinking in the sea; for selfish eyes (and which  of us is all unselfish at such a time?) there was a worse sight yet; for  I saw all this across an impassable gulf of fire.    The quarter-deck had caught: it was in flames to port and starboard of  the flaming hatch; only fore and aft of it was the deck sound to the  lips of that hideous mouth, with the hundred tongues shooting out and  up.    Could I jump it there? I sprang down and looked. It was only a few feet  across; but to leap through that living fire was to leap into eternity.  I drew back instantly, less because my heart failed me, I may truly say,  than because my common sense did not.    Some were watching me, it seemed, across this hell. \"The bulwarks!\" they  screamed. \"Walk along the bulwarks!\" I held up my hand in token that  I heard and understood and meant to act. And as I did their bidding I  noticed what indeed had long been apparent to idler eyes: the wind was  not; we had lost our southeast trades; the doomed ship was rolling in a  dead calm.    Rolling, rolling, rolling so that it seemed minutes before I dared to  move an inch. Then I tried it on my hands and knees, but the scorched  bulwarks burned me to the bone. And then I leapt up, desperate with the  pain; and, with my tortured hands spread wide to balance me, I walked  those few yards, between rising sea and falling fire, and falling sea  and rising fire, as an acrobat walks a rope, and by God's grace without  mishap.    There was no time to think twice about my feat, or, indeed, about  anything else that befell upon a night when each moment was more  pregnant than the last. And yet I did think that those who had  encouraged me to attempt so perilous a trick might have welcomed me  alive among them; they were looking at something else already; and this  was what it was.    One of the cabin stewards had presented himself on the poop; he had a  bottle in one hand, a glass in the other; in the red glare we saw  him dancing in front of the captain like an unruly marionette. Harris  appeared to threaten him. What he said we could not hear for the  deep-drawn blast and the high staccato crackle of the blazing hold. But  we saw the staggering steward offering him a drink; saw the glass flung  next instant in the captain's face, the blood running, a pistol drawn,  fired without effect, and snatched away by the drunken mutineer. Next  instant a smooth black cane was raining blow after blow on the man's  head. He dropped; the blows fell thick and heavy as before. He lay  wriggling; the Portuguese struck and struck until he lay quite still;  then we saw Joaquin Santos kneel, and rub his stick carefully on the  still thing's clothes, as a man might wipe his boots.    Curses burst from our throats; yet the fellow deserved to die. Nor, as I  say, had we time to waste two thoughts upon any one incident. This  last had begun and ended in the same minute; in another we were at the  starboard gangway, tumbling helter-skelter aboard the lowered long-boat.    She lay safely on the water: how we thanked our gods for that! Lower and  lower sank her gunwale as we dropped aboard her, with no more care than  the Gadarene swine whose fate we courted. Discipline, order, method,  common care, we brought none of these things with us from our floating  furnace; but we fought to be first over the bulwarks, and in the bottom  of the long-boat we fought again.    And yet she held us all! All, that is, but a terror-stricken few, who  lay along the jibboom like flies upon a stick: all but two or three more  whom we left fatally hesitating in the forechains: all but the selfish  savages who had been the first to perish in the pinnace, and one  distracted couple who had thrown their children into the kindly ocean,  and jumped in after them out of their torment, locked for ever in each  other's arms.    Yes! I saw more things on that starry night, by that blood-red glare,  than I have told you in their order, and more things than I shall tell  you now. Blind would I gladly be for my few remaining years, if that  night's horrors could be washed from these eyes for ever. I have said so  much, however, that in common candor I must say one thing more. I have  spoken of selfish savages. God help me and forgive me! For by this time  I was one myself.    In the long-boat we cannot have been less than thirty; the exact number  no man will ever know. But we shoved off without mischance; the chief  mate had the tiller; the third mate the boat-hook; and six or eight  oars were at work, in a fashion, as we plunged among the great smooth  sickening mounds and valleys of fathomless ink.    Scarcely were we clear when the foremast dropped down on the fastenings,  dashing the jib-boom into the water with its load of demented human  beings. The mainmast followed by the board before we had doubled our  distance from the wreck. Both trailed to port, where we could not see  them; and now the mizzen stood alone in sad and solitary grandeur, her  flapping idle sails lighted up by the spreading conflagration, so that  they were stamped very sharply upon the black add starry sky. But the  whole "]]]
