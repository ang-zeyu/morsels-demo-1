I haven't slept for weeks!\" She knit her little  hands together, till the jewelled rings almost cut into the fingers. \"He  is everything to me; there is nothing else in the world. You, who are so  great, and strong, and clever, and who care only for your work, and for  men as your friends, you cannot understand what it is when one person is  everything to you, when there is nothing else in the world!\"    \"And what do you want me to do?\"    \"Oh, I don't know!\" She looked up. \"A woman knows what she can do. Don't  tell him that I love him.\" She looked up again. \"Just say something to  him. Oh, it's so terrible to be a woman; I can't do anything. You won't  tell him exactly that I love him? That's the thing that makes a man hate  a woman, if you tell it him plainly.\"    \"If I speak to him I must speak openly. He is my friend. I cannot fence  with him. I have never fenced with him in my own affairs.\" She moved as  though she were going away from the fireplace, then she turned and said:  \"Have you thought of what love is between a man and a woman when it  means marriage? That long, long life together, day after day, stripped  of all romance and distance, living face to face: seeing each other as  a man sees his own soul? Do you realize that the end of marriage is to  make the man and woman stronger than they were; and that if you cannot,  when you are an old man and woman and sit by the fire, say, 'Life has  been a braver and a freer thing for us, because we passed it hand in  hand, than if we had passed through it alone,' it has failed? Do you  care for him enough to live for him, not tomorrow, but when he is an  old, faded man, and you an old, faded woman? Can you forgive him his  sins and his weaknesses, when they hurt you most? If he were to lie a  querulous invalid for twenty years, would you be able to fold him in  your arms all that time, and comfort him, as a mother comforts her  little child?\" The woman drew her breath heavily.    \"Oh, I love him absolutely! I would be glad to die, if only I could once  know that he loved me better than anything in the world!\"    The woman stood looking down at her. \"Have you never thought of that  other woman; whether she could not perhaps make his life as perfect as  you?\" she asked, slowly.    \"Oh, no woman ever could be to him what I would be. I would live for  him. He belongs to me.\" She bent herself forward, not crying, but her  shoulders moving. \"It is such a terrible thing to be a woman, to be able  to do nothing and say nothing!\"    The woman put her hand on her shoulder; the younger woman looked up into  her face; then the elder turned away and stood looking into the  fire. There was such quiet, you could hear the clock tick above the  writing-table.    The woman said: \"There is one thing I can do for you. I do not know if  it will be of any use--I will do it.\" She turned away.    \"Oh, you are so great and good, so beautiful, so different from other  women, who are always thinking only of themselves! Thank you so much.  I know I can trust you. I couldn't have told my mother, or any one but  you.\"    \"Now you must go; I have my work to finish.\"    The younger woman put her arms round her. \"Oh, you are so good and  beautiful!\"    The silk dress and the fur cloak rustled out of the room.    The woman who was left alone walked up and down, at last faster and  faster, till the drops stood on her forehead. After a time she went up  to the table; there was written illegibly in a man's hand on a fragment  of manuscript paper: \"Can I come to see you this afternoon?\" Near it was  a closed and addressed envelope. She opened it. In it were written the  words: \"Yes, please, come.\"    She tore it across and wrote the words: \"No, I shall not be at liberty.\"    She closed them in an envelope and addressed them. Then she rolled  up the manuscript on the table and rang the bell. She gave it to the  servant. \"Tell the boy to give this to his master, and say the article  ends rather abruptly; they must state it is to be continued; I will  finish it tomorrow. As he passes No. 20 let him leave this note there.\"    The servant went out. She walked up and down with her hands folded above  her head.    *****    Two months after, the older woman stood before the fire. The door opened  suddenly, and the younger woman came in.    \"I had to come--I couldn't wait. You have heard, he was married this  morning? Oh, do you think it is true? Do help me!\" She put out her  hands.    \"Sit down. Yes, it is quite true.\"    \"Oh, it is so terrible, and I didn't know anything! Did you ever say  anything to him?\" She caught the woman's hands.    \"I never saw him again after the day you were here,--so I could not  speak to him,--but I did what I could.\" She stood looking passively into  the fire.    \"And they say she is quite a child, only eighteen. They say he only saw  her three times before he proposed to her. Do you think it is true?\"    \"Yes, it is quite true.\"    \"He can't love her. They say he's only marrying her for her rank and her  money.\"    The woman turned quickly.    \"What right have you to say that? No one but I know him. What need has  he of any one's rank or wealth? He is greater than them all! Older women  may have failed him; he has needed to turn to her beautiful, fresh,  young life to compensate him. She is a woman whom any man might have  loved, so young and beautiful; her family are famed for their intellect.  If he trains her, she may make him a better wife than any other woman  would have done.\"    \"Oh, but I can't bear it--I can't bear it!\" The younger woman sat down  in the chair. \"She will be his wife, and have his children.\"    \"Yes.\" The elder woman moved quickly. \"One wants to have the child, and  lay its head on one's breast and feed it.\" She moved quickly. \"It would  not matter if another woman bore it, if one had it to take care of.\" She  moved restlessly.    \"Oh, no, I couldn't bear it to be hers. When I think of her I feel as if  I were dying; all my fingers turn cold; I feel dead. Oh, you were only  his friend; you don't know!\"    The older spoke softly and quickly, \"Don't you feel a little gentle  to her when you think she's going to be his wife and the mother of his  child? I would like to put my arms round her and touch her once, if she  would let me. She is so beautiful, they say.\"    \"Oh, I could never bear to see her; it would kill me. And they are so  happy together today! He is loving her so!\"    \"Don't you want him to be happy?\" The older woman looked down at her.  \"Have you never loved him, at all?\"    The younger woman's face was covered with her hands. \"Oh, it's so  terrible, so dark! and I shall go on living year after year, always in  this awful pain! Oh, if I could only die!\"    The older woman stood looking into the fire; then slowly and measuredly  she said, \"There are times, in life, when everything seems dark, when  the brain reels, and we cannot see that there is anything but death.  But, if we wait long enough, after long, long years, calm comes. It may  be we cannot say it was well; but we are contented, we accept the past.  The struggle is ended. That day may come for you, perhaps sooner than  you think.\" She spoke slowly and with difficulty.    \"No, it can never come for me. If once I have loved a thing, I love it  for ever. I can never forget.\"    \"Love is not the only end in life. There are other things to live for.\"    \"Oh, yes, for you! To me love is everything!\"    \"Now, you must go, dear.\"    The younger woman stood up. \"It has been such a comfort to talk to you.  I think I should have killed myself if I had not come. You help me so. I  shall always be grateful to you.\"    The older woman took her hand.    \"I want to ask something of you.\"    \"What is it?\"    \"I cannot quite explain to you. You will not understand. But there are  times when something more terrible can come into a life than it should  lose what it loves. If you have had a dream of what life ought to be,  and you try to make it real, and you fail; and something you have killed  out in your heart for long years wakes up and cries, 'Let each man play  his own game, and care nothing for the hand of his fellow! Each man for  himself. So the game must be played!' and you doubt all you have lived  for, and the ground seems washing out under your feet--.\" She paused.  \"Such a time has come to me now. If you would promise me that if ever  another woman comes to seek your help, you will give it to her, and try  to love her for my sake, I think it will help me. I think I should be  able to keep my faith.\"    \"Oh, I will do anything you ask me to. You are so good and great.\"    \"Oh, good and great!--if you knew! Now go, dear.\"    \"I have not kept you from your work, have I?\"    \"No; I have not been working lately. Good-by, dear.\"    The younger woman went; and the elder knelt down by the chair, and  wailed like a little child when you have struck it and it does not dare  to cry loud.    A year after; it was early spring again.    The woman sat at her desk writing; behind her the fire burnt brightly.  She was writing a leading article on the causes which in differing  peoples lead to the adoption of Free Trade or Protectionist principles.    The woman wrote on quickly. After a while the servant entered and laid a  pile of letters on the table. \"Tell the boy I shall have done in fifteen  minutes.\" She wrote on. Then she caught sight of the writing on one of  the letters. She put down her pen, and opened it. It ran so:--    \"Dear Friend,--I am writing to you, because I know you will rejoice to  hear of my great happiness. Do you remember how you told me that day by  the fire to wait, and after long, long years I should see that all was  for the best? That time has come sooner than we hoped. Last week in Rome  I was married to the best, noblest, most large-hearted of men. We are  now in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14586"],[0,"The Brain, A Decoded Enigma (#4)"],[1,"each step there is at least  one simulation before the step is done. Due to a large number of internal and  external factors, any step is unique. Thus, if we walk on a raw surface (a  stony trail in the mountains, for instance) not only every step in based on a  simulation but even during the execution of a step, it is possible to make a  new simulation based on new data and so a step in execution can be modified at  all time to meet the goal as ZAM requires. Thus, a very complicated activity  as walking on a mountain trail, can be done very easily and even elegantly,  based on continuous predictions and simulations associated with every step.    As it was already emphasized before, this procedure to simulate in advance any  activity on external reality is followed in all situations, regardless if the  activity is immediate or it has to be done in the future.    We have already described the two main hardware facilities of the brain (human  or animal). Here is a preliminary abstract of the main hardware models of the  brain:    M-models: these models are associated to sense organs. The brain tries to make  a preliminary model of the external reality. To do this, it uses a number of  YM concept models. The main activity is to find the entities of the external  reality and to associate to any entity a YM model. Then, by simulation on the  model, M-models try to integrate any YM model in the structure in a harmonic  way. That is, any simulation of interaction between a YM and any other YM-  model must confirm the M-model, unaltered.    If, for instance, some predictions of an YM1 model in relation with an YM2  model are not compatible with the prediction of the YM2 model in relation with  the YM1 model, then M has to change YM1 or YM2, or some relations, or some  other YMs, so that the M-model is stable. M-models work in an automatic way,  trying to be stable in interaction with the associated section of the external  reality.    YM-models: they are concept models associated with all the entities, which  have already been discovered by the brain by M-model activity. When a new  being is born, there are practically no YMs. They are made by direct  interaction with the external reality.    ZM-models: they are the main long-range models of the brain. They generate  knowledge and consciousness. Also they make YMs, ZAMs and AZMs. They are able  to take any information from any other model of the brain. ZMs can replace a  YM-model with another if something is not OK after an advance prediction and  simulation based on any available data. They also control ZAM-models during  their activity.    ZAM-models: they are artificial and invariant models. An artificial model is  not generated by direct interaction with the external reality. An invariant  model is a model, which cannot be changed by direct interaction with the  external reality. ZAMs are models, which act on the external reality. Once a  ZAM was made and activated by a ZM, it will simulate the activity, using any  information from any model of the brain. By one or more simulations, the ZAM  will find the right solution. If it fails to find a solution, then the ZM will  make another ZAM and the process continues.    AZM-models: they are associated in a direct way to the organs which can act on  external reality. They are ready-made when a being is born, but, to be used,  they have to be dynamically calibrated by the activity of the ZAMs. That is, a  ZAM has to know everything is association with the external organs of a body  (e.g. hands, legs for a human). When a ZAM has to make a simulation, it has to  know all the parameters of the muscles, for instance. An AZM has to know and  transmit such parameters. To do this, AZMs keep a model of any external organ  of that being.    All these models are associated with the hardware implementation of the brain.  We will see later some others types of models which are associated with the  software implementation of the brain.      SOME PRINCIPIAL PROBLEMS    When an M-model is activated it does not know how many entities are in the  external reality. Even more, it does not know which are these entities. The  device will try to find them based on the facilities of the sense organs, but  there is no guarantee that M-models have found all the entities and no  guarantee that the right YMs are associated to such entities. This is a basic  deficiency.    The camouflage and dissimulation are methods which use this deficiency. By  camouflage an entity is not discovered and by dissimulation M-models associate  a wrong YM to an entity.    Let's see another basic problem. Any model evolves to be harmonic with itself  and so, to be stable. This means that, after any change in the model, it has  to regain its stability. If a model has a disharmony, it has to correct itself  based on IR or based on an internal change (IR is not available in any  situation). Thus the model regains its stability, but in some cases the model  could be not suitable anymore to reflect the external reality. There are many  cases when a model is stable but its predictions associated with the external  reality are wrong.    We already defined reality as all the information that is or could be  generated by a model by simulation. The guarantee of a correct reality is the  stability of the model but the stability of the model is not a guarantee that  the model is capable to accurately reflect the associated external reality.    That is, there is no guarantee that all the entities of a given external  reality are discovered, there is no guarantee that the right YMs are  associated with these entities and so on. The stability of a model is just a  guarantee that all the available information is correlated in the right way.    There is another class of basic problems associated with the changes in a  model. If a model has to be changed, sometimes there are small chances to do  that. In fact, the only possibility is to make a new model from scratch, using  or not elements and relations from the old model. This activity could be  sometimes so complex that it can exceed the technical capacity of the brain.    Indeed, a new model must be accepted by the whole structure of models. That  is, any other model of the structure must accept any prediction of the new  model, so that the new structure is stable.    If the new model is good in interaction with the external reality but the  structure of the models is not good enough, then some other models of the  structure have to be changed too. As I said, this process can exceed the  brain's technical capacity of processing. This can be considered as a design  deficiency too.    This explains a lot of situations in common life, when logical arguments or  facts taken from external reality cannot change wrong models some people have.    As we know, a stable model is a model which correlates in a right way all the  available information. But, there is no guarantee that we gain enough  information to make the right model. This basic deficiency is attenuated by  the fact that there is a structure of models. The structure of models helps a  lot when we interact with a new external reality because it can make  predictions based on the previous interaction with other external realities.  On the other hand, the structure of models is like a brake for evolution if  the structure has problems.    Example: The astronomer Copernicus made a model of the Universe based on the  idea that the Sun is the center of the Universe, not Earth, as everybody knew  at the time. Around the year 1543, very few persons were able to change the  whole structure of models, based on this new model.    We continue with other basic problems and features.    In the normal activity of the brain, any ZM-model has full access to any model  of the brain. That is, a ZM model can correlate information from many M-type  models and from any other ZM of the brain. This is true for any ZM of the  brain.    In the complex interaction between a brain and the external reality, there is  a single ZM at a time, controlling that being. This ZM is called a local-ZM or  an active-ZM. A ZM can be changed to another in a dynamical way, so that the  being does many activities in time-sharing.    This activity is not simple. So, when a local-ZM is deactivated, it has to  store the conditions, to be able to resume when it takes control again. There  are problems associated with this activity. Some of the information can be  lost or the external reality may evolve in the mean time so that the stored  information will be of no use. In this way, any model, which takes control of  the being, has to initialize before being able to regain full control. This  activity of initialization is very complex and in some situations it might  contain errors. Thus, it is rather difficult to do many activities in time-  sharing.    There is also a basic problem associated with the term \"knowledge\". As we  know, the knowledge is associated with the predictions of a structure of  models.    So, the knowledge is associated with the structure of models and not with the  external reality, as we'd like it to be. We should never ever forget this  thing. Even more, knowledge is a non-sense if we do not declare the structure  of models.    Example: in any positive science, it is usual to say that something is true  based on a specified theory (model).        HOW M-ZM MODELS ARE MADE    For a given external reality, the brain makes a structure of models, using  information taken from the external reality or from other models.    We will see how this function works in a specified situation: how a new M-ZM  is made in interaction with a new external reality. This function is described  for a normal and mature brain. The term \"normal brain\" will be treated later.  Here, a \"normal brain\" is a brain, which is able to work as it was already  described in the section of hardware facilities. A mature brain is a brain,"]]]
