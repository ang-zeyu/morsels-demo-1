Mr. Direck  assisted manfully, and noted the respect that was given to Mr. Britling  and the shillings that fell to the men, with an intelligent detachment.  They touched their hats, they called Mr. Britling \"Sir.\" They examined  the car distantly but kindly. \"Ain't 'urt 'e, not a bit 'e ain't, not  really,\" said one encouragingly. And indeed except for a slight  crumpling of the mud-guard and the detachment of the wire of one of the  headlights the automobile was uninjured. Mr. Britling resumed his seat;  Mr. Direck gravely and in silence got up beside him. They started with  the usual convulsion, as though something had pricked the vehicle  unexpectedly and shamefully behind. And from this point Mr. Britling,  driving with meticulous care, got home without further mishap, excepting  only that he scraped off some of the metal edge of his footboard  against the gate-post of his very agreeable garden.    His family welcomed his safe return, visitor and all, with undisguised  relief and admiration. A small boy appeared at the corner of the house,  and then disappeared hastily again. \"Daddy's got back all right at  last,\" they heard him shouting to unseen hearers.      Section 8    Mr. Direck, though he was a little incommoded by the suppression of his  story about Robinson--for when he had begun a thing he liked to finish  it--found Mr. Britling's household at once thoroughly British, quite  un-American and a little difficult to follow. It had a quality that at  first he could not define at all. Compared with anything he had ever  seen in his life before it struck him as being--he found the word at  last--sketchy. For instance, he was introduced to nobody except his  hostess, and she was indicated to him by a mere wave of Mr. Britling's  hand. \"That's Edith,\" he said, and returned at once to his car to put it  away. Mrs. Britling was a tall, freckled woman with pretty bright brown  hair and preoccupied brown eyes. She welcomed him with a handshake, and  then a wonderful English parlourmaid--she at least was according to  expectations--took his grip-sack and guided him to his room. \"Lunch,  sir,\" she said, \"is outside,\" and closed the door and left him to that  and a towel-covered can of hot water.    It was a square-looking old red-brick house he had come to, very  handsome in a simple Georgian fashion, with a broad lawn before it and  great blue cedar trees, and a drive that came frankly up to the front  door and then went off with Mr. Britling and the car round to unknown  regions at the back. The centre of the house was a big airy hall,  oak-panelled, warmed in winter only by one large fireplace and abounding  in doors which he knew opened into the square separate rooms that  England favours. Bookshelves and stuffed birds comforted the landing  outside his bedroom. He descended to find the hall occupied by a small  bright bristling boy in white flannel shirt and knickerbockers and bare  legs and feet. He stood before the vacant open fireplace in an attitude  that Mr. Direck knew instantly was also Mr. Britling's. \"Lunch is in the  garden,\" the Britling scion proclaimed, \"and I've got to fetch you. And,  I say! is it true? Are you American?\"    \"Why surely,\" said Mr. Direck.    \"Well, I know some American,\" said the boy. \"I learnt it.\"    \"Tell me some,\" said Mr. Direck, smiling still more amiably.    \"Oh! Well--God darn you! Ouch, Gee-whizz! Soak him, Maud! It's up to  you, Duke....\"    \"Now where did you learn all that?\" asked Mr. Direck recovering.    \"Out of the Sunday Supplement,\" said the youthful Britling.    \"Why! Then you know all about Buster Brown,\" said Mr. Direck. \"He's  Fine--eh?\"    The Britling child hated Buster Brown. He regarded Buster Brown as a  totally unnecessary infant. He detested the way he wore his hair and the  peculiar cut of his knickerbockers and--him. He thought Buster Brown the  one drop of paraffin in the otherwise delicious feast of the Sunday  Supplement. But he was a diplomatic child.    \"I think I like Happy Hooligan better,\" he said. \"And dat ole Maud.\"    He reflected with joyful eyes, Buster clean forgotten. \"Every week,\" he  said, \"she kicks some one.\"    It came to Mr. Direck as a very pleasant discovery that a British infant  could find a common ground with the small people at home in these  characteristically American jests. He had never dreamt that the fine  wine of Maud and Buster could travel.    \"Maud's a treat,\" said the youthful Britling, relapsing into his native  tongue.    Mr. Britling appeared coming to meet them. He was now in a grey flannel  suit--he must have jumped into it--and altogether very much tidier....      Section 9    The long narrow table under the big sycamores between the house and the  adapted barn that Mr. Direck learnt was used for \"dancing and all that  sort of thing,\" was covered with a blue linen diaper cloth, and that too  surprised him. This was his first meal in a private household in  England, and for obscure reasons he had expected something very stiff  and formal with \"spotless napery.\" He had also expected a very stiff and  capable service by implacable parlourmaids, and the whole thing indeed  highly genteel. But two cheerful women servants appeared from what was  presumably the kitchen direction, wheeling a curious wicker erection,  which his small guide informed him was called Aunt Clatter--manifestly  deservedly--and which bore on its shelves the substance of the meal. And  while the maids at this migratory sideboard carved and opened bottles  and so forth, the small boy and a slightly larger brother, assisted a  little by two young men of no very defined position and relationship,  served the company. Mrs. Britling sat at the head of the table, and  conversed with Mr. Direck by means of hostess questions and imperfectly  accepted answers while she kept a watchful eye on the proceedings.    The composition of the company was a matter for some perplexity to Mr.  Direck. Mr. and Mrs. Britling were at either end of the table, that was  plain enough. It was also fairly plain that the two barefooted boys were  little Britlings. But beyond this was a cloud of uncertainty. There was  a youth of perhaps seventeen, much darker than Britling but with nose  and freckles rather like his, who might be an early son or a stepson; he  was shock-headed and with that look about his arms and legs that  suggests overnight growth; and there was an unmistakable young German,  very pink, with close-cropped fair hair, glasses and a panama hat, who  was probably the tutor of the younger boys. (Mr. Direck also was wearing  his hat, his mind had been filled with an exaggerated idea of the  treacheries of the English climate before he left New York. Every one  else was hatless.) Finally, before one reached the limits of the  explicable there was a pleasant young man with a lot of dark hair and  very fine dark blue eyes, whom everybody called \"Teddy.\" For him, Mr.  Direck hazarded \"secretary.\"    But in addition to these normal and understandable presences, there was  an entirely mysterious pretty young woman in blue linen who sat and  smiled next to Mr. Britling, and there was a rather kindred-looking girl  with darker hair on the right of Mr. Direck who impressed him at the  very outset as being still prettier, and--he didn't quite place her at  first--somehow familiar to him; there was a large irrelevant middle-aged  lady in black with a gold chain and a large nose, between Teddy and the  tutor; there was a tall middle-aged man with an intelligent face, who  might be a casual guest; there was an Indian young gentleman faultlessly  dressed up to his brown soft linen collar and cuffs, and thereafter an  uncontrolled outbreak of fine bronze modelling and abundant fuzzy hair;  and there was a very erect and attentive baby of a year or less, sitting  up in a perambulator and gesticulating cheerfully to everybody. This  baby it was that most troubled the orderly mind of Mr. Direck. The  research for its paternity made his conversation with Mrs. Britling  almost as disconnected and absent-minded as her conversation with him.  It almost certainly wasn't Mrs. Britling's. The girl next to him or the  girl next to Mr. Britling or the lady in black might any of them be  married, but if so where was the spouse? It seemed improbable that they  would wheel out a foundling to lunch....    Realising at last that the problem of relationship must be left to solve  itself if he did not want to dissipate and consume his mind entirely,  Mr. Direck turned to his hostess, who was enjoying a brief lull in her  administrative duties, and told her what a memorable thing the meeting  of Mr. Britling in his own home would be in his life, and how very  highly America was coming to esteem Mr. Britling and his essays. He  found that with a slight change of person, one of his premeditated  openings was entirely serviceable here. And he went on to observe that  it was novel and entertaining to find Mr. Britling driving his own  automobile and to note that it was an automobile of American  manufacture. In America they had standardised and systematised the  making of such things as automobiles to an extent that would, he  thought, be almost startling to Europeans. It was certainly startling to  the European manufacturers. In illustration of that he might tell a  little story of a friend of his called Robinson--a man who curiously  enough in general build and appearance was very reminiscent indeed of  Mr. Britling. He had been telling Mr. Britling as much on his way here  from the station. His friend was concerned with several others in one of  the biggest attacks that had ever been made upon what one might describe  in general terms as the thousand-dollar light automobile market. What  they said practically was this: This market is a jig-saw puzzle waiting  to be put together and made one. We are going to do it. But that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14064"],[0,"Mohammed, The Prophet of Islam (#4)"],[1,"Christians, the greater became his certainty. God was supreme and  omnipotent; of that there could be no doubt. But how to convince the  people was a difficulty that needed much careful thought and cautious  propagation. Jews and Christians could boast of prophets--of men  inspired to speak with the voice of God--but the Arabs had had no one  who had spoken with such authority. Why had they been so neglected?  Surely they needed to hear the Divine voice, and that need was never  greater than now, when all was unrest and dissention. Where was the  man who would fill the office? Who would be willing to face the odds,  and declare against evil by proclaiming the good and the true? Such  must have been the questions that exercised Mohammed's mind. Then came  the thought--\"Why should not I be the messenger?\" And this so grew  upon him that he was convinced of his \"call.\" The possession of this  idea made him sincere in his purpose at first, but after the tide had  turned in his favour, that sincerity was marred--nay, eclipsed--by an  inflated notion of self-importance, and a consuming ambition to which  every virtue and good feeling was subordinated, until at last he was  able, with superb arrogance, to bracket his name with Deity, making  the confession of his claim as important as the confession of the  Unity of God. Wherein his inconsistency and falsity is chiefly  apparent, for confession of Unity is insufficient without recognition  of Mohammed's apostleship!    Ascetic practices tend to lead to physical disorders, which generally  upset the mind and lead to mental and moral distemper. Judgment is  warped because the functions of the mind are thrown out of gear. The  varied departments of consciousness act with ungoverned caprice, with  the result that fantastical fancies and visions are interpreted to be  realties, which become misleading and deceptive. Thus may be explained  the visit of the Archangel Gabriel to Mohammed, but it can hardly be  conceived that it will account for the ingenious method of revelation  which he received. Some people believe it to have been inspired by  Satan; it must ever remain a matter of speculation.    The necessity of a _piecemeal_ revelation could not at this time have  been apparent to the prophet. But we may give him the credit of the  policy of abrogation which he afterwards adopted, for such a policy  was necessary to enable him to cover or justify his actions which,  like those of even the best of men, were marked by inconsistency.          III.--BIRTH OF THE ISLAMIC SOCIETY.      Being firmly convinced of his call, Mohammed, with characteristic  caution, began to propagate his principles, for years being content to  deal secretly with individuals, beginning with those of his own  household. His wife acknowledged and encouraged his claim, and  gradually he gathered around him an increasing circle of devoted  followers, some of whom had more confidence in him and his pretensions  than he had himself. This was particularly true of ABU BAKR, a rich  and popular merchant of Mecca, who, having acknowledged the claims of  the prophet, followed him with implicit obedience and unwavering  devotion. He threw himself whole-heartedly into the work of  proselytising, and the progress of early days, although slow, was  largely due to his indefatigable energy.    As the membership of the new society increased, rules were framed,  based upon the \"revelations\" which Mohammed now periodically received,  and each member was compelled to subscribe to the most stringent  regulations. Idolatry was strongly condemned and the unity of God  emphatically asserted. Certain Jewish and Christian religious  ordinances were imposed as a condition of membership, while unswerving  loyalty to the prophet was demanded. License was given to the members  to practice outwardly the old rites and ceremonies of Paganism, in  order to arouse no suspicion, but the existence of such a society, in  spite of all precautions, could not long remain unnoticed, and the  time came when the prophet and his followers were compelled to make  public confession of their faith. Persecution followed, in which the  poorer members suffered more than their richer brethren. Mohammed  himself received the protection of the head of his clan, and for eight  or ten years carried on a campaign of words. Margoliouth, in his life  of Mohammed, likens the prophet to a player in a game of cards, who,  having received a good hand, plays his cards with consummate skill. He  took advantage of every opportunity in strengthening his position, and  having a clear-cut policy before him, subordinated everything to its  furtherance. He was a powerful preacher, but owing to his ungovernable  temper, was not so successful in debate; hence he produced a  \"revelation\" forbidding him to engage in public controversy! He showed  great diligence in seeking information that enabled him to produce his  revelations in a style consistent with his claims. Being entirely  dependent on hearsay, he obtained but a sadly distorted account of  truth. The Koran is full of glaring errors, which, for centuries, have  baffled the ingenuity of the Moslem doctors. Yet the prophet  presumptuously claimed that his, being the last \"revelation,\" was the  most important, and more reliable, and the differences that were  apparent were due to the corruption in time of the text of the former  \"revelations\"--_i.e._, the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures!    He was evidently much perplexed by the divisions and controversies  that existed within the Christian Church, and considered that the  images and pictures then in use were little better than the idols of  his own people. With no means of testing and verifying his knowledge,  he accepted all that tended to enhance his own position, and his chief  regret seems to have been his inability, in reply to the taunts of his  enemies, to point to any element of the miraculous in his career. In  the revelations, he frequently expressed views and opinions which  flatly contradicted what he had formerly stated, and when challenged  as to his inconsistency, defended it by claiming that it was not he  who had changed his mind, but God, whose ways no man could question or  understand!    In time, the position of the new sect became so intolerable that many  were compelled to flee, and numbers went into Abyssinia, where they  were well received. Mohammed himself, thanks to his relatives'  protection, could still afford to remain in Mecca. In spite of the  opposition, his influence gradually increased, and was considerably  strengthened by the conversion of Omar, a citizen famed for his skill  in military strategy and courage. Not long afterwards, Khadijah, the  prophet's wife died. She had wielded a strong, healthy influence over  her husband, and had cheered him on in times of discouragement and  failure. Islam owes not a little to her life and influence, and were  it more widely recognised, might possibly lead to an improvement of  the position of the poor unfortunate daughters of the system, who are  enslaved and degraded to a saddening degree. After Khadijah's death,  Mohammed took full advantage of the polygamous sanctions of Paganism,  and even abused the privilege when it conflicted with his own  inclinations. Margoliouth attempts to defend the many marriages on the  ground of political expediency, which may be conceded in only a few  cases. In most instances they were due to selfish desire and  inordinate affection. Particularly is this true in the case of the  prophet's marriage with his adopted son's wife, which was a gross  violation of Arab law.    On the death of his protector, Mohammed was compelled to seek refuge  elsewhere, but not before he had made inconsistent concessions to the  pagan leaders. In these concessions he retreated entirely from the  strong iconoclastic attitude he had hitherto adopted, going so far as  to produce a revelation that claimed to reconcile the One True God to  the gods of the Pagan pantheon. This compromise, no matter how wise  and statesmanlike it may appear to be, clearly indicates the falsity  of Mohammed's claim, and enables us to estimate the value of his  pretensions. His action was strongly condemned by many of his  followers, and probably under the influence of their opinion, he  produced an apologetic revelation abrogating the concession, and  admitting it to have been a mistake!    He endeavoured to escape the persecution in Mecca by taking refuge in  Taif, but was so badly treated there when his views became known, that  he was glad to return, and upon promising to confine his proselytising  efforts to strangers, was allowed to stay under the protection of one  of the leading citizens. He carried on his work among strangers with  such success, that before long a strong community had grown up in the  town of Medinah. The rapid increase of this section of his disciples  may be accounted for by the very unsettled condition of the place.  Civil and religious strife had been for a long time aggravated by the  aggressive attitude of a large section of Jews, so that circumstances  were more favourable to the reception and growth of Islam than in  Mecca, where there was more peaceful organisation, and where the  existence of the ancient Kaaba, or dwelling place of the gods, made  men more jealous of their old religion.    In the appointment of a man to lead the new community, Mohammed  exhibited his characteristic insight into the abilities of men. He  selected a follower thoroughly convinced of his master's claims, whose  zeal in the earlier days had led him to forsake friends and family by  flight into Abyssinia--a man full of enthusiasm and energy. In a  comparatively short time the new religion became quite popular, and  idolatry was despised. An incident indicative of the progress is seen  in the visit of seventy of the Medinah disciples to Mohammed in Mecca.  They met him secretly in"]]]
