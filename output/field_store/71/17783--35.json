The various modifications of zinciferous flue ashes from blast furnaces  are an object for continual demand, being both a valuable material for the  production of zinc and, in its superior qualities, a desirable pigment. In  the regeneration of zinc the presence of foreign substances is of some  concern; detrimental are lead, sulphur, and sulphuric acid in form of  lead, zinc, and lime sulphate.    The chemico-technical analysis of these products has until recently been  confined to the volumetric determination of zinc by means of sodium  sulphide (Schaffner's method). But as a remnant of sulphur, as sulphuric  acid, in roasted blende causes a material loss during distillation, and  otherwise being induced to produce a zinc free of lead, the estimation of  sulphur, sulphuric acid, and lead became necessary. These impurities are  determined by well-known methods; sulphur is oxidized and precipitated  with barium chloride, lead by sulphuric acid and alcohol. The examination  of zinc dust, when used for the regeneration of metal, determines the  quantity of zinc resident therein, and employed as reducing agent, the  quantity of metal which causes the generation of hydrogen. Cadmium,  showing the same deportment, must also be considered as well as lead and  arsenic.    A most complete and rapidly working method for the examination of  zinciferous products has originated with the application of neutral  ammonium carbonate as solvent. A solution of this preparation is made,  according to H. Rose, by dissolving 230 grm. commercial ammon carbonate in  180 c.c. ammoniacal liquor of 0.92 s.g., and, by addition of water,  augmenting it to one liter.    This solution dissolves the metallic components, their oxides, and basic  zinc sulphate, and transfers cadmium and lead oxide, also lead, magnesium,  and lime sulphate, into insoluble carbonates. Iron and manganese, when  present as protoxide, are dissolved; of iron sesquioxide but traces, and  of cadmium oxide _in statu nascendi_ a small portion enter into solution.  The solution of ammonium carbonate contains in each 10 c.c. 1 grm.  ammonia, which dissolves 1.5 grm. zinc.    The sample for examination is moistened with water and mixed with an  adequate volume of the solvent, is digested at 50-60 deg. C. until complete  decomposition is effected. The heating of the liquid prevents the solution  of iron, manganese, and cadmium. The content, sediment and liquid, is  thrown on a filter and washed with hot water to which a small quantity of  the solvent has been added. When the solution contains iron and manganese,  it is separated by decantation from the sediment and oxidized with bromine  (according to the method of Nic-Wolff) until a flocculent precipitate of  iron sesquioxide and manganese dioxide becomes visible; it is united with  the original residue and filtered.    The filtrate is diluted till it appears cloudy, boiled to expel ammonia,  tested with sodium sulphide upon the presence of zinc, and, when freed of  all zinc, decanted. The precipitate of zinc carbonate is filtered,  exhausted with water, transferred into zinc oxide by ignition, and  weighed. The gravimetric method can be substituted by the volumetric by  introducing a solution of sodium sulphide of known strength into the  ammoniacal filtrate. On dividing the filtered liquid into various equal  portions other substances, arsenic and sulphuric acid, can be determined  from the same sample. For this purpose the filtrate is concentrated;  divided into two equal portions, one of which is acidified and treated  with hydrogen sulphide for the determination of arsenic, the other is  acidified and used for the estimation of sulphuric acid by means of barium  chloride. The original residue is dissolved in muriatic or acetic acid and  filtered. The lead of the filtered liquid is thrown down by sulphuric  acid, and alcohol, and cadmium, after dissipation of alcohol into gas,  precipitated by hydrogen sulphide. Iron, manganese, alumina, and other  substances present in the solution are determined by known methods.    It is manifest that the determination of substances--zinc, lead, and  sulphuric acid--which are of importance in technical analysis of zinc ash,  can be executed by this method within a comparatively short time. The  application of ammonium carbonate as solvent has the advantage, over the  application of ammonia, that it is a far better solvent, that it  decomposes insoluble basic sulphates, and that the remaining carbonates  are readily dissolved by acids.    The decomposition of zinc dust is accompanied by a lively evolution of  gas; it is therefore necessary to continue the digestion of the sample  till no more hydrogen is given off. Zinc dust contains both metals and  their oxides, and methods which, from the volume of hydrogen generated,  determine indirectly the percentage of metallic zinc do not give the real  composition of the zinc dust. For the determination of the metallic  components the material is digested with a solution of copper sulphate,  which dissolves zinc and cadmium; the liquid is filtered, acidified, and  decomposed with hydrogen sulphide, or treated with a solution of ammonium  carbonate. The use of cupric chloride is not advisable, as it corrodes  lead, and gives rise to the formation of soluble chloride of lead, which  complicates the separation of zinc from cadmium. The best mode of  operation is the following: Both copper sulphate and zinc dust are weighed  separately, the former is dissolved in water and the latter introduced  into the solution of copper sulphate in small portions until it appears  colorless. During the operation the vessel is freely shaken, lumps are  comminuted with a glass rod, and a few drops of the liquid are ultimately  tested with hydrogen sulphide or ammonia. The remainder of zinc dust is  then weighed, and its value deducted from the original weight. Zinc and  cadmium of the filtrate are determined as above. On repeating this method  several times most satisfactory results are obtained.    Another mode of operating is to employ an excess of copper sulphate and to  determine the copper dissolved in the filtrate. The separation of copper  from cadmium being difficult and laborious, and the volumetric estimation  with potassium cyanide not practicable, it is not prudent to apply this  method.    When calcined zinciferous pyrites have to be examined, the estimation of  zinc is similar to that employed in the analysis of zinc ore. The sample  is exhausted with water, filtered, and, to eliminate calcium sulphate and  basic iron sulphate, evaporated to dryness. It is then dissolved in a  small quantity of alcohol and water, refiltered, and the filtrate  decomposed with ammonium carbonate. The original residue is treated with a  solution of ammonium carbonate, which dissolves arsenious acid and basic  zinc sulphate, filtered, and united with the first filtrate. When iron and  manganese are present, the filtrates are treated with bromine. The united  filtrates are boiled or examined volumetrically with sodium sulphide.           *       *       *       *       *          PETROLEUM AS FUEL IN LOCOMOTIVE ENGINES.[2]    [Footnote 2: Abstract of paper read before the Institution of Mechanical  Engineers.]    By Mr. THOMAS URQUHART.      Comparing naphtha refuse and anthracite, the former has a theoretical  evaporative power of 16.2 lb. of water per lb. of fuel, and the latter of  12.2 lb., at a pressure of 8 atm. or 120 lb. per square inch; hence  petroleum has, weight for weight, 33 per cent. higher evaporative value  than anthracite. Now in locomotive practice a mean evaporation of from 7  lb. to 71/2 lb. of water per lb. of anthracite is about what is generally  obtained, thus giving about 60 per cent. efficiency, while 40 per cent. of  the heating power is unavoidably lost. But with petroleum an evaporation  of 12.25 lb. is practically obtained, giving 12.25/16.2 = 75 per cent.  efficiency. Thus in the first place petroleum is theoretically 33 per  cent. superior to anthracite in evaporative power; and secondly, its  useful effect is 25 per cent. greater, being 75 percent. instead of 60  percent.; while, thirdly, weight for weight, the practical evaporative  value of petroleum must be reckoned as at least from (12.25 - 7.50)/7.50 =  63 per cent. to (12.25 - 7.00)/7.00 = 75 per cent. higher than that of  anthracite.    _Spray injector._--Steam not superheated, being the most convenient for  injecting the spray of liquid fuel into the furnace, it remains to be  proved how far superheated steam or compressed air is really superior to  ordinary saturated steam, taken from the highest point inside the boiler  by a special internal pipe. In using several systems of spray injectors  for locomotives, the author invariably noticed the impossibility of  preventing leakage of tubes, accumulation of soot, and inequality of  heating of the fire box. The work of a locomotive boiler is very different  from that of a marine or stationary boiler, owing to the frequent changes  of gradient on the line, and the frequent stoppages at stations. These  conditions render firing with petroleum very difficult; and were it not  for the part played by properly arranged brickwork inside the fire box,  the spray jet alone would be quite inadequate. Hitherto the efforts of  engineers have been mainly directed toward arriving at the best kind of  \"spray injector,\" for so minutely subdividing a jet of petroleum into a  fine spray, by the aid of steam or compressed air, as to render it  inflammable and of easy ignition. For this object nearly all the known  spray injectors have very long and narrow orifices for petroleum as well  as for steam; the width of the orifices does not exceed from 1/2 mm. to 2  mm. or 0.02 in. to 0."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14"],[0,"The 1990 CIA World Factbook (#4)"],[1," grounds    Member of: ADB, CCC, Colombo Plan, ESCAP, FAO, G-77, IAEA, IBRD, ICAO,  IDA, IDB--Islamic Development Bank, IFAD, IFC, ILO, IMF, INTELSAT, ITU, NAM, UN,  UNESCO, UPU, WFTU, WHO, WMO, WTO, WSG; suspended from OIC in January 1980    Diplomatic representation: Minister-Counselor, Charge d'Affaires MIAGOL;  Chancery at 2341 Wyoming Avenue NW, Washington DC 20008; telephone  (202) 234-3770 or 3771; US--Charge d'Affaires (vacant);  Embassy at Ansari Wat, Wazir Akbar Khan Mina, Kabul; telephone 62230 through  62235 or 62436; note--US Embassy in Kabul was closed in January 1989    Flag: three equal horizontal bands of black (top), red, and green with the  national coat of arms superimposed on the hoist side of the black and red bands;  similar to the flag of Malawi which is shorter and bears a radiant, rising, red  sun centered in the black band    - Economy  Overview: Fundamentally, Afghanistan is an extremely poor, landlocked  country, highly dependent on farming (wheat especially) and livestock  raising (sheep and goats). Economic considerations, however, have played  second fiddle to political and military upheavals, including the nine-year  Soviet military occupation (ended 15 February 1989) and the continuing  bloody civil war. Over the past decade, one-third of the population has  fled the country, with Pakistan sheltering some 3 million refugees  and Iran perhaps 2 million. Another 1 million have probably  moved into and around urban areas within Afghanistan. Large numbers  of bridges, buildings, and factories have been destroyed or  damaged by military action or sabotage. Government claims  to the contrary, gross domestic product almost certainly is  lower than 10 years ago because of the loss of labor and capital  and the disruption of trade and transport.
