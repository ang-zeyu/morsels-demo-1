A salient  characteristic is their brevity. They constitute the kernel of a vast  range of law that will arise in centuries to come. This elaboration of the  law will be enacted by the Universal House of Justice under the authority  conferred upon it by Baha'u'llah Himself. In one of His Tablets  'Abdu'l-Baha elucidates this principle:          Those matters of major importance which constitute the foundation      of the Law of God are explicitly recorded in the Text, but      subsidiary laws are left to the House of Justice. The wisdom of      this is that the times never remain the same, for change is a      necessary quality and an essential attribute of this world, and of      time and place. Therefore the House of Justice will take action      accordingly...        Briefly, this is the wisdom of referring the laws of society to      the House of Justice. In the religion of Islam, similarly, not      every ordinance was explicitly revealed; nay not a tenth part of a      tenth part was included in the Text; although all matters of major      importance were specifically referred to, there were undoubtedly      thousands of laws which were unspecified. These were devised by      the divines of a later age according to the laws of Islamic      jurisprudence, and individual divines made conflicting deductions      from the original revealed ordinances. All these were enforced.      Today this process of deduction is the right of the body of the      House of Justice, and the deductions and conclusions of individual      learned men have no authority, unless they are endorsed by the      House of Justice. The difference is precisely this, that from the      conclusions and endorsements of the body of the House of Justice      whose members are elected by and known to the worldwide Baha'i      community, no differences will arise; whereas the conclusions of      individual divines and scholars would definitely lead to      differences, and result in schism, division, and dispersion. The      oneness of the Word would be destroyed, the unity of the Faith      would disappear, and the edifice of the Faith of God would be      shaken.      Although the Universal House of Justice is explicitly authorized to change  or repeal its own legislation as conditions change, thus providing Baha'i  law with an essential element of flexibility, it cannot abrogate or change  any of the laws which are explicitly laid down in the sacred Text.    The society for which certain of the laws of the Aqdas are designed will  come only gradually into being, and Baha'u'llah has provided for the  progressive application of Baha'i law:          Indeed, the laws of God are like unto the ocean and the children      of men as fish, did they but know it. However, in observing them      one must exercise tact and wisdom... Since most people are feeble      and far-removed from the purpose of God, therefore one must      observe tact and prudence under all conditions, so that nothing      might happen that could cause disturbance and dissension or raise      clamour among the heedless. Verily, His bounty hath surpassed the      whole universe and His bestowals encompassed all that dwell on      earth. One must guide mankind to the ocean of true understanding      in a spirit of love and tolerance. The Kitab-i-Aqdas itself      beareth eloquent testimony to the loving providence of God.      The principle governing this progressive application was enunciated in a  letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to a National Spiritual  Assembly in 1935:          The laws revealed by Baha'u'llah in the Aqdas are, whenever      practicable and not in direct conflict with the Civil Law of the      land, absolutely binding on every believer or Baha'i institution      whether in the East or in the West. Certain ... laws should be      regarded by all believers as universally and vitally applicable at      the present time. Others have been formulated in anticipation of a      state of society destined to emerge from the chaotic conditions      that prevail today... What has not been formulated in the Aqdas,      in addition to matters of detail and of secondary importance      arising out of the application of the laws already formulated by      Baha'u'llah, will have to be enacted by the Universal House of      Justice. This body can supplement but never invalidate or modify      in the least degree what has already been formulated by      Baha'u'llah. Nor has the Guardian any right whatsoever to lessen      the binding effect much less to abrogate the provisions of so      fundamental and sacred a Book.      The number of laws binding on Baha'is is not increased by the publication  of this translation. When it is deemed timely, the Baha'i community will  be advised which additional laws are binding upon believers, and any  guidance or supplementary legislation necessary for their application will  be provided.    In general, the laws of the Kitab-i-Aqdas are stated succinctly. An  example of this conciseness can be seen in the fact that many are  expressed only as they apply to a man, but it is apparent from the  Guardian's writings that, where Baha'u'llah has given a law as between a  man and a woman, it applies mutatis mutandis between a woman and a man  unless the context makes this impossible. For example, the text of the  Kitab-i-Aqdas forbids a man to marry his father's wife (i.e. his  stepmother), and the Guardian has indicated that likewise a woman is  forbidden to marry her stepfather. This understanding of the implications  of the Law has far-reaching effects in light of the fundamental Baha'i  principle of the equality of the sexes, and should be borne in mind when  the sacred Text is studied. That men and women differ from one another in  certain characteristics and functions is an inescapable fact of nature and  makes possible their complementary roles in certain areas of the life of  society; but it is significant that 'Abdu'l-Baha has stated that in this  Dispensation \"Equality of men and women, except in some negligible  instances, has been fully and categorically announced.\"    Mention has already been made of the intimate relationship between the  Kitab-i-Aqdas and the Holy Books of previous Dispensations. Especially  close is the relationship to the Bayan, the Book of Laws revealed by the  Bab. It is elucidated in the following excerpts from letters written on  behalf of the Guardian:          Shoghi Effendi feels that the unity of the Baha'i Revelation as      one complete whole embracing the Faith of the Bab should be      emphasized... The Faith of the Bab should not be divorced from      that of Baha'u'llah. Though the teachings of the Bayan have been      abrogated and superseded by the laws of the Aqdas, yet due to the      fact that the Bab considered Himself as the Forerunner of      Baha'u'llah, we would regard His Dispensation together with that      of Baha'u'llah as forming one entity, the former being      introductory to the advent of the latter.        The Bab states that His laws are provisional and depend upon the      acceptance of the future Manifestation. This is why in the Book of      Aqdas Baha'u'llah sanctions some of the laws found in the Bayan,      modifies others and sets aside many.      Just as the Bayan had been revealed by the Bab at about the mid-point of  His Ministry, Baha'u'llah revealed the Kitab-i-Aqdas around 1873, some  twenty years after He had received, in the Siyah-C{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}h{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}al of Tihran, the  intimation of His Revelation. In one of His Tablets He indicates that even  after its revelation the Aqdas was withheld by Him for some time before it  was sent to the friends in Iran. Thereafter, as Shoghi Effendi has  related:          The formulation by Baha'u'llah, in His Kitab-i-Aqdas, of the      fundamental laws of His Dispensation was followed, as His Mission      drew to a close, by the enunciation of certain precepts and      principles which lie at the very core of His Faith, by the      reaffirmation of truths He had previously proclaimed, by the      elaboration and elucidation of some of the laws He had already      laid down, by the revelation of further prophecies and warnings,      and by the establishment of subsidiary ordinances designed to      supplement the provisions of His Most Holy Book. These were      recorded in unnumbered Tablets, which He continued to reveal until      the last days of His earthly life...      Among such works is the Questions and Answers, a compilation made by  Zaynu'l-Muqarrabin, the most eminent of the transcribers of Baha'u'llah's  Writings. Consisting of answers revealed by Baha'u'llah to questions put  to Him by various believers, it constitutes an invaluable appendix to the  Kitab-i-Aqdas. In 1978 the most noteworthy of the other Tablets of this  nature were published in English as a compilation entitled Tablets of  Baha'u'llah revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas.    Some years after the revelation of the Kitab-i-Aqdas, Baha'u'llah had  manuscript copies sent to Baha'is in Iran, and in the year 1308 A.H.  (1890-91 A.D.), towards the end of His life, He arranged for the  publication of the original Arabic text of the Book in Bombay.    A word should be said about the style of language in which the  Kitab-i-Aqdas has been rendered into English. Baha'u'llah enjoyed a superb  mastery of Arabic, and preferred to use it in those Tablets and other  Writings where its precision of meaning was particularly appropriate to  the exposition of basic principle. Beyond the choice of language itself,  however, the style employed is of an exalted and emotive character,  immensely compelling, particularly to those familiar with the great  literary tradition out of which it arose.

CHAPTER I.  1852      Voyage to India--Life in Calcutta--A destructive cyclone    --Home-sickness      Forty years ago the departure of a cadet for India was a much more  serious affair than it is at present. Under the regulations then in  force, leave, except on medical certificate, could only be obtained  once during the whole of an officer's service, and ten years had to be  spent in India before that leave could be taken. Small wonder, then,  that I felt as if I were bidding England farewell for ever when, on  the 20th February, 1852, I set sail from Southampton with Calcutta for  my destination. Steamers in those days ran to and from India but once  a month, and the fleet employed was only capable of transporting some  2,400 passengers in the course of a year. This does not include the  Cape route; but even taking that into consideration, I should doubt  whether there were then as many travellers to India in a year as there  are now in a fortnight at the busy season.    My ship was the Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamer _Ripon_,  commanded by Captain Moresby, an ex-officer of the Indian Navy, in  which he had earned distinction by his survey of the Red Sea. A few  Addiscombe friends were on board, leaving England under the same  depressing circumstances as myself, and what with wind and weather,  and the thought that at the best we were bidding farewell to home and  relations for ten long years, we were anything but a cheerful party  for the first few days of the voyage. Youth and high spirits had,  however, re-asserted themselves long before Alexandria, which place  we reached without incident beyond the customary halts for coaling at  Gibraltar and Malta. At Alexandria we bade adieu to Captain Moresby,  who had been most kind and attentive, and whose graphic accounts  of the difficulties he had had to overcome whilst mastering the  navigation of the Red Sea served to while away many a tedious hour.    On landing at Alexandria, we were hurried on board a large mast-less  canal boat, shaped like a Nile dahabeah. In this we were towed up the  Mahmoudieh canal for ten hours, until we arrived at Atfieh, on the  Nile; thence we proceeded by steamer, reaching Cairo in about sixteen  hours. Here we put up at Shepherd's Hotel for a couple of days, which  were most enjoyable, especially to those of the party who, like  myself, saw an eastern city and its picturesque and curious bazaars  for the first time. From Cairo the route lay across the desert for  ninety miles, the road being merely a cutting in the sand, quite  undistinguishable at night. The journey was performed in a conveyance  closely resembling a bathing-machine, which accommodated six people,  and was drawn by four mules. My five fellow-travellers were all  cadets, only one of whom (Colonel John Stewart, of Ardvorlich,  Perthshire) is now alive. The transit took some eighteen hours, with  an occasional halt for refreshments. Our baggage was carried on  camels, as were the mails, cargo, and even the coal for the Red Sea  steamers.    On arrival at Suez we found awaiting us the _Oriental_, commanded by  Captain Powell. A number of people met us there who had left England  a month before we did; but their steamer having broken down, they had  now to be accommodated on board ours. We were thus very inconveniently  crowded until we arrived at Aden, where several of the passengers left  us for Bombay. We were not, however, much inclined to complain, as  some of our new associates proved themselves decided acquisitions.  Amongst them was Mr. (afterwards Sir Barnes) Peacock, an immense  favourite with all on board, and more particularly with us lads. He  was full of fun, and although then forty-seven years old, and on his  way to Calcutta to join the Governor-General's Council, he took part  in our amusements as if he were of the same age as ourselves. His  career in India was brilliant, and on the expiration of his term of  office as member of Council he was made Chief Justice of Bengal.  Another of the passengers was Colonel (afterwards Sir John Bloomfield)  Gough, who died not long ago in Ireland, and was then on his way to  take up his appointment as Quartermaster-General of Queen's troops. He  had served in the 3rd Light Dragoons and on the staff of his cousin,  Lord Gough, during the Sutlej and Punjab campaigns, and was naturally  an object of the deepest veneration to all the youngsters on board.    At Madras we stopped to land passengers, and I took this opportunity  of going on shore to see some old Addiscombe friends, most of whom  were greatly excited at the prospect of a war in Burma. The transports  were then actually lying in the Madras roads, and a few days later  this portion of the expedition started for Rangoon.    At last, on the 1st April, we reached Calcutta, and I had to say  good-bye to the friends I had made during the six weeks' voyage, most  of whom I was never to meet again.    On landing, I received a letter from my father, who commanded the  Lahore division, informing me that the proprietor of Spence's Hotel  had been instructed to receive me, and that I had better put up there  until I reported myself at the Head-Quarters of the Bengal Artillery  at Dum-Dum. This was chilling news, for I was the only one of our  party who had to go to a hotel on landing. The Infantry cadets had  either been taken charge of by the Town Major, who provided them with  quarters in Fort William, or had gone to stay with friends, and the  only other Artilleryman (Stewart) went direct to Dum-Dum, where he  had a brother, also a gunner, who, poor follow, was murdered with his  young wife five years later by the mutineers at Gwalior. I was still  more depressed later on by finding myself at dinner _tete-a-tete_  with a first-class specimen of the results of an Indian climate.  He belonged to my own regiment, and was going home on medical  certificate, but did not look as if he could ever reach England. He  gave me the not too pleasing news that by staying in that dreary  hotel, instead of proceeding direct to Dum-Dum, I had lost a day's  service and pay, so I took care to join early the following morning.    A few years before, Dum-Dum had been a large military station, but  the annexation of the Punjab, and the necessity for maintaining  a considerable force in northern India, had greatly reduced the  garrison. Even the small force that remained had embarked for Burma  before my arrival, so that, instead of a large, cheery mess party, to  which I had been looking forward, I sat down to dinner with only one  other subaltern.    No time was lost in appointing me to a Native Field Battery, and I  was put through the usual laboratory course as a commencement to my  duties. The life was dull in the extreme, the only variety being an  occasional week in Fort William, where my sole duty was to superintend  the firing of salutes. Nor was there much in my surroundings to  compensate for the prosaic nature of my work. Fort William was not  then what it has since become--one of the healthiest stations  in India. Quite the contrary. The men were crowded into small  badly-ventilated buildings, and the sanitary arrangements were as  deplorable as the state of the water supply. The only efficient  scavengers were the huge birds of prey called adjutants, and so  great was the dependence placed upon the exertions of these unclean  creatures, that the young cadets were warned that any injury done to  them would be treated as gross misconduct. The inevitable result of  this state of affairs was endemic sickness, and a death-rate of over  ten per cent. per annum.[1]    Calcutta outside the Fort was but a dreary place to fall back upon. It  was wretchedly lighted by smoky oil-lamps set at very rare intervals.  The slow and cumbrous palankin was the ordinary means of conveyance,  and, as far as I was concerned, the vaunted hospitality of the  Anglo-Indian was conspicuous by its absence.    I must confess I was disappointed at being left so completely to  myself, especially by the senior military officers, many of whom were  personally known to my father, who had, I was aware, written to some  of them on my behalf. Under these circumstances, I think it is hardly  to be wondered at that I became terribly home-sick, and convinced  that I could never be happy in India. Worst of all, the prospects of  promotion seemed absolutely hopeless; I was a supernumerary Second  Lieutenant, and nearly every officer in the list of the Bengal  Artillery had served over fifteen years as a subaltern. This  stagnation extended to every branch of the Indian Army.    There were singularly few incidents to enliven this unpromising stage  of my career. I do, however, remember one rather notable experience  which came to me at that time, in the form of a bad cyclone. I was  dining out on the night in question. Gradually the wind grew higher  and higher, and it became evident that we were in for a storm of no  ordinary kind. Consequently, I left my friend's house early. A Native  servant, carrying a lantern, accompanied me to light me on my way. At  an angle of the road a sudden gust of wind extinguished the light. The  servant, who, like most Natives, was quite at home in the dark, walked  on,"]]]
