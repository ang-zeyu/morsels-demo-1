Coupled with such arguments, which were constantly  used by missionaries in the early part of this century, before their  enthusiasm was cooled by experience, were calculations that appealed  strongly to the commercial instincts of people in England. A dozen  colonial farmers required something like a hundred square miles of  land for their cattle runs; on this same ground, under missionary  supervision, three or four hundred families of blacks could exist;  these blacks would shortly need large quantities of manufactured  goods; and thus it would be to the interest of trade to encourage  them rather than the colonists. 'Already,' said they, 'after only a  few years' training, many blacks can read as well or better than the  ordinary colonists, and are exhibiting a decided taste for  civilization.'    There was thus a broad line of demarcation between the colonists and  such of the missionaries as held these views, and the tendency on  each side was to make it still broader. It was deepened into positive  antipathy towards those missionaries who, following Dr. Vanderkemp's  example, united themselves in marriage with black women, and  proclaimed themselves the champions of the black population against  the white. Everyone acquainted with South African natives knows how  ready they are to please their friends by bringing forward charges  against anyone whom those friends dislike. Unfortunately the  missionaries Vanderkemp and Read were deceived into believing a great  number of charges of cruelty made against various colonists, which a  little observation would have shown in most instances to be  groundless; and thereupon they lodged accusations before the High  Court of Justice. In 1811 between seventy and eighty such cases came  before the Circuit Court for trial. There was hardly a family on the  frontier of which some relative was not brought as a criminal before  the judges to answer to a charge of murder or violent assault.  Several months were occupied in the trials, and more than a thousand  witnesses were examined, but in every instance the most serious  charges were proved to be without foundation. Only a few convictions,  and those of no very outrageous crimes, resulted from these  prosecutions, which kept the entire colony in a ferment until long  after the circuit was closed.    Thus far everyone will approve of the sentiments of one party or the  other according to his sympathy, but in what follows no unprejudiced  person who will take the trouble to study the matter thoroughly can  acquit the anti-colonial missionaries of something more faulty than  mere error of judgment. For years their writings teemed with charges  against the colonists similar to those they had brought before the  High Court of Justice. These writings were circulated widely in  Europe, where the voice of the colonists was never heard, and they  created impressions there which no refutation made in South Africa  could ever counteract. The acts, the language, even the written  petitions of the colonists, were so distorted in accounts sent home,  that these accounts cannot now be read by those who have made  themselves acquainted with the truth, without the liveliest feelings  of indignation being excited.    The colonists learned that in England they were regarded as cruel  barbarians because they refused to permit Hottentot herds, swarming  with vermin, to be seated in their front rooms at the time of family  prayer. They found themselves pictured as the harshest of  taskmasters, as unfeeling violators of native rights. And of late  years it had become plain to them that the views of their opponents  were being acted upon at the Colonial Office, while their complaints  were wholly disregarded.    Several causes of dissatisfaction, besides those above mentioned,  contributed to the impulse of emigration, but all in a very slight  degree. Judge Cloete, in his 'Five Lectures,' mentions the severe  punishment inflicted upon the frontier insurgents of 1815 as one of  them; and there is no doubt that it was so with some families, though  no trace of it can be found in the correspondence of the emigrants.  The substitution in 1827 of the English for the Dutch language in the  colonial courts of law was certainly generally felt as a grievance.  The alteration in 1813 of the system of land tenure, the redemption  in 1825 of the paper currency at only thirty-six hundredths of its  nominal value, and the abolition in 1827 of the courts of landdrost  and heemraden, unquestionably caused much dissatisfaction, though all  of these measures are now admitted by everyone to have been  beneficial. The long delay in issuing titles to farms, the cost of  which has been paid to Government years before, is mentioned as a  grievance in some of the declarations.    Two parties--men, women, and children--numbering ninety-eight in all,  pioneered the great trek; of these twenty-six survived fever and  fighting, loss of provisions, waggons, and cattle, and a long weary  tramp from Zoutpansberg to Delagoa Bay, and were rescued and taken  thence to Natal, and two children were carried off by the natives.  The survivors were three women with their twelve children--seven  orphan children and four youths. Not a single grown man escaped.    During the winter of 1836 preparations for emigration were being made  over the eastern and midland districts. The Governor was perfectly  helpless in the matter. The Attorney-General, Mr. A. Oliphant, was  consulted by the Governor, and gave his opinion that 'it seemed next  to an impossibility to prevent persons passing out of the colony by  laws in force, or by any which could be framed.' On August 19 Sir  Benjamin D'Urban wrote to the Lieutenant-Governor, Sir Andries  Stockenstrom, that 'he could see no means of stopping the emigration,  except by persuasion, and attention to the wants and necessities of  the farmers.' In that direction the Governor had done all that was in  his power, but he could not act in opposition to the instructions of  the Secretary of State. Sir Andries Stockenstrom himself, in replying  to an address from the inhabitants of Uitenhage, stated that 'he  was not aware of any law which prevented any of his Majesty's  subjects from leaving his dominions and settling in another country;  and such a law, if it did exist, would be tyrannical and  oppressive.'    The story of the trekkers is one of surpassing interest, and must  enlist for them the sympathy and unbounded admiration of all.    By the middle of the year 1837 there were over one thousand waggons  between the Caledon and Vaal rivers--truly a notable and alarming  exodus; and the Boers then began the work of carving out new  countries for themselves. Their history surpasses all fiction in its  vicissitudes, successes, and tragedies. They fought and worked and  trekked, onward, always onward--never returning--on beyond the  furthermost outposts of civilization.    And so the story rolls on, gaining pathos, but losing no whit of  interest from its eternal sameness. They fought, and worked, and  starved, and died for their land of promise, where they might hope to  be alone, like the simple people of their one Book; where they might  never know the hated British rule; where they might never experience  the forms and trammels, the restlessness and changes, the worries,  the necessities or benefits, of progressing civilization. Their  quarrel had been with the abuses and blunders of one Government; but  a narrow experience moved them to mistrust all but their own pastoral  patriarchal way, moulded on the records of the Bible, and to regard  the evidences of progress as warnings of coming oppression and  curtailment of liberty, and a departure from the simple and ideal  way. The abuses from which they suffered are no more; the methods  which were unjust have been abandoned; the ignorance of the ruler has  been dispelled; in place of despotism there is autonomy; justice  rules where ignorance and bias sat; liberty where there was  interference; protection for oppression; progress and civilization  have increased as in no other epoch; and the nation and Government  from which they severed themselves have taken their place in the very  forefront of all. But the Boer sees with the eyes of sixty years ago!    The ideal was impossible, the struggle hopeless, the end certain.  They trekked, and trekked and trekked again; but the flag of  England--emblem of all they hated--was close by; behind, beside,  in front, or over them; and the something which they could not  fight--the ever-advancing tide of civilization--lapped at their  feet, and slowly, silently, and for ever blotted out the line where  they had written, 'Thus far and no further.'    The South African Republic had been in existence as an independent  State for twelve years when it reached that condition of insolvency  which appeared to invite, or at least justify, annexation, as the  only alternative to complete ruin and chaos. And there are very few,  even among the most uncompromising supporters of the Boers, who  seriously attempt to show that the Transvaal had any prospect of  prolonging its existence as an independent State for more than a few  months when Sir Theophilus Shepstone annexed it in 1877. The  following picture is from a book published by the late Alfred  Aylward, the Fenian, more anti-British than the Boer himself, who was  present at the time, and wrote his book in order to enlist sympathy  for the movement then (1878) organized to obtain a cancellation of  the annexation. The value of Aylward's testimony would not be fairly  appreciated without some explanation.    Sir Bartle Frere describes him (and quotes Scotland Yard authorities  who knew him well) as one of the party who murdered the policeman at  Manchester,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16496"],[0,"Chronicles (1 of 6): The Historie of England (1 of 8) (#4)"],[1,"Lestrigo that oppressed Italie, vnder  subiection of him & other of his brethren the sons also of Neptune;  as well Albion as Bergion assembling their powers togither, passed  ouer into Gallia, to stoppe the passage of Hercules, whose intention  was to vanquish and destroie those tyrants the sonnes of Neptune, &  their complices that kept diuers countries and regions vnder the  painefull yoke of their heauie thraldome.    [Sidenote: The cause why Hercules pursued his cousins.]  The cause that moued Hercules thus to pursue vpon those tyrants now  reigning thus in the world, was, for that not long before, the greatest  part of them had conspired togither and slaine his father Osiris,  notwithstanding that they were nephues to the same Osiris, as sonnes to  his brother Neptune, and not contented with his slaughter, they diuided  his carcase also amongst them, so that each of them got a peece in token  of reioising at their murtherous atchiued enterprise.    For this cause Hercules (whome Moses calleth Laabin) proclamed warres  against them all in reuenge of his fathers death: and first he killed  Triphon and Busiris in Aegypt, then Anteus in Mauritania, & the Gerions  in Spaine, which enterprise atchined, he led his armie towardes Italie,  and by the way passed through a part of Gallia, where Albion and Bergion  [Sidenote: _Pomp. Mela._]  hauing vnited their powers togither, were readie to receiue him with  battell: and so neere to the mouth of the riuer called Rhosne, in Latine  _Rhodanus_, they met & fought. At the first there was a right terrible  and cruell conflict betwixt them. And albeit that Hercules had the  greatest number of men, yet was it verie doubtfull a great while, to  whether part the glorie of that daies worke would bend. Whereupon when  the victorie began outright to turne vnto Albion, and to his brother  Bergion, Hercules perceiuing the danger and likelihood of vtter losse  of that battell, speciallie for that his men had wasted their weapons,  he caused those that stood still and were not otherwise occupied, to  stoope downe, and to gather vp stones, whereof in that place there was  great plentie, which by his commandement they bestowed so freelie vpon  [Sidenote: Hercules discomfiteith his enimies. Albion is slaine.]  their enimies, that in the end hee obteined the victorie, and did not  only put his adversaries to flight, but also slue Albion there in the  field, togither with his brother Bergion, and the most part of all their  whole armie. This was the end of Albion, and his brother Bergion, by the  valiant prowesse of Hercules, who as one appointed by Gods prouidence to  subdue the cruell & vnmercifull tyrants, spent his time to the benefit  of mankind, deliuering the oppressed from the heauie yoke of miserable  thraldome, in euerie place where he came.    [Sidenote: The occasion of the fable of Jupiter helping his son Hercules.]  And by the order of this battell wee maye learne whereof the poets had  their inuention, when they faine in their writings, that Jupiter holpe  his sonne Hercules, by throwing downe stones from heauen in this battell  against Albion and Bergion. Moreouer, from henceforth was this Ile of  [Sidenote: How this Ile was called Albion, of the giant Albion.  _Iohn Bale_.]  Britaine called Albion (as before we haue said) after the name of the  said Albion: because he was established chiefe ruler and king thereof  both by his grandfather Osiris and his father Neptune that cunning  sailour reigning therein (as Bale saith) by the space of 44. yeares, till  finally he was slaine in maner afore remembred by his vncle Hercules  Libicus.    After that Hercules had thus vanquished and destroied his enimies, hee  passed to and fro thorough Gallia, suppressing the tyrants in euerie  part where he came, and restoring the people vnto a reasonable kinde of  libertie, vnder lawfull gouernours. This Hercules (as we find) builded  the citie Alexia in Burgongne, nowe called Alize. Moreouer, by Lilius  Giraldus in the life of Hercules it is auouched, that the same Hercules  came ouer hither into Britaine. And this dooth Giraldus write by warrant  of such Britons as (saith he) haue so written themselues, which thing  peraduenture he hath read in Gildas the ancient Briton poet: a booke that  (as he confesseth in the 5. dialog of his histories of poets) he hath  seene. The same thing also is confirmed by the name of an head of land  in Britaine called _Promontorium Herculis_, as in Ptolomie ye may read,  which is thought to take name of his arriuall at that place. Thus much  for Albion and Hercules.    [Sidenote: Diuers opinions why this Ile was called Albion.  See more hereof in the discription.]  But now, whereas it is not denied of anie, that this  Ile was called ancientlie by the name of Albion: yet there be diuers  opinions how it came by that name: for manie doo not allow of this  historie of Albion the giant. But for so much as it apperteineth rather  to the description than to the historie of this Ile, to rip vp and lay  foorth the secret mysteries of such matters: and because I thinke that  this opinion which is here auouched, how it tooke that name of the  forsaid Albion, sonne to Neptune, may be confirmed with as good  authoritie as some of the other, I here passe ouer the rest, & proceed  with the historie.    When Albion chiefe capteine of the giants was slaine, the residue that  remained at home in the Ile, continued without any rule or restraint of  law, in so much that they fell to such a dissolute order of life, that  they seemed little or nothing to differ from brute beasts: and those are  they which our ancient chronicles call the giants, who were so named, as  well for the huge proportion of their stature (sithens as before is said,  that age brought foorth far greater men than are now liuing) as also for  that they were the first, or at the least the furthest in remembrance  of any that had inhabited this countrie. For this word _Gigines_, or  _Gegines_, from whence our word giant (as some take it) is deriued, is a  Greeke word, and signifieth, Borne or bred of or in the earth, for our  fore-elders, specially the Gentiles, being ignorant of the true beginning  of mankind, were persuaded, that the first inhabitants of any countrie  were bred out of the earth, and therefore when they could go no higher,  [Sidenote: _Terrae filius_ what it signifieth.]  reckoning the descents of their predecessours, they would name him _Terrae  filius_, The sonne of the earth: and so the giants whom the poets faine  to haue sought to make battell against heauen, are called the sonnes of  the earth: and the first inhabitants generally of euery countrie were of  the Greekes called _Gigines_, or _Gegines_, and of the Latines  [Sidenote: _Aborigines_.  _Indigenae_.]  _Aborigines_, and _Indigenae_, that is, People borne of the earth from the  beginning, and comming from no other countrie, but bred within the same.    These giants and first inhabitants of this Ile continued in their  beastlie kind of life vnto the arriuall of the ladies, which some of our  chronicles ignorantly write to be the daughters of Dioclesian the king  of Assyria, whereas in deed they haue beene deceiued, in taking the  [Sidenote: The mistaking of the name of Dioclesianus for Danaus.]  word _Danaus_ to be short written for _Dioclesianus_: and by the same  meanes haue diuers words and names beene mistaken, both in our chronicles,  and in diuers other ancient written woorks. But this is a fault that  learned men should not so much trouble themselues about, considering the  [Sidenote: _Hugh the Italian_.  _Harding_.  Iohn Rous_ out of _Dauid Pencair_.]  same hath bin alreadie found by sundrie authors ling sithens, as Hugh the  Italian, Iohn Harding, Iohn Rouse of Warwike, and others,  speciallie by the helpe of Dauid Pencair a British historie, who recite  the historie vnder the name of Danaus and his daughters. And because we  would not any man to thinke, that the historie of these daughters  of Danaus is onelie of purpose deuised, and brought in place of  Dioclesianus, to excuse the imperfection of our writers, whereas  there was either no such historie (or at the least no such women that  [Sidenote: _Nennius_.]  arriued in this Ile) the authoritie of Nennius a Briton writer may be  auouched, who wrote aboue 900. yeares past, and maketh mention of the  arriuall of such ladies.    [Sidenote: Belus priscus.  _Danaidarium porticani_.](text unclear)  To be short, the historie is thus. Belus the sonne of Epaphus, or (as  some writers haue) of Neptune and Libies (whome Isis after the death  of Apis maried) had issue two sonnes: the first Danaus, called also  Armeus; and Aegyptus called also Rameses: these two were kings among  the Aegyptians, Danaus the elder of the two, hauing in his rule the  [Sidenote: Danaus.  Aegyptus.  _Higinus_.]  vpper region of Aegypt, had by sundrie wiues 50. daughters, with whome  his brother Aegyptus, gaping for the dominion of the whole, did  instantlie labour, that his sonnes being also 50. in number, might  match. But Danaus hauing knowledge by some prophesie or oracle, that  a sonne in law of his should be his death, refused so to bestow his  daughters. Hereupon grew warre betwixt the brethren, in the end  whereof, Danaus being the weaker, was inforced to flee his countrie,  and so prepared a nauie, imbarked himselfe and his daughters, and with  them passed ouer into Greece, where he found meanes to dispossesse  Gelenor (sonne to Stenelas king of Argos) of his rightfull  inheritance, driuing him out of his countrie, and reigned in his place  by the assistance of the Argiues that had conceiued an hatred towardes  Gelenor, and a great liking towardes Danaus, who in verie deed did so  farre excell the kings that had reigned there before him, that the  Greekes in remembrance of him were after called Danai.
