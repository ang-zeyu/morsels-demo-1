At the end of the  sterilizing time, _immediately_ remove the jars from the canner.    In taking canned goods from boiling water care is needed to see that  they are protected from drafts. If necessary close the windows and  doors while lifting the jars out, as a sudden draft might break them.    Examine rubbers to see that they are in place. Sometimes if a cover is  screwed down too tight the pressure of the steam from the inside  causes the rubber to bulge out. Simply loosen the cover a thread or  two, push the rubber back into place and then tighten.    In case the rubber does not seem to fit well or seems to be a poor  rubber it should be replaced by a new one, and the jar returned to the  cooker for five minutes.    The jars should be sealed tight--covers screwed down, clamps put in  place--immediately after they are removed from the cooker.    Invert the jar to test the joint, then let it cool. If the seal is not  perfect correct the fault and return the jar to the cooker for five  minutes if hot, ten minutes if the jar is cold.    Do not invert vacuum-seal jars. These should be allowed to cool, and  then be tested by removing the spring or clamp and lifting the jars by  the cover only. Lift the jar only half an inch, holding it over the  table, so that in case the lid does not hold the jar and contents will  not be damaged. Or, better still, tap round the edge of the cover with  a rule. An imperfect seal will give a hollow sound.    As light injures delicately colored fruits and vegetables, it is wise  to store them in dark places, such as cupboards, or basement or attic  shelves protected from the light. Black cambric tacked to the top  shelf and suspended over the other shelves is a sufficient protection  from light. A discarded window shade can be rolled down over the  shelves and easily pulled up when you desire to take a jar from the  shelves.    Canned goods are best kept at a temperature below seventy degrees  Fahrenheit, where that is at all possible.      STEPS IN CANNING SOFT FRUITS AND BERRIES    It might be well to enumerate the steps in berry and soft-fruit  canning, or do what we called in our schooldays \"review it\":    1. Get the canner and all its accessories ready.    2. Test and wash jars and tops and put in water to sterilize.    3. Test rubber rings.    4. Make sirup and put in double boiler to keep hot    5. Prepare the product--hull, seed, stem.    6. Place berries or fruit in strainer or colander.    7. Rinse by pouring cold water over product.    8. Pack from strainer into hot jar.    9. Use big spoon to get a firm pack.    10. Dip rubber in hot water to cleanse it and put it in place on the  jar.    11. Pour the hot sirup over the fruit at once.    12. Put top of jar on, but not tight.    13. Ready for canner.    14. Sterilize for the necessary length of time, according to the  outfit you are using:                                        MINUTES      Hot-water-bath outfit                16    Condensed-steam outfit               16    Water-seal outfit                    12    Steam pressure, 5 pounds, outfit     10    Pressure cooker, 10 pounds, outfit    5    15. Remove from canner.    16. Tighten cover, except vacuum-seal jar, which seals automatically.    17. Test joint.    18. Three or four days later, if perfectly air-tight, label and store  in a dark place.    These steps are followed for strawberries, blackberries, blueberries,  dewberries, huckleberries, gooseberries, raspberries, and for all soft  fruits, such as cherries, currants, grapes and figs.    The other soft fruits, such as peaches and apricots, which have a  skin, are scalded or \"hot dipped\" for one to two minutes in boiling  water or steam and are then plunged into cold water. These two steps  of hot-dipping and cold dipping make the removal of skins a very  simple operation. After the skins are removed the fruit is put into  the hot jars and the process continued from Step 8, as with  strawberries.      SIRUPS    Of course you are wondering about the sirups for the different fruits.  There is no set rule for making sirup. It is not necessary to use  sirup in canning fruits. The amount of sugar used in the sirup will  depend upon the individual taste. In a first-class product there  should be enough sirup to improve its flavor, but not enough to make  it take the place in the diet of a sweet preserve rather than a fresh  fruit.    The sirups are made either with varying proportions of sugar and water  or with the same proportions boiled different lengths of time. What is  known as the California sirup is made with three parts of sugar to two  parts of water, boiled gently to different concentrations.    Thin Sirup. For a thin sirup take three cups of sugar and two cups  of water. Mix sugar and heat until the sugar is dissolved. This is  used for all sweet fruits not too delicate in texture and color, as  apples, cherries, pears, or for fruits in which more sugar will be  added in preparation for the table.    Medium Thin Sirup. The sugar and water should be boiled about four  minutes, or until it begins to be sirupy. This is used for  raspberries, peaches, blackberries, currants, etc.    Medium Thick Sirup. Boil the sugar and water until it will pile up  over the edge of the spoon when it is tipped. This is used for sour or  acid fruits, as plums, gooseberries, apricots, sour apples, and some  of the delicately colored fruits, as strawberries.    Thick Sirup. The sugar and water are boiled until it will form a  ball in the spoon and cannot be poured from the spoon. This is used  for preserves.    It is possible to get more, sometimes almost twice as much, sirup  into a quart jar containing large fruits, as apples and pears, than  into a quart jar containing small fruits, as currants or blackberries.    There is a little knack worth knowing about combining the sugar and  water for the sirup. If the sugar is sifted into the boiling water  just as fine-grained cereals are sifted into water, there will be no  scum formed. This is a saving of sugar.    If you wish to can strawberries for the market or to win a prize at  the county or state fairs, can them as follows:    Canned by this recipe, strawberries will not rise to the top of the  sirup. Use only fresh, ripe, firm and sound berries. Prepare them, and  add eight ounces of sugar and two tablespoonfuls of water to each  quart of berries. Boil slowly for fifteen minutes in an enameled or  acid-proof kettle. Allow the berries to cool and remain several hours  or over-night in the covered kettle. Pack the cold berries in hot  glass jars. Put rubbers and caps of jars in position, not tight.  Sterilize for the length of time given below for the type of outfit  used:                                           MINUTES    Water bath, homemade or commercial      8    Water seal, 214 degrees                 6    5 pounds steam pressure                 5    10 pounds steam pressure.          Do not use.    Remove the jars, tighten the covers, invert the jars to cool and test  the joints. Wrap the jars with paper to prevent bleaching.          CHAPTER III    HARD FRUITS      PINEAPPLES    The object of canning citrus fruits is, first, to save the surplus and  by-products; second, to furnish wholesome fruits at reasonable cost to  more of our people; third, to help the producer to transform  by-products into net profits.    Almost every one likes canned pineapple, but some housewives stopped  canning this fruit because they found that when cooked in sirup it  seemed to get tough and less palatable. Vegetable and fruit fibers are  toughened when cooked with sugar for any length of time, so in all  cases where you desire to keep the product as Nature grew it avoid  this form of cooking.    When the product is put into the jars with a sirup and cooked in the  jar you will have a product superior to the one that is cooked over  the direct fire in the kettle with the sirup.    But pineapple slices or pieces are so hard they cannot be put directly  into the jars as berries are. Pineapples must undergo a preliminary  process to make them palatable and soft. This preliminary process is  known in canning as \"blanching.\"    After the pineapple has been prepared by paring and removing the eyes,  it can be left in slices or cut into cubes. In cutting hold the  pineapple at the top and use a sharp knife. It is then placed in a  wire basket or a piece of cheesecloth for the blanching. Blanching  means to immerse the product in boiling water for a certain length of  time to reduce its bulk and soften it.    Pineapples are blanched for five minutes. We scald peaches and  apricots, which are soft fruits; but we blanch pineapples, apples and  quinces, the hard fruits.    Scalding means to immerse the product in boiling water for a very  short time--just long enough to loosen the skins. Blanching is just a  longer period of scalding.    When you blanch pineapples use only enough water to cover them. This  same blanching water can be used for making the sirup. It contains  much of the pineapple flavor and there is no reason for discarding it.  But this is absolutely the only blanching water that is ever used. All  other blanching water, particularly that in which vegetables are  blanched, is full of objectionable acids that we want to get rid of,  so under no circumstances must it be used. But with pineapples the  object of blanching is primarily to soften the hard fiber, so there is  no objection to using the blanching water.    After the pineapple has been in the covered kettle of boiling water  for five minutes, it is held under cold water until cool enough to  handle. Never let it soak in cold water, as that will impair its  delicate flavor. After this it is packed into hot sterilized jars.  Rubber rings are put on the jars, the covers are put in place--not  tight--and the jars are put in the canner.

Had Canning's policy  been followed by later British statesmen there would have resulted a  serious clash with the United States[8].    In fact the Monroe Doctrine, imposing on Europe a self-denying policy of  non-colonial expansion toward the west, provided for the United States  the medium, if she wished to use it, for her own expansion in territory  and in influence. But for a time there was no need of additional  territory for that already hers stretched from the Atlantic to the Rocky  Mountains, two-thirds of the way from ocean to ocean. Her population was  growing fast. But four millions at the time of the Revolution, there  were thirteen millions in 1830, and of these nearly a third were already  across the Appalachian range and were constantly pressing on towards new  lands in the South and West. The Monroe Doctrine was the first definite  notice given to Europe of America's preconceived \"destiny,\" but the  earlier realization of that destiny took place on lines of expansion  within her own boundaries. To this there could be no governmental  objection, whether by Great Britain or any other nation.    But when in the decade 1840 to 1850, the United States, to the view of  British statesmen, suddenly startled the world by entering upon a policy  of further territorial expansion, forsaking her peaceful progress and  turning toward war, there was a quick determination on a line of British  policy as regards the American advance. The first intimation of the new  American policy came in relation to the State of Texas which had  revolted from Mexico in 1836, and whose independence had been generally  recognized by 1842. To this new state Britain sent diplomatic and  consular agents and these reported two factions among the people--one  seeking admission to the American Union, one desiring the maintenance  of independence.    In 1841 Aberdeen had sent Lord Ashburton to America with instructions to  secure, if possible, a settlement of all matters in dispute. Here was a  genuine British effort to escape from national irritations. But before  the Treaty of 1842 was signed, even while it was in the earlier stages  of negotiation, the British Government saw, with alarm, quite new  questions arising, preventing, to its view, that harmonious relation  with the United States the desire for which had led to the Ashburton  mission. This new development was the appearance of an American fever  for territorial expansion, turning first toward Texas, but soon voiced  as a \"manifest destiny\" which should carry American power and  institutions to the Pacific and even into Central America. Among these  institutions was that of slavery, detested by the public of Great  Britain, yet a delicate matter for governmental consideration since the  great cotton manufacturing interests drew the bulk of their supplies of  raw cotton from the slave-holding states of America. If Texas, herself a  cotton state, should join the United States, dependence upon slave-grown  cotton would be intensified. Also, Texas, once acquired, what was there  to prevent further American exploitation, followed by slave expansion,  into Mexico, where for long British influence had been dominant?    On the fate of Texas, therefore, centred for a time the whole British  policy toward America. Pakenham, the British minister to Mexico, urged a  British pressure on Mexico to forgo her plans of reconquering Texas, and  strong British efforts to encourage Texas in maintaining her  independence. His theory foreshadowed a powerful buffer Anglo-Saxon  state, prohibiting American advance to the south-west, releasing Britain  from dependence on American cotton, and ultimately, he hoped, leading  Texas to abolish slavery, not yet so rooted as to be ineradicable. This  policy was approved by the British Government, Pakenham was sent to  Washington to watch events, a _charge_, Elliot, was despatched to Texas,  and from London lines were cast to draw France into the plan and to  force the acquiescence of Mexico.    In this brief account of main lines of governmental contacts, it is  unnecessary to recite the details of the diplomatic conflict, for such  it became, with sharp antagonisms manifested on both sides. The basic  fact was that America was bent upon territorial expansion, and that  Great Britain set herself to thwart this ambition. But not to the point  of war. Aberdeen was so incautious at one moment as to propose to France  and Mexico a triple guarantee of the independence of Texas, if that  state would acquiesce, but when Pakenham notified him that in this case,  Britain must clearly understand that war with America was not merely  possible, but probable, Aberdeen hastened to withdraw the plan of  guarantee, fortunately not yet approved by Mexico[9].    The solution of this diplomatic contest thus rested with Texas. Did she  wish annexation to the United States, or did she prefer independence?  Elliot, in Texas, hoped to the last moment that Texas would choose  independence and British favour. But the people of the new state were  largely emigrants from the United States, and a majority of them wished  to re-enter the Union, a step finally accomplished in 1846, after ten  years of separate existence as a Republic. The part played by the  British Government in this whole episode was not a fortunate one. It is  the duty of Governments to watch over the interests of their subjects,  and to guard the prestige and power of the state. Great Britain had a  perfect _right_ to take whatever steps she chose to take in regard to  Texas, but the steps taken appeared to Americans to be based upon a  policy antagonistic to the American expansion policy of the moment. The  Government of Great Britain appeared, indeed, to have adopted a policy  of preventing the development of the power of the United States. Then,  fronted with war, she had meekly withdrawn. The basic British public  feeling, fixing the limits of governmental policy, of never again being  drawn into war with America, not because of fear, but because of  important trade relations and also because of essential liking and  admiration, in spite of surface antagonisms, was not appreciated in  America. Lord Aberdeen indeed, and others in governmental circles,  pleaded that the support of Texan independence was in reality perfectly  in harmony with the best interests of the United States, since it would  have tended toward the limitation of American slavery. And in the matter  of national power, they consoled themselves with prophecies that the  American Union, now so swollen in size, must inevitably split into two,  perhaps three, rival empires, a slave-holding one in the South, free  nations in North and West.    The fate of Texas sealed, Britain soon definitely abandoned all  opposition to American expansion unless it were to be attempted  northwards, though prophesying evil for the American madness. Mexico,  relying on past favours, and because of a sharp controversy between the  United States and Great Britain over the Oregon territory, expected  British aid in her war of 1846 against America. But she was sharply  warned that such aid would not be given, and the Oregon dispute was  settled in the Anglo-Saxon fashion of vigorous legal argument, followed  by a fair compromise. The Mexican war resulted in the acquisition of  California by the United States. British agents in this province of  Mexico, and British admirals on the Pacific were cautioned to take no  active steps in opposition.    Thus British policy, after Texan annexation, offered no barrier to  American expansion, and much to British relief the fear of the extension  of the American plans to Mexico and Central America was not realized.  The United States was soon plunged, as British statesmen had prophesied,  into internal conflict over the question whether the newly-acquired  territories should be slave or free.    The acquisition of California brought up a new problem of quick transit  between Atlantic and Pacific, and a canal was planned across Central  America. Here Britain and America acted together, at first in amity,  though the convention signed in 1850 later developed discord as to the  British claim of a protectorate over the Atlantic end of the proposed  canal at San Juan del Nicaragua. But Britain was again at war in Europe  in the middle 'fifties, and America was deep in quarrel over slavery at  home. On both sides in spite of much diplomatic intrigue and of  manifestations of national pride there was governmental desire to avoid  difficulties. At the end of the ten-year period Britain ceded to  Nicaragua her protectorate in the canal zone, and all causes of  friction, so reported President Buchanan to Congress in 1860, were  happily removed. Britain definitely altered her policy of opposition to  the growth of American power.    In 1860, then, the causes of governmental antagonisms were seemingly all  at an end. Impressment was not used after 1814. The differing theories  of the two Governments on British expatriation still remained, but  Britain attempted no practical application of her view. The right of  search in time of peace controversy, first eased by the plan of joint  cruising, had been definitely settled by the British renunciation of  1858. Opposition to American territorial advance but briefly manifested  by Britain, had ended with the annexation of Texas, and the fever of  expansion had waned in America. Minor disputes in Central America,  related to the proposed canal, were amicably adjusted.    But differences between nations, varying view-points of peoples,  frequently have deeper currents than the more obvious frictions in  governmental act or policy, nor can governments themselves fail to react  to such less evident causes.
