[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16116"],[0,"Studies of Trees (#4)"],[1,"(_Trametes      pini_) which causes the tree to break down with ease is another of      its enemies.    Value for planting: A well-formed tree for the lawn. It is also useful      for group planting in the forest.    Commercial value: Because its wood is strong and durable the larch is      valuable for poles, posts, railroad ties, and in shipbuilding.    [Illustration: FIG. 16.--Twig of the Cypress.]    Other characters: The _fruit_ is a small cone about one inch long,      adhering to the tree throughout the winter.    [Illustration: FIG. 17.--The Bald Cypress.]    Comparisons: The tree is apt to be confused with the _American larch_,      also known as _tamarack_ and _hackmatack_, but differs from it in      having longer leaves, cones twice as large and more abundant and      branches which are more pendulous.        The larch differs from the bald cypress in the broader form of its      crown and the cluster-like arrangement of its leaves. The twigs of      the bald cypress are flat and feathery. The larch and bald cypress      have the common characteristics of both shedding their leaves in      winter and preferring to grow in moist or swampy soils. The larch,      especially the native species, forms the well-known tamarack swamps      of the north. The bald cypress grows in a similar way in groups in      the southern swamps.      BALD CYPRESS (_Taxodium distichum_)    Distinguishing characters: The *feathery character* of the *twigs*, Fig.      16, and the *spire-like form* of the tree, Fig. 17, which is taller      and more slender than the larch, will distinguish this species from      others.    [Illustration: FIG. 18.--Cypress \"Knees.\"]    Leaf: The leaves drop off in October, though the tree is of the      cone-bearing kind. In this respect it is like the larch.    Form and size: Tall and pyramidal.    Range: The cypress is a southern tree, but is found under cultivation in      parks and on lawns in northern United States.    Soil and location: Grows naturally in swamps, but will also do well in      ordinary well-drained, good soil. In its natural habitat it sends      out special roots above water. These are known as \"_cypress knees_\"      (Fig. 18) and serve to provide air to the submerged roots of the      tree.    Enemies: None of importance.    Value for planting: An excellent tree for park and lawn planting.    Commercial value: The wood is light, soft, and easily worked. It is used      for general construction, interior finish, railroad ties, posts and      cooperage.    Other characters: The _bark_ is thin and scaly. The _fruit_ is a cone      about an inch in diameter. The general _color_ of the tree is a      dull, deep green which, however, turns orange brown in the fall.    Comparisons: The cypress and the larch are apt to be confused,      especially in the winter, when the leaves of both have dropped. The      cypress is more slender and is taller in form. The leaves of each      are very different, as will be seen from the accompanying      illustrations.        GROUP V. THE HORSECHESTNUT, ASH AND MAPLE    How to tell them from other trees: The horsechestnut, ash, and maple      have their branches and buds arranged on their stems *opposite* each      other as shown in Figs. 20, 22 and 24. In other trees, this      arrangement is *alternate*, as shown in Fig. 19.    How to tell these three from each other. If the bud is large--an inch to      an inch and a half long--dark brown, and _sticky_, it is a      _horsechestnut_.        If the bud is _not sticky_, much smaller, and _rusty brown to black_      in color, and the ultimate twigs, of an olive green color, are      _flattened_ at points below the buds, it is an _ash_.    [Illustration: FIG. 19.--Alternate Branching (Beech.)]        If it is not a horsechestnut nor an ash and its small buds have      many scales covering them, the specimen with branches and buds      opposite must then be a _maple_. Each of the maples has one      character which distinguishes it from all the other maples. For the      sugar maple, this distinguishing character is the _sharp point of      the bud_. For the silver maple it is the _bend in the terminal      twig_. For the red maple it is the _smooth gray-colored bark_. For      the Norway maple it is the _reddish brown color of the full, round      bud_, and for the box elder it is the _greenish color of its      terminal twig_.        The form of the tree and the leaves are also characteristic in each      of the maples, but for the beginner who does not wish to be burdened      with too many of these facts at one time, those just enumerated      will be found most certain and most easily followed.    [Illustration: FIG. 20.--Opposite Branching (Horsechestnut.)]      THE HORSECHESTNUT  (_Aesculus hippocastanum_)    Distinguishing characters: The *sticky* nature of the *terminal bud* and      its *large size* (about an inch long). The bud is dark brown in      color. See Fig. 20.    Leaf: Five to seven leaflets, usually seven. Fig. 21.    Form and size: Medium-sized tree, pyramidal head and coarse twigs.    Range: Europe and eastern United States.    Soil and location: Prefers a deep, rich soil.    Enemies: The leaves are the favorite food of caterpillars and are      subject to a blight which turns them brown prematurely. The trunk is      often attacked by a disease which causes the flow of a slimy      substance.    Value for planting: On account of its showy flowers, the horsechestnut      is a favorite for the park and lawn.    Commercial value: The wood is not durable and is not used commercially.    Other characters: The _flowers_ appear in large white clusters in May      and June. The _fruit_ is large, round, and prickly.    [Illustration: FIG. 21.--Leaf of the Horsechestnut.]    Comparisons: The _red horsechestnut_ differs from this tree in having      red flowers. The _buckeye_ is similar to the horsechestnut, but its      bud is not sticky and is of a lighter gray color, while the leaf      generally has only five leaflets.      THE WHITE ASH (_Fraxinus americana_)    Distinguishing characters: The terminal *twigs* of glossy olive green      color are *flattened* below the bud. Fig. 22. The bud is      rusty-brown.    [Illustration: FIG. 22.--Twig of White Ash.]    Leaf: Five to nine leaflets. Fig. 23.    Form and size: A large tree with a straight trunk.    Range: Eastern North America.    Soil and location: Rich, moist soil.    Enemies: In cities it is very often attacked by sucking insects.    Value for planting: The white ash grows rapidly. On account of its      insect enemies in cities, it should be used more for forest planting      and only occasionally for ornament.    Commercial value: It has a heavy, tough, and strong wood, which is      valuable in the manufacture of cooperage stock, agricultural      implements, and carriages. It is superior in value to the black ash.    Other characters: The _bark_ is gray. The _flowers_ appear in May.    Comparisons: The white ash is apt to be confused with the _black ash_      (_Fraxinus nigra_), but differs from the latter in having a      lighter-colored bud. The bud of the black ash is black. The bark of      the white ash is darker in color and the terminal twigs are more      flattened than those of the black ash.    [Illustration: FIG. 23.--Leaf of White Ash.]      SUGAR MAPLE (_Acer saccharum_)    Distinguishing characters: The *bud is sharp-pointed*, scaly, and      reddish brown. Fig. 24.    [Illustration: FIG. 24.--Twig of the Sugar Maple.]    Leaf: Has sharp points and round sinus. Fig. 25.    Form and size: The crown is oval when the tree is young and round in old      age. Fig. 26.    Range: Eastern United States.    Soil and location: Moist and deep soil, and cool, shady positions.    Enemies: Subject to drouth, especially in cities. Is attacked by the      _sugar maple borer_ and the _maple phenacoccus_, a sucking insect.    Value for planting: Its rich and yellow color in the fall, and the fine      spread of its crown make it a desirable tree for the lawn,      especially in the country.    Commercial value: Its wood is hard and takes a good polish; used for      interior finish and furniture. The tree is also the source of maple      sugar. Fig. 27.    Other characters: The _bark_ is smooth in young trees and in old trees      it shags in large plates. The _flowers_ appear in the early part of      April.    Other common names: The sugar maple is sometimes called _rock maple_ or      _hard maple_.      SILVER MAPLE (_Acer saccharinum_)    Distinguishing characters: The tips of the *twigs curve upwards* (Fig.      28), the bark is scaly, and the leaves are very deeply cleft and are      silvery on the under side.    [Illustration: FIG. 25.--Leaf of Sugar Maple.]    Leaf: Deeply cleft and silvery under side. Fig. 29.    Form and size: A large tree with the main branches separating from the      trunk a few feet from the ground. The terminal twigs are long,      slender, and drooping.    Range: Eastern United States.    Soil and location: Moist places.    Enemies: The _leopard moth_, a wood-boring insect, and the      _cottony-maple scale_, a sucking insect.    [Illustration: FIG. 26.--The Sugar Maple.]    Value for planting: Grows too rapidly and is too short-lived to be      durable.    Commercial value: Its wood is soft, weak, and little used.    Other characters: The _bark_ is light gray, smooth at first and scaly      later on. The scales are free at each end and attached in the      center. The _flowers_ appear before the leaves in the latter part of      March or early April.    [Illustration: FIG. 27.--Tapping the Sugar Maple.]    Other common names: The silver maple is sometimes known as _soft maple_      or _white maple_.      RED MAPLE (_Acer rubrum_)    [Illustration: FIG. 28.--Terminal Twig of Silver Maple.]    Distinguishing characters: The *bark is smooth and light gray*, like      that of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16119"],[0,"Doctrina Christiana (#4)"],[1,"in Pampanga, should      compose and fashion grammars, dictionaries, and confessionaries      in the two languages [respectively Tagalog and Pampanga] in      which they had ventured; which they executed very promptly      and well, and these were of great use to those who came to      these islands, for they had these by which they could study      the languages.\" [34]      Later, San Agustin, again mentioning Quinones, referred to Grijalva,  and added as an additional source for his information Tomas de  Herrera. Sicardo [35] added nothing new. Herrera, not cited directly  by Beristain, may however have been the source from which the \"Imp.\" of  his entry came. Herrera wrote:          \"He [Quinones] was the first to have learned the Tagalog      language of which he published a grammar and dictionary as      an aid to the ministers of the gospel.\"      If Beristain read this, he may have been misled by the Latin of  \"published,\" [36] _in lucem edidit_, which may indeed mean printed  and published, but also means quite properly published in the sense  of written in manuscript and copied and circulated. We agree with  Schilling [37] that this latter meaning was the one intended. One  other statement that Quinones' works were printed may derive from  the same misunderstanding. About the year 1801 Pedro Bello wrote an  account, still in manuscript and unpublished, of the writings of the  Augustinians. His remarks on Quinones, first printed by Santiago Vela  [38], we believe are only an extension of Herrera's _in lucem edidit_.    This same confusion in terminology has been used [39] to support  Beristain's claim by introducing as evidence the letter of Philip II of  May 8, 1584. Salazar, the Bishop of Manila, probably shortly after the  Synod of 1582, had written the King a letter, now unfortunately lost,  in which he spoke of a decision to standardize linguistic works. In  answer to the Bishop, the following letter in the form of a royal  cedula was sent:          \"To the President and Judges of my Royal Audiencia situated      in the city of Manila in the Philippine Islands.--It has been      told me on behalf of Don Fray Domingo de Salazar, Bishop of      that place, that it was agreed that no priest might make a      grammar or vocabulary, and that if it were made it might not      be published before being examined and approved by the said      Bishop, because otherwise there would result great differences      and disagreements in the doctrine; and this having been seen      by my Council of the Indies, it was agreed that I should      order this my cedula which decrees that when any grammar or      vocabulary be made it shall not be published or used unless      it has first been examined by the said Bishop and seen by      this Audencia.\" [40]      Here again the word _publicado_ is brought forth to prove that the  letter referred to printed works, but here again the term is equally  applicable to manuscript works in common use and generally available.    Further evidence that there was no printing as early as 1581 is to be  found in a letter [41] from Juan de Plasencia, a Tagalist of great  renown, to the King, dated from Manila, June 18, 1585, in which he  reported on the state of missionary work in China and Japan, and added  that he had written a grammar and a declaration of the whole Doctrina  in the most common language of the Philippines, and that he was then  making a dictionary, concluding by asking the King to send decrees  ordering those works to be printed in Mexico at the expense of the  Exchequer. Is it likely that Plasencia would have so written if an  _Arte y Vocabulario_ had been printed four years earlier? Furthermore,  San Antonio, recording the book on the customs and rites of the Indians  written by Plasencia at the request of the Governor Santiago de Vera,  and dated October 24, 1589, said that it was not printed \"because  printing houses had not yet come to this country.\" [42]    We then conclude with regard to Beristain's entry, that although  there existed in manuscript an _Arte y Vocabuldrio Tagalo_ by Juan de  Quinones, there is no evidence of the existence of any book printed  for him from wood-blocks or in type. Santiago de Vela [43] suggests  the possibility that there might have been a xylographic _Arte_ of  1581, but Schilling [44] questions this in the face of the complete  lack of reference to such a printed work by any 17th or 18th century  writer, and the tenuous notices of Bello and Beristain; yet to say  categorically that no such work was printed would be foolhardy in the  face of the scanty early records and the appearance of this Doctrina,  a single copy of which has just been discovered.    The first important work devoted solely to the early history of the  Philippine press was by T.H. Pardo de Tavera, who in 1893 published  his study of printing and engraving in the Philippines. He there  recorded a 1593 Doctrina, but adamantly refused to accept it on the  hearsay evidence of others. His account is valuable because it shows  that there may have been a copy of the Doctrina in Java in 1885,  and so we quote from it at some length:          \"A learned Dutch orientalist, Dr. J. Brandes, wrote me in 1885      from Bali-Boeleleng (Java) telling me that in 1593 at Manila      there was printed a Doctrina Christiana in Spanish-Tagalog,      with the proper characters for the latter language. Other      orientalists, at the last Congress in London in 1891, gave      me the same information. Nonetheless, no one told me where      he had read such a thing, nor much less that he had managed      to see such a book, although inspecting a rare book which      I acquired in Paris (Alter, _Ueber die tagalische sprache_,      Vienna, 1803), I saw that the author cited such a Doctrina      Christiana and said that he knew of its existence through Abbe      Hervas. This is an error, and without doubt such a Doctrina was      in manuscript, because in 1591 [he should have said 1593] there      was no press in Manila nor in any part of the archipelago,      and today we know for certain and positively that the first      book issued there appeared in 1610.\" [45]      Pardo de Tavera was the first to call attention to Alter, and through  him to Hervas, and in all probability the orientalists at the London  Congress had seen the Doctrina cited by one of these or Adelung. But he  rejects that evidence in no uncertain terms. Mitigating somewhat his  assurance, he speaks following the above-quoted passage of printing  in China, and differentiates between xylographic and typographic  printing, and since he was obviously thinking in terms of printing  on a press with movable type his conclusions are not too extreme.    In 1896 appeared Jose Toribio Medina's _La Imprenta en Manila_, which  was up to then the best, most complete and most scholarly work on early  Philippine printing, and is today with its subsequent additions and  corrections the standard bibliography of the subject. There Medina  cited most of the authorities we have already quoted, the letter of  Dasmarinas, Fernandez' _Historia eclesiastica_, Aduarte, Adelung,  Beristain and Pardo de Tavera. Then, basing his conclusions strongly  on the Dasmarinas letter and the note of Adelung, he listed [46]  as number one in his bibliography the Doctrina of 1593 in Spanish  and Tagalog, and as number two the Doctrina in Spanish and Chinese  of the same year. This is a verdict which has stood the test of  time, and one that is just now confirmed by the discovery of the  book itself. Two points, however, in his survey should be noted. In  his discussion of the printing and the authorship Medina does not  emphasize the Dominican origin of the book, although he does say that  \"it does not appear bold to us to suppose that the imprint of these  Doctrinas ought to be the Hospital of San Gabriel in this village  [Binondo],\" [47] and faithfully copies Adelung's imprint notice, \"in  the Dominican printing-house,\" in his listing of the book. The other  point is that he says in his introduction and repeats in his entry  that the Doctrina had a Latin as well as Spanish and Tagalog texts,  an erroneous translation of Adelung's \"mit lateinische und tagalische  Schrift.\" He was hesitant as are all bibliographers, who must perforce  record the probable existence of a book a copy of which they have  never seen, in committing himself as to whether it was printed from  blocks or from type or by a combination of the two methods.    More positive and more succinct than Medina was T.E. Retana whose  earlier researches [48] into the history of the Philippines Medina  acknowledgedly made use of, and who in 1897 published his _La Imprenta  en Filipinas, Adiciones y Observaciones a La Imprenta en Manila_. He  took the material of Medina, added the evidence of Chirino and  Plasencia, and resummarized the problem. The letter of Dasmarinas  showed conclusively that a Doctrina was printed in 1593. Chirino said  that the first two whose works were printed were Juan de Villanueva and  Blancas de San Jose. Fernandez stated positively that the first book  printed in the Philippines was the book of Our Lady of the Rosary by  Blancas de San Jose printed at Bataan in 1602. Aduarte supported this  without mentioning a title, place or date of printing. If we are to  accept all these statements as incontrovertible, how can the apparent  contradictions be reconciled? The answer had already been hinted at,  but Retana solved the problem with amazing acumen, and arrived at  four conclusions, which are here printed in his own words:          \"A--That the Doctrinas of 1593, though printed at Manila, were      not executed in type, but by the so-called xylographic method;        B--That the initiative for the establishment of _typography_      is owed to P. Fr. Francisco Blancas de San Jose;        C--That the first _typographer_ was the Chinese Christian      Juan de Vera at"]]]
