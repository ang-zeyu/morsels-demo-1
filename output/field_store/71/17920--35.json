Can one blame him for that?]           *       *       *       *       *    Such people are destined to unhappiness; and if they make other people  suffer, one may be sure that it is only half of what they suffer  themselves. They have a peculiar gift for attracting and gathering up  trouble; they savour sorrow like wine, and do not lose a drop of it.  Life seemed desirous that Berlioz should be steeped in suffering; and  his misfortunes were so real that it would be unnecessary to add to them  any exaggerations that history has handed down to us.    People find fault with Berlioz's continual complaints; and I, too, find  in them a lack of virility and almost a lack of dignity. To all  appearances, he had far fewer material reasons for unhappiness than--I  won't say Beethoven--Wagner and other great men, past, present, and  future. When thirty-five years old he had achieved glory; and Paganini  proclaimed him Beethoven's successor. What more could he want? He was  discussed by the public, disparaged by a Scudo and an Adolphus Adam, and  the theatre only opened its doors to him with difficulty. It was really  splendid!    But a careful examination of facts, such as that made by M. Julien  Tiersot, shows the stifling mediocrity and hardship of his life. There  were, first of all, his material cares. When thirty-six years old  \"Beethoven's successor\" had a fixed salary of fifteen hundred francs as  assistant keeper of the Conservatoire Library, and not quite as much for  his contributions to the _Debits_-contributions which exasperated and  humiliated him, and were one of the crosses of his life, as they obliged  him to speak anything but the truth.[22]    [Footnote 22: _Memoires_, II, 158. The heartaches expressed in this  chapter will be felt by every artist.]    That made a total of three thousand francs, hardly gained on which he  had to keep a wife and child--\"_meme deux_,\" as M. Tiersot says. He  attempted a festival at the Opera; the result was three hundred and  sixty francs loss. He organised a festival at the 1844 Exhibition; the  receipts were thirty-two thousand francs, out of which he got eight  hundred francs. He had the _Damnation de Faust_ performed; no one came  to it, and he was ruined. Things went better in Russia; but the manager  who brought him to England became bankrupt. He was haunted by thoughts  of rents and doctors' bills. Towards the end of his life his financial  affairs mended a little, and a year before his death he uttered these  sad words: \"I suffer a great deal, but I do not want to die now--I have  enough to live upon.\"    One of the most tragic episodes of his life is that of the symphony  which he did not write because of his poverty. One wonders why the page  that finishes his _Memoires_ is not better known, for it touches the  depths of human suffering.    At the time when his wife's health was causing him most anxiety, there  came to him one night an inspiration for a symphony. The first part of  it--an allegro in two-four time in A minor--was ringing in his head. He  got up and began to write, and then he thought,         \"If I begin this bit, I shall have to write the whole symphony. It       will be a big thing, and I shall have to spend three or four months       over it. That means I shall write no more articles and earn no       money. And when the symphony is finished I shall not be able to       resist the temptation of having it copied (which will mean an       expense of a thousand or twelve hundred francs), and then of having       it played. I shall give a concert, and the receipts will barely       cover half the cost. I shall lose what I have not got; the poor       invalid will lack necessities; and I shall be able to pay neither       my personal expenses nor my son's fees when he goes on board       ship.... These thoughts made me shudder, and I threw down my pen,       saying, 'Bah! to-morrow I shall have forgotten the symphony.' The       next night I heard the allegro clearly, and seemed to see it       written down. I was filled with feverish agitation; I sang the       theme; I was going to get up ... but the reflections of the day       before restrained me; I steeled myself against the temptation, and       clung to the thought of forgetting it. At last I went to sleep; and       the next day, on waking, all remembrance of it had, indeed, gone       for ever.\"[23]    That page makes one shudder. Suicide is less distressing. Neither  Beethoven nor Wagner suffered such tortures. What would Wagner have done  on a like occasion? He would have written the symphony without  doubt--and he would have been right. But poor Berlioz, who was weak  enough to sacrifice his duty to love, was, alas! also heroic enough to  sacrifice his genius to duty.[24]    [Footnote 23: _Memoires_, II, 349.]    [Footnote 24: Berlioz has already touchingly replied to any reproaches  that might be made in the words that follow the story I have quoted.  \"'Coward!' some young enthusiast will say, 'you ought to have written  it; you should have been bold.' Ah, young man, you who call me coward  did not have to look upon what I did; had you done so you, too, would  have had no choice. My wife was there, half dead, only able to moan; she  had to have three nurses, and a doctor every day to visit her; and I was  sure of the disastrous result of any musical adventure. No, I was not a  coward; I know I was only human. I like to believe that I honoured art  in proving that she had left me enough reason to distinguish between  courage and cruelty\" (_Memoires_, II, 350).]    And in spite of all this material misery and the sorrow of being  misunderstood, people speak of the glory he enjoyed. What did his  compeers think of him--at least, those who called themselves such? He  knew that Mendelssohn, whom he loved and esteemed, and who styled  himself his \"good friend,\" despised him and did not recognise his  genius.[25] The large-hearted Schumann, who was, with the exception of  Liszt,[26] the only person who intuitively felt his greatness, admitted  that he used sometimes to wonder if he ought to be looked upon as \"a  genius or a musical adventurer.\"[27]    [Footnote 25: In a note in the _Memoires_, Berlioz publishes a letter of  Mendelssohn's which protests his \"good friendship,\" and he writes these  bitter words: \"I have just seen in a volume of Mendelssohn's Letters  what his friendship for me consisted of. He says to his mother, in what  is plainly a description of myself, '---- is a perfect caricature,  without a spark of talent ... there are times when I should like to  swallow him up'\" (_Memoires_, II, 48). Berlioz did not add that  Mendelssohn also said: \"They pretend that Berlioz seeks lofty ideals in  art. I don't think so at all. What he wants is to get himself married.\"  The injustice of these insulting words will disgust all those who  remember that when Berlioz married Henrietta Smithson she brought as  dowry nothing but debts; and that he had only three hundred francs  himself, which a friend had lent him.]    [Footnote 26: Liszt repudiated him later.]    [Footnote 27: Written in an article on the _Ouverture de Waverley_  (_Neue Zeitschrift fuer Musik_).]    Wagner, who treated his symphonies with scorn before he had even read  them,[28] who certainly understood his genius, and who deliberately  ignored him, threw himself into Berlioz's arms when he met him in London  in 1855. \"He embraced him with fervour, and wept; and hardly had he left  him when _The Musical World_ published passages from his book, _Oper und  Drama_, where he pulls Berlioz to pieces mercilessly.\"[29] In France,  the young Gounod, _doli fabricator Epeus_, as Berlioz called him,  lavished flattering words upon him, but spent his time in finding fault  with his compositions,[30] or in trying to supplant him at the theatre.  At the Opera he was passed over in favour of a Prince Poniatowski.    [Footnote 28: Wagner, who had criticised Berlioz since 1840, and who  published a detailed study of his works in his _Oper und Drama_ in 1851,  wrote to Liszt in 1855: \"I own that it would interest me very much to  make the acquaintance of Berlioz's symphonies, and I should like to see  the scores. If you have them, will you lend them to me?\"]    [Footnote 29: See Berlioz's letter, cited by J. Tiersot, _Hector Berlioz  et la societe de son temps_, p. 275.]    [Footnote 30: _Romeo, Faust, La Nonne sanglante_.]    He presented himself three times at the Academy, and was beaten the  first time by Onslow, the second time by Clapisson, and the third time  he conquered by a majority of one vote against Panseron, Vogel, Leborne,  and others, including, as always, Gounod. He died before the _Damnation  de Faust_ was appreciated in France, although it was the most remarkable  musical composition France had produced. They hissed its performance?  Not at all; \"they were merely indifferent\"--it is Berlioz who tells us  this. It passed unnoticed. He died before he had seen _Les Troyens_  played in its entirety, though it was one of the noblest works of the  French lyric theatre that had been composed since the death of  Gluck.[31] But there is no need to be astonished. To hear these works  to-day one must go to Germany. And although the dramatic work of Berlioz  has found its Bayreuth--thanks to Mottl, to Karlsruhe and Munich--and  the marvellous _Benvenuto Cellini_ has been played in twenty German  towns,[32] and regarded as a masterpiece by Weingartner and Richard  Strauss, what manager of a French theatre would think of producing such  works?    But this is not all. What was the bitterness of failure compared with  the great anguish of death? Berlioz saw all those he loved die one after  the other: his father, his mother, Henrietta Smithson, Marie Recio. Then  only his son Louis remained.

We shall give part of Mr. Cleveland's answer to the  officer's first letter, by which an estimate may be formed of the  rest.    SIXTHLY BELOVED!    \"It is so, that our brother and fellow-labourer in the gospel, is  start aside; then this may serve for an use of instruction, not to  trust in man, or in the son of man. Did not Demas leave Paul? Did not  Onesimus run from his master Philemon? Also this should teach us to  employ our talents, and not to lay them up in a napkin; had it been  done among the cavaliers, it had been just, then the Israelite had  spoiled the Egyptian; but for Simeon to plunder Levi, that--that, &c.\"    The garrison of Newark defended themselves with much courage and  resolution against the besiegers, and did not surrender but by the  King's special command, after he had thrown himself into the hands of  the Scots; which action of his Majesty's Cleveland passionately  resented, in his poem called, the King's Disguise: Upon some private  intelligence, three days before the King reached them, he foresaw,  that the army would be bribed to surrender him, in which he was not  mistaken. As soon as this event took place, Cleveland, who warmly  adhered to the regal party, was obliged to atone for his loyalty by  languishing in a jail, at Yarmouth, where he remained for some time  under all the disadvantages of poverty, and wretchedness: At last  being quite spent with the severity of his confinement, he addressed  Oliver Cromwell in a petition for liberty, in such pathetic and moving  terms, that his heart was melted with the prisoner's expostulation,  and he ordered him to be set at liberty. In this address, our author  did not in the least violate his loyalty, for he made no concessions  to Oliver, but only a representation of the hardships he suffered,  without acknowledging his sovereignty, tho' not without flattering his  power. Having thus obtained his liberty, he settled himself in  Gray's-Inn, and as he owed his releasement to the Protector, he  thought it his duty to be passive, and not at least to act against  him: But Cleveland did not long enjoy his state of unenvied ease, for  he was seized with an intermitting fever, and died the 29th of April,  1685.    [2]On the first of May he was buried, and his dear friend Dr. John  Pearson, afterwards lord bishop of Chester, preached his funeral  sermon, and gave this reason, why he declined commending the deceased,  \"because such praising of him would not be adequate to the expectation  of the audience, seeing some who knew him must think it far below  him.\"--There were many who attempted to write elegies upon him, and  several performances of this kind, in Latin and English, are prefixed  to the edition of Cleveland's works, in verse and prose, printed in  8vo, in 1677, with his effigies prefixed.    From the verses of his called Smectymnuus, we shall give the following  specimen, in which the reader will see he did not much excel in  numbers.      Smectymnuus! the goblin makes me start,    I'th' name of Rabbi-Abraham, what art?    Syriack? or Arabick? or Welsh? what skilt?    Up all the brick-layers that Babel built?    Some conjurer translate, and let me know it,    'Till then 'tis fit for a West Saxon Poet.    But do the brotherhood then play their prizes?    Like murmurs in religion with disguises?    Out-brave us with a name in rank and file,    A name, which if 'twere trained would spread a mile;    The Saints monopoly, the zealous cluster,    Which like a porcupine presents a muster.    The following lines from the author's celebrated satire, entitled, the  Rebel-Scot, will yet more amply shew his turn for this species of  poetry.        \"Nature herself doth Scotchmen beasts confess,    Making their country such a wilderness;    A land that brings in question and suspence    God's omnipresence; but that CHARLES came thence;    But that MONTROSE and CRAWFORD'S loyal band    Aton'd their sin, and christen'd half their land.--    A land where one may pray with curst intent,    O may they never suffer banishment!    Had Cain been Scot, God would have chang'd his doom,    Not forc'd him wander, but confin'd him home.--        \"Lord! what a goodly thing is want of shirts!    How a Scotch stomach and no meat converts!    They wanted food and rayment, so they took    Religion for their temptress and their cook.--    Hence then you proud impostors get you gone,    You Picts in gentry and devotion.    You scandal to the stock of verse, a race    Able to bring the gibbet in disgrace.--        \"The Indian that heaven did forswear,    Because he heard some Spaniards were there,    Had he but known what Scots in Hell had been,    He would, Erasmus-like, have hung between.\"    It is probable that this bitterness against our brethren of  North-Britain, chiefly sprang from Mr. Cleveland's resentment of the  Scots Army delivering up the King to the Parliament.

In 1615, he entered into holy orders[1], and was in a  short time taken notice of as an eloquent or rather popular preacher,  by which he had two benefices confered on him both in the diocese of  Oxford.    In the year 1618 he went as chaplain to Sir Francis Stewart, when he  accompanied to Spain the Count Gundamore, after he had continued  several Years at our court as embassador, in which journey Holyday  behaved in a facetious and pleasant manner, which ingratiated him in  the favour of Gundamore[2].    Afterwards our author became chaplain to King Charles I. and succeeded  Dr. Bridges in the archdeaconry of Oxon, before the year 1626. In 1642  he was by virtue of the letters of the said King, created, with  several others, Dr. of divinity. When the rebellion broke out, he  sheltered himself near Oxford; but when he saw the royal party decline  so much that their cause was desperate, he began to tamper with the  prevailing power; and upon Oliver Cromwell's being raised to the  Protectorship, he so far coincided with the Usurper's interests, as to  undergo the examination of the Friers, in order to be inducted into  the rectory of Shilton in Berks, in the place of one Thomas Lawrence,  ejected on account of his being non compos mentis. For which act he  was much blamed and censured by his ancient friends the clergy, who  adhered to the King, and who rather chose to live in poverty during  the usurpation, than by a mean compliance with the times, betray the  interest of the church, and the cause of their exiled sovereign.    After the King's restoration he quitted the living he held under  Cromwell, and returned to Eisley near Oxon, to live on his  archdeaconry; and had he not acted a temporizing part it was said he  might have been raised to a see, or some rich deanery. His poetry  however, got him a name in those days, and he stood very fair for  preferment; and his philosophy discovered in his book de Anima, and  well languaged sermons, (says Wood) speaks him eminent in his  generation, and shew him to have traced the rough parts, as well as  the pleasant paths of poetry.    His works are,    1. Three Sermons, on the Passion, Resurrection, and Ascension of our  Saviour, Lond. 1626.    2. Two Sermons at Paul's Cross.    3. A Sermon on the Nature of Faith.    4. Motives to a godly Life, in Ten Sermons, Oxon, 1657.    5. Four Sermons against Disloyalty, Oxon, 1661.    Technogamia; or the Marriage of Arts, a Comedy, acted publicly in  Christ's Church Hall, with no great applause 1617. But the Wits of  those times being willing to distinguish themselves before the King,  were resolved, with leave, to act the same comedy at Woodstock,  whereupon (says Wood) the author making some foolish alterations in  it, it was accordingly acted on Sunday night the 26th of August 1621,  but it being too grave for the King, and too scholastic for the  Audience, or as some said, that the actors in order to remove their  timidity, had taken too much wine before, they began, his Majesty  after two acts offered several times to withdraw; at length being  persuaded by some of those who were near to him, to have patience till  it was ended, lest the young men should be discouraged, he sat it out,  tho' much against his will; upon which these Verses were made by a  certain scholar;      At Christ Church Marriage done before the King    Lest that those Mates should want an offering,    The King himself did offer; what I pray?    He offered twice or thrice to go away.    6. Survey of the World in Ten Books, a Poem, Oxon, 1661, which was  judged by Scholars to be an inconsiderable piece, and by some not to  be his. But being published just before his death, it was taken for a  posthumous work, which had been composed by him in his younger  Days[3].    He translated out of Latin into English the Satires of Persius, Oxon.  1616, in apologizing for the defects of this work, he plays upon the  word _translate_: To have committed no faults in this translation,  says he, would have been to translate myself, and put off man.
