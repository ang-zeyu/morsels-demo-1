[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17396"],[0,"The Secret Garden (#4)"],[1," was being driven to the queer place Mrs. Medlock had spoken  of. She was not at all a timid child and she was not exactly frightened,  but she felt that there was no knowing what might happen in a house with  a hundred rooms nearly all shut up--a house standing on the edge of a  moor.    \"What is a moor?\" she said suddenly to Mrs. Medlock.    \"Look out of the window in about ten minutes and you'll see,\" the woman  answered. \"We've got to drive five miles across Missel Moor before we  get to the Manor. You won't see much because it's a dark night, but you  can see something.\"    Mary asked no more questions but waited in the darkness of her corner,  keeping her eyes on the window. The carriage lamps cast rays of light a  little distance ahead of them and she caught glimpses of the things they  passed. After they had left the station they had driven through a tiny  village and she had seen whitewashed cottages and the lights of a public  house. Then they had passed a church and a vicarage and a little  shop-window or so in a cottage with toys and sweets and odd things set  out for sale. Then they were on the highroad and she saw hedges and  trees. After that there seemed nothing different for a long time--or at  least it seemed a long time to her.    At last the horses began to go more slowly, as if they were climbing  up-hill, and presently there seemed to be no more hedges and no more  trees. She could see nothing, in fact, but a dense darkness on either  side. She leaned forward and pressed her face against the window just as  the carriage gave a big jolt.    \"Eh! We're on the moor now sure enough,\" said Mrs. Medlock.    The carriage lamps shed a yellow light on a rough-looking road which  seemed to be cut through bushes and low growing things which ended in  the great expanse of dark apparently spread out before and around them.  A wind was rising and making a singular, wild, low, rushing sound.    \"It's--it's not the sea, is it?\" said Mary, looking round at her  companion.    \"No, not it,\" answered Mrs. Medlock. \"Nor it isn't fields nor mountains,  it's just miles and miles and miles of wild land that nothing grows on  but heather and gorse and broom, and nothing lives on but wild ponies  and sheep.\"    \"I feel as if it might be the sea, if there were water on it,\" said  Mary. \"It sounds like the sea just now.\"    \"That's the wind blowing through the bushes,\" Mrs. Medlock said. \"It's a  wild, dreary enough place to my mind, though there's plenty that likes  it--particularly when the heather's in bloom.\"    On and on they drove through the darkness, and though the rain stopped,  the wind rushed by and whistled and made strange sounds. The road went  up and down, and several times the carriage passed over a little bridge  beneath which water rushed very fast with a great deal of noise. Mary  felt as if the drive would never come to an end and that the wide, bleak  moor was a wide expanse of black ocean through which she was passing on  a strip of dry land.    \"I don't like it,\" she said to herself. \"I don't like it,\" and she  pinched her thin lips more tightly together.    The horses were climbing up a hilly piece of road when she first caught  sight of a light. Mrs. Medlock saw it as soon as she did and drew a long  sigh of relief.    \"Eh, I am glad to see that bit o' light twinkling,\" she exclaimed. \"It's  the light in the lodge window. We shall get a good cup of tea after a  bit, at all events.\"    It was \"after a bit,\" as she said, for when the carriage passed through  the park gates there was still two miles of avenue to drive through and  the trees (which nearly met overhead) made it seem as if they were  driving through a long dark vault.    They drove out of the vault into a clear space and stopped before an  immensely long but low-built house which seemed to ramble round a stone  court. At first Mary thought that there were no lights at all in the  windows, but as she got out of the carriage she saw that one room in a  corner up-stairs showed a dull glow.    The entrance door was a huge one made of massive, curiously shaped  panels of oak studded with big iron nails and bound with great iron  bars. It opened into an enormous hall, which was so dimly lighted that  the faces in the portraits on the walls and the figures in the suits of  armor made Mary feel that she did not want to look at them. As she stood  on the stone floor she looked a very small, odd little black figure, and  she felt as small and lost and odd as she looked.    A neat, thin old man stood near the manservant who opened the door for  them.    \"You are to take her to her room,\" he said in a husky voice. \"He doesn't  want to see her. He's going to London in the morning.\"    \"Very well, Mr. Pitcher,\" Mrs. Medlock answered. \"So long as I know  what's expected of me, I can manage.\"    \"What's expected of you, Mrs. Medlock,\" Mr. Pitcher said, \"is that you  make sure that he's not disturbed and that he doesn't see what he  doesn't want to see.\"    And then Mary Lennox was led up a broad staircase and down a long  corridor and up a short flight of steps and through another corridor and  another, until a door opened in a wall and she found herself in a room  with a fire in it and a supper on a table.    Mrs. Medlock said unceremoniously:    \"Well, here you are! This room and the next are where you'll live--and  you must keep to them. Don't you forget that!\"    It was in this way Mistress Mary arrived at Misselthwaite Manor and she  had perhaps never felt quite so contrary in all her life.          CHAPTER IV    MARTHA      When she opened her eyes in the morning it was because a young housemaid  had come into her room to light the fire and was kneeling on the  hearth-rug raking out the cinders noisily. Mary lay and watched her for  a few moments and then began to look about the room. She had never seen  a room at all like it and thought it curious and gloomy. The walls were  covered with tapestry with a forest scene embroidered on it. There were  fantastically dressed people under the trees and in the distance there  was a glimpse of the turrets of a castle. There were hunters and horses  and dogs and ladies. Mary felt as if she were in the forest with them.  Out of a deep window she could see a great climbing stretch of land  which seemed to have no trees on it, and to look rather like an endless,  dull, purplish sea.    \"What is that?\" she said, pointing out of the window.    Martha, the young housemaid, who had just risen to her feet, looked and  pointed also.    \"That there?\" she said.    \"Yes.\"    \"That's th' moor,\" with a good-natured grin. \"Does tha' like it?\"    \"No,\" answered Mary. \"I hate it.\"    \"That's because tha'rt not used to it,\" Martha said, going back to her  hearth. \"Tha' thinks it's too big an' bare now. But tha' will like it.\"    \"Do you?\" inquired Mary.    \"Aye, that I do,\" answered Martha, cheerfully polishing away at the  grate. \"I just love it. It's none bare. It's covered wi' growin' things  as smells sweet. It's fair lovely in spring an' summer when th' gorse  an' broom an' heather's in flower. It smells o' honey an' there's such a  lot o' fresh air--an' th' sky looks so high an' th' bees an' skylarks  makes such a nice noise hummin' an' singin'. Eh! I wouldn't live away  from th' moor for anythin'.\"    Mary listened to her with a grave, puzzled expression. The native  servants she had been used to in India were not in the least like this.  They were obsequious and servile and did not presume to talk to their  masters as if they were their equals. They made salaams and called them  \"protector of the poor\" and names of that sort. Indian servants were  commanded to do things, not asked. It was not the custom to say  \"please\" and \"thank you\" and Mary had always slapped her Ayah in the  face when she was angry. She wondered a little what this girl would do  if one slapped her in the face. She was a round, rosy, good-natured  looking creature, but she had a sturdy way which made Mistress Mary  wonder if she might not even slap back--if the person who slapped her  was only a little girl.    \"You are a strange servant,\" she said from her pillows, rather  haughtily.    Martha sat up on her heels, with her blacking-brush in her hand, and  laughed, without seeming the least out of temper.    \"Eh! I know that,\" she said. \"If there was a grand Missus at  Misselthwaite I should never have been even one of th' under housemaids.  I might have been let to be scullery-maid but I'd never have been let  up-stairs. I'm too common an' I talk too much Yorkshire. But this is a  funny house for all it's so grand. Seems like there's neither Master nor  Mistress except Mr. Pitcher an' Mrs. Medlock. Mr. Craven, he won't be  troubled about anythin' when he's here, an' he's nearly always away.  Mrs. Medlock gave me th' place out o' kindness. She told me she could  never have done it if Misselthwaite had been like other big houses.\"    \"Are you going to be my servant?\" Mary asked, still in her imperious  little Indian way.    Martha began to rub her grate again.    \"I'm Mrs. Medlock's servant,\" she said stoutly. \"An' she's Mr.  Craven's--but I'm to do the housemaid's work up here an' wait on you a  bit. But you won't need much waitin' on.\"    \"Who is going to dress me?\" demanded Mary.    Martha sat up on her heels again and stared. She spoke in broad  Yorkshire in her amazement.    \"Canna' tha' dress thysen!\" she said.    \"What do you mean? I don't understand your language,\" said Mary.    \"Eh! I forgot,\" Martha said. \"Mrs. Medlock told me I'd have to be  careful or you wouldn't know what I was sayin'. I mean can't you put on  your own clothes?\"    \"No,\" answered Mary, quite indignantly. \"I never did in my life. My Ayah  dressed me, of course.\"    \"Well,\" said Martha, evidently not in the least aware that she was  impudent, \"it's time tha' should learn. Tha' cannot begin younger. It'll  do thee good to wait on thysen a bit.

THE KID LEARNS SOME THINGS ABOUT HORSES    The Kid--Chip's Kid and the Little Doctor's--was six years old and big  for his age. Also he was a member in good standing of the Happy Family  and he insisted upon being called Buck outside the house; within it the  Little Doctor insisted even more strongly that he answer to the many  endearing names she had invented for him, and to the more formal one of  Claude, which really belonged to Daddy Chip.    Being six years old and big for his age, and being called Buck by  his friends, the Happy Family, the Kid decided that he should have a  man's-sized horse of his own, to feed and water and ride and proudly  call his \"string.\" Having settled that important point, he began to cast  about him for a horse worthy his love and ownership, and speedily he  decided that matter also.    Therefore, he ran bareheaded up to the blacksmith shop where Daddy Chip  was hammering tunefully upon the anvil, and delivered his ultimatum from  the door way.    \"Silver's going to be my string, Daddy Chip, and I'm going to feed him  myself and ride him myself and nobody else can touch him 'thout I say  they can.\"    \"Yes?\" Chip squinted along a dully-glowing iron bar, laid it back upon  the anvil and gave it another whack upon the side that still bulged a  little.    \"Yes, and I'm going to saddle him myself and everything. And I want you  to get me some jingling silver spurs like Mig has got, with chains that  hang away down and rattle when you walk.\" The Kid lifted one small foot  and laid a grimy finger in front of his heel by way of illustration.    \"Yes?\" Chip's eyes twinkled briefly and immediately became intent upon  his work.    \"Yes, and Doctor Dell has got to let me sleep in the bunk-house with the  rest of the fellers. And I ain't going to wear a nightie once more! I  don't have to, do I, Daddy Chip? Not with lace on it. Happy Jack says  I'm a girl long as I wear lace nighties, and I ain't a girl. Am I, Daddy  Chip?\"    \"I should say not!\" Chip testified emphatically, and carried the iron  bar to the forge for further heating.    \"I'm going on roundup too, tomorrow afternoon.\" The Kid's conception  of time was extremely sketchy and had no connection whatever with the  calendar. \"I'm going to keep Silver in the little corral and let him  sleep in the box stall where his leg got well that time he broke it.  I 'member when he had a rag tied on it and teased for sugar. And the  Countess has got to quit a kickin' every time I need sugar for my  string. Ain't she, Daddy Chip? She's got to let us men alone or there'll  be something doing!\"    \"I'd tell a man,\" said Chip inattentively, only half hearing the  war-like declaration of his offspring--as is the way with busy fathers.    \"I'm going to take a ride now on Silver. I guess I'll ride in to Dry  Lake and get the mail--and I'm 'pletely outa the makings, too.\"    \"Uh-hunh--a--what's that? You keep off Silver. He'll kick the daylights  out of you, Kid. Where's your hat? Didn't your mother tell you she'd tie  a sunbonnet on you if you didn't keep your hat on? You better hike back  and get it, young man, before she sees you.\"    The Kid stared mutinously from the doorway. \"You said I could have  Silver. What's the use of having a string if a feller can't ride it? And  I CAN ride him, and he don't kick at all. I rode him just now, in the  little pasture to see if I liked his gait better than the others. I rode  Banjo first and I wouldn't own a thing like him, on a bet. Silver'll do  me till I can get around to break a real one.\"    Chip's hand dropped from the bellows while he stared hard at the Kid.  \"Did you go down in the pasture and--Words failed him just then.    \"I'd TELL a man I did!\" the Kid retorted, with a perfect imitation  of Chip's manner and tone when crossed. \"I've been trying out all the  darned benchest you've got--and there ain't a one I'd give a punched  nickel for but Silver. I'd a rode Shootin' Star, only he wouldn't stand  still so I could get onto him. Whoever broke him did a bum job. The  horse I break will stand, or I'll know the reason why. Silver'll stand,  all right. And I can guide him pretty well by slapping his neck. You did  a pretty fair job when you broke Silver,\" the Kid informed his father  patronizingly.    Chip said something which the Kid was not supposed to hear, and sat  suddenly down upon the stone rim of the forge. It had never before  occurred to Chip that his Kid was no longer a baby, but a most  adventurous man-child who had lived all his life among men and whose  mental development had more than kept pace with his growing body. He had  laughed with the others at the Kid's quaint precociousness of speech and  at his frank worship of range men and range life. He had gone to some  trouble to find a tractable Shetland pony the size of a burro, and had  taught the Kid to ride, decorously and fully protected from accident.    He and the Little Doctor had been proud of the Kid's masculine traits as  they manifested themselves in the management of that small specimen of  horse flesh. That the Kid should have outgrown so quickly his content  with Stubby seemed much more amazing than it really was. He eyed the Kid  doubtfully for a minute, and then grinned.    \"All that don't let you out on the hat question,\" he said, evading the  real issue and laying stress upon the small matter of obedience, as is  the exasperating habit of parents. \"You don't see any of the bunch going  around bareheaded. Only women and babies do that.\"    \"The bunch goes bareheaded when they get their hats blowed off in the  creek,\" the Kid pointed out unmoved. \"I've seen you lose your hat mor'n  once, old timer. That's nothing.\" He sent Chip a sudden, adorable smile  which proclaimed him the child of his mother and which never failed to  thrill Chip secretly,--it was so like the Little Doctor. \"You lend me  your hat for a while, dad,\" he said. \"She never said what hat I had to  wear, just so it's a hat. Honest to gran'ma, my hat's in the creek and  I couldn't poke it out with a stick or anything. It sailed into the  swimmin' hole. I was goin' to go after it,\" he explained further,  \"but--a snake was swimmin--and I hated to 'sturb him.\"    Chip drew a sharp breath and for one panicky moment considered  imperative the hiring of a body-guard for his Kid.    \"You keep out of the pasture, young man!\" His tone was stern to match  his perturbation. \"And you leave Silver alone--\"    The Kid did not wait for more. He lifted up his voice and wept in  bitterness of spirit. Wept so that one could hear him a mile. Wept so  that J. G. Whitmore reading the Great Falls Tribune on the porch, laid  down his paper and asked the world at large what ailed that doggoned kid  now.    \"Dell, you better go see what's wrong,\" he called afterwards through the  open door to the Little Doctor, who was examining a jar of germ  cultures in her \"office.\" \"Chances is he's fallen off the stable or  something--though he sounds more mad than hurt. If it wasn't for my  doggoned back--\"    The Little Doctor passed him hurriedly. When her man-child wept, it  Needed no suggestion from J. G. or anyone else to send her flying to the  rescue. So presently she arrived breathless at the blacksmith shop' and  found Chip within, looking in urgent Need of reinforcements, and the Kid  yelling ragefully beside the door and kicking the log wall with vicious  boot-tees.    \"Shut up now or I'll spank you!\" Chip was saying desperately when his  wife appeared. \"I wish you'd take that Kid and tie him up, Dell,\" he  added snappishly. \"Here he's been riding all the horses in the little  pasture--and taking a chance on breaking his neck! And he ain't  satisfied with Stubby--he thinks he's entitled to Silver!\"    \"Well, why not? There, there, honey--men don't cry when things go  wrong--\"    \"No--because they can take it out in cussing!\" wailed the Kid. \"I  wouldn't cry either, if you'd let me swear all I want to!\"    Chip turned his back precipitately and his shoulders were seen to shake.  The Little Doctor looked shocked.    \"I want Silver for my string!\" cried the Kid, artfully transferring his  appeal to the higher court. \"I can ride him--'cause I have rode him, in  the pasture; and he never bucked once or kicked or anything. Doggone it,  he likes to have me ride him! He comes a-runnin' up to me when I go down  there, and I give him sugar. And then he waits till I climb on his back,  and then we chase the other horses and play ride circle. He wants to  be my string!\" Something in the feel of his mother's arm around his  shoulder whispered hope to the Kid. He looked up at her with his most  endearing smile. \"You come down there and I'll show you,\" he wheedled.  \"We're pals. And I guess YOU wouldn't like to have the boys call you Tom  Thumb, a-ridin' Stubby. He's nothing but a five-cent sample of a horse.  Big Medicine says so. I--I'd rather walk than ride Stubby. And I'm  going on roundup. The boys said I could go when I get a real horse under  me--and I want Silver. Daddy Chip said 'yes' I could have him. And now  he's Injun-giver. Can't I have him, Doctor Dell?\"    The gray-blue eyes clashed with the brown. \"It wouldn't hurt anything  to let the poor little tad show us what he can do,\" said the gray-blue  eyes.    \"Oh--all right,\" yielded the brown, and their owner threw the iron bar  upon the cooling forge and began to turn down his sleeves. \"Why don't  you make him wear a hat?\" he asked reprovingly. \"A little more and he  won't pay any attention to anything you tell him. I'd carry out that  sunbonnet bluff, anyway, if I were you.\"    \"Now, Daddy Chip! I 'splained to you how I lost my hat,\" reproached the  Kid, clinging fast to the Little Doctor's hand.    \"Yes--and you 'splained that you'd have gone into that deep hole and  drowned--with nobody there to pull you out--if you hadn't been scared of  a water snake,\""]]]
