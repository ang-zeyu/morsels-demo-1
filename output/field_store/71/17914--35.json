[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16370"],[0,"Lameness of the Horse (#4)"],[1," bone are likely to pass one another in such a way as to  shorten the distance between the extremities of the injured member.  Contraction of muscles also tends to exert traction upon a bone so  fractured, resulting in a lateral approximation of the diaphysis and  thus preventing union because the broken surfaces are not in proper  contact.    Fractures are _longitudinal_ when the fissure is parallel with the long  axis of the bone. This variety of break is not infrequent in the first  phalanx; and a vertical fracture of the second phalanx is also said to  be longitudinal, however, there is little difference (if any, in some  subjects) between the vertical and transverse diameters of this  particular bone.    _Green stick fractures_ are essentially those resulting from falls to  young animals. They are usually sub-periosteal and when the periosteum  is left intact or nearly so, no crepitation is discernible. If this  fracture is _simple_, prompt recovery may be expected. Bones of young  animals, because they do not contain proportionately as much mineral  substance as do bones of adults, are more resilient and less apt to  become completely fractured. They are, however, subject to what is known  as green stick fracture.    _Impacted fractures_ are usually occasioned by falls. When the weight of  the body is suddenly caught by a member in such manner as to forcefully  drive the epiphyseal portions of bone into and against the diaphysis,  _multiple longitudinal_ fractures occur at the point of least  resistance. Parts so affected undergo a fibrillary separation,  increasing the transverse diameter of the bone; or if the impact has  been sufficiently violent, the portion becomes an amorphous mass.    In a treatise on the subject of lameness, the bones chiefly concerned  and most often affected must be especially considered. The shape and  size of a bone when injured, determines in a measure, the course and  probable outcome in most cases, but of first and greater importance is  the function of the bone. A fracture of the fibula in the horse need not  incapacitate the subject, but a tibial fracture is serious and generally  proves cause for fatal termination. The body of the scapula may be  completely fractured and recovery will probably result in most cases  without much attention being given to the subject, yet a fracture of the  neck of this same bone constitutes an injury of serious consequence. The  difference in the function of different parts of this same bone, as well  as its shape and mode of attachment, determine the gravity of the case;  so it is in fractures of other bones with respect to the course and  prognosis of the case--function is the important factor to be  considered.    Next in importance is the age of the animal suffering fracture of the  bone. Capacity for regeneration is naturally greater in a vigorous,  young animal than in aged or even middle-aged subjects. A healthy  condition of the bone and the body favor the process of repair in case  of fracture, and prognosis may be favorable or unfavorable, depending  upon these factors mentioned for consideration. Individuals of the same  species, differing in temperament, may comport themselves in a manner  that is conductive to prompt recovery, or to early destruction. This  feature cannot be overestimated in importance, as it is sometimes a  decisive element, regardless of other conditions. A horse suffering from  an otherwise remediable pelvic fracture may be so worried and tortured  by being confined in a sling that the case calls for special attention  and care because of the animal's temperament. Sometimes, the constant  presence of a kind attendant will so reassure the subject that it will  become resigned to unnatural confinement, in a day or two. This  precaution may, in itself, determine the outcome, and the wise  veterinarian will not overlook this feature or fail to deviate from the  usual rote in the handling of average cases. Recovery may be brought  about in irritable subjects by this concession to the individual  idiosyncrasies of such animals.      AFFECTIONS OF LIGAMENTS.    Ligaments which have to do with the locomotory apparatus are, for the  most part, inelastic structures which are composed of white fibrous  tissue and serve to join together the articular ends of bones; to bind  down tendons; and to act as sheathes or grooves through which tendons  pass, and as capsular membranes for retention of synovia in contact with  articular surfaces of bones.    Ligaments are injured less frequently than are bones. Because of their  flexibility they escape fracture in the manner that bones suffer. They  are, however, completely severed by being cut or ruptured, though  fibrillary fracture the result of constant or intermittent tensile  strain is of more frequent occurrence.    Simple inflammation of ligaments is of occasional occurrence but, unless  considerable injury is done this tissue, no perceptible manifestation of  injury results. No doubt many cases wherein fibrillary fracture of  ligaments (sprain) takes place some lameness is caused, but because of  the dense, comparatively nonvascular nature of these structures, little  if any manifestation, except lameness, is evident. And such cases, if  recognized are usually diagnosed by excluding the existence of other  possible causes and conditions which might also cause lameness.    Certain ligaments are subjected to strain more than are others and  therefore, when so involved, frequently cause lameness. Examples of this  kind are affections of the collateral (lateral) ligaments of the  phalanges. Because of the leverage afforded by the transverse diameter  of the foot, when an animal is made to travel over uneven road surfaces,  considerable strain is brought to bear on the collateral ligaments of  the phalanges. A sequel to this form of injury is a circumscribed  periostitis at the site of attachment of the ligaments and frequently  the formation of an exostosis--ringbone--results.    Where sudden and violent strain is placed upon a ligament and rupture  occurs, the division is usually effected by the ligament being torn from  its attachment to the bone. In such cases, a portion of periosteum and  bone is usually detached and the condition may then properly be called  one of fracture. In some cases of this kind recovery is tardy, because  of the difficulty in maintaining perfect apposition of the divided  structures, and reactionary inflammation is not of sufficient extent to  enhance prompt repair. In fact, some cases of this kind seem to progress  more favorably, when no attempt at immobilization of the affected member  is attempted.    If some freedom of movement is allowed, acute inflammation resulting in  nature's provisional swelling soon develops and repair is hastened  because of increased vascularity. But where luxation of phalanges  accompanies sprain, reposition and immobilization are necessary--that is  if cases are thought likely to benefit by any treatment.      Luxations--Dislocations.    Luxation or dislocation is a condition where the normal relation between  articular ends of bones has been deranged to the extent that partial or  complete loss of function results. When a bone is luxated (out of  joint), there has occurred a partial or complete rupture of certain  ligaments or tendons; or a bone may be luxated when an abnormal or  unusual elasticity of inhibitory ligaments or tendons obtains.    Luxations may be practically classified as _temporary_ and _fixed_. In  temporary luxations, disarticulation is but momentary and spontaneous  reposition always results; while a fixed luxation does not reduce  spontaneously but remains luxated until reposition is effected by proper  manipulation and treatment. Fixed luxation may be of such character as  to be practically irreducible because of extensive damage done to  ligaments or cartilage. Where a complete luxation of the  metacarpophalangeal joint exists, it is probable that in most cases  sufficient injury to collateral and capsular ligaments has been done to  render complete recovery improbable, if not impossible.    Temporary luxation of the patella is a common affection of the horse and  fixed luxation of this bone also occurs. As a matter of fact, in the  horse, patellar luxation is the one frequent affection of this kind.    As a rule, complete disarticulation immobilizes the affected joint and  in most instances there is noticeable an abnormal prominence in the  immediate vicinity--in patellar luxation, the whole bone. In other  instances the articular portion only, of the affected bone is  malpositioned. Usually, luxation and fracture may be differentiated in  that there is no crepitation in luxation and more or less crepitation  exists in fracture.    It is evident, when one considers the symptomatology and nature of the  affection, that fixed luxation is usually caused by undue strain or  violent and abnormal movement of a part. Joints having the greater  freedom of movement are apt to suffer luxation more frequently.      Arthritis.    The study of arthritis in the horse is limited to a consideration of  joint inflammations which, for the most part, are of traumatic origin.  Unlike the human, the horse is not subject to many forms of specific  arthritis--tubercular, gonorrheal, syphilitic, etc.    A practical manner of classification of arthritis is _traumatic_ and  _metastatic_.    _Traumatic arthritis_ may result from all sorts of accidents wherein  joints are contused. Such cases may be considered as being caused by  direct injuries. Instances of this kind, depending on the degree of  insult, manifest evidence of injury which ranges from a simple  synovitis to the most active inflammatory involvement of the entire  structure and adjacent tissues.    The reactionary inflammation which attends a case of tarsitis caused by  a horse being kicked is a good example of the result of direct injury.  Such"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16378"],[0,"The Art of Perfumery, and Methods of Obtaining the Odors of Plants (#4)"],[1,"conception of those even used to abstract statistics.    To the chemical philosopher, the study of perfumery opens a book as yet  unread; for the practical perfumer, on his laboratory shelves, exhibits  many rare essential oils, such as essential oil of the flower of the  _Acacia farnesiana_, essential oil of violets, tubereuse, jasmine, and  others, the compositions of which have yet to be determined.    The exquisite pleasure derived from smelling fragrant flowers would  almost instinctively induce man to attempt to separate the odoriferous  principle from them, so as to have the perfume when the season denies  the flowers. Thus we find the alchemists of old, torturing the plants in  every way their invention could devise for this end; and it is on their  experiments that the whole art of perfumery has been reared. Without  recapitulating those facts which may be found diffused through nearly  all the old authors on medical botany, chemistry, pharmacy, and works of  this character, from the time of Paracelsus to Celnart, we may state at  once the mode of operation adopted by the practical perfumer of the  present day for preparing the various extracts or essences, waters,  oils, pomades, &c., used in his calling.    The processes are divided into four distinct operations; viz.--    1. _Expression_; 2. _Distillation_; 3. _Maceration_; 4. _Absorption_.    1. _Expression_ is only adopted where the plant is very prolific in its  volatile or essential oil,--_i.e._ its odor; such, for instance, as is  found in the pellicle or outer peel of the orange, lemon, and citron,  and a few others. In these cases, the parts of the plant containing the  odoriferous principle are put sometimes in a cloth bag, and at others by  themselves into a press, and by mere mechanical force it is squeezed  out. The press is an iron vessel of immense strength, varying in size  from six inches in diameter, and twelve deep, and upwards, to contain  one hundred weight or more; it has a small aperture at the bottom to  allow the expressed material to run for collection; in the interior is  placed a perforated false bottom, and on this the substance to be  squeezed is placed, covered with an iron plate fitting the interior;  this is connected with a powerful screw, which, being turned, forces the  substance so closely together, that the little vessels containing the  essential oils are burst, and it thus escapes. The common tincture press  is indeed a model of such an instrument. The oils which are thus  collected are contaminated with watery extracts, which exudes at the  same time, and from which it has to be separated; this it does by itself  in a measure, by standing in a quiet place, and it is then poured off  and strained.    [Illustration: Pipette to draw off small portions of otto from water.]    2. _Distillation._--The plant, or part of it, which contains the  odoriferous principle, is placed in an iron, copper, or glass pan,  varying in size from that capable of holding from one to twenty gallons,  and covered with water; to the pan a dome-shaped lid is fitted,  terminating with a pipe, which is twisted corkscrew fashion, and fixed  in a bucket, with the end peeping out like a tap in a barrel. The water  in the still--for such is the name of the apparatus--is made to boil;  and having no other exit, the steam must pass through the coiled pipe;  which, being surrounded with cold water in the bucket, condenses the  vapor before it can arrive at the tap. With the steam, the volatile  oils--_i.e._ perfume--rises, and is liquefied at the same time. The  liquids which thus run over, on standing for a time, separate into two  portions, and are finally divided with a funnel having a stopcock in the  narrow part of it. By this process, the majority of the volatile or  essential oils are procured. In some few instances alcohol--_i.e._  rectified spirit of wine--is placed upon the odorous materials in lieu  of water, which, on being distilled, comes away with the perfuming  substance dissolved in it. But this process is now nearly obsolete, as  it is found more beneficial to draw the oil or essence first with water,  and afterwards to dissolve it in the spirit. The low temperature at  which spirit boils, compared with water, causes a great loss of  essential oil, the heat not being sufficient to disengage it from the  plant, especially where seeds such as cloves or caraway are employed. It  so happens, however, that the finest odors, the _recherche_ as the  Parisians say, cannot be procured by this method; then recourse is had  to the next process.    [Illustration: Tap funnel for separating ottos from water and spirits  from oil.]    3. _Maceration._--Of all the processes for procuring the perfumes of  flowers, this is the most important to the perfumer, and is the least  understood in England; as this operation yields not only the most  exquisite essences indirectly, but also nearly all those fine pomades  known here as \"French pomatums,\" so much admired for the strength of  fragrance, together with \"French oils\" equally perfumed. The operation  is conducted thus:--For what is called pomade, a certain quantity of  purified mutton or deer suet is put into a clean metal or porcelain pan,  this being melted by a steam heat; the kind of flowers required for the  odor wanted are carefully picked and put into the liquid fat, and  allowed to remain from twelve to forty-eight hours; the fat has a  particular affinity or attraction for the oil of flowers, and thus, as  it were, draws it out of them, and becomes itself, by their aid, highly  perfumed; the fat is strained from the spent flowers, and fresh are  added four or five times over, till the pomade is of the required  strength; these various strengths of pomatums are noted by the French  makers as Nos. 6, 12, 18, and 24, the higher numerals indicating the  amount of fragrance in them. For perfumed oils the same operation is  followed; but, in lieu of suet, fine olive oil or oil of ben, derived  from the ben nuts of the Levant, is used, and the same results are  obtained. These oils are called \"Huile Antique\" of such and such a  flower.    When neither of the foregoing processes gives satisfactory results, the  method of procedure adopted is by,--    4. _Absorption_, or _Enfleurage._--The odors of some flowers are so  delicate and volatile, that the heat required in the previously named  processes would greatly modify, if not entirely spoil them; this  process is, therefore, conducted cold, thus:--Square frames, about three  inches deep, with a glass bottom, say two feet wide and three feet long,  are procured; over the glass a layer of fat is spread, about half an  inch thick, with a kind of plaster knife or spatula; into this the  flower buds are stuck, cup downwards, and ranged completely over it, and  there left from twelve to seventy-two hours.    Some houses, such as that of Messrs. Pilar and Sons; Pascal Brothers; H.  Herman, and a few others, have 3000 such frames at work during the  season; as they are filled, they are piled one over the other, the  flowers are changed so long as the plants continue to bloom, which now  and then exceeds two or three months.    For oils of the same plants, coarse linen cloths are imbued with the  finest olive oil or oil of ben, and stretched upon a frame made of iron;  on these the flowers are laid and suffered to remain a few days. This  operation is repeated several times, after which the cloths are  subjected to great pressure, to remove the now perfumed oil.    As we cannot give any general rule for working, without misleading the  reader, we prefer explaining the process required for each when we come  to speak of the individual flower or plant.          SECTION III.      Whenever a Still is named, or an article is said to be distilled or  \"drawn,\" it must be understood to be done so by steam apparatus, as this  is the only mode which can be adopted for obtaining anything like a  delicate odor; the old plan of having the fire immediately under the  still, conveying an empyreumatic or burnt smell to the result, has  become obsolete in every well-regulated perfumatory.    The steam-still differs from the one described only in the lower part,  or pan, which is made double, so as to allow steam from a boiler to  circulate round the pan for the purpose of boiling the contents, instead  of the direct fire. In macerating, the heat is applied in the same way,  or by a contrivance like the common glue-pot, as made use of nowadays.    This description of apparatus will be found very useful for experiments  which we will suggest by-and-by.    The perfumes for the handkerchief, as found in the shops of Paris and  London, are either simple or compound; the former are called extracts,  _extraits_, _esprits_, or essences, and the latter _bouquets_ and  nosegays, which are mixtures of the extracts so compounded in quantity  that no one flower or odor can be discovered as predominating over  another; and when made of the delicate-scented flowers carefully  blended, they produce an exquisite sensation on the olfactory nerve,  and are therefore much prized by all who can afford to purchase them.    We shall first explain the mode for obtaining the simple extracts of  flowers. This will be followed by the process for preparing ambergris,  musk, and civet, substances, which, though of animal origin, are of the  utmost importance as forming a large part in the most approved bouquets;  and we shall conclude this department of the art with recipes for all  the fashionable bouquets and nosegays, the value of which, we doubt not,  will be estimated according to the labor bestowed upon their analysis.    In order to render the work more easy of consultation, we have adopted  the alphabetical arrangement in preference to a more scientific  classification.
