[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13486"],[0,"The Story of Sigurd the Volsung (#4)"],[1,"   So sweet his speaking sounded, so wise his words did seem,    That moveless all men sat there, as in a happy dream    We stir not lest we waken; but there his speech had end,    And slowly down the hall-floor, and outward did he wend;    And none would cast him a question or follow on his ways,    For they knew that the gift was Odin's, a sword for the world to praise.      But now spake Volsung the King: \"Why sit ye silent and still?    Is the Battle-Father's visage a token of terror and ill?    Arise O Volsung Children, Earls of the Goths arise,    And set your hands to the hilts as mighty men and wise!    Yet deem it not too easy; for belike a fateful blade    Lies there in the heart of the Branstock for a fated warrior made.\"      Now therewith spake King Siggeir: \"King Volsung give me a grace    To try it the first of all men, lest another win my place    And mere chance-hap steal my glory and the gain that I might win.\"      Then somewhat laughed King Volsung, and he said: \"O Guest, begin;    Though herein is the first as the last, for the Gods have long to live,    Nor hath Odin yet forgotten unto whom the gift he would give.\"      Then forth to the tree went Siggeir, the Goth-folk's mighty lord,    And laid his hand on the gemstones, and strained at the glorious sword    Till his heart grew black with anger; and never a word he said    As he wended back to the high-seat: but Signy waxed blood-red    When he sat him adown beside her; and her heart was nigh to break    For the shame and the fateful boding: and therewith King Volsung spake:      \"Thus comes back empty-handed the mightiest King of Earth,    And how shall the feeble venture? yet each man knows his worth;    And today may a great beginning from a little seed upspring    To o'erpass many a great one that hath the name of King:    So stand forth free and unfree; stand forth both most and least:    But first ye Earls of the Goth-folk, ye lovely lords we feast.\"      Upstood the Earls of Siggeir, and each man drew anigh    And deemed his time was coming for a glorious gain and high;    But for all their mighty shaping and their deeds in the battle-wood,    No looser in the Branstock that gift of Odin stood.    Then uprose Volsung's homemen, and the fell-abiding folk;    And the yellow-headed shepherds came gathering round the Oak,    And the searchers of the thicket and the dealers with the oar:    And the least and the worst of them all was a mighty man of war.    But for all their mighty shaping, and the struggle and the strain    Of their hands, the deft in labour, they tugged thereat in vain;    And still as the shouting and jeers, and the names of men and the laughter    Beat backward from gable to gable, and rattled o'er roof-tree and rafter,    Moody and still sat Siggeir; for he said: \"They have trained me here    As a mock for their woodland bondsmen; and yet shall they buy it dear.\"      Now the tumult sank a little, and men cried on Volsung the King    And his sons, the hedge of battle, to try the fateful thing.    So Volsung laughed, and answered: \"I will set me to the toil,    Lest these my guests of the Goth-folk should deem I fear the foil.    Yet nought am I ill-sworded, and the oldest friend is best;    And this, my hand's first fellow, will I bear to the grave-mound's rest,    Nor wield meanwhile another: Yea, this shall I have in hand    When mid the host of Odin in the Day of Doom I stand.\"      Therewith from his belt of battle he raised the golden sheath,    And showed the peace-strings glittering about the hidden death:    Then he laid his hand on the Branstock, and cried: \"O tree beloved,    I thank thee of thy good-heart that so little thou art moved:    Abide thou thus, green bower, when I am dead and gone    And the best of all my kindred a better day hath won!\"      Then as a young man laughed he, and on the hilts of gold    His hand, the battle-breaker, took fast and certain hold,    And long he drew and strained him, but mended not the tale,    Yet none the more thereover his mirth of heart did fail;    But he wended to the high-seat and thence began to cry:      \"Sons I have gotten and cherished, now stand ye forth to try;    Lest Odin tell in God-home how from the way he strayed,    And how to the man he would not he gave away his blade.\"    So therewithal rose Rerir, and wasted might and main;    Then Gunthiof, and then Hunthiof, they wearied them in vain;    Nought was the might of Agnar; nought Helgi could avail;    Sigi the tall and Solar no further brought the tale,    Nor Geirmund the priest of the temple, nor Gylfi of the wood.      At last by the side of the Branstock Sigmund the Volsung stood,    And with right hand wise in battle the precious sword-hilt caught,    Yet in a careless fashion, as he deemed it all for nought:    When lo, from floor to rafter went up a shattering shout,    For aloft in the hand of Sigmund the naked blade shone out    As high o'er his head he shook it: for the sword had come away    From the grip of the heart of the Branstock, as though all loose it lay.    A little while he stood there mid the glory of the hall,    Like the best of the trees of the garden, when the April sunbeams fall    On its blossomed boughs in the morning, and tell of the days to be;    Then back unto the high-seat he wended soberly;    For this was the thought within him; Belike the day shall come    When I shall bide here lonely amid the Volsung home,    Its glory and sole avenger, its after-summer seed.    Yea, I am the hired of Odin, his workday will to speed,    And the harvest-tide shall be heavy.--What then, were it come and past    And I laid by the last of the sheaves with my wages earned at the last?      He lifted his eyes as he thought it, for now was he come to his place,    And there he stood by his father and met Siggeir face to face,    And he saw him blithe and smiling, and heard him how he spake:    \"O best of the sons of Volsung, I am merry for thy sake    And the glory that thou hast gained us; but whereas thine hand and heart    Are e'en now the lords of the battle, how lack'st thou for thy part    A matter to better the best? Wilt thou overgild fine gold    Or dye the red rose redder? So I prithee let me hold    This sword that comes to thine hand on the day I wed thy kin.    For at home have I a store-house; there is mountain-gold therein    The weight of a war-king's harness; there is silver plenteous store;    There is iron, and huge-wrought amber, that the southern men love sore,    When they sell me the woven wonder, the purple born of the sea;    And it hangeth up in that bower, and all this is a gift for thee:    But the sword that came to my wedding, methinketh it meet and right,    That it lie on my knees in the council and stead me in the fight.\"      But Sigmund laughed and answered, and he spake a scornful word:    \"And if I take twice that treasure, will it buy me Odin's sword,    And the gift that the Gods have given? will it buy me again to stand    Betwixt two mightiest world-kings with a longed-for thing in mine hand    That all their might hath missed of? when the purple-selling men    Come buying thine iron and amber, dost thou sell thine honour then?    Do they wrap it in bast of the linden, or run it in moulds of earth?    And shalt thou account mine honour as a matter of lesser worth?    Came the sword to thy wedding, Goth-king, to thine hand it never came,    And thence is thine envy whetted to deal me this word of shame.\"      Black then was the heart of Siggeir, but his face grew pale and red,    Till he drew a smile thereover, and spake the word and said:    \"Nay, pardon me, Signy's kinsman! when the heart desires o'ermuch    It teacheth the tongue ill speaking, and my word belike was such.    But the honour of thee and thy kindred, I hold it even as mine,    And I love you as my heart-blood, and take ye this for a sign.    I bid thee now King Volsung, and these thy glorious sons,    And thine earls and thy dukes of battle and all thy mighty ones,    To come to the house of the Goth-kings as honoured guests and dear    And abide the winter over; that the dusky days and drear    May be glorious with thy presence, that all folk may praise my life,    And the friends that my fame hath gotten; and that this my new-wed wife    Thine eyes may make the merrier till she bear my eldest born.\"      Then speedily answered Volsung: \"No king of the earth might scorn    Such noble bidding, Siggeir; and surely will I come    To look upon thy glory and the Goths' abundant home.    But let two months wear over, for I have many a thing    To shape and shear in the Woodland, as befits a people's king:    And thou meanwhile here abiding of all my goods shalt be free,    And then shall we twain together roof over the glass-green sea    With the sides of our golden dragons; and our war-hosts' blended shields    Shall fright the sea-abiders and the folk of the fishy fields.\"      Answered the smooth-speeched Siggeir: \"I thank thee well for this,    And thy bidding is most kingly; yet take it not amiss    That I wend my ways in the morning; for we Goth-folk know indeed    That the sea is a foe full deadly, and a friend that fails at need.\"           *       *       *       *       *      And for all the words of Volsung e'en so must the matter be,    And Siggeir the Goth and Signy on the morn shall sail the sea.    Then the feast sped on the fairer, far into the night, but amidst the  mirth Sigmund and Signy were sad at heart. And before the sun was  risen next day Signy came to her father in secret and begged him to  stay in his own country rather than trust the guileful heart and  murder-loving hand of Siggeir. But Volsung answered that he must go  to be Siggeir's guest, for he could not break his pledged word  through fear of peril. So on the morrow the smooth-speeched Siggeir  departed with Signy, and when two months were passed Volsung made  ready to visit them.      _How "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13487"],[0,"The Ideal Bartender (#4)"],[1,"Oranges, sliced.    1 Pineapple, sliced.    1 box Strawberries.    2 bottles (quarts) Apollinaris Water.
