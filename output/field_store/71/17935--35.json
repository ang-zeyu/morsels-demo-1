[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16772"],[0,"The Story of a Soul (L'Histoire d'une Âme): The Autobiography of St. Thérèse of (#4)"],[1,"shows His infinite greatness. As the sun shines both on  the cedar and on the floweret, so the Divine Sun illumines every  soul, great and small, and all correspond to His care--just as in  nature the seasons are so disposed that on the appointed day the  humblest daisy shall unfold its petals.    You will wonder, dear Mother, to what all this is leading, for  till now I have said nothing that sounds like the story of my  life; but did you not tell me to write quite freely whatever came  into my mind? So, it will not be my life properly speaking, that  you will find in these pages, but my thoughts about the graces  which it has pleased Our Lord to bestow on me.    I am now at a time of life when I can look back on the past, for  my soul has been refined in the crucible of interior and exterior  trials. Now, like a flower after the storm, I can raise my head  and see that the words of the Psalm are realised in me: \"The Lord  is my Shepherd and I shall want nothing. He hath set me in a place  of pasture. He hath brought me up on the water of refreshment. He  hath converted my soul. He hath led me on the paths of justice for  His own Name's sake. For though I should walk in the midst of the  shadow of death, I will fear no evils for Thou are with me.\"[6]    Yes, to me Our Lord has always been \"compassionate and merciful,  long-suffering and plenteous in mercy.\"[7]    And so it gives me great joy, dear Mother, to come to you and sing  His unspeakable mercies. It is for you alone that I write the  story of the little flower gathered by Jesus. This thought will  help me to speak freely, without troubling either about style or  about the many digressions that I shall make; for a Mother's heart  always understands her child, even when it can only lisp, and so I  am sure of being understood and my meaning appreciated.    If a little flower could speak, it seems to me that it would tell  us quite simply all that God has done for it, without hiding any  of its gifts. It would not, under the pretext of humility, say  that it was not pretty, or that it had not a sweet scent, that the  sun had withered its petals, or the storm bruised its stem, if it  knew that such were not the case.    The Little Flower, that now tells her tale, rejoiced in having to  publish the wholly undeserved favours bestowed upon her by Our  Lord. She knows that she had nothing in herself worthy of  attracting Him: His Mercy alone showered blessings on her. He  allowed her to grow in holy soil enriched with the odour of  purity, and preceded by eight lilies of shining whiteness. In His  Love He willed to preserve her from the poisoned breath of the  world--hardly had her petals unfolded when this good Master  transplanted her to the mountain of Carmel, Our Lady's chosen  garden.    And now, dear Mother, having summed up in a few words all that  God's goodness has done for me, I will relate in detail the story  of my childhood. I know that, though to others it may seem  wearisome, your motherly heart will find pleasure in it. In the  story of my soul, up to the time of my entry into the Carmel,  there are three clearly marked periods: the first, in spite of its  shortness, is by no means the least rich in memories.    It extends from the dawn of reason to the death of my dearly loved  Mother; in other words, till I was four years and eight months  old. God, in His goodness, did me the favour of awakening my  intelligence very early, and He has imprinted the recollections of  my childhood so deeply in my memory that past events seem to have  happened but yesterday. Without doubt He wished to make me know  and appreciate the Mother He had given me. Alas! His Divine Hand  soon took her from me to crown her in Heaven.    All my life it has pleased Him to surround me with affection. My  first recollections are of loving smiles and tender caresses; but  if He made others love me so much, He made me love them too, for I  was of an affectionate nature.    You can hardly imagine how much I loved my Father and Mother, and,  being very demonstrative, I showed my love in a thousand little  ways, though the means I employed make me smile now when I think  of them.    Dear Mother, you have given me the letters which my Mother wrote  at this time to Pauline, who was at school at the Visitation  Convent at Le Mans. I remember perfectly the events they refer to,  but it will be easier for me simply to quote some passages, though  these charming letters, inspired by a Mother's love, are too often  full of my praises.    In proof of what I have said about my way of showing affection for  my parents, here is an example: \"Baby is the dearest little rogue;  she comes to kiss me, and at the same time wishes me to die. 'Oh,  how I wish you would die, dear Mamma,' she said, and when she was  scolded she was quite astonished, and answered: 'But I want you to  go to Heaven, and you say we must die to go there'; and in her  outburst of affection for her Father she wishes him to die too.  The dear little thing will hardly leave me, she follows me  everywhere, but likes going into the garden best; when I am not  there she refuses to stay, and cries so much that they are obliged  to bring her back. She will not even go upstairs alone without  calling me at each step, 'Mamma! Mamma!' and if I forget to answer  'Yes, darling!' she waits where she is, and will not move.\"    I was nearly three years old when my Mother wrote: \"Little Therese  asked me the other day if she would go to Heaven. 'Yes, if you are  good,' I told her. 'Oh, Mamma,' she answered, 'then if I am not  good, shall I go to Hell? Well, you know what I will do--I shall  fly to you in Heaven, and you will hold me tight in your arms, and  how could God take me away then?' I saw that she was convinced  that God could do nothing to her if she hid herself in my arms.\"    \"Marie loves her little sister very much; indeed she is a child  who delights us all. She is extraordinarily outspoken, and it is  charming to see her run after me to confess her childish faults:  'Mamma, I have pushed Celine; I slapped her once, but I'll not do  it again.' The moment she has done anything mischievous, everyone  must know. Yesterday, without meaning to do so, she tore off a  small piece of wall paper; you would have been sorry for her--she  wanted to tell her father immediately. When he came home four  hours later, everyone else had forgotten about it, but she ran at  once to Marie saying: 'Tell Papa that I tore the paper.' She  waited there like a criminal for sentence; but she thinks she is  more easily forgiven if she accuses herself.\"    Papa's name fills me with many happy memories. Mamma laughingly  said he always did whatever I wanted, but he answered: \"Well, why  not? She is the Queen!\" Then he would lift me on to his shoulder,  and caress me in all sorts of ways. Yet I cannot say that he  spoilt me. I remember one day while I was swinging he called out  as he passed: \"Come and kiss me, little Queen.\" Contrary to my  usual custom, I would not stir, and answered pertly: \"You must  come for it, Papa.\" He refused quite rightly, and went away. Marie  was there and scolded me, saying: \"How naughty to answer Papa like  that!\" Her reproof took effect; I got off the swing at once, and  the whole house resounded with my cries. I hurried upstairs, not  waiting this time to call Mamma at each step; my one thought was  to find Papa and make my peace with him. I need not tell you that  this was soon done.    I could not bear to think I had grieved my beloved parents, and I  acknowledged my faults instantly, as this little anecdote, related  by my Mother, will show: \"One morning before going downstairs I  wanted to kiss Therese; she seemed to be fast asleep, and I did  not like to wake her, but Marie said: 'Mamma, I am sure she is  only pretending.' So I bent down to kiss her forehead, and  immediately she hid herself under the clothes, saying in the tone  of a spoilt child: 'I don't want anyone to look at me.' I was not  pleased with her, and told her so. A minute or two afterwards I  heard her crying, and was surprised to see her by my side. She had  got out of her cot by herself, and had come downstairs with bare  feet, stumbling over her long nightdress. Her little face was wet  with tears: 'Mamma,' she said, throwing herself on my knee, 'I am  sorry for being naughty--forgive me!' Pardon was quickly granted;  I took the little angel in my arms and pressed her to my heart,  smothering her with kisses.\"    I remember also my great affection for my eldest sister Marie, who  had just left school. Without seeming to do so, I took in all that  I saw and heard, and I think that I reflected on things then as I  do now. I listened attentively while she taught Celine, and was  very good and obedient, so as to obtain the privilege of being  allowed in the room during lessons. She gave me many trifling  presents which pleased me greatly. I was proud of my two big  sisters; but as Pauline seemed so far away from us, I thought of  her all day long. When I was only just learning to talk, and Mamma  asked: \"What are you thinking about?\" my answer invariably was:  \"Pauline.\" Sometimes I heard people saying that Pauline would be a  nun, and, without quite knowing what it meant, I thought: \"I will  be a nun too.\" This is one of my first recollections, and I have  never changed my mind; so it was the example of this beloved  sister which, from the age of two, drew me to the Divine Spouse of  Virgins. My dearest Mother, what tender memories of Pauline I  could confide to you here! But it would take me too long.    Leonie had also a very warm place in my heart; she loved me very  much, and her love was returned. In the evening when she came home  from school she used to take care of me while the others went out,  and it seems to me I can still hear the sweet songs she sang to  put me to sleep. I remember perfectly the day of her First  Communion, and I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/168"],[0,"The History and Practice of the Art of Photography (#4)"],[1,"board b will throw c into shadow; that is, obstruct all rays of light  that would otherwise fall on c, and if b were removed c would in like  manner hide the light from d--Now, if b recieve as much light as would  fall on c whose surface is four times as large, the light must be four  times as powerful and sixteen times as powerful as that which would  fall on the second and third boards, because the same quantity of light  is diffused over a space four and sixteen times greater.  These same  rays may be collected and their intensity again increased.    Rays of light are reflected from one surface to another; Refracted, or  bent, as they pass from the surface of one transparent medium to  another; and Inflected, or turned from their course, by the attraction  of opaque bodies.  From the first we derive the principles on which  mirrors are constructed; to the second we are indebted for the power of  the lenses, and the blessings of sight,--for the light acts upon the  retina of the eye in the same manner as on the lens of a camera.  The  latter has no important bearing upon our subject.    When a ray of light falls perpendicularly upon an opaque body, it is  reflected bark in the same line in which it proceeds; in this case the  reflected ray returns in the same path the incident ray traversed; but  when a ray falls obliquely, it is reflected obliquely, that is, it is  thrown off in opposite direction, and as far from the perpendicular as  was the incident ray, as shown at Fig. 2; a representing the incident  ray and b the reflected.  The point, or angle c made by the incident  ray, at the surface of the reflector e f, with a line c d,  perpendicular to that surface, is called the angle of incidence, while  the angle formed by the reflected ray b and the perpendicular line d is  called the angle of reflection, and these angles are always equal.    [Illustration: Fig. 2 (hipho_2.gif)]    It is by this reflection of light that objects are made visible; but  unless light falls directly upon the eye they are invisible, and are  not sensibly felt until after a certain series of operations upon the  various coverings and humors of the eye.  Smooth and polished surfaces  reflect light most powerfully, and send to the eye the images of the  objects from which the light proceeded before reflection.  Glass, which  is transparent--transmitting light--would be of no use to us as a  mirror, were it not first coated on one side with a metalic amalgam,  which interrupts the rays in their passage from the glass into the air,  and throws them either directly in the incident line, or in an oblique  direction.  The reason why trees, rocks and animals are not all  mirrors, reflecting other forms instead of their own, is, that their  surfaces are uneven, and rays of light reflected from an uneven surface  are diffused in all directions.    Parallel rays falling obliquely upon a plane mirror are reflected  parallel; converging rays, with the same degree of convergence; and  diverging rays equally divergent.    Stand before a mirror and your image is formed therein, and appears to  be as far behind the glass as you are before it, making the angle of  reflection equal to that of incidence, as before stated.  The incident  ray and the reflected ray form, together, what is called the passage of  reflection, and this will therefore make the actual distance of an  image to appear as far again from the eye as it really is.  Any object  which reflects light is called a radiant.  The point behind a  reflecting surface, from which they appear to diverge, is called the  virtual focus.    Rays of light being reflected at the same angle at which they fall upon  a mirror, two persons can stand in such a position that each can see  the image of the other without seeing his own.  Again; you may see your  whole figure in a mirror half your length, but if you stand before one  a few inches shorter the whole cannot be reflected, as the incident ray  which passes from your feet into the mirror in the former case, will in  the latter fall under it.  Images are always reversed in mirrors.    Convex mirrors reflect light from a rounded surface and disperse the  rays in every direction, causing parallel rays to diverge, diverging  rays to diverge more, and converging rays to converge less--they  represent objects smaller than they really are--because the angle  formed by the reflected ray is rendered more acute by a convex than by  a plane surface, and it is the diminishing of the visual angle, by  causing rays of light to be farther extended before they meet in a  point, which produces the image of convex mirrors.  The greater the  convexity of a mirror, the more will the images of the objects be  diminished, and the nearer will they appear to the surface.  These  mirrors furnish science with many curious and pleasing facts.    Concave mirrors are the reverse of convex; the latter being rounded  outwards, the former hollowed inwards--they render rays of light more  converging--collect rays instead of dispersing them, and magnify  objects while the convex diminishes them.    Rays of light may be collected in the focus of a mirror to such  intensity as to melt metals.  The ordinary burning glass is an  illustration of this fact; although the rays of light are refracted, or  passed through the glass and concentrated into a focus beneath.    When incident rays are parallel, the reflected rays converge to a  focus, but when the incident rays proceed from a focus, or are  divergent, they are reflected parallel.  It is only when an object is  nearer to a concave mirror than its centre of concavity, that its image  is magnified; for when the object is farther from the mirror, this  centre will appear less than the object, and in an inverted position.    The centre of concavity in a concave mirror, is an imaginary point  placed in the centre of a circle formed by continuing the boundary of  the concavity of the mirror from any one point of the edge to another  parallel to and beneath it.    REFRACTION OF LIGHT:--I now pass to the consideration of the passage of  light through bodies.    A ray of light failing perpendicularly through the air upon a surface  of glass or water passes on in a straight line through the body; but if  it, in passing from one medium to another of different density, fall  obliquely, it is bent from its direct course and recedes from it,  either towards the right or left, and this bending is called  refraction; (see Fig. 3, b.) If a ray of light passes from a rarer into  a denser medium it is refracted towards a perpendicular in that medium;  but if it passes from a denser into rarer it is bent further from a  perpendicular in that medium.  Owing to this bending of the rays of  light the angles of refraction and incidence are never equal.    Transparent bodies differ in their power of bending light--as a general  rule, the refractive power is proportioned to the density--but the  chemical constitution of bodies as well as their density, is found to  effect their refracting power.  Inflammable bodies possess this power  to a great degree.    The sines of the angle of incidence and refraction (that is, the  perpendicular drawn from the extremity of an arc to the diameter of a  circle,) are always in the same ratio; viz:  from air into water, the  sine of the angle of refraction is nearly as four to three, whatever be  the position of the ray with respect to the refracting surface.  From  air into sulphur, the sine of the angle of refraction is as two to  one--therefore the rays of light cannot be refracted whenever the sine  of the angle of refraction becomes equal to the radius* of a circle,  and light falling very obliquely upon a transparent medium ceases to be  refracted; this is termed total reflection.    * The RADIUS of a circle is a straight line passing from the centre to  the circumference.    Since the brightness of a reflected image depends upon the quantity of  light, it is quite evident that those images which arise from total  reflection are by far the most vivid, as in ordinary cases of  reflection a portion of light is absorbed.    I should be pleased to enter more fully into this branch of the science  of optics, but the bounds to which I am necessarily limited in a work  of this kind will not admit of it.  In the next chapter, however, I  shall give a synopsis of Mr. Hunt's treatise on the \"Influence of the  Solar Rays on Compound Bodies, with especial reference to their  Photographic application\"--a work which should be in the hands of every  Daguerreotypist, and which I hope soon to see republished in this  country.  I will conclude this chapter with a brief statement of the  principles upon which the Photographic art is founded.    SOLAR and Stellar light contains three kinds of rays, viz:    1.  Colorific, or rays of color.    2.  Calorific, or rays of heat.    3.  Chemical rays, or those which produce chemical effects.    On the first and third the Photographic principle depends.  In  explaining this principle the accompanying wood cuts, (figs. 3 and 4)  will render it more intelligible.    If a pencil of the sun's rays fall upon a prism, it is bent in passing  through the transparent medium; and some rays being more refracted than  others, we procure an elongated image of the luminous beam, exhibiting  three distinct colors, red, yellow and blue, which are to be regarded  as primitives--and from their interblending, seven, as recorded by  Newton, and shown in the accompanying wood cut.  These rays being  absorbed, or reflected differently by various bodies, give to nature  the charm of color.  Thus to the eve is given the pleasure we derive in  looking upon the green fields and forests, the enumerable varieties of  flowers, the glowing ruby, jasper, topaz, amethist, and emerald, the  brilliant diamond, and all the rich and varied hues of nature, both  animate and inanimate.
