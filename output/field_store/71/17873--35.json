But his counterpoint, his  fugues--to play them well when the principal theme is sometimes in the  outer voices, sometimes in the inner voices, or moving from one to the  other--is supremely difficult! In the last sonatas there is a larger  number of small movements--- but this does not make them any easier to  play.    \"I have also edited the Beethoven sonatas together with Rudolph Ganz. He  worked at the piano parts in New York, while I studied and revised the  violin parts in Petrograd and Norway, where I spent my summers during  the war. There was not so much to do,\" said Professor Auer modestly, \"a  little fingering, some bowing indications and not much else. No reviser  needs to put any indications for _nuance_ and shading in Beethoven. He  was quite able to attend to all that himself. There is no composer who  shows such refinement of _nuance_. You need only to take his quartets  or these same sonatas to convince yourself of the fact. In my Brahms  revisions I have supplied really needed fingerings, bowings, and other  indications! Important compositions on which I am now at work include  Ernst's fine Concerto, Op. 23, the Mozart violin concertos, and  Tartini's _Trille du diable_, with a special cadenza for my pupil,  Toscha Seidel.                                AS REGARDS \"PRODIGIES\"    \"Prodigies?\" said Professor Auer. \"The word 'prodigy' when applied to  some youthful artist is always used with an accent of reproach. Public  and critics are inclined to regard them with suspicion. Why? After all,  the important thing is not their youth, but their artistry. Examine the  history of music--you will discover that any number of great masters,  great in the maturity of their genius, were great in its infancy as  well. There are Mozart, Beethoven, Liszt, Rubinstein, d'Albert, Hofmann,  Scriabine, Wieniawski--they were all 'infant prodigies,' and certainly  not in any objectionable sense. Not that I wish to claim that every  _prodigy_ necessarily becomes a great master. That does not always  follow. But I believe that a musical prodigy, instead of being regarded  with suspicion, has a right to be looked upon as a striking example of a  pronounced natural predisposition for musical art. Of course, full  mental development of artistic power must come as a result of the  maturing processes of life itself. But I firmly believe that every  prodigy represents a valuable musical phenomenon, one deserving of the  keenest interest and encouragement. It does not seem right to me that  when the art of the prodigy is incontestably great, that the mere fact  of his youth should serve as an excuse to look upon him with prejudice,  and even with a certain degree of distrust.\"                                             III                                      EDDY BROWN                             HUBAY AND AUER: TECHNIC:                             HINTS TO THE STUDENT      Notwithstanding the fact that Eddy Brown was born in Chicago, Ill., and  that he is so great a favorite with concert audiences in the land of his  birth, the gifted violinist hesitates to qualify himself as a strictly  \"American\" violinist. As he expresses it: \"Musically I was altogether  educated in Europe--I never studied here, because I left this country at  the age of seven, and only returned a few years ago. So I would not like  to be placed in the position of claiming anything under false pretenses!                          HUBAY AND AUER: SOME COMPARISONS    \"With whom did I study? With two famous masters; by a strange  coincidence both Hungarians. First with Jenoe Hubay, at the National  Academy of Music in Budapest, later with Leopold Auer in Petrograd.  Hubay had been a pupil of Vieuxtemps in Brussels, and is a justly  celebrated teacher, very thorough and painstaking in explaining to his  pupils how to do things; but the great difference between Hubay and Auer  is that while Hubay tells a student how to do things, Auer, a  temperamental teacher, literally drags out of him whatever there is in  him, awakening latent powers he never knew he possessed. Hubay is a  splendid builder of virtuosity, and has a fine sense for phrasing. For a  year and a half I worked at nothing but studies with him, giving special  attention to technic. He did not believe in giving too much time to left  hand development, when without adequate bow technic finger facility is  useless. Here he was in accord with Auer, in fact with every teacher  seriously deserving of the name. Hubay was a first-class pedagog, and  under his instruction one could not help becoming a well-balanced and  musicianly player. But there is a higher ideal in violin playing than  mere correctness, and Auer is an inspiring teacher. Hubay has written  some admirable studies, notably twelve studies for the right hand,  though he never stressed technic too greatly. On the other hand, Auer's  most notable contributions to violin literature are his revisions of  such works as the Bach sonatas, the Tschaikovsky Concerto, etc. In a way  it points the difference in their mental attitude: Hubay more concerned  with the technical educational means, one which cannot be overlooked;  Auer more interested in the interpretative, artistic educational end,  which has always claimed his attention. Hubay personally was a _grand  seigneur_, a multi-millionaire, and married to an Hungarian countess. He  had a fine ear for phrasing, could improvise most interesting violin  accompaniments to whatever his pupils played, and beside Rode, Kreutzer  and Fiorillo I studied the concertos and other repertory works with him.  Then there were the conservatory lessons! Attendance at a European  conservatory is very broadening musically. Not only does the individual  violin pupil, for example, profit by listening to his colleagues play in  class: he also studies theory, musical history, the piano, _ensemble_  playing, chamber-music and orchestra. I was concertmaster of the  conservatory orchestra while studying with Hubay. There should be a  national conservatory of music in this country; music in general would  advance more rapidly. And it would help teach American students to  approach the art of violin playing from the right point of view. As it  is, too many want to study abroad under some renowned teacher not,  primarily, with the idea of becoming great artists; but in the hope of  drawing great future commercial dividends from an initial financial  investment. In Art the financial should always be a secondary  consideration.    \"It stands to reason that no matter how great a student's gifts may be,  he can profit by study with a great teacher. This, I think, applies to  all. After I had already appeared in concert at Albert Hall, London, in  1909, where I played the Beethoven Concerto with orchestra, I decided to  study with Auer. When I first came to him he wanted to know why I did  so, and after hearing me play, told me that I did not need any lessons  from him. But I knew that there was a certain 'something' which I wished  to add to my violinistic make-up, and instinctively felt that he alone  could give me what I wanted. I soon found that in many essentials his  ideas coincided with those of Hubay. But I also discovered that Auer  made me develop my individuality unconsciously, placing no undue  restrictions whatsoever upon my manner of expression, barring, of  course, unmusicianly tendencies. When he has a really talented pupil the  Professor gives him of his best. I never gave a thought to technic while  I studied with him--the great things were a singing tone, bowing,  interpretation! I studied Brahms and Beethoven, and though Hubay always  finished with the Bach sonatas, I studied them again carefully with  Auer.                           TECHNIC: SOME HINTS TO THE STUDENT    \"At the bottom of all technic lies the scale. And scale practice is the  ladder by means of which all must climb to higher proficiency. Scales,  in single tones and intervals, thirds, sixths, octaves, tenths, with the  incidental changes of position, are the foundation of technic. They  should be practiced slowly, always with the development of tone in mind,  and not too long a time at any one session. No one can lay claim to a  perfected technic who has not mastered the scale. Better a good tone,  even though a hundred mistakes be made in producing it, than a tone that  is poor, thin and without quality. I find the Singer _Fingeruebungen_ are  excellent for muscular development in scale work, for imparting the  great strength which is necessary for the fingers to have; and the  Kreutzer _etudes_ are indispensable. To secure an absolute _legato_  tone, a true singing tone on the violin, one should play scales with a  perfectly well sustained and steady bow, in whole notes, slowly and  _mezzo-forte_, taking care that each note is clear and pure, and that  its volume does not vary during the stroke. The quality of tone must be  equalized, and each whole note should be 'sung' with a single bowing.  The change from up-bow to down-bow and _vice versa_ should be made  without a break, exclusively through skillful manipulation of the wrist.  To accomplish this unbroken change of bow one should cultivate a loose  wrist, and do special work at the extreme ends, nut and tip.    \"The _vibrato_ is a great tone beautifier. Too rapid or too slow a  _vibrato_ defeats the object desired. There is a happy medium of  _tempo_, rather faster than slower, which gives the best results. Carl  Flesch has some interesting theories about vibration which are worth  investigating. A slow and a moderately rapid _vibrato, from the wrist_,  is best for practice, and the underlying idea while working must be  tone, and not fingerwork.    _Staccato_ is one of the less important branches of bow technic. There  is a knack in doing it, and it is purely pyrotechnical. _Staccato_  passages in quantity are only to be found in solos of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15536"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 20, No. 579, (#4)"],[1,"had  beheld him in his march from the pier; the fishing boat had put to  sea before any one thought of making inquiry as to the freight it  had delivered, but every one agreed that there was something of an  extraordinary character about the said freight. Ever and anon the  parlour door opened, and a lusty ring of the hand-bell summoned the  hostess into that now mysterious room: and the volley of questions which  assailed her on her return were enough to overturn the very moderate  stock of patience which she possessed, had it been centupled. She  declared that \"the jintleman was like other jintlemen, and barring that  he seemed the b'y for the brandy,\" she saw nothing amiss in him. In the  midst of this excitement in walked the officer commanding the preventive  service of the district. He was soon closeted in the _sanctum_,  and after a due discussion of the singular proceedings of the stranger,  on the part of each member of the Lanport smoking club, the worthy  lieutenant declared \"it was not only d----d odd, but very suspicious;\"  and that he would beard the foe who had so unceremoniously taken  possession of their own proper apartment, face to face, even though  he should turn out to be Beelzebub, in _propria persona_. This  determination was received with a vast and simultaneous puff of  exultation from every pipe in the room, so that the cloud was for a  short space so great as completely to envelope the ample proportions  of Mrs. Judy Teague, who had been an unnoticed witness of this bold  proposal. The lieutenant was striding onwards in full career towards the  parlour, which lay at the opposite side of the intervening kitchen, when  he somewhat roughly encountered the fair form of Mrs. Teague, which was  extended halfway through the doorcase with a view to prevent his egress.    \"Och! murder, Lafetennant ----, and is this the way you'd be sarving a  lone woman, and she a widow these twelve year agon, since Michael  Tague's (Heaven rest his sowl!) been laid aneath the turf!\"    The lieutenant apologized for the rather unceremonious way in which he  had run foul of Mrs. Teague.    \"Och! Lafetennant,\" she responded, \"its not that _agra_! (here she  gave a twinge) that Judy Tague would ever spake of from the like of  you--but its against your goin' and insulting the jintl'm in the parlour  that I was spaking of--and a _rale_ jintl'm he is, I'll be bail.\"    But it was all of no avail. After holding forth for several minutes, now  at the top of her voice, now in a beseeching whine--the lieutenant again  got under weigh, and soon reached the parlour door; which after giving  a slight tap, he entered fully prepared to take its inmate by storm.  But, lo! he had vanished! It appeared impossible that any portion of the  previous conversation could have been wafted to his ears, but certain it  was, that in place of a living occupant of flesh and blood, nothing but  the wavering shadow of an ancient high-backed chair near the fire--which  cast a faint and uncertain light through the apartment--met the eyes  of the angry lieutenant. A heavy step overhead announced that he had  just retired to his sleeping-room. Thus was the now greatly increased  curiosity of the smoking club doomed to receive an unexpected check. The  stranger was evidently no ordinary person--the conversation gradually  sank away--and more than one individual of the company started in the  course of the evening as the wind now wailed with a strange unearthly  sound up the silent street, and now blew in violent gusts which made the  old house creak and groan to its very foundations. Our gallant friend,  the lieutenant, was perhaps the only individual absolutely unmoved in  the party; and his proposal to retake possession of the parlour met with  a general negative. Nettled at this, he declared that another sun should  not go down over his head, without obtaining some satisfactory account  of this mysterious visitant.    The third day came, and with it a partial change in the conduct of the  stranger. He appeared to have in some measure shaken off his indolence,  and sallied forth betimes in the morning, apparently to examine the  beauties of the coast, towards the rocky wilds of which he was seen to  wend his way. About noon he again returned to the Mermaid. This conduct  partially disarmed the suspicion which had been excited; however it was  agreed that though nothing had hitherto occurred which could authorize  any direct interference with his movements, yet that a watch should be  kept over them for the present.    The afternoon threatened to turn out stormy. Vast masses of clouds were  continually driven across the sky: and the increasing agitation and deep  furrows of the ocean foretold a night fraught with peril and disaster  to the seaman. Drear December seemed about to assume his wildest garb.  This day of the week always brought the county paper. A solitary copy  of this journal was taken by Mrs. Teague, and it formed the sole channel  (alas! for the march of intellect,) by which the smoking club and other  worthies of Lanport were enlightened on the sayings and doings of the  great world. It must not be inferred from this that the demon of  politics was unknown in this retired spot; on the contrary, the arrival  of the ---- Journal, was looked for with the utmost impatience from week  to week; and as long as its tattered folio hung together, its contents  formed a never ending subject of conversation. On the day of its  arrival, therefore, the \"club\" invariably met many hours before their  wonted time, to discuss politics and pigtail, revolutions and small  beer.    This circumstance, and the state of the weather, had drawn a numerous  party around the hearth at the Mermaid. The delay which took place  in the arrival of the newspaper seemed unusual; the \"spokesman\" had  cleared his throat, the pipes had long been lit, but still it was not  forthcoming. Mrs. Teague at last announced that it was engaged by the  \"jintleman in the parlour.\" The patience of the party lasted half an  hour longer, when the clamorous calls for news dictated the step of  sending a message to the stranger. It met with an ungracious reception.  At this moment some one came in with the intelligence that a suspicious  looking craft was hovering off the coast, and that the lieutenant (whose  absence was thus accounted for) was about to put off in his galley to  bring her to and overhaul her.    A second and a third message to the parlour having met with the same  success as the first, the ire of all began to rise, and after a  clamorous discussion it was at last resolved, (it was now broad  daylight,) that they should go in a body and storm the enemy's quarters.  The room was situated at the other end of the house, and thither they  proceeded, after a few preliminary difficulties had been arranged as to  who should first lead the way. But if the lieutenant had been astonished  at the disappearance of the stranger the preceding night, much greater  was the surprise evinced on the present occasion on finding the room  again tenantless. It had evidently only just been vacated; but what  created the greatest sensation was the discovery of the smoking remains  of the ---- Journal, on the hood of the fireplace! Every one crowded  around, and presently intelligence was brought that the stranger,  carrying his enormous carpet bag had been seen walking at a great speed  towards Shorne Cove, a retired little spot within a short distance of  the harbour. As is often the case on such occasions, several minutes  elapsed before any plan was determined upon, but some one at last wisely  suggested that if he was to be pursued, no time ought to be lost. The  appearance of the strange vessel on the coast, and the day's occurrence,  were connected together, as they hurried onwards in the pursuit; but  when they arrived at the seashore, the mysterious man and his carpet bag  were no longer visible, unless a large boat which was pulling out to sea  as fast as wind and tide would permit, gave a clue to his invisibility.  Every eye was now cast out for the strange sail.    About a mile from the pier-head, a large lugger under a press of canvass  was seen coming down the wind, with the galley in close pursuit. From  the freshness of the wind and the quantity of sail she was able to  carry, it was evident that the king's boat had little chance with her.  As the chase came careering along, dropping the galley rapidly astern,  the interest hinged on the apparent connexion between her and the boat  which had just left Shorne Cove with its unknown freight. From their  relative situations it was evident she must bring to for a short space  if she intended to pick up the fugitive; and this delay might possibly  enable the galley to draw her. For a few minutes the scene was one of  exciting interest. The lugger broached to as had been anticipated, and  she had scarcely shipped the strange boat's crew, when the galley  pitching bows under was close in her wake. But it was too late. The  lugger had no sooner paid off, so as to get the wind again abaft the  beam, than she rapidly got way on her, and the wind continuing to  freshen, in half an hour she was all but hull down.    The night passed not over the heads of the good folks of Lanport,  without numberless recriminations on the stupidity which had been  displayed in not arresting the stranger before it was too late; and  the ferment was not lessened on the arrival of another copy of the  ---- Journal, which contained a paragraph headed with the glittering  words, \"ONE THOUSAND POUNDS REWARD.\"    VYVYAN.           *       *       *       *       *          Spirit of Discovery.           *       *       *       *       *    THE ISLAND OF ROTUMA.[10]          \"A new Cythera emerges from the bosom of the enchanted wave.
