Billy  Mink and Jerry Muskrat came along, and as soon as they saw Grandfather  Frog, they began to laugh, too. They just laughed and laughed and  laughed until the tears came. They rolled over and over on the bank and  kicked their heels from sheer enjoyment. It was the funniest thing they  had seen for a long, long time.    \"Did you ever see such greed?\" gasped Billy Mink.    \"Why don't you pull it out and start over again?\" shouted Little Joe  Otter.    Now this is just what Grandfather Frog was trying to do. At least, he  was trying to pull the fish out. He hadn't the least desire in the world  to try swallowing it again. In fact, he felt just then as if he never,  never wanted to see another fish so long as he lived. But Grandfather  Frog's hands are not made for grasping slippery things, and the tail of  a fish is very slippery indeed. He tried first with one hand, then with  the other, and at last with both. It was of no use at all. He just  couldn't budge that fish. He couldn't cough it up, because it had gone  too far down for that. The more he clawed at that waving tail with his  hands, the funnier he looked, and the harder Little Joe Otter and Billy  Mink and Jerry Muskrat laughed. They made such a noise that Spotty the  Turtle, who had been taking a sun-bath on the end of an old log, slipped  into the water and started to see what it was all about.    Now Spotty the Turtle is very, very slow on land, but he is a good  swimmer. He hurried now because he didn't want to miss the fun. At first  he didn't see Grandfather Frog.    \"What's the joke?\" he asked.    Little Joe Otter simply pointed to Grandfather Frog. Little Joe had  laughed so much that he couldn't even speak. Spotty looked over to the  big green lily-pad and started to laugh too. Then he saw great tears  rolling down from Grandfather Frog's eyes and heard little choky sounds.  He stopped laughing and started for Grandfather Frog as fast as he could  swim. He climbed right up on the big green lily-pad, and reaching out,  grabbed the end of the fish tail in his beak-like mouth. Then Spotty  the Turtle settled back and pulled, and Grandfather Frog settled back  and pulled. Splash! Grandfather Frog had fallen backward into the  Smiling Pool on one side of the big green lily-pad. Splash! Spotty the  Turtle had fallen backward into the Smiling Pool on the opposite side of  the big green lily-pad. And the fish which had caused all the trouble  lay floating on the water.    \"Thank you! Thank you!\" gasped Grandfather Frog, as he feebly crawled  back on the lily-pad. \"A minute more, and I would have choked to death.\"    \"Don't mention it,\" replied Spotty the Turtle.    \"I never, never will,\" promised Grandfather Frog.          IX    OLD MR. TOAD VISITS GRANDFATHER FROG      Grandfather Frog and old Mr. Toad are cousins. Of course you know that  without being told. Everybody does. But not everybody knows that they  were born in the same place. They were. Yes, Sir, they were. They were  born in the Smiling Pool. Both had long tails and for a while no legs,  and they played and swam together without ever going on shore. In fact,  when they were babies, they couldn't live out of the water. And people  who saw them didn't know the difference between them and called them by  the same names--tadpoles or pollywogs. But when they grew old enough to  have legs and get along without tails, they parted company.    You see, it was this way: Grandfather Frog (of course he wasn't  grandfather then) loved the Smiling Pool so well that he couldn't think  of leaving it. He heard all about the Great World and what a wonderful  place it was, but he couldn't and wouldn't believe that there could be  any nicer place than the Smiling Pool, and so he made up his mind that  he would live there always.    But Mr. Toad could hardly wait to get rid of his tail before turning his  back on the Smiling Pool and starting out to see the Great World.  Nothing that Grandfather Frog could say would stop him, and away Mr.  Toad went, when he was so small that he could hide under a clover leaf.  Grandfather Frog didn't expect ever to see him again. But he did,  though it wasn't for a long, long time. And when he did come back, he  had grown so that Grandfather Frog hardly knew him at first. And right  then and there began a dispute which they have kept up ever since:  whether it was best to go out into the Great World or remain in the home  of childhood. Each was sure that what he had done was best, and each is  sure of it to this day.    So whenever old Mr. Toad visits Grandfather Frog, as he does every once  in a while, they are sure to argue and argue on this same old subject.  It was so on the day that Grandfather Frog had so nearly choked to  death. Old Mr. Toad had heard about it from one of the Merry Little  Breezes of Old Mother West Wind and right away had started for the  Smiling Pool to pay his respects to Grandfather Frog, and to tell him  how glad he was that Spotty the Turtle had come along just in time to  pull the fish out of Grandfather Frog's throat.    Now all day long Grandfather Frog had had to listen to unpleasant  remarks about his greediness. It was such a splendid chance to tease him  that everybody around the Smiling Pool took advantage of it. Grandfather  Frog took it good-naturedly at first, but after a while it made him  cross, and by the time his cousin, old Mr. Toad, arrived, he was sulky  and just grunted when Mr. Toad told him how glad he was to find  Grandfather Frog quite recovered.    Old Mr. Toad pretended not to notice how out of sorts Grandfather Frog  was but kept right on talking.    \"If you had been out in the Great World as much as I have been, you  would have known that Little Joe Otter wasn't giving you that fish for  nothing,\" said he.    Grandfather Frog swelled right out with anger. \"Chugarum!\" he exclaimed  in his deepest, gruffest voice. \"Chugarum! Go back to your Great World  and learn to mind your own affairs, Mr. Toad.\"    Right away old Mr. Toad began to swell with anger too. For a whole  minute he glared at Grandfather Frog, so indignant he couldn't find his  tongue. When he did find it, he said some very unpleasant things, and  right away they began to dispute.    \"What good are you to anybody but yourself, never seeing anything of the  Great World and not knowing anything about what is going on or what  other people are doing?\" asked old Mr. Toad.    \"I'm minding my own affairs and not meddling with things that don't  concern me, as seems to be the way out in the Great World you are so  fond of talking about,\" retorted Grandfather Frog. \"Wise people know  enough to be content with what they have. You've been out in the Great  World ever since you could hop, and what good has it done you? Tell me  that! You haven't even a decent suit of clothes to your back.\"  Grandfather Frog patted his white and yellow waistcoat as he spoke and  looked admiringly at the reflection of his handsome green coat in the  Smiling Pool.    Old Mr. Toad's eyes snapped, for you know his suit is very plain and  rough.    \"People who do honest work for their living have no time to sit about in  fine clothes admiring themselves,\" he replied sharply. \"I've learned  this much out in the Great World, that lazy people come to no good end,  and I know enough not to choke myself to death.\"    Grandfather Frog almost choked again, he was so angry. You see old Mr.  Toad's remarks were very personal, and nobody likes personal remarks  when they are unpleasant, especially if they happen to be true.  Grandfather Frog was trying his best to think of something sharp to say  in reply, when Mr. Redwing, sitting in the top of the big hickory-tree,  shouted: \"Here comes Farmer Brown's boy!\"    Grandfather Frog forgot his anger and began to look anxious. He moved  about uneasily on his big green lily-pad and got ready to dive into the  Smiling Pool, for he was afraid that Farmer Brown's boy had a pocketful  of stones as he usually did have when he came over to the Smiling Pool.    Old Mr. Toad didn't look troubled the least bit. He didn't even look  around for a hiding-place. He just sat still and grinned.    \"You'd better watch out, or you'll never visit the Smiling Pool again,\"  called Grandfather Frog.    \"Oh,\" replied old Mr. Toad, \"I'm not afraid. Farmer Brown's boy is a  friend of mine. I help him in his garden. How to make friends is one of  the things the Great World has taught me.\"    \"Chugarum!\" said Grandfather Frog. \"I'd have you to know that--\"    But what it was that he was to know old Mr. Toad never found out, for  just then Grandfather Frog caught sight of Farmer Brown's boy and  without waiting even to say good-by he dived into the Smiling Pool.          X    GRANDFATHER FROG STARTS OUT TO SEE THE GREAT WORLD      Grandfather Frog looked very solemn as he sat on his big green lily-pad  in the Smiling Pool. He looked very much as if he had something on his  mind. A foolish green fly actually brushed Grandfather Frog's nose and  he didn't even notice it. The fact is he did have something on his mind.  It had been there ever since his cousin, old Mr. Toad, had called the  day before and they had quarreled as usual over the question whether it  was best never to leave home or to go out into the Great World.    Right in the midst of their quarrel along had come Farmer Brown's boy.  Now Grandfather Frog is afraid of Farmer Brown's boy, so when he  appeared, Grandfather Frog stopped arguing with old Mr. Toad and with a  great splash dived into the Smiling Pool and hid under a lily-pad. There  he stayed and watched his cousin, old Mr. Toad, grinning in the most  provoking way, for he wasn't afraid of Farmer Brown's boy. In fact, he  had boasted that they were friends."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14378"],[0,"Five Years of Theosophy (#4)"],[1,"Catechism.\"  (Question 83).--G.M.  ----------    It will be seen now in connection with the doctrine of the tendency  to the renewal of action, before discussed, that the course of  self-discipline recommended as the only road to Longevity by Occultism  is not a \"visionary\" theory dealing with vague \"ideas,\" but actually a  scientifically devised system of drill.  It is a system by which each  particle of the several men composing the septenary individual receives  an impulse, and a habit of doing what is necessary for certain purposes  of its own free-will and with \"pleasure.\"  Every one must be practiced  and perfect in a thing to do it with pleasure.  This rule especially  applies to the case of the development of Man.  \"Virtue\" may be very  good in its way--it may lead to the grandest results. But to become  efficacious it has to be practiced cheerfully not with reluctance or  pain.  As a consequence of the above consideration the candidate for  Longevity at the commencement of his career must begin to eschew his  physical desires, not from any sentimental theory of right or wrong, but  for the following good reason.  As, according to a well-known and now  established scientific theory, his visible material frame is always  renewing its particles;  he will, while abstaining from the  gratification of his desires, reach the end of a certain period during  which those particles which composed the man of vice, and which were  given a bad predisposition, will have departed.  At the same time, the  disuse of such functions will tend to obstruct the entry, in place of  the old particles, of new particles having a tendency to repeat the said  acts.  And while this is the particular result as regards certain  \"vices,\" the general result of an abstention from \"gross\" acts will be  (by a modification of the well-known Darwinian law of atrophy by  non-usage) to diminish what we may call the \"relative\" density and  coherence of the outer shell (as a result of its less-used molecules);  while the diminution in the quantity of its actual constituents will he  \"made up\" (if tried by scales and weights) by the increased admission of  more ethereal particles.    What physical desires are to be abandoned and in what order? First and  foremost, he must give up alcohol in all forms;  for while it supplies  no nourishment, nor any direct pleasure (beyond such sweetness or  fragrance as may be gained in the taste of wine, &c., to which alcohol,  in itself, is non-essential) to even the grossest elements of the  \"physical\" frame, it induces a violence of action, a rush so to speak,  of life, the stress of which can only be sustained by very dull, gross,  and dense elements, and which, by the operation of the well-known law of  Re-action (in commercial phrase, \"supply and demand\") tends to summon  them from the surrounding universe, and therefore directly counteracts  the object we have in view.    Next comes meat-eating, and for the very same reason, in a minor degree.  It increases the rapidity of life, the energy of action, the violence of  passions.  It may be good for a hero who has to fight and die, but not  for a would-be sage who has to exist and....    Next in order come the sexual desires;  for these, in addition to the  great diversion of energy (vital force) into other channels, in many  different ways, beyond the primary one (as, for instance, the waste of  energy in expectation, jealousy, &c.), are direct attractions to a  certain gross quality of the original matter of the Universe, simply  because the most pleasurable physical sensations are only possible at  that stage of density.  Alongside with and extending beyond all these  and other gratifications of the senses (which include not only those  things usually known as \"vicious,\" but all those which, though  ordinarily regarded as \"innocent,\" have yet the disqualification of  ministering to the pleasures of the body--the most harmless to others  and the least \"gross\" being the criterion for those to be last abandoned  in each case)--must be carried on the moral purification.    Nor must it be imagined that \"austerities\" as commonly understood can,  in the majority of cases, avail much to hasten the \"etherealizing\"  process.  That is the rock on which many of the Eastern esoteric sects  have foundered, and the reason why they have degenerated into degrading  superstitions.  The Western monks and the Eastern Yogees, who think they  will reach the apex of powers by concentrating their thought on their  navel, or by standing on one leg, are practicing exercises which serve  no other purpose than to strengthen the willpower, which is sometimes  applied to the basest purposes.  These are examples of this one-sided  and dwarf development.  It is no use to fast as long as you require  food.  The ceasing of desire for food without impairment of health is  the sign which indicates that it should be taken in lesser and ever  decreasing quantities until the extreme limit compatible with life is  reached.  A stage will be finally attained where only water will be  required.    Nor is it of any use for this particular purpose of longevity to abstain  from immorality so long as you are craving for it in your heart;  and so  on with all other unsatisfied inward cravings.  To get rid of the inward  desire is the essential thing, and to mimic the real thing without it is  barefaced hypocrisy and useless slavery.    So it must be with the moral purification of the heart.  The \"basest\"  inclinations must go first--then the others.  First avarice, then fear,  then envy, worldly pride, uncharitableness, hatred;  last of all  ambition and curiosity must be abandoned successively.  The  strengthening of the more ethereal and so-called \"spiritual\" parts of  the man must go on at the same time. Reasoning from the known to the  unknown, meditation must be practiced and encouraged.  Meditation is the  inexpressible yearning of the inner Man to \"go out towards the  infinite,\" which in the olden time was the real meaning of adoration,  but which has now no synonym in the European languages, because the  thing no longer exists in the West, and its name has been vulgarized to  the make-believe shams known as prayer, glorification, and repentance.  Through all stages of training the equilibrium of the consciousness--the  assurance that all must be right in the Kosmos, and therefore with you a  portion of it--must be retained. The process of life must not be hurried  but retarded, if possible;  to do otherwise may do good to others--  perhaps even to yourself in other spheres, but it will hasten your  dissolution in this.    Nor must the externals be neglected in this first stage. Remember that  an adept, though \"existing\" so as to convey to ordinary minds the idea  of his being immortal, is not also invulnerable to agencies from  without.  The training to prolong life does not, in itself, secure one  from accidents.  As far as any physical preparation goes, the sword may  still cut, the disease enter, the poison disarrange.  This case is very  clearly and beautifully put in \"Zanoni,\" and it is correctly put and  must be so, unless all \"adeptism\" is a baseless lie.  The adept may be  more secure from ordinary dangers than the common mortal, but he is so  by virtue of the superior knowledge, calmness, coolness and penetration  which his lengthened existence and its necessary concomitants have  enabled him to acquire;  not by virtue of any preservative power in the  process itself.  He is secure as a man armed with a rifle is more secure  than a naked baboon;  not secure in the sense in which the deva (god)  was supposed to be securer than a man.    If this is so in the case of the high adept, how much more necessary is  it that the neophyte should be not only protected but that he himself  should use all possible means to ensure for himself the necessary  duration of life to complete the process of mastering the phenomena we  call death!  It may be said, why do not the higher adepts protect him?  Perhaps they do to some extent, but the child must learn to walk alone;  to make him independent of his own efforts in respect to safety, would  be destroying one element necessary to his development--the sense of  responsibility.  What courage or conduct would be called for in a man  sent to fight when armed with irresistible weapons and clothed in  impenetrable armour?  Hence the neophyte should endeavour, as far as  possible, to fulfill every true canon of sanitary law as laid down by  modern scientists.  Pure air, pure water, pure food, gentle exercise,  regular hours, pleasant occupations and surroundings, are all, if not  indispensable, at least serviceable to his progress.  It is to secure  these, at least as much as silence and solitude, that the Gods, Sages,  Occultists of all ages have retired as much as possible to the quiet of  the country, the cool cave, the depths of the forest, the expanse of the  desert, or the heights of the mountains.  Is it not suggestive that the  Gods have always loved the \"high places\";  and that in the present day  the highest section of the Occult Brotherhood on earth inhabits the  highest mountain plateaux of the earth?*    ---------  * The stern prohibition to the Jews to serve \"their gods upon the high  mountains and upon the hills\" is traced back to the unwillingness of  their ancient elders to allow people in most cases unfit for adeptship  to choose a life of celibacy and asceticism, or in other words, to  pursue adeptship.  This prohibition had an esoteric meaning before it  became the prohibition, incomprehensible in its dead-letter sense:  for  it is not India alone whose sons accorded divine honours to the Wise  Ones, but all nations regarded their adepts and initiates as divine.--  G.M.  ---------    Nor must the beginner disdain the assistance of medicine and good  medical regimen.  He is still an ordinary mortal, and he requires the  aid of"]]]
