Their arms were repeatedly carried far into  the heart of: the Carlovingian empire, and were victorious under the  walls of Maestricht and Paris. At length one of the feeble heirs of  Charlemagne ceded to the strangers a fertile province, watered by  a noble river, and contiguous to the sea which was their favourite  element. In that province they founded a mighty state, which gradually  extended its influence over the neighbouring principalities of Britanny  and Maine. Without laying aside that dauntless valour which had been the  terror of every land from the Elbe to the Pyrenees, the Normans rapidly  acquired all, and more than all, the knowledge and refinement which they  found in the country where they settled. Their courage secured their  territory against foreign invasion. They established internal order,  such as had long been unknown in the Frank empire. They embraced  Christianity; and with Christianity they learned a great part of what  the clergy had to teach. They abandoned their native speech, and adopted  the French tongue, in which the Latin was the predominant element. They  speedily raised their new language to a dignity and importance which it  had never before possessed. They found it a barbarous jargon; they fixed  it in writing; and they employed it in legislation, in poetry, and in  romance. They renounced that brutal intemperance to which all the other  branches of the great German family were too much inclined. The polite  luxury of the Norman presented a striking contrast to the coarse  voracity and drunkenness of his Saxon and Danish neighbours. He loved  to display his magnificence, not in huge piles of food and hogsheads of  strong drink, but in large and stately edifices, rich armour, gallant  horses, choice falcons, well ordered tournaments, banquets delicate  rather than abundant, and wines remarkable rather for their exquisite  flavour than for their intoxicating power. That chivalrous spirit, which  has exercised so powerful an influence on the politics, morals, and  manners of all the European nations, was found in the highest exaltation  among the Norman nobles. Those nobles were distinguished by their  graceful bearing and insinuating address. They were distinguished also  by their skill in negotiation, and by a natural eloquence which they  assiduously cultivated. It was the boast of one of their historians that  the Norman gentlemen were orators from the cradle. But their chief  fame was derived from their military exploits. Every country, from  the Atlantic Ocean to the Dead Sea, witnessed the prodigies of their  discipline and valour. One Norman knight, at the head of a handful of  warriors, scattered the Celts of Connaught. Another founded the monarchy  of the Two Sicilies, and saw the emperors both of the East and of the  West fly before his arms. A third, the Ulysses of the first crusade, was  invested by his fellow soldiers with the sovereignty of Antioch; and  a fourth, the Tancred whose name lives in the great poem of Tasso, was  celebrated through Christendom as the bravest and most generous of the  deliverers of the Holy Sepulchre.    The vicinity of so remarkable a people early began to produce an effect  on the public mind of England. Before the Conquest, English princes  received their education in Normandy. English sees and English estates  were bestowed on Normans. The French of Normandy was familiarly spoken  in the palace of Westminster. The court of Rouen seems to have been  to the court of Edward the Confessor what the court of Versailles long  afterwards was to the court of Charles the Second.    The battle of Hastings, and the events which followed it, not only  placed a Duke of Normandy on the English throne, but gave up the whole  population of England to the tyranny of the Norman race. The subjugation  of a nation by a nation has seldom, even in Asia, been more complete.  The country was portioned out among the captains of the invaders.  Strong military institutions, closely connected with the institution of  property, enabled the foreign conquerors to oppress the children of the  soil. A cruel penal code, cruelly enforced, guarded the privileges,  and even the sports, of the alien tyrants. Yet the subject race, though  beaten down and trodden underfoot, still made its sting felt. Some bold  men, the favourite heroes of our oldest ballads, betook themselves to  the woods, and there, in defiance of curfew laws and forest laws, waged  a predatory war against their oppressors. Assassination was an event of  daily occurrence. Many Normans suddenly disappeared leaving no trace.  The corpses of many were found bearing the marks of violence. Death by  torture was denounced against the murderers, and strict search was  made for them, but generally in vain; for the whole nation was in a  conspiracy to screen them. It was at length thought necessary to lay  a heavy fine on every Hundred in which a person of French extraction  should be found slain; and this regulation was followed up by another  regulation, providing that every person who was found slain should be  supposed to be a Frenchman, unless he was proved to be a Saxon.    During the century and a half which followed the Conquest, there is, to  speak strictly, no English history. The French Kings of England  rose, indeed, to an eminence which was the wonder and dread of all  neighbouring nations. They conquered Ireland. They received the homage  of Scotland. By their valour, by their policy, by their fortunate  matrimonial alliances, they became far more popular on the Continent  than their liege lords the Kings of France. Asia, as well as Europe,  was dazzled by the power and glory of our tyrants. Arabian chroniclers  recorded with unwilling admiration the fall of Acre, the defence of  Joppa, and the victorious march to Ascalon; and Arabian mothers  long awed their infants to silence with the name of the lionhearted  Plantagenet. At one time it seemed that the line of Hugh Capet was about  to end as the Merovingian and Carlovingian lines had ended, and that a  single great monarchy would spread from the Orkneys to the Pyrenees. So  strong an association is established in most minds between the greatness  of a sovereign and the greatness of the nation which he rules, that  almost every historian of England has expatiated with a sentiment of  exultation on the power and splendour of her foreign masters, and has  lamented the decay of that power and splendour as a calamity to our  country. This is, in truth, as absurd as it would be in a Haytian negro  of our time to dwell with national pride on the greatness of Lewis the  Fourteenth, and to speak of Blenheim and Ramilies with patriotic regret  and shame. The Conqueror and his descendants to the fourth generation  were not Englishmen: most of them were born in France: they spent the  greater part of their lives in France: their ordinary speech was French:  almost every high office in their gift was filled by a Frenchman: every  acquisition which they made on the Continent estranged them more and  more from the population of our island. One of the ablest among them  indeed attempted to win the hearts of his English subjects by espousing  an English princess. But, by many of his barons, this marriage was  regarded as a marriage between a white planter and a quadroon girl would  now be regarded in Virginia. In history he is known by the honourable  surname of Beauclerc; but, in his own time, his own countrymen  called him by a Saxon nickname, in contemptuous allusion to his Saxon  connection.    Had the Plantagenets, as at one time seemed likely, succeeded in uniting  all France under their government, it is probable that England would  never have had an independent existence. Her princes, her lords, her  prelates, would have been men differing in race and language from  the artisans and the tillers of the earth. The revenues of her great  proprietors would have been spent in festivities and diversions on the  banks of the Seine. The noble language of Milton and Burke would have  remained a rustic dialect, without a literature, a fixed grammar, or a  fixed orthography, and would have been contemptuously abandoned to the  use of boors. No man of English extraction would have risen to eminence,  except by becoming in speech and habits a Frenchman.    England owes her escape from such calamities to an event which her  historians have generally represented as disastrous. Her interest was so  directly opposed to the interests of her rulers that she had no hope but  in their errors and misfortunes. The talents and even the virtues of her  first six French Kings were a curse to her. The follies and vices of the  seventh were her salvation. Had John inherited the great qualities of  his father, of Henry Beauclerc, or of the Conqueror, nay, had he even  possessed the martial courage of Stephen or of Richard, and had the King  of France at the same time been as incapable as all the other successors  of Hugh Capet had been, the House of Plantagenet must have risen to  unrivalled ascendancy in Europe. But, just at this conjuncture, France,  for the first time since the death of Charlemagne, was governed by a  prince of great firmness and ability. On the other hand England,  which, since the battle of Hastings, had been ruled generally by wise  statesmen, always by brave soldiers, fell under the dominion of a  trifler and a coward. From that moment her prospects brightened. John  was driven from Normandy. The Norman nobles were compelled to make their  election between the island and the continent. Shut up by the sea with  the people whom they had hitherto oppressed and despised, they gradually  came to regard England as their country, and the English as their  countrymen. The two races, so long hostile, soon found that they had  common interests and common enemies. Both were alike aggrieved by the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1470"],[0,"The Fall of the Moghul Empire of Hindustan (#4)"],[1,"strength, so  that, even after so many years of havoc, the outward appearance  of the Imperial residence continues to testify of its former  grandeur. How its internal and actual grandeur perished will be  seen in the following pages. The Court was often held at Agra,  where the remains of a similar palace are still to be seen. No  detailed account of this has been met with at all rivalling the  contemporary descriptions of the Red Palace of Dehli. But an  attempt has been made to represent its high and palmy state in  the General Introduction to the History of Hindustan by the  present writer.    Of the character of the races who people the wide Empire of which  Dehli was the metropolis, very varying estimates have been  formed, in the most extreme opposites of which there is still  some germ of truth. It cannot be denied that, in some of what are  termed the unprogressive virtues, they exceeded, as their sons  still exceed, most of the nations of Europe; being usually  temperate, self-controlled, patient, dignified in misfortune, and  affectionate and liberal to kinsfolk and dependents. Few things  perhaps show better the good behaviour Â— one may almost say the  good breeding Â— of the ordinary native than the sight of a crowd  of villagers going to or returning from a fair in Upper India.  The stalwart young farmers are accompanied by their wives; each  woman in her coloured wimple, with her shapely arms covered  nearly to the elbow with cheap glass armless. Every one is  smiling, showing rows of well-kept teeth, talking kindly and  gently; here a little boy leads a pony on which his white-bearded  grandfather is smilingly seated; there a baby perches, with eyes  of solemn satisfaction, on its father's shoulder. Scenes of the  immemorial East are reproduced before our modern eyes; now the  \"flight into Egypt,\" now St. John and his lamb. In hundreds and  in thousands, the orderly crowds stream on. Not a bough is broken  off a way-side tree, not a rude remark addressed to the passenger  as he threads his horse's way carefully through the everywhere  yielding ranks. So they go in the morning and so return at night.    But, on the other hand, it is not to be rashly assumed that, as  India is the Italy, so are the Indian races the Italians of Asia.  All Asiatics are unscrupulous and unforgiving. The natives of  Hindustan are peculiarly so; but they are also unsympathetic and  unobservant in a manner that is altogether their own. From the  languor induced by the climate, and from the selfishness  engendered by centuries of misgovernment, they have derived a  weakness of will, an absence of resolute energy, and an  occasional audacity of meanness, almost unintelligible in a  people so free from the fear of death. Many persons have thought  that moral weakness of this kind must be attributable to the  system of caste by which men, placed by birth in certain grooves,  are forbidden to even think of stepping out of them. But this is  not the whole explanation. Nor, indeed, are the most candid  foreign critics convinced that the system is one of unmixed evil.  The subjoined moderate and sensible estimate of the effects of  caste, upon the character and habits of the people is from the  Bishops' letter quoted above. \"In India, Caste has been the bond  of Society, defining the relations between man and man, and  though essentially at variance with all that is best and noblest  in human nature, has held vast communities together, and  established a system of order and discipline under which  Government has been administered, trade has prospered, the poor  have been maintained, and some domestic virtues have flourished.\"    Macaulay has not overstated Indian weaknesses in his Essay on  Warren Hastings, where he has occasion to describe the character  of Nand Komar, who, as a Bengali man-of-the-pen, appears to have  been a marked type of all that is most unpleasing in the Hindoo  character. The Bengalis, however, have many amiable  characteristics to show on the other side of the shield, to which  it did not suit the eloquent Essayist to draw attention. And in  going farther North many other traits, of a far nobler kind, will  be found more and more abundant. Of the Musalmans, it only  remains to add that, although mostly descended from hardier  immigrants, they have imbibed the Hindu character to an extent  that goes far to corroborate the doctrine which traces the morals  of men to the physical circumstances that surround them. The  subject will be found more fully treated in the concluding  chapter.    CHAPTER II.    A.D. 1707-19.        Greatness of Timur's DescendantsÂ—Causes of the Empire's  DeclineÂ—Character of AurangzebÂ—Progress of Disruption under his  SuccessorsÂ—Muhamadan and Hindu enemiesÂ—The Stage emptied.        For nearly two centuries the throne of the Chaghtais continued to  be filled by a succession of exceptionally able Princes. The  brave and simple-hearted Babar, the wandering Humayun, the  glorious Akbar, the easy but uncertain-tempered Jahangir, the  magnificent Shahjahan, all these rulers combined some of the best  elements of Turkish character Â— and their administration was  better than that of any other Oriental country of their date. Of  Shahjahan's government and its patronage of the arts Â— both  decorative and useful Â— we have trustworthy contemporary  descriptions. His especial taste was for architecture; and the  Mosque and Palace of Dehli, which he personally designed, even  after the havoc of two centuries, still remain the climax of the  Indo-Saracenic order, and admitted rivals to the choicest works  of Cordova and Granada.    The abilities of his son and successor ALAMGIR, known to  Europeans by his private name, AURANGZEB, rendered him the most  famous member of his famous house. Intrepid and enterprising as  he was in war, his political sagacity and statecraft were equally  unparalleled in Eastern annals. He abolished capital punishment,  understood and encouraged agriculture, founded numberless  colleges and schools, systematically constructed roads and  bridges, kept continuous diaries of all public events from his  earliest boyhood, administered justice publicly in person, and  never condoned the slightest malversation of a provincial  governor, however distant his province. Such were these emperors;  great, if not exactly what we should call good, to a degree rare  indeed amongst hereditary rulers.    The fact of this uncommon succession of high qualities in a race  born to the purple may be ascribed to two main considerations. In  the first place, the habit of contracting, marriages with Hindu  princesses, which the policy and the latitudinarianism of the  emperors established, was a constant source of fresh blood,  whereby the increase of family predisposition was checked. Few if  any races of men are free from some morbid taint: scrofula,  phthisis, weak nerves, or a disordered brain, are all likely to  be propagated if a person predisposed to any such ailment marries  a woman of his own stock. From this danger the Moghul princes  were long kept free. Khuram, the second son of Jahangir, who  succeeded his father under the title of Shah Jahan, had a Hindu  mother, and two Hindu grandmothers. All his sons, however, were  by a Persian consort Â— the lady of the Taj.    Secondly, the invariable fratricidal war which followed the  demise of the Crown gave rise to a natural selection (to borrow a  term from modern physical science), which eventually confirmed  the strongest in possession of the prize. However humanity may  revolt from the scenes of crime which such a system must perforce  entail, yet it cannot be doubted that the qualities necessary to  ensure success in a struggle of giants would certainly both  declare and develop themselves in the person of the victor by the  time that struggle was concluded.    It is, however, probable that both these causes aided ultimately  in the dissolution of the monarchy.    The connections which resulted from the earlier emperors' Hindu  marriages led, as the Hindus became disaffected after the  intolerant rule of Aurangzeb, to an assertion of partisanship  which gradually swelled into independence; while the wars between  the rival sons of each departing emperor gave more and more  occasion for the Hindu chiefs to take sides in arms.    Then it was that each competitor, seeking to detach the greatest  number of influential feudatories from the side of his rivals,  and to propitiate such feudatories in his own favour, cast to  each of these the prize that each most valued. And, since this  was invariably the uncontrolled dominion of the territories  confided to their charge, it was in this manner that the reckless  disputants partitioned the territories that their forefathers had  accumulated with such a vast expenditure of human happiness and  human virtue. For, even from those who had received their  titledeeds at the hands of claimants to the throne ultimately  vanquished, the concession could rarely be wrested by the  exhausted conqueror. Or, when it was, there was always at hand a  partisan to be provided for, who took the gift on the same terms  as those upon which it had been held by his predecessor.    Aurangzeb, when he had imprisoned his father and, conquered and  slain his brothers, was, on his accession, A.D. 1658, the most  powerful of all the Emperors of Hindustan, and, at the same time,  the ablest administrator that the Empire had ever known. In his  reign the house of Timur attained its zenith. The wild Pathans of  Kabul were temporarily tamed; the Shah of Persia sought his  friendship; the ancient Musalman powers of Golconda and Bijapur  were subverted, and their territories rendered subordinate to the  sway of the Empire; the hitherto indomitable Rajputs were subdued  and made subject to taxation; and, if the strength of the  Mahrattas lay gathered upon the Western Ghats like a cloud risen  from the sea, yet it was"]]]
