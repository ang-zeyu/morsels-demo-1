[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1565"],[0,"The Last Days of Pompeii (#4)"],[1,"  His retreat in Pompeii--alas! the  colors are faded now, the walls stripped of their paintings!--its main  beauty, its elaborate finish of grace and ornament, is gone; yet when  first given once more to the day, what eulogies, what wonder, did its  minute and glowing decorations create--its paintings--its mosaics!  Passionately enamoured of poetry and the drama, which recalled to  Glaucus the wit and the heroism of his race, that fairy mansion was  adorned with representations of AEschylus and Homer.  And antiquaries,  who resolve taste to a trade, have turned the patron to the professor,  and still (though the error is now acknowledged) they style in custom,  as they first named in mistake, the disburied house of the Athenian  Glaucus 'THE HOUSE OF THE DRAMATIC POET'.    Previous to our description of this house, it may be as well to convey  to the reader a general notion of the houses of Pompeii, which he will  find to resemble strongly the plans of Vitruvius; but with all those  differences in detail, of caprice and taste, which being natural to  mankind, have always puzzled antiquaries.  We shall endeavor to make  this description as clear and unpedantic as possible.    You enter then, usually, by a small entrance-passage (called  cestibulum), into a hall, sometimes with (but more frequently without)  the ornament of columns; around three sides of this hall are doors  communicating with several bedchambers (among which is the porter's),  the best of these being usually appropriated to country visitors.  At  the extremity of the hall, on either side to the right and left, if the  house is large, there are two small recesses, rather than chambers,  generally devoted to the ladies of the mansion; and in the centre of the  tessellated pavement of the hall is invariably a square, shallow  reservoir for rain water (classically termed impluvium), which was  admitted by an aperture in the roof above; the said aperture being  covered at will by an awning.  Near this impluvium, which had a peculiar  sanctity in the eyes of the ancients, were sometimes (but at Pompeii  more rarely than at Rome) placed images of the household gods--the  hospitable hearth, often mentioned by the Roman poets, and consecrated  to the Lares, was at Pompeii almost invariably formed by a movable  brazier; while in some corner, often the most ostentatious place, was  deposited a huge wooden chest, ornamented and strengthened by bands of  bronze or iron, and secured by strong hooks upon a stone pedestal so  firmly as to defy the attempts of any robber to detach it from its  position. It is supposed that this chest was the money-box, or coffer,  of the master of the house; though as no money has been found in any of  the chests discovered at Pompeii, it is probable that it was sometimes  rather designed for ornament than use.    In this hall (or atrium, to speak classically) the clients and visitors  of inferior rank were usually received.  In the houses of the more  'respectable', an atriensis, or slave peculiarly devoted to the service  of the hall, was invariably retained, and his rank among his  fellow-slaves was high and important.  The reservoir in the centre must  have been rather a dangerous ornament, but the centre of the hall was  like the grass-plot of a college, and interdicted to the passers to and  fro, who found ample space in the margin.  Right opposite the entrance,  at the other end of the hall, was an apartment (tablinum), in which the  pavement was usually adorned with rich mosaics, and the walls covered  with elaborate paintings.  Here were usually kept the records of the  family, or those of any public office that had been filled by the owner:  on one side of this saloon, if we may so call it, was often a  dining-room, or triclinium; on the other side, perhaps, what we should  now term a cabinet of gems, containing whatever curiosities were deemed  most rare and costly; and invariably a small passage for the slaves to  cross to the further parts of the house, without passing the apartments  thus mentioned.  These rooms all opened on a square or oblong colonnade,  technically termed peristyle.  If the house was small, its boundary  ceased with this colonnade; and in that case its centre, however  diminutive, was ordinarily appropriated to the purpose of a garden, and  adorned with vases of flowers, placed upon pedestals: while, under the  colonnade, to the right and left, were doors admitting to bedrooms, to a  second triclinium, or eating-room (for the ancients generally  appropriated two rooms at least to that purpose, one for summer, and one  for winter--or, perhaps, one for ordinary, the other for festive,  occasions); and if the owner affected letters, a cabinet, dignified by  the name of library--for a very small room was sufficient to contain the  few rolls of papyrus which the ancients deemed a notable collection of  books.    At the end of the peristyle was generally the kitchen.  Supposing the  house was large, it did not end with the peristyle, and the centre  thereof was not in that case a garden, but might be, perhaps, adorned  with a fountain, or basin for fish; and at its end, exactly opposite to  the tablinum, was generally another eating-room, on either side of which  were bedrooms, and, perhaps, a picture-saloon, or pinacotheca.  These  apartments communicated again with a square or oblong space, usually  adorned on three sides with a colonnade like the peristyle, and very  much resembling the peristyle, only usually longer.  This was the proper  viridarium, or garden, being commonly adorned with a fountain, or  statues, and a profusion of gay flowers: at its extreme end was the  gardener's house; on either side, beneath the colonnade, were sometimes,  if the size of the family required it, additional rooms.    At Pompeii, a second or third story was rarely of importance, being  built only above a small part of the house, and containing rooms for the  slaves; differing in this respect from the more magnificent edifices of  Rome, which generally contained the principal eating-room (or  caenaculum) on the second floor.  The apartments themselves were  ordinarily of small size; for in those delightful climes they received  any extraordinary number of visitors in the peristyle (or portico), the  hall, or the garden; and even their banquet-rooms, however elaborately  adorned and carefully selected in point of aspect, were of diminutive  proportions; for the intellectual ancients, being fond of society, not  of crowds, rarely feasted more than nine at a time, so that large  dinner-rooms were not so necessary with them as with us. But the suite  of rooms seen at once from the entrance, must have had a very imposing  effect: you beheld at once the hall richly paved and painted--the  tablinum--the graceful peristyle, and (if the house extended farther)  the opposite banquet-room and the garden, which closed the view with  some gushing fount or marble statue.    The reader will now have a tolerable notion of the Pompeian houses,  which resembled in some respects the Grecian, but mostly the Roman  fashion of domestic architecture.  In almost every house there is some  difference in detail from the rest, but the principal outline is the  same in all.  In all you find the hall, the tablinum, and the peristyle,  communicating with each other; in all you find the walls richly painted;  and all the evidence of a people fond of the refining elegancies of  life.  The purity of the taste of the Pompeians in decoration is,  however, questionable: they were fond of the gaudiest colors, of  fantastic designs; they often painted the lower half of their columns a  bright red, leaving the rest uncolored; and where the garden was small,  its wall was frequently tinted to deceive the eye as to its extent,  imitating trees, birds, temples, etc., in perspective--a meretricious  delusion which the graceful pedantry of Pliny himself adopted, with a  complacent pride in its ingenuity.    But the house of Glaucus was at once one of the smallest, and yet one of  the most adorned and finished of all the private mansions of Pompeii: it  would be a model at this day for the house of 'a single man in  Mayfair'--the envy and despair of the coelibian purchasers of buhl  and marquetry.    You enter by a long and narrow vestibule, on the floor of which is the  image of a dog in mosaic, with the well-known 'Cave canem'--or 'Beware  the dog'. On either side is a chamber of some size; for the interior  part of the house not being large enough to contain the two great  divisions of private and public apartments, these two rooms were set  apart for the reception of visitors who neither by rank nor familiarity  were entitled to admission in the penetralia of the mansion.    Advancing up the vestibule you enter an atrium, that when first  discovered was rich in paintings, which in point of expression would  scarcely disgrace a Rafaele.  You may see them now transplanted to the  Neapolitan Museum: they are still the admiration of connoisseurs--they  depict the parting of Achilles and Briseis.  Who does not acknowledge  the force, the vigour, the beauty, employed in delineating the forms and  faces of Achilles and the immortal slave!    On one side the atrium, a small staircase admitted to the apartments for  the slaves on the second floor; there also were two or three small  bedrooms, the walls of which portrayed the rape of Europa, the battle of  the Amazons, etc.    You now enter the tablinum, across which, at either end, hung rich  draperies of Tyrian purple, half withdrawn.  On the walls was depicted a  poet reading his verses to his friends; and in the pavement was inserted  a small and most exquisite mosaic, typical of the instructions given by  the director of the stage to his comedians.    You passed through this saloon and entered the peristyle; and here (as I  have said before was usually the case with the smaller houses of  Pompeii) the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15659"],[0,"The Beacon Second Reader (#4)"],[1,"take long, for they acted as if they had been hungry for a  month.    When the four had eaten, they put out the light, and each went to sleep  in the spot which he liked the best.    The donkey lay down in the yard.    The dog lay behind the door.    The cat curled himself in front of the fire, while the cock flew up on a  high beam.    They soon fell fast asleep.      THE FOUR FRIENDS--III    When all was still and the light was out, the robber chief sent one of  his bravest men back to the house.    The man found the house quiet, so he went into the kitchen to strike a  light.    Seeing the great fiery eyes of the cat, he thought they were live coals  and held a match to them.    Puss was so angry that he flew up and scratched the man's face. This  gave the robber a great fright, and he ran for the door.    As he went by, the dog sprang up and bit him in the leg.    In the yard the robber ran into the donkey, who gave him a great kick.    The cock on the beam was waked by the! noise, and cried,  \"Cock-a-doodle-doo!\"    The man ran as fast as his legs could carry him back to the robber  chief.    \"Ah!\" he cried. \"In that house is a wicked witch, who flew at me and  scratched my face with her long nails.    By the door stood a man with a knife, who cut me in the leg.    [Illustration]    Out in the yard lay a great black giant, who struck me a blow with his  wooden club.    Upon the roof sat the judge, who cried, 'What did he do? What did he  do?'    When I heard this I ran off as fast as I could.\"    The robbers never went near the house again.    The four friends liked the place so well that they would not leave it,  and so far as I know, they are there to this day.    WILLIAM AND JACOB GRIMM              LITTLE BIRDIE        What does little birdie say,      In her nest at peep of day?      Let me fly, says little birdie,      Mother, let me fly away.      Birdie, rest a little longer,      Till the little wings are stronger.      So she rests a little longer,      Then she flies away.        What does little baby say,      In her bed at peep of day?      Baby says, like little birdie,      Let me rise and fly away.      Baby, sleep a little longer,      Till the little limbs are stronger.      If she sleeps a little longer,      Baby too shall fly away.        ALFRED TENNYSON          [Illustration]    MOTHER FROST--I    broad  daughters  through  heart      At the edge of a wood there was a great, clear, bubbling spring of cold  water.    Near this spring lived a widow and her two daughters.    One of them was very beautiful and a great help about the house, while  the other was ugly and idle.    The mother loved only the ugly one, for she was her own child.    She cared so little for the other daughter that she made her do all the  hard work.    Every day the poor girl would sit beside the spring and spin and spin,  until her fingers bled.    One day, while she was washing the blood from her hands, the spindle  fell into the spring and sank to the bottom.    With tears in her eyes, she ran and told her stepmother what she had  done.    The stepmother was angry and said, \"You let the spindle fall into the  spring. Now you must go and get it out.\"    The maiden went back to the spring to look for the spindle.    She leaned so far over the edge that her hand slipped, and down, down,  she sank to the very bottom.    All at once she found that she was in a beautiful field where many wild  flowers grew.    As she walked across the field, she came to a baker's oven full of new  bread.    The loaves cried to her, \"Oh, pull us out! pull us out, or we shall  burn!\"    \"Indeed I will!\" cried the maiden.    Stepping up, she pulled all the sweet brown loaves out of the oven.    As she walked along, she came to a tree full of apples.    The tree cried, \"Shake me! shake me! my apples are all quite ripe!\"    \"Indeed I will!\" cried the maiden.    So she shook the tree again and again, until there was not an apple left  on its branches.    Then she picked up the apples, one by one, and piled them in a great  heap.    [Illustration]    When she had picked up all the apples, she walked on.    At last she came to a small house.    In the doorway sat an old woman who had such large teeth that the girl  felt afraid of her and turned to run away.    Then the old woman cried, \"What do you fear, my child? Come in and live  here with me. If you will do the work about the house, I will be very  kind to you. Only take care to make my bed well.    You must shake it and pound it so that the feathers will fly about. Then  the children down on the earth will say that snowflakes are falling, for  I am Mother Frost.\"    The old woman spoke so kindly that she won the maiden's heart.    \"I will gladly work for you,\" she said.    The girl did her work well, and each day she shook up the bed until the  feathers flew about like snowflakes.    She was very happy with Mother Frost, who never spoke an angry word.    After the girl had stayed a long time with the kind old woman, she began  to feel homesick.    She could not help it, though her life with Mother Frost had been so  happy.    At length she said, \"Dear Mother Frost, you have been very kind to me,  but I should like to go home to my friends.\"    \"I am pleased to hear you say that you wish to go home,\" said Mother  Frost. \"You have worked for me so well that I will show you the way  myself.\"    She took the maiden by the hand and led her to a broad gateway.    The gate was open, and as she went through a shower of gold fell over  the maiden.    It clung to her clothes, so that she was dressed in gold from her head  to her feet.    \"That is your pay for having worked so hard,\" said the old woman. \"And  here is your spindle that fell into the spring.\"    Then the gate was closed, and the maiden found herself once more in the  world.    She was not far from her own home, and as she came into the farmyard, a  cock on the roof cried loudly:    \"Cock-a-doodle-doo!    Our golden lady has come home, too.\"      MOTHER FROST--II    When the stepmother saw the girl with her golden dress, she was kind to  her. Then the maiden told how the gold had fallen upon her.    The mother could hardly wait to have her own child try her luck in the  same way.    This time she made the idle daughter go to the spring and spin.    The lazy girl did not spin fast enough to make her fingers bleed.    So she pricked her finger with a thorn until a few drops of blood  stained the spindle.    At once she let it drop into the water, and sprang in after it herself.    The ugly girl found herself in a beautiful field, just as her sister  had.    She walked along the same path until she came to the baker's oven.    She heard the loaves cry, \"Pull us out! pull us out, or we shall burn!\"    [Illustration]    But the lazy girl said to the brown loaves, \"I will not. I do not want  to soil my hands in your dirty oven.\"    Then she walked on until she came to the apple tree.    \"Shake me! shake me!\" it cried, \"for my apples are quite ripe.\"    \"I will not,\" said the girl, \"for some of your apples might fall on my  head.\"    As she spoke, she walked lazily on.    At last the girl stood before the door of Mother Frost's house.    She had no fear of Mother Frost's great teeth, but walked right up to  the old woman and offered to be her servant.    For a whole day the girl was very busy, and did everything that she was  told to do.    On the second day she began to be lazy, and on the third day she was  still worse.    She would not get up in the morning.    The bed was never made, or shaken, so the feathers could fly about.    At last Mother Frost grew tired of her and told her that she must go  away.    This was what the lazy girl wanted, for she felt sure that now she would  have the golden shower.    Mother Frost led her to the great gate, but she passed under it, a  kettle full of black pitch was upset over her.    [Illustration]    \"That is what you get for your work,\" said the old woman, as she shut  the gate.    The idle girl walked home, covered with pitch.    When she went into the farmyard the cock on the roof cried out:    \"Cock-a-doodle-doo!    Our sticky lady has come home, too.\"    The pitch stuck so fast to the girl that, as long as she lived, it never  came off.    WILLIAM AND JACOB GRIMM              IF EVER I SEE            If ever I see,          On bush or tree,      Young birds in their pretty nest;          I must not, in play,          Steal the birds away,      To grieve their mother's breast.            My mother, I know,          Would sorrow so,      Should I be stolen away;          So I'll speak to the birds          In my softest words,      Nor hurt them in my play.            And when they can fly          In the bright blue sky,      They'll warble a song to me;          And then if I'm sad          It will make me glad      To think they are happy and free.        LYDIA MARIA CHILD            [Illustration]    WHY THE BEAR'S TAIL IS SHORT      Did you ever go to a circus where there was a bear in a cage?    Did you notice how short his tail was?    I will tell you how the bear's tail came to be short.    One very cold day in winter, a fox saw some men taking home a load of  fish.    The fox jumped upon the wagon while the men were not looking.    He threw off some of the best fish until he had enough for his dinner.    Then Mr. Fox jumped from the wagon and began to eat the fish.    While he was eating the fish, Mr. Bear came along.    \"Good morning,\" said Mr. Bear, \"you have had good luck fishing to-day.  Those are very fine fish. How did you catch them?\"    \"They are fine fish,\" said Mr. Fox.    \"If you will go fishing with me to-night, I will show you how to catch  even better fish than these.\"    \"I will go with you gladly,\" said the bear. \"I will bring my hook and  line too.\"    \"You don't need a hook and line,\" said the fox.    \"I always catch fish with my tail. You have a much longer"]]]
