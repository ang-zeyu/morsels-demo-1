Amongst indolent and  worn-out men however it subsequently became an extremely popular notion,  and, as future events clearly showed, a fatally erroneous one. I from the  first opposed it both by my words and example; and in this instance, as  soon as I conceived that the men were sufficiently rested, I moved on.    PICTURESQUE ESTUARY.    After travelling another mile we found ourselves at the head of a large  and picturesque estuary which lay north and south; the native path ran  along its shores, which were of great richness and beauty, and the  estuary itself lay to our west and was about two miles across; on the  east a series of rich undercliff limestone hills gradually rose into  lofty and precipitate ranges, between which and the estuary was the  fertile valley along which we wound our weary way; while groups of  graceful acacias with their airy and delicate foliage gave a great charm  to this beautiful spot. We moved slowly along, and ere we had made two  miles more the shades of night began to fall and I halted the party.    RICH AND FERTILE DISTRICT.    The abundance of grass which grew around enabled us to enjoy the almost  unknown luxury of a soft bed, yet as I lay down my thoughts were far from  pleasant when I found that we had only walked twelve miles today, and  this distance had been accomplished by several of the party with the  greatest difficulty. Three of them were the men who carried those heavy  loads which I could not yet induce them to abandon; now I could not but  reflect that, if their difficulty was so great in walking in a country  abounding with water, that it would be almost impossible for them to get  along in one where it was scarce; moreover the mere physical exertion of  getting unwilling men to move by persuasions and entreaties was harassing  in the extreme, and indeed had so agitated me that the night had nearly  worn away ere I closed my eyes. The rich flats we were on today have  apparently at no distant period formed part of the head of the estuary.    April 5.    Such a heavy dew had fallen during the night that when I got up in the  morning I found my clothes completely saturated, and everything looked so  verdant and flourishing compared to the parched up country which existed  to the north of us, and that which I knew lay to the south, that I tried  to find a satisfactory reason to explain so strange a circumstance, but  without success. It seemed certain however that we stood in the richest  province of South-west Australia, and one which so differs from the other  portions of it in its geological characters, in the elevations of its  mountains which lie close to the sea coast, in the fertility of its soil,  and the density of its native population, that we appeared to be moving  upon another continent. As yet however the only means I had of judging of  the large number of natives inhabiting this district had been from their  paths and warran grounds, but it was most probable that we should ere  long fall in with some of them.    We started at dawn pursuing a south-south-east direction, and at the end  of one mile rounded a bluff point; the limestone hills to the eastward  gradually decreased in elevation and we ascended one of them to gain a  view of the surrounding country. I found that the summit of this range  consisted of a terrace about half a mile wide, richly grassed and  ornamented with clumps of mimosas; to the eastward rose a precisely  similar limestone terrace, whilst to the westward lay the estuary with  its verdant and extensive flats.    APPEARANCE OF NATIVES.    As we wound our way along this terrace a large party of natives suddenly  appeared on the high ground to the eastward of us. They evinced no fear  whatever but advanced to within about two hundred yards, when I went  forward with Kaiber to induce them to hold an interview with us; this  however I could not bring about, for whenever I advanced they retreated,  and when I retired they advanced; they also now began to shout out to  their distant fellows, and these again cooeed to others still farther  off, until the calls were lost in the distance, whilst fresh  reinforcements of natives came trooping in from all directions.    INDICATIONS OF HOSTILITY. PROGRESS OPPOSED BY NATIVES.    Our situation was growing critical for had any of the party been wounded  we could not attempt to save his life by remaining with him without the  almost certain danger of losing our own, whilst on the other hand to have  abandoned him under such circumstances would have been impossible. I was  most anxious to get rid of these natives in peace, as they now could not  be induced to come to us, being most probably fearful of our numbers. I  hoped therefore they would let us go quietly on our way and moved the  party forward; but they now followed us with loud shouts, whilst those in  the distance came running up. I again halted but they would hold no  communication, and when in despair I again moved the party on we saw a  number hastening to occupy a thick scrub through which we had to pass.  The men now became so dissatisfied and alarmed that I found I should be  unable much longer to restrain them from firing if I did not disperse the  natives.    I therefore halted the party, and cocking my gun moved rapidly towards  them, motioning them away; they retired as I advanced, but directly I  turned they again followed us; I now ran towards them with my gun  pointed, when they made off before me once more, and in order to complete  their dispersion I had intended to fire over their heads; but to my great  mortification and their intense delight, my gun snapped, and, as they  found the weapon I had with me, and with which I had menaced them in so  authoritative a manner, appeared to produce no effect, they took courage,  and, turning about, made faces at me and an insulting noise which was  meant to imitate the snapping of the gun. Their inimical intentions now  became more manifest; I however ran at them again, and fired my second  barrel over their heads, which caused a rapid retreat; but they halted on  a rising ground about three hundred yards from us, and finding on the  muster of their forces that they had sustained no damage, they made  preparations, as if resolved to commence hostilities in earnest.    NATIVES DISPERSED.    As these natives had now unfortunately learnt to despise our weapons I  was compelled to act promptly, or blood would undoubtedly have been shed.  I therefore took my rifle from Coles and, directing it at a heap of  closely matted dead bushes which were distant two or three yards to the  right of their main body, I drove a ball right through it: the dry rotten  boughs crackled, and flew in all directions, whilst our enemy, utterly  confounded at this distant, novel, and unfair mode of warfare, fled from  the field in confusion, the majority of our party rejoicing at the  bloodless victory: we then wended our way along the native path which led  us down to the flats bordering the estuary, and finding there an  underground stream of water bubbling along through a limestone cavity and  having several openings upwards, we halted to refresh ourselves.    I had hoped that finding hostile natives in our vicinity would have made  the stragglers keep up better with the party, but they would neither  hasten on nor throw away their loads, so that my patience was sorely  tried; a man of the name of Stiles was the worst; nothing could induce  him to move along, and even the threat of leaving him behind produced no  effect; I however kept pushing steadily onwards, for I never thought of  the length of the journey we had to perform without trembling for the  result. We were now walking on a course of 180 degrees, and followed this  line for two miles and a half through a similar country. We still found  many native paths running along the estuary, and saw the natives fishing,  but they carefully avoided us, making off for the high lands as fast as  they could.    ESTUARY OF THE HUTT RIVER. DESCRIPTION OF THE COUNTRY AND SCENERY.    The estuary became narrower here, and shortly after seeing these natives  we came upon a river running into it from the eastward; its mouth was  about forty yards wide, the stream strong, but the water brackish, and it  flowed through a very deep ravine, having steep limestone hills on each  side: many wild-fowls were on the river, but we could not get a shot at  them. Being unable to ford the river here we followed it in a south-east  direction for two miles, and in this distance passed two native villages,  or, as the men termed them, towns, the huts of which they were composed  differed from those in the southern districts in being much larger, more  strongly built, and very nicely plastered over the outside with clay and  clods of turf, so that although now uninhabited they were evidently  intended for fixed places of residence. This again showed a marked  difference between the habits of the natives of this part of Australia  and the south-western portions of the continent; for these superior huts,  well marked roads, deeply sunk wells, and extensive warran grounds, all  spoke of a large and comparatively-speaking resident population, and the  cause of this undoubtedly must have been the great facilities for  procuring food in so rich a soil.    MOUNT VICTORIA AND MOUNT ALBERT.    We now came to two very remarkable hills bearing north-east of us and  distant about three miles, which I have named Mount Victoria and Mount  Albert. They lay about one mile apart, and were of the form shown in  Illustration 2, which will give a good idea of the flat-topped hills  hereabouts.    THE HUTT RIVER.    The river still ran in a deep wooded valley bordered by rich flats, high  hills lying both to the right and left of our line of route. Two miles  and a half more on a course of 135 degrees brought us out on some  gravelly barren plains, and just before coming to these, and in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16160"],[0,"The Treasury of Ancient Egypt (#4)"],[1,"as bad a breach of good taste as the placing of a Victorian  chandelier in an Elizabethan banqueting-hall. To furnish the room with  genuine antiquities because they are old and therefore interesting would  be to carry the museum spirit into daily life with its attending  responsibilities, and would involve all manner of incongruities and  inconsistencies; while to furnish in this manner because antiques were  valuable would be merely vulgar. There are, thus, only three  justifications that I can see for the action of the man who surrounds  himself with antiquities: he must do so because they are examples of  workmanship, because they are beautiful, or because they are endeared to  him by family usage. These, of course, are full and complete  justifications; and the value of his attitude should be felt in the  impetus which it gives to conscientious modern work. There are periods  in history at which certain arts, crafts, or industries reached an  extremely high level of excellence; and nothing can be more valuable to  modern workmen than familiarity with these periods. Well-made replicas  have a value that is overlooked only by the inartistic. Nor must it be  forgotten that modern objects of modern design will one day become  antiquities; and it should be our desire to assist in the making of the  period of our lifetime an age to which future generations will look back  for guidance and teaching. Every man can, in this manner, be of use to a  nation, if only by learning to reject poor work wherever he comes upon  it--work which he feels would not stand against the criticism of Time;  and thus it may be said that archaeology, which directs him to the best  works of the ancients, and sets him a standard and criterion, should be  an essential part of his education.

Brugsch Pasha._      The third argument which I wish to employ here to demonstrate the value  of the study of archaeology and history to the layman is based upon the  assumption that patriotism is a desirable ingredient in a man's  character. This is a premise which assuredly will be admitted. True  patriotism is essential to the maintenance of a nation. It has taken the  place, among certain people, of loyalty to the sovereign; for the armies  which used to go to war out of a blind loyalty to their king, now do so  from a sense of patriotism which is shared by the monarch (if they  happen to have the good fortune to possess one).    Patriotism is often believed to consist of a love of one's country, in  an affection for the familiar villages or cities, fields or streets, of  one's own dwelling-place. This is a grievous error. Patriotism should be  an unqualified desire for the welfare of the race as a whole. It is not  really patriotic for the Englishman to say, \"I love England\": it is only  natural. It is not patriotic for him to say, \"I don't think much of  foreigners\": it is only a form of narrowness of mind which, in the case  of England and certain other countries, happens sometimes to be rather a  useful attitude, but in the case of several nations, of which a good  example is Egypt, would be detrimental to their own interests. It was  not unqualified patriotism that induced the Greeks to throw off the  Ottoman yoke: it was largely dislike of the Turks. It is not patriotism,  that is to say undiluted concern for the nation as a whole, which leads  some of the modern Egyptians to prefer an entirely native government to  the Anglo-Egyptian administration now obtaining in that country: it is  restlessness; and I am fortunately able to define it thus without the  necessity of entering the arena of polemics by an opinion as to whether  that restlessness is justified or not justified.    If patriotism were but the love of one's tribe and one's dwelling-place,  then such undeveloped or fallen races as, for example, the American  Indians, could lay their downfall at the door of that sentiment; since  the exclusive love of the tribe prevented the small bodies from  amalgamating into one great nation for the opposing of the invader. If  patriotism were but the desire for government without interference, then  the breaking up of the world's empires would be urged, and such  federations as the United States of America would be intolerable.    Patriotism is, and must be, the desire for the progress and welfare of  the whole nation, without any regard whatsoever to the conditions under  which that progress takes place, and without any prejudice in favour  either of self-government or of outside control. I have no hesitation in  saying that the patriotic Pole is he who is in favour of Russian or  German control of his country's affairs; for history has told him quite  plainly that he cannot manage them himself. The Nationalist in any  country runs the risk of being the poorest patriot in the land, for his  continuous cry is for self-government, without any regard to the  question as to whether such government will be beneficial to his nation  in the long-run.    The value of history to patriotism, then, is to be assessed under two  headings. In the first place, history defines the attitude which the  patriot should assume. It tells him, in the clear light of experience,  what is, and what is not, good for his nation, and indicates to him how  much he may claim for his country. And in the second place, it gives to  the patriots of those nations which have shown capacity and ability in  the past a confidence in the present; it permits in them the indulgence  of that enthusiasm which will carry them, sure-footed, along the path  of glory.    Archaeology, as the discovery and classification of the facts of history,  is the means by which we may obtain a true knowledge of what has  happened in the past. It is the instrument with which we may dissect  legend, and extract from myth its ingredients of fact. Cold history  tells the Greek patriot, eager to enter the fray, that he must set  little store by the precedent of the deeds of the Trojan war. It tells  the English patriot that the \"one jolly Englishman\" of the old rhyme is  not the easy vanquisher of the \"two froggy Frenchmen and one Portugee\"  which tradition would have him believe. He is thus enabled to steer a  middle course between arrant conceit and childish fright. History tells  him the actual facts: history is to the patriot what \"form\" is to the  racing man.    In the case of the English (Heaven be praised!) history opens up a  boundless vista for the patriotic. The Englishman seldom realises how  much he has to be proud of in his history, or how loudly the past cries  upon him to be of good cheer. One hears much nowadays of England's  peril, and it is good that the red signals of danger should sometimes be  displayed. But let every Englishman remember that history can tell him  of greater perils faced successfully; of mighty armies commanded by the  greatest generals the world has ever known, held in check year after  year, and finally crushed by England; of vast fleets scattered or  destroyed by English sailors; of almost impregnable cities captured by  British troops. \"There is something very characteristic,\" writes  Professor Seeley,[1] \"in the indifference which we show towards the  mighty phenomenon of the diffusion of our race and the expansion of our  state. We seem, as it were, to have conquered and peopled half the world  in a fit of absence of mind.\"        [Footnote 1: 'The Expansion of England,' p. 10.]    The history of England, and later of the British Empire, constitutes a  tale so amazing that he who has the welfare of the nation as a whole at  heart--that is to say, the true patriot--is justified in entertaining  the most optimistic thoughts for the future. He should not be  indifferent to the past: he should bear it in mind all the time.  Patriotism may not often be otherwise than misguided if no study of  history has been made. The patriot of one nation will wish to procure  for his country a freedom which history would show him to have been its  very curse; and the patriot of another nation will encourage a  nervousness and restraint in his people which history would tell him was  unnecessary. The English patriot has a history to read which, at the  present time, it is especially needful for him to consider; and, since  Egyptology is my particular province, I cannot better close this  argument than by reminding the modern Egyptians that their own history  of four thousand years and its teaching must be considered by them when  they speak of patriotism. A nation so talented as the descendants of the  Pharaohs, so industrious, so smart and clever, should give a far larger  part of its attention to the arts, crafts, and industries, of which  Egyptian archaeology has to tell so splendid a story.    As a final argument for the value of the study of history and archaeology  an aspect of the question may be placed before the reader which will  perhaps be regarded as fanciful, but which, in all sincerity, I believe  to be sober sense.    In this life of ours which, under modern conditions, is lived at so  great a speed, there is a growing need for a periodical pause wherein  the mind may adjust the relationship of the things that have been to  those that are. So rapidly are our impressions received and assimilated,  so individually are they shaped or classified, that, in whatever  direction our brains lead us, we are speedily carried beyond that  province of thought which is common to us all. A man who lives alone  finds himself, in a few months, out of touch with the thought of his  contemporaries; and, similarly, a man who lives in what is called an  up-to-date manner soon finds"]]]
