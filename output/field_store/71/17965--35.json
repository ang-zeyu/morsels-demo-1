[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1723"],[0,"Cow-Country (#4)"],[1,"when a little wind puffed out of the  darkness and the oxen threw up their heads and sniffed, and put a new  note into their \"M-baw-aw-aw-mm!\" They swung sharply so that the wind  blew straight into the front of the wagon, which lurched forward with a  new impetus.    \"Glo-ory t' Gawd, Missy! dey smells watah, sho 's yo' bawn!\" sobbed Ezra  as he broke into a trot beside the wheelers. \"'Tain't fur--lookit dat-ah  huhd a-goin' it! No 'm, Missy, DEY ain't woah out--dey smellin' watah  an' dey'm gittin' TO it! 'Tain't fur, Missy.\"    Buddy clung to the back of the seat and stared round-eyed into the  gloom. He never forgot that lumpy shadow which was the herd, traveling  fast in dust that obscured the nearest stars. The shadow humped here  and there as the cattle crowded forward at a shuffling half trot, the  click--awash of their shambling feet treading close on one another. The  rapping tattoo of wide-spread horns clashing against wide-spread horns  filled him with a formless terror, so that he let go the seat to clutch  at mother's dress. He was not afraid of cattle-they were as much a  part of his world as were Ezra and the wagon and the camp-fires-but he  trembled with the dread which no man could name for him.    These were not the normal, everyday sounds of the herd. The herd had  somehow changed from plodding animals to one overwhelming purpose that  would sweep away anything that came in its path. Two thousand parched  throats and dust-dry tongues-and suddenly the smell of water that would  go gurgling down two thousand eager gullets, and every intervening  second a cursed delay against which the cattle surged blindly. It was  the mob spirit, when the mob was fighting for its very existence.    Over the bellowing of the cattle a yelling cowboy now and then made  himself heard. The four oxen straining under their yokes broke into  a lumbering gallop lest they be outdistanced by the herd, and Dulcie  screamed when the wagon lurched across a dry wash and almost upset,  while Ezra plied the ox-whip and yelled frantically at first one ox and  then another, inventing names for the new ones. Buddy drew in his breath  and held it until the wagon rolled on four wheels instead of two, but he  did not scream.    Still the big river did not come. It seemed to Buddy that the cattle  would never stop running. Tangled in the terror was Ezra's shouting  as he ran alongside the wagon and called to Missy that it was \"Dat ole  Crumpy actin' the fool\", and that the wagon wouldn't upset. \"No'm, dey's  jest in a hurry to git dere fool haids sunk to de eyes in dat watah. Dey  ain't aimin' to run away--no'm, dish yer ain't no stampede!\"    Perhaps Buddy dozed. The next thing he remembered, day was breaking,  with the sun all red, seen through the dust. The herd was still going,  but now it was running and somehow the yoked oxen were keeping close  behind, lumbering along with heads held low and the sweat reeking from  their spent bodies. Buddy heard dimly his mother's sharp command to  Ezra:    \"Stand back, Ezra! We're not going to be caught in that terrible trap.  They're piling over the bank ahead of us. Get away from the leaders. I  am going to shoot.\"    Buddy crawled up a little higher on the blankets behind the seat, and  saw mother steady herself and aim the rifle straight at Crumpy. There  was the familiar, deafening roar, the acrid smell of black powder smoke,  and Crumpy went down loosely, his nose rooting the trampled ground for  a space before the gun belched black smoke again and Crumpy's yoke-mate  pitched forward. The wagon stopped so abruptly that Buddy sprawled  helplessly on his back like an overturned beetle.    He saw mother stand looking down at the wheelers, that backed and  twisted their necks under their yokes. Her lips were set firmly  together, and her eyes were bright with purple hollows beneath. She held  the rifle for a moment, then set the butt of it on the \"jockey box\" just  in front of the dashboard. The wheelers, helpless between the weight of  the wagon behind and the dead oxen in front, might twist their necks off  but they could do no damage.    \"Unyoke the wheelers, Ezra, and let the poor creatures have their chance  at the water,\" she cried sharply, and Ezra, dodging the horns of the  frantic brutes, made shift to obey.    Fairly on the bank of the sluggish stream with its flood-worn channel  and its treacherous patches of quicksand, the wagon thus halted by the  sheer nerve and quick-thinking of mother became a very small island in a  troubled sea of weltering backs and tossing horns and staring eyeballs.  Riders shouted and lashed unavailingly with their quirts, trying to  hold back the full bulk of the herd until the foremost had slaked  their thirst and gone on. But the herd was crazy for the water, and  the foremost were plunged headlong into the soft mud where they mired,  trampled under the hoofs of those who came crowding from behind.    Someone shouted, close to the wagon yet down the bank at the edge of the  water. The words were indistinguishable, but a warning was in the voice.  On the echo of that cry, a man screamed twice.    \"Ezra!\" cried mother fiercely. \"It's Frank Davis--they've got him down,  somehow. Climb over the backs of the cattle--There's no other way--and  GET HIM!\"    \"Yas'm, Missy!\" Ezra called back, and then Buddy saw him go over the  herd, scrambling, jumping from back to back.    Buddy remembered that always, and the funeral they had later in the day,  when the herd was again just trail-weary cattle feeding hungrily on the  scanty grass. Down at the edge of the creek the carcasses of many dead  animals lay half-buried in the mud. Up on a little knoll where a few  stunted trees grew, the negroes dug a long, deep hole. Mother's eyes  were often filled with tears that day, and the cowboys scarcely talked  at all when they gathered at the chuckwagon.    After a while they all went to the hole which the negroes had dug, and  there was a long Something wrapped up in canvas. Mother wore her best  dress which was black, and father and all the boys had shaved their  faces and looked very sober. The negroes stood back in a group by  themselves, and every few minutes Buddy saw them draw their tattered  shirtsleeves across their faces. And father--Buddy looked once and saw  two tears running down father's cheeks. Buddy was shocked into a stony  calm. He had never dreamed that fathers ever cried.    Mother read out of her Bible, and all the boys held their hats in front  of them, with their hands clasped, and looked at the ground while she  read. Then mother sang. She sang, \"We shall meet beyond the river\",  which Buddy thought was a very queer song, because they were all there  but Frank Davis; then she sang \"Nearer, My God, to Thee.\" Buddy sang  too, piping the notes accurately, with a vague pronunciation of the  words and a feeling that somehow he was helping mother.    After that they put the long, canvas-wrapped Something down in the hole,  and mother said \"Our Father Who Art in Heaven \", with Buddy repeating it  uncertainly after her and pausing to say \"TRETHpatheth\" very carefully.  Then mother picked up Dulcie in her arms, took Buddy by the hand and  walked slowly back to the wagon, and would not let him turn to see what  the boys were doing.    It was from that day that Buddy missed Frank Davis, who had mysteriously  gone to Heaven, according to mother. Buddy's interest in Heaven was  extremely keen for a time, and he asked questions which not even mother  could answer. Then his memory of Frank Davis blurred. But never his  memory of that terrible time when the Tomahawk outfit lost five hundred  cattle in the dry drive and the stampede for water.        CHAPTER THREE: SOME INDIAN LORE    Buddy knew Indians as he knew cattle, horses, rattlesnakes and  storms--by having them mixed in with his everyday life. He couldn't tell  you where or when he had learned that Indians are tricky. Perhaps his  first ideas on that subject were gleaned from the friendly tribes who  lived along the Chisolm Trail and used to visit the chuck-wagon, their  blankets held close around them and their eyes glancing everywhere while  they grinned and talked and pointed--and ate. Buddy used to sit in the  chuck-wagon, out of harm's way, and watch them eat.    Step-and-a-Half had a way of entertaining Indians which never failed  to interest Buddy, however often he witnessed it. When Step-and-a-Half  glimpsed Indians coming afar off, he would take his dishpan and dump  into it whatever scraps of food were left over from the preceding meal.  He used to say that Indians could smell grub as far as a buzzard can  smell a dead carcase, and Buddy believed it, for they always arrived at  meal time or shortly afterwards. Step-and-a-Half would make a stew, if  there were scraps enough. If the gleanings were small, he would use the  dishwater--he was a frugal man--and with that for the start-off he would  make soup, which the Indians gulped down with great relish and many  gurgly sounds.    Buddy watched them eat what he called pig-dinner. When Step-and-a-Half  was not looking he saw them steal whatever their dirty brown hands could  readily snatch and hide under their blankets. So he knew from very early  experience that Indians were not to be trusted.    Once, when he had again strayed too far from camp, some Indians riding  that way saw him, and one leaned and lifted him from the ground and rode  off with him. Buddy did not struggle much. He saved his breath for the  long, shrill yell of cow-country. Twice he yodled before the Indian  clapped a hand over his mouth.    Father and some of the cowboys heard and came after, riding hard and  shooting as they came. Buddy's pink apron fluttered a signal flag in the  arms of his captor, and so it happened that the bullets whistled close  to that particular Indian. He gathered a handful of calico between  Buddy's shoulders, held him aloft like a puppy,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17249"],[0,"Added Upon (#4)"],[1,"ality,  and the memory of this world is taken away; but this I may tell you,  that by the power of your spiritual insight and moral strength you will  be able to exert a correcting influence over your brothers and sisters  in the flesh, and especially over those of your kin. Then again, when  you hear the gospel of our Elder Brother preached, it will have a  familiar sound to you and you will receive it gladly. Then you will  become teachers to your households and a light unto your families.  Again, not only to those in the flesh will you minister. Many will have  passed from earth-life in ignorance of the gospel of salvation when you  come. These must have the saving ordinances of the gospel performed for  them, so that when they some time receive the truth, the necessary rites  will have been performed. This work, also, is a part of your mission--to  enter into the Temples of the Lord, male and female, each for his and  her kind, and do this work.\"    A sister, pressing timidly forward near to him who had been chosen, took  his hand, and looked pleadingly into the face of the messenger. \"May not  I, too, go?\" she asked. \"I believe I could help a little.\"    The messenger smiled at her, seeing to whose hand she clung. \"I think  so,\" he said; \"but we shall see.\"    \"When do we go?\" asked the brother.    \"Not yet. Abide the will of the Father,--and peace be with you all.\"    He left them in awed silence. Then, presently, they began to speak to  each other of the wonderful things they had heard and the call that had  come to some of them.    Times and seasons, nations and peoples had come and gone. Millions of  the sons and daughters of God had passed through the earthly school, and  had gone on to other fields of labor, some with honor, others with  dishonor. God's spiritual intelligences, in their innumerable gradations  were being allotted their times and places. The scheme of things  inaugurated by the Father was working out its legitimate results.    Homan's time had come for him to leave his spiritual home. He was now to  take the step, which, though temporarily downward, would secure him a  footing by which to climb to greater heights. Delsa was still in her  first estate. So also was Sardus. They, with a company, were gathered to  bid Homan farewell, and thus they spoke:    \"We do not know,\" Homan was saying, \"whether or not we shall meet on  the earth. Our places and callings may be far apart, and we may never  know or recognize each other until that day when we shall meet again in  the mansions of our Father.\"    \"I am thankful for one thing: I understand that a more opportune time in  which to fill our probation has never been known on the earth. The  Gospel exists there in its fulness, and the time of utter spiritual  darkness has gone. The race is strong and can give us sound bodies. Now,  if we are worthy, we shall, no doubt, secure a parentage that will give  us those powers of mind and body which are needed to successfully combat  the powers of evil.\"    It was no new doctrine to them, but they loved to dwell upon the  glorious theme.    \"We have been taught that we shall get that position to which our  preparation here entitles us. Existence is eternal, and its various  stages grade naturally into one another, like the different departments  of a school.\"    \"Some have been ordained to certain positions of trust. Father knows us  all, and understands what we will do. Many of our mighty ones have  already gone, and many are yet with us awaiting Father's will.\"    \"I was once quite impatient. Everything seemed to pass so slowly, I  thought; but now I see in it the wisdom of the Father. What confusion  would result if too many went to the earth-life at once. The experience  of those who go before are for our better reception.\"    \"Sardus,\" said Homan, \"I hear that you are taking great delight in  music.\"    \"That is expressing the truth mildly, dear Homan. Lately I can think of  nothing else.\"    \"What is your opinion of a person being so carried away with one  subject?\" asked one.    \"I was going to say,\" answered Homan, \"that I think there is danger in  it. Some I know who neglect every other duty except the cultivation of a  certain gift. I think we ought to grow into a perfectly rounded  character, cultivating all of Father's gifts to us, but not permitting  any of them to become an object of worship.\"    \"Remember, we take with us our various traits,\" said Delsa. \"I think,  Homan, your view is correct. It is well enough to excel in one thing,  but that should not endanger our harmonious development.\"    \"I have noticed, Delsa, that you are quite an adept at depicting the  beautiful in Father's creations.\"    \"I?\" she asked; \"there is no danger of my becoming a genius in that  line. I do not care enough for it, though I do a little of it.\"    Thus they conversed; then they sang songs. Tunes born of heavenly melody  thrilled them. After a time they separated, and Homan would have gone  his way alone, but Delsa touched him on the arm.    \"Homan, there is something I wish to tell you,\" she said. \"May I walk  with you?\"    \"Instead I will go with you,\" he replied.    They went on together.    \"I, too, soon am going to earth,\" she said.    \"Is it true?\"    \"Yes; Mother has informed me and I have been preparing for some time.  Dear Homan, I am so glad, still the strange uncertainty casts a peculiar  feeling over me. Oh, if we could but be classmates in the future  school.\"    \"Father may order it that way,\" he replied. \"He knows our desires, and  if they are righteous and for our good He may see that they are  gratified. Do you go soon?\"    \"Yes; but not so soon as you. You will go before and prepare a welcome  for me. Then I will come.\" She smiled up into his face.    \"By faith we see afar,\" he replied.    \"Yes; we live by faith,\" she added.    Hand in hand, they went. They spoke no more, but communed with each  other through a more subtle channel of silence. Celestial melodies rang  in their ears; the celestial landscape gladdened their eyes; the peace  of God, their Father, was in their hearts. They walked hand in hand for  the last time in this, their first estate.          PART SECOND.      \"Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting;    The soul that rises with us, our life's star,      Hath had elsewhere its setting,        And cometh from afar.      Not in entire forgetfulness      And not in utter nakedness,    But trailing clouds of glory do we come      From God who is our home.\"    --_Wordsworth._      \"Two shall be born the whole wide world apart,    And speak in different tongues and have no thought    Each of the other's being, and no heed;    And these o'er unknown seas and unknown lands    Shall cross, escaping wreck, defying death;    And all unconsciously shape every act    And bend each wandering step to this one end--    That, one day, out of darkness they shall meet    And read life's meaning in each other's eyes.\"    --_Susan Marr Spalding._          I.      \"Even a child is known by his doings.\"--_Prov. 20:11._      How it did rain! For two long months the sky had been one unchangeable  color of blue; but now the dark clouds hung low and touched the horizon  at every point dropping their long-accumulated water on the thirsty  barrens, soaking the dried-up fields and meadows. The earth was thirsty,  and the sky had at last taken pity. It rained all day. The water-ditches  along the streets of the village ran thick and black. The house-wife's  tubs and buckets under the dripping eaves were overrunning. The dust was  washed from the long rows of trees which lined the streets.    It rained steadily all over the valley. The creek which came from the  mountains, and which distributed its waters to the town and adjacent  farm-lands, was unusually muddy. Up in the canyon, just above the town,  it seemed to leap over the rocks with unwonted fury, dashing its brown  waters into white foam. The town below, the farms and gardens of the  whole valley, depended for their existence on that small river. Through  the long, hot summer its waters had been distributed into streams and  sub-streams like the branches of a great tree, and had carried the  life-giving element to the growing vegetation in the valley; but now it  was master no more. The rain was pouring down on places which the river  could not reach. No wonder the river seemed angry at such usurpation.    About two miles from town, upon the high bench-land which lay above the  waters in the river, stood a hut. It was built of unhewn logs, and had a  mud roof. Stretches of sagebrush desert reached in every direction from  it. A few acres of cleared land lay near by, its yellow stubble drinking  in the rain. A horse stood under a shed. A pile of sagebrush with ax and  chopping block lay in the yard.    Evening came on and still it rained. A woman often appeared at the door  of the hut, and a pale, anxious face peered out into the twilight. She  looked out over the bench-land and then up to the mountains. Through the  clouds which hung around their summits, she could see the peaks being  covered with snow. She looked at the sky, then again along the plain.  She went in, closed the door, and filled the stove from the brush-wood  in the box. A little girl was sitting in the corner by the stove, with  her feet resting on the hearth.    \"I thought I heard old Reddy's bell,\" she said, looking up to her  mother.    \"No; I heard nothing. Poor boy, he must be wet through.\"    The mud roof was leaking, and pans and buckets were placed here and  there to catch the water. The bed had been moved a number of times to  find a dry spot, but at last two milk pans and a pail had to be placed  on it. Drip, drip, rang the tins--and it still rained.    The mother went again to the door. The clang of cow-bells greeted her,  and in a few minutes, a boy drove two cows into the shed. The mother  held the door open while he came stamping into the house.
