He had a  kindly, benevolent expression; his otherwise plain face was redeemed  by fine, expressive brown eyes. Usually silent and preoccupied, and  almost taciturn, yet he possessed a fund of dry humor. An  old-fashioned Democrat, his wife was a Republican. He usually  accompanied Aunt Sarah to her church, the Methodist, although he was a  member of the German Reformed, and declared he had changed his  religion to please her, but change his politics, never. A member of  the Masonic Lodge, his only diversion was an occasional trip to the  city with a party of the \"boys\" to attend a meeting of the \"Shriners.\"    Aunt Sarah protested. \"The idea, John, at your age, being out so late  at night and returning from the city on the early milk train the  following morning, and then being still several miles from home. It's  scandalous!\"    He only chuckled to himself; and what the entertainment had been,  which was provided at Lulu Temple, and which he had so thoroughly  enjoyed, was left to her imagination. His only remark when questioned  was: \"Sarah, you're not in it. You are not a 'Shriner.'\" And as John  had in every other particular fulfilled her ideal of what constitutes  a good husband, Sarah, like the wise woman she was, allowed the  subject to drop.    A good, practical, progressive farmer, John Landis constantly read,  studied and pondered over the problem of how to produce the largest  results at least cost of time and labor. His crops were skillfully  planted in rich soil, carefully cultivated and usually harvested  earlier than those of his neighbors. One summer he raised potatoes so  large that many of them weighed one pound each, and new potatoes and  green peas, fresh from the garden, invariably appeared on Aunt Sarah's  table the first of July, and sometimes earlier. I have known him to  raise cornstalks which reached a height of thirteen feet, which were  almost equaled by his wife's sunflower stalks, which usually averaged  nine feet in height.    Aunt Sarah, speaking one day to Mary, said: \"Your Uncle John is an  unusually silent man. I have heard him remark that when people talk  continuously they are either _very_ intelligent or tell untruths.\" He,  happening to overhear her remark, quickly retorted:        \"The man who speaks a dozen tongues,        When all is said and done,      Don't hold a match to him who knows        How to keep still in one.\"    When annoyed at his wife's talkativeness, her one fault in her  husband's eyes, if he thought she had a fault, he had a way of saying,  \"Alright, Sarah, Alright,\" as much as to say \"that is final; you have  said enough,\" in his peculiar, quick manner of speaking, which Aunt  Sarah never resented, he being invariably kind and considerate in  other respects.    John Landis was a successful farmer because he loved his work, and  found joy in it. While not unmindful of the advantages possessed by  the educated farmer of the present day, he said, \"'Tis not college  lore our boys need so much as practical education to develop their  efficiency. While much that we eat and wear comes out of the ground,  we should have more farmers, the only way to lower the present high  cost of living, which is such a perplexing problem to the housewife.  There is almost no limit to what might be accomplished by some of our  bright boys should they make agriculture a study. Luther Burbank says,  'To add but one kernel of corn to each ear grown in this country in a  single year would increase the supply five million bushels.'\"          CHAPTER V.    THE OLD FARM HOUSE AND GARDEN.      The old unpainted farm house, built of logs a century ago, had changed  in the passing years to a grayish tint. An addition had been built to  the house several years before Aunt Sarah's occupancy, The sober hue  of the house harmonized with the great, gnarled old trunk of the  meadow willow near-by. Planted when the house was built, it spread its  great branches protectingly over it. A wild clematis growing at the  foot of the tree twined its tendrils around the massive trunk until in  late summer they had become an inseparable part of it, almost covering  it with feathery blossoms.    [Illustration: Old Corn Crib]    [Illustration: The New Barn]    Near by stood an antique arbor, covered with thickly-clustering vines,  in season bending with the weight of \"wild-scented\" grapes, their  fragrance mingling with the odor of \"Creek Mint\" growing near by a  small streamlet and filling the air with a delicious fragrance. The  mint had been used in earlier years by Aunt Sarah's grandfather as a  beverage which he preferred to any other.    From a vine clambering up the grape arbor trellies, in the fall of the  year, hung numerous orange-colored balsam apples, which opened, when  ripe, disclosing bright crimson interior and seeds. These apples, Aunt  Sarah claimed, if placed in alcohol and applied externally, possessed  great medicinal value as a specific for rheumatism.    [Illustration: THE OLD FARM HOUSE]    A short distance from the house stood the newly-built red barn, facing  the pasture lot. On every side stretched fields which, in summer,  waved with wheat, oats, rye and buckwheat, and the corn crib stood  close by, ready for the harvest to fill it to overflowing. Beside the  farm house door stood a tall, white oleander, planted in a large,  green-painted wooden tub. Near by, in a glazed earthenware pot, grew  the old-fashioned lantana plant, covered with clusters of tiny  blossoms, of various shades of orange, red and pink.    In flower beds outlined by clam shells which had been freshly  whitewashed blossomed fuchsias, bleeding hearts, verbenas, dusty  millers, sweet clove-scented pinks, old-fashioned, dignified, purple  digitalis or foxglove, stately pink Princess Feather, various  brilliant-hued zinnias, or more commonly called \"Youth and Old Age,\"  and as gayly colored, if more humble and lowly, portulacas; the  fragrant white, star-like blossoms of the nicotiana, or \"Flowering  Tobacco,\" which, like the yellow primrose, are particularly fragrant  at sunset. Geraniums of every hue, silver-leaved and rose-scented;  yellow marigolds and those with brown, velvety petals; near by the  pale green and white-mottled leaves of the plant called \"Snow on the  Mountain\" and in the centre of one of the large, round flower beds,  grew sturdy \"Castor Oil Beans,\" their large, copper-bronze leaves  almost covering the tiny blue forget-me-nots growing beneath. Near the  flower bed grew a thrifty bush of pink-flowering almonds; not far  distant grew a spreading \"shrub\" bush, covered with fragrant brown  buds, and beside it a small tree of pearly-white snowdrops.    Sarah Landis loved the wholesome, earthy odors of growing plants and  delighted in her flowers, particularly the perennials, which were  planted promiscuously all over the yard. I have frequently heard her  quote: \"One is nearer God's heart in a garden than any place else on  earth.\" And she would say, \"I love the out-of-door life, in touch with  the earth; the natural life of man or woman.\" Inside the fence of the  kitchen garden were planted straight rows of both red and yellow  currants, and several gooseberry bushes. In one corner of the garden,  near the summer kitchen, stood a large bush of black currants, from  the yellow, sweet-scented blossoms of which Aunt Sarah's bees, those  \"Heaven instructed mathematicians,\" sucked honey. Think of Aunt  Sarah's buckwheat cakes, eaten with honey made from currant, clover,  buckwheat and dandelion blossoms!    Her garden was second to none in Bucks County. She planted tomato  seeds in boxes and placed them in a sunny window, raising her plants  early; hence she had ripe tomatoes before any one else in the  neighborhood. Her peas were earlier also, and her beets and potatoes  were the largest; her corn the sweetest; and, as her asparagus bed was  always well salted, her asparagus was the finest to be had.    Through the centre of the garden patch, on either side the walk, were  large flower beds, a blaze of brilliant color from early Spring, when  the daffodils blossomed, until frost killed the dahlias, asters,  scarlet sage, sweet Williams, Canterbury bells, pink and white  snapdragon, spikes of perennial, fragrant, white heliotrope; blue  larkspur, four o'clocks, bachelor buttons and many other dear,  old-fashioned flowers. The dainty pink, funnel-shaped blossoms of the  hardy swamp \"Rose Mallow'\" bloomed the entire Summer, the last flowers  to be touched by frost, vying in beauty with the pink monthly roses  planted near by.    Children who visited Aunt Sarah delighted in the small Jerusalem  cherry tree, usually covered with bright, scarlet berries, which was  planted near the veranda, and they never tired pinching the tiny  leaves of the sensitive plant to see them quickly droop, as if dead,  then slowly unfold and straighten as if a thing of life.    Visitors to the farm greatly admired the large, creamy-white lily-like  blossoms of the datura. Farthest from the house were the useful herb  beds, filled with parsley, hoarhound, sweet marjoram, lavender,  saffron, sage, sweet basil, summer savory and silver-striped rosemary  or \"old man,\" as it was commonly called by country folk.    Tall clusters of phlox, a riot of color in midsummer, crimson-eyed,  white and rose-colored blossoms topping the tall steins, and clusters  of brilliant-red bergamot near by had been growing, from time  immemorial, a cluster of green and white-striped grass, without which  no door yard in this section of Bucks County was considered complete  in olden times. Near by, silvery plumes of pampas grass gently swayed  on their reed-like"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13559"],[0,"The Backwoods of Canada (#4)"],[1,"weed that grows in my path, or the fly that flutters about me,  are subjects for reflection, admiration and delight.    We are now within sight of Green Island. It is the largest, and I  believe one of the most populous we have passed. Every minute now seems  to increase the beauty of the passage. Far as the eye can reach you see  the shore thronged with villages and farms in one continuous line. On  the southern side all are gay and glittering with the tin roofs on the  most important buildings; the rest are shingles, whitewashed. This I do  not like so well as the plain shingled roofs; the whiteness of the roofs  of the cottages and homesteads have a glaring effect, and we look in  vain for that relief to the eye that is produced by the thatched or  slated roofs. The shingles in their natural state soon acquire the  appearance of slates, and can hardly be distinguished from them. What  would you say to a rose-coloured house, with a roof of the same gaudy  hue, the front of the gay edifice being garnished with grass green  shutters, doors, and verandah. No doubt the interior is furnished with  corresponding taste. There is generally one or more of these _smart_  buildings in a Canadian village, standing forth with ostentatious  splendour above its more modest brethren.    August 11.--Just below Green Island we took on board a real pilot, who,  by the way, I do not like half so well as Monsieur Paul. He is a little  bit pragmatical, and seems evidently proud of his superior knowledge of  the river. The good-natured fisherman relinquished his post with a very  good grace, and seems already excellent friends with his more able  rival. For my part I was very sorry when the new pilot came on board;  the first thing he did was to hand us over a pamphlet, containing  regulations from the Board of Health at Quebec respecting the cholera,  which is raging, he tells us, like a fearful plague both at that place  and Montreal.    These regulations positively forbid the captain and the pilot to allow  any person, whether of the crew or passengers, to quit the vessel until  they shall have passed examination at the quarantine ground, under the  risk of incurring a severe penalty.    This was very annoying; as the captain, that very morning, had proposed  taking us on shore at a lovely spot called Crane Island, to spend the  afternoon, while we waited for the return of the tide, at the house of a  Scotch gentleman, the owner of the prettiest settlement I had yet seen,  the buildings and grounds being laid out with great taste.    The situation of this island is of itself very beautiful. Around it are  the waters of the St. Laurence, bearing on its mighty current the  commerce of several nations: in the foreground are the populous and  lively settlements of the southern shores, while behind and far, far  above it rise the lofty range of mountains to the north, now studded  with rural villages, pleasant farms, and cultivated fields. The island  itself showed us smooth lawns and meadows of emerald verdure, with  orchards and corn-fields sloping down to the water's edge. After a  confinement of nearly five weeks on board, you may easily suppose with  what satisfaction we contemplated the prospect of spending a few hours  on this inviting spot.    We expect to reach the quarantine ground (Gros Isle) this evening, where  the pilot says we shall be detained three days. Though we are all in  good health, yet, having sailed from an infected port, we shall be  detained on the quarantine ground, but not allowed to land.    August 12.--We reached Gros Isle yesterday evening. It is a beautiful  rocky island, covered with groves of beech, birch, ash, and fir-trees.  There are several vessels lying at anchor close to the shore; one bears  the melancholy symbol of disease, the yellow flag; she is a passenger-  ship, and has the smallpox and measles among her crew. When any  infectious complaint appears on board, the yellow flag is hoisted, and  the invalids conveyed to the cholera-hospital or wooden building, that  has been erected on a rising bank above the shore. It is surrounded with  palisadoes and a guard of soldiers.    There is also a temporary fort at some distance from the hospital,  containing a garrison of soldiers, who are there to enforce the  quarantine rules. These rules are considered as very defective, and in  some respects quite absurd, and are productive of many severe evils to  the unfortunate emigrants.    When the passengers and crew of a vessel do not exceed a certain number,  they are not allowed to land under a penalty, both to the captain and  the offender; but if, on the contrary, they should exceed the stated  number, ill or well, passengers and crew must all turn out and go on  shore, taking with them their bedding and clothes, which are all spread  out on the shore, to be washed, aired, and fumigated, giving the healthy  every chance of taking the infection from the invalids. The sheds and  buildings put up for the accommodation of those who are obliged to  submit to the quarantine laws, are in the same area as the hospital.    [* It is to be hoped that some steps will be taken by Government to  remedy these obnoxious laws which have repeatedly entailed those very  evils on the unhappy emigrants that the Board of Health wish to avert  from the colony at large.    Many valuable lives have been wantonly sacrificed by placing the healthy  in the immediate vicinity of infection, besides subjecting them to many  other sufferings, expenses, and inconvenience, which the poor exile  might well be spared.    If there must be quarantine laws--and I suppose the evil is a necessary  one--surely every care ought to be taken to render them as little  hurtful to the emigrant as possible.]    Nothing can exceed the longing desire I feel to be allowed to land and  explore this picturesque island; the weather is so fine, and the waving  groves of green, the little rocky bays and inlets of the island, appear  so tempting; but to all my entreaties the visiting surgeon who came on  board returned a decided negative.    A few hours after his visit, however, an Indian basket, containing  strawberries and raspberries, with a large bunch of wild flowers, was  sent on board for me, with the surgeon's compliments.    I amuse myself with making little sketches of the fort and the  surrounding scenery, or watching the groups of emigrants on shore. We  have already seen the landing of the passengers of three emigrant ships.  You may imagine yourself looking on a fair or crowded market, clothes  waving in the wind or spread out on the earth, chests, bundles, baskets,  men, women, and children, asleep or basking in the sun, some in motion  busied with their goods, the women employed in washing or cooking in the  open air, beside the wood fires on the beach; while parties of children  are pursuing each other in wanton glee rejoicing in their newly-acquired  liberty. Mixed with these you see the stately form and gay trappings of  the sentinels, while the thin blue smoke of the wood fires, rising above  the trees, heightens the picture and gives it an additional effect. On  my husband remarking the picturesque appearance of scene before us to  one of the officers from the fort who had come on board, he smiled  sadly, and replied, \"Believe me, in this instance, as in many others,  'tis distance lends enchantment to the view.\" Could you take a nearer  survey of some of those very picturesque groups which you admire, I  think you would turn away from them with heart sickness; you would there  behold every variety of disease, vice, poverty, filth, and famine--human  misery in its most disgusting and saddening form. Such pictures as  Hogarth's pencil only could have pourtrayed, or Crabbe's pen described.    August 14.--We are once more under weigh, and floating up the river with  the tide. Gros Isle is just five and twenty miles below Quebec, a  favourable breeze would carry us up in a few hours; as it is we can only  make a little way by tacking from side to side when we lose the tide. I  rather enjoy this way of proceeding, as it gives one a close view of  both sides the river, which narrows considerably as we approach nearer  towards Quebec. To-morrow, if no accident happens, we shall be anchored  in front of a place rendered interesting both by its historical  associations and its own native beauty of situation. Till to-morrow,  then, adieu.    I was reckoning much on seeing the falls of Montmorenci, which are  within sight of the river; but the sun set, and the stars rose  brilliantly before we approached within sound of the cataract; and  though I strained my eyes till they were weary of gazing on the dim  shadowy scene around me, I could distinguish nothing beyond the dark  masses of rock that forms the channel through which the waters of the  Montmorenci rush into the St. Laurence.    At ten last night, August the 15th, the lights of the city of Quebec  were seen gleaming through the distance like a coronet of stars above  the waters. At half-past ten we dropped anchor opposite the fort, and I  fell asleep dreaming of the various scenes through which I had passed.  Again I was destined to be disappointed in my expectations of going on  shore. The visiting surgeon advised my husband and me by no means to  land, as the mortality that still raged in the town made it very  hazardous. He gave a melancholy description of the place. \"Desolation  and woe and great mourning--Rachel weeping for her children because they  are not,\" are words that may well be applied to this city of the  pestilence.    [Illustration - Falls of Montmorenci]    Nothing can be more imposing than the situation of Quebec, built on the  sides and summit of a magnificent rock, on the highest point of which  (Cape Diamond) stands the fortress overlooking the river, and commanding  a most superb view of the surrounding scenes. I did, indeed, regret the  loss of this noble"]]]
