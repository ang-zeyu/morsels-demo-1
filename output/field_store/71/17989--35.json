Can he recognize them with sufficient  distinctness to seize upon their manifestations while music is  sounding? Then memory shall come to the aid of discrimination, and he  shall be able to appreciate enough of design to point the way to a  true and lofty appreciation of the beautiful in music. The value of  memory is for obvious reasons very great in musical enjoyment. The  picture remains upon the wall, the book upon the library shelf. If we  have failed to grasp a detail at the first glance or reading, we need  but turn again to the picture or open the book anew. We may see the  picture in a changed light, or read the poem in a different mood, but  the outlines, colors, ideas are fixed for frequent and patient  perusal. Music goes out of existence with every performance, and must  be recreated at every hearing.    [Sidenote: _An intermediary necessary._]    Not only that, but in the case of all, so far as some forms are  concerned, and of all who are not practitioners in others, it is  necessary that there shall be an intermediary between the composer and  the listener. The written or printed notes are not music; they are  only signs which indicate to the performer what to do to call tones  into existence such as the composer had combined into an art-work in  his mind. The broadly trained musician can read the symbols; they stir  his imagination, and he hears the music in his imagination as the  composer heard it. But the untaught music-lover alone can get nothing  from the printed page; he must needs wait till some one else shall  again waken for him the        \"Sound of a voice that is still.\"    [Sidenote: _The value of memory._]    This is one of the drawbacks which are bound up in the nature of  music; but it has ample compensation in the unusual pleasure which  memory brings. In the case of the best music, familiarity breeds  ever-growing admiration. New compositions are slowly received; they  make their way to popular appreciation only by repeated performances;  the people like best the songs as well as the symphonies which they  know. The quicker, therefore, that we are in recognizing the melodic,  harmonic, and rhythmic contents of a new composition, and the more apt  our memory in seizing upon them for the operation of the fancy, the  greater shall be our pleasure.    [Sidenote: _Melody, Harmony, and Rhythm._]    [Sidenote: _Comprehensiveness of Melody._]    In simple phrase Melody is a well-ordered series of tones heard  successively; Harmony, a well-ordered series heard simultaneously;  Rhythm, a symmetrical grouping of tonal time units vitalized by  accent. The life-blood of music is Melody, and a complete conception  of the term embodies within itself the essence of both its companions.  A succession of tones without harmonic regulation is not a perfect  element in music; neither is a succession of tones which have harmonic  regulation but are void of rhythm. The beauty and expressiveness,  especially the emotionality, of a musical composition depend upon the  harmonies which either accompany the melody in the form of chords (a  group of melodic intervals sounded simultaneously), or are latent in  the melody itself (harmonic intervals sounded successively). Melody is  Harmony analyzed; Harmony is Melody synthetized.    [Sidenote: _Repetition._]    [Sidenote: _A melody analyzed._]    The fundamental principle of Form is repetition of melodies, which are  to music what ideas are to poetry. Melodies themselves are made by  repetition of smaller fractions called motives (a term borrowed from  the fine arts), phrases, and periods, which derive their individuality  from their rhythmical or intervallic characteristics. Melodies are  not all of the simple kind which the musically illiterate, or the  musically ill-trained, recognize as \"tunes,\" but they all have a  symmetrical organization. The dissection of a simple folk-tune may  serve to make this plain and also indicate to the untrained how a  single feature may be taken as a mark of identification and a  holding-point for the memory. Here is the melody of a Creole song  called sometimes _Pov' piti Lolotte_, sometimes _Pov' piti Momzelle  Zizi_, in the patois of Louisiana and Martinique:    [Music illustration]    [Sidenote: _Motives, phrases, and periods._]    It will be as apparent to the eye of one who cannot read music as it  will to his ear when he hears this melody played, that it is built up  of two groups of notes only. These groups are marked off by the heavy  lines across the staff called bars, whose purpose it is to indicate  rhythmical subdivisions in music. The second, third, fifth, sixth, and  seventh of these groups are repetitions merely of the first group,  which is the germ of the melody, but on different degrees of the  scale; the fourth and eighth groups are identical and are an appendage  hitched to the first group for the purpose of bringing it to a close,  supplying a resting-point craved by man's innate sense of symmetry.  Musicians call such groups cadences. A musical analyst would call each  group a motive, and say that each successive two groups, beginning  with the first, constitute a phrase, each two phrases a period, and  the two periods a melody. We have therefore in this innocent Creole  tune eight motives, four phrases, and two periods; yet its material is  summed up in two groups, one of seven notes, one of five, which only  need to be identified and remembered to enable a listener to recognize  something of the design of a composer if he were to put the melody to  the highest purposes that melody can be put in the art of musical  composition.    [Sidenote: _Repetition in music._]    Repetition is the constructive principle which was employed by the  folk-musician in creating this melody; and repetition is the  fundamental principle in all musical construction. It will suffice for  many merely to be reminded of this to appreciate the fact that while  the exercise of memory is a most necessary activity in listening to  music, it lies in music to make that exercise easy. There is  repetition of motives, phrases, and periods in melody; repetition of  melodies in parts; and repetition of parts in the wholes of the larger  forms.    [Sidenote: _Repetition in poetry._]    The beginnings of poetic forms are also found in repetition; in  primitive poetry it is exemplified in the refrain or burden, in the  highly developed poetry of the Hebrews in parallelism. The Psalmist  wrote:        \"O Lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath,      Neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.\"    [Sidenote: _Key relationship._]    Here is a period of two members, the latter repeating the thought of  the former. A musical analyst might find in it an admirable analogue  for the first period of a simple melody. He would divide it into four  motives: \"Rebuke me not | in thy wrath | neither chasten me | in thy  hot displeasure,\" and point out as intimate a relationship between  them as exists in the Creole tune. The bond of union between the  motives of the melody as well as that in the poetry illustrates a  principle of beauty which is the most important element in musical  design after repetition, which is its necessary vehicle. It is because  this principle guides the repetition of the tone-groups that together  they form a melody that is perfect, satisfying, and reposeful. It is  the principle of key-relationship, to discuss which fully would carry  me farther into musical science than I am permitted to go. Let this  suffice: A harmony is latent in each group, and the sequence of groups  is such a sequence as the experience of ages has demonstrated to be  most agreeable to the ear.    [Sidenote: _The rhythmical stamp._]    [Sidenote: _The principle of Unity._]    In the case of the Creole melody the listener is helped to a quick  appreciation of its form by the distinct physiognomy which rhythm has  stamped upon it; and it is by noting such a characteristic that the  memory can best be aided in its work of identification. It is not  necessary for a listener to follow all the processes of a composer in  order to enjoy his music, but if he cultivates the habit of following  the principal themes through a work of the higher class he will not  only enjoy the pleasures of memory but will frequently get a glimpse  into the composer's purposes which will stimulate his imagination and  mightily increase his enjoyment. There is nothing can guide him more  surely to a recognition of the principle of unity, which makes a  symphony to be an organic whole instead of a group of pieces which are  only externally related. The greatest exemplar of this principle is  Beethoven; and his music is the best in which to study it for the  reason that he so frequently employs material signs for the spiritual  bond. So forcibly has this been impressed upon me at times that I am  almost willing to believe that a keen analytical student of his music  might arrange his greater works into groups of such as were in process  of composition at the same time without reference to his personal  history. Take the principal theme of the C minor Symphony for example:    [Music illustration]    [Sidenote: _A rhythmical motive pursued._]    This simple, but marvellously pregnant, motive is not only the kernel  of the first movement, it is the fundamental thought of the whole  symphony. We hear its persistent beat in the scherzo as well:    [Music illustration]    and also in the last movement:    [Music illustration]    More than this, we find the motive haunting the first movement of the  pianoforte sonata in F minor, op. 57, known as the \"Sonata  Appassionata,\" now gloomily, almost morosely, proclamative in the  bass, now interrogative in the treble:    [Music illustration]    [Sidenote: _Relationships in Beethoven's works._]    [Sidenote: _The C minor Symphony and \"Appassionata\" sonata._]    [Sidenote: _Beethoven's G major Concerto._]    Schindler relates that when once he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17478"],[0,"Great Pictures, As Seen and Described (#4)"],[1,"  wan. For with Botticelli she too, though she holds in her hands the  \"Desire of all nations,\" is one of those who are neither for God nor  for his enemies; and her choice is on her face. The white light on it is  cast up hard and cheerless from below, as when snow lies upon the  ground, and the children look up with surprise at the strange whiteness  of the ceiling. Her trouble is in the very caress of the mysterious  child, whose gaze is always far from her, and who has already that sweet  look of devotion which men have never been able altogether to love, and  which still makes the born saint an object almost of suspicion to his  earthly brethren. Once, indeed, he guides her hand to transcribe in a  book the words of her exaltation, the _Ave_ and the _Magnificat_, and  the _Gaude Maria_, and the young angels, glad to rouse her for a moment  from her dejection, are eager to hold the inkhorn and support the book;  but the pen almost drops from her hand, and the high cold words have no  meaning for her, and her true children are those others, in the midst of  whom, in her rude home, the intolerable honour came to her, with that  look of wistful inquiry on their irregular faces which you see in  startled animals--gipsy children, such as those who, in Apennine  villages, still hold out their long brown arms to beg of you, but on  Sundays become _enfants du choeur_ with their thick black hair nicely  combed and fair white linen on their sunburnt throats.    What is strangest is that he carries this sentiment into classical  subjects, its most complete expression being a picture in the Uffizi, of  Venus rising from the sea, in which the grotesque emblems of the middle  age, and a landscape full of its peculiar feeling, and even its strange  draperies powdered all over in the Gothic manner with a quaint conceit  of daisies, frame a figure that reminds you of the faultless nude  studies of Ingres. At first, perhaps, you are attracted only by a  quaintness of design, which seems to recall all at once whatever you  have read of Florence in the Fifteenth Century; afterwards you may think  that this quaintness must be incongruous with the subject, and that the  colour is cadaverous, or at least cold. And yet the more you come to  understand what imaginative colouring really is, that all colour is no  mere delightful quality of natural things, but a spirit upon them by  which they become expressive to the spirit, the better you will like  this peculiar quality of colour; and you will find that quaint design of  Botticelli's a more direct inlet into the Greek temper than the works of  the Greeks themselves even of the finest period. Of the Greeks as they  really were, of their difference from ourselves, of the aspects of their  outward life, we know far more than Botticelli, or his most learned  contemporaries; but for us, long familiarity has taken off the edge of  the lesson, and we are hardly conscious of what we owe to the Hellenic  spirit. But in pictures like this of Botticelli's you have a record of  the first impression made by it on minds turned back towards it in  almost painful aspiration from a world in which it had been ignored so  long; and in the passion, the energy, the industry of realization, with  which Botticelli carries out his intention, is the exact measure of the  legitimate influence over the human mind of the imaginative system of  which this is the central myth. The light is, indeed, cold--mere sunless  dawn; but a later painter would have cloyed you with sunshine; and you  can see the better for that quietness in the morning air each long  promontory as it slopes down to the water's edge. Men go forth to their  labours until the evening; but she is awake before them, and you might  think that the sorrow in her face was at the thought of the whole long  day of love yet to come. An emblematical figure of the wind blows hard  across the grey water, moving forward the dainty-lipped shell on which  she sails, the sea \"showing his teeth\" as it moves in thin lines of  foam, and sucking in one by one the falling roses, each severe in  outline, plucked off short at the stalk, but embrowned a little, as  Botticelli's flowers always are. Botticelli meant all that imagery to be  altogether pleasurable; and it was partly an incompleteness of  resources, inseparable from the art of that time, that subdued and  chilled it; but his predilection for minor tones counts also; and what  is unmistakable is the sadness with which he has conceived the goddess  of pleasure as the depository of a great power over the lives of men.    I have said that the peculiar character of Botticelli is the result of a  blending in him of a sympathy for humanity in its uncertain condition,  its attractiveness, its investiture at rarer moments in a character of  loveliness and energy, with his consciousness of the shadow upon it of  the great things from which it shrinks, and that this conveys into his  work somewhat more than painting usually attains of the true complexion  of humanity. He paints the story of the goddess of pleasure in other  episodes besides that of her birth from the sea, but never without some  shadow of death in the grey flesh and wan flowers. He paints Madonnas,  but they shrink from the pressure of the divine child, and plead in  unmistakable undertones for a warmer, lower humanity. The same  figure--tradition connects it with Simonetta, the mistress of Giuliano  de' Medici--appears again as Judith returning home across the hill  country when the great deed is over, and the moment of revulsion come,  and the olive branch in her hand is becoming a burthen; as Justice,  sitting on a throne, but with a fixed look of self-hatred which makes  the sword in her hand seem that of a suicide; and again as Veritas in  the allegorical picture of Calumnia, where one may note in passing the  suggestiveness of an accident which identifies the image of Truth with  the person of Venus. We might trace the same sentiment through his  engravings; but his share in them is doubtful, and the object of this  fragment has been attained if I have defined aright the temper in which  he worked.    But, after all, it may be asked, is a painter like Botticelli, a  second-rate painter, a proper subject for general criticism? There are a  few great painters, like Michael Angelo or Leonardo, whose work has  become a force in general culture, partly for this very reason that they  have absorbed into themselves all such workmen as Sandro Botticelli;  and, over and above mere technical or antiquarian criticism, general  criticism may be very well employed in that sort of interpretation which  adjusts the position of these men to general culture, whereas smaller  men can be the proper subjects only of technical or antiquarian  treatment. But, besides those great men, there is a certain number of  artists who have a distinct faculty of their own by which they convey to  us a peculiar quality of pleasure which we cannot get elsewhere, and  these, too, have their place in general culture, and have to be  interpreted to it by those who have felt their charm strongly, and are  often the objects of a special diligence and a consideration wholly  affectionate, just because there is not about them the stress of a great  name and authority. Of this select number Botticelli is one; he has the  freshness, the uncertain and diffident promise which belongs to the  earlier Renaissance itself, and makes it perhaps the most interesting  period in the history of the mind; in studying his work one begins to  understand to how great a place in human culture the art of Italy had  been called.        _Studies in the History of the Renaissance_ (London, 1873).          THE QUEEN OF SHEBA    (_VERONESE_)    JOHN RUSKIN      This picture is at Turin, and is of quite inestimable value. It is hung  high; and the really principal figure--the Solomon, being in the shade,  can hardly be seen, but is painted with Veronese's utmost tenderness, in  the bloom of perfect youth, his hair golden, short, crisply curled. He  is seated high on his lion throne; two elders on each side beneath him,  the whole group forming a tower of solemn shade. I have alluded,  elsewhere, to the principle on which all the best composers act, of  supporting these lofty groups by some vigorous mass of foundation. This  column of noble shade is curiously sustained. A falconer leans forward  from the left-hand side, bearing on his wrist a snow-white falcon, its  wings spread, and brilliantly relieved against the purple robe of one of  the elders. It touches with its wings one of the golden lions of the  throne, on which the light also flashes strongly; thus forming, together  with it, the lion and eagle symbol, which is the type of Christ,  throughout mediaeval work. In order to show the meaning of this symbol,  and that Solomon is typically invested with the Christian royalty, one  of the elders by a bold anachronism, holds a jewel in his hand in the  shape of a cross, with which he (by accident of gesture) points to  Solomon; his other hand is laid on an open book.    [Illustration: THE QUEEN OF SHEBA.          _Veronese._]    The group opposite, of which the Queen forms the centre, is also painted  with Veronese's highest skill; but contains no point of interest bearing  on our present subject, except its connection by a chain of descending  emotion. The Queen is wholly oppressed and subdued; kneeling, and nearly  fainting, she looks up to Solomon with tears in her eyes; he, startled  by fear for her, stoops forward from the throne, opening his right hand,  as if to support her, so as almost to drop the sceptre. At her side her  first maid of honour is kneeling also, but does not care about Solomon;  and is gathering up her dress that it may not be crushed; and looking  back to encourage a negro girl, who, carrying two toy-birds, made of  enamel and jewels, for presentation to the King, is"]]]
