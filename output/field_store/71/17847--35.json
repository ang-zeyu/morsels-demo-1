Note also you  must preserve them in such a pan, as they may lye one by another, and  turn of themselves; and when they have been five or six days in the  syrup, that the syrup grow thin, you may boil it again with a little  Sugar, but put it not to your Plums till they be cold. They must have  three scaldings, and one boiling.        _To dry Plums._    Take three quarters of a pound of Sugar to a pound of black Pear-plums,  or Damsins, slit the Plums in the crest, lay a lay of Sugar with a lay  of Plums, and let them stand all night; if you stone the Plums, fill up  the place with sugar, then boil them gently till they be very tender,  without breaking the skins, take them into an earthen or silver dish,  and boil your syrup afterwards for a gelly, then pour it on your Plums  scalding hot, and let them stand two or three dayes, then let them be  put to the Oven after you draw your bread, so often untill your syrup be  dryed up, and when you think they are almost dry, lay them in a sieve,  and pour some scalding water on them, which will run through the sieve,  and set them in an Oven afterwards to dry.        _To preserve Cherries the best way, bigger than they grow naturally,  &c._    Take a pound of the smallest Cherries, and boil them tender in a pint of  fair water, then strain the liquor from the substance, then take two  pound of good Cherries, and put them into a preserving-pan with a lay of  Cherries, and a lay of sugar: then pour the syrup of the other Cherries  about them, and so let them boil as fast as you can with a quick fire,  that the syrup may boil over them, and when your syrup is thick and of  good colour, then take them up, and let them stand a cooling by  partitions one from another, and being cold you may pot them up.        _To preserve Damsins, red Plums or black._    Take your Plums newly gathered, and take a little more sugar than they  do weigh, then put to it as much water as will cover them; then boil  your syrup a little while, and so let it cool, then put in your Damsins  or Plums, then boil them leasurely in a pot of seething water till they  be tender, then being almost cold pot them up.        _To dry Pippins or Pears._    Take your Pippins, Pears, Apricocks, pare them, and lay them in a broad  earthen pan one by one, and so rowl them in searsed Sugar as you flower  fried fish; put them in an Oven as hot as for manchet, and so take them  out, and turn them as long as the Oven is hot; when the Oven is of a  drying heat, lay them upon a Paper, and dry them on the bottom of a  Sieve; so you may do the least Plum that is.        _To dry Pippins or Pears another way._    Take Pippins or Pears, and lay them in an earthen Pan one by one, and  when they be baked plump and not broken, then take them out, and lay  them upon a Paper, then lay them on a Sieves bottom, and dry them as you  did before.        _To dry Apricocks tender._    Take the ripest of the Apricoks, pare them, put them into a silver or  earthen skillet, and to a pound of Apricocks put three quarters of a  pound of Sugar, set your Apricocks over your fire; stirring them till  they come to a pulp, and set the Sugar in another skillet by boiling it  up to a good height, then take all the Apricocks, and stir them round  till they be well mingled, then let it stand till it be something cold  and thick, then put it into cards, being cut of the fashion of an  Apricock, and laid upon glass plates; fill the Cards half full, then set  them in your stove, but when you find they are so dry that they are  ready to turn, then provide as much of your pulp as you had before, and  so put to every one a stove, when they are turned, (which you must have  laid before) & pour the rest of the Pulp upon them, so set them into  your stove, turning them till they be dry.        _To dry Plums._    Take a pound of Sugar to a pound of Plums, pare them, scald your Plums,  then lay your Plums upon a sieve till the water be drained from them,  boil your Sugar to a Candy height, and then put your Plums in whilst  your syrup is hot, so warm them every morning for a week, then take them  out, and put them into your stove and dry them.        _To dry Apricocks._    Take your Apricocks, pare and stone them, then weigh half a pound of  sugar to a pound of Apricocks, then take half that sugar, and make a  thin syrup, and when it boileth, put in the Apricocks; then scald them  in that syrup; then take them off the fire, and let them stand all night  in that syrup, in the morning take them out of that syrup, and make  another syrup with the other half of the sugar, then put them in, and  preserve them till they look clear; but be sure you do not do them so  much as those you keep preserved without drying; then take them out of  that syrup, and lay them on a piece of Plate till they be cold; then  take a skillet of fair water, and when the water boils take your  Apricocks one after another in a spoon, and dip them in the water first  on one side, and then on the other; not letting them go out of the  spoon: you must do it very quick, then put them on a piece of plate, and  dry them in a Stove, turning them every day; you must be sure that your  Stove or Cupboard where you dry them, the heat of it be renewed three  times a day with a temperate drying heat untill they be something dry,  then afterwards turn once as you see cause.        _Conserves of Violets the Italian manner._    Take the leaves of blue Violets separated from their stalks and greens,  beat them very well in a stone Mortar, with twice their weight of Sugar,  and reserve them for your use in a glass vessel.      _The Vertue._    The heat of Choller it doth mitigate extinguisheth thirst, asswageth the  belly, and helpeth the Throat of hot hurts, sharp droppings and driness,  and procureth rest: It will keep one year.        _Conserves of red Roses the Italian manner._    Take fresh red Roses not quite ripe, beat them in a stone Mortar, mix  them with double their weight of Sugar, and put them in a glass close  stopped, being not full, let them remain before you use them three  months, stirring of them once a day.      _The Vertues._    The Stomach, Heart, and Bowels it cooleth, and hindreth vapours, the  spitting of blood and corruption for the most part (being cold) it  helpeth. It will keep many years.        _Conserve of Borage Flowers after the Italian manner._    Take fresh Borage flowers cleansed well from their heads four ounces,  fine sugar twelve ounces, beat them well together in a stone Mortar, and  keep them in a vessel well placed.    The vertues are the same with Bugloss flowers.        _Conserve of Rosemary flowers after the Italian manner._    Take new Rosemary Flowers one pound, of white sugar one pound; so beat  them together in a Marble Mortar with a wooden Pestle, keep it in a  gallipot, or vessel of earth well glassed, or in one of hard stone. It  may be preserved for one year or two.      _The Vertues._    It comforteth the heart, the stomach, the brain, and all the nervous  part of the Body.        _Conserve of Betony after the Italian way._    Betony new and tender one pound, the best sugar three pound, beat them  very small in a stone Mortar, let the sugar be boiled with two pound of  Betony-water to the consistance of a syrup, at length mix them together  by little and little over a small fire, and make a Conserve, which keep  in a glass.      _The Vertues._    It helpeth the cold pains of the head, purgeth the stomach and womb: it  helpeth stoniness of the Reins, and furthereth Conception.        _Conserve of Sage._    Take new flowers of Sage one pound, sugar one pound; so beat them  together very small in a Marble Mortar, put them in a vessel well  glassed and steeped, set them in the Sun, stir them daily; it will last  one year.      _The Vertues._    It is good in all cold hurts of the brain, it refresheth the Stomach,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15040"],[0,"McGuffey's Fifth Eclectic Reader (#4)"],[1,"X.--Questions which may be answered by yes or no, generally require  the rising, and their answers the falling inflection.    EXAMPLES.    Has he arrived'? Yes'.  Will he return'? No'.  Does the law condemn him'? It does not'.    Exception.--If these questions are repeated emphatically, they take the  falling inflection, according to Rule VII.    EXAMPLES.    Has he arrived'?  Will he return'?  Does the law condemn him'?    REMARK.--When a word or sentence is repeated as a kind of interrogatory  exclamation, the rising inflection is used according to the principles of  this rule.    EXAMPLES.    You ask, who would venture' in such a cause! Who would venture'? Rather  say, who would not' venture all things for such an object!    He is called the friend' of virtue. The friend'! ay! the enthusiastic  lover' the devoted protector' rather.    So, also, when one receives unexpected information he exclaims, Ah'!  indeed'!    REMARK.--In the above examples the words \"venture,\" \"friend,\" \"ah,\" etc.,  may be considered as interrogatory exclamations, because if the sense were  carried out it would be in the form of question; as, \"Do you ask who would  venture'?\" \"Do you say that he is the friend' of virtue?\" \"Is it  possible'?\" and thus they would receive the rising inflection according to  this rule.        RISING AND FALLING INFLECTIONS.    RULE XI.--The different members of a sentence expressing comparison, or  contrast, or negation and affirmation, or where the parts are united by or  used disjunctively, require different inflections; generally the rising  inflection in the first member, and the falling inflection in the second  member. This order is, however, sometimes inverted.    1. Comparison and contrast. This is also called antithesis.    EXAMPLES.    In all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God; by honor', and  dishonor'; by evil' report, and good' report; as deceivers', and yet  true'; as unknown', and yet well' known; as dying', and behold we live';  as chastened', and not killed'; as sorrowful', yet always rejoicing'; as  poor', yet making many rich'; as having nothing', yet possessing all'  things.    Europe was one great battlefield, where the weak struggled for freedom',  and the strong for dominion'. The king was without power', and the nobles  without principle', They were tyrants at home', and robbers abroad'.      2. Negation and affirmation.    EXAMPLES.      He desired not to injure' his friend, but to protect' him.    We desire not your money', but yourselves'.    I did not say a better' soldier, but, an elder'.    If the affirmative clause comes first, the order of the inflections is  inverted.    EXAMPLES.      He desired to protect' his friend, not to injure' him.    We desire yourselves', not your money'.    I said an elder' soldier, not a better'.    The affirmative clause is sometimes understood.      We desire not your money'.    I did not say a better' soldier.    The region beyond the grave is not a solitary' land.      In most negative sentences standing alone, the corresponding affirmative  is understood; hence the following.    REMARK.--Negative sentences, whether alone or connected with an  affirmative clause, generally end with the rising inflection.      If such sentences are repeated emphatically, they take the falling  inflection according to Rule VI.    EXAMPLES.      We do not' desire your money.    I did not' say a. better soldier.    3. Or used disjunctively.      Did he behave properly', or improperly'?      Are they living/, or dead'?      Is he rich', or poor'?      Does God, having made his creatures, take no further' care of them, or    does he preserve and guide them'?    REMARK.--Where or is used conjunctively, this rule does not apply; as,  Will the law of kindness' or of justice' justify such conduct'?        CIRCUMFLEX.    The circumflex is a union of the rising and falling inflections. Properly  speaking, there are two of these, the one called the rising circumflex, in  which the voice slides down and then up; and the other, the falling  circumflex, in which the voice slides upward and then downward on the same  vowel. They may both be denoted by the same mark, thus, (^). The  circumflex is used chiefly to indicate the emphasis of irony, of contrast,  or of hypothesis.    EXAMPLES.    1. Queen. Hamlet, you have your father much offended.     Hamlet. Madam, you have my father much offended.    2. They offer us their protec'tion. Yes', such protection as vultures give     to lambs, covering and devouring them.    3. I knew when seven justices could not make up a quarrel; but when the  parties met themselves, one of them thought but of an if; as, If you said  so, then I said so; O ho! did you say so! So they shook hands and were  sworn brothers.    REMARKS.--In the first example, the emphasis is that of contrast. The  queen had poisoned her husband, of which she incorrectly supposed her son  ignorant, and she blames him for treating his father-in-law with  disrespect. In his reply, Hamlet contrasts her deep crime with his own  slight offense, and the circumflex upon \"you\" becomes proper.    In the second example the emphasis is ironical. The Spaniards pretended  that they would protect the Peruvians if they would submit to them,  whereas it was evident that they merely desired to plunder and destroy  them. Thus their protection is ironically called \"such protection as  vultures give to lambs,\" etc.    In the third example, the word \"so\" is used hypothetically; that is, it  implies a condition or supposition. It will be observed that the rising  circumflex is used in the first \"so,\" and the falling, in the second,  because the first \"so\" must end with the rising inflection and the second  with the falling inflection, according to previous rules.        MONOTONE.    When no word in a sentence receives an inflection, it is said to be read  in a monotone; that is, in nearly the same tone throughout. This  uniformity of tone is occa-sionally adopted, and is fitted to express  solemnity or sublimity of idea, and sometimes intensity of feeling. It is  used, also, when the whole sentence or phrase is emphatic. In books of  elocution, when it is marked at all, it is generally marked thus (---), as  in the lines following.    EXAMPLES.    Hence! loathed melancholy!  Where brooding darkness spreads her jealous wings,  And the night raven sings;  There, under ebon shades and low-browed rocks,  As ragged as thy locks,  In deep Cimmerian darkness ever dwell.        IV. ACCENT.    In every word which contains more than one syllable, one of the syllables  is pronounced with a somewhat greater stress of voice than the others.  This syllable is said to be accented. The accented syllable is  distinguished by this mark ('), the same which is used in inflections.    EXAMPLES.          Love'ly,      re-turn',      re-mem'ber,        Con'stant,    re-main',      a-sun'der,        Mem'ber,      a-bide',       a-ban'don,        Win'dow,      a-tone',       rec-ol-lect',        Ban'ner,      a-lone',       re-em-bark',    REMARK.--In most cases custom is the only guide for placing the accent on  one syllable rather than another. Sometimes, however, the same word is  differently accented in order to mark its different meanings.    EXAMPLES.    Con'jure, to practice enchantments.     Con-jure', to entreat.  Gal'lant, brave.                        Gal-lant', a gay fellow.  Au'gust, a month.                       Au-gust', grand.    REMARK.--A number of words used sometimes as one part of speech, and  sometimes as another, vary their accents irregularly.    EXAMPLES.    Pres'ent, noun.     Pres'ent, adjective.       Pre-sent', verb.  Com'pact, noun.     Com-pact', adjective.      Com-pact', verb.    In words of more than two syllables there is often a second accent given,  but more slight than the principal one, and this is called the secondary  accent; as, car'a-van'', rep''ar-tee', where the principal accent is  marked (') and the secondary (''); so, also, this accent is obvious in  nav''-i-ga'tion, com''pre-hen'sion, plau''si-bil'i-ty, etc. The whole  subject, however, properly belongs to dictionaries and spelling books.        V. EMPHASIS.    A word is said to be emphasized when it is uttered with a greater stress  of voice than the other words with which it is connected.    REMARK 1.--The object of emphasis is to attract particular attention to  the word upon which it is placed, indicating that the idea to be conveyed  depends very much upon that word. This object, as just stated, is  generally accomplished by increasing the force of utterance, but  sometimes, also, by a change in the inflection, by the use of the  monotone, by pause, or by uttering the words in a very low key. Emphatic  words are often denoted by italics, and a still stronger emphasis by SMALL  CAPITALS or CAPITALS, according to the degree of emphasis desired.    REMARK 2.--Emphasis constitutes the most important feature in reading and  speaking, and, properly applied, gives life and character to language.  Accent, inflection, and indeed everything yields to emphasis.    REMARK 3.--In the following examples it will be seen that accent is  governed by it.    EXAMPLES.      What is done cannot be undone.    There is a difference between giving and forgiving.    He that descended is the same that ascended.    Some appear to make very little difference between decency and indecency,  morality and immorality, religion and irreligion.    REMARK 4.--There is no better illustration of the nature and importance of  emphasis than the following examples. It will he observed that the meaning  and proper answer of the question vary with each change of the emphasis.    EXAMPLES.    QUESTIONS.                               ANSWERS.  ---------                                --------  Did you walk into the city yesterday?    No, my brother went.    Did you walk into the city yesterday?    No, I rode.    Did you walk into the "]]]
