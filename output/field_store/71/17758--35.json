It is the highest and most exalted passion of which the human      breast is capable. The sight of a beautiful youth awakens      astonishment in the lover, and opens the door of his heart to the      delight which the contemplation of this loveliness affords. Love      takes possession of him so completely that all his thought and      feeling goes out in it. If he finds himself in the presence of      the beloved, he rests absorbed in gazing on him. Absent, he      thinks of nought but him. If the beloved unexpectedly appears, he      falls into confusion, changes color, turns alternately pale and      red. His heart beats faster and impedes his breathing. He has      ears and eyes only for the beloved. He shuns touching him with      the hand, kisses him only on the forehead, sings his praise in      verse, a woman's never.\" One of these love-poems of an Albanian      Gege runs as follows: \"The sun, when it rises in the morning, is      like you, boy, when you are near me. When your dark eye turns      upon me, it drives my reason from my head.\"        It should be added that Prof. Weigand, who knew the Albanians      well, assured Bethe (_Rheinisches Museum fuer Philologie_, 1907,      p. 475) that the relations described by Hahn are really sexual,      although tempered by idealism. A German scholar who travelled in      Albania some years ago, also, assured Naecke (_Jahrbuch fuer      sexuelle Zwischenstufen_, vol. ix, 1908, p. 327) that he could      fully confirm Hahn's statements, and that, though it was      difficult to speak positively, he doubted whether these      relationships were purely ideal. While most prevalent among the      Moslems, they are also found among the Christians, and receive      the blessing of the priest in church. Jealousy is frequently      aroused, the same writer remarks, and even murder may be      committed on account of a boy.        It may be mentioned here that among the Tschuktsches,      Kamschatdals, and allied peoples (according to a Russian      anthropological journal quoted in _Sexual-Probleme_, January,      1913, p. 41) there are homosexual marriages among the men, and      occasionally among the women, ritually consecrated and openly      recognized.    The Albanians, it is possible, belonged to the same stock which produced  the Dorian Greeks, and the most important and the most thoroughly known  case of socially recognized homosexuality is that of Greece during its  period of highest military as well as ethical and intellectual vigor. In  this case, as in those already mentioned, the homosexual tendency was  frequently regarded as having beneficial results, which caused it to be  condoned, if not, indeed, fostered as a virtue. Plutarch repeated the old  Greek statement that the Beotians, the Lacedemonians, and the Cretans were  the most warlike stocks because they were the strongest in love; an army  composed of loving homosexual couples, it was held, would be invincible.  It appears that the Dorians introduced _paiderastia_, as the Greek form of  homosexuality is termed, into Greece; they were the latest invaders, a  vigorous mountain race from the northwest (the region including what is  now Albania) who spread over the whole land, the islands, and Asia Minor,  becoming the ruling race. Homosexuality was, of course, known before they  came, but they made it honorable. Homer never mentions it, and it was not  known as legitimate to the AEolians or the Ionians. Bethe, who has written  a valuable study of Dorian _paiderastia_, states that the Dorians admitted  a kind of homosexual marriage, and even had a kind of boy-marriage by  capture, the scattered vestiges of this practice indicating, Bethe  believes, that it was a general custom among the Dorians before the  invasion of Greece. Such unions even received a kind of religions  consecration. It was, moreover, shameful for a noble youth in Crete to  have no lover; it spoke ill for his character. By _paiderastia_ a man  propagated his virtues, as it were, in the youth he loved, implanting them  by the act of intercourse.    In its later Greek phases _paiderastia_ was associated less with war than  with athletics; it was refined and intellectualized by poetry and  philosophy. It cannot be doubted that both AEschylus and Sophocles  cultivated boy-love, while its idealized presentation in the dialogues of  Plato has caused it to be almost identified with his name; thus in the  early _Charmides_ we have an attractive account of the youth who gives his  name to the dialogue and the emotions he excites are described. But even  in the early dialogues Plato only conditionally approved of the sexual  side of _paiderastia_ and he condemned it altogether in the final  _Laws_.[21]        The early stages of Greek _paiderastia_ are very interestingly      studied by Bethe, \"Die Dorische Knabenliebe,\" _Rheinisches Museum      fuer Philologie_, 1907. J.A. Symonds's essay on the later aspects      of _paiderastia_, especially as reflected in Greek literature, _A      Problem in Greek Ethics_, is contained in the early German      edition of the present study, but (though privately printed in      1883 by the author in an edition of twelve copies and since      pirated in another private edition) it has not yet been published      in English. _Paiderastia_ in Greek poetry has also been studied      by Paul Brandt, _Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen_, vols.      viii and ix (1906 and 1907), and by Otto Knapp      (_Anthropophyteia_, vol. iii, pp. 254-260) who seeks to      demonstrate the sensual side of _paiderastia_. On the other hand,      Licht, working on somewhat the same lines as Bethe (_Zeitschrift      fuer Sexualwissenschaft_, August, 1908), deals with the ethical      element in _paiderastia_, points out its beneficial moral      influence, and argues that it was largely on this ground that it      was counted sacred. Licht has also published a learned study of      _paiderastia_ in Attic comedy (_Anthropophyteia_, vol. vii,      1910), and remarks that \"without _paiderastia_ Greek comedy is      unthinkable.\" _Paiderastia_ in the Greek anthology has been fully      explored by P. Stephanus (_Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen_,      vol. ix, 1908, p. 213). Kiefer, who has studied Socrates in      relation to homosexuality (O. Kiefer, \"Socrates und die      Homosexualitaet,\" _Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen_, vol. ix,      1908), concludes that he was bisexual but that his sexual      impulses had been sublimated. It may be added that many results      of recent investigation concerning _paiderastia_ are summarized      by Hirschfeld, _Die Homosexualitaet_, pp. 747-788, and by Edward      Carpenter, _Intermediate Types Among Primitive Folk_, 1914, part      ii; see also Bloch, _Die Prostitution_, vol. i, p. 232 et seq.,      and _Der Ursprung der Syphilis_, vol. ii, p. 564.    It would appear that almost the only indications outside Greece of  _paiderastic_ homosexuality showing a high degree of tenderness and  esthetic feeling are to be found in Persian and Arabian literature, after  the time of the Abbasids, although this practice was forbidden by the  Koran.[22]    In Constantinople, as Naecke was informed by German inverts living in that  city, homosexuality is widespread, most cultivated Turks being capable of  relations with boys as well as with women, though very few are exclusively  homosexual, so that their attitude would seem to be largely due to custom  and tradition. Adult males rarely have homosexual relations together; one  of the couple is usually a boy of 12 to 18 years, and this condition of  things among the refined classes is said to resemble ancient Greek  _paiderastia_. But ordinary homosexual prostitution is prevalent; it is  especially recognized in the baths which abound in Constantinople and are  often open all night. The attendants at these baths are youths who  scarcely need an invitation to induce them to gratify the client in this  respect, the gratification usually consisting in masturbation, mutual or  one-sided, as desired. The practice, though little spoken of, is carried  on almost openly, and blackmailing is said to be unknown.[23] In the New  Turkey, however, it is stated by Adler Bey that homosexual prostitution  has almost disappeared.[24]    There is abundant evidence to show that homosexual practices exist and  have long existed in most parts of the world outside Europe, when  subserving no obvious social or moral end. How far they are associated  with congenital inversion is usually very doubtful. In China, for  instance, it seems that there are special houses devoted to male  prostitution, though less numerous than the houses devoted to females, for  homosexuality cannot be considered common in China (its prevalence among  Chinese abroad being due to the absence of women) and it is chiefly found  in the north.[25] When a rich man gives a feast he sends for women to  cheer the repast by music and song, and for boys to serve at table and to  entertain the guests by their lively conversation. The boys have been  carefully brought up for this occupation, receiving an excellent  education, and their mental qualities are even more highly valued than  their physical attractiveness. The women are less carefully brought up and  less esteemed. After the meal the lads usually return home with a  considerable fee. What further occurs the Chinese say little about. It  seems that real and deep affection is often born of these relations, at  first platonic, but in the end becoming physical, not a matter for great  concern in the eyes of the Chinese. In the Chinese novels, often of a very  literary character, devoted to masculine love, it seems that all the  preliminaries and transports of normal love are to be found, while  physical union may terminate the scene. In China,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13612"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 3 (#4)"],[1,"stimulus has been      removed.    The experience of veterinary surgeons also shows that the sexual impulse  tends to persist in animals after castration. Thus the ox and the gelding  make frequent efforts to copulate with females in heat. In some cases, at  all events in the case of the horse, castrated animals remain potent, and  are even abnormally ardent, although impregnation cannot, of course,  result.[8]    The results obtained by scientific experiment and veterinary experience on  the lower animals are confirmed by observation of various groups of  phenomena in the human species. There can be no doubt that castrated men  may still possess sexual impulses. This has been noted by observers in  various countries in which eunuchs are made and employed.[9]        It is important to remember that there are different degrees of      castration, for in current language these are seldom      distinguished. The Romans recognized four different degrees: 1.      True _castrati_, from whom both the testicles and the penis had      been removed. 2. _Spadones_, from whom the testicles only had      been removed; this was the most common practice. 3. _Thlibiae_, in      whom the testicles had not been removed, but destroyed by      crushing; this practice is referred to by Hippocrates. 4.      _Thlasiae_, in whom the spermatic cord had simply been cut.      Millant, from whose Paris thesis (_Castration Criminelle et      Maniaque_, 1902) I take these definitions, points out that it was      recognized that _spadones_ remained apt for coitus if the      operation was performed after puberty, a fact appreciated by many      Roman ladies, _ad seouras libidinationes_, as St. Jerome      remarked, while Martial (lib. iv) said of a Roman lady who sought      eunuchs: \"Vult futui Gallia, non parere.\" (See also Millant, _Les      Eunuques a Travers les Ages_, 1909, and articles by Lipa Bey and      Zambaco, _Sexual-Probleme_, Oct. and Dec., 1911.)    In China, Matignon, formerly physician to the French legation in Pekin,  tells us that eunuchs are by no means without sexual feeling, that they  seek the company of women and, he believes, gratify their sexual desires  by such methods as are left open to them, for the sexual organs are  entirely removed. It would seem probable that, the earlier the age at  which the operation is performed, the less marked are the sexual desires,  for Matignon mentions that boys castrated before the age of 10 are  regarded by the Chinese as peculiarly virginal and pure.[10] At  Constantinople, where the eunuchs are of negro race, castration is usually  complete and performed before puberty, in order to abolish sexual potency  and desire as far as possible. Even when castration is effected in  infancy, sexual desire is not necessarily rendered impossible. Thus Marie  has recorded the case of an insane Egyptian eunuch whose penis and scrotum  were removed in infancy; yet, he had frequent and intense sexual desire  with ejaculation of mucus and believed that an invisible princess touched  him and aroused voluptuous sensations. Although the body had a feminine  appearance, the prostate was normal and the vesiculae seminales not  atrophied.[11] It may be added that Lancaster[12] quotes the following  remark, made by a resident for many years in the land, concerning Nubian  eunuchs: \"As far as I can judge, sex feeling exists unmodified by absence  of the sexual organs. The eunuch differs from the man not in the absence  of sexual passion, but only in the fact that he cannot fully gratify it.  As far as he can approach a gratification of it he does so.\" In this  connection it may be noted that (as quoted by Moll) Jaeger attributes the  preference of some women--noted in ancient Rome and in the East--for  castrated men as due not only to the freedom from risk of impregnation in  such intercourse, but also to the longer duration of erection in the  castrated.    When castration is performed without removal of the penis it is said that  potency remains for at least ten years afterward, and Disselhorst, who in  his _Die accessorischen Geschlechtsdruesen der Wirbelthiere_ takes the same  view as has been here adopted, mentions that, according to Pelikan (_Das  Skopzentum in Ruessland_), those castrated at puberty are fit for coitus  long afterward. When castration is performed for surgical reasons at a  later age it is still less likely to affect potency or to change the  sexual feelings.[13] Guinard concludes that the sexual impulse after  castration is relatively more persistent in man than in the lower animals,  and is sometimes even heightened, being probably more dependent on  external stimuli.[14]    Except in the East, castration is more often performed on women than on  men, and then the evidence as to the influence of the removal of the  ovaries on the sexual emotions shows varying results. It has been found  that after castration sexual desire and sexual pleasure in coitus may  either remain the same, be diminished or extinguished, or be increased. By  some the diminution has been attributed to autosuggestion, the woman being  convinced that she can no longer be like other women; the augmentation of  desire and pleasure has been supposed to be due to the removal of the  dread of impregnation. We have, of course, to take into account individual  peculiarities, method of life, and the state of the health.        In France Jayle (\"Effets physiologiques de la Castration chez la      Femme,\" _Revue de Gynecologie_, 1897, pp. 403-57) found that,      among 33 patients in whom ovariotomy had been performed, in 18      sexual desire remained the same, in 3 it was diminished, in 8      abolished, in 3 increased; while pleasure in coitus remained the      same in 17, was diminished in 1, abolished in 4, and increased in      5, in 6 cases sexual intercourse was very painful. In two other      groups of cases--one in which both ovaries and uterus were      removed and another in which the uterus alone was removed--the      results were not notably different.        In Germany Glaeveke (_Archiv fuer Gynaekologie_, Bd. xxxv, 1889)      found that desire remained in 6 cases, was diminished in 10, and      disappeared in 11, while pleasure in intercourse remained in 8,      was diminished in 10, and was lost in 8. Pfister, again (_Archiv      fuer Gynaekologie_, Bd. lvi, 1898), examined this point in 99      castrated women; he remarks that sexual desire and sexual      pleasure in intercourse were usually associated, and found the      former unchanged in 19 cases, decreased in 24, lost in 35, never      present in 21, while the latter was unchanged in 18 cases and      diminished or lost in 60. Keppler (International Medical      Congress, Berlin, 1890) found that among 46 castrated women      sexual feeling was in no case abolished. Adler also, who      discusses this question (_Die Mangelhafte Geschlechtsempfindung      des Weibes_, 1904, p. 75 et seq.), criticises Glaeveke's      statements and concludes that there is no strict relation between      the sexual organs and the sexual feelings. Kisch, who has known      several cases in which the feelings remained the same as before      the operation, brings together (_The Sexual Life of Women_)      varying opinions of numerous authors regarding the effects of      removal of the ovaries on the sexual appetite.        In America Bloom (as quoted in _Medical Standard_, 1896, p. 121)      found that in none of the cases of women investigated, in which      ooephorectomy had been performed before the age of 33, was the      sexual appetite entirely lost; in most of them it had not      materially diminished and in a few it was intensified. There      was, however, a general consensus of opinion that the normal      vaginal secretion during coitus was greatly lessened. In the      cases of women over 33, including also hysterectomies, a gradual      lessening of sexual feeling and desire was found to occur most      generally. Dr. Isabel Davenport records 2 cases (reported in      _Medical Standard_, 1895, p. 346) of women between 30 and 35      years of age whose erotic tendencies were extreme; the ovaries      and tubes were removed, in one case for disease, in the other      with a view of removing the sexual tendencies; in neither case      was there any change. Lapthorn Smith (_Medical Record_, vol.      xlviii) has reported the case of an unmarried woman of 24 whose      ovaries and tubes had been removed seven years previously for      pain and enlargement, and the periods had disappeared for six      years; she had had experience of sexual intercourse, and declared      that she had never felt such extreme sexual excitement and      pleasure as during coitus at the end of this time.        In England Lawson Tait and Bantock (_British Medical Journal_,      October 14, 1899, p. 975) have noted that sexual passion seems      sometimes to be increased even after the removal of ovaries,      tubes, and uterus. Lawson Tait also stated (_British      Gynaecological Journal_, Feb., 1887, p. 534) that after systematic      and extensive inquiry he had not found a single instance in      which, provided that sexual appetite existed before the removal      of the appendages, it was abolished by that operation. A Medical      Inquiry Committee appointed by the Liverpool Medical Institute      (ibid., p. 617) had previously reported that a considerable      number of patients stated that they had suffered a distinct loss      of sexual feeling. Lawson Tait, however, throws doubts on the      reliability of the Committee's results, which were based on the      statements of unintelligent hospital patients.        I may quote the following remarks from a communication sent to me      by an experienced physician in Australia: \"No rule can be laid      down in cases in which both ovaries have been extirpated. Some      women say that, though formerly passionate, they "]]]
