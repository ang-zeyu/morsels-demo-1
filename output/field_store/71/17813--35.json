Neither species, however, is recorded as having occurred in any of the  neighbouring parts of France.      4. ICELAND FALCON. _Falco islandus_, Gmelin.--An Iceland Falcon was  killed on the little Island of Herm on the 11th of April, 1876, where it  had been seen about for some time, by the gamekeeper. It had another  similar bird in company with it, and probably the pair were living very  well upon the game-birds which had been imported and preserved in that  island, as the keeper saw them kill more than one Pheasant before he  shot this bird. The other fortunately escaped. The bird which was killed  is now in my possession, and is a fully adult Iceland Falcon, and Mr.  Couch, the bird-stuffer who skinned it, informed me a male by  dissection. Though to a certain extent I have profited by it, so far as  to have the only Channel Island example of the Iceland Falcon in my  possession, I cannot help regretting that this bird was killed by the  keeper, as it seems to me not impossible that the two birds being  together in the island so late as the 11th of April, and certainly one,  probably both, being adult, and there being plenty of food for them,  might, if unmolested, have bred in the island. Perhaps, however, this is  too much to have expected so far from their proper home. It would,  however, have been interesting to know how late the birds would have  remained before returning to their northern home; but the  breeding-season for the Pheasants was beginning, and this was enough for  the keeper, as he had actually seen two or three Pheasants--some  hens--killed before he shot the Falcon. As these Falcons can only be  considered very rare accidental visitants to the Islands, it may be  interesting to some of my readers to mention that they may distinguish  them easily by colour, the Greenland, _Falco candicans_, being always  the most white, and the Norway bird--the Gyr Falcon of falconers--being  the darkest, the Iceland Falcon (the present species) being  intermediate. This is generally a good guide at all ages, but  occasionally there may be some difficulty in distinguishing young birds,  especially as between the Iceland and the Norway Falcon. In a doubtful  case in the Channel Islands, however, it would always be safer to  consider the bird an Iceland rather than a Norway Falcon.      5. PEREGRINE FALCON. _Falco peregrinus_, Tunstall. French, \"Faucon  pelerin.\"--The Peregrine can now, I think, only be considered an  autumnal visitant to the Islands, though, if not shot or otherwise  destroyed, it would, no doubt, remain throughout the winter, and might  perhaps have been resident, as Mr. MacCulloch sends me a note of one  killed in Herm in December. All the Channel Island specimens I have seen  have been young birds of the year, and generally killed in October or  November. Adult birds, no doubt, occasionally occur, but they are  comparatively rare, and it certainly does not breed anywhere in the  Islands at present, though I see no reason why it should not have done  so in former times, as there are many places well suited to it, and a  constant supply of sea-birds for food. Mr. MacCulloch also seems to be  of opinion that the Peregrine formerly bred in the Islands, as he says,  speaking, however, of the _Falconidae_ generally, \"There must have been  a time when some of the species were permanent residents, for the high  pyramidal rock south of the little Island of Jethou bears the name of  'La Fauconniere,' evidently denoting that it must have been a favourite  resort of these birds, and there are other rocks with the same name.\"  Certainly the rock here mentioned looks much like a place that would be  selected by the Peregrine for breeding purposes, but that must have been  before the days of excursion steamers once or twice a week to Jethou and  Herm. Occasionally a young Peregrine is made to do duty as a Lanner, and  is recorded in the local papers accordingly (see 'Star' for November  11th, 1876, copying, however, a Jersey paper), but in spite of these  occasional notes there is no satisfactory reason for supposing that the  true Lanner has ever occurred in either of the Islands. The birds,  however, certainly resemble each other to a certain extent, but the  young Lanner in which state it would be most likely to occur, may always  be distinguished from the young Peregrine by its whiter head, and the  adult has more brown on the head and neck.    The Peregrine is included in Professor Ansted's list, but only marked as  occurring in Guernsey and Sark. There is no specimen at present in the  Museum.      6. HOBBY. _Falco subbuteo_, Linnaeus. French, \"Le Hobereau.\" The Hobby  can only be considered as a rather rare occasional visitant, just  touching the Islands on its southern migration in the autumn, and late  in the autumn, for Mr. MacCulloch informs me that a Hobby was killed in  the Islands, probably Guernsey, in November, 1873, and Mr. Couch,  writing to me on the 10th of November, told me he had had a Hobby  brought to him on the 8th of the same month. Both of these occurrences  seem rather late, but probably the Hobby only touches the Islands for a  very short time on passage, and quite towards the end of the migratory  period. I do not know of any instance of the Hobby having occurred in  the Islands on its northern migration in the spring, or of its remaining  to breed.    It is included in Professor Ansted's list, and only marked as occurring  in Guernsey. There is no specimen in the Museum.      7. MERLIN. _Falco aesalon_,[5] Bris., 1766. French, \"Faucon  Emerillon.\"--The pretty little Merlin is a much more common autumnal  visitant to the Islands than the Hobby, but, like the Peregrine, the  majority of instances are young birds of the year which visit the  Islands on their autumnal migration. When I was in Guernsey in November,  1875, two Merlins, both young birds, were brought in to Mr. Couch's.  Both were shot in the Vale, and I saw a third near Cobo, but did not  shoot it. This also was a young bird. In some years Merlins appear to be  more numerous than in others, and this seems to have been one of the  years in which they were most numerous. Unlike the Hobby, however, the  Merlin does occasionally visit the Islands in the spring, as I saw one  at Mr. Jago's, the bird-stuffer in Guernsey, which had been killed at  Herm in the spring of 1876. This is now in the collection of Mr.  Maxwell, the present owner of Herm. Though the Merlin visits the Islands  both in the spring and autumn, I do not know that there is any instance  of its having remained to breed, neither do I know of an occurrence  during the winter. In the 'Zoologist' for 1875 Mr. Couch, in a  communication dated November 29th, 1874, says--\"A Merlin--a female--was  shot in the Marais, which had struck down a Water Rail a minute or two  before it was shot. After striking down the Rail the Merlin flew into a  tree, about ten yards from which the man who shot it found the Rail  dead. He brought me both birds. The skin of the Rail was broken from the  shoulder to the back of the skull.\"    The more common prey, however, of the Merlin during the time it remains  in the Islands is the Ring Dotterell, which at that time of year is to  be found in large flocks mixed with Purres and Turnstones in all the  low sandy or muddy bays in the Islands.    The Merlin is included in Professor Ansted's list, but only marked as  occurring in Guernsey. There is no specimen in the Museum at present.      8. KESTREL. _Falco tinnunculus_, Linnaeus. French, \"Faucon  cresserelle.\"--The Kestrel is by far the commonest hawk in the Islands,  and is resident throughout the year. I do not think that its numbers are  at all increased during the migratory season. It breeds in the rocky  parts of all the Islands. The Kestrel does not, however, show itself so  frequently in the low parts--even in the autumn--as on the high cliffs,  so probably Ring Dotterell, Purres, and Turnstones do not form so  considerable a part of its food as they do of the Merlin. Skylarks, Rock  and Meadow Pipits, and, in the summer, Wheatears, with a few rats and  mice, seem to afford the principal food of the Kestrel, and to obtain  these it has not to wander far from its breeding haunts.    The Kestrel is quite as common in Alderney and Herm, and even in the  little Island of Jethou, as it is in Guernsey and Sark. One or two  pairs, perhaps more, breed on the before-mentioned rock close to Jethou  \"La Fauconniere,\" though a few pairs of Kestrels breeding there would  scarcely have been sufficient to give it its name.    It is mentioned in Professor Ansted's list, but only marked as  occurring in Guernsey and Sark. There are two specimens, a male and  female, in the Museum.      9. SPARROWHAWK. _Accipiter nisus_, Linnaeus. French, \"L'Epervier,\"  \"Tiercelet.\"--The Sparrowhawk, though a resident species and breeding in  the Islands, is by no means so common as the Kestrel. In fact, it must  certainly be considered rather a rare bird, which perhaps is not to be  wondered at, as it is a more tree-breeding bird and less given to  nesting amongst the rocks than the Kestrel. It does so sometimes,  however, as I saw one fly out of some ivy-covered rocks near Petit Bo  Bay the last time I was in the Islands on the 27th of May, 1878. I am  certain this bird had a nest there, though the place was too  inaccessible to be examined closely. The trees, however, at the Vallon  or Woodlands would be much more likely nesting-places, especially as it  might have an opportunity of appropriating a deserted nest of a Magpie  or a Wood Pigeon, rather a favourite nesting-place of the Sparrowhawk.    Professor Ansted includes the Sparrowhawk in his list, but confines it  to Guernsey and Sark; and probably, as a resident and breeding bird, he  is right as far as my district is concerned, but I should think it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14474"],[0,"The Chemical History of a Candle (#4)"],[1,"down and the smoke goes up. You see, then, that we  have the power in this way of varying the flame in different directions.    There are now some other points that I must bring before you. Many of the  flames you see here vary very much in their shape by the currents of air  blowing around them in different directions; but we can, if we like, make  flames so that they will look like fixtures, and we can photograph  them--indeed, we have to photograph them--so that they become fixed to us,  if we wish to find out everything concerning them. That, however, is not  the only thing I wish to mention. If I take a flame sufficiently large, it  does not keep that homogeneous, that uniform condition of shape, but it  breaks out with a power of life which is quite wonderful. I am about to  use another kind of fuel, but one which is truly and fairly a  representative of the wax or tallow of a candle. I have here a large ball  of cotton, which will serve as a wick. And, now that I have immersed it in  spirit and applied a light to it, in what way does it differ from an  ordinary candle? Why, it differs very much in one respect, that we have a  vivacity and power about it, a beauty and a life entirely different from  the light presented by a candle. You see those fine tongues of flame  rising up. You have the same general disposition of the mass of the flame  from below upwards; but, in addition to that, you have this remarkable  breaking out into tongues which you do not perceive in the case of a  candle. Now, why is this? I must explain it to you, because when you  understand that perfectly, you will be able to follow me better in what I  have to say hereafter. I suppose some here will have made for themselves  the experiment I am going to shew you. Am I right in supposing that  anybody here has played at snapdragon? I do not know a more beautiful  illustration of the philosophy of flame, as to a certain part of its  history, than the game of snapdragon. First, here is the dish; and let me  say, that when you play snapdragon properly, you ought to have the dish  well-warmed; you ought also to have warm plums and warm brandy, which,  however, I have not got. When you have put the spirit into the dish, you  have the cup and the fuel; and are not the raisins acting like the wicks?  I now throw the plums into the dish, and light the spirit, and you see  those beautiful tongues of flame that I refer to. You have the air  creeping in over the edge of the dish forming these tongues. Why? Because,  through the force of the current and the irregularity of the action of the  flame, it cannot flow in one uniform stream. The air flows in so  irregularly that you have what would otherwise be a single image, broken  up into a variety of forms, and each of these little tongues has an  independent existence of its own. Indeed, I might say, you have here a  multitude of independent candles. You must not imagine, because you see  these tongues all at once, that the flame is of this particular shape. A  flame of that shape is never so at any one time. Never is a body of flame,  like that which you just saw rising from the ball, of the shape it appears  to you. It consists of a multitude of different shapes, succeeding each  other so fast that the eye is only able to take cognisance of them all at  once. In former times, I purposely analysed a flame of that general  character, and the diagram shews you the different parts of which it is  composed. They do not occur all at once: it is only because we see these  shapes in such rapid succession, that they seem to us to exist all at one  time.    [Illustration: Fig. 6.]    It is too bad that we have not got further than my game of snapdragon; but  we must not, under any circumstances, keep you beyond your time. It will  be a lesson to me in future to hold you more strictly to the philosophy of  the thing, than to take up your time so much with these illustrations.          LECTURE II.    A CANDLE: BRIGHTNESS OF THE FLAME--AIR NECESSARY FOR  COMBUSTION--PRODUCTION OF WATER.      We were occupied the last time we met in considering the general character  and arrangement as regards the fluid portion of a candle, and the way in  which that fluid got into the place of combustion. You see, when we have a  candle burning fairly in a regular, steady atmosphere, it will have a  shape something like the one shewn in the diagram, and will look pretty  uniform, although very curious in its character. And now, I have to ask  your attention to the means by which we are enabled to ascertain what  happens in any particular part of the flame--why it happens, what it does  in happening, and where, after all, the whole candle goes to: because, as  you know very well, a candle being brought before us and burned,  disappears, if burned properly, without the least trace of dirt in the  candlestick--and this is a very curious circumstance. In order, then, to  examine this candle carefully, I have arranged certain apparatus, the use  of which you will see as I go on. Here is a candle: I am about to put the  end of this glass tube into the middle of the flame--into that part which  old Hooke has represented in the diagram as being rather dark, and which  you can see at any time, if you will look at a candle carefully, without  blowing it about. We will examine this dark part first.    [Illustration: Fig. 7.]    Now, I take this bent glass tube, and introduce one end into that part of  the flame, and you see at once that something is coming from the flame,  out at the other end of the tube; and if I put a flask there, and leave it  for a little while, you will see that something from the middle part of  the flame is gradually drawn out, and goes through the tube and into that  flask, and there behaves very differently from what it does in the open  air. It not only escapes from the end of the tube, but falls down to the  bottom of the flask like a heavy substance, as indeed it is. We find that  this is the wax of the candle made into a vaporous fluid--not a gas. (You  must learn the difference between a gas and a vapour: a gas remains  permanent, a vapour is something that will condense.) If you blow out a  candle, you perceive a very nasty smell, resulting from the condensation  of this vapour. That is very different from what you have outside the  flame; and, in order to make that more clear to you, I am about to produce  and set fire to a larger portion of this vapour--for what we have in the  small way in a candle, to understand thoroughly, we must, as philosophers,  produce in a larger way, if needful, that we may examine the different  parts. And now Mr. Anderson will give me a source of heat, and I am about  to shew you what that vapour is. Here is some wax in a glass flask, and I  am going to make it hot, as the inside of that candle-flame is hot, and  the matter about the wick is hot. [The Lecturer placed some wax in a glass  flask, and heated it over a lamp.] Now, I dare say that is hot enough for  me. You see that the wax I put in it has become fluid, and there is a  little smoke coming from it. We shall very soon have the vapour rising up.  I will make it still hotter, and now we get more of it, so that I can  actually pour the vapour out of the flask into that basin, and set it on  fire there. This, then, is exactly the same kind of vapour as we have in  the middle of the candle; and that you may be sure this is the case, let  us try whether we have not got here, in this flask, a real combustible  vapour out of the middle of the candle. [Taking the flask into which the  tube from the candle proceeded, and introducing a lighted taper.] See how  it burns. Now, this is the vapour from the middle of the candle, produced  by its own heat; and that is one of the first things you have to consider  with respect to the progress of the wax in the course of its combustion,  and as regards the changes it undergoes. I will arrange another tube  carefully in the flame, and I should not wonder if we were able, by a  little care, to get that vapour to pass through the tube to the other  extremity, where we will light it, and obtain absolutely the flame of the  candle at a place distant from it.  Now, look at that. Is not that a very  pretty experiment? Talk about laying on gas--why, we can actually lay on a  candle! And you see from this that there are clearly two different kinds  of action--one the _production_ of the vapour, and the other the  _combustion_ of it--both of which take place in particular parts of the  candle.    [Illustration: Fig. 8]    I shall get no vapour from that part which is already burnt. If I raise  the tube (fig. 7) to the upper part of the flame, so soon as the vapour  has been swept out, what comes away will be no longer combustible: It is  already burned. How burned? Why, burned thus:--In the middle of the flame,  where the wick is, there is this combustible vapour; on the outside of the  flame is the air which we shall find necessary for the burning of the  candle; between the two, intense chemical action takes place, whereby the  air and the fuel act upon each other, and at the very same time that we  obtain light the vapour inside is destroyed. If you examine where the heat  of a candle is, you will find it very curiously arranged. Suppose I take  this candle, and hold a piece of paper close upon the flame, where is the  heat of that flame? Do you not see that it is _not_ in the inside? It is  in a ring, exactly in the place where I told you the chemical action was;  and even in my irregular mode of making the experiment, if there is not  too much disturbance, there will always be a ring. This is a good  experiment for you to make at home. Take a strip of paper, have the air in  the room quiet, and put the piece of paper right across the middle of the  flame (I must not talk while I make the experiment), and you will find  that it is burnt in two places, and that it is not burnt, or"]]]
