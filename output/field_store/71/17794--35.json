[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14168"],[0,"Widdershins (#4)"],[1," remember the days when it was all glow and thrill; and  now I'm forty-four, and it's becoming drudgery. Nobody wants it; I'm  ceasing to want it myself; and if any ordinary sensible man were to ask  me whether I didn't think I was a fool to go on, I think I should agree  that I was.\"    Miss Bengough's comely pink face was serious.    \"But you knew all that, many, many years ago, Paul--and still you chose  it,\" she said in a low voice.    \"Well, and how should I have known?\" he demanded. \"I didn't know. I was  told so. My heart, if you like, told me so, and I thought I knew. Youth  always thinks it knows; then one day it discovers that it is nearly  fifty--\"    \"Forty-four, Paul--\"    \"--forty-four, then--and it finds that the glamour isn't in front,  but behind. Yes, I knew and chose, if _that's_ knowing and  choosing ... but it's a costly choice we're called on to make when  we're young!\"    Miss Bengough's eyes were on the floor. Without moving them she said,  \"You're not regretting it, Paul?\"    \"Am I not?\" he took her up. \"Upon my word, I've lately thought I am! What  _do_ I get in return for it all?\"    \"You know what you get,\" she replied.    He might have known from her tone what else he could have had for the  holding up of a finger--herself. She knew, but could not tell him, that  he could have done no better thing for himself. Had he, any time these  ten years, asked her to marry him, she would have replied quietly,  \"Very well; when?\" He had never thought of it....    \"Yours is the real work,\" she continued quietly. \"Without you we jackals  couldn't exist. You and a few like you hold everything upon your  shoulders.\"    For a minute there was a silence. Then it occurred to Oleron that this  was common vulgar grumbling. It was not his habit. Suddenly he rose and  began to stack cups and plates on the tray.    \"Sorry you catch me like this, Elsie,\" he said, with a little  laugh.... \"No, I'll take them out; then we'll go for a walk, if you  like....\"    He carried out the tray, and then began to show Miss Bengough round his  flat. She made few comments. In the kitchen she asked what an old faded  square of reddish frieze was, that Mrs. Barrett used as a cushion for her  wooden chair.    \"That? I should be glad if you could tell _me_ what it is,\" Oleron  replied as he unfolded the bag and related the story of its finding in  the window-seat.    \"I think I know what it is,\" said Miss Bengough. \"It's been used to wrap  up a harp before putting it into its case.\"    \"By Jove, that's probably just what it was,\" said Oleron. \"I could make  neither head nor tail of it....\"    They finished the tour of the flat, and returned to the sitting-room.    \"And who lives in the rest of the house?\" Miss Bengough asked.    \"I dare say a tramp sleeps in the cellar occasionally. Nobody else.\"    \"Hm!... Well, I'll tell you what I think about it, if you like.\"    \"I should like.\"    \"You'll never work here.\"    \"Oh?\" said Oleron quickly. \"Why not?\"    \"You'll never finish _Romilly_ here. Why, I don't know, but you won't.  I know it. You'll have to leave before you get on with that book.\"    He mused for a moment, and then said:    \"Isn't that a little--prejudiced, Elsie?\"    \"Perfectly ridiculous. As an argument it hasn't a leg to stand on. But  there it is,\" she replied, her mouth once more full of the large-headed  hat pins.    Oleron was reaching down his hat and coat. He laughed.    \"I can only hope you're entirely wrong,\" he said, \"for I shall be in a  serious mess if _Romilly_ isn't out in the autumn.\"      IV    As Oleron sat by his fire that evening, pondering Miss Bengough's  prognostication that difficulties awaited him in his work, he came to the  conclusion that it would have been far better had she kept her beliefs to  herself. No man does a thing better for having his confidence damped at  the outset, and to speak of difficulties is in a sense to make them.  Speech itself becomes a deterrent act, to which other discouragements  accrete until the very event of which warning is given is as likely as  not to come to pass. He heartily confounded her. An influence hostile  to the completion of _Romilly_ had been born.    And in some illogical, dogmatic way women seem to have, she had attached  this antagonistic influence to his new abode. Was ever anything so  absurd! \"You'll never finish _Romilly_ here.\" ... Why not? Was this her  idea of the luxury that saps the springs of action and brings a man down  to indolence and dropping out of the race? The place was well enough--it  was entirely charming, for that matter--but it was not so demoralising as  all that! No; Elsie had missed the mark that time....    He moved his chair to look round the room that smiled, positively  smiled, in the firelight. He too smiled, as if pity was to be  entertained for a maligned apartment. Even that slight lack of robust  colour he had remarked was not noticeable in the soft glow. The drawn  chintz curtains--they had a flowered and trellised pattern, with baskets  and oaten pipes--fell in long quiet folds to the window-seats; the rows  of bindings in old bookcases took the light richly; the last trace of  sallowness had gone with the daylight; and, if the truth must be told,  it had been Elsie herself who had seemed a little out of the picture.    That reflection struck him a little, and presently he returned to it.  Yes, the room had, quite accidentally, done Miss Bengough a disservice  that afternoon. It had, in some subtle but unmistakable way, placed her,  marked a contrast of qualities. Assuming for the sake of argument the  slightly ridiculous proposition that the room in which Oleron sat _was_  characterised by a certain sparsity and lack of vigour; so much the worse  for Miss Bengough; she certainly erred on the side of redundancy and  general muchness. And if one must contrast abstract qualities, Oleron  inclined to the austere in taste....    Yes, here Oleron had made a distinct discovery; he wondered he had not  made it before. He pictured Miss Bengough again as she had appeared  that afternoon--large, showy, moistly pink, with that quality of the  prize bloom exuding, as it were, from her; and instantly she suffered in  his thought. He even recognised now that he had noticed something odd at  the time, and that unconsciously his attitude, even while she had been  there, had been one of criticism. The mechanism of her was a little  obvious; her melting humidity was the result of analysable processes; and  behind her there had seemed to lurk some dim shape emblematic of  mortality. He had never, during the ten years of their intimacy, dreamed  for a moment of asking her to marry him; none the less, he now felt for  the first time a thankfulness that he had not done so....    Then, suddenly and swiftly, his face flamed that he should be thinking  thus of his friend. What! Elsie Bengough, with whom he had spent weeks  and weeks of afternoons--she, the good chum, on whose help he would have  counted had all the rest of the world failed him--she, whose loyalty to  him would not, he knew, swerve as long as there was breath in her--Elsie  to be even in thought dissected thus! He was an ingrate and a cad....    Had she been there in that moment he would have abased himself before  her.    For ten minutes and more he sat, still gazing into the fire, with that  humiliating red fading slowly from his cheeks. All was still within and  without, save for a tiny musical tinkling that came from his kitchen--the  dripping of water from an imperfectly turned-off tap into the vessel  beneath it. Mechanically he began to beat with his finger to the faintly  heard falling of the drops; the tiny regular movement seemed to hasten  that shameful withdrawal from his face. He grew cool once more; and when  he resumed his meditation he was all unconscious that he took it up again  at the same point....    It was not only her florid superfluity of build that he had approached in  the attitude of criticism; he was conscious also of the wide differences  between her mind and his own. He felt no thankfulness that up to a  certain point their natures had ever run companionably side by side; he  was now full of questions beyond that point. Their intellects diverged;  there was no denying it; and, looking back, he was inclined to doubt  whether there had been any real coincidence. True, he had read his  writings to her and she had appeared to speak comprehendingly and to the  point; but what can a man do who, having assumed that another sees as he  does, is suddenly brought up sharp by something that falsifies and  discredits all that has gone before? He doubted all now.... It did for a  moment occur to him that the man who demands of a friend more than can be  given to him is in danger of losing that friend, but he put the thought  aside.    Again he ceased to think, and again moved his finger to the distant  dripping of the tap....    And now (he resumed by-and-by), if these things were true of Elsie  Bengough, they were also true of the creation of which she was the  prototype--Romilly Bishop. And since he could say of Romilly what for  very shame he could not say of Elsie, he gave his thoughts rein. He did  so in that smiling, fire-lighted room, to the accompaniment of the  faintly heard tap.    There was no longer any doubt about it; he hated the central character  of his novel. Even as he had described her physically she overpowered  the senses; she was coarse-fibred, over-coloured, rank. It became true  the moment he formulated his thought; Gulliver had described the  Brobdingnagian maids-of-honour thus: and mentally and spiritually she  corresponded--was unsensitive, limited, common. The model (he closed his  eyes for a moment)--the model stuck out through fifteen vulgar and  blatant chapters to such a pitch that, without seeing the reason, he had  been unable to begin the sixteenth. He marvelled that it had only just  dawned upon him.    And"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14209"],[0,"The Kybalion (#4)"],[1,"are swung backward and forward like  a pendulum. This Principle and that of Polarity have been closely  studied by the Hermetists, and the methods of counteracting,  neutralizing, and USING them form an important part of the Hermetic  Mental Alchemy.    6.  The Principle of Cause and Effect        \"Every Cause has its Effect; every Effect has its Cause;      everything happens according to Law; Chance is but a name      for Law not recognized; there are many planes of causation,      but nothing escapes the Law.\"--The Kybalion.    This Principle embodies the fact that there is a Cause for every Effect;  an Effect from every Cause. It explains that:  \"Everything Happens  according to Law\"; that nothing ever \"merely happens\"; that there is no  such thing as Chance; that while there are various planes of Cause and  Effect, the higher dominating the lower planes, still nothing ever  entirely escapes the Law. The Hermetists understand the art and methods  of rising above the ordinary plane of Cause and Effect, to a certain  degree, and by mentally rising to a higher plane they become Causers  instead of Effects. The masses of people are carried along, obedient to  environment; the wills and desires of others stronger than themselves;  heredity; suggestion; and other outward causes moving them about like  pawns on the Chessboard of Life. But the Masters, rising to the plane  above, dominate their moods, characters, qualities, and powers, as well  as the environment surrounding them, and become Movers instead of pawns.  They help to PLAY THE GAME OF LIFE, instead of being played and moved  about by other wills and environment. They USE the Principle instead of  being its tools. The Masters obey the Causation of the higher planes,  but they help to RULE on their own plane. In this statement there is  condensed a wealth of Hermetic knowledge--let him read who can.    7.  The Principle of Gender        \"Gender is in everything; everything has its Masculine      and Feminine Principles; Gender manifests on all      planes.\"--The Kybalion.    This Principle embodies the truth that there is GENDER manifested in  everything--the Masculine and Feminine Principles ever at work. This is  true not only of the Physical Plane, but of the Mental and even the  Spiritual Planes. On the Physical Plane, the Principle manifests as SEX,  on the higher planes it takes higher forms, but the Principle is ever  the same.  No creation, physical, mental or spiritual, is possible  without this Principle. An understanding of its laws will throw light on  many a subject that has perplexed the minds of men. The Principle of  Gender works ever in the direction of generation, regeneration, and  creation. Everything, and every person, contains the two Elements or  Principles, or this great Principle, within it, him or her. Every Male  thing has the Female Element also; every Female contains also the Male  Principle.  If you would understand the philosophy of Mental and  Spiritual Creation, Generation, and Re-generation, you must understand  and study this Hermetic Principle. It contains the solution of many  mysteries of Life. We caution you that this Principle has no reference  to the many base, pernicious and degrading lustful theories, teachings  and practices, which are taught under fanciful titles, and which are a  prostitution of the great natural principle of Gender. Such base  revivals of the ancient infamous forms of Phallicism tend to ruin mind,  body and soul, and the Hermetic Philosophy has ever sounded the warning  note against these degraded teachings which tend toward lust,  licentiousness, and perversion of Nature's principles. If you seek such  teachings, you must go elsewhere for them--Hermeticism contains nothing  for you along these lines. To the pure, all things are pure; to the  base, all things are base.        CHAPTER III    MENTAL TRANSMUTATION        \"Mind (as well as metals and elements) may be transmuted,      from state to state; degree to degree; condition to condition;      pole to pole; vibration to vibration. True Hermetic Transmutation      is a Mental Art.\"--The Kybalion.    As we have stated, the Hermetists were the original alchemists,  astrologers, and psychologists, Hermes having been the founder of these  schools of thought. From astrology has grown modern astronomy; from  alchemy has grown modern chemistry; from the mystic psychology has grown  the modern psychology of the schools. But it must not be supposed that  the ancients were ignorant of that which the modern schools suppose to  be their exclusive and special property. The records engraved on the  stones of Ancient Egypt show conclusively that the ancients had a full  comprehensive knowledge of astronomy, the very building of the Pyramids  showing the connection between their design and the study of  astronomical science. Nor were they ignorant of Chemistry, for the  fragments of the ancient writings show that they were acquainted with  the chemical properties of things; in fact, the ancient theories  regarding physics are being slowly verified by the latest discoveries of  modern science, notably those relating to the constitution of matter.  Nor must it be supposed that they were ignorant of the so-called modern  discoveries in psychology--on the contrary, the Egyptians were  especially skilled in the science of Psychology, particularly in the  branches that the modern schools ignore, but which, nevertheless, are  being uncovered under the name of \"psychic science\" which is perplexing  the psychologists of to-day, and making them reluctantly admit that  \"there may be something in it after all.\"    The truth is, that beneath the material chemistry, astronomy and  psychology (that is, the psychology in its phase of \"brain-action\") the  ancients possessed a knowledge of transcendental astronomy, called  astrology; of transcendental chemistry, called alchemy; of  transcendental psychology, called mystic psychology. They possessed the  Inner Knowledge as well as the Outer Knowledge, the latter alone being  possessed by modern scientists. Among the many secret branches of  knowledge possessed by the Hermetists, was that known as Mental  Transmutation, which forms the subject matter of this lesson.    \"Transmutation\" is a term usually employed to designate the ancient art  of the transmutation of metals--particularly of the base metals into  gold. The word \"Transmute\" means \"to change from one nature, form, or  substance, into another; to transform\" (Webster). And accordingly,  \"Mental Transmutation\" means the art of changing and transforming mental  states, forms, and conditions, into others. So you may see that Mental  Transmutation is the \"Art of Mental Chemistry,\" if you like the term--a  form of practical Mystic Psychology.    But this means far more than appears on the surface. Transmutation,  Alchemy, or Chemistry on the Mental Plane is important enough in its  effects, to be sure, and if the art stopped there it would still be one  of the most important branches of study known to man. But this is only  the beginning. Let us see why!    The first of the Seven Hermetic Principles is the Principle of  Mentalism, the axiom of which is \"THE ALL is Mind; the Universe is  Mental,\" which means that the Underlying Reality of the Universe is  Mind; and the Universe itself is Mental--that is, \"existing in the Mind  of THE ALL.\" We shall consider this Principle in succeeding lessons, but  let us see the effect of the principle if it be assumed to be true.    If the Universe is Mental in its nature, then Mental Transmutation must  be the art of CHANGING THE CONDITIONS OF THE UNIVERSE, along the lines  of Matter, Force and mind. So you see, therefore, that Mental  Transmutation is really the \"Magic\" of which the ancient; writers had so  much to say in their mystical works, and about which they gave so few  practical instructions. If All be Mental, then the art which enables one  to transmute mental conditions must render the Master the controller of  material conditions as well as those ordinarily called \"mental.\"    As a matter of fact, none but advanced Mental Alchemists have been able  to attain the degree of power necessary to control the grosser physical  conditions, such as the control of the elements of Nature; the  production or cessation of tempests; the production and cessation of  earthquakes and other great physical phenomena. But that such men have  existed, and do exist today, is a matter of earnest belief to all  advanced occultists of all schools. That the Masters exist, and have  these powers, the best teachers assure their students, having had  experiences which justify them in such belief and statements. These  Masters do not make public exhibitions of their powers, but seek  seclusion from the crowds of men, in order to better work their may  along the Path of Attainment. We mention their existence, at this point,  merely to call your attention to the fact that their power is entirely  Mental, and operates along the lines of the higher Mental Transmutation,  under the Hermetic Principle of Mentalism.        \"The Universe is Mental\"--The Kybalion.    But students and Hermetists of lesser degree than Masters--the Initiates  and Teachers--are able to freely work along the Mental Plane, in Mental  Transmutation. In fact all that we call \"psychic phenomena,\"; \"mental  influence\"; \"mental science\"; \"new-thought phenomena,\" etc., operates  along the same general lines, for there is but one principle involved,  no matter by what name the phenomena be called.    The student and practitioner of Mental Transmutation works among the  Mental Plane, transmuting mental conditions, states, etc., into others,  according to various formulas, more or less efficacious. The various  \"treatments,\" \"affirmations,\" \"denials\" etc., of the schools of mental  science are but formulas, often quite imperfect and unscientific, of The  Hermetic Art. The majority of"]]]
