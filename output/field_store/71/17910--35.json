Who can foresee       what may take place in the Pacific in the days to come, days not so       distant as some believe, but days, at any rate, for which all       European powers with Far Eastern interests ought to steadily       prepare?         \"Look at the accomplished rise of Japan. Think of a possible       national awakening in China, and then judge of the vast problems of       the Pacific. Only those powers which have great navies will be       listened to with respect when the future of the Pacific comes to be       solved, and if for that reason only Germany must have a powerful       fleet. It may even be that England herself will be glad that       Germany has a fleet when they speak together in the great debates       of the future.\"    The interviewer concludes:         \"The Emperor spoke with all that earnestness which marks his manner       when speaking on deeply pondered subjects. I ask my       fellow-countrymen who value the cause of peace to weigh what I have       written and revise, if necessary, their estimate of the Kaiser and       his friendship for England by his Majesty's own words. If they had       enjoyed the privilege of hearing them spoken they would no longer       doubt either his Majesty's firm desire to live on the best of terms       with England or his growing impatience at the persistent mistrust       with which his offer of friendship is too often received.\"    The Consequences.    On Nov. 17 following Prince von Buelow met the Kaiser at Kiel, taking  with him evidence of the feeling in Germany regarding the Emperor's  published interview and setting forth:         First, that the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Bundesrat, or       Federal Council, is firm in the opinion formulated at the meeting       held yesterday that it would be wiser for the Emperor not to       express views affecting the relations of the empire with other       countries except through his responsible Ministers. This       expression, derives weight from the fact that the Governments of       Bavaria, Wuerttemberg, and Saxony were represented on the committee.         Second, that the entire Reichstag assented to the declarations made       by the speakers on Tuesday that the Emperor had exceeded his       constitutional prerogatives in private discussion with foreigners       concerning Germany's attitude on controverted questions.         Third, that the feeling of the people at large on this matter was       accurately indicated by the press of the country.    The Kaiser's reply was published on the same date in the Reichsanzeiger,  in the form of a communication, which read:         During today's audience granted to the Imperial Chancellor, his       Majesty, the Emperor and King, listened for several hours to a       report by Prince von Buelow. The Imperial Chancellor described the       feeling and its causes among the German people in connection with       the article published in The Daily Telegraph. He also explained the       position he had taken during the course of the debates and       interpellations on this subject in the Reichstag. His Majesty the       Emperor received the statements and explanations with great       earnestness, and then expressed his will as follows:         \"Heedless of the exaggerations of public criticism, which are       regarded by him as incorrect, his Majesty perceives that his       principal imperial task is to insure the stability of the policies       of the empire, under the guardianship of constitutional       responsibilities. In conformity therewith, his Majesty the Emperor       approves the Chancellor's utterances in the Reichstag, and assures       Prince von Buelow of his continued confidence.\"             *       *       *       *       *          WILHELM II.'S LETTER TO LORD TWEEDMOUTH.    Published by The Morning Post of London, Oct. 30, 1914.      The subjoined letter written to the late Lord Tweedmouth by the German  Emperor is made public for the first time. It is a literal transcript of  the original document in which occur a few slight errors in spelling.  The existence of the document was first made known to the public by the  military correspondent of The Times, who published a letter on the  subject on March 6, 1908, but its contents were not divulged.    The significance of the letter can be understood only in the light of  the naval and political situation six years ago. During the preceding  year, 1907, The Hague Conference, ostensibly convened in the interests  of international peace, had resolved itself into a committee to  determine how to diminish the severities of war. There was a section of  opinion in this country which was persuaded that the only method of  seeking peace was to reduce the navy and army. At the same time the  Imperial German Navy was making swift and steady progress, and its  menace to British supremacy aroused considerable alarm in this country.  Although the British Navy held superiority over the German Navy in ships  not of the dreadnought type, the balance in dreadnoughts was virtually  even.    Dreadnought Supremacy.    It was stated in Parliament that in the year 1916 Germany, according to  her naval law, would have thirty-six dreadnoughts, a number which would  involve the building by this country of forty-four such vessels in the  same period, toward which the Government was only providing two in the  current year. It was also stated that in the year 1911 Germany would  possess thirteen dreadnoughts and Great Britain only twelve, which  statement was founded upon reasonable assumptions. Could Germany reckon  upon the continuance of such a relative position, the advantage to her  would be very great.    It was at this critical moment that the German Emperor indited his  letter to the First Lord of the Admiralty, which is printed below. When  the fact became known there was a good deal of public feeling aroused  both in this country and abroad. Lord Tweedmouth stated that the letter  was a private letter and purely personal. Prince von Buelow informed the  Reichstag that the letter was of both a private and political character,  adding some remarks concerning the \"purely defensive character of our  naval programme which,\" said the Chancellor, \"cannot be emphasized too  frequently.\"    The German Foreign Office officially announced that \"in his letter the  Emperor merely corrected certain erroneous views prevalent in England  regarding the development of the German fleet.\"    Readers are now in a position to judge for themselves the accuracy of  these statements. It should be remembered that the reduced navy  estimates of 1908-9 were followed by national alarm and the publication  of Admiral Lord Charles Beresford's shipbuilding programme and large  increase in estimates of the following year. Here is the letter:      The Kaiser's Letter.         Berlin, 14th-2, 1908.         My Dear Lord Tweedmouth--May I intrude on your precious time and       ask for a few moments' attention to these lines I venture to submit       to you? I see by the daily papers and reviews that a battle royal       is being fought about the needs of the navy. I therefore venture to       furnish you with some information anent the German naval programme,       which it seems is being quoted by all parties to further their ends       by trying to frighten peaceable British taxpayers with it as a       bogy.         During my last pleasant visit to your hospitable shores I tried to       make your authorities understand what the drift of German naval       policy is, but I am afraid that my explanations have been either       misunderstood or not believed, because I see \"German danger\" and       \"German challenge to British naval supremacy\" constantly quoted in       different articles. This phrase, if not repudiated or corrected,       sown broadcast over the country and daily dinned into British ears,       might in the end create the most deplorable results.         I therefore deem it advisable, as Admiral of the Fleet, to lay some       facts before you to enable you to see clearly that it is absolutely       nonsensical and untrue that the German naval bill is to provide a       navy meant as a challenge to British naval supremacy. The German       fleet is built against nobody at all; it is solely built for       Germany's needs in relation with that country's rapidly growing       trade. The German naval bill was sanctioned by the Imperial       Parliament and published ten years ago, and may be had at any large       bookseller's. There is nothing surprising, secret, or underhand in       it, and every reader may study the whole course mapped out for the       development of the German Navy with the greatest ease.    Thirty to Forty Battleships in 1920.         The law is being adhered to, and provides for about thirty to forty       ships of the line in 1920. The number of ships fixed by the bill       included the fleet then actually in commission, notwithstanding its       material being already old and far surpassed by contemporary types.       In other foreign navies the extraordinary rapidity with which       improvements were introduced in types of battleships, armaments,       and armor made the fleet in commission obsolete before the building       programme providing additions to it was half finished.         The obsolete fleet had to be struck off the list, thus leaving a       gap, lowering the number of ships below the standard prescribed by       the bill. This gap was stopped by using the finished ships to       replace the obsolete ones instead of being added to them as       originally intended. Therefore, instead of steadily increasing the       standing fleet by regular additions it came to a wholesale       rebuilding of the entire German Navy. Our actual programme in       course of execution is practically only the exchange of old       material for new, but not an addition "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16342"],[0,"A Treatise on Simple Counterpoint in Forty Lessons (#4)"],[1,"to should be  consonant with the other part (_b_). When eighth-notes are used, as at _a_,  they must be approached and left stepwise.    The suspension, instead of being sustained as a half-note, may be repeated  on the second quarter, as at _c_. In this case it is best to continue  stepwise through the tone of resolution.    At _d_ the resolution, instead of coming on the second half, appears on the  quarters on either side. This is good.    [Illustration: Fig. 82.]    The ornamental resolution may be used in either part.    Use the suspension freely.    The solutions should be musical, and are to be written over and over again  until such are secured.    All cadences of the second, third and fourth species, or any combination of  these, may be used.      EXERCISES    To canti firmi _a_ and _b_ write two counterpoints above and two below, in  the fifth species      CANTI FIRMI    [Illustration: Fig. 83.]          LESSON X    FLORID COUNTERPOINT (Continued)      When florid counterpoint is combined with other than first species, the  dotted half followed by a quarter-note (_a_), or two eighth-notes (_b_),  is good. Also, a rhythmic figure, as at _c_, where a half-note occupies the  second and third quarters, may be used. [Fig. 84.]    [Illustration: Fig. 84.]      EXERCISES    Write one eight-measure phrase, each, of the following combinations: The  fifth species with the second; the fifth with the third; and the fifth with  the fourth. Write also two eight-measure phrases with fifth species in both  parts. [Fig. 85.]    [Illustration: Fig. 85.]          SIMPLE COUNTERPOINT IN THREE PARTS    LESSON XI    FIRST SPECIES      [Illustration: Fig. 86.]    Regard all rules for two-part counterpoint, unless otherwise mentioned.    If possible, each measure should contain a complete chord. When in the  first species it becomes necessary to double an interval, let it be  preferably the root. The third should be doubled only when a decidedly  smoother melodic progression is thereby obtained; and when both thirds are  in outer parts, each should be approached and left stepwise in one  direction (Fig. 87). The doubling of the fifth is, of course, impossible,  since it necessitates the omission of the third.    [Illustration: Fig. 87.]    All triads may be used in their first inversion.    Diminished and augmented triads, however, are best used in their first  inversion.    The six-four chord may be used at the close as the cadencing tonic six-four  chord. Do not approach the root and fifth in similar motion, as at _b_.  [Fig. 88.]    [Illustration: Fig. 88.]    The dominant seventh may be used in any but its second inversion, the  fifth being omitted.[2] The seventh requires no preparation. Other chords  of the seventh are better not used until second species and later.    If possible, let the chord in the first measure appear complete. The last  chord but one should be complete, unless some form of V or V_7 is used.  [Fig. 89.]        [2] In severely strict counterpoint all parts above the lowest must be      consonant with it. Dissonances, when entering simultaneously with it,      must be treated as suspensions, and when used in the progression of a      part from one chord to another, should be treated as passing-tones or      embellishments. This excludes the use of the unprepared seventh and      ninth; all diminished and augmented triads except in their first      inversion; and all six-four chords, except when the lowest part is      treated as a passing-tone.    [Illustration: Fig. 89.]    Consecutive major thirds may be used when three or more parts are employed.  [Fig. 90.]    [Illustration: Fig. 90.]    A note may now be repeated in the lowest part when it becomes the seventh  of a dominant seventh-chord. [Fig. 91.]    [Illustration: Fig. 91.]    In writing, use soprano, alto and tenor, or alto, tenor and bass; and do  not separate upper parts more than an octave. For a chord or two they may  (for the sake of better voice-leading) separate a tenth.    All hidden fifths and octaves are bad, except between I and V and V and I.  [Fig. 92_a, b_.]    The perfect fifth following the diminished fifth is good when taken in an  upward direction stepwise in the higher parts. [Fig. 92_c_.]    [Illustration: Fig. 92.]    All cadences used in harmony are good.    Unless otherwise mentioned, put the cantus firmus in any part, but avoid  its continued use in the same part.      EXERCISES    To canti firmi _a_ and _b_ write the first species in all parts. Write each  three times, setting the cantus firmus in a different part in each  solution. This necessitates transposing the cantus firmus, when setting it  in the other parts.      CANTI FIRMI    [Illustration: Fig. 93.]          LESSON XII    THE SECOND SPECIES      [Illustration: Fig. 94.]    The second species is written in one part and the first in the other two.    All suggestions made for the second species in two-part counterpoint are  to be observed, unless otherwise mentioned. Those regarding consecutive  perfect intervals are especially to be observed.    The fifth, when in the lowest voice, should be used as in two-part  counterpoint, except when used in V4/3 or the cadencing tonic six-four  chord.    The V4/3 chord may be used on the weak beat, necessitating the omission of  the third. [Fig. 95_a_.]    The third may be omitted (_b_), or doubled (_c_), on the weak beat in this  and succeeding species. [Fig. 95.]    [Illustration: Fig. 95.]    The minor or diminished seventh may be approached by a skip in an upward  direction on the weak beat in any part. This usually necessitates the  omission of some other chord-member on the weak beat.    The major or minor ninth may also be used in the same way, except in the  lowest part, provided it is at least a ninth above the root. [Fig. 96.]    [Illustration: Fig. 96.]    The progression from vii_6 deg. to V in root-position or any inversion in the  same measure, is good. [Fig. 97.] Use _b_ and _c_ only when using other  than first species in two or more parts.    [Illustration: Fig. 97.]    Each measure should usually contain a complete chord. If not complete on  the first beat, bring the missing interval in on the second. [Fig. 98.]    [Illustration: Fig. 98.]    The cadences in Fig. 99 are good, and will suggest others. The use of the  fourth species is permitted as at _a_. A note may be repeated in the final  cadence in all species as at _b_.    [Illustration: Fig. 99.]      EXERCISES    To cantus firmus _a_ write the first species in all parts, as previously  directed.    To cantus firmus _b_ write second species in one part. Write three times,  changing cantus firmus and counterpoint about so that they will appear in  each part in turn.      CANTI FIRMI    [Illustration: Fig. 100.]          LESSON XIII    SECOND SPECIES IN TWO PARTS      [Illustration: Fig. 101.]    The suggestions for second species in both parts, in two-part counterpoint,  apply for the two parts having the second species in three-part  counterpoint.    Accidental harmonies sometimes appear on the weak beat. All tones in this  accidental harmony foreign to the chord on the strong beat must be treated  as dissonances. This must be regarded whenever two or more parts have other  than the first species. [Fig. 102.]    [Illustration: Fig. 102.]    At Fig. 102_a_, the accidental harmony _f-a-c_ is on the weak beat. The _f_  and _a_, being foreign to the chord _c-e-g_ on the strong beat, are  correctly treated as dissonances. At _b_, the _f_ and _a_ are left by skip,  which is not permitted.    The second species may be written continuously in all parts; the tones  appearing on the weak beat must be harmonically related to one another, and  those foreign to the chord on the strong beat must be treated as  dissonances. [Fig. 103.]    [Illustration: Fig. 103.]    The first and second species may be mixed, as in Fig. 104.    [Illustration: Fig. 104.]    The cadences in Fig. 105 are good, and will suggest others. Those with  first species in all parts may also be used.    [Illustration: Fig. 105.]      EXERCISES    To cantus firmus _a_ write a counterpoint in the second species in one  part. Write three settings, as directed in the previous lesson.    Write two eight-measure phrases mixing the first and second species in all  parts.    To cantus firmus _b_ write counterpoints in the second species in the other  two parts. Write two settings, with the cantus firmus in different parts.      CANTI FIRMI    [Illustration: Fig. 106.]          LESSON XIV    THIRD SPECIES      [Illustration: Fig. 107.]    The suggestions for third species in two-part counterpoint, as well as  those for writing the second species in three-part counterpoint, apply when  writing third species in three-part counterpoint.    The cadences at Fig. 108 are good, and will suggest others.    [Illustration: Fig. 108.]      EXERCISES    To cantus firmus _a_ write third species in one part. Write three settings  as previously directed.    To cantus firmus _b_ write second species in two parts, as previously  directed.    Write one eight-measure phrase, using second species in all parts.      CANTI FIRMI    [Illustration: Fig. 109.]          LESSON XV    THIRD SPECIES IN TWO OR MORE PARTS      [Illustration: Fig. 110.]    Previous suggestions when two or more parts have other than first species,  apply here.    In using the ninth of a chord it is well to keep it at least a seventh  distant from the third, as well as a ninth above the root, except in the  case of the dominant ninth in minor keys, where it may be separated by only  an augmented second ([b]). [Fig. 111.]    [Illustration: Fig. 111.]    In writing the third species in all parts, notes appearing simultaneously  should be harmonically related. Treat all tones foreign to the chord on the  first quarter as dissonances.    The cadences in Fig. 112 are good.    [Illustration: Fig. 112.]      EXERCISES    To cantus firmus _a_ write"]]]
