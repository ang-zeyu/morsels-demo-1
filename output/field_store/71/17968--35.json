Moreover, social  tradition treasures the memory of these revelations, and, blending  them with the contributions of humbler folk--for all of us dream our  dreams--provides in myth and legend and tale, as well as in manifold  other art-forms, a stimulus to the inspiration of future generations.  For most purposes fine art, at any rate during its more rudimentary  stages, may be studied in connection with religion.    So far as law and religion will not account for the varieties of social  behaviour, the novice may most conveniently consider them under the  head of morals. The forms of social intercourse, the fashions, the  festivities, are imposed on us by our fellows from without, and none  the less effectively because as a general rule we fall in with them  as a matter of course. The difference between manners and morals of  the higher order is due simply to the more pressing need, in the case  of our most serious duties, of a reflective sanction, a \"moral sense,\"  to break us in to the common service. It is no easy task to keep legal  and religious penalties or rewards out of the reckoning, when trying  to frame an estimate of what the notions of right and wrong, prevalent  in a given society, amount to in themselves; nevertheless, it is worth  doing, and valuable collections of material exist to aid the work.  The facts about education, which even amongst rude peoples is often  carried on far into manhood, throw much light on this problem. So do  the moralizings embodied the traditional lore of the folk--the  proverbs, the beast-fables, the stories of heroes.    There remains the individual to be studied in himself. If the  individual be ignored by social science, as would sometimes appear  to be the case, so much the worse for social science, which, to a  corresponding extent, falls short of being truly anthropological.  Throughout the history of man, our beginner should be on the look-out  for the signs, and the effects, of personal initiative. Freedom of  choice, of course, is limited by what there is to choose from; so that  the development of what may be termed social opportunity should be  concurrently reviewed. Again, it is the aim of every moral system so  to educate each man that his directive self may be as far as possible  identified with his social self. Even suicide is not a man's own affair,  according to the voice of society which speaks in the moral code.  Nevertheless, lest the important truth be overlooked that social  control implies a will that must meet the control half-way, it is well  for the student of man to pay separate and special attention to the  individual agent. The last word in anthropology is: Know thyself.          CHAPTER II  ANTIQUITY OF MAN      History, in the narrower sense of the word, depends on written records.  As we follow back history to the point at which our written records  grow hazy, and the immediate ancestors or predecessors of the peoples  who appear in history are disclosed in legend that needs much eking  out by the help of the spade, we pass into proto-history. At the back  of that, again, beyond the point at which written records are of any  avail at all, comes pre-history.    How, then, you may well inquire, does the pre-historian get to work?  What is his method of linking facts together? And what are the sources  of his information?    First, as to his method. Suppose a number of boys are in a field playing  football, whose superfluous garments are lying about everywhere in  heaps; and suppose you want, for some reason, to find out in what order  the boys arrived on the ground. How would you set about the business?  Surely you would go to one of the heaps of discarded clothes, and take  note of the fact that this boy's jacket lay under that boy's waistcoat.  Moving on to other heaps you might discover that in some cases a boy  had thrown down his hat on one heap, his tie on another, and so on.  This would help you all the more to make out the general series of  arrivals. Yes, but what if some of the heaps showed signs of having  been upset? Well, you must make allowances for these disturbances in  your calculations. Of course, if some one had deliberately made hay  with the lot, you would be nonplussed. The chances are, however, that,  given enough heaps of clothes, and bar intentional and systematic  wrecking of them, you would be able to make out pretty well which boy  preceded which; though you could hardly go on to say with any precision  whether Tom preceded Dick by half a minute or half an hour.    Such is the method of pre-history. It is called the stratigraphical  method, because it is based on the description of strata, or layers.    Let me give a simple example of how strata tell their own tale. It  is no very remarkable instance, but happens to be one that I have  examined for myself. They were digging out a place for a gas-holder  in a meadow in the town of St. Helier, Jersey, and carried their borings  down to bed rock at about thirty feet, which roughly coincides with  the present mean sea-level. The modern meadow-soil went down about  five feet. Then came a bed of moss-peat, one to three feet thick. There  had been a bog here at a time which, to judge by similar finds in other  places, was just before the beginning of the bronze-age. Underneath  the moss-peat came two or three feet of silt with sea-shells in it.  Clearly the island of Jersey underwent in those days some sort of  submergence. Below this stratum came a great peat-bed, five to seven  feet thick, with large tree-trunks in it, the remains of a fine forest  that must have needed more or less elevated land on which to grow.  In the peat was a weapon of polished stone, and at the bottom were  two pieces of pottery, one of them decorated with little pitted marks.  These fragments of evidence are enough to show that the foresters  belonged to the early neolithic period, as it is called. Next occurred  about four feet of silt with sea-shells, marking another advance of  the sea. Below that, again, was a mass, six to eight feet deep, of  the characteristic yellow clay with far-carried fragments of rock in  it that is associated with the great floods of the ice-age. The land  must have been above the reach of the tide for the glacial drift to  settle on it. Finally, three or four feet of blue clay resting  immediately on bed-rock were such as might be produced by the sea,  and thus probably betokened its presence at this level in the still  remoter past.    Here the strata are mostly geological. Man only comes in at one point.  I might have taken a far more striking case--the best I know--from  St. Acheul, a suburb of Amiens in the north of France. Here M. Commont  found human implements of distinct types in about eight out of eleven  or twelve successive geological layers. But the story would take too  long to tell. However, it is well to start with an example that is  primarily geological. For it is the geologist who provides the  pre-historic chronometer. Pre-historians have to reckon in geological  time--that is to say, not in years, but in ages of indefinite extent  corresponding to marked changes in the condition of the earth's surface.  It takes the plain man a long time to find out that it is no use asking  the pre-historian, who is proudly displaying a skull or a stone  implement, \"Please, how many years ago exactly did its owner live?\"  I remember hearing such a question put to the great savant, M.  Cartailhac, when he was lecturing upon the pre-historic drawings found  in the French and Spanish caves; and he replied, \"Perhaps not less  than 6,000 years ago and not more than 250,000.\" The backbone of our  present system of determining the series of pre-historic epochs is  the geological theory of an ice-age comprising a succession of periods  of extreme glaciation punctuated by milder intervals. It is for the  geologists to settle in their own way, unless, indeed, the astronomers  can help them, why there should have been an ice-age at all; what was  the number, extent, and relative duration of its ups and downs; and  at what time, roughly, it ceased in favour of the temperate conditions  that we now enjoy. The pre-historians, for their part, must be content  to make what traces they discover of early man fit in with this  pre-established scheme, uncertain as it is. Every day, however, more  agreement is being reached both amongst themselves and between them  and the geologists; so that one day, I am confident, if not exactly  to-morrow, we shall know with fair accuracy how the boys, who left  their clothes lying about, followed one another into the field.    Sometimes, however, geology does not, on the face of it, come into  the reckoning. Thus I might have asked the reader to assist at the  digging out of a cave, say, one of the famous caves at Mentone, on  the Italian Riviera, just beyond the south-eastern corner of France.  These caves were inhabited by man during an immense stretch of time,  and, as you dig down, you light upon one layer after another of his  leavings. But note in such a case as this how easily you may be baffled  by some one having upset the heap of clothes, or, in a word, by  rearrangement. Thus the man whose leavings ought to form the layer  half-way up may have seen fit to dig a deep hole in the cave-floor  in order to bury a deceased friend, and with him, let us suppose, to  bury also an assortment of articles likely to be useful in the life  beyond the grave. Consequently an implement of one age will be found  lying cheek by jowl with the implement of a much earlier age, or even,  it may be, some feet below it. Thereupon the pre-historian must fall "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17287"],[0,"History of France (#4)"],[1,"soldiers to Anagni, where the  Pope then was, to force him to recall the sentence, apparently intending  them to act like the murderers of Becket. The old man's dignity,  however, overawed them at the moment, and they retired without laying  hands on him, but the shock he had undergone caused his death a few days  later. His successor was poisoned almost immediately on his election,  being known to be adverse to Philip. Parties were equally balanced in  the conclave; but Philip's friends advised him to buy over to his  interest one of his supposed foes, whom they would then unite in  choosing. Bertrand de Goth, Archbishop of Bordeaux, was the man, and in  a secret interview promised Philip to fulfil six conditions if he were  made Pope by his interest. These were: 1st, the reconciliation of Philip  with the Church; 2nd, that of his agents; 3rd, a grant to the king of a  tenth of all clerical property for five years; 4th, the restoration of  the Colonna family to Rome; 5th, the censure of Boniface's memory. These  five were carried out by Clement V., as he called himself, as soon as he  was on the Papal throne; the sixth remained a secret, but was probably  the destruction of the Knights Templars. This order of military monks  had been created for the defence of the crusading kingdom of Jerusalem,  and had acquired large possessions in Europe. Now that their occupation  in the East was gone, they were hated and dreaded by the kings, and  Philip was resolved on their wholesale destruction.      12. The Papacy at Avignon.--Clement had never quitted France, but had  gone through the ceremonies of his installation at Lyons; and Philip,  fearing that in Italy he would avoid carrying out the scheme for the  ruin of the Templars, had him conducted to Avignon, a city of the Empire  which belonged to the Angevin King of Naples, as Count of Provence, and  there for eighty years the Papal court remained. As they were thus  settled close to the French frontier, the Popes became almost vassals of  France; and this added greatly to the power and renown of the French  kings. How real their hold on the Papacy was, was shown in the ruin of  the Templars. The order was now abandoned by the Pope, and its knights  were invited in large numbers to Paris, under pretence of arranging a  crusade. Having been thus entrapped, they were accused of horrible and  monstrous crimes, and torture elicited a few supposed confessions. They  were then tried by the Inquisition, and the greater number were put to  death by fire, the Grand Master last of all, while their lands were  seized by the king. They seem to have been really a fierce, arrogant,  and oppressive set of men, or else there must have been some endeavour  to save them, belonging, as most of them did, to noble French families.  The \"Pest of France,\" as Dante calls Philip the Fair, was now the most  formidable prince in Europe. He contrived to annex to his dominions the  city of Lyons, hitherto an imperial city under its archbishop. Philip  died in 1314; and his three sons--_Louis X._, _Philip V._, and _Charles  IV._,--were as cruel and harsh as himself, but without his talent, and  brought the crown and people to disgrace and misery. Each reigned a few  years and then died, leaving only daughters, and the question arose  whether the inheritance should go to females. When Louis X. died, in  1316, his brother Philip, after waiting for the birth of a posthumous  child who only lived a few days, took the crown, and the Parliament then  declared that the law of the old Salian Franks had been against the  inheritance of women. By this newly discovered Salic law, Charles IV.,  the third brother, reigned on Philip's death; but the kingdom of Navarre  having accrued to the family through their grandmother, and not being  subject to the Salic law, went to the eldest daughter of Louis X., Jane,  wife of the Count of Evreux.          CHAPTER II.    THE HUNDRED YEARS' WAR.      1. Wars of Edward III.--By the Salic law, as the lawyers called it,  the crown was given, on the death of Charles IV., to _Philip, Count of  Valois_, son to a brother of Philip IV., but it was claimed by Edward  III. of England as son of the daughter of Philip IV. Edward contented  himself, however, with the mere assertion of his pretensions, until  Philip exasperated him by attacks on the borders of Guienne, which the  French kings had long been coveting to complete their possession of the  south, and by demanding the surrender of Robert of Artois, who, being  disappointed in his claim to the county of Artois by the judgment of the  Parliament of Paris, was practising by sorcery on the life of the King  of France. Edward then declared war, and his supposed right caused a  century of warfare between France and England, in which the broken,  down-trodden state of the French peasantry gave England an immense  advantage. The knights and squires were fairly matched; but while the  English yeomen were strong, staunch, and trustworthy, the French were  useless, and only made a defeat worse by plundering the fallen on each  side alike. The war began in Flanders, where Philip took the part of the  count, whose tyrannies had caused his expulsion. Edward was called in to  the aid of the citizens of Ghent by their leader Jacob van Arteveldt;  and gained a great victory over the French fleet at Sluys, but with no  important result. At the same time the two kings took opposite sides in  the war of the succession in Brittany, each defending the claim most  inconsistent with his own pretensions to the French crown--Edward  upholding the male heir, John de Montfort, and Philip the direct female  representative, the wife of Charles de Blois.      2. Crecy and Poitiers.--Further difficulties arose through Charles the  Bad, King of Navarre and Count of Evreux, who was always on the watch to  assert his claim to the French throne through his mother, the daughter  of Louis X., and was much hated and distrusted by Philip VI. and his son  John, Duke of Normandy. Fearing the disaffection of the Norman and  Breton nobles, Philip invited a number of them to a tournament at Paris,  and there had them put to death after a hasty form of trial, thus  driving their kindred to join his enemies. One of these offended  Normans, Godfrey of Harcourt, invited Edward to Normandy, where he  landed, and having consumed his supplies was on his march to Flanders,  when Philip, with the whole strength of the kingdom, endeavoured to  intercept him at _Crecy_ in Picardy, in 1348. Philip was utterly  incapable as a general; his knights were wrong-headed and turbulent, and  absolutely cut down their own Genoese hired archers for being in their  way. The defeat was total. Philip rode away to Amiens, and Edward laid  siege to Calais. The place was so strong that he was forced to blockade  it, and Philip had time to gather another army to attempt its relief;  but the English army were so posted that he could not attack them  without great loss. He retreated, and the men of Calais surrendered,  Edward insisting that six burghers should bring him the keys with ropes  round their necks, to submit themselves to him. Six offered themselves,  but their lives were spared, and they were honourably treated. Edward  expelled all the French, and made Calais an English settlement. A truce  followed, chiefly in consequence of the ravages of the Black Death,  which swept off multitudes throughout Europe, a pestilence apparently  bred by filth, famine, and all the miseries of war and lawlessness, but  which spared no ranks. It had scarcely ceased before Philip died, in  1350. His son, _John_, was soon involved in a fresh war with England by  the intrigues of Charles the Bad, and in 1356 advanced southwards to  check the Prince of Wales, who had come out of Guienne on a plundering  expedition. The French were again totally routed at Poitiers, and the  king himself, with his third son, Philip, were made prisoners and  carried to London with most of the chief nobles.      3. The Jacquerie.--The calls made on their vassals by these captive  nobles to supply their ransoms brought the misery to a height. The salt  tax, or _gabelle_, which was first imposed to meet the expenses of the  war, was only paid by those who were neither clergy nor nobles, and the  general saying was--\"Jacques Bonhomme (the nickname for the peasant) has  a broad back, let him bear all the burthens.\" Either by the king, the  feudal lords, the clergy, or the bands of men-at-arms who roved through  the country, selling themselves to any prince who would employ them, the  wretched people were stripped of everything, and used to hide in holes  and caves from ill-usage or insult, till they broke out in a rebellion  called the Jacquerie, and whenever they could seize a castle revenged  themselves, like the brutes they had been made, on those within it.  Taxation was so levied by the king's officers as to be frightfully  oppressive, and corruption reigned everywhere. As the king was in  prison, and his heir, Charles, had fled ignominiously from Poitiers,  the citizens of Paris hoped to effect a reform, and rose with their  provost-marshal, Stephen Marcel, at their head, threatened Charles, and  slew two of his officers before his eyes. On their demand the  States-General were convoked, and made wholesome regulations as to the  manner of collecting the taxes, but no one, except perhaps Marcel, had  any real zeal or public spirit. Charles the Bad, of Navarre, who had  pretended to espouse their cause, betrayed it; the king declared the  decisions of the States-General null and void; and the crafty management  of his son prevented any union between the malcontents. The gentry  rallied, and put down the Jacquerie with horrible cruelty and revenge.  The burghers of Paris found that Charles the Bad only wanted to gain the  throne, and Marcel would have proclaimed him; but those who thought him  even worse than his cousins "]]]
