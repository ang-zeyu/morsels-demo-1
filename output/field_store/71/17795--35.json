It is the growth, development, and transformation into chemistry, of  this _alchemia_ which we have to consider.    Alchemy, that is, _the_ art of melting, pouring, and transforming,  must necessarily pay much attention to working with crucibles,  furnaces, alembics, and other vessels wherein things are fused,  distilled, calcined, and dissolved. The old drawings of alchemical  operations show us men busy calcining, cohobating, distilling,  dissolving, digesting, and performing other processes of like  character to these.    The alchemists could not be accused of laziness or aversion to work in  their laboratories. Paracelsus (16th century) says of them: \"They are  not given to idleness, nor go in a proud habit, or plush and velvet  garments, often showing their rings on their fingers, or wearing  swords with silver hilts by their sides, or fine and gay gloves on  their hands; but diligently follow their labours, sweating whole days  and nights by their furnaces. They do not spend their time abroad for  recreation, but take delight in their laboratories. They put their  fingers among coals, into clay and filth, not into gold rings. They  are sooty and black, like smiths and miners, and do not pride  themselves upon clean and beautiful faces.\"    In these respects the chemist of to-day faithfully follows the  practice of the alchemists who were his predecessors. You can nose a  chemist in a crowd by the smell of the laboratory which hangs about  him; you can pick him out by the stains on his hands and clothes. He  also \"takes delight in his laboratory\"; he does not always \"pride  himself on a clean and beautiful face\"; he \"sweats whole days and  nights by his furnace.\"    Why does the chemist toil so eagerly? Why did the alchemists so  untiringly pursue their quest? I think it is not unfair to say: the  chemist experiments in order that he \"may liken his imaginings to the  facts which he observes\"; the alchemist toiled that he might liken the  facts which he observed to his imaginings. The difference may be put  in another way by saying: the chemist's object is to discover \"how  changes happen in combinations of the unchanging\"; the alchemist's  endeavour was to prove the truth of his fundamental assertion, \"that  every substance contains undeveloped resources and potentialities, and  can be brought outward and forward into perfection.\"    Looking around him, and observing the changes of things, the alchemist  was deeply impressed by the growth and modification of plants and  animals; he argued that minerals and metals also grow, change,  develop. He said in effect: \"Nature is one, there must be unity in all  the diversity I see. When a grain of corn falls into the earth it  dies, but this dying is the first step towards a new life; the dead  seed is changed into the living plant. So it must be with all other  things in nature: the mineral, or the metal, seems dead when it is  buried in the earth, but, in reality, it is growing, changing, and  becoming more perfect.\" The perfection of the seed is the plant. What  is the perfection of the common metals? \"Evidently,\" the alchemist  replied, \"the perfect metal is gold; the common metals are trying to  become gold.\" \"Gold is the intention of Nature in regard to all  metals,\" said an alchemical writer. Plants are preserved by the  preservation of their seed. \"In like manner,\" the alchemist's argument  proceeded, \"there must be a seed in metals which is their essence; if  I can separate the seed and bring it under the proper conditions, I  can cause it to grow into the perfect metal.\" \"Animal life, and human  life also,\" we may suppose the alchemist saying, \"are continued by the  same method as that whereby the life of plants is continued; all life  springs from seed; the seed is fructified by the union of the male and  the female; in metals also there must be the two characters; the union  of these is needed for the production of new metals; the conjoining of  metals must go before the birth of the perfect metal.\"    \"Now,\" we may suppose the argument to proceed, \"now, the passage from  the imperfect to the more perfect is not easy. It is harder to  practise virtue than to acquiesce in vice; virtue comes not naturally  to man; that he may gain the higher life, he must be helped by grace.  Therefore, the task of exalting the purer metals into the perfect  gold, of developing the lower order into the higher, is not easy. If  Nature does this, she does it slowly and painfully; if the exaltation  of the common metals to a higher plane is to be effected rapidly, it  can be done only by the help of man.\"    So far as I can judge from their writings, the argument of the  alchemists may be rendered by some such form as the foregoing. A  careful examination of the alchemical argument shows that it rests on  a (supposed) intimate knowledge of nature's plan of working, and the  certainty that simplicity is the essential mark of that plan.    That the alchemists were satisfied of the great simplicity of nature,  and their own knowledge of the ways of nature's work, is apparent from  their writings.    The author of _The New Chemical Light_ (17th century) says:  \"Simplicity is the seal of truth.... Nature is wonderfully simple, and  the characteristic mark of a childlike simplicity is stamped upon all  that is true and noble in Nature.\" In another place the same author  says: \"Nature is one, true, simple, self-contained, created of God,  and informed with a certain universal spirit.\" The same author,  Michael Sendivogius, remarks: \"It may be asked how I come to have this  knowledge about heavenly things which are far removed beyond human  ken. My answer is that the sages have been taught by God that this  natural world is only an image and material copy of a heavenly and  spiritual pattern; that the very existence of this world is based upon  the reality of its heavenly archetype.... Thus the sage sees heaven  reflected in Nature as in a mirror, and he pursues this Art, not for  the sake of gold or silver, but for the love of the knowledge which it  reveals.\"    The _Only True Way_ advises all who wish to become true alchemists to  leave the circuitous paths of pretended philosophers, and to follow  nature, which is simple; the complicated processes described in books  are said to be the traps laid by the \"cunning sophists\" to catch the  unwary.    In _A Catechism of Alchemy_, Paracelsus asks: \"What road should the  philosopher follow?\" He answers, \"That exactly which was followed by  the Great Architect of the Universe in the creation of the world.\"    One might suppose it would be easier, and perhaps more profitable, to  examine, observe, and experiment, than to turn one's eyes inwards with  the hope of discovering exactly \"the road followed by the Great  Architect of the Universe in the creation of the world.\" But the  alchemical method found it easier to begin by introspection. The  alchemist spun his universe from his own ideas of order, symmetry, and  simplicity, as the spider spins her web from her own substance.    A favourite saying of the alchemists was, \"What is above is as what is  below.\" In one of its aspects this saying meant, \"processes happen  within the earth like those which occur on the earth; minerals and  metals live, as animals and plants live; all pass through corruption  towards perfection.\" In another aspect the saying meant \"the human  being is the world in miniature; as is the microcosm, so is the  macrocosm; to know oneself is to know all the world.\"    Every man knows he ought to try to rise to better things, and many men  endeavour to do what they know they ought to do; therefore, he who  feels sure that all nature is fashioned after the image of man,  projects his own ideas of progress, development, virtue, matter and  spirit, on to nature outside himself; and, as a matter of course, this  kind of naturalist uses the same language when he is speaking of the  changes of material things as he employs to express the changes of his  mental states, his hopes, fears, aspirations, and struggles.    The language of the alchemists was, therefore, rich in such  expressions as these; \"the elements are to be so conjoined that the  nobler and fuller life may be produced\"; \"our arcanum is gold exalted  to the highest degree of perfection to which the combined action of  nature and art can develop it.\"    Such commingling of ethical and physical ideas, such application of  moral conceptions to material phenomena, was characteristic of the  alchemical method of regarding nature. The necessary results were;  great confusion of thought, much mystification of ideas, and a  superabundance of _views_ about natural events.    When the author of _The Metamorphosis of Metals_ was seeking for an  argument in favour of his view, that water is the source and primal  element of all things, he found what he sought in the Biblical text:  \"In the beginning the spirit of God moved upon the face of the  waters.\" Similarly, the author of _The Sodic Hydrolith_ clenches his  argument in favour of the existence of the Philosopher's Stone, by the  quotation: \"Therefore, thus saith the Lord; behold I lay in Zion for a  foundation a Stone, a tried Stone, a precious corner Stone, a sure  foundation. He that has it shall not be confounded.\" This author works  out in detail an analogy between the functions and virtues of the  _Stone_, and the story of man's fall and redemption, as set forth in  the Old and New Testaments. The same author speaks of \"Satan, that  grim pseudo-alchemist.\"    That the attribution, by the alchemists, of moral virtues and vices to  natural things was in keeping with some deep-seated tendency of human  nature, is shown by the persistence of some of their methods of  stating the properties of substances: we still speak of \"perfect and  imperfect gases,\" \"noble and base"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14226"],[0,"Lobo, Rag and Vixen (#4)"],[1,"load of carrion. It cannot be otherwise.\" Then I  swung my lasso and sent it whistling over his head. But not so fast; he  was yet far from being subdued, and, before the supple coils had fallen  on his neck he seized the noose and, with one fierce chop, cut through  its hard thick strands, and dropped it in two pieces at his feet.    Of course I had my rifle as a last resource, but I did not wish to spoil  his royal hide, so I galloped back to the camp and returned with a  cowboy and a fresh lasso. We threw to our victim a stick of wood which  he seized in his teeth, and before he could relinquish it our lassoes  whistled through the air and tightened on his neck.    Yet before the light had died from his fierce eyes, I cried, \"Stay, we  will not kill him; let us take him alive to the camp.\" He was so  completely powerless now that it was easy to put a stout stick through  his mouth, behind his tusks, and then lash his jaws with a heavy cord  which was also fastened to the stick. The stick kept the cord in, and  the cord kept the stick in, so he was harmless. As soon as he felt his  jaws were tied he made no further resistance, and uttered no sound, but  looked calmly at us and seemed to say, \"Well, you have got me at last,  do as you please with me.\" And from that time he took no more notice of  us.    We tied his feet securely, but he never groaned, nor growled, nor turned  his head. Then with our united strength we were just able to put him on  my horse. His breath came evenly as though sleeping, and his eyes were  bright and clear again, but did not rest on us. Afar on the great  rolling mesas they were fixed, his passing kingdom, where his famous  band was now scattered. And he gazed till the pony descended the pathway  into the canon, and the rocks cut off the view.    By travelling slowly we reached the ranch in safety, and after securing  him with a collar and a strong chain, we staked him out in the pasture  and removed the cords. Then for the first time I could examine him  closely, and proved how unreliable is vulgar report where a living hero  or tyrant is concerned. He had _not_ a collar of gold about his neck,  nor was there on his shoulders an inverted cross to denote that he had  leagued himself with Satan. But I did find on one haunch a great broad  scar, that tradition says was the fang-mark of Juno, the leader of  Tannerey's wolf-hounds--a mark which she gave him the moment before he  stretched her lifeless on the sand of the canon.           *       *       *       *       *    I set meat and water beside him, but he paid no heed. He lay calmly on  his breast, and gazed with those steadfast yellow eyes away past me down  through the gateway of the canon, over the open plains--his plains--nor  moved a muscle when I touched him. When the sun went down he was still  gazing fixedly across the prairie. I expected he would call up his band  when night came, and prepared for them, but he had called once in his  extremity, and none had come; he would never call again.           *       *       *       *       *    A lion shorn of his strength, an eagle robbed of his freedom, or a dove  bereft of his mate, all die, it is said, of a broken heart; and who will  aver that this grim bandit could bear the threefold brunt, heart-whole?  This only I know, that when the morning dawned, he was lying there still  in his position of calm repose, but his spirit was gone-the old  king-wolf was dead.           *       *       *       *       *    I took the chain from his neck, a cowboy helped me to carry him to the  shed where lay the remains of Blanca, and as we laid him beside her, the  cattle-man exclaimed: \"There, you _would_ come to her, now you are  together again.\"          REDRUFF    THE STORY OF THE DON VALLEY PARTRIDGE    I      Down the wooded slope of Taylor's Hill the Mother Partridge led her  brood; down toward the crystal brook that by some strange whim was  called Mud Creek. Her little ones were one day old but already quick on  foot, and she was taking them for the first time to drink.    She walked slowly, crouching low as she went, for the woods were full of  enemies. She was uttering a soft little cluck in her throat, a call to  the little balls of mottled down that on their tiny pink legs came  toddling after, and peeping softly and plaintively if left even a few  inches behind, and seeming so fragile they made the very chicadees look  big and coarse. There were twelve of them, but Mother Grouse watched  them all, and she watched every bush and tree and thicket, and the whole  woods and the sky itself. Always for enemies she seemed  seeking--friends were too scarce to be looked for--and an enemy she  found. Away across the level beaver meadow was a great brute of a fox.  He was coming their way, and in a few moments would surely wind them or  strike their trail. There was no time to lose.    '_Krrr_! _Krrr_! (Hide! Hide!) cried the mother in a low, firm voice,  and the little bits of things, scarcely bigger than acorns and but a day  old, scattered far (a few inches) apart to hide. One dived under a leaf,  another between two roots, a third crawled into a curl of birch-bark, a  fourth into a hole, and so on, till all were hidden but one who could  find no cover, so squatted on a broad yellow chip and lay very flat, and  closed his eyes very tight, sure that now he was safe from being seen.  They ceased their frightened peeping and all was still.    Mother Partridge flew straight toward the dreaded beast, alighted  fearlessly a few yards to one side of him, and then flung herself on the  ground, flopping as though winged and lame--oh, so dreadfully lame-and  whining like a distressed puppy. Was she begging for mercy--mercy from a  bloodthirsty, cruel fox? Oh, dear, no! She was no fool. One often hears  of the cunning of the fox. Wait and see what a fool he is compared with  a mother-partridge. Elated at the prize so suddenly within his reach,  the fox turned with a dash and caught--at least, no, he didn't quite  catch the bird; she flopped by chance just a foot out of reach. He  followed with another jump and would have seized her this time surely,  but somehow a sapling came just between, and the partridge dragged  herself awkwardly away and under a log, but the great brute snapped his  jaws and bounded over the log, while she, seeming a trifle less lame,  made another clumsy forward spring and tumbled down a bank, and Reynard,  keenly following, almost caught her tail, but, oddly enough, fast as he  went and leaped, she still seemed just a trifle faster. It was most  extraordinary. A winged partridge and he, Reynard, the Swift-foot, had  not caught her in five minutes' racing. It was really shameful. But the  partridge seemed to gain strength as the fox put forth his, and after a  quarter of a mile race, racing that was somehow all away from Taylor's  Hill, the bird got unaccountably quite well, and, rising with a decisive  whirr, flew off through the woods, leaving the fox utterly dumfounded to  realize that he had been made a fool of, and, worst of all, he now  remembered that this was not the first time he had been served this  very trick, though he never knew the reason for it.    Meanwhile Mother Partridge skimmed in a great circle and came by a  roundabout way back to the little fuzz-balls she had left hidden in the  woods.    With a wild bird's keen memory for places, she went to the very  grass-blade she last trod on, and stood for a moment fondly to admire  the perfect stillness of her children. Even at her step not one had  stirred, and the little fellow on the chip, not so very badly concealed  after all, had not budged, nor did he now; he only closed his eyes a  tiny little bit harder, till the mother said:    '_K-reet_,' (Come, children) and instantly, like a fairy story, every  hole gave up its little baby-partridge, and the wee fellow on the chip,  the biggest of them all really, opened his big-little eyes and ran to  the shelter of her broad tail, with a sweet little '_peep peep_' which  an enemy could not have heard three feet away, but which his mother  could not have missed thrice as far, and all the other thimblefuls of  down joined in, and no doubt thought themselves dreadfully noisy, and  were proportionately happy.    The sun was hot now. There was an open space to cross on the road to the  water, and, after a careful lookout for enemies, the mother gathered the  little things under the shadow of her spread fantail and kept off all  danger of sunstroke until they reached the brier thicket by the stream.    Here a cottontail rabbit leaped out and gave them a great scare. But the  flag of truce he carried behind was enough. He was an old friend; and  among other things the little ones learned that day that Bunny always  sails under a flag of truce, and lives up to it too.    And then came the drink, the purest of living water, though silly men  had called it Mud Creek.    At first the little fellows didn't know how to drink, but they copied  their mother, and soon learned to drink like her and give thanks after  every sip. There they stood in a row along the edge, twelve little brown  and golden balls on twenty-four little pink-toed, in-turned feet, with  twelve sweet little golden heads gravely bowing, drinking, and giving  thanks like their mother.    Then she led them by short stages, keeping the cover, to the far side of  the beaver-meadow, where was a great, grassy dome. The mother had made  a note of this dome some time before. It takes a number of such domes to  raise a brood of partridges. For this was an ant's nest. The old one  stepped on top, looked about a moment, then gave half a dozen vigorous  rakes with her claws. The friable ant-hilt was broken open, and the  earthen galleries scattered in ruins down the slope. The ants swarmed  out and quarrelled with each other for lack of a better plan. Some ran  around the hill with vast energy and little"]]]
