On finding this out, they  collected an army, with which they drove away Amulius, and brought their  grandfather back to Alba Longa.    They then resolved to build a new city for themselves on one of the  seven low hills beneath which ran the yellow river Tiber; but they were  not agreed on which hill to build, Remus wanting to build on the  Aventine Hill, and Romulus on the Palatine. Their grandfather advised  them to watch for omens from the gods, so each stood on his hill and  watched for birds. Remus was the first to see six vultures flying, but  Romulus saw twelve, and therefore the Palatine Hill was made the  beginning of the city, and Romulus was chosen king. Remus was affronted,  and when the mud wall was being raised around the space intended for the  city, he leapt over it and laughed, whereupon Romulus struck him dead,  crying out, \"So perish all who leap over the walls of my city.\"    [Illustration: GLADIATORIAL SHOWS AT A BANQUET]    Romulus traced out the form of the city with the plough, and made it  almost a square. He called the name of it Rome, and lived in the midst  of it in a mud-hovel, covered with thatch, in the midst of about fifty  families of the old Trojan race, and a great many young men, outlaws and  runaways from the neighboring states, who had joined him. The date of  the building of Rome was supposed to be A.D. 753; and the  Romans counted their years from it, as the Greeks did from the  Olympiads, marking the date A.U.C., _anno urbis conditae_, the  year of the city being built. The youths who joined Romulus could not  marry, as no one of the neighboring nations would give his daughter to  one of these robbers, as they were esteemed. The nearest neighbors to  Rome were the Sabines, and the Romans cast their eyes in vain on the  Sabine ladies, till old Numitor advised Romulus to proclaim a great  feast in honor of Neptune, with games and dances. All the people in the  country round came to it, and when the revelry was at its height each of  the unwedded Romans seized on a Sabine maiden and carried her away to  his own house. Six hundred and eighty-three girls were thus seized, and  the next day Romulus married them all after the fashion ever after  observed in Rome. There was a great sacrifice, then each damsel was  told, \"Partake of your husband's fire and water;\" he gave her a ring,  and carried her over his threshold, where a sheepskin was spread, to  show that her duty would be to spin wool for him, and she became his  wife.    [Illustration: THE FORUM.]    Romulus himself won his own wife, Hersilia, among the Sabines on this  occasion; but the nation of course took up arms, under their king  Tatius, to recover their daughters. Romulus drew out his troops into  Campus Martius, or field of Mars, just beneath the Capitol, or great  fort on the Saturnian Hill, and marched against the Sabines; but while  he was absent, Tarpeia, the daughter of the governor of the little fort  he had left on the Saturnian Hill, promised to let the Sabines in on  condition they would give her what they wore on their left arms, meaning  their bracelets; but they hated her treason even while they took  advantage of it, and no sooner were they within the gate than they  pelted her with their heavy shields, which they wore on their left arms,  and killed her. The cliff on the top of which she died is still called  the Tarpeian rock, and criminals were executed by being thrown from the  top of it. Romulus tried to regain the Capitol, but the Sabines rolled  down stones on the Romans, and he was stunned by one that struck him on  the head; and though he quickly recovered and rallied his men, the  battle was going against him, when all the Sabine women, who had been  nearly two years Roman wives, came rushing out, with their little  children in their arms and their hair flying, begging their fathers and  husbands not to kill one another. This led to the making of a peace, and  it was agreed that the Sabines and Romans should make but one nation,  and that Romulus and Tatius should reign together at Rome. Romulus lived  on the Palatine Hill, Tatius on the Tarpeian, and the valley between was  called the Forum, and was the market-place, and also the spot where all  public assemblies were held. All the chief arrangements for war and  government were believed by the Romans to have been laws of Romulus.  However, after five years, Tatius was murdered at a place called  Lavinium, in the middle of a sacrifice, and Romulus reigned alone till  in the middle of a great assembly of his soldiers outside the city, a  storm of thunder and lightning came on, and every one hurried home, but  the king was nowhere to be found; for, as some say, his father Mars had  come down in the tempest and carried him away to reign with the gods,  while others declared that he was murdered by persons, each of whom  carried home a fragment of his body that it might never be found. It  matters less which way we tell it, since the story of Romulus was quite  as much a fable as that of AEneas; only it must be remembered as the  Romans themselves believed it. They worshipped Romulus under the name of  Quirinus, and called their chief families Quirites, both words coming  from _ger_ (a spear); and the she-wolf and twins were the favorite  badge of the empire. The Capitoline Hill, the Palatine, and the Forum all  still bear the same names.    [Illustration]          CHAPTER IV.    NUMA AND TULLUS.    B.C.It was understood between the Romans and the Sabines that they should  have by turns a king from each nation, and, on the disappearance of  Romulus, a Sabine was chosen, named Numa Pompilius, who had been married  to Tatia, the daughter of the Sabine king Tatius, but she was dead, and  had left one daughter. Numa had, ever since her death, been going about  from one grove or fountain sacred to the gods to another offering up  sacrifices, and he was much beloved for his gentleness and wisdom. There  was a grove near Rome, in a valley, where a fountain gushed forth from  the rock; and here Egeria, the nymph of the stream, in the shade of the  trees, counselled Numa on his government, which was so wise that he  lived at peace with all his neighbors. When the Romans doubted whether  it was really a goddess who inspired him, Egeria convinced them, for the  next time he had any guests in his house, the earthenware plates with  homely fare on them were changed before their eyes into golden dishes  with dainty food. Moreover, there was brought from heaven a bronze  shield, which was to be carefully kept, since Rome would never fall  while it was safe. Numa had eleven other shields like it made and hung  in the temple of Mars, and, yearly, a set of men dedicated to the office  bore them through the city with songs and dances. Just as all warlike  customs were said to have been invented by Romulus, all peaceful and  religious ones were held to have sprung from Numa and his Egeria. He was  said to have fixed the calendar and invented the names of the months,  and to have built an altar to Good Faith to teach the Romans to keep  their word to one another and to all nations, and to have dedicated the  bounds of each estate to the Dii Termini, or Landmark Gods, in whose  honor there was a feast yearly. He also was said to have had such power  with Jupiter as to have persuaded him to be content without receiving  sacrifices of men and women. In short, all the better things in the  Roman system were supposed to be due to the gentle Numa.    At the gate called Janiculum stood a temple to the watchman god Janus,  whose figure had two faces, and held the keys, and after whom was named  the month January. His temple was always open in time of war, and closed  in time of peace. Numa's reign was counted as the first out of only  three times in Roman history that it was shut.    [Illustration: JANUS.]    Numa was said to have reigned thirty-eight years, and then he gradually  faded away, and was buried in a stone coffin outside the Janicular gate,  all the books he had written being, by his desire, buried with him.  Egeria wept till she became a fountain in her own valley; and so ended  what in Roman faith answered to the golden age of Greece.    The next king was of Roman birth, and was named Tullus Hostilius. He was  a great warrior, and had a war with the Albans until it was agreed that  the two cities should join together in one, as the Romans and Sabines  had done before; but there was a dispute which should be the greater  city in the league and it was determined to settle it by a combat. In  each city there was a family where three sons had been born at a birth,  and their mothers were sisters. Both sets were of the same age--fine  young men, skilled in weapons; and it was agreed that the six should  fight together, the three whose family name was Horatius on the Roman  side, the three called Curiatius on the Alban side, and whichever set  gained the mastery was to give it to his city.    They fought in the plain between the camps, and very hard was the strife  until two of the Horatii were killed and all the three Curiatii were  wounded, but the last Horatius was entirely untouched. He began to run,  and his cousins pursued him, but at different distances, as one was less  hindered by his wound than the others. As soon as the first came up.  Horatius slew him, and so the second and the third: as he cut down this  last he cried out, \"To the glory of Rome I sacrifice thee.\" As the Alban  king saw his champion fall, he turned to Tullus Hostilius and asked what  his commands were. \"Only to have the Alban youth ready when I need  them,\" said Tullus.    A wreath was set on the victor's head, and, loaded with the spoil of the  Curiatii, he was led into the city in triumph. His sister came hurrying  to meet him; she"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16672"],[0,"The Last Journals of David Livingstone, in Central Africa, from 1865 to His (#4)"],[1,"up others with themselves, and  I wished him to live a hundred years and enjoy all happiness. The idea  was borrowed partly from Sir Bartle Frere's addresses, because I  thought it would have more weight if he heard a little from that  source than if it emanated from myself. He was very anxious that  Captain Brebner and his men, in returning to India, should take a  passage from him in the _Nadir Shah_, one of his men-of-war, and  though he had already placed his things aboard the _Vigilant_, to  proceed to Seychelles, and thence to Bombay, we persuaded Captain  Brebner to accept his Highness's hospitality. He had evidently set his  heart on sending them back with suitable honours, and an hour after  consent was given to go by the _Nadir Shah_, he signed an order for  the money to fit her out.    _11th February, 1866._--One of the foremost subjects that naturally  occupied my mind here was the sad loss of the Baron van der Decken, on  the River Juba, or Aljib. The first intimation of the unfortunate  termination of his explorations was the appearance of Lieutenant von  Schich at this place, who had left without knowing whether his leader  were dead or alive, but an attack had been made on the encampment  which had been planned after the steamer struck the rocks and filled,  and two of the Europeans were killed. The attacking party came from  the direction in which the Baron and Dr. Link went, and three men of  note in it were slain. Von Schich went back from Zanzibar to Brava to  ascertain the fate of the Baron, and meanwhile several native sailors  from Zanzibar had been allowed to escape from the scene of confusion  to Brava.    _18th February, 1866._--All the Europeans went to pay visits of  congratulation to his Highness the Sultan upon the conclusion of the  Ramadan, when sweetmeats were placed before us. He desired me to thank  the Governor of Bombay for his magnificent gift, and to state that  although he would like to have me always with him, yet he would show  me the same favour in Africa which he had done here: he added that the  _Thule_ was at my service to take me to the Rovuma whenever I wished  to leave. I replied that nothing had been wanting on his part; he had  done more than I expected, and I was sure that his Excellency the  Governor would be delighted to hear that the vessel promoted his  health and prosperity; nothing would delight him more than this. He  said that he meant to go out in her on Wednesday next (20th): Bishop  Tozer, Captain Fraser, Dr. Steere, and all the English were present.  The sepoys came in and did obeisance; and I pointed out the Nassick  lads as those who had been rescued from slavery, educated, and sent  back to their own country by the Governor. Surely he must see that  some people in the world act from other than selfish motives.    In the afternoon Sheikh Sulieman, his secretary, came with a letter  for the Governor, to be conveyed by Lieutenant Brebner, I.N., in the  _Nadir Shah_, which is to sail to-morrow. He offered money to the  lieutenant, but this could not be heard of for a moment.    The translation of the letter is as follows, and is an answer to that  which I brought.        TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR OF BOMBAY.        [After compliments.]          \"... The end of my desire is to know ever that your      Excellency's health is good. As for me--your friend--I am very      well.        \"Your honoured letter borne by Dr. Livingstone duly reached me,      and all that you said about him I understood.        \"I will show him respect, give him honour, and help him in all      his affairs; and that I have already done this, I trust he will      tell you.        \"I hope you will let me rest in your heart, and that you will      send me many letters.        \"If you need anything I shall be glad, and will give it.        \"Your sincere friend,        \"MAJID BIN SAID.        \"Dated 2nd Shaul, 1282 (18th February, 1866).\"    _2nd March, 1866._--A northern dhow came in with slaves; when this was  reported to the Sultan he ordered it to be burned, and we saw this  done from the window of the Consulate; but he has very little power  over Northern Arabs. He has shown a little vigour of late. He wished  to raise a revenue by a charge of 10 per cent. on all articles brought  into town for sale, but this is clearly contrary to treaty, which  provides that no monopoly shall be permitted, and no dues save that of  5 per cent. import duty. The French Consul bullies him: indeed the  French system of dealing with the natives is well expressed by that  word; no wonder they cannot gain influence among them: the greatest  power they exercise is by lending their flag to slaving dhows, so that  it covers that nefarious traffic.    The stench arising from a mile and a half or two square miles of  exposed sea beach, which is the general depository of the filth of the  town, is quite horrible. At night it is so gross or crass one might  cut out a slice and manure a garden with it: it might be called  Stinkibar rather than Zanzibar. No one can long enjoy good health  here.    On visiting the slave-market I found about 300 slaves exposed for  sale, the greater part of whom came from Lake Nyassa and the Shire  River; I am so familiar with the peculiar faces and markings or  tattooings, that I expect them to recognize me. Indeed one woman said  that she had heard of our passing up Lake Nyassa in a boat, but she  did not see me: others came from Chipeta, S.W. of the Lake. All who  have grown up seem ashamed at being hawked about for sale. The teeth  are examined, the cloth lifted up to examine the lower limbs, and a  stick is thrown for the slave to bring, and thus exhibit his paces.  Some are dragged through the crowd by the hand, and the price called  out incessantly: most of the purchasers were Northern Arabs and  Persians. This is the period when the Sultan's people may not carry  slaves coastwise; but they simply cannot, for the wind is against  them. Many of the dhows leave for Madagascar, and thence come back to  complete their cargoes.    The Arabs are said to treat their slaves kindly, and this also may be  said of native masters; the reason is, master and slave partake of the  general indolence, but the lot of the slave does not improve with the  general progress in civilization. While no great disparity of rank  exists, his energies are little tasked, but when society advances,  wants multiply; and to supply these the slave's lot grows harder. The  distance between master and man increases as the lust of gain is  developed, hence we can hope for no improvement in the slave's  condition, unless the master returns to or remains in barbarism.    _6th March, 1866._--Rains have begun now that the sun is overhead. We  expect the _Penguin_ daily to come from Johanna, and take us to the  Rovuma. It is an unwholesome place; six of my men have fever; few  retain health long, and considering the lowness of the island, and the  absence of sanitary regulations in the town, it is not to be wondered  at. The Sultan has little power, being only the successor to the  captain of the horde of Arabs who came down and overran the island and  maritime coasts of the adjacent continent. He is called only Said or  Syed, never Sultan; and they can boast of choosing a new one if he  does not suit them. Some coins were found in digging here which have  Cufic inscriptions, and are about 900 years old. The island is low;  the highest parts may not be more than 150 feet above the sea; it is  of a coral formation, with sandstone conglomerate. Most of the plants  are African, but clove-trees, mangoes, and cocoa-nut groves give a  luxuriant South Sea Island look to the whole scenery.    We visited an old man to-day, the richest in Zanzibar, who is to give  me letters to his friends at Tanganyika, and I am trying to get a  depot of goods for provisions formed there, so that when I reach it I  may not be destitute.    _18th March, 1866._--I have arranged with Koorje, a Banian, who farms  the custom-house revenue here, to send a supply of beads, cloth,  flour, tea, coffee, and sugar, to Ujiji, on Lake Tanganyika. The Arab  there, with whom one of Koorje's people will remain in charge of the  goods, is called Thani bin Suelim.    Yesterday we went to take leave of the Sultan, and to thank him for  all his kindness to me and my men, which has indeed been very great.  He offered me men to go with me, and another letter if I wished it. He  looks very ill.    I have received very great kindness during my stay from Dr. and Mrs.  Seward. They have done everything for me in their power: may God  Almighty return it all abundantly into their bosoms, in the way that  He best can. Dr. Seward's views of the policy pursued here I have no  doubt are the right ones; in fact, the only ones which can be looked  back to with satisfaction, or that have probability of success among a  race of Pariah Arabs.    The _Penguin_ came a few days ago, and Lieutenant Garforth in command  agrees to take me down to the Rovuma River, and land me there. I have  a dhow to take my animals: six camels, three buffaloes, and a calf,  two mules, and four donkeys. I have thirteen Sepoys, ten Johanna men,  nine Nassick boys, two Shupanga men, and two Wayaus, Wekatani and  Chuma.[3]    [It may be well to point out that several of these men had previously  been employed by Dr. Livingstone on the Zambesi and Shire; thus Musa,  the Johanna man, was a sailor on the _Lady Nyassa_, whilst Susi and  Amoda were engaged at Shupanga to cut wood for the _Pioneer_. The two  Waiyau lads, Wakatani and Chuma, were liberated from the slavers by  the Doctor and Bishop Mackenzie in 1861, and lived for three years  with the Mission party at Chibisa's before they were engaged by  Livingstone. The Nassick lads were entire strangers, and were trained  in India.]    _19th March, 1866._--We start this morning at 10 A.M. I trust that the  Most High may prosper me in this"]]]
