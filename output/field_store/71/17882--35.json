O inundation of Nile, offerings are made to thee;      Oxen are slain to thee;      Great festivals are kept for thee;      Fowls are sacrificed to thee;      Beasts of the field are caught for thee;      Pure flames are offered to thee;      Offerings are made to every god,      As they are made unto Nile.      Incense ascends unto heaven,      Oxen, bulls, fowls are burnt!      Nile makes for himself chasms in the Thebaid;      Unknown is his name in heaven,      He doth not manifest his forms!      Vain are all representations!        Mortals extol him, and the cycle of gods!      Awe is felt by the terrible ones;      His son is made Lord of all,      To enlighten all Egypt.      Shine forth, shine forth, O Nile! shine forth!      Giving life to men by his omen:      Giving life to his oxen by the pastures!      Shine forth in glory, O Nile!\"[2]    Though thus useful, beneficent, and indeed essential to the existence of  Egypt, the Nile can scarcely be said to add much to the variety of the  landscape or to the beauty of the scenery. It is something, no doubt, to  have the sight of water in a land where the sun beats down all day long  with unremitting force till the earth is like a furnace of iron beneath  a sky of molten brass. But the Nile is never clear. During the  inundation it is deeply stained with the red argillaceous soil brought  down from the Abyssinian highlands. At other seasons it is always more  or less tinged with the vegetable matter which it absorbs on its passage  from Lake Victoria to Khartoum; and this vegetable matter, combined  with Its depth and volume, gives it a dull deep hue, which prevents it  from having the attractiveness of purer and more translucent streams.  The Greek name, Neilos, and the Hebrew, Sichor, are thought to embody  this attribute of the mighty river, and to mean \"dark blue\" or  \"blue-black,\" terms sufficiently expressive of the stream's ordinary  colour. Moreover, the Nile is too wide to be picturesque. It is seldom  less than a mile broad from the point where it enters Egypt, and running  generally between flat shores it scarcely reflects anything, unless it  be the grey-blue sky overhead, or the sails of a passing pleasure boat.    The size of Egypt, within the limits which have been here assigned to  it, is about eleven thousand four hundred square miles, or less than  that of any European State, except Belgium, Saxony, and Servia.  Magnitude is, however, but an insignificant element in the greatness of  States--witness Athens, Sparta, Rhodes, Genoa, Florence, Venice. Egypt  is the richest and most productive land in the whole world. In its most  flourishing age we are told that it contained twenty thousand cities. It  deserved to be called, more (probably) than even Belgium, \"one great  town.\" But its area was undoubtedly small. Still, as little men have  often taken the highest rank among warriors, so little States have  filled a most important place in the world's history. Palestine was  about the size of Wales; the entire Peloponnese was no larger than New  Hampshire; Attica had nearly the same area as Cornwall. Thus the case of  Egypt does not stand by itself, but is merely one out of many exceptions  to what may perhaps be called the general rule.    If stinted for space, Egypt was happy in her soil and in her situation.  The rich alluvium, continually growing deeper and deeper, and  top-dressed each year by nature's bountiful hand, was of an  inexhaustible fertility, and bore readily year after year a threefold  harvest--first a grain crop, and then two crops of grasses or esculent  vegetables. The wheat sown returned a hundredfold to the husbandman, and  was gathered at harvest-time in prodigal abundance--\"as the sand of the  sea, very much,\"--till men \"left numbering\" (Gen. xli. 49). Flax and  doora were largely cultivated, and enormous quantities were produced of  the most nutritive vegetables, such as lentils, garlic, leeks, onions,  endive, radishes, melons, cucumbers, lettuces, and the like, which  formed a most important element in the food of the people. The vine was  also grown in many places, as along the flanks of the hills between  Thebes and Memphis, in the basin of the Fayoum, at Anthylla in the  Mareotis at Sebennytus (now Semnood), and at Plisthine, on the shore of  the Mediterranean. The date-palm, springing naturally from the soil in  clumps, or groves, or planted in avenues, everywhere offered its golden  clusters to the wayfarer, dropping its fruit into his lap. Wheat,  however, was throughout antiquity the chief product of Egypt, which was  reckoned the granary of the world, the refuge and resource of all the  neighbouring nations in time of dearth, and on which in the later  republican, and in the imperial times, Rome almost wholly depended for  her sustenance.    If the soil was thus all that could be wished, still more advantageous  was the situation. Egypt was the only nation of the ancient world which  had ready access to two seas, the Northern Sea, or \"Sea of the Greeks,\"  and the Eastern Sea, or \"Sea of the Arabians and the Indians.\" Phoenicia  might carry her traffic by the painful travel of caravans across fifteen  degrees of desert from her cities on the Levantine coast to the inner  recess of the Persian Gulf, and thus get a share in the trade of the  East at a vast expenditure of time and trouble. Assyria and Babylonia  might for a time, when at the height of their dominion, obtain a  temporary hold on lands which were not their own, and boast that they  stretched from the \"sea of the rising\" to \"that of the setting  sun\"--from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean; but Egypt, at all  times and under all circumstances, commands by her geographic position  an access both to the Mediterranean and to the Indian Ocean by way of  the Red Sea, whereof nothing can deprive her. Suez must always be hers,  for the Isthmus is her natural boundary, and her water-system has been  connected with the head of the Arabian Gulf for more than three thousand  years; and, in the absence of any strong State in Arabia or Abyssinia,  the entire western coast of the Red Sea falls naturally under her  influence with its important roadsteads and harbours. Thus Egypt had two  great outlets for her productions, and two great inlets by which she  received the productions of other countries. Her ships could issue from  the Nilotic ports and trade with Phoenicia, or Carthage, or Italy, or  Greece, exchanging her corn and wine and glass and furniture and works  in metallurgy for Etruscan vases, or Grecian statues, or purple Tynan  robes, or tin brought by Carthaginian merchantmen from the Scilly  islands and from Cornwall; or they could start from Heroopolis, or Myos  Hormus, or some port further to the southward, and pass by way of the  Red Sea to the spice-region of \"Araby the Blest,\" or to the Abyssinian  timber-region, or to the shores of Zanzibar and Mozambique, or round  Arabia to Teredon on the Persian Gulf, or possibly to Ceylon or India.  The products of the distant east, even of \"far Cathay,\" certainly flowed  into the land, for they have been dug out of the ancient tombs; but  whether they were obtained by direct or by indirect commerce must be  admitted to be doubtful.    The possession of the Nile was of extraordinary advantage to Egypt, not  merely as the source of fertility, but as a means of rapid  communication. One of the greatest impediments to progress and  civilization which Nature offers to man in regions which he has not yet  subdued to his will, is the difficulty of locomotion and of transport.  Mountains, forests, torrents, marshes, jungles, are the curses of \"new  countries,\" forming, until they have been cut through, bridged over, or  tunnelled under, insurmountable barriers, hindering commerce and causing  hatreds through isolation. Egypt had from the first a broad road driven  through it from end to end--a road seven hundred miles long, and seldom  much less than a mile wide--which allowed of ready and rapid  communication between the remotest parts of the kingdom. Rivers, indeed,  are of no use as arteries of commerce or vehicles for locomotion until  men have invented ships or boats, or at least rafts, to descend and  ascend them; but the Egyptians were acquainted with the use of boats and  rafts from a very remote period, and took to the water like a brood of  ducks or a parcel of South Sea Islanders. Thirty-two centuries ago an  Egyptian king built a temple on the confines of the Mediterranean  entirely of stone which he floated down the Nile for six hundred and  fifty miles from the quarries of Assouan (Syene); and the passage up the  river is for a considerable portion of the year as easy as the passage  down. Northerly winds--the famous \"Etesian gales\"--prevail in Egypt  during the whole of the summer and autumn, and by hoisting a sail it is  almost always possible to ascend the stream at a good pace. If the sail  be dropped, the current will at all times take a vessel down-stream; and  thus boats, and even vessels of a large size, pass up and down the  water-way with equal facility.    Egypt is at all seasons a strange country, but presents the most  astonishing appearance at the period of the inundation. At that time not  only is the lengthy valley from Assouan to Cairo laid under water, but  the Delta itself becomes one vast lake, interspersed with islands, which  stud its surface here and there at intervals, and which reminded  Herodotus of \"the islands of the AEgean.\" The elevations, which are the  work of man, are crowned for the most part with the white walls of towns  and villages sparkling in the sunlight, and sometimes glassed in the  flood beneath them.

An exception to Rule 3 occurs when the two consonants consist of a mute  followed by l or r (pl, cl, tl; pr, cr, tr, etc.). In such cases both  consonants are regularly joined to the following vowel; as, a-gri,  vo-lu-cris, pa-tris, ma-tris. Yet if the l or r introduces the second part  of a compound, the two consonants are separated; as, ab-rumpo, ad-latus.    5. The double consonant x is joined to the preceding vowel; as, ax-is,  tex-i.    QUANTITY.    5. A. Quantity of Vowels.    A vowel is _long_ or _short_ according to the length of time required for  its pronunciation. No absolute rule can be given for determining the  quantity of Latin vowels. This knowledge must be gained, in large measure,  by experience; but the following principles are of aid:--    1. A vowel is long,[6]--      a) before nf or ns; as, infans, inferior, consumo, censeo, insum.      b) when the result of contraction; as, nilum for nihilum.    2. A vowel is short,--      a) before nt, nd; as, amant, amandus. A few exceptions occur in compounds    whose first member has a long vowel; as, nondum (non dum).      b) before another vowel, or h; as, meus, traho. Some exceptions occur,    chiefly in proper names derived from the Greek; as, Aeneas.    B. Quantity of Syllables.    Syllables are distinguished as _long_ or _short_ according to the length of  time required for their pronunciation.    1. A syllable is long,[7]--      a) if it contains a long vowel; as, mater, regnum, dius.      b) if it contains a diphthong; as, causae, foedus.      c) if it contains a short vowel followed by x, z, or any two consonants    (except a mute with l or r); as, axis, gaza, resto.    2. A syllable is short, if it contains a short vowel followed by a vowel or  by a single consonant; as, mea, amat.    3. Sometimes a syllable varies in quantity, _viz_. when its vowel is short  and is followed by a mute with l or r, i.e. by pl, cl, tl; pr, cr, tr,  etc.; as, agri, volucris.[8] Such syllables are called _common_. In prose  they were regularly short, but in verse they might be treated as long at  the option of the poet.    NOTE.--These distinctions of _long_ and _short_ are not arbitrary and  artificial, but are purely natural. Thus, a syllable containing a short  vowel followed by two consonants, as ng, is long, because such a syllable  requires _more time_ for its pronunciation; while a syllable containing a  short vowel followed by one consonant is short, because it takes _less  time_ to pronounce it. In case of the common syllables, the mute and the  liquid blend so easily as to produce a combination which takes no more time  than a single consonant. Yet by separating the two elements (as ag-ri) the  poets were able to use such syllables as long.    ACCENT.    6. 1. Words of two syllables are accented upon the first; as, tegit,  mo'rem.    2. Words of more than two syllables are accented upon the penult (next to  the last) if that is a long syllable, otherwise upon the antepenult (second  from the last); as, ama'vi, amantis, miserum.    3. When the enclitics -que, -ne, -ve, -ce, -met, -dum are appended to  words, if the syllable preceding the enclitic is long (either originally or  as a result of adding the enclitic) it is accented; as, misero'que,  hominisque. But if the syllable still remains short after the enclitic has  been added, it is not accented unless the word originally took the accent  on the antepenult. Thus, portaque; but miseraque.    4. Sometimes the final -e of -ne and -ce disappears, but without affecting  the accent; as, tanto'n, isti'c, illu'c.    5. In utra'que, _each_, and plera'que, _most_, -que is not properly an  enclitic; yet these words accent the penult, owing to the influence of  their other cases,--uterque, utrumque, plerumque.    VOWEL CHANGES.[9]    7.. 1. In Compounds,      a) e before a single consonant becomes i; as,--        colligo     for con-lego.      b) a before a single consonant becomes i: as,--        adigo       for ad-ago.      c) a before two consonants becomes e; as,--        expers      for ex-pars.      d) ae becomes i; as,--        conquiro    for con-quaero.      e) au becomes u, sometimes o; as,--        concludo    for con-claudo;      explodo     for ex-plaudo.    2. Contraction. Concurrent vowels were frequently contracted into one long  vowel. The first of the two vowels regularly prevailed; as,--      tres      for tre-es;         copia     for co-opia;    malo      for ma(v)elo;       cogo      for co-ago;    amasti    for ama(v)isti;     como      for co-emo;    debeo     for de(h)abeo;      junior    for ju(v)enior.    nil       for nihil;    3. Parasitic Vowels. In the environment of liquids and nasals a parasitic  vowel sometimes develops; as,--      vinculum for earlier vinclum.    So periculum, saeculum.    4. Syncope. Sometimes a vowel drops out by syncope; as,--      ardor for aridor (compare _aridus_);    valde for valide (compare _validus_).    CONSONANT CHANGES[10]    8. 1. Rhotacism. An original s between vowels became r; as,--      arbos, Gen. arboris (for arbosis);    genus, Gen. generis (for genesis);    dirimo (for dis-emo).    2. dt, tt, ts each give s or ss; as,--      pensum for pend-tum;    versum for vert-tum;    miles for milet-s;    sessus for sedtus;    passus for pattus.    3. Final consonants were often omitted; as,--      cor for cord;    lac for lact.    4. Assimilation of Consonants. Consonants are often assimilated to a  following sound. Thus: accurro (adc-); aggero (adg-); assero (ads-);  allatus (adl-); apporto (adp-); attuli (adt-); arrideo (adr-); affero  (adf-); occurro (obc-); suppono (subp-); offero (obf-); corruo (comr-);  collatus (coml-); etc.    5. Partial Assimilation. Sometimes the assimilation is only partial.  Thus:--      a) b before s or t becomes p; as,--        scripsi (scrib-si), scriptum (scrib-tum).      b) g before s or t becomes c; as,--        actus (ag-tus).      c) m before a dental or guttural becomes n; as,--        eundem (eum-dem); princeps (prim-ceps).    PECULIARITIES OF ORTHOGRAPHY.    9. Many words have variable orthography.    1. Sometimes the different forms belong to different periods of the  language. Thus, quom, voltus, volnus, volt, etc., were the prevailing forms  almost down to the Augustan age; after that, cum, vultus, vulnus, vult,  etc. So optumus, maxumus, lubet, lubido, etc. down to about the same era;  later, optimus, maximus, libet, libido, etc.    2. In some words the orthography varies at one and the same period of the  language. Examples are exspecto, expecto; exsisto, existo; epistula,  epistola; adulescens, adolescens; paulus, paullus; cottidie, cotidie; and,  particularly, prepositional compounds, which often made a concession to the  etymology in the spelling; as,--      ad-gero or aggero;            ad-sero or assero;    ad-licio or allicio;          in-latus or illatus;    ad-rogans or arrogans;        sub-moveo or summoveo;                         and many others.    3. Compounds of jacio were usually written eicio, deicio, adicio, obicio,  etc., but were probably pronounced as though written adjicio, objicio, etc.    4. Adjectives and nouns in -quus, -quum; -vus, -vum; -uus, -uum preserved  the earlier forms in -quos, -quom; -vos, -vom; -uos, -uom, down through the  Ciceronian age; as, antiquos, antiquom; saevos; perpetuos; equos; servos.  Similarly verbs in the 3d plural present indicative exhibit the  terminations -quont, -quontur; -vont, -vontur; -uont, -uontur, for the same  period; as, relinquont, loquontur; vivont, metuont.    The older spelling, while generally followed in editions of Plautus and  Terence, has not yet been adopted in our prose texts.           *       *       *       *       *    PART II.           *       *       *       *       *    INFLECTIONS.           *       *       *       *       *    10. The Parts of Speech in Latin are the same as in English, viz. Nouns,  Adjectives, Pronouns, Verbs, Adverbs, Prepositions, Conjunctions, and  Interjections; but the Latin has no article.    11. Of these eight parts of speech the first four are capable of  Inflection, i.e. of undergoing change of form to express modifications of  meaning. In case of Nouns, Adjectives, and Pronouns, this process is called  Declension; in case of verbs, Conjugation.           *       *       *       *       *    CHAPTER I.--_Declension._    A. NOUNS.    12. A Noun is the name of a _person_, _place_, _thing_, or _quality_; as,  Caesar, _Caesar_; Roma, _Rome_; penna, _feather_; virtus, _courage_.    1. Nouns are either Proper or Common. Proper nouns are permanent names of  persons or places; as, Caesar, Roma. Other nouns are Common: as, penna,  virtus.    2. Nouns are also distinguished as Concrete or Abstract.      a) Concrete nouns are those which designate individual objects; as, mons,    _mountain_; pes, _foot_; dies, _day_; mens, _mind_.      Under concrete nouns are included, also, collective nouns; as, legio,    _legion_; comitatus, _retinue_.      b) Abstract nouns designate qualities; as, constantia, _steadfastness_;    paupertas, _poverty_.    GENDER OF NOUNS.    13. There are three Genders,--Masculine, Feminine, and Neuter. Gender in  Latin is either natural or grammatical.    Natural Gender.    14. The gender of nouns is natural when it is based upon sex. Natural  gender is confined entirely to names of persons; and these are--    1. Masculine, if they denote males; as,--      nauta, _sailor_; agricola, _farmer_.    2. Feminine, if they denote females; as,--      mater, _mother_; regina, _queen_.    Grammatical Gender.    15. Grammatical gender is determined not by sex, but by the general  signification of the word, or the ending of its Nominative Singular. By  grammatical gender, nouns denoting things or qualities are often Masculine  or Feminine, simply by virtue of their signification or the ending of the  Nominative Singular. The following are the general principles for"]]]
