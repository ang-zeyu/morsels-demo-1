ION: All passages, I should say, Socrates.    SOCRATES: Not all, Ion, surely. Have you already forgotten what you were  saying? A rhapsode ought to have a better memory.    ION: Why, what am I forgetting?    SOCRATES: Do you not remember that you declared the art of the rhapsode  to be different from the art of the charioteer?    ION: Yes, I remember.    SOCRATES: And you admitted that being different they would have  different subjects of knowledge?    ION: Yes.    SOCRATES: Then upon your own showing the rhapsode, and the art of the  rhapsode, will not know everything?    ION: I should exclude certain things, Socrates.    SOCRATES: You mean to say that you would exclude pretty much the  subjects of the other arts. As he does not know all of them, which of  them will he know?    ION: He will know what a man and what a woman ought to say, and what  a freeman and what a slave ought to say, and what a ruler and what a  subject.    SOCRATES: Do you mean that a rhapsode will know better than the pilot  what the ruler of a sea-tossed vessel ought to say?    ION: No; the pilot will know best.    SOCRATES: Or will the rhapsode know better than the physician what the  ruler of a sick man ought to say?    ION: He will not.    SOCRATES: But he will know what a slave ought to say?    ION: Yes.    SOCRATES: Suppose the slave to be a cowherd; the rhapsode will know  better than the cowherd what he ought to say in order to soothe the  infuriated cows?    ION: No, he will not.    SOCRATES: But he will know what a spinning-woman ought to say about the  working of wool?    ION: No.    SOCRATES: At any rate he will know what a general ought to say when  exhorting his soldiers?    ION: Yes, that is the sort of thing which the rhapsode will be sure to  know.    SOCRATES: Well, but is the art of the rhapsode the art of the general?    ION: I am sure that I should know what a general ought to say.    SOCRATES: Why, yes, Ion, because you may possibly have a knowledge of  the art of the general as well as of the rhapsode; and you may also have  a knowledge of horsemanship as well as of the lyre: and then you would  know when horses were well or ill managed. But suppose I were to ask  you: By the help of which art, Ion, do you know whether horses are well  managed, by your skill as a horseman or as a performer on the lyre--what  would you answer?    ION: I should reply, by my skill as a horseman.    SOCRATES: And if you judged of performers on the lyre, you would  admit that you judged of them as a performer on the lyre, and not as a  horseman?    ION: Yes.    SOCRATES: And in judging of the general's art, do you judge of it as a  general or a rhapsode?    ION: To me there appears to be no difference between them.    SOCRATES: What do you mean? Do you mean to say that the art of the  rhapsode and of the general is the same?    ION: Yes, one and the same.    SOCRATES: Then he who is a good rhapsode is also a good general?    ION: Certainly, Socrates.    SOCRATES: And he who is a good general is also a good rhapsode?    ION: No; I do not say that.    SOCRATES: But you do say that he who is a good rhapsode is also a good  general.    ION: Certainly.    SOCRATES: And you are the best of Hellenic rhapsodes?    ION: Far the best, Socrates.    SOCRATES: And are you the best general, Ion?    ION: To be sure, Socrates; and Homer was my master.    SOCRATES: But then, Ion, what in the name of goodness can be the reason  why you, who are the best of generals as well as the best of rhapsodes  in all Hellas, go about as a rhapsode when you might be a general? Do  you think that the Hellenes want a rhapsode with his golden crown, and  do not want a general?    ION: Why, Socrates, the reason is, that my countrymen, the Ephesians,  are the servants and soldiers of Athens, and do not need a general; and  you and Sparta are not likely to have me, for you think that you have  enough generals of your own.    SOCRATES: My good Ion, did you never hear of Apollodorus of Cyzicus?    ION: Who may he be?    SOCRATES: One who, though a foreigner, has often been chosen their  general by the Athenians: and there is Phanosthenes of Andros, and  Heraclides of Clazomenae, whom they have also appointed to the command  of their armies and to other offices, although aliens, after they had  shown their merit. And will they not choose Ion the Ephesian to be  their general, and honour him, if he prove himself worthy? Were not  the Ephesians originally Athenians, and Ephesus is no mean city? But,  indeed, Ion, if you are correct in saying that by art and knowledge you  are able to praise Homer, you do not deal fairly with me, and after  all your professions of knowing many glorious things about Homer, and  promises that you would exhibit them, you are only a deceiver, and so  far from exhibiting the art of which you are a master, will not, even  after my repeated entreaties, explain to me the nature of it. You have  literally as many forms as Proteus; and now you go all manner of ways,  twisting and turning, and, like Proteus, become all manner of people  at once, and at last slip away from me in the disguise of a general, in  order that you may escape exhibiting your Homeric lore. And if you have  art, then, as I was saying, in falsifying your promise that you would  exhibit Homer, you are not dealing fairly with me. But if, as I believe,  you have no art, but speak all these beautiful words about Homer  unconsciously under his inspiring influence, then I acquit you of  dishonesty, and shall only say that you are inspired. Which do you  prefer to be thought, dishonest or inspired?    ION: There is a great difference, Socrates, between the two  alternatives; and inspiration is by far the nobler.    SOCRATES: Then, Ion, I shall assume the nobler alternative; and  attribute to you in your praises of Homer inspiration, and not art."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16350"],[0,"Curiosities of Literature,  Vol. 2 (#4)"],[1," general, however, they are  frequently the same in the infancy of nations, and in more polished  societies. Respect, humility, fear, and esteem, are expressed much in a  similar manner, for these are the natural consequence of the  organisation of the body.    These demonstrations become in time only empty civilities, which signify  nothing; we shall notice what they were originally, without reflecting  on what they are.    Primitive nations have no peculiar modes of salutation; they know no  reverences or other compliments, or they despise and disdain them. The  Greenlanders laugh when they see an European uncover his head, and bend  his body before him whom he calls his superior.    The Islanders, near the Philippines, take the hand or foot of him they  salute, and with it they gently rub their face. The Laplanders apply  their nose strongly against that of the person they salute. Dampier  says, that at New Guinea they are satisfied to put on their heads the  leaves of trees, which have ever passed for symbols of friendship and  peace. This is at least a picturesque salute.    Other salutations are very incommodious and painful; it requires great  practice to enable a man to be polite in an island situated in the  straits of the Sound. Houtman tells us they saluted him in this  grotesque manner: \"They raised his left foot, which they passed gently  over the right leg, and from thence over his face.\" The inhabitants of  the Philippines use a most complex attitude; they bend their body very  low, place their hands on their cheeks, and raise at the same time one  foot in the air with their knee bent.    An Ethiopian takes the robe of another, and ties it about his own waist,  so that he leaves his friend half naked. This custom of undressing on  these occasions takes other forms; sometimes men place themselves naked  before the person whom they salute; it is to show their humility, and  that they are unworthy of appearing in his presence. This was practised  before Sir Joseph Banks, when he received the visits of two female  Otaheitans. Their innocent simplicity, no doubt, did not appear immodest  in the eyes of the _virtuoso_.    Sometimes they only undress partially. The Japanese only take off a  slipper; the people of Arracan their sandals in the street, and their  stockings in the house.    In the progress of time it appears servile to uncover oneself. The  grandees of Spain claim the right of appearing covered before the king,  to show that they are not so much subjected to him as the rest of the  nation: and (this writer truly observes) we may remark that the  _English_ do not uncover their heads so much as the other nations of  Europe. Mr. Hobhouse observes that uncovering the head, with the Turks,  is a mark of indecent familiarity; in their mosques the Franks must keep  their hats on. The Jewish custom of wearing their hats in their  synagogues is, doubtless, the same oriental custom.    In a word, there is not a nation, observes the humorous Montaigne, even  to the people who when they salute turn their backs on their friends,  but that can be justified in their customs.    The negroes are lovers of ludicrous actions, and hence all their  ceremonies seem farcical. The greater part pull the fingers till they  crack. Snelgrave gives an odd representation of the embassy which the  king of Dahomy sent to him. The ceremonies of salutation consisted in  the most ridiculous contortions. When two negro monarchs visit, they  embrace in snapping three times the middle finger.    Barbarous nations frequently imprint on their salutations the  dispositions of their character. When the inhabitants of Carmena (says  Athenaeus) would show a peculiar mark of esteem, they breathed a vein,  and presented for the beverage of their friend the flowing blood. The  Franks tore the hair from their head, and presented it to the person  they saluted. The slave cut his hair, and offered it to his master.    The Chinese are singularly affected in their personal civilities. They  even calculate the number of their reverences. These are the most  remarkable postures. The men move their hands in an affectionate manner,  while they are joined together on the breast, and bow their head a  little. If they respect a person, they raise their hands joined, and  then lower them to the earth in bending the body. If two persons meet  after a long separation, they both fall on their knees and bend the face  to the earth, and this ceremony they repeat two or three times. Surely  we may differ here with the sentiment of Montaigne, and confess this  ceremony to be ridiculous. It arises from their national affectation.  They substitute artificial ceremonies for natural actions.    Their expressions mean as little as their ceremonies. If a Chinese is  asked how he finds himself in health, he answers, _Very well; thanks to  your abundant felicity_. If they would tell a man that he looks well,  they say, _Prosperity is painted on your face_: or, _Your air announces  your happiness_.    If you render them any service, they say, _My thanks shall be immortal_.  If you praise them, they answer, _How shall I dare to persuade myself of  what you say of me_? If you dine with them, they tell you at parting,  _We have not treated you with sufficient distinction_. The various  titles they invent for each other it would be impossible to translate.    It is to be observed that all these answers are prescribed by the  Chinese ritual, or Academy of Compliments. There, are determined the  number of bows: the expressions to be employed; the genuflexions, and  the inclinations which are to be made to the right or left hand; the  salutations of the master before the chair where the stranger is to be  seated, for he salutes it most profoundly, and wipes the dust away with  the skirts of his robe; all these and other things are noticed, even to  the silent gestures by which you are entreated to enter the house. The  lower class of people are equally nice in these punctilios; and  ambassadors pass forty days in practising them before they are enabled  to appear at court. A tribunal of ceremonies has been erected; and every  day very odd decrees are issued, to which the Chinese most religiously  submit.    The marks of honour are frequently arbitrary; to be seated with us is a  mark of repose and familiarity; to stand up, that of respect. There are  countries, however, in which princes will only be addressed by persons  who are seated, and it is considered as a favour to be permitted to  stand in their presence. This custom prevails in despotic countries; a  despot cannot suffer without disgust the elevated figure of his  subjects; he is pleased to bend their bodies with their genius; his  presence must lay those who behold him prostrate on the earth; he  desires no eagerness, no attention; he would only inspire terror.          FIRE, AND THE ORIGIN OF FIREWORKS.      In the Memoirs of the French Academy, a little essay on this subject is  sufficiently curious; the following contains the facts:--    FIREWORKS were not known to antiquity.--It is certainly a modern  invention. If ever the ancients employed fires at their festivals, it  was only for religious purposes.    Fire, in primaeval ages, was a symbol of respect, or an instrument of  terror. In both these ways God manifested himself to man. In the holy  writings he compares himself sometimes to an ardent fire, to display his  holiness and his purity; sometimes he renders himself visible under the  form of a burning bush, to express himself to be as formidable as a  devouring fire: again, he rains sulphur; and often, before he speaks, he  attracts the attention of the multitude by flashes of lightning.    Fire was worshipped as a divinity by several idolaters: the Platonists  confounded it with the heavens, and considered it as the divine  intelligence. Sometimes it is a symbol of majesty.--God walked (if we  may so express ourselves) with his people, preceded by a pillar of fire;  and the monarchs of Asia, according to Herodotus, commanded that such  ensigns of their majesty should be carried before them. These fires,  according to Quintus Curtius, were considered as holy and eternal, and  were carried at the head of their armies on little altars of silver, in  the midst of the magi who accompanied them and sang their hymns.    Fire was also a symbol of majesty amongst the Romans; and if it was used  by them in their festivals, it was rather employed for the ceremonies of  religion than for a peculiar mark of their rejoicings. Fare was always  held to be most proper and holy for sacrifices; in this the Pagans  imitated the Hebrews. The fire so carefully preserved by the Vestals was  probably an imitation of that which fell from heaven on the victim  offered by Aaron, and long afterwards religiously kept up by the  priests. Servius, one of the seven kings of Rome, commanded a great fire  of straw to be kindled in the public place of every town in Italy to  consecrate for repose a certain day in seed-time, or sowing.    The Greeks lighted lamps at a certain feast held in honour of Minerva,  who gave them oil; of Vulcan, who was the inventor of lamps; and of  Prometheus, who had rendered them service by the fire which he had  stolen from heaven. Another feast to Bacchus was celebrated by a grand  nocturnal illumination, in which wine was poured forth profusely to all  passengers. A feast in memory of Ceres, who sought so long in the  darkness of hell for her daughter, was kept by burning a number of  torches.    Great illuminations were made in various other meetings; particularly  in the Secular Games, which lasted three whole nights; and so carefully  were they kept up, that these nights had no darkness.    In all their rejoicings the ancients indeed used fires; but they were  intended merely to burn their sacrifices, and, as the generality of them  were performed at night, the illuminations served to give light"]]]
