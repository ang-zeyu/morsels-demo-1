We say likewise the      foundation's strength; the diamond's lustre; the winter's severity: but      in these cases his may be understood, he and his having formerly been      applied to neuters in the place now supplied by it and its.        The learned and sagacious Wallis, to whom every English grammarian owes      a tribute of reverence, calls this modification of the noun an      adjective possessive; I think with no more propriety than he might have      applied the same to the genitive in equitum decus, Trojae oris, or any      other Latin genitive. Dr. Lowth, on the other part, supposes the      possessive pronouns mine and thine to be genitive cases.        This termination of the noun seems to constitute a real genitive      indicating possession. It is derived to us from the Saxon's who      declined smith, a smith; Gen. smither, of a smith; Plur. smither or      smithar, smiths; and so in two other of their seven declensions.        It is a further confirmation of this opinion, that in the old poets      both the genitive and plural were longer by a syllable than the      original word: knitis for knight's, in Chaucer; leavis for leaves, in      Spenser.        When a word ends in s, the genitive may be the same with the      nominative, as Venus temple.    The plural is formed by adding s, as table, tables; fly, flies; sister,  sisters; wood, woods; or es where s could not otherwise be sounded, as  after ch, s, sh, x, z; after c sounded like s, and g like j; the mute e is  vocal before s, as lance, lances; outrage, outrages.        The formation of the plural and genitive singular is the same.        A few words still make the plural in n, as men, women, oxen, swine, and      more anciently eyen, shoon. This formation is that which generally      prevails in the Teutonick dialects.    Words that end in f commonly form their plural by ves, as loaf, loaves;  calf, calves.        Except a few, muff, muffs; chief, chiefs. So hoof, roof, proof, relief,      mischief, puff, cuff, dwarf, handkerchief, grief.        Irregular plurals are teeth from tooth, lice from louse, mice from      mouse, geese from goose, feet from foot, dice from die, pence from      penny, brethren from brother, children from child.    Plurals ending in s have no genitives; but we say, Womens excellencies, and  Weigh the mens wits against the ladies hairs.        Dr. Willis thinks the Lords' house may he said for the house of Lords;      but such phrases are not now in use; and surely an English ear rebels      against them. They would commonly produce a troublesome ambiguity, as      the Lord's house may be the house of Lords, or the house of a Lord.      Besides that the mark of elision is improper, for in the Lords' house      nothing is cut off.        Some English substantives, like those of many other languages, change      their termination as they express different sexes; as prince, princess;      actor, actress; lion, lioness; hero, heroine. To these mentioned by Dr.      Lowth may be added arbitress, poetess, chauntress, duchess, tigress,      governess, tutress, peeress, authoress, traytress, and perhaps othets.      Of these variable terminations we have only a sufficient number to make      us feel our want; for when we say of a woman that she is a philosopher,      an astronomer, a builder, a weaver, a dancer, we perceive an      impropriety in the termination which we cannot avoid; but we can say      that she is an architect, a botanist, a student. because these      terminations have not annexed to them the notion of sex. In words which      the necessities of life are often requiring, the sex is distinguished      not by different terminations but by different names, as a bull, a cow;      a horse, a mare; equus, equa; a cock, a hen; and sometimes by pronouns      prefixed, as a he-goat, a, she-goat.           *       *       *       *       *    Of ADJECTIVES.    Adjectives in the English language are wholly indeclinable; having neither  case, gender, nor number, and being added to substantives in all relations  without any change; as, a good woman, good women, of a good woman; a good  man, good men, of good men.    The Comparison of Adjectives.    The comparative degree of adjectives is formed by adding er, the  superlative by adding est, to the positive; as, fair, fairer, fairest;  lovely, lovelier, loveliest; sweet, sweeter, sweetest; low, lower, lowest;  high, higher, highest.    Some words are irregularly compared; as, good, better, best; bad, worse,  worst; little, less, least; near, nearer, next; much, more, most; many (for  moe), more (for moer) most (for moest); late, later, latest or last.    Some comparatives form a superlative by adding, most, as nether,  nethermost; outer, outermost; under, undermost; up, upper, uppermost; fore,  former, foremost.    Most is sometimes added to a substantive, as, topmost, southmost.    Many adjectives do not admit of comparison by terminations, and are only  compared by more and most, as, benevolent, more benevolent, most  benevolent.    All adjectives may be compared by more and most, even when they have  comparatives and superlatives regularly formed; as, fair, fairer, or more  fair; fairest, or most fair.        In adjectives that admit a regular comparison, the comparative more is      oftener used than the superlative most, as more fair is oftener written      for fairer, than most fair for fairest.    The comparison of adjectives is very uncertain; and being much regulated by  commodiousness of utterance, or agreeableness of sound, is not easily  reduced to rules.    Monosyllables are commonly compared.    Polysyllables, or words of more than two syllables, are seldom compared  otherwise than by more and most, as, deplorable, more deplorable, most  deplorable.    Dissyllables are seldom compared if they terminate in some, as fulsome,  toilsome; in ful, as, careful, spleenful, dreadful; in ing, as trifling,  charming; in ous, as porous; in less, as, careless, harmless; in ed, as  wretched; in id, as candid; in al, as mortal; in ent, as recent, fervent;  in ain, as certain; in ive, as missive; in dy, as woody; in fy, as puffy;  in ky, as rocky, except lucky; in my, as roomy; in ny, as skinny; in py, as  ropy, except happy; in ry, as hoary.        Some comparatives and superlatives are yet found in good writers formed      without regard to the foregoing rules; but in a language subjected so      little and so lately to grammar, such anomalies must frequently occur.    So shady is compared by Milton.        She in shadiest covert hid,    Tun'd her nocturnal note.       Par. Lost.    And virtuous.        What she wills to say or do,    Seems wisest, virtuousest, discreetest, best.       Par. Lost.    So trifling by Ray, who is indeed of no great authority.        It is not so decorous, in respect of God, that he should immediately do      all the meanest and triflingest things himself, without making use of      any inferior or subordinate minister. Ray on the Creation.    Famous, by Milton.        I shall be nam'd among the famousest    Of women, sung at solemn festivals.       Milton's Agonistes.    Inventive, by Ascham.        Those have the inventivest heads for all purposes, and roundest tongues      in all matters. Ascham's Schoolmaster.    Mortal, by Bacon.        The mortalest poisons practised by the West Indians, have some mixture      of the blood, fat, or flesh of man. Bacon.    Natural, by Wotton.        I will now deliver a few of the properest and naturalest considerations      that belong to this piece. Wotton's Architecture.    Wretched, by Jonson.        The wretcheder are the contemners of all helps; such as presuming on      their own naturals, deride diligence, and mock at terms when they      understand not things. Ben Jonson.    Powerful, by Milton.      We have sustain'd one day in doubtful fight,    What heav'n's great king hath pow'rfullest to send    Against us from about his throne.       Par. Lost.        The termination in ish may be accounted in some sort a degree of      comparison, by which the signification is diminished below the      positive, as black, blackish, or tending to blackness; salt, saltish,      or having a little taste of salt; they therefore admit no comparison.      This termination is seldom added but to words expressing sensible      qualities, nor often to words of above one syllable, and is scarcely      used in the solemn or sublime style.           *       *       *       *       *    Of PRONOUNS.    Pronouns, in the English language, are, I, thou, he, with their plurals,  we, ye, they; it, who, which, what, whether, whosoever, whatsoever, my,  mine, our, ours, thy, thine, your, yours, his, her, hers, theirs, this,  that, other, another, the same, some.    The pronouns personal are irregularly inflected.                     Singular.   Plural.    Nom.             I,          We.    Accus. and       Me,         Us.  other oblique  cases.    Nom.             Thou,       Ye.    Oblique.         Thee,       You.    You is commonly used in modern writers for ye, particularly in the language  of ceremony, where the second person plural is used for the second person  singular, You are my friend.                     Singular.   Plural.    Nom.             He,         They,       Applied to masculines.    Oblique.         Him,        Them.    Nom.             She,        They,       Applied to feminines.    Oblique.         Her,        Them.    Nom.             It,         They,       Applied to neuters or things.    Oblique.         Its,        Them.    For it the practice of ancient writers was to use he, and for its, his.    The possessive pronouns, like other adjectives, are without cases or change  of termination.

Public utility of voyages--Peculiar circumstances of this--New Holland  properly a continent--Reasons for fixing our settlement  there--Transportation to America, its origin, advantages, and  cessation--Experiments made--The present plan adopted--Disadvantages of  other expedients.    From voyages undertaken expressly for the purpose of discovery, the  public naturally looks for information of various kinds: and it is a fact  which we cannot but contemplate with pleasure, that by the excellent  publications subsequent to such enterprises, very considerable additions  have been made, during the present reign, to our general knowledge of the  globe, of the various tribes by which it is peopled, and of the animals  and vegetables to which it gives support.    An expedition occasioned by motives of legislative policy, carried on by  public authority, and concluded by a fixed establishment in a country  very remote, not only excites an unusual interest concerning the fate of  those sent out, but promises to lead us to some points of knowledge  which, by the former mode, however judiciously employed, could not have  been attained. A transient visit to the coast of a great continent  cannot, in the nature of things, produce a complete information  respecting its inhabitants, productions, soil, or climate: all which when  contemplated by resident observers, in every possible circumstance of  variation, though they should be viewed with less philosophical  acuteness, must yet gradually become more fully known: Errors, sometimes  inseparable from hasty observation, will then be corrected by infallible  experience; and many objects will present themselves to view, which  before had escaped notice, or had happened to be so situated that they  could not be observed.    The full discovery of the extent of New Holland, by our illustrious  navigator, Capt. Cook, has formed a singular epocha in geography; a doubt  having arisen from it, whether to a land of such magnitude the name of  island or that of continent may more properly be applied. To this  question it may be answered, that though the etymology of the word  island,* and of others synonymous to it, points out only a land  surrounded by the sea, or by any water, (in which sense the term is  applicable even to the largest portions of the habitable globe) yet it is  certain that, in the usual acceptation, an island is conceived to signify  a land of only moderate extent, surrounded by the sea.** To define at what  point of magnitude precisely, a country so situated shall begin to be a  continent, could not answer any purpose of utility; but the best and  clearest rule for removing the doubt appears to be the following: As long  as the peculiar advantages of an insular situation can be enjoyed by the  inhabitants of such a country, let it have the title of an island; when  it exceeds those limits let it be considered as a continent. Now the  first and principal advantage of an island, is that of being capable of a  convenient union under one government, and of deriving thence a security  from all external attacks, except by sea. In lands of very great  magnitude such an union is difficult, if not impracticable, and a  distinction founded on this circumstance, is therefore sufficient for  convenience at least, if*** not for speculative accuracy. If we suppose  this extent to be something about one thousand miles each way, without,  however, affecting much rigour in the limitation, the claim of New  Holland to be called a continent, will be indisputable: The greatest  extent of that vast country being, from East to West, about two thousand  four hundred English miles, and, from North to South, not less than two  thousand three hundred.****    [* Insula, from which island is derived, is formed from in sulo, in the  sea; and, the corresponding word in Greek, is usually deduced from to  swim, as appearing, and probably having been originally supposed to swim  in the sea.]    [** Thus when Dionysius Periegetes considers the whole ancient world as  surrounded by the sea, "]]]
