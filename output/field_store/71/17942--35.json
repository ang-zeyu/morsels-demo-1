The church heard the last wish or will of the person  dying concerning who he wanted to have his property.    Every man carried a horn slung on his shoulder as he went about  his work so that he could at once send out a warning to his  fellow villagers or call them in chasing a thief or other  offender. The forests were full of outlaws, so strangers who did  not blow a horn to announce themselves were presumed to be  fugitive offenders who could be shot on sight. An eorl could call  upon the ceorl farmers for about forty days to fight off an  invading group.    The houses of the wealthy had ornamented silk hangings on the  walls. Brightly colored drapery, often purple, and fly-nets  surrounded their beds, which were covered with the fur of  animals. They slept in bed-clothes on pillows stuffed with  straw. Tables plated with silver and gems held silver  candlesticks, gold and silver goblets and cups, and lamps of  gold, silver, or glass. They used silver mirrors and silver  writing pens. There were covered seats, benches, and footstools  with the head and feet of animals at their extremities. They ate  from a table covered with a cloth. Servants brought in food on  spits, from which they ate. Food was boiled, broiled, or baked.  The wealthy ate wheat bread and others ate barley bread. Ale  made from barley was passed around in a cup. Mead made from  honey was also drunk.    Men wore long-sleeved wool and linen garments reaching almost to  the knee, around which they wore a belt tied in a knot. Men  often wore a gold ring on the fourth finger of the right hand.  Leather shoes were fastened with leather thongs around the  ankle. Their hair was parted in the middle and combed down each  side in waving ringlets. The beard was parted in the middle of  the chin, so that it ended in two points. The clergy did not  wear beards. Well-to-do women wore brightly colored robes with  waist bands, headbands, necklaces, gem bracelets, and rings.  Their long hair was in ringlets and they put rouge on their  cheeks. They were often doing needlework. Silk was affordable  only by the wealthy.    Most families kept a pig and pork was the primary meat. There  were also sheep, goats, cows, deer, rabbits, and fowl. Fowl was  obtained by fowlers who trapped them. The inland waters yielded  eels, salmon, and trout. In the fall, meat was salted to  preserve it for winter meals. There were orchards growing figs,  nuts, grapes, almonds, pears, and apples. Also produced were  beans, lentils, onions, eggs, cheese, and butter. Pepper and  cinnamon were imported.    Fishing from the sea developed in the 1000s A.D., and yielded  herrings, sturgeon, porpoise, oysters, crabs, and other fish.  Whale skins were used to make ropes.    It was usual to wash one's feet in a hot tub after traveling and  drying them with a rough wool cloth. Traveling a far distance  was unsafe as there were robbers on the roads. Traveling  strangers were distrusted. There were superstitions about the  content of dreams, the events of the moon, and the flights and  voices of birds were often seen as signs or omens of future  events. Herbal mixtures were drunk for sickness and maladies.    In the peaceful latter part of the 600s, Theodore, who had been a  monk in Rome, was appointed Archbishop and visited all the  island speaking about the right rule of life and ordaining  bishops to oversee the priests. There was a bishop for each of  the kingdoms. The bishops came to have the same wergeld as an  eorldorman: 1200 s., which was the price of about 500 oxen. A  priest had the wergeld as a landholding farmer [thegn], or 300s.  The bishops spoke Latin, but the priests of the local parishes  spoke English. Theodore was the first archbishop whom all the  English church obeyed. He taught sacred and secular literature,  the books of holy writ, ecclesiastical poetry, astronomy,  arithmetic, and sacred music. The learned ecclesiastical life  flourished in monasteries. Theodore discouraged slavery by  denying Christian burial to the kidnapper and forbidding the  sale of children over the age of seven. Hilda, a noble's  daughter, became the first nun in Northumbria and abbess of one  of its monasteries. There she taught justice, piety, chastity,  peace, and charity. Several monks taught there later became  bishops. Kings and princes often asked her advice.    There were several kingdoms. Kings were selected from the royal  family by their worthiness. A King had not only a wergeld to be  paid to his family if he were killed, but a \"cynebot\" that would  be paid to his kingdom. A King's household would have a  chamberlain, marshall to oversee the horses and military  equipment, a steward, and a cupbearer. A queen could possess,  manage, and dispose of lands in her name. Great men wore  gold-embroidered clothes, gilt buckles and brooches, and drank  from drinking horns mounted in silver-gilt or in gold. Their  wives had beads, pins, needles, tweezers of bronze, and  work-boxes of bronze, some highly ornamented.    Danish Vikings made several invasions in the 800s for which a  danegeld tax on land was assessed on everyone every ten to  twenty years. It was stored in a strong box under the King's  bed. King Alfred the Great unified the country to defeat them.  He established fortifications called \"burhs\", usually on hill  tops or other strategic locations on the borders to control the  main road and river routes into Wessex. The burhs were the first  towns. They were typically walled enclosures with towers and  several wooden thatched huts and a couple of churches inside.  Earthen oil lamps were in use. The land area protected by each  burh became known as a \"shire\". The country was inhabited by  Anglo-Saxons and was called \"Angle-land\", which later became  \"England\".    Alfred gathered together fighting men who were at his disposal,  which included eorldormen's hearthband (men each of whom had  chosen to swear to fight to the death for their eorldorman, and  some of whom were of high rank), shire thegns (local landholding  farmers, who were required to bring fighting equipment such as  swords, helmets, chainmail, and horses), and ordinary freemen,  i.e. ceorls (who carried food, dug fortifications, and sometimes  fought). Some great lords organized men under them, whom they  provisioned. These vassals took a personal oath to their lord  \"on condition that he keep me as I am willing to deserve, and  fulfill all that was agreed on when I became his man, and chose  his will as mine.\" Alfred had a small navy of longships with 60  oars to fight the Viking longships.    Alfred divided his army into two parts so that one-half of the  men were fighting while the other half was at home sowing and  harvesting for those fighting. Thus, any small-scale independent  farming was supplanted by the open-field system, cultivation of  common land, and a more manor-oriented and stratified society  with the King and important families more powerful and the  peasants more curtailed. Many free coerls of the older days  became bonded. The village community became a manor. But the  lord does not have the power to encroach upon the rights of  common that exist within the community.    In 886, a treaty between Alfred and the Vikings divided the  country along the war front and made the wergeld of every free  farmer, whether English or Viking, 200s. Men of higher rank were  given a wergeld of 4 1/2 marks of pure gold. A mark was probably  a Viking denomination and a mark of gold was equal to nine marks  of silver in later times and probably in this time.    King Alfred gave land with jurisdictional powers within its  boundaries such as the following: \"This is the bequest which  King Alfred make unequivocally to Shaftesbury, to the praise of  God and St. Mary and all the saints of God, for the benefit of my  soul, namely a hundred hides [a hide was probably the amount of  land which could support a family for a year or as much land as  could be tilled annually by a single plow] as they stand with  their produce and their men, and my daughter AEthelgifu to the  convent along with the inheritance, since she took the veil on  account of bad health; and the jurisdiction to the convent, which  I myself possessed, namely obstruction and attacks on a man's  house and breach of protection. And the estates which I have  granted to the foundation are 40 hides at Donhead and Compton,  20 hides at Handley and Gussage 10 hides at Tarrant, 15 hides at  Iwerve and 15 hides at Fontmell.    The witnesses of this are Edward my son and Archbishop AEthelred  and Bishop Ealhferth and Bishop AEthelhead and Earl Wulfhere and  Earl Eadwulf and Earl Cuthred and Abbot Tunberht and Milred my  thegn and AEthelwulf and Osric and Brihtulf and Cyma. If anyone  alters this, he shall have the curse of God and St. Mary and all  the saints of God forever to all eternity. Amen.\"    Sons usually succeeded their fathers on the same land as shown by  this lifetime lease: \"Bishop Denewulf and the community at  Winchester lease to Alfred for his lifetime 40 hides of land at  Alresford, in accordance with the lease which Bishop Tunbriht  had granted to his parents and which had run out, on condition  that he renders every year at the autumnal equinox three pounds  as rent, and church dues, and the work connected with church  dues; and when the need arises, his men shall be ready both for  harvesting and hunting; and after his death the property shall  pass undisputed to St. Peter's.    These are the signatures of the councilors and of the members of  the community who gave their consent, namely ...\"    Alfred wrote poems on the worthiness of wisdom and knowledge in  preference to material pleasures, pride, and fame, in dealing  with life's sorrow and strife.

He, verily,  through the potency of His name, the Mighty, the All-Powerful, the Most  High, is the ruler of all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth.            XII: BESTIR YOURSELVES, O PEOPLE, IN ANTICIPATION OF...      Bestir yourselves, O people, in anticipation of the days of Divine  justice, for the promised hour is now come. Beware lest ye fail to  apprehend its import and be accounted among the erring.            XIII: CONSIDER THE PAST. HOW MANY, BOTH HIGH AND...      Consider the past. How many, both high and low, have, at all times,  yearningly awaited the advent of the Manifestations of God in the  sanctified persons of His chosen Ones. How often have they expected His  coming, how frequently have they prayed that the breeze of Divine mercy  might blow, and the promised Beauty step forth from behind the veil of  concealment, and be made manifest to all the world. And whensoever the  portals of grace did open, and the clouds of divine bounty did rain upon  mankind, and the light of the Unseen did shine above the horizon of  celestial might, they all denied Him, and turned away from His face--the  face of God Himself....    Reflect, what could have been the motive for such deeds? What could have  prompted such behavior towards the Revealers of the beauty of the  All-Glorious? Whatever in days gone by hath been the cause of the denial  and opposition of those people hath now led to the perversity of the  people of this age. To maintain that the testimony of Providence was  incomplete, that it hath therefore been the cause of the denial of the  people, is but open blasphemy. How far from the grace of the All-Bountiful  and from His loving providence and tender mercies it is to single out a  soul from amongst all men for the guidance of His creatures, and, on one  hand, to withhold from Him the full measure of His divine testimony, and,  on the other, inflict severe retribution on His people for having turned  away from His chosen One! Nay, the manifold bounties of the Lord of all  beings have, at all times, through the Manifestations of His Divine  Essence, encompassed the earth and all that dwell therein. Not for a  moment hath His grace been withheld, nor have the showers of His  loving-kindness ceased to rain upon mankind. Consequently, such behavior  can be attributed to naught save the petty-mindedness of such souls as  tread the valley of arrogance and pride, are lost in the wilds of  remoteness, walk in the ways of their idle fancy, and follow the dictates  of the leaders of their faith. Their chief concern is mere opposition;  their sole desire is to ignore the truth. Unto every discerning observer  it is evident and manifest that had these people in the days of each of  the Manifestations of the Sun of Truth sanctified their eyes, their ears,  and their hearts from whatever they had seen, heard, and felt, they surely  would not have been deprived of beholding the beauty of God, nor strayed  far from the habitations of glory. But having weighed the testimony of God  by the standard of their own knowledge, gleaned from the teachings of the  leaders of their faith, and found it at variance with their limited  understanding, they arose to perpetrate such unseemly acts....    Consider Moses! Armed with the rod of celestial dominion, adorned with the  white hand of Divine knowledge, and proceeding from the Paran of the love  of God, and wielding the serpent of power and everlasting majesty, He  shone forth from the Sinai of light upon the world. He summoned all the  peoples and kindreds of the earth to the kingdom of eternity, and invited  them to partake of the fruit of the tree of faithfulness. Surely you are  aware of the fierce opposition of Pharaoh and his people, and of the  stones of idle fancy which the hands of infidels cast upon that blessed  Tree. So much so that Pharaoh and his people finally arose and exerted  their utmost endeavor to extinguish with the waters of falsehood and  denial the fire of that sacred Tree, oblivious of the truth that no  earthly water can quench the flames of Divine wisdom, nor mortal blasts  extinguish the lamp of everlasting dominion. Nay, rather, such water  cannot but intensify the burning of the flame, and such blasts cannot but  ensure the preservation of the lamp, were ye to observe with the eye of  discernment, and walk in the way of God's holy will and pleasure....    And when the days of Moses were ended, and the light of Jesus, shining  forth from the Day Spring of the Spirit, encompassed the world, all the  people of Israel arose in protest against Him. They clamored that He Whose  advent the Bible had foretold must needs promulgate and fulfil the laws of  Moses, whereas this youthful Nazarene, who laid claim to the station of  the divine Messiah, had annulled the laws of divorce and of the sabbath  day--the most weighty of all the laws of Moses. Moreover, what of the signs  of the Manifestation yet to come? These people of Israel are even unto the  present day still expecting that Manifestation which the Bible hath  foretold! How many Manifestations of Holiness, how many Revealers of the  light everlasting, have appeared since the time of Moses, and yet Israel,  wrapt in the densest veils of satanic fancy and false imaginings, is still  expectant that the idol of her own handiwork will appear with such signs  as she herself hath conceived! Thus hath God laid hold of them for their  sins, hath extinguished in them the spirit of faith, and tormented them  with the flames of the nethermost fire. And this for no other reason  except that Israel refused to apprehend the meaning of such words as have  been revealed in the Bible concerning the signs of the coming Revelation.  As she never grasped their true significance, and, to outward seeming,  such events never came to pass, she, therefore, remained deprived of  recognizing the beauty of Jesus and of beholding the Face of God. And they  still await His coming! From time immemorial even unto this day, all the  kindreds and peoples of the earth have clung to such fanciful and unseemly  thoughts, and thus have deprived themselves of the clear waters streaming  from the springs of purity and holiness....    To them that are endowed with understanding, it is clear and manifest  that, when the fire of the love of Jesus consumed the veils of Jewish  limitations, and His authority was made apparent and partially enforced,  He, the Revealer of the unseen Beauty, addressing one day His disciples,  referred unto His passing, and, kindling in their hearts the fire of  bereavement, said unto them: \"I go away and come again unto you.\" And in  another place He said: \"I go and another will come, Who will tell you all  that I have not told you, and will fulfil all that I have said.\" Both  these sayings have but one meaning, were ye to ponder upon the  Manifestations of the Unity of God with Divine insight.    Every discerning observer will recognize that in the Dispensation of the  Qur'an both the Book and the Cause of Jesus were confirmed. As to the  matter of names, Muhammad, Himself, declared: \"I am Jesus.\" He recognized  the truth of the signs, prophecies, and words of Jesus, and testified that  they were all of God. In this sense, neither the person of Jesus nor His  writings hath differed from that of Muhammad and of His holy Book,  inasmuch as both have championed the Cause of God, uttered His praise, and  revealed His commandments. Thus it is that Jesus, Himself, declared: \"I go  away and come again unto you.\" Consider the sun. Were it to say now, \"I am  the sun of yesterday,\" it would speak the truth. And should it, bearing  the sequence of time in mind, claim to be other than that sun, it still  would speak the truth. In like manner, if it be said that all the days are  but one and the same, it is correct and true. And if it be said, with  respect to their particular names and designations, that they differ, that  again is true. For though they are the same, yet one doth recognize in  each a separate designation, a specific attribute, a particular character.  Conceive accordingly the distinction, variation, and unity characteristic  of the various Manifestations of holiness, that thou mayest comprehend the  allusions made by the Creator of all names and attributes to the mysteries  of distinction and unity, and discover the answer to thy question as to  why that everlasting Beauty should have, at sundry times, called Himself  by different names and titles....    When the Unseen, the Eternal, the Divine Essence, caused the Day Star of  Muhammad to rise above the horizon of knowledge, among the cavils which  the Jewish divines raised against Him was that after Moses no Prophet  should be sent of God. Yea, mention hath been made in the Scriptures of a  Soul Who must needs be made manifest and Who will advance the Faith, and  promote the interests of the people of Moses, so that the Law of the  Mosaic Dispensation may encompass the whole earth. Thus hath the King of  eternal glory referred in His Book to the words uttered by those wanderers  in the vale of remoteness and error: \"'The hand of God,' say the Jews, 'is  chained up.' Chained up be their own hands; And for that which they have  said, they were accursed. Nay, outstretched are both His hands!\" \"The hand  of God is above their hands.\" Although the commentators of the Qur'an have  related in divers manners the circumstances attending the revelation of  this verse, yet thou shouldst endeavor to apprehend the purpose thereof.  He saith: How false is that which the Jews have imagined! How can the hand  of Him Who is the King in truth, Who caused the countenance of Moses to be  made manifest, and conferred upon Him the robe of Prophethood--how can the  hand of such a One be chained and fettered? How can He be conceived as  powerless to raise up yet another Messenger after Moses? Behold the"]]]
