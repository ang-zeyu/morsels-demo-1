Why, I'm a home  again!\" But suddenly he remembered that his own happiness had made  him forget all about his old friend's troubles; and he tried his best  to look serious, as he said: \"But what about YOU? Are the white-ants  still troubling you?\"    \"Ah!\" replied the Blue-gum. \"Don't let that worry you. Yesterday I  had a talk with the doctor--Doctor Tree-creeper, you know--a very  clever little bird he is, and he knows all about white-ants. He  examined me thoroughly all over. He says that they have hardly got  under my skin yet, and he will have them all out in a couple of days.  So THAT'S all right.\"    \"Well, I am glad,\" shouted the Little Red House. \"Now we are ALL happy!\"    Then Sym got the fire started, and the smoke curled up, and the Little  House had his gay blue feather once again. Sym began to sing his  Tinker's Song louder than ever, and Emily Ann, who was getting the  meal ready, joined in and sang too. Very soon the kettle also began  to sing, and, when the pan heard that HE began to sing. Then Doctor  Tree-creeper arrived to attend to the white-ants, and, as he walked  round the trunk of the big Blue-gum, tapping it just like a doctor,  HE began to sing. And two Kookaburras, who were sitting on the fence,  were so tickled with it all, that they laughed and laughed till they  made everyone else laugh with them.    \"This is quite like old times,\" laughed the big Blue-gum. \"Are you  contented now?\"    \"Am I contented?\" cried the Little Red House. \"Am I contented? Well,  what would you think?\"    And then--well, most ordinary grown-up folk would tell you that just  then Emily Ann drew down one of the front blinds. But all the big  Blue-gum knew, and all you and I know, is that the Little Red House  winked.    And when I saw him last, his smile was as broad as ever, and he was  still winking.        THE PIEMAN    I'd like to be a pieman, and ring a little bell,  Calling out, \"Hot pies! Hot pies to sell!\"  Apple-pies and Meat-pies, Cherry-pies as well,  Lots and lots and lots of pies--more than you can tell.  Big, rich Pork-pies! Oh, the lovely smell!     But I wouldn't be a pieman if . . .         I wasn't very well.           Would you?        THE TRIANTIWONTIGONGOLOPE    There's a very funny insect that you do not often spy,  And it isn't quite a spider, and it isn't quite a fly;  It is something like a beetle, and a little like a bee,  But nothing like a wooly grub that climbs upon a tree.  Its name is quite a hard one, but you'll learn it soon, I hope.  So try:     Tri-        Tri-anti-wonti-           Triantiwontigongolope.    It lives on weeds and wattle-gum, and has a funny face;  Its appetite is hearty, and its manners a disgrace.  When first you come upon it, it will give you quite a scare,  But when you look for it again, you find it isn't there.  And unless you call it softly it will stay away and mope.  So try:     Tri-        Tri-anti-wonti-           Triantiwontigongolope.    It trembles if you tickle it or tread upon its toes;  It is not an early riser, but it has a snubbish nose.  If you snear at it, or scold it, it will scuttle off in shame,  But it purrs and purrs quite proudly if you call it by its name,  And offer it some sandwiches of sealing-wax and soap.  So try:     Tri-        Tri-anti-wonti-           Triantiwontigongolope .    But of course you haven't seen it; and I truthfully confess  That I haven't seen it either, and I don't know its address.  For there isn't such an insect, though there really might have been  If the trees and grass were purple, and the sky was bottle green.  It's just a little joke of mine, which you'll forgive, I hope.  Oh, try!     Tri-        Tri-anti-wonti-           Triantiwontigongolope.        THE CIRCUS    Hey, there!  Hoop-la! the circus is in town!  Have you seen the elephant?  Have you seen the clown?  Have you seen the dappled horse gallop round the ring?  Have you seen the acrobats on the dizzy swing?  Have you seen the tumbling men tumble up and down?  Hoop-la!  Hoop-la! the circus is in town!    Hey, there!  Hoop-la!  Here's the circus troupe!  Here's the educated dog, jumping through the hoop.  See the lady Blondin with the parasol and fan,  The lad upon the ladder and the india-rubber man.  See the joyful juggler and the boy who loops the loop.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Here's the circus troupe!        YOU AND I    They say the eagle is a bird  That sees some splendid sights  When he soars high into the sky  Upon his dizzy flights:  He sees the ground for miles around  Our house, and Billy Johnson's;  But we cannot be eagles, for  That would, of course, be nonsense.    But you and I, some summer day,  Providing we're allowed,  Will go up in an aeroplane  And sail right through a cloud.  But, if they say we may not go,  We'll stay upon the ground  With other things that have no wings,  And watch them walk around.    They say the bottom of the sea  Is beautiful to view;  They say the fish, whene'er they wish,  Can sail and see it, too;  The shining pearls, the coral curls,  The sharks, the squids, the schnappers,  And fish with fins (though not in tins)  And fish with funny flappers.    But you and I, some sunny day,  When weather's in condition,  Will go there in a submarine,  Providing we've permission.    But if they say we may not go  We must respect their wishes;  And you and I will just keep dry  Because we are not fishes.    The earth is quite a jolly place,  And we don't care for flying;  And things that creep down in the deep  Are sometimes rather trying.  So, if they'll grant a holiday  Or even only half,  We'll lie upon some grassy place,  And think of things, and laugh.        GOING TO SCHOOL    Did you see them pass to-day, Billy, Kate and Robin,  All astride upon the back of old grey Dobbin?  Jigging, jogging off to school, down the dusty track--  What must Dobbin think of it--three upon his back?  Robin at the bridle-rein, in the middle Kate,  Billy holding on behind, his legs out straight.    Now they're coming back from school, jig, jog, jig.  See them at the corner where the gums grow big;  Dobbin flicking off the flies and blinking at the sun--  Having three upon his back he thinks is splendid fun:  Robin at the bridle-rein, in the middle Kate,  Little Billy up behind, his legs out straight.        HIST!    Hist! . . . . . . Hark!  The night is very dark,  And we've to go a mile or so  Across the Possum Park.    Step . . . . . . light,  Keeping to the right;  If we delay, and lose our way,  We'll be out half the night.  The clouds are low and gloomy. Oh!  It's just begun to mist!  We haven't any overcoats  And--Hist! . . . . . . Hist!    (Mo . . . . . . poke!)  Who was that that spoke?  This is not a fitting spot  To make a silly joke.    Dear . . . . . . me!  A mopoke in a tree!  It jarred me so, I didn't know  Whatever it could be.  But come along; creep along;  Soon we shall be missed.  They'll get a scare and wonder where  We--Hush! . . . . . . Hist!    Ssh! . . . . . . Soft!  I've told you oft and oft  We should not stray so far away  Without a moon aloft.    Oo! . . . . . . Scat!  Goodness! What was that?  Upon my word, it's quite absurd,  It's only just a cat.  But come along; haste along;  Soon we'll have to rush,  Or we'll be late and find the gate  Is--Hist! . . . . . . Hush!    (Kok!. . . . . . Korrock!)  Oh! I've had a shock!  I hope and trust it's only just  A frog behind a rock.    Shoo! . . . . . . Shoo!  We've had enough of you;  Scaring folk just for a joke  Is not the thing to do.  But come along, slip along--  Isn't it a lark  Just to roam so far from home  On--Hist! . . . . . . Hark!    Look! . . . . . . See!  Shining through the tree,  The window-light is glowing bright  To welcome you and me.    Shout! . . . . . . Shout!  There's someone round about,  And through the door I see some more  And supper all laid out.  Now, run! Run! Run!  Oh, we've had such splendid fun--  Through the park in the dark,  As brave as anyone.    Laughed, we did, and chaffed, we did,  And whistled all the way,  And we're home again! Home again!  Hip . . . . . . Hooray!        BIRD SONG    I am friendly with the sparrow  Though his mind is rather narrow     And his manners--well, the less we say the better.  But as day begins to peep,  When I hear his cheery \"Cheep\"     I am ready to admit I am his debtor    I delight in red-browed finches  And all birds of scanty inches.     Willie wagtail is a pleasant bird, and coy.  All the babblers, chats and wrens,  Tits and robins, and their hens,     Are my very special friends, and bring me joy.        THE MUSIC OF YOUR VOICE    A vase upon the mantelpiece,     A ship upon the sea,  A goat upon a mountain-top     Are much the same to me;  But when you mention melon jam,     Or picnics by the creek,  Or apple pies, or pantomimes,     I love to hear you speak.    The date of Magna Charta or     The doings of the Dutch,  Or capes, or towns, or verbs, or nouns     Do not excite me much;  But when you mention motor rides--     Down by the sea for choice  Or chasing games, or chocolates,     I love to hear your voice.        THE BOY WHO RODE INTO THE SUNSET    Once upon a time--it was not so very long ago, either--a little boy,  named Neville, lived with his people in a house which was almost in  the country. That is to say, it was just at the edge of the city; and  at the back of the house was a rather large hill, which was quite  bald.    Neville, who was fond of playing by himself, would often wander to the  top of the bald hill; and if he stood right on top of it and looked  one way, toward the East, he could see right over the city, with all  its tall buildings and domes and spires and smoking chimneys. But  looking the other way, to the West, he could"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16255"],[0,"Dickey Downy: The Autobiography of a Bird (#4)"],[1,"s, and perhaps just as they have accomplished  the weary task he suddenly proclaims a new law, and all this toiling  and drudging and stinting must begin over again.  In this way the  unhappy creatures have never a breathing spell.  It is utterly  impossible for them to conform to the new law when it is first  proclaimed by the god, and so they are always struggling to keep up.  Their chains are never lifted or lightened a particle.\"    \"If the chain is so heavy why don't they break it?\" I asked impatiently.    \"Because they are afraid,\" she replied.    \"Afraid of the god?\"    \"No, no, child, they are afraid of each other.  They are afraid the  richer slaves, who are able to comply with the demands will laugh at  them and ridicule them, and that is why they strain every nerve to  follow the god's wishes.  A slave, whether she is rich or poor, grows  more cringing year by year, until at last she loses all her  individuality, and becomes a mere echo of the god.\"    \"What about the slaves who rebel at first and afterward yield?\"    \"Oh, they denounce the god very severely when he lays down some new law  they don't happen to like, but as all the other slaves are obediently  complying with it they dislike to be set off by themselves as  different, and so they reluctantly give in after a time.  Sometimes  they try to compromise with the god by going half-way.\"    I inquired what the other slaves thought of that.    \"They mildly tolerate them,\" said she.  \"Sometimes they look askance at  them when they meet, and try to show their superiority as being  obedient, full-blooded, genuine slaves, while the others are only  lukewarm servants of the monarch!\"    I wondered how the slaves regarded the woman who was independent and  wouldn't worship the god.    My mother twittered softly at my question, and I knew she was smiling  to herself.  \"Why,\" said she, \"they call that kind of a woman a  crank--whatever that is.\"    It was very evident that this god Fashion was a cruel tyrant, and it  was clearly through his influence that we were killed, and I so told my  mother.  She looked very sorrowful as she replied:    \"Yes, the women do not hate us.  They do not dislike to hear our pretty  songs; they have no revenge to gratify; but the god orders them to have  us killed, and they do it.  He tells them that to wear our poor  mutilated dead bodies will add to their appearance, and so we are  sacrificed on the altar of their vanity and silly pride.  As members of  humane societies women have denounced the docking of horses' tails as  cruel, but from what I know of woman's indifference to the sufferings  of the innocent birds, I venture to assert that were Fashion to say  that she should trim her cloak with horse tails there would not be left  an undocked horse in the country.\"    I knew my mother was very excited or she would never have been so  vehement.    \"Just hear how those birds twitter,\" remarked one of the ladies,  looking up into our tree.  \"One would think they were holding an  indignation meeting over something.\"    \"Yes, the dear little things; I love to hear them chirp,\" commented  Miss Katie, turning a sweet glance toward us, and then the party moved  to go and we saw the six hats loaded with their mournful freight file  off to the house.  We followed the retreating hats with sad eyes till  they were lost to view.    My brother broke the silence by asking, \"Are there any Christian women  who wear birds, and are among the god's worshipers?\"    My mother's manner grew very grave and solemn.  \"That is not for me to  say,\" she replied.  \"They know whether they are guiltless of our  wholesale slaughter, and they know too, how the gentle, merciful Christ  regarded us when he declared that 'not a sparrow is forgotten before  God.'\"          CHAPTER IV    DICKEY'S COUSINS    Another of my airy creatures breathes such sweet music out of her  little instrumental throat that it might make mankind to think that  miracles are not ceased.  We might well be lifted up above the earth  and say, Lord, what music hast thou provided for the saints in heaven,  when thou affordest bad men such music on earth?--_Izaak Walton._      The fine pasture adjoining was a popular resort for some handsome birds  that often visited it as a playground.  They were said to be relatives  of ours, but I do not think they were closer than seventh or eighth  cousins, which is so distant that it doesn't count--especially if one  doesn't want it to.    All I know is that their family name was the same as ours, _Icteridae_,  and means something or other, I forget what.  It was a good honorable  name, however, and our branch was as proud of our ancestry as any  Daughter of the American Revolution could possibly be.    There were some tall weeds growing along the margin of a little stream  in the pasture which produced quantities of delicious seeds, and to  these we often repaired when we wanted a choice breakfast, as well as  to watch the playful pastimes of these queer bipeds.    What would you think of a bird taking a bareback ride on a cow?   They  were extremely fond of settling themselves on the cattle which browsed  in the field and presented a truly comical picture as they complacently  gathered in little groups on the backs of those huge animals.  Moving  slowly along munching the dewy grass, first on one side, then on the  other, the cows did not seem particularly to mind their saucy bareback  riders.  Occasionally they would toss their heads backward, when up all  the birds would fly into the air only to descend again as soon as the  cattle were quiet.    As I said, they were very handsome.  At a short distance they looked to  be clothed in black, but the breast and neck were really a very rich  brown, with the rest of the body like jet and as lustrous as satin.  They were not general favorites with the other birds on account of some  dishonorable tricks which they did on the sly.  For instance, they  never troubled themselves to make nests, but watched their chance to  sneak in and lay their eggs, only one in a place, in the nests of other  birds.  For some reason their eggs always hatch a little sooner than  the eggs rightfully belonging there, consequently the foster-parents,  not knowing of the deception, are quite delighted with the first little  one that comes out of the shell, and immediately fly off to get food  for it.  This is very unfortunate, for during their absence their own  eggs get cold and will not hatch.  After a time the old birds grow  disgusted and tumble the poor eggs all out of the nest and bestow their  whole attention to the juvenile cowbird, entirely ignorant of the fact  that they are the victims of a \"put-up job.\"    Once when we were dining in the pasture we found out the cause of the  booming noise we had often heard sounding through the woods.  Two men,  each carrying in his hand a long club, shaped large at one end,  appeared in the meadow and began looking among the long grasses which  sheltered the nests of some meadow larks.  A number of the larks were  on the wing, others sat on the rail fence rolling out cadenzas in  concert in a gush of melody from their downy throats.  The men moved  cautiously nearer under cover of the weeds.  Raising their long clubs  to their shoulders they gazed along their narrow points a moment.  Without exactly knowing why, we took alarm, and larks, bobolinks, and  cowbirds sped upward like the wind.  At the same instant something  bright shimmered in the sunlight, and with it a horrid burst of noise  and a puff of smoke.  We did not all get away, for some of the  beautiful larks fell to the ground pierced by the sportsman's deadly  hail.    Again and again, all through that long, sad day we heard the ominous  booming crash, and knew the savage work of killing was going on.    Among our acquaintances was a lame redbird who at one time had been  trapped and made a prisoner, confined behind the bars of a wire cell  for many weeks and months.  Luckily he made his escape one day when his  grated door was accidentally opened, and he speedily made his way back  to his dearly loved forest.    During the period of his imprisonment in the city he had picked up a  great deal of information regarding the bird trade, and some of the  facts recited by him of the terrible cruelties perpetrated and the  carnage which had been going on for years, almost caused our feathers  to stand upright in horror as we listened.          CHAPTER V    \"DON'T, JOHNNY\"      Farewell happy fields, where Joy forever dwells.            --_Milton._      A very pleasant, sociable fellow was this redbird, and often when on  hot afternoons we were hiding in the treetops from the rays of the sun  he told us stories and anecdotes about the people he had seen while he  lived in the city.    He and his brother had been caught in a trap in the woods set by a  farmer's boy.  One cold spring morning when the boy came to look at his  trap he was overjoyed to find he had snared two redbirds, and forthwith  carried them to the village nearby and sold them to the grocer for five  cents apiece, which sum he said he was going to invest in a rubber ball.    As he put the dime into his coat pocket he told the man that one of the  birds was named Admiral Dewey and the other Napoleon Bonaparte.  The  groceryman agreed that these names were good enough names for anybody,  but he thought he'd change Bonaparte's name to Teddy Roosevelt, as  being easier to pronounce, and the two birds were accordingly given  these titles then and there.  Not having any cage at hand to put them  in, the man thought that for a few days the new-comers could share the  quarters of an old sparrow he had in the rear end of the store until an  extra cage could be procured.    But alas for Teddy Roosevelt!  The very first night he was  ignominiously whipped by the spiteful occupant of the cage, who  resented having these country visitors thrust into his house without  "]]]
