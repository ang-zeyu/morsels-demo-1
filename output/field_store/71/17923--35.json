Diversity of feelings and opinions very often brings  about dissensions between friends, between countrymen, between  religious and godly men.    3. Established custom is not easily relinquished, and no man is  very easily led to see with the eyes of another.  If thou rest  more upon thy own reason or experience than upon the power of  Jesus Christ, thy light shall come slowly and hardly; for God  willeth us to be perfectly subject unto Himself, and all our  reason to be exalted by abundant love towards Him.      CHAPTER XV    Of works of charity    For no worldly good whatsoever, and for the love of no man, must  anything be done which is evil, but for the help of the suffering  a good work must sometimes be postponed, or be changed for a  better; for herein a good work is not destroyed, but improved.  Without charity no work profiteth, but whatsoever is done in  charity, however small and of no reputation it be, bringeth forth  good fruit; for God verily considereth what a man is able to do,  more than the greatness of what he doth.    2. He doth much who loveth much.  He doth much who doth well.  He  doth well who ministereth to the public good rather than to his  own.  Oftentimes that seemeth to be charity which is rather  carnality, because it springeth from natural inclination,  self-will, hope of repayment, desire of gain.    3. He who hath true and perfect charity, in no wise seeketh his  own good, but desireth that God alone be altogether glorified.  He envieth none, because he longeth for no selfish joy; nor doth  he desire to rejoice in himself, but longeth to be blessed in God  as the highest good.  He ascribeth good to none save to God only,  the Fountain whence all good proceedeth, and the End, the Peace,  the joy of all Saints.  Oh, he who hath but a spark of true  charity, hath verily learned that all worldly things are full of  vanity.    CHAPTER XVI    Of bearing with the faults of others    Those things which a man cannot amend in himself or in others, he  ought patiently to bear, until God shall otherwise ordain.  Bethink thee that perhaps it is better for thy trial and  patience, without which our merits are but little worth.  Nevertheless thou oughtest, when thou findeth such impediments,  to beseech God that He would vouchsafe to sustain thee, that thou  be able to bear them with a good will.    2. If one who is once or twice admonished refuse to hearken,  strive not with him, but commit all to God, that His will may be  done and His honour be shown in His servants, for He knoweth well  how to convert the evil unto good.  Endeavour to be patient in  bearing with other men's faults and infirmities whatsoever they  be, for thou thyself also hast many things which have need to be  borne with by others.  If thou canst not make thine own self what  thou desireth, how shalt thou be able to fashion another to thine  own liking.  We are ready to see others made perfect, and yet we  do not amend our own shortcomings.    3. We will that others be straitly corrected, but we will not be  corrected ourselves.  The freedom of others displeaseth us, but  we are dissatisfied that our own wishes shall be denied us.  We  desire rules to be made restraining others, but by no means will  we suffer ourselves to be restrained.  Thus therefore doth it  plainly appear how seldom we weigh our neighbour in the same  balance with ourselves. If all men were perfect, what then should  we have to suffer from others for God?    4. But now hath God thus ordained, that we may learn to bear one  another's burdens, because none is without defect, none without a  burden, none sufficient of himself, none wise enough of himself;  but it behoveth us to bear with one another, to comfort one  another, to help, instruct, admonish one another.  How much  strength each man hath is best proved by occasions of adversity:  for such occasions do not make a man frail, but show of what  temper he is.      CHAPTER XVII    Of a religious life    It behoveth thee to learn to mortify thyself in many things, if  thou wilt live in amity and concord with other men.  It is no  small thing to dwell in a religious community or congregation,  and to live there without complaint, and therein to remain  faithful even unto death.  Blessed is he who hath lived a good  life in such a body, and brought it to a happy end.  If thou wilt  stand fast and wilt profit as thou oughtest, hold thyself as an  exile and a pilgrim upon the earth.  Thou wilt have to be counted  as a fool for Christ, if thou wilt lead a religious life.    2. The clothing and outward appearance are of small account; it  is change of character and entire mortification of the affections  which make a truly religious man.  He who seeketh aught save God  and the health of his soul, shall find only tribulation and  sorrow.  Nor can he stand long in peace, who striveth not to be  least of all and servant of all.    3. Thou art called to endure and to labour, not to a life of ease  and trifling talk.  Here therefore are men tried as gold in the  furnace.  No man can stand, unless with all his heart he will  humble himself for God's sake.      CHAPTER XVIII    Of the example of the Holy Fathers    Consider now the lively examples of the holy fathers, in whom  shone forth real perfectness and religion, and thou shalt see how  little, even as nothing, is all that we do.  Ah! What is our life  when compared to theirs?  They, saints and friends of Christ as  they were, served the Lord in hunger and thirst, in cold and  nakedness, in labour and weariness, in watchings and fastings, in  prayer and holy meditations, in persecutions and much rebuke.    2. O how many and grievous tribulations did the Apostles,  Martyrs, Confessors, Virgins, endure; and all others who would  walk in the footsteps of Christ. For they hated their souls in  this world that they might keep them unto life eternal.  O how  strict and retired a life was that of the holy fathers who dwelt  in the desert!  what long and grievous temptations they did  suffer!  how often were they assaulted by the enemy!  what  frequent and fervid prayers did they offer unto God!  what strict  fasts did they endure!  what fervent zeal and desire after  spiritual profit did they manifest!  how bravely did they fight  that their vices might not gain the mastery!  how entirely and  steadfastly did they reach after God!  By day they laboured, and  at night they gave themselves ofttimes unto prayer; yea, even  when they were labouring they ceased not from mental prayer.    3. They spent their whole time profitably; every hour seemed  short for retirement with God; and through the great sweetness of  contemplation, even the need of bodily refreshment was forgotten.  They renounced all riches, dignities, honours, friends, kinsmen;  they desired nothing from the world; they ate the bare  necessaries of life; they were unwilling to minister to the body  even in necessity.  Thus were they poor in earthly things, but  rich above measure in grace and virtue.  Though poor to the outer  eye, within they were filled with grace and heavenly  benedictions.    4. They were strangers to the world, but unto God they were as  kinsmen and friends.  They seemed unto themselves as of no  reputation, and in the world's eyes contemptible; but in the  sight of God they were precious and beloved.  They stood fast in  true humility, they lived in simple obedience, they walked in  love and patience; and thus they waxed strong in spirit, and  obtained great favour before God.  To all religious men they were  given as an example, and they ought more to provoke us unto good  livings than the number of the lukewarm tempteth to  carelessness of life.    5. O how great was the love of all religious persons at the  beginning of this sacred institution!  O what devoutness of  prayer!  what rivalry in holiness!  what strict discipline was  observed!  what reverence and obedience under the rule of the  master showed they in all things!  The traces of them that remain  until now testify that they were truly holy and perfect men, who  fighting so bravely trod the world underfoot.  Now a man is  counted great if only he be not a transgressor, and if he can  only endure with patience what he hath undertaken.    6. O the coldness and negligence of our times, that we so quickly  decline from the former love, and it is become a weariness to  live, because of sloth and lukewarmness.  May progress in  holiness not wholly fall asleep in thee, who many times hast seen  so many examples of devout men!      CHAPTER XIX    Of the exercises of a religious man    The life of a Christian ought to be adorned with all virtues,  that he may be inwardly what he outwardly appeareth unto men.  And verily it should be yet better within than without, for God  is a discerner of our heart, Whom we must reverence with all our  hearts wheresoever we are, and walk pure in His presence as do  the angels.  We ought daily to renew our vows, and to kindle our  hearts to zeal, as if each day were the first day of our  conversion, and to say, \"Help me, O God, in my good resolutions,  and in Thy holy service, and grant that this day I may make a  good beginning, for hitherto I have done nothing!\"    2. According to our resolution so is the rate of our progress,  and much diligence is needful for him who would make good  progress.  For if he who resolveth bravely oftentimes falleth  short, how shall it be with him who resolveth rarely or feebly?  But manifold causes bring about abandonment of our resolution,  yet a trivial omission of holy exercises can hardly be made  without some loss to us.  The resolution of the righteous  dependeth more upon the grace of God than upon their own wisdom;  for in Him they always put their trust, whatsoever they take in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16531"],[0,"Old St. Paul's Cathedral (#4)"],[1,"day.\" On important occasions, the Lord  Mayor and Aldermen came in state. Sometimes even the King came with  his retinue, and a covered seat was placed for them against the  cathedral wall, which may be noticed in our engraving. If there was an  important meeting, and the weather was unfavourable, the meeting was  adjourned to the \"Shrowdes,\" that is, to the crypt, which, as we have  already seen, was now converted into the Church of St. Faith.    The Cross was damaged by lightning in 1382, and was rebuilt by Bishop  Kempe (1448-1489). It had stone steps, the pulpit was of strong oak,  and it was roofed in with lead. This was the building which was  standing as we closed our account of the cathedral at the beginning of  the Tudor dynasty. We shall see more of it hereafter in our historical  memorials.    On the north side of the Cathedral Nave was the Bishop's residence,  with a private door leading into the cathedral. Of the appearance of  the west front of the cathedral we cannot speak with certainty, as it  disappeared to make way for Inigo Jones's porch, to which we shall  come hereafter. But there were, as usual, three entries, of which the  middle had a fine brazen door-post, and there are two towers to be  noted. That on the north was part of the Bishop's Palace; that on the  south was commonly known as Lollards' Tower. It was the place for  imprisoning heretics, and there are ugly stories about it. For  example, a man named Hunne, who had been found in possession of some  Wycliffite tracts, was confined here by Bonner, and was presently  found hanged. It was said that he had committed suicide. But it was  declared that the appearances rendered this theory impossible, and  Bonner was generally believed to have incited murder; so much was this  believed, in fact, that he was hated by the citizens from that time.    On the south side of the church were St. Paul's Brewhouse and  Bakehouse, and also a house which, in 1570, was handed over to the  Doctors of Civil Law as a \"Commons House.\" These civilians and  canonists had previously been lodged at \"a mean house in Paternoster  Row.\" South of the nave was the Church of St. Gregory-by-Paul's  adjoining the wall up to the West Front. Between that and the South  Transept was a curious cloister of two stories, running round three  sides of a square, and in the middle of this square was the Chapter  House. It was built in 1332, and was very small--only thirty-two feet  six inches in internal diameter. The remains of it have been carefully  preserved on the ground, and are visible to the passers-by. The  Deanery I have mentioned, but we shall have more about it hereafter.  The open space before the West Front was claimed by the citizens,  as well as the east side; not, like that, for a folkmote, but for  military parade. The arms were kept in the adjoining Baynard's Castle.      [Footnote 1: In old times the name Ludgate Hill was given to that part  which ran up from the Fleet to the City Gate. Inside the Gate the  street was called \"Bowyer Row,\" from the trade carried on in it. But  it was also frequently called \"Paul's.\" Ludgate was pulled down in  1760, and then Ludgate Hill became the name of the whole street.]           *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER III.    THE INTERIOR OF OLD ST. PAUL'S.          _Fine_ coup d'oeil _on entering the Nave_--\"_Paul's Walk_\"--      _Monuments in Nave_--_Sir John Montacute_--_Bishop Kempe_--_Sir      John Beauchamp, wrongly called afterwards Duke Humphrey's_--_The      Choir_--_Shrine of St. Erkenwald_--_Nowell_--_Braybrooke_--_two      Kings_--_many Bishops_--_Elizabethan Worthies._      The aspect of the Nave, on entering the western door, must have been  magnificent. There were twelve bays to the nave, then the four mighty  pillars supporting the tower, then the screen closing in the choir.  The nave was known as \"Paul's Walk,\" and not too favourably known,  either, under this title. Of this more hereafter. At the second bay in  the North Aisle was the meeting-place of Convocation, closed in as a  chamber. Here, too, was the Font, by which was the Monument of Sir  John Montacute. He was the son of the first Earl of Salisbury, and it  was his mother of whom the fictitious story about the establishment of  the Order of the Garter by Edward III. was told. John de Montacute's  father was buried in the Church of the Whitefriars. The son was  baptized in St. Paul's, and directed in his will, \"If I die in London  I desire that my body may be buried in St. Paul's, near to the font  wherein I was baptized.\"    At the sixth bay came \"the Little North Door,\" and it was answerable,  as till lately was a similar door at St. Alban's Abbey, for much of  the desecration of the church which went on. There was a notice on it  that anybody bringing in burden or basket must pay a penny into the  box at hand. Between the columns of the tenth bay was the Chantry of  Bishop Kempe (1450-1489). It was the finest in the cathedral, built by  Royal licence. He did much for the beautifying of the cathedral, and  rebuilt Paul's Cross, as we have said already. He seems to have kept  clear of the fierce struggles of the Wars of the Roses, for he saw  rival kings in succession ostentatiously worshipping in St. Paul's,  and did not lose the friendship of any of them. So far as one can  judge, he honestly felt that he was not called upon to become a  partisan of any, and this fact was recognised.    It was Edward IV. who gave him licence to erect his chantry. \"For  the singular reverence which he bore to God and to the blessed and  glorious Virgin Mary, as also to the holy Apostles Peter and Paul, and  to St. Erkenwald and Ethelbert, those devout confessors, he granted  license to Thomas Kempe, Bishop of London, for the founding of a  chantry of one priest, who should be the Bishop of London's confessor  in this cathedral, for the time being, to celebrate divine service  daily at the altar of the Holy Trinity in the body thereof, towards  the north side, for the good estate of the said King and Queen  Elizabeth, his Consort; as also of the said Bishop, during their  lives in this world, and for the health of their souls after their  departures hence, and moreover for the souls of the said King's  progenitors; the parents and benefactors of the said bishop and all  the faithful deceased; and to unite it to the office of confessor in  this church for ever, and likewise to grant thereunto one messuage,  one dovehouse, 140 acres of land, six acres of meadow, with eight  acres of wood, called _Grays_, and 10_s._ rent with the appurtenances,  lying in _Great Clacton_ in the county of _Essex_; as also another  messuage, twenty acres of land, two acres of meadow and two acres of  wood, with the appurtenances in the same town, and two acres of land  lying in _Chigwell_, together with the advowson of the Church of  Chigwell, in the same county.\"    The next monument has a very strange and quaint interest. It was  nearly opposite Kempe's, in the eleventh bay on the south side, that  of Sir John Beauchamp, of Powick, in Worcestershire (son of Guy, Earl  of Warwick), who died in 1374. He settled, out of some tenements in  Aldermanbury, for the payment of 10 marks a year for a priest to  celebrate at his altar, and 50_s._ a year for the special keeping of  the anniversary of his death, December 3rd. There was a very fine  image of the B.V.M. beside this tomb. Barnet, Bishop of Bath and  Wells, gave a water mill, ninety acres of arable and pasture, and  eight acres of wood, all lying at Navestock, in Essex, to the Dean and  Chapter for the saying of certain prayers and a _de profundis_ beside  this image for the souls of the faithful; and there were constant  oblations here. John Westyard, citizen and vintner, founded another  altar at the same place for a chantry priest to say masses for the  soul of Thomas Stowe, sometime Dean of St. Paul's, and for those of  his parents and benefactors. In after years a strange mistake befell  this tomb, one wonders why. It became popularly known as the tomb of  Duke Humphrey, of whom we have more to say hereafter, who was buried  not here but at St. Albans.    Entering within the choir, the first monument--a marble altar  tomb--was that of Thomas Ewer, or Evere, who was Dean for twelve  years, and died in 1400. In a straight line with it, before the steps  of the high altar, lay Robert Fitzhugh, Bishop 1431-1436, who, as the  learned Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, was sent as an  English delegate to the Council of Basel. Whilst he was there he was  elected to the See of London, and consecrated at Foligno. He was an  earnest labourer for the betterment of the poor clergy in his diocese.  Immediately behind the high altar screen was the magnificent shrine of  St. Erkenwald, and beside it the tomb of Dean Nowell, both of which  are described hereafter (see pp. 24, 51). East of this again, at  the entrance to the Lady Chapel, was the beautiful brass of Robert  Braybrooke, Bishop 1381-1405. His was a troublous time, the time of  the evil government of Richard II. The Bishop exerted himself with all  his might to bring about righteous government, and to draw the king  away from evil counsellors. But he also persuaded the citizens to keep  the peace when they would have run into riot, and was all his life  held in honour. He was fierce against the Lollards, hardly to be  wondered at, as they were constantly affixing papers against current  doctrines and doings on the doors of the cathedral. It was this  bishop who rebuked the citizens for their neglect of the Feast of the  Conversion of St. Paul, their patron saint, and he made arrangements  for special services, which from that time were carefully observed.  He also gave directions for more devout observance of St. Erkenwald's  Day, and set aside money from the See for the feeding of 15,000 poor  people on that day in St. Paul's Churchyard.
