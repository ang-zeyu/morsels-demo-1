Realize that you are merely inhabiting the body, and using it for  your convenience, just as you might use a house.    In meditating further, ignore the body entirely, and place your thought  upon the Real \"I\" that you are beginning to feel to be \"you,\" and you  will find that your identity--your \"I\"--is something entirely apart from  the body. You may now say \"my body\" with a new meaning. Divorce the idea  of your being a physical being, and realize that you are above body. But  do not let this conception and realization cause you to ignore the body.  You must regard the body as the Temple of the Spirit, and care for it,  and make it a fit habitation for the \"I.\" Do not be frightened if, during  this meditation, you happen to experience the sensation of being out of  the body for a few moments, and of returning to it when you are through  with the exercise. The Ego is able (in the case of the advanced Initiate)  of soaring above the confines of the body, but it never severs its  connection at such times. It is merely as if one were to look out of the  window of a room, seeing what was going on outside, and drawing in his  head when he wishes. He does not leave the room, although he may place  his head outside in order to observe what is doing in the street. We do  not advise the Candidate to try to cultivate this sensation--but if it  comes naturally during meditation, do not fear.    REALIZING THE IMMORTALITY AND INVINCIBILITY OF THE EGO. While the  majority accept on faith the belief in the Immortality of the Soul, yet  but few are aware that it may be demonstrated by the soul itself. The  Yogi Masters teach the Candidates this lesson, as follows: The Candidate  places himself in the State of Meditation, or at least in a thoughtful  frame of mind, and then endeavors to \"imagine\" himself as \"dead\"--that  is, he tries to form a mental conception of himself as dead. This, at  first thought, appears a very easy thing to imagine, but as a matter of  fact it is _impossible_ to do so, for the Ego refuses to entertain the  proposition, and finds it impossible to imagine it. Try it for yourself.  You will find that you may be able to imagine your _body_ as lying still  and lifeless, but the same thought finds that in so doing _You_ are  standing and looking at the body. So you see that _You_ are not dead at  all, even in imagination, although the body may be. Or, if you refuse to  disentangle yourself from your body, in imagination, you may think of  your body as dead but _You_ who refuse to leave it are still _alive_ and  recognize the dead body as a thing apart from your Real Self. No matter  how you may twist it you _cannot_ imagine yourself as dead. The Ego  insists upon being _alive_ in any of these thoughts, and thus finds that  it has within itself the sense and assurance of Immortality. In case of  sleep or stupor resulting from a blow, or from narcotics or anaesthetics,  the mind is apparently blank, but the \"I\" is conscious of a continuity of  existence. And so one may imagine himself as being in an unconscious  state, or asleep, quite easily, and sees the possibility of such a state,  but when it comes to imagining the \"I\" as dead, the mind utterly refuses  to do the work. This wonderful fact that the soul carries within itself  the evidence of its own immortality is a glorious thing, but one must  have reached a degree of unfoldment before he is able to grasp its full  significance.    The Candidate is advised to investigate the above statement for himself,  by meditation and concentration, for in order that the \"I\" may know its  true nature and possibilities, it must realize that it cannot be  destroyed or killed. It must know what it is before it is able to  manifest its nature. So do not leave this part of the teaching until you  have mastered it. And it is well occasionally to return to it, in order  that you may impress upon the mind the fact of your immortal and eternal  nature. The mere glimmering of this conception of truth will give you an  increased sense of strength and power, and you will find that your Self  has expanded and grown, and that you are more of a power and Centre than  you have heretofore realized.    The following exercises are useful in bringing about a realization of the  invincibility of the Ego--its superiority to the elements.    Place yourself in the State of Meditation, and imagine the \"I\" as  withdrawn from the body. See it passing through the tests of air, fire  and water unharmed. The body being out of the way, the soul is seen to  be able of passing through the air at will--of floating like a bird--of  soaring--of traveling in the ether. It may be seen as able to pass  through fire without harm and without sensation, for the elements affect  only the physical body, not the Real \"I.\" Likewise it may be seen as  passing through water without discomfort or danger or hurt.    This meditation will give you a sense of superiority and strength, and  will show you something of the nature of the real \"I.\" It is true that  you are confined in the body, and the body may be affected by the  elements, but the knowledge that the Real \"I\" is superior to the  body--superior to the elements that affect the body--and cannot be  injured any more than it can be killed, is wonderful, and tends to  develop the full \"I\" consciousness within you. For You--the Real \"I\"--are  not body. You are Spirit. The Ego is Immortal and Invincible, and cannot  be killed and harmed. When you enter into this realization and  consciousness, you will feel an influx of strength and power impossible  to describe. Fear will fall from you like a worn-out cloak, and you will  feel that you are \"born again.\" An understanding of this thought, will  show you that the things that we have been fearing cannot affect the Real  \"I,\" but must rest content with hurting the physical body. And they may  be warded off from the physical body by a proper understanding and  application of the Will.    In our next lesson, you will be taught how to separate the \"I\" from the  mechanism of the mind--how you may realize your mastery of the mind, just  as you now realize your independence of the body. This knowledge must be  imparted to you by degrees, and you must place your feet firmly upon one  round of the ladder before you take the next step.    The watchword of this First Lesson is \"I.\" And the Candidate must enter  fully into its meaning before he is able to progress. He must realize his  real existence--independent of the body. He must see himself as  invincible and impervious to harm, hurt, or death. He must see himself as  a great Centre of Consciousness--a Sun around which his world revolves.  Then will come to him a new strength. He will feel a calm dignity and  power, which will be apparent to those with whom he comes in contact. He  will be able to look the world in the face without flinching, and without  fear, for he will realize the nature and power of the \"I.\" He will  realize that he is a Centre of Power--of Influence. He will realize that  nothing can harm the \"I,\" and that no matter how the storms of life may  dash upon the personality, the real \"I\"--the Individuality--is unharmed.  Like a rock that stands steadfast throughout the storm, so does the \"I\"  stand through the tempests of the life of personality. And he will know  that as he grows in realization, he will be able to control these storms  and bid them be still.    In the words of one of the Yogi Masters: \"The 'I' is eternal. It passes  unharmed through the fire, the air, the water. Sword and spear cannot  kill or wound it. It cannot die. The trials of the physical life are but  as dreams to it. Resting secure in the knowledge of the 'I,' Man may  smile at the worst the world has to offer, and raising his hand he may  bid them disappear into the mist from which they emerged.  Blessed is he who can say (understandingly) 'I'.\"    So dear Candidate, we leave you to master the First Lesson. Be not  discouraged if your progress be slow. Be not cast down if you slip back a  step after having gained it. You will gain two at the next step. Success  and realization will be yours. Mastery is before. You will Attain. You  will Accomplish. Peace be with you.      MANTRAMS (AFFIRMATIONS) FOR THE FIRST LESSON.    \"I\" am a Centre. Around me revolves my world.    \"I\" am a Centre of Influence and Power.    \"I\" am a Centre of Thought and Consciousness.    \"I\" am Independent of the Body.    \"I\" am Immortal and cannot be Destroyed.    \"I\" am Invincible and cannot be Injured.    [Illustration: \"I\"]          THE SECOND LESSON.    THE EGO'S MENTAL TOOLS.      In the First Lesson we gave instruction and exercises designed to awaken  the consciousness of the Candidate to a realization of the real \"I.\" We  confined our instructions to the preliminary teachings of the reality of  the \"I,\" and the means whereby the Candidate might be brought to a  realization of his real Self, and its independence from the body and the  things of the flesh. We tried to show you how you might awaken to a  consciousness of the reality of the \"I\"; its real nature; its  independence of the body; its immortality; its invincibility and  invulnerability. How well we have succeeded may be determined only by  the experience of each Candidate, for we can but point out the way, and  the Candidate must do the real work himself.    But there is more to be said and done in this matter of awakening to a  realization of the \"I.\" So far, we have but told you how to distinguish  between the material coverings of the Ego and the \"I\" itself. We have  tried to show you that you had a real \"I,\" and then to show you what it  was, and how it was independent of the material coverings, etc. But there  is still another step in this self analysis--a more difficult step."]]]
