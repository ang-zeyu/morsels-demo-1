When John died, on October 19, 1216, the issue of the war between him  and the barons was still doubtful. The arrival of Louis of France,  eldest son of King Philip Augustus, had enabled the barons to win back  much of the ground lost after John's early triumphs had forced them to  call in the foreigner. Beyond the Humber the sturdy north-country  barons, who had wrested the Great Charter from John, remained true to  their principles, and had also the support of Alexander II., King of  Scots. The magnates of the eastern counties were as staunch as the  northerners, and the rich and populous southern shires were for the  most part in agreement with them. In the west, the barons had the aid  of Llewelyn ap Iorwerth, the great Prince of North Wales. While ten  earls fought for Louis, the royal cause was only upheld by six. The  towns were mainly with the rebels, notably London and the Cinque Ports,  and cities so distant as Winchester and Lincoln, Worcester and  Carlisle. Yet the baronial cause excited little general sympathy. The  mass of the population stood aloof, and was impartially maltreated by  the rival armies.    John's son Henry had at his back the chief military resources of the  country; the two strongest of the earls, William Marshal, Earl of  Pembroke, and Randolph of Blundeville, Earl of Chester; the fierce  lords of the Welsh March, the Mortimers, the Cantilupes, the Cliffords,  the Braoses, and the Lacys; and the barons of the West Midlands, headed  by Henry of Neufbourg,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16702"],[0,"The New York Times Current History of the European War, Vol. 1, January 9, 1915 (#4)"],[1," be as  well in such instances to leave the name of God out of the question.    Let us, then, analyze the record as already made up; and for the sake of  clearness the events which preceded the war will be considered  chronologically.    Immediately upon the receipt of the ultimatum in St. Petersburg on July  24, the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, in a formal communication  to Austria-Hungary, suggested that the abrupt time limit \"leaves to the  powers a delay entirely insufficient to undertake any useful steps  whatever for the straightening out of the complications that have  arisen,\" and added:         \"To prevent the incalculable consequences, equally disastrous       for all the powers, which can follow the method of action of       the Austro-Hungarian Government, it seems indispensable to us       that, above all, the delay given to Servia to reply should be       extended.\"    Sazonof further suggested that time should be given for the powers to  examine the results of the inquiry that the Austro-Hungarian Government  had made in the matter of the Serajevo assassination, and stated that if  the powers were convinced         \"of the well-groundedness of certain of the Austrian demands       they would find themselves in a position to send to the       Servian Government consequential advice.\"    He justly observes that         \"a refusal to extend the terms of the ultimatum ... would be       in contradiction with the very bases of international       relations.\"    [Russian \"Orange Paper,\" No. 4.]    Could any court question the justice of this contention? The peace of  the world was at stake. Time only was asked to see what could be done to  preserve that peace and satisfy Austria's grievances to the uttermost  farthing.    Concurrently with Sazonof's plea for a little time to preserve the peace  of the world, Sir Edward Grey had seen the German Ambassador on July 24  and had suggested to him that the only method of preventing the  catastrophe was         \"that the four powers, Germany, France, Italy, and ourselves,       (England,) should work together simultaneously at Vienna and       St. Petersburg.\"    [English \"White Paper,\" No. 11.]    Germany had only to intimate to Austria that \"a decent respect to the  opinions of mankind,\" as well as common courtesy to great and friendly  nations, required that sufficient time be given not only to Servia, but  to the other nations, to concert for the common good, especially as the  period was one of Summer dullness and many of the leading rulers and  statesmen were absent from their respective capitals.    Under these circumstances was it not natural that Russia should announce  on July 24         \"that any action taken by Austria to humiliate Servia would       not leave Russia indifferent,\"    and that on the same day the Russian Charge d'Affaires at Vienna  suggested to the Austrian Foreign Office         \"that the Austrian note was drawn up in a form rendering it       impossible of acceptance as it stood, and that it was both       unusual and peremptory in its terms\"?    To which the only reply of the Austrian Foreign Minister was that their  representative in Servia         \"was under instructions to leave Belgrade unless Austrian       demands were accepted in their integrity by 4 P.M. tomorrow.\"    [English \"White Paper,\" No. 7.]    Austria's only concession then or subsequently to the cause of peace was  the assurance that Austria would not _after its conquest_ of Servia  demand any territory.    The action of Germany on this day, July 24, is most significant. Its  Ambassador in England communicated a note to Sir Edward Grey in which it  justified Austro-Hungarian grievances and ultimatum by saying that         \"under these circumstances the course of procedure and demands       of the Austro-Hungarian Government can only be regarded as       equitable and moderate.\"    The note added:         \"The Imperial Government [Germany] want to emphasize their       opinion that in the present case there is only question of a       matter to be settled exclusively between Austria-Hungary and       Servia, and that the great powers ought seriously to endeavor       to reserve it to those two immediately concerned.\"    [English \"White Paper,\" No. 9.]    On July 25, probably to the great surprise of both Germany and Austria,  which had definitely calculated upon Servians non-compliance with the  ultimatum, the latter country, under the conciliatory advice of Russia  and England, made a reply in which, at some sacrifice of its  self-respect as a sovereign State, it substantially accepted all but one  of the demands of Austria, and as to that it did not, in terms, refuse  it, but expressed its willingness to refer it either to arbitration or  to a conference of the powers.    [English \"White Paper,\" No. 39.]    No court would question for a moment the conclusion that the reply was a  substantial acquiescence in the extreme Austrian demands, nor indeed did  either Germany or Austria seriously contend that it was not. They  contented themselves with impeaching the sincerity of the assurances,  calling the concessions \"shams,\" and of this it is enough to say that if  Germany and Austria had accepted Servians reply as sufficient, and  Servia had subsequently failed to fulfill its promises thus made in the  utmost good faith, there would have been little sympathy for Servia, and  no general war. Indeed, both Russia and England pledged their influence  to compel Servia, if necessary, to meet fully any reasonable demand of  Austria. The outstanding question, which Servia agreed to arbitrate or  leave to the powers, was the participation of Austrian officials in the  Servian courts. This did not present a difficult problem. Austria's  professed desire for an impartial investigation could have been easily  attained by having the neutral powers appoint a commission of jurists to  make such investigation.    On July 24 Sir Edward Grey also had asked the German Ambassador to use  his good influences at Vienna to secure an extension of time. To this  most reasonable request the answer and action of the German Government  was disingenuous in the extreme. They agreed to \"pass on\" the  suggestion, but the German Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs added  that as the Austrian Prime Minister was away from Vienna there would be  delay and difficulty in getting the time limit extended, and         \"he admitted quite freely that the Austro-Hungarian Government       _wished to give the Servians a lesson and that they meant to       take military action. He also admitted that the Servian       Government could not swallow certain of the Austro-Hungarian       demands_.\"    He added that Germany did not want a general war and \"he would do all in  his power to prevent such a calamity.\"    [English \"White Paper,\" Nos. 11 and 18.]    Immediately on the issuance of the ultimatum the Austrian Foreign  Minister, Count Berchtold, had most inopportunely taken himself to  Ischl, where he remained until after the expiration of the time limit.  Access to him proved difficult, and the Russian Charge at Vienna, having  lodged a pacific protest with the Acting Foreign Minister in order to  take no chances, telegraphed it to Berchtold at Ischl. Nevertheless,  Berchtold's apparently designed absence from the capital was Germany's  excuse for its failure to get the time limit extended.    If Germany made any communication to Austria in the interests of peace  the text has yet to be disclosed to the world. A word from Berlin to  Vienna would have given the additional time which, with sincerely  pacific intentions, might have resulted in the preservation of peace.  Germany, so far as the record discloses, never spoke that word.    Contrast this attitude with that of Russia, whose Foreign Minister on  the morning of July 25 offered         \"to stand aside and leave the question in the hands of       England, France, Germany, and Italy.\"    [English \"White Paper,\" No. 17.]    As Russia was the member of the Triple Entente most interested in the  fate of Servia, what proposal could have been more conciliatory or  magnanimous?    On July 25 Sir Edward Grey proposed that the four powers (including  Germany) should unite         \"in asking the Austrian and Russian Governments not to cross       the frontier and to give time for the four powers, acting at       Vienna and St. Petersburg, to try and arrange matters. If       Germany will adopt this view I feel strongly that France and       ourselves should act upon it. Italy would no doubt gladly       co-operate.\"    [English \"White Paper,\" Nos. 24 and 25.]    To this reasonable request the Imperial German Chancellor replied:         \"First and last, we take the ground that this question must be       localized _by the abstention of all the powers from       intervention in it_,\"    but added that Germany would, if an Austro-Russian dispute arose,         \"co-operate with the other great powers in mediation between       Russia and Austria.\"    [German \"White Paper,\" Annex 13.]    This distinction is very hard to grasp. It attempts to measure the  difference between tweedledum and tweedledee. Russia's difference with  Austria was over the attempt of the latter to crush Servia. Germany  would not interfere in the latter, but would as an abstract proposition  mediate between Russia and Austria. For all practical purposes the two  things were indistinguishable.    How she \"co-operated\" we shall presently see.    All that Germany _did_ on July 25, so far as the record discloses, was  to \"pass on\" England's and Russia's requests for more time, but  subsequent events indicate that it was \"passed on\" without any  indorsement, for is it credible that Austria would have ignored its  ally's request for more time if it had ever been made?    The Austrian Foreign Minister, having launched the ultimatum, absented  himself from the capital, but the Russian"]]]
