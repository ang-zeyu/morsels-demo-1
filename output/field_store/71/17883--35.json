But she never  sees me.... Daren, I don't know what your--your--that engagement means  to you, but I must tell you--Helen Wrapp doesn't conduct herself as if  she were engaged. Still, I don't know what's in the heads of girls  to-day. I can only compare the present with the past.\"    Lane did not inquire further and his mother did not offer more  comment. At the moment he heard a motor car out in front of the house,  a girl's shrill voice in laughter, the slamming of a car-door--then  light, quick footsteps on the porch. Lane could look from where he sat  to the front door--only a few yards down the short hall. The door  opened. A girl entered.    \"That's Lorna,\" said Lane's mother. He grew aware that she bent a  curious gaze upon his face.    Lane rose to his feet with his heart pounding, and a strange sense of  expectancy. His little sister! Never during the endless months of  drudgery, strife and conflict, and agony, had he forgotten Lorna. Not  duty, nor patriotism, had forced him to enlist in the army before the  draft. It had been an ideal which he imagined he shared with the  millions of American boys who entered the service. Too deep ever to be  spoken of! The barbarous and simian Hun, with his black record against  Belgian, and French women, should never set foot on American soil.    In the lamplight Lane saw this sister throw coat and hat on the  banister, come down the hall and enter the kitchen. She seemed tall,  but her short skirt counteracted that effect. Her bobbed hair, curly  and rebellious, of a rich brown-red color, framed a pretty face Lane  surely remembered. But yet not the same! He had carried away memory of  a child's face and this was a woman's. It was bright, piquant, with  darkly glancing eyes, and vivid cheeks, and carmine lips.    \"Oh, _hot dog_! if it isn't Dare!\" she squealed, and with radiant look  she ran into his arms.    The moment, or moments, of that meeting between brother and sister  passed, leaving Lane conscious of hearty welcome and a sense of  unreality. He could not at once adjust his mental faculties to an  incomprehensible difference affecting everything.    They sat down to supper, and Lane, sick, dazed, weak, found eating his  first meal at home as different as everything else from what he had  expected. There had been no lack of warmth or love in Lorna's welcome,  but he suffered disappointment. Again for the hundredth time he put  it aside and blamed his morbid condition. Nothing must inhibit his  gladness.    Lorna gave Lane no chance to question her. She was eager, voluble,  curious, and most disconcertingly oblivious of a possible  sensitiveness in Lane.    \"Dare, you look like a dead one,\" she said. \"Did you get shot,  bayoneted, gassed, shell-shocked and all the rest? Did you go over the  top? Did you kill any Germans? Gee! did you get to ride in a  war-plane? Come across, now, and tell me.\"    \"I guess about--everything happened to me--except going west,\"  returned Lane. \"But I don't want to talk about that. I'm too glad to  be home.\"    \"What's that on your breast?\" she queried, suddenly, pointing at the  _Croix de Guerre_ he wore.    \"That? Lorna, that's my medal.\"    \"Gee! Let me see.\" She got up and came round to peer down closely, to  finger the decoration. \"French! I never saw one before.... Daren,  haven't you an American medal too?\"    \"No.\"    \"Why not?\"    \"My dear sister, that's hard to say. Because I didn't deserve it, most  likely.\"    She leaned back to gaze more thoughtfully at him.    \"What did you get this for?\"    \"It's a long story. Some day I'll tell you.\"    \"Are you proud of it?\"    For answer he only smiled at her.    \"It's so long since the war I've forgotten so many things,\" she said,  wonderingly. Then she smiled sweetly. \"Dare, I'm proud of you.\"    That was a moment in which his former emotion seemed to stir for her.  Evidently she had lost track of something once memorable. She was  groping back for childish impressions. It was the only indication of  softness he had felt in her. How impossible to believe Lorna was only  fifteen! He could form no permanent conception of her. But in that  moment he sensed something akin to a sister's sympathy, some vague and  indefinable thought in her, too big for her to grasp. He never felt it  again. The serious sweet mood vanished.    \"Hot dog! I've a brother with the _Croix de Guerre_. I'll swell up  over that. I'll crow over some of these Janes.\"    Thus she talked on while eating her supper. And Lane tried to eat  while he watched her. Presently he moved his chair near to the stove.  Lorna did not wait upon her mother. It was the mother who did the  waiting, as silently she moved from table to stove.    Lorna's waist was cut so low that it showed the swell of her breast.  The red color of her cheeks, high up near her temples, was not  altogether the rosy line of health and youth. Her eyebrows were only  faint, thin, curved lines, oriental in effect. She appeared to be  unusually well-developed in body for so young a girl. And the air of  sophistication, of experience that seemed a part of her manner  completely mystified Lane. If it had not been for the slangy speech,  and the false color in her face, he would have been amused at what he  might have termed his little sister's posing as a woman of the world.  But in the light of these he grew doubtful of his impression. Lastly,  he saw that she wore her stockings rolled below her knees and that the  edge of her short skirt permitted several inches of her bare legs to  be seen. And at that he did not know what to think. He was stunned.    \"Daren, you served a while under Captain Thesel in the war,\" she said.    \"Yes, I guess I did,\" replied Lane, with sombre memory resurging.    \"Do you know he lives here?\"    \"I knew him here in Middleville several years before the war.\"    \"He's danced with me at the Armory. Some swell dancer! He and Dick  Swann and Hardy MacLean sometimes drop in at the Armory on Saturday  nights. Captain Thesel is chasing Mrs. Clemhorn now. They're always  together.... Daren, did he ever have it in for you?\"    \"He never liked me. We never got along here in Middleville. And  naturally in the service when he was a captain and I only a  private--we didn't get along any better.\"    \"Well, I've heard Captain Thesel was to blame for--for what was said  about you last summer when he came home.\"    \"And what was that, Lorna?\" queried Lane, curiously puzzled at her,  and darkly conscious of the ill omen that had preceded him home.    \"You'll not hear it from me,\" declared Lorna, spiritedly. \"But that  _Croix de Guerre_ doesn't agree with it, I'll tell the world.\"    A little frown puckered her smooth brow and there was a gleam in her  eye.    \"Seems to me I heard some of the kids talking last summer,\" she mused,  ponderingly. \"Vane Thesel was stuck on Mel Iden and Dot Dalrymple both  before the war. Dot handed him a lemon. He's still trying to rush Dot,  and the gossip is he'd go after Mel even now on the sly, if she'd  stand for it.\"    \"Why on the sly?\" inquired Lane. \"Before I left home Mel Iden was  about the prettiest and most popular girl in Middleville. Her people  were poor, and ordinary, perhaps, but she was the equal of any one.\"    \"Thesel couldn't rush Mel now and get away with it, unless on the  q-t,\" replied Lorna. \"Haven't you heard about Mel?\"    \"No, you see the fact is, my few correspondents rather neglected to  send me news,\" said Lane.    The significance of this was lost upon his sister. She giggled. \"Hot  dog! You've got some kicks coming, I'll say!\"    \"Is that so,\" returned Lane, with irritation. \"A few more or less  won't matter.... Lorna, do you know Helen Wrapp?\"    \"That red-headed dame!\" burst out Lorna, with heat. \"I should smile I  do. She's one who doesn't shake a shimmy on tea, believe me.\"    Lane was somewhat at a loss to understand his sister's intimation, but  as it was vulgarly inimical, and seemed to hold some subtle personal  scorn or jealousy, he shrank from questioning her. This talk with his  sister was the most unreal happening he had ever experienced. He could  not adjust himself to its verity.    \"Helen Wrapp is nutty about Dick Swann,\" went on Lorna. \"She drives  down to the office after----\"    \"Lorna, do you know Helen and I are engaged?\" interrupted Lane.    \"Hot dog!\" was that young lady's exposition of utter amaze. She stared  at her brother.    \"We were engaged,\" continued Lane. \"She wore my ring. When I enlisted  she wanted me to marry her before I left. But I wouldn't do that.\"    Lorna promptly recovered from her amaze. \"Well, it's a damn lucky  thing you didn't take her up on that marriage stuff.\"    There was a glint of dark youthful passion in Lorna's face. Lane felt  rise in him a desire to bid her sharply to omit slang and profanity  from the conversation. But the desire faded before his bewilderment.  All had suffered change. What had he come home to? There was no clear  answer. But whatever it was, he felt it to be enormous and staggering.  And he meant to find out. Weary as was his mind, it grasped peculiar  significances and deep portents.    \"Lorna, where do you work?\" he began, shifting his interest.    \"At Swann's,\" she replied.    \"In the office--at the foundry?\" he asked.    \"No. Mr. Swann's at the head of the leather works.\"    \"What do you do?\"    \"I type letters,\" she answered, and rose to make him a little bow that  held "]]]
