Thus arrayed, the English received the impetuous charge of the wild  Galloway men, not in armour, who claimed the right to form the van, and  broke through the first line only to die beneath the spears of the  second.  But Prince David with his heavy cavalry scattered the force  opposed to him, and stampeded the horses of the English that were held in  reserve.  This should have been fatal to the English, but Henry, like  Rupert at Marston Moor, pursued too far, and the discipline of the Scots  was broken by the cry that their King had fallen, and they fled.  David  fought his way to Carlisle in a series of rearguard actions, and at  Carlisle was joined by Prince Henry with the remnant of his men-at-arms.  It was no decisive victory for England.    In the following year (1139) David got what he wanted.  His son Henry, by  peaceful arrangement, received the Earldom of Northumberland, without the  two strong places, Bamborough and Newcastle.    Through the anarchic weakness of Stephen's reign, Scotland advanced in  strength and civilisation despite a Celtic rising headed by a strange  pretender to the rights of the MacHeths, a \"brother Wimund\"; but all went  with the death of David's son, Prince Henry, in 1152.  Of the prince's  three sons, the eldest, Malcolm, was but ten years old; next came his  brothers William (\"the Lion\") and little David, Earl of Huntingdon.  From  this David's daughters descended the chief claimants to the Scottish  throne in 1292--namely, Balliol, Bruce, and Comyn: the last also was  descended, in the female line, from King Donald Ban, son of Malcolm  Canmore.    David had done all that man might do to settle the crown on his grandson  Malcolm; his success meant that standing curse of Scotland, \"Woe to the  kingdom whose king is a child,\"--when, in a year, David died at Carlisle  (May 24, 1153).        SCOTLAND BECOMES FEUDAL.      The result of the domestic policy of David was to bring all accessible  territory under the social and political system of western Europe, \"the  Feudal System.\"  Its principles had been perfectly familiar to Celtic  Scotland, but had rested on a body of traditional customs (as in Homeric  Greece), rather than on written laws and charters signed and sealed.  Among the Celts the local tribe had been, theoretically, the sole source  of property in land.  In proportion as they were near of kin to the  recognised tribal chief, families held lands by a tenure of three  generations; but if they managed to acquire abundance of oxen, which they  let out to poorer men for rents in kind and labour, they were apt to turn  the lands which they held only temporarily, \"in possession,\" into real  permanent _property_.  The poorer tribesmen paid rent in labour or  \"services,\" also in supplies of food and manure.    The Celtic tenants also paid military service to their superiors.  The  remotest kinsmen of each lord of land, poor as they might be, were valued  for their swords, and were billeted on the unfree or servile tenants, who  gave them free quarters.    In the feudal system of western Europe these old traditional customs had  long been modified and stereotyped by written charters.  The King gave  gifts of land to his kinsmen or officers, who were bound to be \"faithful\"  (_fideles_); in return the inferior did homage, while he received  protection.  From grade to grade of rank and wealth each inferior did  homage to and received protection from his superior, who was also his  judge.  In this process, what had been the Celtic tribe became the new  \"thanage\"; the Celtic king (_righ_) of the tribe became the thane; the  province or group of tribes (say Moray) became the earldom; the Celtic  Mormaer of the province became the earl; and the Crown appointed _vice-  comites_, sub-earls, that is sheriffs, who administered the King's  justice in the earldom.    But there were regions, notably the west Highlands and isles, where the  new system penetrated slowly and with difficulty through a mountainous  and almost townless land.  The law, and written leases, \"came slowly up  that way.\"    Under David, where his rule extended, society was divided broadly into  three classes--Nobles, Free, Unfree.  All holders of \"a Knight's fee,\" or  part of one, holding by _free_ service, hereditarily, and by charter,  constituted the _communitas_ of the realm (we are to hear of the  _communitas_ later), and were free, noble, or gentle,--men of coat  armour.  The \"ignoble,\" \"not noble,\" men with no charter from the Crown,  or Earl, Thane, or Church, were, if lease-holders, though not \"noble,\"  still \"free.\"  Beneath them were the \"unfree\" _nativi_, sold or given  with the soil.    The old Celtic landholders were not expropriated, as a rule, except where  Celtic risings, in Galloway and Moray, were put down, and the lands were  left in the King's hands.  Often, when we find territorial surnames of  families, \"_de_\" \"of\" this place or that,--the lords are really of Celtic  blood with Celtic names; disguised under territorial titles; and finally  disused.  But in Galloway and Ayrshire the ruling Celtic name, Kennedy,  remains Celtic, while the true Highlands of the west and northwest  retained their native magnates.  Thus the Anglicisation, except in very  rebellious regions, was gradual.  There was much less expropriation of  the Celt than disguising of the Celt under new family names and  regulation of the Celt under written charters and leases.        CHURCH LANDS.      David I. was, according to James VI., nearly five centuries later, \"a  sair saint for the Crown.\"  He gave Crown-lands in the southern lowlands  to the religious orders with their priories and abbeys; for example,  Holyrood, Melrose, Jedburgh, Kelso, and Dryburgh--centres of learning and  art and of skilled agriculture.  Probably the best service of the regular  clergy to the State was its orderliness and attention to agriculture, for  the monasteries did not, as in England, produce many careful chroniclers  and historians.    Each abbey had its lands divided into baronies, captained by a lay  \"Church baron\" to lead its levies in war.  The civil centre of the barony  was the great farm or grange, with its mill, for in the thirteenth  century the Lowlands had water-mills which to the west Highlands were  scarcely known in 1745, when the Highland husbandmen were still using the  primitive hand-quern of two circular stones.  Near the mill was a hamlet  of some forty cottages; each head of a family had a holding of eight or  nine acres and pasturage for two cows, and paid a small money rent and  many arduous services to the Abbey.    The tenure of these cottars was, and under lay landlords long remained,  extremely precarious; but the tenure of the \"bonnet laird\" (_hosbernus_)  was hereditary.  Below even the free cottars were the unfree serfs or  _nativi_, who were handed over, with the lands they tilled, to the abbeys  by benefactors: the Church was forward in emancipating these serfs; nor  were lay landlords backward, for the freed man was useful as a spear-man  in war.    We have only to look at the many now ruined abbeys of the Border to see  the extent of civilisation under David I., and the relatively peaceful  condition, then, of that region which later became the cockpit of the  English wars, and the home of the raiding clans, Scotts, Elliots, and  Armstrongs, Bells, Nixons, Robsons, and Croziers.        THE BURGHS.      David and his son and successor, William the Lion, introduced a stable  middle and urban class by fostering, confirming, and regulating the  rights, privileges, and duties of the already existing free towns.  These  became _burghs_, royal, seignorial, or ecclesiastical.  In origin the  towns may have been settlements that grew up under the shelter of a  military castle.  Their fairs, markets, rights of trading, internal  organisation, and primitive police, were now, mainly under William the  Lion, David's successor, regulated by charters; the burghers obtained the  right to elect their own magistrates, and held their own burgh-courts;  all was done after the English model.  As the State had its \"good men\"  (_probi homines_), who formed its recognised \"community,\" so had the  borough.  Not by any means all dwellers in a burgh were free burghers;  these free burghers had to do service in guarding the royal castle--later  this was commuted for a payment in money.  Though with power to elect  their own chief magistrate, the burghers commonly took as Provost the  head of some friendly local noble family, in which the office was apt to  become practically hereditary.  The noble was the leader and protector of  the town.  As to police, the burghers, each in his turn, provided men to  keep watch and ward from curfew bell to cock-crow.  Each ward in the town  had its own elected Bailie.  Each burgh had exclusive rights of trading  in its area, and of taking toll on merchants coming within its _Octroi_.  An association of four burghs, Berwick, Roxburgh, Edinburgh, and  Stirling, was the root of the existing \"Convention of Burghs.\"        JUSTICE.      In early societies, justice is, in many respects, an affair to be settled  between the kindreds of the plaintiff, so to speak, and the defendant.  A  man is wounded, killed, robbed, wronged in any way; his kin retaliate on  the offender and _his_ kindred.  The blood-feud, the taking of blood for  blood, endured for centuries in Scotland after the peace of the whole  realm became, under David I., \"the King's peace.\"  Homicides, for  example, were very frequently pardoned by Royal grace, but \"the pardon  was of no avail unless it had been issued with the full knowledge of the  kin of the slaughtered man, who otherwise retained their _legal_ right of  vengeance on the homicide.\"  They might accept pecuniary compensation,  the blood-fine, or they might not, as in Homer's time. {27}  At all  events, under David, offences became offences against"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1597"],[0,"Andersen's Fairy Tales (#4)"],[1,"flowed a broad canal or river. Some wretched hovels for the  Dutch sailors, resembling great boxes, and after which the place was  named, lay about in confused disorder on the opposite bank.    \"I either behold a fata morgana, or I am regularly tipsy,\" whimpered out  the Councillor. \"But what's this?\"    He turned round anew, firmly convinced that he was seriously ill. He  gazed at the street formerly so well known to him, and now so strange in  appearance, and looked at the houses more attentively: most of them were  of wood, slightly put together; and many had a thatched roof.    \"No--I am far from well,\" sighed he; \"and yet I drank only one glass of  punch; but I cannot suppose it--it was, too, really very wrong to give  us punch and hot salmon for supper. I shall speak about it at the first  opportunity. I have half a mind to go back again, and say what I suffer.  But no, that would be too silly; and Heaven only knows if they are up  still.\"    He looked for the house, but it had vanished.    \"It is really dreadful,\" groaned he with increasing anxiety; \"I cannot  recognise East Street again; there is not a single decent shop from one  end to the other! Nothing but wretched huts can I see anywhere; just  as if I were at Ringstead. Oh! I am ill! I can scarcely bear myself any  longer. Where the deuce can the house be? It must be here on this very  spot; yet there is not the slightest idea of resemblance, to such a  degree has everything changed this night! At all events here are some  people up and stirring. Oh! oh! I am certainly very ill.\"    He now hit upon a half-open door, through a chink of which a faint light  shone. It was a sort of hostelry of those times; a kind of public-house.  The room had some resemblance to the clay-floored halls in Holstein; a  pretty numerous company, consisting of seamen, Copenhagen burghers, and  a few scholars, sat here in deep converse over their pewter cans, and  gave little heed to the person who entered.    \"By your leave!\" said the Councillor to the Hostess, who came bustling  towards him. \"I've felt so queer all of a sudden; would you have the  goodness to send for a hackney-coach to take me to Christianshafen?\"    The woman examined him with eyes of astonishment, and shook her head;  she then addressed him in German. The Councillor thought she did not  understand Danish, and therefore repeated his wish in German. This, in  connection with his costume, strengthened the good woman in the belief  that he was a foreigner. That he was ill, she comprehended directly; so  she brought him a pitcher of water, which tasted certainly pretty strong  of the sea, although it had been fetched from the well.    The Councillor supported his head on his hand, drew a long breath, and  thought over all the wondrous things he saw around him.    \"Is this the Daily News of this evening?\" he asked mechanically, as he  saw the Hostess push aside a large sheet of paper.    The meaning of this councillorship query remained, of course, a riddle  to her, yet she handed him the paper without replying. It was a coarse  wood-cut, representing a splendid meteor \"as seen in the town of  Cologne,\" which was to be read below in bright letters.    \"That is very old!\" said the Councillor, whom this piece of antiquity  began to make considerably more cheerful. \"Pray how did you come into  possession of this rare print? It is extremely interesting, although the  whole is a mere fable. Such meteorous appearances are to be explained in  this way--that they are the reflections of the Aurora Borealis, and it  is highly probable they are caused principally by electricity.\"    Those persons who were sitting nearest him and heard his speech,  stared at him in wonderment; and one of them rose, took off his hat  respectfully, and said with a serious countenance, \"You are no doubt a  very learned man, Monsieur.\"    \"Oh no,\" answered the Councillor, \"I can only join in conversation on  this topic and on that, as indeed one must do according to the demands  of the world at present.\"    \"Modestia is a fine virtue,\" continued the gentleman; \"however, as to  your speech, I must say mihi secus videtur: yet I am willing to suspend  my judicium.\"    \"May I ask with whom I have the pleasure of speaking?\" asked the  Councillor.    \"I am a Bachelor in Theologia,\" answered the gentleman with a stiff  reverence.    This reply fully satisfied the Councillor; the title suited the dress.  \"He is certainly,\" thought he, \"some village schoolmaster--some queer  old fellow, such as one still often meets with in Jutland.\"    \"This is no locus docendi, it is true,\" began the clerical gentleman;  \"yet I beg you earnestly to let us profit by your learning. Your reading  in the ancients is, sine dubio, of vast extent?\"    \"Oh yes, I've read something, to be sure,\" replied the Councillor. \"I  like reading all useful works; but I do not on that account despise the  modern ones; 'tis only the unfortunate 'Tales of Every-day Life' that I  cannot bear--we have enough and more than enough such in reality.\"    \"'Tales of Every-day Life?'\" said our Bachelor inquiringly.    \"I mean those new fangled novels, twisting and writhing themselves in  the dust of commonplace, which also expect to find a reading public.\"    \"Oh,\" exclaimed the clerical gentleman smiling, \"there is much wit in  them; besides they are read at court. The King likes the history of Sir  Iffven and Sir Gaudian particularly, which treats of King Arthur, and  his Knights of the Round Table; he has more than once joked about it  with his high vassals.\"    \"I have not read that novel,\" said the Councillor; \"it must be quite a  new one, that Heiberg has published lately.\"    \"No,\" answered the theologian of the time of King Hans: \"that book is  not written by a Heiberg, but was imprinted by Godfrey von Gehmen.\"    \"Oh, is that the author's name?\" said the Councillor. \"It is a very  old name, and, as well as I recollect, he was the first printer that  appeared in Denmark.\"    \"Yes, he is our first printer,\" replied the clerical gentleman hastily.    So far all went on well. Some one of the worthy burghers now spoke of  the dreadful pestilence that had raged in the country a few years back,  meaning that of 1484. The Councillor imagined it was the cholera that  was meant, which people made so much fuss about; and the discourse  passed off satisfactorily enough. The war of the buccaneers of 1490 was  so recent that it could not fail being alluded to; the English  pirates had, they said, most shamefully taken their ships while in the  roadstead; and the Councillor, before whose eyes the Herostratic [*]  event of 1801 still floated vividly, agreed entirely with the others in  abusing the rascally English. With other topics he was not so fortunate;  every moment brought about some new confusion, and threatened to become  a perfect Babel; for the worthy Bachelor was really too ignorant, and  the simplest observations of the Councillor sounded to him too daring  and phantastical. They looked at one another from the crown of the head  to the soles of the feet; and when matters grew to too high a  pitch, then the Bachelor talked Latin, in the hope of being better  understood--but it was of no use after all.         * Herostratus, or Eratostratus--an Ephesian, who wantonly       set fire to the famous temple of Diana, in order to       commemorate his name by so uncommon an action.    \"What's the matter?\" asked the Hostess, plucking the Councillor by the  sleeve; and now his recollection returned, for in the course of the  conversation he had entirely forgotten all that had preceded it.    \"Merciful God, where am I!\" exclaimed he in agony; and while he so  thought, all his ideas and feelings of overpowering dizziness, against  which he struggled with the utmost power of desperation, encompassed  him with renewed force. \"Let us drink claret and mead, and Bremen beer,\"  shouted one of the guests--\"and you shall drink with us!\"    Two maidens approached. One wore a cap of two staring colors, denoting  the class of persons to which she belonged. They poured out the liquor,  and made the most friendly gesticulations; while a cold perspiration  trickled down the back of the poor Councillor.    \"What's to be the end of this! What's to become of me!\" groaned he; but  he was forced, in spite of his opposition, to drink with the rest. They  took hold of the worthy man; who, hearing on every side that he was  intoxicated, did not in the least doubt the truth of this certainly  not very polite assertion; but on the contrary, implored the ladies  and gentlemen present to procure him a hackney-coach: they, however,  imagined he was talking Russian.    Never before, he thought, had he been in such a coarse and ignorant  company; one might almost fancy the people had turned heathens again.  \"It is the most dreadful moment of my life: the whole world is leagued  against me!\" But suddenly it occurred to him that he might stoop down  under the table, and then creep unobserved out of the door. He did so;  but just as he was going, the others remarked what he was about; they  laid hold of him by the legs; and now, happily for him, off fell his  fatal shoes--and with them the charm was at an end.    The Councillor saw quite distinctly before him a lantern burning, and  behind this a large handsome house. All seemed to him in proper order as  usual; it was East Street, splendid and elegant as we now see it. He lay  with his feet towards a doorway, and exactly opposite sat the watchman  asleep.    \"Gracious Heaven!\" said he. \"Have I lain here in the street and dreamed?  Yes; 'tis East Street! How splendid and light it is! But really it is  terrible what an effect that one glass of punch must have had on me!\"    Two minutes later, he was sitting in a hackney-coach and driving to  Frederickshafen. He thought of the distress and agony he had endured,  and praised from the very bottom of his heart the happy reality--"]]]
