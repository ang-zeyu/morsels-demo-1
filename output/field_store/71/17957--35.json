[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17163"],[0,"Mother Stories from the New Testament (#4)"],[1," of fire. There shall be  wailing and gnashing of teeth.\"    At another time Jesus taught His disciples the same truth; when He  spake of His coming and of the gathering of all nations before Him,  the good entering into eternal life, but the wicked being cast away.  \"When the Son of Man shall come in His glory,\" said Jesus, \"and all  the holy angels with Him, then shall He sit upon the throne of His  glory. And before Him shall be gathered all nations; and He shall  separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from  the goats. And He shall set the sheep on His right hand, but the goats  on the left.\"    [Illustration: THE PARABLE OF THE NET.]          THE MAN POSSESSED BY DEVILS.      One day Jesus came with His disciples in a boat to the country of the  Gadarenes, near Galilee. They landed near the tombs, that is, caverns  cut into the rock, where the dead were buried. And there met them a  man, who, for a long time, had been possessed by many unclean spirits.  He lived in the tombs and wore no clothes. He had been so fierce and  wild that his friends had been obliged to chain him up, but he had  burst his fetters, and the devils had driven him out to the tombs.    Jesus bade the unclean spirits to come out of the man. And when the  man caught sight of Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before Him,  saying, \"What have I to do with Thee, Jesus, Thou Son of God most  high? I beseech Thee to torment me not.\"    And Jesus asked him his name. And he said, \"Legion,\" because many  devils were in him. They besought Jesus that He would not make them go  into the sea, but would let them enter into a herd of swine that were  feeding on the cliffs close by. He suffered them to do so, and the  devils went out of the man and entered into the pigs, and the whole  herd ran violently over the cliff into the water and were drowned. And  when the herdsmen saw what was done, they fled into the city and told  all the people. Then the people came out to Jesus, and they saw the  man that had been possessed, clothed and in his right mind, sitting at  the feet of Jesus. And they that had seen it told them by what means  the man had been healed, and they were afraid. The man out of whom the  devils had departed, besought Him that he might stay with Jesus, but  He sent him away, saying, \"Return to thy house, and show what great  things God hath done unto thee.\" And he went his way and published  throughout the city what great things Jesus had done unto him.    [Illustration: THE MAN POSSESSED BY DEVILS.]          CURING THE INCURABLE.      Jesus went into Capernaum, followed by a great crowd of people, and  among them was a woman who for twelve years had suffered from a  disease which no doctor could cure, though she had consulted many, and  spent all her wealth upon them. She had said within herself, \"If I  could but touch His garment I should be made well.\" So she pressed  through the crowd, and put out her arm and touched the hem of His  garment, and immediately she was made well.    Then Jesus, turning round to His disciples, said, \"Who touched Me?\"  But they all denied that they had done so, and Peter and they that  were with him said, \"Master, the multitude throng Thee and press Thee,  and yet Thou sayest, Who touched Me!\" They were surprised that Jesus  should make such an enquiry, seeing that so many were crowding round  Him, and pressing against Him. But Jesus said, \"Somebody hath touched  Me, for I perceive that healing virtue hath gone out of Me.\"    When the woman saw that Jesus knew what she had done, and that she  could not be hidden in the crowd, she came trembling, and, falling  down before Him, she declared unto Him before all the people why she  had touched Him, and how she had been healed at once. And He said unto  her, \"Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. Go  in peace, and be healed of thy illness.\"    Jesus wishes us to trust in Him. We suffer from a terrible  disease--the disease of sin, which no doctor can cure; but Jesus will  heal us and take away our sin if we trust in Him.    [Illustration: CURED BY TOUCHING HIS GARMENT.]          JAIRUS' DAUGHTER.      Jairus was one of the rulers of the Jewish church, or synagogue, and  he had a daughter who had been very ill and was now at the point of  death. She was an only daughter, and was twelve years of age. So  hearing that Jesus was near, he came to Him, and, falling down before  Him, implored Jesus to come and see her.    And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did His disciples. Soon  there came running to them a messenger from the ruler's house, who  said to Jairus, \"Thy daughter is already dead; do not trouble the  master.\" But when Jesus heard it He turned to Jairus and said, \"Fear  not. Only believe, and she shall be restored to life.\"    When they came to the ruler's house they saw the minstrels and many  people who were making much noise and lamentation for the dead girl,  as was the custom. Jesus said unto them, \"Make way; weep not, for the  maiden is not dead, but sleepeth;\" but they laughed Him to scorn,  knowing that she was dead. And He put them all out of the room, all  but Peter and James and John, and the mother and father of the maiden.  Then He took her by the hand, and called to her, saying, \"Maid, arise.\"  And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway; and He commanded  her parents to give her food.    Her parents were astonished when they saw their daughter raised to  life and able to eat, but Jesus charged them that they should tell no  man what He had done. But the fame of the miracle He had wrought went  abroad unto all that land.    [Illustration: JAIRUS' DAUGHTER.]          THE TWO BLIND MEN.      When Jesus had left the house of the ruler Jairus, there followed Him  two blind men. They called out to Him, \"Thou Son of David, have mercy  upon us.\"    Then Jesus looked at them, and asked if they really believed that He  had power to cure them and give them back their sight. And they said  unto Him, \"Yea, Lord.\" Then He touched their eyes, and said unto them,  \"According to your faith, so be it unto you.\" And immediately they  opened their eyes and were able to see. Jesus charged them to let no  man know what He had done. But when they were departed they spread His  fame abroad over all that country.    Another time Christ and His disciples were coming away from Jericho,  followed by a large crowd of people. And there was sitting by the  wayside a blind beggar, Bartimeus by name; and when he heard the noise  of the multitude, he asked what it meant. They answered him, \"Jesus of  Nazareth passeth by.\" Then he cried out in a loud voice, saying,  \"Jesus, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me.\" The people tried to keep  him from calling out, but he would not be quiet. He was determined  that Christ should see him. And Jesus stood still, and commanded them  to call him. So he arose and cast away his outer garment and came to  Jesus. When Jesus asked what he would have done to him, he answered,  \"Lord, that I might receive my sight.\" And Jesus said unto him, \"Go  thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole.\" And he received his sight at  once, and followed Jesus, praising Him.    [Illustration: THE TWO BLIND MEN.]          FEEDING FIVE THOUSAND.      One day Jesus went on board a ship and sailed to another part of the  coast, where He and His disciples might have rest. For the people in  the cities crowded them so closely that they did not even have time to  eat. They landed, and went into a desert place; but the people had  seen them depart, and marked which way the ship sailed. Then they all  flocked out of the cities and came on foot to the place where Jesus  was. When Jesus saw what a great number of people had come, He had  compassion on them, and spoke to them, and healed their sick. But in  the evening the disciples came to Jesus and said, \"This is a desert  place, and the day has gone; send the people away, that they may go  into the villages and buy food.\"    Jesus was too kind to send them away hungry like that. He said, \"They  need not depart; give ye them food to eat.\" But they said to Him, \"We  have here but five loaves and two fishes, which we have just purchased  of a lad.\" He said, \"Bring them to Me.\" Then He told the people to sit  down on the grass; and He took the five loaves and the two fishes,  and, looking up to heaven, blessed them and broke them into pieces.  The disciples carried the bread and fish to the people and they all  ate and had plenty, although there were about five thousand men,  besides women and children. And yet, when the disciples took up the  fragments that were left, these fragments filled twelve baskets. How  kind was Jesus! He not only taught the people and healed their sick,  but He fed them when out in the desert place and hungry.    [Illustration: FEEDING FIVE THOUSAND.]          CHRIST WALKING ON THE SEA.      When the people had seen the miracle that Christ did in feeding so  many with so few loaves, they felt sure that He was one of the old  prophets that had come again, and they would have taken Him by force  to make Him king. So He sent His disciples by boat towards Capernaum,  and He went, alone, up into a mountain to pray.    When it was dark, the disciples found themselves alone upon the sea,  opposed to strong winds, which tossed the boat upon high waves. Then  Jesus went out to them, walking upon the waves; but when the disciples  saw Him they thought it was a spirit, and cried out with fear. But  Jesus said, \"Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.\" Peter answered  Him, saying, \"Lord, if it be Thou, bid me come unto Thee on the  water.\" And He said, \"Come,\" and Peter stepped over the boat's side  and walked on the water towards Christ. But when he saw the angry  waves around him and heard the roaring of the winds, Peter was afraid  and began to sink. He cried out, \"Lord, save me.\" And Jesus,  stretching out His hand, caught him, and said, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17164"],[0,"Narrative of a Mission to Central Africa Performed in the Years 1850-51, Volume (#4)"],[1," with Presents--March--Leave  Waldee--Doubtful Visitors--The Camels stolen--The Troop of Assailants  draws nigh--Parley--Their Proposition--We are compelled to a  Compromise--Character of our Enemies--Sinister Rumours again--Proceed  toward Tidek--Wady of Kaltadak--Picturesque Scenery--A Friend from  Seloufeeat--Fresh Mob collects to attack us--Conferences--We are to be  let go scot-free if we become Muslims--We repose--Another Compromise for  Money--Incidents during the Night--Quarrel over the Booty--Enter the  Valley of Seloufeeat--Its Soudan Appearance--Nephew of Sultan  En-Noor--Haj Bashaw of Seloufeeat--We are still uneasy.

Since my return from a first tour of exploration in the Great Sahara I  had carefully revolved in my mind the possibility of a much greater  undertaking, namely, a political and commercial expedition to some of  the most important kingdoms of Central Africa. The plan appeared to me  feasible; and when I laid it in all its details before her Majesty's  Government, they determined, after mature consideration, to empower me  to carry it out. Two objects, one principal, necessarily kept somewhat  in the background--the abolition of the slave-trade; one subsidiary, and  yet important in itself--the promotion of commerce by way of the Great  Desert; appeared to me, and to the distinguished persons who promoted  the undertaking, of sufficient magnitude to justify considerable  sacrifices. Much preliminary discussion took place; but the impediments  and difficulties that naturally start up at the commencement of any  enterprise possessing the character of novelty were gradually overcome,  and in the summer of 1849 it was generally known that I was about to  proceed, by way of Tripoli and the Sahara, and the hitherto unexplored  kingdom of Aheer, to endeavour to open commercial relations and conclude  treaties with any native power so disposed, but especially with the  Sultan of Bornou. It was not thought necessary, however, to surround my  Mission with any circumstances of diplomatic splendour; and it was still  in the character of Yak[=o]b--a name already known throughout the  greater portion of the route intended to be traversed--that I proposed  to resume my intercourse with the Moors, the Fezzanees, the Tibboos, the  Tuaricks, and other tribes and peoples of the desert and the countries  beyond.    The various preparations for the expedition occupied a considerable time  before I could leave Europe; but I shall pass over all account of these,  and enter as soon as possible on the plain narrative of my journey. We  reached Tripoli on January the 31st, 1850, having come circuitously by  way of Algeria and Tunis. Divers reasons, on which it is unnecessary to  enlarge, had prevented us from adopting a more direct route. However,  there had, properly speaking, been no time lost, and we had still to  look forward to inevitable delays. An expedition of the kind we were  about to undertake cannot be performed in a hurry, especially in Africa.  In that continent everything is carried on in a deliberate manner. The  climate is in itself suggestive of procrastination; and no one who has  there had to do with officials, even of our own country, until he has  himself felt the enervating influence of the atmosphere, can fail to  have been held in ludicrous suspense between indignation and surprise.    It must here be mentioned that, associated with me in this expedition,  were two Prussian gentlemen, Drs. Barth and Overweg, who had volunteered  to accompany me in my expedition in the character of scientific  observers.    The political and commercial nature of my Mission by no means excluded  such auxiliaries. It was desirable that every advantage should be taken  of this opportunity to explore Central Africa in every point of view;  and when the proposition came to me under the sanction of Chevalier  Bunsen, and received the approval of her Majesty's Government, I could  not but be delighted. It was arranged that these gentlemen should travel  at the expense and under the protection of Great Britain, and that their  reports should be duly forwarded to the Foreign Office.    Drs. Barth and Overweg, with European impetuosity, eager at once to  grapple with adventure and research, had pushed on whilst I waited for  final instructions from Lord Palmerston. They had arrived at Tripoli  about twelve days before me, and, as I afterwards learned, had usefully  and pleasantly occupied their time in excursions to the neighbouring  mountains, which I had previously visited and examined on my way to  Ghadamez.    We learned on landing, that a good deal of the anxiety I had felt on  account of my slow progress from England had been thrown away. Our arms,  instruments, and stores, had not yet arrived from Malta. However, they  were promised for an early date, and the hospitable reception afforded  us by Mr. Consul-general Crowe, as well as the knowledge that a vast  number of small details of preparation could be immediately commenced,  contributed to console us.    Among the things expected, and which arrived in due time, was a boat  built by order of the Government in Malta dockyard. It was sent in two  sides, and I wished to carry it in that state. But this proved  impossible, and just before starting we were compelled to saw each side  into two pieces, which were to be carried slung in nets upon a couple of  powerful camels. This boat was expressly intended for the navigation of  Lake Tchad.[1]      [1] It has since been launched under the British flag, and has        proved useful in the examination of the shores of the great        lake of Central Africa.--EDITOR.    It was universally admired at Tripoli; and, as it will be useless to  bring it back, will form a most acceptable present for the Sultan of  Bornou. I cannot omit to notice, in passing, the courtesy and"]]]
