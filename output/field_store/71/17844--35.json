Nay, more; is not  the whole of heaven (not to dwell on particulars) almost filled with  the offspring of men?    Should I attempt to search into antiquity, and produce from thence what  the Greek writers have asserted, it would appear that even those who  are called their principal Gods were taken from among men up into  heaven.    XIII. Examine the sepulchres of those which are shown in Greece;  recollect, for you have been initiated, what lessons are taught in the  mysteries; then will you perceive how extensive this doctrine is. But  they who were not acquainted with natural philosophy (for it did not  begin to be in vogue till many years later) had no higher belief than  what natural reason could give them; they were not acquainted with the  principles and causes of things; they were often induced by certain  visions, and those generally in the night, to think that those men who  had departed from this life were still alive. And this may further be  brought as an irrefragable argument for us to believe that there are  Gods--that there never was any nation so barbarous, nor any people in  the world so savage, as to be without some notion of Gods. Many have  wrong notions of the Gods, for that is the nature and ordinary  consequence of bad customs, yet all allow that there is a certain  divine nature and energy. Nor does this proceed from the conversation  of men, or the agreement of philosophers; it is not an opinion  established by institutions or by laws; but, no doubt, in every case  the consent of all nations is to be looked on as a law of nature. Who  is there, then, that does not lament the loss of his friends,  principally from imagining them deprived of the conveniences of life?  Take away this opinion, and you remove with it all grief; for no one is  afflicted merely on account of a loss sustained by himself. Perhaps we  may be sorry, and grieve a little; but that bitter lamentation and  those mournful tears have their origin in our apprehensions that he  whom we loved is deprived of all the advantages of life, and is  sensible of his loss. And we are led to this opinion by nature, without  any arguments or any instruction.    XIV. But the greatest proof of all is, that nature herself gives a  silent judgment in favor of the immortality of the soul, inasmuch as  all are anxious, and that to a great degree, about the things which  concern futurity:        One plants what future ages shall enjoy,    as Statius saith in his Synephebi. What is his object in doing so,  except that he is interested in posterity? Shall the industrious  husbandman, then, plant trees the fruit of which he shall never see?  And shall not the great man found laws, institutions, and a republic?  What does the procreation of children imply, and our care to continue  our names, and our adoptions, and our scrupulous exactness in drawing  up wills, and the inscriptions on monuments, and panegyrics, but that  our thoughts run on futurity? There is no doubt but a judgment may be  formed of nature in general, from looking at each nature in its most  perfect specimens; and what is a more perfect specimen of a man than  those are who look on themselves as born for the assistance, the  protection, and the preservation of others? Hercules has gone to  heaven; he never would have gone thither had he not, while among men,  made that road for himself. These things are of old date, and have,  besides, the sanction of universal religion.    XV. What will you say? What do you imagine that so many and such great  men of our republic, who have sacrificed their lives for its good,  expected? Do you believe that they thought that their names should not  continue beyond their lives? None ever encountered death for their  country but under a firm persuasion of immortality! Themistocles might  have lived at his ease; so might Epaminondas; and, not to look abroad  and among the ancients for instances, so might I myself. But, somehow  or other there clings to our minds a certain presage of future ages;  and this both exists most firmly, and appears most clearly, in men of  the loftiest genius and greatest souls. Take away this, and who would  be so mad as to spend his life amidst toils and dangers? I speak of  those in power. What are the poet's views but to be ennobled after  death? What else is the object of these lines,        Behold old Ennius here, who erst      Thy fathers' great exploits rehearsed?    He is challenging the reward of glory from those men whose ancestors he  himself had ennobled by his poetry. And in the same spirit he says, in  another passage,        Let none with tears my funeral grace, for I      Claim from my works an immortality.    Why do I mention poets? The very mechanics are desirous of fame after  death. Why did Phidias include a likeness of himself in the shield of  Minerva, when he was not allowed to inscribe his name on it? What do  our philosophers think on the subject? Do not they put their names to  those very books which they write on the contempt of glory? If, then,  universal consent is the voice of nature, and if it is the general  opinion everywhere that those who have quitted this life are still  interested in something, we also must subscribe to that opinion. And if  we think that men of the greatest abilities and virtues see most  clearly into the power of nature, because they themselves are her most  perfect work, it is very probable that, as every great man is  especially anxious to benefit posterity, there is something of which he  himself will be sensible after death.    XVI. But as we are led by nature to think there are Gods, and as we  discover, by reason, of what description they are, so, by the consent  of all nations, we are induced to believe that our souls survive; but  where their habitation is, and of what character they eventually are,  must be learned from reason. The want of any certain reason on which to  argue has given rise to the idea of the shades below, and to those  fears which you seem, not without reason, to despise; for as our bodies  fall to the ground, and are covered with earth (_humus_), from whence  we derive the expression to be interred (_humari_), that has occasioned  men to imagine that the dead continue, during the remainder of their  existence, under ground; which opinion has drawn after it many errors,  which the poets have increased; for the theatre, being frequented by a  large crowd, among which are women and children, is wont to be greatly  affected on hearing such pompous verses as these,        Lo! here I am, who scarce could gain this place,      Through stony mountains and a dreary waste;      Through cliffs, whose sharpen'd stones tremendous hung,      Where dreadful darkness spread itself around.    And the error prevailed so much, though indeed at present it seems to  me to be removed, that although men knew that the bodies of the dead  had been burned, yet they conceived such things to be done in the  infernal regions as could not be executed or imagined without a body;  for they could not conceive how disembodied souls could exist; and,  therefore, they looked out for some shape or figure. This was the  origin of all that account of the dead in Homer. This was the idea that  caused my friend Appius to frame his Necromancy; and this is how there  got about that idea of the lake of Avernus, in my neighborhood,        From whence the souls of undistinguish'd shape,      Clad in thick shade, rush from the open gate      Of Acheron, vain phantoms of the dead.    And they must needs have these appearances speak, which is not possible  without a tongue, and a palate, and jaws, and without the help of lungs  and sides, and without some shape or figure; for they could see nothing  by their mind alone--they referred all to their eyes. To withdraw the  mind from sensual objects, and abstract our thoughts from what we are  accustomed to, is an attribute of great genius. I am persuaded, indeed,  that there were many such men in former ages; but Pherecydes[8] the  Syrian is the first on record who said that the souls of men were  immortal, and he was a philosopher of great antiquity, in the reign of  my namesake Tullius. His disciple Pythagoras greatly confirmed this  opinion, who came into Italy in the reign of Tarquin the Proud; and all  that country which is called Great Greece was occupied by his school,  and he himself was held in high honor, and had the greatest authority;  and the Pythagorean sect was for many ages after in such great credit,  that all learning was believed to be confined to that name.    XVII. But I return to the ancients. They scarcely ever gave any reason  for their opinion but what could be explained by numbers or  definitions. It is reported of Plato that he came into Italy to make  himself acquainted with the Pythagoreans; and that when there, among  others, he made an acquaintance with Archytas[9] and Timaeus,[10] and  learned from them all the tenets of the Pythagoreans; and that he not  only was of the same opinion with Pythagoras concerning the immortality  of the soul, but that he also brought reasons in support of it; which,  if you have nothing to say against it, I will pass over, and say no  more at present about all this hope of immortality.    _A._ What, will you leave me when you have raised my expectations so  high? I had rather, so help me Hercules! be mistaken with Plato, whom I  know how much you esteem, and whom I admire myself, from what you say  of him, than be in the right with those others.    _M._ I commend you; for, indeed, I could myself willingly be mistaken  in his company. Do we, then, doubt, as we do in other cases (though I  think here is very little room for doubt in this case, for the  mathematicians prove the facts to us), that the earth is placed in the  midst of the world, being, as it were, a sort of point, which they call  a [Greek: kentron], surrounded by the whole heavens; and that such is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14990"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement No. 819, September 12, 1891 (#4)"],[1," in this primitive form permitted  the adjustment of the lower open end in the tube, it might be another  longer reed or pipe which inclosed the air column; and thus a conical  pipe that gradually narrows to the diameter of the tongue reed must  have been early discovered, and was the original type of the pastoral  and beautiful oboe of the modern orchestra. Like the flute, the oboe  has only the soprano register, extending from B flat or natural below  middle C to F above the treble clef, two octaves and a fifth, which a  little exceeds the flute downward. The foundation of the scale is D  major, the same as the flute was before Boehm altered it. Triebert, a  skillful Parisian maker, tried to adapt Boehm's reform of the flute to  the oboe, but so far as the geometrical division of the scale was  concerned, he failed, because it altered the characteristic tone  quality of the instrument, so desirable for the balance of orchestral  coloration. But the fingering has been modified with considerable  success, although it is true by a much greater complication of means  than the more simple contrivances that preceded it, which are still  preferred by the players. The oboe reed has been much altered since  the earlier years of this century. It was formerly more like the reed  of the shawm, an instrument from which the oboe has been derived; and  that of the present bassoon. It is now made narrower, with much  advantage in the refinement of the tone. As in the flute, the notes up  to C sharp in the treble clef are produced by the normal blowing, and  simply shortening the tube by opening the sound holes. Beyond that  note, increased pressure, or overblowing, assisted by a harmonic  \"speaker\" key, produces the first harmonic, that of the octave, and so  on. The lowest notes are rough and the highest shrill; from A to D  above the treble clef, the tone quality of the oboe is of a tender  charm in melody. Although not loud, its tone is penetrating and  prominent. Its staccato has an agreeable effect. The place of the oboe  in the wood wind band between the flute and the clarinet, with the  bassoon for a bass, is beyond the possibility of improvement by any  change.    Like the flute, there was a complete family of oboes in the sixteenth  and early in the seventeenth century; the little schalmey, the discant  schalmey, from which the present oboe is derived; the alto, tenor,  pommer, and bass pommers, and the double quint or contrabass pommer.    In all these old finger hole instruments the scale begins with the  first hole, a note in the bagpipe with which the drones agree, and not  the entire tube. From the bass and double quint pommers came  ultimately the bassoon and contra-bassoon, and from the alto pommer,  an obsolete instrument for which Bach wrote, called the oboe di  caccia, or hunting oboe, an appellation unexplained, unless it had  originally a horn-like tone, and was, as it has been suggested to me  by Mr. Blaikley, used by those who could not make a real hunting horn  sound. It was bent to a knee shape to facilitate performance. It was  not exactly the cor Anglais or English horn, a modern instrument of  the same pitch which is bent like it, and of similar compass, a fifth  below the usual oboe. The tenoroon, with which the oboe di caccia has  been compared, was a high bassoon really on octave and a fifth below.  It has been sometimes overlooked that there are two octaves in pitch  between the oboe and bassoon, which has led to some confusion in  recognizing these instruments. There was an intermediate instrument a  third lower than the oboe, used by Bach, called the oboe d'amore,  which was probably used with the cornemuse or bagpipe, and another, a  third higher than the oboe, called musette (not the small bagpipe of  that name). The cor Anglais is in present use. It is a melancholy,  even mournful instrument, its sole use in the orchestra being very  suitable for situations on the stage, the effect of which it helps by  depressing the mind to sadness. Those who have heard Wagner's \"Tristan  und Isolde\" will remember, when the faithful Kurwenal sweeps the  horizon, and sees no help coming on the sea for the dying Tristan, how  pathetically the reed pipe of a careless peasant near, played in the  orchestra on a cor Anglais, colors the painful situation.    The bassoon is the legitimate bass to the oboe and to the wood wind in  general. It was evolved in the sixteenth century from the pommers and  bombards: the tenors and basses of the shawm or oboe family. With the  older instruments, the reeds were not taken hold of immediately by the  lips, but were held in a kind of cup, called _pirouette_, which only  allowed a very small part of the reed to project. In the oboe and  bassoon the player has the full control of the reed with the lips,  which is of great importance, both in expression and intonation. The  bassoon economizes length, by being turned back upon itself, and, from  its appearance, obtains in Italy and Germany the satirical appellation  of \"fagotto\" or \"fagott.\" It is made of wood, and has not, owing to  many difficulties as yet unsurmounted, undergone those changes of  construction that have partly transformed other wood wind instruments.  From this reason--and perhaps the necessity of a bassoon player  becoming intimately familiar with his instrument--bassoons by some of  the older makers--notably, Savory--are still sought after, in  preference to more modern ones. The instrument, although with  extraordinary advantages in tone, character, and adaptability, that  render it valuable to the composer, is yet complicated and capricious  for the performer; but its very imperfections remove it from the  mechanical tendencies of the age, often damaging to art; and, as the  player has to rely very much upon his ear for correct intonation, he  gets, in reality, near to the manipulation of the stringed  instruments. The bassoons play readily with the violoncellos, their  united tone being often advantageous for effect. When not so used, it  falls back into its natural relationship with the wood wind division  of the orchestra. The compass of the bassoon is from B flat, an octave  below that in the bass clef, to B flat in the treble clef, a range of  three octaves, produced by normal pressure, as far as the bass clef F.  The F below the bass clef is the true lowest note, the other seven  semitones descending to the B flat being obtained by holes and keys in  the long joint and bell. These extra notes are not overblown. The  fundamental notes are extended as in the oboes and flutes by  overflowing to another octave, and afterward to the twelfth. In modern  instruments yet higher notes, by the contrivance of small harmonic  holes and cross fingerings, can be secured. Long notes, scales,  arpeggios, are all practicable on this serviceable instrument, and in  full harmony with clarinets, or oboes and horns, it forms part of a  rich and beautiful combination. There is a very telling quality in the  upper notes of the bassoon of which composers have made use.  Structurally, a bassoon consists of several pieces, the wing, butt,  long joints, and bell, and when fitted together, they form a hollow  cone of about eight feet long, the air column tapering in diameter  from three-sixteenths of an inch at the reed to one and three-quarter  inches at the bell end.    The bending back at the butt joint is pierced in one piece of wood,  and the prolongation of the double tube is usually stopped by a  flattened oval cork, but in some modern bassoons this is replaced by a  properly curved tube. The height is thus reduced to a little over four  feet, and the holes, assisted by the artifice of piercing them  obliquely, are brought within reach of the fingers. The crook, in the  end of which the reed is inserted, is about twelve inches long, and is  adjusted to the shorter branch.    The contra-bassoon is an octave lower than the bassoon, which implies  that it should go down to the double B flat, two octaves below that in  the bass clef, but it is customary to do without the lowest as well as  the highest notes of this instrument. It is rarely used, but should  not be dispensed with. Messrs. Mahillon, of Brussels, produce a reed  contra-bass of metal, intended to replace the contra-bassoon of wood,  but probably more with the view of completing the military band than  for orchestral use. It is a conical brass tube of large proportions,  with seventeen lateral holes of wide diameter and in geometrical  relation, so that for each sound one key only is required. The compass  of this contra-bass lies between D in the double bass octave and the  lower F of the treble clef.    The sarrusophones of French invention are a complete family, made in  brass and with conical tubes pierced according to geometric relation,  so that the sarrusophone is more equal than the oboe it copies and is  intended, at least for military music, to replace. Being on a larger  scale, the sarrusophones are louder than the corresponding instruments  of the oboe family. There are six sarrusophones, from the sopranino in  E flat to the contra-bass in B flat; and to replace the contra-bassoon  in the orchestra there is a lower contrabass sarrusophone made in C,  the compass of which is from the double bass octave B flat to the  higher G in the bass clef.    Before leaving the double reed wind instruments, a few words should be  said of a family of instruments in the sixteenth century as important  as the schalmeys, pommers, and bombards, but long since extinct. This  was the cromorne, a wooden instrument with cylindrical column of air;  the name is considered to remain in the cremona stop of the organ. The  lower end is turned up like a shepherd's crook reversed, from whence  the French name \"tournebout.\" Cromorne is the German \"krummhorn;\"  there is no English equivalent known.    The tone, as in all the reed instruments of the period, was strong and"]]]
