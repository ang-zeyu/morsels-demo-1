The breast, wings and merry-thought of a  pheasant are the most highly prized, although the legs are considered  very finely flavored. Pheasants are frequently roasted with the head  left on; in that case, when dressing them, bring the head round under  the wing, and fix it on the point of a skewer.      PIGEONS.    A very good way of carving these birds is to insert the knife at fig.  1, and cut both ways to 2 and 3, when each portion may be divided into  two pieces, then served. Pigeons, if not too large, may be cut in  halves, either across or down the middle, cutting them into two equal  parts; if young and small they may be served entirely whole.    Tame pigeons should be cooked as soon as possible after they are  killed, as they very quickly lose their flavor. Wild pigeons, on the  contrary, should hang a day or two in a cool place before they are  dressed. Oranges cut into halves are used as a garnish for dishes of  small birds, such as pigeons, quail, woodcock, squabs, snipe, etc.  These small birds are either served whole or split down the back,  making two servings.      [Illustration]    MACKEREL.    The mackerel is one of the most beautiful of fish, being known by its  silvery whiteness. It sometimes attains to the length of twenty  inches, but usually, when fully grown, is about fourteen or sixteen  inches long, and about two pounds in weight. To carve a baked  mackerel, first remove the head and tail by cutting downward at 1 and  2; then split them down the back, so as to serve each person a part of  each side piece. The roe should be divided in small pieces and served  with each piece of fish. Other whole fish may be carved in the same  manner. The fish is laid upon a little sauce or folded napkin, on a  hot dish, and garnished with parsley.      BOILED SALMON.    This fish is seldom sent to the table whole, being _too_ large for any  ordinary sized family; the middle cut is considered the choicest to  boil. To carve it, first run the knife down and along the upper side  of the fish from 1 to 2, then again on the lower side from 3 to 4.  Serve the thick part, cutting it lengthwise in slices in the direction  of the line from 1 to 2, and the thin part breadthwise, or in the  direction from 5 to 6. A slice of the thick with one of the thin,  where lies the fat, should be served to each guest. Care should be  taken when carving not to break the flakes of the fish, as that  impairs its appearance. The flesh of the salmon is rich and delicious  in flavor. Salmon is in season from the first of February to the end  of August.          SOUPS.    Consomme, or Stock, forms the basis of all meat soups, and also of all  principal sauces. It is, therefore, essential to the success of these  culinary operations to know the most complete and economical method of  extracting from a certain quantity of meat the best possible stock or  broth. Fresh, uncooked beef makes the best stock, with the addition of  cracked bones, as the glutinous matter contained in them renders it  important that they should be boiled with the meat, which adds to the  strength and thickness of the soup. They are composed of an earthy  substance--to which they owe their solidity--of gelatine, and a fatty  fluid, something like marrow. _Two ounces_ of them contain as much  gelatine as _one pound_ of meat; but, in them, this is so encased in  the earthy substance, that boiling water can dissolve only the surface  of the whole bones, but by breaking them they can be dissolved more.  When there is an abundance of it, it causes the stock, when cold, to  become a jelly. The flesh of old animals contains more flavor than the  flesh of young ones. Brown meats contain more flavor than white.    Mutton is too strong in flavor for good stock, while veal, although  quite glutinous, furnishes very little nutriment.    Some cooks use meat that has once been cooked; this renders little  nourishment and destroys the flavor. It might answer for ready soup,  but for stock to keep it is not as good, unless it should be roasted  meats. Those contain higher fragrant properties; so by putting the  remains of roast meats in the stock-pot you obtain a better flavor.    The shin bone is generally used, but the neck or \"sticking-piece,\" as  the butchers call it, contains more of the substance that you want to  extract, makes a stronger and more nutritious soup, than any other  part of the animal. Meats for soup should always be put on to cook in  _cold_ water, in a covered pot, and allowed to simmer slowly for  several hours, in order that the essence of the meat may be drawn out  thoroughly, and should be carefully skimmed to prevent it from  becoming turbid, never allowed to _boil fast_ at any time, and if more  water is needed, use boiling water from the tea-kettle; cold or  lukewarm water spoils the flavor. Never salt it before the meat is  tender (as that hardens and toughens the meat), especially if the meat  is to be eaten. Take off every particle of scum as it rises, and  before the vegetables are put in.    Allow a little less than a quart of water to a pound of meat and bone,  and a teaspoonful of salt. When done, strain through a colander. If  for clear soups, strain again through a hair sieve, or fold a clean  towel in a colander set over an earthen bowl, or any dish large enough  to hold the stock. As stated before, stock is not as good when made  entirely from cooked meats, but in a family where it requires a large  joint roasted every day, the bones, and bits and underdone pieces of  beef, or the bony structure of turkey or chicken that has been left  from carving, bones of roasted poultry, these all assist in imparting  a rich dark color to soup, and would be sufficient, if stewed as  above, to furnish a family, without buying fresh meat for the purpose;  still, with the addition of a little fresh meat it would be more  nutritious. In cold weather you can gather them up for several days  and put them to cook in cold water, and when done, strain, and put  aside until needed.    Soup will be as good the second day as the first if heated to the  boiling point. It should never be left in the pot, but should be  turned into a dish or shallow pan, and set aside to get cold. Never  cover it up, as that will cause it to turn sour very quickly.    Before heating a second time, remove all the fat from the top. If this  be melted in, the flavor of the soup will certainly be spoiled.    Thickened soups require nearly double the seasoning used for thin  soups or broth.    Coloring is used in some brown soups, the chief of which is brown  burnt sugar, which is known as caramel by French cooks.    Pounded spinach leaves give a fine green color to soup. Parsley, or  the green leaves of celery put in soup, will serve instead of spinach.    Pound a large handful of spinach in a mortar, then tie it in a cloth,  and wring out all the juice; put this in the soup you wish to color  green five minutes before taking it up.    Mock turtle, and sometimes veal and lamb soups, should be this color.    Okras gives a green color to soup.    To color soup red, skin six red tomatoes, squeeze out the seeds, and  put them into the soup with the other vegetables--or take the juice  only, as directed for spinach.    For white soups, which are of veal, lamb or chicken, none but white  vegetables are used; rice, pearl barley, vermicelli, or macaroni, for  thickening.    Grated carrot gives a fine amber color to soup; it must be put in as  soon as the soup is free from scum.    Hotel and private-house stock is quite different.    Hotels use meat in such large quantities that there is always more or  less trimmings and bones of meat to add to fresh meats; that makes  very strong stock, which they use in most all soups and gravies and  other made dishes.    The meat from which soup has been made is good to serve cold thus:  Take out all the bones, season with pepper and salt, and catsup, if  liked, then chop it small, tie it in a cloth, and lay it between two  plates, with a weight on the upper one; slice it thin for luncheon or  supper; or make sandwiches of it; or make a hash for breakfast; or  make it into balls, with the addition of a little wheat flour and an  egg, and serve them fried in fat, or boil in the soup.    An agreeable flavor is sometimes imparted to soup by sticking some  cloves into the meat used for making stock; a few slices of onions  fried very brown in butter are nice; also flour browned by simply  putting it into a saucepan over the fire and stirring it constantly  until it is a dark brown.    Clear soups must be perfectly transparent, and thickened soups about  the consistency of cream. When soups and gravies are kept from day to  day in hot weather, they should be warmed up every day, and put into  fresh-scalded pans or tureens, and placed in a cool cellar. In  temperate weather, every other day may be sufficient.      HERBS AND VEGETABLES USED IN SOUPS.    Of vegetables the principal ones are carrots, tomatoes, asparagus,  green peas, okra, macaroni, green corn, beans, rice, vermicelli,  Scotch barley, pearl barley, wheat flour, mushroom, or mushroom  catsup, parsnips, beetroot, turnips, leeks, garlic, shallots and  onions; sliced onions fried with butter and flour until they are  browned, then rubbed through a sieve, are excellent to heighten the  color and flavor of brown sauces and soups. The herbs usually used in  soups are parsley, common thyme, summer savory, knotted marjoram, and  other seasonings, such as bay-leaves, tarragon, allspice, cinnamon,  nutmeg, cloves, mace, black and white pepper, red pepper, lemon peel  and juice, orange peel and juice. The latter imparts a finer flavor  and the acid much milder. These materials, with wine, and the various  catsups, combined in various proportions, are, with other ingredients,  made into almost an endless variety of excellent soups and gravies.

They swell up an' die. Wuss this year than  ever before.\"    \"Why, that is serious, dad! Poor things! That's worse than eating  loco.... Yes, I met Wilson Moore driving down the slope.\"    \"Ahuh! Wal, let's eat.\"    They took seats at the table which the cook, Jake, was loading with  steaming victuals. Supper appeared to be a rather sumptuous one this  evening, in honor of the expected guest, who had not come. Columbine  helped the old man to his favorite dishes, stealing furtive glances at  his lined and shadowed face. She sensed a subtle change in him since the  afternoon, but could not see any sign of it in his look or demeanor. His  appetite was as hearty as ever.    \"So you met Wils. Is he still makin' up to you?\" asked Belllounds,  presently.    \"No, he isn't. I don't see that he ever did--that--dad,\" she replied.    \"You're a kid in mind an' a woman in body. Thet cowpuncher has been  lovesick over you since you were a little girl. It's what kept him hyar  ridin' fer me.\"    \"Dad, I don't believe it,\" said Columbine, feeling the blood at her  temples. \"You always imagined such things about Wilson, and the other  boys as well.\"    \"Ahuh! I'm an old fool about wimmen, hey? Mebbe I was years ago. But I  can see now.... Didn't Wils always get ory-eyed when any of the other  boys shined up to you?\"    \"I can't remember that he did,\" replied Columbine. She felt a desire to  laugh, yet the subject was anything but amusing to her.    \"Wal, you've always been innocent-like. Thank the Lord you never leaned  to tricks of most pretty lasses, makin' eyes at all the men. Anyway, a  matter of three months ago I told Wils to keep away from you--thet you  were not fer any poor cowpuncher.\"    \"You never liked him. Why? Was it fair, taking him as boys come?\"    \"Wal, I reckon it wasn't,\" replied Belllounds, and as he looked up his  broad face changed to ruddy color. \"Thet boy's the best rider an' roper  I've had in years. He ain't the bronco-bustin' kind. He never drank. He  was honest an' willin'. He saves his money. He's good at handlin' stock.  Thet boy will be a rich rancher some day.\"    \"Strange, then, you never liked him,\" murmured Columbine. She felt  ashamed of the good it did her to hear Wilson praised.    \"No, it ain't strange. I have my own reasons,\" replied Belllounds,  gruffly, as he resumed eating.    Columbine believed she could guess the cause of the old rancher's  unreasonable antipathy for this cowboy. Not improbably it was because  Wilson had always been superior in every way to Jack Belllounds. The  boys had been natural rivals in everything pertaining to life on the  range. What Bill Belllounds admired most in men was paramount in Wilson  and lacking in his own son.    \"Will you put Jack in charge of your ranches, now?\" asked Columbine.    \"Not much. I reckon I'll try him hyar at White Slides as foreman. An' if  he runs the outfit, then I'll see.\"    \"Dad, he'll never run the White Slides outfit,\" asserted Columbine.    \"Wal, it is a hard bunch, I'll agree. But I reckon the boys will stay,  exceptin', mebbe, Wils. An' it'll be jest as well fer him to leave.\"    \"It's not good business to send away your best cowboy. I've heard you  complain lately of lack of men.\"    \"I sure do need men,\" replied Belllounds, seriously. \"Stock gettin' more  'n we can handle. I sent word over the range to Meeker, hopin' to get  some men there. What I need most jest now is a fellar who knows dogs an'  who'll hunt down the wolves an' lions an' bears thet're livin' off  my cattle.\"    \"Dad, you need a whole outfit to handle the packs of hounds you've got.  Such an assortment of them! There must be a hundred. Only yesterday some  man brought a lot of mangy, long-eared canines. It's funny. Why, dad,  you're the laughing-stock of the range!'    \"Yes, an' the range'll be thankin' me when I rid it of all these  varmints,\" declared Belllounds. \"Lass, I swore I'd buy every dog fetched  to me, until I had enough to kill off the coyotes an' lofers an' lions.  I'll do it, too. But I need a hunter.\"    \"Why not put Wilson Moore in charge of the hounds? He's a hunter.\"    \"Wal, lass, thet might be a good idee,\" replied the rancher, nodding his  grizzled head. \"Say, you're sort of wantin' me to keep Wils on.\"    \"Yes, dad.\"    \"Why? Do you like him so much?\"    \"I like him--of course. He has been almost a brother to me.\"    \"Ahuh! Wal, are you sure you don't like him more'n you  ought--considerin' what's in the wind?\"    \"Yes, I'm sure I don't,\" replied Columbine, with tingling cheeks.    \"Wal, I'm glad of thet. Reckon it'll be no great matter whether Wils  stays or leaves. If he wants to I'll give him a job with the hounds.\"    That evening Columbine went to her room early. It was a cozy little  blanketed nest which she had arranged and furnished herself. There was a  little square window cut through the logs and through which many a night  the snow had blown in upon her bed. She loved her little isolated  refuge. This night it was cold, the first time this autumn, and the  lighted lamp, though brightening the room, did not make it appreciably  warmer. There was a stone fireplace, but as she had neglected to bring  in wood she could not start a fire. So she undressed, blew out the lamp,  and went to bed. Columbine was soon warm, and the darkness of her little  room seemed good to her. Sleep she felt never would come that night. She  wanted to think; she could not help but think; and she tried to halt the  whirl of her mind. Wilson Moore occupied the foremost place in her  varying thoughts--a fact quite remarkable and unaccountable. She tried  to change it. In vain! Wilson persisted--on his white mustang flying  across the ridge-top--coming to her as never before--with his anger and  disapproval--his strange, poignant cry, \"Columbine!\" that haunted  her--with his bitter smile and his resignation and his mocking talk of  jealousy. He persisted and grew with the old rancher's frank praise.    \"I must not think of him,\" she whispered. \"Why, I'll be--be married  soon.... Married!\"    That word transformed her thought, and where she had thrilled she now  felt cold. She revolved the fact in mind.    \"It's true, I'll be married, because I ought--I must,\" she said, half  aloud. \"Because I can't help myself. I ought to want to--for dad's  sake.... But I don't--I don't.\"    She longed above all things to be good, loyal, loving, helpful, to show  her gratitude for the home and the affection that had been bestowed upon  a nameless waif. Bill Belllounds had not been under any obligation to  succor a strange, lost child. He had done it because he was big, noble.  Many splendid deeds had been laid at the old rancher's door. She was not  of an ungrateful nature. She meant to pay. But the significance of the  price began to dawn upon her.    \"It will change my whole life,\" she whispered, aghast.    But how? Columbine pondered. She must go over the details of that  change. No mother had ever taught her. The few women that had been in  the Belllounds home from time to time had not been sympathetic or had  not stayed long enough to help her much. Even her school life in Denver  had left her still a child as regarded the serious problems of women.    \"If I'm his wife,\" she went on, \"I'll have to be with him--I'll have to  give up this little room--I'll never be free--alone--happy, any more.\"    That was the first detail she enumerated. It was also the last.  Realization came with a sickening little shudder. And that moment gave  birth to the nucleus of an unconscious revolt.    The coyotes were howling. Wild, sharp, sweet notes! They soothed her  troubled, aching head, lulled her toward sleep, reminded her of the  gold-and-purple sunset, and the slopes of sage, the lonely heights, and  the beauty that would never change. On the morrow, she drowsily thought,  she would persuade Wilson not to kill all the coyotes; to leave a few,  because she loved them.           *       *       *       *       *    Bill Belllounds had settled in Middle Park in 1860. It was wild country,  a home of the Ute Indians, and a natural paradise for elk, deer,  antelope, buffalo. The mountain ranges harbored bear. These ranges  sheltered the rolling valley land which some explorer had named Middle  Park in earlier days.    Much of this inclosed table-land was prairie, where long grass and wild  flowers grew luxuriantly. Belllounds was a cattleman, and he saw the  possibilities there. To which end he sought the friendship of Piah,  chief of the Utes. This noble red man was well disposed toward the white  settlers, and his tribe, during those troublous times, kept peace with  these invaders of their mountain home.    In 1868 Belllounds was instrumental in persuading the Utes to relinquish  Middle Park. The slopes of the hills were heavily timbered; gold and  silver had been found in the mountains. It was a country that attracted  prospectors, cattlemen, lumbermen. The summer season was not long enough  to grow grain, and the nights too frosty for corn; otherwise Middle Park  would have increased rapidly in population.    In the years that succeeded the departure of the Utes Bill Belllounds  developed several cattle-ranches and acquired others. White Slides Ranch  lay some twenty-odd miles from Middle Park, being a winding arm of the  main valley land. Its development was a matter of later years, and  Belllounds lived there because the country was wilder. The rancher, as  he advanced in years, seemed to want to keep the loneliness that had  been his in earlier days. At the time of the return of his son to White  Slides Belllounds was rich in cattle and land, but he avowed frankly  that he had not saved any money, and probably never would. His hand was  always open to every man and he never remembered an obligation. He  trusted every one. A proud boast of his was that neither white man nor  red man had ever"]]]
