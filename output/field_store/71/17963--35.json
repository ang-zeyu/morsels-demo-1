It is, in fact, the official school  of Ottoman orthodoxy. It embraces most of those who at the present day  support the revived spiritual pretensions of Constantinople.    The pilgrimage then described in our table as Ottoman is mostly made up  of men of this theological school. It must not, however, be supposed  that anything like the whole number either of the 8500 pilgrims, or of  the 22,000,000 population they represent, is composed of Turks. The true  Ottoman Turk is probably now among the rarest of visitors to Mecca, and  it is doubtful whether the whole Turkish census in Europe and in Asia  amounts to more than four millions. With regard to the pilgrimage there  is good reason why this should be the case. In Turkey, all the  able-bodied young men, who are the first material of the Haj, are taken  from other duties for military service, and hardly any now make their  tour of the Kaaba except in the Sultan's uniform. Rich merchants, the  second material of the Haj in other lands, are almost unknown among the  Turks; and the officials, the only well-to-do class in the empire, have  neither leisure nor inclination to absent themselves from their worldly  business of intrigue.    Besides, the official Turk is already too civilized to put up readily  with the real hardships of the Haj. In spite of the alleviations  effected by the steam navigation of the Red Sea, pilgrimage is still no  small matter, and once landed at Jeddah, all things are much as they  were a hundred years ago, while the Turk has changed. With his modern  notion of dress and comfort he may indeed be excused for shrinking from  the quaint nakedness of the pilgrim garb and the bare-headed march to  Arafat under a tropical sun. Besides, there is the land journey still of  three hundred miles to make before he can reach Medina, and what to some  would be worse hardship, a wearisome waiting afterwards in the unhealthy  ports of Hejaz. The Turkish official, too, has learned to dispense with  so many of the forms of his religion that he finds no difficulty in  making himself excuses here. In fact, he seldom or never now performs  the pilgrimage.    The mass of the Ottoman Haj is made up of Kurds, Syrians, Albanians,  Circassians, Lazis, and Tartars from Russia and the Khanates, of  everything rather than real Turks. Nor are those that come distinguished  greatly for their piety or learning. The school of St. Sophia at  Constantinople has lost its old reputation as a seat of religious  knowledge; and its Ulema are known to be more occupied with the pursuit  of Court patronage than with any other science. So much indeed is this  the case that serious students often prefer a residence at Bokhara, or  even in the heretical schools of Persia, as a more real road to  learning. Turkey proper boasts at the present day few theologians of  note, and still fewer independent thinkers.    The Egyptian Haj is far more flourishing. Speaking the language of  Arabia, the citizen of Cairo is more at home in the holy places than any  inhabitant of the northern towns can be. The customs of Hejaz are very  nearly his own customs, and its climate not much more severe than his.  Cairo, too, can boast a far more ancient political connection with Mecca  than Constantinople can, for as early as the twelfth century the Sultans  of Egypt were protectors of the holy places, while even since the  Ottoman conquest, the Caliph's authority in Arabia has been almost  uninterruptedly interpreted by his representative at Cairo. So lately as  1840 this was the position of things at Mecca, and it is only since the  opening of the Suez Canal that direct administration from Constantinople  has been seriously attempted. To the present day the Viceroy of Egypt  shares with the Sultan the privilege of sending a mahmal, or camel  litter, to Mecca every year with a covering for the Kaaba. Moreover the  Azhar mosque of Cairo is the great university of Arabic-speaking races,  and its Ulema have the highest reputation of any in Islam. Egyptian  influence, therefore, must be reckoned as an important element in the  forces which make up Mohammedan opinion. The late Khedive, it is true,  did much to impair this by his infidelity and his coquetteries with  Europe, and under his reign the Egyptian Haj fell to a low level; but  Mohammed Towfik, who is a sincere, though liberal Mussulman, has already  restored much of his country's prestige at Mecca, and it is not unlikely  that in time to come Egypt, grown materially prosperous, may once more  take a leading part in the politics of Islam.[3] But of this later.    All three schools of theology are taught in the Azhar mosque, and  Egyptians are divided, according to their class, between them. The  Viceroy and the ruling clique, men of Ottoman origin, are Hanefites, and  so too are the descendants of the Circassian Beys, but the leading  merchants of Cairo and the common people of that city are Shafites,  while the fellahin of the Delta are almost entirely Malekite. Malekite,  too, are the tribes west of the Nile, following the general rule of the  population of Africa.[4]    The _Malekite_ school of religious thought differs widely from the  Hanefite. If the latter has been described as the high Church party of  Islam, this must be described as the low. It is puritanical, fierce in  its dogma, severe in its morals, and those who profess it are  undoubtedly the most fervent, the most fanatical of believers. They  represent more nearly than any other Mussulmans the ancient earnestness  of the Prophet's companions, and the sword in their hand is ever the  sword of God. Piety too, ostensible and sincere, is found everywhere  among the Malekites. Abd el Kader, the soldier saint, is their type;  and holy men by hereditary profession abound among them.    The Malekites believe with earnest faith in things supernatural,  dreaming prophetic dreams, and seeing miracles performed as every-day  occurrences. With the Arabs of Africa, unlike their kinsmen in Arabia  itself, to pray and fast is still a severe duty, and no class of  Mussulmans are more devout on pilgrimage. In Algiers and Morocco it is  as common for a young man of fortune to build a mosque as it is for him  to keep a large stud of horses. To do so poses him in the world, and a  life of prayer is strictly a life of fashion. With regard to morals he  is severe where the Koran is severe, indulgent where it indulges. Wine  with him is an abomination, and asceticism with regard to meat and  tobacco is often practised by him. On the whole he is respectable and  respected; but the reforms he would impose on Islam are too purely  reactive to be altogether acceptable to the mass of Mohammedans or  suited to the urgent necessities of the age. It is conceivable, however,  that should the revival of Islam take the form of a religious war, the  races of Africa may be found taking the leading part in it. Tripoli,  Tunis, Algiers, and Morocco contain hardy races of fighting men who may  yet trouble Europe; and fifty years of rule have not yet assimilated the  French Sahara.    It is difficult to gain accurate statistics as to the proportion of  pilgrims sent to Mecca by these various States, but it would seem the  Algerian pilgrimage is the smallest. This is due mainly to hindrances  raised by the French Government, whose policy it is to isolate their  province from the rest of the Mussulman world. An Algerian pilgrim is  called upon to produce the sum of 1000 francs before he is permitted to  embark for Jeddah, and he is subjected to various other needless  formalities. Still the number sent is large and their fervour undoubted,  though the upper classes, from a fear of losing credit with the French  authorities, rather hold aloof.    The mainstay of the Mogrebbin Haj are the Moors. These have an immense  name for zeal and religious courage at Mecca, and for the great  scrupulosity with which they perform their religious duties. There is  too among the Moors a far wider level of theological education than  among most Mussulmans. I made acquaintance while at Jeddah with a young  Arab from Shinghiat in Senegal who, Bedouin as he was, was an Alem, and  one sufficiently well versed in the Sheriat to be referred to more than  once in my presence on points of religious law and literature. I  expressed my surprise at finding a Bedouin thus learned, for he was  evidently an Arab of the Arabs, but he told me his was no exceptional  position, and that most Bedouins in Southern Morocco could read the  Koran. The Moors would have a still higher position in Islam than that  already given them were it not that they are on one point at variance  with the mass of Sunites. They do not acknowledge the modern Caliphate.  Those therefore of the Sunites who have acknowledged the Ottoman claim  are at issue with the Moors. On all other points, however, the Moors are  Sunites of the Sunites.    From the Moor to the negro is but a step, though it is a step of race,  perhaps of species. The political and religious connection of Morocco  with the Soudan is a very close one, and, whatever may be the future of  the Mediterranean provinces fronting the Spanish coast, it cannot be  doubted that the Moorish form of Mohammedanism will be perpetuated in  Central Africa. It is there, indeed, that Islam has the best certainty  of expansion and the fairest field for a propagation of its creed.  Statistics, if they could be obtained, would, I am convinced, show an  immense Mohammedan progress within the last hundred years among the  negro races, nor is this to be wondered at. Islam has so much to offer  to the children of Ham that it cannot fail to win them--so much more  than any form of Christianity or European progress can give.    The Christian missionary makes his way slowly in Africa. He has no true  brotherhood to offer the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17215"],[0,"Rembrandt (#4)"],[1," light falls upon her battered, wrinkled face, the lips are  parted as in extreme age, the hands, so magnificently painted, are folded  upon her stick. When we look at Rembrandt's portrait of _An Old Woman_ at  the Hermitage Gallery, with that touch of red so artfully and fittingly  peeping out from between the folds of her white scarf, we feel that he can  say nothing more about old age, sad, quiescent, but not unhappy; when we  look at the portrait of _An Old Lady_ in the National Gallery (No. 1675) we  feel that he can tell us no more about old age that still retains something  that is petty and eager; but in the portrait of his mother at Vienna,  Rembrandt, soaring, gives us quite another view of old age. It is the  ancient face of a mother painted by a son who loved her, who had studied  that face a thousand times, every line, and light, and aspect of the  features, and who stated all his love and knowledge upon a canvas.    Rembrandt was always inspired when he painted his own family. There is a  quality about his portraits of father, mother, Saskia, Titus, and  Hendrickje, yes! and of himself, that speaks to us as if we were intimates.  It is a personal appeal. We find it in every presentment that Rembrandt  gives us of another figure which constantly inspired his brush--the figure  of Christ. In _The Woman taken in Adultery_, it is His figure that is  articulate: it is the figure of Christ in the Emmaus picture that amazes:  it is the figure of Christ that haunts us in a dozen of the etchings.    Slowly the child, now become a man, began, as he thought, to understand  Rembrandt. Why did _The Singing Boy_ at Vienna, apart from the quality of  the painting, and the joy depicted on that young smiling face, make a  personal appeal to him? Because he is Rembrandt's son, Titus; or if Titus  was not actually the model, the features and the smile of Titus hovered  between the father and the canvas.    [Illustration: AN OLD WOMAN IN AN ARM CHAIR, WITH A BLACK HEAD-CLOTH    1654. The Hermitage, St. Petersburg.]    He found an authentic portrait of Titus in the Wallace collection, painted  in 1657, the year after Rembrandt had become bankrupt. It is one of the  most charming portraits the master ever produced, a picture that even the  most casual frequenter of galleries must pause before and love. A red cap  crowns his curly hair, which falls to his shoulders. The face has a sweet  expression; but the observant can detect traces of ill-health upon it.  Titus died before his father. Father, mother, Saskia, Hendrickje, Titus,  had all gone when the old man passed to his rest.    On the opposite wall at the Wallace collection is _The Parable of the  Unmerciful Servant_, a fine example of Rembrandt the _chiaroscurist_,  straightforward, but touched with that mystery so rare in painting, but  which, under certain conditions, was as natural to Rembrandt as drawing. It  is not always present in his work. None can say that there is any mystery  about the sober portrait pictures called _The Wife of Jan Pellicorne with  her Daughter_, and _Burgomaster Jan Pellicorne with his Son_, in the  Wallace collection. A scriptural subject was needed to inspire Rembrandt's  brush with the sense of mystery.    It was the mystery of two pictures at the National Gallery that first drew  the child to Rembrandt: it was the etchings that gave him a deeper insight  into Rembrandt's sense of mystery, and made of him a willing Gamaliel at  the master's feet.          CHAPTER III    THE APPEAL OF THE ETCHINGS      The citizen and golfer, whose commerce with Rembrandt was narrated in the  first chapter, approached the master through the writings of his  Recoverers, certain art historians and scholars, who frequent libraries,  search archives, and peruse documents; men to whom a picture is a  scientific document rather than an emotional or intellectual experience. He  was well content to end his commerce with Rembrandt there. History  interested him: to art he was apathetic.    His son, as was indicated in the second chapter, was indifferent to art  history, and he would not have walked across the road to read an unedited  document; but I see him tramping ten miles to seek a picture that promised  to stir his emotions and stimulate his imagination. Rembrandt, the maker of  pictures, had become a vivid personality, a master whom he reverenced; but  Rembrandt the etcher was unknown to him.    There are authorities who assert that in etching Rembrandt's art found its  amplest and most exquisite expression. None will deny that his is the  greatest name in etching. If all Rembrandt's pictures were destroyed, if  every record of them by photograph or copy was blotted out, the etchings  alone would form so ample a testimony to his genius that the name of  Rembrandt would still remain among the foremost artists of the world.    Rembrandt enjoyed a period of popularity with his pictures, followed by  years of decline and neglect, when lesser and more accommodating men ousted  him from popular favour. But from first to last the products of his needle  were appreciated by his contemporaries, even if he himself did not set  great store by them. He began to etch early in life: he ceased only when  his eyesight failed. He found in etching a congenial and natural means of  self-expression. His artistic fecundity threw them off in regal profusion.  The mood seized him: he would take a prepared plate, and sometimes, having  swiftly spent his emotion, he did not trouble to do more than indicate the  secondary incidents in a composition. Often he gave them away to friends  and fellow-artists, or tossed them, when they had answered their purpose in  his art life, so continuously experimental, into one of the sixty  portfolios of leather recorded in the inventory of his property.    The history of _Christ Healing the Sick_, known as _The Hundred Guilder  Print_, now the most prized of all the etchings, shows that he did not  attach much value, either artistic or monetary, to this plate. He did not  even receive a hundred guilders (under L9) for it, but gave the etching to  his friend Jan Zoomer in exchange for _The Pest_, by M. Anthony. At the  Holford sale, as has already been noted, L1750 was given for the _Hundred  Guilder Print_.    It is supposed that only two of the etchings were made expressly for  publication--the _Descent from the Cross_, and the _Ecce Homo_; but  Rembrandt may have benefited from the sale of them through the partnership  that was formed in 1660 between his son Titus and Hendrickje Stoffels.    [Illustration: MINERVA    1655. The Hermitage, St. Petersburg.]    In the eighteenth century certain connoisseurs had already made collections  of his etchings. Catalogues began to be published, and in 1797 Adam  Bartsch, keeper of the prints in the library at Vienna, issued the  well-known catalogue that bears his name in two octavo volumes. Since  Bartsch's monumental work many students of the etchings have striven to  sift the authentic from the false. Needless to say, they disagree. Here are  the figures:--    Bartsch            375    authentic etchings.  Wilson             366        \"        \"  Claussin           365        \"        \"  Blanc              353        \"        \"  Middleton-Wake     329        \"        \"  de Seidlitz        260        \"        \"  Legros             71-113     \"        \"    M. de Seidlitz's list of 260 was arrived at through consultation with  several authorities, and that number is now accepted as approximately  correct.    Our enthusiast knew nothing of the work of the labourers in Rembrandt's  etching vineyard. He was quite ignorant of the expert contributions of Sir  Francis Haden, P.G. Hamerton, and Mr. Frederick Wedmore, although his  father, had he been a communicative man, could have discoursed learnedly on  their efforts. Fate so willed it that he came to Rembrandt's etchings by  chance, and, being sensitively alive to beauty and idealism, they merged  into his life, and became as it were a personal possession.    On a certain day, in the window of one of those delightful London shops  where first editions, prints, pieces of pottery, and odds and ends tempting  to the virtuoso, are exposed for sale, he saw a small opulent picture by  Monticelli. Entering to inquire the price, he discovered, as he had feared,  that it was far beyond his bank balance. At the invitation of the  proprietor, who seemed delighted that his goods should be admired, he  stayed to \"look round.\" Strewn upon a rosewood, inlaid table were a hundred  and more etchings. Many were quite small, heads of men and women minutely  and beautifully wrought; others, larger in size, were Biblical subjects;  some were weird and fantastical; one, for example, showed a foreshortened  figure lying before an erection, upon which a skinny bird stood with  outstretched wings, flanked by ugly angel boys blowing trumpets.    [Illustration: TITUS IN A RED CAP AND A GOLD CHAIN    1657. The Wallace Collection, London.]    \"The best are sold,\" said the gentle proprietor.    The enthusiast was about to ask the name of the artist, when he suddenly  caught sight of the _Christ at Emmaus_. His blood stirred in him. That  little shop became an altar of art, and he an initiate. It was not the same  version as the Louvre picture, but only one mind--the mind of Rembrandt,  only one heart--the heart of Rembrandt, could have so felt and stated the  pathos and emotion of that scene. Controlling his excitement, he turned  over the prints and paused, startled, before _Abraham's Sacrifice_. What  was it that moved him? He could hardly say. But he was moved to an  extraordinary degree by that angel standing, with outstretched wings, by  Abraham's side, hiding the kneeling boy's eyes with his hand, staying the  knife at the supreme moment. He turned the prints, and paused again before  _The Prodigal Son_. Some might call the face of the kneeling prodigal  hideous, might"]]]
