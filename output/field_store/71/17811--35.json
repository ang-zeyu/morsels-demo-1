I went there three  afternoons together, and, as I observed, there were two-thirds of the  people that were together saw, and a third that saw not; and, _though I  could see nothing_, there was such a fright and trembling on those that  did see, that was discernible to all from those that saw not. There was  a gentleman standing next to me who spoke as too many gentlemen and  others speak, who said, 'A pack of damned witches and warlocks that have  the second sight! the devil ha't do I see;' and immediately there was a  discernible change in his countenance. With as much fear and trembling  as any woman I saw there, he called out, 'All you that do not see, say  nothing; for I persuade you it is matter of fact, and discernible to all  that is not stone-blind.' And those who did see told what works (_i.e._,  locks) the guns had, and their length and wideness, and what handles the  swords had, whether small or three-barr'd, or Highland guards, and the  closing knots of the bonnets, black or blue; and those who did see them  there, whenever they went abroad, saw a bonnet and a sword drop in the  way.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: Walker's \"Lives,\" Edinburgh, 1827, vol. i. p. xxxvi. It is  evident that honest Peter believed in the apparition of this martial  gear on the principle of Partridge's terror for the ghost of Hamlet--not  that he was afraid himself, but because Garrick showed such evident  marks of terror.]    This singular phenomenon, in which a multitude believed, although only  two-thirds of them saw what must, if real, have been equally obvious to  all, may be compared with the exploit of the humourist, who planted  himself in an attitude of astonishment, with his eyes riveted on the  well-known bronze lion that graces the front of Northumberland House in  the Strand, and having attracted the attention of those who looked at  him by muttering, \"By heaven it wags! it wags again!\" contrived in a few  minutes to blockade the whole street with an immense crowd, some  conceiving that they had absolutely seen the lion of Percy wag his tail,  others expecting' to witness the same phenomenon.    On such occasions as we have hitherto mentioned, we have supposed that  the ghost-seer has been in full possession of his ordinary powers of  perception, unless in the case of dreamers, in whom they may have been  obscured by temporary slumber, and the possibility of correcting  vagaries of the imagination rendered more difficult by want of the  ordinary appeal to the evidence of the bodily senses. In other respects  their blood beat temperately, they possessed the ordinary capacity of  ascertaining the truth or discerning the falsehood of external  appearances by an appeal to the organ of sight. Unfortunately, however,  as is now universally known and admitted, there certainly exists more  than one disorder known to professional men of which one important  symptom is a disposition to see apparitions.    This frightful disorder is not properly insanity, although it is  somewhat allied to that most horrible of maladies, and may, in many  constitutions, be the means of bringing it on, and although such  hallucinations are proper to both. The difference I conceive to be that,  in cases of insanity, the mind of the patient is principally affected,  while the senses, or organic system, offer in vain to the lunatic their  decided testimony against the fantasy of a deranged imagination. Perhaps  the nature of this collision--between a disturbed imagination and organs  of sense possessed of their usual accuracy--cannot be better described  than in the embarrassment expressed by an insane patient confined in the  Infirmary of Edinburgh. The poor man's malady had taken a gay turn. The  house, in his idea, was his own, and he contrived to account for all  that seemed inconsistent with his imaginary right of property--there  were many patients in it, but that was owing to the benevolence of his  nature, which made him love to see the relief of distress. He went  little, or rather never abroad--but then his habits were of a domestic  and rather sedentary character. He did not see much company--but he  daily received visits from the first characters in the renowned medical  school of this city, and he could not therefore be much in want of  society. With so many supposed comforts around him--with so many visions  of wealth and splendour--one thing alone disturbed the peace of the poor  optimist, and would indeed have confounded most _bons vivants_. \"He was  curious,\" he said, \"in his table, choice in his selection of cooks, had  every day a dinner of three regular courses and a dessert; and yet,  somehow or other, everything he eat _tasted of porridge_.\" This dilemma  could be no great wonder to the friend to whom the poor patient  communicated it, who knew the lunatic eat nothing but this simple  aliment at any of his meals. The case was obvious. The disease lay in  the extreme vivacity of the patient's imagination, deluded in other  instances, yet not absolutely powerful enough to contend with the honest  evidence of his stomach and palate, which, like Lord Peter's brethren in  \"The Tale of a Tub,\" were indignant at the attempt to impose boiled  oatmeal upon them, instead of such a banquet as Ude would have displayed  when peers were to partake of it. Here, therefore, is one instance of  actual insanity, in which the sense of taste controlled and attempted to  restrain the ideal hypothesis adopted by a deranged imagination. But the  disorder to which I previously alluded is entirely of a bodily  character, and consists principally in a disease of the visual organs,  which present to the patient a set of spectres or appearances which have  no actual existence. It is a disease of the same nature which renders  many men incapable of distinguishing colours; only the patients go a  step further, and pervert the external form of objects. In their case,  therefore, contrary to that of the maniac, it is not the mind, or rather  the imagination, which imposes upon and overpowers the evidence of the  senses, but the sense of seeing (or hearing) which betrays its duty and  conveys false ideas to a sane intellect.    More than one learned physician, who have given their attestations to  the existence of this most distressing complaint, have agreed that it  actually occurs, and is occasioned by different causes. The most  frequent source of the malady is in the dissipated and intemperate  habits of those who, by a continued series of intoxication, become  subject to what is popularly called the Blue Devils, instances of which  mental disorder may be known to most who have lived for any period of  their lives in society where hard drinking was a common vice. The joyous  visions suggested by intoxication when the habit is first acquired, in  time disappear, and are supplied by frightful impressions and scenes,  which destroy the tranquillity of the unhappy debauchee. Apparitions of  the most unpleasant appearance are his companions in solitude, and  intrude even upon his hours of society: and when by an alteration of  habits, the mind is cleared of these frightful ideas, it requires but  the slightest renewal of the association to bring back the full tide of  misery upon the repentant libertine.    Of this the following instance was told to the author by a gentleman  connected with the sufferer. A young man of fortune, who had led what is  called so gay a life as considerably to injure both his health and  fortune, was at length obliged to consult the physician upon the means  of restoring, at least, the former. One of his principal complaints was  the frequent presence of a set of apparitions, resembling a band of  figures dressed in green, who performed in his drawing-room a singular  dance, to which he was compelled to bear witness, though he knew, to his  great annoyance, that the whole _corps de ballet_ existed only in his  own imagination. His physician immediately informed him that he had  lived upon town too long and too fast not to require an exchange to a  more healthy and natural course of life. He therefore prescribed a  gentle course of medicine, but earnestly recommended to his patient to  retire to his own house in the country, observe a temperate diet and  early hours, practising regular exercise, on the same principle avoiding  fatigue, and assured him that by doing so he might bid adieu to black  spirits and white, blue, green, and grey, with all their trumpery. The  patient observed the advice, and prospered. His physician, after the  interval of a month, received a grateful letter from him, acknowledging  the success of his regimen. The greens goblins had disappeared, and with  them the unpleasant train of emotions to which their visits had given  rise, and the patient had ordered his town-house to be disfurnished and  sold, while the furniture was to be sent down to his residence in the  country, where he was determined in future to spend his life, without  exposing himself to the temptations of town. One would have supposed  this a well-devised scheme for health. But, alas! no sooner had the  furniture of the London drawing-room been placed in order in the gallery  of the old manor-house, than the former delusion returned in full force:  the green _figurantes_, whom the patient's depraved imagination had so  long associated with these moveables, came capering and frisking to  accompany them, exclaiming with great glee, as if the sufferer should  have been rejoiced to see them, \"Here we all are--here we all are!\" The  visionary, if I recollect right, was so much shocked at their  appearance, that he retired abroad, in despair that any part of Britain  could shelter him from the daily persecution of this domestic ballet.    There is reason to believe that such cases"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14466"],[0,"South African Memories (#4)"],[1,"that  Kimberley hardly dared breathe during the next momentous days, when the  fate of \"the Doctor,\" as he was universally called, and of his men, who  were nearly all locally known, was in suspense.    During many an evening of that eventful week we used to sit out after  dinner under the rays of a glorious full moon, in the most perfect  climatic conditions, and hear heated discussions of the pros and cons of  this occurrence, which savoured more of medieval times than of our own.  The moon all the while looked down so calmly, and the Southern Cross  stood out clear and bright. One wondered what they might not have told  us of scenes being enacted on the mysterious veldt, not 300 miles away.  It was not till Saturday, January 4, that we knew what had happened, and  any hopes we had entertained that the freebooters had either joined  forces with their friends in Johannesburg, or else had made good their  escape, were dashed to the ground as the fulness of the catastrophe  became known. For hours, however, the aghast Kimberleyites refused to  believe that Dr. Jameson and his entire corps had been taken prisoners,  having been hopelessly outnumbered and outmanoeuvred after several  hours' fighting at Krugersdorp; and, when doubt was no longer possible,  loud and deep were the execrations levelled at the Johannesburgers, who,  it was strenuously reiterated, had invited the Raiders to come to their  succour, and who, when the pinch came, never even left the town to go to  their assistance. If the real history of the Raid is ever written, when  the march of time renders such a thing possible, it will be interesting  reading; but, as matters stand now, it is better to say as little as  possible of such a deplorable fiasco, wherein the only points which  stood out clearly appeared to be that Englishmen were as brave, and  perhaps also as foolhardy, as ever; that President Kruger, while  pretending to shut his eyes, had known exactly all that was going  forward; that the Boers had lost nothing of their old skill in shooting  and ambushing, while the rapid rising and massing of their despised  forces was as remarkable in its way as Jameson's forced march.    It was said at the time that the proclamation issued by the Government  at home, repudiating the rebels, was the factor which prevented the  Johannesburgers from joining forces with the Raiders when they arrived  at Krugersdorp, as no doubt had been arranged, and that this step of the  Home Government had, curiously enough, not been foreseen by the  organizers of this deeply-laid plot. There is no doubt that there were  two forces at work in Johannesburg, as, indeed, I had surmised during  our voyage out: the one comprising the financiers, which strove to  attain its ends by manifesto and public meeting, with the hint of  sterner measures to follow; and the other impatient of delay, and thus  impelled to seek the help of those who undoubtedly became freebooters  the moment they crossed the Transvaal border. Certainly Dr. Jameson's  reported words seemed to echo with reproach and disappointment--the  reproach of a man who has been deceived; but whatever his feelings were  at that moment of despair, when his lucky star seemed at length to have  deserted him with a vengeance, I happen to know he never bore any  lasting grudge against his Johannesburg friends, and that he remained on  terms of perfect friendship even with the five members of the Reform  Committee, with whom all the negotiations had gone forward. These  included Colonel Frank Rhodes,[3] always one of his favourite  companions.    As an instance of how acute was the feeling suddenly roused respecting  Englishmen, I remember that Mr. Harry Lawson, who was staying in the  same house as ourselves, and had decided to leave for Johannesburg as  special correspondent to his father's paper, the _Daily Telegraph_, was  actually obliged to travel under a foreign name; and even then, if my  memory serves me right, he did not succeed in reaching the Rand. In the  meantime, as the daily papers received fuller details, harrowing  accounts came to hand of the exodus from Johannesburg of men, women, and  children travelling twenty in a compartment meant for eight, while  others, not so fortunate, had to put up with cattle-trucks. The Boers  were said to have shown themselves humane and magnanimous. Mr.  Chamberlain, the papers wrote, was strengthening the hands of the  President, to avert civil war, which must have been dangerously near;  but the most important man of the moment in South Africa was grudgingly  admitted to be \"Oom Paul.\" His personal influence alone, it was stated,  had restrained his wild bands of armed burghers, with which the land was  simply bristling, and he was then in close confabulation with Her  Majesty's High Commissioner, Sir Hercules Robinson, whom he had summoned  to Pretoria to deal with such refractory Englishmen. The journals also  took advantage of the occasion to bid Kruger remember this was the  opportunity to show himself forgiving, and to strengthen his corrupt  Government, thereby earning the gratitude of those Afrikanders, for  whom, indeed, he was not expected to have any affection, but to whom he  was indebted for the present flourishing financial state of his  republic, which, it was called to mind, was next door to bankrupt when  England declared its independence in 1884. If such articles were  translated and read out to that wily old President, as he sipped his  coffee on his stoep, with his bland and inscrutable smile, it must have  added zest to his evening pipe. I read in Mr. Seymour Fort's \"Life of  Dr. Jameson\" that the Raid cost the Chartered Company L75,000 worth of  material, most of which passed into the hands of the Boer Government,  while the confiscated arms at Johannesburg amounted to several thousand  rifles and a great deal of ammunition. Respecting the guns taken from  Jameson's force, curiously enough, we surmised during the siege of  Mafeking, four years later, that some of these were being used against  us. Their shells fired into the town, many of which did not explode, and  of which I possess a specimen, were the old seven-pound studded M.L.  type, with the Woolwich mark on them.

CHAPTER III         THE IMMEDIATE RESULTS OF THE RAID--THE RAIDERS THEMSELVES         \"The fly sat on the axle-tree of the chariot-wheel, and       said, 'What a dust do I raise!'\"--AEsop.      Oom Paul was in the proud position of this fly in the weeks immediately  following the Raid, as well as during many years to come. When we  returned to Cape Town early in January, 1896, we found everything in a  turmoil. Mr. Rhodes had resigned the premiership and had left for  Kimberley, where he had met with a most enthusiastic reception, and Mr.  Beit had been left in possession at Groot Schuurr. The latter gentleman  appeared quite crushed at the turn events had taken--not so much on  account of his own business affairs, which must have been in a critical  state, as in regard to the fate of Mr. Lionel Philips, his partner; this  gentleman, as well as the other four members of the Reform Committee,[4]  and a few lesser lights besides, had all been arrested during the past  week at Johannesburg, and charged with high treason. Even at Cape Town,  Captain Bettelheim and Mr. S. Joel, who had left the Transvaal, had one  forenoon been requested to accompany some mysterious gentleman, and,  very much to their surprise, had found themselves lodged in Her  Majesty's gaol before lunch. This occurrence came as a bombshell to the  Cape Town community, it having been assumed that there was no  extradition for political offences. Johannesburg was known to be  disarming almost unconditionally \"in consequence of a personal appeal  from the Governor,\" and another telegram informed the world that the men  in so doing were broken-hearted, but were making the sacrifice in order  to save Dr. Jameson's life. Some unkind friends remarked that their  grief must have been tempered with relief, in ridding themselves of the  weapons that they had talked so much about, and yet did not use when the  time for action came. However, the ways of Providence are wonderful, and  this inglorious finale was probably the means of averting a terrible  civil war. Sir Hercules Robinson was still at Pretoria, conferring with  the President, who, it was opined, was playing with him, as nothing  either regarding the fate of Dr. Jameson and his officers, or of the  political prisoners, had been settled. It was even rumoured that there  was a serious hitch in the negotiations, and that Lord Salisbury had  presented an ultimatum to the effect that, unless the President ratified  the Convention of 1884, and ceased intriguing with Germany, war with  England would ensue. This story was never confirmed, and I think the  wish was father to the thought. I remember, during those eventful days,  attending with Mrs. Harry Lawson a garden-party at Newlands, given by  Lady Robinson, who was quite a remarkable personality, and an old friend  and admirer of the ex-Prime Minister's. The gardens showed to their  greatest advantage in the brilliant sunshine, and an excellent band  played charming tunes under the trees; but everyone was so  preoccupied--and no one more than the hostess--that it was rather a  depressing entertainment.    At last events began to shape themselves. We learnt that the Governor  had left Pretoria on January 15, and that the military prisoners,  including most of the troopers, were to be sent home to England  immediately, for the leaders to stand their trial. The same morning I  heard privately that Mr. Rhodes meant to leave by that very evening's  mail-steamer for England, to face the inquiry which would certainly  ensue, and, if possible, to save the Charter of that Company with which  he had so indissolubly connected himself, and which was, so "]]]
