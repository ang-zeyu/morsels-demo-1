One day the Prince Siddartha saw the grooms    Gathered about a stallion, snowy white,    Descended from that great Nisaean stock    His fathers brought from Iran's distant plain,    Named Kantaka.  Some held him fast with chains    Till one could mount.  He, like a lion snared,    Frantic with rage and fear, did fiercely bound.    They cut his tender mouth with bloody bit,    Beating his foaming sides until the Prince,    Sterner than was his wont, bade them desist,    While he spoke soothingly, patted his head    And stroked his neck, and dropped those galling chains,    When Kantaka's fierce flaming eyes grew mild,    He quiet stood, by gentleness subdued--    Such mighty power hath gentleness and love--    And from that day no horse so strong and fleet,    So kind and true, easy to check and guide,    As Kantaka, Siddartha's noble steed.      To playmates he was gentle as a girl;    Yet should the strong presume upon their strength    To overbear or wrong those weaker than themselves,    His sturdy arm and steady eye checked them,    And he would gently say, \"Brother, not so;    Our strength was given to aid and not oppress.\"    For in an ancient book he found a truth--    A book no longer read, a truth forgot,    Entombed in iron castes, and buried deep    In speculations and in subtle creeds--    That men, high, low, rich, poor, are brothers all,[10]    Which, pondered much in his heart's fruitful soil,    Had taken root as a great living truth    That to a mighty doctrine soon would grow,    A mighty tree to heal the nations with its leaves--    Like some small grain of wheat, appearing dead,    In mummy-case three thousand years ago[11]    Securely wrapped and sunk in Egypt's tombs,    Themselves buried beneath the desert sands,    Which now brought forth, and planted in fresh soil,    And watered by the dews and rains of heaven,    Shoots up and yields a hundred-fold of grain,    Until in golden harvests now it waves    On myriad acres, many thousand miles    From where the single ancient seed had grown.      Thus he grew up with all that heart could wish    Or power command; his very life itself,    So fresh and young, sound body with sound mind,    The living fountain of perpetual joy.    Yet he would often sit and sadly think    Sad thoughts and deep, and far beyond his years;    How sorrow filled the world; how things were shared--    One born to waste, another born to want;    One for life's cream, others to drain its dregs;    One born a master, others abject slaves.    And when he asked his masters to explain,    When all were brothers, how such things could be,    They gave him speculations, fables old,    How Brahm first Brahmans made to think for all,    And then Kshatriyas, warriors from their birth,    Then Sudras, to draw water and hew wood.    \"But why should one for others think, when all    Must answer for themselves?  Why brothers fight?    And why one born another's slave, when all    Might serve and help each other?\" he would ask.    But they could only answer: \"Never doubt,    For so the holy Brahmans always taught.\"    Still he must think, and as he thought he sighed,    Not for his petty griefs that last an hour,    But for the bitter sorrows of the world    That crush all men, and last from age to age.      The good old king saw this--saw that the prince,    The apple of his eye, dearer than life,    Stately in form, supple and strong in limb,    Quick to learn every art of peace and war,    Displaying and excelling every grace    And attribute of his most royal line,    Whom all would follow whereso'er he led,    So fit to rule the world if he would rule,    Thought less of ruling than of saving men.    He saw the glory of his ancient house    Suspended on an if--if he will rule    The empire of the world, and power to crush    Those cruel, bloody kings who curse mankind,    And power to make a universal peace;    If not this high career, with glory crowned,    Then seeking truth through folly's devious ways;    By self-inflicted torture seeking bliss,    And by self-murder seeking higher life;    On one foot standing till the other pine,    Arms stretched aloft, fingers grown bloodless claws,    Or else, impaled on spikes, with festering sores    Covered from head to foot, the body wastes    With constant anguish and with slow decay.[12]    \"Can this be wisdom?  Can such a life be good    That shuns all duties lying in our path--    Useless to others, filled with grief and pain?    Not so my father's god teaches to live.    Rising each morning most exact in time,    He bathes the earth and sky with rosy light    And fills all nature with new life and joy;    The cock's shrill clarion calls us to awake    And breathe this life and hear the bursts of song    That fill each grove, inhale the rich perfume    Of opening flowers, and work while day shall last.    Then rising higher, he warms each dank, cold spot,    Dispels the sickening vapors, clothes the fields    With waving grain, the trees with golden fruit,    The vines with grapes; and when 'tis time for rest,    Sinks in the west, and with new glory gilds    The mountain-tops, the clouds and western sky,    And calls all nature to refreshing sleep.    If he be God, the useful are like God;    If not, God made the sun, who made all men    And by his great example teaches them    The diligent are wise, the useful good.\"      Sorely perplexed he called his counselors,    Grown gray in serving their beloved king,    And said: \"Friends of my youth, manhood and age,    So wise in counsel and so brave in war,    Who never failed in danger or distress,    Oppressed with fear, I come to you for aid.    You know the prophecies, that from my house    Shall come a king, or savior of the world.    You saw strange signs precede Siddartha's birth,    And saw the ancient sage whom no one knew    Fall down before the prince, and hail my house.    You heard him tell the queen she soon would die,    And saw her sink in death as in sweet sleep;    You laid her gently on her funeral pile,    And heard my cry of anguish, when the sage    Again appeared and bade me not to weep    For her as dead who lived and loved me still.    We saw the prince grow up to man's estate,    So strong and full of manliness and grace,    And wise beyond his teachers and his years,    And thought in him the prophecies fulfilled,    And that with glory he would rule the world    And bless all men with universal peace.    But now dark shadows fall athwart our hopes.    Often in sleep the prince will start and cry    As if in pain, 'O world, sad world, I come!'    But roused, he'll sometimes sit the livelong day,    Forgetting teachers, sports and even food,    As if with dreadful visions overwhelmed,    Or buried in great thoughts profound and deep.    But yet to see our people, riding forth,    To their acclaims he answers with such grace    And gentle stateliness, my heart would swell    As I would hear the people to each other say;    'Who ever saw such grace and grandeur joined?'    Yet while he answers gladness with like joy,    His eyes seem searching for the sick and old,    The poor, and maimed, and blind--all forms of grief,    And oft he'd say, tears streaming from his eyes,[13]    'Let us return; my heart can bear no more.'    One day we saw beneath a peepul-tree    An aged Brahman, wasted with long fasts,    Loathsome with self-inflicted ghastly wounds,    A rigid skeleton, standing erect,    One hand stretched out, the other stretched aloft,    His long white beard grown filthy by neglect.    Whereat the prince with shuddering horror shook,    And cried, 'O world! must I be such for thee?'    And once he led the chase of a wild boar    In the great forest near the glacier's foot;    On Kantaka so fleet he soon outstripped    The rest, and in the distance disappeared.    But when at night they reached the rendezvous,    Siddartha was not there; and through the night    They searched, fearing to find their much loved prince    A mangled corpse under some towering cliff,    But searched in vain, and searched again next day,    Till in despair they thought to bring me word    The prince was lost, when Kantaka was seen    Loose-reined and free, and near Siddartha sat    Under a giant cedar's spreading shade.    Absorbed in thought, in contemplation lost,    Unconscious that a day and night had passed.    I cannot reason with such earnestness--    I dare not chide such deep and tender love,    But much I fear his reason's overthrow    Or that he may become like that recluse    He shuddered at, and not a mighty king    With power to crush the wrong and aid the right.    How can we turn his mind from such sad thoughts    To life's full joys, the duties of a king,    And his great destiny so long foretold?\"      The oldest and the wisest answered him:    \"Most noble king, your thoughts have long been mine.    Oft have I seen him lost in musings sad,    And overwhelmed with this absorbing love.    I know no cure for such corroding thoughts    But thoughts less sad, for such absorbing love    But stronger love.\"                     \"But how awake such thoughts?\"    The king replied.  \"How kindle such a love?    His loves seem but as phosphorescent flames    That skim the surface, leaving him heart-whole--    All but this deep and all-embracing love    That folds within its arms a suffering world.\"      \"Yes, noble king, so roams the antlered deer,    Adding each year a branch to his great horns,    Until the unseen archer lays him low.    So lives our prince; but he may see the day    Two laughing eyes shall pierce his inmost soul,    And make his whole frame quiver with new fire.    The next full moon he reaches man's estate.    We all remember fifty years ago    When you became a man, the sports and games,    The contests of fair women and brave men,    In beauty, arts and arms, that filled three days    With joy and gladness, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14366"],[0,"Argentina from a British Point of View, and Notes on Argentine Life (#4)"],[1,"and frugal in their living, and many thousands could go back to their  own country with wealth which has been acquired by constant and  assiduous attention to the economies of life.    It has often been said that an Englishman will starve where an Italian  will thrive, and in some respects this is true; but it would be better  expressed if it were stated that an Italian can adapt himself to  circumstances better than an Englishman. At the same time, I doubt if an  Italian would come off best were the two placed on a desert island where  instantaneous action, grit, and endurance were called for.    Many things are said of an Englishman, and none fits his character  better than that which gives him the privilege of \"grumbling,\" and this  characteristic becomes more marked when he is able to grumble with one  of his own kith and kin. I have heard Argentines praise Englishmen, who,  they say, manage their estancias far and away beyond all others, but at  the same time they have told me that they would never allow two  Englishmen on their place at once.    It has been said that many of the immigrants do not intend to settle in  the country. Probably this idea has gained ground on account of the  large numbers of the labouring population, who are attracted to  Argentina by the high wages ruling during the harvest time, and then  find it pays them to go home and secure the European harvest, but  generally these men come out again to stay. They have acquired a  knowledge of the country, and often enough have also acquired an  interest in some land, and they return, bringing their families, to  adopt Argentina as their home--for a period at least.    A glance at the statistics prepared by the authorities in Buenos Aires  shows that during the last fifty-two years 4,250,980 persons entered as  immigrants, and out of this number only 1,690,783 returned, leaving in  the country 2,560,197 individuals, or an average of 50,000 workers per  annum. These figures have become even more marked of recent years.  Taking the last five years, the country has received on an average  249,000 immigrants per annum; of these, 103,000 went back. In other  words, 727,670 have made their homes within the borders of Argentina  during the past five years, and of these at least 500,000 were  agriculturists.    It is not to be wondered at, then, that the exports, chiefly made up of  agricultural produce, have shown extraordinary progress. Facing this  page is a diagram showing the agricultural exportation from 1900 to  1908.    [Illustration: AGRICULTURAL EXPORTATION INCLUDING WHEAT, LINSEED, OATS,  MAIZE, ETC.]    [Illustration: CULTIVATED AREA IN HECTARES. (1 HECTARE = 2.471 ACRES)]    Nothing can be more eloquent than the figures shown in this diagram.  This remarkable progress, almost steady in its upward march, is not in  one direction only. Argentina is an ideal country for agriculturists,  and in every branch of that industry progress has been made. Greater  care is being taken to-day in working up the by-products of the cattle  business. More varied crops are being grown, and vegetable by-products  are being economically looked after. The forests of Argentina are also  being worked for the benefit of mankind. The Quebracho Colorado tree  forms a very important item of export. It is sent out of the country  either in the form of logs, of which no less than 254,571 tons were  exported in 1908, or in the form of an extract for tanning purposes;  48,162 tons of this extract were made and exported in 1908, and a small  quantity of the wood was exported in the shape of sawdust. The total  value of Quebracho Colorado exported in various forms in that year was,  as already stated, L1,200,000. This means that the Quebracho forests are  being depleted at the rate of half a million tons per annum for export  purposes alone, in addition to the enormous quantities used for  sleepers, etc., in the country.    The area in acres under cultivation for the year 1908 was 46,174,250, an  increase of 265 per cent, on the land under cultivation in the year  1895.    The diagram facing this page shows the area in hectares cultivated from  1897 to 1908:--    WHEAT--The area under cultivation for wheat shows an increase of 89 per  cent, in ten years from--    8,000,000 acres in cultivation in 1898, to  15,157,750  \"   \"       \"      \"  1908    LINSEED--shows an increase of 361 per cent, from--    831,972 acres in cultivation in 1898, to  3,835,750 \"   \"       \"      \"  1908    MAIZE--increased by 250 per cent., and other crops, including Oats, 300  per cent. in the same period.    The United Kingdom purchased from Argentina and retained for its own use  (in round figures) during the year 1908--    WHEAT       to the value of L13,000,000  MAIZE          \"       \"      5,600,000  FROZEN MEAT    \"       \"      9,300,000                              -----------            Making a total of L27,900,000                              -----------    Indeed, we buy from Argentina nearly 25 per cent. of our total food  purchased abroad, and she supplies nearly 29 per cent. of our corn and  grain requirements. These figures again clearly demonstrate that we have  a vital interest in the well-being of our friends across the sea.    In every direction Argentina has progressed, and judging from the past  we may look with confidence to the future; the total area of the  Republic is 776,064,000 acres, and certainly it is within the bounds of  reasonable forecast to consider that 100,000,000 acres of this land will  be, when opened up by railways, and other facilities, available for  corn-growing. To-day only one-fifth of this available area is being  cultivated, and another 43,000,000 acres are being utilised for feeding  purposes; thus, only 63,000,000 out of 776,000,000 acres are being  occupied. The chief reason why more is not utilised is because there is  not sufficient labour available.      Argentina                   has   5    inhabitants per square mile.    Russia                       \"   18         \"             \"    Canada, Newfoundland, etc.   \"    1-1/2     \"             \"    Australia                    \"    1-1/3     \"             \"    U. Kingdom                   \"  364         \"             \"    Belgium                      \"  625         \"             \"    Germany                      \"  290         \"             \"    Not only is there an enormous tract of land lying dormant, but the  productive power of land now under cultivation may be vastly increased  if farmers will devote their attention to improving the conditions of  cultivation. 11.3 bushels of wheat per acre is not high-class farming,  yet this is the average production for Argentina. Manitoba in 1908  produced 13-1/2 bushels per acre, Saskatchewan, 17 bushels. In the  fourteenth century England only produced 10 bushels per acre, but we  have improved this yield to 30 bushels, while Roumania has increased her  yield from 15 bushels per acre in 1890, to 23 bushels in 1908. France  has increased her yield from 17 bushels in 1884, to 20 bushels in 1908.  Germany has increased her yield per acre from 20 bushels in 1899, to 30  bushels in 1908. So that we may not only look forward to a greater area  being placed under cultivation, but we may reasonably expect heavier  crops, if land proprietors will bring science to bear on their work of  development. Indeed, with land rising in price, with an increasing  influx of immigrants, and with more intelligent cultivation of the soil,  the land must of necessity give a far larger yield than it has done  heretofore.    The following tables, taken from the Board of Trade returns, show from  whence England draws some of her supplies. They also show how  prominently Argentina figures as a food producer. The first table  includes corn and meat; the second gives corn alone, and the third meat  alone:--    FOOD IMPORTED INTO AND RETAINED BY THE UNITED KINGDOM IN 1908.
