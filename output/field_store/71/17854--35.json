At  the end of one hour the work was done, and all flew out again at the  windows. Then Cinderella brought the dish to her mother, overjoyed at  the thought that now she should go to the feast. But she said, \"No,  no! Girl, you have no clothes and cannot dance, you shall not go.\" And  when Cinderella begged very hard to go, she said, \"If you can in one  hour's time pick two of these dishes of peas out of the ashes, you  shall go too.\" And thus she thought she should at last get rid of her.  So she shook two dishes of peas into the ashes; but the little maiden  went out into the garden at the back of the house, and cried as  before--          \"Hither, hither, through the sky.        Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!        Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,        Hither, hither, haste away!        One and all, come help me quick,        Haste ye, haste ye--pick, pick, pick!\"    Then first came two white doves in at the kitchen window; and next  came the turtle-doves; and after them all the little birds under  heaven came chirping and hopping about, and flew down about the ashes;  and the little doves put their heads down and set to work, pick, pick,  pick; and then the others began to pick, pick, pick; and they put  all the good grain into the dishes, and left all the ashes, Before  half-an-hour's time all was done, and out they flew again. And then  Cinderella took the dishes to her mother, rejoicing to think that she  should now go to the ball. But her mother said, \"It is all of no use,  you cannot go, you have no clothes, and cannot dance, and you would  only put us to shame:\" and off she went with her two daughters to the  feast.    Now when all were gone, and nobody left at home, Cinderella went  sorrowfully and sat down under the hazel-tree, and cried out--          \"Shake, shake, hazel tree,        Gold and silver over me!\"    Then her friend the bird flew out of the tree and brought a gold and  silver dress for her, and slippers of spangled silk; and she put them  on, and followed her sisters to the feast. But they did not know her,  and thought it must be some strange princess, she looked so fine  and beautiful in her rich clothes; and they never once thought of  Cinderella, but took for granted that she was safe at home in the  dirt.    [Illustration: _Painted by Jennie Harbour_  CINDERELLA]      [Illustration]    The king's son soon came up to her, and took her by the hand and  danced with her and no one else; and he never left her hand; but when  any one else came to ask her to dance, he said, \"This lady is dancing  with me.\" Thus they danced till a late hour of the night, and then she  wanted to go home: and the king's son said, \"I shall go and take care  of you to your home;\" for he wanted to see where the beautiful maid  lived. But she slipped away from him unawares, and ran off towards  home, and the prince followed her; but she jumped up into the  pigeon-house and shut the door. Then he waited till her father came  home, and told him that the unknown maiden who had been at the feast  had hidden herself in the pigeon-house. But when they had broken open  the door they found no one within; and as they came back into the  house, Cinderella lay as she always did, in her dirty frock by the  ashes, and her dim little lamp burnt in the chimney; for she had  run as quickly as she could through the pigeon-house and on to the  hazel-tree, and had there taken off her beautiful clothes, and laid  them beneath the tree, that the bird might carry them away, and had  seated herself amid the ashes again in her little old frock.    The next day, when the feast was again held, and her father, mother,  and sisters were gone, Cinderella went to the hazel tree, and said--          \"Shake, shake, hazel tree,        Gold and silver over me!\"    And the bird came and brought a still finer dress than the one she had  worn the day before. And when she came in it to the ball, every one  wondered at her beauty; but the king's son, who was waiting for her,  took her by the hand, and danced with her; and when any one asked  her to dance, he said as before, \"This lady is dancing with me.\" When  night came she wanted to go home; and the king's son followed her as  before, that he might see into what house she went; but she sprang  away from him, all at once, into the garden behind her father's house.  In this garden stood a fine large pear tree full of ripe fruit; and  Cinderella, not knowing where to hide herself, jumped up into it  without being seen. Then the king's son could not find out where she  was gone, but waited till her father came home, and said to him, \"The  unknown lady who danced with me has slipped away, and I think she must  have sprung into the pear tree.\" The father thought to himself, \"Can  it be Cinderella?\" So he ordered an axe to be brought; and they cut  down the tree, but found no one upon it. And when they came back into  the kitchen, there lay Cinderella in the ashes as usual; for she had  slipped down on the other side of the tree, and carried her beautiful  clothes back to the bird at the hazel tree, and then put on her little  old frock.    The third day, when her father and mother and sisters were gone she  went again into the garden, and said---          \"Shake, shake, hazel tree,        Gold and silver over me!\"    Then her kind friend the bird brought a dress still finer than the  former ones, and slippers which were all of gold; so that when she  came to the feast no one knew what to say for wonder at her beauty;  and the king's son danced with her alone; and when any one else asked  her to dance he said, \"This lady is my partner.\" Now when night came  she wanted to go home; and the king's son would go with her, and said  to himself, \"I will not lose her this time;\" but, however, she managed  to slip away from him, though in such a hurry that she dropped her  left golden slipper upon the stairs.    [Illustration: \"SHE SPRANG AWAY FROM HIM, ALL AT ONCE, INTO THE GARDEN  BEHIND HER FATHER'S HOUSE.\"]    So the prince took the shoe, and went the next day to the king his  father, and said, \"I will take for my wife the lady that this golden  shoe fits.\" Then both the sisters were overjoyed to hear this; for  they had beautiful feet, and had no doubt that they could wear the  golden slipper. The eldest went first into the room where the slipper  was, and wanted to try it on, and the mother stood by. But her great  toe could not go into it, and the shoe was altogether much too small  for her. Then the mother gave her a knife, and said, \"Never mind, cut  it off; when you are queen you will not care about toes, you will  not want to go on foot.\" So the silly girl cut her great toe off, and  squeezed the shoe on, and went to the king's son. Then he took her for  his bride, and set her beside him on his horse and rode away with  her. But on their way home they had to pass by the hazel tree that  Cinderella had planted and there sat a little dove on the branch  singing---          \"Back again! back again! look to the shoe!        The shoe is too small, and not made for you!        Prince! prince! look again for thy bride,        For she's not the true one that sits by thy side.\"    Then the prince got down and looked at her foot, and saw by the blood  that streamed from it what a trick she had played him. So he turned  his horse round and brought the false bride back to her home, and  said, \"This is not the right bride; let the other sister try and put  on the slipper.\" Then she went into the room and got her foot into the  shoe, all but the heel, which was too large. But her mother squeezed  it in till the blood came, and took her to the king's son; and he set  her as his bride beside him on his horse, and rode away with her. But  when they came to the hazel tree the little dove sat there still, and  sang--          \"Back again! back again! look to the shoe!        The shoe is too small, and not made for you!        Prince! prince! look again for thy bride,        For she's not the true one that sits by thy side.\"    [Illustration]    Then he looked down and saw that the blood streamed so from the shoe  that her white stockings were quite red. So he turned his horse and  brought her back again also. \"This is not the true bride,\" said he to  the father; \"have you no other daughters?\" \"No,\" said he; \"there is  only a little dirty Cinderella here, the child of my first wife; I am  sure she cannot be the bride.\" However, the prince told him to send  her. But the mother said, \"No, no, she is much too dirty, she will not  dare to show herself;\" still the prince would have her come. And she  first washed her face and hands, and then went in and curtsied to him,  and he handed to her the golden slipper.    Then she took her clumsy shoe off her left foot and put on the golden  slipper; and it fitted her as if it had been made for her. And when  the Prince drew near and looked at her face he knew her, and said,  \"This is the right bride.\"    But the mother and both the sisters were frightened and turned pale  with anger as he took Cinderella on his horse, and rode away with her.  And when they came to the hazel tree, the white dove sang--          \"Home! home! look at the shoe!        Princess! the shoe was made for you!        Prince! prince! take home thy bride.        For she is the true one that sits by thy side!\"    And when the dove had done its song, it came flying and perched upon  her shoulder, and so went home with her.          PRINCESS GOLDENHAIR      There was once a King's daughter who was the most beautiful thing in  the world, and as her hair was fair and reached to her feet she was  called the Princess Goldenhair.
