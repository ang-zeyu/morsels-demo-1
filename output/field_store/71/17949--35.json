By Act 24, of 1843, all such professional gang-robbers are declared  liable to a sentence, on conviction, of imprisonment for life; and  everywhere else a sentence of imprisonment for life has been passed  upon all persons convicted of being gang-robbers by profession. This  is indispensably necessary for the entire suppression of the system  which Government has in view. Do you not think that in your Courts  the final sentence might be left to the European functionaries, and  the verdict only left to the Punchaets? The greater part of those  already convicted in these Courts will have to be released soon, and  all who are so will certainly return to their trade; and the system  will continue in spite of all our efforts to put it down. I have just  been at Jubulpore, and the bearing of the Bagree decoits, sent from  Ajmeer by Buch, is quite different from that of those who have had a  sentence of imprisonment for life passed against them in other  quarters, and is very injurious to them, for they get so bad a name  that no one will venture to give them service of any kind. Do, I pray  you, think of a remedy for the future. The only one that strikes me  is that above suggested, of leaving the final sentence to the  European officers.    I need not say that I was delighted at your getting the great Douger  Sing by the means you had yourself proposed for the pursuit--sending  an officer with authority to disregard boundaries.

My Lord,    I had the gratification to receive your Lordship's letter of the 7th  of January last, at Nursingpore, in the valley of the Nerbudda, where  I commenced my Civil career more than a quarter of a century before,  and where, of all places, I should have wished to receive so gracious  a testimonial from such high authority. I should have earlier  expressed by grateful acknowledgments, and prepared the narrative so  frequently called for, but I was then engaged in preparing a Report  on Gang-robbery in India, and wished first to make a little more  progress, that I might be able to speak more confidently of its  ultimate completion and submission to Government. In a less perfect  form this Report was, at the earnest recommendation of the then  Lieut.-Governor N.W.P., the Honourable T. Robertson, and with the  sanction of the Governor-General Lord Auckland, sent to the  Government press so long back as 1842, but his Lordship appeared to  me to think that the printing had better be deferred till more  progress had been made in the work of putting down the odious system  of crime which the Report exposed, and I withdrew it from the press  with little hope of ever again having any leisure to devote to it, or  finding any other person able and willing to undertake its  completion.    During the last rains, however, I began again to arrange the confused  mass of papers which I found lying in a box; but in October I was  interrupted by a severe attack of fever, and unable to do anything  but the current duties of my office till I commenced my tour through  the Saugor territories, in November. I have since nearly completed  the work, and hope to be able to submit it to Government before the  end of this month in a form worthy of its acceptation.    I am afraid that the narrative of my humble services will be found  much longer than it ought to be, but I have written it hastily that  it might go by this mail, and it is the first attempt I have ever  thought of making at such a narrative, for I have gone on quietly  \"through evil and through good report,\" doing, to the best of my  ability, the duties which it has pleased the Government of India,  from time to time, to confide to me, in the manner which appeared to  me most conformable to its wishes and its honour, satisfied and  grateful for the trust and confidence which enabled me to do so much  good for the people, and to secure so much of their attachment and  gratitude to their rulers.    Permit me to subscribe myself, with great respect, Your Lordship's  faithful and obedient humble servant,                (Signed)          W. H. SLEEMAN.    To Lieut.-General the Right Hon.  Henry Viscount Hardinge,       &c. &c. &c.             _________________________                                             Jhansee, 4th March, 1848.  Dear Sir,    Lord Hardinge, in a letter dated the 7th of January last, requested  me to make out a narrative of my humble services in India, and to  send it under cover to you, as he expected to embark on the 15th,  before he could receive it in Calcutta. I take the liberty to send my  reply with the narrative, open, and to request that you will do me  the favour to have them sealed and forwarded to his Lordship.             Believe me, dear Sir,                Yours very faithfully,                (Signed)        W. H. SLEEMAN.    To J. Cosmo Melvill,  Secretary to the East India Company,  India House, London.             _________________________                                              Jhansee, 28th March, 1848.      My Dear Elliot,    The Court of Directors complain that decoit prisoners are not tried  as soon as they are caught, but they know little of the difficulties  that the officers under me find in getting them tried, for political  officers have, in truth, had little encouragement to undertake such  duties, and it is only a few choice spirits that have entered upon  the duty _con amore_. General Nott prided, himself upon doing nothing  whatever while he was at Lucknow; General Pollock did all he could,  but it was not much; and Colonel Richmond does nothing. There the  Buduk decoits, Thugs, and poisoners, remain without sentences, and  will do so till Richmond goes, unless you give him a fillip. If you  tell him to apply for an assistant to aid him in the conduct of the  trials, and tell him to nominate his own, he may go to work, and I  earnestly pray you to do something, or the Oude Turae will become  what it had for ages been before we cleaned it out. Davidson was  prevented from doing anything by technical difficulties, so that out  of _four Residents we have not got four days' work_.    You will soon get my Report, and it will be worth having, and the  last I shall make on crime in India.    If Hercules had not had better instruments he could not so easily  have cleared out his stable; but he had no \"Honourable Court\" to find  fault with his mode of doing the thing, I conclude. The fact is,  however, that our prisoners are pretty well tried before they get  into quod. Mr. Bird will be delighted at the manner in which he is  introduced in my first chapter, and many another good officer well  pleased.                       Yours sincerely,                           (Signed)       W. H. SLEEMAN.    To H. M. Elliot, Esq.,  Secretary to the Government of India,  Calcutta.                _________________________________                                          Jhansee, 29th March, 1848.    My Dear Maddock,    I hope you will not disapprove of the resolution to which I have come  of resigning the charge of the Saugor territories, now that  tranquillity has been restored,--the best possible feelings among the  people prevail, and the object you had in view in recommending Lord  Ellenborough to confide that charge to me has been effected,--or of  the manner in which I have tendered my resignation. Were I longer to  retain the charge, I should be subjected to humiliations which the  exigencies of the public service do not require that I should at this  time of life submit to, and I shall have enough of labour and anxiety  in the charge that will still remain to me. If an opening for Sir R.  Shakespear could be found, his salary might be saved by my residence  being transferred to Gwalior. If either Hamilton or I were to be  removed to some other post, it would be well to reduce Gwalior and  Indore to political agencies, under the supervision of an agent, as  in Rajpootana, with Bundelcund added to his charge. The latter of  these two measures has, you know, been under consideration, and was,  I think, proposed by Sutherland when you were at Gwalior with Lord  Auckland. Had the Lieutenant-Governor known more of the Saugor  territories when he wrote the paper on which Government is now  acting, he would not, I think, have described the state of things as  he has done, or urged the introduction of the system which must end  in minutely subdividing all leases, and in having all questions  regarding land tenures removed into the civil Courts, as in the  provinces. It is the old thing, \"nothing like leather.\" I shall not  weary you by anything more on this subject. I hope a good man will be  selected for the charge. The selection of Mr. M. Smith as successor  to Mr. Brown was a good one. My letter will go off to-day, and be, I  trust, well received. I am grieved that Clerk has been obliged to  quit his post; he has been throughout his career an ornament to your  service, but his friends seem all along to have apprehended that he  could not long stand the climate of Bombay. I am anxious to learn how  long you are to remain in Council.                          Yours very sincerely,                        (Signed)       W. H. SLEEMAN.    To the Hon. Sir T. H. Maddock,           &c. &c. &c.                   _______________________________                                              Jhansee, 2nd April, 1848.    My Dear Elliot,    Till I this morning got the public letter, which will go off to-day,  I never heard one word about Shakespear's intention or wish to go to  the hills, and only thirteen days remain. The orders of Government as  to his _locum tenens_ cannot reach me by the 15th, when he is to  leave, and I shall have to put in some one to take charge,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17009"],[0,"Studies in Occultism; A Series of Reprints from the Writings of H. P. Blavatsky (#4)"],[1,"of the preliminary  aspirations of the candidates, often finds strange ideas quietly taking  possession of their minds. There are those whose reasoning powers have  been so distorted by foreign influences that they imagine that animal  passions can be so sublimated and elevated that their fury, force, and  fire can, so to speak, be turned inwards; that they can be stored and  shut up in one's breast, until their energy is, not expanded, but  turned toward higher and more holy purposes; namely, _until their  collective and unexpanded strength enables their possessor to enter the  true Sanctuary of the Soul_ and stand therein in the presence of the  _Master_--the Higher Self! For this purpose they will not  struggle with their passions nor slay them. They will simply, by a  strong effort of will put down the fierce flames and keep them at bay  within their natures, allowing the fire to smolder under a thin layer of  ashes. They submit joyfully to the torture of the Spartan boy who  allowed the fox to devour his entrails rather than part with it. Oh,  poor, blind visionaries!    As well hope that a band of drunken chimney-sweeps, hot and greasy from  their work, may be shut up in a Sanctuary hung with pure white linen,  and that instead of soiling and turning it by their presence into a heap  of dirty shreds, they will become masters in and of the sacred recess,  and finally emerge from it as immaculate as that recess. Why not imagine  that a dozen of skunks imprisoned in the pure atmosphere of a _Dgon-pa_  (a monastery) can issue out of it impregnated with all the perfumes of  the incenses used?... Strange aberration of the human mind. Can it be  so? Let us argue.    The \"Master\" in the Sanctuary of our souls is \"the Higher Self\"--the  divine spirit whose consciousness is based upon and derived solely (at  any rate during the mortal life of the man in whom it is captive) from  the Mind, which we have agreed to call the _Human Soul_ (the \"Spiritual  Soul\" being the vehicle of the Spirit). In its turn the former (the  _personal_ or human soul) is a compound in its highest form, of  spiritual aspirations, volitions and divine love; and in its lower  aspect, of animal desires and terrestrial passions imparted to it by its  associations with its vehicle, the seat of all these. It thus stands as  a link and a medium between the animal nature of man which its higher  reason seeks to subdue, and his divine spiritual nature to which it  gravitates, whenever it has the upper hand in its struggle with the  _inner animal_. The latter is the instinctual \"animal Soul\" and is the  hotbed of those passions, which, as just shown, are lulled instead of  being killed, and locked up in their breasts by some imprudent  enthusiasts. Do they still hope to turn thereby the muddy stream of the  animal sewer into the crystalline waters of life? And where, on what  neutral ground can they be imprisoned so as not to affect man? The  fierce passions of love and lust are still alive and they are allowed to  still remain in the place of their birth--_that same animal soul_; for  both the higher and the lower portions of the \"Human Soul\" or Mind  reject such inmates, though they cannot avoid being tainted with them as  neighbors. The \"Higher Self\" or Spirit is as unable to assimilate such  feelings as water to get mixed with oil or unclean liquid tallow. It is  thus the mind alone--the sole link and medium between the man of earth  and the Higher Self--that is the only sufferer, and which is in the  incessant danger of being dragged down by those passions that may be  reawakened at any moment, and perish in the abyss of matter. And how  can it ever attune itself to the divine harmony of the highest  Principle, when that harmony is destroyed by the mere presence, within  the Sanctuary in preparation, of such animal passions? How can harmony  prevail and conquer, when the soul is stained and distracted with the  turmoil of passions and the terrestrial desires of the bodily senses, or  even of the \"Astral man\"?    For this \"Astral\"--the shadowy \"double\" (in the animal as in man)--is  not the companion of the _divine Ego_ but of the _earthly body_. It is  the link between the personal Self, the lower consciousness of  _Manas_ and the Body, and is the vehicle of _transitory_, _not  of immortal life_. Like the shadow projected by man, it follows his  movements and impulses slavishly and mechanically, and leans therefore  to matter without ever ascending to Spirit. It is only when the power of  the passions is dead altogether, and when they have been crushed and  annihilated in the retort of an unflinching will; when not only all the  lusts and longings of the flesh are dead, but also the recognition of  the personal Self is killed out and the \"astral\" has been reduced in  consequence to a cipher, that the Union with the \"Higher Self\" can take  place. Then when the \"astral\" reflects only the conquered man, the still  living, but no more the longing, selfish personality, then the brilliant  _Augoeides_, the divine Self, can vibrate in conscious harmony  with both the poles of the human Entity--the man of matter purified, and  the ever pure Spiritual Soul--and stand in the presence of the  Master Self, the Christos of the mystic Gnostics, blended,  merged into, and one with IT for ever.[D]    How then can it be thought possible for a man to enter the \"strait gate\"  of occultism when his daily and hourly thoughts are bound up with  worldly things, desires of possession and power, with lust, ambition  and duties, which, however honorable, are still of the earth earthy?  Even the love for wife and family--the purest as the most unselfish of  human affections--is a barrier to _real_ occultism. For whether we take  as an example the holy love of a mother for her child, or that of a  husband for his wife, even in these feelings, when analysed to the very  bottom, and thoroughly sifted, there is still _selfishness_ in the  first, and an _egoisme a deux_ in the second instance. What mother would  not sacrifice without a moment's hesitation hundreds and thousands of  lives for that of the child of her heart? and what lover or true husband  would not break the happiness of every other man and woman around him to  satisfy the desire of one whom he loves? This is but natural, we shall  be told. Quite so; in the light of the code of human affections; less  so, in that of divine universal love. For, while the heart is full of  thoughts for a little group of _selves_, near and dear to us, how shall  the rest of mankind fare in our souls? What percentage of love and care  will there remain to bestow on the \"great orphan\"? And how shall the  \"still small voice\" make itself heard in a soul entirely occupied with  its own privileged tenants? What room is there left for the needs of  Humanity _en bloc_ to impress themselves upon, or even receive a speedy  response? And yet, he who would profit by the wisdom of the universal  mind, has to reach it through _the whole of Humanity_ without  distinction of race, complexion, religion or social status. It is  _altruism_, not _ego-ism_ even in its most legal and noble conception,  that can lead the unit to merge its little Self in the Universal Selves.  It is to _these_ needs and to this work that the true disciple of true  Occultism has to devote himself, if he would obtain _theo_-sophy, divine  Wisdom and Knowledge.    The aspirant has to choose absolutely between the life of the world and  the life of Occultism. It is useless and vain to endeavor to unite the  two, for no one can serve two masters and satisfy both. No one can serve  his body and the higher Soul, and do his family duty and his universal  duty, without depriving either one or the other of its rights; for he  will either lend his ear to the \"still small voice\" and fail to hear the  cries of his little ones, or, he will listen but to the wants of the  latter and remain deaf to the voice of Humanity. It would be a  ceaseless, a maddening struggle for almost any married man, who would  pursue true practical Occultism, instead of its _theoretical_  philosophy. For he would find himself ever hesitating between the voice  of the impersonal divine love of Humanity, and that of the personal,  terrestrial love. And this could only lead him to fail in one or the  other, or perhaps in both his duties. Worse than this; for, _whoever  indulges, after having pledged himself to_ OCCULTISM, _in the  gratification of a terrestrial love or lust_, must feel an almost  immediate result; that of being irresistibly dragged from the impersonal  divine state down to the lower plane of matter. Sensual, or even mental  self-gratification, involves the immediate loss of the powers of  spiritual discernment; the voice of the MASTER can no longer  be distinguished from that of one's passions or _even that of a Dugpa_;  the right from wrong; sound morality from mere casuistry. The Dead Sea  fruit assumes the most glorious mystic appearance, only to turn to ashes  on the lips, and to gall in the heart, resulting in:--        Depth ever deepening, darkness darkening still;      Folly for wisdom, guilt for innocence;      Anguish for rapture, and for hope despair.    And once being mistaken and having acted on their mistakes, most men  shrink from realizing their error, and thus descend deeper and deeper  into the mire. And, although it is the intention that decides primarily  whether _white_ or _black_ magic is exercised, yet the results even of  involuntary, unconscious sorcery cannot fail to be productive of bad  Karma. Enough has been said to show that _sorcery is any kind of evil  influence exercised upon other persons, who suffer, or make other  persons suffer, in consequence_. Karma is a heavy stone splashed in the  quiet waters of Life; and it must produce ever widening circles of  ripples, carried wider and wider, almost _ad infinitum_. Such causes  produced have to call forth"]]]
