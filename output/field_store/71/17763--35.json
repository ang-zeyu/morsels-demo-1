It is useless to  describe the many antiquated methods in vogue in smaller factories,  and it can truthfully be said that nearly all of them are out of date.  It appears to be the fact of almost all inventions that when reduced  to practical use, the arrangements, apparatus, and working methods  employed are generally of the most complicated nature, and time and  experience only will simplify them. This has been also the case with  the methods in the roofing paper industry, which are at present  gradually being reduced to a practical basis. The method gradually  adopted has been described in the preceding. The pan is of a certain  length, whereby it becomes possible to saturate the paper by slowly  drawing it through the heated tar. This is the chief feature. The work  is much simplified thereby and the workmen need not dip their hands  into the tar or soil them with it. The work of impregnating has become  much cleaner and easier, while at the same time the tar can be heated  to a much higher temperature. The pan is generally filled with  distilled coal tar, and the heating is regulated in such a manner that  the temperature of the impregnating mass is raised far beyond 212 deg.  Fahrenheit. This accelerates the penetration, which takes place more  quickly as the degree of heat is raised, which may be almost up to the  boiling point of the tar, as at this degree the paper is not destroyed  by the heat. In order to prevent the evaporation of the volatile  ingredients of the tar, the pan is covered with a sheet iron cover,  with a slot at the place where the paper enters into the impregnating  mass and another at the place where it issues. The tar is always kept  at the same level, by occasional additions.    The roll of paper is mounted upon a shaft at the back end of the pan,  and by suitable arrangement of guide rollers it unwinds slowly, passes  into the tar in which it is kept submerged. The guide rollers can be  raised so that when a new roller is set up they can be raised out of  the tar. The end of the paper is then slipped underneath them above  the surface of the tar, when having passed through the squeezing  rollers, it is fastened to the beaming roller, and the guide rollers  are submerged again. A workman slowly turns the crank of the beaming  roller.    This motion draws the paper slowly through the fluid, the roll at the  back end unwinding. The speed with which the squeezing rollers are  turned is regulated in such a manner that the paper remains  sufficiently long underneath the fluid to be thoroughly impregnated  with it. The workmen quickly learn by experience how fast to turn the  crank. The hotter the tar, the more rapid the saturation; the high  degree of heat expels the air and evaporates the hygroscopic fluid in  the pores of the paper. The strong heating of the tar causes another  advantage connected with this method. The surface of the paper as it  issues from the squeezing rollers is still very hot, and a part of the  volatile oils evaporate very quickly at this high temperature. The  surface is thereby at once dried to a certain degree and at the same  time receives a handsome luster, as if it had been coated with a black  lacquer. The paper is sanded in a very simple manner without the use  of mechanical apparatus; as it is being wrapped into a coil, it passes  with its lower surface over a layer of sand, while the workman who  tends to rolling up strews the inside with sand. The lower surface is  coated very equally. Care only being necessary that the sand lies  smooth and even at all times. When the workman has rolled up ten or  fifteen yards, he cuts it across with a knife and straightedge, so  that the paper is cut at right angles with its sides.    There are three different sorts of roofing paper, according to the  impregnating fluid used in its manufacture. The ordinary tar paper is  that saturated with clear cold tar. This contains the greatest amount  of fluid ingredients and is very raggy in a fresh condition. It is  easy to see that the volatile hydrocarbons evaporate in a short time,  and when expelled, the paper becomes stiffer and apparently drier.  This drying, or the volatilization of the hydrocarbons, causes pores  between the fibers of the paper. These pores are highly injurious to  it, as they facilitate a process of decomposition which will ruin it  in a short time.    Roofing paper can be called good only when it is essentially made from  woolen rags, and contains either very few or no earthy additions. It  is beyond doubt that the durability of a roofing paper increases with  the quality of wool fiber it contains--vegetable fibers and earthy  additions cause a direct injury. Reprehensible altogether is any  combination with lime, either in form of a carbonate or sulphate,  because the lime enters into chemical combination with the  decomposition products of the tar.    The general nature of gravel is too well known to require description.  The grains of quartz sand are either sharp cornered or else rounded  pieces of stone of quartz, occasionally mixed with grains of other  amorphous pieces of silica--such as horn stone, silicious slate,  carnelian, etc.; again, with lustrous pieces of mica, or red and white  pieces of feldspar. The gravel used for a tar paper roof must be of a  special nature and be prepared for the purpose. The size of its grains  must not exceed a certain standard--say, the size of a pea. When found  in the gravel bank, it is frequently mixed with clay, etc., and it  cannot be used in this condition for a roof, but must be washed. The  utensils necessary for this purpose are of so simple and suggestive a  nature that they need not be described. Slag is being successfully  used in place of the gravel. It is easily reduced to suitable size, by  letting the red hot mass, as it runs from the furnace, run into a  vessel with water. The sudden chilling of the slag causes it to burst  into fragments of a sharp cornered structure. It is next passed  through a sieve, and the suitably sized gravel makes an excellent  material, as it gives a clean appearance to the roof.    The thinking mind can easily go one step further and imagine that,  since the tar contains a number of volatile hydrocarbons, it might be  made more adaptable for impregnation by paper by distilling it, as by  this process the fluid would lose its tendency to evaporate and the  percentage of resinous substances increase. Singular to say, there was  a prejudice against the employment of distilled tar, entertained by  builders and people who had no knowledge of chemistry. Increasing  intelligence and altered business circumstances, however, brought  about the almost universal employment of distilled tar, and every  large factory uses it at present. The roofing paper prepared with  distilled tar is perhaps most suitably called asphaltum paper, as this  has been used in its manufacture. It possesses properties superior to  the ordinary tar paper, one of which is that immediately after its  manufacture, as soon as cold, it is dry and ready for shipment; nor  does it require to be kept in store for a length of time, and it has  also a good, firm body, being as flexible and tough as leather. It is  very durable upon the roof, and remains flexible for a long time. It  is true that asphaltum papers will always in a fresh state contain a  small percentage of volatile ingredients, which after a while make it  hard and friable upon the roof; but, by reason of its greater  percentage of resinous components, it will always preserve a superior  degree of durability and become far less porous. One hundred parts by  weight absorb 140 or 150 parts by weight of coal tar. A factory which  distilled a good standard tar for roofing paper recovered, besides  benzole and naphtha, also about ten per cent. of creosote oil, used  for one hundred parts raw paper, 176.4 partially distilled tar.  Experiments on a larger as well as a smaller scale reduced this  quantity to an average of 141.5 parts for one hundred parts raw paper.  The weight of sanded paper is very variable, as it depends altogether  upon the size of the sand grains. It may be stated generally that the  weight of the sand is as large as that of the tarred paper.    The kinds of roofing paper saturated with other additions besides coal  tar form a separate class, in order to neutralize the defects inherent  in coal tar. These additions were originally for the purpose of  thickening the paper and making it stiffer and drier. The most  ordinary and cheapest thickener was the coal pitch. Although the  resinous substances are increased thereby, still the light tar oils  remain to evaporate, and the paper prepared with such a substance  readily becomes hard and brittle. A better addition is the natural  asphaltum, because it resists better the destroying influence of the  decomposition process, and also, to a certain degree, protects the  coal tar in which it is dissolved. The addition of natural asphaltum  doubtless caused the name of \"asphaltum roofing paper.\" Resin,  sulphur, wood tar and other substances were also used as additions;  each manufacturer kept his method secret, however, and simply pointed  out by high sounding title in what manner his paper was composed. In  most cases, however, this appellation was applied to the ordinary tar  paper; the impregnating substance was mixed only with coal pitch, or  else a roofing paper saturated with distilled tar. The costly  additions, by the use of which a high grade of roofing paper can  doubtless be produced, largely increased its price, and on account of  the constant fall of prices of the article, its use became rather one  of those things \"more honored in the breach than in the observance,\"  and was dispensed with whenever practicable. The crude paper is the  foundation of the roofing paper. The qualities of a good,  unadulterated paper have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13642"],[0,"The Journal of Negro History, Volume 1, January 1916 (#4)"],[1,"further disorder.[42]    It is impossible to say exactly how many were killed and wounded on  either side. It is probable that several were killed and twenty or  thirty variously wounded, though but few dangerously. Forty of the mob  were arrested and imprisoned. Exactly what was done with all of them is  not yet known. It seems that few, if any of them, however, were severely  punished. The Negroes who had been committed for safe keeping were  thereafter disposed of in various ways. Some were discharged on  certificates of nativity, others gave bond for their support and good  behavior, a few were dismissed as non-residents, a number of them were  discharged by a justice of the Court of Common Pleas, and the rest were  held indefinitely.[43]    This upheaval had two important results. The enemies of the Negroes were  convinced that there were sufficient law-abiding citizens to secure to  the refugees protection from mob violence; and because of these riots  their sympathizers became more attached to the objects of their  philanthropy. Abolitionists, Free Soilers and Whigs fearlessly attacked  the laws which kept the Negroes under legal and economic disabilities.  Petitions praying that these measures be repealed were sent to the  legislature. The proslavery element of the State, however, was equally  militant. The legislators, therefore, had to consider such questions as  extradition and immigration, State aid and colonization, the employment  of colored men in the militia service, the extension of the elective  franchise, and the admission of colored children to the public  schools.[44] Most of these \"Black Laws\" remained until after the war,  but in 1848 they were so modified as to give the Negroes legal standing  in courts and to provide for their children such education as a school  tax on the property of colored persons would allow[45] and further  changed in 1849[46] so as to make the provision for education more  effective.    The question of repealing the other oppressive laws came up in the  Convention of 1850. It seemed that the cause of the Negroes had made  much progress in that a larger number had begun to speak for them. But  practically all of the members of the convention who stood for the  Negroes were from the Western Reserve. After much heated discussion the  colored people were by a large majority of votes still left under the  disabilities of being disqualified to sit on juries, unable to obtain a  legal residence so as to enter a charitable institution supported by the  State, and denied admission to public schools established for white  children.[47]    The greatest problem of the Negroes, however, was one of education.  There were more persons interested in furnishing them facilities of  education than in repealing the prohibitive measures, feeling that the  other matters would adjust themselves after giving them adequate  training. But it required some time and effort yet before much could be  effected in Cincinnati because of the sympathizers with the South. The  mere passing of the law of 1849 did not prove to be altogether a  victory. Complying with the provisions of this act the Negroes elected  trustees, organized a system, and employed teachers, relying on the  money allotted them by the law on the basis of a per capita division of  the school fund received by the board of education. So great was the  prejudice of people of the city that the school officials refused to  turn over the required funds on the grounds that the colored trustees  were not electors and, therefore, could not be office-holders, qualified  to receive and disburse funds. Under the leadership of John I. Gaines,  therefore, the trustees called an indignation meeting and raised  sufficient money to employ Flamen Ball, an attorney, to secure a writ of  mandamus. The case was contested by the city officials, even in the  Supreme Court, which decided against the officious whites.[48]    This decision did not solve the whole problem in Cincinnati. The amount  raised was small and even had it been adequate to employ teachers, they  were handicapped by another decision that no portion of it could be used  for building schoolhouses. After a short period of accomplishing  practically nothing the law was amended in 1853[49] so as to transfer  the control of such schools to the managers of the white system. This  was taken as a reflection on the blacks of the city and tended to make  them refuse to cooperate with the white board. On account of the failure  of this body to act effectively prior to 1856, the people of color were  again given power to elect their own trustees.[50]    During this contest certain Negroes of Cincinnati were endeavoring to  make good their claim to equal rights in the public schools. Acting upon  this contention a colored man sent his son to a public school which, on  account of his presence, became a center of unusual excitement. Isabella  Newhall, the teacher, to whom he went, immediately complained to the  board of education, requesting that he be expelled because of his color.  After \"due deliberation\" the board of education decided by a vote of 15  to 10 that the colored pupil would have to withdraw. Thereupon two  members of that body, residing in the district of the timorous teacher,  resigned.[51]    Many Negroes belonging to the mulatto class, however, were more  successful in getting into the white schools. In 1849 certain parents  complained that children of color were being admitted to the public  schools, and in fact there were in one of them two daughters of a white  father and a mulatto mother. On complaining about this to the principal  of the school in question, the indignant patrons were asked to point out  the undesirable pupils. \"They could not; for,\" says Sir Charles Lyell,  \"the two girls were not only among the best pupils, but better looking  and less dark than many of the other pupils.\"[52]    Thereafter, however, much progress in the education of the colored  people among themselves was noted. By 1844 they had six schools of their  own and before the war two well-supported public schools.[53] Among  their teachers were such useful persons as Mrs. M. J. Corbin, Miss Lucy  Blackburn, Miss Anne Ryall, Miss Virginia C. Tilley, Miss Martha E.  Anderson, William H. Parham, William R. Casey, John G. Mitchell and  Peter H. Clark.[54] The pupils were showing their appreciation by  regular attendance, excellent deportment, and progress in the  acquisition of knowledge. Speaking of these Negroes in 1855, John P.  Foote said that they shared with the white citizens that respect for  education and the diffusion of knowledge, which has been one of their  \"characteristics,\" and that they had, therefore, been more generally  intelligent than free persons of color not only in other parts of this  country but in all other parts of the world.[55] It was in appreciation  of the worth of this class to the community that in 1844[56] Nicholas  Longworth helped them to establish an orphan asylum and in 1858 built  for them a comfortable school building, leasing it with a privilege of  purchasing it within four years.[57] They met these requirements within  the stipulated time and in 1859 secured through other agencies the  construction of another building in the western portion of the city.    The most successful of these schools, however, was the Gilmore High  School, a private institution founded by an English clergyman. This  institution offered instruction in the fundamentals and in some  vocational studies. It was supported liberally by the benevolent element  of the white people and patronized and appreciated by the Negroes as the  first and only institution offering them the opportunity for thorough  training. It became popular throughout the country, attracting Negroes  from as far South as New Orleans[58] Rich Southern planters found it  convenient to have their mulatto children educated in this high  school.[59]    The work of these schools was substantially supplemented by that of the  colored churches. They directed their attention not only to moral and  religious welfare of the colored people but also to their mental  development. Through their well-attended Sunday-schools these  institutions furnished many Negroes of all classes the facilities of  elementary education. Such opportunities were offered at the Baker  Street Baptist Church, the Third Street Baptist Church, the Colored  Christian Church, the New Street Methodist Church, and the African  Methodist Church. Among the preachers then promoting this cause were  John Warren, Rufus Conrad, Henry Simpson, and Wallace Shelton. Many of  the old citizens of Cincinnati often refer with pride to the valuable  services rendered by these leaders.    In things economic the Negroes were exceptionally prosperous after the  forties. Cincinnati had then become a noted pork-packing and  manufacturing center. The increasing canal and river traffic and finally  the rise of the railroad system tended to make it thrive more than ever.  Many colored men grew up with the city. A Negro had in the East End on  Calvert Street a large cooperage establishment which made barrels for  the packers. Knight and Bell were successful contractors noted for their  skill and integrity and employed by the best white people of the city.  Robert Harlan made considerable money buying and selling race horses.  Thompson Cooley had a successful pickling establishment. On Broadway  A. V. Thompson, a colored tailor, conducted a thriving business. J.  Pressley and Thomas Ball were the well-known photographers of the city,  established in a handsomely furnished modern gallery which was  patronized by some of the wealthiest people. Samuel T. Wilcox, who owed  his success to his position as a steward on an Ohio River line,  thereafter went into the grocery business and built up such a large  trade among the aristocratic families that he accumulated $59,000"]]]
