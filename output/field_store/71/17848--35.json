I am very sensible that nothing but the great power and unspeakable  mercies of the Lord could relieve my soul from the heavy burden it  laboured under at that time.--A few days after my master gave me  Baxter's _Call to the unconverted_. This was no relief to me neither; on  the contrary it occasioned as much distress in me as the other had  before done, _as it_ invited all to come to _Christ_ and I found myself  so wicked and miserable that I could not come--This consideration threw  me into agonies that cannot be described; insomuch that I even attempted  to put an end to my life--I took one of the large case-knives, and went  into the stable with an intent to destroy myself; and as I endeavoured  with all my strength to force the knife into my side, it bent double. I  was instantly struck with horror at the thought of my own rashness, and  my conscience told me that had I succeeded in this attempt I should  probably have gone to hell.    I could find no relief, nor the least shadow of comfort; the extreme  distress of my mind so affected my health that I continued very ill for  three Days, and Nights; and would admit of no means to be taken for my  recovery, though my lady was very kind, and sent many things to me; but  I rejected every means of relief and wished to die--I would not go into  my own bed, but lay in the stable upon straw--I felt all the horrors of  a troubled conscience, so hard to be born, and saw all the vengeance of  God ready to overtake me--I was sensible that there was no way for me to  be saved unless I came to _Christ_, and I could not come to Him: I  thought that it was impossible He should receive such a sinner as me.    The last night that I continued in this place, in the midst of my  distress these words were brought home upon my mind, _\"Behold the Lamb  of God.\"_ I was something comforted at this, and began to grow easier  and wished for day that I might find these words in my bible--I rose  very early the following morning, and went to my school-master, Mr.  Vanosdore, and communicated the situation of my mind to him; he was  greatly rejoiced to find me enquiring the way to Zion, and blessed the  Lord who had worked so wonderfully for me a poor heathen.--I was more  familiar with this good gentleman than with my master, or any other  person; and found myself more at liberty to talk to him: he encouraged  me greatly, and prayed with me frequently, and I was always benefited by  his discourse.    About a quarter of a mile from my Master's house stood a large  remarkably fine Oak-tree, in the midst of a wood; I often used to be  employed there in cutting down trees, (a work I was very fond of) I  seldom failed going to this place every day; sometimes twice a day if I  could be spared. It was the highest pleasure I ever experienced to set  under this Oak; for there I used to pour out all my complaints to the  LORD: and when I had any particular grievance I used to go there, and  talk to the tree, and tell my sorrows, as if it had been to a friend.    Here I often lamented my own wicked heart, and undone state; and found  more comfort and consolation than I ever was sensible of  before.--Whenever I was treated with ridicule or contempt, I used to  come here and find peace. I now began to relish the book my Master gave  me, Baxter's _Call to the unconverted_, and took great delight in it. I  was always glad to be employ'd in cutting wood, 'twas a great part of my  business, and I follow'd it with delight, as I was then quite alone and  my heart lifted up to GOD, and I was enabled to pray continually; and  blessed for ever be his Holy Name, he faithfully answer'd my prayers. I  can never be thankful enough to Almighty GOD for the many comfortable  opportunities I experienced there.    It is possible the circumstance I am going to relate will not gain  credit with many; but this I know, that the joy and comfort it conveyed  to me, cannot be expressed and only conceived by those who have  experienced the like.    I was one day in a most delightful frame of mind; my heart so overflowed  with love and gratitude to the Author of all my comforts.--I was so  drawn out of myself, and so fill'd and awed by the Presence of God that  I saw (or thought I saw) light inexpressible dart down from heaven upon  me, and shone around me for the space of a minute.--I continued on my  knees, and joy unspeakable took possession of my soul.--The peace and  serenity which filled my mind after this was wonderful, and cannot be  told.--I would not have changed situations, or been any one but myself  for the whole world. I blest God for my poverty, that I had no worldly  riches or grandeur to draw my heart from Him. I wish'd at that time, if  it had been possible for me, to have continued on that spot for ever. I  felt an unwillingness in myself to have any thing more to do with the  world, or to mix with society again. I seemed to possess a full  assurance that my sins were forgiven me. I went home all my way  rejoicing, and this text of scripture came full upon my mind. _\"And I  will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away  from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts that  they shall not depart from me.\"_ The first opportunity that presented  itself, I went to my old school-master, and made known to him the happy  state of my soul who joined with me in praise to God for his mercy to me  the vilest of sinners.--I was now perfectly easy, and had hardly a wish  to make beyond what I possess'd, when my temporal comforts were all  blasted by the death of my dear and worthy Master Mr. Freelandhouse, who  was taken from this world rather suddenly: he had but a short illness,  and died of a fever. I held his hand in mine when he departed; he told  me he had given me my freedom. I was at liberty to go where I would.--He  added that he had always pray'd for me and hop'd I should be kept unto  the end. My master left me by his will ten pounds, and my freedom.    I found that if he had lived 'twas his intention to take me with him to  Holland, as he had often mention'd me to some friends of his there that  were desirous to see me; but I chose to continue with my Mistress who  was as good to me as if she had been my mother.    The loss of Mr. Freelandhouse distress'd me greatly, but I was render'd  still more unhappy by the clouded and perplex'd situation of my mind;  the great enemy of my soul being ready to torment me, would present my  own misery to me in such striking light, and distress me with doubts,  fears, and such a deep sense of my own unworthiness, that after all the  comfort and encouragement I had received, I was often tempted to believe  I should be a Cast-away at last.--The more I saw of the Beauty and Glory  of God, the more I was humbled under a sense of my own vileness. I  often repair'd to my old place of prayer; I seldom came away without  consolation. One day this Scripture was wonderfully apply'd to my mind,  _\"And ye are compleat in Him which is the Head of all principalities and  power.\"_--The Lord was pleas'd to comfort me by the application of many  gracious promises at times when I was ready to sink under my troubles.  _\"Wherefore He is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto  God by Him seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them._ Hebrews  x. ver. 14. _For by one offering He hath perfected for ever them that  are sanctified.\"_    My kind, indulgent Mistress liv'd but two years after my Master. Her  death was a great affliction to me. She left five sons, all gracious  young men, and Ministers of the Gospel.--I continued with them all, one  after another, till they died; they liv'd but four years after their  parents. When it pleased God to take them to Himself, I was left quite  destitute, without a friend in the world. But I who had so often  experienced the Goodness of GOD, trusted in Him to do what He pleased  with me.--In this helpless condition I went in the wood to prayer as  usual; and tho' the snow was a considerable height, I was not sensible  of cold, or any other inconveniency.--At times indeed when I saw the  world frowning round me, I was tempted to think that the LORD had  forsaken me. I found great relief from the contemplation of these words  in Isaiah xlix. v. 16. _\"Behold I have graven thee on the palms of my  hands; thy walls are continually before me.\"_ And very many comfortable  promises were sweetly applied to me. The lxxxix. Psalm and 34th verse,  _\"My covenant will I not break nor alter the thing that is gone out of  my lips.\"_ Hebrews, chap. xvi. v. 17, 18. Phillipians, chap. i. v. 6;  and several more.    As I had now lost all my dear and valued friends every place in the  world was alike to me. I had for a great while entertain'd a desire to  come to England.--I imagined that all the Inhabitants of this Island  were _Holy_; because all those that had visited my Master from thence  were good, (Mr. Whitefield was his particular friend) and the authors of  the books that had been given me were all English. But above all places  in the world I wish'd to see Kidderminster, for I could not but think  that on the spot where Mr. Baxter had liv'd, and preach'd, the people  must be all _Righteous_.    The situation of my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15043"],[0,"The Works of the Right Honourable Edmund Burke, Vol. 01 (of 12) (#4)"],[1,"  some inaccuracies in calculation, in reasoning, or in method, be found,  perhaps these will not be looked upon as faults by the admirers of Lord  Bolingbroke; who will, the editor is afraid, observe much more of his  lordship's character in such particulars of the following letter, than  they are likely to find of that rapid torrent of an impetuous and  overbearing eloquence, and the variety of rich imagery for which that  writer is justly admired.          A LETTER TO LORD ****.      Shall I venture to say, my lord, that in our late conversation, you were  inclined to the party which you adopted rather by the feelings of your  good nature, than by the conviction of your judgment? We laid open the  foundations of society; and you feared that the curiosity of this search  might endanger the ruin of the whole fabric. You would readily have  allowed my principle, but you dreaded the consequences; you thought,  that having once entered upon these reasonings, we might be carried  insensibly and irresistibly farther than at first we could either have  imagined or wished. But for my part, my lord, I then thought, and am  still of the same opinion, that error, and not truth of any kind, is  dangerous; that ill conclusions can only flow from false propositions;  and that, to know whether any proposition be true or false, it is a  preposterous method to examine it by its apparent consequences.    These were the reasons which induced me to go so far into that inquiry;  and they are the reasons which direct me in all my inquiries. I had  indeed often reflected on that subject before I could prevail on myself  to communicate my reflections to anybody. They were generally melancholy  enough; as those usually are which carry us beyond the mere surface of  things; and which would undoubtedly make the lives of all thinking men  extremely miserable, if the same philosophy which caused the grief, did  not at the same time administer the comfort.    On considering political societies, their origin, their constitution,  and their effects, I have sometimes been in a good deal more than doubt,  whether the Creator did ever really intend man for a state of happiness.  He has mixed in his cup a number of natural evils, (in spite of the  boasts of stoicism they are evils,) and every endeavor which the art and  policy of mankind has used from the beginning of the world to this day,  in order to alleviate or cure them, has only served to introduce new  mischiefs, or to aggravate and inflame the old. Besides this, the mind  of man itself is too active and restless a principle ever to settle on  the true point of quiet. It discovers every day some craving want in a  body, which really wants but little. It every day invents some new  artificial rule to guide that nature which, if left to itself, were the  best and surest guide. It finds out imaginary beings prescribing  imaginary laws; and then, it raises imaginary terrors to support a  belief in the beings, and an obedience to the laws.--Many things have  been said, and very well undoubtedly, on the subjection in which we  should preserve our bodies to the government of our understanding; but  enough has not been said upon the restraint which our bodily necessities  ought to lay on the extravagant sublimities and eccentric rovings of our  minds. The body, or as some love to call it, our inferior nature, is  wiser in its own plain way, and attends its own business more directly  than the mind with all its boasted subtlety.    In the state of nature, without question, mankind was subjected to many  and great inconveniences. Want of union, want of mutual assistance, want  of a common arbitrator to resort to in their differences. These were  evils which they could not but have felt pretty severely on many  occasions. The original children of the earth lived with their brethren  of the other kinds in much equality. Their diet must have been confined  almost wholly to the vegetable kind; and the same tree, which in its  flourishing state produced them berries, in its decay gave them an  habitation. The mutual desires of the sexes uniting their bodies and  affections, and the children which are the results of these  intercourses, introduced first the notion of society, and taught its  conveniences. This society, founded in natural appetites and instincts,  and not in any positive institution, I shall call _natural society_.  Thus far nature went and succeeded: but man would go farther. The great  error of our nature is, not to know where to stop, not to be satisfied  with any reasonable acquirement; not to compound with our condition; but  to lose all we have gained by an insatiable pursuit after more. Man  found a considerable advantage by this union of many persons to form one  family; he therefore judged that he would find his account  proportionably in an union of many families into one body politic. And  as nature has formed no bond of union to hold them together, he supplied  this defect by _laws_.    This is _political society_. And hence the sources of what are usually  called states, civil societies, or governments; into some form of which,  more extended or restrained, all mankind have gradually fallen. And  since it has so happened, and that we owe an implicit reverence to all  the institutions of our ancestors, we shall consider these institutions  with all that modesty with which we ought to conduct ourselves in  examining a received opinion; but with all that freedom and candor which  we owe to truth wherever we find it, or however it may contradict our  own notions, or oppose our own interests. There is a most absurd and  audacious method of reasoning avowed by some bigots and enthusiasts, and  through fear assented to by some wiser and better men; it is this: they  argue against a fair discussion of popular prejudices, because, say  they, though they would be found without any reasonable support, yet the  discovery might be productive of the most dangerous consequences. Absurd  and blasphemous notion! as if all happiness was not connected with the  practice of virtue, which necessarily depends upon the knowledge of  truth; that is, upon the knowledge of those unalterable relations which  Providence has ordained that every thing should bear to every other.  These relations, which are truth itself, the foundation of virtue, and  consequently the only measures of happiness, should be likewise the only  measures by which we should direct our reasoning. To these we should  conform in good earnest; and not think to force nature, and the whole  order of her system, by a compliance with our pride and folly, to  conform to our artificial regulations. It is by a conformity to this  method we owe the discovery of the few truths we know, and the little  liberty and rational happiness we enjoy. We have something fairer play  than a reasoner could have expected formerly; and we derive advantages  from it which are very visible.    The fabric of superstition has in this our age and nation received much  ruder shocks than it had ever felt before; and through the chinks and  breaches of our prison, we see such glimmerings of light, and feel such  refreshing airs of liberty, as daily raise our ardor for more. The  miseries derived to mankind from superstition under the name of  religion, and of ecclesiastical tyranny under the name of church  government, have been clearly and usefully exposed. We begin to think  and to act from reason and from nature alone. This is true of several,  but by far the majority is still in the same old state of blindness and  slavery; and much is it to be feared that we shall perpetually relapse,  whilst the real productive cause of all this superstitious folly,  enthusiastical nonsense, and holy tyranny, holds a reverend place in the  estimation even of those who are otherwise enlightened.    Civil government borrows a strength from ecclesiastical; and artificial  laws receive a sanction from artificial revelations. The ideas of  religion and government are closely connected; and whilst we receive  government as a thing necessary, or even useful to our well-being, we  shall in spite of us draw in, as a necessary, though undesirable  consequence, an artificial religion of some kind or other. To this the  vulgar will always be voluntary slaves; and even those of a rank of  understanding superior, will now and then involuntarily feel its  influence. It is therefore of the deepest concernment to us to be set  right in this point; and to be well satisfied whether civil government  be such a protector from natural evils, and such a nurse and increaser  of blessings, as those of warm imaginations promise. In such a  discussion, far am I from proposing in the least to reflect on our most  wise form of government; no more than I would, in the freer parts of my  philosophical writings, mean to object to the piety, truth, and  perfection of our most excellent Church. Both, I am sensible, have their  foundations on a rock. No discovery of truth can prejudice them. On the  contrary, the more closely the origin of religion and government is  examined, the more clearly their excellences must appear. They come  purified from the fire. My business is not with them. Having entered a  protest against all objections from these quarters, I may the more  freely inquire, from history and experience, how far policy has  contributed in all times to alleviate those evils which Providence, that  perhaps has designed us for a state of imperfection, has imposed; how  far our physical skill has cured our constitutional disorders; and  whether it may not have introduced new ones, curable perhaps by no  skill.    In looking over any state to form a judgment on it, it presents itself  in two lights; the external, and the internal. The first, that relation  which it bears in point of friendship or enmity to other states. The  second, that relation which its component parts, the governing and the"]]]
