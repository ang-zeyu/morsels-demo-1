And then she went to the porridge of the  Little Wee Bear, and tasted it, and that was neither too hot nor too  cold, but just right, and she liked it so well that she ate it all up,  every bit!    Then Goldilocks, who was tired, for she had been catching butterflies  instead of running on her errand, sate down in the chair of the Great  Big Bear, but that was too hard for her. And then she sate down in the  chair of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too soft for her. But when  she sat down in the chair of the Little Wee Bear, that was neither too  hard nor too soft, but just right. So she seated herself in it, and  there she sate till the bottom of the chair came out, and down she came,  plump upon the ground; and that made her very cross, for she was a  bad-tempered little girl.    Now, being determined to rest, Goldilocks went upstairs into the  bedchamber in which the Three Bears slept. And first she lay down upon  the bed of the Great Big Bear, but that was too high at the head for  her. And next she lay down upon the bed of the Middle-sized Bear, and  that was too high at the foot for her. And then she lay down upon the  bed of the Little Wee Bear, and that was neither too high at the head  nor at the foot, but just right. So she covered herself up comfortably,  and lay there till she fell fast asleep.    By this time the Three Bears thought their porridge would be cool enough  for them to eat it properly; so they came home to breakfast. Now  careless Goldilocks had left the spoon of the Great Big Bear standing in  his porridge.                    \"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\"    said the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.    Then the Middle-sized Bear looked at his porridge and saw the spoon was  standing in it too.                    \"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!\"    said the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.    Then the Little Wee Bear looked at his, and there was the spoon in the  porridge-bowl, but the porridge was all gone!          \"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE, AND HAS EATEN IT ALL UP!\"    said the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.    Upon this the Three Bears, seeing that some one had entered their house,  and eaten up the Little Wee Bear's breakfast, began to look about them.  Now the careless Goldilocks had not put the hard cushion straight when  she rose from the chair of the Great Big Bear.                    \"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!\"    said the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.    And the careless Goldilocks had squatted down the soft cushion of the  Middle-sized Bear.                    \"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!\"    said the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.          \"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR, AND HAS SATE THE BOTTOM         THROUGH!\"    said the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.    Then the Three Bears thought they had better make further search in case  it was a burglar, so they went upstairs into their bedchamber. Now  Goldilocks had pulled the pillow of the Great Big Bear out of its place.                    \"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!\"    said the Great Big Bear in his great, rough, gruff voice.    And Goldilocks had pulled the bolster of the Middle-sized Bear out of  its place.                    \"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!\"    said the Middle-sized Bear in his middle-sized voice.    But when the Little Wee Bear came to look at his bed, there was the  bolster in its place!    And the pillow was in its place upon the bolster!    And upon the pillow----?    There was Goldilocks's yellow head--which was not in its place, for she  had no business there.          \"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED,--AND HERE SHE IS STILL!\"    said the Little Wee Bear in his little wee voice.    [Illustration: \"Somebody has been lying in my bed,--and here she is!\"]    Now Goldilocks had heard in her sleep the great, rough, gruff voice of  the Great Big Bear; but she was so fast asleep that it was no more to  her than the roaring of wind, or the rumbling of thunder. And she had  heard the middle-sized voice of the Middle-sized Bear, but it was only  as if she had heard some one speaking in a dream. But when she heard the  little wee voice of the Little Wee Bear, it was so sharp, and so shrill,  that it awakened her at once. Up she started, and when she saw the Three  Bears on one side of the bed, she tumbled herself out at the other, and  ran to the window. Now the window was open, because the Bears, like  good, tidy Bears, as they were, always opened their bedchamber window  when they got up in the morning. So naughty, frightened little  Goldilocks jumped; and whether she broke her neck in the fall, or ran  into the wood and was lost there, or found her way out of the wood and  got whipped for being a bad girl and playing truant, no one can say. But  the Three Bears never saw anything more of her.    [Illustration: \"Somebody has been at my porridge, and has eaten it all  up!\"]          TOM-TIT-TOT      Once upon a time there was a woman and she baked five pies. But when  they came out of the oven they were over-baked, and the crust was far  too hard to eat. So she said to her daughter:    \"Daughter,\" says she, \"put them pies on to the shelf and leave 'em there  awhile. Surely they'll come again in time.\"    By that, you know, she meant that they would become softer; but her  daughter said to herself, \"If Mother says the pies will come again, why  shouldn't I eat these now?\" So, having good, young teeth, she set to  work and ate the lot, first and last.    Now when supper-time came the woman said to her daughter, \"Go you and  get one of the pies. They are sure to have come again by now.\"    Then the girl went and looked, but of course there was nothing but the  empty dishes.    So back she came and said, \"No, Mother, they ain't come again.\"    \"Not one o' them?\" asked the mother, taken aback like.    \"Not one o' them,\" says the daughter, quite confident.    \"Well,\" says the mother, \"come again, or not come again, I will have one  of them pies for my supper.\"    \"But you can't,\" says the daughter. \"How can you if they ain't come? And  they ain't, as sure's sure.\"    \"But I can,\" says the mother, getting angry. \"Go you at once, child, and  bring me the best on them. My teeth must just tackle it.\"    \"Best or worst is all one,\" answered the daughter, quite sulky, \"for  I've ate the lot, so you can't have one till it comes again--so there!\"    Well, the mother she bounced up to see; but half an eye told her there  was nothing save the empty dishes; so she was dished up herself and done  for.    So, having no supper, she sate her down on the doorstep, and, bringing  out her distaff, began to spin. And as she span she sang:      \"My daughter ha' ate five pies to-day,     My daughter ha' ate five pies to-day,     My daughter ha' ate five pies to-day,\"    for, see you, she was quite flabbergasted and fair astonished.    Now the King of that country happened to be coming down the street, and  he heard the song going on and on, but could not quite make out the  words. So he stopped his horse, and asked:    \"What is that you are singing, my good woman?\"    [Illustration: \"What is that you are singing, my good woman?\"]    Now the mother, though horrified at her daughter's appetite, did not  want other folk, leastwise the King, to know about it, so she sang  instead:      \"My daughter ha' spun five skeins to-day,     My daughter ha' spun five skeins to-day,     My daughter ha' spun five skeins to-day.\"    \"Five skeins!\" cried the King. \"By my garter and my crown, I never heard  tell of any one who could do that! Look you here, I have been searching  for a maiden to wife, and your daughter who can spin five skeins a day  is the very one for me. Only, mind you, though for eleven months of the  year she shall be Queen indeed, and have all she likes to eat, all the  gowns she likes to get, all the company she likes to keep, and  everything her heart desires, in the twelfth month she must set to work  and spin five skeins a day, and if she does not she must die. Come! is  it a bargain?\"    So the mother agreed. She thought what a grand marriage it was for her  daughter. And as for the five skeins? Time enough to bother about them  when the year came round. There was many a slip between cup and lip,  and, likely as not, the King would have forgotten all about it by then.    Anyhow, her daughter would be Queen for eleven months. So they were  married, and for eleven months the bride was happy as happy could be.  She had everything she liked to eat, and all the gowns she liked to get,  all the company she cared to keep, and everything her heart desired. And  her husband the King was kind as kind could be. But in the tenth month  she began to think of those five skeins and wonder if the King  remembered. And in the eleventh month she began to dream about them as  well. But ne'er a word did the King, her husband, say about them; so she  hoped he had forgotten.    But on the very last day of the eleventh month, the King, her husband,  led her into a room she had never set eyes on before. It had one window,  and there was nothing in it but a stool and a spinning-wheel.    \"Now, my dear,\" he said quite kind like, \"you will be shut in here  to-morrow morning with some victuals and some flax, and if by evening  you have not spun five skeins, your head will come off.\"    Well she was fair frightened, for she had always been such a gatless  thoughtless girl that she had never learnt to spin at all. So what she  was to do on the morrow she could not tell; for, see you, she had no one  to help her; for, of course, now she was Queen, her mother didn't live  nigh her. So she just locked the door of her room, sat down on a stool,  and cried and cried and cried until her pretty eyes were all red.    Now as she sate sobbing and crying she heard a queer"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17042"],[0,"Illustration of the Method of Recording Indian Languages (#4)"],[1,"said.

NOTES.    588, 24. This word \"hduze\" means _to take_ or _hold one's own;_  and is most commonly applied to a man's taking a wife, or a woman  a husband. Here it may mean either that one who starts in a wicked  course consorts with others \"more wicked than himself,\" or that he  himself grows in the bad and takes hold of the greater forms of  evil--_marries_ himself to the wicked one.    It will be noted from this specimen of Dakota that there are  some particles in the language which cannot be represented in a  translation. The \"do\" used at the end of phrases or sentences is  only for emphasis and to round up a period. It belongs mainly to the  language of young men. \"Wo\" and \"po\" are the signs of the imperative.      TRANSLATION.    There was a dog; and there was an old woman who had a pack of dried  meat laid away. This the dog knew; and, when he supposed the old woman  was asleep, he went there at night. But the old woman was aware of his  coming and so kept watch, and, as the dog thrust his head under the  tent, she struck him across the face and made a great gash, which  swelled greatly.    The next morning a companion dog came and attempted to talk with him.  But the dog was sullen and silent. The visitor said: \"Tell me what  makes you so heart-sick.\" To which he replied: \"Be still, an old woman  has treated me badly.\" \"What did she do to you?\" He answered: \"An old  woman had a pack of dried meat; this I saw and went for it; and when  it was now far in the night, and I supposed she was asleep, I went  there and poked my head under the tent. But she was lying awake and  cried out: 'Shoo! what are you doing here?' and struck me on the head  and wounded me as you see.\"    Whereupon the other dog said: \"Alas! Alas! she has treated you  badly, verily we will eat up her pack of meat. Call an assembly:  call _Water-mist_ (i.e., rain); call _Bite-off-silently_; call  _Strong-neck_; call _Sharp-knife_.\" So he invited them all. And when  they had all arrived, he said: \"Come on! an old woman has treated this  friend badly; bestir yourselves; before the night is past, the pack of  dried meat which she prizes so much, and on account of which she has  thus dealt with our friend, that we will eat all up\".    Then the one who is called _Rain-mist_ caused it to rain, and it  rained all the day through until dark; and the tent was all drenched,  and the holes of the tent-pins were thoroughly softened. Then  _Bite-off-silently_ bit off all the lower tent-fastenings, but  he did it so quietly that the old woman knew nothing of it. Then  _Strong-neck_ came and seized the pack with his mouth, and carried it  far away. Whereupon _Sharp-knife_ came and ripped the pack through the  middle; and so, while it was yet night, they ate up the old woman's  pack of dried meat.    _Moral_.--A common thief becomes worse and worse by attaching himself  to more daring companions.
