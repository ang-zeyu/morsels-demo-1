[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17607"],[0,"Superstition In All Ages (1732) (#4)"],[1,"       VIII.--THE NOTION OF GOD IS IMPOSSIBLE.    If God is an infinite being, there can be neither in the actual world or  in another any proportion between man and his God; thus the idea of God  will never enter the human mind. In the supposition of a life where men  will be more enlightened than in this one, the infinity of God will  always place such a distance between his idea and the limited mind of  man, that he will not be able to conceive of God any more in a future  life than in the present. Hence, it evidently follows that the idea of  God will not be better suited to man in the other life than in the  present. God is not made for man; it follows also that intelligences  superior to man--such as angels, archangels, seraphims, and saints--can  have no more complete notions of God than has man, who does not  understand anything about Him here below.          IX.--ORIGIN OF SUPERSTITION.    How is it that we have succeeded in persuading reasonable beings that  the thing most impossible to understand was the most essential for them.  It is because they were greatly frightened; it is because when men are  kept in fear they cease to reason; it is because they have been  expressly enjoined to distrust their reason. When the brain is troubled,  we believe everything and examine nothing.          X.--ORIGIN OF ALL RELIGION.    Ignorance and fear are the two pivots of all religion. The uncertainty  attending man's relation to his God is precisely the motive which  attaches him to his religion. Man is afraid when in darkness--physical or  moral. His fear is habitual to him and becomes a necessity; he would  believe that he lacked something if he had nothing to fear.          XI.--IN THE NAME OF RELIGION CHARLATANS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE WEAKNESS  OF MEN.    He who from his childhood has had a habit of trembling every time he  heard certain words, needs these words, and needs to tremble. In this  way he is more disposed to listen to the one who encourages his fears  than to the one who would dispel his fears. The superstitious man wants  to be afraid; his imagination demands it. It seems that he fears nothing  more than having no object to fear. Men are imaginary patients, whom  interested charlatans take care to encourage in their weakness, in order  to have a market for their remedies. Physicians who order a great number  of remedies are more listened to than those who recommend a good  regimen, and who leave nature to act.          XII.--RELIGION ENTICES IGNORANCE BY THE AID OF THE MARVELOUS.    If religion was clear, it would have fewer attractions for the ignorant.  They need obscurity, mysteries, fables, miracles, incredible things,  which keep their brains perpetually at work. Romances, idle stories,  tales of ghosts and witches, have more charms for the vulgar than true  narrations.          XIII.--CONTINUATION.    In the matter of religion, men are but overgrown children. The more  absurd a religion is, and the fuller of marvels, the more power it  exerts; the devotee thinks himself obliged to place no limits to his  credulity; the more inconceivable things are, the more divine they  appear to him; the more incredible they are, the more merit he gives  himself for believing them.          XIV.--THERE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ANY RELIGION IF THERE HAD NEVER BEEN  ANY DARK AND BARBAROUS AGES.    The origin of religious opinions dates, as a general thing, from the  time when savage nations were yet in a state of infancy. It was to  coarse, ignorant, and stupid men that the founders of religion addressed  themselves in all ages, in order to present them with Gods, ceremonies,  histories of fabulous Divinities, marvelous and terrible fables. These  chimeras, adopted without examination by the fathers, have been  transmitted with more or less changes to their polished children, who  often do not reason more than their fathers.          XV.--ALL RELIGION WAS BORN OF THE DESIRE TO DOMINATE.    The first legislators of nations had for their object to dominate, The  easiest means of succeeding was to frighten the people and to prevent  them from reasoning; they led them by tortuous paths in order that they  should not perceive the designs of their guides; they compelled them to  look into the air, for fear they should look to their feet; they amused  them upon the road by stories; in a word, they treated them in the way  of nurses, who employ songs and menaces to put the children to sleep, or  to force them to be quiet.          XVI.--THAT WHICH SERVES AS A BASIS FOR ALL RELIGION IS VERY UNCERTAIN.    The existence of a God is the basis of all religion. Few people seem to  doubt this existence, but this fundamental principle is precisely the  one which prevents every mind from reasoning. The first question of  every catechism was, and will always be, the most difficult one to  answer.          XVII.--IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO BE CONVINCED OF THE EXISTENCE OF GOD.    Can one honestly say that he is convinced of the existence of a being  whose nature is not known, who remains inaccessible to all our senses,  and of whose qualities we are constantly assured that they are  incomprehensible to us? In order to persuade me that a being exists, or  can exist, he must begin by telling me what this being is; in order to  make me believe the existence or the possibility of such a being, he  must tell me things about him which are not contradictory, and which do  not destroy one another; finally, in order to convince me fully of the  existence of this being, he must tell me things about him which I can  comprehend, and prove to me that it is impossible that the being to whom  he attributes these qualities does not exist.          XVIII.--CONTINUATION.    A thing is impossible when it is composed of two ideas so antagonistic,  that we can not think of them at the same time. Evidence can be relied  on only when confirmed by the constant testimony of our senses, which  alone give birth to ideas, and enable us to judge of their conformity or  of their incompatibility. That which exists necessarily, is that of  which the non-existence would imply contradiction. These principles,  universally recognized, are at fault when the question of the existence  of God is considered; what has been said of Him is either unintelligible  or perfectly contradictory; and for this reason must appear impossible  to every man of common sense.          XIX.--THE EXISTENCE OF GOD IS NOT PROVED.    All human intelligences are more or less enlightened and cultivated. By  what fatality is it that the science of God has never been explained?  The most civilized nations and the most profound thinkers are of the  same opinion in regard to the matter as the most barbarous nations and  the most ignorant and rustic people. As we examine the subject more  closely, we will find that the science of divinity by means of reveries  and subtleties has but obscured it more and more. Thus far, all religion  has been founded on what is called in logic, a \"begging of the  question;\" it supposes freely, and then proves, finally, by the  suppositions it has made.          XX.--TO SAY THAT GOD IS A SPIRIT, IS TO SPEAK WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING AT  ALL.    By metaphysics, God is made a pure spirit, but has modern theology  advanced one step further than the theology of the barbarians? They  recognized a grand spirit as master of the world. The barbarians, like  all ignorant men, attribute to spirits all the effects of which their  inexperience prevents them from discovering the true causes. Ask a  barbarian what causes your watch to move, he will answer, \"a spirit!\"  Ask our philosophers what moves the universe, they will tell you \"it is  a spirit.\"          XXI.--SPIRITUALITY IS A CHIMERA.    The barbarian, when he speaks of a spirit, attaches at least some sense  to this word; he understands by it an agent similar to the wind, to the  agitated air, to the breath, which produces, invisibly, effects that we  perceive. By subtilizing, the modern theologian becomes as little  intelligible to himself as to others. Ask him what he means by a spirit?  He will answer, that it is an unknown substance, which is perfectly  simple, which has nothing tangible, nothing in common with matter. In  good faith, is there any mortal who can form the least idea of such a  substance? A spirit in the language of modern theology is then but an  absence of ideas. The idea of spirituality is another idea without a  model.          XXII.--ALL WHICH EXISTS SPRINGS FROM THE BOSOM OF MATTER.    Is it not more natural and more intelligible to deduce all which exists,  from the bosom of matter, whose existence is demonstrated by all our  senses, whose effects we feel at every moment, which we see act, move,  communicate, motion, and constantly bring living beings into existence,  than to attribute the formation of things to an unknown force, to a  spiritual being, who can not draw from his ground that which he has not  himself, and who, by the spiritual essence claimed for him, is incapable  of making anything, and of putting anything in motion? Nothing is  plainer than that they would have us believe that an intangible spirit  can act upon matter.          XXIII.--WHAT IS THE METAPHYSICAL GOD OF MODERN THEOLOGY?    The material Jupiter of the ancients could move, build up, destroy, and  propagate beings similar to himself; but the God of modern theology is a  sterile being. According to his supposed nature he can neither occupy  any place, nor move matter, nor produce a visible world, nor propagate  either men or Gods. The metaphysical God is a workman without hands; he  is able but to produce clouds, suspicions, reveries, follies, and  quarrels.          XXIV.--IT WOULD BE MORE RATIONAL TO WORSHIP THE SUN THAN A SPIRITUAL GOD.    Since it was necessary for men to have a God, why did they not have the  sun, the visible God, adored by so many nations? What being had more  right to the homage of mortals than the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17615"],[0,"In Search of the Okapi (#4)"],[1,"a fair chance to catch malaria?\"    \"A better chance,\" said Mr. Hume, grimly, \"than we have of catching  the okapi. Fear the mosquito, but at the same time take every  precaution against its attack. I have an idea myself that nature has  provided a safeguard.\"    \"Quinine?\" said Venning.    \"Quinine is an antidote. I mean a preventive--but that is your  department, Venning. It will be one of your duties to study the  little brute, and you may make a great discovery, for instance, it  has been discovered that the mosquito dislikes certain colours. Why?  It may be that he would show more distinctly on one colour than on  another, and so fall an easy victim to an insect-eating bird. But it  may be that the leaves of some plant of a particular hue, or the  juices of the plant, are distasteful to the insect. Flies don't like  the leaves of the blue-gum, and I guess mosquitoes have their likes  and dislikes. Find the plant they dislike, and we may defy them.\"    They had no accommodation for such a luxury as a tent, but instead  they purchased canvas hammocks, each with a waterproof covering, and  a roll of green canvas with strong eyelet-holes, to serve the  purpose of a tent, in addition to a canvas awning with bamboo rods,  to cover the whole boat in case they were not able to land for any  length of time.    It was a pleasant time for the boys, and when at last they were  pitching down the Channel into the Bay of Biscay, having meanwhile  passed through a miserable twenty-four hours, they inhaled the  strong salt air and clapped each other on the back.    It was grand!    They stood in the bows, one hand on the rail, the other on the brim  of a hat, and tasted the salt with a smack of the lips. The wind  blew its life into their eyes, brightened them, toughened their  skins, reddened them, and the spray, drying on the red, softened the  colour to a fine healthy brown. Then the good ship heeled over and  rolled back with a swing of the yards, and the first roller from the  Atlantic went majestically by. They were on the old, old track of  the adventurers, of the sea-rovers, of the great captains, of the  empire builders, and before them, far off in the fastness of the  Dark Continent, was the Great Forest with all its secrets fast held.        CHAPTER III    THE CANOE ADRIFT    They passed in time the rocks that guard Madeira, the green bay of  Funchal, the peak of Teneriffe, and then the ship turned on its heel  to the West Coast, and, while yet a thousand miles away, was  welcomed by two messengers--a shrike and a hawk-moth, who had sailed  along some upper current of air with red sand from the Sahara to  filter down at last on to a firm resting-place.    They went away down into the Gulf of Guinea, and with many a call by  the way to discharge cargo,  approached the mouth of the Congo,  whose flood gave a tawny colour to the sea. So far they had seen  nothing but the squalid fringe of the Continent, and the damp heat  had steamed them and tried them, but the young explorers had not  lost the fine edge of their imagination. They knew that hundreds of  miles back in the unexplored heart of the land there were secrets to  be unraveled, and though they shed their warmer clothing, they  retained their ardour. The river somewhere in its far reaches held  for them, and them alone, new forms of life--the  grandfather of all  the crocodiles, a mammoth hippo; and  somewhere in the forest was  some huge gorilla waiting to offer them battle. Moreover, were these  not the gates of the Place of Rest?    \"Surely,\" said Compton, as they steamed slowly into the night off  the mouth of the great river, \"thy slave is not cast down because  the black children of the mud-house at our last calling-place did  mock us with their mouths, and the man, their father, wore the silk  hat and frock-coat of civilization?\"    \"Perish the thought,\" said Venning, throwing a banana peel at a  brilliant flash of phosphorescent light in the oily waters. \"Yet the  man-who-was-tired, he of the parchment face, who sat on a verandah  with his feet on the rail, prophesied that within seven days we  should be sighing for English bacon in the country where a white man  could breathe.\"    \"There is no snap in the air; but I can breathe freely. See;\" and  Compton took a deep breath.    \"That is the teaching of the hunter,\" said Venning, wisely. \"Deep  breathing gives a man deep lungs. That is his teaching. Also this,  that a man should keep his skin clean and his muscles supple by hard  rubbing after the bath. Therefore, I did ask the bo'sun to turn the  hose on us in the morning when they clean down the decks. It is good  friction.\"    \"And he has another saying--that it is good for the skin to apply  oil with the palm of the hand till the skin reddens. I have a smell  about me like a blue gum-tree, for the ointment he gave contains  eucalyptus oil.\"    \"And the fat of a goat. There is much virtue in goats' fat, and the  eucalyptus is not to the taste of the trumpeter.\"    \"The mosquito?\"    \"Even so.\"    \"Then why don't you say so in good English?\" and Compton dropped  away from his high-flown speech. \"I bet that's a shark kicking up  all that phosphorescence.\"    \"He swims in fire, like the--like the----\"    \"Sprat!\"    \"Like Apollo, you lean-minded insect. With every sweep of his tail  he sends out diadems of liquid gems, and his broad nose shovels fire  before him like a----\"    \"Stoker. Exactly; and if we had a lump of fat pork and a hook we  could drag him up and collect a basketful of jewels.  I dare say he  is leering up at us with a green and longing eye.\"    \"Did you hear that cry?\" asked Venning, suddenly.    \"No.\" \"Was it the shark whispering, do you think?\"    \"Shut up and listen.\"    They leant over the rail and peered into the night. The drowsy air  throbbed to the measured beat of the engines, but they scarcely  noticed that accustomed sound.    \"There it is again.\"    \"Yes. I heard something like a sheep bleating.\"    \"Would a sheep be swimming out here, you ass?\"    \"The shark's off--look!\" and they saw a streak of fire shoot  forward.    \"And there goes another. By Jove, they must have heard the cry!\"    \"I'm sorry for the sheep then,\" muttered Compton.    They bent far forward, listening intently, and following the course  taken by the sharks as defined by the gleaming wake. The leadsman  swung out the sounder as the vessel slackened down with a yell from  the escape-valve that drowned all other sounds with its deafening  clamour.    \"By the deep nine!\" cried a bass voice.    The bell in the engine-room signaled the skipper's order, and the  ship felt her way once more. Again there was silence, save for the  throb of the engines and the grating of the steering-chain at  intervals.    \"I have not heard the cry again,\" said Compton.    \"Can you see anything over there--follow the line of my finger--  there, just by that gleam?\"    \"Yes; I think there is something.\"    \"Then I think the captain ought to know;\" and Venning ran off first  to Mr. Hume.    \"Something afloat, eh?\" and Mr. Home rose from his deck-chair.    \"Some one in distress, I think,\" They went on to the bridge, and  Venning began his story; but the captain cut him short by wheeling  round to the rail.    \"Ahoy, there--ahoy!\"    A startling response came in a long, quivering wail out of the dark  sea.    \"By the lord,\" muttered the captain, \"what's that?\"    \"Jackal,\" said Mr. Hume.    \"Impossible! We are miles from the shore.\"    \"Jackal, sure enough. Maybe sent adrift by a flood, and taken to a  tree.\"    The captain laughed. \"I thought it was a hoodoo at least.  Well,  lad\"--turning to Venning--\"you don't want me to pick up a creature  like that?\"    \"I don't think it is far away, sir. I think I see a tree or boat,  and if you would lower me over the bows and ease the vessel----\"    \"Well?\"    \"Perhaps I could pick it up.\"    \"You are not afraid of being bitten?\"    \"I think it would know I meant it good.\"    The skipper laughed good-humouredly. \"Well, you're a plucky lad,  and, at any rate, I'd not be losing time.\" He touched the bell, and  motioned to the steersman. The ship slowed down and came round. \"Mr.  Bobbins, just sling this young gentleman over the port-bows, and  have a light lowered.  Do you still stick to your bargain?\"    Venning answered by sliding off the bridge and climbing up into the  bows, where a knot of sailors had gathered at the gangway. A rope  was looped round his thigh, so as to give his arms play, and two men  stood to pay him over and down.    \"Here she is!\" sang out the mate.    The bell rang out, \"Stop her,\" and Venning went over, catching the  rope above his head with his left hand, and taking a turn round with  his right foot. There was a scraping sound against the side of the  vessel.    \"I've got hold,\" he shouted. \"It's a tree--no, a boat.\" Then, \"By  Jove!\"    \"What is it?\" cried several together, excited by the startled  exclamation.    \"Lower the light!\" The lantern sank over the side, but those above  could not see well because of the bulge of the hull.    \"Now lower me. I shall get in and make fast.\"    \"Take care!\" cried Mr. Hume.    \"Look out for the sharks, sir,\" sang out a sailor. \"There's one  coming up.\"    \"Lower away, please--quick!\"    The men lowered. \"That's right. I'm in the boat, or whatever it is.  Now let down the lantern.\"    Those leaning over the side saw Venning reach up for the lantern,  and then they heard a snarling and snapping.    \"Stand ready to haul in!\" cried the captain. \"That brute will attack  the boy. One of you men go down.\"    The snarling continued, mingled with soothing cries from Venning;  and then the weird howl burst forth anew, daunting the sailor who  was carrying out the captain's order.    The mate stepped forward. \"Stand aside!\" he cried, and swung himself  over and down. He reached Venning's  side, and they saw him peering  about him.    \"By thunder!\" he muttered.    \"What is it?\""]]]
