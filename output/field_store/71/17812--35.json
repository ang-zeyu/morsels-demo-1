I promise you that it shall cease,  gradually, within the next few weeks. The first step has already been  taken. The gentlemen of the _Union_ have fallen into the trap.    SENDEN.    Into what trap?    BLUMENBERG.    The one I set for them in our paper. [_Turning upon_ SCHMOCK _who is  standing in the doorway._] Why do you stand here, Schmock? Can't you  wait at the gate?    SCHMOCK.    I went where you did. Why should I not stand here? I know the Colonel  as well as you do.    BLUMENBERG.    Don't be forward and don't be impudent. Go and wait at the gate, and  when I bring you the article, quickly run with it to the  press--understand?    SCHMOCK.    How can I help understanding when you croak like a raven?    [_EXIT_.]    [Illustration: _Permission F Bruckmann, A -G, Munich_  AT THE CONCERT    ADOLPH VON MENZEL.]    BLUMENBERG (_to_ SENDEN).    He is a vulgar person, but he is useful! Now that we are alone,  listen! The other day when you brought me to call here, I begged the  Colonel just to write down his ideas on the questions of the day.    SENDEN.    Yes, alas! You piled on the flattery much too thick, but the old  gentleman did, nevertheless, at last take fire.    BLUMENBERG.    We begged him to read to us what he had written; he read it to us, we  praised it.    SENDEN.    It was very tiresome all the same.    BLUMENBERG.    I begged it of him for our paper.    SENDEN.    Yes, unfortunately! And now I must carry these bulky things to your  press. These articles are too heavy; they won't do the _Coriolanus_  any good.    BLUMENBERG.    Yet I printed them gladly. When a man has written for a paper he  becomes a good friend of that paper. The Colonel at once subscribed  for the _Coriolanus_, and, the next day, invited me to dinner.    SENDEN (_shrugging his shoulders_).    If that is all you gain by it!    BLUMENBERG.    It is merely the beginning.--The articles are clumsy; why should I not  say so?    SENDEN.    God knows they are!    BLUMENBERG.    And no one knows who the author is.    SENDEN.    That was the old gentleman's stipulation. I imagine he is afraid of  Oldendorf.    BLUMENBERG.    And precisely what I anticipated has come to pass. Oldendorf's paper  has today attacked these articles. Here is the latest issue of the  _Union_.    SENDEN.    Let me look at it. Well, that will be a fine mix-up! Is the attack  insulting?    BLUMENBERG.    The Colonel will be sure to consider it so. Don't you think that that  will help us against the professor?    SENDEN.    Upon my honor you are the slyest devil that ever crept out of an  inkstand!    BLUMENBERG.    Give it to me, the Colonel is coming. _Enter the_ COLONEL.    COLONEL.    Good morning, gentlemen!--[_aside_] and that Oldendorf should just  happen to be here! If only he will remain in the garden! Well, Mr.  Editor, how is the _Coriolanus_?    BLUMENBERG.    Our readers admire the new articles marked with an arrow. Is there any  chance that some more--    COLONEL (_drawing a manuscript from his pocket and looking round_).    I rely on your discretion. As a matter of fact I wanted to read it  through again on account of the structure of the sentences.    BLUMENBERG.    That can best be done in the proof-reading.    COLONEL.    I think it will do. Take it; but not a word--    BLUMENBERG.    You will let me send it at once to press. [_At the door._] Schmock!    [SCHMOCK _appears at the door, takes the manuscript and exit  quickly._]    SENDEN.    Blumenberg is keeping the sheet up to the mark, but, as he has  enemies, he has to fight hard to defend himself.    COLONEL (_amused_).    Enemies? Who does not have them? But journalists have nerves like  women. Everything excites you; every word that any one says against  you rouses your indignation! Oh come, you are sensitive people!    BLUMENBERG.    Possibly you are right, Colonel. But when one has opponents like this  _Union_--    COLONEL.    Oh, yes, the _Union_. It is a thorn in the flesh to both of you. There  is a great deal in it that I cannot praise; but, really when it comes  to sounding an alarm, attacking, and pitching in, it is cleverer than  your paper. The articles are witty; even when they are on the wrong  side one cannot help laughing at them.    BLUMENBERG.    Not always. In today's attack on the best articles the  _Coriolanus_ has published in a long time I see no wit at all.    COLONEL.    Attack on what articles?    BLUMENBERG.    On yours, Colonel. I must have the paper somewhere about  me.    [_Searches, and gives him a copy of the Union._]    COLONEL.    Oldendorf's paper attacks my articles! [_Reads._] \"We regret  such lack of knowledge--\"    BLUMENBERG.    And here--    COLONEL.    \"It is an unpardonable piece of presumption\"--What! I am  presumptuous?    BLUMENBERG.    And here--    COLONEL.    \"One may be in doubt as to whether the naivete of the  contributor is comical or tragical, but at all events he has no right  to join in the discussion\"--[_Throwing down the paper._] Oh, that is  contemptible! It is a low trick!    _Enter_ IDA _and_ OLDENDORF _from the garden._    SENDEN (_aside_).    Now comes the cloud-burst!    COLONEL.    Professor, your newspaper is making progress. To bad principles is now  added something else--baseness.    IDA (_frightened_).    Father!    OLDENDORF (_coming forward_).    Colonel, how can you justify this insulting expression?    COLONEL (_holding out the paper to him_).    Look here! That stands in your paper! In your paper, Oldendorf!    OLDENDORF.    The tone of the attack is not quite as calm as I could have wished--    COLONEL.    Not quite so calm? Not really?    OLDENDORF.    In substance the attack is justified.    COLONEL.    Sir! You dare say that to me!    IDA.    Father!    OLDENDORF.    Colonel, I do not comprehend this attitude, and I beg you to consider  that we are speaking before witnesses.    COLONEL.    Do not ask for any consideration. It would have been your place to  show consideration for the man whose friendship you are otherwise so  ready to claim.    OLDENDORF.    But, first of all, tell me frankly what is your own connection with  the articles attacked in the _Coriolanus_?    COLONEL.    A very chance connection, too insignificant in your eyes to deserve  your regard. The articles are by me!    IDA.    Heavens!    OLDENDORF (_vehemently_).    By you? Articles in the paper of this gentleman?    IDA (_entreating him_).    Edward!    OLDENDORF (_more calmly_).    The _Union_ has attacked not you but an unknown person, who to us was  merely a partisan of this gentleman. You would have spared us both  this painful scene had you not concealed from me the fact that you are  a correspondent of the _Coriolanus_.    COLONEL.    You will have to stand my continuing not to make you a confidant of my  actions. You have here given me a printed proof of your friendship,  which does not make me long for other proofs.    OLDENDORF (_taking up his hat_).    I can only say that I deeply regret the occurrence, but do not feel  myself in the least to blame. I hope, Colonel, that, when you think  the matter over calmly, you will come to the same conclusion. Good-by,  Miss Ida. Good day to you.    [_Exit as far as centre door._]    IDA (_entreating_).    Father, don't let him leave us that way!    COLONEL.    It is better than to have him stay.    _Enter_ ADELAIDE.    ADELAIDE (_entering in elegant traveling costume, meets_ OLDENDORF _at  the door_).    Not so fast, Professor!    [OLDENDORF _kisses her hand and leaves._]        IDA.      }(_together_ Adelaide! [_Falls into her arms._]).    COLONEL.  }  Adelaide! And at such a moment!      ADELAIDE (_holding_ IDA _fast and stretching out her hand to the_  COLONEL).    Shake hands with your compatriot. Aunt sends love, and Rosenau Manor,  in its brown autumn dress, presents its humble compliments. The  fields lie bare, and in the garden the withered leaves dance with the  wind.--Ah, Mr. von Senden!    COLONEL (_introducing_).    Mr. Blumenberg, the editor.    SENDEN.    We are delighted to welcome our zealous agriculturist to the city.    ADELAIDE.    And we should have been pleased occasionally to meet our neighbor in  the country.    COLONEL.    He has a great deal to do here. He is a great politician, and works  hard for the good cause.    ADELAIDE.    Yes, indeed, we read of his doings in the newspaper. I drove through  your fields yesterday. Your potatoes are not all in yet. Your steward  didn't get through with the work.    SENDEN.    You Rosenau people are privileged to get through a week earlier than  any one else.    ADELAIDE.    On the other hand, we have nothing to do but to farm. (_Amicably._)  The neighbors send greetings.    SENDEN.    Thank you. We must relinquish you now to friends who have more claim  on you than we have. But will you not receive me in the course of the  day so that I can ask for the news from home? [ADELAIDE _inclines her  head._]    SENDEN.    Good-by, Colonel. (_To_ IDA.) My respectful compliments, Miss Berg.    [_Exit together with_ BLUMENBERG.]    IDA (_embracing_ ADELAIDE).    I have you at last. Now everything will be all right!    ADELAIDE.    What is to be all right? Is anything not all right? Back there some  one passed me more quickly than usual, and here I see glistening eyes  and a furrowed brow. [_Kisses her on the eyes._] They shall not ruin  your pretty eyes. And you, honored friend, turn a more friendly  countenance to me.    COLONEL.    You must stay with us all winter; it will be the first you have given  us in a long time; we shall try to deserve such a favor.    ADELAIDE (_seriously_).    It is the first one since my father's death that I have cared to  mingle with the world again. Besides, I have business that calls me  here. You know I came of age this summer, and my legal friend, Judge  Schwarz, requires my presence. Listen, Ida, the servants are  unpacking, go and see that things are properly "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14472"],[0,"Showell's Dictionary of Birmingham (#4)"],[1," that month. It is built over that portion of  the G.W.R. line running from Monmouth Street to Temple Row, the front  facing the Great Western Hotel, occupying the site once filled by the  old Quaker's burial ground. It is the property of a company, and cost  nearly L100,000, the architect being Mr. W.H. Ward. The shops number 38,  and in addition there are 56 offices in the galleries.--The _Central  Arcade_ in Corporation Street, near to New Street, and leading into  Cannon Street, is from the designs of the same architect and was opened  September 26, 1881. Underneath the Arcade proper is the Central  Restaurant, and one side of the thoroughfare forms part of the shop of  Messrs. Marris and Norton.--The _North-Western Arcade_, which was opened  April 5, 1884, is like a continuation of the first-named, being also  built over the G.W.R. tunnel, and runs from Temple Row to Corporation  Street. The architect is Mr. W. Jenkins, and the undertakers Messrs.  Wilkinson and Riddell, who occupy the principal frontage. Several of the  twenty-six shops into which the Arcade is divided have connection with  places of business in Bull Street.--The _Imperial Arcade_, in Dale End,  next to St. Peter's Church, is also a private speculation (that of Mr.  Thos. Hall), and was opened at Christmas, 1883. It contains, in addition  to the frontage, thirty-two shops, with the same number of offices  above, while the basement forms a large room suitable for meetings,  auctions, &c., it being 135ft. long, 55ft. wide and nearly 15ft. high.  Two of the principal features of the Arcade are a magnificent stained  window, looking towards St. Peters, and a curious clock, said to be the  second of its kind in England, life-size figures of Guy, Earl of  Warwick, and his Countess, with their attendants, striking the hours and  quarters on a set of musical bells, the largest of which weighs about  5cwt.--_Snow Hill Arcade_, opposite the railway station, and leading to  Slaney Street, is an improvement due to Mr. C. Ede, who has adopted the  designs of Mr. J.S. Davis.--The _Hen and Chickens Arcade_ has been  designed by Mr. J.A. Cossins, for a company who purpose to build it,  and, at the same time, enlarge the well-known New Street hotel of the  same name. The portico and vestibule of the hotel will form the entrance  in New Street to the Arcade, which will contain two-dozen good-sized  shops, a large basement room for restaurant, &c.; the out in Worcester  Street being nearly facing the Market Hall.    ~Area of Borough.~--Birmingham covers an area of 8,400 acres, with an  estimated population of 400,680 (end of 1881), thus giving an average of  47.7 persons to an acre. As a means of comparison, similar figures are  given for a few other large towns:--                    Area in    Population  Persons                  Acres     in 1881    to acres  Bradford   ...  7,200     203,544     28.2  Bristol    ...  4,452     217,185     48.3  Leeds      ... 21,572     326,158     15.1  Leicester  ...  3,200     134,350     42.0  Liverpool  ...  5,210     549,834    105.6  Manchester ...  4,293     364,445     84.9  Nottingham ...  9,960     177,964     77.9  Newcastle  ...  5,372     151,822     28.3  Salford    ...  5,170     194,077     37.5  Sheffield  ... 19,651     312,943     15.9  Wolverhmptn     3,396      76,850     22.6      ~Arms of the Borough.~--The Town Council, on the 6th day of August,  1867, did resolve and declare that the Arms of the Borough should be  blazoned as follows: \"1st and 4th _azure_, a bend lozengy _or_; 2nd and  3rd, parti per pale _or_ and _gules_.\"--_(See cover)_.    ~Art and Artists.~--An \"Academy of Arts\" was organised in 1814, and an  exhibition of paintings took place in Union Passage that year, but the  experiment was not repeated. A School of Design, or \"Society of Arts,\"  was started Feb. 7, 1821; Sir Robert Lawley (the first Lord Wenlock)  presenting a valuable collection of casts from Grecian sculpture. The  first exhibition was held in 1826, at The Panorama, an erection then  standing on the site of the present building in New Street, the opening  being inaugurated by a conversazione on September 10. In 1858, the  School of Design was removed to the Midland Institute. The \"Society of  Artists\" may be said to have commenced in 1826, when several gentlemen  withdrew from the School of Design. Their number greatly increased by  1842, when they took possession of the Athenaeum, in which building their  exhibitions were annually held until 1858. In that year they returned to  New Street, acquiring the title of \"Royal\" in 1864. The Art Students'  Literary Association was formed in September, 1869.    ~Art Gallery and School of Art.~--In connection with the Central Free  Library a small gallery of pictures, works of Art, &c., loaned or  presented to the town, was opened to the public August 1, 1867, and from  time to time was further enriched. Fortunately they were all removed  previous to the disastrous fire of Jan. 11, 1879. A portion of the new  Reference Library is at present devoted to the same purpose, pending the  completion of the handsome edifice being erected by the Gas Committee at  the back of the Municipal Buildings, and of which it will form a part,  extending from Congreve Street along Edmund Street to Eden Place. The  whole of the upper portion of the building will be devoted to the  purposes of a Museum and Art Gallery, and already there has been  gathered the nucleus of what promises to be one of the finest  collections in the kingdom, more particularly in respect to works of Art  relating more or less to some of the principal manufactures of  Birmingham. There are a large number of valuable paintings, including  many good specimens of David Cox and other local artists; quite a  gallery of portraits of gentlemen connected with the town, and other  worthies; a choice collection of gems and precious stones of all kinds;  a number of rare specimens of Japanese and Chinese cloisonne enamels;  nearly a complete set of the celebrated Soho coins and medals, with many  additions of a general character; many cases of ancient Roman, Greek,  and Byzantine coins; more than an hundred almost priceless examples of  old Italian carvings, in marble and stone, with some dozens of ancient  articles of decorative furniture; reproductions of delicately-wrought  articles of Persian Art work, plate belonging to the old City Companies,  the Universities, and from Amsterdam and the Hague; a collection of  Wedgwood and other ceramic ware, the gift of Messrs. R. and G. Tangye,  with thousands of other rare, costly, and beautiful things. In  connection with the Art Gallery is the \"Public Picture Gallery Fund,\"  the founder of which was the late Mr. Clarkson Osler, who gave L3,000  towards it. From this fund, which at present amounts to about L450 per  year, choice pictures are purchased as occasion offers, many others  being presented by friends to the town, notably the works of David Cox,  which were given by the late Mr. Joseph Nettlefold.--The _School of  Art_, which is being built in Edmund Street, close to the Art Gallery,  is so intimately connected therewith that it may well be noticed with  it. The ground, about 1,000 square yards, has been given by Mr. Cregoe  Colmore, the cost of election being paid out of L10,000 given by Miss  Ryland, and L10,000 contributed by Messrs. Tangye. The latter firm have  also given L5,000 towards the Art Gallery; Mr. Joseph Chamberlain has  contributed liberally in paintings and in cash; other friends have  subscribed about L8,000; Mr. Nettlefold's gift was valued at L14,000,  and altogether not less than L40,000 has been presented to the town in  connection with the Art Gallery, in addition to the whole cost of the  School of Art.    ~Art Union.~--The first Ballot for pictures to be chosen from the Annual  Exhibition of Local Artists took place in 1835, the Rev. Hugh Hutton  having the honour of originating it. The tickets were 21s. each,  subscribers receiving an engraving.    ~Ash, John, M.D.~--Born in 1723, was an eminent physician who practised  in Birmingham for some years, but afterwards removed to London. He  devoted much attention to the analysis of mineral waters, delivered the  Harveian oration in 1790, and was president of a club which numbered  among its members some of the most learned and eminent men of the time.  Died in 1798.    ~Ashford, Mary.~--Sensational trials for murder have of late years been  numerous enough, indeed, though few of them have had much local  interest, if we except that of the poisoner Palmer. The death of the  unfortunate Mary Ashford, however, with the peculiar circumstance  attending the trial of the supposed murderer, and the latter's appeal to  the right then existing under an old English law of a criminal's claim  to a \"Trial of Battel,\" invested the case with an interest which even at  this date can hardly be said to have ceased. Few people can be found to  give credence to the possibility of the innocence of Abraham Thornton,  yet a careful perusal of a history of the world-known but last \"Wager of  Battel\" case, as written by the late Mr. Toulmin Smith, must lead to the  belief that the poor fellow was as much sinned against as sinning, local  prejudices and indignant misrepresentations notwithstanding. So far from  the appeal to the \"Wager of Battel\" being the desperate remedy of a  convicted felon to escape the doom justly imposed upon him for such  heinous offence as the murder of an innocent girl, it was simply the  attempt of a clever attorney to remove the stigma attached to an  unfortunate and much-maligned client. The dead body of Mary Ashford was  found in a pit of water in Sutton Coldfield, on the 27th of May, 1817,  she having been seen alive on the morning of the same day. Circumstances  instantly, and most naturally, fastened suspicion of foul play upon  Abraham Thornton. He was tried at Warwick, at the Autumn Assizes of"]]]
