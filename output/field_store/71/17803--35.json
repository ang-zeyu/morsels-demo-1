The Mishnah alluded to is short and simple, viz, Where is it      taught that a ship is clean to the touch? From Prov. xxx. 19,      \"The way of a ship in the midst of the sea.\" (i.e., as the sea      is clean to the touch, therefore a ship must also be clean to      the touch).    It is indiscreet for one to sleep in a house as the sole occupant, for  Lilith will seize hold of him.    Ibid., fol. 151, col. 2.        Lilith (the night-visiting one) is the name of a night spectre,      said to have been Adam's first wife, but who, for her refractory      conduct, was transformed into a demon endowed with power to      injure and even destroy infants unprotected by the necessary      amulet or charm.    \"Thou hast acknowledged the Lord this day to be thy God; and the Lord  hath acknowledged thee this day to be His peculiar people\" (Deut. xxvi.  17, 18). The Holy One--blessed be He!--said unto Israel, \"Ye have made  Me a name in the world, as it is written (Deut. vi. 4), 'Hear, O Israel,  the Lord our God is one Lord;' and so I will make you a name in the  world, as it is said (1 Chron. xvii. 21), 'And what one nation in the  earth is like Thy people Israel?'\"    _Chaggigah_, fol. 3, col. 1.    Why are the words of the Law compared to fire? (Jer. xxiii. 29.)  Because, as fire does not burn when there is but one piece of wood, so  do the words of the Law not maintain the fire of life when meditated on  by one alone (see, in confirmation, Matt, xviii. 20).    _Taanith_, fol. 7, col. i.    \"And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo\"  (Deut. xxxiv, i). Tradition says there were twelve stairs, but that  Moses surmounted them all in one step.    _Soteh_, fol. 13, col. 2.    Pieces of money given in charity should not be counted over by twos, but  one by one.    _Bava Bathra_, fol. 8, col. 2.    \"Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth?\"  (Job xxxix. 1.) The wild goat is cruel to her offspring. As soon as they  are brought forth, she climbs with them to the steep cliffs, that they  may fall headlong and die. But, said God to Job, to prevent this I  provide an eagle to catch the kid upon its wings, and then carry and lay  it before its cruel mother. Now, if that eagle should be too soon or too  late by one second only, instant death to the kid could not be averted;  but with Me one second is never changed for another. Shall Job be now  changed by Me, therefore, into an enemy. (Comp. Job ix. 17, and xxxiv.  35.)    _Bava Bathra_, fol. 16, cols. 1, 2.    A generation can have one leader only, and not two.    _Sanhedrin_, fol. 8, col. 1.    \"Like the hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces\" (Jer. xxiii. 29). As  a hammer divideth fire into many sparks, so one verse of Scripture has  many meanings and many explanations.    Ibid., fol. 34, col. 1.        In the Machser for Pentecost (p. 69) God is said to have      \"explained the law to His people, face to face, and on every      point ninety-eight explanations are given.\"    Adam was created one without Eve. Why? That the Sadducees might not  assert the plurality of powers in heaven.    Ibid., fol. 37, col. i.        As the Sadducees did not believe in a plurality of powers in      heaven, but only the Christians, in the regard of the Jews, did      so (by their profession of the doctrine of the Trinity), it is      obvious that here, as well as often elsewhere, the latter and      not the former are intended.    \"And the frog came up and covered the land of Egypt\" (Exod. viii. i; A.  V. viii. 6). \"There was but one frog,\" said Rabbi Elazar, \"and she so  multiplied as to fill the whole land of Egypt.\" \"Yes, indeed,\" said  Rabbi Akiva. \"there was, as you say, but one frog, but she herself was  so large as to fill all the land of Egypt.\" Whereupon Rabbi Elazar ben  Azariah said unto him, \"Akiva, what business hast thou with Haggadah? Be  off with thy legends, and get thee to the laws thou art familiar with  about plagues and tents. Though thou sayest right in this matter, for  there was only one frog, but she croaked so loud that the frogs came  from everywhere else to her croaking.\"    _Sanhedrin_, fol. 67, col. 2.        Rabba, the grandson of Channa, said that he himself once saw a      frog larger than any seen now, though not so large as the frog      in Egypt. It was as large as Acra, a village of some sixty      houses (_Bava Bathra_, fol. 73, col. 2.)        Apropos to the part the frog was conceived to play or symbolize      in the Jewish conception of the mode and ministry of Divine      judgment, we quote the following:--\"We are told that Samuel once      saw a frog carrying a scorpion on its back across a river, upon      the opposite bank of which a man stood waiting ready to be      stung. The sting proving fatal, so that the man died; upon which      Samuel exclaimed, 'Lord, they wait for Thy judgments this day:      for all are Thy servants.' (Ps. cxix. 91.)\" (_Nedarim_, fol. 41,      col. 1.)    \"According to the days of one king\" (Isa. xxiii. 15). What king is this  that is singled out as one? Thou must say this is the King Messiah, and  no other.    _Sanhedrin_, fol. 99, col. 1.    Rabbi Levi contends that Manasseh has no portion in the world to come,  while Rabbi Yehudah maintains that he has; and each supports his  conclusion in contradiction of the other, from one and the same  Scripture text.    Ibid., fol. 102, col. 2.    The words, \"Remember the Sabbath day,\" in Exod. xx. 8, and \"Keep the  Sabbath day,\" in Deut. v. 12, were uttered in one breath, as no man's  mouth could utter them, and no man's ear could hear.    _Shevuoth_, fol. 20, col. 2.    The officer who inflicts flagellation on a criminal must smite with one  hand only, but yet with all his force.    _Maccoth_, fol. 22, col. 2.    I would rather be called a fool all my days than sin one hour before  God.    _Edioth_, chap. 5, mish. 6.    He who observes but one precept secures for himself an advocate, and he  who commits one single sin procures for himself an accuser.    _Avoth_, chap. 4, mish. 15.    He who learns from another one chapter, one halachah, one verse, or one  word or even a single letter, is bound to respect him.    Ibid., chap. 6, mish. 3.        The above is one evidence, among many, of the high esteem in      which learning and the office of a teacher are held among the      Jews. Education is one of the virtues--of which the following,      extracted from the Talmud, is a list--the interest of which the      Jew considers he enjoys in this world, while the capital remains      intact against the exigencies of the world to come. These      are:--The honoring of father and mother, acts of benevolence,      hospitality to strangers, visiting the sick, devotion in prayer,      promotion of peace between man and man, and study in general,      but the study of the law outweighs them all. (_Shabbath_, fol.      127, col. 1.) The study of the law, it is said, is of greater      merit to rescue one from accidental death, than building the      Temple, and greater than honoring father or mother.      (_Meggillah_, fol. 16, col 2.)    \"Repent one day before thy death.\" In relation to which Rabbi Eliezer  was asked by his disciples, \"How is a man to repent one day before his  death, since he does not know on what day he shall die?\" \"So much the  more reason is there,\" he replied, \"that he should repent to-day, lest  he die to-morrow; and repent to-morrow, lest he die the day after: and  thus will all his days be penitential ones.\"    _Avoth d'Rab. Nathan_, chap. 15.    He who obliterates one letter from the written name of God, breaks a  negative command, for it is said, \"And destroy the names of them out of  that place. Ye shall not do so unto the Lord your God\" (Deut. xii. 3,  4).    _Sophrim_, chap. 5, hal. 6.    Rabbi Chanina could put on and off his shoes while standing on one leg  only, though he was eighty years of age.    _Chullin_, fol. 24, col. 2.    A priest who is blind in one eye should not be judge of the plague; for  it is said (Lev. xiii. 12), \"Wheresoever the priest (with both eyes)  looketh.\"    _Negaim_, chap. 2, mish. 3.    The twig of a bunch without any grapes is clean; but if there remained  one grape on it, it is unclean.    _Okzin_, chap, i, mish. 5.    Not every man deserves to have two tables.    _Berachoth_, fol. 5, col. 2.        The meaning of this rather ambiguous sentence may either be,      that all men are not able to succeed in more enterprises than      one at a time; or that it is not given to every one to make the      best both of the present world and of that which is to come.    Abba Benjamin used to say \"There are two things about which I have all  my life been much concerned: that my prayer should be offered in front  of my bed, and that the position of my bed should be from north to  south.\"    Ibid., fol. 5, col. 2.        There are several reasons which may be adduced to account for      Abba Benjamin's anxiety, and they are all more or less connected      with the important consequences which were supposed to depend      upon determining his position with reference to the Shechinah,      which rested in the east or the west.        Abba Benjamin felt anxious to have children, for \"any man not      having children is counted as dead,\" as it is written (Gen. xxx.      1), \"Give me children, or else I die.\" (_Nedarin_, fol. 64, col.      2.)        With the Jew one great consideration of life is to have      children, and more especially male children; because when a boy      is born all rejoice over him,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14370"],[0,"Zanetto; and Cavalleria Rusticana (#4)"],[1,"      Ne'er shall it hinder me, when to thee flying.

Gli aranci olezzano sui verdi margini,     cantan le allodole tra i mirti in fior;     tempo è si mormori da ognuno il tenero     canto che i palpiti raddoppia al cor.          Oranges blossoming, myrtle and jessamine        Mingle their fragrance with incense of flowers.        Morning now murmuring, hearts that were slumbering        Wake with the dawning with songs, as do ours.    MEN (within.)       In mezzo al campo tra le spiche d'oro     giunge il rumore delle vostre spole;     noi stanchi riposando dal lavoro     a voi pensiamo, o belle occhi-di-sole.     O belle occhi-di-sole, a voi corriamo,     come vola l'augello al suo richiamo.          To the harvest field, 'mid ears bright and golden,        The quick-flying spindles send out their humming;        We weary, while from our labors are holden,        To Thee, Light of Heaven, are humbly coming!

SCENE SECOND.    Santuzza and Lucia.      SANTUZZA (entering.)       Dite, mamma Lucia....          Tell me, mother Lucia--    LUCIA (surprised.)       Sei tu?... che vuoi?          Is it you? What would you?    SANTUZZA.       Turiddu ov'è?          Turiddu is here?    LUCIA.                    Fin qui vieni a cercare     il figlio mio?                       And why do you come here        To seek my son?    SANTUZZA.                     Voglio saper soltanto,     perdonatemi voi, dove trovarlo.                        Only that I may ask you--        Humbly I beg your pardon--where I may find him.    LUCIA.       Non lo so, non lo so, non voglio brighe!          I know not, I know not; bring me no trouble.    SANTUZZA.       Mamma Lucia, vi supplico piangendo,     fate come il Signore a Maddelena,     ditemi per pietà, dov'è Turiddu....          Mother Lucia! I supplicate you, weeping;        Kindly, as the Saviour to a Magdalen,        Tell me, for mercy's sake, where is Turiddu?    LUCIA.       È andato per il vino a Francofonte.          He is gone for the wine to Francofonte.    SANTUZZA.       No!... l'han visto in paese ad alta notte....          No! He was seen last night in the village.    LUCIA.       Che dici?... se non è tornato a casa!          What say you! Is he then again at home?          (Going toward the door of her house.)       Entra....          Enter!    SANTUZZA.                 Non posso entrare in casa vostra....     Sono scomunicata!                    Into your house I cannot enter!        I am condemned!    LUCIA.

With my horses bounding,        Wagon wheels resounding.          Cracking my whiplash--Ehi la!        Cold winds blowing steadily,        Rain and snow falling readily!          I care for nothing! Ehi la!    CHORUS.       O che bel mestiere     fare il carrettiere     andar di qua e di là!          Happy is his calling,        Richest treasures hauling,           As he goes here and there.    ALFIO.       M'aspetta a casa Lola     che m'ama e mi consola,     ch'è tutta fedeltà.     Il cavallo scalpiti,     i sonagli squillino,     è Pasqua, ed io son qua!          Me, Lola is awaiting,        All other lovers hating,          To her I am most dear!        Let the wind blow fearfully,        Lola watches tearfully,          'Tis Easter, and I'm here!    CHORUS.       O che bel mestiere     fare il carrettiere     andar di qua e di là!          Happy is his calling,        Richest treasures hauling,           As he goes here and there.    LUCIA.       Beato voi, compar Alfio, che siete     sempre allegro così!          You are blest, Master Alfio,        That you are always so full of joy.    ALFIO.                            Mamma Lucia,     n'avete ancora di quel vecchio vino?                               Mother Lucia,        Have you not more of that lovely old wine?    LUCIA.       Non so; Turiddu è andato a provvederne.          Perhaps; Turiddu has gone away to buy some.    ALFIO.       Se è sempre qui!--L'ho visto stamattina     vicino a casa mia.          He's always here! I saw him but this morning;        And very near my dwelling!    LUCIA (surprised.)       Come?          What!    SANTUZZA (quickly.)       Tacete.          Be silent!

Inneggiamo, il Signor non è morto.     Ei fulgente ha dischiuso l'avel,     inneggiamo al Signore risorto     oggi asceso alla gloria del Ciel!          We rejoice that our Saviour is living!          He all-glorious arose from the dead;        Joys of heaven the Lord to us giving,          All the sorrows of darkness are fled!          (The chorus goes out slowly.)      SCENE FOURTH.      Lucia and Santuzza.    LUCIA.       Perchè m'hai fatto segno di tacere?          And why did you thus make the sign of silence?    SANTUZZA.       Voi lo sapete, o mamma, prima d'andar soldato     Turiddu aveva a Lola eterna fè giurato.     Tornò, la seppe sposa; e con un nuovo amore     volle spegner la fiamma che gli bruciava il core:     m'amò, l'amai. Quell'invida d'ogni delizia mia,     del suo sposo dimentica, arse di gelosia....     Me l'ha rapito. Priva dell'onor mio rimango:     Lola e Turiddu s'amano, io piango, io piango, io piango!          You well know, dearest mother, when he went as a soldier,        Turiddu had sworn to Lola eternal faith and love.        Returned, he found her married; and with new affection        Would he put out the fire burning still in his bosom.        I love him, he loves me. That evil one, for all my rightful pleasure,        Of her own husband forgetful, burns now with jealousy.        Me she has outraged! Despoiled of my honor I live on--        Lola and Turiddu loving!--and I weeping!    LUCIA.       Miseri noi, che cosa vieni a dirmi     in questo santo giorno?          Wretched am I that such things should be told me        On this most holy morning.    SANTUZZA.                             Io son dannata....     Andate, o mamma, ad implorare Iddio,     e pregate per me.--Verrà Turiddu,     vo' supplicarlo un'altra volta ancora!                                I am condemned!        Go you, O mother, and implore our dear Saviour;        And to him pray for me. Here, to Turiddu        Will I again make humble supplication.    LUCIA (going toward the church.)       Ajutatela voi, Santa Maria! (esce)          And be thou our helper! Holy Maria! (She goes out.)      SCENE FIFTH.      Santuzza and Turiddu.    TURIDDU.       Tu qui, Santuzza?          You here, Santuzza?    SANTUZZA.       Qui t'aspettavo.          You I was awaiting.    TURIDDU.       È Pasqua, in chiesa non vai?          And Easter and church you are neglecting?    SANTUZZA.                        Non vo.     Debbo parlarti....                           I can not go.        I must speak with you!    TURIDDU.       Mamma cercavo.         I seek my mother.    SANTUZZA.       Debbo parlarti....          I must speak with you!    TURIDDU.       Qui no! Qui no!          Not here! not here!    SANTUZZA.       Dove sei stato?          Where have you been?    TURIDDU.                      Che vuoi tu dire?...     A Francofonte!                         Why do you ask me?        At Francofonte.    SANTUZZA.       No, non è ver!          No! 'Tis not true!    TURIDDU.       Santuzza, credimi....          Santuzza, trust in me!    SANTUZZA.                            No, non mentire;     ti vidi volgere giù dal sentier.     E stamattina, all'alba, t'hanno scôrto     presso l'uscio di Lola.                               No! You are lying;        I saw you turning here into this street.        And this morning at dawn they discovered you        Coming from Lola.    TURIDDU.       Ah! m'hai spiato!          Ah! you were spying!    SANTUZZA.       No, te lo giuro. A noi l'ha raccontato     Compar Alfio, il marito, poco fa.          No! I swear to you. To us it has been told        By Master Alfio.    TURIDDU.       Così ricambi l'amor che ti porto?     Vuoi che m'uccida?          Thus you return the love I gave you?        You wish him to kill me?    SANTUZZA.       Oh! questo non lo dire....          Ah! such a fate do not mention.    TURIDDU.       Lasciami dunque, invan tenti sopire     il giusto sdegno colla tua pietà.          Then you must leave me! In vain do you endeavor        My righteous anger thus to subdue!    SANTUZZA.       Tu l'ami dunque?          Ah, yes! you love her!    TURIDDU.       No....          No!    SANTUZZA.               Assai più bella     è Lola.                  And beautiful        Is Lola.    TURIDDU.       Taci, non l'amo.       Silence! I love her not.    SANTUZZA.                      L'ami....     Oh! maledetta!                         You love her!        Oh! curses "]]]
