Having now got clear of his Prison, he took Coach disguis'd in a Night  Gown at the corner of the _Old Baily_, along with a Man who waited for  him in the Street (and is suppos'd to be _Page_ the Butcher) ordering  the Coachman to drive to _Black-Fryers Stairs_, where his prostitute  gave him the Meeting, and they three took Boat, and went a Shoar at the  _Horse-Ferry_ at _Westminster_, and at the _White-Hart_ they went in,  Drank, and stay'd sometime; thence they adjourn'd to a Place in  _Holbourn_, where by the help of a Saw he quitted the Chains he had  brought with him from _Newgate_; and then like a Freeman took his Ramble  through the City and came to _Spittle-Fields_, and there lay with  _Edgeworth Bess_.    It may be easy to imagine what an alarm his Escape gave to the Keepers  of _Newgate_, three of their People being at the farther End of the  _Lodge_, engag'd in a Discourse concerning his wonderful Escape from  _New-Prison,_ and what Caution ought to be us'd, lest he should give  them the slip, at that very Instant as he perfected it.    On _Tuesday_ he sent for _William Page_ an Apprentice to a Butcher in  _Clare-Market_, who came to him, and being Pennyless, he desir'd _Page_  to give him what Assistance he could to make his way, and being a  Neighbour and Acquaintance, he comply'd with it; but e're he would do  any thing, he consulted a near Relation, who as he said, encourag'd him  in it; nay, put him upon it, so meeting with this Success in his  Application to his Friend, and probable an Assistance in the Pocket, he  came to _Sheppard_ having bought him a new blue _Butcher's_ Frock, and  another for himself, and so both took their Rout to _Warnden_ in  _Northamptonshire_, where they came to a Relation of _Page's_, who  receiv'd and Entertain'd them kindly, the People lying from their own  Bed to Accommodate them. _Sheppard_ pretending to be a _Butcher's_ Son  in _Clare-Market_, who was going farther in the Country to his Friends,  and that _Page_ was so kind as to Accompany him; but they as well as  their Friend became tir'd of one another; the _Butchers_ having but one  Shilling left, and the People poor, and Consequently unable to Subsist  two such Fellows, after a stay of three or four Days, they return'd, and  came for _London_, and reach'd the City on _Tuesday_ the 8th of  _September_, calling by the way at _Black-Mary's-Hole_, and Drinking  with several of their Acquaintance, and then came into _Bishopsgate  street_, to one _Cooley's_ a _Brandy-shop_; where a _Cobler_ being at  Work in his Stall, stept out and Swore _ther was_ Sheppard, _Sheppard_  hearing him, departed immediately. In the Evening they came into  _Fleet-street_, at about Eight of the Clock, and observing Mr. _Martins_  a Watchmaker's Shop to be open, and a little Boy only to look after it:  _Page_ goes in and asks the Lad whether Mr. _Taylor_ a _Watchmaker_  lodg'd in the House? being answer'd in the Negative, he came away, and  Reports the Disposition of the Place: _Sheppard_ now makes Tryal of his  old Master-peice; fixeth a Nail Peircer into the Door post, fastens the  Knocker thereto with Packthread, breaks the Glass, and takes out three  _Silver Watches_ of 15 l. value, the Boy seeing him take them, but could  not get out to pursue him, by reason of his Contrivance. One of the  Watches he Pledg'd for a Guinea and Half. The same Night they came into  _Watch-street_, _Sheppard_ going into his _Master's_ Yard, and calling  for his Fellow 'Prentice, his Mistress heard, knew his Voice, and was  dreadfully frightened; he next went to the _Cock_ and _Pye Ale-House_ in  _Drury-Lane_, sent for a Barber his Acquaintance, drank Brandy and eat  Oysters in the view of several people. _Page_ waiting all the while at  the Door, the whole Neighbourhood being alarm'd, yet none durst attempt  him, for fear of Pistols, _&c._ He had vow'd Revenge upon a poor Man as  kept a Dairy-Cellar, at the End of _White-Horse-Yard_, who having seen  him at _Islington_ after his Escape, and engag'd not to speak of it,  broke his Promise; wherefore _Sheppard_ went to his Residence took the  Door off the Hinges and threw it down amongst all the Man's Pans,  Pipkins, and caus'd a Deluge of Cream and Milk all over the Cellar.    This Night he had a narrow Escape, one Mr. _Ireton_ a Sheriffs Officer  seeing him and _Page_ pass thro' _Drury-Lane_, at about Ten o'clock  pursu'd 'em, and laid hold of _Page_ instead of _Sheppard_, who got off,  thus _Ireton_, missing the main Man, and thinking _Page_ of no  Consequence, let him go after him.    _Edgworth Bess_ had been apprehended by _Jonathan Wild_, and by Sir  _Francis Forbes_ one of the Aldermen of _London_, committed to the  _Poultry-Compter_, for being aiding and assisting to _Sheppard_ in his  Escape; the Keepers and others terrify'd and purg'd her as much as was  possible to discover where he was, but had it been in her Inclination,  it was not in her Power so to do, as it manifestly appear'd soon after.    The People about the _Strand_, _Witch-street_ and _Drury-Lane_, whom he  had Robb'd, and who had prosecuted him were under great Apprensions and  Terror, and in particular Mr. _Kneebone_, on whom he vow'd a bloody  Revenge; because he refus'd to sign a Petition in his behalf to the  _Recorder_ of _London_. This Gentleman was forc'd to keep arm'd People  up in his House every Night till he was Re-taken, and had the same  fortify'd in the strongest manner. Several other Shop-keepers in this  Neighbourhood were also put to great Expence and Trouble to Guard  themselves against this dreadful Villian.    The Keepers of _Newgate_, whom the rash World loaded with Infamy,  stigmatiz'd and branded with the Title of Persons guilty of Bribery;  for Connivance at his Escape, they and what Posse in their Power, either  for Love or Money did Contribute their utmost to undeceive a wrong  notion'd People. Their Vigilance was remarkably indefatigable, sparing  neither Money nor Time, Night nor Day to bring him back to his deserv'd  Justice. After many Intelligences, which they endeavour'd for, and  receiv'd, they had one which prov'd very Successful. Having learnt for a  certainty that their Haunts was about _Finchly Common_, and being very  well assur'd of the very House where they lay; on _Thursday_ the 10th of  _September_, a posse of Men, both of Spirit and Conduct, furnish'd with  Arms proper for their Design, went for _Finchley_, some in a Coach and  Four, and others on Horseback. They dispers'd themselves upon the  _Common_ aforesaid, in order to make their View, where they had not been  long e're they came in Sight of _SHEPPARD_ in Company of _WILLIAM PAGE_,  habited like two _Butchers_ in new blue Frocks, with white Aprons tuck'd  round their Wastes.    Upon _Sheppard's_ seeing _Langley_ a Turnkey at _Newgate_, he says to  his Companion _Page_, _I see a Stag_; upon which their Courage dropt;  knowing that now their dealing way of Business was almost at an End;  however to make their Flight as secure as they could, they thought it  adviseable to take to a Foot-path, to cut off the pursuit of the  _Newgate Cavalry_; but this did not prove most successful, _Langley_  came up with _Page_ (who was hindermost) and Dismounting with Pistol in  Hand, commands _Page_ to throw up his Hands, which he trembling did,  begging for Life, desiring him to _Fisk_ him, _viz._ (search him,) which  he accordingly did, and found a broad Knife and File; having thus  disarm'd him, he takes the _Chubb_ along with him in quest of the  slippery _Ele_, _Sheppard_; who had taken Shelter in an old Stable,  belonging to a Farm-House; the pursuit was close, the House invested,  and a Girl seeing his Feet as he stood up hid, discover'd him. _Austin_  a Turnkey first attach'd his Person. _Langley_ seconded him, _Ireton_ an  Officer help'd to Enclose, and happy was the hindermost who aided in  this great Enterprise. He being shock'd with the utmost Fear, told them  he submitted, and desir'd they would let him live as long as he could,  which they did, and us'd him mildly; upon searching him they found a  broad Knife with two of the Watches as he had taken out of Mr.  _Martin's_ Shop, one under each Armpit; and now having gain'd their  Point, and made themselves Masters of what they had often endeavoured  for, they came with their _Lost Sheep_ to a little House on the _Common_  that sold Liquors, with this Inscription on the Sign, _I have brought  my_ Hogs _to a fair Market_; which our two unfortunate _Butchers_ under  their then unhappy Circumstances, had too sad Reason to apply to  themselves. _Sheppard_ had by this time recover'd his Surprize, grew  calm and easy, and desir'd them to give him Brandy, they did, and were  all good Friends, and Company together.    They adjourn'd with their Booty to another Place, where was waiting a  Coach and Four to Convey it to Town, with more Speed and Safety; and Mr.  _Sheppard_ arriv'd at his old Mansion, at about two in the Afternoon. At  his a-lighting, he made a sudden Spring; He declar'd his Intention was  to have slipt under the Coach, and had a Race for it; he was put into  the Condemn'd-Hold, and Chain'd down to the Floor with double _Basils_  about his Feet, _&c._ _Page_ was carried before Sir _Francis Forbes_ and  committed to the same Prison for Accompanying and aiding _Sheppard_ in  his Escape. The prudence of Mr. _Pitt_ caus'd a Separation between him  and his Brother the first Night, as a Means to prevent any ensuing  Danger, by having two Heads, which (according to our Proverbial Saying)  _are better than one_.    The Joy the People of _Newgate_ conceiv'd on this Occasion is  inexpressible, _Te Deum_ was Sung in the _Lodge_, and nothing but  Smiles, and Bumpers, were seen there for many Days together. But  _Jonathan Wild_ unfortunately happen'd to be gone upon a wrong Scent  after him to _Sturbridge_, and Lost a Share of the Glory.

Hence, in presenting to the public  this system of English Grammar, the author is aware that an apology will  be looked for, and that the arguments on which that apology is grounded,  must inevitably undergo a rigid scrutiny. Apprehensive, however, that no  explanatory effort, on his part, would shield him from the imputation of  arrogance by such as are blinded by self-interest, or by those who are  wedded to the doctrines mid opinions of his predecessors, with _them_ he  will not attempt a compromise, being, in a great measure, indifferent  either to their praise or their censure. But with the candid, he is  willing to negotiate an amicable treaty, knowing that they are always  ready to enter into it on honorable terms. In this negotiation he asks  nothing more than merely to rest the merits of his work on its practical  utility, believing that, if it prove uncommonly successful in  facilitating the progress of youth in the march of mental improvement,  _that_ will be its best apology.    When we bring into consideration the numerous productions of those  learned philologists who have labored so long, and, as many suppose, so  successfully, in establishing the principles of our language; and, more  especially, when we view the labors of some of our modern compilers, who  have displayed so much ingenuity and acuteness in attempting to arrange  those principles in such a manner as to form a correct and an easy  medium of mental conference; it does, indeed, appear a little like  presumption for a young man to enter upon a subject which has so  frequently engaged the attention and talents of men distinguished for  their erudition. The author ventures forward, however, under the  conviction, that most of his predecessors are very deficient, at least,  in _manner,_ if not in _matter_; and this conviction, he believes, will  be corroborated by a majority of the best judges in community. It is  admitted, that many valuable improvements have been made by some of our  late writers, who have endeavored to simplify and render this subject  intelligible to the young learner, but they have all overlooked what the  author considers a very important object, namely, _a systematic order of  parsing;_ and nearly all have neglected to _develop and explain_ the  principles in such a manner as to enable the learner, without great  difficulty, to comprehend their nature and use.    By some this system will, no doubt, be discarded on account of its  _simplicity_; while to others its simplicity will prove its principal  recommendation. Its design is an humble one. It proffers no great  advantages to the recondite grammarian; it professes not to instruct the  literary connoisseur; it presents no attractive graces of style to  charm, no daring flights to astonish, no deep researches to gratify  him; but in the humblest simplicity of diction, it attempts to  accelerate the march of the juvenile mind in its advances in the path of  science, by dispersing those clouds that so often bewilder it, and  removing those obstacles that generally retard its progress. In this way  it endeavors to render interesting and delightful a study which has  hitherto been considered tedious, dry, and irksome. Its leading object  is to adopt a correct and an easy method, in which pleasure is blended  with the labors of the learner, and which is calculated to excite in him  a spirit of inquiry, that shall call forth into vigorous and useful  exercise, every latent energy of his mind; and thus enable him soon to  become thoroughly acquainted with the nature of the principles, and with  their practical utility and application.    Content to be useful, instead of being brilliant, the writer of these  pages has endeavored to shun the path of those whose aim appears to have  been to dazzle, rather than to instruct. As he has aimed not so much at  originality as utility, he has adopted the thoughts of his predecessors  whose labors have become public stock, whenever he could not, in his  opinion, furnish better and brighter of his own. Aware that there is, in  the public mind, a strong predilection for the doctrines contained in  Mr. Murray's grammar, he has thought proper, not merely from motives of  policy, but from choice, to select his _principles_ chiefly from that  work; and, moreover, to adopt, as far as consistent with his own views,  the language of that eminent philologist. In no instance has he varied  from him, unless he conceived that, in so doing, some practical  advantage would be gained. He hopes, therefore, to escape the censure so  frequently and so justly awarded to those unfortunate innovators who  have not scrupled to alter, mutilate, and torture the text of that able  writer, merely to gratify an itching propensity to figure in the world  as authors, and gain an ephemeral popularity by arrogating to themselves  the credit due to another.    The author is not disposed, however, to disclaim all pretensions to  originality; for, although his principles are chiefly selected, (and who  would presume to make new ones?) the manner of arranging, illustrating,  and applying them, is principally his own. Let no one, therefore, if he  happen to find in other works, ideas and illustrations similar to _some_  contained in the following lectures, too hastily accuse him of  plagiarism. It is well known that similar investigations and pursuits  often elicit corresponding ideas in different minds: and hence it is not  uncommon for the same thought to be strictly _original_ with many  writers. The author is not here attempting to manufacture a garment to  shield him from rebuke, should he unjustly claim the property of  another; but he wishes it to be understood, that a long course of  teaching and investigation, has often produced in his mind ideas and  arguments on the subject of grammar, exactly or nearly corresponding  with those which he afterwards found, had, under similar circumstances,  been produced in the minds of others. He hopes, therefore, to be  pardoned by the critic, even though he should not be willing to reject a  good idea _of his own,_ merely because some one else has, at some time  or other, been blessed with the same thought.    As the plan of this treatise is far more comprehensive than those of  ordinary grammars, the writer could not, without making his work  unreasonably voluminous, treat some topics as extensively as was  desirable. Its design is to embrace, not only all the most important  principles of the science, but also exercises in parsing, false syntax,  and punctuation, sufficiently extensive for all ordinary, practical  purposes, and a key to the exercises, and, moreover, a series of  illustrations so full and intelligible, as _completely to adapt the  principles to the capacities of common learners._ Whether this design  has been successfully or unsuccessfully executed, is left for the public  to decide. The general adoption of the work into schools, wherever it  has become known, and the ready sale of _forty thousand_ copies, (though  _without hitherto affording the author any pecuniary profit,_) are  favorable omens.    In the selection and arrangement of principles for his work, the author  has endeavored to pursue a course between the extremes, of taking  blindly on trust whatever has been sanctioned by prejudice and the  authority of venerable names, and of that arrogant, innovating spirit,  which sets at defiance all authority, and attempts to overthrow all  former systems, and convince the world that all true knowledge and  science are wrapped up in a crude system of vagaries of its own  invention. Notwithstanding the author is aware that public prejudice is  powerful, and that he who ventures much by way of innovation, will be  liable to defeat his own purpose by falling into neglect; yet he has  taken the liberty to think for himself, to investigate the subject  critically and dispassionately, and to adopt such principles only as he  deemed the least objectionable, and best calculated to effect the object  he had in view. But what his system claims as improvements on others,  consists not so much in bettering the principles themselves, as in the  _method adopted of communicating a knowledge of them to the mind of the  learner_. That the work is defective, the author is fully sensible: and  he is free to acknowledge, that its defects arise, in part, from his own  want of judgment and skill. But there is another and a more serious  cause of them, namely, the anomalies and imperfections with which the  language abounds. This latter circumstance is also the cause of the  existence of so widely different opinions on many important points; and,  moreover, the reason that the grammatical principles of our language can  never be indisputably settled. But principles ought not to be rejected  because they admit of exceptions.--He who is thoroughly acquainted with  the genius and structure of our language, can duly appreciate the truth  of these remarks.           *       *       *       *       *    Should parents object to the Compendium, fearing it will soon be  destroyed by their children, they are informed that the pupil will not  have occasion to use it one-tenth part as much as he will the book which  it accompanies: and besides, if it be destroyed, he will find all the  definitions and rules which it contains, recapitulated in the series of  Lectures.    HINTS TO TEACHERS AND PRIVATE LEARNERS.    As this work proposes a new mode of parsing, and pursues an arrangement  essentially different from that generally adopted, it may not be deemed  improper for the author to give some directions to those who may be  disposed to use it. Perhaps they who take only a slight view of the  order of parsing, will not consider it _new_, but blend it with those  long since adopted. Some writers have, indeed, attempted plans somewhat  "]]]
