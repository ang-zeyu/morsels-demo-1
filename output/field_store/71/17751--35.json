If possible, it is well to  keep such slops as I have mentioned in a different keg, and draw them  off once in three or four weeks, in such a quantity as you think the  vinegar will bear. If by any carelessness you do weaken it, a few  white beans dropped in, or white paper dipped in molasses, is said  to be useful. If beer grows sour, it may be used to advantage for  pancakes and fritters. If very sour indeed, put a pint of molasses and  water to it, and, two or three days after, put a half pint of vinegar;  and in ten days it will be first rate vinegar.    Barley straw is the best for beds; dry corn husks, slit into shreds,  are far better than straw.    Straw beds are much better for being boxed at the sides; in the same  manner upholsterers prepare ticks for feathers. Brass andirons should  be cleaned, done up in papers, and put in a dry place, during the  summer season.    If you have a large family, it is well to keep white rags separate  from colored ones, and cotton separate from woollen; they bring a  higher price. Paper brings a cent a pound, and if you have plenty of  room, it is well to save it. 'A penny saved is a penny got.'    Always have plenty of dish-water, and have it hot. There is no need  of asking the character of a domestic, if you have ever seen her wash  dishes in a little greasy water. When molasses is used in cooking, it  is a prodigious improvement to boil and skim it before you use it.  It takes out the unpleasant raw taste, and makes it almost as good as  sugar. Where molasses is used much for cooking, it is well to prepare  one or two gallons in this way at a time.    In winter, always set the handle of your pump as high as possible,  before you go to bed. Except in very rigid weather, this keeps the  handle from freezing. When there is reason to apprehend extreme cold,  do not forget to throw a rug or horse-blanket over your pump; a frozen  pump is a comfortless preparation for a winter's breakfast. Never  allow ashes to be taken up in wood, or put into wood. Always have your  tinder-box and lantern ready for use, in case of sudden alarm. Have  important papers all together, where you can lay your hand on them at  once, in case of fire.    Keep an old blanket and sheet on purpose for ironing, and on no  account suffer any other to be used. Have plenty of holders always  made, that your towels may not be burned out in such service.    Keep a coarse broom for the cellar stairs, wood-shed, yard, &c. No  good housekeeper allows her carpet broom to be used for such things.    There should always be a heavy stone on the top of your pork, to keep  it down. This stone is an excellent place to keep a bit of fresh meat  in the summer, when you are afraid of its spoiling.    Have all the good bits of vegetables and meat collected after dinner,  and minced before they are set away; that they may be in readiness  to make a little savoury mince meat for supper or breakfast. Take the  skins off your potatoes before they grow cold.    Vials, which have been used for medicine, should be put into cold  ashes and water, boiled, and suffered to cool before they are rinsed.    If you live in the city, where it is always easy to procure  provisions, be careful and not buy too much for your daily wants,  while the weather is warm.    Never leave out your clothes-line over night; and see that your  clothes-pins are all gathered into a basket.    Have plenty of crash towels in the kitchen; never let your white  napkins be used there.    Soap your dirtiest clothes, and soak them in soft water over night.    Use hard soap to wash your clothes, and soft to wash your floors. Soft  soap is so slippery, that it wastes a good deal in washing clothes.    Instead of covering up your glasses and pictures with muslin, cover  the frames only with cheap, yellow cambric, neatly put on, and as near  the color of the gilt as you can procure it. This looks better; leaves  the glasses open for use, and the pictures for ornament; and is  an effectual barrier to dust as well as flies. It can easily be  re-colored with saffron tea, when it is faded.    Have a bottle full of brandy, with as large a mouth as any bottle you  have, into which cut your lemon and orange peel when they are fresh  and sweet. This brandy gives a delicious flavor to all sorts of  pies, puddings, and cakes. Lemon is the pleasantest spice of the  two; therefore they should be kept in separate bottles. It is a good  plan to preserve rose-leaves in brandy. The flavor is pleasanter  than rose-water; and there are few people who have the utensils for  distilling. Peach leaves steeped in brandy make excellent spice for  custards and puddings.    It is easy to have a supply of horse-radish all winter. Have a  quantity grated, while the root is in perfection, put it in bottles,  fill it with strong vinegar, and keep it corked tight.    It is thought to be a preventive to the unhealthy influence of  cucumbers to cut the slices very thin, and drop each one into cold  water as you cut it. A few minutes in the water takes out a large  portion of the slimy matter, so injurious to health. They should be  eaten with high seasoning.    Where sweet oil is much used, it is more economical to buy it by the  bottle than by the flask. A bottle holds more than twice as much as a  flask, and it is never double the price.    If you wish to have free-stone hearths dark, wash them with soap, and  wipe them with a wet cloth; some people rub in lamp-oil, once in a  while, and wash the hearth faithfully afterwards. This does very well  in a large, dirty family; for the hearth looks very clean, and is not  liable to show grease spots. But if you wish to preserve the beauty  of a freestone hearth, buy a quantity of free-stone powder of the  stone-cutter, and rub on a portion of it wet, after you have washed  your hearth in hot water. When it is dry, brush it off, and it will  look like new stone. Bricks can be kept clean with redding stirred up  in water, and put on with a brush. Pulverized clay mixed with redding,  makes a pretty rose color. Some think it is less likely to come  off, if mixed with skim milk instead of water. But black lead is far  handsomer than anything else for this purpose. It looks very well  mixed with water, like redding; but it gives it a glossy appearance  to boil the lead in soft soap, with a little water to keep it from  burning. It should be put on with a brush, in the same manner as  redding; it looks nice for a long time, when done in this way.    Keep a bag for odd pieces of tape and strings; they will come in use.  Keep a bag or box for old buttons, so that you may know where to go  when you want one.    Run the heels of stockings faithfully; and mend thin places, as well  as holes. 'A stitch in time saves nine.'    Poke-root, boiled in water and mixed with a good quantity of molasses,  set about the kitchen, the pantry, &c. in large deep plates, will kill  cockroaches in great numbers, and finally rid the house of them. The  Indians say that poke-root boiled into a soft poultice is the cure for  the bite of a snake. I have heard of a fine horse saved by it.    A little salt sprinkled in starch while it is boiling, tends to  prevent it from sticking; it is likewise good to stir it with a clean  spermaceti candle.    A few potatoes sliced, and boiling water poured over them, makes an  excellent preparation for cleansing and stiffening old rusty black  silk.    Green tea is excellent to restore rusty silk. It should be boiled in  iron, nearly a cup full to three quarts. The silk should not be wrung,  and should be ironed damp.    Lime pulverized, sifted through coarse muslin, and stirred up  tolerably thick in white of eggs, makes a strong cement for glass  and china. Plaster of Paris is still better; particularly for mending  broken images of the same material. It should be stirred up by the  spoonful, as it is wanted.[2]    [Footnote 2: Some think it an improvement to make whey of vinegar and  milk, and heat it well up with the eggs before the lime is put in. I  have heard of iron mended with it.]    A bit of isinglass dissolved in gin, or boiled in spirits of wine, is  said to make strong cement for broken glass, china, and sea-shells.    The lemon syrup, usually sold at fifty cents a bottle, may be made  much cheaper. Those who use a great quantity of it will find it worth  their while to make it. Take about a pound of Havana sugar; boil it  in water down to a quart; drop in the white of an egg, to clarify it;  strain it; add one quarter of an oz. of tartaric acid, or citric acid;  if you do not find it sour enough, after it has stood two or three  days and shaken freely, add more of the acid. A few drops of the oil  of lemon improves it.    If you wish to clarify sugar and water, you are about to boil, it is  well to stir in the white of one egg, while cold; if put in after it  boils, the egg is apt to get hardened before it can do any good.    Those who are fond of soda powders will do well to inquire at the  apothecaries for the suitable acid and alkali, and buy them by  the ounce, or the pound, according to the size of their families.  Experience soon teaches the right proportions; and, sweetened with  a little sugar or lemon syrup, it is quite as good as what one gives  five times as much for, done up in papers. The case is the same with  Rochelle powders.    When the stopper of a glass decanter becomes too tight, a cloth  wet with hot water and applied to the neck, will cause the glass to  expand, so that the stopper may be easily removed.    Glass vessels in a cylindrical form, may be cut in two, by tying  around them a worsted thread, thoroughly wet with spirits of  turpentine, and then setting fire to the thread. Court plaster is  made of thin silk first dipped in dissolved isinglass and dried, then  dipped several"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13499"],[0,"Two Little Savages (#4)"],[1,"t's the bird ye ha' just seen; that's the Cock Partridge drumming  for his mate.\"    The Pewee of his early memories became the Phoebe of books. That day  his brookside singer became the Song-sparrow; the brown triller, the  Veery Thrush. The Trilliums, white and red, the Dogtooth Violet, the  Spring-beauty, the Trailing Arbutus--all for the first time got  names and became real friends, instead of elusive and beautiful, but  depressing mysteries.    The stranger warmed, too, and his rugged features glowed; he saw in  Yan one minded like himself, tormented with the knowledge-hunger, as  in youth he himself had been; and now it was a priceless privilege to  save the boy some of what he had suffered. His gratitude to Yan grew  fervid, and Yan--he took in every word; nothing that he heard was  forgotten. He was in a dream, for he had found at last the greatest  thing on earth--sympathy--broad, intelligent, comprehensive sympathy.    That spring morning was ever after like a new epoch in Yan's mind--not  his memory, that was a thing of the past--but in his mind, his living  present.    And the strongest, realest thing in it all was, not the rugged  stranger with his kind ways, not the new birds and plants, but the  smell of the Wintergreen.    Smell's appeal to the memory is far better, stronger, more real than  that of any other sense. The Indians know this; many of them, in time,  find out the smell that conjures up their happiest hours, and keep it  by them in the medicine bag. It is very real and dear to them--that  handful of Pine needles, that lump of Rat-musk, or that piece of  Spruce gum. It adds the crown of happy memory to their reveries.    And yet this belief is one of the first attacked by silly White-men,  who profess to enlighten the Red-man's darkness. They, in their  ignorance, denounce it as absurd, while men of science know its simple  truth.    Yan did not know that he had stumbled on a secret of the Indian  medicine bag. But ever afterward that wonderful day was called back to  him, conjured up by his \"medicine,\" this simple, natural magic, the  smell of the Wintergreen.    He appreciated that morning more than he could tell, and yet he did a  characteristic foolish thing, that put him in a wrong light and left  him so in the stranger's mind.    It was past noon. They had long lingered; the Stranger spoke of the  many things he had at home; then at length said he must be going.  \"Weel, good-by, laddie; Ah hope Ah'll see you again.\" He held out his  hand. Yan shook it warmly; but he was dazed with thinking and with  reaction; his diffidence and timidity were strong; he never rose to  the stranger's veiled offer. He let him go without even learning his  name or address.    When it was too late, Yan awoke to his blunder. He haunted all those  woods in hopes of chancing on him there again, but he never did.          VI    Glenyan      Oh! what a song the Wild Geese sang that year! How their trumpet clang  went thrilling in his heart, to smite there new and hidden chords that  stirred and sang response. Was there ever a nobler bird than that  great black-necked Swan, that sings not at his death, but in his flood  of life, a song of home and of peace--of stirring deeds and hunting  in far-off climes--of hungerings and food, and raging thirsts to meet  with cooling drink. A song of wind and marching, a song of bursting  green and grinding ice--of Arctic secrets and of hidden ways. A song  of a long black marsh, a low red sky, and a sun that never sets.    An Indian jailed for theft bore bravely through the winter, but when  the springtime brought the Gander-clang in the black night sky, he  started, fell, and had gone to his last, long, hunting home.    Who can tell why Jericho should fall at the trumpet blast?    Who can read or measure the power of the Honker-song?    Oh, what a song the Wild Geese sang that year! And yet, was it a new  song? No, the old, old song, but Yan heard it with new ears. He was  learning to read its message. He wandered on their trailless track, as  often as he could, northward, ever northward, up the river from the  town, and up, seeking the loneliest ways and days. The river turned to  the east, but a small stream ran into it from the north: up that Yan  went through thickening woods and walls that neared each other, on and  up until the walls closed to a crack, then widened out into a little  dale that was still full of original forest trees. Hemlock, Pine,  Birch and Elm of the largest size abounded and spread over the clear  brook a continuous shade. Fox vines trailed in the open places, the  rarest wild-flowers flourished, Red-squirrels chattered from the  trees. In the mud along the brook-side were tracks of Coon and Mink  and other strange fourfoots. And in the trees overhead, the Veery, the  Hermit-thrush, or even a Woodthrush sang his sweetly solemn strain, in  that golden twilight of the midday forest. Yan did not know them all  by name as yet, but he felt their vague charm and mystery. It seemed  such a far and lonely place, so unspoiled by man, that Yan persuaded  himself that surely he was the first human being to stand there, that  it was his by right of discovery, and so he claimed it and named it  after its discoverer--Glenyan.    This place became the central thought in his life. He went there at  all opportunities, but never dared to tell any one of his discovery.  He longed for a confidant sometimes, he hankered to meet the stranger  and take him there, and still he feared that the secret would get out.  This was his little kingdom; the Wild Geese had brought him here, as  the Seagulls had brought Columbus to a new world--where he could lead,  for brief spells, the woodland life that was his ideal. He was tender  enough to weep over the downfall of a lot of fine Elm trees in town,  when their field was sold for building purposes, and he used to suffer  a sort of hungry regret when old settlers told how plentiful the Deer  used to be. But now he had a relief from these sorrows, for surely  there was one place where the great trees should stand and grow as in  the bright bygone; where the Coon, the Mink and the Partridge should  live and flourish forever. No, indeed, no one else should know of it,  for if the secret got out, at least hosts of visitors would come and  Glenyan be defiled. No, better that the secret should \"die with him,\"  he said. What that meant he did not really know, but he had read the  phrase somewhere and he liked the sound of it. Possibly he would  reveal it on his deathbed.    Yes, that was the proper thing, and he pictured a harrowing scene of  weeping relatives around, himself as central figure, all ceasing their  wailing and gasping with wonder as he made known the mighty secret of  his life--delicious! it was almost worth dying for.    So he kept the place to himself and loved it more and more. He would  look out through the thick Hemlock tops, the blots of Basswood green  or the criss-cross Butternut leafage and say: \"My own, my own.\" Or  down by some pool in the limpid stream he would sit and watch the  arrowy Shiners and say: \"You are mine, all; you are mine. You shall  never be harmed or driven away.\"    A spring came from the hillside by a green lawn, and here Yan would  eat his sandwiches varied with nuts and berries that he did not like,  but ate only because he was a wildman, and would look lovingly up the  shady brookland stretches and down to the narrow entrance of the glen,  and say and think and feel. \"This is mine, my own, my very own.\"          VII    The Shanty      He had none but the poorest of tools, but he set about building a  shanty. He was not a resourceful boy. His effort to win the book  had been an unusual one for him, as his instincts were not at all  commercial. When that matter came to the knowledge of the Home  Government, he was rebuked for doing \"work unworthy of a gentleman's  son\" and forbidden under frightful penalties \"ever again to resort to  such degrading ways of raising money.\"    They gave him no money, so he was penniless. Most boys would have  possessed themselves somehow of a good axe and spade. He had neither.  An old plane blade, fastened to a stick with nails, was all the axe  and spade he had, yet with this he set to work and offset its poorness  as a tool by dogged persistency. First, he selected the quietest  spot near the spring--a bank hidden by a mass of foliage. He knew no  special reason for hiding it, beyond the love of secrecy. He had  read in some of his books \"how the wily scouts led the way through a  pathless jungle, pulled aside a bough and there revealed a comfortable  dwelling that none without the secret could possibly have discovered,\"  so it seemed very proper to make it a complete mystery--a sort of  secret panel in the enchanted castle--and so picture himself as the  wily scout leading his wondering companions to the shanty, though, of  course, he had not made up his mind to reveal his secret to any one.  He often wished he could have the advantage of Rad's strong arms and  efficacious tools; but the workshop incident was only one of many that  taught him to leave his brother out of all calculation.    Mother Earth is the best guardian of a secret, and Yan with his crude  spade began by digging a hole in the bank. The hard blue clay made the  work slow, but two holidays spent in steady labour resulted in a hole  seven feet wide and about four feet into the bank.    In this he set about building the shanty. Logs seven or eight feet  long must be got to the place--at least twenty-five or thirty would  be needed, and how to cut and handle them with his poor axe was a  question. Somehow, he never looked for a better axe. The half-formed  notion that the Indians had no better was sufficient support, and he  struggled away bravely, using whatever ready sized material he could  find. Each piece as he brought it was put into place. Some boys would  have gathered the"]]]
