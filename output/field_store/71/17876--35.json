Getting  here to Linrock, meeting Steele had not changed my feelings toward her,  only somehow they had removed me far off in thought, out of possible  touch, it seemed.    \"Well, son, listen,\" began Steele. His calling me that was a joke, yet I  did not feel it. \"You've made a better start than I could have figured.  Neal said you were lucky. Perhaps. But you've got brains.    \"Now, here's your cue for the present. Work for Miss Sampson. Do your  best for her as long as you last. I don't suppose you'll last long. You  have got to get in with this gang in town. Be a flash cowboy. You don't  need to get drunk, but you're to pretend it.    \"Gamble. Be a good fellow. Hang round the barrooms. I don't care how you  play the part, so long as you make friends, learn the ropes. We can meet  out here at nights to talk and plan.    \"You're to take sides with those who're against me. I'll furnish you  with the money. You'd better appear to be a winning gambler, even if  you're not. How's this plan strike you?\"    \"Great--except for one thing,\" I replied. \"I hate to lie to Miss  Sampson. She's true blue, Steele.\"    \"Son, you haven't got soft on her?\"    \"Not a bit. Maybe I'm soft on the little cousin. But I just like Miss  Sampson--think she's fine--could look up to her. And I hate to be  different from what she thinks.\"    \"I understand, Russ,\" he replied in his deep voice that had such quality  to influence a man. \"It's no decent job. You'll be ashamed before her.  So would I. But here's our work, the hardest ever cut out for Rangers.  Think what depends upon it. And--\"    \"There's something wrong with Miss Sampson's father,\" I interrupted.    \"Something strange if not wrong. No man in this community is beyond us,  Russ, or above suspicion. You've a great opportunity. I needn't say use  your eyes and ears as never before.\"    \"I hope Sampson turns out to be on the square,\" I replied. \"He might be  a lax mayor, too good-natured to uphold law in a wild country. And his  Southern pride would fire at interference. I don't like him, but for his  daughter's sake I hope we're wrong.\"    Steele's eyes, deep and gleaming in the moonlight, searched my face.    \"Son, sure you're not in love with her--you'll not fall in love with  her?\"    \"No. I am positive. Why?\"    \"Because in either case I'd likely have need of a new man in your  place,\" he said.    \"Steele, you know something about Sampson--something more!\" I exclaimed  swiftly.    \"No more than you. When I meet him face to face I may know more. Russ,  when a fellow has been years at this game he has a sixth sense. Mine  seldom fails me. I never yet faced the criminal who didn't somehow  betray fear--not so much fear of me, but fear of himself--his life, his  deeds. That's conscience, or if not, just realization of fate.\"    Had that been the thing I imagined I had seen in Sampson's face?    \"I'm sorry Diane Sampson came out here,\" I said impulsively.    Steele did not say he shared that feeling. He was looking out upon the  moon-blanched level.    Some subtle thing in his face made me divine that he was thinking of the  beautiful girl to whom he might bring disgrace and unhappiness.          Chapter 2    A KISS AND AN ARREST      A month had passed, a swift-flying time full of new life. Wonderful it  was for me to think I was still in Diane Sampson's employ.    It was the early morning hour of a day in May. The sun had not yet grown  hot. Dew like diamond drops sparkled on the leaves and grass. The gentle  breeze was clear, sweet, with the song of larks upon it.    And the range, a sea of gray-green growing greener, swept away westward  in rolling ridges and hollows, like waves to meet the dark, low hills  that notched the horizon line of blue.    I was sitting on the top bar of the corral fence and before me stood  three saddled horses that would have gladdened any eye. I was waiting  to take the young ladies on their usual morning ride.    Once upon a time, in what seemed the distant past to this eventful  month, I had flattered myself there had been occasions for thought, but  scornfully I soliloquized that in those days I had no cue for thought  such as I had now.    This was one of the moments when my real self seemed to stand off and  skeptically regard the fictitious cowboy.    This gentleman of the range wore a huge sombrero with an ornamented  silver band, a silken scarf of red, a black velvet shirt, much affected  by the Indians, an embroidered buckskin vest, corduroys, and fringed  chaps with silver buttons, a big blue gun swinging low, high heeled  boots, and long spurs with silver rowels.    A flash cowboy! Steele vowed I was a born actor.    But I never divulged the fact that had it not been for my infatuation  for Sally, I never could have carried on that part, not to save the  Ranger service, or the whole State of Texas.    The hardest part had not been the establishing of a reputation. The  scorn of cowboys, the ridicule of gamblers, the badinage of the young  bucks of the settlement--these I had soon made dangerous procedures for  any one. I was quick with tongue and fist and gun.    There had been fights and respect was quickly earned, though the  constant advent of strangers in Linrock always had me in hot water.    Moreover, instead of being difficult, it was fun to spend all the time  I could in the hotels and resorts, shamming a weakness for drink,  gambling, lounging, making friends among the rough set, when all the  time I was a cool, keen registering machine.    The hard thing was the lie I lived in the eyes of Diane Sampson and  Sally Langdon.    I had indeed won the sincere regard of my employer. Her father, her  cousin George, and new-made friends in town had come to her with tales  of my reckless doings, and had urged my dismissal.    But she kept me and all the time pleaded like a sister to have me mend  my vicious ways. She believed what she was told about me, but had faith  in me despite that.    As for Sally, I had fallen hopelessly in love with her. By turns Sally  was indifferent to me, cold, friendly like a comrade, and dangerously  sweet.    Somehow she saw through me, knew I was not just what I pretended to be.  But she never breathed her conviction. She championed me. I wanted to  tell her the truth about myself because I believed the doubt of me alone  stood in the way of my winning her.    Still that might have been my vanity. She had never said she cared for  me although she had looked it.    This tangle of my personal life, however, had not in the least affected  my loyalty and duty to Vaughn Steele. Day by day I had grown more  attached to him, keener in the interest of our work.    It had been a busy month--a month of foundation building. My vigilance  and my stealthy efforts had not been rewarded by anything calculated to  strengthen our suspicions of Sampson. But then he had been absent from  the home very often, and was difficult to watch when he was there.    George Wright came and went, too, presumably upon stock business. I  could not yet see that he was anything but an honest rancher, deeply  involved with Sampson and other men in stock deals; nevertheless, as a  man he had earned my contempt.    He was a hard drinker, cruel to horses, a gambler not above stacking the  cards, a quick-tempered, passionate Southerner.    He had fallen in love with Diane Sampson, was like her shadow when at  home. He hated me; he treated me as if I were the scum of the earth; if  he had to address me for something, which was seldom, he did it harshly,  like ordering a dog. Whenever I saw his sinister, handsome face, with  its dark eyes always half shut, my hand itched for my gun, and I would  go my way with something thick and hot inside my breast.    In my talks with Steele we spent time studying George Wright's character  and actions. He was Sampson's partner, and at the head of a small group  of Linrock ranchers who were rich in cattle and property, if not in  money.    Steele and I had seen fit to wait before we made any thorough  investigation into their business methods. Ours was a waiting game,  anyway.    Right at the start Linrock had apparently arisen in resentment at the  presence of Vaughn Steele. But it was my opinion that there were men in  Linrock secretly glad of the Ranger's presence.    What he intended to do was food for great speculation. His fame, of  course, had preceded him. A company of militia could not have had the  effect upon the wild element of Linrock that Steele's presence had.    A thousand stories went from lip to lip, most of which were false. He  was lightning swift on the draw. It was death to face him. He had killed  thirty men--wildest rumor of all.    He had the gun skill of Buck Duane, the craft of Cheseldine, the  deviltry of King Fisher, the most notorious of Texas desperadoes. His  nerve, his lack of fear--those made him stand out alone even among a  horde of bold men.    At first there had not only been great conjecture among the vicious  element, with which I had begun to affiliate myself, but also a very  decided checking of all kinds of action calculated to be conspicuous to  a keen eyed Ranger.    Steele did not hide, but during these opening days of his stay in  Linrock he was not often seen in town. At the tables, at the bars and  lounging places remarks went the rounds:    \"Who's thet Ranger after? What'll he do fust off? Is he waitin' fer  somebody? Who's goin' to draw on him fust--an' go to hell? Jest about  how soon will he be found somewhere full of lead?\"    Those whom it was my interest to cultivate grew more curious, more  speculative and impatient as time went by. When it leaked out somewhere  that Steele was openly cultivating the honest stay-at-home citizens, to  array them in time against the other element, then Linrock showed its  wolf teeth hinted of in the letters to Captain Neal.    Several times Steele"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15586"],[0,"India, Old and New (#4)"],[1,"of the  boon which he had been sent out by the King-Emperor to confer on the  people of India.    Must we then be driven to the conclusion that there is a gulf never to  be bridged between India's ancient civilisation and the modern  civilisation which we have brought to her out of the West? In that case  the great constitutional adventure on which we have just embarked would  be, unlike all our other great adventures in India, foredoomed to  failure, and those Englishmen would be right who shudder at its rashness  and reiterate with added conviction, since the school of Indian thought  for which Mr. Gandhi stands seems to bear them out, that \"East is East  and West is West, and never the twain shall meet.\" The whole history of  the British connection with India surely excludes such a conclusion of  failure and despair. It teaches us, not, as such Englishmen contend,  that India was won and has been held and must be retained by the sword  alone, but that British rule was established and has been maintained  with and by the co-operation of Indians and British, and that in seeking  to-day to associate Indians more closely than ever before with the  government and administration of the country, we are merely persevering  in the same path which, though at times hesitatingly and reluctantly,  the British rulers of India have trodden for generations past, always  keeping step with the successive stages of our own national and  political evolution. The Indian extremists misread equally the whole  history of British rule who see in it nothing but a long nightmare of  hateful oppression to be finally overcome, according to Mr. Gandhi's  preaching, by \"Non-co-operation\" and the immortal \"soul force\" of India,  rescued at last from the paralysing snares of an alien civilisation. Not  for the first time has the cry of \"Back to the Vedas\" been raised by  Indians who, standing in the old ways, watch with hostility and alarm  the impact on their ancient but static civilisation of the more dynamic  civilisation of the West with which we for the first time brought India  into contact. It would be folly to underrate the resistance which the  reactionary elements in Hinduism are still capable of putting forth. I  have shown how it can still be seen operating in extreme forms, and not  upon Hindus alone, in the two pictures which I have drawn from Delhi and  Calcutta. It meets one in a lesser degree at almost every turn all over  India. But it would be just as foolish to underrate the progressive  forces which show now as ever in the history of Hinduism, that it is  also capable of combining with a singular rigidity of structure and with  many forms repugnant to all our own beliefs a breadth and elasticity of  thought by no means inferior to that of the West.    To those who hoped for a more rapid and widespread fusion of Indian and  Western ideals, some of the phenomena which have marked the latter-day  revival of Hinduism and the shape it has recently assumed in Mr.  Gandhi's \"Non-co-operation\" campaign, may have brought grave  disappointment. But the inrush of Western influences was assuredly bound  to provoke a strong reaction. For let us not forget that to the abiding  power of Hinduism India owes the one great element of stability that  enabled her, long before we appeared in India, to weather so many  tremendous storms without altogether losing the sense of a great  underlying unity stronger and more enduring than all the manifold lines  of cleavage which have tended from times immemorial to divide her.  Hinduism has not only responded for some forty centuries to the social  and religious aspirations of a large and highly endowed portion of the  human race, almost wholly shut off until modern times from any intimate  contact with our own Western world, but it has been the one great force  that has preserved the continuity of Indian life. It withstood six  centuries of Mahomedan domination. Could it be expected to yield without  a struggle to the new forces, however superior we may consider them and  however overwhelming they may ultimately prove, which British rule has  imported into India during a period of transition more momentous than  any other through which she has ever passed, but still very brief when  compared with all those other periods of Indian history which modern  research has only recently rescued from the legendary obscurity of still  earlier ages?    We are witnessing to-day a new phase of this great struggle, the clash  of conflicting elements in two great civilisations. A constitution has  been inaugurated at Delhi to bring India into permanent and equal  partnership with a commonwealth of free nations which is the greatest  political achievement of Western civilisation, and the latest prophet of  Hinduism, applying to it the language of the West, has banned it  forthwith as a thing of Satan, the offspring of a Satanic government and  of a Satanic civilisation. His appeal to India is intended to strike  many and various chords, but it is essentially an appeal to the ancient  forces of Hinduism which gave India a great civilisation long before  Europe, and least of all Britain, had emerged from the savagery of  primitive man. Englishmen find it difficult to understand the strength  of that appeal, perhaps because they do not realise how deep and vital  are the roots of the civilisation to which it appeals.          CHAPTER II    THE ENDURING POWER OF HINDUISM      India's civilisation, intimately bound up from its birth with the great  social and religious system which we call Hinduism, is as unique as it  is ancient. Its growth and its tenacity are largely due to the  geographical position of a great and populous sub-continent, on its land  side exposed only to incursions from the north through mountainous and  desolate regions, everywhere difficult of access and in some parts  impenetrable, and shut in on the other two sides of a roughly isosceles  triangle by broad expanses of sea which cut it off from all direct  intercourse with the West until, towards the close of the Middle Ages,  European navigators opened up new ocean highways to the East. India owes  her own peculiar civilisation to the gradual fusion of Aryan races of a  higher type that began to flow down from Central Asia before the dawn of  history upon the more primitive indigenous populations already in  possession. Its early history has only now begun to emerge from the  twilight of myths and legends, and cannot even now be traced with any  assurance of accuracy nearly as far back as that of other parts of the  world which preceded or gave birth to our own much more recent  civilisation. The pyramids of Ghizeh and Sakkara and the monumental  temples of Thebes bore ample witness to the greatness of Egyptian  civilisation long before the interpretation of her hieroglyphics enabled  us to determine its antiquity, and the discovery of its abundant art  treasures revealed the high degree of culture to which it reached.  Excavations in the valley of the Tigris and Euphrates have yielded an  almost equally valuable harvest in regard to Babylonian and Assyrian  civilisation, and Cnossus has told us its scarcely less wonderful story.  Yet the long line of Pharaohs was coming to an end and Egypt was losing  the national independence which she has never once recovered; Nineveh  had fallen and Jerusalem was destroyed; Greece and even Rome had already  started on their great creative careers before any approximately correct  date can be assigned to the stages through which Indian civilisation had  passed. India only becomes historical with the establishment of the  Sasunaga dynasty in the Gangetic kingdom of Magadha, which centred in  what is now Behar, about the year 600 B.C.    As to the state of India before that date, no sort of material evidence  has survived, or at any rate has yet been brought to light--no  monuments, no inscriptions, very little pottery even, in fact very few  traces of the handicraft of man; nor any contemporary records of  undoubted authenticity. Fortunately the darkness which would have been  otherwise Cimmerian is illuminated, though with a partial and often  uncertain light, by the wonderful body of sacred literature which has  been handed down to our own times in the Vedas and Brahmanas and  Upanishads. To none of these books, which have, for the most part,  reached us in various recensions often showing considerable  discrepancies and obviously later interpolations, is it possible to  ascribe any definite date. But in them we undoubtedly possess a genuine  key to the religious thought and social conceptions, and even  inferentially to the political institutions of the Aryan Hindus through  the many centuries that rolled by between their first southward  migrations into the Indian peninsula and their actual emergence into  history. The Vedic writings constitute the most ancient documents  available to illustrate the growth of religious beliefs founded on pure  Nature-worship, which translated themselves into a polytheistic and  pantheistic idea of the universe and, in spite of many subsequent  transformations, are found to contain all the germs of modern Hinduism  as we know it to-day--and, indeed, of all the religious thought of  India. In the Vedic hymns Nature itself is divine, and their pantheon  consists of the deified forces of Nature, worshipped now as Agni, the  god of Fire; Soma, the god and the elixir of life; Indra, the god of  heaven and the national god of the Aryans; and again, under more  abstract forms, such as Prajapati, the lord of creation, Asura, the  great spirit, Brahmanaspati, the lord of prayer; and sometimes, again,  gathered together into the transcendent majesty of one all-absorbing  divinity, such as Varuna, whose pre-eminence almost verges on  monotheism. But the general impression left on the Western mind is of a  fantastic kaleidoscope, in which hundreds and even thousands of"]]]
