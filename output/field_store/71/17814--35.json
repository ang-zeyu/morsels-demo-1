Pictet's argument is that the human mind must  have advanced from the simple to the complex! Even Roth believes in an  originally \"supreme deity\" of the Aryans.[16] Opposed to this, the  'naive' school of such older scholars as Roth, Mueller,[17] and  Grassmann, who see in the Rig Veda an ingenuous expression of  'primitive' ideas, stand the theories of Bergaigne, who interprets  everything allegorically; and of Pischel and Geldner, realists, whose  general opinions may thus be formulated: The poets of the Rig Veda are  not childlike and naive; they represent a comparatively late period of  culture, a society not only civilized, but even sophisticated; a mode  of thought philosophical and sceptical a religion not only ceremonious  but absolutely stereotyped. In regard to the Aryanhood of the hymns,  the stand taken by these latter critics, who renounce even Bergaigne's  slight hold on mythology, is that the Rig Veda is thoroughly Indic. It  is to be explained by the light of the formal Hindu ritualism, and  even by epic worldliness, its fresh factors being lewd gods, harlots,  and race-horses. Bloomfield, who does not go so far as this, claims  that the 'Vedic' age really is a Brahmanic age; that Vedic religion is  saturated with Brahmanic ideas and Brahmanic formalism, so that the  Rig Veda ought to be looked upon as made for the ritual, not the  ritual regarded as ancillary to the Rig Veda[18]. This scholar  maintains that there is scarcely any chronological distinction between  the hymns of the Rig Veda and the Br[=a]hmana, both forms having  probably existed together \"from earliest times\"; and that not a single  Vedic hymn \"was ever composed without reference to ritual  application\"; nay, all the hymns were \"liturgical from the very  start\"[19]. This is a plain advance even on Bergaigne's opinion, who  finally regarded all the family-books of the Rig Veda as composed to  subserve the _soma_-cult.[20]    In the Rig Veda occur hymns of an entirely worldly character, the  lament of a gambler, a humorous description of frogs croaking like  priests, a funny picture of contemporary morals [describing how every  one lusts after wealth], and so forth. From these alone it becomes  evident that the ritualistic view must be regarded as one somewhat  exaggerated. But if the liturgical extremist appears to have stepped a  little beyond the boundary of probability, he yet in daring remains  far behind Bergaigne's disciple Regnaud, who has a mystical 'system,'  which is, indeed, the outcome of Bergaigne's great work, though it is  very improbable that the latter would have looked with favor upon his  follower's results. In _Le Rig Veda_ [Paris, 1892] Paul Regnaud,  emphasizing again the connection between the liturgy and the hymns,  refers every word of the Rig Veda to the sacrifice in its simplest  form, the oblation. According to this author the Hindus had forgotten  the meaning of their commonest words, or consistently employed them in  their hymns in a meaning different to that in ordinary use. The very  word for god, _deva_ [deus], no longer means the 'shining one' [the  god], but the 'burning oblation'; the common word for mountain,  _giri_ also means oblation, and so on. This is Bergaigne's allegorical  mysticism run mad.    At such perversion of reasonable criticism is the exegesis of the Veda  arrived in one direction. But in another it is gone astray no less, as  misdirected by its clever German leader. In three volumes[21]  Brunnhofer has endeavored to prove that far from being a Brahmanic  product, the Rig Veda is not even the work of Hindus; that it was  composed near the Caspian Sea long before the Aryans descended into  India. Brunnhofer's books are a mine of ingenious conjectures, as  suggestive in detail as on the whole they are unconvincing. His  fundamental error is the fancy that names and ideas which might be  Iranian or Turanian would prove, if such they really could be shown to  be, that the work in which they are contained must be Iranian or  Turanian. He relies in great measure on passages that always have been  thought to be late, either whole late hymns or tags added to old  hymns, and on the most daring changes in the text, changes which he  makes in order to prove his hypothesis, although there is no necessity  for making them. The truth that underlies Brunnhofer's extravagance is  that there are foreign names in the Rig Veda, and this is all that he  has proved thus far.    In regard to the relation between the Veda and the Avesta the  difference of views is too individual to have formed systems of  interpretation on that basis alone. Every competent scholar recognizes  a close affinity between the Iranian Yima and the Hindu Yama, between  the _soma_-cult and the _haoma_-cult, but in how far the thoughts and  forms that have clustered about one development are to be compared  with those of the other there is no general agreement and there can be  none. The usual practice, however, is to call the Iranian _Yima,  haoma_, etc., to one's aid if they subserve one's own view of _Yama,  soma,_ and other Hindu parallels, and to discard analogous features as  an independent growth if they do not. This procedure is based as well  on the conditions of the problem as on the conditions of human  judgment, and must not be criticized too severely; for in fact the two  religions here and there touch each other so nearly that to deny a  relation between them is impossible, while in detail they diverge so  widely that it is always questionable whether a coincidence of ritual  or belief be accidental or imply historical connection.    It is scarcely advisable in a concise review of several religions to  enter upon detailed criticism of the methods of interpretation that  affect for the most part only the earliest of them. But on one point,  the reciprocal relations between the Vedic and Brahmanic periods, it  is necessary to say a few words. Why is it that well-informed Vedic  scholars differ so widely in regard to the ritualistic share in the  making of the Veda? Because the extremists on either side in  formulating the principles of their system forget a fact that probably  no one of them if questioned would fail to acknowledge. The Rig Veda  is not a homogeneous whole. It is a work which successive generations  have produced, and in which are represented different views, of local  or sectarian origin; while the hymns from a literary point of view are  of varying value. The latter is a fact which has been ignored  frequently, but it is more important than any other. For one has  almost no criteria, with which to discover whether the hymns precede  or follow the ritual, other than the linguistic posteriority of the  ritualistic literature, and the knowledge that there were priests with  a ritual when some of the hymns were composed. The bare fact that  hymns are found rubricated in the later literature is surely no reason  for believing that such hymns were made for the ritual. Now while it  can be shown that a large number of hymns are formal, conventional,  and mechanical in expression, and while it may be argued with  plausibility that these were composed to serve the purpose of an  established cult, this is very far from being the case with many  which, on other grounds, may be supposed to belong severally to the  older and later part of the Rig Veda. Yet does the new school, in  estimating the hymns, never admit this. The poems always are spoken of  as 'sacerdotal', ritualistic, without the slightest attempt to see  whether this be true of all or of some alone. We claim that it is not  historical, it is not judicious from a literary point of view, to  fling indiscriminately together the hymns that are evidently  ritualistic and those of other value; for, finally, it is a sober  literary judgment that is the court of appeals in regard to whether  poetry be poetry or not. Now let one take a hymn containing, to make  it an unexceptionable example, nothing very profound or very  beautiful. It is this well-known      HYMN TO THE SUN (_Rig Veda_, I. 50).      Aloft this all-wise[22] shining god    His beams of light are bearing now,    That every one the sun may see.      Apart, as were they thieves, yon stars,    Together with the night[23], withdraw    Before the sun, who seeth all.      His beams of light have been beheld    Afar, among [all] creatures; rays    Splendid as were they [blazing] fires,      Impetuous-swift, beheld of all,    Of light the maker, thou, O Sun,    Thou all the gleaming [sky] illum'st.      Before the folk of shining gods    Thou risest up, and men before,    'Fore all--to be as light beheld;      [To be] thine eye, O pure bright Heaven,    Wherewith amid [all] creatures born    Thou gazest down on busy [man].      Thou goest across the sky's broad place,    Meting with rays, O Sun, the days,    And watching generations pass.      The steeds are seven that at thy car    Bear up the god whose hair is flame    O shining god, O Sun far-seen!      Yoked hath he now his seven fair steeds,    The daughters of the sun-god's car,    Yoked but by him[24]; with these he comes.    For some thousands of years these verses have been the daily prayer of  the Hindu. They have been incorporated into the ritual in this form.  They are rubricated, and the nine stanzas form part of a prescribed  service. But, surely, it were a literary hysteron-proteron to conclude  for this reason that they were made only to fill a part in an  established ceremony.    The praise is neither perfunctory nor lacking in a really religious  tone. It has a directness and a simplicity, without affectation, which  would incline one to believe that it was not made mechanically, but  composed with a devotional spirit that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14515"],[0,"The Nervous Child (#4)"],[1,"sensation. By  constant practice the sense of touch and the precision of the movement  of his hands are slowly developed, and not these alone, for the child  in acquiring these powers has developed also the centres in the brain  which control the voluntary movements. When the child can walk he  continues these grasping and touching exercises in a wider sphere. As  the child of fifteen or eighteen months moves about the room, no  object within his reach is passed by. He stretches out his hand to  touch and seize upon everything, and to experience the joy of  imparting motion to it. The impulse to develop tactile sensation and  precision in the movements of his hands compels him with irresistible  force. It is foolish to attempt to repress it. It is foolish, because  it is a necessary phase in his development, and moreover a passing  phase. No doubt it is annoying to his elders while it lasts, but the  only wise course is to try to thwart as little as we can his  legitimate desire to hold and grasp the objects, and even to assist  him in every way possible. But the mother must assist him only by  allowing free play to his attempts. To hand him the object is to  deprive the exercise of most of its value. Incidentally she may teach  him the virtue of putting things back in their proper places, an  accomplishment in which he will soon grow to take a proper pride. If  she attempts continually to turn him from his purpose, reproving him  and snatching things from him, she prolongs the grasping phase beyond  its usual limits. And she does a worse thing at the same time. Lest  the quicker hands of his nurse should intervene to snatch the prize  away before he has grasped it, he too learns to snatch, with a sudden  clumsy movement that overturns, or breaks, or spills. If left to  himself he will soon acquire the dexterity he desires. He may overturn  objects at first, or let them fall, but this he regards as failure,  which he soon overcomes. A child of twenty months, whose development  in this particular way has not been impeded by unwise repression, will  pick out the object on which he has set his heart, play with it,  finger it, and replace it, and he will do it deliberately and  carefully, with a clear desire to avoid mishap. Dr. Montessori, who  has developed into a system the art of teaching young children to  learn precision of movement and to develop the nerve centres which  control movement, tells in her book a story which well illustrates  this point.[1]    [Footnote 1: _The Montessori Method_, pp. 84, 85.]    \"The directress of the Casa del Bambini at Milan constructed under one  of the windows a long, narrow shelf, upon which she placed the little  tables containing the metal geometric forms used in the first lesson  in design. But the shelf was too narrow, and it often happened that  the children in selecting the pieces which they wished to use would  allow one of the little tables to fall to the floor, thus upsetting  with great noise all the metal pieces which it held. The directress  intended to have the shelf changed, but the carpenter was slow in  coming, and while waiting for him she discovered that the children had  learned to handle these materials so carefully that in spite of the  narrow and sloping shelf, the little tables no longer fell to the  ground. The children, by carefully directing their movements, had  overcome the defect in this piece of furniture.\"    By slow degrees the child learns to command his movements. If his  efforts are aided and not thwarted, before he is two years old he will  have become capable of conducting himself correctly, yet with perfect  freedom. The worst result of the continual repression which may be  constantly practised in the mistaken belief that the grasping phase is  a bad habit which persistent opposition will eradicate, is the nervous  unrest and irritation which it produces in the child. A passionate fit  of crying is too often the result of the thwarting of his nature, and  the same process repeated over and over again, day by day, almost hour  by hour, is apt to leave its mark in unsatisfied longing,  irritability, and unrest. Above all, the child requires liberty of  action.    We have here an admirable example of the effect of environment in  developing the child's powers. A caged animal is a creature deprived  of the stimulus of environment, and bereft therefore to a great extent  of the skill which we call instinct, by which it procures its food,  guarantees its safety from attack, constructs its home, cares for its  young, and procreates its species. If, metaphorically speaking, we  encircle the child with a cage, if we constantly intervene to  interpose something between him and the stimulus of his environment,  his characteristic powers are kept in abeyance or retarded, just as  the marvellous instinct of the wild animals becomes less efficient in  captivity.    The grasping phase is but a preliminary to more complex activities.  Just as in schooldays we were taught with much labour to make  pot-hooks and hangers efficiently before we were promoted to real  attempts at writing, so before the child can really perform tasks with  a definite meaning and purpose, he must learn to control the finer  movements of his hands. Once the grasping phase, the stage of  pot-hooks, is successfully past--and the end of the second year in a  well-managed child should see its close--the child sets himself with  enthusiasm to wider tasks. To him washing and dressing, fetching his  shoes and buttoning his gaiters, all the processes of his simple  little life, should be matters of the most enthralling interest, in  which he is eager to take his part and increasingly capable of doing  so. In the Montessori system there is provided an elaborate apparatus,  the didactic material, designed to cultivate tactile sensation and the  perception of sense stimuli. It will generally suffice to advise the  mother to make use of the ordinary apparatus of the nursery. The  imitativeness of the young child is so great that he will repeat in  almost every detail all the actions of his nurse as she carries out  the daily routine. At eighteen months of age, when the electric light  is turned on in his nursery, the child will at once go to the curtains  and make attempts to draw them. At the same age a little girl will  weigh her doll in her own weighing-machine, will take every precaution  that the nurse takes in her own case, and will even stoop down  anxiously to peer at the dial, just as she has seen her mother and  nurse do on the weekly weighing night. But at a very early age  children appreciate the difference between the real and the  make-believe. They desire above all things to do acts of real service.  At the age of two a child should know where every article for the  nursery table is kept. He will fetch the tablecloth and help to put it  in place, spoons and cups and saucers will be carried carefully to the  table, and when the meal is over he will want to help to clear it all  away. All this is to him a great delight, and the good nurse will  encourage it in the children, because she sees that in doing so they  gain quickness and dexterity and poise of body. The first purposive  movements of the child should be welcomed and encouraged. It is  foolish and wrong to repress them, as many nurses do, because the  child in his attempts gets in the way, and no doubt for a time delays  rather than expedites preparations. The child who is made to sit  immobile in his chair while everything is done for him is losing  precious hours of learning and of practice. It is useless, and to my  mind a little distasteful, to substitute for all this wonderful child  activity the artificial symbolism of the kindergarten school in which  children are taught to sing songs or go through certain semi-dramatic  activities which savour too much of a performance acquired by precise  instruction. If such accomplishments are desired, they may be added  to, but they must not replace, the more workaday activities of the  little child. The child whose impulses towards purposive action are  encouraged is generally a happy child, with a mind at rest. When those  impulses are restrained, mental unrest and irritability are apt to  appear, and toys and picture books and kindergarten games will not be  sufficient to restore his natural peace of mind.      _(b)_ THE SUGGESTIBILITY OF THE CHILD    We may pass from considering the imitativeness of the child to study a  second and closely related quality, his suggestibility. His conception  of himself as a separate individual, of his ego, only gradually  emerges. It is profoundly modified by ideas derived from those around  him. Because of his lack of acquired experience, there is in the child  an extreme sensitiveness to impressions from outside. Take, for  example, a matter that is sometimes one of great difficulty, the  child's likes and dislikes for food. Many mothers make complaint that  there are innumerable articles of diet which the child will not take:  that he will not drink milk, or that he will not eat fat, or meat, or  vegetables, or milk puddings. There are people who believe that these  peculiarities of taste correspond with idiosyncrasies of digestion,  and that children instinctively turn from what would do them harm. I  do not believe that there is much truth in this contention. If we  watch an infant after weaning, at the time when his diet is gradually  being enlarged to include more solid food, with new and varied  flavours, we may see his attention arrested by the strange sensations.  With solid or crisp food there may be a good deal of hesitation and  fumbling before he sets himself to masticate and swallow. With the  unaccustomed flavour of gravy or fruit juice there may be seen on his  face a look of hesitation or surprise. In the stolid and placid child  these manifestations are as a rule but little marked, and pleasurable  sensations "]]]
