But that is not the story I started to tell.--As the dancing went on,  Nolan and our fellows all got at ease, as I said,--so much so, that it  seemed quite natural for him to bow to that splendid Mrs. Graff, and  say,--    \"I hope you have not forgotten me, Miss Rutledge. Shall I have the honor  of dancing?\"    He did it so quickly, that Fellows, who was by him, could not hinder  him. She laughed and said,--    \"I am not Miss Rutledge any longer, Mr. Nolan; but I will dance all the  same,\" just nodded to Fellows, as if to say he must leave Mr. Nolan to  her, and led him off to the place where the dance was forming.    Nolan thought he had got his chance. He had known her at Philadelphia,  and at other places had met her, and this was a Godsend. You could not  talk in contra-dances, as you do in cotillons, or even in the pauses of  waltzing; but there were chances for tongues and sounds, as well as for  eyes and blushes. He began with her travels, and Europe, and Vesuvius,  and the French; and then, when they had worked down, and had that long  talking-time at the bottom of the set, he said, boldly,--a little pale,  she said, as she told me the story, years after,--    \"And what do you hear from home, Mrs. Graff?\"    And that splendid creature looked through him. Jove! how she must have  looked through him!    \"Home!! Mr. Nolan!!! I thought you were the man who never wanted to hear  of home again!\"--and she walked directly up the deck to her husband, and  left poor Nolan alone, as he always was.--He did not dance again.    I cannot give any history of him in order; nobody can now; and, indeed,  I am not trying to. These are the traditions, which I sort out, as I  believe them, from the myths which have been told about this man for  forty years. The lies that have been told about him are legion. The  fellows used to say he was the \"Iron Mask\"; and poor George Pons went to  his grave in the belief that this was the author of \"Junius,\" who was  being punished for his celebrated libel on Thomas Jefferson. Pons was  not very strong in the historical line. A happier story than either of  these I have told is of the War. That came along soon after. I have  heard this affair told in three or four ways,--and, indeed, it may have  happened more than once. But which ship it was on I cannot tell.  However, in one, at least, of the great frigate-duels with the English,  in which the navy was really baptized, it happened that a round-shot  from the enemy entered one of our ports square, and took right down the  officer of the gun himself, and almost every man of the gun's crew. Now  you may say what you choose about courage, but that is not a nice thing  to see. But, as the men who were not killed picked themselves up, and as  they and the surgeon's people were carrying off the bodies, there  appeared Nolan, in his shirt-sleeves, with the rammer in his hand, and,  just as if he had been the officer, told them off with authority,--who  should go to the cockpit with the wounded men, who should stay with  him,--perfectly cheery, and with that way which makes men feel sure all  is right and is going to be right. And he finished loading the gun with  his own hands, aimed it, and bade the men fire. And there he stayed,  captain of that gun, keeping those fellows in spirits, till the enemy  struck,--sitting on the carriage while the gun was cooling, though he  was exposed all the time,--showing them easier ways to handle heavy  shot,--making the raw hands laugh at their own blunders,--and when the  gun cooled again, getting it loaded and fired twice as often as any  other gun on the ship. The captain walked forward by way of encouraging  the men, and Nolan touched his hat and said,--    \"I am showing them how we do this in the artillery, sir.\"    And this is the part of the story where all the legends agree; and the  Commodore said,--    \"I see you do, and I thank you, sir; and I shall never forget this day,  sir, and you never shall, sir.\"    And after the whole thing was over, and he had the Englishman's sword,  in the midst of the state and ceremony of the quarter-deck, he said,--    \"Where is Mr. Nolan? Ask Mr. Nolan to come here.\"    And when Nolan came, the captain said,--    \"Mr. Nolan, we are all very grateful to you to-day; you are one of us  to-day; you will be named in the despatches.\"    And then the old man took off his own sword of ceremony, and gave it to  Nolan, and made him put it on. The man told me this who saw it. Nolan  cried like a baby, and well he might. He had not worn a sword since that  infernal day at Fort Adams. But always afterwards on occasions of  ceremony, he wore that quaint old French sword of the Commodore's.    The captain did mention him in the despatches. It was always said he  asked that he might be pardoned. He wrote a special letter to the  Secretary of War. But nothing ever came of it. As I said, that was about  the time when they began to ignore the whole transaction at Washington,  and when Nolan's imprisonment began to carry itself on because there was  nobody to stop it without any new orders from home.    I have heard it said that he was with Porter when he took possession of  the Nukahiwa Islands. Not this Porter, you know, but old Porter, his  father, Essex Porter,--that is, the old Essex Porter, not this Essex. As  an artillery officer, who had seen service in the West, Nolan knew more  about fortifications, embrasures, ravelins, stockades, and all that,  than any of them did; and he worked with a right good-will in fixing  that battery all right. I have always thought it was a pity Porter did  not leave him in command there with Gamble. That would have settled all  the question about his punishment. We should have kept the islands, and  at this moment we should have one station in the Pacific Ocean. Our  French friends, too, when they wanted this little watering-place, would  have found it was preoccupied. But Madison and the Virginians, of  course, flung all that away.    All that was near fifty year ago. If Nolan was thirty then, he must have  been near eighty when he died. He looked sixty when he was forty. But he  never seemed to me to change a hair afterwards. As I imagine his life,  from what I have seen and heard of it, he must have been in every sea,  and yet almost never on land. He must have known, in a formal way, more  officers in our service than any man living knows. He told me once, with  a grave smile, that no man in the world lived so methodical a life as  he. \"You know the boys say I am the Iron Mask, and you know how busy he  was.\" He said it did not do for any one to try to read all the time,  more than to do anything else all the time; but that he read just five  hours a day. \"Then,\" he said, \"I keep up my note-books, writing in them  at such and such hours from what I have been reading; and I include in  these my scrap-books.\" These were very curious indeed. He had six or  eight, of different subjects. There was one of History, one of Natural  Science, one which he called \"Odds and Ends.\" But they were not merely  books of extracts from newspapers. They had bits of plants and ribbons,  shells tied on, and carved scraps of bone and wood, which he had taught  the men to cut for him, and they were beautifully illustrated. He drew  admirably. He had some of the funniest drawings there, and some of the  most pathetic, that I have ever seen in my life. I wonder who will have  Nolan's scrap-books.    Well, he said his reading and his notes were his profession, and that  they took five hours and two hours respectively of each day. \"Then,\"  said he, \"every man should have a diversion as well as a profession. My  Natural History is my diversion.\" That took two hours a day more. The  men used to bring him birds and fish, but on a long cruise he had to  satisfy himself with centipedes and cockroaches and such small game. He  was the only naturalist I ever met who knew anything about the habits of  the house-fly and the mosquito. All those people can tell you whether  they are _Lepidoptera_ or _Steptopotera_; but as for telling how you can  get rid of them, or how they get away from you when you strike  them,--why Linnaeus knew as little of that as John Foy the idiot did.  These nine hours made Nolan's regular daily \"occupation.\" The rest of  the time he talked or walked. Till he grew very old, he went aloft a  great deal. He always kept up his exercise; and I never heard that he  was ill. If any other man was ill, he was the kindest nurse in the  world; and he knew more than half the surgeons do. Then if anybody was  sick or died, or if the captain wanted him to, on any other occasion, he  was always ready to read prayers. I have said that he read beautifully.    My own acquaintance with Philip Nolan began six or eight years after the  War, on my first voyage after I was appointed a midshipman. It was in  the first days after our Slave-Trade treaty, while the Reigning House,  which was still the House of Virginia, had still a sort of  sentimentalism about the suppression of the horrors of the Middle  Passage, and something was sometimes done that way. We were in the South  Atlantic on that business. From the time I joined, I believe I thought  Nolan was a sort of lay chaplain,--a chaplain with a blue coat. I never  asked about him. Everything in the ship was strange to me. I knew it was  green to ask questions, and I suppose I thought there was a  \"Plain-Buttons\" on every ship. We had him to dine in our mess once a  week, and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15869"],[0,"A Voyage Towards the South Pole and Round the World Volume 2 (#4)"],[1," be  lying alongside of a sailing canoe which was on board. One of her people  seeing him look another way, and his attention otherwise engaged, took the  opportunity of stealing somewhat out of his canoe; they then put off, and  set their sail. But the man, perceiving the trick they had played him,  darted after them, and having soon got on board their canoe, beat him who  had taken his things, and not only brought back his own, but many other  articles which he took from them. This man had likewise been observed  making collections on shore at the trading-place. I remembered to have seen  him there; and, on account of his gathering tribute, took him to be a man  of consequence, and was going to make him a present; but some of their  people would not let me, saying he was no _Areeke_ (that is, chief).  He had his hair always powdered with some kind of white dust.    As we had no wind to sail this afternoon, a party of us went ashore in the  evening. We found the natives everywhere courteous and obliging; so that,  had we made a longer stay, it is probable we should have had no more reason  to complain of their conduct. While I was now on shore, I got the names of  twenty islands, which lie between the N.W. and N.E., some of them in sight.  Two of them, which lie most to the west, viz. Amattafoa and Oghao, are  remarkable on account of their great height. In Amattafoa, which is the  westernmost, we judged there was a volcano, by the continual column of  smoke we saw daily ascending from the middle of it.    Both Mr Cooper and myself being on shore at noon, Mr Wales could not wind  up the watch at the usual time; and, as we did not come on board till late  in the afternoon, it was forgotten till it was down. This circumstance was  of no consequence, as Mr Wales had had several altitudes of the sun at this  place, before it went down; and also had opportunities of taking some  after.    At day-break on the 29th, having got under sail with a light breeze at  west, we stood to the north for the two high islands; but the wind,  scanting upon us, carried us in amongst the low isles and shoals; so that,  we had to ply, to clear them. This gave time for a great many canoes to get  up with us. The people in them brought for traffic various articles; some  roots, fruits, and fowls, but of the latter not many. They took in exchange  small nails, and pieces of any kind of cloth. I believe, before they went  away, they stripped the most of our people of the few clothes the ladies at  Otaheite had left them; for the passion for curiosities was as great as  ever. Having got clear of the low isles, we made a stretch to the south,  and did but fetch a little to windward of the south end of Anamocka; so  that we got little by this day's plying. Here we spent the night, making  short boards over that space with which we had made ourselves acquainted  the preceding day.    On the 30th at day-break, stretched out for Amattafoa, with a gentle breeze  at W.S.W. Day no sooner dawned than we saw canoes coming from all parts.  Their traffic was much the same as it had been the day before, or rather  better; for out of one canoe I got two pigs, which were scarce articles  here. At four in the afternoon, we drew near the island of Amattafoa, and  passed between it and Oghao, the channel being two miles broad, safe, and  without soundings. While we were in the passage, we had little wind and  calms. This gave time for a large sailing double canoe, which had been  following us all the day, as well as some others with paddles, to come up  with us. I had now an opportunity to verify a thing I was before in doubt  about, which was, whether or no some of these canoes did not, in changing  tacks, only shift the sail, and so proceed with that end foremost, which  before was the stern. The one we now saw wrought in this manner. The sail  is latteen, extending to a latteen yard above, and to a boom at the foot;  in one word, it is like a whole mizzen, supposing the whole foot to be  extended to a boom. The yard is slung nearly in the middle, or upon an  equipoise. When they change tacks they throw the vessel up in the wind,  ease off the sheet, and bring the heel or tack-end of the yard to the other  end of the boat, and the sheet in like manner; there are notches, or  sockets, at each end of the vessel in which the end of the yard fixes. In  short, they work just as those do at the Ladrone Islands, according to Mr  Walter's description*. When they want to sail large, or before the wind,  the yard is taken out of the socket and squared. It most be observed, that  all their sailing vessels are not rigged to sail in the same manner. Some,  and those of the largest size, are rigged, so as to tack about. These have  a short but pretty stout mast, which steps on a kind of roller that is  fixed to the deck near the fore-part. It is made to lean or incline very  much forward; the head is forked; on the two points of which the yard  rests, as on two pivots, by means of two strong cleats of wood secured to  each side of the yard, at about one-third its length from the tack or heel,  which, when under sail, is confined down between the two canoes, by means  of two strong ropes, one to and passing through a hole at the head of each  canoe; for it must be observed, that all the sailing vessels of this sort  are double. The tack being thus fixed, it is plain that, in changing tacks,  the vessels must be put about; the sail and boom on the one tack will be  clear of the mast, and on the other it will lie against it, just as a whole  mizzen. However, I am not sure if they do not sometimes unlace that part of  the sail from the yard which is between the tack and mast-head, and so  shift both sail and boom leeward of the mast. The drawings which Mr Hodges  made of these vessels seem to favour this supposition. The outriggers and  ropes used for shrowds, etc. are all stout and strong. Indeed, the sail,  yard, and boom, are all together of such an enormous weight, that strength  is required.    [* See Lord Anson's Voyage.]    The summit of Amattafoa was hid in the clouds the whole day, so that we  were not able to determine with certainty whether there was a volcano or  no; but every thing we could see concurred to make us believe there was.  This island is about five leagues in circuit. Oghao is not so much; but  more round and peaked. They lie in the direction of N.N.W. 1/2 W. from  Anamocka, eleven or twelve leagues distant; they are both inhabited, but  neither of them seemed fertile.    We were hardly through the passage before we got a fresh breeze at south.  That moment all the natives made haste to be gone, and we steered to the  west; all sails set. I had some thoughts of touching at Amsterdam, as it  lay not much out of the way; but as the wind was now, we could not fetch  it; and this was the occasion of my laying my design aside altogether.    Let us now return to Anamocka, as it is called by the natives. It is  situated in the latitude of 20 deg. 15' S.; longitude 174 deg. 31' W., and was  first discovered by Tasman, and by him named Rotterdam. It is of a  triangular form, each side whereof is about three and a half or four miles.  A salt-water lake in the middle of it occupies not a little of its surface,  and in a manner cuts off the S.E. angle. Round the island, that is, from  the N.W. to the S., round by the N. and E., lie scattered a number of small  isles, sand-banks, and breakers. We could see no end to their extent to the  N.; and it is not impossible that they reach as far S. as Amsterdam or  Tongatabu. These, together with Middleburg or Eaoowee, and Pylstart, make a  group, containing about three degrees of latitude and two of longitude,  which I have named the Friendly Isles or Archipelago, as a firm alliance  and friendship seems to subsist among their inhabitants, and their  courteous behaviour to strangers entitles them to that appellation; under  which we might, perhaps, extend their group much farther, even down to  Boscawen and Keppell's Isles discovered by Captain Wallis, and lying nearly  under the same meridian, and in the latitude of 15 deg. 53'; for, from the  little account I have had of the people of these two isles they seem to  have the same sort of friendly disposition we observed in our Archipelago.    The inhabitants, productions, etc. of Rotterdam, and the neighbouring isles,  are the same as at Amsterdam. Hogs and fowls are, indeed, much scarcer; of  the former having got but six, and not many of the latter. Yams and  shaddocks were what we got the most of; other fruits were not so plenty.  Not half of the isle is laid out in inclosed plantations as at Amsterdam;  but the parts which are not inclosed, are not less fertile or uncultivated.  There is, however, far more waste land on this isle, in proportion to its  size, than upon the other; and the people seem to be much poorer; that is,  in cloth, matting, ornaments, etc. which constitute a great part of the  riches of the South-Sea islanders.    The people of this isle seem to be more affected with the leprosy, or some  scrophulous disorder, than any I have seen elsewhere. It breaks out in the  face more than any other part of the body. I have seen several whose faces  were ruined by it, and their noses quite gone. In one of my excursions,  happening to peep into a house where one or more of them were, one man only  appeared at the door, or hole, by which I must have entered, and which he  began to stop up, by drawing several parts of a cord across it. But the  intolerable stench which came from his putrid face was alone sufficient to  keep me out, had the entrance been ever so wide. His nose was quite gone,  and his whole face in one continued ulcer; so that the very sight of him  was shocking. As our people had not all got clear of a certain disease they  had contracted at the Society Isles, I took all possible care to prevent  its being communicated to the natives"]]]
