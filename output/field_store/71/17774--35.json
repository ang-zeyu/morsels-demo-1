Back, Back;--he fears not foaming flood      Who fears not steel-clad line:--    No warrior thou of German blood,      No brother thou of mine.    Go earn Rome's chain to load thy neck,      Her gems to deck thy hilt;    And blazon honor's hapless wreck      With all the gauds of guilt.      But wouldst thou have _me_ share the prey?      By all that I have done,    The Varian bones that day by day      Lie whitening in the sun;    The legion's trampled panoply      The eagle's shattered wing.    I would not be for earth or sky      So scorned and mean a thing,      Ho, call me here the wizard, boy,      Of dark and subtle skill,    To agonize but not destroy,      To torture, not to kill.    When swords are out, and shriek and shout      Leave little room for prayer,    No fetter on man's arm or heart      Hangs half so heavy there.      I curse him by the gifts the land      Hath won from him and Rome.    The riving axe, the wasting brand,      Rent forest, blazing home.    I curse him by our country's gods,      The terrible, the dark,    The breakers of the Roman rods,      The smiters of the bark.      Oh, misery that such a ban      On such a brow should be!    Why comes he not in battle's van      His country's chief to be?    To stand a comrade by my side,      The sharer of my fame,    And worthy of a brother's pride,      And of a brother's name?      But it is past!--where heroes press      And cowards bend the knee,    Arminius is not brotherless,      His brethren are the free.    They come around:--one hour, and light      Will fade from turf and tide,    Then onward, onward to the fight,      With darkness for our guide.      To-night, to-night, when we shall meet      In combat face to face,    Then only would Arminius greet      The renegade's embrace.    The canker of Rome's guilt shall be      Upon his dying name;    And as he lived in slavery,      So shall he fall in shame.           *       *       *       *       *    CAMPBELL AND WASHINGTON IRVING.    The Editor of _The Albion_, in noticing the republication by the  Harpers of the very interesting Life and Letters of Thomas Campbell,  by Dr. Beattie, has the following observations upon Mr. Irving's  introductory letter:    \"WASHINGTON IRVING, at the request of the publishers, contributed a  very interesting letter to themselves, directing public notice to the  value of this edition. He pays also a hearty and deserved tribute,  not only to the genius of Campbell, but to his many excellencies and  kindly specialities of character. The author of \"Hohenlinden,\" and the  \"Battle of the Baltic\" stands in need of no man's praise as a lyric  poet--but this sort of testimony to his private worth is grateful  and well-timed. Here is an interesting passage from Mr. Irving's  introductory communication. He is alluding to Campbell's fame and  position, when he himself first made Campbell's acquaintance in  England.        \"'I had considered the early productions of Campbell as      brilliant indications of a genius yet to be developed, and      trusted that, during the long interval which had elapsed,      he had been preparing something to fulfill the public      expectation; I was greatly disappointed, therefore, to find      that, as yet, he had contemplated no great and sustained      effort. My disappointment in this respect was shared      by others, who took the same interest in his fame, and      entertained the same idea of his capacity. 'There he is      cooped up in Sydenham,' said a great Edinburgh critic to me,      'simmering his brains to serve up a little dish of poetry,      instead of pouring out a whole caldron.'        \"'Scott, too, who took a cordial delight in Campbell's poetry,      expressed himself to the same effect. 'What a pity is it,'      said he to me 'that Campbell does not give full sweep to his      genius. He has wings that would bear him up to the skies, and      he does now and then spread them grandly, but folds them up      again and resumes his perch, as if afraid to launch away. The      fact is, he is a bugbear to himself. The brightness of his      early success is a detriment to all his future efforts. _He is      afraid of the shadow that his own fame casts before him_.'        \"'Little was Scott aware at the time that he, in truth, was      a 'bugbear' to Campbell. This I infer from an observation of      Mrs. Campbell's in reply to an expression of regret on my part      that her husband did not attempt something on a grand Scale.      'It is unfortunate for Campbell,' said she, 'that he lives in      the same age with Scott and Byron.' I asked why. 'Oh,' said      she, 'they write so much and so rapidly. Now Campbell writes      slowly, and it takes him some time to get under way; and just      as he has fairly begun, out comes one of their poems, that      sets the world agog and quite daunts him, so that he throws by      his pen in despair.'        \"'I pointed out the essential difference in their kinds of      poetry, and the qualities which insured perpetuity to that of      her husband. 'You can't persuade Campbell of that,' said she.      'He is apt to undervalue his own works, and to consider his      own lights put out, whenever they come blazing out with their      great torches.'        \"'I repeated the conversation to Scott sometime afterward,      and it drew forth a characteristic comment. 'Pooh!' said he,      good-humoredly, 'how can Campbell mistake the matter so      much. Poetry goes by quality, not by bulk. My poems are mere      cairngorms, wrought up, perhaps, with a cunning hand, and may      pass well in the market as long as cairngorms are the fashion;      but they are mere Scotch pebbles after all; now Tom Campbell's      are real diamonds, and diamonds of the first water.'\"    \"The foregoing is new to us, and full of a double interest. It is  followed, however, by a statement, that needs a word of explanation.  Mr. Irving says:        \"'I have not time at present to furnish personal anecdotes of      my intercourse with Campbell, neither does it afford any of a      striking nature. Though extending over a number of years, it      was never very intimate. His residence in the country, and      my own long intervals of absence on the continent, rendered      our meetings few and far between. To tell the truth, I was      not much drawn to Campbell, having taken up a wrong notion      concerning him, from seeing him at times when his mind was      ill at ease, and preyed upon by secret griefs. I thought      him disposed to be querulous and captious, and had heard his      apparent discontent attributed to jealous repining at the      success of his poetical contemporaries. In a word, I knew      little of him but what might be learned in the casual      intercourse of general society; whereas it required the close      communion of confidential friendship, to sound the depth of      his character and know the treasures of excellence hidden      beneath its surface. Beside, he was dogged for years      by certain malignant scribblers, who took a pleasure in      misrepresenting all his actions, and holding him up in an      absurd and disparaging point of view. In what hostility      originated I do not know, but it must have given much      annoyance to his sensitive mind, and may have affected      his popularity. I know not to what else to attribute a      circumstance to which I was a witness during my last visit to      England. It was at an annual dinner of the Literary Fund, at      which Prince Albert presided, and where was collected much      of the prominent talent of the kingdom. In the course of      the evening Campbell rose to make a speech. I had not seen      him for years, and his appearance showed the effect of age      and ill-health; _it was evident, also, that his mind was      obfuscated by the wine he had been drinking_. He was confused      and tedious in his remarks; still, there was nothing but      what one would have thought would have been received with      indulgence, if not deference, from a veteran of his fame and      standing; a living classic. On the contrary, to my surprise, I      soon observed signs of impatience in the company; the poet was      repeatedly interrupted by coughs and discordant sounds, and      as often endeavored to proceed; the noise at length became      intolerable, and he was absolutely clamored down, sinking      into his chair overwhelmed and disconcerted. I could not have      thought such treatment possible to such a person at such a      meeting. Hallam, author of the Literary History of the Middle      Ages, who sat by me on this occasion, marked the mortification      of the poet, and it excited his generous sympathy. Being      shortly afterward on the floor to reply to a toast, he took      occasion to advert to the recent remarks of Campbell, and in      so doing called up in review all his eminent achievements in      the world of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13797"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science - Volume 1, No. (#4)"],[1," return  from Paris to Seville. As the Sevilians have instituted a 'process'  for its recovery, it is likely to stay there for some time longer.  'The Patrician's Dream' is quite cheering to look upon, so rich and  glowing it is. Shut your eyes to the semi-ludicrous effect of husband,  wife, and dog, in a decreasing series, like the three genders in  Lindley Murray, all asleep.    \"The gardens of the queen, sunk in a deep hollow below the palace,  deserve a visit. The head-gardener, of course a Frenchman, struggles  gallantly against all kinds of difficulties of soil, climate, and lack  of water. By a series of ingenious artifices he has concocted a plot  of grass, some ten feet square, to the great astonishment of all  natives.\"    NARVAEZ IN THE SENATE.    \"One day my kind friend Colonel S. took me to hear a debate in the  _Senado_, the Spanish Chamber of Peers, which holds its sittings in  the chapel of a suppressed convent, near the palace. By dint of paint,  gilding, and carpets, the room has been divested of its sanctified  aspect, and made to look like a handsome modern room. They have not  thought it necessary that a place in which a hundred gentlemen in  surtouts meet to discuss secular matters in this nineteenth century,  should be made to resemble a chapel of the fifteenth. Antiquity is  here represented in the person of two halberdiers, who stand to guard  the door, dressed in extravagant costume, like beefeaters in full  bloom. Rows of raised seats extend on each side of the room; in  the center, facing the beef-eaters, are the chair and desk of the  president, and on each side a little tribune, from which the clerks  read out documents from time to time. The spectators are accommodated  in niches round the walls. Each member speaks from his place, and the  voting is by ballot. First a footman hands round a tray of beans, and  then each advances, when his name is called, to a table in the center,  where he drops his bean into the box. The beans are then counted, and  the result proclaimed by the president. On the right of the chair, in  the front, is the bench assigned to the ministers; and there I had  the good luck to see Narvaez, otherwise called Duke of Valencia, and  a great many fine names besides, and, in reality, master of all the  Spains. His face wears a fixed expression of inflexible resolve, very  effective, and garnished with a fierce dyed mustache, and a somewhat  palpable wig to match. His style of dress was what, in an inferior  man, one would have called 'dandified.' An unexceptionable surtout,  opened to display a white waistcoat with sundry chains, and the  extremities terminated, respectively, in patent leather and primrose  kid. During the discussion he alternately fondled a neat riding-whip  and aired a snowy pocket-handkerchief. Those who know him give him  credit for good intentions and great courage, but do not expect  that he will ever set the Thames on fire, whatever he may do to  the Manzanares. He is a mixture, they say, of the chivalric and the  asinine: a kind of moral mule. His personal weakness is a wish to be  thought young, and hence he was naturally angry when Lord Palmerston  wanted to give him a 'wrinkle.' I saw, likewise, Mon, the Minister of  Finance, smiling complacently, like a shopkeeper on his customers;  and the venerable Castanos, Duke of Bailen, who, as he tottered in,  stooping under the weight of ninety years, was affectionately greeted  by Narvaez and others. On the whole, the debate seemed to be languid,  and to be listened to with little interest; but that is the general  fate of debates in July.\"           *       *       *       *       *      THE KANASZ.    Of the Servian swineherd we have heard something of late, both in  history and romance; because this was the vocation of Kara George, the  Servian Liberator. In Hungary the swine-keeper does not seem to be so  respectable a person. Here is a sketch of him from Max Schlesinger's  new book on the Hungarian war:    \"The Kanasz is a swineherd, whose occupation, everywhere unpoetical  and dirty, is doubly troublesome and dirty in Hungary. Large droves  of pigs migrate annually into the latter country from Serbia, where  they still live in a half-wild state. In Hungary they fatten in the  extensive oak-forests, and are sent to market in the large towns, even  to Vienna, and still further....    \"It is a true enjoyment to live in these shady forests. The oak  attains a finer and more luxuriant growth on the Hungarian soil than  in any part of Germany. The hogs find food in profusion, and commonly  stuff themselves to such a degree that they lose all desire for roving  about: so that dog, master, and ass, lead a comparatively easy life,  and are left to the quiet enjoyment of nature. But the lot of the  Kanasz is a pitiable one when, at the close of summer, he has to  drive his swine to market. From Debreczin, nay even from the Serbian  frontier, he has to make a journey on foot more toilsome than was ever  undertaken by the most adventurous traveler, pacing slowly over the  interminable heaths in rain, storm, or under a burning sun, behind  his pigs, which drive into his face hot clouds of dust. Every now and  then a hog has stuffed itself so full as to be unable to stir from the  spot; and there it lies on the road without moving, whilst the whole  caravan is obliged to wait for half a day or longer, until the glutted  animal can get on his legs again; and when at length this feat is  accomplished, frequently his neighbor begins the same trick. There  is truly not a more toilsome business in the wide world than that of  a Kanasz.... The fokos is a hatchet, with a long handle, which the  Kanasz hurls with great dexterity. Whenever he desires to pick out  and slaughter one of his hogs, either for his own use or for sale,  the attempt would be attended with danger, in the half-savage state  of these animals, without such a weapon. The fokos here assists him;  which he flings with such force and precision, that the sharp iron  strikes exactly into the center of the frontal bone of the animal  he has marked out; the victim sinks on the earth without uttering a  sound, and the drove quietly proceeds on its way. That he can strike  down a man with equal precision at eighty to a hundred paces, is  proved by the gallows at the entrance of the forest--the three-legged  monument of his dexterity. During recent events, too, the surgeons  of the Austrian army will readily furnish the Kanasz and Csikos with  certificates of their ability and skill.\"           *       *       *       *       *      THE \"WILD HUSSAR\" OF HUNGARY.    France, Russia, Prussia, and other countries, have introduced the  Hussars into their armies; but these soldiers are merely Russian,  French, and Prussian cavalry, dressed in the Hungarian laced jacket:  they want the spirit, the horse, and--the 'Magyar Isten.' For this  reason, the Hungarian Hussar will not acknowledge them as brethren;  and whenever he comes in contact with foreign Hussars, he lets them  feel in battle the full force of his contempt. A story is told, that  during a campaign against the French in the war with Napoleon, the  bivouacs of the Prussian and Hungarian Hussars were near to one  another. A Prussian came over to his neighbors in a familiar way with  a glass of wine, and drank it to the health of his 'brother hussar.'  But the Hungarian gently pushed the glass back, and stroked his beard,  saying, 'What brother?--no brother--I hussar--you jack-pudding.'    This expression is not to be mistaken for a brag. The Hungarian hussar  is no fanfaron like the French chasseur, but he is conscious of his  own powers, like a Grenadier of the Old Imperial Guard. The dolmany,  the csako, and the csizma, have grown to his body; they form his  holyday dress even when off duty--the national costume transferred  into the army; and as he is aware that this is not the case in other  countries, the foreign Hussar's dress is in his eyes a mere servant's  livery; and logically the man is not altogether wrong.    The Hussar, like the Magyars in general, is naturally good-tempered.  The finest man in the service, he is at the same time the most jovial  companion in the tavern, and will not sit by and empty his glass by  himself when a Bohemian or German comrade at his side has spent all  his money. There is only one biped under the sun who is in his eyes  more contemptible and hateful than any animal of marsh or forest. This  is the Banderial Hussar--that half-breed between Croat and Magyar,  that caricature of the true Hussar, who serves in the cavalry, as  the Croat in the infantry, of the Military Frontier. Never was an  Hungarian Hussar known to drink with a Banderial Hussar; never will he  sit at the same table: if he meets a snake he crushes it under foot--a  wolf he will hunt in the mountains--with a buffalo he will fight on  the open heath--with a miserable horse-stealer he will wrestle for a  halter; but as for the Banderial Hussar, he spits in his face wherever  he meets him.    It was at Hatvan, or at Tapjo-Bicske, that Hungarian and Banderial  Hussars were for the first time in this war--the first time perhaps  in the recollection of man--opposed to one another in battle. If looks  could slay, there would have been no need of a conflict, for the eyes  of the Magyars shot death and contempt at their unworthy adversaries.  The signal of attack sounded; and at the same instant, as if seized by  one common thought, the Hungarian Hussars clattered their heavy sabres  back into the scabbard, and with a fearful imprecation, such as no  German tongue could echo, charged weaponless and at full speed their  mimic caricatures whom fate had thrown in their way. The shock was so  irresistible, that the poor Croats could make no use of their sabers  against the furious onset of their unarmed foe: they were beaten down  from their saddles with the fist, and dragged off their horses by  "]]]
