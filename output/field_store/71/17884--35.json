They have also some beans and peas, and coches, a sort  of grain much like maize, sowed mostly to fatten land. They have papaws,  which I shall speak more of hereafter; apples, pears, plums, cherries,  and excellent peaches, apricots, guavas, pomegranates, citrons, oranges,  lemons, limes, pumpkins, onions the best in the world, cabbages, turnips,  potatoes, etc. They are also well stocked with horses, cows, asses,  mules, sheep, goats, hogs, conies, and plenty of deer. The Lancerota  horses are said to be the most mettlesome, fleet, and loyal horses that  are. Lastly here are many fowls, as cocks, and hens, ducks, pigeons,  partridges, etc. with plenty of fish, as mackerel, etc. All the Canary  Islands have of these commodities and provisions more or less: but as  Lancerota is most famed for horses, and Grand Canary, Tenerife, and Palma  for wines, Tenerife especially for the best malmsey (for which reason  these 3 islands have the chief trade) so is Forteventura for  dunghill-fowls, and Gomera for deer. Fowls and other eatables are dear on  the trading islands; but very plentiful and cheap on the other; and  therefore it is best for such ships that are going out on long voyages,  and who design to take in but little wine, to touch rather at these last;  where also they may be supplied with wine enough, good and cheap: and,  for my own part, if I had known before I came hither, I should have gone  rather to one of those islands than to Tenerife: but enough of this.    AND THE GOVERNORS AT LAGUNA AND SANTA CRUZ.    It is reported they can raise 12,000 armed men on this island. The  governor or general (as he is called) of all the Canary Islands lives at  Laguna: his name is Don Pedro de Ponto. He is a native of this island,  and was not long since President of Panama in the South Seas: who  bringing some very rich pearls from thence, which he presented to the  Queen of Spain, was therefore, as it is said, made general of the Canary  Islands. The Grand Canary is an island much superior to Tenerife both in  bulk and value; but this gentleman chooses rather to reside in this his  native island. He has the character of a very worthy person; and governs  with moderation and justice, being very well beloved.    One of his deputies was the governor of Santa Cruz, with whom I was to  have dined; but staying so long at Laguna, I came but time enough to sup  with him. He is a civil, discreet man. He resides in the main fort close  by the sea. There is a sentinel stands at his door; and he has a few  servants to wait on him. I was treated in a large dark lower room, which  has but one small window. There were about 200 muskets hung up against  the walls, and some pikes; no wainscot, hangings, nor much furniture.  There was only a small old table, a few old chairs, and 2 or 3 pretty  long forms to sit on. Having supped with him I invited him on board, and  went off in my boat. The next morning he came aboard with another  gentleman in his company, attended by 2 servants: but he was presently  seasick and so much out of order that he could scarce eat or drink  anything, but went quickly ashore again.    OF THE WINDS IN THESE SEAS.    Having refreshed my men ashore, and taken in what we had occasion for, I  sailed away from Santa Cruz on February 4 in the afternoon; hastening out  all I could, because the north-east winds growing stormy made so great  sea that the ship was scarce safe in the road; and I was glad to get out,  though we left behind several goods we had bought and paid for: for a  boat could not go ashore; and the stress was so great in weighing anchor  that the cable broke. I designed next for the Island of Mayo, one of the  Cape Verde Islands; and ran away with a strong north-east wind right  before it all that night and the next day, at the rate of 10 or 11 miles  an hour; when it slackened to a more moderate gale. The Canary Islands  are, for their latitude, within the usual verge of the true or general  tradewind; which I have observed to be, on this side the equator,  north-easterly: but then, lying not far from the African shore, they are  most subject to a north wind, which is the coasting and constant trade,  sweeping that coast down as low as to Cape Verde; which, spreading in  breadth, takes in mostly the Canary Islands; though it be there  interrupted frequently with the true tradewind, north-west winds, or  other shifts of wind that islands are subject to; especially where they  lie many together. The Pike of Tenerife, which had generally been clouded  while we lay at Santa Cruz, appeared now all white with snow, hovering  over the other hills; but their height made it seem the less  considerable; for it looks most remarkable to ships that are to the  westward of it. We had brisk north-north-east and north-east winds from  Tenerife, and saw flying-fish, and a great deal of sea-thistle weed  floating. By the 9th of February at noon we were in the latitude of 15  degrees 4 minutes so we steered away west-north-west for the island of  Mayo, being by judgment not far to the east of it, and at 8 o'clock in  the evening lay by till day. The wind was then at west by south, and so  it continued all night, fair weather, and a small easy gale. All these  were great signs, that we were near some land, after having had such  constant brisk winds before. In the morning after sunrise we saw the  island at about 4 leagues distance. But it was so hazy over it that we  could see but a small part of it; yet even by that part I knew it to be  the isle of Mayo. See how it appeared to us at several views as we were  compassing the east and south-east and south of it, to get to the road,  on the south-west of it, and the road itself.    THE AUTHOR'S ARRIVAL AT MAYO.    I got not in till the next day, February 11, when I come to an anchor in  the road, which is the leeward part of the island; for it is a general  rule never to anchor to windward of an island between the tropics. We  anchored at 11 o'clock in 14 fathom clean sand, and very smooth water,  about three-quarters of a mile from the shore, in the same place where I  anchored in my voyage round the world; and found riding here the Newport  of London, a merchantman, Captain Barefoot commander, who welcomed me  with 3 guns and I returned one for thanks. He came from Fayal, one of the  western islands; and had store of wine and brandy aboard. He was taking  in salt to carry to Newfoundland, and was very glad to see one of the  King's ships, being before our coming afraid of pirates, which of late  years had much infested this and the rest of the Cape Verde Islands.    I have given some account of the island of Mayo and of other of these  islands in my Voyage round the World, but I shall now add some further  observations that occurred to me in this voyage. The island of Mayo is  about 7 leagues in circumference, of a roundish form, with many small  rocky points shooting out into the sea a mile or more. Its latitude is 15  degrees north, and as you sail about the isle, when you come pretty nigh  the shore, you will see the water breaking off from those points; which  you must give a berth to and avoid them. I sailed at this time two parts  in three round the island, but saw nothing dangerous besides these  points; and they all showed themselves by the breaking of the water: yet  it is reported that on the north and north-north-west side there are  dangerous shoals that lie farther off at sea; but I was not on that side.  There are 2 hills on this island of a considerable height; one pretty  bluff, the other peaked at top. The rest of the island is pretty level  and of a good height from the sea. The shore clear round hath sandy bays  between the rocky points I spoke of, and the whole island is a very dry  sort of soil.    OF THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS; ITS SALT POND COMPARED WITH THAT OF SALT  TORTUGA; ITS TRADE FOR SALT, AND FRAPE-BOATS.    On the west side of the isle where the road for ships is, there is a  large sandy bay and a sandbank of about 40 paces wide within it which  runs along the shore 2 or 3 miles; within which there is a large salina  or salt pond, contained between the sandbank and the hills beyond it. The  whole salina is about 2 miles in length, and half a mile wide; but above  one half of it its commonly dry. The north end only of the pond never  wants water, producing salt from November till May, which is here the dry  season of the year. The water which yields this salt works in from out of  the sea through a hole in the sandbank before mentioned, like a sluice,  and that only in spring tides when it fills the pond more or less,  according to the height of the tides. If there is any salt in the ponds  when the flush of water comes in it presently dissolves: but then in 2 or  3 days after it begins to kern; and so continues kerning till either all  or the greatest part of the salt water is congealed or kerned; or till a  fresh supply of it comes in again from the sea. This water is known to  come in only at that one passage on the north part of the pond; where  also it is deepest. It was at a spring of the new moon when I was there;  and I was told that it comes in at no other time but at the new moon  spring tides; but why that should be I can't guess. They who come hither  to lade salt rake it up as it kerns, and lay it in heaps on the dry land,  before the water breaks in anew: and this is observable of this salt  pond, that the salt kerns only in the dry season, contrary to the salt  ponds in the West Indies, particularly those of the island Salt Tortuga,  which I have formerly mentioned, for they never kern there till the rains  come in about April; and continue to do so in May, June, July etc. while  the wet season lasts; and not without some good shower of rain first: but  the reason also of this difference between the salt ponds"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15697"],[0,"True Stories of History and Biography (#4)"],[1,"eads, was  displayed the banner of the Red Cross.    Endicott was the captain of the company. While the soldiers were expecting  his orders to begin their exercise, they saw him take the banner in one  hand, holding his drawn sword in the other. Probably he addressed them in  a speech, and explained how horrible a thing it was, that men, who had  fled from Popish idolatry into the wilderness, should be compelled to  fight under its symbols here. Perhaps he concluded his address somewhat in  the following style.    \"And now, fellow soldiers, you see this old banner of England. Some of  you, I doubt not, may think it treason for a man to lay violent hands upon  it. But whether or no it be treason to man, I have good assurance in my  conscience that it is no treason to God. Wherefore I have resolved that we  will rather be God's soldiers, than soldiers of the Pope of Rome; and in  that mind I now cut the Papal Cross out of this banner.\"    And so he did. And thus, in a province belonging to the crown of England,  a captain was found bold enough to deface the King's banner with his  sword.    When Winthrop, and the other wise men of Massachusetts, heard of it, they  were disquieted, being afraid that Endicott's act would bring great  trouble upon himself and them. An account of the matter was carried to  King Charles; but he was then so much engrossed by dissensions with his  people, that he had no leisure to punish the offender. In other times, it  might have cost Endicott his life, and Massachusetts her charter.        \"I should like to know, Grandfather,\" said Laurence, when the story was  ended, \"whether, when Endicott cut the Red Cross out of the banner, he  meant to imply that Massachusetts was independent of England?\"    \"A sense of the independence of his adopted country, must have been in  that bold man's heart,\" answered Grandfather; \"but I doubt whether he had  given the matter much consideration, except in its religious bearing.  However, it was a very remarkable affair, and a very strong expression of  Puritan character.\"    Grandfather proceeded to speak further of Roger Williams, and of other  persons who sat in the great chair, as will be seen in the following  chapter.          Chapter IV      \"Roger Williams,\" said Grandfather, \"did not keep possession of the chair  a great while. His opinions of civil and religious matters differed, in  many respects, from those of the rulers and clergymen of Massachusetts.  Now the wise men of those days believed, that the country could not be  safe, unless all the inhabitants thought and felt alike.\"    \"Does any body believe so in our days Grandfather?\" asked Laurence.    \"Possibly there are some who believe it,\" said Grandfather; \"but they have  not so much power to act upon their belief, as the magistrates and  ministers had, in the days of Roger Williams. They had the power to  deprive this good man of his home, and to send him out from the midst of  them, in search of a new place of rest. He was banished in 1634, and went  first to Plymouth colony; but as the people there held the same opinions  as those of Massachusetts, he was not suffered to remain among them.  However, the wilderness was wide enough; so Roger Williams took his staff  and travelled into the forest, and made treaties with the Indians, and  began a plantation which he called Providence.\"    \"I have been to Providence on the railroad,\" said Charley. \"It is but a  two hours' ride.\"    \"Yes, Charley,\" replied Grandfather; \"but when Roger Williams travelled  thither, over hills and valleys, and through the tangled woods, and across  swamps and streams, it was a journey of several days. Well; his little  plantation is now grown to be a populous city; and the inhabitants have a  great veneration for Roger Williams. His name is familiar in the mouths of  all because they see it on their bank bills. How it would have perplexed  this good clergyman, if he had been told that he should give his name to  the ROGER WILLIAMS BANK!\"    \"When he was driven from Massachusetts,\" said Laurence, \"and began his  journey into the woods, he must have felt as if he were burying himself  forever from the sight and knowledge of men. Yet the whole country has now  heard of him, and will remember him forever.\"    \"Yes,\" answered Grandfather, \"it often happens, that the outcasts of one  generation are those, who are reverenced as the wisest and best of men by  the next. The securest fame is that which comes after a man's death. But  let us return to our story. When Roger Williams was banished, he appears  to have given the chair to Mrs. Anne Hutchinson. At all events it was in  her possession in 1637. She was a very sharp-witted and well-instructed  lady, and was so conscious of her own wisdom and abilities, that she  thought it a pity that the world should not have the benefit of them. She  therefore used to hold lectures in Boston, once or twice a week, at which  most of the women attended. Mrs. Hutchinson presided at these meetings,  sitting, with great state and dignity, in Grandfather's chair.\"    \"Grandfather, was it positively this very chair?\" demanded Clara, laying  her hand upon its carved elbow.    \"Why not, my dear Clara?\" said Grandfather. \"Well; Mrs. Hutchinson's  lectures soon caused a great disturbance; for the ministers of Boston did  not think it safe and proper, that a woman should publicly instruct the  people in religious doctrines. Moreover, she made the matter worse, by  declaring that the Rev. Mr. Cotton was the only sincerely pious and holy  clergyman in New England. Now the clergy of those days had quite as much  share in the government of the country, though indirectly, as the  magistrates themselves; so you may imagine what a host of powerful enemies  were raised up against Mrs. Hutchinson. A synod was convened; that is to  say, an assemblage of all the ministers in Massachusetts. They declared  that there were eighty-two erroneous opinions on religious subjects,  diffused among the people, and that Mrs. Hutchinson's opinions were of the  number.\"    \"If they had eighty-two wrong opinions,\" observed Charley, \"I don't see  how they could have any right ones.\"    \"Mrs. Hutchinson had many zealous friends and converts,\" continued  Grandfather. \"She was favored by young Henry Vane, who had come over from  England a year or two before, and had since been chosen governor of the  colony, at the age of twenty-four. But Winthrop, and most of the other  leading men, as well as the ministers, felt an abhorrence of her  doctrines. Thus two opposite parties were formed; and so fierce were the  dissensions, that it was feared the consequence would be civil war and  bloodshed. But Winthrop and the ministers being the most powerful, they  disarmed and imprisoned Mrs. Hutchinson's adherents. She, like Roger  Williams, was banished.\"    \"Dear Grandfather, did they drive the poor woman into the woods?\"  exclaimed little Alice, who contrived to feel a human interest even in  these discords of polemic divinity.    \"They did, my darling,\" replied Grandfather; \"and the end of her life was  so sad, you must not hear it. At her departure, it appears from the best  authorities, that she gave the great chair to her friend, Henry Vane. He  was a young man of wonderful talents and great learning, who had imbibed  the religious opinions of the Puritans, and left England with the  intention of spending his life in Massachusetts. The people chose him  governor; but the controversy about Mrs. Hutchinson, and other troubles,  caused him to leave the country in 1637. You may read the subsequent  events of his life in the History of England.\"    \"Yes, Grandfather,\" cried Laurence; \"and we may read them better in Mr.  Upham's biography of Vane. And what a beautiful death he died, long  afterwards! beautiful, though it was on a scaffold.\"    \"Many of the most beautiful deaths have been there,\" said Grandfather.  \"The enemies of a great and good man can in no other way make him so  glorious, as by giving him the crown of martyrdom.\"    In order that the children might fully understand the all-important  history of the chair, Grandfather now thought fit to speak of the progress  that was made in settling several colonies. The settlement of Plymouth, in  1620, has already been mentioned. In 1635, Mr. Hooker and Mr. Stone, two  ministers, went on foot from Massachusetts to Connecticut, through the  pathless woods, taking their whole congregation along with them. They  founded the town of Hartford. In 1638, Mr. Davenport, a very celebrated  minister, went, with other people, and began a plantation at New Haven. In  the same year, some persons who had been persecuted in Massachusetts, went  to the Isle of Rhodes, since called Rhode Island, and settled there. About  this time, also, many settlers had gone to Maine, and were living without  any regular government. There were likewise settlers near Piscataqua  River, in the region which is now called New Hampshire.    Thus, at various points along the coast of New England, there were  communities of Englishmen. Though these communities were independent of  one another, yet they had a common dependence upon England; and, at so  vast a distance from their native home, the inhabitants must all have felt  like brethren. They were fitted to become one united people, at a future  period. Perhaps their feelings of brotherhood were the stronger, because  different nations had formed settlements to the north and to the south. In  Canada and Nova Scotia were colonies of French. On the banks of the Hudson  River was a colony of Dutch, who had taken possession of that region many  years before, and called it New Netherlands.    Grandfather, for aught I know, might have gone on to speak of Maryland and  Virginia; for the good old gentleman really seemed to suppose, that the  whole surface of the United States was not too broad a foundation to place  the four legs of his chair upon.
