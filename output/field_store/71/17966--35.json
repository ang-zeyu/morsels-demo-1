Settling down upon the water in a still,  damp atmosphere, it soon hid everything from the eyes of the pilots. The  flagship leading had the advantage of pushing often ahead of her own  smoke; but those who followed ran into it and incurred a perplexity  which increased from van to rear. At the bend of the river the current  caught the _Hartford_ on her port bow, sweeping her around with her head  toward the batteries, and nearly on shore, her stern touching the ground  slightly; but by her own efforts and the assistance of the _Albatross_  she was backed clear. Then, the _Albatross_ backing and the _Hartford_  going ahead strong with the engine, her head was fairly pointed up the  stream, and she passed by without serious injury. Deceived possibly by  the report of the howitzers in her top, which were nearly on their own  level, the Confederates did not depress their guns sufficiently to hit  her as often as they did the ships that followed her. One killed and two  wounded is her report; and one marine fell overboard, his cries for help  being heard on board the other ships as they passed by, unable to save  him.\"    If the capture of the batteries was impossible, their passage was almost  equally so. The _Richmond_ was so badly injured that she was compelled  to turn down stream, having suffered a loss of three killed and fifteen  wounded, while the _Monongahela_ had six killed and twenty-one wounded  before she was able to wrench herself loose from where she had grounded  and drift out of range.    Now came the _Mississippi_, whose tragic fate is graphically told by  Admiral Porter in his \"Naval History of the Civil War\":    \"The steamship _Mississippi_, Captain Melancthon Smith, followed in the  wake of the _Monongahela_, firing whenever her guns could be brought to  bear. At 11:30 o'clock she reached the turn which seemed to give our  vessels so much trouble, and Captain Smith was congratulating himself on  the prospect of soon catching up with the flag officer, when his ship  grounded and heeled over three streaks to port.    \"The engines were instantly reversed and the port guns run in in order  to bring her on an even keel, while the fire from her starboard battery  was reopened on the forts. The engines were backed with all the steam  that could be put upon them, and the backing was continued for thirty  minutes, but without avail.    \"It was now seen that it would be impossible to get the ship afloat.    \"Captain Smith gave orders to spike the port battery and throw the guns  overboard, but it was not done, for the enemy's fire was becoming so  rapid and severe that the Captain deemed it judicious to abandon the  ship at once in order to save the lives of the men.    \"While preparations were being made to destroy the ship, the sick and  wounded were lowered into boats and conveyed ashore, while the men at  the starboard battery continued to fight in splendid style, firing at  every flash of the enemy's guns. The small arms were thrown overboard,  and all possible damage was done to the engine and everything else that  might prove of use to the enemy.    \"The ship was first set on fire in the forward storeroom, but three  shots came through below her water-line and put out the flames. She was  then set afire in four places aft, and when the flames were well under  way, so as to make her destruction certain, Captain Smith and his first  lieutenant (George Dewey) left the ship, all the officers and crew  having been landed before.    \"The _Mississippi_ was soon ablaze fore and aft, and as she was now  relieved of a great deal of weight--by the removal of her crew and the  destruction of her upper works--she floated off the bank and drifted  down the river, much to the danger of the Union vessels below. But she  passed without doing them any injury, and at 5:30 o'clock blew up and  went to the bottom.\"    When the time came for the crew to save themselves as best they could,  all sprang overboard and struck out for shore. A little way from the  blazing steamer a poor sailor was struggling hard to save himself, but  one arm was palsied from a wound, and he must have drowned but for  Dewey, who swam powerfully to him, helped him to a floating piece of  wreckage and towed him safely to land.    The lieutenant was now transferred to one of the gunboats of Admiral  Farragut's squadron and engaged in patrol duty between Cairo and  Vicksburg.    [Illustration: GUNBOATS PASSING BEFORE VICKSBURG.]    The latter surrendered to General Grant July 4, 1863, and the river was  opened from its source to the Gulf. Early in 1864 the lieutenant was  made executive officer of the gunboat _Agawam_, and when attached to the  North Atlantic squadron, took part in the attack on Fort Fisher, one of  the strongest of forts, which, standing at the entrance of Cape Fear  river, was so efficient a protection to Wilmington that the city became  the chief port in the Confederacy for blockade runners. Indeed, its  blockade was a nullity, despite the most determined efforts of the Union  fleet to keep it closed. The Confederate cruisers advertised their  regular days for departure, and they ran upon schedule time, even women  and children taking passage upon the swift steamers with scarcely a fear  that they would not be able to steam in and out of the river whenever  the navigators of the craft chose to do so.    The first attempt against Fort Fisher was in the latter part of  December, 1864, but, though the fleet was numerous and powerful, and the  greatest gallantry was displayed, the attack was unsuccessful. General  Butler, in command of the land troops, after a careful examination of  the Confederate works, pronounced capture impossible and refused to  sacrifice his men in a useless attack. Nevertheless the attempt was  renewed January 12, when General Alfred Terry had charge of the land  forces. The garrison made one of the bravest defences of the whole war,  and the hand-to-hand fight was of the most furious character. It lasted  for five hours, when the fort was obliged to surrender, the garrison of  2,300 men becoming prisoners of war. It was in this fearful struggle  that Ensign \"Bob\" Evans, who was with the naval force that charged up  the unprotected beach, was so frightfully wounded that it was believed  he could not live. When the surgeon made ready to amputate his shattered  leg, Bob, who had secured possession of a loaded revolver, swore he  would shoot any man who touched the limb with such purpose. Perforce he  was left alone, and in due time fully recovered, though lamed for life.    Lieutenant Dewey was one of the most active of the young officers in the  attack on Fort Fisher, and conducted himself with so much bravery and  skill, executing one of the most difficult and dangerous movements in  the heat of the conflict, that he was highly complimented by his  superior officers.    But peace soon came, and a generation was to pass before his name was  again associated with naval exploits. In March, 1865, he was promoted to  the rank of lieutenant-commander and assigned to duty on the  _Kearsarge_, the vessel that acquired undying glory for sinking the  _Alabama_, off Cherbourg, France, during the previous July. Early in  1867 he was ordered home from the European station and assigned to duty  at the Kittery Navy Yard, at Portsmouth, New Hampshire.    While at this station he became acquainted with Miss Susan B. Goodwin,  daughter of the \"war Governor\" of New Hampshire. She was an accomplished  young woman, to whom the naval officer was married, October 24, 1867.  Their all too brief wedded life was ideally happy, but she died December  28, 1872, a few days after the birth of a son, named George Goodwin, in  honor of his grandfather.    From 1873 to 1876 Dewey was engaged in making surveys on the Pacific  coast; he commanded the _Juniata_ on the Asiatic squadron in 1882-83,  and the following year was made captain and placed in charge of the  _Dolphin_, one of the original \"white squadron.\" Next came service in  Washington as Chief of the Bureau of Equipment and Recruiting, as member  of the Lighthouse Board and president of the Board of Inspection and  Survey (he being made commodore February 28, 1896), until 1897, when he  was placed in command of the Asiatic squadron, much against his will.          CHAPTER III.    DEWEY IN THE WAR WITH SPAIN.      While engaged with his duties in Washington, Commodore Dewey found his  close confinement to work had affected his health. Naturally strong and  rugged, accustomed to the ozone of the ocean and toned up by the variety  of the service, even in times of peace, the monotony of a continual  round of the same duties told upon him, and his physician advised him to  apply for sea service. He knew the counsel was wise and he made  application, which was granted.    Assistant Secretary of War Theodore Roosevelt, after a careful study of  the record of the different naval commanders, was convinced that George  Dewey deserved one of the most important commands at the disposal of the  Government. The impetuous official was certain that war with Spain was  at hand, and that one of the most effective blows against that tyrannous  power could be struck in the far East, where the group of islands known  as the Philippines constituted her most princely possessions.    The assignment, as has been stated, was not pleasing to Dewey, because  he and others believed the real hard fighting must take place in  European or Atlantic waters. We all know the uneasiness that prevailed  for weeks over the destination of the Spanish fleet under Admiral  Cervera. Dewey wanted to meet him and do some fighting that would recall  his services when a lieutenant in the Civil War, and he saw no chance of  securing the chance on the other side of the world, but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1726"],[0,"Theaetetus (#4)"],[1," be!' 'Yes,  indeed,' replies Euclid; 'only just now I was hearing of his noble  conduct in the battle.' 'That I should expect; but why did he not remain  at Megara?' 'I wanted him to remain, but he would not; so I went with  him as far as Erineum; and as I parted from him, I remembered that  Socrates had seen him when he was a youth, and had a remarkable  conversation with him, not long before his own death; and he then  prophesied of him that he would be a great man if he lived.' 'How true  that has been; how like all that Socrates said! And could you repeat the  conversation?' 'Not from memory; but I took notes when I returned home,  which I afterwards filled up at leisure, and got Socrates to correct  them from time to time, when I came to Athens'...Terpsion had long  intended to ask for a sight of this writing, of which he had already  heard. They are both tired, and agree to rest and have the conversation  read to them by a servant...'Here is the roll, Terpsion; I need  only observe that I have omitted, for the sake of convenience, the  interlocutory words, \"said I,\" \"said he\"; and that Theaetetus, and  Theodorus, the geometrician of Cyrene, are the persons with whom  Socrates is conversing.'    Socrates begins by asking Theodorus whether, in his visit to Athens, he  has found any Athenian youth likely to attain distinction in science.  'Yes, Socrates, there is one very remarkable youth, with whom I have  become acquainted. He is no beauty, and therefore you need not imagine  that I am in love with him; and, to say the truth, he is very like you,  for he has a snub nose, and projecting eyes, although these features are  not so marked in him as in you. He combines the most various qualities,  quickness, patience, courage; and he is gentle as well as wise, always  silently flowing on, like a river of oil. Look! he is the middle one of  those who are entering the palaestra.'    Socrates, who does not know his name, recognizes him as the son of  Euphronius, who was himself a good man and a rich. He is informed by  Theodorus that the youth is named Theaetetus, but the property of his  father has disappeared in the hands of trustees; this does not, however,  prevent him from adding liberality to his other virtues. At the desire  of Socrates he invites Theaetetus to sit by them.    'Yes,' says Socrates, 'that I may see in you, Theaetetus, the image  of my ugly self, as Theodorus declares. Not that his remark is of any  importance; for though he is a philosopher, he is not a painter, and  therefore he is no judge of our faces; but, as he is a man of science,  he may be a judge of our intellects. And if he were to praise the mental  endowments of either of us, in that case the hearer of the eulogy ought  to examine into what he says, and the subject should not refuse to be  examined.' Theaetetus consents, and is caught in a trap (compare the  similar trap which is laid for Theodorus). 'Then, Theaetetus, you will  have to be examined, for Theodorus has been praising you in a style of  which I never heard the like.' 'He was only jesting.' 'Nay, that is not  his way; and I cannot allow you, on that pretence, to retract the assent  which you have already given, or I shall make Theodorus repeat your  praises, and swear to them.' Theaetetus, in reply, professes that he is  willing to be examined, and Socrates begins by asking him what he learns  of Theodorus. He is himself anxious to learn anything of anybody; and  now he has a little question to which he wants Theaetetus or Theodorus  (or whichever of the company would not be 'donkey' to the rest) to find  an answer. Without further preface, but at the same time apologizing  for his eagerness, he asks, 'What is knowledge?' Theodorus is too old  to answer questions, and begs him to interrogate Theaetetus, who has the  advantage of youth.    Theaetetus replies, that knowledge is what he learns of Theodorus,  i.e. geometry and arithmetic; and that there are other kinds of  knowledge--shoemaking, carpentering, and the like. But Socrates rejoins,  that this answer contains too much and also too little. For although  Theaetetus has enumerated several kinds of knowledge, he has not  explained the common nature of them; as if he had been asked, 'What is  clay?' and instead of saying 'Clay is moistened earth,' he had answered,  'There is one clay of image-makers, another of potters, another of  oven-makers.' Theaetetus at once divines that Socrates means him to  extend to all kinds of knowledge the same process of generalization  which he has already learned to apply to arithmetic. For he has  discovered a division of numbers into square numbers, 4, 9, 16, etc.,  which are composed of equal factors, and represent figures which have  equal sides, and oblong numbers, 3, 5, 6, 7, etc., which are composed of  unequal factors, and represent figures which have unequal sides. But  he has never succeeded in attaining a similar conception of knowledge,  though he has often tried; and, when this and similar questions were  brought to him from Socrates, has been sorely distressed by them.  Socrates explains to him that he is in labour. For men as well as  women have pangs of labour; and both at times require the assistance of  midwives. And he, Socrates, is a midwife, although this is a secret; he  has inherited the art from his mother bold and bluff, and he ushers into  light, not children, but the thoughts of men. Like the midwives, who are  'past bearing children,' he too can have no offspring--the God will not  allow him to bring anything into the world of his own. He also reminds  Theaetetus that the midwives are or ought to be the only matchmakers  (this is the preparation for a biting jest); for those who reap the  fruit are most likely to know on what soil the plants will grow. But  respectable midwives avoid this department of practice--they do not want  to be called procuresses. There are some other differences between the  two sorts of pregnancy. For women do not bring into the world at one  time real children and at another time idols which are with difficulty  distinguished from them. 'At first,' says Socrates in his character of  the man-midwife, 'my patients are barren and stolid, but after a while  they \"round apace,\" if the gods are propitious to them; and this is due  not to me but to themselves; I and the god only assist in bringing their  ideas to the birth. Many of them have left me too soon, and the result  has been that they have produced abortions; or when I have delivered  them of children they have lost them by an ill bringing up, and have  ended by seeing themselves, as others see them, to be great fools.  Aristides, the son of Lysimachus, is one of these, and there have been  others. The truants often return to me and beg to be taken back; and  then, if my familiar allows me, which is not always the case, I receive  them, and they begin to grow again. There come to me also those who have  nothing in them, and have no need of my art; and I am their matchmaker  (see above), and marry them to Prodicus or some other inspired sage who  is likely to suit them. I tell you this long story because I suspect  that you are in labour. Come then to me, who am a midwife, and the son  of a midwife, and I will deliver you. And do not bite me, as the women  do, if I abstract your first-born; for I am acting out of good-will  towards you; the God who is within me is the friend of man, though he  will not allow me to dissemble the truth. Once more then, Theaetetus,  I repeat my old question--\"What is knowledge?\" Take courage, and by the  help of God you will discover an answer.' 'My answer is, that knowledge  is perception.' 'That is the theory of Protagoras, who has another way  of expressing the same thing when he says, \"Man is the measure of all  things.\" He was a very wise man, and we should try to understand him.  In order to illustrate his meaning let me suppose that there is the same  wind blowing in our faces, and one of us may be hot and the other cold.  How is this? Protagoras will reply that the wind is hot to him who is  cold, cold to him who is hot. And \"is\" means \"appears,\" and when you  say \"appears to him,\" that means \"he feels.\" Thus feeling, appearance,  perception, coincide with being. I suspect, however, that this was only  a \"facon de parler,\" by which he imposed on the common herd like you and  me; he told \"the truth\" (in allusion to the title of his book, which  was called \"The Truth\") in secret to his disciples. For he was really  a votary of that famous philosophy in which all things are said to be  relative; nothing is great or small, or heavy or light, or one, but all  is in motion and mixture and transition and flux and generation, not  \"being,\" as we ignorantly affirm, but \"becoming.\" This has been the  doctrine, not of Protagoras only, but of all philosophers, with the  single exception of Parmenides; Empedocles, Heracleitus, and others, and  all the poets, with Epicharmus, the king of Comedy, and Homer, the king  of Tragedy, at their head, have said the same; the latter has these  words--    \"Ocean, whence the gods sprang, and mother Tethys.\"    And many arguments are used to show, that motion is the source of life,  and rest of death: fire and warmth are produced by friction, and living  creatures owe their origin to a similar cause; the bodily frame is  preserved by exercise and destroyed by indolence; and if the sun ceased  to move, \"chaos would come again.\" Now apply this doctrine of \"All  is motion\" to the senses, and first of all to the sense of sight. The  colour of white, or any other colour, is neither in the eyes nor out of  them, but ever in motion between the object and the eye, and varying in  the case of every percipient. All is relative, and, as the followers of  Protagoras remark, endless contradictions arise when we deny this; e.g.  here are six dice; they are more than four and less than twelve; \"more  and also less,\" would you"]]]
