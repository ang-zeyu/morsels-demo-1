The last number of _Fraser's Magazine_ has a long article upon THE  POETS AND POETRY OF AMERICA, in which the subject is treated with more  than the customary civility of English criticism upon this subject. We  are half inclined, indeed, to believe the article was written \"above  Bleecker,\" or by an inhabitant of that quarter now in London. Omitting  the illustrative extracts, we copy the greater portion of the review,  in which most of those who are admitted to be poets are characterized.    \"When Halleck said of New York--                Our fourteen wards    Contain some seven-and-thirty-bards,    he rather understated than exaggerated the fact. Mr. Griswold, besides  the ninety regular poets in his collection, gives an appendix of about  seventy fugitive pieces by as many authors; and bitter complaints  have been made against him in various quarters for not including  some seventy, or a hundred and seventy more, 'who,' it is said, and  probably with truth, 'have as good a right to be there as many of  those admitted.' Still it is possible to pick out a few of general  reputation, whom literati from all parts of the Union would agree  in sustaining as specimens of distinguished American poets, though  they would differ in assigning their relative position. Thus, if the  Republic had to choose a laureate, Boston would probably deposit a  nearly unanimous vote for Longfellow; the suffrages of New York might  he divided between Bryant and Halleck; and the southern cities would  doubtless give a large majority for Poe. But these gentlemen, and  some three or four more, would be acknowledged by all as occupying  the first rank. Perhaps, on the whole, the preponderance of native  authority justifies us in heading the list with Bryant, who, at any  rate, has the additional title of seniority in authorship, if not in  actual years.    \"William Cullen Bryant is, as we learn from Mr. Griswold, about  fifty-five years old, and was born in Massachusetts, though his  literary career is chiefly associated with New York, of which he is  a resident. With a precocity extraordinary, even in a country where  precocity is the rule instead of the exception, he began to write _and  publish_ at the age of thirteen, and has, therefore, been full forty  years before the American public, and that not in the capacity of  poet alone--having for more than half that period edited the _Evening  Post_, one of the ablest and most respectable papers in the United  States, and the oldest organ, we believe, of the Democratic party in  New York. He has been called, and with justice, a poet of nature.  The prairie solitude, the summer evening landscape, the night wind of  autumn, the water-bird flitting homeward through the twilight--such  are the favorite subjects of inspiration. _Thanatopsis_, one of  his most admired pieces, was written at the age of _eighteen_, and  exhibits a finish of style, no less than a maturity of thought, very  remarkable for so youthful a production. Mr. Bryant's poems have  been for some years pretty well known on this side the water,--better  known, at any rate, than any other transatlantic verses; on which  account, being somewhat limited for space, we forbear to make any  extracts from them.    \"FITZ-GREENE HALLECK is also a New-Englander by birth and a New Yorker  by adoption. He is Bryant's contemporary and friend, but the spirit  and style of his versification are very different; and so, it is  said, are his political affinities. While Bryant is a bulwark of  the Democracy, Halleck is reported to be not only an admirer of the  obsolete Federalists, but an avowed Monarchist. To be sure, this is  only his private reputation: no trace of such a feeling is observable  in his writings, which show throughout a sturdy vein of republicanism,  social and political. In truth, the party classification of American  literary men is apt to puzzle the uninitiated. Thus Washington Irving  is said to belong to the Democrats; but it would be hard to find in  his writings anything countenancing their claim upon him. His sketches  of English society are a panegyric of old institutions; and the fourth  book of his _Knickerbocker_ is throughout a palpable satire on the  administration of Thomas Jefferson, the great apostle of Democracy.  Perhaps, however, he may since have changed his views. Willis, too,  the 'Free Penciler,' who has been half his life prating about lords  and ladies, and great people, and has become a sort of Jenkins to  the fashionable life of New York; he also is one of the Democratic  party. Peradventure he may vote the 'Locofoco ticket' in the hope  of propitiating _the boys_ (as the _canaille_ of American cities are  properly called), and saving his printing-office from the fate of the  Italian Opera House in Astor Place. But what shall we say of Cooper,  who, by his anti-democratic opinions, has made himself one of the most  unpopular men in his country, and whose recent political novels rival  the writings of Judge Haliburton in the virulence as well as the  cleverness of their satire upon Republican institutions? He, too, is  a Democrat. To us, who are not behind the curtain, these things are  a mystery incapable of explanation. To return to our present subject.  Halleck made his _debut_ in the poetical world by some satirical  pieces called _The Croakers_, which created as much sensation at their  appearance as the anonymous _Salmagundi_ which commenced Irving's  literary career. These were succeeded by _Fanny_, a poem in the  _Don Juan_ metre. _Fanny_ has no particular plot or story, but is a  satirical review of all the celebrities, literary, fashionable, and  political, of New York at that day (1821). And the satire was probably  very good at the time and in the place; but, unfortunately for the  extent and permanence of its reputation, most of these celebrities are  utterly unknown, not merely beyond the limits of the Union, but beyond  those of New York. Among all the personages enumerated we can find  but two names that an European reader would be likely to know anything  about,--Clinton and Van Buren. Nay, more, in the rapid growth and  change of things American, the present generation of New Yorkers are  likely to lose sight of the lions of their immediate progenitors; and  unless some Manhattanese scholiast should write a commentary on the  poem in time, its allusions, and with them most of its wit, will be  in danger of perishing entirely. What we _can_ judge of in _Fanny_ are  one or two graceful lyrics interspersed in it, though even these are  marred by untimely comicality and local allusions. The nominal hero,  while wandering about at night after the wreck of his fortunes, hears  a band playing outside a public place of entertainment. It must have  been a better band than that which now, from the Museum opposite the  Astor House, drives to frenzy the hapless stranger.... In Halleck's  subsequent productions the influence of Campbell is more perceptible  than that of Byron, and with manifest advantage. It may be said of his  compositions, as it can be affirmed of few American verses, that they  have a real innate harmony, something not dependent on the number of  syllables in each line, or capable of being dissected out into feet,  but growing in them, as it were, and created by the fine ear of the  writer. Their sentiments, too, are exalted and ennobling; eminently  genial and honest, they stamp the author for a good man and  true,--Nature's aristocracy.... For some unexplained reason Halleck  has not written, or at least not published, anything new for several  years, though continually solicited to do so; for he is a great  favorite with his countrymen, especially with the New Yorkers. His  time, however, has been by no means passed in idleness. Fashionable  as writing is in America, it is not considered desirable or, indeed,  altogether reputable, that the poet should be _only_ a poet. Halleck  has been in business most of his life; and was lately head-clerk  of the wealthy merchant, John Jacob Astor, who left him a handsome  annuity. This was increased by Mr. Astor's son and heir, a man of  well-known liberality; so that between the two there is a chance  of the poet's being enabled to 'meditate the tuneful Muse' for the  remainder of his days free from all distractions of business.    \"LONGFELLOW, the pet poet of Boston, is a much younger man than either  Bryant or Halleck, and has made his reputation only within the last  twelve years, during which time he has been one of the most noted  lions of American Athens. The city of Boston, as every one knows who  has been there, or who has met with any book or man emanating from  it, claims to be the literary metropolis of the United States, and  assumes the slightly-pretending _soubriquet_ just quoted. The American  Athenians have their thinking and writing done for them by a coterie  whose distinctive characteristics are Socinianism in theology, a  praeter-Puritan prudery in ethics, a German tendency in metaphysics,  and throughout all a firm persuasion that Boston is the fountain-head  of art, scholarship, and literature for the western world, and  particularly that New York is a Nazareth in such things, out of which  can come nothing good. For the Bostonians, who certainly cultivate  literature with more general devotion, if not always with more  individual success than the New Yorkers, can never forgive their  commercial neighbors for possessing by birth the two most eminent  prose-writers of the country--Irving and Cooper; and by adoption, two  of the leading poets--Bryant and Halleck. Nor are the good people of  the 'Empire State' slow to resent these exhibitions of small jealousy;  but, on the contrary, as the way of the world is, they are apt to  retort by greater absurdities. So shy are they of appearing to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13647"],[0,"Nonsense Songs (#4)"],[1," so that Guy rushed back to the  boat, having first shied his cap into the middle of the custard-pudding, by  which means he completely spoiled the Mice's dinner.    [Illustration]    By and by the four children came to a country where there were no houses,  but only an incredibly innumerable number of large bottles without corks,  and of a dazzling and sweetly susceptible blue color. Each of these blue  bottles contained a Blue-Bottle-Fly; and all these interesting animals live  continually together in the most copious and rural harmony: nor perhaps in  many parts of the world is such perfect and abject happiness to be found.  Violet and Slingsby and Guy and Lionel were greatly struck with this  singular and instructive settlement; and, having previously asked  permission of the Blue-Bottle-Flies (which was most courteously granted),  the boat was drawn up to the shore, and they proceeded to make tea in front  of the bottles: but as they had no tea-leaves, they merely placed some  pebbles in the hot water; and the Quangle-Wangle played some tunes over it  on an accordion, by which, of course, tea was made directly, and of the  very best quality.    The four children then entered into conversation with the  Blue-Bottle-Flies, who discoursed in a placid and genteel manner, though  with a slightly buzzing accent, chiefly owing to the fact that they each  held a small clothes-brush between their teeth, which naturally occasioned  a fizzy, extraneous utterance.    \"Why,\" said Violet, \"would you kindly inform us, do you reside in bottles;  and, if in bottles at all, why not, rather, in green or purple, or, indeed,  in yellow bottles?\"    To which questions a very aged Blue-Bottle-Fly answered, \"We found the  bottles here all ready to live in; that is to say, our great-great-great-  great-great-grandfathers did: so we occupied them at once. And, when the  winter comes on, we turn the bottles upside down, and consequently rarely  feel the cold at all; and you know very well that this could not be the  case with bottles of any other color than blue.\"    \"Of course it could not,\" said Slingsby. \"But, if we may take the liberty  of inquiring, on what do you chiefly subsist?\"    \"Mainly on oyster-patties,\" said the Blue-Bottle-Fly; \"and, when these are  scarce, on raspberry vinegar and Russian leather boiled down to a jelly.\"    \"How delicious!\" said Guy.    To which Lionel added, \"Huzz!\" And all the Blue-Bottle-Flies said, \"Buzz!\"    At this time, an elderly Fly said it was the hour for the evening-song to  be sung; and, on a signal being given, all the Blue-Bottle-Flies began to  buzz at once in a sumptuous and sonorous manner, the melodious and  mucilaginous sounds echoing all over the waters, and resounding across the  tumultuous tops of the transitory titmice upon the intervening and verdant  mountains with a serene and sickly suavity only known to the truly  virtuous. The Moon was shining slobaciously from the star-bespangled sky,  while her light irrigated the smooth and shiny sides and wings and backs of  the Blue-Bottle-Flies with a peculiar and trivial splendor, while all  Nature cheerfully responded to the cerulean and conspicuous circumstances.    In many long-after years, the four little travellers looked back to that  evening as one of the happiest in all their lives; and it was already past  midnight when--the sail of the boat having been set up by the  Quangle-Wangle, the tea-kettle and churn placed in their respective  positions, and the Pussy-Cat stationed at the helm--the children each took  a last and affectionate farewell of the Blue-Bottle-Flies, who walked down  in a body to the water's edge to see the travellers embark.    [Illustration]    As a token of parting respect and esteem, Violet made a courtesy quite down  to the ground, and stuck one of her few remaining parrot-tail feathers into  the back hair of the most pleasing of the Blue-Bottle-Flies; while  Slingsby, Guy, and Lionel offered them three small boxes, containing,  respectively, black pins, dried figs, and Epsom salts; and thus they left  that happy shore forever.    Overcome by their feelings, the four little travellers instantly jumped  into the tea-kettle, and fell fast asleep. But all along the shore, for  many hours, there was distinctly heard a sound of severely-suppressed sobs,  and of a vague multitude of living creatures using their  pocket-handkerchiefs in a subdued simultaneous snuffle, lingering sadly  along the walloping waves as the boat sailed farther and farther away from  the Land of the Happy Blue-Bottle-Flies.    Nothing particular occurred for some days after these events, except that,  as the travellers were passing a low tract of sand, they perceived an  unusual and gratifying spectacle; namely, a large number of Crabs and  Crawfish--perhaps six or seven hundred--sitting by the water-side, and  endeavoring to disentangle a vast heap of pale pink worsted, which they  moistened at intervals with a fluid composed of lavender-water and  white-wine negus.    \"Can we be of any service to you, O crusty Crabbies?\" said the four  children.    \"Thank you kindly,\" said the Crabs consecutively. \"We are trying to make  some worsted mittens, but do not know how.\"    On which Violet, who was perfectly acquainted with the art of  mitten-making, said to the Crabs, \"Do your claws unscrew, or are they  fixtures?\"    \"They are all made to unscrew,\" said the Crabs; and forthwith they  deposited a great pile of claws close to the boat, with which Violet  uncombed all the pale pink worsted, and then made the loveliest mittens  with it you can imagine. These the Crabs, having resumed and screwed on  their claws, placed cheerfully upon their wrists, and walked away rapidly  on their hind-legs, warbling songs with a silvery voice and in a minor key.    After this, the four little people sailed on again till they came to a vast  and wide plain of astonishing dimensions, on which nothing whatever could  be discovered at first; but, as the travellers walked onward, there  appeared in the extreme and dim distance a single object, which on a nearer  approach, and on an accurately cutaneous inspection, seemed to be somebody  in a large white wig, sitting on an arm-chair made of sponge-cakes and  oyster-shells. \"It does not quite look like a human being,\" said Violet  doubtfully; nor could they make out what it really was, till the  Quangle-Wangle (who had previously been round the world) exclaimed softly  in a loud voice, \"It is the co-operative Cauliflower!\"    [Illustration]    And so, in truth, it was: and they soon found that what they had taken for  an immense wig was in reality the top of the Cauliflower; and that he had  no feet at all, being able to walk tolerably well with a fluctuating and  graceful movement on a single cabbage-stalk,--an accomplishment which  naturally saved him the expense of stockings and shoes.    Presently, while the whole party from the boat was gazing at him with  mingled affection and disgust, he suddenly arose, and, in a somewhat  plumdomphious manner, hurried off towards the setting sun,--his steps  supported by two superincumbent confidential Cucumbers, and a large number  of Waterwagtails proceeding in advance of him by three and three in a  row,--till he finally disappeared on the brink of the western sky in a  crystal cloud of sudorific sand.    [Illustration]    So remarkable a sight, of course, impressed the four children very deeply;  and they returned immediately to their boat with a strong sense of  undeveloped asthma and a great appetite.    Shortly after this, the travellers were obliged to sail directly below some  high overhanging rocks, from the top of one of which a particularly odious  little boy, dressed in rose-colored knickerbockers, and with a pewter plate  upon his head, threw an enormous pumpkin at the boat, by which it was  instantly upset.    [Illustration]    But this upsetting was of no consequence, because all the party knew how to  swim very well: and, in fact, they preferred swimming about till after the  moon rose; when, the water growing chilly, they sponge-taneously entered  the boat. Meanwhile the Quangle-Wangle threw back the pumpkin with immense  force, so that it hit the rocks where the malicious little boy in  rose-colored knickerbockers was sitting; when, being quite full of  lucifer-matches, the pumpkin exploded surreptitiously into a thousand bits;  whereon the rocks instantly took fire, and the odious little boy became  unpleasantly hotter and hotter and hotter, till his knickerbockers were  turned quite green, and his nose was burnt off.    Two or three days after this had happened, they came to another place,  where they found nothing at all except some wide and deep pits full of  mulberry-jam. This is the property of the tiny, yellow-nosed Apes who  abound in these districts, and who store up the mulberry-jam for their food  in winter, when they mix it with pellucid pale periwinkle-soup, and serve  it out in wedgewood china-bowls, which grow freely all over that part of  the country. Only one of the yellow-nosed Apes was on the spot, and he was  fast asleep; yet the four travellers and the Quangle-Wangle and Pussy were  so terrified by the violence and sanguinary sound of his snoring, that they  merely took a small cupful of the jam, and returned to re-embark in their  boat without delay.    What was their horror on seeing the boat (including the churn and the  tea-kettle) in the mouth of an enormous Seeze Pyder, an aquatic and  ferocious creature truly dreadful to behold, and, happily, only met with in  those excessive longitudes! In a moment, the beautiful boat was bitten into  fifty-five thousand million hundred billion bits; and it instantly became  quite clear that Violet, Slingsby, Guy, and Lionel could no longer  preliminate their voyage by sea.    The four travellers were therefore obliged to resolve on pursuing their  wanderings by land: and, very"]]]
