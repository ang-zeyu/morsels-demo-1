God being its author, it is called the  _divine law_; and, being found in the Holy Scriptures, in which his will  is revealed to mankind, it is called the _revealed law_, or _law of  revelation_.    Sec.5. _Political law_, as has been observed, is that system or form of  fundamental rules, called the constitution, by which the people in their  political capacity, or as a body politic, agree to be governed. The  nature of this law will more clearly appear from a more particular  definition of constitution, and from a description of the manner in  which a constitution is made. (Chap. V.)    Sec.6. The word _municipal_ was used by the Romans to designate that which  related to a _municipium_, which was a free town, or city. The rights of  a citizen of such free city or town were called _municipal rights_, and  its officers were called _municipal officers_. In this country, the word  is not only used in this limited sense, but is extended to what  pertains to a state. Hence the body of laws which prescribe the duties  of the citizens of a state, are called the _municipal_ or _civil law_.  And the term is used to distinguish the laws made by the legislature, or  law-making power of the state, from the constitution, or political law,  adopted by the people in their political capacity.    Sec.7. If, as has been said, the laws of the Creator form a perfect rule of  conduct for all mankind, and ought in all cases to be obeyed, then all  human law ought to agree with the divine law. If a human law is contrary  to the divine law, or if it requires us to disobey the commands of God,  it is not binding, and should not be obeyed. So the Scriptures teach.  They speak approvingly of men who disobeyed human authority, and who  gave as the reason, that it was their duty to obey God rather than men;  and they furnish many examples of good men who submitted to severe  punishment, even to death, rather than do what they knew to be contrary  to the divine will.    Sec.8. But although the divine will as revealed in the Scriptures, is a  perfect rule or law for all mankind, and although human laws ought to  conform to the divine law, yet it would be impossible to govern the  people of a state by that law alone. The divine law is broad, and  comprehends rules to teach men their whole duty; but it does not specify  every particular act of duty. Much of it consists of general principles  to which particular acts must be made to conform. It requires men to  deal justly with each other; but men do not always agree as to what is  right. Human laws, therefore, become necessary to declare what shall be  considered just and right between man and man.    Sec.9. It may be observed, further, that all the divine precepts could not  be carried into effect in civil government. They are spiritual, and  reach to the thoughts and intents of the heart. They require us to love  our Creator supremely, and our neighbor as ourselves; in other words, to  do to others as we would that they should do to us. But as the  omniscient God only knows when men fail in these duties, no human  authority could enforce such a law. Human laws, therefore, have respect  chiefly to the outward acts of men, and are designed to regulate their  intercourse with each other.    Sec.10. Although the laws of the state can not compel men to fulfill the  great law of love, it is nevertheless morally binding upon all. A  perfectly holy Creator could consistently require of his moral and  accountable creatures nothing less than supreme love to himself, and  equal love to one another. This, as has been remarked, is in accordance  with the law of nature, which is right in the nature of things. (Chap.  III. Sec.2, 3.)    Sec.11. While the divine law accords perfectly with the principles of  natural justice, the giving of it to mankind manifests the wisdom and  benevolence of the supreme Lawgiver. Man is so formed, that it is for  his highest happiness strictly to obey this law. The generous man, in  relieving the wants of others, contributes to his own happiness. The boy  who divides an apple with his fellow, is more happy than he would be if  he retained the whole to himself. It is generally true, that, in  performing acts of kindness and charity to others, we most effectually  promote our own happiness, and feel the saying to be true, \"It is more  blessed to give than to receive.\"          Chapter IV.    Different Forms of Government. Monarchy; Aristocracy; Democracy;  Republic.        Sec.1. Governments have existed in a great variety of forms. The earliest  governments of which we have any knowledge, are the patriarchal.  _Patriarch_, from the Greek, _pater_, father, and _arkos_, chief, or  head, means the father and ruler of a family. This kind of government  prevailed in the early ages of the world, and in a state of society in  which the people dwelt together in families or tribes, and were not yet  formed into states or nations. The patriarchal government existed before  the flood, and for a long period afterward. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,  the fathers of the Hebrew race, as also the sons of Jacob, the heads of  the twelve tribes, were called patriarchs.    Sec.2. After their departure from Egypt, the government of the Hebrews was  a _theocracy_. This word is from _theos_, God, and _kratos_, power, and  signifies a government by the immediate direction of God. The laws by  which they were governed were given to them on Mount Sinai by God  himself, their leader and king. This theocratic form of government, with  some changes, existed until the coming of the Messiah.    Sec.3. But the forms of government which have most prevailed, are  designated by the terms, monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy, or  republic. These words severally indicate by what persons, and in what  manner, the governing power of a state is exercised. This power is  usually called the _sovereign_, or _supreme_ power. Where kings rule,  they are called sovereign; and where the power is in the hands of the  people, the people are sovereign. In the strict sense of the term,  however, entire sovereignty, or supreme power, exists only where power  is exercised by one man, or a single body of men, uncontrolled or  unrestrained by laws or by any other power. But in a more general sense,  it is that power in a state which is superior to all other powers within  the same.    Sec.4. A form of government in which the supreme power is in the hands of  one person, is called a monarchy. The word _monarch_ is from two Greek  words, _monos_ sole or only, and _arkos_, a chief; and is a general name  for a single ruler, whether he is called king, emperor, or prince. A  government in which all power resides in or proceeds from one person, is  an _absolute_ monarchy. If the power of the monarch is restrained by  laws or by some other power, it is called a _limited_ monarchy.    Sec.5. A monarchy is called _hereditary_ in which the throne passes from  father to son, or from the monarch to his successor, by inheritance. On  the death of a sovereign, the eldest son is usually heir to the crown;  or if there is no son, it falls to the daughter, or some other relative.  A monarchy is _elective_, where, on the death of the ruler, his  successor is appointed by an election. A few such monarchies have  existed.    Sec.6. An absolute monarchy is sometimes called _despotism_. The word  _despot_ is from the Greek, and means _master_, or _lord_. It has nearly  the same meaning as _tyrant_, which also is from the Greek, and  signifies _king_. These words at first meant simply a single ruler. They  are now applied, for the most part, to rulers who exercise authority  over their subjects with severity. In an absolute despotism, the monarch  has entire control over his subjects. They have no law but the will of  the ruler, who has at command a large force of armed men to keep his  people in subjection. The governments of Russia and Turkey are highly  despotic.    Sec.7. An _aristocracy_ is a form of government in which the power is  exercised by a privileged order of men, distinguished for their rank and  wealth. The word _aristocracy_ is from the Greek word _aristos_, best,  and _kratos_, power, or _krateo_, to govern; and means a government of  the best. It is also used for the nobility of a country under a  monarchical government. _Nobles_ are persons of rank above the common  people, and bear some title of honor. The titles of the English nobility  are those of duke, marquis, earl, viscount, and baron. These titles are  hereditary, being derived from birth. In some cases they are conferred  upon persons by the king.    Sec.8. A _democracy_ is a government of the people; the word democracy  being from the Greek _demos_, the people, and _krateo_, to govern. In a  government purely democratic, the great body of freemen meet in one  assembly to make and execute the laws. There were some such governments  in ancient Greece; but they necessarily comprised small territories,  scarcely more than a single town. The freemen of a state could not all  meet in a single assembly.    Sec.9. The government of this country, though a government of the people,  is not one of the kind just described; it is a republic. A _republic_ is  a government in which the power to enact and execute the laws is  exercised by representatives, who are persons elected by the people to  act for them. Yet, as not only the election of representatives, but the  adoption of the constitution or form of government itself is the act of  the people; and as, therefore, all power comes from the people, the  government is also democratic; and is properly called a _democratic  republic_, or a _representative democracy_.    Sec.10. A republic is sometimes also called a _commonwealth_. _Common_  signifies general, and is applied to what belongs to or is used by the  people generally. _Weal_ means welfare or happiness. _Wealth_ also was  formerly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15323"],[0,"The Green Eyes of Bâst (#4)"],[1,"and the whole of one side lay  in fragments on the floor; but upon a board which had formed part of  the top I perceived the figure of a cat roughly traced in green paint.    Beyond any shadow of doubt this crate was the same which on the night  before had lain in the garage of the Red House!          CHAPTER III    THE GREEN IMAGE      \"Yes,\" said Gatton, \"I was speaking no more than the truth when I told  them that you had special information which I hoped you would place at  my disposal. Some of the particulars were given to me over the 'phone,  you see, and I was glad to find you here when I arrived. I should have  consulted you in any event, and principally about--that.\"    He pointed to an object which I held in my hand. It was a little green  enamel image; the crouching figure of a woman having a cat's head, a  piece of Egyptian workmanship probably of the fourth century B.C.  Considered in conjunction with the figure painted upon the crate, the  presence of this little image was so amazing a circumstance that from  the moment when it had been placed in my hand I had stood staring at  it almost dazedly.    The divisional surgeon had gone, and only the local officer remained  with Gatton and myself in the building. Sir Marcus Coverly presented  all the frightful appearance of one who has died by asphyxia, and  although of course there would be an autopsy, little doubt existed  respecting the mode of his death. The marks of violence found upon the  body could be accounted for by the fact that the crate had fallen a  distance of thirty feet into the hold, and the surgeon was convinced  that the injuries to the body had all been received after death, death  having taken place in his opinion fully twelve hours before.    \"You see,\" said Gatton, \"when the crate broke several things which  presumably were in Sir Marcus' pockets were found lying loose amongst  the wreckage. That cat-woman was one of them.\"    \"Yet it may not have been in any of his pockets at all,\" said I.    \"It _may_ not,\" agreed Gatton. \"But that it was somewhere in the crate  is beyond dispute, I think. Besides this is more than a coincidence.\"    And he pointed to the painted cat upon the lid of the packing-case. I  had already told him of the episode at the Red House on the previous  night, and now:    \"The fates are on our side,\" I said, \"for at least we know where the  crate was despatched from.\"    \"Quite so,\" agreed Gatton. \"We should have got that from the carter  later, of course, but every minute saved in an affair such as this is  worth considering. As a pressman you will probably disagree with me,  but I propose to suppress these two pieces of evidence. Premature  publication of clews too often handicaps us. Now, what _is_ that  figure exactly?\"    \"It is a votive offering of a kind used in Ancient Egypt by pilgrims  to Bubastis. It is a genuine antique, and if you think the history of  such relics is likely to assist the investigation I can give you some  further particulars this evening if you have time to call at my  place.\"    \"I think,\" said Gatton, taking the figure from me and looking at it  with a singular expression on his face, \"that the history of the thing  is very important. The fact that a rough reproduction of a somewhat  similar figure is painted upon the case cannot possibly be a  coincidence.\"    I stared at him silently for a moment, then:    \"You mean that the crate was specially designed to contain the body?\"  I asked.    \"I am certainly of that opinion,\" declared Inspector Heath, the local  officer. \"It is of just the right size and shape for the purpose.\"    Once more I began to examine the fragments stacked upon the floor, and  then I looked again at the several objects which lay beside the crate.  They were the personal belongings of the dead baronet and the police  had carefully noted in which of his pockets each object had been  found. He was in evening dress and a light top-coat had been packed  into the crate beside him. In this had been found a cigar-case and a  pair of gloves; a wallet containing L20 in Treasury notes and a number  of cards and personal papers had fallen out of the crate together with  the cat statuette. The face of his watch was broken. It had been in  his waistcoat pocket but it still ticked steadily on where it lay  there beside its dead owner. A gold-mounted malacca cane also figured  amongst the relics of the gruesome crime; so that whatever had been  the object of the murderer, that of robbery was out of the question.    \"The next thing to do,\" said Gatton, \"is to trace Sir Marcus's  movements from the time that he left home last night to the time that  he met his death. I am going out now to 'phone to the Yard. We ought  to have succeeded in tracing the carter who brought the crate here  before the evening. I personally shall proceed to Sir Marcus's rooms  and then to this Red House around which it seems to me that the  mystery centers.\"    He put the enamel figure into his pocket and taking up the broken  board which bore the painted cat:    \"You are carrying a top-coat,\" he said. \"Hide this under it!\"    He turned to Inspector Heath, nodding shortly.    \"All right,\" he said, with a grim smile, \"go out now and talk to the  crowd!\"    Having issued certain telephonic instructions touching the carter who  had delivered the crate to the docks, and then imparting to the  representatives of the press a guarded statement for publication,  Inspector Gatton succeeded in wedging himself into my little  two-seater and ere long we were lurching and bumping along the  ill-paved East-end streets.    The late Sir Marcus's London address, which had been unknown to me, we  had learned from his cards, and it was with the keenest anticipation  of a notable discovery that I presently found myself with Gatton  mounting the stairs to the chambers of the murdered baronet.    At the very moment of our arrival the door was opened and a man--quite  obviously a constable in plain clothes--came out. Behind him I  observed one whom I took to be the late Sir Marcus's servant, a  pathetic and somewhat disheveled figure.    \"Hello, Blythe!\" said Gatton, \"who instructed you to come here?\"    \"Sir Marcus's man--Morris--telephoned the Yard,\" was the reply, \"as he  couldn't understand what had become of his master and I was sent along  to see him.\"    \"Oh,\" said Gatton, \"very good. Report to me in due course.\"    Blythe departed, and Gatton and I entered the hall. The man, Morris,  closed the door, and led us into a small library. Beside the telephone  stood a tray bearing decanter and glasses, and there was evidence that  Morris had partaken of a hurried breakfast consisting only of biscuits  and whisky and soda.    \"I haven't been to bed all night, gentlemen,\" he began the moment that  we entered the room. \"Sir Marcus was a good master and if he was  sleeping away from home he never failed to advise me, so that I knew  even before the dreadful news reached me that something was amiss.\"    He was quite unstrung and his voice was unsteady. The reputation of  the late baronet had been one which I personally did not envy him, but  whatever his faults, and I knew they had been many, he had evidently  possessed the redeeming virtue of being a good employer.    \"A couple of hours' sleep would make a new man of you,\" said Gatton  kindly. \"I understand your feelings, but no amount of sorrow can mend  matters, unfortunately. Now, I don't want to worry you, but there are  one or two points which I must ask you to clear up. In the first place  did you ever see this before?\"    From his pocket he took out the little figure of Bast, the  cat-goddess, and held it up before Morris.    The man stared at it with lack-luster eyes, scratching his unshaven  chin; then he shook his head slowly.    \"Never,\" he declared. \"No, I am positive I never saw a figure like  that before.\"    \"Then, secondly,\" continued Gatton, \"was your master ever in Egypt?\"    \"Not that I am aware of; certainly not since I have been with him--six  years on the thirty-first of this month.\"    \"Ah,\" said Gatton. \"Now, when did you last see Sir Marcus?\"    \"At half-past six last night, sir. He was dining at his club and then  going to the New Avenue Theater. I booked a seat for him myself.\"    \"He was going alone, then?\"    \"Yes.\"    Gatton glanced at me significantly and I experienced an uncomfortable  thrill. In the inspector's glance I had read that he suspected the  presence of a woman in the case and at the mention of the New Avenue  Theater it had instantly occurred to me that Isobel Merlin was  appearing there! Gatton turned again to Morris.    \"Sir Marcus had not led you to suppose that there was any likelihood  of his _not_ returning last night?\"    \"No, sir; that was why, knowing his regular custom, I became so  alarmed when he failed to come back or to 'phone.\"    Gatton stared hard at the speaker and:    \"It will be no breach of confidence on your part,\" he said, speaking  slowly and deliberately, \"for you to answer my next question. The best  service you can do your late master now will be to help us to  apprehend his murderer.\"    He paused a moment, then:    \"Was Sir Marcus interested in some one engaged at the New Avenue  Theater?\" he asked.    Morris glanced from face to face in a pathetic, troubled fashion. He  rubbed the stubble on his chin again and hesitated. Finally:    \"I believe,\" he replied, \"that there was a lady there who--\"    He paused, swallowing, and:    \"Yes,\" Gatton prompted, \"who--?\"    \"Who--interested Sir Marcus; but I don't know her name nor anything  about her,\" he declared. \"I knew about--some of the others, but Sir  Marcus was--very reserved about this lady, which made me think--\"    \"Yes?\"    \"That he perhaps hadn't been so successful.\"    Morris ceased speaking and sat staring at a bookcase vacantly.    \"Ah,\" murmured Gatton. Then, abruptly: \"Did Sir Marcus ever visit any  one who lived in College Road?\""]]]
