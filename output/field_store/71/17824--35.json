Contrast an east country Scot, descendant of Teutonic stock, with a West  Highlander, and the difference leaps to the eyes. Celts and Germans of  history differ, then, in relative fairness, character, religion, and  language.    The tall, blonde Teutonic type of the Row graves is dolichocephalic. Was  the Celtic type (assuming that Broca's \"Celts\" were not true Celts)  dolicho or brachy? Broca thinks the Belgae or \"Kymri\" were  dolichocephalic, but all must agree with him that the skulls are too few  to generalise from. Celtic iron-age skulls in Britain are  dolichocephalic, perhaps a recrudescence of the aboriginal type. Broca's  \"Kymric\" skulls are mesocephalic; this he attributes to crossing with  the short round-heads. The evidence is too scanty for generalisation,  while the Walloons, perhaps descendants of the Belgae, have a high index,  and some Gauls of classical art are broad-headed.[19]    Skulls of the British round barrows (early Celtic Bronze Age) are mainly  broad, the best specimens showing affinity to Neolithic brachycephalic  skulls from Grenelle (though their owners were 5 inches shorter),  Selaigneaux, and Borreby.[20] Dr. Beddoe thinks that the narrow-skulled  Belgae on the whole reinforced the meso- or brachycephalic round barrow  folk in Britain. Dr. Thurnam identifies the latter with the Belgae  (Broca's Kymri), and thinks that Gaulish skulls were round, with  beetling brows.[21] Professors Ripley and Sergi, disregarding their  difference in stature and higher cephalic index, identify them with the  short Alpine race (Broca's Celts). This is negatived by Mr. Keane.[22]  Might not both, however, have originally sprung from a common stock and  reached Europe at different times?[23]    But do a few hundred skulls justify these far-reaching conclusions  regarding races enduring for thousands of years? At some very remote  period there may have been a Celtic type, as at some further period  there may have been an Aryan type. But the Celts, as we know them, must  have mingled with the aborigines of Europe and become a mixed race,  though preserving and endowing others with their racial and mental  characteristics. Some Gauls or Belgae were dolichocephalic, to judge by  their skulls, others were brachycephalic, while their fairness was a  relative term. Classical observers probably generalised from the higher  classes, of a purer type; they tell us nothing of the people. But the  higher classes may have had varying skulls, as well as stature and  colour of hair,[24] and Irish texts tell of a tall, fair, blue-eyed  stock, and a short, dark, dark-eyed stock, in Ireland. Even in those  distant ages we must consider the people on whom the Celts impressed  their characteristics, as well as the Celts themselves. What happened on  the Eurasian steppe, the hypothetical cradle of the \"Aryans,\" whence the  Celts came \"stepping westwards,\" seems clear to some, but in truth is a  book sealed with seven seals. The men whose Aryan speech was to dominate  far and wide may already have possessed different types of skull, and  that age was far from \"the very beginning.\"    Thus the Celts before setting out on their _Wanderjahre_ may already  have been a mixed race, even if their leaders were of purer stock. But  they had the bond of common speech, institutions, and religion, and they  formed a common Celtic type in Central and Western Europe. Intermarriage  with the already mixed Neolithic folk of Central Europe produced further  removal from the unmixed Celtic racial type; but though both reacted on  each other as far as language, custom, and belief were concerned, on the  whole the Celtic elements predominated in these respects. The Celtic  migration into Gaul produced further racial mingling with descendants of  the old palaeolithic stock, dolichocephalic Iberians and Ligurians, and  brachycephalic swarthy folk (Broca's Celts). Thus even the first Celtic  arrivals in Britain, the Goidels, were a people of mixed race, though  probably relatively purer than the late coming Brythons, the latest of  whom had probably mingled with the Teutons. Hence among Celtic-speaking  folk or their descendants--short, dark, broad-beaded Bretons, tall, fair  or rufous Highlanders, tall chestnut-haired Welshmen or Irishmen,  Highlanders of Norse descent, short, dark, narrow-headed Highlanders,  Irishmen, and Welshmen--there is a common Celtic _facies_, the result of  old Celtic characteristics powerful enough so to impress themselves on  such varied peoples in spite of what they gave to the Celtic incomers.  These peoples became Celtic, and Celtic in speech and character they  have remained, even where ancestral physical types are reasserting  themselves. The folk of a Celtic type, whether pre-Celtic, Celtic, or  Norse, have all spoken a Celtic language and exhibit the same old Celtic  characteristics--vanity, loquacity, excitability, fickleness,  imagination, love of the romantic, fidelity, attachment to family ties,  sentimental love of their country, religiosity passing over easily to  superstition, and a comparatively high degree of sexual morality. Some  of these traits were already noted by classical observers.    Celtic speech had early lost the initial _p_ of old Indo-European  speech, except in words beginning with _pt_ and, perhaps, _ps_. Celtic  _pare_ (Lat. _prae_) became _are_, met with in _Aremorici_, \"the dwellers  by the sea,\" _Arecluta_, \"by the Clyde,\" the region watered by the  Clyde. Irish _athair_, Manx _ayr_, and Irish _iasg_, represent  respectively Latin _pater_ and _piscis_. _P_ occurring between vowels  was also lost, e.g. Irish _caora_, \"sheep,\" is from _kaperax_; _for_,  \"upon\" (Lat. _super_), from _uper_. This change took place before the  Goidelic Celts broke away and invaded Britain in the tenth century B.C.,  but while Celts and Teutons were still in contact, since Teutons  borrowed words with initial _p_, e.g. Gothic _fairguni_, \"mountain,\"  from Celtic _percunion_, later _Ercunio_, the Hercynian forest. The loss  must have occurred before 1000 B.C. But after the separation of the  Goidelic group a further change took place. Goidels preserved the sound  represented by _qu_, or more simply by _c_ or _ch_, but this was changed  into _p_ by the remaining continental Celts, who carried with them into  Gaul, Spain, Italy, and Britain (the Brythons) words in which _q_ became  _p_. The British _Epidii_ is from Gaulish _epos_, \"horse,\" which is in  Old Irish _ech_ (Lat. _equus_). The Parisii take their name from  _Qarisii_, the Pictones or Pictavi of Poictiers from _Pictos_ (which in  the plural _Pidi_ gives us \"Picts\"), derived from _quicto_. This change  took place after the Goidelic invasion of Britain in the tenth century  B.C. On the other hand, some continental Celts may later have regained  the power of pronouncing _q_. In Gaul the _q_ of _Sequana_ (Seine) was  not changed to _p_, and a tribe dwelling on its banks was called the  Sequani. This assumes that Sequana was a pre-Celtic word, possibly  Ligurian.[25] Professor Rh[^y]s thinks, however, that Goidelic tribes,  identified by him with Caesar's Celtae, existed in Gaul and Spain before  the coming of the Galli, and had preserved _q_ in their speech. To them  we owe Sequana, as well as certain names with _q_ in Spain.[26] This at  least is certain, that Goidelic Celts of the _q_ group occupied Gaul and  Spain before reaching Britain and Ireland. Irish tradition and  archaeological data confirm this.[27] But whether their descendants were  represented by Caesar's \"Celtae\" must be uncertain. Celtae and Galli,  according to Caesar, were one and the same,[28] and must have had the  same general form of speech.    The dialects of Goidelic speech--Irish, Manx, Gaelic, and that of the  continental Goidels--preserved the _q_ sound; those of Gallo-Brythonic  speech--Gaulish, Breton, Welsh, Cornish--changed _q_ into _p_. The  speech of the Picts, perhaps connected with the Pictones of Gaul, also  had this _p_ sound. Who, then, were the Picts? According to Professor  Rh[^y]s they were pre-Aryans,[29] but they must have been under the  influence of Brythonic Celts. Dr. Skene regarded them as Goidels  speaking a Goidelic dialect with Brythonic forms.[30] Mr. Nicholson  thinks they were Goidels who had preserved the Indo-European _p_.[31]  But might they not be descendants of a Brythonic group, arriving early  in Britain and driven northwards by newcomers? Professor Windisch and  Dr. Stokes regard them as Celts, allied to the Brythons rather than to  the Goidels, the phonetics of their speech resembling those of Welsh  rather than Irish.[32]    The theory of an early Goidelic occupation of Britain has been contested  by Professor Meyer,[33] who holds that the first Goidels reached Britain  from Ireland in the second century, while Dr. MacBain[34] was of the  opinion that England, apart from Wales and Cornwall, knew no Goidels,  the place-names being Brythonic. But unless all Goidels reached Ireland  from Gaul or Spain, as some did, Britain was more easily reached than  Ireland by migrating Goidels from the Continent. Prominent Goidelic  place-names would become Brythonic, but insignificant places would  retain their Goidelic form, and to these we must look for decisive  evidence.[35] A Goidelic occupation by the ninth century B.C. is  suggested by the name \"Cassiterides\" (a word of the _q_ group) applied  to Britain. If the Goidels occupied Britain first, they may have called  their land _Qretanis_ or _Qritanis_, which Pictish invaders would change  to _Pretanis_, found in Welsh \"Ynys Pridain,\" Pridain's Isle, or Isle of  the Picts, \"pointing to the original underlying the Greek [Greek: "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14674"],[0,"Ten Great Religions: An Essay in Comparative Theology (#4)"],[1,"hands\";  _absolute_,--\"not needing anything,\" but the source of all things. He says  this, as not expecting any opposition or contradiction; he reserves his  criticisms on their idolatry for the end of his discourse. He then states,  quite clearly, that the different nations of the world have a common  origin, belong to one family, and have been providentially placed in space  and time, that each might seek the Lord in its own way. He recognized in  them a power of seeking and finding God, the God close at hand, and in  whom we live; and he quotes one of their own poets, accepting his  statement of God's fatherly character. Now, it is quite common for those  who deny that there is any truth in heathenism, to admire this speech of  Paul as a masterpiece of ingenuity and eloquence. But he would hardly have  made it, unless he thought it to be true. Those who praise his eloquence  at the expense of his veracity pay him a poor compliment. Did Paul tell  the Athenians that they were worshipping the true God _when they were  not_, and that for the sake of rhetorical effect? If we believe this  concerning him, and yet admire him, let us cease henceforth to find fault  with the Jesuits.    No! Paul believed what he said, that the Athenians were worshipping the  true God, though ignorantly. The sentiment of reverence, of worship, was  lifting them to its true object. All they needed was to have their  understanding enlightened. Truth he placed in the heart rather than the  understanding, but he also connected Christianity with Polytheism where  the two religions touched, that is, on their pantheistic side. While  placing God _above_ the world as its ruler, \"seeing he is Lord of heaven  and earth,\" he placed him _in_ the world as an immanent presence,--\"in him  we live, and move, and have our being.\" And afterward, in writing to the  Romans, he takes the same ground. He teaches that the Gentiles had a  knowledge of the eternal attributes of God (Rom. i. 19) and saw him in his  works (v. 20), and that they also had in their nature a law of duty,  enabling them to do the things contained in the law. This he calls \"the  law written in the heart\" (Rom. ii. 14,15). He blames them, not for  ignorance, but for disobedience. The Apostle Paul, therefore, agrees with  us in finding in heathen religions essential truth in connection with  their errors.    The early Christian apologists often took the same view. Thus Clement of  Alexandria believed that God had one great plan for educating the world,  of which Christianity was the final step. He refused to consider the  Jewish religion as the only divine preparation for Christianity, but  regarded the Greek philosophy as also a preparation for Christ. Neander  gives his views at length, and says that Clement was the founder of the  true view of history.[6] Tertullian declared the soul to be naturally  Christian. The Sibylline books were quoted as good prophetic works along  with the Jewish prophets. Socrates was called by the Fathers a Christian  before Christ.    Within the last few years the extravagant condemnation of the heathen  religions has produced a reaction in their favor. It has been felt to be  disparaging to human nature to suppose that almost the whole human race  should consent to be fed on error. Such a belief has been seen to be a  denial of God's providence, as regards nine tenths of mankind. Accordingly  it has become more usual of late to rehabilitate heathenism, and to place  it on the same level with Christianity, if not above it. The _Vedas_ are  talked about as though they were somewhat superior to the Old Testament,  and Confucius is quoted as an authority quite equal to Paul or John. An  ignorant admiration of the sacred books of the Buddhists and Brahmins has  succeeded to the former ignorant and sweeping condemnation of them. What  is now needed is a fair and candid examination and comparison of these  systems from reliable sources.        Sec. 5. Comparative Theology will furnish a new Class of Evidences in Support  of Christianity.      Such an examination, doing full justice to all other religions,  acknowledging their partial truth and use, will not depreciate, but exalt  the value of Christianity. It will furnish a new kind of evidence in its  favor. But the usual form of argument may perhaps be changed.    Is Christianity a supernatural or a natural religion? Is it a religion  attested to be from God by miracles? This has been the great question in  evidences for the last century. The truth and divine origin of  Christianity have been made to depend on its supernatural character, and  to stand or fall with a certain view of miracles. And then, in order to  maintain the reality of miracles, it became necessary to prove the  infallibility of the record; and so we were taught that, to believe in  Jesus Christ, we must first believe in the genuineness and authenticity of  the whole New Testament. \"All the theology of England,\" says Mr.  Pattison,[7] \"was devoted to proving the Christian religion credible, in  this manner.\" \"The apostles,\" said Dr. Johnson, \"were being tried one a  week for the capital crime of forgery.\" This was the work of the school of  Lardner, Paley, and Whately.    But the real question between Christians and unbelievers in Christianity  is, not whether our religion is or is not supernatural; not whether  Christ's miracles were or not violations of law; nor whether the New  Testament, as it stands, is the work of inspired men. The main question,  back of all these, is different, and not dependent on the views we may  happen to take of the universality of law. It is this: Is Christianity, as  taught by Jesus, intended by God to be the religion of the human race? Is  it only one among natural religions? is it to be superseded in its turn by  others, or is it the one religion which is to unite all mankind? \"Art thou  he that should come, or look we for another?\" This is the question which  we ask of Jesus of Nazareth, and the answer to which makes the real  problem of apologetic theology.    Now the defenders of Christianity have been so occupied with their special  disputes about miracles, about naturalism and supernaturalism, and about  the inspiration and infallibility of the apostles, that they have left  uncultivated the wide field of inquiry belonging to Comparative Theology.  But it belongs to this science to establish the truth of Christianity by  showing that it possesses all the aptitudes which fit it to be the  religion of the human race.    This method of establishing Christianity differs from the traditional  argument in this: that, while the last undertakes to _prove_ Christianity  to be true, this _shows_ it to be true. For if we can make it appear, by a  fair survey of the principal religions of the world, that, while they are  ethnic or local, Christianity is catholic or universal; that, while they  are defective, possessing some truths and wanting others, Christianity  possesses all; and that, while they are stationary, Christianity is  progressive; it will not then be necessary to discuss in what sense it is  a supernatural religion. Such a survey will show that it is adapted to the  nature of man. When we see adaptation we naturally infer design. If  Christianity appears, after a full comparison with other religions, to be  the one and only religion which is perfectly adapted to man, it will be  impossible to doubt that it was designed by God to be the religion of our  race; that it is the providential religion sent by God to man, its truth  God's truth its way the way to God and to heaven.        Sec. 6. It will show that, while most of the Religions of the World are  Ethnic, or the Religions of Races, Christianity is Catholic, or adapted to  become the Religion of all Races.      By ethnic religions we mean those religions, each of which has always been  confined within the boundaries of a particular race or family of mankind,  and has never made proselytes or converts, except accidentally, outside of  it. By catholic religions we mean those which have shown the desire and  power of passing over these limits, and becoming the religion of a  considerable number of persons belonging to different races.    Now we are met at once with the striking and obvious fact, that most of  the religions of the world are evidently religions limited in some way to  particular races or nations. They are, as we have said, _ethnic_. We use  this Greek word rather than its Latin equivalent, _gentile_, because  _gentile_, though meaning literally \"of, or belonging to, a race,\" has  acquired a special sense from its New Testament use as meaning all who are  not Jews. The word \"ethnic\" remains pure from any such secondary or  acquired meaning, and signifies simply _that which belongs to a race_.    The science of ethnology is a modern one, and is still in the process of  formation. Some of its conclusions, however, may be considered as  established. It has forever set aside Blumenbach's old classification of  mankind into the Caucasian and four other varieties, and has given us,  instead, a division of the largest part of mankind into Indo-European,  Semitic, and Turanian families, leaving a considerable penumbra outside as  yet unclassified.    That mankind is so divided into races of men it would seem hardly possible  to deny. It is proved by physiology, by psychology, by glossology, and by  civil history. Physiology shows us anatomical differences between races.  There are as marked and real differences between the skull of a Hindoo and  that of a Chinaman as between the skulls of an Englishman and a negro.  There is not as great a difference, perhaps, but it is as real and as  constant. Then the characters of races remain distinct, the same traits  reappearing after many centuries exactly as at first. We find the same  difference of character between the Jews and Arabs, who are merely  different families of the same Semitic"]]]
