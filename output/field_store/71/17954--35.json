With  some hesitation we shall probably again answer \"No.\" It is, we think,  not a rite, but merely a superstitious practice of ignorant men and  women. But take another instance. Among the Omaha Indians of North  America, when the corn is withering for want of rain, the members of the  sacred Buffalo Society fill a large vessel with water and dance four  times round it. One of them drinks some of the water and spirts it into  the air, making a fine spray in imitation of mist or drizzling rain.  Then he upsets the vessel, spilling the water on the ground; whereupon  the dancers fall down and drink up the water, getting mud all over their  faces. This saves the corn. Now probably any dispassionate person would  describe such a ceremonial as \"an interesting instance of primitive  _ritual_.\" The sole difference between the two types is that, in the one  the practice is carried on privately, or at least unofficially, in the  other it is done publicly by a collective authorized body, officially  for the public good.    The distinction is one of high importance, but for the moment what  concerns us is, to see the common factor in the two sets of acts, what  is indeed their source and mainspring. In the case of the girl dancing  in the hoop and leaping out of it there is no doubt. The words she says,  \"Flax, grow,\" prove the point. She _does_ what she _wants done_. Her  intense desire finds utterance in an act. She obeys the simplest  possible impulse. Let anyone watch an exciting game of tennis, or better  still perhaps a game of billiards, he will find himself _doing_ in  sheer sympathy the thing he wants done, reaching out a tense arm where  the billiard cue should go, raising an unoccupied leg to help the  suspended ball over the net. Sympathetic magic is, modern psychology  teaches us, in the main and at the outset, not the outcome of  intellectual illusion, not even the exercise of a \"mimetic instinct,\"  but simply, in its ultimate analysis, an utterance, a discharge of  emotion and longing.    But though the utterance of emotion is the prime and moving, it is not  the sole, factor. We may utter emotion in a prolonged howl, we may even  utter it in a collective prolonged howl, yet we should scarcely call  this ritual, still less art. It is true that a prolonged _collective_  howl will probably, because it is collective, develop a rhythm, a  regular recurrence, and hence probably issue in a kind of ritual music;  but for the further stage of development into art another step is  necessary. We must not only _utter_ emotion, we must _represent_ it,  that is, we must in some way reproduce or imitate or express the thought  which is causing us emotion. Art is not imitation, but art and also  ritual frequently and legitimately _contain an element of imitation_.  Plato was so far right. What exactly is imitated we shall see when we  come to discuss the precise difference between art and ritual.           *       *       *       *       *    The Greek word for a _rite_ as already noted is _dromenon_, \"a thing  done\"--and the word is full of instruction. The Greek had realized that  to perform a rite you must _do_ something, that is, you must not only  feel something but express it in action, or, to put it psychologically,  you must not only receive an impulse, you must react to it. The word for  rite, _dromenon_, \"thing done,\" arose, of course, not from any  psychological analysis, but from the simple fact that rites among the  primitive Greeks were _things done_, mimetic dances and the like. It is  a fact of cardinal importance that their word for theatrical  representation, _drama_, is own cousin to their word for rite,  _dromenon_; _drama_ also means \"thing done.\" Greek linguistic instinct  pointed plainly to the fact that art and ritual are near relations. To  this fact of crucial importance for our argument we shall return later.  But from the outset it should be borne in mind that in these two Greek  words, _dromenon_ and _drama_, in their exact meaning, their relation  and their distinction, we have the keynote and clue to our whole  discussion.           *       *       *       *       *    For the moment we have to note that the Greek word for rite, _dromenon_,  \"thing done,\" is not strictly adequate. It omits a factor of prime  importance; it includes too much and not enough. All \"things done\" are  not rites. You may shrink back from a blow; that is the expression of an  emotion, that is a reaction to a stimulus, but that is not a rite. You  may digest your dinner; that is a thing done, and a thing of high  importance, but it is not a rite.    One element in the rite we have already observed, and that is, that it  be done collectively, by a number of persons feeling the same emotion. A  meal digested alone is certainly no rite; a meal eaten in common, under  the influence of a common emotion, may, and often does, _tend_ to become  a rite.    Collectivity and emotional tension, two elements that tend to turn the  simple reaction into a rite, are--specially among primitive  peoples--closely associated, indeed scarcely separable. The individual  among savages has but a thin and meagre personality; high emotional  tension is to him only caused and maintained by a thing felt socially;  it is what the tribe feels that is sacred, that is matter for ritual. He  may make by himself excited movements, he may leap for joy, for fear;  but unless these movements are made by the tribe together they will not  become rhythmical; they will probably lack intensity, and certainly  permanence. Intensity, then, and collectivity go together, and both are  necessary for ritual, but both may be present without constituting art;  we have not yet touched the dividing line between art and ritual. When  and how does the _dromenon_, the _rite done_, pass over into the  _drama_?    The genius of the Greek language _felt_, before it consciously _knew_,  the difference. This feeling ahead for distinctions is characteristic of  all languages, as has been well shown by Mr. Pearsall Smith[6] in  another manual of our series. It is an instinctive process arising  independently of reason, though afterwards justified by it. What, then,  is the distinction between art and ritual which the genius of the Greek  language felt after, when it used the two words _dromenon_ and _drama_  for two different sorts of \"things done\"? To answer our question we must  turn for a brief moment to psychology, the science of human behaviour.           *       *       *       *       *    We are accustomed for practical convenience to divide up our human  nature into partitions--intellect, will, the emotions, the  passions--with further subdivisions, _e.g._ of the intellect into  reason, imagination, and the like. These partitions we are apt to  arrange into a sort of order of merit or as it is called a hierarchy,  with Reason as head and crown, and under her sway the emotions and  passions. The result of establishing this hierarchy is that the  impulsive side of our nature comes off badly, the passions and even the  emotions lying under a certain ban. This popular psychology is really a  convenient and perhaps indispensable mythology. Reason, the emotions,  and the will have no more separate existences than Jupiter, Juno, and  Minerva.    A more fruitful way of looking at our human constitution is to see it,  not as a bundle of separate faculties, but as a sort of continuous  cycle of activities. What really happens is, putting it very roughly,  something of this sort. To each one of us the world is, or seems to be,  eternally divided into two halves. On the one side is ourself, on the  other all the rest of things. All our action, our behaviour, our life,  is a relation between these two halves, and that behaviour seems to have  three, not divisions, but stages. The outside world, the other half, the  object if we like so to call it, acts upon us, gets at us through our  senses. We hear or see or taste or feel something; to put it roughly, we  perceive something, and as we perceive it, so, instantly, we feel about  it, towards it, we have emotion. And, instantly again, that emotion  becomes a motive-power, we _re_-act towards the object that got at us,  we want to alter it or our relation to it. If we did not perceive we  should not feel, if we did not feel we should not act. When we talk--as  we almost must talk--of Reason, the Emotions, or the Passions and the  Will leading to action, we think of the three stages or aspects of our  behaviour as separable and even perhaps hostile; we want, perhaps, to  purge the intellect from all infection of the emotions. But in reality,  though at a given moment one or the other element, knowing, feeling, or  acting, may be dominant in our consciousness, the rest are always  immanent.    When we think of the three elements or stages, knowing, feeling,  striving, as all being necessary factors in any complete bit of human  behaviour, we no longer try to arrange them in a hierarchy with knowing  or reason at the head. Knowing--that is, receiving and recognizing a  stimulus from without--would seem to come first; we must be acted on  before we can _re_-act; but priority confers no supremacy. We can look  at it another way. Perceiving is the first rung on the ladder that leads  to action, feeling is the second, action is the topmost rung, the  primary goal, as it were, of all the climbing. For the purpose of our  discussion this is perhaps the simplest way of looking at human  behaviour.           *       *       *       *       *    Movement, then, action, is, as it were, the goal and the end of thought.  Perception finds its natural outlet and completion in doing. But here  comes in a curious consideration important for our purpose. In animals,  in so far as they act by \"instinct,\" as we say, perception, knowing, is  usually followed immediately and inevitably by doing, by such doing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17132"],[0,"The Makers of Canada: Champlain (#4)"],[1,"from the _Privilege du Roi_, dated November 15th, 1603, signed by  Brigard.    The second edition does not differ much from the preceding, and its  title bears the date 1604. Purchas's _Pilgrims_ contains an English  version of this last edition. We find a synopsis of it in the _Mercure  Francois_, 1609, in the preface to the former called _Chronologie  Septennaire de l'Histoire de la paix entre les rois de France et  d'Espagne, 1598-1608_. This historical part has been borrowed by Victor  Palma Cayet for Champlain's Voyage, and its title is: _Navigation des  Francais en la Nouvelle France dite Canada_.          CHAPTER II    ACADIA--STE. CROIX ISLAND--PORT ROYAL      Soon after the period mentioned at the close of the previous chapter,  Pierre du Gua, Sieur de Monts, Governor of Pont, a native of the ancient  province of Saintonge, who had served under Henry IV, obtained a  commission as \"Lieutenant general au pays de Cadie, du 40 deg. au 46 deg.,\" on  the condition that his energies should be especially directed to the  propagation of the Catholic faith.    De Monts was a Huguenot; nevertheless he agreed to take with him to  America a number of Catholic priests, and to see that they were  respected and obeyed. Champlain was not satisfied with the choice of a  Protestant to colonize a country which he had intended to make solely  Catholic, and he states, \"that those enterprises made hastily never  succeed.\"    De Monts was not a stranger to America. He had first visited the country  with Chauvin in 1600, but when he left Tadousac he was so discouraged  that he determined, in the event of his becoming master of the  situation, to attempt colonization only in Acadia, or on the eastern  borders of the Atlantic running towards Florida.    It was well known in France that Acadia was the richest and most  fertile part of the New World. Excellent harbours and good soil were  found there. Fish abounded near its coasts; its forests were numerous  and dense. An opinion existed that there were numerous mines, rich in  copper, coal and gypsum. This country was also the favourite of the  Normans, Britons and Basques, who for a hundred years had pursued their  callings as fishermen or traders without interruption.    De Monts, however, was unable to bear the expense of this undertaking  alone, and he consequently formed a company, composed of merchants of  Rouen, La Rochelle and other towns. To further the enterprise Henry IV  diminished the duty on merchandises exported from Acadia and Canada, and  granted to the company the exclusive privilege of fur trading for a  period of ten years, \"from Cape de Raze to the 40 deg., comprising all the  Acadian coast, Cape Breton, Baie des Chaleurs, Perce Island, Gaspe,  Chisedec, Miramichi, Tadousac and Canada River, from either side, and  all the bays and rivers which flow within these shores.\"    Acadia of that day was not confined to the peninsula of our own time,  called Nova Scotia. It included that part of the continent which extends  from the river St. John to the Penobscot. These boundaries were the  cause of long quarrels and fierce and bloody wars between England and  France until they were finally settled by the Treaty of Utrecht. In the  early part of April, 1604, the king's proclamation confining the fur  trade to de Monts and his associates was published in every harbour of  France. Four ships were lying at anchor at Havre de Grace, ready to  sail, and one hundred and twenty passages had been secured in two of the  ships. Pont-Grave commanded one of the vessels of one hundred and twenty  tons burthen, and another vessel of one hundred and fifty tons was under  the charge of de Monts, who had taken on board Jean de Biencourt, Sieur  de Poutrincourt, a gentleman of Picardy, Samuel Champlain, some Catholic  priests and some Protestant ministers. Poutrincourt was going to America  with the intention of residing there with his family. He was a good  Catholic and a loyal subject. Champlain was attached to de Monts'  expedition as geographer and historian.    The rendezvous had been fixed at Canseau, but de Monts proceeded  directly to Port au Mouton on the Acadian coast, where he decided to  await the arrival of Pont-Grave. In the meantime Champlain explored the  country from Port au Mouton to Port Sainte Marguerite, now called St.  Mary's Bay. This occupied a whole month. He also named Cape Negre, Cape  Fourchu and Long Island. Champlain reported to de Monts that St. Mary's  Bay was a suitable place to establish a settlement, and, following this  advice, the lieutenant-general proceeded with Champlain to this bay, and  further explored the Bay of Fundy, or French Bay. They soon perceived  the entrance to another splendid port, which is now known as Annapolis  Bay, or Port Royal.    Notwithstanding the authority of Lescarbot, Champlain was the first to  give this place the name of Port Royal, for he says himself, \"I have  named this harbour Port Royal.\" When de Monts named the place La Baie  Francaise, Champlain did not hesitate to give to his chief the merit  which he deserved.    Three rivers flow into this splendid harbour: the Riviere de l'Equille,  so called from a little fish of the size of our _eperlan_ or _lancon_,  which is found there in large quantities; the river named St. Antoine by  Champlain, and a stream called de la Roche by Champlain, and de  l'Orignac by Lescarbot.    After having explored the harbour, Champlain traversed La Baie Francaise  to see whether he could discover the copper mine mentioned by Prevert of  St. Malo, and he soon arrived at a place which he named the Cape of Two  Bays, or Chignecto, and perceived the High Islands, where a copper mine  was found.    On May 20th an expedition started from the Port of Mines, in search of a  place suitable for a permanent settlement. Proceeding towards the  south-west they stopped at the entrance of a large river, which was  named St. John, as it was on St. John's day that they arrived there. The  savages called the river Ouigoudi. \"This river is dangerous,\" writes  Champlain, \"if one does not observe carefully certain points and rocks  on the two sides. It is so narrow at its entrance and then becomes  broader. A certain point being passed it becomes narrower again, and  forms a kind of fall between two large cliffs, where the water runs so  rapidly that a piece of wood thrown in is drawn under and not seen  again. But by waiting till high tide you can pass this fall very easily.  Then it expands again to the extent of about a league in some places  where there are three islands.\"    Champlain did not explore the river further, but he ascertained a few  days later that the Indians used the river in their journeys to  Tadousac, making but a short portage on the way.    As preparations had shortly to be made for winter quarters, de Monts  decided to proceed southwards, and the party at length came to a number  of islands at the entrance of the river Ste. Croix, or Des Etchemins.  One of these islands was chosen for their establishment, and named Ste.  Croix, \"because,\" says Lescarbot, \"they perceived two leagues above this  island two streams flowing into the channel of the river, presenting the  appearance of a cross.\" De Monts at once commenced to fortify the place  by forming a barricade on a little inlet, which served as a station on  which he set up a cannon; it was situated halfway between the mainland  and the island of Ste. Croix. Some days afterwards all the French who  were waiting in St. Mary's Bay disembarked on the island. They were all  eager and willing to work, and commenced to render the place habitable.  They erected a storehouse and a residence for de Monts, and built an  oven and a hand-mill for grinding wheat. Some gardens were also laid  out, and various kinds of seeds were sown, which flourished well on the  mainland, though not on the island, which was too sandy.    De Monts was anxious to ascertain the location of a mine of pure copper  which had been spoken of, and accordingly he despatched Champlain, with  a savage named Messamouet, who asserted that he could find the place. At  about eight leagues from the island, near the river St. John, they found  a mine of copper, which, however, was not pure, though fairly good.  According to the report of the miner, it would yield about eighteen per  cent. Lescarbot says that amidst the rocks, diamonds and some blue and  clear stones could be found as precious as turquoises. Champdore, one of  the carpenters, took one of these stones to France, and had it divided  into many fragments and mounted by an artist. De Monts and Poutrincourt,  to whom they were presented, considered these gems so valuable that they  offered them to the king. A goldsmith offered Poutrincourt fifteen crown  pieces for one of them.    Agriculture did not flourish on the island of Ste. Croix, which is about  half a league in circumference. The rays of the sun parched the sand so  that the gardens were entirely unproductive, and there was a complete  dearth of water. At the commencement there was a fair quantity of wood,  but when the buildings were finished there was scarcely any left; the  inhabitants, consequently, nearly perished from cold in the winter. All  the liquor, wine and beer became frozen, and as there was no water the  people were compelled to drink melted snow. A malignant epidemic of  scurvy broke out, and of seventy-nine persons thirty-five died from the  disease and more than twenty were at the point of death.    This disease proved one of the obstacles to rapid colonization in New  France. It was epidemic, contagious and often fatal. It is a somewhat  remarkable fact that the epidemic was prevalent amongst the French only  when they were established on the soil, being rarely discovered on  ship-board. Jacques Cartier had experienced the horrors of this disease  in the winter of 1535-6, when out of his one hundred and ten men  twenty-five died, "]]]
