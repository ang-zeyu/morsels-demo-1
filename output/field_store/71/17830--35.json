He was naturally more eloquent, had a ready  plenty of words; and sometimes, as I thought, bore me down more by his  fluency than by the strength of his reasons.  As we parted without  settling the point, and were not to see one another again for some  time, I sat down to put my arguments in writing, which I copied fair  and sent to him.  He answered, and I replied.  Three or four letters of  a side had passed, when my father happened to find my papers and read  them.  Without entering into the discussion, he took occasion to talk  to me about the manner of my writing; observed that, though I had the  advantage of my antagonist in correct spelling and pointing (which I  ow'd to the printing-house), I fell far short in elegance of  expression, in method and in perspicuity, of which he convinced me by  several instances.  I saw the justice of his remark, and thence grew  more attentive to the manner in writing, and determined to endeavor at  improvement.    About this time I met with an odd volume of the Spectator.  It was the  third.  I had never before seen any of them.  I bought it, read it over  and over, and was much delighted with it.  I thought the writing  excellent, and wished, if possible, to imitate it.  With this view I  took some of the papers, and, making short hints of the sentiment in  each sentence, laid them by a few days, and then, without looking at  the book, try'd to compleat the papers again, by expressing each hinted  sentiment at length, and as fully as it had been expressed before, in  any suitable words that should come to hand.  Then I compared my  Spectator with the original, discovered some of my faults, and  corrected them.  But I found I wanted a stock of words, or a readiness  in recollecting and using them, which I thought I should have acquired  before that time if I had gone on making verses; since the continual  occasion for words of the same import, but of different length, to suit  the measure, or of different sound for the rhyme, would have laid me  under a constant necessity of searching for variety, and also have  tended to fix that variety in my mind, and make me master of it.  Therefore I took some of the tales and turned them into verse; and,  after a time, when I had pretty well forgotten the prose, turned them  back again.  I also sometimes jumbled my collections of hints into  confusion, and after some weeks endeavored to reduce them into the best  order, before I began to form the full sentences and compleat the  paper.  This was to teach me method in the arrangement of thoughts.  By  comparing my work afterwards with the original, I discovered many  faults and amended them; but I sometimes had the pleasure of fancying  that, in certain particulars of small import, I had been lucky enough  to improve the method or the language, and this encouraged me to think  I might possibly in time come to be a tolerable English writer, of  which I was extremely ambitious.  My time for these exercises and for  reading was at night, after work or before it began in the morning, or  on Sundays, when I contrived to be in the printing-house alone, evading  as much as I could the common attendance on public worship which my  father used to exact on me when I was under his care, and which indeed  I still thought a duty, though I could not, as it seemed to me, afford  time to practise it.    When about 16 years of age I happened to meet with a book, written by  one Tryon, recommending a vegetable diet.  I determined to go into it.  My brother, being yet unmarried, did not keep house, but boarded  himself and his apprentices in another family.  My refusing to eat  flesh occasioned an inconveniency, and I was frequently chid for my  singularity.  I made myself acquainted with Tryon's manner of preparing  some of his dishes, such as boiling potatoes or rice, making hasty  pudding, and a few others, and then proposed to my brother, that if he  would give me, weekly, half the money he paid for my board, I would  board myself.  He instantly agreed to it, and I presently found that I  could save half what he paid me.  This was an additional fund for  buying books.  But I had another advantage in it.  My brother and the  rest going from the printing-house to their meals, I remained there  alone, and, despatching presently my light repast, which often was no  more than a bisket or a slice of bread, a handful of raisins or a tart  from the pastry-cook's, and a glass of water, had the rest of the time  till their return for study, in which I made the greater progress, from  that greater clearness of head and quicker apprehension which usually  attend temperance in eating and drinking.    And now it was that, being on some occasion made asham'd of my  ignorance in figures, which I had twice failed in learning when at  school, I took Cocker's book of Arithmetick, and went through the whole  by myself with great ease.  I also read Seller's and Shermy's books of  Navigation, and became acquainted with the little geometry they  contain; but never proceeded far in that science.  And I read about  this time Locke On Human Understanding, and the Art of Thinking, by  Messrs. du Port Royal.    While I was intent on improving my language, I met with an English  grammar (I think it was Greenwood's), at the end of which there were  two little sketches of the arts of rhetoric and logic, the latter  finishing with a specimen of a dispute in the Socratic method; and soon  after I procur'd Xenophon's Memorable Things of Socrates, wherein there  are many instances of the same method.  I was charm'd with it, adopted  it, dropt my abrupt contradiction and positive argumentation, and put  on the humble inquirer and doubter.  And being then, from reading  Shaftesbury and Collins, become a real doubter in many points of our  religious doctrine, I found this method safest for myself and very  embarrassing to those against whom I used it; therefore I took a  delight in it, practis'd it continually, and grew very artful and  expert in drawing people, even of superior knowledge, into concessions,  the consequences of which they did not foresee, entangling them in  difficulties out of which they could not extricate themselves, and so  obtaining victories that neither myself nor my cause always deserved.  I continu'd this method some few years, but gradually left it,  retaining only the habit of expressing myself in terms of modest  diffidence; never using, when I advanced any thing that may possibly be  disputed, the words certainly, undoubtedly, or any others that give the  air of positiveness to an opinion; but rather say, I conceive or  apprehend a thing to be so and so; it appears to me, or I should think  it so or so, for such and such reasons; or I imagine it to be so; or it  is so, if I am not mistaken.  This habit, I believe, has been of great  advantage to me when I have had occasion to inculcate my opinions, and  persuade men into measures that I have been from time to time engag'd  in promoting; and, as the chief ends of conversation are to inform or  to be informed, to please or to persuade, I wish well-meaning, sensible  men would not lessen their power of doing good by a positive, assuming  manner, that seldom fails to disgust, tends to create opposition, and  to defeat every one of those purposes for which speech was given to us,  to wit, giving or receiving information or pleasure.  For, if you would  inform, a positive and dogmatical manner in advancing your sentiments  may provoke contradiction and prevent a candid attention.  If you wish  information and improvement from the knowledge of others, and yet at  the same time express yourself as firmly fix'd in your present  opinions, modest, sensible men, who do not love disputation, will  probably leave you undisturbed in the possession of your error.  And by  such a manner, you can seldom hope to recommend yourself in pleasing  your hearers, or to persuade those whose concurrence you desire.  Pope  says, judiciously:              \"Men should be taught as if you taught them not,            And things unknown propos'd as things forgot;\"    farther recommending to us              \"To speak, tho' sure, with seeming diffidence.\"    And he might have coupled with this line that which he has coupled with  another, I think, less properly,              \"For want of modesty is want of sense.\"    If you ask, Why less properly? I must repeat the lines,              \"Immodest words admit of no defense,            For want of modesty is want of sense.\"    Now, is not want of sense (where a man is so unfortunate as to want it)  some apology for his want of modesty? and would not the lines stand  more justly thus?              \"Immodest words admit but this defense,            That want of modesty is want of sense.\"    This, however, I should submit to better judgments.    My brother had, in 1720 or 1721, begun to print a newspaper.  It was  the second that appeared in America, and was called the New England  Courant.  The only one before it was the Boston News-Letter. I remember  his being dissuaded by some of his friends from the undertaking, as not  likely to succeed, one newspaper being, in their judgment, enough for  America.  At this time (1771) there are not less than five-and-twenty.  He went on, however, with the undertaking, and after having worked in  composing the types and printing off the sheets, I was employed to  carry the papers thro' the streets to the customers.    He had some ingenious men among his friends, who amus'd themselves by  writing little pieces for this paper, which gain'd it credit and made  it more in demand, and these gentlemen often visited us.  Hearing their  conversations, and their accounts of the approbation their papers were  received with, I was excited to try my hand among them; but, being  still a boy, and suspecting that my brother would object "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1480"],[0,"Tom Brown's School Days (#4)"],[1,"path, and the women in bright-coloured handkerchiefs standing  in the sterns steering. Standing I say, but you could never see whether  they were standing or sitting, all but their heads and shoulders being  out of sight in the cozy little cabins which occupied some eight feet of  the stern, and which Tom Brown pictured to himself as the most desirable  of residences. His nurse told him that those good-natured-looking women  were in the constant habit of enticing children into the barges, and  taking them up to London and selling them, which Tom wouldn't  believe, and which made him resolve as soon as possible to accept the  oft-proffered invitation of these sirens to \"young master\" to come in  and have a ride. But as yet the nurse was too much for Tom.    Yet why should I, after all, abuse the gadabout propensities of my  countrymen? We are a vagabond nation now, that's certain, for better  for worse. I am a vagabond; I have been away from home no less than five  distinct times in the last year. The Queen sets us the example: we are  moving on from top to bottom. Little dirty Jack, who abides in Clement's  Inn gateway, and blacks my boots for a penny, takes his month's  hop-picking every year as a matter of course. Why shouldn't he? I'm  delighted at it. I love vagabonds, only I prefer poor to rich ones.  Couriers and ladies'-maids, imperials and travelling carriages, are an  abomination unto me; I cannot away with them. But for dirty Jack, and  every good fellow who, in the words of the capital French song, moves  about,         \"Comme le limacon,       Portant tout son bagage,       Ses meubles, sa maison,\"    on his own back, why, good luck to them, and many a merry roadside  adventure, and steaming supper in the chimney corners of roadside inns,  Swiss chalets, Hottentot kraals, or wherever else they like to go. So,  having succeeded in contradicting myself in my first chapter (which  gives me great hopes that you will all go on, and think me a good fellow  notwithstanding my crotchets), I shall here shut up for the present,  and consider my ways; having resolved to \"sar' it out,\" as we say in the  Vale, \"holus bolus\" just as it comes, and then you'll probably get the  truth out of me.        CHAPTER II--THE \"VEAST.\"         \"And the King commandeth and forbiddeth, that from       henceforth neither fairs nor markets be kept in Churchyards,       for the honour of the Church.\"--STATUTES : 13 Edw. I. Stat.       II. cap. vi.    As that venerable and learned poet (whose voluminous works we all think  it the correct thing to admire and talk about, but don't read often)  most truly says, \"The child is father to the man;\" a fortiori,  therefore, he must be father to the boy. So as we are going at any rate  to see Tom Brown through his boyhood, supposing we never get any farther  (which, if you show a proper sense of the value of this history, there  is no knowing but what we may), let us have a look at the life and  environments of the child in the quiet country village to which we were  introduced in the last chapter.    Tom, as has been already said, was a robust and combative urchin, and at  the age of four began to struggle against the yoke and authority of his  nurse. That functionary was a good-hearted, tearful, scatter-brained  girl, lately taken by Tom's mother, Madam Brown, as she was called, from  the village school to be trained as nurserymaid. Madam Brown was a rare  trainer of servants, and spent herself freely in the profession; for  profession it was, and gave her more trouble by half than many people  take to earn a good income. Her servants were known and sought after for  miles round. Almost all the girls who attained a certain place in the  village school were taken by her, one or two at a time, as housemaids,  laundrymaids, nurserymaids, or kitchenmaids, and after a year or two's  training were started in life amongst the neighbouring families, with  good principles and wardrobes. One of the results of this system was the  perpetual despair of Mrs. Brown's cook and own maid, who no sooner had  a notable girl made to their hands than missus was sure to find a good  place for her and send her off, taking in fresh importations from the  school. Another was, that the house was always full of young girls, with  clean, shining faces, who broke plates and scorched linen, but made an  atmosphere of cheerful, homely life about the place, good for every one  who came within its influence. Mrs. Brown loved young people, and in  fact human creatures in general, above plates and linen. They were more  like a lot of elder children than servants, and felt to her more as a  mother or aunt than as a mistress.    Tom's nurse was one who took in her instruction very slowly--she seemed  to have two left hands and no head; and so Mrs. Brown kept her on longer  than usual, that she might expend her awkwardness and forgetfulness upon  those who would not judge and punish her too strictly for them.    Charity Lamb was her name. It had been the immemorial habit of the  village to christen children either by Bible names, or by those of the  cardinal and other virtues; so that one was for ever hearing in the  village street or on the green, shrill sounds of \"Prudence! Prudence!  thee cum' out o' the gutter;\" or, \"Mercy! drat the girl, what bist thee  a-doin' wi' little Faith?\" and there were Ruths, Rachels, Keziahs,  in every corner. The same with the boys: they were Benjamins, Jacobs,  Noahs, Enochs. I suppose the custom has come down from Puritan times.  There it is, at any rate, very strong still in the Vale.    Well, from early morning till dewy eve, when she had it out of him in  the cold tub before putting him to bed, Charity and Tom were pitted  against one another. Physical power was as yet on the side of Charity,  but she hadn't a chance with him wherever headwork was wanted. This  war of independence began every morning before breakfast, when Charity  escorted her charge to a neighbouring farmhouse, which supplied the  Browns, and where, by his mother's wish, Master Tom went to drink whey  before breakfast. Tom had no sort of objection to whey, but he had a  decided liking for curds, which were forbidden as unwholesome; and there  was seldom a morning that he did not manage to secure a handful of hard  curds, in defiance of Charity and of the farmer's wife. The latter good  soul was a gaunt, angular woman, who, with an old black bonnet on the  top of her head, the strings dangling about her shoulders, and her  gown tucked through her pocket-holes, went clattering about the dairy,  cheese-room, and yard, in high pattens. Charity was some sort of niece  of the old lady's, and was consequently free of the farmhouse and  garden, into which she could not resist going for the purposes of gossip  and flirtation with the heir-apparent, who was a dawdling fellow, never  out at work as he ought to have been. The moment Charity had found her  cousin, or any other occupation, Tom would slip away; and in a minute  shrill cries would be heard from the dairy, \"Charity, Charity, thee lazy  huzzy, where bist?\" and Tom would break cover, hands and mouth full of  curds, and take refuge on the shaky surface of the great muck reservoir  in the middle of the yard, disturbing the repose of the great pigs. Here  he was in safety, as no grown person could follow without getting over  their knees; and the luckless Charity, while her aunt scolded her from  the dairy door, for being \"allus hankering about arter our Willum,  instead of minding Master Tom,\" would descend from threats to coaxing,  to lure Tom out of the muck, which was rising over his shoes, and would  soon tell a tale on his stockings, for which she would be sure to catch  it from missus's maid.    Tom had two abettors, in the shape of a couple of old boys, Noah and  Benjamin by name, who defended him from Charity, and expended much time  upon his education. They were both of them retired servants of former  generations of the Browns. Noah Crooke was a keen, dry old man of almost  ninety, but still able to totter about. He talked to Tom quite as if he  were one of his own family, and indeed had long completely identified  the Browns with himself. In some remote age he had been the attendant  of a Miss Brown, and had conveyed her about the country on a pillion. He  had a little round picture of the identical gray horse, caparisoned  with the identical pillion, before which he used to do a sort of  fetish worship, and abuse turnpike-roads and carriages. He wore an old  full-bottomed wig, the gift of some dandy old Brown whom he had valeted  in the middle of last century, which habiliment Master Tom looked upon  with considerable respect, not to say fear; and indeed his whole feeling  towards Noah was strongly tainted with awe. And when the old gentleman  was gathered to his fathers, Tom's lamentation over him was not  unaccompanied by a certain joy at having seen the last of the wig. \"Poor  old Noah, dead and gone,\" said he; \"Tom Brown so sorry. Put him in the  coffin, wig and all.\"    But old Benjy was young master's real delight and refuge. He was a  youth by the side of Noah, scarce seventy years old--a cheery, humorous,  kind-hearted old man, full of sixty years of Vale gossip, and of all  sorts of helpful ways for young and old, but above all for children.  It was he who bent the first pin with which Tom extracted his first  stickleback out of \"Pebbly Brook,\" the little stream which ran through  the village. The first stickleback was a splendid fellow, with fabulous  red and blue gills. Tom kept him in a small basin till the day of his  death, and became a fisherman from that day. Within a month from the  taking of the first stickleback, Benjy had carried off our hero to  the canal, in defiance of Charity; and between them, after a whole  afternoon's popjoying, they had caught three or four small, coarse fish  and a perch, averaging perhaps two and a half ounces"]]]
