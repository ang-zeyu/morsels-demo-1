At first the novelty was  delightful, and then one day in a queer old inn up Uthering way,  beyond Lingwold, I heard for the first time the rumour of the city  said to be on Mallington Moor. They spoke of it quite casually over  their glasses of beer, two farmers at the inn. \"They say the queer  folk be at Mallington with their city,\" one farmer said. \"Travelling  they seem to be,\" said the other. And more came in then and the rumour  spread. And then, such are the contradictions of our little likes and  dislikes and all the whims that drive us, that I, who had come so far  to avoid cities, had a great longing all of a sudden for throngs again  and the great hives of Man, and then and there determined on that  bright Sunday morning to come to Mallington and there search for the  city that rumour spoke of so strangely.    Mallington Moor, from all that they said of it, was hardly a likely  place to find a thing by searching. It was a huge high moor, very  bleak and desolate and altogether trackless. It seemed a lonely place  from what they said. The Normans when they came had called it Mal Lieu  and afterwards Mallintown and so it changed to Mallington. Though what  a town can ever have had to do with a place so utterly desolate I do  not know. And before that some say that the Saxons called it Baplas,  which I believe to be a corruption of Bad Place.    And beyond the mere rumour of a beautiful city all of white marble and  with a foreign look up on Mallington Moor, beyond this I could not  get. None of them had seen it himself, \"only heard of it like,\" and my  questions, rather than stimulating conversation, would always stop it  abruptly. I was no more fortunate on the road to Mallington until the  Tuesday, when I was quite near it; I had been walking two days from  the inn where I had heard the rumour and could see the great hill  steep as a headland on which Mallington lay, standing up on the  skyline: the hill was covered with grass, where anything grew at all,  but Mallington Moor is all heather; it is just marked Moor on the map;  nobody goes there and they do not trouble to name it. It was there  where the gaunt hill first came into sight, by the roadside as I  enquired for the marble city of some labourers by the way, that I was  directed, partly I think in derision, to the old shepherd of Lingwold.  It appeared that he, following sometimes sheep that had strayed, and  wandering far from Lingwold, came sometimes up to the edge of  Mallington Moor, and that he would come back from these excursions and  shout through the villages, raving of a city of white marble and  gold-tipped minarets. And hearing me asking questions of this city  they had laughed and directed me to the shepherd of Lingwold. One  well-meant warning they gave me as I went--the old man was not  reliable.    And late that evening I saw the thatches of Lingwold sheltering under  the edge of that huge hill that Atlas-like held up those miles of moor  to the great winds and heaven.    They knew less of the city in Lingwold than elsewhere but they knew  the whereabouts of the man I wanted, though they seemed a little  ashamed of him. There was an inn in Lingwold that gave me shelter,  whence in the morning, equipped with purchases, I set out to find  their shepherd. And there he was on the edge of Mallington Moor  standing motionless, gazing stupidly at his sheep; his hands trembled  continually and his eyes had a blear look, but he was quite sober,  wherein all Lingwold had wronged him.    And then and there I asked him of the city and he said he had never  heard tell of any such place. And I said, \"Come, come, you must pull  yourself together.\" And he looked angrily at me; but when he saw me  draw from amongst my purchases a full bottle of whiskey and a big  glass he became more friendly. As I poured out the whiskey I asked him  again about the marble city on Mallington Moor but he seemed quite  honestly to know nothing about it. The amount of whiskey he drank was  quite incredible, but I seldom express surprise and once more I asked  him the way to the wonderful city. His hand was steadier now and his  eyes more intelligent and he said that he had heard something of some  such city, but his memory was evidently blurred and he was still  unable to give me useful directions. I consequently gave him another  tumbler, which he drank off like the first without any water, and  almost at once he was a different man. The trembling in his hands  stopped altogether, his eye became as quick as a younger man's, he  answered my questions readily and frankly, and, what was more  important to me still, his old memory became alert and clear for even  minutest details. His gratitude to myself I need not mention, for I  make no pretence that I bought the bottle of whiskey that the old  shepherd enjoyed so much without at least some thought of my own  advantage. Yet it was pleasant to reflect that it was due to me that  he had pulled himself together and steadied his shaking hand and  cleared his mind, recovered his memory and his self-respect. He spoke  to me quite clearly, no longer slurring his words; he had seen the  city first one moonlight night when he was lost in the mist on the big  moor, he had wandered far in the mist, and when it lifted he saw the  city by moonlight. He had no food, but luckily had his flask. There  never was such a city, not even in books. Travellers talked sometimes  of Venice seen from the sea, there might be such a place or there  might not, but, whether or no, it was nothing to the city on  Mallington Moor. Men who read books had talked to him in his time,  hundreds of books, but they never could tell of any city like this.  Why, the place was all of marble, roads, walls and palaces, all pure  white marble, and the tops of the tall thin spires were entirely of  gold. And they were queer folk in the city even for foreigners. And  there were camels, but I cut him short for I thought I could judge for  myself, if there was such a place, and, if not, I was wasting my time  as well as a pint of good whiskey. So I got him to speak of the way,  and after more circumlocution than I needed and more talk of the city  he pointed to a tiny track on the black earth just beside us, a little  twisty way you could hardly see.    I said the moor was trackless; untrodden of man or dog it certainly  was and seemed to have less to do with the ways of man than any waste  I have seen, but the track the old shepherd showed me, if track it  was, was no more than the track of a hare--an elf-path the old man  called it, Heaven knows what he meant. And then before I left him he  insisted on giving me his flask with the queer strong rum it  contained. Whiskey brings out in some men melancholy, in some  rejoicing, with him it was clearly generosity and he insisted until I  took his rum, though I did not mean to drink it. It was lonely up  there, he said, and bitter cold and the city hard to find, being set  in a hollow, and I should need the rum, and he had never seen the  marble city except on days when he had had his flask: he seemed to  regard that rusted iron flask as a sort of mascot, and in the end I  took it.    I followed that odd, faint track on the black earth under the heather  till I came to the big grey stone beyond the horizon, where the track  divides into two, and I took the one to the left as the old man told  me. I knew by another stone that I saw far off that I had not lost my  way, nor the old man lied.    And just as I hoped to see the city's ramparts before the gloaming  fell on that desolate place, I suddenly saw a long high wall of  whiteness with pinnacles here and there thrown up above it, floating  towards me silent and grim as a secret, and knew it for that evil  thing the mist. The sun, though low, was shining on every sprig of  heather, the green and scarlet mosses were shining with it too, it  seemed incredible that in three minutes' time all those colours would  be gone and nothing left all round but a grey darkness. I gave up hope  of finding the city that day, a broader path than mine could have been  quite easily lost. I hastily chose for my bed a thick patch of  heather, wrapped myself in a waterproof cloak, and lay down and made  myself comfortable. And then the mist came. It came like the careful  pulling of lace curtains, then like the drawing of grey blinds; it  shut out the horizon to the north, then to the east and west; it  turned the whole sky white and hid the moor; it came down on it like a  metropolis, only utterly silent, silent and white as tombstones.    And then I was glad of that strange strong rum, or whatever it was in  the flask that the shepherd gave me, for I did not think that the mist  would clear till night, and I feared the night would be cold. So I  nearly emptied the flask; and, sooner than I expected, I fell asleep,  for the first night out as a rule one does not sleep at once but is  kept awake some while by the little winds and the unfamiliar sound of  the things that wander at night, and that cry to one another far-off  with their queer, faint voices; one misses them afterwards when one  gets to houses again. But I heard none of these sounds in the mist  that evening.    And then I woke and found that the mist was gone and the sun was just  disappearing under the moor, and I knew that I had not slept for as  long as I thought. And I decided to go on while I could, for I thought  that I was not very far from the city.

Two  world-views, two types of civilization met in deadly conflict, and the  inherent weakness of isolated, belated, superstitious and corrupt  paganism was revealed. Moreover, during this, China's crisis, Japan  for the first time stepped out upon the world's stage of political and  military activity. She was recognized as a civilized nation, worthy to  share with the great nations of the earth the responsibility of ruling  the lawless and backward races.    The correctness of any interpretation as to the significance of this  conflict between the opposing civilizations turns, ultimately, on the  question as to what is the real nature of man and of society. If it be  true, as maintained by Prof. Le Bon and his school, that the mental  and moral character of a people is as fixed as its physiological  characteristics, then the conflict in China is at bottom a conflict of  races, not of civilizations.    The inadequacy of the physiological theory of national character may  be seen almost at a glance by a look at Japan. Were an Oriental  necessarily and unchangeably Oriental, it would have been impossible  for Japan to have come into such close and sympathetic touch with the  West.    The conflict of the East with the West, however, is not an inherent  and unending conflict, because it is not racial, but civilizational.  It is a conflict of world-views and systems of thought and life. It is  a conflict of heathen and Christian civilizations. And the conflict  will come to an end as soon as, and in proportion as, China awakes  from her blindness and begins to build her national temple on the  bedrock of universal truth and righteousness. The conflict is  practically over in Japan because she has done this. In loyally  accepting science, popular education, and the rights of every  individual to equal protection by the government, Japan has accepted  the fundamental conceptions of civilization held in the West, and has  thus become an integral part of Christendom, a fact of world-wide  significance. It proves that the most important differences now  separating the great races of men are civilizational, not  physiological. It also proves that European, American, and Oriental  peoples may be possessed by the same great ideals of life and  principles of action, enabling them to co-operate as nations in great  movements to their mutual advantage.    While even we of the West may be long in learning the full  significance of what has been and still is taking place in Japan and  more conspicuously just now, because more tragically, in China, one  thing is clear: steam and electricity have abolished forever the old  isolation of the nations.    Separated branches of the human race that for thousands of years have  been undergoing divergent evolution, producing radically different  languages, customs, civilizations, systems of thought and world-views,  and have resulted even in marked physiological and psychological  differences, are now being brought into close contact and inevitable  conflict. But at bottom it is a conflict of ideas, not of races. The  age of isolation and divergent evolution is passing away, and that of  international association and convergent social evolution has begun.  Those races and nations that refuse to recognize the new social order,  and oppose the cosmic process and its forces, will surely be pushed to  the wall and cease to exist as independent nations, just as, in  ancient times, the tribes that refused to unite with neighboring  tribes were finally subjugated by those that did so unite.    Universal economic, political, intellectual, moral, and religious  intercourse is the characteristic of the new aeon on which we are  entering. What are to be the final consequences of this wide  intercourse? Can a people change its character? Can a nation fully  possessed by one type of civilization reject it, and adopt one  radically different? Do races have \"souls\" which are fixed and  incapable of radical transformations? What has taken place in Japan, a  profound, or only a superficial change in psychical character? Are the  destinies of the Oriental races already unalterably determined?    The answers to these questions have already been suggested in the  preceding paragraphs, in regard to what has already taken place in  Japan. But we may add that that answer really turns on our conception  as to the nature of the characteristics separating the East from the  West. In proportion as national character is reckoned to be  biological, will it be considered fixed and the national destiny  predetermined. In proportion as it is reckoned to be sociological,  will it be considered alterable and the national destiny subject to  new social forces. Now that the intercourse of widely different races  has begun on a scale never before witnessed, it is highly important  for us to know its probable consequences. For this we need to gain a  clear idea of the nature both of the individual man and of society, of  the relation of the social order to individual and to race character,  and of the law regulating and the forces producing social evolution.  Only thus can we forecast the probable course and consequences of the  free social intercourse of widely divergent races.    It is the belief of the writer that few countries afford so clear an  illustration of the principles involved in social evolution as Japan.  Her development has been so rapid and so recent that some principles  have become manifest that otherwise might easily have escaped notice.  The importance of understanding Japan, because of the light her recent  transformations throw on the subject of social evolution and of  national character and also because of the conspicuous role to which  she is destined as the natural leader of the Oriental races in their  adoption of Occidental modes of life and thought, justifies a careful  study of Japanese character. He who really understands Japan, has  gained the magic key for unlocking the social mysteries of China and  the entire East. But the Japanese people, with their institutions and  their various characteristics, merit careful study also for their own  sakes. For the Japanese constitute an exceedingly interesting and even  a unique branch of the human race. Japan is neither a purgatory, as  some would have it, nor a paradise, as others maintain, but a land  full of individuals in an interesting stage of social evolution.    Current opinions concerning Japan, however, are as curious as they are  contradictory. Sir Edwin Arnold says that the Japanese \"Have the  nature rather of birds or butterflies than of ordinary human beings.\"  Says Mr. A.M. Knapp: \"Japan is the one country in the world which does  not disappoint ... It is unquestionably the unique nation of the  globe, the land of dream and enchantment, the land which could hardly  differ more from our own, were it located in another planet, its  people not of this world.\" An \"old resident,\" however, calls it \"the  land of disappointments.\" Few phenomena are more curious than the  readiness with which a tourist or professional journalist, after a few  days or weeks of sight-seeing and interviewing, makes up his mind in  regard to the character of the people, unless it be the way in which  certain others, who have resided in this land for a number of years,  continue to live in their own dreamland. These two classes of writers  have been the chief contributors of material for the omnivorous  readers of the West.    It appears to not a few who have lived many years in this Far Eastern  land, that the public has been fed with the dreams of poets or the  snap-judgments of tourists instead of with the facts of actual  experience. A recent editorial article in the _Japan Mail_, than whose  editor few men have had a wider acquaintance with the Japanese people  or language, contains the following paragraph:         \"In the case of such writers as Sir Edwin Arnold and Mr. Lafcadio       Hearn it is quite apparent that the logical faculty is in       abeyance. Imagination reigns supreme. As poetic nights or       outbursts, the works of these authors on Japan are delightful       reading. But no one who has studied the Japanese in a deeper       manner, by more intimate daily intercourse with all classes of the       people than either of these writers pretends to have had, can       possibly regard a large part of their description as anything more       than pleasing fancy. Both have given rein to the poetic fancy and       thus have, from a purely literary point of view, scored a success       granted to few.... But as exponents of Japanese life and thought       they are unreliable.... They have given form and beauty to much       that never existed except in vague outline or in undeveloped germs       in the Japanese mind. In doing this they have unavoidably been       guilty of misrepresentation.... The Japanese nation of Arnold and       Hearn is not the nation we have known for a quarter of a century,       but a purely ideal one manufactured out of the author's brains. It       is high time that"]]]
