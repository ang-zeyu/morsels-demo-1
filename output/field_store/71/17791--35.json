[Illustration: (uppercase cursive alphabet)]    In order to practice capital letters to advantage, as well as to study  them, collect in a group or family all those letters which have  some one form or principle as an essential part. Take first the 6th  principle, or oval, and we group the letters as follows:    [Illustration: O. D. C. E. P. Q. R.]    The excellence of an oval depends largely on its fullness and  roundness. No corners or flat sides.    Down strokes parallel.    Capital D is a Capital O with a knot on the lower corner.

K. F. T. S. S. G.]    In the H and K, the capital stem is almost straight on the down  stroke, in the F and T it is little more of a wave line, and in S and  L the line is much of a compound or double curve.    [Illustration: H Hand Hunter Hinder K Kingdom Ky.]    [Illustration: F Famine Fremont T Tenement Troy]    [Illustration: S Sumpter St. S Sarimore G Grammar]    The capital I, and also the J, which is a modified I, are sometimes  classed among the capital stem letters, from the resemblance of the I  to this principle in all but the top.

Make figures small, neat, and of form exact. Each figure must show for  itself, and cannot be known by those which precede or follow it, as  is the case with letters. The common tendency is to make figures too  large and coarse. Mind the ovals in figures and have them full and  round. The chief excellence of the zero lies in its roundness; the  3, 5, 6 or 9, without care in making the ovals, may degenerate into a  straight line, or simply a meaningless hook, which it would hardly  be safe to use in expressing sums of money, ordering goods, or the  transaction of other business.

As by the power of speech, men may  pass from the common tone of conversation up to the melodious strains  of music, or may soar in flights of oratory into the sublime, until  the multitude is entranced; so the capabilities of the pen are not  limited to the common uses of life, but may take on forms of beauty in  elegant outlines of bird, or landscape, or graceful swan or bounding  stag.    Ornamental writing is not a practical art, and has no connection  whatever with the practical business of life. It is in the realm  of poetry. The imagery of graceful outlines must first be seen by a  poetic imagination. While the great masses may acquire a good style  of plain, practical penmanship, few have the necessary conception  of mind, combined with the skill and dexterity of hand to become  successful ornamental penmen.    The ornamental pages which follow are given, not as models for  imitation or practice by the learner, but merely to show the  possibilities of the pen in the hand of a master, and as a fitting  closing to this, our chapter on penmanship.    To any one who may have an artistic quality of mind, and delights  in beautiful lines and harmonious curves, these pages of ornamental  penmanship will serve as models for practice and imitation, and every  attempt at such an exercise as the one on this, or the following  pages, will give greater strength and freedom of movement, and better  command of the pen, so that it will conduce to an easy, flowing  and elegant style of plain business writing, while affording a most  pleasant and profitable employment in the cultivation of the taste.    Various beautiful designs or pictures may be made with the pen, in the  hands of one that possesses the skill of a penman and the eye of an  artist.

The merchant of the smaller cities or towns, perhaps  in the far west, desires to order articles of merchandise from the  wholesale house in New York or Boston. Possibly a remittance is to  be sent. It may be that an error has occurred and needs correction.  Credit is to be asked, references given, and a multitude of other  matters call for adjustment through correspondence. To write every  conceivable variety and shade of meaning, expressing the proper  thought in the most fitting and appropriate language, is indeed a rare  and valuable accomplishment. And when the proper language takes on  the graceful and businesslike air of the well written letter, with its  several parts harmoniously arranged, it is a combination of brain and  skill which can hardly be overestimated.    [Illustration]    This subject, therefore, naturally divides itself into two parts: _The  Mechanical Structure_, and the _Literature of a Letter_. The former of  these being the less difficult will be first considered.      THE STRUCTURE OF A BUSINESS LETTER.    Consists in the arrangement of its several parts, with a view to the  most harmonious effect. Excellent penmanship is very desirable, but  not absolutely essential. The penmanship may indeed be poor, but the  arrangement of the several parts of the letter, the neatness, and  finish, may be such as to give it an attractive appearance, while  on the other hand, the letter may be clothed in the most elegant  penmanship, and yet the construction be such as to stamp its author as  a careless and indifferent person, devoid of precision and order.    No one great thing, but many little things carefully watched, and  attentively practiced, make up the structure and dress of a business  letter, and give it a businesslike air. The penmanship should be a  neat, strong hand, very plain and legible, and devoid of all flourish.      PAPER AND ENVELOPE.    The paper and envelopes used in business correspondence should be of  a good, durable quality, and a white color is preferable. Cheap  materials are not only unsatisfactory to the writer, but may give  the reader an unfavorable impression, which would be an injury far  exceeding the cost of the best stationery for a life time. Persons  form impressions from very little things sometimes.    The size of a letter sheet in business correspondence should be about  8x10 inches. This sheet affords a sufficient space for a communication  of ordinary length to be written on one side only, which is essential  in case the letter is copied in a letter press. A sheet of paper, note  size, (5x8) is oftentimes used for brief communications of no special  importance, and not designed to be filed for future reference. Among  professional men the commercial note sheet is more extensively used,  but with business men the letter size is considered preferable.    The envelope should correspond in size to that of the letter sheet,  and should be a trifle longer than one-half the length of the sheet.  Thus in a sheet eight by ten inches, one-half the length of the sheet  is five inches, and this requires the length of the envelope to be  about five and a quarter inches. Its width is usually about three  inches. Avoid the use of fancy colored and fancy shaped paper and  envelopes. These may not be objectionable in social correspondence  among ladies, but the gravity of business affairs does not admit of  such display.      THE HEADING.    With most firms engaged in business it has become a custom to have the  business advertisement placed at the head of the letter page, together  with street, number and city. Thus leaving only the date to be  inserted to complete the heading.    In case the heading of the letter is to be entirely written, it should  be placed so as to occupy the right hand half of the first two lines  at the top of the page. If, however, the letter is to be a very brief  one, occupying only three or four lines,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14107"],[0,"The Lost Stradivarius (#4)"],[1," a personal witness of the incidents I am about to narrate, so often  have I heard them from my brother's lips. The two young men, after  parting with us in the High Street, returned to their respective  colleges. John reached his rooms shortly before eleven o'clock. He was  at once sad and happy--sad at our departure, but happy in a new-found  world of delight which his admiration for Constance Temple opened to  him. He was, in fact, deeply in love with her, and the full flood of a  hitherto unknown passion filled him with an emotion so overwhelming that  his ordinary life seemed transfigured. He moved, as it were, in an ether  superior to our mortal atmosphere, and a new region of high resolves and  noble possibilities spread itself before his eyes. He slammed his heavy  outside door (called an \"oak\") to prevent anyone entering and flung  himself into the window-seat. Here he sat for a long time, the sash  thrown up and his head outside, for he was excited and feverish. His  mental exaltation was so great and his thoughts of so absorbing an  interest that he took no notice of time, and only remembered afterwards  that the scent of a syringa-bush was borne up to him from a little  garden-patch opposite, and that a bat had circled slowly up and down the  lane, until he heard the clocks striking three. At the same time the  faint light of dawn made itself felt almost imperceptibly; the classic  statues on the roof of the schools began to stand out against the white  sky, and a faint glimmer to penetrate the darkened room. It glistened on  the varnished top of his violin-case lying on the table, and on a jug of  toast-and-water placed there by his college servant or scout every night  before he left. He drank a glass of this mixture, and was moving towards  his bedroom door when a sudden thought struck him. He turned back, took  the violin from its case, tuned it, and began to play the \"Areopagita\"  suite. He was conscious of that mental clearness and vigour which not  unfrequently comes with the dawn to those who have sat watching or  reading through the night: and his thoughts were exalted by the effect  which the first consciousness of a deep passion causes in imaginative  minds. He had never played the suite with more power; and the airs,  even without the piano part, seemed fraught with a meaning hitherto  unrealised. As he began the _Gagliarda_ he heard the wicker chair creak;  but he had his back towards it, and the sound was now too familiar to  him to cause him even to look round. It was not till he was playing  the repeat that he became aware of a new and overpowering sensation.  At first it was a vague feeling, so often experienced by us all, of  not being alone. He did not stop playing, and in a few seconds the  impression of a presence in the room other than his own became so strong  that he was actually afraid to look round. But in another moment he felt  that at all hazards he must see what or who this presence was. Without  stopping he partly turned and partly looked over his shoulder. The  silver light of early morning was filling the room, making the various  objects appear of less bright colour than usual, and giving to  everything a pearl-grey neutral tint. In this cold but clear light he  saw seated in the wicker chair the figure of a man.    In the first violent shock of so terrifying a discovery, he could not  appreciate such details as those of features, dress, or appearance. He  was merely conscious that with him, in a locked room of which he knew  himself to be the only human inmate, there sat something which bore a  human form. He looked at it for a moment with a hope, which he felt  to be vain, that it might vanish and prove a phantom of his excited  imagination, but still it sat there. Then my brother put down his  violin, and he used to assure me that a horror overwhelmed him of an  intensity which he had previously believed impossible. Whether the image  which he saw was subjective or objective, I cannot pretend to say: you  will be in a position to judge for yourself when you have finished this  narrative. Our limited experience would lead us to believe that it was a  phantom conjured up by some unusual condition of his own brain; but we  are fain to confess that there certainly do exist in nature phenomena  such as baffle human reason; and it is possible that, for some hidden  purposes of Providence, permission may occasionally be granted to those  who have passed from this life to assume again for a time the form of  their earthly tabernacle. We must, I say, be content to suspend our  judgment on such matters; but in this instance the subsequent course of  events is very difficult to explain, except on the supposition that  there was then presented to my brother's view the actual bodily form of  one long deceased. The dread which took possession of him was due, he  has more than once told me when analysing his feelings long afterwards,  to two predominant causes. Firstly, he felt that mental dislocation  which accompanies the sudden subversion of preconceived theories,  the sudden alteration of long habit, or even the occurrence of any  circumstance beyond the walk of our daily experience. This I have  observed myself in the perturbing effect which a sudden death, a  grievous accident, or in recent years the declaration of war, has  exercised upon all except the most lethargic or the most determined  minds. Secondly, he experienced the profound self-abasement or mental  annihilation caused by the near conception of a being of a superior  order. In the presence of an existence wearing, indeed, the human form,  but of attributes widely different from and superior to his own, he felt  the combined reverence and revulsion which even the noblest wild animals  exhibit when brought for the first time face to face with man. The shock  was so great that I feel persuaded it exerted an effect on him from  which he never wholly recovered.    After an interval which seemed to him interminable, though it was only  of a second's duration, he turned his eyes again to the occupant of the  wicker chair. His faculties had so far recovered from the first shock  as to enable him to see that the figure was that of a man perhaps  thirty-five years of age and still youthful in appearance. The face was  long and oval, the hair brown, and brushed straight off an exceptionally  high forehead. His complexion was very pale or bloodless. He was clean  shaven, and his finely cut mouth, with compressed lips, wore something  of a sneering smile. His general expression was unpleasing, and from the  first my brother felt as by intuition that there was present some malign  and wicked influence. His eyes were not visible, as he kept them cast  down, resting his head on his hand in the attitude of one listening. His  face and even his dress were impressed so vividly upon John's mind, that  he never had any difficulty in recalling them to his imagination; and he  and I had afterwards an opportunity of verifying them in a remarkable  manner. He wore a long cut-away coat of green cloth with an edge of gold  embroidery, and a white satin waistcoat figured with rose-sprigs, a  full cravat of rich lace, knee-breeches of buff silk, and stockings of  the same. His shoes were of polished black leather with heavy silver  buckles, and his costume in general recalled that worn a century ago.  As my brother gazed at him, he got up, putting his hands on the arms  of the chair to raise himself, and causing the creaking so often heard  before. The hands forced themselves on my brother's notice: they were  very white, with the long delicate fingers of a musician. He showed a  considerable height; and still keeping his eyes on the floor, walked  with an ordinary gait towards the end of the bookcase at the side of the  room farthest from the window. He reached the bookcase, and then John  suddenly lost sight of him. The figure did not fade gradually, but went  out, as it were, like the flame of a suddenly extinguished candle.    The room was now filled with the clear light of the summer morning: the  whole vision had lasted but a few seconds, but my brother knew that  there was no possibility of his having been mistaken, that the mystery  of the creaking chair was solved, that he had seen the man who had come  evening by evening for a month past to listen to the rhythm of the  _Gagliarda_. Terribly disturbed, he sat for some time half dreading and  half expecting a return of the figure; but all remained unchanged: he  saw nothing, nor did he dare to challenge its reappearance by playing  again the _Gagliarda_, which seemed to have so strange an attraction for  it. At last, in the full sunlight of a late June morning at Oxford, he  heard the steps of early pedestrians on the pavement below his windows,  the cry of a milkman, and other sounds which showed the world was awake.  It was after six o'clock, and going to his bedroom he flung himself on  the outside of the bed for an hour's troubled slumber.          CHAPTER IV      When his servant called him about eight o'clock my brother sent a note  to Mr. Gaskell at New College, begging him to come round to Magdalen  Hall as soon as might be in the course of the morning. His summons was  at once obeyed, and Mr. Gaskell was with him before he had finished  breakfast. My brother was still much agitated, and at once told him what  had happened the night before, detailing the various circumstances with  minuteness, and not even concealing from him the sentiments which he  entertained towards Miss Constance Temple. In narrating the appearance  which he had seen in the chair, his agitation was still so excessive  that he had difficulty in controlling his voice.    Mr. Gaskell heard him with much attention, and did not at once reply  when John had finished his narration. At length he said, \"I suppose many  friends would think it right to affect, even if they did not feel, an  incredulity as to "]]]
