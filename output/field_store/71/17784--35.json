The year 1809--that year which gave William E. Gladstone to England--was  in our country the birth-year of him who wears the most distinguished  name that has yet been written on the pages of American history--ABRAHAM  LINCOLN. In a rude cabin in a clearing, in the wilds of that section  which was once the hunting-ground and later the battle-field of the  Cherokees and other war-like tribes, and which the Indians themselves  had named Kentucky because it was \"dark and bloody ground,\" the great  War President of the United States, after whose name History has written  the word \"Emancipator,\" first saw the light. Born and nurtured in  penury, inured to hardship, coarse food, and scanty clothing,--the story  of his youth is full of pathos. Small wonder that when asked in his  later years to tell something of his early life, he replied by quoting a  line from Gray's Elegy:         \"The short and simple annals of the poor.\"    Lincoln's ancestry has been traced with tolerable certainty through five  generations to Samuel Lincoln of Norfolk County, England. Not many  years after the landing of the \"Mayflower\" at Plymouth--perhaps in the  year 1638--Samuel Lincoln's son Mordecai had emigrated to Hingham,  Massachusetts. Perhaps because he was a Quaker, a then persecuted sect,  he did not remain long at Hingham, but came westward as far as Berks  County, Pennsylvania. His son, John Lincoln, went southward from  Pennsylvania and settled in Rockingham County, Virginia. Later, in 1782,  while the last events of the American Revolution were in progress,  Abraham Lincoln, son of John and grandfather of President Lincoln, moved  into Kentucky and took up a tract of government land in Mercer County.  In the Field Book of Daniel Boone, the Kentucky pioneer, (now in  possession of the Wisconsin Historical Society), appears the following  note of purchase:         \"Abraham Lincoln enters five hundred acres of land on a Treasury       warrant on the south side of Licking Creek or River, in Kentucky.\"    At this time Kentucky was included within the limits and jurisdiction of  Virginia. In 1775 Daniel Boone had built a fort at Boonesborough, on the  Kentucky river, and it was not far from this site that Abraham Lincoln,  President Lincoln's grandfather, located his claim and put up a rude log  hut for the shelter of his family. The pioneers of Kentucky cleared  small spaces and erected their humble dwellings. They had to contend not  only with the wild forces of nature, and to defend themselves from the  beasts of the forest,--more to be feared than either were the hostile  Indians. The settlers were filled with terror of these stealthy foes. At  home and abroad they kept their guns ready for instant use both night  and day. Many a hard battle was fought between the Indian and the  pioneer. Many an unguarded woodsman was shot down without warning while  busy about his necessary work. Among these was Abraham Lincoln. The  story of his death is related by Mr. I.N. Arnold. \"Thomas Lincoln was  with his father in the field when the savages suddenly fell upon them.  Mordecai and Josiah, his elder brothers, were near by in the forest.  Mordecai, startled by a shot, saw his father fall, and running to the  cabin seized the loaded rifle, rushed to one of the loop-holes cut  through the logs of the cabin, and saw the Indian who had fired. He had  just caught the boy, Thomas, and was running toward the forest. Pointing  the rifle through the logs and aiming at a medal on the breast of the  Indian, Mordecai fired. The Indian fell, and springing to his feet the  boy ran to the open arms of his mother at the cabin door. Meanwhile  Josiah, who had run to the fort for aid, returned with a party of  settlers. The bodies of Abraham Lincoln and the Indian who had been  killed were brought in. From this time forth Mordecai Lincoln was the  mortal enemy of the Indian, and it is said that he sacrificed many in  revenge for the murder of his father.\"    In the presence of such dangers Thomas Lincoln spent his boyhood. He was  born in 1778, and could not have been much more than four years old on  that fatal day when in one swift moment his father lay dead beside him  and vengeance had been exacted by his resolute boy brother. It was such  experiences as these that made of the pioneers the sturdy men they were.  They acquired habits of heroism. Their sinews became wiry; their nerves  turned to steel. Their senses became sharpened. They grew alert, steady,  prompt and deft in every emergency.    Of Mordecai Lincoln, the boy who had exhibited such coolness and daring  on the day of his father's death, many stories are told after he reached  manhood. \"He was naturally a man of considerable genius,\" says one who  knew him. \"He was a man of great drollery. It would almost make you  laugh to look at him. I never saw but one other man who excited in me  the same disposition to laugh, and that was Artemus Ward. Abe Lincoln  had a very high opinion of his uncle, and on one occasion remarked that  Uncle Mord had run off with all the talents of the family.\"    Thomas Lincoln was twenty-eight years old before he sought a wife. His  choice fell upon a young woman of twenty-three whose name was Nancy  Hanks. Like her husband, she was of English descent. Like his, her  parents had followed in the path of emigration from Virginia to  Kentucky. The couple were married by the Rev. Jesse Head, a Methodist  minister located at Springfield, Washington County, Kentucky. They lived  for a time in Elizabethtown, but after the birth of their first child,  Sarah, they removed to Rock Spring farm, on Nolin Creek, in Hardin  (afterward LaRue) County. In this desolate spot, a strange and unlikely  place for the birth of one destined to play so memorable a part in the  history of the world, on the twelfth day of February, 1809, Abraham  Lincoln the President was born.    Of all the gross injustice ever done to the memory of woman, that which  has been accorded to Nancy Hanks is the greatest. The story which cast a  shadow upon her parentage, and on that of her illustrious son as well,  should be sternly relegated to the oblivion whence it came. Mr. Henry  Watterson, in his brilliant address on Lincoln, refers to him as \"that  strange, incomparable man, _of whose parentage we neither know nor  care_.\" In some localities, particularly in Kentucky and South Carolina,  the rumor is definite and persistent that the President was not the son  of Thomas Lincoln, the illiterate and thriftless, but of one Colonel  Hardin for whom Hardin County was named; that Nancy Hanks was herself  the victim of unlegalized motherhood, the natural daughter of an  aristocratic, wealthy, and well-educated Virginia planter, and that this  accounted for many of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14006"],[0,"An English Grammar (#4)"],[1,"used like single nouns:--         _Too swift_ arrives as tardy as _too slow_.--SHAKESPEARE.         Then comes the \"_Why, sir_!\" and the \"_What then, sir_?\" and the       \"_No, sir_!\" and the \"_You don't see your way through the       question, sir_!\"--MACAULAY    (3) Any part of speech may be considered merely as a word, without  reference to its function in the sentence; also titles of books are  treated as simple nouns.         The _it_, at the beginning, is ambiguous, whether it mean the sun       or the cold.--Dr BLAIR         In this definition, is the word \"_just_,\" or \"_legal_,\" finally       to stand?--RUSKIN.         There was also a book of Defoe's called an \"_Essay on Projects_,\"       and another of Dr. Mather's called \"_Essays to do Good_.\"--B.       FRANKLIN.      [Sidenote: _Caution._]    20. It is to be remembered, however, that the above cases are  shiftings of the _use_, of words rather than of their _meaning_. We  seldom find instances of complete conversion of one part of speech  into another.    When, in a sentence above, the terms _the great_, _the wealthy_, are  used, they are not names only: we have in mind the idea of persons and  the quality of being _great_ or _wealthy_. The words are used in the  sentence where nouns are used, but have an adjectival meaning.    In the other sentences, _why_ and _wherefore_, _When_, _Now_, and  _Then_, are spoken of as if pure nouns; but still the reader considers  this not a natural application of them as name words, but as a figure  of speech.    NOTE.--These remarks do not apply, of course, to such words as become  pure nouns by use. There are many of these. The adjective _good_ has  no claim on the noun _goods_; so, too, in speaking of the _principal_  of a school, or a state _secret_, or a faithful _domestic_, or a  _criminal_, etc., the words are entirely independent of any adjective  force.      Exercise.    Pick out the nouns in the following sentences, and tell to which class  each belongs. Notice if any have shifted from one class to another.      1. Hope springs eternal in the human breast.    2. Heaven from all creatures hides the book of Fate.    3.  Stone walls do not a prison make.        Nor iron bars a cage.    4. Truth-teller was our England's Alfred named.    5. A great deal of talent is lost to the world for want of a little  courage.    6.  Power laid his rod aside,       And Ceremony doff'd her pride.    7. She sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies.    8. Learning, that cobweb of the brain.    9.  A little weeping would ease my heart;        But in their briny bed       My tears must stop, for every drop        Hinders needle and thread.    10. A fool speaks all his mind, but a wise man reserves something for  hereafter.    11. Knowledge is proud that he has learned so much; Wisdom is humble  that he knows no more.    12. Music hath charms to soothe the savage breast.    13. And see, he cried, the welcome,       Fair guests, that waits you here.    14. The fleet, shattered and disabled, returned to Spain.    15. One To-day is worth two To-morrows.    16. Vessels carrying coal are constantly moving.    17. Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest,        Some Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood.    18. And oft we trod a waste of pearly sands.    19. A man he seems of cheerful yesterdays        And confident to-morrows.    20. The hours glide by; the silver moon is gone.    21. Her robes of silk and velvet came from over the sea.    22. My soldier cousin was once only a drummer boy.    23. But pleasures are like poppies spread,       You seize the flower, its bloom is shed.    24. All that thou canst call thine own Lies in thy To-day.      INFLECTIONS OF NOUNS.      GENDER.      [Sidenote: _What gender means in English. It is founded on sex._]    21. In Latin, Greek, German, and many other languages, some general  rules are given that names of male beings are usually masculine, and  names of females are usually feminine. There are exceptions even to  this general statement, but not so in English. Male beings are, in  English grammar, always masculine; female, always feminine.    When, however, _inanimate_ things are spoken of, these languages are  totally unlike our own in determining the gender of words. For  instance: in Latin, _hortus_ (garden) is masculine, _mensa_ (table) is  feminine, _corpus_ (body) is neuter; in German, _das Messer_ (knife)  is neuter, _der Tisch_ (table) is masculine, _die Gabel_ (fork) is  feminine.    The great difference is, that in English the gender follows the  _meaning_ of the word, in other languages gender follows the _form_;  that is, in English, gender depends on _sex_: if a thing spoken of is  of the male sex, the _name_ of it is masculine; if of the female sex,  the _name_ of it is feminine. Hence:      [Sidenote: _Definition._]    22. Gender is the mode of distinguishing sex by words, or  additions to words.      23. It is evident from this that English can have but two  genders,--masculine and feminine.    [Sidenote: _Gender nouns. Neuter nouns._]    All nouns, then, must be divided into two principal classes,--gender  nouns, those distinguishing the sex of the object; and neuter  nouns, those which do not distinguish sex, or names of things without  life, and consequently without sex.    Gender nouns include names of persons and some names of animals;  neuter nouns include some animals and all inanimate objects.      [Sidenote: _Some words either gender or neuter nouns, according to  use._]    24. Some words may be either gender nouns or neuter nouns, according  to their use. Thus, the word _child_ is neuter in the sentence, \"A  little _child_ shall lead them,\" but is masculine in the sentence  from Wordsworth,--                                        I have seen       A curious _child_ ... applying to _his_ ear       The convolutions of a smooth-lipped shell.    Of animals, those with which man comes in contact often, or which  arouse his interest most, are named by gender nouns, as in these  sentences:--         Before the barn door strutted the gallant _cock_, that pattern of       a husband, ... clapping _his_ burnished wings.--IRVING.         _Gunpowder_ ... came to a stand just by the bridge, with a       suddenness that had nearly sent _his_ rider sprawling over _his_       head--_id._    Other animals are not distinguished as to sex, but are spoken of as  neuter, the sex being of no consequence.         Not a _turkey_ but he [Ichabod] beheld daintily trussed up, with       _its_ gizzard under _its_ wing.--IRVING.         He next stooped down to feel the _pig_, if there were any signs       of life in _it_.--LAMB.      [Sidenote: _No \"common gender._\"]    25. According to the definition, there can be no such thing as  \"common gender:\" words either distinguish sex (or the sex is  distinguished by the context) or else they do not distinguish sex.    If such words as _parent_, _servant_, _teacher_, _ruler_, _relative_,  _cousin_, _domestic_, etc., do not show the sex to which the persons  belong, they are neuter words.      26. Put in convenient form, the division of words according to sex,  or the lack of it, is,--                  (MASCULINE: Male beings.  Gender nouns {                (FEMININE: Female beings.    Neuter nouns: Names of inanimate things, or of living beings whose  sex cannot be determined.      27. The inflections for gender belong, of course, only to masculine  and feminine nouns. _Forms_ would be a more accurate word than  _inflections_, since inflection applies only to the _case_ of nouns.    There are three ways to distinguish the genders:--    (1) By prefixing a gender word to another word.    (2) By adding a suffix, generally to a masculine word.    (3) By using a different word for each gender.      I. Gender shown by Prefixes.      [Sidenote: _Very few of class I._]    28. Usually the gender words _he_ and _she_ are prefixed to neuter  words; as _he-goat_--_she-goat_, _cock sparrow_--_hen sparrow_,  _he-bear_--_she-bear_.    One feminine, _woman_, puts a prefix before the masculine _man_.  _Woman_ is a short way of writing _wifeman_.      II. Gender shown by Suffixes.      29. By far the largest number of gender words are those marked by  suffixes. In this particular the native endings have been largely  supplanted by foreign suffixes.    [Sidenote: _Native suffixes._]    The native suffixes to indicate the feminine were _-en_ and _-ster_.  These remain in _vixen_ and _spinster_, though both words have lost  their original meanings.    The word _vixen_ was once used as the feminine of _fox_ by the  Southern-English. For _fox_ they said _vox_; for _from_ they said  _vram_; and for the older word _fat_ they said _vat_, as in _wine  vat_. Hence _vixen_ is for _fyxen_, from the masculine _fox_.    _Spinster_ is a relic of a large class of words that existed in Old  and Middle English,[1] but have now lost their original force as  feminines. The old masculine answering to _spinster_ was _spinner_;  but _spinster_ has now no connection with it.    The foreign suffixes are of two kinds:--    [Sidenote: _Foreign suffixes. Unaltered and little used._]    (1) Those belonging to borrowed words, as _czarina_, _senorita_,  _executrix_, _donna_. These are attached to foreign words, and are  never used for words recognized as English.    [Sidenote: _Slightly changed and widely used._]    (2) That regarded as the standard or regular termination of the  feminine, _-ess_ (French _esse_, Low Latin _issa_), the one most used.  The corresponding masculine may have the ending _-er_ (_-or_), but in  most cases it has not. Whenever we adopt a new masculine word, the  feminine is formed by adding this termination _-ess_.    Sometimes the _-ess_ has been added to a word already feminine by the  ending _-ster_; as _seam-str-ess_, _song-str-ess_. The ending _-ster_  had then lost its force as a feminine suffix; it has none now in the  words _huckster_,"]]]
