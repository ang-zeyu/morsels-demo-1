Had any other girl  asked this favor I should have refused her. But Miss Harlowe, in spite of  the shabby way in which she has been treated, is generous enough to  overlook the past, and begs that you be given another chance. It is only  for her sake that I grant it.    \"Also, Miss Crosby, I received no information from Miss Harlowe or any of  her team regarding your recent rude conduct in the gymnasium. The report  came from an entirely different source. You may go; but first you may  apologize to Miss Harlowe, and thank her for what she has done.\"    With a very poor grace, Julia mumbled a few words of apology and thanks  and hurried from the room. The principal looked after her and shook her  head, then turning to Grace, she asked, \"Well, Grace, are you satisfied?\"    Grace thanked her again, and with a light heart sped towards the study  hall. Once more she could look forward to the coming game with pleasant  anticipations.    Julia Crosby had already informed the junior players of the rise in their  fallen fortunes. When school was over they gathered about their leader to  hear the story. Now, Julia, if possible felt more bitter toward Grace than  formerly. It galled her to be compelled to accept anything from Grace's  hands, and she did not intend to let any more of the truth be known than  she could help. This was too good an opportunity to gain popularity to let  slip through her fingers So she put on a mysterious expression and said:    \"Now, see here, girls, I got you into all that trouble, and I made up my  mind to get you out again. Just go ahead and practise for all your worth,  and don't worry about how it all happened.\"    \"Well,\" said Alice Waite, \"it was awfully brave of you to go to Miss  Thompson, even if you are too modest to tell of it. Wasn't it, girls?\"    \"Yes,\" chorused the team. \"Three cheers for our brave captain.\"    Julia, fairly dazzled at her own popularity, smiled a smile of intense  satisfaction. She had produced exactly the impression that she wished.    \"What on earth are those juniors making such a fuss about?\" inquired Nora  O'Malley, as the four chums strolled across the campus toward the gate.  The junior team, headed by Julia, was coming down the walk talking at the  top of their voices.    \"Nothing of any importance, you may be sure,\" said Jessica Bright.  \"'Shallow brooks babble loudest,' you know.\"    \"They seem to be 'babbling' over Julia Crosby just now,\" said Anne, who  had been curiously watching the jubilant juniors.    \"No doubt she has just unfolded some new scheme,\" said Nora sarcastically,  \"that will be practised on the sophomores at the first opportunity.\"    \"Doesn't it seem strange,\" said Grace, who had hitherto offered no  comments, \"that we must always be at sixes and sevens with the juniors?  Such a spirit never existed between classes before. I wonder how it will  all end?\"    \"Don't worry your dear head over those girls, Grace,\" said Anne, patting  Grace's hand. \"They aren't worth it.\"    \"Oh, look girls!\" exclaimed Nora suddenly. \"There is David Nesbit, and he  is coming this way. I haven't seen him for an age.\"    \"Good afternoon, girls,\" said David, lifting his cap. \"It is indeed a  pleasure to see you.\"    \"Why, David,\" said Grace, \"you are quite a stranger. Where have you been  keeping yourself?\"    Anne also looked her pleasure at seeing her old friend.    \"I have been very, very busy with some important business of my own,\" said  David in a mock-pompous tone. Then he announced: \"I am going to give a  party and I am going to invite all of you. Will you come?\"    \"We will!\" cried Nora. \"Dressed in our costliest raiment, at that.\"    \"Never mind about the fine clothes,\" said David, laughing. \"This is to be  a plain, every-day affair.\"    \"Who else is invited, David?\" asked Jessica.    \"Only one other girl beside yourselves has had the honor of receiving an  invitation.\"    \"Miriam?\" queried Grace, unable to conceal a shade of disappointment in  her tone.    \"No, no; not Miriam,\" answered Miriam's brother.    Grace looked relieved. If Miriam joined the party, something unpleasant  was sure to happen. Miriam treasured a spite against Anne for winning the  freshman prize, and never treated her with civility when they chanced to  meet. Grace knew, too, that Miriam's attitude toward her was equally  hostile. She wondered if David knew all these things about his sister.    Whatever he did know of Miriam and her deep-laid plans and schemes, he  divulged to no one. None of the girls had ever heard him say a word  against his sister; although they felt that he deeply disapproved of her  jealousy and false pride.    \"You haven't guessed her name yet,\" smiled David. \"She is one of my best  friends, girls. She has been my sweetheart ever since I was a young man of  five. She's one of the prettiest girls in Oakdale, she's sixty years  young, and her name is----\"    \"Dear Mrs. Gray, of course!\" exclaimed Grace delightedly.    \"And has she accepted your invitation?\" asked Anne.    \"She has,\" replied David, \"and will come in her coach and four, or rather  her carriage and two. You ordinary mortals will be obliged to walk, I  fear.\"    \"But why does she use her 'coach and four,' When she lives in the palace  just next door?\" rhymed Nora.    \"Very good, my child,\" commented David. \"However, what I was about to say  was this: My party is not to be in a house. It is an open-air party. We  are to meet at the Omnibus House, to-morrow afternoon at four o'clock.  Two very distinguished gentlemen have also been invited--Mr. Reddy Brooks  and Mr. Hippy Wingate.\"    A shout of laughter went up from the girls    \"Distinguished, indeed,\" cried Nora. \"It will be a delightful party I am  sure.\"    \"Shall we bring food for Hippy!\"    \"No,\" laughed David. \"Let him eat the apples he finds on the ground. If we  feed him on every festive occasion he will soon be too fat to walk, and we  shall have to roll him about on casters.\"    \"What a terrible fate,\" said Anne smiling.    \"Well, girls? do you promise to attend?\"    \"Yes? indeed!\" cried the four girls.    \"Be sure not to surprise us with a disappointment.\"    \"The main thing is not to disappoint you with the surprise,\" were his  parting words.    \"If all boys were as nice as David the world would be a better place!\"  exclaimed Grace. \"I suppose you can guess what the object of this party  is.\"    \"Never mind, don't mention it,\" said Jessica in a low tone. \"Here come  some other girls, and if they knew what we know, there would be a  multitude instead of a select, private party at the Omnibus House  to-morrow.\"          CHAPTER IV    AN UNFORTUNATE AVIATOR      It was an unusual entertainment that David had provided for his little  circle of intimate friends in the old orchard surrounding the Omnibus  House. There was a look of intense excitement in his eyes, as he stood  awaiting his guests, the following afternoon. Mrs. Gray had already  arrived, and, leaving her carriage to wait for her near the entrance, now  stood by David and helped him receive.    \"It's good to see all my children together again,\" she exclaimed, giving  Anne a gentle hug; for ever since her Christmas house party she had  acquired a sort of proprietary feeling toward these young people. \"I only  wish Tom Gray were to be with us to-day. I should like him to have a share  in the surprise; for you may be sure there is to be a surprise. David  would never have asked us to this lonely place for nothing.\"    \"David is a good old reliable, Mrs. Gray,\" cried Hippy. \"Certainly if I  had imagined for a moment that he would disappoint us, I never should have  dragged my slight frame all this distance.\"    \"Good, loyal old Hippy,\" replied David. \"The surprise is ready, but even  if it had not been, there is no exercise so beneficial to stout people as  walking.\"    \"Well, bring it on, bring it on,\" exclaimed Reddy. \"We are waiting  patiently.\"    \"Curb your impatience, Sorrel Top,\" said David. \"Just follow me, and see  what I have to show you.\"    They helped little Mrs. Gray, who was nimble in spite of her years,  through a broken gap in the wall of the Omnibus House. The old ruin was  more picturesque than, ever in its cloak of five-leafed ivy which the  autumn had touched with red and gold. A lean-to had been built against the  back wall of the building, fitted with a stout door on the inside and a  pair of doors on the outside.    \"I rented this plot of land from the farmer who owns the orchard,\"  explained David, taking a key from his pocket and opening the door in the  stone wall. \"This was about the best place I could think of for  experiments, partly because it's such a lonesome place, and partly because  there is a clear open space of several hundred yards back here without a  tree or bush on it.\"    It was dark inside until he had opened the double doors in the opposite  wall, when the slanting light showed them an aeroplane; not a little  gymnasium model this time, but a full-fledged flying machine, a trim and  graceful object, even at close view.    \"David,\" cried Anne joyously, \"you don't mean to say you've gone and done  it at last?\"    \"I have,\" answered David gravely; \"and I've made two trips with pretty  good success each time.\"    Then everyone talked at once. David was the hero of the hour.    \"David, my dear boy,\" cried Mrs. Gray. \"To think that I should live to see  you an aviator!\"    \"I'm a long way from being one, yet, Mrs. Gray,\" answered David. \"My bird  doesn't always care to fly. There are times when she'd rather stay in her  nest with her wings folded. Of course, I haven't nearly perfected her yet,  so I don't want it mentioned in town until I get things in shape. But I  couldn't wait until then to show it to you, my dear friends, because you  were all interested in it last"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15352"],[0,"Venereal Diseases in New Zealand (1922) (#4)"],[1,"action should be taken to deal with the evil. In 1913 the  British Government appointed a Royal Commission to inquire into the  prevalence of venereal diseases in the United Kingdom, their effects  upon the health of the community, and the means by which these effects  could be alleviated or prevented, it being understood that no return to  the policy or provisions of the Contagious Diseases Acts was to be  regarded as falling within the scope of the inquiry.    The Commission took a great deal of most valuable evidence, and did not  present their final report until 1916. They recommended improved  facilities for diagnosis and treatment, including free clinics. They  came to the conclusion that at that time any system of compulsory  personal notification would fail to secure the advantages claimed. The  Commission added, however, \"it is possible that the situation may be  modified when these facilities for diagnosis and treatment [recommended  by the Commission] have been in operation for some time, and the  question of notification should then be further considered. It is also  possible that when the general public become alive to the grave dangers  arising from venereal disease, notification in some form will be  demanded.\" The Commission supported the adoption of a recommendation by  the Royal Commission on Divorce to the effect that where one of the  parties at the time of marriage is suffering from venereal disease in a  communicable form and the fact is not disclosed by the party, the other  party shall be entitled to obtain a decree annulling the marriage,  provided that the suit is instituted within a year of the celebration of  the marriage, and there has been no marital intercourse after the  discovery of the infection. The Commission urged that more careful  instruction should be provided in regard to moral conduct as bearing  upon sexual relations throughout all types and grades of education. Such  instruction, they urged, should be based upon moral principles and  spiritual considerations, and should not be based only on the physical  consequences of immoral conduct. They also favoured general propaganda  work, and urged that the National Council for Combating Venereal  Diseases should be recognized by Government as an authoritative body for  the purpose of spreading knowledge and giving advice.    Another important Commission, sitting almost simultaneously with that  just referred to, was the National Birth-rate Commission, which began  its labours on the 24th October, 1913, and presented its first Report on  the 28th June, 1916. The Commission was reconstituted, with the Bishop  of Birmingham as Chairman, in 1918, to further consider the question,  and especially in view of the effects of the Great War upon vital  problems of population. Among the terms of reference the Commission were  requested to inquire into \"the present spread of venereal disease, the  chief causes of sterility and degeneracy, and the further menace of  these diseases during demobilization.\" The Commission in their report,  presented in 1920, stated that they realized the difficulties involved  in the introduction of any efficient scheme of compulsory notification  and treatment of venereal diseases, but, they added, they \"feel that it  has now passed the experimental stage both in our colonies and in forty  of the forty-eight of the United States of America, and think it is  advisable for the State to make a trial of compulsory notification and  treatment in this country, provided that there should be no return to  the principles or practice of the Contagious Diseases Act.\" Referring to  the finding of the Royal Commission on Venereal Disease that it would  not be possible at present to organize a satisfactory method of  certification of fitness for marriage, the National Birth-rate  Commission thought this question should now be reconsidered with a view  to legislation. \"If,\" says the report, \"a certificate of health was to  become a legal obligation for persons contemplating marriage, many of  the legal, ethical, and professional difficulties surrounding this  question would be removed.\"    In Sweden, where a Venereal Diseases Law was passed in 1918, stress was  laid on the importance of general enlightenment with regard to venereal  disease and germane subjects, such as sex hygiene. A committee was  appointed, consisting of experts in medicine and pedagogy, to inquire  into the best means of providing such education. Their report, which has  just been issued, is described by the _British Medical Journal_ as a  document of considerable value, promising to become the charter of a new  and complete system of sex education and hygiene in schools throughout  Sweden. Further reference will be made to this document in the section  of this report dealing with education.    The subject of venereal disease has also been considered by more than  one important Medical Conference in Australia and New Zealand.    At a general meeting of the Australasian Medical Congress held in  Melbourne in October, 1908, it was resolved that the executive be  recommended to appoint a committee to investigate and report on the  facts in regard to syphilis. Such a committee was appointed, and  reported to the Congress in Sydney in 1911. In 1914 the Congress was  held in Auckland, and a special committee which had been appointed, with  the Hon. Dr. W.E. Collins, M.L.C., as chairman, presented a valuable  report giving some interesting information in regard to the prevalence  of venereal disease, in New Zealand. The committee recommended that  syphilis be declared a notifiable disease; that notification be  encouraged and discretionary, but not compulsory; and that the Chief  Medical Officer of Health be the only person to whom the notification be  made. They also recommended the provision of laboratories for the  diagnosis of syphilis, and that free treatment for syphilis be provided  in the public hospitals and dispensaries. These recommendations were  embodied in the report adopted by the Congress.    In February of the present year an important Conference, convened by the  Prime Minister of Australia, was held in Parliament House, Melbourne. It  was attended by official representatives of the Health Departments of  all the States, together with representatives from the British Medical  Association, the Women's Medical Staff at the Queen Victoria Hospital  Diseases Clinic in Melbourne, and other scientific and medical  authorities. The Commonwealth subsidizes the work of the States in  combating venereal disease, and the object of the Prime Minister in  calling the Conference was in order that it might inquire into the  effectiveness of the present system of legislation, of administrative  measures, and of clinical methods, with a view of determining whether  the best results were being obtained for the expenditure of the money.    Western Australia has an Act, which came into operation in June, 1916,  providing for what is known as conditional notification of patients,  together with other provisions for the control of venereal disease which  are on a more comprehensive scale than has been attempted anywhere with  the possible exception of Denmark. In December, 1916, Victoria passed a  similar Act, and this example was followed by Queensland, Tasmania, and  New South Wales.    The Conference, answering the several questions put to it, found that a  greater proportion of persons infected with venereal disease were  receiving more effective treatment than before the passing of the  Venereal Diseases Act. In the opinion of the Conference this was due  partly to the passing of legislation and partly to the opening of  clinics affording greater opportunities for free treatment. They  considered the operations of the Act had been more successful in  bringing men under treatment than it had been in the case of women.  Among the opinions expressed by the committee were the following: The  Act was not equally successful in respect of private and hospital  patients in regard to notification, but was equally successful in  respect of securing to both more effective treatment. There has been an  apparent reduction in the prevalence of venereal diseases, and the  Conference were strongly of opinion that the results so far justify the  continuance of these Acts in operation.    The Conference found that venereal diseases are the most potent of all  causes of sterility and of infant and foetal morbidity and mortality. It  recommended, among other remedial measures, that prophylactic depots,  both for males and females, should be established as widely in the  community as possible. Referring to the educational aspect, the  Conference urged that children should be instructed in general  biological facts up to the age of puberty, when more explicit  information concerning facts of sexual life should be given. They urged  on all parents and educational, philanthropic, and religious  organizations the pressing necessity for a sustained campaign, in  co-operation with the medical profession, in order to inculcate in the  community higher ideals of personal hygiene and health.    Lastly, it may be mentioned that, at the instance of Lord Dawson of  Penn, a highly qualified and representative committee of medical men,  with Lord Trevethin as chairman, has been appointed in England to report  to the Minister of Health upon \"the best medical measures for preventing  venereal disease in the civil community, having regard to administrative  practicability, including cost.\" The appointment of such a committee was  requested by Lord Dawson chiefly with a view to obtaining an  authoritative pronouncement on the subject of medical preventive  measures, and the committee's report will be awaited with much interest.
