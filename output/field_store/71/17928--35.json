I could hardly remember where I was when I awoke, and I could almost  hear the silence. Not a tree moaned, not a branch seemed to stir. I  arose and my head came in violent contact with a snag that was not  there when I went to bed. I thought either I must have grown taller or  the tree shorter during the night. As soon as I peered out, the mystery  was explained.    Such a snowstorm I never saw! The snow had pressed the branches down  lower, hence my bumped head. Our fire was burning merrily and the heat  kept the snow from in front. I scrambled out and poked up the fire;  then, as it was only five o'clock, I went back to bed. And then I began  to think how many kinds of idiot I was. Here I was thirty or forty  miles from home, in the mountains where no one goes in the winter and  where I knew the snow got to be ten or fifteen feet deep. But I could  never see the good of moping, so I got up and got breakfast while Baby  put her shoes on. We had our squirrels and more baked potatoes and I  had delicious black coffee.    After I had eaten I felt more hopeful. I knew Mr. Stewart would hunt  for me if he knew I was lost. It was true, he wouldn't know which way  to start, but I determined to rig up \"Jeems\" and turn him loose, for I  knew he would go home and that he would leave a trail so that I could  be found. I hated to do so, for I knew I should always have to be  powerfully humble afterwards. Anyway it was still snowing, great, heavy  flakes; they looked as large as dollars. I didn't want to start \"Jeems\"  until the snow stopped because I wanted him to leave a clear trail. I  had sixteen loads for my gun and I reasoned that I could likely kill  enough food to last twice that many days by being careful what I shot  at. It just kept snowing, so at last I decided to take a little hunt  and provide for the day. I left Jerrine happy with the towel rolled  into a baby, and went along the brow of the mountain for almost a  mile, but the snow fell so thickly that I couldn't see far. Then I  happened to look down into the canon that lay east of us and saw smoke.  I looked toward it a long time, but could make out nothing but smoke,  but presently I heard a dog bark and I knew I was near a camp of some  kind. I resolved to join them, so went back to break my own camp.    At last everything was ready and Jerrine and I both mounted. Of all the  times! If you think there is much comfort, or even security, in riding  a pack-horse in a snowstorm over mountains where there is no road, you  are plumb wrong. Every once in a while a tree would unload its snow  down our backs. \"Jeems\" kept stumbling and threatening to break our  necks. At last we got down the mountain-side, where new danger  confronted us,--we might lose sight of the smoke or ride into a bog.  But at last, after what seemed hours, we came into a \"clearing\" with a  small log house and, what is rare in Wyoming, a fireplace. Three or  four hounds set up their deep baying, and I knew by the chimney and the  hounds that it was the home of a Southerner. A little old man came  bustling out, chewing his tobacco so fast, and almost frantic about his  suspenders, which it seemed he couldn't get adjusted.    As I rode up, he said, \"Whither, friend?\" I said \"Hither.\" Then he  asked, \"Air you spying around for one of them dinged game wardens arter  that deer I killed yisteddy?\" I told him I had never even seen a game  warden and that I didn't know he had killed a deer. \"Wall,\" he said,  \"air you spying around arter that gold mine I diskivered over on the  west side of Baldy?\" But after a while I convinced him that I was no  more nor less than a foolish woman lost in the snow. Then he said,  \"Light, stranger, and look at your saddle.\" So I \"lit\" and looked, and  then I asked him what part of the South he was from. He answered, \"Yell  County, by gum! The best place in the United States, or in the world,  either.\" That was my introduction to Zebulon Pike Parker.    Only two \"Johnny Rebs\" could have enjoyed each other's company as  Zebulon Pike and myself did. He was so small and so old, but so  cheerful and so sprightly, and a real Southerner! He had a big, open  fireplace with backlogs and andirons. How I enjoyed it all! How we  feasted on some of the deer killed \"yisteddy,\" and real corn-pone baked  in a skillet down on the hearth. He was so full of happy recollections  and had a few that were not so happy! He is, in some way, a kinsman of  Pike of Pike's Peak fame, and he came west \"jist arter the wah\" on some  expedition and \"jist stayed.\" He told me about his home life back in  Yell County, and I feel that I know all the \"young uns.\"    There was George Henry, his only brother; and there were Phoebe and  \"Mothie,\" whose real name is Martha; and poor little Mary Ann, whose  death was described so feelingly that no one could keep back the  tears. Lastly there was little Mandy, the baby and his favorite, but  who, I am afraid, was a selfish little beast since she had to have her  prunellas when all the rest of the \"young uns\" had to wear shoes that  old Uncle Buck made out of rawhide. But then \"her eyes were blue as  morning-glories and her hair was jist like corn-silk, so yaller and  fluffy.\" Bless his simple, honest heart! His own eyes are blue and  kind, and his poor, thin little shoulders are so round that they almost  meet in front. How he loved to talk of his boyhood days! I can almost  see his father and George Henry as they marched away to the \"wah\"  together, and the poor little mother's despair as she waited day after  day for some word, that never came.    Poor little Mary Ann was drowned in the bayou, where she was trying to  get water-lilies. She had wanted a white dress all her life and so,  when she was dead, they took down the white cross-bar curtains and  Mother made the little shroud by the light of a tallow dip. But, being  made by hand, it took all the next day, too, so that they buried her by  moonlight down back of the orchard under the big elm where the children  had always had their swing. And they lined and covered her grave with  big, fragrant water-lilies. As they lowered the poor little home-made  coffin into the grave the mockingbirds began to sing and they sang all  that dewy, moonlight night. Then little Mandy's wedding to Judge  Carter's son Jim was described. She wore a \"cream-colored poplin with a  red rose throwed up in it,\" and the lace that was on Grandma's wedding  dress. There were bowers of sweet Southern roses and honeysuckle and  wistaria. Don't you know she was a dainty bride?    At last it came out that he had not heard from home since he left it.  \"Don't you ever write?\" I asked. \"No, I am not an eddicated man,  although I started to school. Yes'm, I started along of the rest, but  they told me it was a Yankee teacher and I was 'fraid, so when I got  most to the schoolhouse I hid in the bushes with my spelling-book, so  that is all the learning I ever got. But my mother was an eddicated  woman, yes'm, she could both read and write. I have the Bible she give  me yit. Yes'm, you jist wait and I'll show you.\" After some rummaging  in a box he came back with a small leather-bound Bible with print so  small it was hard to read. After turning to the record of births and  deaths he handed it to me, his wrinkled old face shining with pride as  he said, \"There, my mother wrote that with her own hand.\" I took the  book and after a little deciphered that \"Zebulon Pike Parker was born  Feb. 10, 1830,\" written in the stiff, difficult style of long ago and  written with pokeberry ink. He said his mother used to read about some  \"old feller that was jist covered with biles,\" so I read Job to him,  and he was full of surprise they didn't \"git some cherry bark and some  sasparilly and bile it good and gin it to him.\"    He had a side room to his cabin, which was his bedroom; so that night  he spread down a buffalo robe and two bearskins before the fire for  Jerrine and me. After making sure there were no moths in them, I spread  blankets over them and put a sleepy, happy little girl to bed, for he  had insisted on making molasses candy for her because they happened to  be born on the same day of the month. And then he played the fiddle  until almost one o'clock. He played all the simple, sweet, old-time  pieces, in rather a squeaky, jerky way, I am afraid, but the music  suited the time and the place.    Next morning he called me early and when I went out I saw such a  beautiful sunrise, well worth the effort of coming to see. I had  thought his cabin in a canon, but the snow had deceived me, for a few  steps from the door the mountains seemed to drop down suddenly for  several hundred feet and the first of the snow peaks seemed to lie  right at our feet. Around its base is a great swamp, in which the swamp  pines grow very thickly and from which a vapor was rising that got  about halfway up the snow peak all around. Fancy to yourself a big  jewel-box of dark green velvet lined with silver chiffon, the snow peak  lying like an immense opal in its center and over all the amber light  of a new day. That is what it looked most like.    Well, we next went to the corral, where I was surprised to find about  thirty head of sheep. Some of them looked like they should have been  sold ten years before. \"Don't you ever sell any of your sheep?\" I  asked. \"No'm. There was a feller come here once and wanted to buy some  of my wethers, but I wouldn't sell any because I didn't need any  money.\" Then he went from animal to animal, caressing each and talking  to them, calling them each by name. He milked his one cow, fed his two  little mules, and then we went back to the house to cook breakfast. We  had delicious venison steak, smoking hot, and hoe-cakes and the  \"bestest\" coffee, and honey.    After breakfast we set out for home. Our pack transferred to one of the  little mules, we rode \"Jeems,\" and Mr. Parker rode"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16643"],[0,"Essays (#4)"],[1,"sailor a rope of the ship.    In this distribution of functions the scholar is the delegated  intellect. In the right state he is _Man Thinking_. In the degenerate  state, when the victim of society, he tends to become a mere thinker,  or, still worse, the parrot of other men's thinking.    In this view of him, as Man Thinking, the whole theory of his office  is contained. Him Nature solicits with all her placid, all her  monitory pictures.[8] Him the past instructs. Him the future invites.  Is not indeed every man a student, and do not all things exist for the  student's behoof? And, finally, is not the true scholar the only true  master? But as the old oracle said, \"All things have two handles:  Beware of the wrong one.\"[9] In life, too often, the scholar errs with  mankind and forfeits his privilege. Let us see him in his school, and  consider him in reference to the main influences he receives.           *       *       *       *       *    I. The first in time and the first in importance of the influences upon  the mind is that of nature. Every day, the sun;[10] and, after sunset,  Night and her stars. Ever the winds blow; ever the grass grows. Every  day, men and women, conversing, beholding and beholden.[11] The scholar  must needs stand wistful and admiring before this great spectacle. He  must settle its value in his mind. What is nature to him? There is never  a beginning, there is never an end, to the inexplicable continuity of  this web of God, but always circular power returning into itself.[12]  Therein it resembles his own spirit, whose beginning, whose ending, he  never can find,--so entire, so boundless. Far too as her splendors  shine, system on system shooting like rays, upward, downward, without  center, without circumference,--in the mass and in the particle, Nature  hastens to render account of herself to the mind. Classification begins.  To the young mind everything is individual, stands by itself. By and by  it finds how to join two things and see in them one nature; then three,  then three thousand; and so, tyrannized over by its own unifying  instinct, it goes on tying things together, diminishing anomalies,  discovering roots running under ground whereby contrary and remote  things cohere and flower out from one stem. It presently learns that  since the dawn of history there has been a constant accumulation and  classifying of facts. But what is classification but the perceiving that  these objects are not chaotic, and are not foreign, but have a law which  is also a law of the human mind? The astronomer discovers that geometry,  a pure abstraction of the human mind, is the measure of planetary  motion. The chemist finds proportions and intelligible method throughout  matter; and science is nothing but the finding of analogy, identity, in  the most remote parts. The ambitious soul sits down before each  refractory fact; one after another reduces all strange constitutions,  all new powers, to their class and their law, and goes on forever to  animate the last fiber of organization, the outskirts of nature, by  insight.    Thus to him, to this school-boy under the bending dome of day, is  suggested that he and it proceed from one Root; one is leaf and one is  flower; relation, sympathy, stirring in every vein. And what is that  root? Is not that the soul of his soul?--A thought too bold?--A dream  too wild? Yet when this spiritual light shall have revealed the law of  more earthly natures,--when he has learned to worship the soul, and to  see that the natural philosophy that now is, is only the first  gropings of its gigantic hand,--he shall look forward to an  ever-expanding knowledge as to a becoming creator.[13] He shall see  that nature is the opposite of the soul, answering to it part for  part. One is seal and one is print. Its beauty is the beauty of his  own mind. Its laws are the laws of his own mind. Nature then becomes  to him the measure of his attainments. So much of nature as he is  ignorant of, so much of his own mind does he not yet possess. And, in  fine, the ancient precept, \"Know thyself,\"[14] and the modern precept,  \"Study nature,\" become at last one maxim.           *       *       *       *       *    II. The next great influence into the spirit of the scholar is the  mind of the Past,--in whatever form, whether of literature, of art, of  institutions, that mind is inscribed. Books are the best type of the  influence of the past, and perhaps we shall get at the truth,--learn  the amount of this influence more conveniently,--by considering their  value alone.    The theory of books is noble. The scholar of the first age received  into him the world around; brooded thereon; gave it the new  arrangement of his own mind, and uttered it again. It came into him  life; it went out from him truth. It came to him short-lived actions;  it went out from him immortal thoughts. It came to him business; it  went from him poetry. It was dead fact; now, it is quick thought. It  can stand, and it can go. It now endures, it now flies, it now  inspires.[15] Precisely in proportion to the depth of mind from which  it issued, so high does it soar, so long does it sing.    Or, I might say, it depends on how far the process had gone, of  transmuting life into truth. In proportion to the completeness of the  distillation, so will the purity and imperishableness of the product  be. But none is quite perfect. As no air-pump can by any means make a  perfect vacuum,[16] so neither can any artist entirely exclude the  conventional, the local, the perishable from his book, or write a book  of pure thought, that shall be as efficient, in all respects, to a  remote posterity, as to contemporaries, or rather to the second age.  Each age, it is found, must write its own books; or rather, each  generation for the next succeeding. The books of an older period will  not fit this.    Yet hence arises a grave mischief. The sacredness which attaches to  the act of creation, the act of thought, is instantly transferred to  the record. The poet chanting was felt to be a divine man. Henceforth  the chant is divine also. The writer was a just and wise spirit.  Henceforward it is settled the book is perfect; as love of the hero  corrupts into worship of his statue. Instantly the book becomes  noxious.[17] The guide is a tyrant. We sought a brother, and lo, a  governor. The sluggish and perverted mind of the multitude, always  slow to open to the incursions of Reason, having once so opened,  having once received this book, stands upon it, and makes an outcry if  it is disparaged. Colleges are built on it. Books are written on it by  thinkers, not by Man Thinking, by men of talent, that is, who start  wrong, who set out from accepted dogmas, not from their own sight of  principles. Meek young men grow up in libraries, believing it their  duty to accept the views which Cicero, which Locke,[18] which  Bacon,[19] have given; forgetful that Cicero, Locke and Bacon were  only young men in libraries when they wrote these books.    Hence, instead of Man Thinking, we have the bookworm. Hence the  book-learned class, who value books, as such; not as related to nature  and the human constitution, but as making a sort of Third Estate[20]  with the world and soul. Hence the restorers of readings,[21] the  emendators,[22] the bibliomaniacs[23] of all degrees. This is bad;  this is worse than it seems.    Books are the best of things, well used; abused, among the worst. What  is the right use? What is the one end which all means go to effect?  They are for nothing but to inspire.[24] I had better never see a book  than to be warped by its attraction clean out of my own orbit, and  made a satellite instead of a system. The one thing in the world of  value is the active soul,--the soul, free, sovereign, active. This  every man is entitled to; this every man contains within him, although  in almost all men obstructed, and as yet unborn. The soul active sees  absolute truth and utters truth, or creates. In this action it is  genius; not the privilege of here and there a favorite, but the sound  estate of every man.[25] In its essence it is progressive. The book,  the college, the school of art, the institution of any kind, stop with  some past utterance of genius. This is good, say they,--let us hold by  this. They pin me down.[26] They look backward and not forward. But  genius always looks forward. The eyes of man are set in his forehead,  not in his hindhead. Man hopes. Genius creates. To create,--to  create,--is the proof of a divine presence. Whatever talents may be,  if the man create not, the pure efflux of the Deity is not  his;[27]--cinders and smoke there may be, but not yet flame. There are  creative manners, there are creative actions, and creative words;  manners, actions, words, that is, indicative of no custom or  authority, but springing spontaneous from the mind's own sense of good  and fair.    On the other part, instead of being its own seer, let it receive  always from another mind its truth, though it were in torrents of  light, without periods of solitude, inquest, and self-recovery; and a  fatal disservice[28] is done. Genius is always sufficiently the enemy  of genius by over-influence.[29] The literature of every nation bear  me witness. The English dramatic poets have Shakespearized now for two  hundred years.[30]    Undoubtedly there is a right way of reading, so it be sternly  subordinated. Man Thinking must not be subdued by his instruments.  Books are for the scholar's idle times. When he can read God directly,  the hour is too precious to be wasted in other men's transcripts of  their readings.[31] But when the intervals of darkness come, as come  they must,--when the soul seeth not, when the sun is hid and the stars  withdraw their shining,--we repair to the lamps which were kindled by  their ray, to guide our steps to the East again, where the dawn  is.[32] We hear, that we may speak.
