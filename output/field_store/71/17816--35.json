The audience to  be sure were the members of a debating club, which he had organized. He  was very ambitious and was doubtless looking forward to a political  career. He saw the value of extempore speech to the man with a future,  and he wisely determined to possess himself of its advantage. He little  dreamt, however, to what great use he was to devote it in later years.  There were other points worth noting at this time, and which seemed to  prophecy for him a future of distinction. He possessed a most attractive  personality. His energy and geniality, his keen sense of humor, his  social and bouyant disposition, even his positive and opinionated  temper, were sources of popular strength to him. People were strongly  drawn to him. His friends were devoted to him. He had that quality,  which we vaguely term magnetic, the quality of attaching others to us,  and maintaining over them the ascendency of our character and ideas.    In the midst of all this progress along so many lines, the days of his  apprenticeship in the _Herald_ office came to an end. He was just  twenty. With true Yankee enterprise and pluck, he proceeded to do for  himself what for seven years he had helped to do for another--publish a  newspaper. And with a brave heart the boy makes his launch on the  uncertain sea of local journalism and becomes editor and publisher of a  real, wide-awake sheet, which he calls the _Free Press._ The paper was  independent in politics and proved worthy of its name during the six  months that Garrison sat in the managerial chair. Here is the tone which  the initial number of the paper holds to the public: \"As to the  political course of the _Free Press_, it shall be, in the widest sense  of the term, _independent_. The publisher does not mean by this, to rank  amongst those who are of everybody's and of nobody's opinion; ... nor  one of whom the old French proverb says: _Il ne soit sur quel pied  danser_. [He knows not on which leg to dance.] Its principles shall be  open, magnanimous and free. It shall be subservient to no party or body  of men; and neither the craven fear of loss, nor the threats of the  disappointed, nor the influence of power, shall ever awe one single  opinion into silence. Honest and fair discussion it will court; and its  columns will be open to all temperate and intelligent communications  emanating from whatever political source. In fine we will say with  Cicero: 'Reason shall prevail with him more than popular opinion.' They  who like this avowal may extend their encouragement; and if any feel  dissatisfied with it, they must act accordingly. The publisher cannot  condescend to solicit their support.\" This was admirable enough in its  way, but it was poor journalism some will say. And without doubt when  judged by the common commercial standard it _was_ poor journalism. In  this view it is a remarkable production, but in another aspect it is  still more remarkable in that it took with absolute accuracy the measure  of the man. As a mental likeness it is simply perfect. At no time during  his later life did the picture cease to be an exact moral representation  of his character. It seems quite unnecessary, therefore, to record that  he proceeded immediately to demonstrate that it was no high sounding and  insincere declaration. For in the second number, he mentions with that  singular serenity, which ever distinguished him on such occasions, the  discontinuance of the paper on account of matter contained in the first  issue, by ten indignant subscribers. \"Nevertheless,\" he adds, \"our  happiness at the loss of such subscribers is not a whit abated. We _beg_  no man's patronage, and shall ever erase with the same cheerfulness that  we insert the name of any individual.... Personal or political offence  we shall studiously avoid--truth _never_.\" Here was plainly a wholly new  species of the _genus homo_ in the editorial seat. What, expect to make  a newspaper pay and not beg for patronage? Why the very idea was enough  to make newspaperdom go to pieces with laughter. Begging for patronage,  howling for subscribers, cringing, crawling, changing color like the  chameleon, howling for Barabbas or bellowing against Jesus, all these  things must your newspaper do to prosper. On them verily hang the whole  law and all the profits of modern journalism. This is what the devil of  competition was doing in that world when William Lloyd Garrison entered  it. It took him up into an exceedingly high mountain, we may be certain,  and offered him wealth, position, and power, if he would do what all  others were doing. And he would not. He went on editing and publishing  his paper for six months regardful only of what his reason  approved--regardless always of the disapproval of others. Not once did  he palter with his convictions or juggle with his self-respect for the  sake of pelf or applause. His human horizon was contracted, to be sure.  It could hardly be otherwise in one so young. His world was his country,  and patriotism imposed limits upon his affections. \"Our country, our  whole country, and nothing but our country,\" was the ardent motto of the  _Free Press_. The love of family comes, in the order of growth, before  the love of country; and the love of country precedes the love of all  mankind. \"First the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear,\"  is the great law of love in the soul as of corn in the soil. Besides  this contraction of the affections, there was also manifest in his first  journalistic venture a deficiency in the organ of vision, a failure to  see into things and their relations. What he saw he reported faithfully,  suppressing nothing, adding nothing. But the objects which passed across  the disk of his editoral intelligence were confined almost entirely to  the surface of things, to the superficies of national life. He had not  the ken at twenty to penetrate beneath the happenings of current  politics. Of the existence of slavery as a supreme reality, we do not  think that he then had the faintest suspicion. No shadow of its  tremendous influence as a political power seemed to have arrested for a  brief instant his attention. He could copy into his paper this atrocious  sentiment which Edward Everett delivered in Congress, without the  slightest comment or allusion. \"Sir, I am no soldier. My habits and  education are very unmilitary, but there is no cause in which I would  sooner buckle a knapsack on my back, and put a musket on my shoulder  than that of putting down a servile insurrection at the South.\" The  reason is plain enough. Slavery was a _terra incognito_ to him then, a  book of which he had not learned the ABC. Mr. Everett's language made no  impression on him, because he had not the key to interpret its  significance. What he saw, that he set down for his readers, without  fear or favor. He had not seen slavery, knew nothing of the evil.  Acquaintance with the deeper things of life, individual or national,  comes only with increasing years, they are hardly for him who has not  yet reached his majority. Slavery was the very deepest thing in the life  of the nation sixty-four years ago. And if Garrison did not then so  understand it, neither did his contemporaries, the wisest and greatest  of them so understand it. The subject of all others which attracted his  attention, and kept his editorial pen busy, was the claim of  Massachusetts for indemnity from the general government, for certain  disbursements made by her for the defence of her sea-coast during the  war of 1812. This matter, which forms but a mere dust point in the  perspective of history, his ardent young mind mistook for a principal  object, erected into a permanent question in the politics of the times.  But the expenditure of enormous energies upon things of secondary and of  even tertiary importance, to the neglect of others of prime and lasting  interest, is supremely human. He was errant where all men go astray. But  the schoolmaster of the nation was abroad, and was training this young  man for the work he was born to do. These six months were, therefore,  not wasted, for in the university of experience he did ever prove  himself an apt scholar. One lesson he had learned, which he never needed  to relearn. Just what that lesson was, he tells in his valedictory to  the subscribers of the _Free Press_, as follows: \"This is a time-serving  age; and he who attempts to walk uprightly or speak honestly, cannot  rationally calculate upon speedy wealth or preferment.\" A sad lesson, to  be sure, for one so young to learn so thoroughly. Perhaps some reader  will say that this was cynical, the result of disappointment. But it was  not cynical, neither was it the result of disappointment. It was  unvarnished truth, and more's the pity, but truth it was none the less.  It was one of those hard facts, which he of all men, needed to know at  the threshold of his experience with the world. Such a revelation proves  disastrous to the many who go down to do business in that world.  Ordinary and weak and neutral moral constitutions are wrecked on this  reef set in the human sea. Like a true mariner he had written it boldly  on his chart. There at such and such a point in the voyage for the  golden fleece, were the rocks and the soul-devouring dragons of the way.  Therefore, oh! my soul, beware. What, indeed, would this argonaut of the  press take in exchange for his soul? Certainly not speedy wealth nor  preferment. Ah! he could not praise where he ought to reprobate; could  not reprobate where praise should be the meed. He had no money and  little learning, but he had a conscience and he knew that he must be  true to that conscience, come to him either weal or woe. Want renders  most men vulnerable, but to it, he appeared, at this early age,  absolutely invulnerable.

The following extract  from his very instructive book on Lake Superior explains this view:  \"There are in animals peculiar adaptations which are characteristic of  their species, and which cannot be supposed to have arisen from  subordinate influences. Those which live in shoals cannot be supposed to  have been created in single pairs. Those which are made to be the food  of others cannot have been created in the same proportions as those  which live upon them. Those which are everywhere found in innumerable  specimens must have been introduced in numbers capable of maintaining  their normal proportions to those which live isolated and are  comparatively and constantly fewer. For we know that this harmony in the  numerical proportions between animals is one of the great laws of  nature. The circumstance that species occur within definite limits where  no obstacles prevent their wider distribution leads to the further  inference that these limits were assigned to them from the beginning,  and so we should come to the final conclusion that the order which  prevails throughout nature is intentional, that it is regulated by the  limits marked out on the first day of creation, and that it has been  maintained unchanged through ages with no other modifications than those  which the higher intellectual powers of man enable him to impose on some  few animals more closely connected with him.\"[3]    These opinions of some of the most eminent and influential writers of  the pre-Darwinian age seem to us, now, either altogether obsolete or  positively absurd; but they nevertheless exhibit the mental condition of  even the most advanced section of scientific men on the problem of the  nature and origin of species. They render it clear that,  notwithstanding the vast knowledge and ingenious reasoning of Lamarck,  and the more general exposition of the subject by the author of the  _Vestiges of Creation_, the first step had not been taken towards a  satisfactory explanation of the derivation of any one species from any  other. Such eminent naturalists as Geoffroy Saint Hilaire, Dean Herbert,  Professor Grant, Von Buch, and some others, had expressed their belief  that species arose as simple varieties, and that the species of each  genus were all descended from a common ancestor; but none of them gave a  clue as to the law or the method by which the change had been effected.  This was still \"the great mystery.\" As to the further question--how far  this common descent could be carried; whether distinct families, such as  crows and thrushes, could possibly have descended from each other; or,  whether all birds, including such widely distinct types as wrens,  eagles, ostriches, and ducks, could all be the modified descendants of a  common ancestor; or, still further, whether mammalia, birds, reptiles,  and fishes, could all have had a common origin;--these questions had  hardly come up for discussion at all, for it was felt that, while the  very first step along the road of \"transmutation of species\" (as it was  then called) had not been made, it was quite useless to speculate as to  how far it might be possible to travel in the same direction, or where  the road would ultimately lead to.      _The Problem before Darwin_.    It is clear, then, that what was understood by the \"origin\" or the  \"transmutation\" of species before Darwin's work appeared, was the  comparatively simple question whether the allied species of each genus  had or had not been derived from one another and, remotely, from some  common ancestor, by the ordinary method of reproduction and by means of  laws and conditions still in action and capable of being thoroughly  investigated. If any naturalist had been asked at that day whether,  supposing it to be clearly shown that all the different species of each  genus had been derived from some one ancestral species, and that a full  and complete explanation were to be given of how each minute difference  in form, colour, or structure might have originated, and how the  several peculiarities of habit and of geographical distribution might  have been brought about--whether, if this were done, the \"origin of  species\" would be discovered, the great mystery solved, he would  undoubtedly have replied in the affirmative. He would probably have  added that he never expected any such marvellous discovery to be made in  his lifetime. But so much as this assuredly Mr. Darwin has done, not  only in the opinion of his disciples and admirers, but by the admissions  of those who doubt the completeness of his explanations. For almost all  their objections and difficulties apply to those larger differences  which separate genera, families, and orders from each other, not to  those which separate one species from the species to which it is most  nearly allied, and from the remaining species of the same genus. They  adduce such difficulties as the first development of the eye, or of the  milk-producing glands of the mammalia; the wonderful instincts of bees  and of ants; the complex arrangements for the fertilisation of orchids,  and numerous other points of structure or habit, as not being  satisfactorily explained. But it is evident that these peculiarities had  their origin at a very remote period of the earth's history, and no  theory, however complete, can do more than afford a probable conjecture  as to how they were produced. Our ignorance of the state of the earth's  surface and of the conditions of life at those remote periods is very  great; thousands of animals and plants must have existed of which we  have no record; while we are usually without any information as to the  habits and general life-history even of those of which we possess some  fragmentary remains; so that the truest and most complete theory would  not enable us to solve _all_ the difficult problems which the whole  course of the development of life upon our globe presents to us.    What we may expect a true theory to do is to enable us to comprehend and  follow out in some detail those changes in the form, structure, and  relations of animals and plants which are effected in short periods of  time, geologically speaking, and which are now going on around us. We  may expect it to explain satisfactorily most of the lesser and  superficial differences which distinguish one species from another. We  may expect it to throw light on the mutual relations of the animals and  plants which live together in any one country, and to give some rational  account of the phenomena presented by their distribution in different  parts of the world. And, lastly, we may expect it to explain many  difficulties and to harmonise many incongruities in the excessively  complex affinities and relations of living things. All this the  Darwinian theory undoubtedly does. It shows us how, by means of some of  the most universal and ever-acting laws in nature, new species are  necessarily produced, while the old species become extinct; and it  enables us to understand how the continuous action of these laws during  the long periods with which geology makes us acquainted is calculated to  bring about those greater differences presented by the distinct genera,  families, and orders into which all living things are classified by  naturalists. The differences which these present are all of the same  _nature_ as those presented by the species of many large genera, but  much greater in _amount_; and they can all be explained by the action of  the same general laws and by the extinction of a larger or smaller  number of intermediate species. Whether the distinctions between the  higher groups termed Classes and Sub-kingdoms may be accounted for in  the same way is a much more difficult question. The differences which  separate the mammals, birds, reptiles, and fishes from each other,  though vast, yet seem of the same nature as those which distinguish a  mouse from an elephant or a swallow from a goose. But the vertebrate  animals, the mollusca, and the insects, are so radically distinct in  their whole organisation and in the very plan of their structure, that  objectors may not unreasonably doubt whether they can all have been  derived from a common ancestor by means of the very same laws as have  sufficed for the differentiation of the various species of birds or of  reptiles.      _The Change of Opinion effected by Darwin_.    The point I wish especially to urge is this. Before Darwin's work  appeared, the great majority of naturalists, and almost without  exception the whole literary and scientific world, held firmly to the  belief that _species_ were realities, and had not been derived from  other species by any process accessible to us; the different species of  crow and of violet they are now, and to have originated by some totally  unknown process so far removed from ordinary reproduction that it was  usually spoken of as \"special creation.\" There was, then, no question of  the origin of families, orders, and classes, because the very first step  of all, the \"origin of species,\" was believed to be an insoluble  problem. But now this is all changed. The whole scientific and literary  world, even the whole educated public, accepts, as a matter of common  knowledge, the origin of species from other allied species by the  ordinary process of natural birth. The idea of special creation or any  altogether exceptional mode of production is absolutely extinct! Yet  more: this is held also to apply to many higher groups as well as to the  species of a genus, and not even Mr. Darwin's severest critics venture  to suggest that the primeval bird, reptile, or fish must have been  \"specially created.\""]]]
