The question must be left for determination if possible by  excavation.    In the southern central part of the map is shown another excavation,  covering a larger area than any of the others, of very irregular outline  and from 3 to 4 feet deep. It is apparently older than the others and  probably furnished the material for the house structures northeast and  southwest of it. Bordering the depression on the south there are some  low mounds, almost obliterated, which probably were the sites of other  house structures.    Scattered about the area shown on the map there are several small  depressions, usually more regular in outline than those described. The  best example is situated near the northeastern corner of the area. It is  situated in the point of a low promontory, is about 3 feet deep, almost  regularly oval in outline, and measures about 50 by 100 feet. A similar  depression less than 2 feet deep occurs near the northwest corner of the  area, and immediately south of the last there is another, more irregular  in outline, and nearly 3 feet deep. There are also some small  depressions in the immediate vicinity of the Casa Grande ruin and of the  mounds north of it.    With a single exception none of these depressions are so situated that  they could be used as reservoirs for the storage of water collected from  the surface, and the catchment area of the depressions is so small and  the rate of evaporation in this area so great that their use as  reservoirs is out of the question. It is probable that all of the  smaller depressions represent simply sites where building material was  obtained. Possibly the ground at these points furnished more suitable  material than elsewhere, and, if so, the builders may have taken the  trouble to transport it several hundred yards rather than follow the  usual practice of using material within a few feet of the site. This  hypothesis would explain the large size of the depressions, otherwise an  anomalous feature.      CASA GRANDE RUIN.    _State of Preservation._    The area occupied by the Casa Grande ruin is insignificant as compared  with that of the entire group, yet it has attracted the greater  attention because it comprises practically all the walls still standing.  There is only one small fragment of wall east of the main structure and  another south of it.    The ruin is especially interesting because it is the best preserved  example now remaining of a type of structure which, there is reason to  believe, was widely distributed throughout the Gila valley, and which,  so far as now known, is not found elsewhere. The conditions under which  pueblo architecture developed in the north were peculiar, and stamped  themselves indelibly on the house structures there found. Here in the  south there is a radical change in physical environment: even the  available building material was different, and while it is probable that  a systematic investigation of this field will show essentially the same  ideas that in the north are worked out in stone, here embodied in a  different material and doubtless somewhat modified to suit the changed  environment, yet any general conclusion based on the study of a single  ruin would be unsafe. In the present state of knowledge of this field it  is not advisable to attempt more than a detailed description, embodying,  however, a few inferences, applicable to this ruin only, which seem well  supported by the evidence obtained.    The Casa Grande ruin is located near the southwestern corner of the  group, and the ground surface for miles about it in every direction is  so flat that from the summit of the walls an immense stretch of country  is brought under view. On the east is the broad valley of Gila river  rising in a great plain to a distant range of mountains. About a mile  and a half toward the north a fringe of cottonwood trees marks the  course of the river, beyond which the plain continues, broken somewhat  by hills and buttes, until the view is closed by the Superstition  mountains. On the northwest the valley of Gila river runs into the  horizon, with a few buttes here and there. On the west lies a range of  mountains closing the valley in that direction, while toward the  southwest and south it extends until in places it meets the horizon,  while in other places it is closed by ranges of mountain blue and misty  in the distance. In an experience of some years among northern ruins,  many of them located with special reference to outlook over tillable  lands, the writer has found no other ruin so well situated as this.    The character of the site occupied by the ruin indicates that it belongs  to a late date if not to the final period in the occupancy of this  region, a period when by reason of natural increase of numbers, or  perhaps aggregation of related gentes, the defense motive no longer  dominated the selection of a village site, but reliance was placed on  numbers and character of structures, and the builders felt free to  select a site with reference only to their wants as a horticultural  people. This period or stage has been reached by many of the Pueblo  tribes, although mostly within the historical period; but some of them,  the Tusayan for example, are still in a prior stage.    [Illustration: Pl. LIV: Standing Wall near Casa Grande.]    A ground plan of the ruin is shown in plate LII, and a general view in  plate LIII. The area covered and inclosed by standing walls is about 43  feet by 59 feet, but the building is not exactly rectangular, and the  common statement that it faces the cardinal points is erroneous. The  variation from the magnetic north is shown on the ground plan, which was  made in December, 1890. The building comprised three central rooms, each  approximately 10 by 24 feet, arranged side by side with the longer axes  north and south, and two other rooms, each about 9 by 35 feet, occupying  respectively the northern and southern ends of the building, and  arranged transversely across the ends of the central rooms, with the  longer axes running east and west. Except the central room, which was  three stories in height, all the rooms were two stories above the  ground. The northeastern and southeastern corners of the structure have  fallen, and large blocks of the material of which they were composed are  strewn upon the ground in the vicinity. It is probable that the  destruction of these corners prior to that of the rest of the building  was due to the disintegration of minor walls connected with them and  extending, as shown by the ridges on the ground plan, northward from the  northeastern corner and eastward from the southeastern corner. These  walls doubtless formed part of the original structure and were probably  erected with it; otherwise the corners of the main structure would not  have been torn out or strained enough to fall before the rest of the  building was affected.    It is not likely that the main building originally stood alone as at  present. On the contrary there is every reason to suppose that it was  connected with other buildings about 75 feet east of it, now marked by a  bit of standing wall shown on the map (plate LI), and probably also with  a small structure about 170 feet south of it, shown in plate LIV. These  connections seem to have been by open courts inclosed by walls and not  by continuous buildings. The court east of the ruin is well marked by  the contours and seems to have been entered by a gateway or opening at  its southeastern corner.      _Dimensions._    It is probable that the area immediately adjacent to the ruin, and now  covered by mounds, carried buildings of the same time with the main  structure and was occupied contemporaneously with it or nearly so. This  area, well marked on the map, measures about 400 feet north and south,  and 240 feet east and west. It is not rectangular, although the eastern  and western sides, now marked by long ridges, are roughly parallel. The  northeastern corner does not conform to a rectangular plan, and the  southern side is not more than half closed by the low ridge which  extends partly across it. This area is doubtless the one measured in  1776, by Padre Font, whose description, was copied by later writers, and  whose measurements were applied by Humboldt and others to the ruin  itself. Font gave his measurements as those of a circumscribing wall,  and his inference has been adopted by many, in fact most, later writers.  A circumscribing wall is an anomalous feature, in the experience of the  writer, and a close inspection of the general map will show that Font's  inference is hardly justified by the condition of the remains today. It  seems more likely that the area in question was covered by groups of  buildings and rows of rooms, connected by open courts, and forming an  outline sometimes regular for a considerable distance, but more often  irregular, after the manner of pueblo structures today. The long north  and south ridge which forms the southeastern corner of the area, with  other ridges extending westward, is quite wide on top, wide enough to  accommodate a single row of rooms of the same width as those of the  ruin, and it is hardly reasonable to suppose that a wall would be built  10 or 12 feet wide when one of 4 feet would serve every purpose to which  it could possibly be put. Furthermore, the supposition of an inclosing  wall does not leave any reasonable explanation of the transverse ridges  above mentioned, nor of the long ridge which runs southward from the  southeastern corner of the ruin.    The exterior walls rise to a height of from 20 to 25 feet above the  ground. This height accommodated two stories, but the top of the wall is  now 1 to 2 feet higher than the roof level of the second story. The  middle room or space was built up three stories high and the walls are  now 28 to 30 feet above the ground level. The tops of the walls, while  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17488"],[0,"The Repair of Casa Grande Ruin, Arizona, in 1891 (#4)"],[1," had in the meantime been appointed  honorary custodian of the ruin, generously undertook to look after the  work without compensation, and on its conclusion the small sum remaining  ($15) was turned over to him, thus exhausting the appropriation. In the  sundry civil appropriation act for the year ending June 30, 1893,  provision was made for a salaried custodian of the ruin, and Mr  Whittemore was appointed to this position. Similar provision has been  continued from year to year to the present time.    It is to be regretted that the necessities of the case, imposed by the  limited amount appropriated, compelled the fixing of a maximum amount of  work so far below the amount necessary that the repair of the ruin is  incomplete. Had it been possible to carry out the plans, it is believed  that the ruin would have stood unchanged for many decades, if not for a  century. Should further provision be made for the continuation of the  work, it should include an item for the fencing of the area covered by  the ruins or of the reservation, and possibly an item for the  construction of a roof.    It is not clear that a roof is absolutely necessary, but it is certain  that it would be very undesirable. The region where this rain occurs has  probably less rainfall than any other part of the United States, but it  must not be forgotten that while rainstorms are infrequent they are  sometimes violent, and what damage they do may be done in a few hours.  All the items for the repair of the ruin, except that pertaining to a  roof, were so devised that the ruin was not materially disfigured or  changed, and were they fully carried out the ruin would present much the  same general appearance as before. It is important that this appearance  should be preserved as far as possible, but it can not be maintained if  a roof is erected over the walls. As four years have elapsed since the  completion of the work, it should be possible now to determine whether  atmospheric erosion has played a material part in the work of  destruction.[1]        [Footnote 1: See the letter of the Director of the Bureau of      American Ethnology to the Secretary of the Interior regarding the      examination of Casa Grande by Mr W J McGee in the supplement to      the present paper.]    In the original plans and in the specifications which formed part of the  contract (although this section was not operative) a plan for a roof was  included. Such a structure, if erected at all, should be made as  inconspicuous as possible and should be supported entirely from within  the building. The system of framing employed might safely be left to the  contractor if he were made responsible for the strength of the completed  structure.      RESERVATION OF THE LAND    The final step in the execution of the law quoted was taken June 22,  1892. On that date the recommendation of the writer to the Director of  the Geological Survey, referred by him to the Secretary of the Interior  and by the latter to the President, was finally approved, and it was  ordered that an area of land sufficient for the preservation of the  ruin, and comprising in all 480 acres, be reserved under authority of  act of Congress approved March 2, 1889. This area is shown on the map  reproduced in plate CXXV, the base of which is a map accompanying the  report of Mr H. C. Rizer.    The letter of the Secretary of the Interior recommending the reservation  of the Casa Grande tract, with its indorsement by the President, is as  follows:      Department of the Interior,        _Washington, June 20, 1893_.      Sir: I have the honor to recommend that the SW. 1/4 SW. 1/4, SE. 1/4 SW.    1/4, SW. 1/4 SE. 1/4 section 9, NW. 1/4, NW. 1/4 NE. 1/4, SW. 1/4 NE. 1/4, NW. 1/4 SW.    1/4, NE. 1/4 SW. 1/4, and NW. 1/4 SE. 1/4 section 16, all in township 5 south,    range 8 east, Gila and Salt river meridian, Arizona, containing 480    acres more or less, and including the Casa Grande ruin, be reserved    in accordance with the authority vested in you by the act of March    2, 1889 (25 Stat., 961), for the protection of the ruin.      The Director of the Bureau of Ethnology requests that the    reservation be made, and the Acting Commissioner of the General Land    Office knows of no objection to such action.      Very respectfully,        John W. Noble,            _Secretary_.      The President.        [_Indorsement by the President_]            Executive Mansion, _June 23, 1892_.      Let the lands described within be reserved for the protection of the    Casa Grande ruin as recommended by the Secretary of the Interior.                    Benj. Harrison.    The limits of this reservation are laid down on the plat of the survey  of said township in the General Land Office, and the reservation is now  under the control of the Secretary of the Interior.      SPECIMENS FOUND IN THE EXCAVATIONS    In the course of the excavations a number of specimens of archeologic  interest were unearthed. These were all preserved and on the conclusion  of the work were forwarded to the National Museum in Washington, in  compliance with the terms of the contract.
