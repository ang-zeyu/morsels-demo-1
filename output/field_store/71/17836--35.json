This act, more than all other acts, laid the ax at the root of the evil.  It is false to say he had no other faults.    The hosts still stand in strangest plight. That last still night. That  lasts till night. On either side an ocean exists. On neither side a notion  exists. Among the rugged rocks the restless ranger ran. I said pop-u-lar,  not  pop'lar. I said pre-vail, not pr'vail. I said be-hold, not b'hold.    Think'st thou so meanly of my Phocion? Henceforth look to your hearths.  Canst thou minister to a mind diseased? A thousand shrieks for hopeless  mercy call.        ACCENT.    Accent, marked thus ('), is an increased force of voice upon some one  syllable of a word; as,  Col'o-ny, bot'a-ny; re-mem'ber, im-por'tant; rec-ol-lect', rep-re-sent'.  In the words col'o-ny and bot'a-ny, the first syllable is accented. In the  words re-mem'ber and im-por'tant, the second syllable is accented. In the  words rec-ol-lect' and rep-re-sent', the third  syllable is accented.        INFLECTION.    Inflection is an upward or downward slide of the voice. The Rising  Inflection, sometimes marked thus ('), is an upward slide of the voice.    Examples    Has he come'?  Has he gone?  Are you sick'?  Will you go'?  Are they here'?      The Falling Inflection, marked thus (') is a downward slide of the voice.    Examples    They are here.  He has gone.  He has come  I will go.  I am well.      Let the pupil practice these examples until he is perfectly familiar with  the rising and falling inflections.    Are you sick or well?      Will you go, or stay?  Did he ride, or walk?      Is it black, or white?  Is he rich, or poor?       Are they old, or young?  Did you say cap, or cat?   I said cat, not cap.  Did you say am, or ham?    I said ham, not am.      Is the dog white', or black'? The dog is black', not white'.  Did you say and', or hand'? I said and', not hand'.  Is the tree large', or small'? The tree is small', not large'.  Are the apples sweet', or sour'? The apples are sour' not sweet'.  Is the tide high', or low'? The tide is high', not low'.  Did you say play', or pray'? I said pray', not play'.          MCGUFFEY'S FOURTH READER.        I. PERSEVERANCE. (25)    1. \"Will you give my kite a lift?\" said my little nephew to his sister,  after trying in vain to make it fly by dragging it along the ground. Lucy  very kindly took it up and threw it into the air, but, her brother  neglecting to run off at the same moment, the kite fell down again.    2. \"Ah! now, how awkward you are!\" said the little fellow. \"It was your  fault entirely,\" answered his sister. \"Try again, children,\" said I.    3. Lucy once more took up the kite. But now John was in too great a hurry;  he ran off so suddenly that he twitched the kite out of her hand, and it  fell flat as before. \"Well, who is to blame now?\" asked Lucy. \"Try again,\"  said I.    4. They did, and with more care; but a side wind coming suddenly, as Lucy  let go the kite, it was blown against some shrubs, and the tail became  entangled in a moment, leaving the poor kite hanging with its head  downward.    5. \"There, there!\" exclaimed John, \"that comes of your throwing it all to  one side.\" \"As if I could make the wind blow straight,\" said Lucy. In the  meantime, I went to the kite's assistance; and having disengaged the long  tail, I rolled it up, saying, \"Come, children, there are too many trees  here; let us find a more open space, and then try again.\"    6. We presently found a nice grassplot, at one side of which I took my  stand; and all things being prepared, I tossed the kite up just as little  John ran off. It rose with all the dignity of a balloon, and promised a  lofty flight; but John, delighted to find it pulling so hard at the  string, stopped short to look upward and admire. The string slackened, the  kite wavered, and, the wind not being very favorable, down came the kite  to the grass. \"O John, you should not have stopped,\" said I. \"However, try  again.\"    7. \"I won't try any more,\" replied he, rather sullenly. \"It is of no use,  you see. The kite won't fly, and I don't want to be plagued with it any  longer.\" \"Oh, fie, my little man! would you give up the sport, after all  the pains we have taken both to make and to fly the kite? A few  disappointments ought not to discourage us. Come, I have wound up your  string, and now try again.\"    8. And he did try, and succeeded, for the kite was carried upward on the  breeze as lightly as a feather; and when the string was all out, John  stood in great delight, holding fast the stick and gazing on the kite,  which now seemed like a little white speck in the blue sky. \"Look, look,  aunt, how high it flies! and it pulls like a team of horses, so that I can  hardly hold it. I wish I had a mile of string: I am sure it would go to  the end of it.\"    9. After enjoying the sight as long as he pleased, little John proceeded  to roll up the string slowly; and when the kite fell, he took it up with  great glee, saying that it was not at all hurt, and that it had behaved  very well. \"Shall we come out to-morrow, aunt, after lessons, and try  again?\"    10. \"I have no objection, my dear, if the weather is fine. And now, as we  walk home, tell me what you have learned from your morning's sport.\" \"I  have learned to fly my kite properly.\" \"You may thank aunt for it,  brother,\" said Lucy, \"for you would have given it up long ago, if she had  not persuaded you to try again.\"    11. \"Yes, dear children, I wish to teach you the value of perseverance,  even when nothing more depends upon it than the flying of a kite. Whenever  you fail in your attempts to do any good thing, let your motto be,--try  again.\"      DEFINITIONS.--In defining words, that meaning is given which is  appropriate to them in the connection in which they are used.      4.

'T is a lesson you should heed,       Try, try again;     If at first you don't succeed,       Try, try again;     Then your courage should appear,     For, if you will persevere,     You will conquer, never fear;       Try, try again.    2. Once or twice though you should fail,       Try, try again;     If you would at last prevail,       Try, try again;     If we strive, 'tis no disgrace     Though we do not win the race;     What should you do in the case?       Try, try again.    3. If you find your task is hard,       Try, try again;     Time will bring you your reward,       Try, try again.     All that other folks can do,     Why, with patience, should not you?     Only keep this rule in view:       Try, try again.      DEFINITIONS.--l. Cour'age, resolution.

(29)  A FAIRY TALE.    Mary Howitt was born in 1804, at Coleford, England. She wrote many  charming stories for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14883"],[0,"Grandmother Elsie (#4)"],[1,"late  had been of a very disquieting kind; full of reproaches and vague hints of  unhappiness and disappointment in her new life.    There would probably be a few hours between their arrival in New York and  the sailing of the steamer, in which she could call to see Virginia and  learn with certainty exactly how she was situated.    Mrs. Travilla received the news of her aunt's offer with a gratitude which  it by no means merited, and the younger Elsie, though not fond of her Aunt  Louise's society, felt that her presence might prove a comfort and support  when she and Edward should find themselves strangers in a foreign land.    The mother sought this dear eldest child with loving words of cheer and  counsel whenever she could be spared from the sick-room, and Violet,  Harold, and Herbert hung about her as a treasure soon to be snatched from  them, each eager to render any assistance in his or her power.    The hour of parting came all too soon, and with many tears and embraces  the young travellers were sent on their way.    The mother's last words to Elsie, as she held her close to her heart with  many a tear and tender caress, were: \"'Be strong and of a good courage,  fear not, nor be afraid of them, for the Lord thy God, he it is that doth  go with thee, he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.' To him, the God of  your fathers, do I trust you, my precious child.\"    \"You also, my dear, dear boy!\" taking Edward's hand: \"but rejoice in the  thought that you are together, mutual helpers and comforters.\"    \"Be sure to telegraph us from New York, Edward, again as soon as possible  after landing on the other side, and a third time when you have seen  Lester and can report his exact condition,\" was Mr. Dinsmore's parting  injunction, as with a most affectionate farewell he left them in the  sleeping-car.    Mrs. Conly had joined them at the depot, according to promise.    All three retired at once to their berths, and Elsie wept herself to  sleep, thinking of the dear ones left behind; especially the mother who  had so tenderly cherished her from her birth and the sick little ones who,  she feared, might not be there to welcome her return. Thinking too of him  to whom she was going, his probable suffering, and the dread possibility  that at her journey's end she should find only his grave.    They reached New York in good season, having met with no accident or  detention. The steamer would not leave for some hours, but it was Elsie's  desire to go directly on board.    \"I think that will be your best plan,\" said Mrs. Conly. \"You can then  settle yourself in your state-room at once; and while Dinah unpacks what  you will need on the voyage, you can lie in your berth and rest. You are  looking greatly fatigued.\"    \"You will come with us, Aunt Louise, will you not?\" both the young people  asked.    \"No, I must see Virginia. I shall have time for an hour's chat with her  and yet to reach the vessel some time before the hour fixed for her  sailing. Edward, you will see that my luggage is taken on board?\"    \"Certainly, aunt; but shall we not first drive to Virginia's residence and  leave you there? And I return for you after seeing my sister and the  luggage on board the steamer?\"    \"No, not at all!\" she answered stiffly. \"I am obliged for your offer, but  where would be the use? You may tell Ben to call a hack for me. I'll have  it wait at Virginia's door and drive me to the wharf when I am ready to  go.\"    Edward, thinking he had never known her so considerate and kind, hastened  to carry out her wishes, bidding Ben engage two hacks--one for Mrs. Conly  and another for themselves.    Consideration for her nephew and niece had nothing to do with Mrs. Conly's  plans and arrangements. If, as she greatly feared, Virginia were living in  other than aristocratic style, she would not for the world have it known  among the relatives who had heard her boasts in regard to Virgie's grand  match; \"so much better than Isa had been led into while under the care of  her grandfather and uncle.\"    She had never before heard of the street mentioned in Virginia's last  letter, and her heart misgave her as to its being one of the most  fashionable for the abodes of the wealthy. The curiously scrutinizing look  and odd smile of the hack-driver when she gave him the address did not  tend to reassure her.    \"Drive me there as quickly as you can,\" she ordered, drawing herself up  and flashing an indignant glance at him. \"I have no time to waste.\"    \"Sure, mum, I'll do that same,\" he returned, touching his horses with the  whip.    \"Where are you taking me? What do you mean by bringing me into such a vile  region as this?\" she demanded presently, as the hack turned into a narrow  and very dirty street.    \"It's the shortest cut to the place ye said ye wanted to go till, mum,\" he  answered shortly.    She sank back with a sigh and closed her eyes for a moment. She was very  weary with her long journey and more depressed than she had ever been in  her life before.    The drive seemed the longest and most unpleasant she had ever undertaken;  she began to wish she had been content to sail for Europe without trying  to find Virginia. But at last the vehicle stopped, the driver reached down  from his seat and opened the door.    His passenger put out her head, glanced this way and that, scanned the  house before her, and angrily demanded, \"What are you stopping here for?\"    \"Bekase ye tould me to, mum; it's the place ye said ye wanted to come  till.\"    Mrs. Conly looked at the number over the door, saw that it was the one she  had given him, then in a voice she vainly tried to make coldly  indifferent, inquired of some children who had gathered on the sidewalk to  gaze in open-mouthed curiosity at her and the hack, if this were ----  street.    The answer confirmed the driver's assertion, and she hastily alighted.    The house was a large tenement swarming with inhabitants, as was evidenced  by the number of heads in nearly every front window, drawn thither by the  unusual event of the stopping of a hack before the door of entrance. It  stood wide open, giving a view of an unfurnished hall and stairway, both  of which were in a very untidy condition.    \"Does Mr. Henry Neuville live here?\" Mrs. Conly asked, addressing the  group of staring children.    \"Dunno,\" said one. \"Guess not,\" said another.    \"Mebbe thems the grand folks as moved intill the second story front  t'other week,\" observed a third. \"I'll show ye the way, lady,\" and he  rushed past her into the house and ran nimbly up the dirty stairs.    Mrs. Conly lifted her skirts and followed, her heart sinking like lead in  her bosom. Could it be possible that Virginia had come to this?    Halting before the door of the front room on the second floor, the lad  gave a thundering rap, then opened it, shouting, \"Here's a old lady to see  ye, Mrs. Novel; if that's yer name.\"    \"What do you mean by rushing in on me in this rude way, you young rascal?\"  demanded a shrill female voice, which Mrs. Conly instantly recognized as  that of her daughter. \"Begone instantly! begone, I say!\"    \"Go, go!\" Mrs. Conly said to the boy, in half smothered tones, putting a  small coin into his hand; then staggering into the room she dropped into a  chair, gasping for breath.    \"Virginia, Virginia! can it be possible that I find you in such a place  as this?\" she cried, as the latter started up from a lounge on which she  had been lying with a paper-covered novel in her hand.    Her hair was in crimping-pins, her dress most slatternly, and her  surroundings were in keeping with her personal appearance.    \"Mamma!\" she exclaimed in utter astonishment and confusion. \"How did you  get here? how did you come? You should have sent me word. I have no way to  accommodate you.\"    \"Don't be alarmed, I have no intention of staying more than an hour. I  start for Europe by to-day's steamer, with Elsie and Edward Travilla.  Lester Leland's ill, dying I presume, and the silly love-sick girl must  needs rush to the rescue.\"    \"And why are you to go with her? why don't the mother and grandfather and  the whole family accompany her, after their usual fashion of all keeping  together?\"    \"Because Rosie and Walter are down with the measles; much too ill to  travel.\"    \"And you are going to Europe to enjoy yourself, while I must live here in  a New York tenement house occupied by the very dregs of society, and as  the wife of a drunkard, gambler, and rake; a man--or rather a brute--who  lives by his wits, abuses me like the pickpocket that he is, half starves  me, and expects me to do all the work, cooking, cleaning, and everything  else, even to washing and ironing of the few clothes he hasn't pawned; me!  a lady brought up to have servants to wait upon her at every turn!\"    \"O Virgie, Virgie! it can't be so bad as that!\" cried her mother, clasping  her hands in an agony of distress, and gazing piteously at her, the hot  tears streaming down her face.    \"I tell you it is that and worse! and all your fault, for you made the  match! you hurried me into it lest grandpa, uncle, or brothers should  interfere, find out that the man's morals were not good according to their  high standard, and prevent me from marrying him.\"    \"You were in as great haste and as much opposed to their interference as  I, Virginia!\" the mother retorted, drawing herself up in proud anger.    \"Well, and what of that! you brought me up, and I was only following out  the teachings you have given me from my cradle. I tell you it was your  doing; but I must reap what you have sowed. I wish I was dead!\" She flung  her book from her as she spoke, turned and paced the room, her hands  clenched, her eyes flashing, her teeth set hard.    She had not drawn near her mother, or given her one word of welcome or  thanks for having turned aside from her journey to inquire into her  welfare.    \"'Oh, sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a"]]]
