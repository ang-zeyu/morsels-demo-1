Our  women too were in my eyes at least uncommonly graceful, alert, and  modest to a degree of bashfulness; nor do I remember to have ever  heard of an instance of incontinence amongst them before marriage.  They are also remarkably cheerful. Indeed cheerfulness and affability  are two of the leading characteristics of our nation.    Our tillage is exercised in a large plain or common, some hours walk  from our dwellings, and all the neighbours resort thither in a body.  They use no beasts of husbandry; and their only instruments are hoes,  axes, shovels, and beaks, or pointed iron to dig with. Sometimes we  are visited by locusts, which come in large clouds, so as to darken  the air, and destroy our harvest. This however happens rarely, but  when it does, a famine is produced by it. I remember an instance or  two wherein this happened. This common is often the theatre of war;  and therefore when our people go out to till their land, they not only  go in a body, but generally take their arms with them for fear of a  surprise; and when they apprehend an invasion they guard the avenues  to their dwellings, by driving sticks into the ground, which are so  sharp at one end as to pierce the foot, and are generally dipt in  poison. From what I can recollect of these battles, they appear to  have been irruptions of one little state or district on the other, to  obtain prisoners or booty. Perhaps they were incited to this by those  traders who brought the European goods I mentioned amongst us. Such a  mode of obtaining slaves in Africa is common; and I believe more are  procured this way, and by kidnapping, than any other[E]. When a trader  wants slaves, he applies to a chief for them, and tempts him with his  wares. It is not extraordinary, if on this occasion he yields to the  temptation with as little firmness, and accepts the price of his  fellow creatures liberty with as little reluctance as the enlightened  merchant. Accordingly he falls on his neighbours, and a desperate  battle ensues. If he prevails and takes prisoners, he gratifies his  avarice by selling them; but, if his party be vanquished, and he falls  into the hands of the enemy, he is put to death: for, as he has been  known to foment their quarrels, it is thought dangerous to let him  survive, and no ransom can save him, though all other prisoners may be  redeemed. We have fire-arms, bows and arrows, broad two-edged swords  and javelins: we have shields also which cover a man from head to  foot. All are taught the use of these weapons; even our women are  warriors, and march boldly out to fight along with the men. Our whole  district is a kind of militia: on a certain signal given, such as the  firing of a gun at night, they all rise in arms and rush upon their  enemy. It is perhaps something remarkable, that when our people march  to the field a red flag or banner is borne before them. I was once a  witness to a battle in our common. We had been all at work in it one  day as usual, when our people were suddenly attacked. I climbed a tree  at some distance, from which I beheld the fight. There were many women  as well as men on both sides; among others my mother was there, and  armed with a broad sword. After fighting for a considerable time with  great fury, and after many had been killed our people obtained the  victory, and took their enemy's Chief prisoner. He was carried off in  great triumph, and, though he offered a large ransom for his life, he  was put to death. A virgin of note among our enemies had been slain in  the battle, and her arm was exposed in our market-place, where our  trophies were always exhibited. The spoils were divided according to  the merit of the warriors. Those prisoners which were not sold or  redeemed we kept as slaves: but how different was their condition from  that of the slaves in the West Indies! With us they do no more work  than other members of the community, even their masters; their food,  clothing and lodging were nearly the same as theirs, (except that they  were not permitted to eat with those who were free-born); and there  was scarce any other difference between them, than a superior degree  of importance which the head of a family possesses in our state, and  that authority which, as such, he exercises over every part of his  household. Some of these slaves have even slaves under them as their  own property, and for their own use.    As to religion, the natives believe that there is one Creator of all  things, and that he lives in the sun, and is girted round with a belt  that he may never eat or drink; but, according to some, he smokes a  pipe, which is our own favourite luxury. They believe he governs  events, especially our deaths or captivity; but, as for the doctrine  of eternity, I do not remember to have ever heard of it: some however  believe in the transmigration of souls in a certain degree. Those  spirits, which are not transmigrated, such as our dear friends or  relations, they believe always attend them, and guard them from the  bad spirits or their foes. For this reason they always before eating,  as I have observed, put some small portion of the meat, and pour some  of their drink, on the ground for them; and they often make oblations  of the blood of beasts or fowls at their graves. I was very fond of my  mother, and almost constantly with her. When she went to make these  oblations at her mother's tomb, which was a kind of small solitary  thatched house, I sometimes attended her. There she made her  libations, and spent most of the night in cries and lamentations. I  have been often extremely terrified on these occasions. The loneliness  of the place, the darkness of the night, and the ceremony of libation,  naturally awful and gloomy, were heightened by my mother's  lamentations; and these, concuring with the cries of doleful birds, by  which these places were frequented, gave an inexpressible terror to  the scene.    We compute the year from the day on which the sun crosses the line,  and on its setting that evening there is a general shout throughout  the land; at least I can speak from my own knowledge throughout our  vicinity. The people at the same time make a great noise with rattles,  not unlike the basket rattles used by children here, though much  larger, and hold up their hands to heaven for a blessing. It is then  the greatest offerings are made; and those children whom our wise men  foretel will be fortunate are then presented to different people. I  remember many used to come to see me, and I was carried about to  others for that purpose. They have many offerings, particularly at  full moons; generally two at harvest before the fruits are taken out  of the ground: and when any young animals are killed, sometimes they  offer up part of them as a sacrifice. These offerings, when made by  one of the heads of a family, serve for the whole. I remember we often  had them at my father's and my uncle's, and their families have been  present. Some of our offerings are eaten with bitter herbs. We had a  saying among us to any one of a cross temper, 'That if they were to be  eaten, they should be eaten with bitter herbs.'    We practised circumcision like the Jews, and made offerings and feasts  on that occasion in the same manner as they did. Like them also, our  children were named from some event, some circumstance, or fancied  foreboding at the time of their birth. I was named _Olaudah_, which,  in our language, signifies vicissitude or fortune also, one favoured,  and having a loud voice and well spoken. I remember we never polluted  the name of the object of our adoration; on the contrary, it was  always mentioned with the greatest reverence; and we were totally  unacquainted with swearing, and all those terms of abuse and reproach  which find their way so readily and copiously into the languages of  more civilized people. The only expressions of that kind I remember  were 'May you rot, or may you swell, or may a beast take you.'    I have before remarked that the natives of this part of Africa are  extremely cleanly. This necessary habit of decency was with us a part  of religion, and therefore we had many purifications and washings;  indeed almost as many, and used on the same occasions, if my  recollection does not fail me, as the Jews. Those that touched the  dead at any time were obliged to wash and purify themselves before  they could enter a dwelling-house. Every woman too, at certain times,  was forbidden to come into a dwelling-house, or touch any person, or  any thing we ate. I was so fond of my mother I could not keep from  her, or avoid touching her at some of those periods, in consequence of  which I was obliged to be kept out with her, in a little house made  for that purpose, till offering was made, and then we were purified.    Though we had no places of public worship, we had priests and  magicians, or wise men. I do not remember whether they had different  offices, or whether they were united in the same persons, but they  were held in great reverence by the people. They calculated our time,  and foretold events, as their name imported, for we called them  Ah-affoe-way-cah, which signifies calculators or yearly men, our year  being called Ah-affoe. They wore their beards, and when they died they  were succeeded by their sons. Most of their implements and things of  value were interred along with them. Pipes and tobacco were also put  into the grave with the corpse, which was always perfumed and  ornamented, and animals were offered in sacrifice to them. None  accompanied their funerals but those of the same profession or tribe.  These buried them after sunset, and always returned from the grave by  a different way from that which they went.    These magicians were also our doctors or physicians. They practised  bleeding by cupping; and were very successful in healing wounds and  expelling"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15435"],[0,"Object Lessons on the Human Body (#4)"],[1,"are always wearing out, and the blood is always repairing  and building them again.           *       *       *       *       *    QUESTIONS FOR THE FORMULA.    1.

While admiring the beautiful styles and bright colors of the  garments, she pointed to the waist of one, and exclaimed, \"_That means  trouble_.\" The waist was too small for a grown person, and could only have  been made so by _tight-lacing_. The child had been taught that dresses,  corsets, coats, vests, bands, or anything fastened tightly around the  waist, press upon the ribs and crowd them out of place, preventing the  heart, lungs, and other inside organs from working as they should, causing  headache, dyspepsia, shortness of breath, and often ending in some  incurable disease, so she knew that _tight clothing means trouble_ to the  wearer.

FORMULA FOR THE LESSON ON THE MUSCLES.    1. Muscles are the red, elastic bands and bundles of thread like substance,  called flesh, which cover the bones and make the eyeballs, the eyelids, the  tongue, the heart, the lungs, and various other parts of the body.    2. There are about four hundred and fifty muscles in my body.    3. The work of the muscles is to support and move my bones, and different  parts of the body.    4. The muscles may be named the muscles of my head, the muscles of my  trunk, the muscles of my limbs.    5. The muscles of my head cover and move the parts of my head and face. The  muscles of my trunk cover and move the parts of my neck and trunk. The  muscles of my limbs cover and mote the parts of my arms and legs.    6. Those muscles are the weakest which I use least; those muscles are the  strongest which I exercise most in work or play.    7. If I would be strong and healthy,      my muscles must be used,      my muscles must be rested,      my muscles must be supplied with good blood.    I must exercise in work and play to make them strong; I must sleep, or  change my kind of work or play, to give them rest, when they are tired; I  must breathe pure air, take wholesome food and drink, and live in the  sunlight, to supply them with good blood; I must not weaken them by using  alcohol or tobacco.           *       *       *       *       *    QUESTIONS FOR THE FORMULA.    1. Tell about the muscles.    2. How many muscles have you in your body?    3. Of what use are the muscles?    4. How may the muscles be named?    5. Tell about the muscles of the head, trunk, and limbs.    6. Which muscles are the weakest, and which are the strongest?    7. What is necessary if you would have strong and healthy muscles?           *       *       *       *       *    CLASSES AND WORK OF THE MUSCLES.    The muscles are divided into two great classes: those which we may move as  we choose, called _voluntary_ muscles, and those over which we have no  power, called _involuntary_ muscles.    Some muscles support and move the various parts of the body, others have  different work to do. The heart, the great involuntary muscle, acts like an  engine to drive the blood throughout the body; the lungs draw in and throw  out the air in breathing; the stomach helps to churn and change food into  blood; the tongue is used in speaking and eating.           *       *       *       *       *    QUESTIONS ON THE MUSCLES.    What are the muscles?--\"The lean flesh of the body; bands and bundles of  fleshy threads which cover the body.\"    Of what use are the muscles to the body?--\"They cover the bones; they  support and move the bones and different parts of the body.\"    Name some parts of the body which are made of muscles.--\"The eyeballs, the  eyelids, the tongue, the heart, the lungs.\"    What color are the muscles?--\"Red.\"    How do the muscles move the bones?--\"By shortening or lengthening  themselves according to the way the bones are to be moved.\"    Tell how the muscles move your arm at the elbow.--\"The muscles in the front  part of the arm shorten themselves, to draw my fore-arm toward the  shoulder; when I wish to stretch out the fore-arm these muscles lengthen,  while another set of muscles shorten, to draw the fore-arm away from the  upper arm.\"    What do you say about the muscles because they have the power to shorten  and lengthen themselves?--\"They are elastic.\"    About how many muscles are there in your whole body?--\"About four hundred  and fifty.\"    How may these be divided as you study about them?--\"They may be divided  into the muscles of my head, the muscles of my trunk, and the muscles of my  limbs.\"    Of what use are the muscles of your head?--\"They cover and move the parts  of my head and face.\"    Of what use are the muscles of your trunk?--\"They move the parts of my neck  and trunk.\"    Of what use are the muscles of your limbs?--\"They move the parts of my arms  and legs.\"    How can you make your muscles strong?--\"By using them.\"    How can you make your muscles weak?--\"By not using them.\"    What is necessary to make your muscles strong and healthy?--\"They must be  used; they must be rested when tired; they must be supplied with pure  blood.\"    How should the muscles be used?--\"They should be exercised in work or  play.\"    How may they be rested?--\"I may rest my muscles by changing position; by  changing my kind"]]]
