I'll turn him over to you.      PITICHINACCIO (entering the gondola)      Dear angel.    (Giulietta takes him in her arms.)      HOFFMAN (comprehending the infamy of Giulietta).      Vile wretch!      NICKLAUSSE.      Hoffman! Hoffman--the police!    (Nicklausse drags Hoffmann away. Giulietta and Pitichinaccia laugh.)          ACT IV.      (At Munich at CRESPEL'S. A room furnished in a bizarre fashion.)      ANTONIA (alone. She is seated at the clavichord).    She has fled, the dove  She has fled far from thee!    (She stops and rises.)    Ah memory too sweet, image too cruel!  Alas at my knees I hear, I see him!  She has fled, the dove.  She has fled far from thee;  She is faithful ever,  And she keeps her troth.  Beloved, my voice calls thee,  All my heart is thine.    (She approaches the clavichord again.)    Dear flower but now open,  In pity answer me,  Thou that knowest if still he loves me,  If he keeps his troth.  Beloved my voice implores thee.  May thy heart come to me.    (She falls in a chair.)      CRESPEL (entering suddenly).    Unhappy child, beloved daughter,  You promised to no longer sing.      ANTONIA.    My mother in me lived again;  My heart while singing thought it heard her.      CRESPEL.    There is my torment. Thy loved mother  Left thee her voice. Vain regrets!  Through thee I hear her. No, no, I beg...      ANTONIA (sadly).      Your Antonia will sing no more!    (She goes out slowly.)      CRESPEL (alone).    Despair! A little while again  I saw those spots of fire  Mark her face. God!  Must I lose her I adore?  Ah, that Hoffman... 'tis he  Who put in her heart this craze. I fled  Far as Munich...    (Enter Frantz.)      CRESPEL.      You, Frantz, open to nobody.      FRANTZ (false exit).      You think so...      CRESPEL.      Where are you going?      FRANTZ.    I'm going to see if anybody rang.  As you said...      CRESPEL.    I said, Open to nobody.  (Shouting) To nobody! This time do you hear?      FRANTZ.      Good Heavens! we're not all of us deaf?      CRESPEL.      All right! The devil take you!      FRANTZ.      Yes, sir, the key is in the door.      CRESPEL.      Idiot! donkey!      FRANTZ.      Its agreed then.      CRESPEL.      Morbleu!    (He exits quickly.)      FRANTZ (alone).    Well! What! angry always!  Strange, peevish, exacting!  One would think that one pleased him  For his money...  Day and night I'm on all fours,  At the least sign I'm silent;  It is just as if I sang!  But no, if I sang,  His contempt he'd have to modify.  I sing alone sometimes,  But singing isn't easy!  Tra la, la, tra, la la!  Still it isn't voice that I lack, I think,  Tra la la, tra la la,  No, 'tis the method.  Of course one can't have everything.  I sing pretty badly,  But dance agreeably,  And I do not flatter myself;  Dancing shows off my advantages.  'Tis my one great attraction,  But dancing isn't easy.  Tra la la, tra la la.    (He dances and stops.)    With women the shape of my leg  Would do me no harm,  Tra la la, tra la la!    (He falls.)    No, 'tis the method.    (Hoffman enters followed by Nicklausse.)      HOFFMAN.    Frantz! This is it. (touches Frantz on shoulder.)    Up, my friend.      FRANTZ.    Hey, who's there? (rises, surprised.)    Monsieur Hoffman!      HOFFMAN.      Myself. Well, Antonia?      FRANTZ.      He's gone out, sir.      HOFFMAN (laughing).    Ha, ha, deafer yet  Than last year...      FRANTZ.    Monsieur honors me,  I am very well, thanks to heaven.      HOFFMAN.      Antonia! I must see her.      FRANTZ.    Very well! what a joy  For monsieur Crespel! (He goes out.)      HOFFMAN (sitting before the clavichord).      'Tis a song of love    That flies away,    Sad or gay;    It takes its turn...      ANTONIA (entering suddenly).      Hoffman!...      HOFFMAN (receiving her in his arms).      Antonia!      NICKLAUSSE (aside).      I am one too many, good night.    (He exits.)      ANTONIA.      Ah, I well knew that you loved me still.      HOFFMAN.    My heart told me that I was regretted,  But why were we separated?      ANTONIA.      I do not know.    (Ensemble.)      HOFFMAN.    I have happiness in my heart;  To-morrow you'll be my wife      Happy couple.  The future shall be ours!  To love let's be faithful,  That her eternal chains,      Keep our hearts  Conquerors even against time!      ANTONIA.    I have joy in my heart!  To-morrow I'll be your wife,      Happy couple,  The future is ours!  Each day new songs,  Your genius opens its wings,  My conquering song  Is the echo of your heart.      HOFFMAN (smiling).    Still, oh my affianced,  Shall I speak my thought?  That, spite of myself, troubles me,  Music inspires a little jealousy,  You love it too much!      ANTONIA (smiling).    See the strange fantasy!  Did I love you for it, or it for you?  For you are not going to forbid me  To sing, as did my father.      HOFFMAN.      What say you?      ANTONIA.    Yes, my father at present imposes the virtue  Of silence.      HOFFMAN (aside).      'Tis strange... can it be?...      ANTONIA (drawing him to the clavichord).    Come here as before;  Listen, and you'll see if I've lost my voice.      HOFFMAN.      How your eye lights up, your hand trembles.      ANTONIA (making him sit down).      Here, the soft song of love we sang together.    (She sings.)      'Tis a song of love    That flies off    Sad or joyful,    Turn by turn,    'Tis a song of love,    The new rose    Smiles on the Spring.    Ah! how long will it be    That it lives?      TOGETHER.      'Tis a song of love    That flies off, etc., etc.      HOFFMAN.      A ray of flame    Matches thy beauty.    Will you see the summer?    Flower of the soul.      TOGETHER.      'Tis a song of love, etc., etc.    (Antonia puts her hand to her heart.)      HOFFMAN.      Why, what is the matter?      ANTONIA (doing same again).      Nothing.      HOFFMAN (listening).      Chut.      ANTONIA.      Heavens, my father! Come, come...    (She goes out.)      HOFFMAN.      No! I must know the last word of this mystery.    (He hides. Crespel appears.)      CRESPEL (looking about him).    No, nothing. I thought Hoffman was here.  May he go to the devil!      HOFFMAN (aside).      Many thanks!      FRANTZ (entering).      Sir.      CRESPEL.      What?      FRANTZ.      Doctor Miracle.      CRESPEL.    Infamous scoundrel,  Quickly close the door.      FRANTZ.      Yes, sir, the doctor...      CRESPEL.    He, doctor? No, on my soul,  A grave digger, an assassin!  Who would kill my daughter after my wife.  I hear the jingle of his golden vials,  From me let him be chased.    (Miracle suddenly appears. Frantz runs away.)      MIRACLE.      Ha, ha, ha, ha!      CRESPEL.    Well, here I am! 'tis me.  This good monsieur Crespel, I like him,  But where is he?      CRESPEL (stopping him).      Morbleu!      MIRACLE.    Ha, ha, ha, ha!  I sought for your Antonia.  Well, this trouble she inherited  From her mother? Still progressing, dear girl.  We'll cure her. Take me to her.      CRESPEL.    To assassinate her... If you make one step  I'll throw you out of the window.      MIRACLE.    There now softly, I do not wish to  Displease you.    (He advances a chair.)      CRESPEL.      What do you, traitor?      MIRACLE.    To minimize the danger,  One must know it.  Let me question her.      CRESPEL AND HOFFMAN.      Terror penetrates me.    (Ensemble.)    (Miracle, his hand extended toward Antonia's room.)    To my conquering power,  Give way with good grace.  Near me without terror  Come take your place.      CRESPEL AND HOFFMAN.    With fright and with horror  All my being is cold;  A strange terror  Chains me to this place.      I'm afraid.      CRESPEL (seating himself).      Come, speak and be brief.    (Miracle continues his magnetic passes. The door of Antonia's room opens    slowly. Miracle indicates that he takes Antonia's hand and leads her    to a chair.)      MIRACLE.      Please sit there.      CRESPEL.      I am seated.      MIRACLE (paying no attention).      How old are you, please?      CRESPEL.      Who, me?      MIRACLE.      I am speaking to your child.      HOFFMAN (aside).      Antonia.      MIRACLE.      What age (he listens). Twenty!      CRESPEL.      What?      MIRACLE.      The Spring of life.    (He appears to feel the pulse.)      Let me see your hand!...      CRESPEL.      The hand.      MIRACLE (pulling out his watch).      Chut! let me count.      HOFFMAN (aside).      God! am I the plaything of a dream? Is it a ghost?      MIRACLE.      The pulse is unequal and fast, bad symptom. Sing.      CRESPEL (rising).      No, no, don't speak... don't have her sing.    (The voice of Antonia is heard.)      MIRACLE.    See her face brightens, her eyes are on fire;  She carries her hand to her beating heart.    (He follows Antonia with his gestures. The door of her room closes    quickly.)      CRESPEL.      What is he saying?      MIRACLE (rising).    It would be a pity truly  To leave to death so fine a prey!      CRESPEL.      Shut up!      MIRACLE.    If you will accept my help,  If you would save her days,  I have there certain vials I keep in reserve.    (He takes vials from pocket which he makes sound like castanets.)      CRESPEL.      Shut up!      MIRACLE.      Of which you should.      CRESPEL.    Shut up! Heaven preserve me  From listening to your advice, miserable assassin.      MIRACLE.      Of which you should, each morning...    (Ensemble.)      MIRACLE.    Why, yes, I hear you.  A while ago, an instant  These vials, poor father,  You will be then, I hope,      Satisfied.      CRESPEL.    Be off, be off, be off!  Out of this house, Satan,  Beware of the anger  And the sorrow of a father.      Be off!      HOFFMAN (aside).    From the death that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15921"],[0,"The Haskalah Movement in Russia (#4)"],[1,"than Isaac Aboab and Saul Morteira welcomed the  merchant-Talmudist Moses Rivkes of Vilna when he sought refuge in  Amsterdam, and they entrusted to him the task of editing the _Shulhan  'Aruk_, his marginal notes to which, the _Beer ha-Golah_, have ever  since been printed with the text. In addition to rabbis, Lithuania and  other provinces furnished teachers for the young, melammedim, who  exerted considerable influence upon the people among whom they lived.  Their opinions, we are told, were highly valued in the choice of  rabbis.[25]    It must not be supposed that supremacy in the Talmud was secured at the  cost of secular knowledge, or what was then regarded as such. Their  familiarity with other branches of study was not inferior to that of the  Jews in better-known lands. Not a few of the prominent men united piety  with philosophy, and thorough knowledge of the Talmud with mastery of  one or more of the sciences of the time. Data on this phase of the  subject might have been much more abundant, had not the storm of  persecution suddenly swept over the communities, destroying them and  their records. What we still possess indicates what may have been lost.  The Ukraine was famous for its scholars. Among them was Jehiel Michael  of Nemirov, reputed to have been \"versed in all the sciences of the  world.\"[26] Several of them were poets and grammarians. Poems of a  liturgical character are still extant in which they bemoan their plight  or assert their faith hopefully. Such were the poems of Ephraim of  Khelm, Joseph of Kobrin, Solomon of Zamoscz, and Shabbatai Kohen. The  last, eminent as a Talmudist, the author of commentaries on the _Shulhan  'Aruk_ approved by the leading rabbis of his generation, is also known  as a very trustworthy historian. His _Megillah 'Afah_, written in  classic Hebrew, is a valuable source of information on the critical  period in which he lived. He won the esteem of the Polish nobility by  his secular attainments. To judge from his correspondence, he must have  been on intimate terms with Vidrich of Leipsic.[27] Of the grammarians,  Jacob Zaslaver wrote on the Massorah, and Shabbatai Sofer was the author  of annotations and treatises.[28] Our taste in poetry and grammar is no  longer the same, but the polemic and apologetic writings of those days,  called forth by the discussions between Rabbanites and Karaites and by  the constant attacks of Christianity, are still of uncommon interest.  Specimens of the former kind are the polemics of Moses of Shavli, which  caused consternation in the camp of the Karaites. Of the apologetic  writings should be mentioned the reply, in Polish, of Jacob Nahman of  Belzyc to Martin Chekhovic (Lublin, 1581), and the _Hizzuk Emunah_ of  the Karaite Isaac ben Abraham of Troki. In the latter the weakness of  Christianity and the strength of Judaism are pointed out with trenchancy  never before reached. The work stirred up heated discussions among the  various Christian sects, with the tenets of which the author was  intimately acquainted. It was translated into Latin (1681, 1705),  Yiddish (1717), English (1851), and German (1865, 1873). Voltaire says  that all the arguments used by free-thinkers against Christianity were  drawn from it.[29]    In philosophy, mathematics, and medicine, the three main branches of  medieval knowledge, many Slavonian Jews attained eminence. Devout  Karaites as well as diligent Talmudists found secular learning a  diversion and a delight. For the lovers of enlightenment Italy,  especially Padua, was the centre of attraction, as France and Spain had  been before, and Germany, particularly Berlin, became afterwards.[30]  Towards the middle of the sixteenth century we find young Delacrut at  the University of Bologna, the philosopher and Cabbalist, known for his  commentaries to Gikatilla's _Sha'are Orah_ (Cracow, 1600) and Ben  Avigdor's _Mar'eh ha-Ofanim_ (1720), and his translation of Gossuin's  _L'image du monde_ (Amsterdam, 1733). His famous disciple Mordecai Jaffe  (Lebushim) spent ten years in the study of astronomy and mathematics  before he occupied the rabbinate of Grodno (1572)[31] At the request of  Yom-Tob Lipman Heller, Joseph ben Isaac Levi wrote a commentary on  Maimuni's _Moreh Nebukim_, which was published with the former's  annotations, _Gibe'at ha-Moreh_ (Prague, 1611). Deservedly or not,  Eliezer Mann was called \"the Hebrew Socrates\"; and many a Maskil in his  study of mathematics turned for guidance to Manoah Handel of  Brzeszticzka, Volhynia, author and translator of several scientific  works, who rendered seven Euclidean propositions into Hebrew.[32]    Polyglots they were compelled to be by force of circumstances. When the  exotic Judeo-German finally asserted itself as the vernacular, the  language in which they wrote and prayed was still the ancient Hebrew,  with which every one was familiar, and commercial intercourse with their  Gentile neighbors was hardly feasible without at least a smattering of  the local Slavonic dialect. \"Look at our brethren in Poland,\" exclaims  Wessely many years later in his address to his countrymen. \"They  converse with their neighbors in good Polish.... What excuse have we for  our brogue and jargon?\" He might have had still better cause for  complaint, had he been aware that the Yiddish of the Russo-Polish Jews,  despite its considerable Slavonic admixture, was purer German than that  of his contemporaries in Germany, even as the English of our New England  colonies was superior to the Grub Street style prevalent in Dr.  Johnson's England, and the Spanish of our Mexican annexations to the  Castilian spoken at the time of Coronado. But we are here concerned with  their knowledge of foreign languages. We shall refer only to the  Hebrew-German-Italian-Latin-French dictionary _Safah Berurah_ (Prague,  1660; Amsterdam, 1701) by the eminent Talmudist Nathan Hannover.[33]    In medicine Jews were pre-eminent in the Slavonic countries, as they  were everywhere else. They were in great demand as court physicians,  though several had to pay with their lives \"for having failed to effect  cures.\" Doctor Leo, who was at the court of Moscow in 1490, was  mentioned above. Jacob Isaac, the \"nobleman of Jerusalem\" (Yerosalimska  shlyakhta), was attached to the court of Sigismund, where he was held in  high esteem. Prince Radziwill's physician was Itshe Nisanovich, and  among those in attendance on John Sobieski were Jonas Casal and Abraham  Troki, the latter the author of several works on medicine and natural  philosophy.[34]    Medieval Jewish physicians were prone to travel, and those of  Russo-Poland were no exception. We find them in almost every part of the  civilized world, and their number increases with the disappearance of  prejudice. Some were noted Talmudists, such as Solomon Luria and Samuel  ben Mattathias. Abraham Ashkenazi Apotheker was not only a compounder of  herbs but a healer of souls, for the edification of which he wrote his  _Elixir of Life_ (_Sam Hayyim_, Prague, 1590). To the same class belong  Moses Katzenellenbogen and his son Hayyim, who was styled Gaon. In 1657  Hayyim visited Italy. He was welcomed by the prominent Jews of Mantua,  Modena, Venice, and Verona, but he preferred to continue the practice of  his profession in his home town Lublin.[35] Nor may we omit the names of  Stephen von Gaden and Moses Coen, because of their high standing among  their colleagues and the honors conferred upon them for their  statesmanship. Stephen von Gaden, who with Samuel Collins was  physician-in-ordinary to Czar Aleksey Mikhailovich, was instrumental in  removing many disabilities from the Jews of Moscow and in the interior  of Russia. Moses Coen, in consequence of the Cossack uprising, escaped  to Moldavia, and was made court physician by the hospodar Vassile Lupu.  But for Coen, Lupu would have been dethroned by those who conspired  against him. To his loyalty may probably be attributed the kind  treatment Moldavian Jews later enjoyed at the hands of the prince. Coen  also exposed the secret alliance between Russia and Sweden against  Turkey, and his advice was sought by the doge of Venice.[36]    The personage who typifies best the enlightened Slavonic Jew of the  pre-Haskalah period is Tobias Cohn (1652-1729). He was the son and  grandson of physicians, who practiced at Kamenetz-Podolsk and Byelsk,  and after 1648 went to Metz. After their father's death, he and his  older brother returned to Poland, whence Tobias, in turn, emigrated  first to Italy and then to Turkey. In Adrianople he was  physician-in-ordinary to five successive sultans. In the history of  medicine he is remembered as the discoverer of the _plica polonica_, and  as the publisher of a Materia Medica in three languages. To the student  of Haskalah he is interesting, because he marks the close of the old and  the beginning of the new era. Like the Maskilim of a century or two  centuries later, he compiled and edited an encyclopedia in Hebrew, that  \"knowledge be increased among his coreligionists.\" His acquaintance with  learned works in several ancient and modern languages of which he was  master, enabled him to write his magnum opus, _Ma'aseh Tobiah_, with  tolerable ease. This work is divided into eight parts, devoted  respectively to theology, astronomy, pharmacy, hygiene, venereal  diseases, botany, cosmography, and chemistry. It is illustrated with  several plates, among them the picture of an astrolabe and one of the  human body treated as a house. From the numerous editions through which  it passed (Venice, 1707, 1715, 1728, 1769), we may conclude that it met  with marked success.[37]           *       *       *       *       *    To understand the _raison d'Etre_ of the Haskalah movement, it may not  be superfluous to cast a glance at the inner social and religious life  of the Slavonic Jews during pre-Haskalah times.
