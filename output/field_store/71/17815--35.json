Surely the appeal of chattels who render service of such great value  deserves the attention of the British people.    Finally, I would say as Professor Du Bois says in his book  `The Souls of Black Folk', on the relations between  the sons of master and man, \"I have not glossed over matters  for policy's sake, for I fear we have already gone too far  in that sort of thing.  On the other hand I have sincerely sought  to let no unfair exaggerations creep in.  I do not doubt  that in some communities conditions are better than those I have indicated;  while I am no less certain that in other communities they are far worse.\"          Chapter I       A Retrospect      I am Black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar,      as the curtains of Solomon.    Look not upon me because I am black, because the sun hath looked upon me:      my mother's children were angry with me; they made me      the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept.                                         The Song of Songs.        Awaking on Friday morning, June 20, 1913, the South African Native  found himself, not actually a slave, but a pariah in the land of his birth.    The 4,500,000 black South Africans are domiciled as follows:  One and three-quarter millions in Locations and Reserves,  over half a million within municipalities or in urban areas,  and nearly a million as squatters on farms owned by Europeans.  The remainder are employed either on the public roads or railway lines,  or as servants by European farmers, qualifying, that is,  by hard work and saving to start farming on their own account.    A squatter in South Africa is a native who owns some livestock and,  having no land of his own, hires a farm or grazing and ploughing rights  from a landowner, to raise grain for his own use and feed his stock.  Hence, these squatters are hit very hard by an Act which  passed both Houses of Parliament during the session of 1913,  received the signature of the Governor-General on June 16,  was gazetted on June 19, and forthwith came into operation.  It may be here mentioned that on that day Lord Gladstone signed no fewer  than sixteen new Acts of Parliament -- some of them being rather voluminous --  while three days earlier, His Excellency signed another batch of eight,  of which the bulk was beyond the capability of any mortal to read and digest  in four days.    But the great revolutionary change thus wrought by a single stroke of the pen,  in the condition of the Native, was not realized by him  until about the end of June.  As a rule many farm tenancies expire  at the end of the half-year, so that in June, 1913, not knowing  that it was impracticable to make fresh contracts, some Natives  unwittingly went to search for new places of abode, which some farmers,  ignorant of the law, quite as unwittingly accorded them.  It was only when they went to register the new tenancies  that the law officers of the Crown laid bare the cruel fact  that to provide a landless Native with accommodation was forbidden  under a penalty of 100 Pounds, or six months' imprisonment.  Then only was the situation realized.    Other Natives who had taken up fresh places on European farms  under verbal contracts, which needed no registration, actually founded  new homes in spite of the law, neither the white farmer nor the native tenant  being aware of the serious penalties they were exposed to  by their verbal contracts.    In justice to the Government, it must be stated that no police officers  scoured the country in search of lawbreakers, to prosecute them  under this law.  Had this been done, many 100 Pound cheques  would have passed into the Government coffers during that black July,  the first month after Lord Gladstone affixed his signature  to the Natives' Land Act, No. 27 of 1913.    The complication of this cruel law is made manifest by the fact  that it was found necessary for a high officer of the Government  to tour the Provinces soon after the Act came into force,  with the object of \"teaching\" Magistrates how to administer it.  A Congress of Magistrates -- a most unusual thing -- was also called  in Pretoria to find a way for carrying out the King's writ  in the face of the difficulties arising from this tangle of the Act.  We may add that nearly all white lawyers in South Africa,  to whom we spoke about this measure, had either not seen the Act at all,  or had not read it carefully, so that in both cases they could not tell  exactly for whose benefit it had been passed.  The study of this law  required a much longer time than the lawyers, unless specially briefed,  could devote to it, so that they hardly knew what all the trouble was about.  It was the Native in the four Provinces who knew all about it,  for he had not read it in books but had himself been through its mill,  which like an automatic machine ground him relentlessly  since the end of the month of June.  Not the least but one of  the cruellest and most ironical phases -- and nearly every clause of this Act  teems with irony -- is the Schedule or appendix giving the so-called  Scheduled Native Areas; and what are these \"Scheduled Native Areas\"?    They are the Native Locations which were reserved for the exclusive use  of certain native clans.  They are inalienable and cannot be bought or sold,  yet the Act says that in these \"Scheduled Native Areas\" Natives only  may buy land.  The areas being inalienable, not even members of the clans,  for whose benefit the locations are held in trust, can buy land therein.  The areas could only be sold if the whole clan rebelled; in that case  the location would be confiscated.  But as long as the clans of the location  remain loyal to the Government, nobody can buy any land within these areas.  Under the respective charters of these areas, not even a member of the clan  can get a separate title as owner in an area -- let alone a native outsider  who had grown up among white people and done all his farming  on white man's land.    If we exclude the arid tracts of Bechuanaland, these Locations  appear to have been granted on such a small scale that each of them  got so overcrowded that much of the population had to go out and settle  on the farms of white farmers through lack of space in the Locations.  Yet a majority of the legislators, although well aware of all  these limitations, and without remedying any of them, legislate,  shall we say, \"with its tongue in its cheek\" that only Natives may buy land  in Native Locations.    Again, the Locations form but one-eighteenth of the total area of the Union.  Theoretically, then, the 4,500,000 Natives may \"buy\" land in only  one-eighteenth part of the Union, leaving the remaining seventeen parts  for the one million whites.  It is moreover true that, numerically,  the Act was passed by the consent of a majority of both Houses of Parliament,  but it is equally true that it was steam-rolled into the statute book  against the bitterest opposition of the best brains of both Houses.  A most curious aspect of this singular law is that even the Minister,  since deceased, who introduced it, subsequently declared himself against it,  adding that he only forced it through in order to stave off something worse.  Indeed, it is correct to say that Mr. Sauer, who introduced the Bill,  spoke against it repeatedly in the House; he deleted the milder provisions,  inserted more drastic amendments, spoke repeatedly against  his own amendments, then in conclusion he would combat  his own arguments by calling the ministerial steam-roller  to support the Government and vote for the drastic amendments.  The only explanation of the puzzle constituted as such by these  \"hot-and-cold\" methods is that Mr. Sauer was legislating for an electorate,  at the expense of another section of the population which was without  direct representation in Parliament.  None of the non-European races  in the Provinces of Natal, Transvaal and the \"Free\" State  can exercise the franchise.  They have no say in the selection of members  for the Union Parliament.  That right is only limited to white men,  so that a large number of the members of Parliament who voted for this measure  have no responsibility towards the black races.    Before reproducing this tyrannical enactment it would perhaps be well  to recapitulate briefly the influences that led up to it.  When the Union of the South African Colonies became  an accomplished fact, a dread was expressed by ex-Republicans  that the liberal native policy of the Cape would supersede  the repressive policy of the old Republics, and they lost no time  in taking definite steps to force down the throats of the Union Legislature,  as it were, laws which the Dutch Presidents of pre-war days,  with the British suzerainty over their heads, did not dare enforce  against the Native people then under them.

Then shall thou be happy and make many others happy.\"          FOURTH MEMORY.    Every life has its years in which one progresses as on a tedious and  dusty street of poplars, without caring to know where he is.  Of these  years nought remains in memory but the sad feeling that we have  advanced and only grown older.  While the river of life glides along  smoothly, it remains the same river; only the landscape on either bank  seems to change.  But then come the cataracts of life.  They are firmly  fixed in memory, and even when we are past them and far away, and draw  nearer and nearer to the silent sea of eternity, even then it seems as  if we heard from afar their rush and roar.  We feel that the life-force  which yet remains and impels us onward still has its source and supply  from those cataracts.    School time was ended, the first fleeting years of university life were  over, and many beautiful life-dreams were over also.  But one of them  still remained: Faith in God and man.  Otherwise life would have been  circumscribed within one's narrow brain.  Instead of that, a nobler  consecration had preserved all, and even the painful and  incomprehensible events of life became a proof to me of the  omnipresence of the divine in the earthly.  \"The least important thing  does not happen except as God wills it.\"  This was the brief  life-wisdom I had accumulated.    During the summer holidays I returned to my little native city.  What  joy in these meetings again!  No one has explained it, but in this  seeing and finding again, and in these self-memories, lie the real  secrets of all joy and pleasure.  What we see, hear or taste for the  first time may be beautiful, grand and agreeable, but it is too new.  It overpowers, but gives no repose, and the fatigue of enjoying is  greater than the enjoyment itself.  To hear again, years afterward, an  old melody, every note of which we supposed we had forgotten, and yet  to recognize it as an old acquaintance; or, after the lapse of many  years, to stand once more before the Sistine Madonna at Dresden, and  experience afresh all the emotions which the infinite look of the child  aroused in us for years; or to smell a flower or taste a dish again  which we have not thought of since childhood--all these produce such an  intense charm that we do not know which we enjoy most, the actual  pleasure or the old memory.  So when we return again, after long  absence, to our birth-place, the soul floats unconsciously in a sea of  memories, and the dancing waves dreamily toss themselves upon the  shores of times long passed.  The belfry clock strikes and we fear we  shall be late to school, and recovering from this fear feel relieved  that our anxiety is over.  The same dog runs along the street on whose  account we used to go far out of our way.  Here sits the old huckster  whose apples often led us into temptation, and even now, we fancy they  must taste better than all other apples in the world, notwithstanding  the dust on them.  There one has torn down a house and built a new one.  Here the old music-teacher lived.  He is dead--and yet how beautiful it  seemed as we stood and listened on summer evenings under the window  while the True Soul, when the hours of the day were over, indulged in  his own enjoyment and played fantasies, like the roaring and hissing  engine letting off the steam which has accumulated during the day.  Here in this little leafy lane, which seemed at that time so much  larger, as I was coming home late one evening, I met our neighbor's  beautiful daughter.  At that time I had never ventured to look at or  address her, but we school-children often spoke of her and called her  \"the Beautiful Maiden,\" and whenever I saw her passing along the street  at a distance I was so happy that I could only think of the time when I  should meet her nearer.  Here in this leafy walk which leads to the  church-yard, I met her one evening and she took me by the arm, although  we had never spoken together before, and asked me to go home with her.  I believe neither of us spoke a word the whole way; but I was so happy  that even now, after all these years, I wish it were that evening, and  that I could go home again, silently and blissfully, with \"the  Beautiful Maiden.\"    Thus one memory follows another until the waves dash together over our  heads, and a deep sigh swells the breast, which warns us that we have  forgotten to breathe in the midst of these pure thoughts.  Then all at  once, the whole dream-world vanishes, like uprisen ghosts at the  crowing of the cock.    As I passed by the old castle and the lindens, and saw the sentinels  upon their horses, how many memories awakened in my soul, and how  everything had changed!  Many years had flown since I was at the  castle.  The Princess was dead.  The Prince had given up his rule and  gone back to Italy, and the oldest prince, with whom I had grown up,  was regent.  His companions were young noblemen and officers, whose  intercourse was congenial to him, and whose company in our early days  had often estranged us.  Other circumstances combined to weaken our  young friendship.  Like every young man who perceives for the first  time the lack of unity in the German folk-life, and the defects of  German rule, I had caught up some phrases of the Liberal party, which  sounded as strangely at court as unseemly expressions in an honest  minister's family.  In short, it was many years since I had ascended  those stairs, and yet a being dwelt in that castle whose name I had  named almost daily, and who was almost constantly present in my memory.  I had long dwelt upon the thought that I should never see her again in  this life.  She was transformed into an image which I felt neither did  nor could exist in reality.  She had become my good angel--my other  self, to whom I talked instead of talking with myself.  How she became  so I could not explain to myself, for I scarcely knew her.  Just as the  eye sometimes pictures figures in the clouds, so I fancied my  imagination had conjured up this sweet image in the heaven of my  childhood, and a complete picture of phantasy developed itself out of  the scarcely perceptible outlines of reality.  My entire thought had  involuntarily become a dialogue with her, and all that was good in me,  all for which I struggled, all in which I believed, my entire better  self, belonged to her.  I gave it to her.  I received it from her, from  her my good angel.    I had been at home but a few days, when I received a letter one  morning.  It was written in English, and came from the Countess Marie:      _Dear Friend_: I hear you are with us for a short time.  We have not  met for many years, and if it is agreeable to you, I should like to see  an old friend again.  You will find me alone this afternoon in the  Swiss Cottage.           Yours sincerely, MARIE.      I immediately replied, also in English, that I would call in the  afternoon.    The Swiss Cottage constituted a wing of the castle, which overlooked  the garden, and could be reached without going through the castle yard.  It was five o'clock when I passed through the garden and approached the  cottage.  I repressed all emotion and prepared myself for a formal  meeting.  I sought to quiet my good angel, and to assure her that this  lady had nothing to do with her.  And yet I felt very uneasy, and my  good angel would not listen to counsel.  Finally I took courage,  murmuring something to myself about the masquerade of life, and rapped  on the door, which stood ajar.    There was no one in the room except a lad whom I did not know, and who  likewise spoke English, and said the Countess would be present in a  moment.  She then left, and I was alone, and had time to look about.    The walls of the room were of rose-chestnut, and over an openwork  trellis, a luxuriant broadleaved ivy twined around the whole room.  All  the tables and chairs were of carved rose-chestnut.  The floor was of  variegated woodwork.  It gave me a curious sensation to see so much  that was familiar in the room.  Many articles from our old play-room in  the castle were old friends, but the others were new, especially the  pictures, and yet they were the same as those in my University  room--the same portraits of Beethoven, Handel and Mendelssohn, as I had  selected--hung over the grand piano.  In one corner I saw the Venus di  Milo, which I always regarded as the masterpiece of antiquity.  On the  table were volumes of Dante, Shakspeare, Tauler's Sermons, the \"German  Theology,\" Ruckert's Poems, Tennyson and Burns, and Carlyle's \"Past and  Present,\"--the very same books--all of which I had had but recently in  my hands.  I was growing thoughtful, but I repressed my thoughts and  was just standing before the portrait of the deceased Princess, when  the door opened, and the same two servants, whom I had so often seen in  childhood, brought the Countess into the room upon her couch.    What a vision!  She spoke not a word, and her countenance was as placid  as the sea, until the servants left the room.  Then her eyes sought  me--the old, deep, unfathomable eyes.  Her expression grew more  animated each instant.  At last her whole face lit up, and she said:    \"We are old friends--I believe; we have not changed.  I cannot say  'You,' and if I may not say 'Thou,' then we must speak in English.  Do  you understand me?\"    I had not anticipated such a reception, for I saw here was no  masquerade--here was a soul which longed for another soul--here was a  greeting like that between two friends who recognize each other by the  glance of the eye, notwithstanding their disguises and dark masks.  I  seized the hand she held out to me, and replied: \"When we address an  angel, we cannot say 'You.'\"    And yet how singular, is the influence of the forms and habits of life!  How difficult it is to speak the language of nature even "]]]
