They were obliged to brave the dangers of the forests of Lebanon and of  the Taurus, the solitudes of Mesopotamia, the marshes of Chaldoa, the  voyages to Puanit and Asia Minor. Some took their way towards Assyria  and Babylon, while others embarked at Tyre or Sidon for the islands of  the AEgean Archipelago.* The endurance of all these officers, whether  governors or messengers, their courage, their tact, the ready wit they  were obliged to summon to help them out of the difficulties into which  their calling frequently brought them, all tended to enlist the public  sympathy in their favour.**         * We hear from the tablets of several messengers to Babylon,       and the Mitanni, Rasi, Mani, Khamassi. The royal messenger       Thutii, who governed the countries of the north, speaks of       having satisfied the heart of the king in \"the isles which       are in the midst of the sea.\" This was not, as some think, a       case of hyperbole, for the messengers could embark on       Phoenician vessels; they had a less distance to cover in       order to reach the AEgean than the royal messenger of Queen       Hatshopsitu had before arriving at the country of the       Somalis and the \"Ladders of Incense.\"         ** The hero of the _Anastasi Papyrus_, No. 1, with whom       Chabas made us acquainted in his _Voyage d'un Egyptien_, is       probably a type of the \"messenger\" or the time of Ramses       II.; in any case, his itinerary and adventures are natural       to a \"royal messenger\" compelled to traverse Syria alone.    Many of them achieved a reputation, and were made the heroes of popular  romance. More than three centuries after it was still related how one  of them, by name Thutii, had reduced and humbled Jaffa, whose chief had  refused to come to terms. Thutii set about his task by feigning to throw  off his allegiance to Thutmosis III., and withdrew from the Egyptian  service, having first stolen the great magic wand of his lord; he then  invited the rebellious chief into his camp, under pretence of showing  him this formidable talisman, and killed him after they had drunk  together. The cunning envoy then packed five hundred of his soldiers  into jars, and caused them to be carried on the backs of asses before  the gates of the town, where he made the herald of the murdered prince  proclaim that the Egyptians had been defeated, and that the pack train  which accompanied him contained the spoil, among which was Thutii  himself. The officer in charge of the city gate was deceived by this  harangue, the asses were admitted within the walls, where the soldiers  quitted their jars, massacred the garrison, and made themselves masters  of the town. The tale is, in the main, the story of Ali Baba and the  forty thieves.    The frontier was continually shifting, and Thutmosis III., like  Thutmosis I., vainly endeavoured to give it a fixed character by  erecting stelas along the banks of the Euphrates, at those points  where he contended it had run formerly. While Kharu and Phoenicia were  completely in the hands of the conqueror, his suzerainty became more  uncertain as it extended northwards in the direction of the Taurus.  Beyond Qodshu, it could only be maintained by means of constant  supervision, and in Naharaim its duration was coextensive with the  sojourn of the conqueror in the locality during his campaign, for it  vanished of itself as soon as he had set out on his return to Africa.  It will be thus seen that, on the continent of Asia, Egypt possessed a  nucleus of territories, so far securely under her rule that they might  be actually reckoned as provinces; beyond this immediate domain there  was a zone of waning influence, whose area varied with each reign, and  even under one king depended largely on the activity which he personally  displayed.    This was always the case when the rulers of Egypt attempted to carry  their supremacy beyond the isthmus; whether under the Ptolemies or the  native kings, the distance to which her influence extended was always  practically the same, and the teaching of history enables us to note its  limits on the map with relative accuracy.*         * The development of the Egyptian navy enabled the Ptolemies       to exercise authority over the coasts of Asia Minor and of       Thrace, but this extension of their power beyond the       indicated limits only hastened the exhaustion of their       empire. This instance, like that of Mehemet Ali, thus       confirms the position taken up in the text.    The coast towns, which were in maritime communication with the ports of  the Delta, submitted to the Egyptian yoke more readily than those of the  interior. But this submission could not be reckoned on beyond Berytus,  on the banks of the Lykos, though occasionally it stretched a little  further north as far as Byblos and Arvad; even then it did not extend  inland, and the curve marking its limits traverses Coele-Syria from  north-west to south-east, terminating at Mount Hermon. Damascus,  securely entrenched behind Anti-Lebanon, almost always lay outside this  limit. The rulers of Egypt generally succeeded without much difficulty  in keeping possession of the countries lying to the south of this line;  it demanded merely a slight effort, and this could be furnished for  several centuries without encroaching seriously on the resources of the  country, or endangering its prosperity. When, however, some province  ventured to break away from the control of Egypt, the whole mechanism  of the government was put into operation to provide soldiers and the  necessary means for an expedition. Each stage of the advance beyond the  frontier demanded a greater expenditure of energy, which, with prolonged  distances, would naturally become exhausted. The expedition would  scarcely have reached the Taurus or the Euphrates, before the force  of circumstances would bring about its recall homewards, leaving but a  slight bond of vassalage between the recently subdued countries and the  conqueror, which would speedily be cast off or give place to relations  dictated by interest or courtesy. Thutmosis III. had to submit to this  sort of necessary law; a further extension of territory had hardly  been gained when his dominion began to shrink within the frontiers that  appeared to have been prescribed by nature for an empire like that  of Egypt. Kharu and Phoenicia proper paid him their tithes with due  regularity; the cities of the Amurru and of Zahi, of Damascus, Qodshu,  Hamath, and even of Tunipa, lying on the outskirts of these two subject  nations, formed an ill-defined borderland, kept in a state of perpetual  disturbance by the secret intrigues or open rebellions of the native  princes. The kings of Alasia, Naharaim, and Mitanni preserved their  independence in spite of repeated reverses, and they treated with the  conqueror on equal terms.*         * The difference of tone between the letters of these kings       and those of the other princes, as well as the consequences       arising from it, has been clearly defined by Delattre.    The tone of their letters to the Pharaoh, the polite formulas with which  they addressed him, the special protocol which the Egyptian ministry had  drawn up for their reply, all differ widely from those which we see in  the despatches coming from commanders of garrisons or actual vassals. In  the former it is no longer a slave or a feudatory addressing his master  and awaiting his orders, but equals holding courteous communication  with each other, the brother of Alasia or of Mitanni with his brother of  Egypt. They inform him of their good health, and then, before entering  on business, they express their good wishes for himself, his wives, his  sons, the lords of his court, his brave soldiers, and for his horses.  They were careful never to forget that with a single word their  correspondent could let loose upon them a whirlwind of chariots and  archers without number, but the respect they felt for his formidable  power never degenerated into a fear which would humiliate them before  him with their faces in the dust.    This interchange of diplomatic compliments was called for by a variety  of exigencies, such as incidents arising on the frontier, secret  intrigues, personal alliances, and questions of general politics. The  kings of Mesopotamia and of Northern Syria, even those of Assyria and  Chaldaea, who were preserved by distance from the dangers of a direct  invasion, were in constant fear of an unexpected war, and heartily  desired the downfall of Egypt; they endeavoured meanwhile to occupy the  Pharaoh so fully at home that he had no leisure to attack them. Even if  they did not venture to give open encouragement to the disposition in  his subjects to revolt, they at least experienced no scruple in hiring  emissaries who secretly fanned the flame of discontent. The Pharaoh,  aroused to indignation by such plotting, reminded them of their  former oaths and treaties. The king in question would thereupon deny  everything, would speak of his tried friendship, and recall the fact  that he had refused to help a rebel against his beloved brother.* These  protestations of innocence were usually accompanied by presents, and  produced a twofold effect. They soothed the anger of the offended party,  and suggested not only a courteous answer, but the sending of still more  valuable gifts. Oriental etiquette, even in those early times, demanded  that the present of a less rich or powerful friend should place the  recipient under the obligation of sending back a gift of still greater"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17326"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 6 (of 12) (#4)"],[1," a tomb in miniature, and could  well have done duty as such, and thus meet all the needs of the soul.*         * The first to summarise the characteristics of the coffins       and sarcophagi of the second Theban period was Mariette, but       he places the use of the yellow-varnished coffins too late,       viz. during the XXIInd dynasty. Examples of them have since       been found which incontestably belong to the XXth.    [Illustration: 024.jpg THE MUMMY FACTORY]    Later still, during the XXIst and XXIInd dynasties, these two, or even  three coffins, were enclosed in a rectangular sarcophagus of thick wood,  which, surmounted by a semicircular lid, was decorated with pictures and  hallowed by prayers: four sparrow-hawks, perched on the uprights at the  corners, watched at the four cardinal points, and protected the body,  enabling the soul at the same time to move freely within the four houses  of which the world was composed.    [Illustration: 025.jpg THE PARAPHERNALIA OF A MUMMY OF THE XXth TO THE  XXIInd DYNASTIES]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from Mariette.    The workmen, after having deposited the mummy in its resting-place,  piled upon the floor of the tomb the canopio jars, the caskets, the  provisions, the furniture, the bed, and the stools and chairs; the  Usha-btiu occupied compartments in their allotted boxes, and sometimes  there would be laid beside them the mummy of a favourite animal--a  monkey, a dog of some rare breed, or a pet gazelle, whose coffins were  shaped to their respective outlines, the better to place before the  deceased the presentment of the living animal.    [Illustration: 026.jpg THE FUNERAL REPAST--MUSIC AND DANCING]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a fragment in the British       Museum. The scene representing the funeral repast and its       accompanying dances occurs frequently in the Theban tombs.    A few of the principal objects were broken or damaged, in the belief  that, by thus destroying them, their doubles would go forth and  accompany the human double, and render him their accustomed services  during the whole of his posthumous existence; a charm pronounced over  them bound them indissolubly to his person, and constrained them to obey  his will. This done, the priest muttered a final prayer, and the masons  walled up the doorway.    [Illustration: 027.jpg THE COFFIN OF THE FAVOURITE GAZELLE OF  ISIMKHOBIU]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Emil Brugsch-       Bey.    The funeral feast now took place with its customary songs and dances.  The _almehs_ addressed the guests and exhorted them to make good use of  the passing hour: \"Be happy for one day! for when you enter your tombs  you will rest there eternally throughout the length of every day!\"    Immediately after the repast the friends departed from the tomb, and the  last link which connected the dead with our world was then broken. The  sacred harper was called upon to raise the farewell hymn:*         * The harper is often represented performing this last       office. In the tomb of Nofirhotpu, and in many others, the       daughters or the relatives of the deceased accompany or even       replace the harper; in this case they belonged to a priestly       family, and fulfilled the duties of the \"Female Singers\" of       Amon or some other god.    \"O instructed mummies, ennead of the gods of the coffin, who listen to  the praises of this dead man, and who daily extol the virtues of this  instructed mummy, who is living eternally like a god, ruling in Amentit,  ye also who shall live in the memory of posterity, all ye who shall  come and read these hymns inscribed, according to the rites, within  the tombs, repeat: 'The greatness of the under-world, what is it? The  annihilation of the tomb, why is it?' It is to conform to the image  of the land of Eternity, the true country where there is no strife and  where violence is held in abhorrence, where none attacks his neighbour,  and where none among our generations who rest within it is rebellious,  from the time when your race first existed, to the moment when it shall  become a multitude of multitudes, all going the same way; for instead  of remaining in this land of Egypt, there is not one but shall leave it,  and there is said to all who are here below, from the moment of their  waking to life: 'Go, prosper safe and sound, to reach the tomb at  length, a chief among the blessed, and ever mindful in thy heart of the  day when thou must lie down on the funeral bed!'\" The ancient song  of Antuf, modified in the course of centuries, was still that which  expressed most forcibly the melancholy thought paramount in the minds of  the friends assembled to perform the last rites. \"The impassibility of  the chief* is, in truth, the best of fates!\"         * Osiris is here designated by the word \"chief,\" as I have       already pointed out.    [Illustration: 029.jpg ONE OF THE HARPERS OF THE TOMB OF RAMSES III.]         Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph taken Byjnsinger in       1881.    \"Since the times of the god bodies are created merely to pass away, and  young generations take their place: Ra rises in the morning, Tumu lies  down to rest in the land of the evening, all males generate, the females  conceive, every nose inhales the air from the morning of their birth  to the day when they go to their place! Be happy then for one day, O  man!--May there ever be perfumes and scents for thy nostrils, garlands  and lotus-flowers for thy shoulders and for the neck of thy beloved  sister* who sits beside thee! Let there be singing and music before  thee, and, forgetting all thy sorrows, think only of pleasure until the  day when thou must enter the country of Maritsakro, the silent goddess,  though all the same the heart of the son who loves thee will not cease  to beat! Be happy for one day, O man!--I have heard related what befell  our ancestors; their walls are destroyed, their place is no more, they  are as those who have ceased to live from the time of the god! The walls  of thy tomb are strong, thou hast planted trees at the edge of thy pond,  thy soul reposes beneath them and drinks the water; follow that which  seemeth good to thee as long as thou art on earth, and give bread to him  who is without land, that thou mayest be well spoken of for evermore.  Think upon the gods who have lived long ago: their meat offerings  fall in pieces as if they had been torn by a panther, their loaves are  defiled with dust, their statues no longer stand upright within the  temple of Ra, their followers beg for alms! Be happy for one day!\"         * Marriages between brothers and sisters in Egypt rendered       this word \"sister\" the most natural appellation.    Those gone before thee \"have had their hour of joy,\" and they have put  off sadness \"which shortens the moments until the day when hearts are  destroyed!--Be mindful, therefore, of the day when thou shalt be taken  to the country where all men are mingled: none has ever taken thither  his goods with him, and no one can ever return from it!\" The grave did  not, however, mingle all men as impartially as the poet would have us  believe. The poor and insignificant had merely a place in the common  pit, which was situated in the centre of the Assassif,* one of the  richest funerary quarters of Thebes.         * There is really only one complete description of a       cemetery of the poor, namely, that given by A. Rhind.       Mariette caused extensive excavations to be made by Gabet       and Vassalli, 1859-1862, in the Assassif, near the spot       worked by Rhind, and the objects found are now in the Gizeh       Museum, but the accounts of the work are among his       unpublished papers, vassalli assures me that he sometimes       found the mummies piled one on another to the depth of sixty       bodies, and even then he did not reach the lowest of the       pile. The hurried excavations which I made in 1882 and 1884,       appeared to confirm these statements of Rhind and Vassalli.    Yawning trenches stood ever open there, ready to receive their prey;  the rites were hurriedly performed, and the grave-diggers covered the  mummies of the day's burial with a little sand, out of which we receive  them intact, sometimes isolated, sometimes in groups of twos or threes,  showing that they had not even been placed in regular layers. Some  are wrapped only in bandages of coarse linen, and have been consigned  without further covering to the soil, while others have been bound round  with palm-leaves laid side by side, so as to form a sort of primitive  basket. The class above the poorest people were buried in rough-hewn  wooden boxes, smaller at the feet than towards the head, and devoid of  any inscription or painting. Many have been placed in any coffin that  came to hand, with a total indifference as to suitability of size;  others lie in a badly made bier, made up of the fragments of one or more  older biers. None of them possessed any funerary furniture, except the  tools of his trade, a thin pair of leather shoes, sandals of cardboard  or plaited reeds, rings of terra-cotta or bronze, bracelets or necklets  of a single row of blue beads, statuettes of divinities, mystic eyes,  scarabs, and, above all, cords tied round the neck, arms, limbs, or  waist, to keep off, by their mystic knots, all malign influences.    The whole population of the necropolis made their living out of the  dead. This was true of all ranks of society, headed by the sacerdotal  colleges of the royal chapels,* and followed by the priestly bodies, to  whom was entrusted the care of the tombs in the various sections,  but the most influential of whom confined their attentions to the old  burying-ground, \"Isit-mait,\" the True Place.**         * We find on several monuments the names of persons       belonging to these sacerdotal bodies, priests of Ahmosis I.,       priests of Thutmosis I., of Thut-mosis II., of Amenothes     "]]]
