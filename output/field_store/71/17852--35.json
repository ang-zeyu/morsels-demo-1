It may not be forgotten that the Indian was surprised in the \"heart of  his own country\"--treading his own soil--within sight of his  home--that home was invaded by armed men of the same race with those  who had inflicted on his tribe irreparable injuries--his wife was  seized by them--his attempts to release her, which ought to have been  respected, were violently resisted,--and then, maddened by the bonds  and captivity of his wife, he continues, with a courage and devotion  to her which merited a far different fate, singly his conflict with  ten armed men--he is shot, and his death is coldly ascribed to his  \"obstinacy.\" Had the Indian tamely permitted his wife to have been  carried away from him--had he without feeling or emotion witnessed the  separation of the mother from her infant child, then indeed little  sympathy would have been felt for him--and yet it is precisely because  he did show that he possessed feelings common to us all, and without  the possession of which man becomes more degraded than the brute, that  he was shot. Thus perished the ill-fated husband of poor Mary March,  and she herself, from the moment when her hand was touched by the  white man, became the child of sorrow, a character which never left  her, until she became shrouded in an early tomb. Among her tribe she  was known as \"De mas do weet,\"--her husband's name was \"No nos baw  sut.\"    In an official report Mary March is described as a young woman of  about twenty-three years of age--of a gentle and interesting  disposition, acquiring and retaining without any difficulty any words  she was taught. She had one child, who, as was subsequently  ascertained, died a couple of days after its mother's capture. Mary  March was first taken to Twillingate, where, she was placed under the  care of the Revd. Mr. Leigh, Episcopal Missionary, who, upon the  opening of the season, came with her to St. John's. She never  recovered from the effects of her grief at the death of her  husband--her health rapidly declined, and the Government, with the  view of restoring her to her tribe, sent a small sloop-of-war with her  to the northward, with orders to her Commander to proceed to the  summer haunts of the Indians; from this attempt, however, he returned  unsuccessful. Captain Buchan, in the _Grashopper_, was subsequently  sent to accomplish the same object. He left St. John's in September,  1819, for the Exploits, but poor Mary March died on board the vessel  at the mouth of the river. Captain Buchan had her body carried up the  lake, where he left it in a coffin, in a place where it was probable  her tribe would find her,--traces of Indians were seen while the party  was on its way up,--and in fact, although unaware of it, Captain  Buchan and his men were watched by a party of Indians, who that winter  were encamped on the river Exploits, and when they observed Captain  Buchan and his men pass up the river on the ice, they went down to the  sea coast, near the mouth of the river, and remained there a month;  after that they returned, and saw the footsteps of Captain Buchan's  party made on their way down the river. The Indians, then, by a  circuitous route, went to the lake, and to the spot where the body of  Mary March was left--they opened the coffin and took out the clothes  that were left with her. The coffin was allowed to remain suspended as  they found it for a month, it was then placed on the ground, where, it  remained two months; in the spring they removed the body to the burial  place which they had built for her husband, placing her by his side.    A narrative of the circumstances which attended the capture of Mary  March was published in Liverpool in 1829, and written, as is alleged,  by a person who formed one of the party when the capture was effected.  Although this narrative contains some inaccuracies, yet it bears  internal evidence of being the production of a person who really  witnessed the scenes he describes, and though differing in several  particulars from the account as before detailed, yet it describes many  events which the leader of the party may have omitted, and states  nothing absolutely irreconcileable with his account--with some  omissions, not necessarily connected with the main object of the  expedition, this second record of the circumstances associated with it  is now inserted, in so far at least as the same were published:--         TRIBE OF RED INDIANS.         _To the Editor of the Liverpool Mercury_.         SIR.--Observing among the details in the _Mercury_ of September       18, that of \"Shawnadithit, supposed to be the last of the Red       Indians,\" or Aborigines of Newfoundland, I am tempted to offer       a few remarks on the subject, convinced as I am that she cannot       be the last of the tribe by many hundreds. Having resided a       considable time in that part of the north of Newfoundland which       they most frequented, and being one of the party who captured       Mary March in 1819, I have embodied into a narrative the events       connected with her capture, which I am confident will gratify       many of your readers.         Proceeding northward, the country gradually assumes a more       fertile appearance; the trees, which in the south are, except       in a few places, stunted in their growth, now begin to assume a       greater height and strength till you reach the neighbourhood of       Exploits River and Bay; here the timber is of a good size and       quality, and in sufficient quantity to serve the purposes of       the inhabitants:--both here and at Trinity Bay some very fine       vessels have been built. To Exploits Bay it was that the Red       Indians came every summer for the purpose of fishing, the place       abounding with salmon. No part of the Bay was inhabited; the       islands at the mouth, consisting of Twillingate, Exploits       Island, and Burnt Islands, had a few inhabitants. There were       also several small harbours in a large island, the name of       which I now forget, including Herring Neck and Morton. In 1820       the population of Twillingate amounted to 720, and that of all       the other places might perhaps amount to as many more;--they       were chiefly descendants from West of England settlers; and       having many of them been for several generations without       religious or moral instruction of any kind, were immersed in       the lowest state of ignorance and vice. Latterly, however,       churches have been built and schools established, and, I have       been credibly informed that the moral and intellectual state of       the people is much improved. While I was there the church was       opened, and I must say that the people came in crowds to attend       a place of worship, many of them coming fifteen and twenty       miles purposely to attend.         On the first settlement of the country, the Indians naturally       viewed the intruders with a jealous eye, and some of the       settlers having repeatedly robbed their nets, &c., they       retaliated and stole several boats' sails, implements of iron,       &c. The settlers, in return, mercilessly shot all the Indians       they could meet with:--in fact so fearful were the latter of       fire-arms, that, in an open space, one person with a gun would       frighten a hundred; when concealed among the bushes, however,       they often made a most desperate resistance. I have heard an       old man, named Rogers, living on Twillingate Great Island,       boast that he had shot, at different periods, above sixty of       them. So late as 1817, this wretch, accompanied by three       others, one day discovered nine unfortunate Indians lying       asleep on a small island far up the bay. Loading the large       guns[A] very heavily, they rowed up to them, and each taking       aim, fired. One only rose, and rushing into the water,       endeavoured to swim to another island, close by, covered with       wood; but the merciless wretch followed in the boat, and       butchered the poor creature in the water with an axe, then took       the body to the shore and piled it on those of the other eight,       whom his companions had in the meantime put out of their       misery. He minutely described, to me the spot, and I afterwards       visited the place, and found their bones in a heap, bleached       and whitened with the winter's blast.         I have now, I think, said enough to account for the _shyness_       of the Indians towards the settlers, but could relate many       other equally revolting scenes, some of which I shall hereafter       touch upon. In 1815 or 1816, Lieutenant, now Captain Buchan,       set out on an expedition to endeavour to meet with the Indians,       for the purpose of opening a friendly communication with them.       He succeeded in meeting with them, and the intercourse seemed       firmly established, so much so, that two of them consented to       go and pass the night with Captain Buchan's party, he leaving       two of his men who volunteered to stop. On returning to the       Indians' encampment in the morning, accompanied by the two who       had remained all night, on approaching the spot, the two       Indians manifested considerable disquietude, and after       exchanging a few glances with each other, broke from their       conductors and rushed into the woods. On arriving at the       encampment. Captain Buchan's poor fellows lay on the ground a       frightful spectacle, their heads being severed from their       bodies, and almost cut to pieces.         In the summer of 1818, a person who had established a salmon       fishery at the mouth of Exploits River, had a number of       articles stolen by the Indians; they consisted of a gold watch,       left"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15127"],[0,"Pitman's Commercial Spanish Grammar (2nd ed.)

(Leccion cuarta.)                            THE ADJECTIVE.      The Adjective in Spanish agrees with the noun it qualifies, in gender  and number, as--    El periodico italiano: The Italian newspaper.  La prensa americana: The American press.    It generally _follows the nouns_ as in the above examples, although  exceptions will be found, _e.g._, when the adjective recalls to our mind  a quality which _is already known to belong to it_, it generally  precedes the noun, as--    He visto sus hermosas flores: I have seen his beautiful flowers.[30]  Adjectives form their plural in the same way as nouns.    [Footnote 30: His flowers are known (or supposed) to be beautiful, before  we say it.]    =Formation of the Feminine of Adjectives=.    Adjectives ending in _O_ change _O_ into =A=, as--    El sombrero blanco: The white hat.  La casaca blanca: The white coat.    Adjectives of NATIONALITY which end in a consonant add =A= to form the  feminine, as--    El sastre frances: The French tailor.  La modista francesa: The French milliner.    Adjectives ending in _N_ add =A= for the feminine, as--    Un hombre socarron: A sly or cunning man.  Una sonrisa socarrona: A cunning smile.    EXCEPT Joven (young), Comun (common), and Ruin (base, sordid), which do  not change for the feminine.    Adjectives ending in _or_ add =A= to form the feminine, as--    Un comerciante emprendedor: An enterprising merchant.  Una casa emprendedora: An enterprising firm.    EXCEPT =Comparative= adjectives ending in _or_, as Mejor (better), Peor  (worse), which do not change for the feminine.    There are a very few adjectives ending in _ete_ and _ote_. These change  into =eta= and =ota= for the feminine.    Other adjectives do not change.      +------------------------------+--------------------+------------------+  |         Ser[31] (to be).     |        Estar[32] (to be).             |  +------------------------------+--------------------+------------------+  |_Pres.
