All night, while she felt the  warm little bodies of the puppies pressed against her side, she had  stared into the darkness, thinking of the time when Prince Jan and his  brother must go out, like their father, Rex, to do the work of the St.  Bernards.    \"Yes,\" Bruno added in a queer voice, \"but this man said he was from  California, where they never have any snow!\"    \"What?\" shouted all the dogs together. \"A place where they never have  any snow? Oh, what a funny place that must be!\"    \"What do they walk on?\" asked Jan's mother curiously.    Before Bruno could answer, Jan shoved up and said earnestly: \"But,  mother, how do dogs save people where there is no snow?\"    \"I am sure I don't know,\" she told him. \"Ask Bruno.\"    Neither Bruno nor any of the other dogs could explain this mystery,  though Jan went to each in turn for an answer to his question. At last  he lay down, his nose wedged between his paws, his yellow forehead  wrinkled with thought, and he stared across at the tops of the great  white peaks above the enclosure until his soft eyes closed in sleep.  Soon he was dreaming that he was digging travellers from the snow and  asking them, \"Won't you please tell me how a dog can save people in a  land where there is no snow?\"    But none of them could answer his question.          Chapter III    A NEW WORLD      The next morning Mr. Pixley and Brother Antoine returned to the kennel  yard and Jan wagged his tail politely to show that he recognized the  visitor, who leaned down and patted him while talking to the monk.    \"You may be sure he will receive the very best care,\" said the man from  California.    \"We are always treated kindly,\" Prince Jan hastened to say, and he  glanced at Rollo, who replied, \"Of course, we are!\"    The two pups did not notice Mr. Pixley's next words, \"My little girl  will be delighted with him.\"    Brother Antoine called, \"Here, Jan,\" and when the little fellow stood  looking up with bright, expectant eyes, the monk fastened a collar about  the dog's neck.    Jan trembled. He was sure that he was now going to be sent out to do  his first work on the trail. It would not be playing this time, but real  work like the big dogs. The collar was stiff but he did not mind the  discomfort, for it meant that he was not a puppy any longer. He twisted  his head to see which of the older dogs was to go out with him, as he  crossed the forbidden line with the monk. The only dog that followed Jan  was his brother, Rollo, and when Brother Antoine ordered, \"Go back,  Rollo!\" the pup's ears and tail drooped and he slunk back to his mother  as though in disgrace.    \"The big dogs must be waiting outside,\" thought Jan happily, and he  walked proudly beside the monk until he stood on the top step, then he  looked back at his mother, Bruno, Rollo, and the other dogs who were  watching him. Usually they all barked joyously when a pup was to go out  on his first real work, and the noisy barks were advice. Now, the only  sounds were two short barks from Bruno, \"Good-bye, Jan! Remember your  father!\"    \"I will remember him!\" he called back, and then he wondered at the long,  despairing howl from his mother. It filled his heart with dread.    \"Come, Jan,\" the monk spoke, and the little fellow turned obediently  toward the door that would shut him from sight of the other dogs. His  feet dragged now, and as he passed through the doorway leading to the  long corridor he looked back once more.    When he stood outside the big entrance door, he saw the snow covering  the mountains and hiding the chasms that he had seen in the summer when  he had been out having his lessons with Rollo. He knew these smooth,  level places held real danger. Then he saw dog tracks leading in two  directions from the steps, but none of the older dogs were waiting for  him. As he looked up with questioning, brown eyes, Brother Antoine  leaned down and fastened a stout rope to the new collar and handed the  end of this rope to Mr. Pixley, who was muffled in his big, fur coat. A  guide was with Mr. Pixley. As they stood there a moment, the door of the  Hospice again opened, and this time the grey-eyed man and another guide  came out. The kind, grey eyes looked at Jan, then the man stooped over  and patted him gently, and no one but the dog heard the pitying voice  that said, \"Poor little Prince Jan! Good-bye!\"    Brother Antoine lifted Jan's nose and the pup looked into the monk's  eyes, but there was something he did not understand. It was all so  different from what the other dogs had told him. He felt the rope tug  his collar and knew that he must follow this stranger. He heard again a  heart-rending howl from his mother, \"Good-bye, Jan, good-bye!\" Bruno's  voice blended with hers, and then the voices of all the dogs Jan knew  and loved mingled in that call. Something hurt him all over, but most of  the hurt was in his heart.    He halted suddenly, pulled stiffly on the rope and the wild cry he sent  in response echoed mournfully from the high, white crags and died away  to a whispering moan, as Prince Jan, with low-hanging head and drooping  tail, travelled down the path that his ancestors had trodden many years  on their errands of mercy. He wondered why he had been sent out with a  rope tied to his collar, why no older dog went with him, and why he must  follow this stranger instead of one of the monks. Jan felt that he was  disgraced. Someway he had failed. For a while he followed despondently,  then he tried to comfort himself as he trudged at the end of the rope.    \"Bruno and mother will know what is the matter,\" he thought hopefully.  \"I'll ask them as soon as I get home to-night.\"    He looked back wistfully several times to see if the kindly, grey-eyed  stranger might be following them, but he had taken the opposite trail  from the one Mr. Pixley was travelling. Jan did not mind the long tramp  which ended at a place where houses were scattered about. Here a  carriage and horses were brought, and Jan would have been much  interested in these strange things had he not been so worried. He felt  himself lifted into the carriage with Mr. Pixley; then, as it moved, Jan  was thrown against the fur coat and looked up in fright.    \"You are going to a new land,\" Mr. Pixley said, smoothing the pup's  velvety ear.    The dog lifted one paw and laid it on the man's knee, the brown eyes  that looked up were dull with misery. Jan knew, now, that he was being  taken away from the Hospice.    \"Won't you take me back?\" he begged.    But the man only heard a little whimper, and gave the dog a quick pat.  \"You and Elizabeth will be great friends. Lie down now and be quiet!\"    Jan dropped to the floor of the carriage, his head between his paws,  and his eyes that stared at the strange new master were full of wistful  pleading.    After that ride came days in a big, dark place that bumped and jerked  with horrible noises. He did not know that he was on a train. Jan had  lived all his life where the only disturbing sounds were the soft thud  of melting snow and the hissing of the avalanches down the mountain  sides. These strange noises hurt his ears. The pain in his heart kept  growing until he could only lie still and draw his breath in smothered  little whimpers that tore the inside of his throat. He could not eat nor  drink.    When Mr. Pixley took him from the train, the dog was led through crowds  of people and bustling, noisy streets that made Jan cringe and cower. At  last they reached a place where water stretched so far that it touched  the sky, and the water kept moving all the time. This frightened him,  for he had never seen any water excepting in the little lake at the  Hospice, and that water did not move, for it was nearly always frozen  over. Bewildered, Jan hung back, but the man to whom Mr. Pixley had  handed the rope dragged the dog up a walk of boards to a  strange-looking house on top of the water. Jan stumbled down the dark  stairs, into a hot, smelly place where he was fastened to a wall. An old  sack was thrown down, water and meat placed before him, then he was left  alone. Whistles screamed, bells jangled, all sorts of noises pounded  Jan's shrinking, sensitive ears as he cowered in an agony of fear. The  boat moved; but he thought, as it puffed and trembled, that a huge,  strange animal had swallowed him alive.    The rolling motion made him very sick. He could neither eat nor sleep,  but grew stiff and sore during the days and nights he was kept tied in  the hold of the vessel. Homesick and lonesome, poor little Prince Jan  lay for hours crying softly, but the only attention any one gave him was  to fill pans with water and food.    One day two women, wearing white caps on their heads, climbed down the  stairs with a little girl and boy. The children ran and put their arms  about the dog's neck and Jan wriggled and squirmed with happiness, while  he licked their hands and faces.    \"Don't touch him,\" cried one of the women, pulling the girl away. \"He  is filthy, beside, he might bite you.\"    The child drew back in alarm. Jan's gentle eyes watched them and his  tail waved slowly, trying to make them know that he loved them and would  not hurt them or anybody in the world.    \"He won't hurt us, Nurse,\" the boy declared and put his hand on the  dog's big head. \"I don't care whether he's dirty or clean, he's a bully  fine dog, and I wish he belonged to me and sister!\"    \"Oh, if they will only stay with me!\" hoped Jan. \"Maybe they would  understand and some day take me back to the Hospice.\"    The boy smiled into Jan's eyes, but he did not know"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14900"],[0,"The Black Man's Place in South Africa (#4)"],[1,"Keith, who is  admittedly the highest authority on the subject to-day, makes the  following statement: \"Unfortunately our knowledge of the brain, greatly  as it has increased of late years, has not yet reached the point at  which we can say after close examination of all the features of a brain  that its owner has reached this or that status. The statement which  Huxley made about the ancient human skull from the cave of Engis still  holds good of the brain: 'It might have belonged to a philosopher or  might have contained the thoughtless mind of a savage.' That is only  one side of our problem, there is another. Huxley's statement refers to  the average brain, which is equal to the needs of both the philosopher  and the savage. It does not in any way invalidate the truth that a small  brain with a simple pattern of convolutions is a less capable organ than  the large brain with a complex pattern. If then we find a fairly large  brain in the Piltdown man, with an arrangement and development of  convolutions not very unlike those of a modern man, we shall be  justified in drawing the conclusion that, so far as potential mental  ability is concerned, he has reached the modern standard. We must always  keep in mind that accomplishments and inventions which seem so simple to  us were new and unsolved problems to the pioneers who worked their way  up from a simian to a human estate.\"    In his concluding remarks upon this important find, Dr. Keith iterates  his opinion: \"Although our knowledge of the human brain is  limited--there are large areas to which we can assign no definite  function--we may rest assured that a brain which was shaped in a mould  so similar to our own was one which responded to the outside world as  ours does. Piltdown man saw, heard, felt, thought and dreamt much as we  still do. If the eoliths found in the same bed of gravel were his  handiwork, then we can also say he had made a great stride towards that  state which has culminated in the inventive civilisation of the modern  western world.\"[13]    Professor Herbert Donaldson of the University of Chicago, gives it as  his opinion that \"In comparing remote times with the present, or in our  own age, races which have reached distinction with those which have  remained obscure, it is by no means clear that the grade of civilisation  attained is associated with a corresponding enlargement in the nervous  system, or with an increase in the mental capabilities of the best  representatives of those communities.\"[14]    Now while the ordinary man is unable to pronounce judgment upon expert  opinion he is quite capable of understanding the main arguments upon  which the foregoing conclusions are based. We all realise the truth of  the old saying \"Il n'y a que le premier pas qui coute.\" We all  appreciate the tremendous difficulty of taking the first step in the way  of discovery and invention. We know that to be the first to step forward  in an utterly new direction or venture; to be the first to work out,  without any guidance or previous education, the first principles,  however simple, in the doing, or thinking out of anything new, requires  a mental audacity and astuteness that predicate a brain capacity as  great as that which enables modern man to apply and develop the  accumulated knowledge available in the text-books of to-day. Dr. Alfred  Russell Wallace held strongly to this opinion. He could see no proof of  continuously increasing intellectual power; he thought that where the  greatest advance in intellect is supposed to have been made this might  be wholly due to the cumulative effect of successive acquisitions of  knowledge handed down from age to age by written or printed books; that  Euclid and Archimedes were probably the equals of any of our greatest  mathematicians of to-day; and that we are entitled to believe that the  higher intellectual and moral nature of man has been approximately  stationary during the whole period of human history. This great and  intrepid thinker states his view with characteristic incisiveness thus:  \"Many writers thoughtlessly speak of the hereditary effects of strength  or skill due to any mechanical work or special art being continued  generation after generation in the same family, as amongst the castes of  India. But of any progressive improvement there is no evidence whatever.  Those children who had a natural aptitude for the work would, of course,  form the successors of their parents, and there is no proof of anything  hereditary except as regards this innate aptitude. Many people are  alarmed at the statement that the effects of education and training are  not hereditary, and think that if that were really the case there would  be no hope for improvement of the race; but close consideration will  show them that if the results of our education in the widest sense, in  the home, in the shop, in the nation, and in the world at large, had  really been hereditary, even in the slightest degree, then indeed there  would be little hope for humanity, and there is no clearer proof of this  than the fact that we have not _all_ been made much worse--the wonder  being that any fragment of morality, or humanity, or the love of truth  or justice for their own sakes still exists among us.\"[15]    I think the majority of thoughtful people will agree that these words  express their own observations. Every day we see how children have to be  taught to act and behave. We see continually how parents have to put  pressure on their children to make them accept and apply those moral  principles and mental valuations which have guided their lives and the  lives of thousands of generations before them. We know only too well  that children do not inherit the moral standards of right and wrong of  their parents, and that to establish these principles in the young is a  matter of protracted and often painful inculcation. The proved maxim  that honesty is the best policy is still being literally hammered into  the children of to-day who seem to find it no easier to follow the  better way than did the children of the past. If mental modifications  acquired by the parents were in any degree transmissible to the  offspring then there would be no need for this constant repetition of  the same process in every new generation.    The earliest indubitable man hitherto discovered was fully evolved when  first met with, he was _homo sapiens_. By means of his human  intelligence this frail, unspecialized being became in a sense the very  lord of creation, for instead of remaining, like the animals, entirely  subject to his surroundings he subjected his surroundings to himself. By  means of this intelligence man was enabled to break away from the  absolute rule of the law of natural selection which punishes with  extinction all those types that fail in fitness for survival in the  struggle for existence, so that, unlike the animals that die out when  their particular structure does not fit in with their environment, man  by means of his thinking brain was able to equip himself with parts of  his environment, and thus to become its master. The process of evolution  ceased to affect directly this creature who had a brain that could  think, and ever since that brain was given to him man has remained  unmoved and stationary above and apart from all other living things. All  this is implied in the command, \"Be ye fruitful and multiply and  replenish the earth and subdue it.\"    But though man became almost emancipated from the direct servitude of  natural selection, he still is, and always will be, subject to the law  of heredity. Man is made up of a group of innate characters inherited  from a very mixed ancestry, these characters, being innate, are  transmissible to his offspring, but such characters as are acquired by  the parent through the direct influence of education or other  environment, not being innate are not transmissible to his children. But  in so far as a new development of latent and innate characters, through  the influence of the environment, may help or hinder certain types in  propagating themselves, the race may, perhaps, be modified through such  influence by the process of gradual elimination of the types that lack  the characters that prove to be of survival value in a particular  locality. This we may suppose might happen where a number of Europeans,  composed half of blondes and half of brunettes, come to live in a  tropical country, if it be proved that the comparative darkness of the  brunettes afford them better protection against inimical light and heat  than the fair skin of the blondes, so that the former would on the  average, enjoy better health and live longer, and therefore have more  children than the latter, whereby, in course of time, the appearance of  these people would be modified in respect of the general complexion of  their skin. This, it is easy to see, would not mean the acquisition of a  new and heritable means of protection, but only a development in each  individual of an already present innate character that happened to be  well fitted for survival in a certain climatic zone.    In order, therefore, to obtain any direct modification of the race in  the way of mental improvement the physical effect of education must be  such as to ensure longer life and with it, the concomitant chance of  greater fertility for those who are educated against those who are not,  so that the latter would tend to die out while the former would continue  to increase their numbers. In other words, education must prove to be  of survival value. Seeing that where education has increased most the  birth-rate has tended to decrease it seems clear that we cannot regard  continuous mental training as a favourable factor in the competition of  propagation of human varieties.    If then we accept the conclusion that the effects of individual  experience are not cumulatively hereditary we shall cease to cavil at "]]]
