For my part, I desire to see the time when education--and by its means  morality, sobriety, enterprise, and industry--shall become much more  general than at present; and should be gratified to have it in my power  to contribute something to the advancement of any measure which might  have a tendency to accelerate that happy period.    With regard to existing laws, some alterations are thought to be  necessary. Many respectable men have suggested that our estray laws--the  law respecting the issuing of executions, the road law, and some  others--are deficient in their present form, and require alterations.  But considering the great probability that the framers of those laws  were wiser than myself, I should prefer not meddling with them, unless  they were first attacked by others, in which case I should feel it both  a privilege and a duty to take that stand which, in my view, might tend  to the advancement of justice.    But, fellow-citizens, I shall conclude. Considering the great degree of  modesty which should always attend youth, it is probable I have already  been more presuming than becomes me. However, upon the subjects of which  I have treated, I have spoken as I have thought. I may be wrong in  regard to any or all of them; but, holding it a sound maxim that it is  better only to be sometimes right than at all times wrong, so soon as I  discover my opinions to be erroneous I shall be ready to renounce them.    Every man is said to have his peculiar ambition. Whether it be true or  not, I can say, for one, that I have no other so great as that of being  truly esteemed of my fellow-men by rendering myself worthy of their  esteem. How far I shall succeed in gratifying this ambition is yet to be  developed. I am young and unknown to many of you; I was born and have  ever remained in the most humble walks of life. I have no wealthy or  popular relations or friends to recommend me. My case is thrown  exclusively upon the independent voters of the county, and if elected,  they will have conferred a favour upon me for which I shall be  unremitting in my labours to compensate. But if the good people in their  wisdom shall see fit to keep me in the background, I have been too  familiar with disappointments to be very much chagrined.         Your friend and fellow-citizen,         A. LINCOLN.          _Letter to Colonel Robert Allen. June 21, 1836_      Dear Colonel, I am told that during my absence last week you passed  through this place, and stated publicly that you were in possession of a  fact or facts which, if known to the public, would entirely destroy the  prospects of N.W. Edwards and myself at the ensuing election; but that,  through favour to us, you should forbear to divulge them. No one has  needed favours more than I, and, generally, few have been less unwilling  to accept them; but in this case favour to me would be injustice to the  public, and therefore I must beg your pardon for declining it. That I  once had the confidence of the people of Sangamon, is sufficiently  evident; and if I have since done anything, either by design or  misadventure, which if known would subject me to a forfeiture of that  confidence, he that knows of that thing, and conceals it, is a traitor  to his country's interest.    I find myself wholly unable to form any conjecture of what fact or  facts, real or supposed, you spoke; but my opinion of your veracity will  not permit me for a moment to doubt that you at least believed what you  said. I am flattered with the personal regard you manifested for me; but  I do hope that, on more mature reflection, you will view the public  interest as a paramount consideration, and therefore determine to let  the worst come. I here assure you that the candid statement of facts on  your part, however low it may sink me, shall never break the tie of  personal friendship between us. I wish an answer to this, and you are at  liberty to publish both, if you choose.          _Lincoln's Opinion on Universal Suffrage. From a Letter published in the  Sangamon \"Journal.\" June 13, 1836_      I go for all sharing the privileges of the government who assist in  bearing its burdens: consequently I go for admitting all whites to the  right of suffrage who pay taxes or bear arms [by no means excluding  females].          _From an Address before the Young Men's Lyceum of Springfield, Illinois.  January 27, 1837_      As a subject for the remarks of the evening \"The perpetuation of our  political institutions\" is selected. In the great journal of things  happening under the sun, we, the American people, find our account  running under the date of the nineteenth century of the Christian era.  We find ourselves in the peaceful possession of the fairest portion of  the earth, as regards extent of territory, fertility of soil, and  salubrity of climate. We find ourselves under the government of a system  of political institutions conducing more essentially to the ends of  civil and religious liberty, than any of which the history of former  times tells us. We, when remounting the stage of existence, found  ourselves the legal inheritors of these fundamental blessings. We toiled  not in the acquirement or the establishment of them; they are a legacy  bequeathed to us by a once hardy, brave, and patriotic, but now lamented  and departed race of ancestors.    Theirs was the task (and nobly they performed it) to possess themselves,  and through themselves us, of this goodly land, and to rear upon its  hills and valleys a political edifice of liberty and equal rights; 'tis  ours only to transmit these,--the former unprofaned by the foot of the  invader; the latter undecayed by lapse of time. This, our duty to  ourselves and to our posterity, and love for our species in general,  imperatively require us to perform.    How, then, shall we perform it? At what point shall we expect the  approach of danger? By what means shall we fortify against it? Shall we  expect some transatlantic military giant to step across the ocean and  crush us at a blow? Never. All the armies of Europe, Asia and Africa  combined, with all the treasure of the earth (our own excepted) in their  military chest, with a Bonaparte for a commander, could not, by force,  take a drink from the Ohio, or make a track on the Blue Ridge, in a  trial of a thousand years.    At what point, then, is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer,  if it ever reaches us, it must spring up among us. It cannot come from  abroad. If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and  finisher. As a nation of freemen, we must live through all time, or die  by suicide.    There is even now something of ill omen among us. I mean the increasing  disregard for law which pervades the country; the growing disposition to  substitute wild and furious passions in lieu of the sober judgment of  courts; and the worse than savage mobs for the executive ministers of  justice. This disposition is awfully fearful in any community; and that  it now exists in ours, though grating to our feelings to admit, it would  be a violation of truth and an insult to our intelligence to deny.           *       *       *       *       *    I know the American people are _much_ attached to their government. I  know they would suffer _much_ for its sake. I know they would endure  evils long and patiently before they would ever think of exchanging it  for another. Yet, notwithstanding all this, if the laws be continually  despised and disregarded, if their rights to be secure in their persons  and property are held by no better tenure than the caprice of a mob, the  alienation of their affection for the government is the natural  consequence, and to that sooner or later it must come.    Here, then, is one point at which danger may be expected. The question  recurs, how shall we fortify against it? The answer is simple. Let every  American, every lover of liberty, every well-wisher to his posterity,  swear by the blood of the Revolution never to violate in the least  particular the laws of the country, and never to tolerate their  violation by others. As the patriots of seventy-six did to the support  of the Declaration of Independence, so to the support of the  Constitution and the Laws let every American pledge his life, his  property, and his sacred honour; let every man remember that to violate  the law is to trample on the blood of his father, and to tear the  charter of his own and his children's liberty. Let reverence for the  laws be breathed by every American mother to the lisping babe that  prattles on her lap. Let it be taught in schools, in seminaries, and in  colleges. Let it be written in primers, spelling-books, and in almanacs.  Let it be preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative halls, and  enforced in courts of justice. And, in short, let it become the  political religion of the nation.    When I so pressingly urge a strict observance of all the laws, let me  not be understood as saying that there are no bad laws, or that  grievances may not arise for the redress of which no legal provisions  have been made. I mean to say no such thing. But I do mean to say that  although bad laws, if they exist, should be repealed as soon as  possible, still, while they continue in force, for the sake of example  they should be religiously observed. So also in unprovided cases. If  such arise, let proper legal provisions be made for them with the least  possible delay, but till then let them, if not too intolerable, be borne  with.    There is no grievance that is a fit object of redress by mob"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14742"],[0,"Vanishing England (#4)"],[1," to use the  present participle, not the past. It is vanishing England, not  vanished, of which we treat; and if we can succeed in promoting an  affection for the relics of antiquity that time has spared, our  labours will not have been in vain or the object of this book  unattained.    [Illustration: Paradise Square, Banbury]          CHAPTER II    THE DISAPPEARANCE OF ENGLAND      Under this alarming heading, \"The Disappearance of England,\" the  _Gaulois_ recently published an article by M. Guy Dorval on the  erosion of the English coasts. The writer refers to the predictions of  certain British men of science that England will one day disappear  altogether beneath the waves, and imagines that we British folk are  seized by a popular panic. Our neighbours are trembling for the fate  of the _entente cordiale_, which would speedily vanish with vanishing  England; but they have been assured by some of their savants that the  rate of erosion is only one kilometre in a thousand years, and that  the danger of total extinction is somewhat remote. Professor Stanislas  Meunier, however, declares that our \"panic\" is based on scientific  facts. He tells us that the cliffs of Brighton are now one kilometre  farther away from the French coast than in the days of Queen  Elizabeth, and that those of Kent are six kilometres farther away than  in the Roman period. He compares our island to a large piece of sugar  in water, but we may rest assured that before we disappear beneath the  waves the period which must elapse would be greater than the longest  civilizations known in history. So we may hope to be able to sing  \"Rule Britannia\" for many a long year.    Coast erosion is, however, a serious problem, and has caused the  destruction of many a fair town and noble forest that now lie beneath  the seas, and the crumbling cliffs on our eastern shore threaten to  destroy many a village church and smiling pasture. Fishermen tell you  that when storms rage and the waves swell they have heard the bells  chiming in the towers long covered by the seas, and nigh the  picturesque village of Bosham we were told of a stretch of sea that  was called the Park. This as late as the days of Henry VIII was a  favourite royal hunting forest, wherein stags and fawns and does  disported themselves; now fish are the only prey that can be slain  therein.    The Royal Commission on coast erosion relieves our minds somewhat by  assuring us that although the sea gains upon the land in many places,  the land gains upon the sea in others, and that the loss and gain are  more or less balanced. As a matter of area this is true. Most of the  land that has been rescued from the pitiless sea is below high-water  mark, and is protected by artificial banks. This work of reclaiming  land can, of course, only be accomplished in sheltered places, for  example, in the great flat bordering the Wash, which flat is formed by  the deposit of the rivers of the Fenland, and the seaward face of this  region is gradually being pushed forward by the careful processes of  enclosure. You can see the various old sea walls which have been  constructed from Roman times onward. Some accretions of land have  occurred where the sea piles up masses of shingle, unless foolish  people cart away the shingle in such quantities that the waves again  assert themselves. Sometimes sand silts up as at Southport in  Lancashire, where there is the second longest pier in England, a mile  in length, from the end of which it is said that on a clear day with a  powerful telescope you may perchance see the sea, that a distinguished  traveller accustomed to the deserts of Sahara once found it, and that  the name Southport is altogether a misnomer, as it is in the north and  there is no port at all.    But however much as an Englishman I might rejoice that the actual area  of \"our tight little island,\" which after all is not very tight,  should not be diminishing, it would be a poor consolation to me, if I  possessed land and houses on the coast of Norfolk which were fast  slipping into the sea, to know that in the Fenland industrious farmers  were adding to their acres. And day by day, year by year, this  destruction is going on, and the gradual melting away of land. The  attack is not always persistent. It is intermittent. Sometimes the  progress of the sea seems to be stayed, and then a violent storm  arises and falling cliffs and submerged houses proclaim the sway of  the relentless waves. We find that the greatest loss has occurred on  the east and southern coasts of our island. Great damage has been  wrought all along the Yorkshire sea-board from Bridlington to Kilnsea,  and the following districts have been the greatest sufferers: between  Cromer and Happisburgh, Norfolk; between Pakefield and Southwold,  Suffolk; Hampton and Herne Bay, and then St. Margaret's Bay, near  Dover; the coast of Sussex, east of Brighton, and the Isle of Wight;  the region of Bournemouth and Poole; Lyme Bay, Dorset, and Bridgwater  Bay, Somerset.    All along the coast from Yarmouth to Eastbourne, with a few  exceptional parts, we find that the sea is gaining on the land by  leaps and bounds. It is a coast that is most favourably constructed  for coast erosion. There are no hard or firm rocks, no cliffs high  enough to give rise to a respectable landslip; the soil is composed of  loose sand and gravels, loams and clays, nothing to resist the  assaults of atmospheric action from above or the sea below. At  Covehithe, on the Suffolk coast, there has been the greatest loss of  land. In 1887 sixty feet was claimed by the sea, and in ten years  (1878-87) the loss was at the rate of over eighteen feet a year. In  1895 another heavy loss occurred between Southwold and Covehithe and a  new cove formed. Easton Bavent has entirely disappeared, and so have  the once prosperous villages of Covehithe, Burgh-next-Walton, and  Newton-by-Corton, and the same fate seems to be awaiting Pakefield,  Southwold, and other coast-lying towns. Easton Bavent once had such a  flourishing fishery that it paid an annual rent of 3110 herrings; and  millions of herrings must have been caught by the fishermen of  disappeared Dunwich, which we shall visit presently, as they paid  annually \"fish-fare\" to the clergy of the town 15,377 herrings,  besides 70,000 to the royal treasury.    The summer visitors to the pleasant watering-place Felixstowe, named  after St. Felix, who converted the East Anglians to Christianity and  was their first bishop, that being the place where the monks of the  priory of St. Felix in Walton held their annual fair, seldom reflect  that the old Saxon burgh was carried away as long ago as 1100 A.D.  Hence Earl Bigot was compelled to retire inland and erect his famous  castle at Walton. But the sea respected not the proud walls of the  baron's stronghold; the strong masonry that girt the keep lies beneath  the waves; a heap of stones, called by the rustics Stone Works, alone  marks the site of this once powerful castle. Two centuries later the  baron's marsh was destroyed by the sea, and eighty acres of land was  lost, much to the regret of the monks, who were thus deprived of the  rent and tithe corn.    The old chroniclers record many dread visitations of the relentless  foe. Thus in 1237 we read: \"The sea burst with high tides and tempests  of winds, marsh countries near the sea were flooded, herds and flocks  perished, and no small number of men were lost and drowned. The sea  rose continually for two days and one night.\" Again in 1251: \"On  Christmas night there was a great thunder and lightning in Suffolk;  the sea caused heavy floods.\" In much later times Defoe records:  \"Aldeburgh has two streets, each near a mile long, but its breadth,  which was more considerable formerly, is not proportionable, and the  sea has of late years swallowed up one whole street.\" It has still  standing close to the shore its quaint picturesque town hall, erected  in the fifteenth century. Southwold is now practically an island,  bounded on the east by the sea, on the south-west by the Blyth River,  on the north-west by Buss Creek. It is only joined to the mainland by  a narrow neck of shingle that divides Buss Creek from the sea. I think  that I should prefer to hold property in a more secure region. You  invest your savings in stock, and dividends decrease and your capital  grows smaller, but you usually have something left. But when your land  and houses vanish entirely beneath the waves, the chapter is ended and  you have no further remedy except to sue Father Neptune, who has  rather a wide beat and may be difficult to find when he is wanted to  be served with a summons.    [Illustration: Norden's Chart of the River Ore and Suffolk Coast]    But the Suffolk coast does not show all loss. In the north much land  has been gained in the region of Beccles, which was at one time close  to the sea, and one of the finest spreads of shingle in England  extends from Aideburgh to Bawdry. This shingle has silted up many a  Suffolk port, but it has proved a very effectual barrier against the  inroads of the sea. Norden's map of the coast made in 1601[2] shows  this wonderful mass of shingle, which has greatly increased since  Norden's day. It has been growing in a southerly direction, until the  Aide River had until recently an estuary ten miles in length. But in  1907 the sea asserted itself, and \"burst through the stony barrier,  making a passage for the exit of the river one mile further north, and  leaving a vast stretch of shingle and two deserted river-channels as a  protection to the Marshes of Hollesley from further inroads of the  sea.\"[3] Formerly the River Alde flowed direct to the sea just south  of the town of Aldeburgh. Perhaps some day it may be able to again  force a passage near its ancient course or by Havergate Island. This  alteration in the course of rivers is very remarkable, and may be  observed at Christ Church, Hants."]]]
