You may very properly say to Mr. Smith \"I want you to meet Mrs. Jones,\"  but this is not a form of introduction, nor is it to be said in Mrs.  Jones' hearing. Upon leading Mr. Smith up to Mrs. Jones, you say \"Mrs.  Jones may I present Mr. Smith\" or \"Mrs. Jones; Mr. Smith.\" Under no  circumstances whatsoever say \"Mr. Smith meet Mrs. Jones,\" or \"Mrs. Jones  meet Mr. Smith.\" Either wording is equally preposterous.    Do not repeat \"Mrs. Jones? Mrs. Smith! Mrs. Smith? Mrs. Jones!\" To say  each name once is quite enough.    Most people of good taste very much dislike being asked their names. To  say \"What is your name?\" is always abrupt and unflattering. If you want to  know with whom you have been talking, you can generally find a third  person later and ask \"Who was the lady with the grey feather in her hat?\"  The next time you see her you can say \"How do you do, Mrs. ----\" (calling  her by name).      =WHEN TO SHAKE HANDS=    When gentlemen are introduced to each other they always shake hands.    When a gentleman is introduced to a lady, she sometimes puts out her  hand--especially if he is some one she has long heard about from friends  in common, but to an entire stranger she generally merely bows her head  slightly and says: \"How do you do!\" Strictly speaking, it is always her  place to offer her hand or not as she chooses, but if he puts out his  hand, it is rude on her part to ignore it. Nothing could be more ill-bred  than to treat curtly any overture made in spontaneous friendliness. No  thoroughbred lady would ever refuse to shake any hand that is honorable,  not even the hand of a coal heaver at the risk of her fresh white glove.    Those who have been drawn into a conversation do not usually shake hands  on parting. But there is no fixed rule. A lady sometimes shakes hands  after talking with a casual stranger; at other times she does not offer  her hand on parting from one who has been punctiliously presented to her.  She may find the former sympathetic and the latter very much the contrary.    Very few rules of etiquette are inelastic and none more so than the  acceptance or rejection of the strangers you meet.    There is a wide distance between rudeness and reserve. You can be  courteously polite and at the same time extremely aloof to a stranger who  does not appeal to you, or you can be welcomingly friendly to another whom  you like on sight. Individual temperament has also to be taken into  consideration: one person is naturally austere, another genial. The latter  shakes hands far more often than the former. As already said, it is  unforgivably rude to refuse a proffered hand, but it is rarely necessary  to offer your hand if you prefer not to.      =WHAT TO SAY WHEN INTRODUCED=    Best Society has only one phrase in acknowledgment of an introduction:  \"How do you do?\" It literally accepts no other. When Mr. Bachelor says,  \"Mrs. Worldly, may I present Mr. Struthers?\" Mrs. Worldly says, \"How do  you do?\" Struthers bows, and says nothing. To sweetly echo \"Mr.  Struthers?\" with a rising inflection on \"--thers?\" is not good form.  Saccharine chirpings should be classed with crooked little fingers, high  hand-shaking and other affectations. All affectations are bad form.    Persons of position do not say: \"Charmed,\" or \"Pleased to meet you,\" etc.,  but often the first remark is the beginning of a conversation. For  instance,    Young Struthers is presented to Mrs. Worldly. She smiles and perhaps says,  \"I hear that you are going to be in New York all winter?\" Struthers  answers, \"Yes, I am at the Columbia Law School,\" etc., or since he is much  younger than she, he might answer, \"Yes, Mrs. Worldly,\" especially if his  answer would otherwise be a curt yes or no. Otherwise he does not continue  repeating her name.    TAKING LEAVE OF ONE YOU HAVE JUST MET    After an introduction, when you have talked for some time to a stranger  whom you have found agreeable, and you then take leave, you say, \"Good-by,  I am very glad to have met you,\" or \"Good-by, I hope I shall see you again  soon\"--or \"some time.\" The other person answers, \"Thank you,\" or perhaps  adds, \"I hope so, too.\" Usually \"Thank you\" is all that is necessary.    In taking leave of a group of strangers--it makes no difference whether  you have been introduced to them or merely included in their  conversation--you bow \"good-by\" to any who happen to be looking at you,  but you do not attempt to attract the attention of those who are unaware  that you are turning away.      =INTRODUCING ONE PERSON TO A GROUP=    This is never done on formal occasions when a great many persons are  present. At a small luncheon, for instance, a hostess always introduces  her guests to one another.    Let us suppose you are the hostess: your position is not necessarily near,  but it is toward the door. Mrs. King is sitting quite close to you, Mrs.  Lawrence also near. Miss Robinson and Miss Brown are much farther away.    Mrs. Jones enters. You go a few steps forward and shake hands with her,  then stand aside as it were, for a second only, to see if Mrs. Jones goes  to speak to any one. If she apparently knows no one, you say,    \"Mrs. King, do you know Mrs. Jones?\" Mrs. King being close at hand  (usually but not necessarily) rises, shakes hands with Mrs. Jones and sits  down again. If Mrs. King is an elderly lady, and Mrs. Jones a young one,  Mrs. King merely extends her hand and does not rise. Having said \"Mrs.  Jones\" once, you do not repeat it immediately, but turning to the other  lady sitting near you, you say, \"Mrs. Lawrence,\" then you look across the  room and continue, \"Miss Robinson, Miss Brown--Mrs. Jones!\" Mrs. Lawrence,  if she is young, rises and shakes hands with Mrs. Jones, and the other two  bow but do not rise.    At a very big luncheon you would introduce Mrs. Jones to Mrs. King and  possibly to Mrs. Lawrence, so that Mrs. Jones might have some one to talk  to. But if other guests come in at this moment, Mrs. Jones finds a place  for herself and after a pause, falls naturally into conversation with  those she is next to, without giving her name or asking theirs.    A friend's roof is supposed to be an introduction to those it shelters. In  Best Society this is always recognized if the gathering is intimate, such  as at a luncheon, dinner or house party; but it is not accepted at a ball  or reception, or any \"general\" entertainment. People always talk to their  neighbors at table whether introduced or not. It would be a breach of  etiquette not to! But if Mrs. Jones and Mrs. Norman merely spoke to each  other for a few moments, in the drawing-room, it is not necessary that  they recognize each other afterwards.      =NEW YORK'S BAD MANNERS=    New York's bad manners are often condemned and often very deservedly. Even  though the cause is carelessness rather than intentional indifference, the  indifference is no less actual and the rudeness inexcusable.    It is by no means unheard of that after sitting at table next to the guest  of honor, a New Yorker will meet her the next day with utter  unrecognition. Not because the New Yorker means to \"cut\" the stranger or  feels the slightest unwillingness to continue the acquaintance, but  because few New Yorkers possess enthusiasm enough to make an effort to  remember all the new faces they come in contact with, but allow all those  who are not especially \"fixed\" in their attention, to drift easily out of  mind and recognition. It is mortifyingly true; no one is so ignorantly  indifferent to everything outside his or her own personal concern as the  socially fashionable New Yorker, unless it is the Londoner! The late  Theodore Roosevelt was a brilliantly shining exception. And, of course,  and happily, there are other men and women like him in this. But there are  also enough of the snail-in-shell variety to give color to the very just  resentment that those from other and more gracious cities hold against New  Yorkers.    Everywhere else in the world (except London), the impulse of  self-cultivation, if not the more generous ones of consideration and  hospitality, induces people of good breeding to try and make the effort to  find out what manner of mind, or experience, or talent, a stranger has;  and to remember, at least out of courtesy, anyone for whose benefit a  friend of theirs gave a dinner or luncheon. To fashionable New York,  however, luncheon was at one-thirty; at three there is something else  occupying the moment--that is all.    Nearly all people of the Atlantic Coast dislike general introductions, and  present people to each other as little as possible. In the West, however,  people do not feel comfortable in a room full of strangers. Whether or not  to introduce people therefore becomes not merely a question of propriety,  but of consideration for local custom.      =NEVER INTRODUCE UNNECESSARILY=    The question as to when introductions should be made, or not made, is one  of the most elusive points in the entire range of social knowledge.  \"Whenever necessary to bridge an awkward situation,\" is a definition that  is exact enough, but not very helpful or clear. The hostess who allows a  guest to stand, awkward and unknown, in the middle of her drawing-room is  no worse than she who pounces on every chance acquaintance and drags  unwilling victims into forced recognition of each other, everywhere and on  all occasions. The fundamental rule never to introduce unnecessarily  brings up the question:      =WHICH ARE THE NECESSARY OCCASIONS?=    First, in order of importance, is the presentation of everyone to guests  of honor, whether the \"guests\" are distinguished strangers for whom a  dinner is given, or a bride and groom, or a debutante being introduced to  society.

He skimmed through it quickly, and I  append a brief summary, only, for the benefit of more intelligent and  disinterested readers.    The Atlanteans were the oldest intelligent race in the world--they  existed contemporaneously with Paleolithic man, with whom their  mariners and explorers frequently came in contact, and about whom  their novelists wrote the most delightful stories, just as Fenimore  Cooper and Mayne Reid, in these days, have written the most delightful  stories about the Red Indians. In religion they were polytheists; they  believed that, in the work of Creation, many Powers participated; that  some of these Powers were benevolent, some malevolent, whilst  others--neither benevolent nor malevolent--were merely neutral. To the  benevolent creative Powers they attributed all that is beautiful in  the world (_i.e._ certain of the trees, plants, flowers, animals,  insects, and pleasing colours and scents); all that is fair and  agreeable in the human being, such as affection, love, kindness, the  arts and sciences--in a word all that in any degree affected the  welfare of mankind; and to the malevolent creative Powers they  attributed all that was noxious in creation; all that was harmful to  man, and detrimental to his moral and physical progress (_i.e._  diseases, and all savage and filthy passions); all races of low  intelligence, viz. Paleolithic and Neolithic man--and all those born  with black or red skins (those colours being particularly significant  of the malignant Occult Elements); all destructive animals; (_i.e._  reptiles such as the teleosaurus, steneosaurus, etc.; birds, such as  the ptereodactyl, vulture, eagle, etc.; mammals, such as the cave  lion, cave tiger, etc.; fish, such as the shark, octopus, etc.); and  all ugly and venomous insects.    These earliest records show that at one time the physical and  superphysical world were in close touch; all kinds of spirits--trolls,  pixies, nymphs, satyrs, imps, Vagrarians, Barrowvians, etc.--mixing  freely with living human beings; but that as the population increased  and civilization evolved, superphysical manifestations became more and  more rare, until finally they became restricted to certain conditions  dependent on time and locality.[10]    Up to this period there had been no state religion--no temples in  Atlantis. If any one wished for a particular favour from the Occult  Powers--for example, from the Rabses, the Occult Powers of music; the  Brakvos, the Occult Powers of medicine; or the Derinas, the Occult  Powers of love, they retired to some secluded spot and held direct  intercourse with these Powers. The idea of praying to an invisible  being--who might or might not hear them--never entered their minds;  they were far too matter of fact for that--and it was not until  superphysical manifestations had become confined to a very select few,  that the plan of erecting public buildings in spots frequented by the  spirits, so that all who wished could assemble there and communicate  with them, was proposed and put into operation. In these buildings,  however, the spirits did not choose always, to appear to  order--sometimes they quitted the spot where the edifice had been  erected; sometimes they would only appear there periodically; and  sometimes, out of perversity, they would appear when least expected.  But whether occult manifestations really took place in these buildings  or not, those assembled to see them were persuaded by those in charge  of the building, who saw thereby an opportunity of making money, that  the spirits were actually there; and in due time these buildings  became known as temples, and their showmen as priests. Every temple  was dedicated to an individual spirit--one to the Spirit Bara-boo;  another to the Spirit Karaboro, and so on; whilst in the absence of  genuine spirit manifestations, prayers, incantations and rituals,  invented by the priests, always attracted a large concourse of people  to these temples, and finally proved a greater source of attraction  than the spirits themselves.    It was to gain favours from the Occult Powers that donations from the  public were at first invited, then demanded; and the priests in this  manner accumulated vast fortunes. Later on, too, there sprang up, in  connection with these temples, colleges for the training of young  men--invariably selected from the wealthy classes--to the priesthood;  and from the parents of these youthful aspirants large fees, which in  course of time became exorbitant, were extracted, thereby furnishing  another source of revenue to the priests. The most famous colleges for  the training of priests in Atlantis were those of Bara-boo-rek[11] at  Keisionwo, Karaboro-rek at Diniangek, and Ballygarap-rek at Tijimin.    It was in the reign of Barrahneil,[12] fifty-first sovereign of the  Dynasty of Shaotak, that the evocation of spirits (from which modern  spiritualism takes its origin) commenced. Barrahneil was most eager to  see a superphysical manifestation. Being of a somewhat poetical turn  of mind he was particularly enamoured of fairies, and in the hope of  seeing one, constantly frequented their favourite haunts, _i.e._  woods, caves, and lonely isolated habitations. But all to no  purpose--they never would manifest themselves to him. At last, he lost  patience. Against the advice of his oldest and most trusty  counsellors, and accompanied by one or two of his favourite courtiers,  he went to an excessively lonely spot in the heart of a desert, and  besought spirits--spirits of any sort--he did not care what--to  manifest themselves. To his surprise--for he had grown extremely  sceptical--an Occult form, half man and half beast,[13] materialized.  It informed them that it was Daramara, _i.e._ in Atlantis, the  Unknown--that it had no beginning and no end, and that it would remain  an impenetrable mystery to them during their existence in the physical  sphere, but would be fully revealed to them when they passed over into  Malanok--one of the superphysical planes. On this, and on several  subsequent occasions, when it manifested itself to them, it gave them  instructions with regard to evocation, and described to them the tests  they must undergo before they could acquire the great powers the  Unknown was able to bestow on them, namely, (1) second sight; (2)  divining other people's thoughts and detecting the presence of waters  and metals; (3) thought transference, _i.e._ being able to transmit  messages, irrespective of distance, from one brain to another without  any physical medium; (4) hypnotism; (5) the power to hold converse  with animals; (6) invisibility, _i.e._ dematerializing at will; (7)  walking on, and breathing under, water; (8) inflicting all manner of  diseases and torments; (9) curing all kinds of diseases; (10)  converting people into beasts and minerals; (11) foretelling the  future by palmistry, pyromancy, hydromancy, astrology, etc.; (12)  conjuring up all manner of spirits antagonistic to men's moral  progress, _i.e._ Vice Elementals--Vagrarians, Barrowvians, etc.    Taking every care to observe the greatest secrecy, Barrahneil caused a  full account of these interviews with Daramara, together with all the  instructions the latter had given him, to be transcribed in a book,  which he called _Brahnapotek_[14]--or the _Book of Mysteries_; and  which he kept sealed and guarded in a room in his palace.    During his lifetime no one held communication with Daramara saving  himself and his friends, but after his death the secret of black magic  leaked out; countless people sought to acquire it, and ultimately the  practice of it became universal. But the Atlanteans little knew the  danger they were incurring. The spirits they conjured up--though at  first subservient, that is to say, mere instruments--at length  obtained complete dominion over them--the whole race became steeped in  crime and vice of every kind--and so horrible were the enormities  perpetrated that, fearful lest Man should be entirely obliterated the  benevolent Occult Powers, after a desperate struggle with the  malevolent Occult Powers, succeeded, by means of a vast earthquake, in  submerging the Continent and hurling it to the bottom of the Atlantic  Ocean, where, what remains of it, now lies. This catastrophe took  place in the reign of Aboonirin, twentieth sovereign of the Dynasty of  Molonekin--three thousand years after the reign of Barrahneil.    So ran the history of Atlantis, or at least all of it that need be  quoted for the elucidation of this story. That Black Magic--the Black  Art of the Atlanteans was by no means dead--Hamar felt convinced, and  if Maitland could resuscitate it--why could not he? At any rate he  might try. He could lose nothing by giving it a trial--at least  nothing to speak of--the outlay on chemicals would be a mere  song--whereas, on the other hand, what might he not gain! He eagerly  perused the tests--the test he must impose upon himself before he  could get in touch with the Unknown, and acquire the magic  powers--which, according to Thomas Maitland, were copied from the  original Brahnapotek, and including a preface, ran as follows:  (_Preface_) \"It is essential that the person desirous of being  initiated into the Black Art--the Art of communicating with the  Unknown (Daramara) in order to acquire certain great powers, should  dismiss from his mind all ideas of moral progress, and wholly  concentrate on the bettering of his material self--on acquiring riches  and fame in the physical sphere. His aspirations must be entirely  earthly, and all his affections subordinate to his main desire for  wealth and carnal pleasures. Having acquired this preliminary  psychological stage, for one clear week he must give himself up  entirely to the breaking of all the conventionalities of morality with  which society is hedged in. He must practice every kind of  deception--lie, cheat and steal, and go out of"]]]
