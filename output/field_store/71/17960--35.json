The impulse of genius  is to guard the secrets of its creative hour. Glimpses obtained of the  toil, the baffled experiments, which precede a triumph, as in the  sketch-work of Hawthorne recently brought to light, afford priceless  instruction and encouragement to the sincere artist. But one who  voluntarily exposes his Muse to the gaze of all comers should recall the  fate of King Candaules.    The world still thinks of Poe as a \"luckless man of genius.\" I recently  heard him mentioned as \"one whom everybody seems chartered to misrepresent,  decry or slander.\" But it seems to me that his ill-luck ended with his  pitiable death, and that since then his defence has been persistent, and  his fame of as steadfast growth as a suffering and gifted author could pray  for in his hopeful hour. Griswold's decrial and slander turned the current  in his favor. Critics and biographers have come forward with successive  refutations, with tributes to his character, with new editions of his  works. His own letters and the minute incidents of his career are before  us; the record, good and bad, is widely known. No appellor has received  more tender and forgiving judgement. His mishaps in life belonged to his  region and period, perchance still more to his own infirmity of will.  Doubtless his environment was not one to guard a fine-grained, ill-balanced  nature from perils without and within. His strongest will, to be lord of  himself, gained for him \"that heritage of woe.\" He confessed himself the  bird's unhappy master, the stricken sufferer of this poem. But his was a  full share of that dramatic temper which exults in the presage of its own  doom. There is a delight in playing one's high part: we are all gladiators,  crying _Ave Imperator!_ To quote Burke's matter of fact: \"In grief the  pleasure is still uppermost, and the affliction we suffer has no  resemblance to absolute pain, which is always odious, and which we endeavor  to shake off as soon as possible.\" Poe went farther, and was an artist even  in the tragedy of his career. If, according to his own belief, sadness and  the vanishing of beauty are the highest poetic themes, and poetic feeling  the keenest earthly pleasure, then the sorrow and darkness of his broken  life were not without their frequent compensation.    In the following pages, we have a fresh example of an artist's genius  characterizing his interpretation of a famous poem. Gustave Dore, the last  work of whose pencil is before us, was not the painter, or even the  draughtsman, for realists demanding truth of tone, figure, and perfection.  Such matters concerned him less than to make shape and distance, light and  shade, assist his purpose,--which was to excite the soul, the imagination,  of the looker on. This he did by arousing our sense of awe, through  marvellous and often sublime conceptions of things unutterable and full of  gloom or glory. It is well said that if his works were not great paintings,  as pictures they are great indeed. As a \"literary artist,\" and such he was,  his force was in direct ratio with the dramatic invention of his author,  with the brave audacities of the spirit that kindled his own. Hence his  success with Rabelais, with \"Le Juif-Errant,\" \"Les Contes Drolatiques,\" and  \"Don Quixote,\" and hence, conversely, his failure to express the beauty of  Tennyson's Idyls, of \"Il Paradiso,\" of the Hebrew pastorals, and other  texts requiring exaltation, or sweetness and repose. He was a born master  of the grotesque, and by a special insight could portray the spectres of a  haunted brain. We see objects as his personages saw them, and with the very  eyes of the Wandering Jew, the bewildered Don, or the goldsmith's daughter  whose fancy so magnifies the King in the shop on the Pont-au-Change. It was  in the nature of things that he should be attracted to each masterpiece of  verse or prose that I have termed unique. The lower kingdoms were called  into his service; his rocks, trees and mountains, the sky itself, are  animate with motive and diablerie. Had he lived to illustrate Shakespeare,  we should have seen a remarkable treatment of Caliban, the Witches, the  storm in \"Lear\"; but doubtless should have questioned his ideals of Imogen  or Miranda. Beauty pure and simple, and the perfect excellence thereof, he  rarely seemed to comprehend.    Yet there is beauty in his designs for the \"Ancient Mariner,\" unreal as  they are, and a consecutiveness rare in a series by Dore. The Rime afforded  him a prolonged story, with many shiftings of the scene. In _The Raven_  sound and color preserve their monotone and we have no change of place or  occasion. What is the result? Dore proffers a series of variations upon the  theme as he conceived it, \"the enigma of death and the hallucination of an  inconsolable soul.\" In some of these drawings his faults are evident;  others reveal his powerful originality, and the best qualities in which, as  a draughtsman, he stood alone. Plainly there was something in common  between the working moods of Poe and Dore. This would appear more clearly  had the latter tried his hand upon the \"Tales of the Grotesque and  Arabesque.\" Both resorted often to the elf-land of fantasy and romance. In  melodramatic feats they both, through their command of the supernatural,  avoided the danger-line between the ideal and the absurd. Poe was the truer  worshipper of the Beautiful; his love for it was a consecrating passion,  and herein he parts company with his illustrator. Poet or artist, Death at  last transfigures all: within the shadow of his sable harbinger, Vedder's  symbolic crayon aptly sets them face to face, but enfolds them with the  mantle of immortal wisdom and power. An American woman has wrought the  image of a star-eyed Genius with the final torch, the exquisite semblance  of one whose vision beholds, but whose lips may not utter, the mysteries of  a land beyond \"the door of a legended tomb.\"    EDMUND C. STEDMAN.          THE POEM.          [Illustration]          THE RAVEN.      Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,  Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,  While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,  As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.  \"'T is some visiter,\" I muttered, \"tapping at my chamber door--                                            Only this, and nothing more.\"    Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,  And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.  Eagerly I wished the morrow:--vainly I had sought to borrow  From my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore--  For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore--                                            Nameless here for evermore.    And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain  Thrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;  So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating  \"'T is some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door  Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door;--                                            This it is, and nothing more.\"    Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,  \"Sir,\" said I, \"or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;  But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,  And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,  That I scarce was sure I heard you\"--here I opened wide the door;--                                            Darkness there, and nothing more.    Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,  Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;  But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,  And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, \"Lenore!\"  This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, \"Lenore!\"                                            Merely this and nothing more.    Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,  Soon again I heard a tapping, somewhat louder than before.  \"Surely,\" said I, \"surely that is something at my window lattice;  Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore--  Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;--                                            'T is the wind and nothing more!\"    Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,  In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.  Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;  But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door--  Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door--                                            Perched, and sat, and nothing more.    Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,  By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,  \"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,\" I said, \"art sure no craven,  Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore,--  Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!\"                                            Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"    Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,  Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;  For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being  Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door--  Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,                                            With such name as \"Nevermore.\"    But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only  That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.  Nothing further then he uttered--not a feather then he fluttered--  Till I scarcely more than muttered, \"Other friends have flown before--"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/172"],[0,"The Haunted Bookshop (#4)"],[1,"suicide.    \"One thing, however, you must grant the good bookseller.  He is  tolerant.  He is patient of all ideas and theories.  Surrounded,  engulfed by the torrent of men's words, he is willing to listen to them  all.  Even to the publisher's salesman he turns an indulgent ear.  He  is willing to be humbugged for the weal of humanity.  He hopes  unceasingly for good books to be born.    \"My business, you see, is different from most.  I only deal in  second-hand books; I only buy books that I consider have some honest  reason for existence.  In so far as human judgment can discern, I try  to keep trash out of my shelves.  A doctor doesn't traffic in quack  remedies.  I don't traffic in bogus books.    \"A comical thing happened the other day.  There is a certain wealthy  man, a Mr. Chapman, who has long frequented this shop----\"    \"I wonder if that could be Mr. Chapman of the Chapman Daintybits  Company?\" said Gilbert, feeling his feet touch familiar soil.    \"The same, I believe,\" said Mifflin.  \"Do you know him?\"    \"Ah,\" cried the young man with reverence.  \"There is a man who can tell  you the virtues of advertising.  If he is interested in books, it is  advertising that made it possible.  We handle all his copy--I've  written a lot of it myself.  We have made the Chapman prunes a staple  of civilization and culture.  I myself devised that slogan 'We preen  ourselves on our prunes' which you see in every big magazine.  Chapman  prunes are known the world over.  The Mikado eats them once a week.  The Pope eats them.  Why, we have just heard that thirteen cases of  them are to be put on board the George Washington for the President's  voyage to the peace Conference.  The Czecho-Slovak armies were fed  largely on prunes.  It is our conviction in the office that our  campaign for the Chapman prunes did much to win the war.\"    \"I read in an ad the other day--perhaps you wrote that, too?\" said the  bookseller, \"that the Elgin watch had won the war.  However, Mr.  Chapman has long been one of my best customers.  He heard about the  Corn Cob Club, and though of course he is not a bookseller he begged to  come to our meetings.  We were glad to have him do so, and he has  entered into our discussions with great zeal.  Often he has offered  many a shrewd comment.  He has grown so enthusiastic about the  bookseller's way of life that the other day he wrote to me about his  daughter (he is a widower).  She has been attending a fashionable  girls' school where, he says, they have filled her head with absurd,  wasteful, snobbish notions.  He says she has no more idea of the  usefulness and beauty of life than a Pomeranian dog.  Instead of  sending her to college, he has asked me if Mrs. Mifflin and I will take  her in here to learn to sell books.  He wants her to think she is  earning her keep, and is going to pay me privately for the privilege of  having her live here.  He thinks that being surrounded by books will  put some sense in her head.  I am rather nervous about the experiment,  but it is a compliment to the shop, isn't it?\"    \"Ye gods,\" cried Gilbert, \"what advertising copy that would make!\"    At this point the bell in the shop rang, and Mifflin jumped up.  \"This  part of the evening is often rather busy,\" he said.  \"I'm afraid I'll  have to go down on the floor.  Some of my habitues rather expect me to  be on hand to gossip about books.\"    \"I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed myself,\" said Gilbert.  \"I'm  going to come again and study your shelves.\"    \"Well, keep it dark about the young lady,\" said the bookseller.  \"I  don't want all you young blades dropping in here to unsettle her mind.  If she falls in love with anybody in this shop, it'll have to be Joseph  Conrad or John Keats!\"    As he passed out, Gilbert saw Roger Mifflin engaged in argument with a  bearded man who looked like a college professor.  \"Carlyle's Oliver  Cromwell?\" he was saying.  \"Yes, indeed!  Right over here!  Hullo,  that's odd!  It WAS here.\"        Chapter II    The Corn Cob Club[1]      [1] The latter half of this chapter may be omitted by all readers who  are not booksellers.      The Haunted Bookshop was a delightful place, especially of an evening,  when its drowsy alcoves were kindled with the brightness of lamps  shining on the rows of volumes.  Many a passer-by would stumble down  the steps from the street in sheer curiosity; others, familiar  visitors, dropped in with the same comfortable emotion that a man feels  on entering his club.  Roger's custom was to sit at his desk in the  rear, puffing his pipe and reading; though if any customer started a  conversation, the little man was quick and eager to carry it on.  The  lion of talk lay only sleeping in him; it was not hard to goad it up.    It may be remarked that all bookshops that are open in the evening are  busy in the after-supper hours.  Is it that the true book-lovers are  nocturnal gentry, only venturing forth when darkness and silence and  the gleam of hooded lights irresistibly suggest reading?  Certainly  night-time has a mystic affinity for literature, and it is strange that  the Esquimaux have created no great books.  Surely, for most of us, an  arctic night would be insupportable without O. Henry and Stevenson.  Or, as Roger Mifflin remarked during a passing enthusiasm for Ambrose  Bierce, the true noctes ambrosianae are the noctes ambrose bierceianae.    But Roger was prompt in closing Parnassus at ten o'clock.  At that hour  he and Bock (the mustard-coloured terrier, named for Boccaccio) would  make the round of the shop, see that everything was shipshape, empty  the ash trays provided for customers, lock the front door, and turn off  the lights.  Then they would retire to the den, where Mrs. Mifflin was  generally knitting or reading.  She would brew a pot of cocoa and they  would read or talk for half an hour or so before bed.  Sometimes Roger  would take a stroll along Gissing Street before turning in.  All day  spent with books has a rather exhausting effect on the mind, and he  used to enjoy the fresh air sweeping up the dark Brooklyn streets,  meditating some thought that had sprung from his reading, while Bock  sniffed and padded along in the manner of an elderly dog at night.    While Mrs. Mifflin was away, however, Roger's routine was somewhat  different.  After closing the shop he would return to his desk and with  a furtive, shamefaced air take out from a bottom drawer an untidy  folder of notes and manuscript.  This was the skeleton in his closet,  his secret sin.  It was the scaffolding of his book, which he had been  compiling for at least ten years, and to which he had tentatively  assigned such different titles as \"Notes on Literature,\" \"The Muse on  Crutches,\" \"Books and I,\" and \"What a Young Bookseller Ought to Know.\"  It had begun long ago, in the days of his odyssey as a rural book  huckster, under the title of \"Literature Among the Farmers,\" but it had  branched out until it began to appear that (in bulk at least) Ridpath  would have to look to his linoleum laurels.  The manuscript in its  present state had neither beginning nor end, but it was growing  strenuously in the middle, and hundreds of pages were covered with  Roger's minute script.  The chapter on \"Ars Bibliopolae,\" or the art of  bookselling, would be, he hoped, a classic among generations of book  vendors still unborn.  Seated at his disorderly desk, caressed by a  counterpane of drifting tobacco haze, he would pore over the  manuscript, crossing out, interpolating, re-arguing, and then referring  to volumes on his shelves.  Bock would snore under the chair, and soon  Roger's brain would begin to waver.  In the end he would fall asleep  over his papers, wake with a cramp about two o'clock, and creak  irritably to a lonely bed.    All this we mention only to explain how it was that Roger was dozing at  his desk about midnight, the evening after the call paid by Aubrey  Gilbert.  He was awakened by a draught of chill air passing like a  mountain brook over his bald pate.  Stiffly he sat up and looked about.  The shop was in darkness save for the bright electric over his head.  Bock, of more regular habit than his master, had gone back to his couch  in the kitchen, made of a packing case that had once coffined a set of  the Encyclopaedia Britannica.    \"That's funny,\" said Roger to himself.  \"Surely I locked the door?\" He  walked to the front of the shop, switching on the cluster of lights  that hung from the ceiling.  The door was ajar, but everything else  seemed as usual.  Bock, hearing his footsteps, came trotting out from  the kitchen, his claws rattling on the bare wooden floor.  He looked up  with the patient inquiry of a dog accustomed to the eccentricities of  his patron.    \"I guess I'm getting absent-minded,\" said Roger.  \"I must have left the  door open.\"  He closed and locked it.  Then he noticed that the terrier  was sniffing in the History alcove, which was at the front of the shop  on the left-hand side.    \"What is it, old man?\" said Roger.  \"Want something to read in bed?\" He  turned on the light in that alcove.  Everything appeared normal.  Then  he noticed a book that projected an inch or so beyond the even line of  bindings.  It was a fad of Roger's to keep all his books in a flat row  on the shelves, and almost every evening at closing time he used to run  his palm along the backs of the volumes to level any irregularities  left by careless browsers.  He put out a hand to push the book into  place.  Then he stopped.    \"Queer again,\" he thought.  \"Carlyle's Oliver Cromwell!  I looked for  that book last night and couldn't find it.  When that professor fellow  was here.  Maybe I'm tired and can't see straight.  I'll go to bed.\"      The next day was a date of some moment.  Not only was it Thanksgiving  Day, with the November meeting of the Corn Cob Club scheduled for that  evening, but Mrs. Mifflin had promised to get home from Boston in "]]]
