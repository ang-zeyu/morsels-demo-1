[20] All later works are founded on these three, so far as concerns  the conversion of Ceylon and the immediately subsequent period,  and the three works appear to be rearrangements of a single source known as  the Atthakatha, Sihalatthakatha, or the words of the Porana (ancients).  These names were given to commentaries on the Tipitaka written in Sinhalese  prose interspersed with Pali verse and several of the greater monasteries  had their own editions of them, including a definite historical  section.[21] It is probable that at the beginning of the fifth century A.D.  and perhaps in the fourth century the old Sinhalese in which the prose  parts of the Atthakatha were written was growing unintelligible, and that  it was becoming more and more the fashion to use Pali as the language of  ecclesiastical literature, for at least three writers set themselves to  turn part of the traditions not into the vernacular but into Pali. The  earliest and least artistic is the unknown author of the short chronicle  called Dipavamsa, who wrote between 302 A.D. and 430 A.D.[22] His work is  weak both as a specimen of Pali and as a narrative and he probably did  little but patch together the Pali verses occurring from time to time in  the Sinhalese prose of the Atthakatha. Somewhat later, towards the end of  the fifth century, a certain Mahanama arranged the materials out of which  the Dipavamsa had been formed in a more consecutive and artistic form,  combining ecclesiastical and popular legends.[23] His work, known as the  Mahavamsa, does not end with the reign of Elara, like the Dipavamsa, but  describes in 15 more chapters the exploits of Dutthagamani and his  successors ending with Mahasena.[24] The third writer, Buddhaghosa,  apparently lived between the authors of the two chronicles. His voluminous  literary activity will demand our attention later but so far as history is  concerned his narrative is closely parallel to the Mahavamsa.[25]    The historical narrative is similar in all three works. After the  Council of Pataliputra, Moggaliputta, who had presided over it, came  to the conclusion that the time had come to despatch missionaries to  convert foreign countries. Sinhalese tradition represents this  decision as emanating from Moggaliputta whereas the inscriptions of  Asoka imply that the king himself initiated the momentous project. But  the difference is small. We cannot now tell to whom the great idea  first occurred but it must have been carried out by the clergy with  the assistance of Asoka, the apostle selected for Ceylon was his[26]  near relative Mahinda who according to the traditions of the  Sinhalese made his way to their island through the air with six  companions. The account of Hsuan Chuang hints at a less miraculous  mode of progression for he speaks of a monastery built by Mahinda  somewhere near Tanjore.    The legend tells how Mahinda and his following alighted on the Missaka  mountain[27] whither King Devanampiya Tissa had gone in the course of  a hunt. The monks and the royal cortege met: Mahinda, after testing  the king's intellectual capacity by some curious dialectical puzzles,  had no difficulty in converting him.[28] Next morning he proceeded to  Anuradhapura and was received with all honour and enthusiasm. He  preached first in the palace and then to enthusiastic audiences of the  general public. In these discourses he dwelt chiefly on the terrible  punishment awaiting sinners in future existences.[29]    We need not follow in detail the picturesque account of the rapid  conversion of the capital. The king made over to the Church the  Mahamegha garden and proceeded to construct a series of religious  edifices in Anuradhapura and its neighbourhood. The catalogue of them  is given in the Mahavamsa[30] and the most important was the  Mahavihara monastery, which became specially famous and influential in  the history of Buddhism. It was situated in the Mahamegha garden close  to the Bo-tree and was regarded as the citadel of orthodoxy. Its  subsequent conflicts with the later Abhayagiri monastery are the chief  theme of Sinhalese ecclesiastical history and our version of the Pali  Pitakas is the one which received its imprimatur.    Tissa is represented as having sent two further missions to India. The  first went in quest of relics and made its way not only to Pataliputra  but to the court of Indra, king of the gods, and the relics obtained,  of which the principal was the Buddha's alms-bowl,[31] were deposited  in Anuradhapura. The king then built the Thuparama dagoba over them  and there is no reason to doubt that the building which now bears  this name is genuine. The story may therefore be true to the extent  that relics were brought from India at this early period.    The second mission was despatched to bring a branch of the tree[32]  under which the Buddha had sat when he obtained enlightenment. This  narrative[33] is perhaps based on a more solid substratum of fact. The  chronicles connect the event with the desire of the Princess Anula to  become a nun. Women could receive ordination only from ordained nuns  and as these were not to be found on the island it was decided to ask  Asoka to send a branch of the sacred tree and also Mahinda's sister  Sanghamitta, a religieuse of eminence. The mission was successful. A  branch from the Bo-tree was detached, conveyed by Asoka to the coast  with much ceremony and received in Ceylon by Tissa with equal respect.  The princess accompanied it. The Bo-tree was planted in the Meghavana  garden. It may still be seen and attracts pilgrims not only from  Ceylon but from Burma and Siam. Unlike the buildings of Anuradhapura  it has never been entirely neglected and it is clear that it has been  venerated as the Bo-tree from an early period of Sinhalese history.  Botanists consider its long life, though remarkable, not impossible  since trees of this species throw up fresh shoots from the roots near  the parent stem. The sculptures at Sanchi represent a branch of a  sacred tree being carried in procession, though no inscription attests  its destination, and Fa-Hsien says that he saw the tree.[34] The  author of the first part of the Mahavamsa clearly regards it as  already ancient, and throughout the history of Ceylon there are  references to the construction of railings and terraces to protect it.      Devanampiya Tissa probably died in 207 B.C. In 177 the kingdom passed  into the hands of Tamil monarchs who were not Buddhists, although the  chroniclers praise their justice and the respect which they showed to  the Church. The most important of them, Elara, reigned for  forty-four years and was dethroned by a descendant of Tissa, called  Dutthagamani.[35]    The exploits of this prince are recorded at such length in the  Mahavamsa (XXII.-XXXII.) as to suggest that they formed the subject of  a separate popular epic, in which he figured as the champion of  Sinhalese against the Tamils, and therefore as a devout Buddhist. On  ascending the throne he felt, like Asoka, remorse for the bloodshed  which had attended his early life and strove to atone for it by good  works, especially the construction of sacred edifices. The most  important of these were the Lohapasada or Copper Palace and the  Mahathupa or Ruwanweli Dagoba. The former[36] was a monastery roofed  or covered with copper plates. Its numerous rooms were richly  decorated and it consisted of nine storeys, of which the four  uppermost were set apart for Arhats, and the lower assigned to the  inferior grades of monks. Perhaps the nine storeys are an  exaggeration: at any rate the building suffered from fire and  underwent numerous reconstructions and modifications. King Mahasena  (301 A.D.) destroyed it and then repenting of his errors rebuilt it,  but the ruins now representing it at Anuradhapura, which consist of  stone pillars only, date from the reign of Parakrama Bahu I (about  A.D. 1150). The immense pile known as the Ruwanweli Dagoba, though  often injured by invaders in search of treasure, still exists. The  somewhat dilapidated exterior is merely an outer shell, enclosing a  smaller dagoba.[37] This is possibly the structure erected by  Dutthagamani, though tradition says that there is a still  smaller edifice inside. The foundation and building of the original  structure are related at great length.[38] Crowds of distinguished  monks came to see the first stone laid, even from Kashmir and  Alasanda. Some have identified the latter name with Alexandria in  Egypt, but it probably denotes a Greek city on the Indus.[39] But in  any case tradition represents Buddhists from all parts of India as  taking part in the ceremony and thus recognizing the unity of Indian  and Sinhalese Buddhism.    Of great importance for the history of the Sinhalese Church is the reign  of Vattagamani Abhaya who after being dethroned by Tamils recovered his  kingdom and reigned for twelve years.[40] He built a new monastery and  dagoba known as Abhayagiri,[41] which soon became the enemy of the  Mahavihara and heterodox, if the latter is to be considered orthodox. The  account of the schism given in the Mahavamsa[42] is obscure, but the  dispute resulted in the Pitakas, which had hitherto been preserved orally,  being committed to writing. The council which defined and edited the  scriptures was not attended by all the monasteries of Ceylon, but only by  the monks of the Mahavihara, and the text which they wrote down was their  special version and not universally accepted. It included the Parivara,  which was apparently a recent manual composed in Ceylon. The Mahavamsa says  no more about this schism, but the Nikaya-Sangrahawa[43] says that the  monks of the Abhayagiri monastery now embraced the doctrines of the  Vajjiputta school (one of the seventeen branches of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1685"],[0,"The Mystery of the Yellow Room (#4)"],[1,"\"Yes,\" he replied; \"I think if he isn't a man in society, he is, at  least, a man belonging to the upper class. But that, again, is only an  impression.\"    \"What has led you to form it?\"    \"Well,--the greasy cap, the common handkerchief, and the marks of the  rough boots on the floor,\" he replied.    \"I understand,\" I said; \"murderers don't leave traces behind them which  tell the truth.\"    \"We shall make something out of you yet, my dear Sainclair,\" concluded  Rouletabille.          CHAPTER III. \"A Man Has Passed Like a Shadow Through the Blinds\"      Half an hour later Rouletabille and I were on the platform of the  Orleans station, awaiting the departure of the train which was to take  us to Epinay-sur-Orge.    On the platform we found Monsieur de Marquet and his Registrar, who  represented the Judicial Court of Corbeil. Monsieur Marquet had spent  the night in Paris, attending the final rehearsal, at the Scala, of a  little play of which he was the unknown author, signing himself simply  \"Castigat Ridendo.\"    Monsieur de Marquet was beginning to be a \"noble old gentleman.\"  Generally he was extremely polite and full of gay humour, and in all  his life had had but one passion,--that of dramatic art. Throughout  his magisterial career he was interested solely in cases capable of  furnishing him with something in the nature of a drama. Though he might  very well have aspired to the highest judicial positions, he had  never really worked for anything but to win a success at the romantic  Porte-Saint-Martin, or at the sombre Odeon.    Because of the mystery which shrouded it, the case of The Yellow  Room was certain to fascinate so theatrical a mind. It interested him  enormously, and he threw himself into it, less as a magistrate eager  to know the truth, than as an amateur of dramatic embroglios, tending  wholly to mystery and intrigue, who dreads nothing so much as the  explanatory final act.    So that, at the moment of meeting him, I heard Monsieur de Marquet say  to the Registrar with a sigh:    \"I hope, my dear Monsieur Maleine, this builder with his pickaxe will  not destroy so fine a mystery.\"    \"Have no fear,\" replied Monsieur Maleine, \"his pickaxe may demolish the  pavilion, perhaps, but it will leave our case intact. I have sounded the  walls and examined the ceiling and floor and I know all about it. I am  not to be deceived.\"    Having thus reassured his chief, Monsieur Maleine, with a discreet  movement of the head, drew Monsieur de Marquet's attention to us. The  face of that gentleman clouded, and, as he saw Rouletabille approaching,  hat in hand, he sprang into one of the empty carriages saying, half  aloud to his Registrar, as he did so, \"Above all, no journalists!\"    Monsieur Maleine replied in the same tone, \"I understand!\" and then  tried to prevent Rouletabille from entering the same compartment with  the examining magistrate.    \"Excuse me, gentlemen,--this compartment is reserved.\"    \"I am a journalist, Monsieur, engaged on the 'Epoque,'\" said my young  friend with a great show of gesture and politeness, \"and I have a word  or two to say to Monsieur de Marquet.\"    \"Monsieur is very much engaged with the inquiry he has in hand.\"    \"Ah! his inquiry, pray believe me, is absolutely a matter of  indifference to me. I am no scavenger of odds and ends,\" he went on,  with infinite contempt in his lower lip, \"I am a theatrical reporter;  and this evening I shall have to give a little account of the play at  the Scala.\"    \"Get in, sir, please,\" said the Registrar.    Rouletabille was already in the compartment. I went in after him  and seated myself by his side. The Registrar followed and closed the  carriage door.    Monsieur de Marquet looked at him.    \"Ah, sir,\" Rouletabille began, \"You must not be angry with Monsieur de  Maleine. It is not with Monsieur de Marquet that I desire to have the  honour of speaking, but with Monsieur 'Castigat Ridendo.' Permit me to  congratulate you--personally, as well as the writer for the 'Epoque.'\"  And Rouletabille, having first introduced me, introduced himself.    Monsieur de Marquet, with a nervous gesture, caressed his beard into a  point, and explained to Rouletabille, in a few words, that he was too  modest an author to desire that the veil of his pseudonym should be  publicly raised, and that he hoped the enthusiasm of the journalist for  the dramatist's work would not lead him to tell the public that Monsieur  \"Castigat Ridendo\" and the examining magistrate of Corbeil were one and  the same person.    \"The work of the dramatic author may interfere,\" he said, after a slight  hesitation, \"with that of the magistrate, especially in a province where  one's labours are little more than routine.\"    \"Oh, you may rely on my discretion!\" cried Rouletabille.    The train was in motion.    \"We have started!\" said the examining magistrate, surprised at seeing us  still in the carriage.    \"Yes, Monsieur,--truth has started,\" said Rouletabile, smiling  amiably,--\"on its way to the Chateau du Glandier. A fine case, Monsieur  de Marquet,--a fine case!\"    \"An obscure--incredible, unfathomable, inexplicable affair--and there is  only one thing I fear, Monsieur Rouletabille,--that the journalists will  be trying to explain it.\"    My friend felt this a rap on his knuckles.    \"Yes,\" he said simply, \"that is to be feared. They meddle in everything.  As for my interest, monsieur, I only referred to it by mere chance,--the  mere chance of finding myself in the same train with you, and in the  same compartment of the same carriage.\"    \"Where are you going, then?\" asked Monsieur de Marquet.    \"To the Chateau du Glandier,\" replied Rouletabille, without turning.    \"You'll not get in, Monsieur Rouletabille!\"    \"Will you prevent me?\" said my friend, already prepared to fight.    \"Not I!--I like the press and journalists too well to be in any way  disagreeable to them; but Monsieur Stangerson has given orders for  his door to be closed against everybody, and it is well guarded. Not a  journalist was able to pass through the gate of the Glandier yesterday.\"    Monsieur de Marquet compressed his lips and seemed ready to relapse into  obstinate silence. He only relaxed a little when Rouletabille no longer  left him in ignorance of the fact that we were going to the Glandier for  the purpose of shaking hands with an \"old and intimate friend,\" Monsieur  Robert Darzac--a man whom Rouletabille had perhaps seen once in his  life.    \"Poor Robert!\" continued the young reporter, \"this dreadful affair may  be his death,--he is so deeply in love with Mademoiselle Stangerson.\"    \"His sufferings are truly painful to witness,\" escaped like a regret  from the lips of Monsieur de Marquet.    \"But it is to be hoped that Mademoiselle Stangerson's life will be  saved.\"    \"Let us hope so. Her father told me yesterday that, if she does not  recover, it will not be long before he joins her in the grave. What an  incalculable loss to science his death would be!\"    \"The wound on her temple is serious, is it not?\"    \"Evidently; but, by a wonderful chance, it has not proved mortal. The  blow was given with great force.\"    \"Then it was not with the revolver she was wounded,\" said Rouletabille,  glancing at me in triumph.    Monsieur de Marquet appeared greatly embarrassed.    \"I didn't say anything--I don't want to say anything--I will not say  anything,\" he said. And he turned towards his Registrar as if he no  longer knew us.    But Rouletabille was not to be so easily shaken off. He moved nearer  to the examining magistrate and, drawing a copy of the \"Matin\" from his  pocket, he showed it to him and said:    \"There is one thing, Monsieur, which I may enquire of you without  committing an indiscretion. You have, of course, seen the account given  in the 'Matin'? It is absurd, is it not?\"    \"Not in the slightest, Monsieur.\"    \"What! The Yellow Room has but one barred window--the bars of which have  not been moved--and only one door, which had to be broken open--and the  assassin was not found!\"    \"That's so, monsieur,--that's so. That's how the matter stands.\"    Rouletabille said no more but plunged into thought. A quarter of an hour  thus passed.    Coming back to himself again he said, addressing the magistrate:    \"How did Mademoiselle Stangerson wear her hair on that evening?\"    \"I don't know,\" replied Monsieur de Marquet.    \"That's a very important point,\" said Rouletabille. \"Her hair was done  up in bands, wasn't it? I feel sure that on that evening, the evening of  the crime, she had her hair arranged in bands.\"    \"Then you are mistaken, Monsieur Rouletabille,\" replied the magistrate;  \"Mademoiselle Stangerson that evening had her hair drawn up in a knot  on the top of her head,--her usual way of arranging it--her forehead  completely uncovered. I can assure you, for we have carefully examined  the wound. There was no blood on the hair, and the arrangement of it has  not been disturbed since the crime was committed.\"    \"You are sure! You are sure that, on the night of the crime, she had not  her hair in bands?\"    \"Quite sure,\" the magistrate continued, smiling, \"because I remember the  Doctor saying to me, while he was examining the wound, 'It is a great  pity Mademoiselle Stangerson was in the habit of drawing her hair back  from her forehead. If she had worn it in bands, the blow she received  on the temple would have been weakened.' It seems strange to me that you  should attach so much importance to this point.\"    \"Oh! if she had not her hair in bands, I give it up,\" said Rouletabille,  with a despairing gesture.    \"And was the wound on her temple a bad one?\" he asked presently.    \"Terrible.\"    \"With what weapon was it made?\"    \"That is a secret of the investigation.\"    \"Have you found the weapon--whatever it was?\"    The magistrate did not answer.    \"And the wound in the throat?\"    Here the examining magistrate readily confirmed the decision of the"]]]
