The Court of Appeal consists of the President,  two Judges, an Officer of the Public Ministry and a Registrar, and hears  all appeals from the judgments of the other Courts, and also from those  given by Courts Martial against civilians who are not natives in those  regions subjected to special rule. Natives who commit offences against  other natives, are left to be dealt with by the local Chief[2]. The  Public Minister can however interfere if he thinks the crime will not  be punished if left to the Chief.    The Public Ministry consists of a Procureur d'Etat appointed by the  Sovereign, who acts in the Court of Appeal and of substitutes appointed  by the Governor General, who act in the other Courts. Their duty is to  discover all infractions of the law in the whole territory of the State  and to see that all decrees, arrests, ordinances and penal regulations  are carried out. They are especially instructed to arrange that any  native who has been injured receives full compensation before any fine  is taken to the profit of the State.    Any region can be placed under military law by a decree of the Governor  General. Civilians however, are only subject to the ordinary penal laws,  and those who are not natives, can appeal against any decision of a  Court Martial. In practice these simple methods work admirably and it is  difficult to understand why they should not be equally successful in old  civilised countries and a good substitute for the complicated and  cumbrous machinery of to-day.

Banana to Leopoldville.      The amount of sand in the bath water on the morning of July 12th  indicated that we were approaching the mouth of a large river. The  Atlantic indeed, which had varied in colour from dirty green near the  English Channel to ultra marine at Teneriffe, was now of a fine amber  tint. As yet land was not in sight; it was comparatively cool and a  slight breeze was blowing. About midday the low lying coast of Central  Africa became visible as a dark line and half an hour afterwards a  simple break could be seen in this line which was the clearly defined  mouth of the Congo. On reference to the chart it became clear that  although the lower Congo forms a delta in some places twenty miles in  width, all the streams coalesce and flow through an opening not more  than five miles wide. On both sides the coast is low lying and well  wooded.    As we approach nearer, the northern point resolves itself into the  extremity of a peninsula, for one branch of the river turns northward  thus leaving a strip of land a few hundred yards wide. We pass through  the mouth of the river, thread our way between several buoys, turn up  this northern channel and arrive at an anchorage in which eight or nine  small ships are riding. As we take up our position a boat leaves the  shore flying the Congo Flag, a blue ground with a golden star in the  centre. Soon after we go ashore in a _dug out_. propelled by Kru boys to  the town of Banana, which is built on this sandy peninsula and is thus  guarded by sharks on one side and crocodiles on the other. We land at a  wooden pier used chiefly for loading canoes. On each side are  magnificent palms, some being more than fifty feet high and all bearing  many cocoa nuts at this season about half ripe. These palms are not  indigenous, but flourish here. The main highway of Banana is a path of  clean yellow sand about ten feet wide, shaded by an avenue of these  palms and crosses at intervals small tidal streams by rustic wooden  bridges. Many tropical trees and shrubs grow on each side of the avenue,  and in the bright sunshine the whole forms a very beautiful picture. It  is unfortunate that the effect reminds one somewhat forcibly of a  transformation scene of a pantomime and thus appears artificial although  in reality, it is absolutely natural. The resemblance is still further  strengthened by the numerous ladies of the ballet who leisurely stroll  along clothed in nature's ebony black. No one seems to know the origin  of the name of the town, for the Banana palm is not found here at all.    At the extreme end of the point, and extending inwards for several  hundred yards, are the grounds of the Dutch Trading Company, which has  been established here for more than fifty years and ships many of the  products of the country. The wooden sheds painted white are very  picturesque amid the vivid green foliage. Beyond this area is the house  of Dr. Carre, the Commissaire of the District of Banana, which like all  the other houses in the town is raised on piles above the level of the  sand, for the double purpose of ensuring a current of air beneath and of  keeping it dry when the peninsula is flooded. It faces the sea and  behind is a small garden in which are many meteorological instruments.  Among these are an anemometer slowly revolving in the light air, maximum  and minimum bulbs in the shade, on the ground and beneath it, a most  ingenious sun dial, and a heliometer. Walking inland along the central  avenue, we pass some native shops, one of which bears the interesting  name of _Williams Brothers_. In many of the verandahs, native women  wrapped in highly coloured cloths but with bare feet and legs, are  working sewing machines or tending their children. Further on is a space  laid out in regular squares, in each of which is a well built wooden  house raised on piles, and an ornamental garden, the flower beds being  bordered either with sea shells or with glass bottles pushed neck  downwards into the sand, leaving about two inches projecting above the  surface. A little further on is an hotel facing the sea in which is  apparently poor accommodation and not much to eat or drink. Beyond this  is the native village, consisting of square huts and rough gardens in  which some potatoes seem to be growing in spite of the soil and  temperature.    Only about twenty Europeans live at Banana and their chief excitement is  the arrival of the steamer. Most of them indeed came off to dinner and  held a kind of concert in the saloon afterwards. All night long winches  and men were creaking, groaning, and shouting, as some of the cargo was  put overboard into two large lighters. It was not however, destined for  Banana and was transshipped here only to lighten the _Leopoldville_ so  that she could pass a certain bar higher up the river. The cargo  consisted of coal in the shape of brickets, cement, rice, oil, cloth,  clothes, beads, salt and general provisions. As soon as sufficient had  been removed, the two lighters were attached one to each side of the  ship and we started up the main stream, which here runs between the  south or Portuguese bank and a series of islands. All these are covered  with dense forest the only living things visible being great black  eagles with white wings. On the left bank of the river we pass Malela, a  station for collecting bamboos, and soon after Kissange on the opposite  side where palm oil is made and shipped. A little higher up, the country  opens out and a range of hills becomes visible in the distance, the  plain between being covered with coarse grass six or seven feet high,  relieved at intervals by solitary palm trees. This is all Portuguese  territory, the Congo State here possessing only a narrow strip of land  along the northern bank. The course of the river here is very sinuous,  winding in and out among the hills, the curves being cut more sharply  each day as the water eats into the sand and carries it to be digested  in the great stomach of the Atlantic.    In this district both the State and the Portuguese have started large  farms for breeding European cattle which thrive here satisfactorily.  Higher up a solitary rock overhangs the left bank. This is known as  Fetish Rock from the legend that the natives used to throw live people  from it into the river as sacrifices. This is possibly true but there is  little evidence to show that the natives of the Congo ever sacrificed  either living or dead to propitiate anyone or anything.    Near here we anchor for the night and are welcomed by a host of most  noisy and vicious mosquitoes who have a particular partiality to good  healthy European-fed blood. Again we are delayed to unload and this time  into a small steamer the _Lagoon_--for the ship is still too deep in the  water to cross the bar. This sandy obstruction has an unpleasant habit  of shifting its position and it is necessary therefore to make careful  soundings every voyage at this time of the year when the water is low.  These are carried out by Captain Sparrow and Mr. Wright the chief Congo  pilot with the aid of a most ingenious sounding machine. It consists of  a simple pulley wheel raised on a standard about ten feet above the deck  of a small pilot steamer. Over this passes a line weighted at both ends  but unequally, and both weights hang down in the water, the heavier  naturally being on the bottom of the river. To prevent this line--which  corresponds to the ordinary lead line--trailing, as the boat moves  forward, a second line is fixed to the weight and passes under water to  the bows of the vessel where it is attached As the vessel passes slowly  through the water, the weight rises and falls according to the level of  the bottom, and the counterweight hauls in the slack of the line, which  is marked in the usual way by coloured tapes. At any moment therefore,  the depth of water can be determined by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15250"],[0,"Myths and Legends of China (#4)"],[1,"Sung dynasty (1127-1280) the  Tartars owned the northern half of China, as far down as the Yangtzu  River, and in the Yuean dynasty (1280-1368) they conquered the whole  country. During the period 1644-1912 it was in the possession of  the Manchus. At present the five chief component peoples of China are  represented in the striped national flag (from the top downward) by red  (Manchus), yellow (Chinese), blue (Mongolians), white (Mohammedans),  and black (Tibetans). This flag was adopted on the establishment of the  Republic in 1912, and supplanted the triangular Dragon flag previously  in use. By this time the population--which had varied considerably at  different periods owing to war, famine, and pestilence--had increased  to about 400,000,000.      General Government    The general division of the nation was into the King and the People,  The former was regarded as appointed by the will of Heaven and  as the parent of the latter. Besides being king, he was also  law-giver, commander-in-chief of the armies, high priest, and  master of ceremonies. The people were divided into four classes: (1)  _Shih_, Officers (later Scholars), consisting of _Ch'en_, Officials  (a few of whom were ennobled), and _Shen Shih_, Gentry; (2) _Nung_,  Agriculturists; (3) _Kung_, Artisans; and (4) _Shang_, Merchants.    For administrative purposes there were at the seat of central  government (which, first at P'ing-yang--in modern Shansi--was  moved eleven times during the Feudal Period, and was finally  at Yin) ministers, or ministers and a hierarchy of officials,  the country being divided into provinces, varying in number from  nine in the earliest times to thirty-six under the First Emperor,  221 B.C., and finally twenty-two at the present day. At first these  provinces contained states, which were models of the central state,  the ruler's 'Middle Kingdom.' The provincial administration was  in the hands of twelve Pastors or Lord-Lieutenants. They were the  chiefs of all the nobles in a province. Civil and military offices  were not differentiated. The feudal lords or princes of states often  resided at the king's court, officers of that court being also sent  forth as princes of states. The king was the source of legislation  and administered justice. The princes in their several states had  the power of rewards and punishments. Revenue was derived from a  tithe on the land, from the income of artisans, merchants, fishermen,  foresters, and from the tribute brought by savage tribes.    The general structure and principles of this system of administration  remained the same, with few variations, down to the end of the  Monarchical Period in 1912. At the end of that period we find the  emperor still considered as of divine descent, still the head of  the civil, legislative, military, ecclesiastical, and ceremonial  administration, with the nation still divided into the same four  classes. The chief ministries at the capital, Peking, could in most  cases trace their descent from their prototypes of feudal times, and  the principal provincial administrative officials--the Governor-General  or Viceroy, governor, provincial treasurer, judge, etc.--had similarly  a pedigree running back to offices then existing--a continuous duration  of adherence to type which is probably unique.    Appointment to office was at first by selection, followed by an  examination to test proficiency; later was introduced the system of  public competitive literary examinations for office, fully organized  in the seventeenth century, and abolished in 1903, when official  positions were thrown open to the graduates of colleges established  on a modern basis.    In 1912, on the overthrow of the Manchu monarchy, China became a  republic, with an elected President, and a Parliament consisting  of a Senate and House of Representatives. The various government  departments were reorganized on Western lines, and a large number  of new offices instituted. Up to the present year the Law of the  Constitution, owing to political dissension between the North and  the South, has not been put into force.      Laws    Chinese law, like primitive law generally, was not instituted  in order to ensure justice between man and man; its object was  to enforce subordination of the ruled to the ruler. The laws were  punitive and vindictive rather than reformatory or remedial, criminal  rather than civil. Punishments were cruel: branding, cutting off the  nose, the legs at the knees, castration, and death, the latter not  necessarily, or indeed ordinarily, for taking life. They included in  some cases punishment of the family, the clan, and the neighbours of  the offender. The _lex talionis_ was in full force.    Nevertheless, in spite of the harsh nature of the punishments, possibly  adapted, more or less, to a harsh state of society, though the \"proper  end of punishments\"--to \"make an end of punishing\"--was missed, the  Chinese evolved a series of excellent legal codes. This series began  with the revision of King Mu's _Punishments_ in 950 B.C., the first  regular code being issued in 650 B.C., and ended with the well-known  _Ta Ch'ing lue li_ (_Laws and Statutes of the Great Ch'ing Dynasty_),  issued in A.D. 1647. Of these codes the great exemplar was the _Law  Classic_ drawn up by Li K'uei (_Li K'uei fa ching_), a statesman  in the service of the first ruler of the Wei State, in the fourth  century B.C. The _Ta Ch'ing lue li_ has been highly praised by competent  judges. Originally it sanctioned only two kinds of punishment, death  and flogging, but others were in use, and the barbarous _ling ch'ih_,  'lingering death' or 'slicing to pieces,' invented about A.D. 1000  and abolished in 1905, was inflicted for high treason, parricide,  on women who killed their husbands, and murderers of three persons  of one family. In fact, until some first-hand knowledge of Western  systems and procedure was obtained, the vindictive as opposed to the  reformatory idea of punishments continued to obtain in China down to  quite recent years, and has not yet entirely disappeared. Though the  crueller forms of punishment had been legally abolished, they continued  to be used in many parts. Having been joint judge at Chinese trials  at which, in spite of my protests, prisoners were hung up by their  thumbs and made to kneel on chains in order to extort confession  (without which no accused person could be punished), I can testify  that the true meaning of the \"proper end of punishments\" had no more  entered into the Chinese mind at the close of the monarchical _regime_  than it had 4000 years before.    As a result of the reform movement into which China was forced as  an alternative to foreign domination toward the end of the Manchu  Period, but chiefly owing to the bait held out by Western Powers,  that extraterritoriality would be abolished when China had reformed  her judicial system, a new Provisional Criminal Code was published. It  substituted death by hanging or strangulation for decapitation, and  imprisonment for various lengths of time for bambooing. It was adopted  in large measure by the Republican _regime_, and is the chief legal  instrument in use at the present time. But close examination reveals  the fact that it is almost an exact copy of the Japanese penal code,  which in turn was modelled upon that of Germany. It is, in fact, a  Western code imitated, and as it stands is quite out of harmony with  present conditions in China. It will have to be modified and recast  to be a suitable, just, and practicable national legal instrument  for the Chinese people. Moreover, it is frequently overridden in a  high-handed manner by the police, who often keep a person acquitted  by the Courts of Justice in custody until they have 'squeezed' him  of all they can hope to get out of him. And it is noteworthy that,  though provision was made in the Draft Code for trial by jury, this  provision never went into effect; and the slavish imitation of alien  methods is shown by the curiously inconsistent reason given--that \"the  fact that jury trials have been abolished in Japan is indicative of the  inadvisability of transplanting this Western institution into China!\"      Local Government    The central administration being a far-flung network of officialdom,  there was hardly any room for local government apart from it. We  find it only in the village elder and those associated with him, who  took up what government was necessary where the jurisdiction of the  unit of the central administration--the district magistracy--ceased,  or at least did not concern itself in meddling much.      Military System    The peace-loving agricultural settlers in early China had at first  no army. When occasion arose, all the farmers exchanged their  ploughshares for swords and bows and arrows, and went forth to  fight. In the intervals between the harvests, when the fields were  clear, they held manoeuvres and practised the arts of warfare. The  king, who had his Six Armies, under the Six High Nobles, forming  the royal military force, led the troops in person, accompanied by  the spirit-tablets of his ancestors and of the gods of the land and  grain. Chariots, drawn by four horses and containing soldiers armed  with spears and javelins and archers, were much in use. A thousand  chariots was the regular force. Warriors wore buskins on their legs,  and were sometimes gagged in order to prevent the alarm being given to  the enemy. In action the chariots occupied the centre, the bowmen the  left, the spearmen the right flank. Elephants were sometimes used in  attack. Spy-kites, signal-flags, hook-ladders, horns, cymbals, drums,  and beacon-fires were in use. The ears of the vanquished were taken  to the king, quarter being rarely if ever given.    After the establishment of absolute monarchical government standing  armies became the rule. Military science was taught, and soldiers  sometimes trained for seven"]]]
