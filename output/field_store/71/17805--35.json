He is not, like his wife, a person of  imagination. She leaves him far behind, though he is so inconvertible  that if she were a less superior person he would have been a sad  encumbrance. He always figures in the corner of the scenes in which she  distinguishes herself, separated from her by something like the gulf  that separated Caliban from Ariel. He has his hands in his pockets, his  head poked forward; what is going on is quite beyond his comprehension.  He vaguely wonders what his wife will do next; her manoeuvres quite  transcend him. Mrs. Ponsonby de Tomkyns always succeeds. She is never  at fault; she is as quick as the instinct of self-preservation. She is  the little London lady who is determined to be a greater one--she  pushes, gently but firmly--always pushes. At last she arrives.\"    We have quoted this delightful picture almost in its entirety from the  essay upon du Maurier written by Mr. Henry James in the eighties to  which we have referred. It describes the type of woman revealed in Mrs.  de Tomkyns when we have followed her adventures up a little way in the  back numbers of _Punch_. But, if we may be permitted the slang, the type  itself is anything but \"a back number.\" Du Maurier's work bids fair to  live in the enjoyment of many generations, from the fact that its chaff,  for the most part, is directed against vanities that recur in human  nature. Mr. James tells us that the lady of whom we write \"hesitates at  nothing; she is very modern. If she doesn't take the aesthetic line more  than is necessary, she finds it necessary to take it a little; for if we  are to believe du Maurier, the passion for strange raiment and blue  china has during the last few years made ravages in the London world.\"  Mr. Henry James himself is one of the experts of the London world. There  is almost a hint in the last sentence that he thought du Maurier's  genius helped to nurse the crazes it made fun of.    Since writing this I have been told by one to whom du Maurier related  the incident, that the hero of the aesthetic movement himself, Oscar  Wilde, offered to sit to du Maurier for the chief character in his skit.  Wilde was very young, but already master of that art of  self-advertisement which he received from Byron and Disraeli, perfected,  and, I think, handed on to Mr. Bernard Shaw. But such anxiety for every  kind of celebrity at any cost seems to have lost the youthful genius the  esteem of the great _Punch_ artist once and for all. The representative  of humorous journalism seems the one upon whom the delicate humour of  the proposal was lost.    As far as du Maurier was capable of vindictiveness it was reserved for  Maudle and Postlethwaite. He went out of his way to give a contemptible  appearance to those who took the name of Art in vain. His only spiteful  drawings are those of aesthetes. They are spiteful to the extent of the  great disgust which he, the most amiable of satirists, felt for them.  But still he was careful not to treat a craze which afforded him  inexhaustible variations of subject matter with so much bitterness as  to kill it right out. It was only towards this craze that he showed any  bitterness at all, for the rest he is always amused with Society. He has  none of the bitter Jeremiahlike anger against it of a Swift.    Mr. Henry James defending du Maurier from a charge of being malignant,  brought against him for his ugly representation of queer people,  failures, and grotesques, refused to allow that the taint of \"French  ferocity\" of which the artist was accused, existed. But Mr. Henry James  sees in du Maurier's ugly people a real specification of type, where we  confess that we have felt that his \"ferocity\" missed the point of  resemblance to type through clumsy exaggeration. One noticeable  instance, however, to our mind, where the too frequent outrageousness is  replaced by an exquisite study of character, is in the face of the fair  authoress who, when the gallant Colonel, anxious to break the ice, and  full of the fact that he has just been made a proud father, asks if she  takes any interest in very young children, replies, \"I loathe _all_  children!\" (January 13, 1880).    [Illustration: Illustration for \"Wives and Daughters\"    _The Cornhill_, 1864.]      Section 7    The story of children's conversation has perhaps never been told quite  so charmingly as du Maurier tells it. We could quote endlessly from the  admirably constructed nursery dialogues in which he does not attempt to  make a joke, and in which he very carefully refrains from giving a  fantastic precocity to his little characters--dialogues in which he is  quite content to rely upon our sympathetic knowledge of children's way  of putting things, while he rests the appeal of the drawing and legend  entirely upon a _naive_ literalness to their remarks. The charming  atmosphere of the well-ordered nursery must be felt by readers, and then  we can quote from the text of some of his drawings of the kind; this we  shall do somewhat at random and as they come to mind.         \"Are you asleep, dearest? Yes, Mamma, and the Doctor particularly       said that I wasn't to be waked to take my medicine\" (_July_ 10,       1880).         \"Oh, Auntie! There's your tiresome cook's been and filled my egg       too full\" (_April_ 22, 1882).    Already we are seized with misgivings as to whether, with the reader  very much on the look-out for the jokes, we shall be successful in  making our point in claiming for du Maurier that, as much as any author  who has ever written upon children, he captures \"the note\" of children's  speeches. But anyhow we will try.    For an instance there is the delightful picture of a child clasping its  mother round the knees, whilst the mother, shawled for an evening  concert, bends affectionately down--         \"Good Night! Good Night! my dear, sweet, pretty mamma! I like you       to go out, because if you didn't you'd never come home again, you       know.\"    The artist perhaps invented this pretty speech, but the \"Good Night!  Good Night! my dear, sweet, pretty mamma\" is of the very spirit of the  redundancy by which children hope in heaping words together to express  accumulation of emotion. Du Maurier's children never make the nasty pert  answers upon which, for their nearly impossible but always vulgar  smartness, the providers of jokes about children for the comic papers  generally depend. He is simply going on with his \"novel\"--_The Tale of  the House_ it might be called--when he affords us realistic glimpses of  nursery conversation.         _Mamma_. \"What is Baby crying for, Maggie?\"         _Maggie_. \"I don't know.\"         _Mamma_. \"And what are you looking so indignant about?\"         _Maggie_. \"That nasty, greedy dog's been and took and eaten my       punge-take!\"         _Mamma_. \"Why, I saw you eating a sponge-cake a minute ago!\"         _Maggie_. \"O--that was Baby's.\"    We need hardly labour the point of the \"been and took and eaten\" as an  instance of felicity in reconstructing children's conversation, and  making the verisimilitude to their grammar the charm of the  reconstruction.         _Ethel_. \"Isn't it sad, Arthur? There's the drawing-room cleared       for a dance, and all the dolls ready to begin, only they've got no       partners!\"         _Arthur_. \"Well, Ethel! There's the four gentlemen in my Noah's       Ark; but they don't look as if they cared very much about       _dancing_, you know!\" (_February_ 24, 1872).         _Ethel_. \"And O, Mamma, do you know as we were coming along we saw       a horrid woman with a red striped shawl drink something out of a       bottle, and then hand it to some men. I'm sure she was tipsy.\"         _Beatrice_ (who always looks on the best side of things). \"Perhaps       it was only Castor Oil, after all!\"         _A whispered appeal_. \"Mamma! Mamma! don't scold him any more, it       makes the room so dark.\"    It is the _poetry_ of the nursery that is to be felt throughout du  Maurier's art in this vein. And how well he knows the emotions of  childhood. For instance, the large drawing \"Farewell to Fair Normandy\"  (October 2, 1880), extending across two full pages of _Punch_, in which  the children away for their seaside holiday leave the sands for the last  time in a mournful procession. The sky is dimmed with an evening cloud.  Du Maurier has compressed much poetry into the scene. It has been said  that \"there is only one art,\" and this seems to be proved on great  occasions by those who can command more than one art for the expression  of their feelings. It is difficult to say where in this picture the  artist in du Maurier gives place to the poet, as difficult as it is to  say before a picture of Rossetti.    [Illustration: Illustration for \"Wives and Daughters\"    _The Cornhill_, 1865.]    Sometimes du Maurier even depicted delightful children as the victims of  the fashionable crazes that he loved to attack, and thus we are brought  to another series of dialogues--as a rule though only involving the  \"grown-ups\"--in which the legend and the type of person depicted,  together, form a most valuable document of the times. There is for  instance the China mania--in the following in the incipient stage:--         \"O Mamma! O! O! N--N--Nurse has given me my C--C--Cod-liver Oil out       of a p--p--plain white mug\" (_December_ 26, 1874).    Then the inimitable colloquies of the aesthetes--and especially the now  famous one about the six-mark tea-pot.         _Aesthetic Bridegroom_. \"It is quite consummate, is it not?\"         _Intense Bride_. \"It is, indeed! Oh, Algernon, let us live up to       it!\"    Also the direction, to the architect about the country house:         _Fair Client_. \"I want it to be nice and baronial, Queen Anne and       Elizabethan, and all that; kind of quaint and Nuremburgy you       know--regular Old English, with French"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14400"],[0,"Manual of Egyptian Archaeology and Guide to the Study of Antiquities in Egypt (#4)"],[1,"themselves to cut  trenches at all; they merely levelled the space intended to be covered,  and, having probably watered it to settle the soil, they at once laid the  bricks upon the surface. When the house was finished, the scraps of mortar,  the broken bricks, and all the accumulated refuse of the work, made a bed  of eight inches or a foot in depth, and the base of the wall thus buried  served instead of a foundation. When the new house rose on the ruins of an  older one decayed by time or ruined by accident, the builders did not even  take the trouble to raze the old walls to the ground. Levelling the surface  of the ruins, they-built upon them at a level a few feet higher than  before: thus each town stands upon one or several artificial mounds, the  tops of which may occasionally rise to a height of from sixty to eighty  feet above the surrounding country. The Greek historians attributed these  artificial mounds to the wisdom of the kings, and especially to Sesostris,  who, as they supposed, wished to raise the towns above the inundation. Some  modern writers have even described the process, which they explain thus:--A  cellular framework of brick walls, like a huge chess-board, formed the  substructure, the cells being next filled in with earth, and the houses  built upon this immense platform (Note 5).    [Illustration: Fig. 2.--Ancient house with vaulted floors, against the  northern wall of the great temple of Medinet Habu]    [Illustration: Fig. 3.--Plan of three-quarters of the town of Hat-Hotep-  Usertesen (Kahun), built for the accommodation of the officials and workmen  employed in connection with the pyramid of Usertesen II. at Illahun. The  workmen's quarters are principally on the west, and separated from the  eastern part of the town by a thick wall. At the south-west corner, outside  the town, stood the pyramid temple, and in front of it the porter's lodge.  Reproduced from Plate XIV. of _Illahun, Kahun, and Gurob_, W.M.F. Petrie.]    But where I have excavated, especially at Thebes, I have never found  anything answering to this conception. The intersecting walls which one  finds beneath the later houses are nothing but the ruins of older  dwellings, which in turn rest on others still older. The slightness of the  foundations did not prevent the builders from boldly running up quite lofty  structures. In the ruins of Memphis, I have observed walls still standing  from thirty to forty feet in height. The builders took no precaution beyond  enlarging the base of the wall, and vaulting the floors (fig. 2).[1] The  thickness of an ordinary wall was about sixteen inches for a low house; but  for one of several storeys, it was increased to three or four feet. Large  beams, embedded here and there in the brickwork or masonry, bound the whole  together, and strengthened the structure. The ground floor was also  frequently built with dressed stones, while the upper parts were of brick.  The limestone of the neighbouring hills was the stone commonly used for  such purposes. The fragments of sandstone, granite, and alabaster, which  are often found mixed in with it, are generally from some ruined temple;  the ancient Egyptians having pulled their neglected monuments to pieces  quite as unscrupulously as do their modern successors. The houses of an  ancient Egyptian town were clustered round its temple, and the temple stood  in a rectangular enclosure to which access was obtained through monumental  gateways in the surrounding brick wall. The gods dwelt in fortified  mansions, or at any rate in redoubts to which the people of the place might  fly for safety in the event of any sudden attack upon their town. Such  towns as were built all at once by prince or king were fairly regular in  plan, having wide paved streets at right angles to each other, and the  buildings in line. The older cities, whose growth had been determined by  the chances and changes of centuries, were characterised by no such  regularity. Their houses stood in a maze of blind alleys, and narrow, dark,  and straggling streets, with here and there the branch of a canal, almost  dried up during the greater part of the year, and a muddy pond where the  cattle drank and women came for water. Somewhere in each town was an open  space shaded by sycamores or acacias, and hither on market days came the  peas-ants of the district two or three times in the month. There were also  waste places where rubbish and refuse was thrown, to be quarrelled over by  vultures, hawks, and dogs.    [Illustration: Fig. 4.--Plan of house, Medinet Habu]    [Illustration: Fig. 5.--Plan of house, Medinet Habu.]    [Illustration: Fig. 6.--Facade of a house toward the street, second Theban  period.]    [Illustration: Fig. 7.--Plan of central court of house, second Theban  period.]    [Illustration: Fig. 8.--Restoration of the hall in a Twelfth Dynasty house.

Petrie.]    [Illustration: Fig. 9.--Box representing a house (British Museum).]    The lower classes lived in mere huts which, though built of bricks, were no  better than those of the present fellahin. At Karnak, in the Pharaonic  town; at Kom Ombo, in the Roman town; and at Medinet Habu, in the Coptic  town, the houses in the poorer quarters have seldom more than twelve or  sixteen feet of frontage. They consist of a ground floor, with sometimes  one or two living-rooms above. The middle-class folk, as shopkeepers, sub-  officials, and foremen, were better housed. Their houses were brick-built  and rather small, yet contained some half-dozen rooms communicating by  means of doorways, which were usually arched over, and having vaulted  roofs in some cases, and in others flat ones. Some few of the houses were  two or three storeys high, and many were separated from the street by a  narrow court, beyond which the rooms were ranged on either side of a long  passage (fig. 4). More frequently, the court was surrounded on three sides  by chambers (fig. 5); and yet oftener the house fronted close upon the  street. In the latter case the facade consisted of a high wall, whitewashed  or painted, and surmounted by a cornice. Even in better houses the only  ornamentation of their outer walls consisted in angular grooving, the  grooves being surmounted by representations of two lotus flowers, each pair  with the upper parts of the stalks in contact (see figs. 24, 25). The door  was the only opening, save perhaps a few small windows pierced at irregular  intervals (fig. 6). Even in unpretentious houses, the door was often made  of stone. The doorposts projected slightly beyond the surface of the wall,  and the lintel supported a painted or sculptured cornice. Having crossed  the threshold, one passed successively through two dimly-lighted entrance  chambers, the second of which opened into the central court (fig. 7). The  best rooms in the houses of wealthier citizens were sometimes lighted  through a square opening in the centre of a ceiling supported on wooden  columns. In the Twelfth Dynasty town of Kahun the shafts of these columns  rested upon round stone bases; they were octagonal, and about ten inches in  diameter (fig. 8). Notwithstanding the prevalence of enteric disease and  ophthalmia, the family crowded together into one or two rooms during the  winter, and slept out on the roof under the shelter of mosquito nets in  summer. On the roof also the women gossiped and cooked. The ground floor  included both store-rooms, barns, and stables. Private granaries were  generally in pairs (see fig. 11), brick-built in the same long conical  shape as the state granaries, and carefully plastered with mud inside and  out. Neither did the people of a house forget to find or to make hiding  places in the walls or floors of their home, where they could secrete their  household treasures--such as nuggets of gold and silver, precious stones,  and jewellery for men and women--from thieves and tax-collectors alike.  Wherever the upper floors still remain standing, they reproduce the ground-  floor plan with scarcely any differences. These upper rooms were reached by  an outside staircase, steep and narrow, and divided at short intervals by  small square landings. The rooms were oblong, and were lighted only from  the doorway; when it was decided to open windows on the street, they were  mere air-holes near the ceiling, pierced without regularity or symmetry,  fitted with a lattice of wooden cross bars, and secured by wooden shutters.  The floors were bricked or paved, or consisted still more frequently of  merely a layer of rammed earth. The rooms were not left undecorated; the  mud-plaster of the walls, generally in its native grey, although  whitewashed in some cases, was painted with red or yellow, and ornamented  with drawings of interior and exterior views of a house, and of household  vessels and eatables (fig. 10). The roof was flat, and made probably, as at  the present day, of closely laid rows of palm-branches covered with a  coating of mud thick enough to withstand the effects of rain. Sometimes it  was surmounted by only one or two of the usual Egyptian ventilators; but  generally there was a small washhouse on the roof (fig. 9), and a little  chamber for the slaves or guards to sleep in. The household fire was made  in a hollow of the earthen floor, usually to one side of the room, and the  smoke escaped through a hole in the ceiling; branches of trees, charcoal,  and dried cakes of ass or cow dung were used for fuel.
