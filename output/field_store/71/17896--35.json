[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15932"],[0,"The Literature of the Ancient Egyptians (#4)"],[1," funerary temple that was attached to every  pyramid. The carefully selected and duly appointed priest offered these  one by one, and as he presented each to the spirit of the king he  uttered a formula that was believed to convert the material food into a  substance possessing a spiritual character and fit to form the food of  the _ka_, or \"double,\" or \"vital power,\" of the dead king. The offerings  assisted in renewing his life, and any failure to perform this service  was counted a sin against the dead king's spirit. It was also necessary  to perform another set of ceremonies, the object of which was to \"open  the mouth\" of the dead king, _i.e._ to restore to him the power to  breathe, think, speak, taste, smell, and walk. At the performance of  these ceremonies it was all-important to present articles of food,  wearing apparel, scents and unguents, and, in short, every object that  the king was likely to require in the Other World. The spirits of all  these objects passed into the Other World ready for use by the spirit of  the king. It follows as a matter of course that the king in the Other  World needed a retinue, and a bodyguard, and a host of servants, just as  he needed slaves upon earth. In primitive times a large number of  slaves, both male and female, were slain when a king died, and their  bodies were buried in his tomb, whilst their spirits passed into the  Other World to serve the spirit of the king, just as their bodies had  served his body upon earth. As the king had enemies in this world, so it  was thought he would have enemies in the Other World, and men feared  that he would be attacked or molested by evilly-disposed gods and  spirits, and by deadly animals and serpents, and other noxious reptiles.  To ward off the attacks of these from his tomb, and his mummified body,  and his spirit, the priest composed spells of various kinds, and the  utterance of such, in a proper manner, was believed to render him immune  from the attacks of foes of all kinds. Very often such spells took the  form of prayers. Many of the spells were exceedingly ancient, even in  the Pyramid Period; they were, in fact, so old that they were  unintelligible to the scribes of the day. They date from the time when  the Egyptians believed more in magic than religion; it is possible that  when they were composed, religion, in our sense of the word, was still  undeveloped among the Egyptians.    When the Pyramid Texts were written men believed that the welfare of  souls and spirits in the Other World could be secured by the prayers of  the living. Hence we find in them numerous prayers for the dead, and  hymns addressed to the gods on their behalf, and extracts from many  kinds of ancient religious books. When these were recited, and offerings  made both to the gods and to the dead, it was confidently believed that  the souls of the dead received special consideration and help from the  gods, and from all the good spirits who formed their train. These  prayers are very important from many points of view, but specially so  from the fact that they prove that the Egyptians who lived under the  sixth dynasty attached more importance to them than to magical spells  and incantations. In other words, the Egyptians had begun to reject  their belief in the efficacy of magic, and to develop a belief of a more  spiritual character. There were many reasons for this development, but  the most important was the extraordinary growth of the influence of the  religion of Osiris, which had before the close of the period of the  sixth dynasty spread all over Egypt. This religion promised to all who  followed it, high or low, rich or poor, a life in the world beyond the  grave, after a resurrection that was made certain to them through the  sufferings, death, and resurrection of Osiris, who was the incarnation  of the great primeval god who created the heavens and the earth. A few  extracts illustrating the general contents of the Pyramid Texts may now  be given.    I. Mention has already been made of the \"opening of the mouth\" of the  dead king: under the earliest dynasties this ceremony was performed on a  statue of the king. Water was sprinkled before it, and incense was  burnt, and the statue was anointed with seven kinds of unguents, and its  eyes smeared with eye paint. After the statue had been washed and  dressed a meal of sepulchral offerings was set before it. The essential  ceremony consisted in applying to the lips of the statue a curiously  shaped instrument called the PESH KEF, with which the bandages that  covered the mouth of the dead king in his tomb were supposed to be cut  and the mouth set free to open. In later times the Liturgy of Opening  the Mouth was greatly enlarged and was called the Book of Opening the  Mouth. The ceremonies were performed by the Kher-heb priest, the son of  the deceased, and the priests and ministrants called Sameref, Sem, Smer,  Am-as, Am-khent, and the assistants called Mesentiu. First of all  incense was burnt, and the priest said, \"Thou art pure,\" four times.  Water was then sprinkled over the statue and the priest said, \"Thou art  pure. Thou art pure. Thy purifications are the purifications of  Horus,[1] and the purifications of Horus are thy purifications.\" This  formula was repeated three times, once with the name of Set,[2] once  with the name of Thoth,[3] and once with the name of Sep. The priest  then said, \"Thou hast received thy head, and thy bones have been brought  unto thee before Keb.\"[4] During the performance of the next five  ceremonies, in which incense of various kinds was offered, the priest  said: \"Thou art pure (four times). That which is in the two eyes of  Horus hath been presented unto thee with the two vases of Thoth, and  they purify thee so that there may not exist in thee the power of  destruction that belongeth unto thee. Thou art pure. Thou art pure. Pure  is the _seman_ incense that openeth thy mouth. Taste the taste thereof  in the divine dwelling. _Seman_ incense is the emission of Horus; it  stablisheth the heart of Horus-Set, it purifieth the gods who are in the  following of Horus. Thou art censed with natron. Thou art established  among the gods thy brethren. Thy mouth is like that of a sucking calf on  the day of its birth. Thou art censed. Thou art censed. Thou art pure.  Thou art pure. Thou art established among thy brethren the gods. Thy  head is censed. Thy mouth is censed. Thy bones are purified. [Decay]  that is inherent in thee shall not touch thee. I have given thee the Eye  of Horus,[5] and thy face is filled therewith. Thou art shrouded in  incense (say twice).\"[6]    [Footnote 1: A form of the Sun-god.]    [Footnote 2: Originally a benevolent god: later the great god of evil.]    [Footnote 3: The scribe of the gods, lord of wisdom: see pp. 1,2.]    [Footnote 4: The Earth-god.]    [Footnote 5: Horus gave his eye to Osiris, and thereby restored life to  him.]    [Footnote 6: Repetitions are omitted.]    The next ceremony, the ninth, represented the re-birth of the king, who  was personified by a priest. The priest, wrapped in the skin of a bull,  lay on a small bed and feigned death. When the chief priest had said, \"O  my father,\" four times, the priest representing the king came forth from  the bull's skin, and sat up; this act symbolized the resurrection of the  king in the form of a spirit-body (_sahu_). The chief priest then  asserted that the king was alive, and that he should never be removed,  and that he was similar in every way to Horus. The priest personifying  the king then put on a special garment, and taking a staff or sceptre in  his hand, said, \"I love my father and his transformation. I have made my  father, I have made a statue of him, a large statue. Horus loveth those  who love him.\" He then pressed the lips of the statue, and said, \"I have  come to embrace thee. I am thy son. I am Horus. I have pressed for thee  thy mouth.... I am thy beloved son.\" The words then said by the chief  priest, \"I have delivered this mine eye from his mouth, I have cut off  his leg,\" mean that the king was delivered from the jaws of death, and  that a grievous wound had been inflicted on the god of death, _i.e._  Set.    Whilst these ceremonies were being performed the animals brought to be  sacrificed were slain. Chief of these were two bulls, gazelle, geese,  &c., and their slaughter typified the conquest and death of the enemies  of the dead king. The heart and a fore-leg of each bull were presented  to the statue of the king, and the priest said: \"Hail, Osiris! I have  come to embrace thee. I am Horus. I have pressed for thee thy mouth. I  am thy beloved Son. I have opened thy mouth. Thy mouth hath been made  firm. I have made thy mouth and thy teeth to be in their proper places.  Hail, Osiris![1] I have opened thy mouth with the Eye of Horus.\" Then  taking two instruments made of metal the priest went through the motion  of cutting open the mouth and eyes of the statue, and said: \"I have  opened thy mouth. I have opened thy two eyes. I have opened thy mouth  with the instrument of Anpu.[2] I have opened thy mouth with the Meskha  instrument wherewith the mouth of the gods was opened. Horus openeth the  mouth and eyes of the Osiris. Horus openeth the mouth of the Osiris even  as he opened the mouth of his father. As he opened the mouth of the god  Osiris so shall he open the mouth of my father with the iron that cometh  forth from Set, with the Meskha instrument of iron wherewith he opened  the mouth of the gods shall the mouth of the Osiris be opened. And the  Osiris shall walk and shall talk, and his body shall be with the Great  Company of the Gods who dwell in the Great House of the Aged One (_i.e._  the Sun-god) who dwelleth in Anu.[3] And he shall take possession of the  Urrt Crown therein before Horus, the Lord of mankind. Hail, Osiris!  Horus hath opened thy mouth and thine eyes with the instruments Sebur  and An, wherewith the mouths "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15950"],[0,"Wilderness Ways (#4)"],[1,"much  easier. Their gait is a swinging trot, from which it is impossible to  jump; and if you frighten them out of their trot into a gallop and  keep them at it, they soon grow exhausted. Countless generations on  the northern wastes, where there is no need of jumping, have bred this  habit, and modified their muscles accordingly. But now a race of  caribou has moved south into the woods, where great trees lie fallen  across the way, and where, if Megaleep is in a hurry or there is  anybody behind him, jumping is a necessity. Still he doesn't like it,  and avoids it whenever possible. The little ones, left to themselves,  would always crawl under a tree, or trot round it. And this is another  thing to overcome, and another lesson to be taught in the caribou  school.    As I watched them the mothers all came out from the shadows and began  trotting round the opening, the little ones keeping close as possible,  each one to its mother's side. Then the old ones went faster; the  calves were left in a long line stringing out behind. Suddenly the  leader veered in to the edge of the timber and went over a fallen tree  with a jump; the cows followed splendidly, rising on one side, falling  gracefully on the other, like gray waves racing past the end of a  jetty. But the first little one dropped his head obstinately at the  tree and stopped short. The next one did the same thing; only he ran  his head into the first one's legs and knocked them out from under  him. The others whirled with a _ba-a-a-ah_, and scampered round the  tree and up to their mothers, who had turned now and stood watching  anxiously to see the effect of their lesson. Then it began over again.    It was true kindergarten teaching; for under guise of a frolic the  calves were being taught a needful lesson,--not only to jump, but, far  more important than that, to follow a leader, and to go where he goes  without question or hesitation. For the leaders on the barrens are  wise old bulls that make no mistakes. Most of the little caribou took  to the sport very well, and presently followed the mothers over the  low hurdles. But a few were timid; and then came the most intensely  interesting bit of the whole strange school, when a little one would  be led to a tree and butted from behind till he took the jump.    There was no \"consent of the governed\" in that governing. The mother  knew, and the calf didn't, just what was good for him.    It was this last lesson that broke up the school. Just in front of my  hiding place a tree fell out into the opening. A mother caribou  brought her calf up to this unsuspectingly, and leaped over, expecting  the little one to follow. As she struck she whirled like a top and  stood like a beautiful statue, her head pointing in my direction. Her  eyes were bright with fear, the ears set forward, the nostrils spread  to catch every tainted atom from the air. Then she turned and glided  silently away, the little one close to her side, looking up and  touching her frequently as if to whisper, _What is it? what is it?_  but making no sound. There was no signal given, no alarm of any kind  that I could understand; yet the lesson stopped instantly. The caribou  glided away like shadows. Over across the opening a bush swayed here  and there; a leaf quivered as if something touched its branch. Then  the schoolroom was empty and the woods all still.    There is another curious habit of Megaleep; and this one I am utterly  at a loss to account for. When he is old and feeble, and the tireless  muscles will no longer carry him with the herd over the wind-swept  barrens, and he falls sick at last, he goes to a spot far away in the  woods, where generations of his ancestors have preceded him, and there  lays him down to die. It is the caribou burying ground; and all the  animals of a certain district, or a certain herd (I am unable to tell  which), will go there when sick or sore wounded, if they have strength  enough to reach the spot. For it is far away from the scene of their  summer homes and their winter wanderings.    I know one such place, and visited it twice from my summer camp. It is  in a dark tamarack swamp by a lonely lake at the head of the  Little-South-West Miramichi River, in New Brunswick. I found it one  summer when trying to force my way from the big lake to a smaller one,  where trout were plenty. In the midst of the swamp I stumbled upon a  pair of caribou skeletons, which surprised me; for there were no  hunters within a hundred miles, and at that time the lake had lain for  many years unvisited. I thought of fights between bucks, and bull  moose, how two bulls will sometimes lock horns in a rush, and are too  weakened to break the lock, and so die together of exhaustion.  Caribou are more peaceable; they rarely fight that way; and, besides,  the horns here were not locked together, but lying well apart. As I  searched about, looking for the explanation of things, thinking of  wolves, yet wondering why the bones were not gnawed, I found another  skeleton, much older, then four or five more; some quite fresh, others  crumbling into mould. Bits of old bone and some splendid antlers were  scattered here and there through the underbrush; and when I scraped  away the dead leaves and moss, there were older bones and fragments  mouldering beneath.    I scarcely understood the meaning of it at the time; but since then I  have met men, Indians and hunters, who have spent much time in the  wilderness, who speak of \"bone yards\" which they have discovered,  places where they can go at any time and be sure of finding a good set  of caribou antlers. And they say that the caribou go there to die.    All animals, when feeble with age, or sickly, or wounded, have the  habit of going away deep into the loneliest coverts, and there lying  down where the leaves shall presently cover them. So that one rarely  finds a dead bird or animal in the woods where thousands die yearly.  Even your dog, that was born and lived by your house, often  disappears when you thought him too feeble to walk. Death calls him  gently; the old wolf stirs deep within him, and he goes away where the  master he served will never find him. And so with your cat, which is  only skin-deep a domestic animal; and so with your canary, which in  death alone would be free, and beats his failing wings against the  cage in which he lived so long content. But these all go away singly,  each to his own place. The caribou is the only animal I know that  remembers, when his separation comes, the ties which bound him to the  herd winter after winter, through sun and storm, in the forest where  all was peace and plenty, and on the lonely barrens where the gray  wolf howled on his track; so that he turns with his last strength from  the herd he is leaving to the greater herd which has gone before  him--still following his leaders, remembering his first lesson to the  end.    Sometimes I have wondered whether this also were taught in the caribou  school; whether once in his life Megaleep were led to the spot and  made to pass through it, so that he should feel its meaning and  remember. That is not likely; for the one thing which an animal cannot  understand is death. And there were no signs of living caribou  anywhere near the place that I discovered; though down at the other  end of the lake their tracks were everywhere.    There are other questions, which one can only ask without answering.  Is this silent gathering merely a tribute to the old law of the herd,  or does Megaleep, with his last strength, still think to cheat his old  enemy, and go away where the wolf that followed him all his life shall  not find him? How was his resting place first selected, and what  leaders searched out the ground? What sound or sign, what murmur of  wind in the pines, or lap of ripples on the shore, or song of the  veery at twilight made them pause and say, _Here is the place_? How  does he know, he whose thoughts are all of life, and who never looked  on death, where the great silent herd is that no caribou ever sees but  once? And what strange instinct guides Megaleep to the spot where all  his wanderings end at last?          II. KILLOOLEET, LITTLE SWEET-VOICE.    [Illustration: Killooleet]      The day was cold, the woods were wet, and the weather was beastly  altogether when Killooleet first came and sang on my ridgepole. The  fishing was poor down in the big lake, and there were signs of  civilization here and there, in the shape of settlers' cabins, which  we did not like; so we had pushed up river, Simmo and I, thirty miles  in the rain, to a favorite camping ground on a smaller lake, where we  had the wilderness all to ourselves.    The rain was still falling, and the lake white-capped, and the forest  all misty and wind-blown when we ran our canoes ashore by the old  cedar that marked our landing place. First we built a big fire to  dry some boughs to sleep upon; then we built our houses, Simmo a  bark _commoosie_, and I a little tent; and I was inside, getting  dry clothes out of a rubber bag, when I heard a white-throated  sparrow calling cheerily his Indian name, _O hear, sweet  Killooleet-lillooleet-lillooleet!_ And the sound was so sunny, so good  to hear in the steady drip of rain on the roof, that I went out to see  the little fellow who had bid us welcome to the wilderness.    Simmo had heard too. He was on his hands and knees, just his dark face  peering by the corner stake of his _commoosie_, so as to see better  the little singer on my tent.--\"Have better weather and better luck  now. Killooleet sing on ridgepole,\" he said confidently. Then we  spread some cracker crumbs for the guest and turned in to sleep till  better times.    That was the beginning of a long acquaintance. It was also the first  of many social calls from a whole colony of white-throats (Tom-Peabody  birds) that lived on the mountain-side just behind my tent, and that  came one by one to sing"]]]
