No, I'll tell you this time. Listen: I know a spot where the  sugar-cane grows thick.    CAMEL. Tell me! I cannot wait! Tell me!    JACKAL. I cannot. I'll have to show you.

Where has "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16399"],[0,"A Winter Tour in South Africa (#4)"],[1,"Empire.'\"    To anyone visiting, for the first time, this great centre of the diamond  industry of South Africa the scene is most extraordinary. The excitement  and bustle, the wild whirl of vehicular traffic, the fearful dust, the  ceaseless movement of men and women of all descriptions, and of every  shade of complexion and colour, are positively bewildering. The thoughts  of everybody appear to be centred in diamonds, and the prevailing talk  and speech are accordingly. Being the recipient, myself, of the most  kind attention and genial and generous hospitality, my stay was most  agreeable, and pleasant. Great facilities were afforded me for seeing  everything connected with this wonderful industry, and satisfying  myself, that there are no present signs of its being exhausted or  \"played out.\" Indubitable evidences were given me, that diamonds  continue to be found in as large quantities as ever. They appeared to me  to be \"as plentiful as blackberries.\"    At the Bultfontein Mine I descended to the bottom of the open workings  in one of the iron buckets, used for bringing up the \"blue ground\" to  the surface. This is rather a perilous adventure. To go down by a wire  rope, some five or six hundred feet perpendicular into the bowels of the  earth with lightning rapidity, standing up in an open receptacle, the  top of which does not approach your waist, oscillating like a pendulum,  while you are holding on \"like grim death\" by your hands, is something  more than a joke. It certainly ought not to be attempted by anyone who  does not possess a cool head and tolerable nerve.    Here I saw multitudes of natives employed,--as afterwards in the De  Beer's, the Kimberley, and other diamond mines,--with pickaxes, shovels,  and other tools, breaking down the ground at the sides of the mine,  perched at various spots, and many a giddy height. Diamond mining at  Kimberley is altogether a very wonderful specimen of the development of  a new industry. In this mine I had explained to me the various  processes, by which diamonds are discovered in the rocky strata which is  being constantly dug out of the enormous circular hole, constituting it.    I also visited the celebrated De Beer's Mine. This vast mine, where some  thousands of workmen, white and coloured, are employed, is carried on  much in the same way as the Bultfontein, as far as the different  processes are concerned, of treating the material in which the diamonds  are found. It is much richer, however, in \"blue ground,\" and  consequently far more valuable results are obtained from it. For  instance, the average value of each truck load of stuff from the  Bultfontein is said to be about 8s., while from the De Beer's it is  28s. or 30s. The latter mine is now worked underground, in the same way  as copper and coal mines are worked in England. Excellent arrangements  are made for the protection and well-being of the native workmen,  especially by the introduction of \"compounds\" during the last year or  two. These are vast enclosures, with high walls, where the natives  compulsorily reside, after their daily work is done during the whole  time they remain at work in the mine. This system has been attended with  the most satisfactory results. I went over the De Beer's \"compound,\"  where I saw an immense number of natives, all appearing lively,  cheerful, and happy. A large number were playing at cards (they are  great gamblers), and others amusing themselves in various ways. No  intoxicating liquor is permitted to be sold within the \"compounds.\" The  weekly receipts for ginger beer amount to a sum, which seems fabulous,  averaging from L60 to L100 a week. The natives can purchase from the  \"compound\" store every possible thing they want, from a tinpot to a  blanket, from a suit of old clothes to a pannikin of mealies. Before the  establishment of the \"compounds,\" when the natives had the free run of  the town, and could obtain alcoholic liquor--on Saturday nights  especially, after they had done their work and received their weekly  wages--Kimberley was a perfect pandemonium.    An interesting visit was one to the central offices of the United  Companies, where I saw the diamonds, as they are prepared ready for  sale, lying on a counter in small assorted lots, on white paper. This is  a most remarkable sight. The lots, varying from half-a-dozen to twenty,  or thirty, or more diamonds, are spread out arranged according to their  estimated value. I took up one, which I was told would probably fetch  L1,000, and of which there were several similar ones in the different  parcels on the counter. The manager showed me a paper of a sale to the  buyers, a day or two before, of a parcel, which was calculated to  realise L14,189, and which actually was sold afterwards for L14,150;  showing the surprising accuracy of the previous estimate on the part of  the experts.    Another day I went to the Central Kimberley Diamond Mine. After going  over the mine, my party and myself all \"assisted\" at the counter in one  of the large sheds in picking out diamonds from the heap of small stones  just brought up and laid out from the day's washings. It is rather a  fascinating occupation, turning over the heap with a little triangular  piece of tin held in one hand, and continually \"scraped\" along the  board. I found several diamonds. We were told, after we had been  working diligently for an hour or two--there were six of us--that the  value of the diamonds we had found, and placed in the manager's box, was  probably L1,200. This seemed to us a good afternoon's work. The entire  district of Kimberley seems to teem with diamonds, and yet there is no  cessation in the demand for them, and they are still rising in price.  Accidents are frequent at these mines, but excellent provision for  meeting these misfortunes is made in the admirably conducted Kimberley  Hospital (where there are no less than 360 beds for patients), which I  visited during my stay. It is under the management of a very remarkable  woman, Sister Henrietta, and reflects the greatest credit on everyone  connected with its conduct, and support. The number of native cases  treated at the Hospital during the year 1887 was 2,975.    Kimberley has risen with immense speed, commencing from what is  generally known as a \"rush,\" to a large and prosperous centre of wealth,  trade, and commerce. There, where only a few years since, was to be  found a collection of tents and small huts, I found a city with handsome  buildings, churches, stores, institutions, and law courts, and, above  all, a well ordered society. Some of the buildings which I might  specially mention, are the Town Hall, the Post Office, the High Court,  and the Public Library, which has been in existence about seven years,  and is superintended with such excellent results and most gratifying  success by the Judge President. One noticeable fact connected with this  Library is that the number of works of fiction annually taken out by the  subscribers, exceeds, per head of the population, that of any Public  Library in the United Kingdom.    The Kimberley Waterworks, which I also visited, have proved a great boon  to this part, of the Colony. They were erected at a cost of L400,000,  the water supply being obtained from the Vaal River, seventeen miles  away.    After spending a most pleasant and agreeable week there, I left  Kimberley at six o'clock on the morning of June 7, in a wagon drawn by  eight horses, and accompanied by five friends, for Warrenton, _en route_  for Bechuanaland and the Transvaal. This mode of travelling was quite a  novelty to me. Although in this journey of altogether three weeks'  duration, we occasionally put up at one or two hotels, at some of the  towns, and sometimes at the farmhouses on our way, we frequently \"camped  out\" on the open veldt, and, after finishing our evening meal of the  rough-and-ready provisions we carried with us, supplemented by the game  we shot, we wrapped ourselves in our karosses, and slept for the night  under the canopy of the starlit sky. I occupied the wagon, my more  juvenile companions lying on the ground beneath it.    This was my first experience of sleeping in the open air in a wagon, and  this, too, in the depth of a South African winter.    The town of Warrenton is situated on the banks of the Vaal River, and is  forty-three miles north of Kimberley. It is at present an unimportant  town, but diamond diggings have been recently opened, and it is a good  cattle district. It took its name from Sir Charles Warren. Soon after  leaving Warrenton we crossed the Vaal River on a pontoon. Here a trooper  of the Mounted Police joined us, who was said to be a very crack shot.  He rode a charming and well-bred grey horse, and had two admirably  trained pointers with him. He offered me his horse to ride, he taking  my place in the wagon. I had a most enjoyable morning's ride on one of  the best little hacks I ever mounted, cantering over the veldt in the  track of the wagon for about eight or ten miles--through a charming  country with a superb view towards Bechuanaland, the veldt being more  wooded and picturesque, than I had hitherto seen.    We slept that night at Drake's Farm. Before starting the next morning, I  had a long conversation with Mr. Drake. He was born and brought up in  London, and was in business with the firm of Moses & Son, of Cheapside,  as a traveller. He came out here nine years ago with L10 in his pocket,  and travelled up from Port Elizabeth. Mr. Drake is evidently a man of  great energy, and perseverance. He has a high opinion of the country,  and a great idea of its future. His farm and store are situated on the  borders of Bechuanaland; but he now wishes he had settled there, even in  preference to where he is. He laughs at the idea of there being no  water. He says there is plenty to be found at from seventeen to  twenty-five feet below the surface. But he says it must be dug"]]]
