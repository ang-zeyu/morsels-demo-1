[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/164"],[0,"Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea (#4)"],[1,"   I am portraying this hardy companion as I really knew him.  We are old  friends now, united in that unchangeable friendship which is born and  cemented amidst extreme dangers.  Ah, brave Ned!  I ask no more than to  live a hundred years longer, that I may have more time to dwell the  longer on your memory.    Now, what was Ned Land's opinion upon the question of the marine  monster?  I must admit that he did not believe in the unicorn, and was  the only one on board who did not share that universal conviction.  He  even avoided the subject, which I one day thought it my duty to press  upon him.  One magnificent evening, the 30th July (that is to say,  three weeks after our departure), the frigate was abreast of Cape  Blanc, thirty miles to leeward of the coast of Patagonia.  We had  crossed the tropic of Capricorn, and the Straits of Magellan opened  less than seven hundred miles to the south.  Before eight days were  over the Abraham Lincoln would be ploughing the waters of the Pacific.    Seated on the poop, Ned Land and I were chatting of one thing and  another as we looked at this mysterious sea, whose great depths had up  to this time been inaccessible to the eye of man.  I naturally led up  the conversation to the giant unicorn, and examined the various chances  of success or failure of the expedition.  But, seeing that Ned Land let  me speak without saying too much himself, I pressed him more closely.    \"Well, Ned,\" said I, \"is it possible that you are not convinced of the  existence of this cetacean that we are following?  Have you any  particular reason for being so incredulous?\"    The harpooner looked at me fixedly for some moments before answering,  struck his broad forehead with his hand (a habit of his), as if to  collect himself, and said at last, \"Perhaps I have, Mr. Aronnax.\"    \"But, Ned, you, a whaler by profession, familiarised with all the great  marine mammalia--YOU ought to be the last to doubt under such  circumstances!\"    \"That is just what deceives you, Professor,\" replied Ned.  \"As a whaler  I have followed many a cetacean, harpooned a great number, and killed  several; but, however strong or well-armed they may have been, neither  their tails nor their weapons would have been able even to scratch the  iron plates of a steamer.\"    \"But, Ned, they tell of ships which the teeth of the narwhal have  pierced through and through.\"    \"Wooden ships--that is possible,\" replied the Canadian, \"but I have  never seen it done; and, until further proof, I deny that whales,  cetaceans, or sea-unicorns could ever produce the effect you describe.\"    \"Well, Ned, I repeat it with a conviction resting on the logic of  facts.  I believe in the existence of a mammal power fully organised,  belonging to the branch of vertebrata, like the whales, the cachalots,  or the dolphins, and furnished with a horn of defence of great  penetrating power.\"    \"Hum!\" said the harpooner, shaking his head with the air of a man who  would not be convinced.    \"Notice one thing, my worthy Canadian,\" I resumed.  \"If such an animal  is in existence, if it inhabits the depths of the ocean, if it  frequents the strata lying miles below the surface of the water, it  must necessarily possess an organisation the strength of which would  defy all comparison.\"    \"And why this powerful organisation?\" demanded Ned.    \"Because it requires incalculable strength to keep one's self in these  strata and resist their pressure.  Listen to me.  Let us admit that the  pressure of the atmosphere is represented by the weight of a column of  water thirty-two feet high.  In reality the column of water would be  shorter, as we are speaking of sea water, the density of which is  greater than that of fresh water.  Very well, when you dive, Ned, as  many times 32 feet of water as there are above you, so many times does  your body bear a pressure equal to that of the atmosphere, that is to  say, 15 lb. for each square inch of its surface.  It follows, then,  that at 320 feet this pressure equals that of 10 atmospheres, of 100  atmospheres at 3,200 feet, and of 1,000 atmospheres at 32,000 feet,  that is, about 6 miles; which is equivalent to saying that if you could  attain this depth in the ocean, each square three-eighths of an inch of  the surface of your body would bear a pressure of 5,600 lb.  Ah! my  brave Ned, do you know how many square inches you carry on the surface  of your body?\"    \"I have no idea, Mr. Aronnax.\"    \"About 6,500; and as in reality the atmospheric pressure is about 15  lb.  to the square inch, your 6,500 square inches bear at this moment a  pressure of 97,500 lb.\"    \"Without my perceiving it?\"    \"Without your perceiving it.  And if you are not crushed by such a  pressure, it is because the air penetrates the interior of your body  with equal pressure.  Hence perfect equilibrium between the interior  and exterior pressure, which thus neutralise each other, and which  allows you to bear it without inconvenience.  But in the water it is  another thing.\"    \"Yes, I understand,\" replied Ned, becoming more attentive; \"because the  water surrounds me, but does not penetrate.\"    \"Precisely, Ned:  so that at 32 feet beneath the surface of the sea you  would undergo a pressure of 97,500 lb.; at 320 feet, ten times that  pressure; at 3,200 feet, a hundred times that pressure; lastly, at  32,000 feet, a thousand times that pressure would be 97,500,000  lb.--that is to say, that you would be flattened as if you had been  drawn from the plates of a hydraulic machine!\"    \"The devil!\" exclaimed Ned.    \"Very well, my worthy harpooner, if some vertebrate, several hundred  yards long, and large in proportion, can maintain itself in such  depths--of those whose surface is represented by millions of square  inches, that is by tens of millions of pounds, we must estimate the  pressure they undergo.  Consider, then, what must be the resistance of  their bony structure, and the strength of their organisation to  withstand such pressure!\"    \"Why!\" exclaimed Ned Land, \"they must be made of iron plates eight  inches thick, like the armoured frigates.\"    \"As you say, Ned.  And think what destruction such a mass would cause,  if hurled with the speed of an express train against the hull of a  vessel.\"    \"Yes--certainly--perhaps,\" replied the Canadian, shaken by these  figures, but not yet willing to give in.    \"Well, have I convinced you?\"    \"You have convinced me of one thing, sir, which is that, if such  animals do exist at the bottom of the seas, they must necessarily be as  strong as you say.\"    \"But if they do not exist, mine obstinate harpooner, how explain the  accident to the Scotia?\"        CHAPTER V    AT A VENTURE    The voyage of the Abraham Lincoln was for a long time marked by no  special incident.  But one circumstance happened which showed the  wonderful dexterity of Ned Land, and proved what confidence we might  place in him.    The 30th of June, the frigate spoke some American whalers, from whom we  learned that they knew nothing about the narwhal.  But one of them, the  captain of the Monroe, knowing that Ned Land had shipped on board the  Abraham Lincoln, begged for his help in chasing a whale they had in  sight.  Commander Farragut, desirous of seeing Ned Land at work, gave  him permission to go on board the Monroe.  And fate served our Canadian  so well that, instead of one whale, he harpooned two with a double  blow, striking one straight to the heart, and catching the other after  some minutes' pursuit.    Decidedly, if the monster ever had to do with Ned Land's harpoon, I  would not bet in its favour.    The frigate skirted the south-east coast of America with great  rapidity.  The 3rd of July we were at the opening of the Straits of  Magellan, level with Cape Vierges.  But Commander Farragut would not  take a tortuous passage, but doubled Cape Horn.    The ship's crew agreed with him.  And certainly it was possible that  they might meet the narwhal in this narrow pass.  Many of the sailors  affirmed that the monster could not pass there, \"that he was too big  for that!\"    The 6th of July, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the Abraham  Lincoln, at fifteen miles to the south, doubled the solitary island,  this lost rock at the extremity of the American continent, to which  some Dutch sailors gave the name of their native town, Cape Horn.  The  course was taken towards the north-west, and the next day the screw of  the frigate was at last beating the waters of the Pacific.    \"Keep your eyes open!\" called out the sailors.    And they were opened widely.  Both eyes and glasses, a little dazzled,  it is true, by the prospect of two thousand dollars, had not an  instant's repose.    I myself, for whom money had no charms, was not the least attentive on  board.  Giving but few minutes to my meals, but a few hours to sleep,  indifferent to either rain or sunshine, I did not leave the poop of the  vessel.  Now leaning on the netting of the forecastle, now on the  taffrail, I devoured with eagerness the soft foam which whitened the  sea as far as the eye could reach; and how often have I shared the  emotion of the majority of the crew, when some capricious whale raised  its black back above the waves!  The poop of the vessel was crowded on  a moment.  The cabins poured forth a torrent of sailors and officers,  each with heaving breast and troubled eye watching the course of the  cetacean.  I looked and looked till I was nearly blind, whilst Conseil  kept repeating in a calm voice:    \"If, sir, you would not squint so much, you would see better!\"    But vain excitement!  The Abraham Lincoln checked its speed and made  for the animal signalled, a simple whale, or common cachalot, which  soon disappeared amidst a storm of abuse.    But the weather was good.  The voyage was being accomplished under the  most favourable auspices.  It was then the bad season in Australia, the  July of that zone corresponding to our"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16410"],[0,"The Life-Story of Insects (#4)"],[1,"view; _d_, feeler of larva;  _e_, female, ventral view. After Howard, _Yearbook U.S. Dept. Agric._  1904. Magnified, _a, c, e_ x 20; _b, d_ x 120.]    Another family allied to the Aphidae is that of the Cicads, hardly  represented in our fauna but abundant in many of the warmer regions of  the earth. Here also the young insect differs widely from its parent in  form, living underground and being provided with strong fore-legs for  digging in the soil. After a long subterranean existence, usually  extending over several years, the insect attains the penultimate stage  of its life-story, during which it rests passively within an earthen  cell, awaiting the final moult, which will usher in its winged and  perfect state.    In the life-histories of cicads and coccids, then, there are some  features which recall those of the caterpillar's transformation into the  butterfly. The newly-hatched insect is externally so unlike its parent  that it may be styled a larva. The penultimate instar is quiescent and  does not feed. But while the caterpillar shows throughout its life no  outward trace of wings, external wing-rudiments are evident in the young  stages of the cicad. In the male coccid we find a late larval stage with  hidden wing-rudiments, the importance of which, for comparison with the  caterpillar, will be appreciated later.          CHAPTER IV    FROM WATER TO AIR      Insects as a whole are preeminently creatures of the land and the air.  This is shown not only by the possession of wings by a vast majority of  the class, but by the mode of breathing to which reference has already  been made (p. 2), a system of branching air-tubes carrying atmospheric  air with its combustion-supporting oxygen to all the insect's tissues.  The air gains access to these tubes through a number of paired air-holes  or spiracles, arranged segmentally in series.    It is of great interest to find that, nevertheless, a number of insects  spend much of their time under water. This is true of not a few in the  perfect winged state, as for example aquatic beetles and water-bugs  ('boatmen' and 'scorpions') which have some way of protecting their  spiracles when submerged, and, possessing usually the power of flight,  can pass on occasion from pond or stream to upper air. But it is  advisable in connection with our present subject to dwell especially on  some insects that remain continually under water till they are ready to  undergo their final moult and attain the winged state, which they pass  entirely in the air. The preparatory instars of such insects are  aquatic; the adult instar is aerial. All may-flies, dragon-flies, and  caddis-flies, many beetles and two-winged flies, and a few moths thus  divide their life-story between the water and the air. For the present  we confine attention to the Stone-flies, the May-flies, and the  Dragon-flies, three well-known orders of insects respectively called by  systematists the Plecoptera, the Ephemeroptera and the Odonata.    In the case of many insects that have aquatic larvae, the latter are  provided with some arrangement for enabling them to reach atmospheric  air through the surface-film of the water. But the larva of a stone-fly,  a dragon-fly, or a may-fly is adapted more completely than these for  aquatic life; it can, by means of gills of some kind, breathe the air  dissolved in water.    The aquatic young of a stone-fly does not differ sufficiently in form  from its parent to warrant us in calling it a larva; the life-history is  like that of a cockroach, all the instars however except the final  one--the winged adult or _imago_--live in the water. The young of one of  our large species, a Perla for example, has well-chitinised cuticle,  broad head, powerful legs, long feelers and cerci like those of the  imago; its wings arise from external rudiments, which are conspicuous in  the later aquatic stages. But it lives completely submerged, usually  clinging or walking beneath the stones that lie in the bed of a clear  stream, and examination of the ventral aspect of the thorax reveals six  pairs of tufted gills, by means of which it is able to breathe the air  dissolved in the water wherein it lives. At the base of the tail-feelers  or cerci also, there are little tufts of thread-like gills as J.A.  Palmen (1877) has shown. An insect that is continually submerged and has  no contact with the upper air cannot breathe through a series of paired  spiracles, and during the aquatic life-period of the stone-fly these  remain closed. Nevertheless, breathing is carried on by means of the  ordinary system of branching air-tubes, the trunks of which are in  connection with the tufted hollow gill-filaments, through whose delicate  cuticle gaseous exchange can take place, though the method of this  exchange is as yet very imperfectly understood. When the stone-fly nymph  is fully grown, it comes out of the water and climbs to some convenient  eminence. The cuticle splits open along the back, and the imago, clothed  in its new cuticle, as yet soft and flexible, creeps out. The spiracles  are now open, and the stone-fly breathes atmospheric air like other  flying insects. But throughout its winged life, the stone-fly bears  memorials of its aquatic past in the little withered vestiges of gills  that can still be distinguished beneath the thorax.    The adult dragon-fly (fig. 8 _d_) is specialised in such a way that it  captures its prey--flies and other small insects--on the wing, swooping  through the air like a hawk and feeding voraciously. The head is  remarkable for its large globular compound eyes, its short bristle-like  feelers, and its very strong mandibles which bite up the bodies of the  victims. The thorax bears the two pairs of ample wings, firm and almost  glassy in texture, and its segments are projected forward ventrally, so  that all six legs, which are armed with rows of sharp, slender spines,  can be held in front of the mouth, where they form an effective  fly-trap. The abdomen is very long and usually narrow.    A female dragon-fly after a remarkable mode of pairing, the details of  which are beside our present subject, drops her eggs in the water, or  lays them on water-weeds, perhaps cutting an incision where they can be  the more safely lodged, or even goes down below the surface and deposits  them in the mud at the bottom of a pond. From the eggs are hatched the  aquatic larvae which differ in many respects from the imago. The  dragon-fly larva has the same predaceous mode of life as its parent, but  it is sluggish in habit, lurking for its prey at the bottom of the pond,  among the mud or vegetation, which it resembles in colour. The thoracic  segments have not the specialisation that they show in the imago; the  abdomen is relatively shorter and broader. The larval head has, like  that of the imago, short feelers, and the eyes are somewhat large,  though far from attaining the size of the great globular eyes of the  dragon-fly. But the third pair of jaws, forming the labium, are most  remarkably modified into a 'mask,' the distal central portion (mentum)  being hinged to the basal piece (sub-mentum) which is itself jointed  below the head. The mentum carries at its extremity a pair of lobes with  sharp fangs. Thus the mask can be folded under the head when the larva  lurks in its hiding place, or be suddenly darted out so as to secure any  unwary small insect that may pass close enough for capture. Dragon-fly  larvae walk, and also swim by movements of the abdomen or by expelling a  jet of water from the hind-gut. The walls of this terminal region of the  intestine have areas lined with delicate cuticle and traversed by  numerous air-tubes, so that gaseous exchange can take place between the  air in the tubes and that dissolved in the water. The larvae of the  larger and heavier dragon-flies (Libellulidae and Aeschnidae) breathe  mostly in this way. Those of the slender and delicate 'Demoiselles'  (Agrionidae) are provided with three leaf-like gill-plates at the tail,  between whose delicate surfaces numerous air-tubes ramify. These  gill-plates are at times used for propulsion. Thus air supply is ensured  during aquatic life. But occasionally, when the water in which the  larva lives is foul and poor in oxygen, the tail is thrust out of the  water so that air can be admitted directly into the intestinal chamber.  The aquatic life of these insects lasts for more than a year, and F.  Balfour-Browne (1909) has observed from ten to fourteen moults in  Agrion. Outward wing-rudiments are early visible on the thoracic  segments; when these have become conspicuous the insect, beginning in  some respects to approach the adult condition, is often called a nymph.  In an advanced dragon-fly nymph, H. Dewitz (1891) has shown that the  thoracic spiracles are open, and, as the time for its final moult draws  near, the insect may thrust the front part of its body out of the water,  and breathe atmospheric air through these. Thus before the great change  takes place the nymph has foretastes of the aerial mode of breathing  which it will practise when the perfect stage shall have been attained.  The emergence of the dragon-fly from its nymph-cuticle has been  described by many naturalists from de Reaumur (1740) to L.C. Miall  (1895) and O.H. Latter (1904). The nymph climbs out of the water by  ascending some aquatic plant, and awaits the change so graphically  sketched by Tennyson:        A hidden impulse rent the veil,      Of his old husk, from head to tail,      Came out clear plates of sapphire mail.    'From head to tail,' for the nymph-cuticle splits lengthwise down the  back, and the head and thorax of the imago are freed from it (fig. 8  _a_), then the legs clasp the empty cuticle, and the abdomen is drawn  out (fig. 8 _b, c_). After a short rest, the newly-emerged fly climbs  yet higher up the water-weed, and remains for some hours with the  abdomen bent concave"]]]
