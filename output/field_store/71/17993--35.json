The purpose of the jack is to communicate the motion  of the wippen to the hammer. The precise adjustment of the jack and  the adjacent parts upon which it depends for its exact movements, play  an important part in regulating the \"touch\" of the piano, and will be  fully entered into in following lessons.    _js_, jack spring. Its purpose is to hold the jack inward against the  \"nose\" or \"heel\" of the hammer butt. (See _Bt_, hammer butt.)    _Rr_, regulating rail. The _regulating button_ is shown attached to  the rail by the regulating screw which is turned by means of its ring  on top of _Rr_. The purpose of the regulating button is to throw the  point of the jack out of the nose of the hammer butt, and allow the  hammer to rebound from the string. If the button is too high, it does  not throw or trip the jack in time to prevent blocking. When the  button is too low, it disengages too soon, and much of the force of  the key is lost before it reaches the hammer.    _BR_, is the block rail, felted on the side next to the jack which  strikes against it when thrown from nose. This rail is absent in some  actions, in which case the back of the jack is felted and strikes  against the \"back catch,\" which is also felted on inner side. (The  back catch has no mark in the cut, but is explained below in  connection with the \"back check.\")    _BC_, is the back check which is simply a piece of wood with a thick  piece of felt glued to the inner face and suspended on a wire.    _BCW_, back check wire supporting the back check, and screwed to the  wippen. The purpose of the back check is to check the hammer by coming  in contact with the \"back catch\" (the backward projection of the  butt), at a short distance from the string in its return, and prevent  the hammer from falling entirely back to its rest position, thereby  preventing quick repetition.    _Bl_, bridle. This is a piece of tape about an eighth of an inch wide  with a piece of leather glued to the end and a hole near the end for  the point of the \"stirrup\" or bridle wire. The cut shows where the  bridle is fastened in the hammer butt by being put into the hole in  the butt, and the back catch stem covered with glue and driven in by  it which precludes all possibility of its coming loose. The bridle  passes through a hole in the lower part of the back catch. Its purpose  is to assist the hammer to return quickly by hanging to it with the  weight of the wippen, extension, jack, etc., when the key is released.  Thus the bridle becomes the main factor in the matter of quick  repetition.    _Bl W_, bridle wire, screwed into wippen, bent in the shape of a  buckle at top to hold bridle.    _Bt_, butt; or, more specifically, hammer butt. In some cheap actions  the butt is joined to its flange _g_, by the means described under the  head of wippen flange; but in this action the center-pin is held  firmly in the butt by a small strip of brass containing a set screw;  somewhat obscure in the cut, but discernible. As explained elsewhere,  all center-pins turn in the flange and not in the middle part.    _HS_, hammer shank in rest position.    _H_, hammer showing wood body or head, and covering of two layers of  felt.    _H R_, hammer rail, resting on felt cushion, _c_, glued to rail or  bracket. The hammer rail is held in position by the rod, shown under  the hammer shank, which is hinged to the bracket at the lower end, and  which allows it to be moved forward when the soft pedal is used. The  soft pedal communicates with this rail by a rod which moves it forward  and thereby shortens the stroke of the hammers and produces a softer  tone.    _sr_, spring rail screwed to the brackets. This rail supports the  light wire springs which assist the hammers in returning to rest  position.    _S_, string.    _D_, is the damper head secured to the damper wire by a set screw.    _DL_, damper lever, working in damper flange _g_, which is screwed to  main rail.    _s_, spoon; so called from its shape. It is screwed into the wippen.  When the key is struck, the motion on the wippen throws the spoon  forward, pushing the lower end of damper lever forward, and releasing  the damper from its contact with the string. The damper is held  against the string by the wire spring which is seen running from the  damper flange to the top of the damper lever.    _DR_, damper rod. This is a rod running from the left or bass end of  the action to the right as far as the dampers are continued in the  treble. It is acted upon by the \"loud\" or damper pedal, which raises  the outer projection, and by being hinged to the main rail about the  same height as this projection, the entire rod is thrown outward  against the lower ends of the damper levers, releasing all the dampers  simultaneously. This being the only office of the right pedal, it is  readily seen that this pedal does not increase the loudness, but  simply _sustains_ any number of tones struck successively, giving the  effect of more volume.    The student should familiarize himself with all technical terms used  in this lesson, as they will be referred to frequently in the  succeeding lessons on repairing and regulating.      QUESTIONS ON LESSON III.    Without reference to anything but the cut, give technical names for  parts of action represented by the following letters or abbreviations:        1.

LESSON IV.    ~ACTION OF SQUARE AND GRAND PIANOS.~      ACTION OF THE SQUARE PIANO.    Up to about the year 1870, the square was the popular piano. The grand  has always been too expensive for the great music-loving masses, and  previous to this time the upright had not been developed sufficiently  to assert itself as a satisfactory instrument. The numerous objections  to the square piano forced its manufacture to be discontinued a few  years after the introduction of the improved new upright. Square  pianos that come, at the present day, under the hand of the tuner, are  usually at least fifteen years old, and more frequently twenty or  more. However, in some localities the tuner will meet numbers of these  pianos and he will find them a great source of revenue, as they are  almost invariably in need of repair.    Compare the three cuts of actions in the study of this lesson.    The main constituent parts of the square action are similar in  appearance to those of the upright; in fact, most of the parts are  the same in name and office. However, the parts are necessarily  assembled very differently. In the square action, the hammers strike  in a vertical direction, while in the upright they strike in a  horizontal direction; the motion of the key being the same in both.    Of the three types, the square is the simplest action, as many of the  parts seen in the upright and grand are entirely absent in the square.    Beginning with the key, it has its balance pin, guide pin, cushions,  etc., practically the same as in the other types.    The bottom, or key rocker, is reversed in the square; the end  transmitting the motion being nearest the performer.    The extension and wippen are absent in the square, as the jack is  attached directly to the bottom or key-rocker.    The back check is screwed to the key, and as the hammer head rests  against it after striking, the use of the contrivance called the back  catch in the upright is unnecessary.

The cut is from the French action. Nearly all square pianos in       use at the present time are of this type.    The hammer rail in the square, in addition to serving its purpose as  a rest for the hammers, also serves the purpose of the regulating  rail, as you will see the regulating screw, with its button, attached  to it. This rail is stationary in the square, not moving toward the  strings and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17575"],[0,"How to Camp Out (#4)"],[1," perhaps tax your judgment and capability as much as  any thing in all your preparation; and on this point, where you need so  much good advice, I can only give you that of a general nature.    The time for camping out is when horses are in greatest demand for  farming purposes; and you will find it difficult to hire of any one  except livery-stable men, whose charges are so high that you cannot  afford to deal with them. You will have to hunt a long time, and in many  places, before you will find your animal. It is not prudent to take a  valuable horse, and I advise you not to do so unless the owner or a man  _thoroughly_ acquainted with horses is in the party. You may perhaps be  able to hire horse, wagon, and driver; but a hired man is an  objectionable feature, for, besides the expense, such a man is usually  disagreeable company.    My own experience is, that it is cheaper to buy a horse outright, and to  hire a harness and wagon; and, since I am not a judge of horse-flesh, I  get some friend who is, to go with me and advise. I find that I can  almost always buy a horse, even when I cannot hire. Twenty to fifty  dollars will bring as good an animal as I need. He may be old, broken  down, spavined, wind-broken, or lame; but if he is not sickly, or if his  lameness is not from recent injury, it is not hard for him to haul a  fair load ten or fifteen miles a day, when he is helped over the hard  places.    So now, if you pay fifty dollars for a horse, you can expect to sell him  for about twenty or twenty-five dollars, unless you were greatly  cheated, or have abused your brute while on the trip, both of which  errors you must be careful to avoid. It is a simple matter of arithmetic  to calculate what is best for you to do; but I hope on this horse  question you may have the benefit of advice from some one who has had  experience with the ways of the world. You will need it very much.      WAGONS.    If you have the choice of wagons, take one that is made for carrying  light, bulky goods, for your baggage will be of that order. One with a  large body and high sides, or a covered wagon, will answer. In districts  where the roads are mountainous, rough, and rocky, wagons hung on  thoroughbraces appear to suit the people the best; but you will have no  serious difficulty with good steel springs if you put in rubber bumpers,  and also strap the body to the axles, thus preventing the violent  shutting and opening of the springs; for you must bear in mind that the  main leaf of a steel spring is apt to break by the sudden pitching  upward of the wagon-body.    It has been my fortune twice to have to carry large loads in small  low-sided wagons; and it proved very convenient to have two or three  half-barrels to keep food and small articles in, and to roll the bedding  in rolls three or four feet wide, which were packed in the wagon upon  their ends. The private baggage was carried in meal-bags, and the tents  in bags made expressly to hold them; we could thus load the wagon  securely with but little tying.    For wagons with small and low bodies, it would be well to put a light  rail fourteen to eighteen inches above the sides, and hold it there by  six or eight posts resting on the floor, and confined to the sides of  the body.    Drive carefully and slowly over bad places. It makes a great deal of  difference whether a wheel strikes a rock with the horse going at a  trot, or at a walk.      HARNESS.    If your load is heavy, and the roads very hard, or the daily distance  long, you had better have a collar for the horse: otherwise a  breastplate-harness will do. In your kit of tools it is well to have a  few straps, an awl, and waxed ends, against the time that something  breaks. Oil the harness before you start, and carry about a pint of  neat's-foot oil, which you can also use upon the men's boots. At night  look out that the harness and all of your baggage are sheltered from dew  and rain, rats and mice.      ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF THIS MODE OF TRAVEL.    This way of travelling is peculiarly adapted to a party of different  ages, rather than for one exclusively of young men. It is especially  suitable where there are ladies who wish to walk and camp, or for an  entire family, or for a school with its teachers. The necessity of a  head to a party will hardly be recognized by young men; and, even if it  is, they are still unwilling, as a general rule, to submit to  unaccustomed restraint.    The way out of this difficulty is for one man to invite his comrades to  join his party, and to make all the others understand, from first to  last, that they are indebted to him for the privilege of going. It is  then somewhat natural for the invited guests to look to their leader,  and to be content with his decisions.    The best of men get into foolish dissensions when off on a jaunt, unless  there is one, whose voice has authority in it, to direct the movements.    I knew a party of twenty or more that travelled in this way, and were  directed by a trio composed of two gentlemen and one lady. This  arrangement proved satisfactory to all concerned.[5]    It has been assumed in all cases that some one will lead the horse,--not  ride in the loaded wagon,--and that two others will go behind and not  far off, to help the horse over the very difficult places, as well as to  have an eye on the load, that none of it is lost off, or scrapes against  the wheels. Whoever leads must be careful not to fall under the horse or  wagon, nor to fall under the horse's feet, should he stumble. These are  daily and hourly risks: hence no small boy should take this duty.[6]    FOOTNOTES:    [5] I never heard of a party exclusively of young men going on a tour of  this kind, and consequently I cannot write their experiences; but I can  easily imagine their troubles, quarrels, and separation into cliques. I  once went as captain of a party of ten, composed of ladies, gentlemen,  and schoolboys. We walked around the White Mountains from North Conway  to Jefferson and back, by way of Jackson. It cost each of us a dollar  and thirty-two cents a day for sixteen days, including railroad fares to  and from Portland, but excluding the cost of clothes, tents, and  cooking-utensils. Another time a similar party of twelve walked from  Centre Harbor, N.H., to Bethel, Me., in seventeen days, at a daily cost  of a dollar and two cents, reckoning as before. In both cases, \"my right  there was none to dispute;\" and by borrowing a horse the first time, and  selling at a loss of only five dollars the second, our expenses for the  horse were small.    [6] In one of my tours around the mountains, a lad of sixteen, in  attempting to hold up the horse's head as they were running down hill,  was hit by the horse's fore-leg, knocked down, and run over by both  wheels.          CHAPTER IV.    CLOTHING.      If your means allow it, have a suit especially for the summer tour, and  sufficiently in fashion to indicate that you are a traveller or camper.      SHIRTS.    Loose woollen shirts, of dark colors and with flowing collars, will  probably always be the proper thing. Avoid gaudiness and too much  trimming. Large pockets, one over each breast, are \"handy;\" but they  spoil the fit of the shirt, and are always wet from perspiration. I  advise you to have the collar-binding of silesia, and fitted the same as  on a cotton shirt, only looser; then have a number of woollen collars  (of different styles if you choose), to button on in the same manner as  a linen collar. You can thus keep your neck cool or warm, and can wash  the collars, which soil so easily, without washing the whole shirt. The  shirt should reach nearly to the knees, to prevent disorders in the  stomach and bowels. There are many who will prefer cotton-and-wool  goods to all-wool for shirts. The former do not shrink as much, nor are  they as expensive, as the latter.      DRAWERS.    If you wear drawers, better turn them inside out, so that the seams may  not chafe you. They _must_ be loose.      SHOES.    You need to exercise more care in the selection of shoes than of any  other article of your outfit. Tight boots put an end to all pleasure, if  worn on the march; heavy boots or shoes, with enormously thick soles,  will weary you; thin boots will not protect the feet sufficiently, and  are liable to burst or wear out; Congress boots are apt to bind the  cords of the leg, and thus make one lame; short-toed boots or shoes hurt  the toes; loose ones do the same by allowing the foot to slide into the  toe of the boot or shoe; low-cut shoes continually fill with dust, sand,  or mud.    For summer travel, I think you can find nothing better than brogans  reaching above the ankles, and fastening by laces or buttons as you  prefer, but not so tight as to bind the cords of the foot. See that they  bind nowhere except upon the instep. The soles should be wide, and the  heels wide and low (about two and three-quarter inches wide by one inch  high); have soles and heels well filled with iron nails. Be particular  not to have steel nails, which slip so badly on the rocks.    Common brogans, such as are sold in every country-store, are the next  best things to walk in; but it is hard to find a pair that will fit a  difficult foot, and they readily let in dust and earth.    Whatever you wear, break them in well, and oil the tops thoroughly with  neat's-foot oil before you start; and see that there are no nails,  either in sight or partly covered, to cut your feet.    False soles are a good thing to have if your shoes will admit them: they  help in keeping the feet dry, and in drying the shoes when they are wet.    Woollen or merino stockings are usually preferable to cotton, though for  some feet cotton ones are by far the best. Any darning should be done  smoothly, since a bunch in the stocking is apt to bruise the skin.      PANTALOONS.    Be sure to have the trousers loose, and made of rather heavier"]]]
