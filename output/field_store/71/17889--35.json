Swem, said one day when we were going to New  York with the President.    \"I am present at every conference the President holds,\" he stated.  \"I  take all his dictation.  I think he is the most neutral man in America.  I have never heard him express an opinion one way or the other, and if  he had I would surely know of it.\"    I told Dr. Dumba this story, which interested him, and he made no  comments.    As I was at the White House nearly every day I had an opportunity to  learn what the President would say to callers and friends, although I  was seldom privileged to use the information.  Even now I do not recall  a single statement which ever gave me the impression that the President  sided with one group of belligerents.    The President's sincerity and firm desire for neutrality was emphasised  in his appeal to \"My Countrymen.\"    \"The people of the United States,\" he said, \"are drawn from many  nations, and chiefly from the nations now at war.  It is natural and  inevitable that there should be the utmost variety of sympathy and  desire among them with regard to the issues and circumstances of the  conflict.  Some will wish one nation, others another, to succeed in the  momentous struggle.  It will be easy to excite passion and difficult to  allay it.  Those responsible for exciting it will assume a heavy  responsibility, responsibility for no less a thing than that the people  of the United States, whose love of their country and whose loyalty to  the government should unite them as Americans all, bound in honour and  affection to think first of her and her interests, may be divided in  camps of hostile opinion, hot against each other, involved in the war  itself in impulse and opinion, if not in action.    \"My thought is of America.  I am speaking, I feel sure, the earnest  wish and purpose of every thoughtful American that this great country  of ours, which is of course the first in our thoughts and in our  hearts, should show herself in this time of peculiar trial a nation fit  beyond others to exhibit the fine poise of undisturbed judgment, the  dignity of self-control, the efficiency of dispassionate action; a  nation that neither sits in judgment upon others nor is disturbed in  her own counsels and which keeps herself fit and free to do what is  honest and disinterested and truly serviceable for the peace of the  world.\"    Many Americans believed even early in the war that the United States  should have protested against the invasion of Belgium.  Others thought  the government should prohibit the shipments of war supplies to the  belligerents.  America _was_ divided by the great issues in Europe, but  the great majority of Americans believed with the President, that the  best service Uncle Sam could render would be to help bring about peace.    Until February, 1915, when the von Tirpitz submarine blockade of  England was proclaimed, only American interests, not American lives,  had been drawn into the war.  But when the German Admiralty announced  that neutral as well as belligerent ships in British waters would be  sunk without warning, there was a new and unexpected obstacle to  neutrality.  The high seas were as much American as British.  The  oceans were no nation's property and they could not justly be used as  battlegrounds for ruthless warfare by either belligerent.    Germany, therefore, was the first to challenge American neutrality.  Germany was the first to threaten American lives.  Germany, which was  the first to show contempt for Wilson, forced the President, as well as  the people, to alter policies and adapt American neutrality to a new  and grave danger.          CHAPTER II    \"PIRATES SINK ANOTHER NEUTRAL SHIP\"    On February 4th, 1915, the _Reichsanzeiger_, the official newspaper of  Germany, published an announcement declaring that from the 18th of  February \"all the waters surrounding Great Britain and Ireland as well  as the entire English channel are hereby declared to be a war area.  All ships of the enemy mercantile marine found in these waters will be  destroyed and it will not always be possible to avoid danger to the  crews and passengers thereon.    \"_Neutral shipping is also in danger in the war area_, as owing to the  secret order issued by the British Admiralty January 31st, 1915,  regarding the misuse of neutral flags, and the chances of naval  warfare, it can happen that attacks directed against enemy ships may  damage neutral vessels.    \"The shipping route around the north of The Shetlands in the east of  the North Sea and over a distance of thirty miles along the coast of  The Netherlands will not be dangerous.\"    Although the announcement was signed by Admiral von Pohl, Chief of the  Admiralty Staff, the real author of the blockade was Grand Admiral von  Tirpitz.  In explanation of the announcement the Teutonic-Allied,  neutral and hostile powers were sent a memorandum which contained the  following paragraph:      \"The German Government announces its intention in good time so that  hostile _as well as neutral_ ships can take necessary precautions  accordingly.  Germany expects that the neutral powers will show the  same consideration for Germany's vital interests as for those of  England, and will aid in keeping their citizens and property from this  area.  This is the more to be expected, as it must be to the interests  of the neutral powers to see this destructive war end as soon as  possible.\"      On February 12th the American Ambassador, James W. Gerard, handed  Secretary of State von Jagow a note in which the United States said:      \"This Government views these possibilities with such grave concern that  it feels it to be its privilege, and indeed its duty in the  circumstances, to request the Imperial German Government to consider  before action is taken the critical situation in respect of the  relations between this country and Germany which might arise were the  German naval officers, in carrying out the policy foreshadowed in the  Admiralty's proclamation, to destroy any merchant vessel of the United  States or cause the death of American citizens.    \"It is of course unnecessary to remind the German Government that the  sole right of a belligerent in dealing with neutral vessels on the high  seas is limited to visit and search, unless a blockade is proclaimed  and effectively maintained, which the Government of the United States  does not understand to be proposed in this case.  To declare and  exercise the right to attack and destroy any vessel entering a  prescribed area of the high seas without first accurately determining  its belligerent nationality and the contraband character of its cargo,  would be an act so unprecedented in naval warfare that this Government  is reluctant to believe that the Imperial German Government in this  case contemplates it as possible.\"      I sailed from New York February 13th, 1915, on the first American  passenger liner to run the von Tirpitz blockade.  On February 20th we  passed Queenstown and entered the Irish Sea at night.  Although it was  moonlight and we could see for miles about us, every light on the ship,  except the green and red port and starboard lanterns, was extinguished.  As we sailed across the Irish Sea, silently and cautiously as a muskrat  swims on a moonlight night, we received a wireless message that a  submarine, operating off the mouth of the Mersey River, had sunk an  English freighter.  The captain was asked by the British Admiralty to  stop the engines and await orders.  Within an hour a patrol boat  approached and escorted us until the pilot came aboard early the next  morning.  No one aboard ship slept.  Few expected to reach Liverpool  alive, but the next afternoon we were safe in one of the numerous snug  wharves of that great port.    A few days later I arrived in London.  As I walked through Fleet street  newsboys were hurrying from the press rooms carrying orange-coloured  placards with the words in big black type: \"Pirates Sink Another  Neutral Ship.\"    Until the middle of March I remained in London, where the wildest  rumours were afloat about the dangers off the coast of England, and  where every one was excited and expectant over the reports that Germany  was starving.  I was urged by friends and physicians not to go to  Germany because it was universally believed in Great Britain that the  war would be over in a very short time.  On the 15th of March I crossed  from Tilbury to Rotterdam.  At Tilbury I saw pontoon bridges across the  Thames, patrol boats and submarine chasers rushing back and forth  watching for U-boats, which might attempt to come up the river.  I  boarded the _Batavia IV_ late at night and left Gravesend at daylight  the next morning for Holland.  Every one was on deck looking for  submarines and mines.  The channel that day was as smooth as a small  lake, but the terrible expectation that submarines might sight the  Dutch ship made every passenger feel that the submarine war was as real  as it was horrible.    On the 17th of March, arriving at the little German border town of  Bentheim, I met for the first time the people who were already branded  as \"Huns and Barbarians\" by the British and French.  Officers and  people, however, were not what they had been pictured to be.  Neither  was Germany starving.  The officials and inspectors were courteous and  patient and permitted me to take into Germany not only British  newspapers, but placards which pictured the Germans as pirates.  Two  days later, while walking down Unter den Linden, poor old women, who  were already taking the places of newsboys, sold German extras with  streaming headlines: \"British Ships Sunk.  Submarine War Successful.\"  In front of the _Lokal Anzeiger_ building stood a large crowd reading  the bulletins about the progress of the von Tirpitz blockade.    For luncheon that day I had the choice of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15777"],[0,"A Voyage Towards the South Pole and Round the World, Volume 1 (#4)"],[1,"discoverers; and continue to Britain the reputation of taking the  lead of nations, in exploring the globe.    These considerations concurring with Lord Sandwich's opinion on the same  subject, the Admiralty determined to have two such ships as are here  recommended. Accordingly two were purchased of Captain William Hammond of  Hull. They were both built at Whitby, by the same person who built the  Endeavour, being about fourteen or sixteen months old at the time they were  purchased, and were, in my opinion, as well adapted to the intended  service, as if they had been built for the purpose. The largest of the two  was four hundred and sixty-two tons burden. She was named Resolution, and  sent to Deptford to be equipped. The other was three hundred and thirty-six  tons burden. She was named Adventure, and sent to be equipped at Woolwich.    It was at first proposed to sheathe them with copper; but on considering  that copper corrodes the iron-work, especially about the rudder, this  intention was laid aside, and the old method of sheathing and fitting  pursued, as being the most secure; for although it is usual to make the  rudder-bands of the same composition, it is not, however, so durable as  iron, nor would it, I am well assured, last out such a voyage as the  Resolution performed.    Therefore, till a remedy is found to prevent the effect of copper upon  iron-work, it would not be advisable to use it on a voyage of this kind,  as, the principal fastenings of the ship being iron, they may be destroyed.    On the 28th of November, 1771, I was appointed to the command of the  Resolution; and Tobias Furneaux (who had been second lieutenant with  Captain Wallis) was promoted, on this occasion, to the command of the  Adventure.    _Our Complements of Officers and Men were fixed, as in the following  Table._    RESOLUTION    _Officers and Men, Officers Names_    Captain (1) James Cook.

Serjeant (1)  Corporals (1)  Drummer (1)  Privates (8)    Total, 81    I had all the reason in the world to be perfectly satisfied with the choice  of the officers. The second and third lieutenants, the lieutenant of  marines, two of the warrant officers, and several of the petty officers,  had been with me during the former voyage. The others were men of known  abilities; and all of them, on every occasion, shewed their zeal for the  service in which they were employed, during the whole voyage.    In the equipping of these ships, they were not confined to ordinary  establishments, but were fitted in the most complete manner, and supplied  with every extra article that was suggested to be necessary.    Lord Sandwich paid an extraordinary attention to this equipment, by  visiting the ships from time to time, to satisfy himself that the whole was  completed to his wish, and to the satisfaction of those who were to embark  in them.    Nor were the Navy and Victualling Boards wanting in providing them with the  very best of stores and provisions, and whatever else was necessary for so  long a voyage.--Some alterations were adopted in the species of provisions  usually made use of in the navy. That is, we were supplied with wheat in  lieu of so much oatmeal, and sugar in lieu of so much oil; and when  completed, each ship had two years and a half provisions on board, of all  species.    We had besides many extra articles, such as _malt, sour krout, salted  cabbage, portable broth, saloup, mustard, marmalade of carrots, and  inspissated juice of wort and beer_. Some of these articles had before  been found to be highly antiscorbutic; and others were now sent out on  trial, or by way of experiment;--the inspissated juice of beer and wort,  and marmalade of carrots especially. As several of these antiscorbutic  articles are not generally known, a more particular account of them may not  be amiss.    Of _malt_ is made _sweet wort_, which is given to such persons as  have got the scurvy, or whose habit of body threatens them with it, from  one to five or six pints a-day, as the surgeon sees necessary.    _Sour krout_ is cabbage cut small, to which is put a little salt,  juniper berries, and anniseeds; it is then fermented, and afterwards close  packed in casks; in which state it will keep good a long time. This is a  wholesome vegetable food, and a great antiscorbutic. The allowance to each  man is two pounds a week, but I increased or diminished their allowance as  I thought proper.    _Salted cabbage_ is cabbage cut to pieces, and salted down in casks,  which will preserve it a long time.    _Portable broth_ is so well known, that it needs no description. We  were supplied with it both for the sick and well, and it was exceedingly  beneficial.    _Saloup_ and _rob of lemons_ and _oranges_ were for the sick  and scorbutic only, and wholly under the surgeon's care.    _Marmalade of carrots_ is the juice of yellow carrots, inspissated  till it is of the thickness of fluid honey, or treacle, which last it  resembles both in taste and colour. It was recommended by Baron Storsch, of  Berlin, as a very great antiscorbutic; but we did not find that it had much  of this quality.    For the _inspissated juice of wort_ and _beer_ we were indebted  to Mr Pelham, secretary to the commissioners of the victualling office.  This gentleman, some years ago, considered that if the juice of malt,  either as beer or wort, was inspissated by evaporation, it was probable  this inspissated juice would keep good at sea; and, if so, a supply of beer  might be had, at any time, by mixing it with water. Mr Pelham made several  experiments, which succeeded so well, that the commissioners caused thirty-  one half barrels of this juice to be prepared, and sent out with our ships  for trial; nineteen on board the Resolution, and the remainder on board the  Adventure. The success of the experiments will be mentioned in the  narrative, in the order as they were made.    The frame of a small vessel, twenty tons burthen, was properly prepared,  and put on board each of the ships to be set up (if found necessary) to  serve as tenders upon any emergency, or to transport the crew, in case the  ship was lost.    We were also well provided with fishing-nets, lines, and hooks of every  kind for catching of fish.--And, in order to enable us to procure  refreshments, in such inhabited parts of the world as we might touch at,  where money was of no value, the Admiralty caused to be put on board both  the ships, several articles of merchandize; as well to trade with the  natives for provisions, as to make them presents to gain their friendship  and esteem.    Their lordships also caused a number of medals to be struck, the one side  representing his majesty, and the other the two ships. These medals were to  be given to the natives of new-discovered countries, and left there as  testimonies of our being the first discoverers.    Some additional clothing, adapted to a cold climate, was put on board; to  be given to the seamen whenever it was thought necessary. In short, nothing  was wanting that could tend to promote the success of the undertaking, or  contribute to the conveniences and health of those who embarked in it.    The Admiralty shewed no less attention to science in general, by engaging  Mr William Hodges, a landscape painter, to embark in this voyage, in order  to make drawings and paintings of such places in the countries we should  touch at, as might be proper to give a more perfect, idea thereof, than  could be formed from written descriptions only.    And it being thought of public utility, that some person skilled in natural  history, should be engaged to accompany me in this voyage, the parliament  granted an ample sum for the purpose, and Mr John Reinhold Forster, with  his son, were pitched upon for this employment.    The Board of Longitude agreed with Mr William Wales and Mr William Bayley,  to make astronomical observations; the former on board the Resolution, and  the latter on board the Adventure. The great improvements which astronomy  and navigation have met with from the many interesting observations they  have made, would have done honour to any person whose reputation for  mathematical knowledge was not so well known as theirs.    The same Board furnished them with the best instruments, for making both  astronomical and nautical observations and experiments; and likewise with  four time-pieces, or watch machines; three made by Mr Arnold, and one made  by Mr Kendal on Mr Harrison's principles. A particular account of the going  of these watches, as also the astronomical and nautical observations made  by the astronomers, has been before the public, by order of the Board of  Longitude, under the inspection of Mr Wales.
