This childlike  appeal to the heavenly King from the action of an earthly sovereign and  the emotional scenes accompanying it were interpreted by the Russian  authorities as \"mutiny.\" Under the patriarchal conditions of Jewish life  prevailing at that time a political protest was a matter of  impossibility. The only medium through which the Jews could give vent to  their burning national sorrow was a religious demonstration within the  walls of the synagogue.      3. MILITARY MARTYRDOM    The ways and means by which the provisions of the military statute were  carried into effect during the reign of Nicholas I. we do not learn from  official documents, which seem to have drawn a veil over this dismal  strip of the past. Our information is derived from sources far more  communicative and nearer to truth--the traditions current among the  people. Owing to the fact that every Jewish community, at the mutual  responsibility of all its members, was compelled by law to supply a  definite number of recruits, and that no one was willing to become a  soldier of his own volition, the Kahal administration and the recruiting  \"trustees,\" who had to answer to the authorities for any shortage in  recruits, were practically forced to become a sort of police agents,  whose function it was to \"capture\" the necessary quota of recruits.  Prior to every military conscription, the victims marked for prey, the  young men and boys of the burgher class, [1] very generally took to  flight, hiding in distant cities, outside the zone of their Kahals, or  in forests and ravines. A popular song in Yiddish refers to these  conditions in the following words;    [Footnote 1: Compare on the status of the burgher in Russian law Vol. I,  p. 308, n. 2. Nearly all the higher estates were exempt.]          _Der Ukas is arobgekumen auf judische Selner,        Seinen mir sich zulofen in die puste Waelder.....        In alle puste Waelder seinen mir zulofen,        In puste Gruber seinen mir verlofen_..... Oi weih, oi weih!_....[1]    [Footnote 1:          When the ukase came down about Jewish soldiers,        We all dispersed over the lonesome forests;        Over the lonesome forests did we disperse,        In lonesome pits did we hide ourselves.... Woe me, Woe!]    The recruiting agents hired by the Kahal or its \"trustees,\" who received  the nickname \"hunters\" or \"captors,\" [1] hunted down the fugitives,  trailing them everywhere and capturing them for the purpose of making up  the shortage. In default of a sufficient number of adults, little  children, who were easier \"catch,\" were seized, often enough in  violation of the provision of the law. Even boys under the required age  of twelve, sometimes no more than eight years old, were caught and  offered as conscripts at the recruiting stations, their age being  misstated. [2] The agents perpetrated incredible cruelties. Houses were  raided during the night, and children were torn from the arms of their  mothers, or lured away and kidnapped.    [Footnote 1: More literally \"catchers\"; in Yiddish _Khappers_.]    [Footnote 2: This was the more easy, as regular birth-registers were not  yet in existence.]    After being captured, the Jewish conscripts were sent into the  recruiting jail where they were kept in confinement until their  examination at the recruiting station. The enlisted minors were turned  over to a special officer to be dispatched to their places of  destination, mostly in the Eastern provinces including Siberia. For it  must be noted that the cantonists were stationed almost to a man in the  outlying Russian governments, where they could be brought up at a safe  distance from all Jewish influences. The unfortunate victims who were  drafted into the army and deported to these far-off regions were mourned  by their relatives as dead. During the autumnal season, when the  recruits were drafted and deported, the streets of the Jewish towns  resounded with moans. The juvenile cantonists were packed into wagons  like so many sheep and carried off in batches under a military  convoy. When they took leave of their dear ones it was for a quarter of a  century; in the case of children it was for a longer term, too often it  was good-bye for life.    How these unfortunate youngsters were driven to their places of  destination we learn from the description of Alexander Hertzen, [1] who  chanced to meet a batch of Jewish cantonists on his involuntary journey  through Vyatka, in 1835. At one of the post stations in some  God-forsaken village of the Vyatka government he met the escorting  officer. The following dialogue ensued between the two:    [Footnote 1: Hertzen, a famous Russian writer (d. 1870), was exiled to the  government of Vyatka for propagating liberal doctrines.]      \"Whom do you carry and to what place?\"      \"Well, sir, you see, they got together a bunch of these accursed    Jewish youngsters between the age of eight and nine. I suppose they    are meant for the fleet, but how should I know? At first the command    was to drive them to Perm. Now there is a change. We are told to    drive them to Kazan. I have had them on my hands for a hundred    versts or thereabouts. The officer that turned them over to me told    me they were an awful nuisance. A third of them remained on the road    (at this the officer pointed with his finger to the ground). Half of    them will not get to their destination,\" he added.      \"Epidemics, I suppose?\", I inquired, stirred to the very core.      \"No, not exactly epidemics; but they just fall like flies. Well, you    know, these Jewish boys are so puny and delicate. They can't stand    mixing dirt for ten hours, with dry biscuits to live on. Again    everywhere strange folks, no father, no mother, no caresses. Well    then, you just hear a cough and the youngster is dead. Hello,    corporal, get out the small fry!\"      The little ones were assembled and arrayed in a military line. It    was one of the most terrible spectacles I have ever witnessed. Poor,    poor children! The boys of twelve or thirteen managed somehow to    stand up, but the little ones of eight and ten.... No brush, however    black, could convey the terror of this scene on the canvas.      Pale, worn out, with scared looks, this is the way they stood in    their uncomfortable, rough soldier uniforms, with their starched,    turned-up collars, fixing an inexpressibly helpless and pitiful gaze    upon the garrisoned soldiers, who were handling them rudely. White    lips, blue lines under the eyes betokened either fever or cold. And    these poor children, without care, without a caress, exposed to the    wind which blows unhindered from the Arctic Ocean, were marching to    their death. I seized the officer's hand, and, with the words: \"Take    good care of them! \", threw myself into my carriage. I felt like    sobbing, and I knew I could not master myself....    The great Russian writer saw the Jewish cantonists on the road, but he  knew nothing of what happened to them later on, in the recesses of the  barracks into which they were driven. This terrible secret was revealed  to the world at a later period by the few survivors among these martyred  Jewish children.    Having arrived at their destination, the juvenile conscripts were put  into the cantonist battalions. The \"preparation for military service\"  began with their religious re-education at the hands of sergeants and  corporals. No means was, neglected so long as it bade fair to bring the  children to the baptismal font. The authorities refrained from giving  formal instructions, leaving everything to the zeal of the officers who  knew the wishes of their superiors. The children were first sent for  spiritual admonition to the local Greek-Orthodox priests, whose efforts,  however, proved fruitless in nearly every case. They were then taken in  hand by the sergeants and corporals who adopted military methods of  persuasion.    These brutal soldiers invented all kinds of tortures. A favorite  procedure was to make the cantonists get down on their knees in the  evening after all had gone to bed and to keep the sleepy children in  that position for hours. Those who agreed to be baptized were sent to  bed, those who refused were kept up the whole night till they dropped  from exhaustion. The children who continued to hold their own were  flogged and, under the guise of gymnastic exercises, subjected to all  kinds of tortures. Those that refused to eat pork or the customary  cabbage soup prepared with lard were beaten and left to starve. Others  were fed on salted fish and then forbidden to drink, until the little  ones, tormented by thirst, agreed to embrace Christianity.    The majority of these children, unable to endure the tortures inflicted  on them, saved themselves by baptism. But many cantonists, particularly  those of a maturer age (between fifteen and eighteen), bore their  martyrdom with heroic patience. Beaten almost into senselessness, their  bodies striped by lashes, tormented to the point of exhaustion by  hunger, thirst, and sleeplessness, the lads declared again and again  that they would not betray the faith of their fathers. Most of these  obstinate youths were carried from the barracks into the military  hospitals to be released by a kind death. Only a few remained alive.    Alongside of this passive heroism there were cases of demonstrative  martyrdom. One such incident has survived in the popular memory. The  story goes that during a military parade [1] in the city of Kazan the  battalion chief drew up all the Jewish cantonists on the banks of the  river, where the Greek-Orthodox priests were standing in their  vestments, and all was ready for the baptismal ceremony.

Look out for the thorns an' don't knock your  rifle against any bush.\"    The Panther lay almost flat. His huge figure seemed to blend with the  earth, and he crept forward among the thorny bushes with amazing skill.  He was like some large animal, trained for countless generations to slip  through thickets. Ned, just behind him, could hear only the faintest  noise, and the bushes moved so little that one, not knowing, might have  credited it to the wind.    The boy had the advantage of following in the path made by the man's  larger figure, and he, too, was successful in making no sound. But he  could hear the stamp of horses' feet clearly now, and both to left and  right he caught glimpses of them tethered in the thickets. His comrade  stopped at last. They were not more than a hundred yards from the fire  now, and the space in front of them was mostly open. The Panther,  crouching among the bushes, raised his finger slowly and pointed toward  the fire.    Ned, who had moved to one side, followed the pointing finger and saw  Urrea. He was the dominant figure in a group of six or seven gathered  about the flames. He was no longer in any disguise, but wore an  officer's gorgeous uniform of white and silver. A splendid cocked hat  was on his head, and a small gold hilted rapier swung by his side.    It may have been partly the effect of the night and the red flame, but  the face of Urrea had upon Ned an effect much like that of Santa Anna.  It was dark and handsome, but full of evil. And evil Ned knew Urrea to  be. No man with righteous blood in his veins would play the spy and  traitor as he had done.    \"I could shoot him from here,\" whispered the Panther, who evidently was  influenced in a similar way, \"then reach our horses an' get away. It  might be a good deed, an' it might save our lives, Ned, but I'm not able  to force myself to do it.\"    \"Nor I,\" said Ned. \"I can't shoot an enemy from ambush.\"    Urrea and the other men at the fire, all of whom were in the dress of  officers, were in a deep talk. Ned inferred that the subject must be of  much importance, since they sat awake, discussing it between midnight  and morning.    \"Look beyond the fire at the figures leanin' against the trees,\"  whispered the Panther.    Ned looked and hot anger rose in his veins.          CHAPTER II    THE CAPTIVES      Ned had not noticed at first, but, since his eyes were growing used to  the dim light, and since the Panther had pointed the way, he saw a dozen  men, arms bound tightly behind them, leaning against the trees. They  were prisoners and he knew instinctively that they were Texans. His  blood, hot at first, now chilled in his veins. They had been captured by  Urrea in a raid, and as Santa Anna had decreed that all Texans were  rebels who should be executed when taken, they would surely die, unless  rescue came.    \"What shall we do?\" he whispered.    \"Nothing now,\" replied the Panther, in the same soft tone, \"but if you  an' Obed are with me we'll follow this crowd, an' maybe we can get the  Texans away from 'em. It's likely that Urrea will cross the Rio Grande  an' go down into Mexico to meet Cos or Santa Anna. Are you game enough  to go, Ned? I'm a Ring Tailed Panther an' a roarin' grizzly bear, but I  don't like to follow all by myself.\"    \"I'm with you,\" said Ned, \"if I have to go all the way back to the City  of Mexico, an' I know that I can speak for Obed, too.\"    \"I jest asked as a matter of form,\" said the Panther. \"I knowed before  askin' that you an' Obed would stick to me.\"    There was a sudden gust of wind at that moment and the light of the fire  sprang higher. The flames threw a glow across the faces of the  prisoners. Most of them were asleep, but Ned saw them very distinctly  now. One was a boy but little older than himself, his face pale and  worn. Near him was an old man, with a face very uncommon on the border.  His features were those of a scholar and ascetic. His cheeks were thin,  and thick white hair crowned a broad white brow. Ned felt instinctively  that he was a man of importance.    Both the boy and the man slept the sleep of utter exhaustion.    Urrea rose presently and looked at his prisoners. The moonlight was  shining on his face, and it seemed to Ned to be that of some master  demon. The boy was far from denying many good qualities to the Mexicans,  but the countenance of Urrea certainly did not express any of them that  night. It showed only savage exultation as he looked at the bound men,  and Ned knew that this was a formidable enemy of the Texans, one who  would bring infinite resources of cunning and enterprise to crush them.    Urrea said a few words to his officers and then withdrew into a small  tent which Ned had not noticed hitherto. The officers lay down in their  blankets, but a dozen sentinels watched about the open space. Ned and  the Panther crept slowly back toward the plain.    \"What is our best plan, Panther?\" whispered the hoy.    \"We can't do anything yet but haul off, watch an' then follow. The  chaparral runs along for a mile or two an' we can hide in the north end  of it until they march south an' are out of sight. Then we'll hang on.\"    They found Obed standing exactly where they had left him, the reins of  the three horses in his hands.    \"Back at last,\" he said. \"All things come to him who waits long enough,  if he doesn't die first. Did you see anything besides a lot of Mexican  vaqueros, fuddled with liquor and sound asleep?\"    \"We did not see any vaqueros,\" replied the Panther, \"but we saw Urrea  an' his band, an' they had among them a dozen good Texans bound fast,  men who will be shot if we three don't stand in the way. You have to  follow with us, Obed, because Ned has already promised for you.\"    The Maine man looked at them and smiled.    \"A terribly good mind reader, that boy, Ned,\" he said. \"He knew exactly  what I wanted. There's a lot of things in the world that I'd like to do,  but the one that I want to do most just now is to follow Urrea and that  crowd of his and take away those Texans. You two couldn't keep me from  going.\"    The Panther smiled back.    \"You are shorely the right stuff, Obed White,\" he said. \"We're only  three in this bunch, but two of 'em besides me are ring-tailed panthers.  Now we'll just draw off, before it's day, an' hide in the chaparral up  there.\"    They rode a mile to the north and remained among dense bushes until  daylight. At dawn they saw a column of smoke rise from Urrea's camp.    \"They are cookin' breakfast now,\" said the Panther. \"It's my guess that  in an hour they'll be ridin' south with their prisoners.\"    The column of smoke sank after a while, and a couple of hours later the  three left the chaparral. From one of the summits they dimly saw a mass  of horsemen riding toward Mexico.    \"There's our men,\" said the Panther, \"an' now we'll follow all day at  this good, safe distance. At night we can draw up closer if we want to  do it.\"    The Mexicans maintained a steady pace, and the three pursuers followed  at a distance of perhaps two miles. Now and then the swells completely  shut Urrea's band from sight, but Ned, Obed and the Panther followed the  broad trail without the slightest difficulty.    \"They'll reach the river before noon,\" said the Panther. \"There ain't  any doubt now that they're bound for Mexico. It's jest as well for what  we want to do, 'cause they're likely to be less watchful there than they  are in Texas.\"    The band of Urrea, as nearly as they could judge, numbered about fifty,  all mounted and armed well. The Mexicans were fine horsemen, and with  good training and leadership they were dangerous foes. The three knew  them well, and they kept so far behind that they were not likely to be  observed.    It was only a half hour past noon when Urrea's men reached the Rio  Grande, and without stopping made the crossing. They avoided the  quicksands with experienced eyes, and swam their horses through the deep  water, the prisoners always kept in the center of the troop. Ned, Obed  and the Panther watched them until they passed out of sight. Then they,  too, rode forward, although slowly, toward the stream.    \"We can't lose 'em,\" said the Panther, \"so I think we'd better stay out  of sight now that they're on real Mexican soil. Maybe our chance will  come to-night, an' ag'in maybe it won't.\"    \"Patience will have its perfect rescue, if we only do the right things,\"  said Obed.    \"An' if we think hard enough an' long enough we're bound to do 'em, or  I'm a Ring Tailed Panther an' a Cheerful Talker fur nothin',\" said the  Panther.    Waiting until they were certain that the Mexicans were five or six miles  ahead, the three forded the Rio Grande, and stood once more on Mexican  soil. It gave Ned a curious thrill. He had passed through so much in  Mexico that he had not believed he would ever again enter that country.  The land on the Mexican side was about the same as that on the Texan,  but it seemed different to him. He beheld again that aspect of infinite  age, of the long weariness of time, and of physical decay.    They rode more briskly through the afternoon and at darkness saw the  camp fires of Urrea glimmering ahead of them. But the night was not  favorable to their plans. The sky was the usual cloudless blue of the  Mexican plateau, the moon was at the full and all the stars were out.  What they wanted was bad weather, hoping meanwhile the execution of the  prisoners would not be begun until the Mexicans reached higher authority  than Urrea, perhaps Santa Anna himself.    They made their own camp a full two miles from Urrea's, and Obed and the  Panther divided the watch.    Urrea started early the next morning, and so did the pursuing three. The  dawn was gray, and the breeze was chill. As they rode on, the wind rose  and its edge became so sharp that there "]]]
