C. viii., British Museum.]    It is probable that this sort of mania marked the dancing in Europe  which was suppressed by Pope and Bishop. This _choreomania_ marked a  Flemish sect in 1374 who danced in honour of St. John, and it was so  furious that the disease called St. Vitus' dance takes its name from  this performance.    Christmas carols were originally choric. The performers danced and  sang in a circle.    The illustration (fig. 43) of a dance of angels and religious shows us  that Fra Angelico thought the practice joyful; this dance is almost a  counterpart of that amongst the Greeks (fig. 11). The other dance, by  Sandro Botticelli (fig. 44), is taken from his celebrated \"Nativity\"  in the National Gallery. Although we have records of performances in  churches, no illustrations of an early date have come to the knowledge  of the writer.  [Illustration: Fig. 30.--Dancing to horn and pipe.  From an Anglo-Saxon MS.]    That the original inhabitants of Britain danced--that the Picts,  Danes, Saxons and Romans danced may be taken for granted, but there  seems little doubt that our earliest illustrations of dancing were of  the Roman tradition. We find the attitude, the instruments and the  clapping of hands, all of the same undoubted classic character.  Tacitus informs us that the Teutonic youths danced, with swords and  spears, and Olaus Magnus that the Goths, &c., had military dances:  still the military dances in English MSS. (figs. 31, 32) seem more  like those of a Pyrrhic character, which Julius Caesar, the conqueror  of England, introduced into Rome. The illustration (fig. 29) of what  is probably a Saxon gleemen's dance shows us the kind of amusement  they afforded and how they followed classic usages.    [Illustration: Fig. 31.--Anglo-Saxon sword dance. From the MS.  Cleopatra, C. viii., British Museum.]  The gleemen were reciters,  singers and dancers; and the lower orders were tumblers,  sleight-of-hand men and general entertainers. What may have been the  origin of our hornpipe is illustrated in fig. 30, where the figures  dance to the sound of the horn in much the same attitudes as in the  modern hornpipe, with a curious resemblance to the position in some  Muscovite dances.    [Illustration: Fig. 32.--Sword dance to bagpipes, 14th century. From 2  B vii., Royal MS., British Museum.]    The Norman minstrel, successor of the gleeman, used the double-pipe,  the harp, the viol, trumpets, the horn and a small flat drum, and it  is not unlikely that from Sicily and their South Italian possessions  the Normans introduced classic ideas.    Piers the Plowman used words of Norman extraction for them, as he  speaks of their \"Saylen and Saute.\"    The minstrel and harpist does not appear to have danced very much, but  to have left this to the joculator, and dancing and tumbling and even  acrobatic women and dancers appear to have become common before the  time of Chaucer's \"Tomblesteres.\"    [Illustration: Fig. 33.--Herodias tumbling. From a MS. end of 13th  century (Addl. 18,719, f. 253b), British Museum.]    That this tumbling and dancing was common in the thirteenth century is  shown by the illustration from the sculpture at Rouen Cathedral (fig.  34), the illustrations from a MS. in the British Museum (fig. 33) of  Herodias tumbling and of a design in glass in Lincoln, and other  instances at Ely; Idsworth Church, Hants; Ponce, France, and  elsewhere. It is suggested that the camp followers of the Crusaders  brought back certain dances and amongst these some of an acrobatic  nature, and many that were reprehensible, which brought down the anger  of the Clergy.    [Illustration: Fig. 34.--A tumbler, as caryatid. Rouen Cathedral, 13th  century.]    In the fourteenth century, from a celebrated MS. (2 B. vii.) in the  British Museum and other cognate sources we get a fair insight of the  amusement afforded by these dancers and joculators. In the  illustration (fig. 35) we get A and C tumblers, male and female; D, a  woman and bear dance; and E, a dance of fools to the organ and  bagpipe. It will be observed that they have bells on their caps, and  it must have required much skill and practice to sound their various  toned bells to the music as they danced. This dance of fools may have  suggested or became eventually merged into the \"Morris Dance\" (fig.  50) of which some account with other illustrations of \"Comic Dances\"  will be given hereafter. The man dancing and playing the pipes with a  woman on his shoulder (fig. 36), the stilt dancer with a curious  instrument (C), and the woman jumping through a hoop, give us other  illustrations of fourteenth century amusements.    [Illustration: Fig. 35.--14th century dancers. A and C are tumblers;  B, tumbling and balancing to the tambour; D, a woman dancing around a  whipped bear; E, jesters dancing.]    [Illustration: Fig. 36.--A, man dancing and playing pipes, carrying a  woman; B, jumping through a hoop; C, a stilt dance. 14th century.]          CHAPTER V.      SOCIETY DANCING FROM THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY.    [Illustration: Fig. 37.--Italian dance. From an engraving, end of 15th  century, attributed to Baccio Baldini.]    Concerning the dance as a means of social intercourse, it does not  appear to have been formulated as an accomplishment until late in the  thirteenth century, and at a later date was cultivated as a means of  teaching what we call deportment, until it became almost a necessity  with the classes, as is shown by the literature of that period. The  various social dances, such as the Volte, the Jig and the Galliard,  although in early periods, not so numerous, required a certain  training and agility. These, however, soon became complicated with  many social and local variations, the characteristics of which are a  study in themselves. The dances (figs. 37 and 38) in a field of  sports, from an Italian engraving of the fifteenth century, show us  nothing new; indeed, with different costumes it is very like what we  have from Egypt (fig. 3), only a different phase of the action, and  the attitude of this old dance is repeated even to our own time.    [Illustration: Fig. 38.--Italian dancing, the end of the 15th  century.]    In the Chamber dance by Martin Zasinger (fig. 39), of the fifteenth  century, no figures are in action, but we see an arrangement of the  guests and musicians, from which it is evident that the Chamber dance  as a social function had progressed and that the \"Bal pare,\" etc.,  was here in embryo.    The flute and viol are evidently opening the function and the trumpets  and other portions of the orchestra on the other side waiting to come  in.    [Illustration: Fig. 39.--Chamber dance, 15th century. From a drawing  by Martin Zasinger.]    The stately out-door function, in a pleasure garden, from the \"Roman  de la Rose\" (fig. 40) illustrates but one portion of the feature of a  dance, another of which is described in Chaucer's translation:           \"They threw y fere      Ther mouthes so that through their play      It seemed as they kyste alway.\"    Fancy dress and comic dances have handed down the same characteristics  almost to our own time. The Wildeman costume dance (fig. 41) is  interesting in many respects, it not only shows us the dance, but the  costume and general method of the Chamber.    [Illustration: Fig. 40.--Dancing in a \"pleasure garden,\" end of the  15th century. French, from the \"Roman de la Rose,\" in the British  Museum.]    The fifteenth century comic dancers in a _fete champetre_ (fig. 42)  and those of the seventeenth century by Callot (fig. 52) are good  examples of this entertainment--in the background of the latter a  minuet seems to be in progress. The Morris dance (fig. 50) shows us  the development that had taken place since the fourteenth century.    [Illustration: Fig. 41.--Fancy dress dance of Wildemen of the 15th  century. From MS. 4379 Harl, British Museum.]    [Illustration: Fig. 42.--Comic dance to pipe and tabor, end of 15th  century. From pen drawing in the Mediaeval House Book in the Castle of  Wolfegg, by the Master of the Amsterdam Cabinet.]    [Illustration: Fig. 43.--A dance of Angels and Saints at the entrance  to Heaven. Fra Angelico.]    [Illustration: Fig. 44.--Dancing angels. From a \"Nativity\" by Sandro  Botticelli _circa_ 1500 A.D.] [Illustration: Fig. 45.--Albert Duerer,  1514 A.D.]    [Illustration: Fig. 46.--Albert Duerer.]    Allusion has already been made to the beautiful paintings of  Botticelli and Fra Angelico, which tell us of Italian choral dances of  their period; these do not belong to social functions, but are  certainly illustrative of the custom of their day. Albert Duerer (figs.  45, 46) has given us illustrations of the field dances of his period,  but both these dances and those drawn by Sebald Beham (fig. 47) are  coarse, and contrast unfavourably with the Italian, although the  action is vigorous and robust.    [Illustration: Fig. 47.--Scenes from dances. German, dated 1546, by  Hans Sebald Beham.]  The military dance of Dames and Knights of  Armour, by Hans Burgkmair, on the other hand, appears stately and  dignified (fig. 48). This may illustrate the difference between  chamber and garden or field dancing.    [Illustration: Fig. 48.--A torchlight military dance of the early 16th  century. From a picture by Hans Burgkmair.]    At the end of the sixteenth century we get a work on dancing which  shows us completely its position as a social art in that day. It is  the \"Orchesographie\" of Thoinot Arbeau (Jean Tabouret, Canon of  Langres, in 1588), from which comes the illustration of the  \"Galliarde\" (fig. 49) and to which I would refer the reader for all  the information he desires concerning this period. In this work much  stress is laid on the value of learning to dance from many points of  view--development of strength, manner, habits and courtesy, etc. Alas!"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/173"],[0,"The Insidious Dr. Fu Manchu (#4)"],[1,"per.\"    \"Smith,\" I broke in, \"who is she?\"    \"She is either Fu-Manchu's daughter, his wife, or his slave.  I am  inclined to believe the last, for she has no will but his will,  except\"--with a quizzical glance--\"in a certain instance.\"    \"How can you jest with some awful thing--Heaven knows what--hanging  over your head?  What is the meaning of these perfumed envelopes?  How  did Sir Crichton die?\"    \"He died of the Zayat Kiss.  Ask me what that is and I reply 'I do not  know.'  The zayats are the Burmese caravanserais, or rest-houses. Along  a certain route--upon which I set eyes, for the first and only time,  upon Dr. Fu-Manchu--travelers who use them sometimes die as Sir  Crichton died, with nothing to show the cause of death but a little  mark upon the neck, face, or limb, which has earned, in those parts,  the title of the 'Zayat Kiss.' The rest-houses along that route are  shunned now.  I have my theory and I hope to prove it to-night, if I  live.  It will be one more broken weapon in his fiendish armory, and it  is thus, and thus only, that I can hope to crush him.  This was my  principal reason for not enlightening Dr. Cleeve.  Even walls have ears  where Fu-Manchu is concerned, so I feigned ignorance of the meaning of  the mark, knowing that he would be almost certain to employ the same  methods upon some other victim.  I wanted an opportunity to study the  Zayat Kiss in operation, and I shall have one.\"    \"But the scented envelopes?\"    \"In the swampy forests of the district I have referred to a rare  species of orchid, almost green, and with a peculiar scent, is  sometimes met with.  I recognized the heavy perfume at once.  I take it  that the thing which kills the traveler is attracted by this orchid.  You will notice that the perfume clings to whatever it touches.  I  doubt if it can be washed off in the ordinary way.  After at least one  unsuccessful attempt to kill Sir Crichton--you recall that he thought  there was something concealed in his study on a previous  occasion?--Fu-Manchu hit upon the perfumed envelopes.  He may have a  supply of these green orchids in his possession--possibly to feed the  creature.\"    \"What creature?  How could any kind of creature have got into Sir  Crichton's room tonight?\"    \"You no doubt observed that I examined the grate of the study.  I found  a fair quantity of fallen soot.  I at once assumed, since it appeared  to be the only means of entrance, that something has been dropped down;  and I took it for granted that the thing, whatever it was, must still  be concealed either in the study or in the library.  But when I had  obtained the evidence of the groom, Wills, I perceived that the cry  from the lane or from the park was a signal.  I noted that the  movements of anyone seated at the study table were visible, in shadow,  on the blind, and that the study occupied the corner of a two-storied  wing and, therefore, had a short chimney.  What did the signal mean?  That Sir Crichton had leaped up from his chair, and either had received  the Zayat Kiss or had seen the thing which someone on the roof had  lowered down the straight chimney.  It was the signal to withdraw that  deadly thing.  By means of the iron stairway at the rear of  Major-General Platt-Houston's, I quite easily, gained access to the  roof above Sir Crichton's study--and I found this.\"    Out from his pocket Nayland Smith drew a tangled piece of silk, mixed  up with which were a brass ring and a number of unusually large-sized  split-shot, nipped on in the manner usual on a fishing-line.    \"My theory proven,\" he resumed.  \"Not anticipating a search on the  roof, they had been careless.  This was to weight the line and to  prevent the creature clinging to the walls of the chimney.  Directly it  had dropped in the grate, however, by means of this ring I assume that  the weighted line was withdrawn, and the thing was only held by one  slender thread, which sufficed, though, to draw it back again when it  had done its work.  It might have got tangled, of course, but they  reckoned on its making straight up the carved leg of the writing-table  for the prepared envelope.  From there to the hand of Sir  Crichton--which, from having touched the envelope, would also be  scented with the perfume--was a certain move.\"    \"My God!  How horrible!\" I exclaimed, and glanced apprehensively into  the dusky shadows of the room.  \"What is your theory respecting this  creature--what shape, what color--?\"    \"It is something that moves rapidly and silently.  I will venture no  more at present, but I think it works in the dark.  The study was dark,  remember, save for the bright patch beneath the reading-lamp. I have  observed that the rear of this house is ivy-covered right up to and  above your bedroom.  Let us make ostentatious preparations to retire,  and I think we may rely upon Fu-Manchu's servants to attempt my  removal, at any rate--if not yours.\"    \"But, my dear fellow, it is a climb of thirty-five feet at the very  least.\"    \"You remember the cry in the back lane?  It suggested something to me,  and I tested my idea--successfully.  It was the cry of a dacoit.  Oh,  dacoity, though quiescent, is by no means extinct.  Fu-Manchu has  dacoits in his train, and probably it is one who operates the Zayat  Kiss, since it was a dacoit who watched the window of the study this  evening.  To such a man an ivy-covered wall is a grand staircase.\"    The horrible events that followed are punctuated, in my mind, by the  striking of a distant clock.  It is singular how trivialities thus  assert themselves in moments of high tension.  I will proceed, then, by  these punctuations, to the coming of the horror that it was written we  should encounter.    The clock across the common struck two.    Having removed all traces of the scent of the orchid from our hands  with a solution of ammonia Smith and I had followed the programme laid  down.  It was an easy matter to reach the rear of the house, by simply  climbing a fence, and we did not doubt that seeing the light go out in  the front, our unseen watcher would proceed to the back.    The room was a large one, and we had made up my camp-bed at one end,  stuffing odds and ends under the clothes to lend the appearance of a  sleeper, which device we also had adopted in the case of the larger  bed.  The perfumed envelope lay upon a little coffee table in the  center of the floor, and Smith, with an electric pocket lamp, a  revolver, and a brassey beside him, sat on cushions in the shadow of  the wardrobe.  I occupied a post between the windows.    No unusual sound, so far, had disturbed the stillness of the night.  Save for the muffled throb of the rare all-night cars passing the front  of the house, our vigil had been a silent one.  The full moon had  painted about the floor weird shadows of the clustering ivy, spreading  the design gradually from the door, across the room, past the little  table where the envelope lay, and finally to the foot of the bed.    The distant clock struck a quarter-past two.    A slight breeze stirred the ivy, and a new shadow added itself to the  extreme edge of the moon's design.    Something rose, inch by inch, above the sill of the westerly window.  I  could see only its shadow, but a sharp, sibilant breath from Smith told  me that he, from his post, could see the cause of the shadow.    Every nerve in my body seemed to be strung tensely.  I was icy cold,  expectant, and prepared for whatever horror was upon us.    The shadow became stationary.  The dacoit was studying the interior of  the room.    Then it suddenly lengthened, and, craning my head to the left, I saw a  lithe, black-clad form, surmounted by a Yellow face, sketchy in the  moonlight, pressed against the window-panes!    One thin, brown hand appeared over the edge of the lowered sash, which  it grasped--and then another.  The man made absolutely no sound  whatever.  The second hand disappeared--and reappeared.  It held a  small, square box.  There was a very faint CLICK.    The dacoit swung himself below the window with the agility of an ape,  as, with a dull, muffled thud, SOMETHING dropped upon the carpet!    \"Stand still, for your life!\" came Smith's voice, high-pitched.    A beam of white leaped out across the room and played full upon the  coffee-table in the center.    Prepared as I was for something horrible, I know that I paled at sight  of the thing that was running round the edge of the envelope.    It was an insect, full six inches long, and of a vivid, venomous, red  color!  It had something of the appearance of a great ant, with its  long, quivering antennae and its febrile, horrible vitality; but it was  proportionately longer of body and smaller of head, and had numberless  rapidly moving legs.  In short, it was a giant centipede, apparently of  the scolopendra group, but of a form quite new to me.    These things I realized in one breathless instant; in the next--Smith  had dashed the thing's poisonous life out with one straight, true blow  of the golf club!    I leaped to the window and threw it widely open, feeling a silk thread  brush my hand as I did so.  A black shape was dropping, with incredible  agility from branch to branch of the ivy, and, without once offering a  mark for a revolver-shot, it merged into the shadows beneath the trees  of the garden.  As I turned and switched on the light Nayland Smith  dropped limply into a chair, leaning his head upon his hands.  Even  that grim courage had been tried sorely.    \"Never mind the dacoit, Petrie,\" he said.  \"Nemesis will know where to  find him.  We know now what causes the mark of the Zayat Kiss.  Therefore science is richer for our first brush with the enemy, and the  enemy is poorer--unless he has any more unclassified centipedes.  I  understand now something that has been puzzling me since I heard of  it--Sir Crichton's stifled cry.  When we remember that he was almost  past speech, it is"]]]
