[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14975"],[0,"Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases (#4)"],[1,"law is spreading its wings over the whole  country.    Men who, like Governor Tillman, start the ball of lynch law rolling for a  certain crime, are powerless to stop it when drunken or criminal white  toughs feel like hanging an Afro-American on any pretext.    Even to the better class of Afro-Americans the crime of rape is so  revolting they have too often taken the white man's word and given lynch  law neither the investigation nor condemnation it deserved.    They forget that a concession of the right to lynch a man for a certain  crime, not only concedes the right to lynch any person for any crime, but  (so frequently is the cry of rape now raised) it is in a fair way to stamp  us a race of rapists and desperadoes. They have gone on hoping and  believing that general education and financial strength would solve the  difficulty, and are devoting their energies to the accumulation of both.    The mob spirit has grown with the increasing intelligence of the  Afro-American. It has left the out-of-the-way places where ignorance  prevails, has thrown off the mask and with this new cry stalks in broad  daylight in large cities, the centers of civilization, and is encouraged  by the \"leading citizens\" and the press.          4 _The_ MALICIOUS _and_ UNTRUTHFUL WHITE PRESS      The _Daily Commercial_ and _Evening Scimitar_ of Memphis, Tenn., are owned  by leading business men of that city, and yet, in spite of the fact that  there had been no white woman in Memphis outraged by an Afro-American, and  that Memphis possessed a thrifty law-abiding, property-owning class of  Afro-Americans the _Commercial_ of May 17, under the head of \"More Rapes,  More Lynchings\" gave utterance to the following:      The lynching of three Negro scoundrels reported in our dispatches from    Anniston, Ala., for a brutal outrage committed upon a white woman will    be a text for much comment on \"Southern barbarism\" by Northern    newspapers; but we fancy it will hardly prove effective for campaign    purposes among intelligent people. The frequency of these lynchings    calls attention to the frequency of the crimes which causes lynching.    The \"Southern barbarism\" which deserves the serious attention of all    people North and South, is the barbarism which preys upon weak and    defenseless women. Nothing but the most prompt, speedy and extreme    punishment can hold in check the horrible and beastial propensities of    the Negro race. There is a strange similarity about a number of cases of    this character which have lately occurred.      In each case the crime was deliberately planned and perpetrated by    several Negroes. They watched for an opportunity when the women were    left without a protector. It was not a sudden yielding to a fit of    passion, but the consummation of a devilish purpose which has been    seeking and waiting for the opportunity. This feature of the crime not    only makes it the most fiendishly brutal, but it adds to the terror of    the situation in the thinly settled country communities. No man can    leave his family at night without the dread that some roving Negro    ruffian is watching and waiting for this opportunity. The swift    punishment which invariably follows these horrible crimes doubtless acts    as a deterring effect upon the Negroes in that immediate neighborhood    for a short time. But the lesson is not widely learned nor long    remembered. Then such crimes, equally atrocious, have happened in quick    succession, one in Tennessee, one in Arkansas, and one in Alabama. The    facts of the crime appear to appeal more to the Negro's lustful    imagination than the facts of the punishment do to his fears. He sets    aside all fear of death in any form when opportunity is found for the    gratification of his bestial desires.      There is small reason to hope for any change for the better. The    commission of this crime grows more frequent every year. The generation    of Negroes which have grown up since the war have lost in large measure    the traditional and wholesome awe of the white race which kept the    Negroes in subjection, even when their masters were in the army, and    their families left unprotected except by the slaves themselves. There    is no longer a restraint upon the brute passion of the Negro.      What is to be done? The crime of rape is always horrible, but the    Southern man there is nothing which so fills the soul with horror,    loathing and fury as the outraging of a white woman by a Negro. It is    the race question in the ugliest, vilest, most dangerous aspect. The    Negro as a political factor can be controlled. But neither laws nor    lynchings can subdue his lusts. Sooner or later it will force a crisis.    We do not know in what form it will come.    In its issue of June 4, the _Memphis Evening Scimitar_ gives the following  excuse for lynch law:      Aside from the violation of white women by Negroes, which is the    outcropping of a bestial perversion of instinct, the chief cause of    trouble between the races in the South is the Negro's lack of manners.    In the state of slavery he learned politeness from association with    white people, who took pains to teach him. Since the emancipation came    and the tie of mutual interest and regard between master and servant was    broken, the Negro has drifted away into a state which is neither freedom    nor bondage. Lacking the proper inspiration of the one and the    restraining force of the other he has taken up the idea that boorish    insolence is independence, and the exercise of a decent degree of    breeding toward white people is identical with servile submission. In    consequence of the prevalence of this notion there are many Negroes who    use every opportunity to make themselves offensive, particularly when    they think it can be done with impunity.      We have had too many instances right here in Memphis to doubt this, and    our experience is not exceptional. _The white people won't stand this    sort of thing, and whether they be insulted as individuals are as a    race, the response will be prompt and effectual._ The bloody riot of    1866, in which so many Negroes perished, was brought on principally by    the outrageous conduct of the blacks toward the whites on the streets.    It is also a remarkable and discouraging fact that the majority of such    scoundrels are Negroes who have received educational advantages at the    hands of the white taxpayers. They have got just enough of learning to    make them realize how hopelessly their race is behind the other in    everything that makes a great people, and they attempt to \"get even\" by    insolence, which is ever the resentment of inferiors. There are    well-bred Negroes among us, and it is truly unfortunate that they should    have to pay, even in part, the penalty of the offenses committed by the    baser sort, but this is the way of the world. The innocent must suffer    for the guilty. If the Negroes as a people possessed a hundredth part of    the self-respect which is evidenced by the courteous bearing of some    that the _Scimitar_ could name, the friction between the races would be    reduced to a minimum. It will not do to beg the question by pleading    that many white men are also stirring up strife. The Caucasian    blackguard simply obeys the promptings of a depraved disposition, and he    is seldom deliberately rough or offensive toward strangers or    unprotected women.      The Negro tough, on the contrary, is given to just that kind of    offending, and he almost invariably singles out white people as his    victims.    On March 9, 1892, there were lynched in this same city three of the best  specimens of young since-the-war Afro-American manhood. They were  peaceful, law-abiding citizens and energetic business men.    They believed the problem was to be solved by eschewing politics and  putting money in the purse. They owned a flourishing grocery business in a  thickly populated suburb of Memphis, and a white man named Barrett had one  on the opposite corner. After a personal difficulty which Barrett sought  by going into the \"People's Grocery\" drawing a pistol and was thrashed by  Calvin McDowell, he (Barrett) threatened to \"clean them out.\" These men  were a mile beyond the city limits and police protection; hearing that  Barrett's crowd was coming to attack them Saturday night, they mustered  forces, and prepared to defend themselves against the attack.    When Barrett came he led a _posse_ of officers, twelve in number, who  afterward claimed to be hunting a man for whom they had a warrant. That  twelve men in citizen's clothes should think it necessary to go in the  night to hunt one man who had never before been arrested, or made any  record as a criminal has never been explained. When they entered the back  door the young men thought the threatened attack was on, and fired into  them. Three of the officers were wounded, and when the _defending_ party  found it was officers of the law upon whom they had fired, they ceased and  got away.    Thirty-one men were arrested and thrown in jail as \"conspirators,\"  although they all declared more than once they did not know they were  firing on officers. Excitement was at fever beat until the morning papers,  two days after, announced that the wounded deputy sheriffs were out of  danger. This hindered rather than helped the plans of the whites. There  was no law on the statute books which would execute an Afro-American for  wounding a white man, but the \"unwritten law\" did. Three of these men, the  president, the manager and clerk of the grocery--\"the leaders of the  conspiracy\"--were secretly taken from jail and lynched in a shockingly  brutal manner. \"The Negroes are getting too independent,\" they say, \"we  must teach them a lesson.\"    What lesson? The lesson of subordination. \"Kill the leaders and it will  cow the Negro who dares to shoot a white man, even in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14976"],[0,"Mob Rule in New Orleans (#4)"],[1,"the others will    trouble you no more. That is the only thing to do--kill them, string    them up, lynch them! I will lead you, if you will but follow. On to the    Parish Prison and lynch Pierce!\"      They bore down on the Parish Prison like an avalanche, but the avalanche    split harmlessly on the blank walls of the jail, and Remy Klock sent out    a brief message: \"You can't have Pierce, and you can't get in.\" Up to    that time the mob had had no opposition, but Klock's answer chilled them    considerably. There was no deep-seated desperation in the crowd after    all, only, that wild lawlessness which leads to deeds of cruelty, but    not to stubborn battle. Around the corner from the prison is a row of    pawn and second-hand shops, and to these the mob took like the ducks to    the proverbial mill-pond, and the devastation they wrought upon Mr.    Fink's establishment was beautiful in its line.      Everything from breast pins to horse pistols went into the pockets of    the crowd, and in the melee a man was shot down, while just around the    corner somebody planted a long knife in the body of a little newsboy for    no reason as yet shown. Every now and then a Negro would be flushed    somewhere in the outskirts of the crowd and left beaten to a pulp. Just    how many were roughly handled will never be known, but the unlucky    thirteen had been severely beaten and maltreated up to a late hour, a    number of those being in the Charity Hospital under the bandages and    courtplaster of the doctors.    The first colored man to meet death at the hands of the mob was a  passenger on a street car. The mob had broken itself into fragments after  its disappointment at the jail, each fragment looking for a Negro to  kill. The bloodthirsty cruelty of one crowd is thus described by the  _Times-Democrat_:      \"We will get a Nigger down here, you bet!\" was the yelling boast that    went up from a thousand throats, and for the first time the march of the    mob was directed toward the downtown sections. The words of the rioters    were prophetic, for just as Canal Street was reached a car on the    Villere line came along.      \"Stop that car!\" cried half a hundred men. The advance guard, heeding    the injunction, rushed up to the slowly moving car, and several, seizing    the trolley, jerked it down.      \"Here's a Nigro!\" said half a dozen men who sprang upon the car.      The car was full of passengers at the time, among them several women.    When the trolley was pulled down and the car thrown in total darkness,    the latter began to scream, and for a moment or so it looked as if the    life of every person in the car was in peril, for some of the crowd with    demoniacal yells of \"There he goes!\" began to fire their weapons    indiscriminately. The passengers in the car hastily jumped to the ground    and joined the crowd, as it was evidently the safest place to be.      \"Where's that Nigger?\" was the query passed along the line, and with    that the search began in earnest. The Negro, after jumping off the car,    lost himself for a few moments in the crowd, but after a brief search he    was again located. The slight delay seemed, if possible, only to whet    the desire of the bloodthirsty crowd, for the reappearance of the Negro    was the signal for a chorus of screams and pistol shots directed at the    fugitive. With the speed of a deer, the man ran straight from the corner    of Canal and Villere to Customhouse Street. The pursuers, closely    following, kept up a running fire, but notwithstanding the fact that    they were right at the Negro's heels their aim was poor and their    bullets went wide of the mark.      The Negro, on reaching Customhouse Street, darted from the sidewalk out    into the middle of the street. This was the worst maneuver that he could    have made, as it brought him directly under the light from an arc lamp,    located on a nearby corner. When the Negro came plainly in view of the    foremost of the closely following mob they directed a volley at him.    Half a dozen pistols flashed simultaneously, and one of the bullets    evidently found its mark, for the Negro stopped short, threw up his    hands, wavered for a moment, and then started to run again. This stop,    slight as it was, proved fatal to the Negro's chances, for he had not    gotten twenty steps farther when several of the men in advance of the    others reached his side. A burly fellow, grabbing him with one hand,    dealt him a terrible blow on the head with the other. The wounded man    sank to the ground. The crowd pressed around him and began to beat him    and stamp him. The men in the rear pressed forward and those beating the    man were shoved forward. The half-dead Negro, when he was freed from his    assailants, crawled over to the gutter. The men behind, however, stopped    pushing when those in front yelled, \"We've got him,\" and then it was    that the attack on the bleeding Negro was resumed. A vicious kick    directed at the Negro's head sent him into the gutter, and for a moment    the body sank from view beneath the muddy, slimy water. \"Pull him out;    don't let him drown,\" was the cry, and instantly several of the men    around the half-drowned Negro bent down and drew the body out. Twisting    the body around they drew the head and shoulders up on the street, while    from the waist down the Negro's body remained under the water. As soon    as the crowd saw that the Negro was still alive they again began to beat    and kick him. Every few moments they would stop and striking matches    look into the man's face to see if he still lived. To better see if he    was dead they would stick lighted matches to his eyes. Finally,    believing he was dead they left him and started out to look for other    Negroes. Just about this time some one yelled, \"He ain't dead,\" and the    men came back and renewed the attack. While the men were beating and    pounding the prostrate form with stones and sticks a man in the crowd    ran up, and crying, \"I'll fix the d--- Negro,\" poked the muzzle of a    pistol almost against the body and fired. This shot must have ended the    man's life, for he lay like a stone, and realizing that they were    wasting energy in further attacks, the men left their victim lying in    the street.    The same paper, on the same day, July 26, describes the brutal butchery of  an aged colored man early in the morning:      Baptiste Philo, a Negro, seventy-five years of age, was a victim of mob    violence at Kerlerec and North Peters Streets about 2:30 o'clock this    morning. The old man is employed about the French Market, and was on his    way there when he was met by a crowd and desperately shot. The old man    found his way to the Third Precinct police station, where it was found    that he had received a ghastly wound in the abdomen. The ambulance was    summoned and he was conveyed to the Charity Hospital. The students    pronounced the wound fatal after a superficial examination.    Mob rule continued Thursday, its violence increasing every hour, until 2  p.m., when the climax seemed to be reached. The fact that colored men and  women had been made the victims of brutal mobs, chased through the  streets, killed upon the highways and butchered in their homes, did not  call the best element in New Orleans to active exertion in behalf of law  and order. The killing of a few Negroes more or less by irresponsible mobs  does not cut much figure in Louisiana. But when the reign of mob law  exerts a depressing influence upon the stock market and city securities  begin to show unsteady standing in money centers, then the strong arm of  the good white people of the South asserts itself and order is quickly  brought out of chaos.    It was so with New Orleans on that Thursday. The better element of the  white citizens began to realize that New Orleans in the hands of a mob  would not prove a promising investment for Eastern capital, so the better  element began to stir itself, not for the purpose of punishing the  brutality against the Negroes who had been beaten, or bringing to justice  the murderers of those who had been killed, but for the purpose of saving  the city's credit. The _Times-Democrat_, upon this phase of the situation  on Friday morning says:      When it became known later in the day that State bonds had depreciated    from a point to a point and a half on the New York market a new phase of    seriousness was manifest to the business community. Thinking men    realized that a continuance of unchecked disorder would strike a body    blow to the credit of the city and in all probability would complicate    the negotiation of the forthcoming improvement bonds. The bare thought    that such a disaster might be brought about by a few irresponsible boys,    tramps and ruffians, inflamed popular indignation to fever pitch. It was    all that was needed to bring to the aid of the authorities the active    personal cooperation of the entire better element.    With the financial credit of the city at stake, the good citizens rushed  to the rescue, and soon the Mayor was able to mobilize a posse of 1,000  willing men to assist the police in maintaining order, but rioting still  continued in different sections of the city. Colored men and women were  beaten, chased and shot whenever they made their appearance upon the  street. Late in the night a most despicable piece of villainy occurred on  Rousseau Street, where an aged colored woman was killed by the mob. The  _Times-Democrat_ thus describes, the murder:      Hannah Mabry, an old Negress, was shot and desperately wounded shortly    after midnight this morning while sleeping in her home at No. 1929    Rousseau Street. It was the work of a mob, and was evidently well    planned so far as escape was concerned, for the place was reached by    police officers, and a squad of the volunteer police within a very short    time"]]]
