I tell you, give but more--more, ever more, they ask:  Thus shall you hit the mark of gain and glory.  Seek to confound your auditory!  To satisfy them is a task.--  What ails you now? Is't suffering, or pleasure?    POET    Go, find yourself a more obedient slave!  What! shall the Poet that which Nature gave,  The highest right, supreme Humanity,  Forfeit so wantonly, to swell your treasure?  Whence o'er the heart his empire free?  The elements of Life how conquers he?  Is't not his heart's accord, urged outward far and dim,  To wind the world in unison with him?  When on the spindle, spun to endless distance,  By Nature's listless hand the thread is twirled,  And the discordant tones of all existence  In sullen jangle are together hurled,  Who, then, the changeless orders of creation  Divides, and kindles into rhythmic dance?  Who brings the One to join the general ordination,  Where it may throb in grandest consonance?  Who bids the storm to passion stir the bosom?  In brooding souls the sunset burn above?  Who scatters every fairest April blossom  Along the shining path of Love?  Who braids the noteless leaves to crowns, requiting  Desert with fame, in Action's every field?  Who makes Olympus sure, the Gods uniting?  The might of Man, as in the Bard revealed.    MERRY-ANDREW    So, these fine forces, in conjunction,  Propel the high poetic function,  As in a love-adventure they might play!  You meet by accident; you feel, you stay,  And by degrees your heart is tangled;  Bliss grows apace, and then its course is jangled;  You're ravished quite, then comes a touch of woe,  And there's a neat romance, completed ere you know!  Let us, then, such a drama give!  Grasp the exhaustless life that all men live!  Each shares therein, though few may comprehend:  Where'er you touch, there's interest without end.  In motley pictures little light,  Much error, and of truth a glimmering mite,  Thus the best beverage is supplied,  Whence all the world is cheered and edified.  Then, at your play, behold the fairest flower  Of youth collect, to hear the revelation!  Each tender soul, with sentimental power,  Sucks melancholy food from your creation;  And now in this, now that, the leaven works.  For each beholds what in his bosom lurks.  They still are moved at once to weeping or to laughter,  Still wonder at your flights, enjoy the show they see:  A mind, once formed, is never suited after;  One yet in growth will ever grateful be.    POET    Then give me back that time of pleasures,  While yet in joyous growth I sang,--  When, like a fount, the crowding measures  Uninterrupted gushed and sprang!  Then bright mist veiled the world before me,  In opening buds a marvel woke,  As I the thousand blossoms broke,  Which every valley richly bore me!  I nothing had, and yet enough for youth--  Joy in Illusion, ardent thirst for Truth.  Give, unrestrained, the old emotion,  The bliss that touched the verge of pain,  The strength of Hate, Love's deep devotion,--  O, give me back my youth again!    MERRY ANDREW    Youth, good my friend, you certainly require  When foes in combat sorely press you;  When lovely maids, in fond desire,  Hang on your bosom and caress you;  When from the hard-won goal the wreath  Beckons afar, the race awaiting;  When, after dancing out your breath,  You pass the night in dissipating:--  But that familiar harp with soul  To play,--with grace and bold expression,  And towards a self-erected goal  To walk with many a sweet digression,--  This, aged Sirs, belongs to you,  And we no less revere you for that reason:  Age childish makes, they say, but 'tis not true;  We're only genuine children still, in Age's season!      MANAGER    The words you've bandied are sufficient;  'Tis deeds that I prefer to see:  In compliments you're both proficient,  But might, the while, more useful be.  What need to talk of Inspiration?  'Tis no companion of Delay.  If Poetry be your vocation,  Let Poetry your will obey!  Full well you know what here is wanting;  The crowd for strongest drink is panting,  And such, forthwith, I'd have you brew.  What's left undone to-day, To-morrow will not do.  Waste not a day in vain digression:  With resolute, courageous trust  Seize every possible impression,  And make it firmly your possession;  You'll then work on, because you must.  Upon our German stage, you know it,  Each tries his hand at what he will;  So, take of traps and scenes your fill,  And all you find, be sure to show it!  Use both the great and lesser heavenly light,--  Squander the stars in any number,  Beasts, birds, trees, rocks, and all such lumber,  Fire, water, darkness, Day and Night!  Thus, in our booth's contracted sphere,  The circle of Creation will appear,  And move, as we deliberately impel,  From Heaven, across the World, to Hell!  [Illustration]  [Illustration]    PROLOGUE IN HEAVEN    THE LORD THE HEAVENLY HOST _Afterwards_  MEPHISTOPHELES    (_The_ THREE ARCHANGELS _come forward_.)      RAPHAEL    The sun-orb sings, in emulation,  'Mid brother-spheres, his ancient round:  His path predestined through Creation  He ends with step of thunder-sound.  The angels from his visage splendid  Draw power, whose measure none can say;  The lofty works, uncomprehended,  Are bright as on the earliest day.      GABRIEL    And swift, and swift beyond conceiving,  The splendor of the world goes round,  Day's Eden-brightness still relieving  The awful Night's intense profound:  The ocean-tides in foam are breaking,  Against the rocks' deep bases hurled,  And both, the spheric race partaking,  Eternal, swift, are onward whirled!      MICHAEL    And rival storms abroad are surging  From sea to land, from land to sea.  A chain of deepest action forging  Round all, in wrathful energy.  There flames a desolation, blazing  Before the Thunder's crashing way:  Yet, Lord, Thy messengers are praising  The gentle movement of Thy Day.      THE THREE    Though still by them uncomprehended,  From these the angels draw their power,  And all Thy works, sublime and splendid,  Are bright as in Creation's hour.      MEPHISTOPHELES    Since Thou, O Lord, deign'st to approach again  And ask us how we do, in manner kindest,  And heretofore to meet myself wert fain,  Among Thy menials, now, my face Thou findest.  Pardon, this troop I cannot follow after  With lofty speech, though by them scorned and spurned:  My pathos certainly would move Thy laughter,  If Thou hadst not all merriment unlearned.  Of suns and worlds I've nothing to be quoted;  How men torment themselves, is all I've noted.  The little god o' the world sticks to the same old way,  And is as whimsical as on Creation's day.  Life somewhat better might content him,  But for the gleam of heavenly light which Thou hast lent    him:  He calls it Reason--thence his power's increased,  To be far beastlier than any beast.  Saving Thy Gracious Presence, he to me  A long-legged grasshopper appears to be,  That springing flies, and flying springs,  And in the grass the same old ditty sings.  Would he still lay among the grass he grows in!  Each bit of dung he seeks, to stick his nose in.      THE LORD    Hast thou, then, nothing more to mention?  Com'st ever, thus, with ill intention?  Find'st nothing right on earth, eternally?      MEPHISTOPHELES    No, Lord! I find things, there, still bad as they can be.  Man's misery even to pity moves my nature;  I've scarce the heart to plague the wretched creature.      THE LORD    Know'st Faust?      MEPHISTOPHELES    The Doctor Faust?      THE LORD    My servant, he!      MEPHISTOPHELES    Forsooth! He serves you after strange devices:  No earthly meat or drink the fool suffices:  His spirit's ferment far aspireth;  Half conscious of his frenzied, crazed unrest,  The fairest stars from Heaven he requireth,  From Earth the highest raptures and the best,  And all the Near and Far that he desireth  Fails to subdue the tumult of his breast.      THE LORD    Though still confused his service unto Me,  I soon shall lead him to a clearer morning.  Sees not the gardener, even while buds his tree,  Both flower and fruit the future years adorning?      MEPHISTOPHELES    What will you bet? There's still a chance to gain him,  If unto me full leave you give,  Gently upon _my_ road to train him!      THE LORD    As long as he on earth shall live,  So long I make no prohibition.  While Man's desires and aspirations stir,  He cannot choose but err.      MEPHISTOPHELES    My thanks! I find the dead no acquisition,  And never cared to have them in my keeping.  I much prefer the cheeks where ruddy blood is leaping,  And when a corpse approaches, close my house:  It goes with me, as with the cat the mouse.      THE LORD    Enough! What thou hast asked is granted.  Turn off this spirit from his fountain-head;  To trap him, let thy snares be planted,  And him, with thee, be downward led;  Then stand abashed, when thou art forced to say:  A good man, through obscurest aspiration,  Has still an instinct of the one true way.      MEPHISTOPHELES    Agreed! But 'tis a short probation.  About my bet I feel no trepidation.  If I fulfill my expectation,  You'll let me triumph with a swelling breast:  Dust shall he eat, and with a zest,  As did a certain snake, my near relation.      THE LORD    Therein thou'rt free, according to thy merits;  The like of thee have never moved My hate.  Of all the bold, denying Spirits,  The waggish knave least trouble doth create.  Man's active nature, flagging, seeks too soon the level;  Unqualified repose he learns to crave;  Whence, willingly, the comrade him I gave,  Who works, excites, and must create, as Devil.  But ye, God's sons in love and duty,  Enjoy the rich, the ever-living Beauty!  Creative Power, that works eternal schemes,  Clasp you in bonds of love, relaxing never,  And what in wavering apparition gleams  Fix in its place with thoughts that stand forever!

MEPHISTOPHELES (_so"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/146"],[0,"A Little Princess (#4)"],[1,"uisite.\"    \"You ought to have told me,\" exclaimed Miss Minchin, much mortified,  turning to Sara.    \"I--I tried,\" said Sara.  \"I--I suppose I did not begin right.\"    Miss Minchin knew she had tried, and that it had not been her fault  that she was not allowed to explain.  And when she saw that the pupils  had been listening and that Lavinia and Jessie were giggling behind  their French grammars, she felt infuriated.    \"Silence, young ladies!\" she said severely, rapping upon the desk.  \"Silence at once!\"    And she began from that minute to feel rather a grudge against her show  pupil.        3    Ermengarde      On that first morning, when Sara sat at Miss Minchin's side, aware that  the whole schoolroom was devoting itself to observing her, she had  noticed very soon one little girl, about her own age, who looked at her  very hard with a pair of light, rather dull, blue eyes.  She was a fat  child who did not look as if she were in the least clever, but she had  a good-naturedly pouting mouth. Her flaxen hair was braided in a tight  pigtail, tied with a ribbon, and she had pulled this pigtail around her  neck, and was biting the end of the ribbon, resting her elbows on the  desk, as she stared wonderingly at the new pupil.  When Monsieur  Dufarge began to speak to Sara, she looked a little frightened; and  when Sara stepped forward and, looking at him with the innocent,  appealing eyes, answered him, without any warning, in French, the fat  little girl gave a startled jump, and grew quite red in her awed  amazement. Having wept hopeless tears for weeks in her efforts to  remember that \"la mere\" meant \"the mother,\" and \"le pere,\" \"the  father,\"--when one spoke sensible English--it was almost too much for  her suddenly to find herself listening to a child her own age who  seemed not only quite familiar with these words, but apparently knew  any number of others, and could mix them up with verbs as if they were  mere trifles.    She stared so hard and bit the ribbon on her pigtail so fast that she  attracted the attention of Miss Minchin, who, feeling extremely cross  at the moment, immediately pounced upon her.    \"Miss St. John!\" she exclaimed severely.  \"What do you mean by such  conduct?  Remove your elbows!  Take your ribbon out of your mouth! Sit  up at once!\"    Upon which Miss St. John gave another jump, and when Lavinia and Jessie  tittered she became redder than ever--so red, indeed, that she almost  looked as if tears were coming into her poor, dull, childish eyes; and  Sara saw her and was so sorry for her that she began rather to like her  and want to be her friend.  It was a way of hers always to want to  spring into any fray in which someone was made uncomfortable or unhappy.    \"If Sara had been a boy and lived a few centuries ago,\" her father used  to say, \"she would have gone about the country with her sword drawn,  rescuing and defending everyone in distress.  She always wants to fight  when she sees people in trouble.\"    So she took rather a fancy to fat, slow, little Miss St. John, and kept  glancing toward her through the morning.  She saw that lessons were no  easy matter to her, and that there was no danger of her ever being  spoiled by being treated as a show pupil. Her French lesson was a  pathetic thing.  Her pronunciation made even Monsieur Dufarge smile in  spite of himself, and Lavinia and Jessie and the more fortunate girls  either giggled or looked at her in wondering disdain.  But Sara did not  laugh.  She tried to look as if she did not hear when Miss St. John  called \"le bon pain,\" \"lee bong pang.\"  She had a fine, hot little  temper of her own, and it made her feel rather savage when she heard  the titters and saw the poor, stupid, distressed child's face.    \"It isn't funny, really,\" she said between her teeth, as she bent over  her book.  \"They ought not to laugh.\"    When lessons were over and the pupils gathered together in groups to  talk, Sara looked for Miss St. John, and finding her bundled rather  disconsolately in a window-seat, she walked over to her and spoke. She  only said the kind of thing little girls always say to each other by  way of beginning an acquaintance, but there was something friendly  about Sara, and people always felt it.    \"What is your name?\" she said.    To explain Miss St. John's amazement one must recall that a new pupil  is, for a short time, a somewhat uncertain thing; and of this new pupil  the entire school had talked the night before until it fell asleep  quite exhausted by excitement and contradictory stories. A new pupil  with a carriage and a pony and a maid, and a voyage from India to  discuss, was not an ordinary acquaintance.    \"My name's Ermengarde St. John,\" she answered.    \"Mine is Sara Crewe,\" said Sara.  \"Yours is very pretty.  It sounds  like a story book.\"    \"Do you like it?\" fluttered Ermengarde.  \"I--I like yours.\"    Miss St. John's chief trouble in life was that she had a clever father.  Sometimes this seemed to her a dreadful calamity.  If you have a father  who knows everything, who speaks seven or eight languages, and has  thousands of volumes which he has apparently learned by heart, he  frequently expects you to be familiar with the contents of your lesson  books at least; and it is not improbable that he will feel you ought to  be able to remember a few incidents of history and to write a French  exercise.  Ermengarde was a severe trial to Mr. St. John. He could not  understand how a child of his could be a notably and unmistakably dull  creature who never shone in anything.    \"Good heavens!\" he had said more than once, as he stared at her, \"there  are times when I think she is as stupid as her Aunt Eliza!\"    If her Aunt Eliza had been slow to learn and quick to forget a thing  entirely when she had learned it, Ermengarde was strikingly like her.  She was the monumental dunce of the school, and it could not be denied.    \"She must be MADE to learn,\" her father said to Miss Minchin.    Consequently Ermengarde spent the greater part of her life in disgrace  or in tears.  She learned things and forgot them; or, if she remembered  them, she did not understand them.  So it was natural that, having made  Sara's acquaintance, she should sit and stare at her with profound  admiration.    \"You can speak French, can't you?\" she said respectfully.    Sara got on to the window-seat, which was a big, deep one, and, tucking  up her feet, sat with her hands clasped round her knees.    \"I can speak it because I have heard it all my life,\" she answered.  \"You could speak it if you had always heard it.\"    \"Oh, no, I couldn't,\" said Ermengarde.  \"I NEVER could speak it!\"    \"Why?\" inquired Sara, curiously.    Ermengarde shook her head so that the pigtail wobbled.    \"You heard me just now,\" she said.  \"I'm always like that. I can't SAY  the words.  They're so queer.\"    She paused a moment, and then added with a touch of awe in her voice,  \"You are CLEVER, aren't you?\"    Sara looked out of the window into the dingy square, where the sparrows  were hopping and twittering on the wet, iron railings and the sooty  branches of the trees.  She reflected a few moments. She had heard it  said very often that she was \"clever,\" and she wondered if she was--and  IF she was, how it had happened.    \"I don't know,\" she said.  \"I can't tell.\"  Then, seeing a mournful  look on the round, chubby face, she gave a little laugh and changed the  subject.    \"Would you like to see Emily?\" she inquired.    \"Who is Emily?\"  Ermengarde asked, just as Miss Minchin had done.    \"Come up to my room and see,\" said Sara, holding out her hand.    They jumped down from the window-seat together, and went upstairs.    \"Is it true,\" Ermengarde whispered, as they went through the hall--\"is  it true that you have a playroom all to yourself?\"    \"Yes,\" Sara answered.  \"Papa asked Miss Minchin to let me have one,  because--well, it was because when I play I make up stories and tell  them to myself, and I don't like people to hear me. It spoils it if I  think people listen.\"    They had reached the passage leading to Sara's room by this time, and  Ermengarde stopped short, staring, and quite losing her breath.    \"You MAKE up stories!\" she gasped.  \"Can you do that--as well as speak  French?  CAN you?\"    Sara looked at her in simple surprise.    \"Why, anyone can make up things,\" she said.  \"Have you never tried?\"    She put her hand warningly on Ermengarde's.    \"Let us go very quietly to the door,\" she whispered, \"and then I will  open it quite suddenly; perhaps we may catch her.\"    She was half laughing, but there was a touch of mysterious hope in her  eyes which fascinated Ermengarde, though she had not the remotest idea  what it meant, or whom it was she wanted to \"catch,\" or why she wanted  to catch her.  Whatsoever she meant, Ermengarde was sure it was  something delightfully exciting.  So, quite thrilled with expectation,  she followed her on tiptoe along the passage. They made not the least  noise until they reached the door. Then Sara suddenly turned the  handle, and threw it wide open. Its opening revealed the room quite  neat and quiet, a fire gently burning in the grate, and a wonderful  doll sitting in a chair by it, apparently reading a book.    \"Oh, she got back to her seat before we could see her!\"  Sara  explained. \"Of course they always do.  They are as quick as lightning.\"    Ermengarde looked from her to the doll and back again.    \"Can she--walk?\" she asked breathlessly.    \"Yes,\" answered Sara.  \"At least I believe she can.  At least I PRETEND  I believe she can.  And that makes it seem as if it were true. Have you  never pretended things?\"    \"No,\" said Ermengarde.  \"Never.  I--tell me about it.\"    She was so bewitched by this odd, new companion that she actually  stared at Sara instead of at Emily--notwithstanding that Emily was the  most attractive doll person she had ever seen.    \"Let us sit down,\" said Sara, \"and I will tell"]]]
