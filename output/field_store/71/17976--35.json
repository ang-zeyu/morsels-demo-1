[Illustration: 018.jpg MYLITTA-ANAHITA]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from Loftus    [Illustration: 018a.jpg NANA-ANAHITA]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a coin of King Huvishka,       published by Percy Gardner.    Once incarnate, a Fravasliis devotes himself to the well-being of the  mortal with whom he is associated; and when once more released from  the flesh, he continues the struggle against evil with an energy whose  efficacy is proportionate to the virtue and purity displayed in life by  the mortal to whom he has been temporarily joined. The last six days  of the year are dedicated to the Fravashis. They leave their heavenly  abodes at this time to visit the spots which were their earthly  dwelling-places, and they wander through the villages inquiring, \"Who  wishes to hire us? Who will offer us a sacrifice? Who will make us their  own, welcome us, and receive us with plenteous offerings of food and  raiment, with a prayer which bestows sanctity on him who offers it?\" And  if they find a man to hearken to their request, they bless him: \"May his  house be blessed with herds of oxen and troops of men, a swift horse  and a strongly built chariot, a man who knoweth how to pray to God, a  chieftain in the council who may ever offer us sacrifices with a hand  filled with food and raiment, with a prayer which bestows sanctity on  him who offers it!\" Ahura-mazda created the universe, not by the work  of his hands, but by the magic of his word, and he desired to create it  entirely free from defects. His creation, however, can only exist by  the free play and equilibrium of opposing forces, to which he gives  activity: the incompatibility of tendency displayed by these forces, and  their alternations of growth and decay, inspired the Iranians with the  idea that they were the result of two contradictory principles, the one  beneficent and good, the other adverse to everything emanating from the  former.*         * Spiegel, who at first considered that the Iranian dualism       was derived from polytheism, and was a preliminary stage in       the development of monotheism, held afterwards that a rigid       monotheism had preceded this dualism. The classical writers,       who knew Zoroastrianism at the height of its glory, never       suggested that the two principles might be derived from a       superior principle, nor that they were subject to such a       principle. The Iranian books themselves nowhere definitely       affirm that there existed a single principle distinct from       the two opposing principles.    In opposition to the god of light, they necessarily formed the idea of  a god of darkness, the god of the underworld, who presides over death,  Angro-mainyus. The two opposing principles reigned at first, each in his  own domain, as rivals, but not as irreconcilable adversaries: they were  considered as in fixed opposition to each other, and as having coexisted  for ages without coming into actual conflict, separated as they were by  the intervening void. As long as the principle of good was content  to remain shut up inactive in his barren glory, the principle of evil  slumbered unconscious in a darkness that knew no beginning; but when  at last \"the spirit who giveth increase\"--Spento-mainyus--determined to  manifest himself, the first throes of his vivifying activity roused from  inertia the spirit of destruction and of pain, Angro-mainyus. The heaven  was not yet in existence, nor the waters, nor the earth, nor ox, nor  fire, nor man, nor demons, nor brute beasts, nor any living thing, when  the evil spirit hurled himself upon the light to quench it for ever,  but Ahura-mazda had already called forth the ministers of his  will--Amesha-spentas, Yazatas, Fravashis--and he recited the prayer of  twenty-one words in which all the elements of morality are summed up,  the Ahuna-vairya: \"The will of the Lord is the rule of good. Let the  gifts of Vohu-mano be bestowed on the works accomplished, at this  moment, for Mazda. He makes Ahura to reign, he who protects the poor.\"  The effect of this prayer was irresistible: \"When Ahura had pronounced  the first part of the formula, Zanak Minoi, the spirit of destruction,  bowed himself with terror; at the second part he fell upon his knees;  and at the third and last he felt himself powerless to hurt the  creatures of Ahura-mazda.\"*         * Theopompus was already aware of this alternation of good       and bad periods. According to the tradition enshrined in the       first chapter of the Bundehesh, it was the result of a sort       of compact agreed upon at the beginning by Ahura-mazda and       Angro-mainyus. Ahura-mazda, rearing to be overcome if he       entered upon the struggle immediately, but sure of final       victory if he could gain time, proposed to his adversary a       truce of nine thousand years, at the expiration of which the       battle should begin. As soon as the compact was made, Angro-       mainyus realised that he had been tricked into taking a       false step, but it was not till after three thousand years       that he decided to break the truce and open the conflict.    The strife, kindled at the beginning of time between the two gods, has  gone on ever since with alternations of success and defeat; each in turn  has the victory for a regular period of three thousand years; but when  these periods are ended, at the expiration of twelve thousand years,  evil will be finally and for ever defeated. While awaiting this blessed  fulness of time, as Spento-mainyus shows himself in all that is good  and beautiful, in light, virtue, and justice, so Angro-mainyus is to be  perceived in all that is hateful and ugly, in darkness, sin, and crime.  Against the six Amesha-spentas he sets in array six spirits of  equal power--Akem-mano, evil thought; Andra, the devouring fire, who  introduces discontent and sin wherever he penetrates; Sauru, the flaming  arrow of death, who inspires bloodthirsty tyrants, who incites men to  theft and murder; Naongaithya, arrogance and pride; Tauru, thirst; and  Zairi, hunger.*         * The last five of these spirits are enumerated in the       _Vendidad_, and the first, Akem-mano, is there replaced by       Nasu, the chief spirit of evil.    To the Yazatas he opposed the Daevas, who never cease to torment  mankind, and so through all the ranks of nature he set over against each  good and useful creation a counter-creation of rival tendency. \"'Like  a fly he crept into' and infected 'the whole universe.' He rendered the  world as dark at full noonday as in the darkest night. He covered the  soil with vermin, with his creatures of venomous bite and poisonous  sting, with serpents, scorpions, and frogs, so that there was not a  space as small as a needle's point but swarmed with his vermin. He smote  vegetation, and of a sudden the plants withered.... He attacked the  flames, and mingled them with smoke and dimness. The planets, with their  thousands of demons, dashed against the vault of heaven and waged war on  the stars, and the universe became darkened like a space which the fire  blackens with its smoke.\" And the conflict grew ever keener over the  world and over man, of whom the evil one was jealous, and whom he sought  to humiliate.

The children of Angro-mainyus disguised themselves under those monstrous  forms in which the imagination of the Chaldaeans had clothed the allies  of Mummu-Tiamat, such as lions with bulls' heads, and the wings and  claws of eagles, which the Achaemenian king combats on behalf of his  subjects, boldly thrusting them through with his short sword. Aeshma of  the blood-stained lance, terrible in wrath, is the most trusted leader  of these dread bands,* the chief of twenty other Daevas of repulsive  aspect--Asto-vidhotu, the demon of death, who would devote to  destruction the estimable Fravashis;** Apaosha, the enemy of Tishtrya  the wicked black horse, the bringer of drought, who interferes with the  distribution of the fertilising waters; and Buiti, who essayed to kill  Zoroaster at his birth.***         * The name Aeshma means _anger_. He is the Asmodeus, Aeshmo-       daevo, of Rabbinic legends.         ** The name of this demon signifies _He who separates the       bones_.         *** The Greater Bundehesh connects the demon Buiti with the       Indian Buddha, and J. Darmestefer seems inclined to accept       this interpretation. In this case we must either admit that       the demon Buiti is of relatively late origin, or that he       has, in the legend of Zoroaster, taken the place of a demon       whose name resembled his own closely enough to admit of the       assimilation.    The female demons, the Bruges, the Incubi (Yatus), the Succubi  (Pairika), the Peris of our fairy tales, mingled familiarly with mankind  before the time of the prophet, and contracted with them fruitful  alliances, but Zoroaster broke up their ranks, and prohibited them  from becoming incarnate in any form but that of beasts; their hatred,  however, is still unquenched, and their power will only be effectually  overthrown at the consummation of time. It is a matter of uncertainty  whether the Medes already admitted the possibility of a fresh  revelation, preparing the latest generations of mankind for the advent  of the reign of good. The traditions enshrined in the sacred books  of Iran announce the coming of three prophets, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17330"],[0,"History of Egypt From 330 B.C. To the Present Time, Volume 10 (of 12) (#4)"],[1,"hated yoke of Persia. The Persians had long been  looked upon as their natural enemies, and in the pride of their success  had added insults to the other evils of being governed by the satrap of  a conqueror. They had not even gained the respect of the conquered by  their warlike courage, for Egypt had in a great part been conquered and  held by Greek mercenaries.    The Persian forces had been mostly withdrawn from the country by  Sabaces, the satrap of Egypt, to be led against Alexander in Asia Minor,  and had formed part of the army of Darius when he was beaten near the  town of Issus on the coast of Cilicia. The garrisons were not strong  enough to guard the towns left in their charge; the Greek fleet easily  overpowered the Egyptian fleet in the harbour of Pelusium, and the town  opened its gates to Alexander. Here he left a garrison, and, ordering  his fleet to meet him at Memphis, he marched along the river's bank to  Heliopolis. All the towns, on his approach, opened their gates to him.  Mazakes, who had been left without an army, as satrap of Egypt, when  Sabaces led the troops into Asia Minor, and who had heard of the death  of Sabaces, and that Alexander was master of Phoenicia, Syria, and the  north of Arabia, had no choice but to yield. The Macedonian army crossed  the Nile near Heliopolis, and then entered Memphis.    [Illustration: 019.jpg TRANSPORTING GRAIN ON THE NILE]    Memphis had long been the chief city of all Egypt, even when not the  seat of government. In earlier ages, when the warlike virtues of the  Thebans had made Egypt the greatest kingdom in the world, Memphis and  the lowland corn-fields of the Delta paid tribute to Thebes; but,  with the improvements in navigation, the cities on the coast rose in  importance; the navigation of the Red Sea, though always dangerous,  became less dreaded, and Thebes lost the toll on the carrying trade of  the Nile. Wealth alone, however, would not have given the sovereignty  to Lower Egypt, had not the Greek mercenaries been at hand to fight for  those who would pay them. The kings of Sais had guarded their thrones  with Greek shields; and it was on the rash but praiseworthy attempt  of Amasis to lessen the power of these mercenaries that they joined  Cambyses, and Egypt became a Persian province. In the struggles of the  Egyptians to throw off the Persian yoke, we see little more than the  Athenians and Spartans carrying on their old quarrels on the coasts  and plains of the Delta; and the Athenians, who counted their losses  by ships, not by men, said that in their victories and defeats together  Egypt had cost them two hundred triremes. Hence, when Alexander, by  his successes in Greece, had put a stop to the feuds at home, the  mercenaries of both parties flocked to his conquering standard, and  he found himself on the throne of Upper and Lower Egypt without any  struggle being made against him by the Egyptians. The Greek part of  the population, who had been living in Egypt as foreigners, now found  themselves masters. Egypt became at once a Greek kingdom, as though  the blood and language of the people were changed at the conqueror's  bidding.    Alexander's character as a triumphant general gains little from this  easy conquest of an unwarlike country, and the overthrow of a crumbling  monarchy. But as the founder of a new Macedonian state, and for  reuniting the scattered elements of society in Lower Egypt after the  Persian conquest, in the only form in which a government could be  made to stand, he deserves to be placed among the least mischievous of  conquerors. We trace his march, not by the ruin, misery, and anarchy  which usually follow in the rear of an army, but by the building of  new cities, the more certain administration of justice, the revival of  trade, and the growth of learning. On reaching Memphis, his first care  was to prove to the Egyptians that he was come to re-establish their  ancient monarchy. He went in state to the temple of Apis, and sacrificed  to the sacred bull, as the native kings had done at their coronations;  and gamed the good-will of the crowd by games and music, Performed by  skilful Greeks for their amusement.    [Illustration: 021.jpg PHTAH the god of Memphis]    But though the temple of Phtah at Memphis, in which the state ceremonies  were performed, had risen in beauty and importance by the repeated  additions of the later kings, who had fixed the seat of government in  Lower Egypt, yet the Sun, or Amon-Ra, or Kneph-Ra, the god of Thebes, or  Jupiter-Amnion, as he was called by the Greeks, was the god under whose  spreading wings Egypt had seen its proudest days. Every Egyptian king  had called himself \"the son of the Sun;\" those who had reigned at Thebes  had boasted that they were \"beloved by Amon-Ra;\" and when Alexander  ordered the ancient titles to be used towards himself, he wished to lay  his offerings in the temple of this god, and to be acknowledged by the  priests as his son. As a reader of Homer, and the pupil of Aristotle,  he must have wished to see the wonders of \"Egyptian Thebes,\" the proper  place for this ceremony; and it could only have been because, as a  general, he had not time for a march of five hundred miles, that he  chose the nearer and less known temple of Kneph-Ra, in the oasis of  Ammon, one hundred and eighty miles from the coast.    Accordingly, he floated down the river from Memphis to the sea,  taking with him the light-armed troops and the royal band of  knights-companions. When he reached Canopus, he sailed westward along  the coast, and landed at Rhacotis, a small village on the spot where  Alexandria now stands. Here he made no stay; but, as he passed through  it, he must have seen at a glance, for he was never there a second time,  that the place was formed by nature to be a great harbour, and that with  a little help from art it would be the port of all Egypt. The mouths of  the Nile were too shallow for the ever increasing size of the merchant  vessels which were then being built; and the engineers found the deeper  water which was wanted, between the village of Rhacotis and the little  island of pharos. It was all that he had seen and admired at Tyre, but  it was on a larger scale and with deeper water. It was the very spot  that he was in search of; in every way suitable for the Greek colony  which he proposed to found as the best means of keeping Egypt in  obedience. Even before the time of Homer, the island of Pharos had  given shelter to the Greek traders on that coast. He gave his orders  to Hinocrates the architect to improve the harbour, and to lay down  the plan of his new city; and the success of the undertaking proved  the wisdom both of the statesman and of the builder, for the city of  Alexandria subsequently became the most famous of all the commercial and  intellectual centres of antiquity. From Rhacotis Alexander marched along  the coast to Parastonium, a distance of about two hundred miles  through the desert; and there, or on his way there, he was met by the  ambassadors from Cyrene, who were sent with gifts to beg for peace,  and to ask him to honour their city with a visit. Alexander graciously  received the gifts of the Cyrenaeans, and promised them his friendship,  but could not spare time to visit their city; and, without stopping, he  turned southward to the oasis.    At Memphis Alexander received the ambassadors that came from Greece to  wish him joy of his success; he reviewed his troops, and gave out his  plans for the government of the kingdom. He threw bridges of boats over  the Nile at the ford below Memphis, and also over the several branches  of the river. He divided the country into two nomarchies or judgeships,  and to fill these two offices of nomarchs or chief judges, the highest  civil offices in the kingdom, he chose Doloaspis and Petisis, two  Egyptians. Their duty was to watch over the due administration of  justice, one in Upper and the other in Lower Egypt, and perhaps to hear  appeals from the lower judges.    He left the garrisons in the command of his own Greek generals;  Pantaleon commanded the counts, or knights-companions, who garrisoned  Memphis, and Pole-mon was governor of Pelusium. These were the chief  fortresses in the kingdom: Memphis overlooked the Delta, the navigation  of the river, and the pass to Upper Egypt; Pelusium was the harbour for  the ships of war, and the frontier town on the only side on which Egypt  could be attacked. The other cities were given to other governors;  Licidas commanded the mercenaries, Peucestes and Balacrus the other  troops, Eugnostus was secretary, while AEschylus and Ephippus were left  as overlookers, or perhaps, in the language of modern governments, as  civil commissioners. Apollonius was made prefect of Libya, of which  district Paraetonium was the capital, and Cleomenes prefect of Arabia at  Heroopolis, in guard of that frontier. Orders were given to all these  generals that justice was to be administered by the Egyptian nomarchs  according to the common law or ancient customs of the land. Petisis,  however, either never entered upon his office or soon quitted it, and  Doloaspis was left nomarch of all Egypt.    Alexander sent into the Thebaid a body of seven thousand Samaritans,  whose quarrels with the Jews made them wish to leave their own country.  He gave them lands to cultivate on the banks of the Nile which had  gone out of cultivation with the gradual decline of Upper Egypt; and he  employed them to guard the province against invasion or rebellion. He  did not stay in Egypt longer than was necessary to give these orders,  but hastened towards the Euphrates to meet Darius. In his absence Egypt  remained quiet and happy. Peucestes soon followed him to Babylon with  some of the troops that had been left in Egypt; and Cleomenes, the  governor of Heroopolis, was then made collector of the taxes and prefect  of Egypt. Cleomenes was a bad man; he disobeyed the "]]]
