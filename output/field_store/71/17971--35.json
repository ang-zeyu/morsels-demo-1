[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17310"],[0,"Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas (#4)"],[1," which will enable me to draw nigh unto  Thee and will purge me from my trespasses which have intervened between me  and Thy forgiveness and Thy pardon.    Verily, Thou art the Potent, the Bountiful. No God is there but Thee, the  Mighty, the Gracious.    The tenth Glad-Tidings    As a token of grace from God, the Revealer of this Most Great  Announcement, We have removed from the Holy Scriptures and Tablets the law  prescribing the destruction of books.    The eleventh Glad-Tidings    It is permissible to study sciences and arts, but such sciences as are  useful and would redound to the progress and advancement of the people.  Thus hath it been decreed by Him Who is the Ordainer, the All-Wise.    The twelfth Glad-Tidings    It is enjoined upon every one of you to engage in some form of occupation,  such as crafts, trades and the like. We have graciously exalted your  engagement in such work to the rank of worship unto God, the True One.  Ponder ye in your hearts the grace and the blessings of God and render  thanks unto Him at eventide and at dawn. Waste not your time in idleness  and sloth. Occupy yourselves with that which profiteth yourselves and  others. Thus hath it been decreed in this Tablet from whose horizon the  day-star of wisdom and utterance shineth resplendent.    The most despised of men in the sight of God are those who sit idly and  beg. Hold ye fast unto the cord of material means, placing your whole  trust in God, the Provider of all means. When anyone occupieth himself in  a craft or trade, such occupation itself is regarded in the estimation of  God as an act of worship; and this is naught but a token of His infinite  and all-pervasive bounty.    The thirteenth Glad-Tidings    The men of God's House of Justice have been charged with the affairs of  the people. They, in truth, are the Trustees of God among His servants and  the daysprings of authority in His countries.    O people of God! That which traineth the world is Justice, for it is  upheld by two pillars, reward and punishment. These two pillars are the  sources of life to the world. Inasmuch as for each day there is a new  problem and for every problem an expedient solution, such affairs should  be referred to the Ministers of the House of Justice that they may act  according to the needs and requirements of the time. They that, for the  sake of God, arise to serve His Cause, are the recipients of divine  inspiration from the unseen Kingdom. It is incumbent upon all to be  obedient unto them. All matters of State should be referred to the House  of Justice, but acts of worship must be observed according to that which  God hath revealed in His Book.    O people of Baha! Ye are the dawning-places of the love of God and the  daysprings of His loving-kindness. Defile not your tongues with the  cursing and reviling of any soul, and guard your eyes against that which  is not seemly. Set forth that which ye possess. If it be favourably  received, your end is attained; if not, to protest is vain. Leave that  soul to himself and turn unto the Lord, the Protector, the  Self-Subsisting. Be not the cause of grief, much less of discord and  strife. The hope is cherished that ye may obtain true education in the  shelter of the tree of His tender mercies and act in accordance with that  which God desireth. Ye are all the leaves of one tree and the drops of one  ocean.    The fourteenth Glad-Tidings    It is not necessary to undertake special journeys to visit the  resting-places of the dead. If people of substance and affluence offer the  cost of such journeys to the House of Justice, it will be pleasing and  acceptable in the presence of God. Happy are they that observe His  precepts.    The fifteenth Glad-Tidings    Although a republican form of government profiteth all the peoples of the  world, yet the majesty of kingship is one of the signs of God. We do not  wish that the countries of the world should remain deprived thereof. If  the sagacious combine the two forms into one, great will be their reward  in the presence of God.    In former religions such ordinances as holy war, destruction of books, the  ban on association and companionship with other peoples or on reading  certain books had been laid down and affirmed according to the exigencies  of the time; however, in this mighty Revelation, in this momentous  Announcement, the manifold bestowals and favours of God have overshadowed  all men, and from the horizon of the Will of the Ever-Abiding Lord, His  infallible decree hath prescribed that which We have set forth above.    We yield praise unto God--hallowed and glorified be He--for whatsoever He  hath graciously revealed in this blessed, this glorious and incomparable  Day. Indeed if everyone on earth were endowed with a myriad tongues and  were to continually praise God and magnify His Name to the end that  knoweth no end, their thanksgiving would not prove adequate for even one  of the gracious favours We have mentioned in this Tablet. Unto this  beareth witness every man of wisdom and discernment, of understanding and  knowledge.    We earnestly beseech God--exalted be His glory--to aid the rulers and  sovereigns, who are the exponents of power and the daysprings of glory, to  enforce His laws and ordinances. He is in truth the Omnipotent, the  All-Powerful, He Who is wont to answer the call of men.                                       TARAZAT (ORNAMENTS)      In My Name, which standeth supreme above all names    PRAISE and glory beseem the Lord of Names and the Creator of the heavens,  He, the waves of Whose ocean of Revelation surge before the eyes of the  peoples of the world. The Day-Star of His Cause shineth through every veil  and His Word of affirmation standeth beyond the reach of negation. Neither  the ascendancy of the oppressor nor the tyranny of the wicked hath been  able to thwart His Purpose. How glorified is His sovereignty, how exalted  His dominion!    Great God! Although His signs have encompassed the world and His proofs  and testimonies are shining forth and manifest as the light, yet the  ignorant appear heedless, nay rather, rebellious. Would that they had been  content with opposition. But at all times they are plotting to cut down  the sacred Lote-Tree. Since the dawn of this Revelation the embodiments of  selfishness have, by resorting to cruelty and oppression, striven to  extinguish the Light of divine manifestation. But God, having stayed their  hands, revealed this Light through His sovereign authority and protected  it through the power of His might until earth and heaven were illumined by  its radiance and brightness. Praise be unto Him under all conditions.    Glory be unto Thee, O Lord of the world and Desire of the nations, O Thou  Who hast become manifest in the Greatest Name whereby the pearls of wisdom  and utterance have appeared from the shells of the great sea of Thy  knowledge, and the heavens of divine revelation have been adorned with the  light of the appearance of the Sun of Thy countenance.    I beg of Thee, by that Word through which Thy proof was perfected among  Thy creatures and Thy testimony was fulfilled among Thy servants to  strengthen Thy people in that whereby the face of the Cause will radiate  in Thy dominion, the standards of Thy power will be planted among Thy  servants, and the banners of Thy guidance will be raised throughout Thy  dominions.    O my Lord! Thou beholdest them clinging to the rope of Thy grace and  holding fast unto the hem of the mantle of Thy beneficence. Ordain for  them that which may draw them nearer unto Thee, and withhold them from all  else save Thee. I beg of Thee, O Thou King of existence and Protector of  the seen and the unseen, to make whosoever ariseth to serve Thy Cause as a  sea moving by Thy desire, as one ablaze with the fire of Thy Sacred Tree,  shining from the horizon of the heaven of Thy Will. Verily Thou art the  mighty One Whom neither the power of all the world nor the strength of  nations can weaken. There is no God but Thee, the One, the Incomparable,  the Protector, the Self-Subsistent.    O thou who hast quaffed the wine of Mine utterance from the chalice of My  knowledge! These sublime words were heard today from the rustling of the  divine Lote-Tree which the Lord of Names hath, with the hand of celestial  power, planted in the All-Highest Paradise:    The first Taraz and the first effulgence which hath dawned from the  horizon of the Mother Book is that man should know his own self and  recognize that which leadeth unto loftiness or lowliness, glory or  abasement, wealth or poverty. Having attained the stage of fulfilment and  reached his maturity, man standeth in need of wealth, and such wealth as  he acquireth through crafts or professions is commendable and praiseworthy  in the estimation of men of wisdom, and especially in the eyes of servants  who dedicate themselves to the education of the world and to the  edification of its peoples. They are, in truth, cup-bearers of the  life-giving water of knowledge and guides unto the ideal way. They direct  the peoples of the world to the straight path and acquaint them with that  which is conducive to human upliftment and exaltation. The straight path  is the one which guideth man to the dayspring of perception and to the  dawning-place of true understanding and leadeth him to that which will  redound to glory, honour and greatness.    We cherish the hope that through the loving-kindness of the All-Wise, the  All-Knowing, obscuring dust may be dispelled and the power of perception  enhanced, that the people may discover the purpose for which they have  been called into being. In this Day whatsoever serveth to reduce blindness  and to increase vision is worthy of consideration. This vision acteth as  the agent and guide for true knowledge. Indeed in the estimation of men of  wisdom keenness of understanding is due to keenness of vision.

And then Cyril cried--    \"Why, it's _you_! I know the hole in your pinafore! You _are_ Jane,  aren't you? And you're the Panther; I can see your dirty handkerchief  that you forgot to change after you'd cut your thumb! The wish _has_  come off, after all. I say, am I as handsome as you are?\"    \"If you're Cyril, I liked you much better as you were before,\" said  Anthea decidedly. \"You look like the picture of the young chorister,  with your golden hair; you'll die young, I shouldn't wonder. And if  that's Robert, he's like an Italian organ-grinder. His hair's all  black.\"    \"You two girls are like Christmas cards, then--that's all--silly  Christmas cards,\" said Robert angrily. \"And Jane's hair is simply  carrots.\"    It was indeed of that Venetian tint so much admired by artists.    \"Well, it's no use finding fault with each other,\" said Anthea; \"let's  get the Lamb and lug it home to dinner. The servants will admire us most  awfully, you'll see.\"    Baby was just waking up when they got to him, and not one of the  children but was relieved to find that he at least was not as beautiful  as the day, but just the same as usual.    \"I suppose he's too young to have wishes naturally,\" said Jane. \"We  shall have to mention him specially next time.\"    Anthea ran forward and held out her arms.    \"Come, then,\" she said.    The Baby looked at her disapprovingly, and put a sandy pink thumb in his  mouth. Anthea was his favourite sister.    \"Come, then,\" she said.    \"G'way 'long!\" said the Baby.    \"Come to own Pussy,\" said Jane.    \"Wants my Panty,\" said the Lamb dismally, and his lip trembled.    \"Here, come on, Veteran,\" said Robert, \"come and have a yidey on Yobby's  back.\"    \"Yah, narky narky boy,\" howled the Baby, giving way altogether. Then the  children knew the worst. _The Baby did not know them!_    [Illustration: The baby did not know them!]    They looked at each other in despair, and it was terrible to each, in  this dire emergency, to meet only the beautiful eyes of perfect  strangers, instead of the merry, friendly, commonplace, twinkling, jolly  little eyes of its own brothers and sisters.    \"This is most truly awful,\" said Cyril when he had tried to lift up the  Lamb, and the Lamb had scratched like a cat and bellowed like a bull!  \"We've got to _make friends_ with him! I can't carry him home screaming  like that. Fancy having to make friends with our own baby!--it's too  silly.\"    That, however, was exactly what they had to do. It took over an hour,  and the task was not rendered any easier by the fact that the Lamb was  by this time as hungry as a lion and as thirsty as a desert.    At last he consented to allow these strangers to carry him home by  turns, but as he refused to hold on to such new acquaintances he was a  dead weight, and most exhausting.    \"Thank goodness, we're home!\" said Jane, staggering through the iron  gate to where Martha, the nursemaid, stood at the front door shading her  eyes with her hand and looking out anxiously. \"Here! Do take Baby!\"    Martha snatched the Baby from her arms.    \"Thanks be, _he's_ safe back,\" she said. \"Where are the others, and  whoever to goodness gracious are all of you?\"    \"We're _us_, of course,\" said Robert.    \"And who's Us, when you're at home?\" asked Martha scornfully.    \"I tell you it's _us_, only we're beautiful as the day,\" said Cyril.  \"I'm Cyril, and these are the others, and we're jolly hungry. Let us in,  and don't be a silly idiot.\"    Martha merely dratted Cyril's impudence and tried to shut the door in  his face.    \"I know we _look_ different, but I'm Anthea, and we're so tired, and  it's long past dinner-time.\"    \"Then go home to your dinners, whoever you are; and if our children put  you up to this play-acting you can tell them from me they'll catch it,  so they know what to expect!\" With that she did bang the door. Cyril  rang the bell violently. No answer. Presently cook put her head out of a  bedroom window and said--    \"If you don't take yourselves off, and that precious sharp, I'll go and  fetch the police.\" And she slammed down the window.    \"It's no good,\" said Anthea. \"Oh, do, do come away before we get sent to  prison!\"    The boys said it was nonsense, and the law of England couldn't put you  in prison for just being as beautiful as the day, but all the same they  followed the others out into the lane.    \"We shall be our proper selves after sunset, I suppose,\" said Jane.    \"I don't know,\" Cyril said sadly; \"it mayn't be like that now--things  have changed a good deal since Megatherium times.\"    \"Oh,\" cried Anthea suddenly, \"perhaps we shall turn into stone at  sunset, like the Megatheriums did, so that there mayn't be any of us  left over for the next day.\"    She began to cry, so did Jane. Even the boys turned pale. No one had the  heart to say anything.    It was a horrible afternoon. There was no house near where the children  could beg a crust of bread or even a glass of water. They were afraid to  go to the village, because they had seen Martha go down there with a  basket, and there was a local constable. True, they were all as  beautiful as the day, but that is a poor comfort when you are as hungry  as a hunter and as thirsty as a sponge.    Three times they tried in vain to get the servants in the White House to  let them in and listen to their tale. And then Robert went alone, hoping  to be able to climb in at one of the back windows and so open the door  to the others. But all the windows were out of reach, and Martha emptied  a toilet-jug of cold water over him from a top window, and said--    \"Go along with you, you nasty little Eye-talian monkey.\"    It came at last to their sitting down in a row under the hedge, with  their feet in a dry ditch, waiting for sunset, and wondering whether,  when the sun _did_ set, they would turn into stone, or only into their  own old natural selves; and each of them still felt lonely and among  strangers, and tried not to look at the others, for, though their voices  were their own, their faces were so radiantly beautiful as to be quite  irritating to look at.    \"I don't believe we _shall_ turn to stone,\" said Robert, breaking a long  miserable silence, \"because the Sand-fairy said he'd give us another  wish to-morrow, and he couldn't if we were stone, could he?\"    The others said \"No,\" but they weren't at all comforted.    Another silence, longer and more miserable, was broken by Cyril's  suddenly saying, \"I don't want to frighten you girls, but I believe it's  beginning with me already. My foot's quite dead. I'm turning to stone, I  know I am, and so will you in a minute.\"    \"Never mind,\" said Robert kindly, \"perhaps you'll be the only stone one,  and the rest of us will be all right, and we'll cherish your statue and  hang garlands on it.\"    But when it turned out that Cyril's foot had only gone to sleep through  his sitting too long with it under him, and when it came to life in an  agony of pins and needles, the others were quite cross.    \"Giving us such a fright for nothing!\" said Anthea.    [Illustration: Martha emptied a toilet-jug of cold water over him]    The third and miserablest silence of all was broken by Jane. She  said--    \"If we _do_ come out of this all right, we'll ask the Sammyadd to make  it so that the servants don't notice anything different, no matter what  wishes we have.\"    The others only grunted. They were too wretched even to make good  resolutions.    At last hunger and fright and crossness and tiredness--four very nasty  things--all joined together to bring one nice thing, and that was sleep.  The children lay asleep in a row, with their beautiful eyes shut and  their beautiful mouths open. Anthea woke first. The sun had set, and the  twilight was coming on.    Anthea pinched herself very hard, to make sure, and when she found she  could still feel pinching she decided that she was not stone, and then  she pinched the others. They, also, were soft.    \"Wake up,\" she said, almost in tears for joy; \"it's all right, we're not  stone. And oh, Cyril, how nice and ugly you do look, with your old  freckles and your brown hair and your little eyes. And so do you all!\"  she added, so that they might not feel jealous.    When they got home they were very much scolded by Martha, who told them  about the strange children.    \"A good-looking lot, I must say, but that impudent.\"    \"I know,\" said Robert, who knew by experience how hopeless it would be  to try to explain things to Martha.    \"And where on earth have you been all this time, you naughty little  things, you?\"    \"In the lane.\"    \"Why didn't you come home hours ago?\"    \"We couldn't because of _them_,\" said Anthea.    \"Who?\"    \"The children who were as beautiful as the day. They kept us there till  after sunset. We couldn't come back till they'd gone. You don't know how  we hated them! Oh, do, do give us some supper--we are so hungry.\"    \"Hungry! I should think so,\" said Martha angrily; \"out all day like  this. Well, I hope it'll be a lesson to you not to go picking up with  strange children--down here after measles, as likely as not! Now mind,  if you see them again, don't you speak to them--not one word nor so  much as a look--but come straight away and tell me. I'll spoil their  beauty for them!\"    \"If ever we _do_ see them again we'll tell you,\" Anthea said; and  Robert, fixing his eyes fondly on the cold beef that was being brought  in on a tray by cook, added in heartfelt undertones--    \"And we'll take jolly good care we never _do_ see them again.\"    And they never have.          CHAPTER II    GOLDEN GUINEAS      Anthea woke in the morning from a very real sort of dream, in which she  was walking in the Zoological Gardens on a pouring wet day without an  umbrella. The animals seemed desperately unhappy because of the rain,  and were all growling gloomily. When she awoke, both the growling and "]]]
