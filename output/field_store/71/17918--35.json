Moreover,  he was now renewing his friendship with Thomas White, a heretic Catholic  priest, of several _aliases_, some of whose work had been placed on the  Index. White was a philosophic thinker of considerable power and subtlety,  and he and Digby acted and reacted on each other strongly--though Digby's  debt is perhaps the greater. Their respective parts in the _Two Treatises_  and in the _Institutionum Peripateticorum libri quinque_, published under  White's name, but for which Sir Kenelm is given the main credit, can hardly  now be sifted. White, at all events, was not a prudent friend for an envoy  to the Holy See. Digby \"grew high and hectored with his holinesse, and gave  him the lye. The pope said he was mad.\" Thus Aubrey. Henrietta Maria sent  him once more on the same errand; but the Roman Curia continued to look on  him as a \"useless and restless man, with scanty wisdom.\" Before returning,  however, he paid a round of visits to Italian courts, making everywhere a  profound impression by his handsome person and his liveliness. He had to  hasten back to England on his own business. His fortunes were desperate;  and he desired to compound for his estates.    A week or so after the King's death he is proved by his correspondence to  be in France, having fled after one more pronouncement of him as a  dangerous man. He went into exile this time with a sad heart; and it was  not only the loyalist in him that cried out. The life of an English country  gentleman would never have satisfied him; yet he longed for it now it had  become impossible. He writes from Calais to a friend: \"Those innocent  recreations you mention of tabors and pipes, and dancing ladies, and  convenient country houses, shady walks and close arbours, make one sigh to  be again a spectator of them, and to be again in little England, where time  slides more gently away than in any part of the world. _Quando sia mai ch'a  rividerti io torno_?\"    He went this time knowing better than his fellow royalists the meaning of  events. He was still a rank, but at least an intelligent, conspirator.  English correspondents at Rouen and Caen report him in the company of one  Watson, an Independent; and that he is proposing \"to join the interests of  all the English papists with the bloody party that murdered the king.\" Dr.  Winsted, an English doctor in Rouen, asked him with indignation how he  could meditate going back to England, \"considering the abomination of that  country.\" Digby replied that he was forced to it. \"If he went not now he  must starve.\" He plainly saw who was the real and only force in England;  and he was going to make a bargain with the strong man for himself and his  co-religionists. As a matter of fact there is no trace of his return at  this moment. Not merely was his property in danger, but his head as well.  Yet he never repented of his policy, and he carried it out, so far as might  be, in his dealings with Cromwell a few years later. And Henrietta Maria  bore him no grudge on this score.    Exile in Paris meant friendly intercourse with, and consolation of the  Queen, but also scientific research. In 1651 Evelyn was visiting him there,  and being stirred by his enthusiasm into attending Febur's chemistry  lectures along with him. Before that must have taken place his pilgrimage  to Descartes, who died in 1650. Apparently Sir Kenelm had gone to Egmont as  an unknown stranger; and it throws light on his wide reputation as a man of  ideas and a conversationalist, that into his torrent of questions and  speculation Descartes broke with, \"You can be none other than Digby.\" The  English scientist's practical mind--for he had always a practical end in  view, however fantastic his methods--showed itself in his counsel to the  author of the _Discours sur la Methode_. Why all this labour for mere  abstract speculation? Why not apply his genius to the one great subject,  the prolongation of human life? Descartes, it appears, did not need the  advice. He said the subject was engaging his mind; and though he \"dared not  look forward to man being rendered immortal, he was quite certain his  length of life could be made equal to the patriarch's.\" In fact, he was  composing at the time an _Abrege de Medecine_, and popular report said he  believed men could live four or five hundred years. He died prematurely of  too much faith in his own medical theories.    In 1653 permission was given to Digby to return, on condition he would not  meddle with Royalist plots. He had been in communication with Cromwell, and  had done some diplomatic business for him in Paris. On his return in 1654,  and for the next few years, he was in the closest relations with the  Protector, thereby carrying out the principle he had probably adopted from  White, of a \"universal passive obedience to any species of government that  had obtained an establishment.\" His Royalist friends made an outcry, and so  did the Puritans; but Digby was confident of obtaining from Cromwell great  advantages for the English Catholics, and the Protector, it seems, fully  trusted the intentions and the abilities of this strange and fascinating  personality who came to him out of the enemy's camp. Delicate business was  given into his hands, that of preventing an alliance between France and  Spain. Prynne, in his _True and Perfect Narrative_, bitterly denounced  Cromwell in \"that Sir Kenelme Digby was his particular favourite, and  lodged at Whitehall; that Maurice Conry, Provincial of the Franciscans in  England, and other priests, had his protections under hand and seal.\" Of  Digby's feelings towards Cromwell there is clear evidence. It seems his  loyalty had been questioned in his absence; and he writes from Paris, in  March, 1656, to Secretary Thurloe: \"Whatsoever may be disliked by my Lord  Protector and the Council of State must be detested by me. My obligations  to his Highness are so great, etc.\" And again, \"How passionate I am for his  service and for his honour and interest, even to exposing my life for  him.\" The intimacy, begun on both sides in mere policy, had evidently grown  to friendship and mutual admiration.    The illness of which he died had already attacked him, and it was for his  health he went to Montpelier in 1658. His stay in that seat of learning was  made memorable by his reading to a company of eminent persons his  _Discourse on the Powder of Sympathy_, which has brought him more fame and  more ridicule than anything else. I have already referred to the secret  confided to him as a youth in Florence by the Carmelite Friar from the  East. When he came back to England he spoke of the great discovery, and had  occasion to use it. Howell--of the _Familiar Letters_--was, according to  Sir Kenelm's account, wounded while trying to part two friends who were  fighting a duel. His wounds were hastily tied up with his garter, and Digby  was sent for. Digby asked for the garter-bandage, and steeped it in a basin  in which he had dissolved his secret powder (of vitriol). Immediately  Howell felt a \"pleasing kind of freshnesse, as it were a wet cold napkin  did spread over my hand.\" \"Take off all the plasters and wrappings,\" said  Digby. \"Keep the wound clean, and neither too hot nor too cold.\" Afterwards  he took the bandage from the water, and hung it before a great fire to dry;  whereupon Howell's servant came running to say his master was much worse,  and in a burning fever. The bandage plunged once more in the dissolved  powder, soothed the patient at a distance; and in a few days the wound was  healed. Digby declared that James and Buckingham were interested witnesses  of the cure; and the king \"drolled with him about it (which he could do  with a very good grace).\" He said he divulged the secret to the Duke of  Mayenne. After the Duke's death his surgeon sold it so that \"now there is  scarce any country barber but knows it.\" Why did not Digby try it on his  wounded men at Scanderoon? His _Discourse_ to the learned assembly is a  curious medley of subtle observation and old wives' tales, set out in  sober, orderly, one might almost say scientific, fashion. Roughly, the  substance of it may be summed up as \"Like to like.\" The secret powder is a  medium whereby the atoms in the bandage are drawn back to their proper  place in the body! After Digby's death you could buy the powder at  Hartman's shop for sixpence.    At the Restoration he returned to England. He was still Henrietta Maria's  Chancellor. His relations with Cromwell had never broken their friendship;  and probably he still made possets for her at Somerset House as he had done  in the old days. But by Charles II there was no special favour shown him,  beyond repayment for his ransom of English slaves during the Scanderoon  voyage; and in 1664 he was forbidden the Court. The reason is not  definitely known. Charles may have only gradually, but at last grimly,  resented, the more he learnt of it, Digby's recognition of the usurper.    He found happiness in science, in books, in conversation, in medicine,  stilling and cookery. In 1661 he had lectured at Gresham College on _The  Vegetation of Plants_. When the Royal Society was inaugurated, in 1663, he  was one of the Council. His house became a kind of academy, where wits,  experimentalists, occultists, philosophers, and men of letters worked and  talked. This was the house in Covent Garden. An earlier one is also noted  by Aubrey. \"The faire howses in Holbourne between King's Street and  Southampton Street (which brake-off the continuance of them) were, about  1633, built by Sir Kenelme; where he lived before the civill warres. Since  the restauration of Charles II he lived in the last faire house westward in  the north portico of Covent Garden, where my lord Denzill Hollis lived  since. He had a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16444"],[0,"Indian Unrest (#4)"],[1,"support of this year's  Press Bill, and with scarcely less justification, whilst just 13 years  ago two British officials fell victims at Poona to a murderous  conspiracy, prompted by a campaign of criminal virulence in the Press,  closely resembling those which have more recently robbed India of many  valuable lives.    To imagine that Indian unrest has been a sudden growth because its  outward manifestations have assumed new and startling forms of violence  is a dangerous delusion; and no less misleading is the assumption that  it is merely the outcome of Western education or the echo of Western  democratic aspirations, because it occasionally, and chiefly for  purposes of political expediency, adopts the language of Western  demagogues. Whatever its modes of expression, its main spring is a  deep-rooted antagonism to all the principles upon which Western society,  especially in a democratic country like England, has been built up. It  is in that antagonism--in the increasing violence of that  antagonism--which is a conspicuous feature of the unrest, that the  gravest danger lies.    But if in this respect the problems with which we are confronted appear  to me more serious and complex than official optimism is sometimes  disposed to admit, I have no hesitation is saying that there is no cause  for despondency if we will only realize how strong our position in India  still is, and use our strength wisely and sympathetically, but, at the  same time, with firmness and consistency. It is important to note at the  outset that the more dangerous forms of unrest are practically confined  to the Hindus, and amongst them to a numerically small proportion of the  vast Hindu community. Not a single Mahomedan has been implicated in,  though some have fallen victims to, the criminal conspiracies of the  last few years. Not a single Mahomedan of any account is to be found in  the ranks of disaffected politicians. For reasons, in fact, which I  shall set forth later on, it may be confidently asserted that never  before have the Mahomedans of India as a whole identified their  interests and their aspirations so closely as at the present day with  the consolidation and permanence of British rule. It is almost a  misnomer to speak of Indian unrest. Hindu unrest would be a far more  accurate term, connoting with far greater precision the forces  underlying it, though to use it without reservation would be to do a  grave injustice to the vast numbers of Hindus who are as yet untainted  with disaffection. These include almost all the Hindu ruling chiefs and  landed aristocracy, as well as the great mass of the agricultural  classes which form in all parts of India the overwhelming majority of  the population. Very large areas, moreover, are still entirely free from  unrest, which, except for a few sporadic outbreaks in other districts,  has been hitherto mainly confined to three distinct areas--the Mahratta  Deccan, which comprises a great part of the Bombay Presidency and  several districts of the Central Provinces, Bengal, with the new  province of Eastern Bengal, and the Punjab. In those regions it is the  large cities that have been the real hot-beds of unrest, and, great as  is their influence, it must not be forgotten that in India scarcely  one-tenth of the population lives in cities, or even in small townships  with more than 5,000 inhabitants. Whereas in England one-third of the  population is gathered together in crowded cities of 100,000 inhabitants  and over, there are but twenty-eight cities of that size in the whole of  India, with an aggregate population of less than 7,000,000 out of a  total of almost 300,000,000.    That a movement confined to a mere fraction of the population of India  has no title to be called a \"national\" movement would scarcely need to  be argued, even if the variegated jumble of races and peoples, castes  and creeds that make up the population of India were not in itself an  antithesis to all that the word \"national\" implies. Nevertheless it  would be equally foolish to underrate the forces which underlie this  movement, for they have one common _nexus_, and a very vital one. They  are the dominant forces of Hinduism--forces which go to the very root of  a social and religious system than which none in the history of the  human race has shown greater vitality and stability. Based upon caste,  the most rigid of all social classifications, Hinduism has secured for  some 3,000 years or more to the higher castes, and especially to the  Brahmans, the highest of all castes, a social supremacy for which there  is no parallel elsewhere. At the same time, inflexibly as they have  dominated Hinduism, these higher castes have themselves preserved a  flexibility of mind and temper which has enabled them to adapt  themselves with singular success to the vicissitudes of changing times  without any substantial sacrifice of their inherited traditions and  aspirations. Thus it is amongst high-caste Hindus that for the last  three-quarters of a century English education has chiefly spread, and,  indeed, been most eagerly welcomed; it is amongst them that British  administration has recruited the great majority of its native servants  in every branch of the public service; it is amongst them also that are  chiefly recruited the liberal professions, the Press, the  schoolmasters--in fact all those agencies through which public opinion  and the mind of the rising generation are most easily moulded and  directed. That it is amongst them also that the spirit of revolt against  British ascendency is chiefly and almost exclusively rife constitutes  the most ominous feature of Indian unrest.          CHAPTER II.    SWARAJ ON THE PLATFORM AND IN THE PRESS.      Before proceeding to describe the methods by which Indian unrest has  been fomented, and to study as far as possible its psychology, it may be  well to set forth succinctly the political purpose to which it is  directed, as far as there is any unity of direction. One of the chief  difficulties one encounters in attempting to define its aims is the  vagueness that generally characterizes the pronouncements of Indian  politicians. There is, indeed, one section that makes no disguise either  of its aspirations or of the way in which it proposes to secure their  fulfilment. Its doctrines are frankly revolutionary, and it openly  preaches propaganda by deed--i.e., by armed revolt, if and when it  becomes practicable, and, in the meantime, by assassination, dynamite  outrages, dacoities, and all the other methods of terrorism dear to  anarchists all over the world. But that section is not very numerous,  nor would it in itself be very dangerous, if it did not exercise so  fatal a fascination upon the immature mind of youth. The real difficulty  begins when one comes to that much larger section of \"advanced\"  politicians who are scarcely less bitterly opposed to the maintenance of  British rule, but, either from prudential motives or lest they should  prematurely alarm and alienate the representatives of what is called  \"moderate\" opinion, shrink from the violent assertion of India's claim  to complete political independence and, whilst helping to create the  atmosphere that breeds outrages, profess to deprecate them.    The difficulty is further enhanced by the reluctance of many of the  \"moderates\" to break with their \"advanced\" friends by proclaiming, once  and for all, their own conviction that within no measurable time can  India in her own interests afford to forgo the guarantees of internal  peace and order and external security which the British _Raj_ alone can  afford. Hence the desire on both sides to find some common denominator  in a nebulous formula which each can interpret as to time and manner  according to its own desires and aims. That formula seems to have been  discovered in the term _Swaraj_, or self-rule, which, when  euphemistically translated into Colonial self-government for India,  offers the additional advantage of presenting the political aspirations  of Indian \"Nationalism\" in the form least likely to alarm Englishmen,  especially those who do not care or wish to look below the surface and  whose sympathies are readily won by any catchword that appeals to  sentimental Liberalism. Now if _Swaraj_, or Colonial self-government,  represents the _minimum_ that will satisfy Indian Nationalists, it is  important to know exactly what in their view it really means.  Fortunately on this point we have some _data_ of indisputable authority.  They are furnished in the speeches of an \"advanced\" leader, who does not  rank amongst the revolutionary extremists, though his refusal to give  evidence in the trial of a seditious newspaper with which he had been  connected brought him in 1907 within the scope of the Indian Criminal  Code. Mr. Bepin Chandra Pal, a high-caste Hindu and a man of great  intellectual force and high character, has not only received a Western  education, but has travelled a great deal in Europe and in America, and  is almost as much at home in London as in Calcutta. A little more than  three years ago he delivered in Madras a series of lectures on the \"New  Spirit,\" which have been republished in many editions and may be  regarded as the most authoritative programme of \"advanced\" political  thought in India. What adds greatly to the significance of those  speeches is that Mr. Pal borrowed their keynote from the Presidential  address delivered in the preceding year by the veteran leader of the  \"moderates,\" Mr. Dadabhai Naoroji, at the annual Session of the Indian  National Congress. The rights of India, Mr. Naoroji had said, \"can be  comprised in one word--self-government or _Swaraj_, like that of the  United Kingdom or the Colonies.\" It was reserved for Mr. Pal to define  precisely how such _Swaraj_ could be peacefully obtained and what it  must ultimately lead to. He began by brushing away the notion that any  political"]]]
