As to  the prohibition against being in the streets of Venice after half past  nine, he felt that no hardship whatever, as he found no amusement in  strolling in the crowded Piazza.        Chapter 2: A Conspiracy.      \"Who are those ladies, Matteo?\" Francis asked his friend one evening,  as the latter, who was sitting with him in his gondola, while Giuseppi  rowed them along the Grand Canal, half rose and saluted two girls in a  passing gondola.    \"They are distant cousins of mine, Maria and Giulia Polani. They only  returned a short time since from Corfu. Their father is one of the  richest merchants of our city. He has for the last three years been  living in Corfu, which is the headquarters of his trade. The family is  an old one, and has given doges to Venice. They are two of our richest  heiresses, for they have no brothers. Their mother died soon after the  birth of Giulia.\"    \"They both look very young,\" Francis said.    \"Maria is about sixteen, her sister two years younger. There will be no  lack of suitors for their hands, for although the family is not  politically powerful, as it used to be, their wealth would cause them  to be gladly received in our very first families.\"    \"Who was the middle-aged lady sitting between them?\"    \"She is only their duenna,\" Matteo said carelessly. \"She has been with  them since they were children, and their father places great confidence  in her. And he had need to, for Maria will ere long be receiving  bouquets and perfumed notes from many a young gallant.\"    \"I can quite fancy that,\" Francis said, \"for she is very pretty as well  as very rich, and, as far as I have observed, the two things do not go  very often together. However, no doubt by this time her father has  pretty well arranged in his mind whom she is to marry.\"    \"I expect so,\" agreed Matteo.    \"That is the worst of being born of good family. You have got to marry  some one of your father's choice, not your own, and that choice is  determined simply by the desire to add to the political influence of  the family, to strengthen distant ties, or to obtain powerful  connections. I suppose it is the same everywhere, Matteo, but I do  think that a man or woman ought to have some voice in a matter of such  importance to them.\"    \"I think so, too, at the present time,\" Matteo laughed; \"but I don't  suppose that I shall be of that opinion when I have a family of sons  and daughters to marry.    \"This gondola of yours must be a fast one indeed, Francisco, for with  only one rower she keeps up with almost all the pair oared boats, and  your boy is not exerting himself to the utmost, either.\"    \"She can fly along, I can tell you, Matteo. You shall come out in her  some evening when Giuseppi and I both take oars. I have had her ten  days now, and we have not come across anything that can hold her for a  moment.\"    \"It is always useful,\" Matteo said, \"to have a fast boat. It is  invaluable in case you have been getting into a scrape, and have one of  the boats of the city watch in chase of you.\"    \"I hope I sha'n't want it for any purpose of that sort,\" Francis  answered, laughing. \"I do not think I am likely to give cause to the  city watch to chase me.\"    \"I don't think you are, Francisco, but there is never any saying.\"    \"At any rate it is always useful to be able to go fast if necessary,  and if we did want to get away, I do not think there are many  pair-oared gondolas afloat that would overtake us, though a good four  oar might do so. Giuseppi and I are so accustomed to each other's  stroke now, that though in a heavy boat we might not be a match for two  men, in a light craft like this, where weight does not count for so  much, we would not mind entering her for a race against the two best  gondoliers on the canals, in an ordinary boat.\"    A few evenings later, Francis was returning homewards at about half  past ten, when, in passing along a quiet canal, the boat was hailed  from the shore.    \"Shall we take him, Messer Francisco?\" Giuseppi asked in a low voice;  for more than once they had late in the evening taken a fare.    Francis rowed, like Giuseppi, in his shirt, and in the darkness they  were often taken for a pair-oared gondola on the lookout for a fare.  Francis had sometimes accepted the offer, because it was an amusement  to see where the passenger wished to go--to guess whether he was a  lover hastening to keep an appointment, a gambler on a visit to some  quiet locality, where high play went on unknown to the authorities, or  simply one who had by some error missed his own gondola, and was  anxious to return home. It made no difference to him which way he  rowed. It was always possible that some adventure was to be met with,  and the fare paid was a not unwelcome addition to Giuseppi's funds.    \"Yes, we may as well take him,\" he replied to Giuseppi's question.    \"You are in no hurry to get to bed, I suppose?\" the man who had hailed  them said as the boat drew up against the wall of the canal.    \"It does not make much difference to us, if we are well paid, to keep  awake,\" Giuseppi said.    Upon such occasions he was always the spokesman.    \"You know San Nicolo?\"    \"Yes, I know it,\" Giuseppi said; \"but it is a long row--six miles, if  it's a foot.\"    \"You will have to wait there for an hour or two, but I will give you  half a ducat for your night's work.\"    \"What do you say, partner?\" Giuseppi asked Francis.    \"We may as well go,\" the lad replied after a moment's pause.    The row was certainly a long one, but the night was delightful, and the  half ducat was a prize for Giuseppi; but what influenced Francis  principally in accepting was curiosity. San Nicolo was a little sandy  islet lying quite on the outside of the group of islands. It was  inhabited only by a few fishermen; and Francis wondered that a man,  evidently by his voice and manner of address belonging to the upper  class, should want to go to such a place as this at this hour of the  night. Certainly no ordinary motives could actuate him.    As the stranger took his place in the boat, Francis saw by the light of  the stars that he was masked; but there was nothing very unusual in  this, as masks were not unfrequently worn at night by young gallants,  when engaged on any frolic in which they wished their identity to be  unrecognized. Still it added to the interest of the trip; and dipping  his oar in the water he set out at a slow, steady stroke well within  his power. He adopted this partly in view of the length of the row  before them, partly because the idea struck him that it might be as  well that their passenger should not suspect that the boat was other  than an ordinary gondola. The passenger, however, was well satisfied  with the speed, for they passed two or three other gondolas before  issuing from the narrow canals, and starting across the broad stretch  of the lagoon.    Not a word was spoken until the gondola neared its destination. Then  the passenger said:    \"You row well. If you like the job I may employ you again.\"    \"We are always ready to earn money,\" Francis said, speaking in a gruff  voice quite unlike his own.    \"Very well. I will let you know, as we return, what night I shall want  you again. I suppose you can keep your mouths shut on occasion, and can  go without gossiping to your fellows as to any job on which you are  employed?\"    \"We can do that,\" Francis said. \"It's no matter to us where our  customers want to go, if they are willing to pay for it; and as to  gossiping, there is a saying, 'A silver gag is the best for keeping the  mouth closed.'\"    A few minutes later the bow of the gondola ran up on the sandy shore of  San Nicolo. The stranger made his way forward and leapt out, and with  the words, \"It may be two hours before I am back,\" walked rapidly away.    \"Why, Messer Francisco,\" Giuseppi said when their passenger was well  out of hearing, \"what on earth possessed you to accept a fare to such a  place as this? Of course, for myself, I am glad enough to earn half a  ducat, which will buy me a new jacket with silver buttons for the next  festa; but to make such a journey as this was too much, and it will be  very late before we are back. If the padrone knew it he would be very  angry.\"    \"I didn't do it to enable you to earn half a ducat, Giuseppi, although  I am glad enough you should do so; but I did it because it seemed to  promise the chance of an adventure. There must be something in this. A  noble--for I have no doubt he is one--would never be coming out to San  Nicolo, at this time of night, without some very strong motive. There  can be no rich heiress whom he might want to carry off living here, so  that can't be what he has come for. I think there must be some secret  meeting, for as we came across the lagoon I saw one or two beats in the  distance heading in this direction. Anyhow, I mean to try and find out  what it all means.\"    \"You had better not, sir,\" Giuseppi said earnestly. \"If there is any  plot on foot we had best not get mixed up in it. No one is too high or  too low to escape the vengeance of the council, if found plotting  against the state; and before now gondolas, staved in and empty, have  been found drifting on the lagoons, and the men who rowed them have  never been heard of again.

This remarkable power of his jaws had that sinister  disproportion only paralleled by the power of the jaws of a hyena;  indeed, his teeth very much resembled a hyena's teeth.    With the deer rushing all around him, Gulo fed, ravenously and  horribly, but not for long.  A new light smoldered in his eyes now as  he lifted his carmine snout, and one saw that, for the moment, the  beast was mad, crazed with the lust of killing, seeing red, and blinded  by blood.    Then the massacre began.  It was not a hunt, because each deer,  thinking only of itself, feared to break from the trodden mazy path of  the \"yard,\" and risk the slow, helpless, plunging progress necessary in  the deep snow.  Wherefore panic took them all over again, and they  dashed, often colliding, generally hindering each other, hither and  thither, up and down the paths of the \"yard\" with the hopeless,  helpless, senseless, blind abandon of sheep.  The result was a shambles.    This part we skip.  Probably--nay, certainly--Nature knows best, and is  quite well aware what she is up to, and it is perhaps not meant that we  should put her in the limelight in her grisly moods.  Suffice it to say  that Gulo seemed to stop at length, simply because even he could not  \"see red\" forever, and with exhaustion returned sense, and with  sense--in his case--in-born caution.  He removed, leaving a certain  number of reindeer bleeding upon the ground.  Some of them were dead.    In an hour dawn would be conspiring to show him up before the world,  and he was not a beast sweet to look upon at that moment--indeed, at  any moment, but less so now.    Now, it is surprising how far a wolverine can shift his clumsy-looking  body over snow in an hour, especially if he has reasons.  This one had  good reasons, and he was no fool.  He knew quite well the kind of  little hell he had made for himself behind there, and he did not stay  to let the snow cover him.  He traveled as if he were a machine and  knew no fatigue; and the end of that journey was a hole in a hollow  among rocks.    Dawn was throwing a wan light upon all things when he thrust his short,  sharp muzzle inside that hole, to be met by a positively hair-raising  volley of rasping, vicious growls.    He promptly ripped out a string of ferocious, dry, harsh growls in  return, and for half-a-minute the air became full of growls, horrible  and blood-curdling, each answering each.    Then he lurched in over the threshold, and coolly dodged a thick paw,  with tearing white claws, that whipped at him with a round-arm stroke  out of the pitch-darkness.  The stroke was repeated, scraping, but in  nowise hurting his matted coat, as he rose on his hindlegs and threw  himself upon the striker.    Followed a hectic thirty seconds of simply diabolical noises, while the  two rolled upon the ground, grappling fiendishly in the darkness.  Then  they parted, got up, growled one final roll of fury at each other, fang  to fang, and, curling up, went to sleep.  But it was nothing, only the  quite usual greeting between Gulo and his wife.  They were a sweet  couple.    There appeared to be no movement, or any least sign of awakening, on  the part of either of the couple between that moment and sometime in  the afternoon, when, so far as one could see, Gulo suddenly rolled  straight from deep sleep out on to the snow, and away without a sound,  at his indescribable shamble and at top speed.    Mrs. Gulo executed precisely the same amazing maneuver, and at exactly  the same moment, as far as could be seen, on the other side, and  shuffled off into the forest.  They gave no explanation for so doing.  They said never a word--nothing.  One moment they were curled up,  asleep; the next they had gone, scampered, apparently into the land of  the spirits, and were no more.  Nor did there seem to be any reason for  this extraordinary conduct except--except----  Well, it is true that a  willow-grouse, white as the snowy branch he sat upon, _did_ start  clucking somewhere in the dim tree regiments, a snipe did come  whistling sadly over the tree-tops, and a raven, jet against the white,  did flap up, barking sharply, above the pointed pine-tops; but that was  nothing--to us.  To the wolverines it was everything, a whole wireless  message in the universal code of the wild, and they had read it _in  their sleep_.  Through their slumbers it had spelt into their brains,  and instantly snapped into action that wonderful, faultless machinery  that moved them to speed as if automatically.    Then the chase began, grim, steady, relentless, dogged--the chase of  death, the battle of endurance.    A pause followed after the vanishing of the hated wolverines.  A crow  lifted on rounded vans, marking their departure, and it was seen.  A  blackcock launched from a high tree with a whir and a bluster like an  aeroplane, showing their course, and it was noted.  An eagle climbed  heavily and ponderously over the low curtain of the snow mist, pointing  their way, and it was followed.  All the wild, all the world, seemed to  be against the wolverines.  The brigands were afoot by day.  The scouts  were marking their trail.    Then a lynx, moving with great bounds on his huge swathed paws, shot  past between the iron-hard tree-boles; a fox followed, scudding like  the wind on the frozen crest; a hare, white as a waste wraith, flashed  by, swift as a racing white cloud-shadow; a goshawk screamed, and drew  a straight streaking line across a glade.  And then came the men, side  by side, deadly dumb, with set faces, the pale sun glinting coldly  cruel upon the snaky, lean barrels of their slung rifles, moving with  steady, fleet, giant strides on their immense spidery ski that were  eleven feet long, which whispered ghostily among the silent aisles of  Nature's cathedral of a thousand columns.  The Brothers were on the  death-trail of Gulo at last; the terrible, dreaded Brothers, who could  overtake a full-grown wolf in under thirty minutes on ski, and whose  single bullet spelt certain death.  Now for it; now for the fight.  Now  for the great test of the \"star\" wild outlaw against the \"star\" human  hunters--at last.  The reindeer were to be avenged.    Then Time took the bit of silence between his teeth and seconds became  hours, and minutes generations.    No sound made the wolverines as they rolled along in Indian file,  except for the soft whisper of the snow underfoot.    No noise encompassed the Brothers as they sped swiftly side by side  over the glittering white carpet, save for the slither of the snow  under their weight.    All the wild seemed to be standing still, holding its breath, looking  on, spell-bound; and save for the occasional crash of a collapsing  snow-laden branch, sounding magnified as in a cave, all the forest  about there was as still as death.    Half-an-hour passed, and Gulo flung his head around, glancing over his  shoulder a little uneasily, but with never a trace of fear in his  bloodshot eyes.  Then he grunted, and the two fell apart silently and  instantly, gradually getting farther and farther from each other on a  diverging course, till his wife faded out among the trees.  But never  for an instant did either of them check that tireless, deceptive,  clumsy, rolling slouch, that slid the trees behind, as telegraph-poles  slide behind the express carriage window.    Half-an-hour passed, and one of the Brothers, peering up and along the  trail a little anxiously, saw the forking of the line ahead.  Then he  grunted, and the two promptly separated without a word, gradually  increasing the distance between them on the widening fork till they  were lost to each other among the marshaled trunks.  But never for an  instant did they relax that swift, ghostly glide on the wonderful ski,  that slid the snow underfoot as a racing motor spins over the ruts.    An hour passed.  Sweat was breaking out in beads upon the faces of the  Brothers, now miles apart, but both going in the same general direction  over the endless wastes of snow, and upon their faces was beginning to  creep the look of that pain that strong men unbeaten feel who see a  beating in sight; but never for a moment did they slacken their swift,  mysterious glide.    An hour passed.  Foam began to fleck the evilly up-lifted lips  glistening back to the glistening fangs of the wolverines, now miles  apart, but still heading in the same general line, and upon their faces  began to set a look of fiends under torture; but never for a moment did  they check their indescribable shuffling slouch.    After that all was a nightmare, blurred and horrible, in which endless  processions of trees passed dimly, interspersed with aching blanks of  dazzling white that blinded the starting eyes, and man and beast  stumbled more than once as they sobbed along, forcing each leg forward  by sheer will alone.    At last, on the summit of a hog-backed, bristling ridge, Gulo stopped  and looked back, scowling and peering under his low brows.  Beneath  him, far away, the valley lay like a white tablecloth, all dotted with  green pawns, and the pawns were trees.  But he was not looking for  them.  His keen eyes were searching for movement, and he saw it after a  bit, a dot that crept, and crept, and crept, and--_stopped_!    Gulo sat up, shading his eyes against the watery sun with his forepaws,  watching as perhaps he had never watched in his life before.    For a long, long while, it seemed to him, that dot remained there  motionless, far, far away down in the valley, and then at length,  slowly, so slowly that at first the movement was not perceptible, it  turned about and began to creep away--creep, creep, creep away by the  trail it had come.    Gulo watched it till it was out of sight, fading round a bend of the  hills into a dark, dotted blur that was woods.  Then he dropped on all  fours, and breathed one great, big, long, deep breath.  That dot was  the one of the"]]]
