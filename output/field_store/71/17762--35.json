[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13635"],[0,"New York Times Current History: The European War, Vol 1, No. 1 (#4)"],[1,"at that. We soon  produced the first page of the Bernhardian literature: an anonymous  booklet entitled _The Battle of Dorking_. It was not the first page of  English Militarist literature: you have only to turn back to the burst  of glorification of war which heralded the silly Crimean campaign  (Tennyson's _Maud_ is a surviving sample) to find paeans to Mars which  would have made Treitschke blush (perhaps they did); but it was the  first page in which it was assumed as a matter of course that Germany  and not France or Russia was England's natural enemy. _The Battle of  Dorking_ had an enormous sale; and the wildest guesses were current as  to its authorship. And its moral was \"To arms; or the Germans will  besiege London as they besieged Paris.\" From that time until the  present, the British propaganda of war with Germany has never ceased.  The lead given by _The Battle of Dorking_ was taken up by articles in  the daily press and the magazines. Later on came the Jingo fever  (anti-Russian, by the way; but let us not mention that just now),  Stead's _Truth About the Navy_, Mr. Spenser Wilkinson, the suppression  of the Channel Tunnel, Mr. Robert Blatchford, Mr. Garvin, Admiral Maxse,  Mr. Newbolt, Mr. Rudyard Kipling, _The National Review_, Lord Roberts,  the Navy League, the imposition of an Imperialist Foreign Secretary on  the Liberal Cabinet, Mr. Wells's _War in the Air_ (well worth re-reading  just now), and the Dreadnoughts. Throughout all these agitations the  enemy, the villain of the piece, the White Peril, was Prussia and her  millions of German conscripts. At first, in _The Battle of Dorking_  phase, the note was mainly defensive. But from the moment when the  Kaiser began to copy our Armada policy by building a big fleet, the  anti-German agitation became openly aggressive; and the cry that the  German fleet or ours must sink, and that a war between England and  Germany was bound to come some day, speedily ceased to be merely a cry  with our Militarists and became an axiom with them. And what our  Militarists said our Junkers echoed; and our Junker diplomatists played  for. The story of how they manoeuvred to hem Germany and Austria in with  an Anglo-Franco-Russian combination will be found told with soldierly  directness and with the proud candor of a man who can see things from  his own side only in the article by Lord Roberts in the current number  of _The Hibbert Journal_ (October, 1914). There you shall see also,  after the usual nonsense about Nietzsche, the vision of \"British  administrators bearing the White Man's Burden,\" of \"young men, fresh  from the public schools of Britain, coming eagerly forward to carry on  the high traditions of Imperial Britain in each new dependency which  comes under our care,\" of \"our fitness as an Imperial race,\" of \"a great  task committed to us by Providence,\" of \"the will to conquer that has  never failed us,\" of our task of \"assuming control of one-fifth of the  earth's surface and the care of one in five of all the inhabitants of  the world.\" Not a suggestion that the inhabitants of the world are  perhaps able to take care of themselves. Not even a passing recollection  when that White Man's Burden is in question that the men outside the  British Empire, and even inside the German Empire, are by no means  exclusively black. Only the _sancta simplicitas_ that glories in \"the  proud position of England,\" the \"sympathy, tolerance, prudence and  benevolence of our rule\" in the east (as shown, the Kaiser is no doubt  sarcastically remarking, in the Delhi sedition trial), the chivalrous  feeling that it is our highest duty to save the world from the horrible  misfortune of being governed by anybody but those young men fresh from  the public schools of Britain. Change the words Britain and British to  Germany and German, and the Kaiser will sign the article with  enthusiasm. _His_ opinion, _his_ attitude (subject to that merely verbal  change) word for word.      *Six of One: Half-a-Dozen of The Other.*    Now, please observe that I do not say that the agitation was  unreasonable. I myself steadily advocated the formation of a formidable  armament, and ridiculed the notion that, we, who are wasting hundreds of  millions annually on idlers and wasters, could not easily afford double,  treble, quadruple our military and naval expenditure. I advocated the  compulsion of every man to serve his country, both in war and peace. The  idlers and wasters perceiving dimly that I meant the cost to come out of  their pockets and meant to use the admission that riches should not  exempt a man from military service as an illustration of how absurd it  is to allow them to exempt him from civil service, did not embrace my  advocacy with enthusiasm; so I must reaffirm it now lest it should be  supposed that I am condemning those whose proceedings I am describing.  Though often horribly wrong in principle, they were quite right in  practice as far as they went. But they must stand to their guns now that  the guns are going off. They must not pretend that they were harmless  Radical lovers of peace, and that the propaganda of Militarism and of  inevitable war between England and Germany is a Prussian infamy for  which the Kaiser must be severely punished. That is not fair, not true,  not gentlemanly. We began it; and if they met us half-way, as they  certainly did, it is not for us to reproach them. When the German  fire-eaters drank to The Day (of Armageddon) they were drinking to the  day of which our Navy League fire-eaters had first said \"It's bound to  come.\" Therefore, let us have no more nonsense about the Prussian Wolf  and the British Lamb, the Prussian Machiavelli and the English  Evangelist. We cannot shout for years that we are boys of the bulldog  breed, and then suddenly pose as gazelles. No. When Europe and America  come to settle the treaty that will end this business (for America is  concerned in it as much as we are), they will not deal with us as the  lovable and innocent victims of a treacherous tyrant and a savage  soldiery. They will have to consider how these two incorrigibly  pugnacious and inveterately snobbish peoples, who have snarled at one  another for forty years with bristling hair and grinning fangs, and are  now rolling over with their teeth in one another's throats, are to be  tamed into trusty watch-dogs of the peace of the world. I am sorry to  spoil the saintly image with a halo which the British Jingo journalist  sees just now when he looks in the glass; but it must be done if we are  to behave reasonably in the imminent day of reckoning.    And now back to Friedrich von Bernhardi.      *General Von Bernhardi.*    Like many soldier-authors, Friedrich is very readable; and he maintains  the good and formidable part of the Bismarck tradition: that is, he is  not a humbug. He looks facts in the face; he deceives neither himself  nor his readers; and if he were to tell lies--as he would no doubt do as  stoutly as any British, French, or Russian officer if his country's  safety were at stake--he would know that he was telling them. Which last  we think very bad taste on his part, if not downright wickedness.    It is true that he cites Frederick the Great as an exemplary master of  war and of _Weltpolitik_. But his chief praise in this department is  reserved for England. It is from our foreign policy, he says, that he  has learnt what our journalists denounce as \"the doctrine of the bully,  of the materialist, of the man with gross ideals: a doctrine of  diabolical evil.\" He frankly accepts that doctrine from us (as if our  poor, honest muddle-heads had ever formulated anything so intellectual  as a doctrine), and blames us for nothing but for allowing the United  States to achieve their solidarity and become formidable to us when we  might have divided them by backing up the South in the Civil War. He  shows in the clearest way that if Germany does not smash England,  England will smash Germany by springing at her the moment she can catch  her at a disadvantage. In a word he prophesies that we, his great  masters in _Realpolitik_, will do precisely what our Junkers have just  made us do, It is we who have carried out the Bernhardi programme: it is  Germany who has neglected it. He warned Germany to make an alliance with  Italy, Austria, Turkey, and America, before undertaking the subjugation,  first of France, then of England. But a prophet is not without honour  save in his own country; and Germany has allowed herself to be caught  with no ally but Austria between France and Russia, and thereby given  the English Junkers their opportunity. They have seized it with a  punctuality that must flatter Von Bernhardi, even though the compliment  be at the expense of his own country. The Kaiser did not give them  credit for being keener Junkers than his own. It was an unpleasant,  indeed an infuriating surprise. All that a Kaiser could do without  unbearable ignominy to induce them to keep their bulldogs off and give  him fair play with his two redoubtable foes, he did. But they laughed  Frederick the Great's laugh and hurled all our forces at him, as he  might have done to us, on Bernhardian principles, if he had caught us at  the same disadvantage. Officially, the war is Junker-cut-Junker,  militarist-cut-Militarist; and we must fight it out, not  _Heuchler_-cut-Hypocrite, but hammer and tongs.      *Militarist Myopia.*    Unofficially, it is quite another matter. Democracy, even  Social-Democracy, though as hostile to British Junkers as to German  ones, and under no illusion as to the obsolescence and colossal  stupidity of modern war, need not lack enthusiasm for the combat, which  may serve their own ends better than those of their political opponents.  For Bernhardi the Brilliant and our own very dull Militarists are alike  mad: the war will not do any of the things for which they rushed into  it. It is much more likely to do the things they "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1364"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Electric Locomotive; Or, Two Miles a Minute on the Rails (#4)"],[1," \"Well, it helps some. I at least know in a general way the 'how' of the  construction of the Jandel locomotive. It is simple enough. Too simple  by far, I should say, to get both speed and power. We'll see,\" and he  nodded his head thoughtfully.    Tom did not stay long with the girl, for it was already late in the  evening when he had arrived at her house. As he got up to depart Mary's  anxiety for his safety revived.    \"I wish you would take care now, Tom. Those men may hound you.\"    \"What for?\" chuckled the young inventor. \"They have the notes they  wanted.\"    \"But that very thing--the fact that you fooled them--will make them  more angry. Take care.\"    \"I have a means of looking out for myself, after all,\" said Tom  quietly, seeing that he must relieve her mind. \"I let that fellow get  away with my wallet; but I won't let him hurt me. Don't fear.\"    She had opened the door. The lamplight fell across porch and steps, and  in a broad white band even to the gate and sidewalk.  There was a  motor-car slowing down right before the open gate.    \"Who's this?\" queried Tom, puzzled.    A sharp voice suddenly was raised in an exclamatory explosion.    \"Bless my breakshoes! is that Tom Swift? Just the chap I was looking  for. Bless my mileage-book! this saves me time and money.\"    \"Why, it's Mr. Wakefield Damon,\" Mary cried, with something like relief  in her tones. \"You can ride home in his car, Tom.\"    \"All right, Mary. Don't be afraid for me,\" replied Tom Swift, and ran  down the walk to the waiting car.    \"Bless my vest buttons! Tom Swift, my heart swells when I see you--\"    \"And is like to burst off the said vest buttons?\" chuckled the young  fellow, stepping in beside his eccentric friend who blessed everything  inanimate in his florid speech.    \"I am delighted to catch you--although, of course,\" and Tom knew the  gentleman's eyes twinkled, \"I could have no idea that you were over  here at Mary's, Tom.\"    \"Of course not,\" rejoined the young inventor calmly. \"Seeing that I  only come to see her just as often as I get a chance.\"    \"Bless my memory tablets! is that the fact?\" chuckled Mr. Damon.  \"Anyway, I wanted to see you so particularly that I drove over in my  car tonight--\"    \"Wait a minute,\" said Tom, hastily. \"Is this important?\"    \"I think so, Tom.\"    \"Let me get something else off of my mind first, then, Mr. Damon,\" Tom  Swift said quickly. \"Drive around by Ned's house, will you, please? Ned  Newton's. After I speak a minute with him I will be at your service.    \"Surely, Tom; surely,\" agreed the gentleman.    The automobile had been running slowly. Mr. Damon knew the streets of  Shopton very well, and he headed around the next corner. As the car  turned, a figure bounded out of the shadow near the house line. Two  long strides, and the man was on the running board of the car upon the  side where Tom Swift sat. Again an ugly club was raised above the young  fellow's head.    \"You're the smart guy!\" croaked the coarse voice Tom had heard before.  \"Think you can bamboozle me, do you? Up with 'em!\"    \"Bless my spark-plug!\" gasped Mr. Wakefield Damon.    Either from nervousness or intention, he jerked the steering wheel so  that the car made a sudden leap away from the curb. The figure of the  stranger swayed.    Instantly Tom Swift struck the man's arm up higher and from under his  own coat appeared something that bulked like a pistol in his right  hand. He had intimated to Mary Nestor that he carried something with  which to defend himself from highwaymen if he chose to. This invention,  his ammonia gun, now came into play.    \"Bless my failing eyesight!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon, as he shot the  motor-car ahead again in a straight line.    The man who had accosted Tom so fiercely fell off the running board and  rolled into the gutter, screaming and choking from the fumes from Tom's  gun.    \"Drive on!\" commanded the young inventor. \"If he keeps bellowing like  that the police will pick him up. I guess he will let us alone  here-after.\"    \"Bless my short hairs and long ones!\" chuckled Mr. Damon. \"You are the  coolest young fellow, Tom, that I ever saw. That man must have been a  highwayman. And it is of some of those gentry that I drove over to  Shopton this evening to talk to you about.\"          Chapter IV    Much to Think About      Although it was now nearing ten o'clock on this eventful evening, Tom  knew that he would find Ned Newton at home. When Mr. Damon's car  stopped before the house there was a light in Ned's room and the front  door opened almost as soon as Tom rang. Mr. Damon left the car and  entered with the young inventor at his invitation.    \"What's up?\" was Ned's greeting, looking at the two curiously as he  ushered them in. \"I see this isn't entirely a social call,\" and he  laughed as he shook the older man's hand.    \"Bless my particular star!\" exclaimed the latter excitedly. \"Of all the  thrilling adventures that anybody ever got into, it is this Tom Swift  who cooks them up! Why, Newton! do you know that we have been held up  by a highwayman within two blocks of this very house?\"    \"And that of course was Tom's fault?\" suggested Ned, still smiling.    \"It wouldn't have happened if he had not been with me,\" said Mr. Damon.    \"I am curious,\" said Ned, as they seated themselves. \"Who was the  footpad? What drew his attention to you two? Tell me about it.\"    \"Bless my suspender buckles!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon. \"You tell him, Tom.  I don't understand it myself, yet.\"    \"I think I can explain. But whatever I tell you both, you must hold in  secret. Father and I have been entrusted with some private information  tonight and I am going to take you, Ned, and Mr. Damon, into the  business in a confidential way.\"    \"Let's have it,\" begged Newton. \"Anything to do with the works?\"    \"It is,\" answered Tom gravely. \"We are going to take up a proposition  that promises big things for the Swift Construction Company.\"    \"A big thing financially?\"    \"I'll say so. And it looks as though we were mixing into a conspiracy  that may breed trouble in more ways than one.\"    Tom went on to sketch briefly the situation of the Hendrickton & Pas  Alos Railroad as brought to the attention of the Swifts by the  railroad's president. First of all his two listeners were deeply  interested in the proposition Mr. Richard Bartholomew had made the  inventors. Ned Newton jotted down briefly the agreement to be  incorporated in the contract to be drawn and signed, by the Swift  Construction Company and the president of the H. & P. A.  road.    \"This looks like a big thing for the company, Tom,\" the young manager  said with enthusiasm, while Mr. Damon listened to it all with mouth and  eyes open.    \"Bless my watch-charm!\" murmured the latter. \"An electric locomotive  that can travel two miles a minute? Whew!\"    \"Sounds like a big order, Tom,\" added Ned, seriously.    \"It is a big order. I am not at all sure it can be done,\" agreed Tom,  thoughtfully. \"But under the terms Mr. Bartholomew offers it is worth  trying, don't you think?\"    \"That twenty-five thousand dollars is as good as yours anyway,\"  declared his chum with finality. \"I'll see there is no loophole in the  contract and the money must be placed in escrow so that there can be no  possibility of our losing that. The promise of a hundred thousand  dollars must be made binding as well.\"    \"I know you will look out for those details, Ned,\" Tom said with a wave  of his hand.    \"That is what I am here for,\" agreed the financial manager.  \"Now, what  else? I fancy the building of such a locomotive looks feasible to you  and your father or you would not go into it.\"    \"But two miles a minute!\" murmured Mr. Damon again. \"Bless my prize  pumpkins!\"    \"The idea of speed enters into it, yes,\" said Tom thoughtfully.  \"In  fact electric motor power has always been based on speed, and on  cheapness of moving all kinds of traffic.    \"Look here!\" he exclaimed earnestly, \"what do you suppose the first  people to dabble in electrically driven vehicles were aiming at? The  motor-car? The motor boat? Trolley cars? All those single motor sort of  things? Not much they weren't!\"    \"Bless my glove buttons!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon, dragging off his  gauntlets as he spoke. \"I don't get you at all, Tom! What do you mean?\"    \"I mean to say that the first experiments in the use of electricity as  a motive power were along the electrification of the steam locomotive.  Everybody realized that if a motor could be built powerful enough and  speedy enough to drag a heavy freight or passenger train over the  ordinary railroad right of way, the cost of railroad operation would be  enormously decreased.    \"Coal costs money--heaps of money now. Oil costs even more. But even  with a third-rail patent, a locomotive successfully built to do the  work of the great Moguls and mountain climbers of the last two decades,  and electrically driven, will make a great difference on the credit  side of any railroad's books.\"    \"Right-o!\" exclaimed Ned. \"I can see that.\"    \"That was the object of the first experiments in electric motive  power,\" repeated Tom. \"And it continues to be the big problem in  electricity. The Jandel locomotive is undoubtedly the last word so far  as the construction of an electric locomotive is concerned. But it  falls down in speed and power. I thought so myself when I saw that  locomotive and looked over the results of its work. And this Mr.  Bartholomew has assured father and me this evening that it is a fact.    \"It has a record of a mile a minute on a level or easy grade; but it  can't show goods when climbing a real hill. It slows up both freight  and passenger traffic on the Hendrickton & Pas Alos road. That range of  hills is too much for it.    \"So the Swift Construction Company is going to step in,\" concluded the  young inventor eagerly. \"I believe we can do it.  I've the nucleus of  an idea in my head. I never had a problem put up to me, Ned"]]]
