Animal motions are distinguished from the communicated motions, mentioned  in the first section, as they have no mechanical proportion to their cause;  for the goad of a spur on the skin of a horse shall induce him to move a  load of hay. They differ from the gravitating motions there mentioned as  they are exerted with equal facility in all directions, and they differ  from the chemical class of motions, because no apparent decompositions or  new combinations are produced in the moving materials.    Hence, when we say animal motion is excited by irritation, we do not mean  that the motion bears any proportion to the mechanical impulse of the  stimulus; nor that it is affected by the general gravitation of the two  bodies; nor by their chemical properties, but solely that certain animal  fibres are excited into action by something external to the moving organ.    In this sense the stimulus of the blood produces the contractions of the  heart; and the substances we take into our stomach and bowels stimulate  them to perform their necessary functions. The rays of light excite the  retina into animal motion by their stimulus; at the same time that those  rays of light themselves are physically converged to a focus by the  inactive humours of the eye. The vibrations of the air stimulate the  auditory nerve into animal action; while it is probable that the tympanum  of the ear at the same time undergoes a mechanical vibration.    To render this circumstance more easy to be comprehended, _motion may be  defined to be a variation of figure_; for the whole universe may be  considered as one thing possessing a certain figure; the motions of any of  its parts are a variation of this figure of the whole: this definition of  motion will be further explained in Section XIV. 2. 2. on the production of  ideas.    Now the motions of an organ of sense are a succession of configurations of  that organ; these configurations succeed each other quicker or slower; and  whatever configuration of this organ of sense, that is, whatever portion of  the motion of it is, or has usually been, attended to, constitutes an idea.  Hence the configuration is not to be considered as an effect of the motion  of the organ, but rather as a part or temporary termination of it; and  that, whether a pause succeeds it, or a new configuration immediately takes  place. Thus when a succession of moving objects are presented to our view,  the ideas of trumpets, horns, lords and ladies, trains and canopies, are  configurations, that is, parts or links of the successive motions of the  organ of vision.    [Illustration: Plate I.]    These motions or configurations of the organs of sense differ from the  sensorial motions to be described hereafter, as they appear to be simply  contractions of the fibrous extremities of those organs, and in that  respect exactly resemble the motions or contractions of the larger muscles,  as appears from the following experiment. Place a circular piece of red  silk about an inch in diameter on a sheet of white paper in a strong light,  as in Plate I.--look for a minute on this area, or till the eye becomes  somewhat fatigued, and then, gently closing your eyes, and shading them  with your hand, a circular green area of the same apparent diameter becomes  visible in the closed eye. This green area is the colour reverse to the red  area, which had been previously inspected, as explained in the experiments  on ocular spectra at the end of the work, and in Botanical Garden, P. 1.  additional note, No. 1. Hence it appears, that a part of the retina, which  had been fatigued by contraction in one direction, relieves itself by  exerting the antagonist fibres, and producing a contraction in an opposite  direction, as is common in the exertions of our muscles. Thus when we are  tired with long action of our arms in one direction, as in holding a bridle  on a journey, we occasionally throw them into an opposite position to  relieve the fatigued muscles.    Mr. Locke has defined an idea to be \"whatever is present to the mind;\" but  this would include the exertions of volition, and the sensations of  pleasure and pain, as well as those operations of our system, which  acquaint us with external objects; and is therefore too unlimited for our  purpose. Mr. Lock seems to have fallen into a further error, by conceiving,  that the mind could form a general or abstract idea by its own operation,  which was the copy of no particular perception; as of a triangle in  general, that was neither acute, obtuse, nor right angled. The ingenious  Dr. Berkley and Mr. Hume have demonstrated, that such general ideas have no  existence in nature, not even in the mind of their celebrated inventor. We  shall therefore take for granted at present, that our recollection or  imagination of external objects consists of a partial repetition of the  perceptions, which were excited by those external objects, at the time we  became acquainted with them; and that our reflex ideas of the operations of  our minds are partial repetitions of those operations.    II. The following article evinces that the organ of vision consists of a  fibrous part as well as of the nervous medulla, like other white muscles;  and hence, as it resembles the muscular parts of the body in its structure,  we may conclude, that it must resemble them in possessing a power of being  excited into animal motion.--The subsequent experiments on the optic nerve,  and on the colours remaining in the eye, are copied from a paper on ocular  spectra published in the seventy-sixth volume of the Philos. Trans. by Dr.  R. Darwin of Shrewsbury; which, as I shall have frequent occasion to refer  to, is reprinted in this work, Sect. XL. The retina of an ox's eye was  suspended in a glass of warm water, and forcibly torn in a few places; the  edges of these parts appeared jagged and hairy, and did not contract and  become smooth like simple mucus, when it is distended till it breaks; which  evinced that it consisted of fibres. This fibrous construction became still  more distinct to the light by adding some caustic alcali to the water; as  the adhering mucus was first eroded, and the hair-like fibres remained  floating in the vessel. Nor does the degree of transparency of the retina  invalidate this evidence of its fibrous structure, since Leeuwenhoek has  shewn, that the crystalline humour itself consists of fibres. Arc. Nat. V.  I. 70.    Hence it appears, that as the muscles consist of larger fibres intermixed  with a smaller quantity of nervous medulla, the organ of vision consists of  a greater quantity of nervous medulla intermixed with smaller fibres. It is  probable that the locomotive muscles of microscopic animals may have  greater tenuity than these of the retina; and there is reason to conclude  from analogy, that the other immediate organs of sense, as the portio  mollis of the auditory nerve, and the rete mucosum of the skin, possess a  similarity of structure with the retina, and a similar power of being  excited into animal motion.    III. The subsequent articles shew, that neither mechanical impressions, nor  chemical combinations of light, but that the animal activity of the retina  constitutes vision.    1. Much has been conjectured by philosophers about the momentum of the rays  of light; to subject this to experiment a very light horizontal balance was  constructed by Mr. Michel, with about an inch square of thin leaf-copper  suspended at each end of it, as described in Dr. Priestley's History of  Light and Colours. The focus of a very large convex mirror was thrown by  Dr. Powel, in his lectures on experimental philosophy, in my presence, on  one wing of this delicate balance, and it receded from the light; thrown on  the other wing, it approached towards the light, and this repeatedly; so  that no sensible impulse could be observed, but what might well be ascribed  to the ascent of heated air.    Whence it is reasonable to conclude, that the light of the day must be much  too weak in its dilute state to make any mechanical impression on so  tenacious a substance as the retina of the eye.--Add to this, that as the  retina is nearly transparent, it could therefore make less resistance to  the mechanical impulse of light; which, according, to the observations  related by Mr. Melvil in the Edinburgh Literary Essays, only communicates  heat, and should therefore only communicate momentum, where it is  obstructed, reflected, or refracted.--From whence also may be collected the  final cause of this degree of transparency of the retina, viz. left by the  focus of stronger lights, heat and pain should have been produced in the  retina, instead of that stimulus which excites it into animal motion.    2. On looking long on an area of scarlet silk of about an inch in diameter  laid on white paper, as in Plate I. the scarlet colour becomes fainter,  till at length it entirely vanishes, though the eye is kept uniformly and  steadily upon it. Now if the change or motion of the retina was a  mechanical impression, or a chemical tinge of coloured light, the  perception would every minute become stronger and stronger,--whereas in  this experiment it becomes every instant weaker and weaker. The same  circumstance obtains in the continued application of sound, or of sapid  bodies, or of odorous ones, or of tangible ones, to their adapted organs of  sense.    [Illustration: Plate II.]    Thus when a circular coin, as a shilling, is pressed on the palm of the  hand, the sense of touch is mechanically compressed; but it is the stimulus  of this pressure that excites the organ of touch into animal action, which  constitutes the perception of hardness and of figure; for in some minutes  the perception ceases, though the mechanical pressure of the object  remains.    3.

How funny and fat Tom had looked on top of the ladder, reaching as high as  he dared! The ladder began to wobble, and he balanced precariously, while  Angelina clutched at his fat ankles with a scream of fright. But Tom  said:--    \"Ow! Angelina, let go my ankles! You hurt! Now don't scream. I shan't fall.  Don't you know that this is the Christmas Angel, and he will never let me  get hurt on Christmas Eve?\"    Swaying wildly on one toe Tom had clutched at the air, at the tree  itself,--anywhere for support. Yet, almost as if by a miracle, he did not  fall. And the Christmas Angel was looking down from the very top of the  tree.    Miss Terry laid the little pink figure in her lap and mused. \"Mother was  wise!\" she sighed. \"She knew how to settle our quarrels in those days.  Perhaps if she had still been here things would have gone differently. Tom  might not have left me for good. _For good._\" She emphasized the words with  a nod as if arguing against something.    Again she took up the Christmas Angel and looked earnestly at it. Could it  be that tears were glistening in her eyes? Certainly not! With a sudden  sniff and jerk of the shoulders she leaned forward, holding the Angel  towards the fire. This should follow the other useless toys. But something  seemed to stay her hand. She drew back, hesitated, then rose to her feet.    \"I can't burn it,\" she said. \"It's no use, I can't burn it. But I don't  want to see the thing around. I will put this out on the sidewalk, too.  Possibly this may be different and do some good to somebody.\"    She wrapped the shawl about her shoulders and once more ran down the steps.  She left the Angel face upward in the middle of the sidewalk, and retreated  quickly to the house. As she opened the door to enter, she caught the  distant chorus of fresh young voices singing in a neighboring square:--        \"Angels from the realms of glory,      Wing your flight o'er all the earth.\"    When she took her place behind the curtain she was trembling a little, she  could not guess why. But now she watched with renewed eagerness. What was  to be the fate of the Christmas Angel? Would he fall into the right hands  and be hung upon some Christmas tree ere morning? Would he--    Miss Terry held her breath. A man was staggering along the street toward  her. He whistled noisily a vulgar song, as he reeled from curb to railing,  threatening to fall at every step. A drunken man on Christmas Eve! Miss  Terry felt a great loathing for him. He was at the foot of the steps now.  He was close upon the Angel. Would he see it, or would he tread upon it in  his disgusting blindness?    Yes--no! He saw the little pink image lying on the bricks, and with a lurch  forward bent to examine it. Miss Terry flattened her nose against the pane  eagerly. She expected to see him fall upon the Angel bodily. But no; he  righted himself with a whoop of drunken mirth.    \"Angel!\" she heard him croak with maudlin accent. \"Pink Angel, begorrah!  What doin' 'ere, eh? Whoop! Go back to sky, Angel!\" and lifting a brutal  foot he kicked the image into the street. Then with a shriek of laughter he  staggered away out of sight.    Miss Terry found herself trembling with indignation. The idea! He had  kicked the Christmas Angel,--the very Angel that Tom had hung on their  tree! It was sacrilege, or at least--Fiddlestick! Miss Terry's mind was  growing confused. She had a sudden impulse to rescue the toy from being  trampled into filthiness. The fire was better than that.    She hurried down the steps into the street, forgetting her shawl. She  sought in the snow and snatched the pink morsel to safety. Straight to the  fire she carried it, and once more held it to the flames. But again she  found it impossible to burn the thing. Once, twice, she tried. But each  time something seemed to clutch back her wrist. At last she shrugged  impatiently and laid the Angel on the mantelpiece beside the square old  marble clock, which marked the hour of half-past eight.    \"Well, I won't burn it to-night,\" she reflected. \"Somehow, I can't do it  just now. I don't see what has got into me! But to-morrow I will. Yes,  to-morrow I will.\"    She sat down in the armchair and fumbled in the old play box for the  remaining scraps. There were but a few meaningless bits of ribbon and  gauze, with the end of a Christmas candle, the survivor of some past  festival, burned on some tree in the past. All these but the last she  tossed into the fire, where they made a final protesting blaze. The  candle-end fell to the floor unnoticed.    \"There! That is the last of the stuff,\" she exclaimed with grim  satisfaction, shaking the dust from her black silk skirt. \"It is all gone  now, thank Heaven, and I can go to bed in peace. No, I forgot Norah. I  suppose I must sit up and wait for her. Bother the girl! She ought to be in  by now. What can she find to amuse her all this time? Christmas Eve!  Fiddlestick! But I have got rid of a lot of rubbish to-night, and that is  worth something.\"    She sank back in her chair and clasped her hands over her breast with a  sigh. She felt strangely weary. Her eyes sought the clock once more, and  doing so rested upon the Christmas Angel lying beside it. She frowned and  closed her eyes to shut out the sight with its haunting memories and  suggestions----          CHAPTER VII    BEFORE THE FIRE      Suddenly there was a volume of sound outside, and a great brightness filled  the room. Miss Terry opened her eyes. The fire was burning red; but a  yellow light, as from thousands of candles, shone in at the window, and  there was the sound of singing,--the sweetest singing that Miss Terry had  ever heard.        \"An Angel of the Lord came down,          And glory shone around.\"    The words seemed chanted by the voices of young angels. Miss Terry passed  her hands over her eyes and glanced at the clock. But what the hour was she  never noticed, for her gaze was filled with something else. Beside the  clock, in the spot where she had laid it a few minutes before, was the  Christmas Angel. But now, instead of lying helplessly on its back, it was  standing on rosy feet, with arms outstretched toward her. Over its head  fluttered gauzy wings. From under the yellow hair which rippled over the  shoulders two blue eyes beamed kindly upon her, and the mouth widened into  the sweetest smile.    \"Peace on earth to men of good-will!\" cried the Angel, and the tone of his  speech was music, yet quite natural and thrilling.    Miss Terry stared hard at the Angel and rubbed her eyes, saying to herself,  \"Fiddlestick! I am dreaming!\"    But she could not rub away the vision. When she opened her eyes the Angel  still stood tiptoe on the mantel-shelf, smiling at her and shaking his  golden head.    \"Angelina!\" said the Angel softly; and Miss Terry trembled to hear her name  thus spoken for the first time in years. \"Angelina, you do not want to  believe your own eyes, do you? But I am real; more real than the things you  see every day. You must believe in me. I am the Christmas Angel.\"    \"I know it.\" Miss Terry's voice was hoarse and unmanageable, as of one in a  nightmare. \"I remember.\"    \"You remember!\" repeated the Angel. \"Yes; you remember the day when you and  Tom hung me on the Christmas tree. You were a sweet little girl then, with  blue eyes and yellow curls. You believed the Christmas story and loved  Santa Claus. Then you were simple and affectionate and generous and  happy.\"    \"Fiddlestick!\" Miss Terry tried to say. But the word would not come.    \"Now you have lost the old belief and the old love,\" went on the Angel.  \"Now you have studied books and read wise men's sayings. You understand the  higher criticism, and the higher charity, and the higher egoism. You don't  believe in mere giving. You don't believe in the Christmas economics,--you  know better. But are you happy, dear Angelina?\"    Again Miss Terry thrilled at the sound of her name so sweetly spoken; but  she answered nothing. The Angel replied for her.    \"No, you are not happy because you have cut yourself off from the things  that bring folk together in peace and good-will at this holy time. Where  are your friends? Where is your brother to-night? You are still hard and  unforgiving to Tom. You refused to see him to-day, though he wrote so  boyishly, so humbly and affectionately. You have not tried to make any soul  happy. You don't believe in _me_, the Christmas Spirit.\"    There is such a word as Fiddlestick, whatever it may mean. But Miss Terry's  mind and tongue were unable to form it.    \"The Christmas spirit!\" continued the Angel. \"What is life worth if one  cannot believe in the Christmas spirit?\"    With a powerful effort Miss Terry shook off her nightmare sufficiently to  say, \"The Christmas spirit is no real thing. I have proved it to-night. It  is not real. It is a humbug!\"    \"Not real? A humbug?\" repeated the Angel softly. \"And you have proved it,  Angelina, this very night?\"    Miss Terry nodded.    \"I know what you have done,\" said the Angel. \"I know very well. How keen  you were! How clever! You made a test of Chance, to prove your point.\"    Again Miss Terry nodded with complacency.    \"What knowledge of the world! What grasp of human nature!\" commented the  Angel, smiling. \"It is like you mere mortals to say, 'I will make my test  in my own way. If certain things happen, I shall foresee what the result  must be. If certain other things happen, I shall know that I am right.'  Events fall out as you expect, and you smile with satisfaction, feeling  your wisdom justified. It ought to make you happy. But does it?\"    Miss Terry regarded the Angel doubtfully.    \"Look now!\" he went on, holding up a rosy finger. \"You are so  near-sighted! You are so unimaginative! You do not dream beyond the thing  you see. You judge the tale finished while the"]]]
