And     that is the reason why, since the dying-out of Owenism, there has been     no Socialism in England.  With the breakdown of that monopoly, the     English working-class will lose that privileged position; it will find     itself generally--the privileged and leading minority not excepted--on     a level with its fellow-workers abroad.  And that is the reason why     there will be Socialism again in England.\"    To this statement of the case, as that case appeared to me in 1885, I  have but little to add.  Needless to say that to-day there is indeed  \"Socialism again in England,\" and plenty of it--Socialism of all shades:  Socialism conscious and unconscious, Socialism prosaic and poetic,  Socialism of the working-class and of the middle-class, for, verily, that  abomination of abominations, Socialism, has not only become respectable,  but has actually donned evening dress and lounges lazily on drawing-room  _causeuses_.  That shows the incurable fickleness of that terrible despot  of \"society,\" middle-class public opinion, and once more justifies the  contempt in which we Socialists of a past generation always held that  public opinion.  At the same time, we have no reason to grumble at the  symptom itself.    What I consider far more important than this momentary fashion among  bourgeois circles of affecting a mild dilution of Socialism, and even  more than the actual progress Socialism has made in England generally,  that is the revival of the East End of London.  That immense haunt of  misery is no longer the stagnant pool it was six years ago.  It has  shaken off its torpid despair, has returned to life, and has become the  home of what is called the \"New Unionism;\" that is to say, of the  organisation of the great mass of \"unskilled\" workers.  This organisation  may to a great extent adopt the form of the old Unions of \"skilled\"  workers, but it is essentially different in character.  The old Unions  preserve the traditions of the time when they were founded, and look upon  the wages system as a once for all established, final fact, which they at  best can modify in the interest of their members.  The new Unions were  founded at a time when the faith in the eternity of the wages system was  severely shaken; their founders and promoters were Socialists either  consciously or by feeling; the masses, whose adhesion gave them strength,  were rough, neglected, looked down upon by the working-class aristocracy;  but they had this immense advantage, that _their minds were virgin soil_,  entirely free from the inherited \"respectable\" bourgeois prejudices which  hampered the brains of the better situated \"old\" Unionists.  And thus we  see now these new Unions taking the lead of the working-class movement  generally, and more and more taking in tow the rich and proud \"old\"  Unions.    Undoubtedly, the East Enders have committed colossal blunders; so have  their predecessors, and so do the doctrinaire Socialists who pooh-pooh  them.  A large class, like a great nation, never learns better or quicker  than by undergoing the consequences of its own mistakes.  And for all the  faults committed in past, present, and future, the revival of the East  End of London remains one of the greatest and most fruitful facts of this  _fin de siecle_, and glad and proud I am to have lived to see it.    F. ENGELS.  _January_ 11_th_, 1892.           INTRODUCTION      The history of the proletariat in England begins with the second half of  the last century, with the invention of the steam-engine and of machinery  for working cotton.  These inventions gave rise, as is well known, to an  industrial revolution, a revolution which altered the whole civil  society; one, the historical importance of which is only now beginning to  be recognised.  England is the classic soil of this transformation, which  was all the mightier, the more silently it proceeded; and England is,  therefore, the classic land of its chief product also, the proletariat.  Only in England can the proletariat be studied in all its relations and  from all sides.    We have not, here and now, to deal with the history of this revolution,  nor with its vast importance for the present and the future.  Such a  delineation must be reserved for a future, more comprehensive work.  For  the moment, we must limit ourselves to the little that is necessary for  understanding the facts that follow, for comprehending the present state  of the English proletariat.    Before the introduction of machinery, the spinning and weaving of raw  materials was carried on in the working-man's home.  Wife and daughter  spun the yarn that the father wove or that they sold, if he did not work  it up himself.  These weaver families lived in the country in the  neighbourhood of the towns, and could get on fairly well with their  wages, because the home market was almost the only one, and the crushing  power of competition that came later, with the conquest of foreign  markets and the extension of trade, did not yet press upon wages.  There  was, further, a constant increase in the demand for the home market,  keeping pace with the slow increase in population and employing all the  workers; and there was also the impossibility of vigorous competition of  the workers among themselves, consequent upon the rural dispersion of  their homes.  So it was that the weaver was usually in a position to lay  by something, and rent a little piece of land, that he cultivated in his  leisure hours, of which he had as many as he chose to take, since he  could weave whenever and as long as he pleased.  True, he was a bad  farmer and managed his land inefficiently, often obtaining but poor  crops; nevertheless, he was no proletarian, he had a stake in the  country, he was permanently settled, and stood one step higher in society  than the English workman of to-day.    So the workers vegetated throughout a passably comfortable existence,  leading a righteous and peaceful life in all piety and probity; and their  material position was far better than that of their successors.  They did  not need to overwork; they did no more than they chose to do, and yet  earned what they needed.  They had leisure for healthful work in garden  or field, work which, in itself, was recreation for them, and they could  take part besides in the recreations and games of their neighbours, and  all these games--bowling, cricket, football, etc., contributed to their  physical health and vigour.  They were, for the most part, strong, well-  built people, in whose physique little or no difference from that of  their peasant neighbours was discoverable.  Their children grew up in the  fresh country air, and, if they could help their parents at work, it was  only occasionally; while of eight or twelve hours work for them there was  no question.    What the moral and intellectual character of this class was may be  guessed.  Shut off from the towns, which they never entered, their yarn  and woven stuff being delivered to travelling agents for payment of  wages--so shut off that old people who lived quite in the neighbourhood  of the town never went thither until they were robbed of their trade by  the introduction of machinery and obliged to look about them in the towns  for work--the weavers stood upon the moral and intellectual plane of the  yeomen with whom they were usually immediately connected through their  little holdings.  They regarded their squire, the greatest landholder of  the region, as their natural superior; they asked advice of him, laid  their small disputes before him for settlement, and gave him all honour,  as this patriarchal relation involved.  They were \"respectable\" people,  good husbands and fathers, led moral lives because they had no temptation  to be immoral, there being no groggeries or low houses in their vicinity,  and because the host, at whose inn they now and then quenched their  thirst, was also a respectable man, usually a large tenant farmer who  took pride in his good order, good beer, and early hours.  They had their  children the whole day at home, and brought them up in obedience and the  fear of God; the patriarchal relationship remained undisturbed so long as  the children were unmarried.  The young people grew up in idyllic  simplicity and intimacy with their playmates until they married; and even  though sexual intercourse before marriage almost unfailingly took place,  this happened only when the moral obligation of marriage was recognised  on both sides, and a subsequent wedding made everything good.  In short,  the English industrial workers of those days lived and thought after the  fashion still to be found here and there in Germany, in retirement and  seclusion, without mental activity and without violent fluctuations in  their position in life.  They could rarely read and far more rarely  write; went regularly to church, never talked politics, never conspired,  never thought, delighted in physical exercises, listened with inherited  reverence when the Bible was read, and were, in their unquestioning  humility, exceedingly well-disposed towards the \"superior\" classes.  But  intellectually, they were dead; lived only for their petty, private  interest, for their looms and gardens, and knew nothing of the mighty  movement which, beyond their horizon, was sweeping through mankind.  They  were comfortable in their silent vegetation, and but for the industrial  revolution they would never have emerged from this existence, which,  cosily romantic as it was, was nevertheless not worthy of human beings.  In truth, they were not human beings; they were merely toiling machines  in the service of the few aristocrats who had guided history down to that  time.  The industrial revolution has simply carried this out to its  logical end by making the workers machines pure and simple, taking from  them the last trace of independent activity, and so forcing them to think  and demand a position worthy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17309"],[0,"The Summons of the Lord of Hosts (#4)"],[1,"Me by the power  of truth, and sent down upon Me that which thwarted his purpose. Thus were  foiled the plots of those who disbelieve in the verses of the  All-Merciful. They, truly, are a rejected people. When news spread of that  which the promptings of self had impelled My brother to attempt, and Our  companions in exile learned of his nefarious design, the voice of their  indignation and grief was lifted up and threatened to spread throughout  the city. We forbade, however, such recriminations, and enjoined upon them  patience, that they might be of those that endure steadfastly.    28 By God, besides Whom is none other God! We withstood all these trials  with forbearance, and enjoined upon God's servants to show forth patience  and fortitude. Removing Ourself from their midst, We took up residence in  another house, that perchance the flame of envy might be quenched in Our  brother's breast, and that he might be guided aright. We neither opposed  him, nor saw him again thereafter, but remained in Our home, placing Our  hopes in the bounty of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. When,  however, he realized that his deed had been exposed, he seized the pen of  calumny and wrote unto the servants of God, attributing what he had  himself committed unto Mine own peerless and wronged Beauty. His purpose  was none other than to inspire mischief amongst God's servants, and to  instil hatred into the hearts of those who had believed in God, the  All-Glorious, the All-Loving.    29 By the One in Whose hand is My soul! We were dismayed by his  deceitfulness--nay, bewildered were all things visible and invisible. Nor  did he find respite from what he harboured in his bosom until he had  committed that which no pen dare describe, and by which he disgraced the  dignity of My station and profaned the sanctity of God, the Almighty, the  All-Glorious, the All-Praised. Were God to turn all the oceans of the  earth into ink and all created things into pens, they would not suffice Me  to exhaust the record of his wrongdoings. Thus do We recount that which  befell Us, that haply ye may be of them that understand.    30 O Pen of Eternity! Grieve not at the things that have befallen Thee,  for erelong shall God raise up a people who will see with their own eyes  and will recall Thy tribulations. Withhold Thy pen from the mention of  Thine enemies, and bestir it in the praise of the Eternal King. Renounce  all created things, and quaff the sealed wine of My remembrance. Beware  lest Thou become occupied with the mention of those from whom naught save  the noisome savours of enmity can be perceived, those who are so enslaved  by their lust for leadership that they would not hesitate to destroy  themselves in their desire to emblazon their fame and perpetuate their  names. God hath recorded such souls in the Preserved Tablet as mere  worshippers of names. Recount then that which Thou hast purposed for this  Temple, that its signs and tokens may be made manifest upon earth, and  that the brightness of this Light may illumine the horizons of the world  and cleanse the earth from the defilement of those who have disbelieved in  God. Thus have We set down the verses of God and made plain the matter  unto those who understand.    31 O Living Temple! Stretch forth Thy hand over all who are in heaven and  on earth, and seize within the grasp of Thy Will the reins of command. We  have, verily, placed in Thy right hand the empire of all things. Do as  Thou willest, and fear not the ignorant. Reach out to the Tablet that hath  dawned above the horizon of the pen of Thy Lord, and take hold of it with  such strength that, through Thee, the hands of all who inhabit the earth  may be enabled to lay fast hold upon it. This, in truth, is that which  becometh Thee, if Thou be of those who understand. Through the upraising  of Thy hand to the heaven of My grace, the hands of all created things  shall be lifted up to their Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Gracious.  Erelong shall We raise up, through the aid of Thy hand, other hands endued  with power, with strength and might, and shall establish through them Our  dominion over all that dwell in the realms of revelation and creation.  Thus will the servants of God recognize the truth that there is none other  God beside Me, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. With these hands,  moreover, We shall both bestow and withhold, though none can understand  this save those who see with the eye of the spirit.    32 Say: O people! Can ye ever hope to escape the sovereign power of your  Lord? By the righteousness of God! No refuge will ye find in this day, and  no one to protect you, save those upon whom God hath bestowed the favour  of His mercy. He, verily, is the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Compassionate.  Say: O people! Forsake all that ye possess, and enter beneath the shadow  of your Lord, the All-Merciful. Better is this for you than all your works  of the past and of the future. Fear ye God, and deprive not yourselves of  the sweet savours of the days of the Lord of all names and attributes.  Take heed lest ye alter or pervert the text of the Word of God. Walk ye in  the fear of God, and be numbered with the righteous.    33 Say: O people! This is the Hand of God, which hath ever been above your  own hands, could ye but understand. Within its grasp We have ordained all  the good of the heavens and the earth, such that no good shall be made  manifest but that it proceedeth therefrom. Thus have We made it the source  and treasury of all good both aforetime and hereafter. Say: The rivers of  divine wisdom and utterance which flowed through the Tablets of God are  joined to this Most Great Ocean, could ye but perceive it, and whatever  hath been set forth in His Books hath attained its final consummation in  this most exalted Word--a Word shining above the horizon of the Will of the  All-Glorious in this Revelation which hath filled with delight all things  seen and unseen.    34 Erelong shall God draw forth, out of the bosom of power, the hands of  ascendancy and might, and shall raise up a people who will arise to win  victory for this Youth and who will purge mankind from the defilement of  the outcast and the ungodly. These hands will gird up their loins to  champion the Faith of God, and will, in My name the Self-Subsistent, the  Mighty, subdue the peoples and kindreds of the earth. They will enter the  cities and will inspire with fear the hearts of all their inhabitants.  Such are the evidences of the might of God; how fearful, how vehement is  His might, and how justly doth He wield it! He, verily, ruleth and  transcendeth all who are in the heavens and on the earth, and revealeth  what He desireth according to a prescribed measure.    35 Should any one of them be called upon to confront all the hosts of  creation, he would assuredly prevail through the ascendancy of My Will.  This, verily, is a proof of My power, though My creatures comprehend it  not. This, verily, is a sign of My sovereignty, though My subjects  understand it not. This, verily, is a token of My command, though My  servants perceive it not. This, verily, is an evidence of Mine ascendancy,  though none amongst the people is truly thankful for it, save those whose  eyes God hath illumined with the light of His knowledge, whose hearts He  hath made the repository of His Revelation, and upon whose shoulders He  hath placed the weight of His Cause. These shall inhale the fragrances of  the All-Merciful from the garment of His Name, and shall rejoice at all  times in the signs and verses of their Lord. As for those who disbelieve  in God, and join partners with Him, they shall indeed incur His wrath,  shall be cast into the Fire, and shall be made to dwell, fearful and  dismayed, in its depths. Thus do We expound Our verses, and make plain the  truth with clear proofs, that perchance the people may reflect upon the  signs of their Lord.    36 O Living Temple! We have, in very truth, appointed Thee to be the sign  of My majesty amidst all that hath been and all that shall be, and have  ordained Thee to be the emblem of My Cause betwixt the heavens and the  earth, through My word \"Be\", and it is!    37 O First Letter of this Temple, betokening the Essence of Divinity!(4)  We have made thee the treasury of My Will and the repository of My Purpose  unto all who are in the kingdoms of revelation and creation. This is but a  token of the grace of Him Who is the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.    38 O Second Letter of this Temple, betokening My name, the Almighty! We  have made thee the manifestation of Our sovereignty and the dayspring of  Our Names. Potent am I to fulfil that which My tongue speaketh.    39 O Third Letter of this Temple, betokening My name, the All-Bountiful!  We have made thee the dawning-place of Our bounty amidst Our creatures and  the fountainhead of Our generosity amidst Our people. Powerful am I in My  dominion. Nothing whatsoever of all that hath been created in the heavens  or on the earth can escape My knowledge, and I am the True One, the Knower  of things unseen.    40 O Pen! Send down out of the clouds of Thy generosity that which shall  enrich all created things, and withhold not Thy favours from the world of  being. Thou, verily, art the All-Bountiful in the heaven of Thine  eternity, and the Lord of infinite grace unto all who inhabit the kingdom  of names. Look not upon the people and the things they possess; look  rather upon the wonders of Thy gifts and favours. Gather then Thy servants  beneath Thy shade that shadoweth all mankind. Stretch forth the hand of  bounty over all creation, and the fingers of bestowal over all existence.  This, verily, is that which beseemeth Thee, though the people understand  it not. Whosoever turneth his face towards Thee doeth so by Thy grace, and  as to him who turneth away, Thy Lord, in truth, is independent of all  created things. Unto this bear"]]]
