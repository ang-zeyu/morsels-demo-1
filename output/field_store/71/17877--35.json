I do not require  nor expect my pupils to play as I do, nor interpret as I interpret, for  then I would only see just so many replicas of myself, and their  individuality would be lost. I often hear them play a composition in a  different way and with a different spirit from the one I find in it. But  I don't say to them, 'That is wrong; you must play it as I do,' No, I  let them play it as they see and feel it, so long as there is no sin  against artistic taste.    \"I trust these few points will be helpful to both player and teacher.  The latter needs all the encouragement we artists can give, for in most  cases he is doing a good work.    \"Volumes might be added to these hurried remarks, but for that my time  is too limited.\"          IV    SIGISMOND STOJOWSKI    MIND IN PIANO STUDY      Mr. Sigismond Stojowski, the eminent Polish pianist and composer, was  found one morning in his New York studio, at work with a gifted pupil.  He was willing to relax a little, however, and have a chat on such  themes as might prove helpful to both teacher and student.    \"You ask me to say something on the most salient points in piano  technic; perhaps we should say, the points that are most important to  each individual; for no two students are exactly alike, nor do any two  see things in precisely the same light. This is really a psychological  matter. I believe the subject of psychology is a very necessary study  for both teacher and student. We all need to know more about mental  processes than we do. I am often asked how to memorize, for instance--or  the best means for doing this; another psychological process. I  recommend students to read William James' _Talks on Psychology_; a very  helpful book.    \"The most vital thing in piano playing is to learn to think. Has it ever  occurred to you what infinite pains people will take to avoid thinking?  They will repeat a technical illustration hundreds of times it may be,  but with little or no thought directed to the performance. Such work is  absolutely useless. Perhaps that is a little too strong. With countless  repetitions there may at last come to be a little improvement, but it  will be very small.    \"There is quite a variety of views as to what the essentials of piano  technic are; this is a subject on which teachers, unluckily, do not  agree. For instance, on the point of finger lifting there is great  diversity of opinion. Some believe in raising the fingers very high,  others do not. Lifting the fingers high is not good for the tone, though  it may be used for velocity playing. I use quite the reverse where I  wish beautiful, singing, tone quality. The young pupil, at the  beginning, must of course learn to raise fingers and make precise  movements; when greater proficiency is reached, many modifications of  touch are used. That the best results are not more often obtained in  piano teaching and study, is as much the fault of the teacher as the  pupil. The latter is usually willing to be shown and anxious to learn.  It is for the teacher to correctly diagnose the case and administer the  most efficient remedy.    [Illustration: To Miss Harriett Brower with the kindest of remembrances,  Sigismond Stojowski New York, April 1913]      NATURAL TECHNIC    \"There is a certain amount of what I might call 'natural technic'  possessed by every one--some one point which is easy for him. It Is  often the trill. It has frequently come under my notice that players  with little facility in other ways, can make a good trill. Some singers  have this gift; Mme. Melba is one who never had to study a trill, for  she was born with a nightingale in her throat. I knew a young man in  London who was evidently born with an aptitude for octaves. He had  wonderful wrists, and could make countless repetitions of the octave  without the least fatigue. He never had to practise octaves, they came  to him naturally.    \"The teacher's work is both corrective and constructive. He must see  what is wrong and be able to correct it. Like a physician, he should  find the weak and deficient parts and build them up. He should have some  remedy at his command that will fit the needs of each pupil.    \"I give very few etudes, and those I administer in homeopathic doses. It  is not necessary to play through a mass of etudes to become a good  pianist. Much of the necessary technic may be learned from the pieces  themselves, though scales and arpeggios must form part of the daily  routine.      KEEPING UP A REPERTOIRE    \"In keeping a large number of pieces in mind, I may say that the pianist  who does much teaching is in a sense taught by his pupils. I have many  advanced pupils, and in teaching their repertoire I keep up my own. Of  course after a while one grows a little weary of hearing the same pieces  rendered by students; the most beautiful no longer seem fresh. My own  compositions are generally exceptions, as I do not often teach those. To  the thoughtful teacher, the constant hearing of his repertoire by  students shows him the difficulties that younger players have to  encounter, and helps him devise means to aid them to conquer these  obstacles. At the same time there is this disadvantage: the pianist  cannot fail to remember the places at which such and such a student had  trouble, forgot or stumbled. This has happened to me at various times.  In my recitals I would be playing ahead, quite unconscious that anything  untoward could occur--wholly absorbed in my work; when, at a certain  point, the recollection would flash over me--this is where such or such  a pupil stumbled. The remembrance is sometimes so vivid that I am at  some effort to keep my mental balance and proceed with smoothness and  certainty.    \"Yes, I go over my pieces mentally, especially if I am playing an  entirely new program which I have never played before; otherwise I do  not need to do so much of it.      FILLING IN A PASSAGE    \"You suggest that a composer may fill in or make up a passage, should he  forget a portion of the piece when playing in public. True; but  improvising on a well-known work is rather a dangerous thing to do in  order to improve a bad case. Apropos of this, I am reminded of an  incident which occurred at one of my European recitals. It was a wholly  new program which I was to give at Vevay. I had been staying with  Paderewski, and went from Morges to Vevay, to give the recital. In my  room at the hotel I was mentally reviewing the program, when in a  Mendelssohn Fugue, I found I had forgotten a small portion. I could  remember what went before and what came after, but this particular  passage had seemingly gone. I went down to the little parlor and tried  the fugue on the piano, but could not remember the portion in question.  I hastened back to my room and constructed a bridge which should connect  the two parts. When the time came to play the fugue at the recital, it  all went smoothly till I was well over the weak spot, which, it seems, I  really played as Mendelssohn wrote it. As I neared the last page, the  question suddenly occurred to me, what had I done with that doubtful  passage? What had really happened I could not remember; and the effort  to recall whether I had played Mendelssohn or Stojowski nearly brought  disaster to that last page.    \"As soon as my season closes here I shall go to London and bring out my  second piano concerto with the London Symphony Orchestra, under Nikisch.  I shall also play various recitals.\"    It was my good fortune to be present at the orchestral concert at  Queen's Hall, when Mr. Stojowski was the soloist. It was pleasant to  see the enthusiasm aroused by the concerto itself, and the performance  of it by the artist.          V    RUDOLPH GANZ    CONSERVING ENERGY IN PIANO PRACTISE      [Illustration: Rudolph Ganz]    \"One of the most necessary things is the conserving of vital energy in  piano practise,\" said the pianist Rudolph Ganz to me one day. \"The wrong  way is to continually practise the piece as though you were playing it  in public--that is to say, with all possible energy and emotion. Some of  the pianists now before the public do this, and it always makes me sorry  for them, for I know what a needless waste of energy and vital force it  is. An actor, studying his lines, does not need to continually shout  them in order to learn how they should be interpreted. Neither does the  lyric actress practise her roles with full tones, for she is well used  to saving her voice. Why then should the pianist exhaust himself and  give out his whole strength merely in the daily routine of practise? I  grant this principle of saving one's self may not be easy to learn, but  it should be acquired by all players, great and small. I think a  pianist should be able to practise five or six hours daily without  fatigue. If the player is accustomed to husband his vital force during  the daily routine of practise, he can play a long, exacting program in  public without weariness. In every day practise one often does not need  to play _forte_ nor use the pedals; a tone of medium power is  sufficient. Suppose, for instance, you are studying the Chopin Etude Op.  10, No. 12, with the left hand arpeggio work. Every note and finger must  be in place, every mark of phrasing obeyed; but during practise hours  you need not give the piece all its dashing vigor and bravura at every  repetition. Such a course would soon exhaust the player. Yet every  effect you wish to make must be thoroughly studied, must be in mind, and  used at intervals whenever a complete performance of the piece is  desired.    \"As I said before, it is often difficult to control the impulse to 'let  loose,' if the work is an exciting "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1561"],[0,"Pagan and Christian Creeds: Their Origin and Meaning (#4)"],[1,"the poor and oppressed. He had  a beloved disciple, Arjuna, (cf. John) before whom he was transfigured.  (2) His death is differently related--as being shot by an arrow, or  crucified on a tree. He descended into hell; and rose again from the  dead, ascending into heaven in the sight of many people. He will return  at the last day to be the judge of the quick and the dead.     (1) Cox's Myths of the Aryan Nations, p. 107.     (2) Bhagavat Gita, ch. xi.      Such are some of the legends concerning the pagan and pre-Christian  deities--only briefly sketched now, in order that we may get something  like a true perspective of the whole subject; but to most of them, and  more in detail, I shall return as the argument proceeds.    What we chiefly notice so far are two points; on the one hand the  general similarity of these stories with that of Jesus Christ; on the  other their analogy with the yearly phenomena of Nature as illustrated  by the course of the Sun in heaven and the changes of Vegetation on the  earth.      (1) The similarity of these ancient pagan legends and beliefs with  Christian traditions was indeed so great that it excited the attention  and the undisguised wrath of the early Christian fathers. They felt no  doubt about the similarity, but not knowing how to explain it fell  back upon the innocent theory that the Devil--in order to confound the  Christians--had, CENTURIES BEFORE, caused the pagans to adopt certain  beliefs and practices! (Very crafty, we may say, of the Devil, but also  very innocent of the Fathers to believe it!) Justin Martyr for instance  describes (1) the institution of the Lord's Supper as narrated in the  Gospels, and then goes on to say: \"Which the wicked devils have IMITATED  in the mysteries of Mithra, commanding the same thing to be done. For,  that bread and a cup of water are placed with certain incantations in  the mystic rites of one who is being initiated you either know or can  learn.\" Tertullian also says (2) that \"the devil by the mysteries of  his idols imitates even the main part of the divine mysteries.\"...  \"He baptizes his worshippers in water and makes them believe that  this purifies them from their crimes.\"... \"Mithra sets his mark on the  forehead of his soldiers; he celebrates the oblation of bread; he offers  an image of the resurrection, and presents at once the crown and the  sword; he limits his chief priest to a single marriage; he even has his  virgins and ascetics.\" (3) Cortez, too, it will be remembered complained  that the Devil had positively taught to the Mexicans the same things  which God had taught to Christendom.     (1) I Apol. c. 66.     (2) De Praescriptione Hereticorum, c. 40; De Bapt. c. 3; De  Corona, c. 15.     (3) For reference to both these examples see J. M. Robertson's  Pagan Christs, pp. 321, 322.      Justin Martyr again, in the Dialogue with Trypho says that the Birth in  the Stable was the prototype (!) of the birth of Mithra in the Cave of  Zoroastrianism; and boasts that Christ was born when the Sun takes its  birth in the Augean Stable, (1) coming as a second Hercules to cleanse  a foul world; and St. Augustine says \"we hold this (Christmas) day holy,  not like the pagans because of the birth of the Sun, but because of the  birth of him who made it.\" There are plenty of other instances in the  Early Fathers of their indignant ascription of these similarities to the  work of devils; but we need not dwell over them. There is no need for  US to be indignant. On the contrary we can now see that these  animadversions of the Christian writers are the evidence of how and to  what extent in the spread of Christianity over the world it had become  fused with the Pagan cults previously existing.     (1) The Zodiacal sign of Capricornus, iii.      It was not till the year A.D. 530 or so--five centuries after the  supposed birth of Christ--that a Scythian Monk, Dionysius Exiguus, an  abbot and astronomer of Rome, was commissioned to fix the day and the  year of that birth. A nice problem, considering the historical science  of the period! For year he assigned the date which we now adopt, (2) and  for day and month he adopted the 25th December--a date which had been  in popular use since about 350 B.C., and the very date, within a day or  two, of the supposed birth of the previous Sungods. (3) From that  fact alone we may fairly conclude that by the year 530 or earlier the  existing Nature-worships had become largely fused into Christianity. In  fact the dates of the main pagan religious festivals had by that time  become so popular that Christianity was OBLIGED to accommodate itself to  them. (1)     (1) As, for instance, the festival of John the Baptist in June  took the place of the pagan midsummer festival of water and bathing;  the Assumption of the Virgin in August the place of that of Diana in the  same month; and the festival of All Souls early in November, that of the  world-wide pagan feasts of the dead and their ghosts at the same season.     (2) See Encycl. Brit. art. \"Chronology.\"     (3) \"There is however a difficulty in accepting the 25th December  as the real date of the Nativity, December being the height of the rainy  season in Judaea, when neither flocks nor shepherds could have been at  night in the fields of Bethlehem\" (!). Encycl. Brit. art. \"Christmas  Day.\" According to Hastings's Encyclopaedia, art. \"Christmas,\" \"Usener  says that the Feast of the Nativity was held originally on the 6th  January (the Epiphany), but in 353-4 the Pope Liberius displaced it to  the 25th December... but there is no evidence of a Feast of the Nativity  taking place at all, before the fourth century A.D.\" It was not till 534  A.D. that Christmas Day and Epiphany were reckoned by the law-courts as  dies non.      This brings us to the second point mentioned a few pages back--the  analogy between the Christian festivals and the yearly phenomena of  Nature in the Sun and the Vegetation.    Let us take Christmas Day first. Mithra, as we have seen, was reported  to have been born on the 25th December (which in the Julian Calendar was  reckoned as the day of the Winter Solstice AND of the Nativity of the  Sun); Plutarch says (Isis and Osiris, c. 12) that Osiris was born on  the 361st day of the year, when a Voice rang out proclaiming the Lord of  All. Horus, he says, was born on the 362nd day. Apollo on the same.    Why was all this? Why did the Druids at Yule Tide light roaring fires?  Why was the cock supposed to crow all Christmas Eve (\"The bird of  dawning singeth all night long\")? Why was Apollo born with only one hair  (the young Sun with only one feeble ray)? Why did Samson (name derived  from Shemesh, the sun) lose all his strength when he lost his hair? Why  were so many of these gods--Mithra, Apollo, Krishna, Jesus, and others,  born in caves or underground chambers? (1) Why, at the Easter Eve  festival of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem is a light brought from the  grave and communicated to the candles of thousands who wait outside, and  who rush forth rejoicing to carry the new glory over the world? (2) Why  indeed? except that older than all history and all written records has  been the fear and wonderment of the children of men over the failure of  the Sun's strength in Autumn--the decay of their God; and the anxiety  lest by any means he should not revive or reappear?       (1) This same legend of gods (or idols) being born in caves has,  curiously enough, been reported from Mexico, Guatemala, the Antilles,  and other places in Central America. See C. F. P. von Martius,  Etknographie Amerika, etc. (Leipzig, 1867), vol. i, p. 758.     (2) Compare the Aztec ceremonial of lighting a holy fire and  communicating it to the multitude from the wounded breast of a human  victim, celebrated every 52 years at the end of one cycle and the  beginning of another--the constellation of the Pleiades being in the  Zenith (Prescott's Conquest of Mexico, Bk. I, ch. 4).      Think for a moment of a time far back when there were absolutely NO  Almanacs or Calendars, either nicely printed or otherwise, when all that  timid mortals could see was that their great source of Light and Warmth  was daily failing, daily sinking lower in the sky. As everyone now knows  there are about three weeks at the fag end of the year when the days are  at their shortest and there is very little change. What was happening?  Evidently the god had fallen upon evil times. Typhon, the prince of  darkness, had betrayed him; Delilah, the queen of Night, had shorn his  hair; the dreadful Boar had wounded him; Hercules was struggling  with Death itself; he had fallen under the influence of those malign  constellations--the Serpent and the Scorpion. Would the god grow weaker  and weaker, and finally succumb, or would he conquer after all? We can  imagine the anxiety with which those early men and women watched for the  first indication of a lengthening day; and the universal joy when the  Priest (the representative of primitive science) having made some  simple observations, announced from the Temple steps that the day WAS  lengthening--that the Sun was really born again to a new and glorious  career. (1)     (1) It was such things as these which doubtless gave the  Priesthood its power.      Let us look at the elementary science of those days a little closer.  How without Almanacs or Calendars could the day, or probable day, of the  Sun's rebirth be fixed? Go out next Christmas Evening, and at midnight  you will see the brightest of the fixed stars, Sirius, blazing in the  southern sky--not however due south from you, but somewhat to the  left of the Meridian line. Some three thousand years ago (owing to the  Precession of the Equinoxes) that star at the winter solstice did  not stand at midnight where you now see it, but almost exactly ON  the meridian line. The coming of Sirius therefore to the meridian at  midnight became the sign and assurance of the Sun"]]]
