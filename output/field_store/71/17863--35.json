Man has been so noisy about the  way he has \"conquered Nature,\" and Nature has been so silent in her  persistent influence over man, that the geographic factor in the  equation of human development has been overlooked.    [Sidenote: Stability of geographic factors in history.]    In every problem of history there are two main factors, variously stated  as heredity and environment, man and his geographic conditions, the  internal forces of race and the external forces of habitat. Now the  geographic element in the long history of human development has been  operating strongly and operating persistently. Herein lies its  importance. It is a stable force. It never sleeps. This natural  environment, this physical basis of history, is for all intents and  purposes immutable in comparison with the other factor in the  problem--shifting, plastic, progressive, retrogressive man.    [Sidenote: Persistent effect of remoteness.]    History tends to repeat itself largely owing to this steady, unchanging  geographic element. If the ancient Roman consul in far-away Britain  often assumed an independence of action and initiative unknown in the  provincial governors of Gaul, and if, centuries later, Roman Catholicism  in England maintained a similar independence towards the Holy See, both  facts have their cause in the remoteness of Britain from the center of  political or ecclesiastical power in Rome. If the independence of the  Roman consul in Britain was duplicated later by the attitude of the  Thirteen Colonies toward England, and again within the young Republic by  the headstrong self-reliance, impatient of government authority, which  characterized the early Trans-Allegheny commonwealths in their  aggressive Indian policy, and led them to make war and conclude treaties  for the cession of land like sovereign states; and if this attitude of  independence in the over-mountain men reappeared in a spirit of  political defection looking toward secession from the Union and a new  combination with their British neighbor on the Great Lakes or the  Spanish beyond the Mississippi, these are all the identical effects of  geographical remoteness made yet more remote by barriers of mountain and  sea. This is the long reach which weakens the arm of authority, no  matter what the race or country or epoch.    [Sidenote: Effect of proximity.]    As with geographical remoteness, so it is with geographical proximity.  The history of the Greek peninsula and the Greek people, because of  their location at the threshold of the Orient, has contained a  constantly recurring Asiatic element. This comes out most often as a  note of warning; like the _motif_ of Ortrud in the opera of  \"Lohengrin,\" it mingles ominously in every chorus of Hellenic  enterprise or paean of Hellenic victory, and finally swells into a  national dirge at the Turkish conquest of the peninsula. It comes out  in the legendary history of the Argonautic Expedition and the Trojan  War; in the arrival of Phoenician Cadmus and Phrygian Pelops in  Grecian lands; in the appearance of Tyrian ships on the coast of the  Peloponnesus, where they gather the purple-yielding murex and kidnap  Greek women. It appears more conspicuously in the Asiatic sources of  Greek culture; more dramatically in the Persian Wars, in the retreat  of Xenophon's Ten Thousand, in Alexander's conquest of Asia, and  Hellenic domination of Asiatic trade through Syria to the  Mediterranean. Again in the thirteenth century the lure of the  Levantine trade led Venice and Genoa to appropriate certain islands  and promontories of Greece as commercial bases nearer to Asia. In 1396  begins the absorption of Greece into the Asiatic empire of the Turks,  the long dark eclipse of sunny Hellas, till it issues from the shadow  in 1832 with the achievement of Greek independence.    [Sidenote: Persistent effect of natural barriers.]    If the factor is not one of geographical location, but a natural  barrier, such as a mountain system or a desert, its effect is just as  persistent. The upheaved mass of the Carpathians served to divide the  westward moving tide of the Slavs into two streams, diverting one into  the maritime plain of northern Germany and Poland, the other into the  channel of the Danube Valley which guided them to the Adriatic and the  foot of the Alps. This same range checked the westward advance of the  mounted Tartar hordes. The Alps long retarded Roman expansion into  central Europe, just as they delayed and obstructed the southward  advance of the northern barbarians. Only through the partial breaches in  the wall known as passes did the Alps admit small, divided bodies of the  invaders, like the Cimbri and Teutons, who arrived, therefore, with  weakened power and at intervals, so that the Roman forces had time to  gather their strength between successive attacks, and thus prolonged the  life of the declining empire. So in the Middle Ages, the Alpine barrier  facilitated the resistance of Italy to the German emperors, trying to  enforce their claim upon this ancient seat of the Holy Roman Empire.    It was by river-worn valleys leading to passes in the ridge that  Etruscan trader, Roman legion, barbarian horde, and German army crossed  the Alpine ranges. To-day well-made highways and railroads converge upon  these valley paths and summit portals, and going is easier; but the Alps  still collect their toll, now in added tons of coal consumed by engines  and in higher freight rates, instead of the ancient imposts of physical  exhaustion paid by pack animal and heavily accoutred soldier. Formerly  these mountains barred the weak and timid; to-day they bar the poor, and  forbid transit to all merchandise of large bulk and small value which  can not pay the heavy transportation charges. Similarly, the wide  barrier of the Rockies, prior to the opening of the first overland  railroad, excluded all but strong-limbed and strong-hearted pioneers  from the fertile valleys of California and Oregon, just as it excludes  coal and iron even from the Colorado mines, and checks the free  movement of laborers to the fields and factories of California, thereby  tightening the grip of the labor unions upon Pacific coast industries.    [Sidenote: Persistent effect of nature-made highways.]    As the surface of the earth presents obstacles, so it offers channels  for the easy movement of humanity, grooves whose direction determines  the destination of aimless, unplanned migrations, and whose termini  become, therefore, regions of historical importance. Along these  nature-made highways history repeats itself. The maritime plain of  Palestine has been an established route of commerce and war from the  time of Sennacherib to Napoleon.[1] The Danube Valley has admitted to  central Europe a long list of barbarian invaders, covering the period  from Attila the Hun to the Turkish besiegers of Vienna in 1683. The  history of the Danube Valley has been one of warring throngs, of  shifting political frontiers, and unassimilated races; but as the river  is a great natural highway, every neighboring state wants to front upon  it and strives to secure it as a boundary.    The movements of peoples constantly recur to these old grooves. The  unmarked path of the voyageur's canoe, bringing out pelts from Lake  Superior to the fur market at Montreal, is followed to-day by whaleback  steamers with their cargoes of Manitoba wheat. To-day the Mohawk  depression through the northern Appalachians diverts some of Canada's  trade from the Great Lakes to the Hudson, just as in the seventeenth  century it enabled the Dutch at New Amsterdam and later the English at  Albany to tap the fur trade of Canada's frozen forests. Formerly a line  of stream and portage, it carries now the Erie Canal and New York  Central Railroad.[2] Similarly the narrow level belt of land extending  from the mouth of the Hudson to the eastern elbow of the lower Delaware,  defining the outer margin of the rough hill country of northern New  Jersey and the inner margin of the smooth coastal plain, has been from  savage days such a natural thoroughfare. Here ran the trail of the  Lenni-Lenapi Indians; a little later, the old Dutch road between New  Amsterdam and the Delaware trading-posts; yet later the King's Highway  from New York to Philadelphia. In 1838 it became the route of the  Delaware and Raritan Canal, and more recently of the Pennsylvania  Railroad between New York and Philadelphia.[3]    The early Aryans, in their gradual dispersion over northwestern India,  reached the Arabian Sea chiefly by a route running southward from the  Indus-Ganges divide, between the eastern border of the Rajputana Desert  and the western foot of the Aravalli Hills. The streams flowing down  from this range across the thirsty plains unite to form the Luni River,  which draws a dead-line to the advance of the desert. Here a smooth and  well-watered path brought the early Aryans of India to a fertile coast  along the Gulf of Cambay.[4] In the palmy days of the Mongol Empire  during the seventeenth century, and doubtless much earlier, it became an  established trade route between the sea and the rich cities of the upper  Ganges.[5] Recently it determined the line of the Rajputana Railroad  from the Gulf of Cambay to Delhi.[6] Barygaza, the ancient seaboard  terminus of this route, appears in Pliny's time as the most famous  emporium of western India, the resort of Greek and Arab merchants.[7] It  reappears later in history with its name metamorphosed to Baroche or  Broach, where in 1616 the British established a factory for trade,[8]  but is finally superseded, under Portuguese and English rule, by nearby  Surat.

Elizabeth pretended that they were  very trying to her Christian virtues. But leave out of count the  foregoing deeds--which no one can dispute were prodigious, and quite  equal to the part these men played in the destruction of the  Armada--what could be more dashingly brilliant in naval warfare than  Drake's raids on San Domingo, Carthagena, Cadiz, and other ports and  cities of old and new Spain, to which I have already briefly alluded?  It was their great successes in their great undertakings, no matter  whether it was \"shocking piracy\" or not, that immortalized these  terrible creators of England's greatness all the world over!    Thomas Cobham, a member of a lordly and Protestant family, became a  sailor, and soon became fascinated with the gay life of privateering.  Once when in command of a vessel, eagerly scouring the seas for  Spanish prizes, one was sighted, bound from Antwerp to Cadiz. Cobham  gave chase, easily captured her in the Bay of Biscay, and discovered  there were forty Inquisition prisoners aboard. After rescuing the  prisoners, the captain and crew of the Spanish vessel were then sewn  up in their own mainsail and tossed into the sea, no doubt with such  sententious expressions of godliness as was thought befitting to  sacred occasions of that period. This ceremony having been performed,  the vessel was scuttled, so that she might nevermore be used in  trading with British sailors or any one else for Inquisition  purposes. When the story became known, the case was discreetly  inquired into, and very properly the gallant Cobham was never  punished, and was soon running here and there at his old game.    It may be taken for granted that there was no mincing matters when an  opportunity for reprisals occurred. The Spaniards had carried  barbarism to such a pitch in seizing our ships and condemning their  crews to the galleys, that Queen Elizabeth was never averse to meeting  murder and plunder by more than the equivalent in retaliation, except  when she imagined that Philip was showing signs of overpowering  strength; she then became timid and vacillating. She was never  mentally disturbed by the moral side of the great deeds that brought  her vast stores of plunder. Moreover, she could always find an  accommodating bishop to put her qualms (if she ever had any, except  those of consequence to herself) at rest on points of conscience. One  noted personage, who held high ecclesiastical office, told her that it  was a virtue to seize treasure when she knew it would otherwise be  used for the purpose of murdering her Protestant subjects. Sir Arthur  Champernowne, a noted vice-admiral of Elizabeth's reign, in writing to  Cecil of the vessel that had put into Plymouth through stress of  weather with the needy Philip's half-million of ducats on board,  borrowed, it is said, from a Genoa firm of financiers, said it should  be claimed as fair booty. Sir Arthur's view was that anything taken  from so perfidious a nation was both necessary and profitable to the  Commonwealth. No doubt a great deal of pious discussion would centre  round the Vice-Admiral's easy moral but very logical opinions. The  main thing in his mind, and in that of everybody else who was free  from poisoned cant, was that the most shocking crimes were being  openly advocated by Philip, King of Spain, against all European  Protestants, rich or poor, who came within the clutches of the savages  that administered the cruelties of the Inquisition. The canting crowd  shrieked against the monstrous impiety of such notions, but their  efforts to prove purity of motive were unavailing.    After considered thought by a committee of men of high rectitude, it  was decided to act without fear or favour in a strictly impartial  manner, so Philip's half-million of bullion was divided between the  Prince of Orange and the rigid moralist, Elizabeth, who is credited  with having spent her share on the Navy, a very admirable way of  disposing of it.    This act was the cause of a deluge of reprisals on the part of Spain.  But, from all accounts, Elizabeth's corsairs had always the best of it  in matters of material importance. The Spanish are naturally a proud,  brave race. In the middle of the sixteenth century their power  dominated two-thirds of the universe, and had they stuck to business,  and not so feverishly to the spreading of their religious faith by  violent means, they might have continued a predominant nation.    Their civil, naval, and military position was unequalled. The  commerce and wealth of the whole world was pre-eminently in their  hands, and in common with other nations who arrive at heights of  power, prosperity, and grandeur (which last sits so easily on the  Spaniard), they gave way to pleasures and to the luxury of laziness  which invariably carries with it sensuality. Wherever they found  themselves in the ascendancy, they intrigued to impose the Roman faith  on the population, and if that method did not succeed with felicity,  whenever the agents of their governing classes, including their king,  met with opposition from prominent men or women, their opponents were  put to the rack, burnt, or their heads sent flying. In this country no  leading Protestant's life or property was safe. Even Elizabeth, during  the reign of her half-sister, Mary, was obliged to make believe that  her religious faith was Roman in harmony with that of the Queen. It  was either adoption, deception, or execution, and the future queen  outwitted all their traps and inventions until Mary passed on, and  Elizabeth took her place on the throne.    Meanwhile, Spain, as I have indicated, was tampering with abiding  laws. Catastrophe always follows perilous habits of life, which were  correctly attributed to the Spanish. As with individuals, so it is  with nations; pride can never successfully run in conjunction with the  decadence of wealth. It is manifestly true that it is easier for a  nation to go up than to realize that it has come down, and during long  years Spain has had to learn this bitter lesson. It was not only  imperious pride of race and extravagant grandeur that brought the  destruction of her supremacy of the seas, and the wealth and supremacy  of many lands, but their intolerable religious despotism towards those  who were not already, and refused to become, as I have said, adherents  of the Roman Catholic creed. Poor wretches who were not strong enough  to defend themselves had the mark of heretics put on them; and for  nearly thirty years Spaniards carried on a system of burning British  seamen whenever they could lay hands on them. They kept up a constant  system of spying and plotting against the British Protestant Queen and  her subjects of every position in life. The policy of the Spanish King  and government was to make the British and other races vassals of the  Pope. Philip, like all powerful monarchs and individuals who are put  into power without any of the qualities of fitness to fill a high  post, always believed that his presence on earth was an act of supreme  Providence. Philip, in proclaiming his glorious advent for the good of  mankind, explained it with a decorum that had a fascinating flavour.  Unlike some imitators of great personalities, he was never vulgarly  boastful in giving expression to the belief that his power came from  above and would be sustained by the mystery that gave him it in such  abundance, but, in fact, he never doubted what was known as the  doctrine of the divine right of kings.    The human support which kept him in authority did not enter into his  calculations. The popular notions of the democracies then was that no  physical force could sever the alliance which existed between God and  monarchs; and there is no evidence that Philip was ever disillusioned.  He regarded his adversaries, especially Hawkins and Drake, in the  light of magicians possessed of devilish spirits that were in conflict  with the wishes of the Deity. His highly placed and best naval  officer, Santa Cruz, took a more realistic view than his master,  though he might have had doubts as to whether the people who were at  war with Spain were not a species of devil. But he expressed the view  which even at this distance of time shows him to have been a man of  sane, practical thought. Philip imagined he could agree with the acts  of assassins (and also support the Holy Office) in their policy of  burning English sailors as heretics. Santa Cruz reflected more deeply,  and advised the King that such acts were positively courting disaster,  because \"the British corsairs had teeth, and could use them.\"    Spain looked upon her naval position as impregnable, but Elizabeth's  pirates contemptuously termed it \"a Colossus stuffed with clouts.\"  Priests, crucifixes, and reliance on supernatural assistance had no  meaning for them. If any suggestion to impose on them by such means  had been made, they would have cast the culprits over the side into  the sea. They were peculiarly religious, but would tolerate no saintly  humbugs who lived on superstition. When they had serious work in hand,  they relied on their own mental and physical powers, and if they  failed in their objective, they reverently remarked, \"The reason is  best known to God\"--a simple, unadorned final phrase.    Some of the sayings and doings, reliable or unreliable, that have been  handed down to us, are extremely comical, looking at them from our  religious standpoint in these days; for instance, Drake's method of  dealing with insubordination, his idea of how treason was to be  stamped out, and the trial of Doughty, the traitor.    People who sit in cosy houses, which these early sailors made it  possible for them in other days and now to acquire, may regard many of  the disciplinary methods of Drake and his sea contemporaries as sheer  savage murder, but"]]]
