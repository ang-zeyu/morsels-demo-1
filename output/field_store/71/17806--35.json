I am  always so sorry for him.\"    Her companion cast a quiet glance upon her.    \"He was the greatest man who ever lived,\" she said, \"the man I like  best.\"    \"And what did he do?\" asked Em, conscious that she had made a mistake,  and that her prophet was not the man.    \"He was one man, only one,\" said her little companion slowly, \"yet all  the people in the world feared him. He was not born great, he was common  as we are; yet he was master of the world at last. Once he was only a  little child, then he was a lieutenant, then he was a general, then he  was an emperor. When he said a thing to himself he never forgot it. He  waited, and waited and waited, and it came at last.\"    \"He must have been very happy,\" said Em.    \"I do not know,\" said Lyndall; \"but he had what he said he would have,  and that is better than being happy. He was their master, and all the  people were white with fear of him. They joined together to fight him.  He was one and they were many, and they got him down at last. They  were like the wild cats when their teeth are fast in a great dog, like  cowardly wild cats,\" said the child, \"they would not let him go. There  were many; he was only one. They sent him to an island on the sea, a  lonely island, and kept him there fast. He was one man, and they were  many, and they were terrified at him. It was glorious!\" said the child.    \"And what then?\" said Em.    \"Then he was alone there in that island with men to watch him always,\"  said her companion, slowly and quietly. \"And in the long lonely nights  he used to lie awake and think of the things he had done in the old  days, and the things he would do if they let him go again. In the day  when he walked near the shore it seemed to him that the sea all around  him was a cold chain about his body pressing him to death.\"    \"And then?\" said Em, much interested.    \"He died there in that island; he never got away.\"    \"It is rather a nice story,\" said Em; \"but the end is sad.\"    \"It is a terrible, hateful ending,\" said the little teller of the story,  leaning forward on her folded arms; \"and the worst is, it is true. I  have noticed,\" added the child very deliberately, \"that it is only the  made-up stories that end nicely; the true ones all end so.\"    As she spoke the boy's dark, heavy eyes rested on her face.    \"You have read it, have you not?\"    He nodded. \"Yes; but the Brown history tells only what he did, not what  he thought.\"    \"It was in the Brown history that I read of him,\" said the girl; \"but I  know what he thought. Books do not tell everything.\"    \"No,\" said the boy, slowly drawing nearer to her and sitting down at her  feet. \"What you want to know they never tell.\"    Then the children fell into silence, till Doss, the dog, growing uneasy  at its long continuance, sniffed at one and the other, and his master  broke forth suddenly:    \"If they could talk, if they could tell us now!\" he said, moving his  hand out over the surrounding objects--\"then we would know something.  This kopje, if it could tell us how it came here! The 'Physical  Geography' says,\" he went on most rapidly and confusedly, \"that what  were dry lands now were once lakes; and what I think is this--these low  hills were once the shores of a lake; this kopje is some of the stones  that were at the bottom, rolled together by the water. But there is  this--How did the water come to make one heap here alone, in the centre  of the plain?\" It was a ponderous question; no one volunteered an  answer. \"When I was little,\" said the boy, \"I always looked at it and  wondered, and I thought a great giant was buried under it. Now I know  the water must have done it; but how? It is very wonderful. Did one  little stone come first, and stop the others as they rolled?\" said the  boy with earnestness, in a low voice, more as speaking to himself than  to them.    \"Oh, Waldo, God put the little kopje here,\" said Em with solemnity.    \"But how did he put it here?\"    \"By wanting.\"    \"But how did the wanting bring it here?\"    \"Because it did.\"    The last words were uttered with the air of one who produces a clinching  argument. What effect it had on the questioner was not evident, for he  made no reply, and turned away from her.    Drawing closer to Lyndall's feet, he said after a while in a low voice:    \"Lyndall, has it never seemed to you that the stones were talking with  you? Sometimes,\" he added in a yet lower tone, \"I lie under there with  my sheep, and it seems that the stones are really speaking--speaking of  the old things, of the time when the strange fishes and animals lived  that are turned into stone now, and the lakes were here; and then of the  time when the little Bushmen lived here, so small and so ugly, and used  to sleep in the wild dog holes, and in the sloots, and eat snakes, and  shot the bucks with their poisoned arrows. It was one of them, one  of these old wild Bushmen, that painted those,\" said the boy, nodding  toward the pictures--\"one who was different from the rest. He did not  know why, but he wanted to make something beautiful--he wanted to make  something, so he made these. He worked hard, very hard, to find the  juice to make the paint; and then he found this place where the rocks  hang over, and he painted them. To us they are only strange things, that  make us laugh; but to him they were very beautiful.\"    The children had turned round and looked at the pictures.    \"He used to kneel here naked, painting, painting, painting; and he  wondered at the things he made himself,\" said the boy, rising and moving  his hand in deep excitement. \"Now the Boers have shot them all, so that  we never see a little yellow face peeping out among the stones.\" He  paused, a dreamy look coming over his face. \"And the wild bucks have  gone, and those days, and we are here. But we will be gone soon, and  only the stones will lie on here, looking at everything like they look  now. I know that it is I who am thinking,\" the fellow added slowly, \"but  it seems as though it were they who are talking. Has it never seemed so  to you, Lyndall?\"    \"No, it never seems so to me,\" she answered.    The sun had dipped now below the hills, and the boy, suddenly  remembering the ewes and lambs, started to his feet.    \"Let us also go to the house and see who has come,\" said Em, as the boy  shuffled away to rejoin his flock, while Doss ran at his heels, snapping  at the ends of the torn trousers as they fluttered in the wind.          Chapter 1.III. I Was A Stranger, and Ye Took Me In.    As the two girls rounded the side of the kopje, an unusual scene  presented itself. A large group was gathered at the back door of the  homestead.    On the doorstep stood the Boer-woman, a hand on each hip, her face  red and fiery, her head nodding fiercely. At her feet sat the yellow  Hottentot maid, her satellite, and around stood the black Kaffer maids,  with blankets twisted round their half-naked figures. Two, who stamped  mealies in a wooden block, held the great stampers in their hands, and  stared stupidly at the object of attraction. It certainly was not to  look at the old German overseer, who stood in the centre of the group,  that they had all gathered together. His salt-and-pepper suit, grizzly  black beard, and grey eyes were as familiar to every one on the farm  as the red gables of the homestead itself; but beside him stood the  stranger, and on him all eyes were fixed. Ever and anon the newcomer  cast a glance over his pendulous red nose to the spot where the  Boer-woman stood, and smiled faintly.    \"I'm not a child,\" cried the Boer-woman, in low Cape Dutch, \"and I  wasn't born yesterday. No, by the Lord, no! You can't take me in! My  mother didn't wean me on Monday. One wink of my eye and I see the whole  thing. I'll have no tramps sleeping on my farm,\" cried Tant Sannie  blowing. \"No, by the devil, no! not though he had sixty-times-six red  noses.\"    There the German overseer mildly interposed that the man was not a  tramp, but a highly respectable individual, whose horse had died by an  accident three days before.    \"Don't tell me,\" cried the Boer-woman; \"the man isn't born that can take  me in. If he'd had money, wouldn't he have bought a horse? Men who walk  are thieves, liars, murderers, Rome's priests, seducers! I see the devil  in his nose!\" cried Tant Sannie shaking her fist at him; \"and to come  walking into the house of this Boer's child and shaking hands as though  he came on horseback! Oh, no, no!\"    The stranger took off his hat, a tall, battered chimneypot, and  disclosed a bald head, at the back of which was a little fringe of  curled white hair, and he bowed to Tant Sannie.    \"What does she remark, my friend?\" he inquired, turning his  crosswise-looking"]]]
