While studying and writing      articles upon a new subject I came in contact with a specialist,      who rendered me considerable aid, and, one day, while jointly      correcting a piece of work, he touched my hand. This produced a      sweet and pure sensation of thrill through the whole system. I      said nothing; in fact, was too thrilled for speech; and never to      this day have shown any responsive action, but for months at      certain periods, generally twice a month, I have experienced the      most pleasurable emotions. I have seen this friend twice since,      and have a curious feeling that I stand on one side of a hedge,      while he is on the other, and, as neither makes an approach,      pleasure of the highest kind is experienced, but not allowed to      go beyond reasonable and health-giving bounds. In some moments I      feel overcome by a sense of mastery by this man, and yet, feeling      that any approach would be undignified, some pleasure is      experienced in restraining and keeping within proper bounds this      passional emotion. All these thrills of pleasurable emotion      possess a psychic value, and, so long as the nervous system is      kept in perfect health, they do not seem to have the power to      injure, but rather one is able to utilize the passionate emotions      as weapons for pleasure and work.\"        Various parts of the skin surface appear to have special sexual      sensitiveness, peculiarly marked in many individuals, especially      women; so that, as Fere remarks (_L'Instinct Sexuel_, second      edition, 1902, p. 130), contact stimulation of the lips, lobe of      ear, nape of neck, little finger, knee, etc., may suffice even to      produce the orgasm. Some sexually hyperaesthetic women, as has      already been noted, experience this when shaking hands with a man      who is attractive to them. In some neurotic persons this      sensibility, as Fere shows, may exist in so morbid a degree that      even the contact of the sensitive spot with unattractive persons      or inanimate objects may produce the orgasm. In this connection      reference may be made to the well-known fact that in some      hysterical subjects there are so-called \"erogenous zones\" simple      pressure on which suffices to evoke the complete orgasm. There      is, perhaps, some significance, from our present point of view,      in the fact that, as emphasized by Savill (\"Hysterical Skin      Symptoms,\" _Lancet_, January 30, 1904), the skin is one of the      very best places to study hysteria.        The intimate connection between the skin and the sexual sphere is      also shown in pathological conditions of the skin, especially in      acne as well as simple pimples on the face. The sexual      development of puberty involves a development of hair in various      regions of the body which previously were hairless. As, however,      the sebaceous glands on the face and elsewhere are the vestiges      of former hairs and survive from a period when the whole body was      hairy, they also tend to experience in an abortive manner this      same impulse. Thus, we may say that, with the development of the      sexual organs at puberty, there is correlated excitement of the      whole pilo-sebaceous apparatus. In the regions where this      apparatus is vestigial, and notably in the face, this abortive      attempt of the hair-follicles and their sebaceous appendages to      produce hairs tends only to disorganization, and simple      _comedones_ or pustular acne pimples are liable to occur. As a      rule, acne appears about puberty and dies out slowly during      adolescence. While fairly common in young women, it is usually      much less severe, but tends to be exacerbated at the menstrual      periods; it is also apt to appear at the change of life. (Stephen      Mackenzie, \"The Etiology and Treatment of Acne Vulgaris,\"      _British Medical Journal_, September 29, 1894. Laycock [_Nervous      Diseases of Women_, 1840, p. 23] pointed out that acne occurs      chiefly in those parts of the surface covered by sexual hair. A      lucid account of the origin of acne will be found in Woods      Hutchinson's _Studies in Human and Comparative Pathology_, pp.      179-184. G.J. Engelmann [\"The Hystero-neuroses,\" _Gynaecological      Transactions_, 1887, pp. 124 et seq.] discusses various      pathological disorders of the skin as reflex disturbances      originating in the sexual sphere.)        The influence of menstruation in exacerbating acne has been      called in question, but it seems to be well established. Thus,      Bulkley (\"Relation between Certain Diseases of the Skin and the      Menstrual Function,\" _Transactions of the Medical Society of New      York_, 1901, p. 328) found that, in 510 cases of acne in women,      145, or nearly one-third, were worse about the monthly period.      Sometimes it only appeared during menstruation. The exacerbation      occurred much more frequently just before than just after the      period. There was usually some disturbance of menstruation.      Various other disorders of the skin show a similar relationship      to menstruation.        It has been asserted that masturbation is a frequent or constant      cause of acne at puberty. (See, e.g., discussion in _British      Medical Journal_, July, 1882.) This cannot be accepted. Acne very      frequently occurs without masturbation, and masturbation is very      frequently practiced without producing acne. At the same time we      may well believe that at the period of puberty, when the      pilo-sebaceous system is already in sensitive touch with the      sexual system, the shock of frequently repeated masturbation may      (in the same way as disordered menstruation) have its      repercussion on the skin. Thus, a lady has informed me that at      about the age of 18 she found that frequently repeated      masturbation was followed by the appearance of _comedones_.      FOOTNOTES:    [2] A.

Ticklishness--Its Origin and Significance--The Psychology of  Tickling--Laughter--Laughter as a Kind of Detumescence--The Sexual  Relationships of Itching--The Pleasure of Tickling--Its Decrease with Age  and Sexual Activity.      Touch, as has already been remarked, is the least intellectual of the  senses. There is, however, one form of touch sensation--that is to say,  ticklishness--which is of so special and peculiar a nature that it has  sometimes been put aside in a class apart from all other touch sensations.  Scaliger proposed to class titillation as a sixth, or separate, sense.  Alrutz, of Upsala, regards tickling as a milder degree of itching, and  considers that the two together constitute a sensation of distinct quality  with distinct end-organs, for the mediation of that quality.[5] However we  may regard this extreme view, tickling is certainly a specialized  modification of touch and it is at the same time the most intellectual  mode of touch sensation and that with the closest connection with the  sexual sphere. To regard tickling as an intellectual manifestation may  cause surprise, more especially when it is remembered that ticklishness is  a form of sensation which reaches full development very early in life, and  it has to be admitted that, as compared even with the messages that may be  sent through smell and taste, the intellectual element in ticklishness  remains small. But its presence here has been independently recognized by  various investigators. Groos points out the psychic factor in tickling as  evidenced by the impossibility of self-tickling.[6] Louis Robinson  considers that ticklishness \"appears to be one of the simplest  developments of mechanical and automatic nervous processes in the  direction of the complex functioning of the higher centres which comes  within the scope of psychology,\"[7] Stanley Hall and Allin remark that  \"these minimal touch excitations represent the very oldest stratum of  psychic life in the soul.\"[8] Hirman Stanley, in a somewhat similar  manner, pushes the intellectual element in ticklishness very far back and  associates it with \"tentacular experience.\" \"By temporary self-extension,\"  he remarks, \"even low amoeboid organisms have slight, but suggestive,  touch experiences that stimulate very general and violent reactions, and  in higher organisms extended touch-organs, as tentacles, antennae, hair,  etc., become permanent and very delicately sensitive organs, where minimal  contacts have very distinct and powerful reactions.\" Thus ticklishness  would be the survival of long passed ancestral tentacular experience,  which, originally a stimulation producing intense agitation and alarm, has  now become merely a play activity and a source of keen pleasure.[9]    We need not, however, go so far back in the zooelogical series to explain  the origin and significance of tickling in the human species. Sir J.Y.  Simpson suggested, in an elaborate study of the position of the child in  the womb, that the extreme excitomotory sensibility of the skin in various  regions, such as the sole of the foot, the knee, the sides, which already  exists before birth, has for its object the excitation and preservation of  the muscular movements necessary to keep the foetus in the most favorable  position in the womb.[10] It is, in fact, certainly the case that the  stimulation of all the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13614"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 5 (#4)"],[1,"more precious than any Saint's  Relique, he lays it up in his casket (O blessed Relique) and every day  will kiss it: if in her presence his eye is never off her, and drink he  will where she drank, if it be possible, in that very place,\" etc.[9]        Burton's accuracy in describing the ways of lovers in his century      is shown by a passage in Hamilton's _Memoires de Gramont_. Miss      Price, one of the beauties of Charles II's court, and Dongan were      tenderly attached to each other; when the latter died he left      behind a casket full of all possible sorts of love-tokens      pertaining to his mistress, including, among other things, \"all      kinds of hair.\" And as regards France, Burton's contemporary,      Howell, wrote in 1627 in his _Familiar Letters_ concerning the      repulse of the English at Rhe: \"A captain told me that when they      were rifling the dead bodies of the French gentlemen after the      first invasion they found that many of them had their mistresses'      favors tied about their genitories.\"        Schurig (_Spermatologia_, p. 357) at the beginning of the      eighteenth century knew a Belgian lady who, when her dearly loved      husband died, secretly cut off his penis and treasured it as a      sacred relic in a silver casket. She eventually powdered it, he      adds, and found it an efficacious medicine for herself and      others. An earlier example, of a lady at the French court who      embalmed and perfumed the genital organs of her dead husband,      always preserving them in a gold casket, is mentioned by      Brantome. Mantegazza knew a man who kept for many years on his      desk the skull of his dead mistress, making it his dearest      companion. \"Some,\" he remarks, \"have slept for months and years      with a book, a garment, a trifle. I once had a friend who would      spend long hours of joy and emotion kissing a thread of silk      which _she_ had held between her fingers, now the only relic of      love.\" (Mantegazza, _Fisiologia dell' Amore_, cap. X.) In the      same way I knew a lady who in old age still treasured in her      desk, as the one relic of the only man she had ever been      attracted to, a fragment of paper he had casually twisted up in a      conversation with her half a century before.    The tendency to treasure the relics of a beloved person, more especially  the garments, is the simplest and commonest foundation of erotic  symbolism. It is without doubt absolutely normal. It is inevitable that  those objects which have been in close contact with the beloved person's  body, and are intimately associated with that person in the lover's mind,  should possess a little of the same virtue, the same emotional potency. It  is a phenomenon closely analogous to that by which the relics of saints  are held to possess a singular virtue. But it becomes somewhat less normal  when the garment is regarded as essential even in the presence of the  beloved person.[10]    While an extremely large number of objects and acts may be found to  possess occasionally the value of erotic symbols, such symbols most  frequently fall into certain well-defined groups. A vast number of  isolated objects or acts may be exceptionally the focus of erotic  contemplation, but the objects and acts which frequently become thus  symbolic are comparatively few.    It seems to me that the phenomena of erotic symbolism may be most  conveniently grouped in three great classes, on the basis of the objects  or acts which arouse them.    I. PARTS OF THE BODY.--_A. Normal:_ Hand, foot, breasts, nates, hair,  secretions and excretions, etc.    _B. Abnormal:_ Lameness, squinting, pitting of smallpox, etc. Paidophilia  or the love of children, presbyophilia or the love of the aged, and  necrophilia or the attraction for corpses, may be included under this  head, as well as the excitement caused by various animals.      II. INANIMATE OBJECTS.[11]--_A. Garments:_ Gloves, shoes and stockings and  garters, caps, aprons, handkerchiefs, underlinen.    _B. Impersonal Objects:_ Here may be included all the various objects that  may accidentally acquire the power of exciting sexual feeling in  auto-erotism. Pygmalionism may also be included.      III. ACTS AND ATTITUDES.--_A. Active:_ Whipping, cruelty, exhibitionism.  _B. Passive:_ Being whipped, experiencing cruelty. Personal odors and the  sound of the voice may be included under this head. _C. Mixoscopic:_ The  vision of climbing, swinging, etc. The acts of urination and defecation.  The coitus of animals.    Although the three main groups into which the phenomena of erotic  symbolism are here divided may seem fairly distinct, they are yet very  closely allied, and indeed overlap, so that it is possible, as we shall  see, for a single complex symbol to fall into all three groups.    A very complete kind of erotic symbolism is furnished by Pygmalionism or  the love of statues.[12] It is exactly analogous to the child's love of a  doll, which is also a form of sexual (though not erotic) symbolism. In a  somewhat less abnormal form, erotic symbolism probably shows itself in its  simplest shape in the tendency to idealize unbeautiful peculiarities in a  beloved person, so that such peculiarities are ever afterward almost or  quite essential in order to arouse sexual attraction. In this way men have  become attracted to limping women. Even the most normal man may idealize a  trifling defect in a beloved woman. The attention is inevitably  concentrated on any such slight deviation from regular beauty, and the  natural result of such concentration is that a complexus of associated  thoughts and emotions becomes attached to something that in itself is  unbeautiful. A defect becomes an admired focus of attention, the embodied  symbol of the lover's emotion.        Thus a mole is not in itself beautiful, but by the tendency to      erotic symbolism it becomes so. Persian poets especially have      lavished the richest imagery on moles (_Anis El-Ochchaq_ in      _Bibliotheque des Hautes Etudes_, fasc, 25, 1875); the Arabs, as      Lane remarks (_Arabian Society in the Middle Ages_, p. 214), are      equally extravagant in their admiration of a mole.        Stendhal long since well described the process by which a defect      becomes a sexual symbol. \"Even little defects in a woman's face,\"      he remarked, \"such as a smallpox pit, may arouse the tenderness      of a man who loves her, and throw him into deep reverie when he      sees them in another woman. It is because he has experienced a      thousand feelings in the presence of that smallpox mark, that      these feelings have been for the most part delicious, all of the      highest interest, and that, whatever they may have been, they are      renewed with incredible vivacity on the sight of this sign, even      when perceived on the face of another woman. If in such a case we      come to prefer and love _ugliness_, it is only because in such a      case ugliness is beauty. A man loved a woman who was very thin      and marked by smallpox; he lost her by death. Three years later,      in Rome, he became acquainted with two women, one very beautiful,      the other thin and marked by smallpox, on that account, if you      will, rather ugly. I saw him in love with this plain one at the      end of a week, which he had employed in effacing her plainness by      his memories.\" (_De l'Amour_, Chapter XVII.)    In the tendency to idealize the unbeautiful features of a beloved person  erotic symbolism shows itself in a simple and normal form. In a less  simple and more morbid form it appears in persons in whom the normal paths  of sexual gratification are for some reasons inhibited, and who are thus  led to find the symbols of natural love in unnatural perversions. It is  for this reason that so many erotic symbolisms take root in childhood and  puberty, before the sexual instincts have reached full development. It is  for the same reason also, that, at the other end of life, when the sexual  energies are failing, erotic symbols sometimes tend to be substituted for  the normal pleasures of sex. It is for this reason, again, that both men  and women whose normal energies are inhibited sometimes find the symbols  of sexual gratification in the caresses of children.        The case of a schoolmistress recorded by Penta instructively      shows how an erotic symbolism of this last kind may develop by no      means as a refinement of vice, but as the one form in which      sexual gratification becomes possible when normal gratification      has been pathologically inhibited. F.R., aged 48, schoolmistress;      she was some years ago in an asylum with religious mania, but      came out well in a few months. At the age of 12 she had first      experienced sexual excitement in a railway train from the jolting      of the carriage. Soon after she fell in love with a youth who      represented her ideal and who returned her affection. When,      however, she gave herself to him, great was her disillusion and      surprise to find that the sexual act which she had looked forward      to could not be accomplished, for at the first contact there was      great pain and spasmodic resistance of the vagina. There was a      condition of vaginismus. After repeated attempts on subsequent      occasions her lover desisted. Her desire for intercourse      increased, however, rather than diminished, and at last she was      able to tolerate coitus, but the pain was so great that she      acquired a horror of the sexual embrace and no longer sought it.      Having much will power, she restrained all erotic impulses during      many years. It was not until the period of the menopause that the      long repressed desires broke out, and at last found a symbolical      outlet that was no longer normal, but was felt to supply a      complete gratification. She sought the close physical contact of      the young children"]]]
