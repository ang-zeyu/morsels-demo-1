But sly and spry, 'tis vain to try       To be as sly and spry as I.\"    When Peter Rabbit shouted this, Reddy looked back and showed all his  teeth, but Peter only laughed, and Reddy trotted on. Peter watched him  out of sight.    \"My! I wish I had such a handsome coat,\" he said, with a long sigh,  for you know Peter's coat is very plain, very plain, indeed.    \"You wouldn't, if you had to wear it for the same reason that Reddy  Fox has to wear his. A good heart and honest ways are better than  fine clothes, Peter Rabbit.\"    Peter looked up. There was saucy, pert, little Jenny Wren fussing  around in one of the old bramble bushes.    \"Hello, Jenny!\" said Peter. \"Why does Reddy wear a red coat?\"    \"Do you mean to say that you don't know?\" Jenny Wren looked very hard  at Peter with her sharp eyes. \"I thought everybody knew that! You  certainly are slow, Peter Rabbit. I haven't time to tell you about it  now. Go ask Grandfather Frog; he knows all about it.\" Jenny Wren  bustled off before Peter could find his tongue.    Now, you all know how full of curiosity Peter Rabbit is. Jenny Wren's  busy tongue had set that curiosity fairly boiling over. He just  couldn't sit still for wondering and wondering why Reddy Fox wears a  red coat. He had never thought anything about it before, but now he  couldn't get it out of his head. He just _had_ to know. So, making  sure that Reddy Fox had disappeared in the Green Forest, Peter started  for the Smiling Pool, lipperty-lipperty-lip, as fast as he could go.  There he found Grandfather Frog setting on his big green lily-pad,  just as usual.    \"If you please, Grandfather Frog, why does Reddy Fox wear a red coat?\"  panted Peter, quite out of breath.    \"Chug-a-rum!\" grunted Grandfather Frog crossly. \"Don't you know that  it is very impolite to disturb people when they are having a nap?\"    \"I--I'm very sorry. Indeed I am, Grandfather Frog,\" said Peter very  humbly. \"Will you tell me if I come again some time when you are not  so sleepy?\"    Now, like everybody else, Grandfather Frog is rather fond of Peter  Rabbit, and now Peter looked so truly sorry, and at the same time  there was such a look of disappointment in Peter's eyes, that  Grandfather Frog forgot all about his crossness.    \"Chug-a-rum!\" said he. \"You and your questions are a nuisance, Peter  Rabbit, and I may as well get rid of you now as to have you keep  coming down here and pestering me to death. Besides, any one who has  to keep such a sharp watch for Reddy Fox as you do ought to know why  he wears a red coat. If you'll promise to sit perfectly still and ask  no foolish questions, I'll tell you the story.\"    Of course Peter promised, and settled himself comfortably to listen.  And this is the story that Grandfather Frog told:    \"A long time ago, when the world was young, old Mr. Fox, the  grandfather a thousand times removed of Reddy Fox, was one of the  smartest of all the forest and meadow people, just as Reddy is now. He  was so smart that he knew enough not to appear smart, and the fact is  his neighbors thought him rather dull. He wore just a common, everyday  suit of dull brown, like most of the others, and there wasn't anything  about him to attract attention. He was always very polite, very polite  indeed, to every one. Yes, Sir, Mr. Fox was very polite. He always  seemed to be minding his own business, and he never went around asking  foolish questions or poking his nose into other people's affairs.\"    Grandfather Frog stopped a minute and looked very hard at Peter after  he said this, and Peter looked uncomfortable.    \"Now, although Mr. Fox didn't appear to take any interest in other  people's affairs and never asked questions, he had two of the  sharpest ears among all the little meadow and forest people, and while  he was going about seeming to be just minding his own business, he was  listening and listening to all that was said. Everything he heard he  remembered, so that it wasn't long before he knew more about what was  going on than all his neighbors together. But he kept his mouth tight  closed, did Mr. Fox, and was very humble and polite to everybody.  Every night he came home early and went to bed by sundown, and  everybody said what good habits Mr. Fox had.    \"But when everybody else was asleep, Mr. Fox used to steal out and be  gone half the night. Yes, Sir, sometimes he'd be gone until almost  morning. But he always took care to get home before any of his  neighbors were awake, and then he'd wait until everybody was up before  he showed himself. When he came out and started to hunt for his  breakfast, some one was sure to tell him of mischief done during the  darkness of the night. Sometimes it was a storehouse broken into, and  the best things taken. Sometimes it was of terrible frights that some  of the littlest people had received by being wakened in the night and  seeing a fierce face with long, sharp teeth grinning at them.  Sometimes it was of worse things that were told in whispers. Mr. Fox  used to listen as if very much shocked, and say that something ought  to be done about it, and wonder who it could be who would do such  dreadful things.    \"By and by things got so bad that they reached the ears of Old Mother  Nature, and she came to find out what it all meant. Now, the very  night before she arrived, Mrs. Quack, who lived on the river bank,  had a terrible fright. Somebody sprang upon her as she was sleeping,  and in the struggle she lost all her tail feathers. She hurried to  tell Old Mother Nature all about it, and big tears rolled down her  cheeks as she told how she had lost all her beautiful tail feathers.  Mother Nature called all the people of the forest and the meadows  together. She made them all pass before her, and she looked sharply at  each one as they went by. Mr. Fox looked meeker than ever, and he was  very humble and polite.    \"Now when Mr. Fox had paid his respects and turned his back, Old  Mother Nature saw something red on the tail of his coat. It was  nothing but a little smear of red clay, but that was enough for Old  Mother Nature. You see, she knew that Mrs. Quack's home was right at  the foot of a red claybank. She didn't say a word until everybody had  paid their respects and passed before her. Then she told them how  grieved she was to hear of all the trouble there had been, but that  she couldn't watch over each one all the time; they must learn to  watch out for themselves.    \"And so that you may know who to watch out for, from now on never  trust the one who wears a bright red coat,\" concluded Old Mother  Nature.    \"All of a sudden Mr. Fox became aware that everybody was looking at  him, and in every face was hate. He glanced at his coat. It was bright  red! Then Mr. Fox knew that he had been found out, and he sneaked away  with his tail between his legs. The first chance he got, he went to  Old Mother Nature and begged her to give him back his old coat. She  promised that she would when his heart changed, and he changed his  ways. But his heart never did change, and his children and his  children's children were just like him. They have always been the  smartest and the sliest and the most feared and disliked of all the  little people on the meadows or in the forest. And now you know why  Reddy Fox wears a red coat,\" concluded Grandfather Frog.    Peter Rabbit drew a long breath. \"Thank you, thank you, Grandfather  Frog!\" said he. \"I--I think hereafter I'll be quite content with my  own suit, even if it isn't handsome. Jenny Wren was right. A good  heart and honest ways are better than fine clothes.\"          V    WHY JIMMY SKUNK NEVER HURRIES      The Merry Little Breezes of Old Mother West Wind had just been  released from the big bag in which she carries them every night to  their home behind the Purple Hills and every morning brings them back  to the Green Meadows to romp and play all day. They romped and raced  and danced away, some one way, some another, to see whom they could  find to play with. Presently some of them spied Jimmy Skunk slowly  ambling down the Crooked Little Path, stopping every few steps to pull  over a loose stone or stick. They knew what he was doing that for.  They knew that he was looking for fat beetles for his breakfast. They  danced over to him and formed a ring around him while they sang:        \"Who is it never, never hurries?       Who is it never, never worries?       Who is it does just what he pleases,       Just like us Merry Little Breezes?         Jimmy Skunk! Jimmy Skunk!\"    Now not so far away but that he could hear them very plainly sat Peter  Rabbit, just finishing his breakfast in a sweet-clover patch. He sat  up very straight, so as to hear better. Of course some of the Merry  Little Breezes saw him right away. They left Jimmy to come over and  dance in a circle around Peter, for Peter is a great favorite with  them. And as they danced they sang:        \"Who is it hops and skips and jumps?       Who is it sometimes loudly thumps?       Who is it dearly loves to play,       But when there's danger runs away?         Peter Rabbit! Peter Rabbit!\"    Peter grinned good-naturedly. He is quite used to being laughed at for  always running away, and he doesn't mind it in the least.    \"When danger's near, who runs away will live to run another day,\"  retorted Peter promptly. Then he began the maddest kind of a frolic  with the Merry Little Breezes until they and he were quite tired out  and ready for a good rest.    \"I wish,\" said Peter, as he stretched himself out in the middle of the  patch of sweet clover, \"that you would tell me why it is that Jimmy  Skunk never hurries.\"    \"And we wish that you would tell us the same thing,\" cried one of the  Merry Little Breezes.    \"But I can't,\" protested Peter. \"Everybody else seems to hurry, at  times anyway, but Jimmy never does. He says it is a waste of energy,  whatever that means.\"    \"I tell you what--let's go over to the Smiling"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14959"],[0,"The Hymns of Prudentius (#4)"],[1,"    Blessings that His own require,    Richly lavished through their days?      When morn breaks upon our sight,      Hymns, O Lord, to Thee shall ring:    Thee, when streams the midday light,      Thee, when shadows of the night    Bid us sup, our voices sing.      For my body's vital heat,      For my heart-blood's pulsing vein,    For my tongue and speech complete      Unto Thee, Most High, 'tis meet    That I raise my grateful strain.      'Twas, O Holy One, Thy care      Wrought us from the plastic clay,    Made us Thine own image bear,      And for our perfection fair    Did Thy Breath to man convey.      On the twain Thou didst bestow      Leafy bowers in pleasaunce fair:    Where spring's scents for aye did blow,      And four stately streams did flow    O'er meads pied with blossoms rare.      \"All this realm ye now shall sway:\"      (Saidst Thou) \"use it at your will,    Yet 'tis death your hands to lay      On the Tree, whose verdant sway    Doth the midmost garden fill.\"      Then the Serpent's guileful hate      Would not innocency spare:    Bade the maiden urge her mate      With the fruit his lips to sate,    Nor 'scaped she the self-same snare.      Each their nakedness perceives      When the feast they once partook:    Smit with shame their conscience grieves:      Wove they coverings of leaves    Shielding from lascivious look.      Far they both in terror fled      Thrust from dwelling of the pure:    She who erst had dwelt unwed      Subject to her spouse was led,    Bidden Hymen's bonds endure.      On the Serpent, too, His seal      God hath set, Who guile abhorred,    Doomed in triple neck to feel      Impress of the woman's heel,    Fearing her, who feared her lord.      Thus sin in our parents sown      Brought forth ruin for the race;    Good and evil having grown      From that primal root alone,    Nought but death could guilt efface.      But the Second Man behold      Come to re-create our kin:    Not formed after common mould      But our God (O Love untold!)    Made in flesh that knows not sin.      Word of God incarnated,      By His awful power conceived,    Whom a maiden yet unwed,      Innocent of marriage-bed,    In her virgin womb received.      Now we see the Serpent lewd      'Neath the woman's heel downtrod:    Whence there sprang the deadly feud,      Strife for ages unsubdued,    'Twixt mankind and foe of God.      Yet God's mother, Maid adored,      Robbed sin's poison of its bane,    And the Snake, his green coils lowered,      Writhing on the sod, outpoured    Harmless now his venom's stain.      What fierce brute that doth not flee      Lambs of Christ, white-robed and clean?    'Midst the flock from fear set free,      Slinks the drear wolf sullenly,    Checked his maw and tamed his mien.      Wondrous change! restrained by love      Lions the mild lamb obey:    Eagles wild, before the dove      Fluttering from the stars above,    Speed o'er cloudy winds away.      Thou, O Christ, my Dove dost reign      Where the vulture gnaws no more:    Thou dost, snow-white Lamb, enchain      Tigers fierce, and wolves restrain    Gaping at the sheepfold's door.      God of Love, Thy servants we      Pray Thee now to grant our prayer    That our feast may frugal be,      Nor that we dishonour Thee    By coarse surfeit of rich fare.      May we taste no bitter gall      In our cup, nor handle we    Aught of death or harm at all,      Nor intemperately fall    Into gross debauchery.      Be the powers of Hell content      With their primal fraud, whereby    Death into this world was sent,      And that, for sin's chastisement,    God's own creatures once should die.      But in us God's Breath of fire      Cannot lose its vital force:    Never can its might expire,      Flowing from the Eternal Sire,    Who of Reason's strength is source.      Nay, from out death's chilling tomb      Mortal atoms shall arise:    Man from earth's vast, hidden womb      Other, yet the same, shall bloom,    Dust re-made in glorious guise.      'Tis my faith--and faith not vain--      Bodies live e'en as the soul:    Since I hold in memory plain      God as man uprose again,    Loosed from Hell, to His true goal.      Whence from Him the hope I reap      That these limbs the same shall rise,    Which enwrapped in balmy sleep      Christ the Risen safe shall keep    Till He call me to the skies.

HYMNUS POST CIBUM          Pastis visceribus ciboque sumpto,    quem lex corporis inbecilla poscit,    laudem lingua Deo patri rependat;      Patri, qui Cherubin sedile sacrum,    nec non et Seraphin suum supremo           5    subnixus solio tenet regitque.        Hic est, quem Sabaoth Deum vocamus,    expers principii carensque fine,    rerum conditor et repertor orbis:      fons vitae liquida fluens ab arce,      10    infusor fidei, sator pudoris,    mortis perdomitor, salutis auctor.        Omnes quod sumus aut vigemus, inde est:    regnat Spiritus ille sempiternus    a Christo simul et Parente missus.        15      Intrat pectora candidus pudica,    quae templi vice consecrata rident,    postquam conbiberint Deum medullis.        Sed si quid vitii dolive nasci    inter viscera iam dicata sensit,          20    ceu spurcum refugit celer sacellum.      Taetrum flagrat enim vapore crasso    horror conscius aestuante culpa    offensumque bonum niger repellit.        Nec solus pudor innocensve votum        25    templum constituunt perenne Christo    in cordis medii sum ac recessu:      sed ne crapula ferveat cavendum est,    quae sedem fidei cibis refertam    usque ad congeriem coartet intus.         30        Parcis victibus expedita corda    infusum melius Deum receptant.    Hic pastus animae est, saporque verus:      sed nos tu gemino fovens paratu    artus atque animas utroque pastu          35    confirmas Pater ac vigore conples.        Sic olim tua praecluens potestas    inter raucisonos situm leones,    inlapsis dapibus virum refovit.      Illum fusile numen execrantem           40    et curvare caput sub expolita    aeris materia nefas putantem        Plebs dirae Babylonis ac tyrannus    morti subdiderant, feris dicarant    saevis protinus haustibus vorandum.       45      O semper pietas fidesque tuta!    lambunt indomiti virum leones    intactumque Dei tremunt alumnum.        Adstant cominus et iubas reponunt,    mansuescit rabies fameque blanda          50    praedam rictibus ambit incruentis.      Sed cum tenderet ad superna palmas    expertumque sibi Deum rogaret,    clausus iugiter indigensque victu:        Iussus nuntius advolare terris,         55    qui pastum famulo daret probato,    raptim desilit obsequente mundo.      Cernit forte procul dapes inemptas,    quas messoribus Abbacuc propheta    agresti bonus exhibebat arte.             60        Huius caesarie manu prehensa    plenis, sicut erat, gravem canistris    suspensum rapit et vehit per auras.      Tum raptus simul ipse prandiumque    sensim labitur in lacum leonum,           65    et, quas tunc epulas gerebat, offert:        Sumas laetus, ait, libensque carpas,    quae summus Pater, angelusque Christi    mittunt liba tibi sub hoc periclo.      His sumptis Danielus excitavit          70    in caelum faciem ciboque fortis    Amen reddidit, Halleluia dixit.        Sic nos muneribus tuis refecti,    largitor Deus omnium bonorum,    grates reddimus et sacramus hymnos.       75      Tu nos tristifico velut tyranno    mundi scilicet inpotentis actu    conclusos regis et feram repellis,        Quae circumfremit ac vorare temptat    insanos acuens furore dentes,             80    cur te, summe Deus, precemur unum.      Vexamur, premimur, malis rotamur;    oderunt, lacerant, trahunt, lacessunt,    iuncta est suppliciis fides iniquis.        Nec defit tamen anxiis medela;          85    nam languente trucis leonis ira    inlapsae superingeruntur escae.      Quas si quis sitienter hauriendo    non gustu tenui, sed ore pleno    internis velit inplicare venis,           90        Hic sancto satiatus ex propheta,    iustorum capiet cibos virorum,    qui fructum domino metunt perenni.      Nil est dulcius ac magis saporum,    nil quod plus hominem iuvare possit,      95    quam vatis pia praecinentis orsa.        His sumptis licet insolens potestas    pravum iudicet, inrogetque mortem,    inpasti licet inruant leones,      nos semper Dominum patrem fatentes     100    in te, Christe Deus, loquemur unum    constanterque tuam crucem feremus.                                   IV. HYMN AFTER MEAT      Refreshed we rise, and for this bread that feeds,    By law of man's weak flesh, our daily needs,      Let every tongue, the Father's praises sing;    The Father Who on His exalted throne,    O'er Cherubim and Seraphim, alone      Reigns in His majesty, Eternal King.      God of Sabaoth is His name: 'tis He    Who ne'er began and ne'er shall cease to be,      Builder of worlds created at His word;    Fountain of Life that flows from out the sky,    He breathes within us Faith and Purity,      Great Conqueror of Death, Salvation's Lord.      From Him each creature life and vigour gains,    And over all the Eternal Spirit reigns      Who cometh from the Father and the Son:    When, dovelike, on pure hearts the heavenly Guest    Descends, they are by God's own presence blest,      As temples where His holy work is done.      But if the taint of vice or guile arise    Within the consecrated shrine, He flies      With speed from out the sin-defiled cell;    For, driven forth by guilt's black, surging tide,    The offended Godhead may not there abide      Where conscious sin and noisome foulness dwell.      Not chastity nor childlike faith alone    Build up for Christ an everlasting throne      Deep in the inmost heart, devoid of shame:    But watchful ever must His servants be,    Lest the dark power of sated gluttony      Should bind about the abode of faith its chain.
