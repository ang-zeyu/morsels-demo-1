His messages for help were either intercepted or unanswered.  The assailants broke down the last resistance. The most important  strategical point in the whole of Galicia is now in Russian hands.      TE DEUM AT HEADQUARTERS.    PETROGRAD, March 22.    _The following official communique was issued from the Main Headquarters  this morning:_    The fortress of Przemysl has surrendered to our troops.    At the Headquarters of the Commander in Chief a Te Deum of thanksgiving  was celebrated in the presence of the Czar, the Grand Duke Nicholas,  Commander in Chief, and all the staff.    _The following communique from the Great Headquarters is issued here  today:_    Northern Front.--From the Niemen to the Vistula and on the left bank of  the latter river there has been no important change. Our troops  advancing from Tauroggen captured, after a struggle, Laugszargen, (near  the frontier of East Prussia,) where they took prisoners and seized an  ammunition depot and engineers' stores.    The Carpathians.--There has been furious fighting on the roads to  Bartfeld (in Hungary) in the valleys of the Ondawa and Laborcz.    Near the Lupkow Pass and on the left bank of the Upper San our troops  have advanced successfully, forcing the way with rifle fire and with the  bayonet. In the course of the day we took 2,500 prisoners, including  fifty officers and four machine guns.    In the direction of Munkacz the Germans, in close formation, attacked  our positions at Rossokhatch, Oravtchik, and Kosziowa, but were  everywhere driven back by our fire and by our counter-attacks with  severe losses. In Galicia there has been a snowstorm.    Przemysl.--On the night of the 21st there was a fierce artillery fire  round Przemysl. Portions of the garrison who once more tried to effect a  sortie toward the northeast toward Oikowic were driven back within the  circle of forts with heavy losses.    _Note.--This portion of the communique was evidently drafted before the  fall of Przemysl took place, and the communique proceeds:_    In recognition of the joyous event of the fall of Przemysl the Czar has  conferred upon the Grand Duke Nicholas the Second Class of the Order of  St. George and the Third Class of the same order on General Ivanoff, the  commander of the besieging army.    [Illustration: Map of the Siege of Przemysl. The small triangles  indicate outlying fortified hills with their height in feet.]      COLLECTING THE ARMS.    _By Hamilton Fyfe, Correspondent of The London Daily Mail._    PETROGRAD, March 23.    Advance detachments of Russian troops entered Przemysl last night. The  business of collecting the arms is proceeding. I believe the officers  will be allowed to keep their swords.    Great surprise has been caused here by a statement that the number of  troops captured exceeds three army corps. Possibly on account of the  snowstorm no further telegram has been received from the Grand Duke  Nicholas, and no details of the fall of the garrison have yet been  officially announced. I have, however, received the definite assurance  of a very high authority that the force which has surrendered includes  nine Generals, over 2,000 officers, and 130,000 men. In spite of the  authority of my informant, I am still inclined to await confirmation of  these figures.    The leading military organ, the Russki Invalid, says that the garrison  was known to number 60,000 men and that it had been swelled to some  extent by the additional forces drafted in before the investment began.  The Retch estimates the total at 80,000, and a semi-official  announcement also places the strength of the garrison at that figure,  excluding artillery and also the men belonging to the auxiliary and  technical services.    There is an equal difference of opinion regarding the number of guns  taken. The estimates vary from 1,000 to 2,000. What is known for certain  is that the fortress contained 600 big guns of the newest type and a  number of small, older pieces.    The characteristic spirit in which Russia is waging war is shown by the  service of thanksgiving to God which was held immediately the news of  the fall of the fortress reached the Grand Duke's headquarters. The Czar  was there to join with the staff in offering humble gratitude to the  Almighty for the great victory accorded to the Russian arms.    The first crowds which gathered here yesterday to rejoice over the great  news moved with one consent to the Kazan Cathedral, where they sang the  national hymn and crossed themselves reverently before the holy,  wonder-working picture of Kazan, the Mother of God. In spite of the  heaviest snowstorm of the Winter, which made the streets impassable and  stopped the tramway cars, the Nevski Prospekt rang all the afternoon and  evening with the sound of voices raised in patriotic song.    Przemysl is admitted to be the first spectacular success of the war on  the side of the Allies. It is not surprising that the nation is proud  and delighted, yet so generous is the Russian mind that there mingle  with its triumph admiration and sympathy for the garrison which was  compelled to surrender after a long, brave resistance. Popular  imagination has been thrilled by the story of the last desperate sortie,  which will take a high place in the history of modern war.    When toward the end of the week the hope of relief, which had so long  buoyed up the defenders, was with heavy, resolved hearts abandoned,  General Kousmanek resolved to try to save at all events some portion of  his best troops by sending them to fight a way out. From the ranks,  thinned terribly by casualties and also by typhus and other diseases  caused through hunger and the unhealthy state of the town, he selected  20,000 men and served out to them five days' reduced rations, which were  all he had left. He also supplied them with new boots in order to give  them as good a chance as possible to join their comrades in the  Carpathians, whose summits could be seen from Przemysl in the shining,  warm Spring sunshine.    It was a hopeless enterprise, pitifully futile. It is true that the  Austrian armies sent to relieve the city were only a few days' march  distant, but even if the 20,000 had cut a way through the investing  force they would have found another Russian army between them and their  fellow-countrymen. General Kousmanek, before they started, addressed  them. In a rousing speech he said:         Soldiers, for nearly half a year, in spite of cold and hunger,       you have defended the fortress intrusted to you. The eyes of       the world are fixed on you. Millions at home are waiting with       painful eagerness to hear the news of your success. The honor       of the army and our fatherland requires us to make a       superhuman effort. Around us lies the iron ring of the enemy.       Burst a way through it and join your comrades who have been       fighting so bravely for you and are now so near.         I have given you the last of our supplies of food. I charge       you to go forward and sweep the foe aside. After our many       gallant and glorious fights we must not fall into the hands of       the Russians like sheep; we must and will break through.    In case this appeal to the men's fighting spirit were ineffective  threats were also used to the troops, who were warned by their officers  that any who returned to the fortress would be treated as cowards and  traitors. After the General's speech the men were told to rest for a few  hours. At 4 in the morning they paraded and at 5 the battle began. For  nine hours the Austrians hurled themselves against the iron ring, until  early in the afternoon, when, broken and battered, the remains of the  twenty thousand began to straggle back to the town. Exhausted and  disheartened, the garrison was incapable of further effort.    In order to prevent useless slaughter General Kousmanek sent officers  with a flag of truce to inquire about the terms of surrender. These were  arranged very quickly.    In spite of the local value of the victory, and the vastness of the  captures of material as well as of men, it must not be thought, as many  are inclined to think here, that the Novoe Vremya exaggerates  dangerously when it compares the effect likely to be produced with that  of the fall of Metz and Port Arthur.    It certainly brings the end of the Austrians' participation in the war  more clearly in sight. But the Austrians will fight for some time yet.  What it actually does is to free a large Russian force for the  operations against Cracow or to assist in the invasion of Hungary.    What is the strength of this force it would be imprudent to divulge, but  I can say that it certainly amounts to not less than an \"army,\"  (anything from 80,000 to 200,000 men.) Those who are anxious to arrive  at a closer figure can calculate by the fact that the Russians had a  forty-mile front around Przemysl which was strong enough to repulse  attacks at all points. Another very useful consequence is that all the  Galician railway system is now in Russian hands. It makes the transport  of troops much easier.    One further reflection was suggested to me last night by a very  distinguished and influential Russian soldier, holding office under the  Government. \"The method which prevailed at Przemysl was as follows:  Instead of rushing against the place and losing heavily, we waited and  husbanded our forces until the garrison was unable to hold out any  longer. That is the method adopted by the Allies. It must in the course  of time force Germany to surrender also.    \"Up to now we have held our own against her furious sorties. Soon we  shall begin to draw more closely our investing lines. Only one end was  possible to Przemysl. The fate of Germany is equally sure.\"    Now all eyes are fixed on the Dardanelles. The phrase on every lip is:  \"When the fall of Constantinople follows, then Prussia "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15480"],[0,"New York Times Current History; The European War, Vol 2, No. 3, June, 1915 (#4)"],[1,"to run danger from this course, whether Germany abandons her submarine  blockade or not.    It should be noted that since the employment of submarines, contrary to  international law, the Germans also have been guilty of the use of  asphyxiating gas. They have even proceeded to the poisoning of water in  South Africa.    The Germans represent British merchant vessels generally as armed with  guns and say that they repeatedly ram submarines. The answer to this is  as follows:    It is not to be wondered at that merchant vessels, knowing they are  liable to be sunk without warning and without any chance being given  those on board to save their lives, should take measures for  self-defense.    With regard to the Lusitania: The vessel was not armed on her last  voyage, and had not been armed during the whole war.    The Germans attempt to justify the sinking of the Lusitania by the fact  that she had arms and ammunition on board. The presence of contraband on  board a neutral vessel does render her liable to capture, but certainly  not to destruction, with the loss of a large portion of her crew and  passengers. Every enemy vessel is a fair prize, but there is no legal  provision, not to speak of the principles of humanity, which would  justify what can only be described as murder because a vessel carries  contraband.    The Germans maintain that after repeated official and unofficial  warnings his Majesty's Government were responsible for the loss of life,  as they considered themselves able to declare that the boat ran no risk,  and thus \"light-heartedly assume the responsibility for the human lives  on board a steamer which, owing to its armament and cargo, is liable to  destruction.\" The reply thereto is:    First--His Majesty's Government never declared the boat ran no risk.    Second--The fact that the Germans issued their warning shows that the  crime was premeditated. They had no more right to murder passengers  after warning them than before.    Third--In spite of their attempts to put the blame on Great Britain, it  will tax the ingenuity even of the Germans to explain away the fact that  it was a German torpedo, fired by a German seaman from a German  submarine, that sank the vessel and caused over 1,000 deaths.      CAPTAIN TURNER TESTIFIES.    [By The Associated Press.]    _KINSALE, Ireland, May 10.--The inquest which began here Saturday over  five victims of the Lusitania was concluded today. A vital feature of  the hearing was the testimony of Captain W.T. Turner of the lost  steamship. Coroner Horga questioned him:_    \"You were aware threats had been made that the ship would be torpedoed?\"    \"We were,\" the Captain replied.    \"Was she armed?\"    \"No, Sir.\"    \"What precautions did you take?\"    \"We had all the boats swung when we came within the danger zone, between  the passing of Fastnet and the time of the accident.\"    The Coroner asked him whether he had received a message concerning the  sinking of a ship off Kinsale by a submarine. Captain Turner replied  that he had not.    \"Did you receive any special instructions as to the voyage?\"    \"Yes, Sir.\"    \"Are you at liberty to tell us what they were?\"    \"No, Sir.\"    \"Did you carry them out?\"    \"Yes, to the best of my ability.\"    \"Tell us in your own words what happened after passing Fastnet.\"    \"The weather was clear,\" Captain Turner answered. \"We were going at a  speed of eighteen knots. I was on the port side and heard Second  Officer Hefford call out:    \"'Here's a torpedo.'    \"I ran to the other side and saw clearly the wake of a torpedo. Smoke  and steam came up between the last two funnels. There was a slight  shock. Immediately after the first explosion there was another report,  but that may possibly have been internal.    \"I at once gave the order to lower the boats down to the rails, and I  directed that women and children should get into them. I also had all  the bulkheads closed.    \"Between the time of passing Fastnet, about 11 o'clock, and of the  torpedoing I saw no sign whatever of any submarines. There was some haze  along the Irish coast, and when we were near Fastnet I slowed down to  fifteen knots. I was in wireless communication with shore all the way  across.\"    Captain Turner was asked whether he had received any messages in regard  to the presence of submarines off the Irish coast. He replied in the  affirmative. Questioned regarding the nature of the message, he replied:    \"I respectfully refer you to the Admiralty for an answer.\"    \"I also gave orders to stop the ship,\" Captain Turner continued, \"but we  could not stop. We found that the engines were out of commission. It was  not safe to lower boats until the speed was off the vessel. As a matter  of fact, there was a perceptible headway on her up to the time she went  down.    \"When she was struck she listed to starboard. I stood on the bridge when  she sank, and the Lusitania went down under me. She floated about  eighteen minutes after the torpedo struck her. My watch stopped at 2:36.  I was picked up from among the wreckage and afterward was brought aboard  a trawler.    \"No warship was convoying us. I saw no warship, and none was reported to  me as having been seen. At the time I was picked up I noticed bodies  floating on the surface, but saw no living persons.\"    \"Eighteen knots was not the normal speed of the Lusitania, was it?\"    \"At ordinary times,\" answered Captain Turner, \"she could make 25 knots,  but in war times her speed was reduced to 21 knots. My reason for going  18 knots was that I wanted to arrive at Liverpool bar without stopping,  and within two or three hours of high water.\"    \"Was there a lookout kept for submarines having regard to previous  warnings?\"    \"Yes, we had double lookouts.\"    \"Were you going a zigzag course at the moment the torpedoing took  place?\"    \"No. It was bright weather, and land was clearly visible.\"    \"Was it possible for a submarine to approach without being seen?\"    \"Oh, yes; quite possible.\"    \"Something has been said regarding the impossibility of launching the  boats on the port side?\"    \"Yes,\" said Captain Turner, \"owing to the listing of the ship.\"    \"How many boats were launched safely?\"    \"I cannot say.\"    \"Were any launched safely?\"    \"Yes, and one or two on the port side.\"    \"Were your orders promptly carried out?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Was there any panic on board?\"    \"No, there was no panic at all. It was all most calm.\"    \"How many persons were on board?\"    \"There were 1,500 passengers and about 600 crew.\"    By the foreman of the jury--In the face of the warnings at New York that  the Lusitania would be torpedoed, did you make any application to the  Admiralty for an escort?    \"No, I left that to them. It is their business, not mine. I simply had  to carry out my orders to go, and I would do it again.\"    Captain Turner uttered the last words of this reply with great emphasis.    By the Coroner--I am very glad to hear you say so, Captain.    By a juryman--Did you get a wireless to steer your vessel in a northern  direction?    \"No,\" replied Captain Turner.    \"Was the course of the vessel altered after the torpedoes struck her?\"    \"I headed straight for land, but it was useless. Previous to this the  watertight bulkheads were closed. I suppose the explosion forced them  open. I don't know the exact extent to which the Lusitania was damaged.\"    \"There must have been serious damage done to the watertight bulkheads?\"    \"There certainly was, without doubt.\"    \"Were the passengers supplied with lifebelts?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Were any special orders given that morning that lifebelts be put on?\"    \"No.\"    \"Was any warning given before you were torpedoed?\"    \"None whatever. It was suddenly done and finished.\"    \"If there had been a patrol boat about might it have been of  assistance?\"    \"It might, but it is one of those things one never knows.\"    With regard to the threats against his ship Captain Turner said he saw  nothing except what appeared in the New York papers the day before the  Lusitania sailed. He had never heard the passengers talking about the  threats, he said.    \"Was a warning given to the lower decks after the ship had been struck?\"  Captain Turner was asked.    \"All the passengers must have heard the explosion,\" Captain Turner  replied.    Captain Turner, in answer to another question, said he received no  report from the lookout before the torpedo struck the Lusitania.    Ship's Bugler Livermore testified that the watertight compartments were  closed, but that the explosion and the force of the water must have  burst them open. He said that all the officers were at their posts and  that earlier arrivals of the rescue craft would not have saved the  situation.    After physicians had testified that the victims had met death through  prolonged immersion and exhaustion the Coroner summed up the case.    He said that the first torpedo fired by the German submarine did serious  damage to the Lusitania, but that, not satisfied with this, the  Germans had discharged another torpedo. The second torpedo, he said,  must have been more deadly, because it went right through the ship,  hastening the work of destruction.
