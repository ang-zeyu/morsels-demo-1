The matter of the Church invisible are only true believers, but of      the Church visible persons professing true faith in Christ, and      obedience to him according to the rules of the Gospel.        Parochial churches are received as true visible churches of Christ,      and most convenient for mutual edification. Gathering churches out      of churches, hath no footsteps in Scripture; is contrary to      apostolical practice; is the scattering of churches, the daughter of      schism, the mother of confusion, but the stepmother to edification.        Preaching elders are both elected and ordained.        Ruling elders only rule, preach not, 1 Tim. v. 17.        The subject of church government is only Christ's own church      officers.        The church governors act immediately as the servants of Christ, and      as appointed by him.        All censures and acts of government are dispensed in congregational      presbyteries subordinately, dependently, with liberty of appeal in      all cases to presbyterial or synodal assemblies; where parties      grieved have sufficient remedy.        There are acknowledged, and with happy success used, not only      suasive and consultative; but also authoritative classes and synods,      in cases of great importance, difficulty, common concernment, or      appeals; which have power to dispense all church censures, as need      shall require.    Let these and such like particulars in the independent way, differing  from the presbyterial, be duly pondered, and then let the impartial and  indifferent reader judge, whether they be not the deformities, at least  the infirmities of that way.    III. How many true excellences are there in the way of the presbyterial  government, wherein it utterly surpasses the independent government!  Read but the particulars of the former parallel in the presbyterial  government, and then consider how far this transcends, yea, how the  independent government is indeed no government at all, to the  presbyterial government; wherein is to be found such ample provision,  and that according to the word of God, for comely order against  confusion; for peace and unity of the Church against schism and  division; for truth of the faith against all error and heresy; for piety  and unblamableness against all impiety and scandal of conversation; for  equity and right against all mal-administrations, whether ignorant,  arbitrary, or tyrannical; for the honor and purity of all Christ's  ordinances against all contempt, pollution, and profanation; for  comfort, quickening, and encouragement of the saints in all the ways of  Christ; and consequently for the honor of God and our Lord Jesus Christ  in all the mysterious services of his spiritual sanctuary: all which  rich advantages, how impossible is it they should ever be found in the  independent government so long as it continues independent? And what  though some pious minister and people embrace the independent way! This  dazzles not the eyes of the intelligent, but of the infirm; we are to be  regulated by Scripture warrant, not by human examples. The best of  saints have failed in the ecclesiastical affairs; what a sharp  contention was there between Paul and Barnabas, Acts xv. 39, &c.; what a  dangerous dissimulation was there in Peter, the Jews, and Barnabas! Gal.  ii. 11, 12, 13, &c.; and, therefore, it is not safe, prudent, or  conscientious, to imitate all the examples of the best, and yet how few  are those that have engaged themselves in the independent way, in  comparison to the multitude of precious ministers and people, inferior  to them neither in parts, learning, piety, nor any other spiritual gift,  who are for the presbyterial way of church government! Notwithstanding,  let all the true Israel of God constantly follow, not the doubtful  practices of unglorified saints, but the written pleasure of the most  glorious King of saints; and as many as walk according to this rule,  peace shall be on them, and upon the Israel of God.          THE DIVINE RIGHT OF CHURCH GOVERNMENT.    PART I.    OF THE NATURE OF A DIVINE RIGHT: AND HOW MANY WAYS A THING MAY BE OF  DIVINE RIGHT.          CHAPTER I.    _That there is a Government in the Church of_ DIVINE RIGHT _now under  the New Testament._      Jesus Christ our Mediator hath _the government_ (both of the Church, and  of all things for the Church) laid _upon his shoulder_, Isa. ix. 6, and  to that end hath _all power in heaven and earth given to him_, Matth.  xxviii. 18, John v. 22, Ephes. i. 22. But lapsed man (being full of  pride, Psal. x. 2, 4, and enmity against the law of God, Rom. viii. 7)  is most impatient of all government of God and of Christ, Ps. ii. 1, 2,  3, with Luke xix. 14, 27; whence it comes to pass, that the _governing_  and _kingly power_ of Christ hath been opposed in all ages, and  especially in this of ours, by quarrelsome queries, wrangling disputes,  plausible pretences, subtle policies, strong self-interests, and mere  violent wilfulness of many in England, even after they are brought under  the _oath of God to reform church government according to the word of  God_. Yet it will be easily granted _that there should be a government  in the Church of God_, otherwise the Church would become a mere _Babel_  and _chaos_ of confusion, and be in a far worse condition than all human  societies in the whole world: and _that some one church government is  much to be preferred before another, yea, before all other_; as being  most desirable in itself, and most suitable to this state; otherwise,  why is the _Prelatical_ government rejected, that another and a better  may be erected instead thereof? But the pinch lies in this, _Whether  there be any government in the Church visible of divine right?_ And, if  so, _which of those church governments_ (which lay claim to a divine  right for their foundation) _may be most clearly evinced by the  Scriptures to be of_ divine right _indeed?_ If the former be  convincingly affirmed, the fancy of the _Erastians_ and _semi-Erastians_  of these things will vanish, that deny all government to the Church  distinct from that of the civil magistrate. If the latter be solidly  proved by Scripture, it will appear, whether the _monarchical  government_ of the pope and prelates; or the _mere democratical  government_ of all the people in an equal level of authority, as among  the Brownists; or the _mixed democratical government_ of both elders and  people within their own single congregation only, without all  subordination of Assemblies, and benefit of appeals, as among the  Independents; or rather the _pure representative government_ of the  presbytery or church rulers only, chosen by the people, in subordination  to superior synodical assemblies, and with appeals thereto, as it is  among the Presbyterians, be that peculiar government which Jesus Christ  hath left unto his church, by divine right, and in comparison of which  all others are to be rejected.    To draw things therefore to a clear and speedy issue about the divine  right of church government, let this general proposition be laid down--    _The Scriptures declare, That there is a government of_ DIVINE RIGHT _in  the visible Church of Christ now under the New Testament._    This is evident, 1 Cor. xii. 28, _God hath set some in the Church,  first, Apostles, secondly, Prophets, thirdly, Teachers--Helps,  Governments;_ in which place these things are plain: 1. That here the  Apostle speaks of the visible Church: for he had formerly spoken of  visible gifts and _manifestations of the Spirit given to profit this_  Church _withal_, ver. 7 to 12. He also compares this Church of God to a  visible organical body, consisting of many visible members, ver. 12, 13,  &c. And in this 28th verse he enumerates the visible officers of this  Church. 2. That here the Apostle speaks of one general visible Church;  for he saith not _churches_, but _church_, in the singular number, that  is, of one; besides, he speaks here of the Church in such a latitude as  to comprehend in itself all gifts of the Spirit, all members, and all  officers, both extraordinary and ordinary, which cannot be meant of the  church of Corinth, or any one particular church, but only of that one  general Church on earth. 3. That this general visible Church here meant,  is the Church of Christ now under the New Testament, and not under the  Old Testament; for he mentions here the New Testament officers only,  ver. 28. 4. That in the visible Church now under the New Testament,  there is a government settled; for besides _Apostles, Prophets_, and  _Teachers_, here is mention of another sort of officer distinct from  them all, called, in the abstract, _Governments_, a metaphor from  pilots, mariners, or shipmasters, who by their helm, card, or compass,  cables, and other tacklings, guide, and order, turn and twine the ship  as necessity shall require; so these officers called _Governments_, have  a power of governing and steering the spiritual vessel of the Church;  thus, Beza on this place, says he declares the order of Presbyters, _who  are keepers of discipline and church polity_. For how improperly should  these, or any officers be styled _Governments in the Church_, if they  had not a power of government in the Church settled upon them? Nor can  this be interpreted of the civil magistrate; for, when the Apostle wrote  this, the Church had her government, when yet she had no civil  magistrate to protect her; and when did God ever take this power"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13944"],[0,"After London; Or, Wild England (#4)"],[1," which I  could attain after comparing the various traditions. Some say, then,  that the first beginning of the change was because the sea silted up the  entrances to the ancient ports, and stopped the vast commerce which was  once carried on. It is certainly true that many of the ports are silted  up, and are now useless as such, but whether the silting up preceded the  disappearance of the population, or whether the disappearance of the  population, and the consequent neglect caused the silting, I cannot  venture to positively assert.    For there are signs that the level of the sea has sunk in some places,  and signs that it has become higher in others, so that the judicious  historian will simply state the facts, and refrain from colouring them  with his own theory as Silvester has done. Others again maintain that  the supply of food from over the ocean suddenly stopping caused great  disorders, and that the people crowded on board all the ships to escape  starvation, and sailed away, and were no more heard of.    It has, too, been said that the earth, from some attractive power  exercised by the passage of an enormous dark body through space, became  tilted or inclined to its orbit more than before, and that this, while  it lasted, altered the flow of the magnetic currents, which, in an  imperceptible manner, influence the minds of men. Hitherto the stream of  human life had directed itself to the westward, but when this reversal  of magnetism occurred, a general desire arose to return to the east. And  those whose business is theology have pointed out that the wickedness of  those times surpassed understanding, and that a change and sweeping away  of the human evil that had accumulated was necessary, and was effected  by supernatural means. The relation of this must be left to them, since  it is not the province of the philosopher to meddle with such matters.    All that seems certain is, that when the event took place, the immense  crowds collected in cities were most affected, and that the richer and  upper classes made use of their money to escape. Those left behind were  mainly the lower and most ignorant, so far as the arts were concerned;  those that dwelt in distant and outlying places; and those who lived by  agriculture. These last at that date had fallen to such distress that  they could not hire vessels to transport themselves. The exact number of  those left behind cannot, of course, be told, but it is on record that  when the fields were first neglected (as I have already described), a  man might ride a hundred miles and not meet another. They were not only  few, but scattered, and had not drawn together and formed towns as at  present.    Of what became of the vast multitudes that left the country, nothing has  ever been heard, and no communication has been received from them. For  this reason I cannot conceal my opinion that they must have sailed  either to the westward or to the southward where the greatest extent of  ocean is understood to exist, and not to the eastward as Silvester would  have it in his work upon the \"Unknown Orb\", the dark body travelling in  space to which I have alluded. None of our vessels in the present day  dare venture into those immense tracts of sea, nor, indeed, out of sight  of land, unless they know they shall see it again so soon as they have  reached and surmounted the ridge of the horizon. Had they only crossed  to the mainland or continent again, we should most likely have heard of  their passage across the countries there.    It is true that ships rarely come over, and only to two ports, and that  the men on them say (so far as can be understood) that their country is  equally deserted now, and has likewise lost its population. But still,  as men talk unto men, and we pass intelligence across great breadths of  land, it is almost certain that, had they travelled that way, some echo  of their footsteps would yet sound back to us. Regarding this theory,  therefore, as untenable, I put forward as a suggestion that the ancients  really sailed to the west or to the south.    As, for the most part, those who were left behind were ignorant, rude,  and unlettered, it consequently happened that many of the marvellous  things which the ancients did, and the secrets of their science, are  known to us by name only, and, indeed, hardly by name. It has happened  to us in our turn as it happened to the ancients. For they were aware  that in times before their own the art of making glass malleable had  been discovered, so that it could be beaten into shape like copper. But  the manner in which it was accomplished was entirely unknown to them;  the fact was on record, but the cause lost. So now we know that those  who to us are the ancients had a way of making diamonds and precious  stones out of black and lustreless charcoal, a fact which approaches the  incredible. Still, we do not doubt it, though we cannot imagine by what  means it was carried out.    They also sent intelligence to the utmost parts of the earth along wires  which were not tubular, but solid, and therefore could not transmit  sound, and yet the person who received the message could hear and  recognise the voice of the sender a thousand miles away. With certain  machines worked by fire, they traversed the land swift as the swallow  glides through the sky, but of these things not a relic remains to us.  What metal-work or wheels or bars of iron were left, and might have  given us a clue, were all broken up and melted down for use in other  ways when metal became scarce.    Mounds of earth are said to still exist in the woods, which originally  formed the roads for these machines, but they are now so low, and so  covered with thickets, that nothing can be learnt from them; and,  indeed, though I have heard of their existence, I have never seen one.  Great holes were made through the very hills for the passage of the iron  chariot, but they are now blocked by the falling roofs, nor dare any one  explore such parts as may yet be open. Where are the wonderful  structures with which the men of those days were lifted to the skies,  rising above the clouds? These marvellous things are to us little more  than fables of the giants and of the old gods that walked upon the  earth, which were fables even to those whom we call the ancients.    Indeed, we have fuller knowledge of those extremely ancient times than  of the people who immediately preceded us, and the Romans and the Greeks  are more familiar to us than the men who rode in the iron chariots and  mounted to the skies. The reason why so many arts and sciences were lost  was because, as I have previously said, the most of those who were left  in the country were ignorant, rude, and unlettered. They had seen the  iron chariots, but did not understand the method of their construction,  and could not hand down the knowledge they did not themselves possess.  The magic wires of intelligence passed through their villages, but they  did not know how to work them.    The cunning artificers of the cities all departed, and everything fell  quickly into barbarism; nor could it be wondered at, for the few and  scattered people of those days had enough to do to preserve their lives.  Communication between one place and another was absolutely cut off, and  if one perchance did recollect something that might have been of use, he  could not confer with another who knew the other part, and thus between  them reconstruct the machine. In the second generation even these  disjointed memories died out.    At first it is supposed that those who remained behind existed upon the  grain in the warehouses, and what they could thresh by the flail from  the crops left neglected in the fields. But as the provisions in the  warehouses were consumed or spoiled, they hunted the animals, lately  tame and as yet but half wild. As these grew less in number and  difficult to overtake, they set to work again to till the ground, and  cleared away small portions of the earth, encumbered already with  brambles and thistles. Some grew corn, and some took charge of sheep.  Thus, in time, places far apart from each other were settled, and towns  were built; towns, indeed, we call them to distinguish them from the  champaign, but they are not worthy of the name in comparison with the  mighty cities of old time.    There are many that have not more than fifty houses in the enclosure,  and perhaps no other station within a day's journey, and the largest are  but villages, reckoning by antiquity. For the most part they have their  own government, or had till recently, and thus there grew up many  provinces and kingdoms in the compass of what was originally but one.  Thus separated and divided, there came also to be many races where in  the first place was one people. Now, in briefly recounting the principal  divisions of men, I will commence with those who are everywhere  considered the lowest. These are the Bushmen, who live wholly in the  woods.    Even among the ancients, when every man, woman, and child could exercise  those arts which are now the special mark of nobility, _i.e._ reading  and writing, there was a degraded class of persons who refused to avail  themselves of the benefits of civilization. They obtained their food by  begging, wandering along the highways, crouching around fires which they  lit in the open, clad in rags, and exhibiting countenances from which  every trace of self-respect had disappeared. These were the ancestors of  the present men of the bushes.    They took naturally to the neglected fields, and forming \"camps\" as they  call their tribes, or rather families, wandered to and fro, easily  subsisting upon roots and trapped game. So they live to this day, having  become extremely dexterous in snaring every species of bird and animal,  and the fishes of the streams. These latter they sometimes poison with a  drug or a plant (it is not known which), the knowledge of"]]]
