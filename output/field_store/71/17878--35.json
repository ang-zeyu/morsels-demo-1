The  universe [Page 18] has bones, flesh, beauty, soul, and all is one.  It can be understood only by a study of all its parts, and by  tracing effect to cause.    But how can condensation cause light? Power cannot be quiet. The  mighty locomotive trembles with its own energy. A smitten piece  of iron has all its infinitesimal atoms set in vehement commotion;  they surge back and forth among themselves, like the waves of a  storm-blown lake. Heat is a mode of motion. A heated body commences  a vigorous vibration among its particles, and communicates these  vibrations to the surrounding air and ether. When these vibrations  reach 396,000,000,000,000 per second, the human eye, fitted to be  affected by that number, discerns the emitted undulations, and the  object seems to glow with a dull red light; becoming hotter, the  vibrations increase in rapidity. When they reach 765,000,000,000,000  per second the color becomes violet, and the eye can observe them no  farther. Between these numbers are those of different rapidities,  which affect the eye--as orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, in an  almost infinite number of shades--according to the sensitiveness  of the eye.    We now see how our dark immensity of attractive atoms can become  luminous. A force of compression results in vibrations within,  communicated to the ether, discerned by the eye. Illustrations are  numerous. If we suddenly push a piston into a cylinder of brass,  the force produces heat enough to set fire to an inflammable substance  within. Strike a half-inch cube of iron a moderate blow and it becomes  warm; a sufficient blow, and its vibrations become quick enough to  be seen--it is red-hot. Attach a thermometer to an extended [Page  19] arm of a whirling wheel; drive it against the air five hundred  feet per second, the mercury rises 16 deg.. The earth goes 98,000 feet  per second, or one thousand miles a minute. If it come to an  aerolite or mass of metallic rock, or even a cloudlet of gas,  standing still in space, its contact with our air evolves 600,000 deg.  of heat. And when the meteor comes toward the world twenty-six miles  a second, the heat would become proportionally greater if the meteor  could abide it, and not be consumed in fervent heat. It vanishes  almost as soon as seen. If there were meteoric masses enough lying  in our path, our sky would blaze with myriads of flashes of light.  Enough have been seen to enable a person to read by them at night.  If a sufficient number were present, we should miss their individual  flashes as they blend their separate fires in one sea of  insufferable glory. The sun is 1,300,000 times as large as our  planet; its attraction proportionally greater; the aerolites more  numerous; and hence an infinite hail of stones, small masses and  little worlds, makes ceaseless trails of light, whose individuality  is lost in one dazzling sea of glory.    On the 1st day of September, 1859, two astronomers, independently  of each other, saw a sudden brightening on the surface of the sun.  Probably two large meteoric masses were travelling side by side  at two or three hundred miles per second, and striking the sun's  atmosphere, suddenly blazed into light bright enough to be seen  on the intolerable light of the photosphere as a background. The  earth responded to this new cause of brilliance and heat in the  sun. Vivid auroras appeared, not only at the north and south poles,  but even where such spectacles are seldom seen. The electro-magnetic  [Page 20] disturbances were more distinctly marked. \"In many places  the telegraphic wires struck work. In Washington and Philadelphia  the electric signalmen received severe electric shocks; at a station  in Norway the telegraphic apparatus was set fire to; and at Boston a  flame of fire followed the pen of Bain's electric telegraph.\" There  is the best of reason for believing that a continuous succession of  such bodies might have gone far toward rendering the earth  uncomfortable as a place of residence.    Of course, the same result of heat and light would follow from  compression, if a body had the power of contraction in itself. We  endowed every particle of our gas, myriads of miles in extent, with an  attraction for every other particle. It immediately compressed itself  into a light-giving body, which flamed out through the interstellar  spaces, flushing all the celestial regions with exuberant light.    But heat exerts a repellent force among particles, and soon an  equilibrium is reached, for there comes a time when the contracting  body can contract no farther. But heat and light radiate away into  cold space, then contraction goes on evolving more light, and so  the suns flame on through the millions of years unquenched. It is  estimated that the contraction of our sun, from filling immensity  of space to its present size, could not afford heat enough to last  more than 18,000,000 years, and that its contraction from its present  density (that of a swamp) to such rock as that of which our earth  is composed, could supply heat enough for 17,000,000 years longer.  But the far-seeing mind of man knows a time must come when the  present force of attraction [Page 21] shall have produced all the  heat it can, and a new force of attraction must be added, or the sun  itself will become cold as a cinder, dead as a burned-out char.    Since light and heat are the product of such enormous cosmic forces,  they must partake of their nature, and be force. So they are. The  sun has long arms, and they are full of unconquerable strength  ninety-two millions, or any other number of millions, of miles  away. All this light and heat comes through space that is 200 deg.  below zero, through utter darkness, and appears only on the earth.  So the gas is darkness in the underground pipes, but light at the  burner. So the electric power is unfelt by the cable in the bosom  of the deep, but is expressive of thought and feeling at the end.  Having found the cause of light, we will commence a study of its  qualities and powers.    Light is the astronomer's necessity. When the sublime word was  uttered, \"Let there be light!\" the study of astronomy was made  possible. Man can gather but little of it with his eye; so he takes  a lens twenty-six inches in diameter, and bends all the light that  passes through it to a focus, then magnifies the image and takes  it into his eye. Or he takes a mirror, six feet in diameter, so  hollowed in the middle as to reflect all the rays falling upon it  to one point, and makes this larger eye fill his own with light.  By this larger light-gathering he discerns things for which the  light falling on his pupil one-fifth of an inch in diameter would  not be sufficient. We never have seen any sun or stars; we have  only seen the light that left them fifty minutes or years ago, more  or less. Light is the aerial sprite that carries our measuring-rods  across the infinite [Page 22] spaces; light spreads out the history  of that far-off beginning; brings us the measure of stars a thousand  times brighter than our sun; takes up into itself evidences of the  very constitutional elements of the far-off suns, and spreads them  at our feet. It is of such capacity that the Divine nature, looking  for an expression of its own omnipotence, omniscience, and power of  revelation, was content to say, \"God is Light.\" We shall need all  our delicacy of analysis and measurement when we seek to determine  the activities of matter so fine and near to spirit as light.    [Illustration: Fig. 4.--Velocity of Light measured by Eclipses of  Jupiter's Moons.]    We first seek the velocity of light. In Fig. 4 the earth is 92,500,000  miles from the sun at E; Jupiter is 480,000,000 miles from the sun  at J. It has four moons: the inner one goes around the central  body in forty-two hours, and is eclipsed at every revolution. The  light that went out from the sun to M ceases to be reflected back  to the earth by the intervention of the planet Jupiter. We know  to a second when these eclipses take place, and they can be seen  with a small telescope. But when the earth is on the opposite side  of the sun [Page 23] from Jupiter, at E', these eclipses at J' take  place sixteen and a half minutes too late. What is the reason? Is  the celestial chronometry getting deranged? No, indeed; these great  worlds swing never an inch out of place, nor a second out of time.  By going to the other side of the sun the earth is 184,000,000 miles  farther from Jupiter, and the light that brings the intelligence of  that eclipse consumes the extra time in going over the extra  distance. Divide one by the other and we get the velocity, 185,000  miles per second. That is probably correct to within a thousand  miles. Methods of measurement by the toothed wheel of Fizeau confirm  this result. Suppose the wheel, Fig. 5, to have one thousand teeth,  making five revolutions to the second. Five thousand flashes of  light each second will dart out. Let each flash travel nine miles to  a mirror and return. If it goes that distance in 1/10000 of a  second, or at the rate of 180,000 miles a second, the next tooth  will have arrived before the eye, and each returning ray be cut off.  Hasten the revolutions a little, and the next notch will then admit  the ray, on its return, that went out of each previous notch: the  eighteen miles having been traversed meanwhile. The method of  measuring by means of a revolving mirror, used by Faucault, is held  to be even more accurate.    [Illustration: Fig. 5.--Measuring the Velocity of Light.]    When we take instantaneous photographs by the exposure [Page 24] of  the sensitive plate 1/20000 part of a second, a stream of light nine  miles long dashes in upon the plate in that very brief period of  time.    The highest velocity we can give a rifle-ball is 2000 feet a second,  the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15622"],[0,"Handbook on Japanning: 2nd Edition (#4)"],[1,"way to the whiter resins; but where  hardness and tenacity are essential it must be adhered to, and where  both are necessary a mixed varnish must be used. This mixed varnish  should be made from the picked seed-lac as directed in the case of the  white japan grounds. The common seed-lac varnish may be made thus:  Take 1-1/2 lb. of seed-lac and wash it well in several waters, then  dry it and powder it coarsely and put it with a gallon of methylated  spirits into a Bohemian glass flask so that it be not more than  two-thirds full. Shake the mixture well together and place the flask  in a gentle heat till the seed-lac appears to be dissolved, the  shaking being in the meantime repeated as often as may be convenient;  then pour off all the clear and strain the remainder through a coarse  cloth. The varnish so prepared must be kept for use in a well-corked  glass vessel. The whiter seed-lac varnishes are used in the same  manner as the common, except as regards the substances used in  polishing, which, where a pure white or the greater clearness or  purity of other pigments is in question, should be itself white, while  the browner sorts of polishing dust, as being cheaper and doing their  business with greater dispatch, may be used in other cases. The pieces  of work to be varnished should be placed near the fire or in a warm  room and made perfectly dry, and then the varnish may be applied with  a flat camel-hair brush made for the purpose. This must be done very  rapidly, but with great care; the same place should not be passed  twice over in laying on one coat if it can possibly be avoided. The  best way of proceeding is to begin in the middle and pass the brush to  one end, then with another stroke from the middle pass it to the other  end, taking care that before each stroke the brush be well supplied  with varnish; when one coat is dry another must be laid over it in  like manner, and this must be continued five or six times. If on trial  there be not a sufficient thickness of varnish to bear the polish  without laying bare the painting or ground colour underneath more  varnish must be applied. When a sufficient number of coats of varnish  is so applied the work is fit to be polished, which must be done in  common work by rubbing it with a piece of cloth or felt dipped in  tripoli or finely ground pumice-stone. But towards the end of the  rubbing a little oil of any kind must be used with the powder, and  when the work appears sufficiently bright and glossy it should be  well rubbed with the oil alone to clean it from the powder and to give  it a still greater lustre. In the case of white grounds, instead of  the tripoli, fine putty or whiting should be used, but they should be  washed over to prevent the danger of damaging the work from any sand  or any other gritty matter that may happen to be mixed with them. It  greatly improves all kinds of japan work to harden the varnish by  means of heat, which, in every degree that can be applied short of  what would burn or calcine the matter, tends to give it a firm and  strong texture where metals form the body; therefore a very hot stove  may be used, and the stoving may be continued for a considerable time,  especially if the heat be gradually increased. But where wood or  papier-mache is in question, heat must be applied with great caution.          SECTION III.    JAPANNING OR ENAMELLING METALS.      In japanning metals, all good work of which should be stoved, they  have to be first thoroughly cleaned, and then the japan ground applied  with a badger or camel-hair brush or other means, very carefully and  evenly. Metals usually require from three to five coats, and between  each application must be dried in an oven heated from 250 deg. to 300 deg.  F.--about 270 deg. being the average. It has already been seen that the  best grounds for japanning are formed of shellac varnish, the  necessary pigments for colouring being added thereto, being mixed with  the shellac varnish after they have been ground into a high degree of  smoothness and fineness in spirits of turpentine. In japanning it is  best to have the oven at rather a lower temperature, increasing the  heat after the work has been placed in the oven. When a sufficient  number of coats have been laid on--which will usually be two only--the  work must be polished by means of a piece of cloth or felt dipped in  tripoli or finely powdered pumice-stone. For white grounds fine putty  powder or whiting must be employed, a final coat being afterwards  given, and the work stoved again. The last coat of all is one of  varnish. And here, as a preliminary remark, it is advisable that all  enamels and japans should be purchased ready-made, as any attempt to  make such is almost sure to end in disaster, while, owing to the fact  that such are only required for small jobs; it would involve too much  trouble and would not pay. It is for this reason that few japan  recipes are given, as, although many are available, they do not always  turn out as suitable for the purpose as could be desired, in addition  to which the ready-made articles can be purchased at a very reasonable  price and are much better prepared. The operator should procure his  enamels a shade or two lighter than he desires to see in the finished  article, allowing the chemical action due to the stoving to tone the  colours down. Another necessity is to keep the enamel thoroughly well  mixed by well stirring it every time it is used, as if this is not  done the actual colouring matter is apt to sink to the bottom, the  ultimate result being that streaky work is produced in consequence of  this indifferent mixing of the enamelling materials.    It is hardly necessary to state that all japanning or enamelling work  must be done in a room or shop absolutely free from dust or dirt, and  as far away as possible from any window or other opening leading to  the open air, for two reasons--one being that the draught therefrom  may cool the oven or stove, and the other that the air may convey  particles of dust into the enamelling shop. In fact, it cannot be too  much impressed upon the workmen that one of the primary secrets of  successful enamelling is absolute cleanliness; consequently all  precautions must be taken to ensure that the enamel is perfectly free  from grit and dust, and it must be so kept by frequent straining  through fine muslin, flannel, or similar material. The work having  been thoroughly cleaned and freed from all grease and other foreign  matter, it must be suspended or held immediately over the pan  elsewhere referred to, and the enamel poured on with an ordinary iron  ladle, or covered by means of the brush. When it has been permitted to  drain thoroughly, the work should be hung on the hooks on the rods in  the oven as seen in the explanatory sketch, care being observed that  no portion of the work is in such a position that any superfluous  enamel cannot easily drain off--in other words, the work must lie or  hang that it is always, as it were, on the slant. Always bear in mind  when shutting the oven door to do so gently, as if a slam is indulged  in all the gas jets will be blown out, and an explosion would probably  result.    Should the job in hand be a large one, it will be found as well to get  a cheaper enamel for the first coat, but if the work is only a small  job, it will not be necessary to have more than one enamel, of which a  couple of coats at least will be required. When the first coat has  thoroughly dried and hardened, the surface will have to be thoroughly  rubbed till it is perfectly smooth with tripoli powder and fine  pumice-stone, and afterwards hand-polished with rotten-stone and putty  powder. And here it may be remarked that the finer the surface is got  up with emery powder and other polishing agents the better will be the  enamelling and ultimate finish. The rubbing down being finished,  another coat of enamel must be applied and the work baked as before,  care being always taken to keep the enamel in a sufficiently fluid  condition as to enable it to flow and run off the work freely. It can  easily be thinned with a little paraffin. A third coat will frequently  be advisable, as it improves the finish.    In enamelling cycles, it is well to hang the front forks crown  uppermost when they are undergoing the final baking, and it is  advisable to bear in mind that wheels require an enamel that will  stove at a lower temperature than is called for for other parts of the  machine. Some japanners advocate the fluid being put on with camel-or  badger-hair brushes, and for the best descriptions of work, final  coats, and such like, I agree with them; but this is a detail which  can be left to the operator's own fancy, the class of work, etc.; but  I would remind him that applying enamel with a brush requires much  care and a certain amount of \"knack\". It is something like successful  lacquering in brasswork--it looks very simple, but is not. Each  succeeding coat of japan gives a more uniform and glossy surface, and  for this reason it may, in some cases, be necessary to repeat the  operation no fewer than half a dozen times, the final coat being  generally a layer of clear varnish only, to add to the lustre.    Care must be taken for light-coloured japans or enamels not to have  the temperature sufficiently high to scorch, or the surface will be  discoloured, as they require a lower temperature for fixing than the  dark japans, which, provided the article is not likely to be injured  by the heat, are usually dried at a somewhat high temperature. The  preceding instructions apply only to the best descriptions of work.    When pouring enamel by means of the ladle over pieces of work, do not  agitate the liquid too much--at the same time taking care to keep it  well mixed--so as to form air bubbles, as this will cause trouble, and  in pouring over the work do it with an easy and gentle and not too  hurried a"]]]
