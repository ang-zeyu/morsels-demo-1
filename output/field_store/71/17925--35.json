As Egyptians, they  built the Pyramids, and reared enormous monoliths, which remain as  perfect now as they were when first completed, thirty centuries ago.  As Ph[oe]nicians, they constructed ships, perfected navigation, and  explored, without compass or chart, every known sea. As Greeks, they  modeled architectural embellishments, and cut sculptures in marble,  and wrote poems and history, which have been ever since the admiration  of the world. As Romans, they carried a complete and perfect military  organization over fifty nations and a hundred millions of people, with  one supreme mistress over all, the ruins of whose splendid palaces and  monuments have not yet passed away. Thus has this race gone on, always  distinguishing itself, by energy, activity, and intellectual power,  wherever it has dwelt, whatever language it has spoken, and in  whatever period of the world it has lived. It has invented printing,  and filled every country that it occupies with permanent records of  the past, accessible to all. It has explored the heavens, and reduced  to precise and exact calculations all the complicated motions there.  It has ransacked the earth, systematized, arranged, and classified the  vast melange of plants, and animals, and mineral products to be found  upon its surface. It makes steam and falling water do more than half  the work necessary for feeding and clothing the human race; and the  howling winds of the ocean, the very emblems of resistless destruction  and terror, it steadily employs in interchanging the products of the  world, and bearing the means of comfort and plenty to every clime.    The Caucasian race has thus, in all ages, and in all the varieties  of condition in which the different branches of it have been placed,  evinced the same great characteristics, marking the existence of  some innate and constant constitutional superiority; and yet, in the  different branches, subordinate differences appear, which are to be  accounted for, perhaps, partly by difference of circumstances, and  partly, perhaps, by similar constitutional diversities--diversities by  which one branch is distinguished from other branches, as the whole  race is from the other races with which we have compared them. Among  these branches, we, Anglo-Saxons ourselves, claim for the Anglo-Saxons  the superiority over all the others.    The Anglo-Saxons commenced their career as pirates and robbers, and as  pirates and robbers of the most desperate and dangerous description.  In fact, the character which the Anglo-Saxons have obtained in modern  times for energy and enterprise, and for desperate daring in their  conflicts with foes, is no recent fame. The progenitors of the present  race were celebrated every where, and every where feared and dreaded,  not only in the days of Alfred, but several centuries before. All the  historians of those days that speak of them at all, describe them as  universally distinguished above their neighbors for their energy and  vehemence of character, their mental and physical superiority, and for  the wild and daring expeditions to which their spirit of enterprise  and activity were continually impelling them. They built vessels, in  which they boldly put forth on the waters of the German Ocean or of  the Baltic Sea on excursions for conquest or plunder. Like their  present posterity on the British isles and on the shores of the  Atlantic, they cared not, in these voyages, whether it was summer or  winter, calm or storm. In fact, they sailed often in tempests  and storms by choice, so as to come upon their enemies the more  unexpectedly.    [Illustration: SAXON MILITARY CHIEF]    They would build small vessels, or rather boats, of osiers, covering  them with skins, and in fleets of these frail floats they would sally  forth among the howling winds and foaming surges of the German Ocean.  On these expeditions, they all embarked as in a common cause, and felt  a common interest. The leaders shared in all the toils and exposures  of the men, and the men took part in the counsels and plans of the  leaders. Their intelligence and activity, and their resistless courage  and ardor, combined with their cool and calculating sagacity, made  them successful in every attempt. If they fought, they conquered; if  they pursued their enemies, they were sure to overtake them; if they  retreated, they were sure to make their escape. They were clothed in  a loose and flowing dress, and wore their hair long and hanging about  their shoulders; and they had the art, as their descendants have now,  of contriving and fabricating arms of such superior construction and  workmanship, as to give them, on this account alone, a great advantage  over all cotemporary nations. There were two other points in which  there was a remarkable similarity between this parent stock in its  rude, early form, and the extended social progeny which represents it  at the present day. One was the extreme strictness of their ideas of  conjugal fidelity, and the stern and rigid severity with which all  violations of female virtue were judged. The woman who violated her  marriage vows was compelled to hang herself. Her body was then burned  in public, and the accomplice of her crime was executed over the  ashes. The other point of resemblance between the ancient Anglo-Saxons  and their modern descendants was their indomitable pride. They could  never endure any thing like _submission_. Though sometimes  overpowered, they were never conquered. Though taken prisoners and  carried captive, the indomitable spirit which animated them could  never be really subdued. The Romans used sometimes to compel their  prisoners to fight as gladiators, to make spectacles for the amusement  of the people of the city. On one occasion, thirty Anglo-Saxons, who  had been taken captive and were reserved for this fate, strangled  themselves rather than submit to this indignity. The whole nation  manifested on all occasions a very unbending and unsubmissive will,  encountering every possible danger and braving every conceivable ill  rather than succumb or submit to any power except such as they had  themselves created for their own ends; and their descendants, whether  in England or America, evince much the same spirit still.    It was the landing of a few boat-loads of these determined and  ferocious barbarians on a small island near the mouth of the Thames,  which constitutes the great event of the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons  in England, which is so celebrated in English history as the epoch  which marks the real and true beginning of British greatness and  power. It is true that the history of England goes back beyond this  period to narrate, as we have done, the events connected with the  contests of the Romans and the aboriginal Britons, and the incursions  and maraudings of the Picts and Scots; but all these aborigines passed  gradually--after the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons--off the stage.  The old stock was wholly displaced. The present monarchy has sprung  entirely from its Anglo-Saxon original; so that all which precedes the  arrival of this new race is introductory and preliminary, like the  history, in this country, of the native American tribes before the  coming of the English Pilgrims. As, therefore, the landing of the  Pilgrims on the Plymouth Rock marks the true commencement of the  history of the American Republic, so that of the Anglo-Saxon  adventurers on the island of Thanet represents and marks the origin  of the British monarchy. The event therefore, stands as a great  and conspicuous landmark, though now dim and distant in the remote  antiquity in which it occurred.    And yet the event, though so wide-reaching and grand in its bearings  and relations, and in the vast consequences which have flowed and  which still continue to flow from it, was apparently a minute and  unimportant circumstance at the time when it occurred. There were only  three vessels at the first arrival. Of their size and character the  accounts vary. Some of these accounts say they contained three hundred  men; others seem to state that the number which arrived at the first  landing was three thousand. This, however, would seem impossible, as  no three vessels built in those days could convey so large a number.  We must suppose, therefore, that that number is meant to include those  who came at several of the earlier expeditions, and which were grouped  by the historian together, or else that several other vessels or  transports accompanied the three, which history has specially  commemorated as the first arriving.    In fact, very little can now be known in respect to the form and  capacity of the vessels in which these half-barbarous navigators  roamed, in those days, over the British seas. Their name, indeed, has  come down to us, and that is nearly all. They were called _cyules_;  though the name is sometimes spelled, in the ancient chronicles,  _ceols_, and in other ways. They were obviously vessels of  considerable capacity and were of such construction and such strength  as to stand the roughest marine exposures. They were accustomed to  brave fearlessly every commotion and to encounter every danger raised  either by winter tempests or summer gales in the restless waters of  the German Ocean.    The names of the commanders who headed the expedition which first  landed have been preserved, and they have acquired, as might have been  expected, a very wide celebrity. They were Hengist and Horsa. Hengist  and Horsa were brothers.    The place where they landed was the island of Thanet. Thanet is a  tract of land at the mouth of the Thames, on the southern side; a sort  of promontory extending into the sea, and forming the cape at the  south side of the estuary made by the mouth of the river. The extreme  point of land is called the North Foreland which, as it is the point  that thousands of vessels, coming out of the Thames, have to round in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16546"],[0,"Hinduism and Buddhism, An Historical Sketch, Vol. 2 (#4)"],[1,"and all violence  and distress. He saves too from moral evils, such as passion, hatred  and folly. He grants children to women who worship him. This power,  which is commonly exercised by female deities, is worth remarking as a  hint of his subsequent transformation into a goddess. For the better  achievement of his merciful deeds, he assumes all manner of forms, and  appears in the guise of a Buddha, a Bodhisattva, a Hindu deity, a  goblin, or a Brahman and in fact in any shape. This chapter was  translated into Chinese before 417 A.D. and therefore can hardly be  later than 350. He is also mentioned in the Sukhavati-vyuha. The  records of the Chinese pilgrims Fa-Hsien and Hsuean Chuang[23] indicate  that his worship prevailed in India from the fourth till the seventh  century and we are perhaps justified in dating its beginnings at least  two centuries earlier. But the absence of any mention of it in the  writings of Asvaghosha is remarkable.[24]    Avalokita is connected with a mountain called Potala or Potalaka. The  name is borne by the palace of the Grand Lama at Lhassa and by another  Lamaistic establishment at Jehol in north China. It reappears in the  sacred island of P'u-t'o near Ningpo. In all these cases the name of  Avalokita's Indian residence has been transferred to foreign shrines.  In India there were at least two places called Potala or Potalaka--one  at the mouth of the Indus and one in the south. No certain connection  has been traced between the former and the Bodhisattva but in the  seventh century the latter was regarded as his abode. Our information  about it comes mainly from Hsuean Chuang[25] who describes it when  speaking of the Malakuta country and as near the Mo-lo-ya (Malaya)  mountain. But apparently he did not visit it and this makes it  probable that it was not a religious centre but a mountain in the  south of which Buddhists in the north wrote with little precision.[26]  There is no evidence that Avalokita was first worshipped on this  Potalaka, though he is often associated with mountains such as Kapota  in Magadha and Valavati in Kataha.[27] In fact the connection of  Potala with Avalokita remains a mystery.    Avalokita has, like most Bodhisattvas, many names. Among the principal  are Mahakaruna, the Great Compassionate one, Lokanatha or Lokesvara,  the Lord of the world, and Padmapani, or lotus-handed. This last  refers to his appearance as portrayed in statues and miniatures. In  the older works of art his figure is human, without redundant limbs,  and represents a youth in the costume of an Indian prince with a high  jewelled chignon, or sometimes a crown. The head-dress is usually  surmounted by a small figure of Amitabha. His right hand is extended  in the position known as the gesture of charity.[28] In his left he  carries a red lotus and he often stands on a larger blossom. His  complexion is white or red. Sometimes he has four arms and in later  images a great number. He then carries besides the lotus such objects  as a book, a rosary and a jug of nectar.[29]    The images with many eyes and arms seem an attempt to represent him as  looking after the unhappy in all quarters and stretching out his hands  in help.[30] It is doubtful if the Bodhisattvas of the Gandhara  sculptures, though approaching the type of Avalokita, represent him  rather than any other, but nearly all the Buddhist sites of India  contain representations of him which date from the early centuries of  our era[31] and others are preserved in the miniatures of  manuscripts.[32]    He is not a mere adaptation of any one Hindu god. Some of his  attributes are also those of Brahma. Though in some late texts he is  said to have evolved the world from himself, his characteristic  function is not to create but, like Vishnu, to save and like Vishnu he  holds a lotus. But also he has the title of Isvara, which is specially  applied to Siva. Thus he does not issue from any local cult and has no  single mythological pedigree but is the idea of divine compassion  represented with such materials as the art and mythology of the day  offered.    He is often accompanied by a female figure Tara.[33] In the tantric  period she is recognized as his spouse and her images, common in  northern India from the seventh century onwards, show that she was  adored as a female Bodhisattva. In Tibet Tara is an important deity  who assumes many forms and even before the tantric influence had  become prominent she seems to have been associated with Avalokita. In  the Dharmasangraha she is named as one of the four Devis, and she is  mentioned twice under the name of To-lo Pu-sa by Hsuean Chuang, who saw  a statue of her in Vaisali and another at Tiladhaka in Magadha. This  last stood on the right of a gigantic figure of Buddha, Avalokita  being on his left.[34]    Hsuean Chuang distinguishes To-lo (Tara) and Kuan-tzu-tsai. The latter  under the name of Kuan-yin or Kwannon has become the most popular  goddess of China and Japan, but is apparently a form of Avalokita. The  god in his desire to help mankind assumes many shapes and, among  these, divine womanhood has by the suffrage of millions been judged  the most appropriate. But Tara was not originally the same as  Kuan-yin, though the fact that she accompanies Avalokita and shares  his attributes may have made it easier to think of him in female  form.[35]    The circumstances in which Avalokita became a goddess are obscure. The  Indian images of him are not feminine, although his sex is hardly  noticed before the tantric period. He is not a male deity like  Krishna, but a strong, bright spirit and like the Christian archangels  above sexual distinctions. No female form of him is reported from  Tibet and this confirms the idea that none was known in India,[36] and  that the change was made in China. It was probably facilitated by the  worship of Tara and of Hariti, an ogress who was converted by the  Buddha and is frequently represented in her regenerate state caressing  a child. She is mentioned by Hsuean Chuang and by I-Ching who adds that  her image was already known in China. The Chinese also worshipped a  native goddess called T'ien-hou or T'ou-mu. Kuan-yin was also  identified with an ancient Chinese heroine called Miao-shen.[37] This  is parallel to the legend of Ti-tsang (Kshitigarbha) who, though a  male Bodhisattva, was a virtuous maiden in two of his previous  existences. Evidently Chinese religious sentiment required a Madonna  and it is not unnatural if the god of mercy, who was reputed to assume  many shapes and to give sons to the childless, came to be thought of  chiefly in a feminine form. The artists of the T'ang dynasty usually  represented Avalokita as a youth with a slight moustache and the  evidence as to early female figures does not seem to me strong,[38]  though _a priori_ I see no reason for doubting their existence. In  1102 a Chinese monk named P'u-ming published a romantic legend of  Kuan-yin's earthly life which helped to popularize her worship. In  this and many other cases the later developments of Buddhism are due  to Chinese fancy and have no connection with Indian tradition.    Tara is a goddess of north India, Nepal and the Lamaist Church and  almost unknown in China and Japan. Her name means she who causes to  cross, that is who saves, life and its troubles being by a common  metaphor described as a sea. Tara also means a star and in Puranic  mythology is the name given to the mother of Buddha, the planet  Mercury. Whether the name was first used by Buddhists or Brahmans is  unknown, but after the seventh century there was a decided tendency to  give Tara the epithets bestowed on the Saktis of Siva and assimilate  her to those goddesses. Thus in the list of her 108 names[39] she is  described among other more amiable attributes as terrible, furious,  the slayer of evil beings, the destroyer, and Kali: also as carrying  skulls and being the mother of the Vedas. Here we have if not the  borrowing by Buddhists of a Saiva deity, at least the grafting of  Saiva conceptions on a Bodhisattva.    The second great Bodhisattva Manjusri[40] has other similar names,  such as Manjunatha and Manjughosha, the word Manju meaning sweet or  pleasant. He is also Vagisvara, the Lord of Speech, and Kumarabhuta,  the Prince, which possibly implies that he is the Buddha's eldest son,  charged with the government under his direction. He has much the same  literary history as Avalokita, not being mentioned in the Pali Canon  nor in the earlier Sanskrit works such as the Lalita-vistara and  Divyavadana. But his name occurs in the Sukhavati-vyuha: he is the  principal interlocutor in the Lankavatara sutra and is extolled in the  Ratna-karandaka-vyuha-sutra.[41] In the greater part of the Lotus he  is the principal Bodhisattva and instructs Maitreya, because, though  his youth is eternal, he has known many Buddhas through innumerable  ages. The Lotus[42] also recounts how he visited the depths of the sea  and converted the inhabitants thereof and how the Lord taught him what  are the duties of a Bodhisattva after the Buddha has entered finally  into Nirvana. As a rule he has no consort and appears as a male  Athene, all intellect and chastity, but sometimes Lakshmi or Sarasvati  or both are described as his consorts.[43]    His worship prevailed not only in India but in Nepal, Tibet, China,  Japan and Java. Fa-Hsien states that he was honoured in Central India,  and Hsuean Chuang that there were stupas dedicated to him at  Muttra.[44] He is also said to have been incarnate in Atisa, the  Tibetan reformer, and in Vairocana who introduced Buddhism to Khotan,  but, great as is his benevolence, he is not so much the helper of  human beings, which is Avalokita's special function, as the  personification of thought, knowledge, and meditation. It is for this  that he has in his hands the sword of knowledge and a book. A  beautiful figure from Java bearing these emblems"]]]
