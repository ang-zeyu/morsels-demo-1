He wanted to hasten on in the direction of the booming  noise, for he knew that there would be Germans fighting against the  English. For an instant his bosom swelled with pride at the thought  that he was English and then he shook his head again viciously.  \"No!\" he muttered, \"Tarzan of the Apes is not English, for the  English are men and Tarzan is Tarmangani;\" but he could not hide  even from his sorrow or from his sullen hatred of mankind in general  that his heart warmed at the thought it was Englishmen who fought  the Germans.  His regret was that the English were human and not  great white apes as he again considered himself.    \"Tomorrow,\" he thought, \"I will travel that way and find the Germans,\"  and then he set himself to the immediate task of discovering some  shelter from the storm. Presently he espied the low and narrow  entrance to what appeared to be a cave at the base of the cliffs  which formed the northern side of the gorge. With drawn knife he  approached the spot warily, for he knew that if it were a cave it  was doubtless the lair of some other beast. Before the entrance lay  many large fragments of rock of different sizes, similar to others  scattered along the entire base of the cliff, and it was in Tarzan's  mind that if he found the cave unoccupied he would barricade the  door and insure himself a quiet and peaceful night's repose within  the sheltered interior. Let the storm rage without--Tarzan would  remain within until it ceased, comfortable and dry. A tiny rivulet  of cold water trickled outward from the opening.    Close to the cave Tarzan kneeled and sniffed the ground.  A low  growl escaped him and his upper lip curved to expose his fighting  fangs. \"Numa!\" he muttered; but he did not stop. Numa might not be  at home--he would investigate.  The entrance was so low that the  ape-man was compelled to drop to all fours before he could poke  his head within the aperture; but first he looked, listened, and  sniffed in each direction at his rear--he would not be taken by  surprise from that quarter.    His first glance within the cave revealed a narrow tunnel with  daylight at its farther end. The interior of the tunnel was not so  dark but that the ape-man could readily see that it was untenanted  at present. Advancing cautiously he crawled toward the opposite  end imbued with a full realization of what it would mean if Numa  should suddenly enter the tunnel in front of him; but Numa did not  appear and the ape-man emerged at length into the open and stood  erect, finding himself in a rocky cleft whose precipitous walls  rose almost sheer on every hand, the tunnel from the gorge passing  through the cliff and forming a passageway from the outer world  into a large pocket or gulch entirely enclosed by steep walls of  rock. Except for the small passageway from the gorge, there was no  other entrance to the gulch which was some hundred feet in length  and about fifty in width and appeared to have been worn from the  rocky cliff by the falling of water during long ages. A tiny stream  from Kilimanjaro's eternal snow cap still trickled over the edge  of the rocky wall at the upper end of the gulch, forming a little  pool at the bottom of the cliff from which a small rivulet wound  downward to the tunnel through which it passed to the gorge beyond.  A single great tree flourished near the center of the gulch, while  tufts of wiry grass were scattered here and there among the rocks  of the gravelly floor.    The bones of many large animals lay about and among them were  several human skulls. Tarzan raised his eyebrows. \"A man-eater,\"  he murmured, \"and from appearances he has held sway here for a long  time. Tonight Tarzan will take the lair of the man-eater and Numa  may roar and grumble upon the outside.\"    The ape-man had advanced well into the gulch as he investigated  his surroundings and now as he stood near the tree, satisfied that  the tunnel would prove a dry and quiet retreat for the night, he  turned to retrace his way to the outer end of the entrance that he  might block it with boulders against Numa's return, but even with  the thought there came something to his sensitive ears that froze  him into statuesque immobility with eyes glued upon the tunnel's  mouth. A moment later the head of a huge lion framed in a great  black mane appeared in the opening. The yellow-green eyes glared,  round and unblinking, straight at the trespassing Tarmangani, a low  growl rumbled from the deep chest, and lips curled back to expose  the mighty fangs.    \"Brother of Dango!\" shouted Tarzan, angered that Numa's return should  have been so timed as to frustrate his plans for a comfortable  night's repose. \"I am Tarzan of the Apes, Lord of the Jungle.  Tonight I lair here--go!\"    But Numa did not go. Instead he rumbled forth a menacing roar and  took a few steps in Tarzan's direction. The ape-man picked up a  rock and hurled it at the snarling face. One can never be sure of  a lion. This one might turn tail and run at the first intimation  of attack--Tarzan had bluffed many in his time--but not now. The  missile struck Numa full upon the snout--a tender part of a cat's  anatomy--and instead of causing him to flee it transformed him into  an infuriated engine of wrath and destruction.    Up went his tail, stiff and erect, and with a series of frightful  roars he bore down upon the Tarmangani at the speed of an express  train. Not an instant too soon did Tarzan reach the tree and swing  himself into its branches and there he squatted, hurling insults at  the king of beasts while Numa paced a circle beneath him, growling  and roaring in rage.    It was raining now in earnest adding to the ape-man's discomfort  and disappointment. He was very angry; but as only direct necessity  had ever led him to close in mortal combat with a lion, knowing  as he did that he had only luck and agility to pit against the  frightful odds of muscle, weight, fangs, and talons, he did not now  even consider descending and engaging in so unequal and useless a  duel for the mere reward of a little added creature comfort. And  so he sat perched in the tree while the rain fell steadily and the  lion padded round and round beneath, casting a baleful eye upward  after every few steps.    Tarzan scanned the precipitous walls for an avenue of escape. They  would have baffled an ordinary man; but the ape-man, accustomed  to climbing, saw several places where he might gain a foothold,  precarious possibly; but enough to give him reasonable assurance  of escape if Numa would but betake himself to the far end of the  gulch for a moment.  Numa, however, notwithstanding the rain, gave  no evidence of quitting his post so that at last Tarzan really  began to consider seriously if it might not be as well to take the  chance of a battle with him rather than remain longer cold and wet  and humiliated in the tree.    But even as he turned the matter over in his mind Numa turned  suddenly and walked majestically toward the tunnel without even a  backward glance. The instant that he disappeared, Tarzan dropped  lightly to the ground upon the far side of the tree and was away at  top speed for the cliff. The lion had no sooner entered the tunnel  than he backed immediately out again and, pivoting like a flash,  was off across the gulch in full charge after the flying ape-man;  but Tarzan's lead was too great--if he could find finger or foothold  upon the sheer wall he would be safe; but should he slip from the  wet rocks his doom was already sealed as he would fall directly into  Numa's clutches where even the Great Tarmangani would be helpless.    With the agility of a cat Tarzan ran up the cliff for thirty feet  before he paused, and there finding a secure foothold, he stopped  and looked down upon Numa who was leaping upward in a wild and  futile attempt to scale the rocky wall to his prey. Fifteen or  twenty feet from the ground the lion would scramble only to fall  backward again defeated. Tarzan eyed him for a moment and then  commenced a slow and cautious ascent toward the summit. Several  times he had difficulty in finding holds but at last he drew himself  over the edge, rose, picked up a bit of loose rock, hurled it at  Numa and strode away.    Finding an easy descent to the gorge, he was about to pursue his  journey in the direction of the still-booming guns when a sudden  thought caused him to halt and a half-smile to play about his lips.  Turning, he trotted quickly back to the outer opening of Numa's  tunnel. Close beside it he listened for a moment and then rapidly  began to gather large rocks and pile them within the entrance.  He had almost closed the aperture when the lion appeared upon the  inside--a very ferocious and angry lion that pawed and clawed at  the rocks and uttered mighty roars that caused the earth to tremble;  but roars did not frighten Tarzan of the Apes. At Kala's shaggy  breast he had closed his infant eyes in sleep upon countless nights  in years gone by to the savage chorus of similar roars. Scarcely a  day or night of his jungle life--and practically all his life had  been spent in the jungle--had he not heard the roaring of hungry  lions, or angry lions, or love-sick lions. Such sounds affected  Tarzan as the tooting of an automobile horn may affect you--if you  are in front of the automobile it warns you out of the way, if you  are not in front of it you scarcely notice it. Figuratively Tarzan  was not in front of the automobile--Numa could not reach him and  Tarzan knew it, so he continued deliberately to choke the entrance  until there was no possibility of Numa's getting out again. When  he was quite through he made a grimace at the hidden lion beyond  the barrier and resumed his way toward the east. \"A man-eater who  will eat no more men,\" he soliloquized.

Accordingly, I found that the edge of the ice round this clear  area was much thicker than the rest of the ice of the floor, and was  evidently the remains of the swelling pedestal of a column which had  been about 12 feet in circumference. This departed column may account  for a fact which I discovered in another glaciere, and found to be of  very common occurrence, viz., that in large stalagmites there is a  considerable internal cavity, extending some feet up from the ground,  and affording room even for a man to walk about inside the column.  When the melted snows of spring send down to the cave, through the  fissures of the rock, an abundance of water at a very low  temperature, and the cave itself is stored with the winter's cold,  these thicker rings of ice catch first the descending water, and so a  circular wall, naturally conical, is formed round the area of stones;  the remaining water either running off through the interstices, or  forming a floor of ice of less thickness, which yields to the next  summer's drops. In the course of time, this conical wall rises,  narrowing always, till a dome-like roof is at length formed, and  thenceforth the column is solid. Of course, the interior cannot be  wholly free from ice; and it will be seen from the account of one of  these cavities, which I explored in the Schafloch, that they are  decked with ice precisely as might be expected.[9] Another possible  explanation of this curious and beautiful phenomenon will be given  hereafter.[10]    The temperature was half a degree lower than when there were three of us  in the cave two days before. I deposited one of Casella's registering  thermometers, on wood, on a stone in that part of the floor which was  free from ice, though there was ice all round it at some little  distance. The thermometer was well above the surface of the ice, and  was protected from chance drops of water from the roof.    The next morning I started early from Arzier, having an afternoon  journey in prospect to the neighbourhood of another glaciere, and was  accompanied by Captain Douglas Smith, of the 4th Regiment. On our way to  La Genolliere, we came across the man who had served as guide the day  before, and a short conversation respecting the glaciere ensued. He had  only seen it once, many years before, and he held stoutly to the usual  belief of the peasantry, that the ice is formed in summer, and melts in  winter; a belief which everything I had then seen contradicted. His last  words as we parted were, '_Plus il fait chaud, plus ca gele_;' and,  paradoxical as it may appear, I believe that some truth was concealed in  what he said, though not as he meant it. Considering that his ideas were  confined to his cattle and their requirements, and that water is often  very difficult to find in that part of the Jura, a _hot_ summer would  probably mean with him a _dry_ summer, that is, a summer which does not  send down much water to thaw the columns in the cave. Extra heat in the  air outside, at any season, does not, as experience of these caves  proves abundantly, produce very considerable disturbance of their low  temperature, and so summer water is a much worse enemy than extra summer  heat; and if the caves could be protected from water in the hot season,  the columns in them would know how to resist the possible--but very  small--increase of temperature due to the excess of heat of one summer  above another. And since the eye is most struck by the appearance of the  stalagmites and ice-cascades, it may well be that the peasants have seen  these standing at the end of an unusually hot and dry summer, and have  thence concluded that hot summers are the best time for the formation of  ice. Of course, at the beginning of the winter after a hot summer, there  will be on these terms a larger nucleus of ice; and so it will become  true that the hotter the year, the more ice there will be, both during  the summer itself and after the following winter.    The further process of the formation of ice will be this:--the colds of  early winter will freeze all the water that may be in the glacieres from  the summer's thaw, in such caves as do not possess a drainage, and then  the frost will have nothing to occupy itself upon but the ice already  formed, for no water can descend from the frost-bound surface of the  earth.[11] As soon as the snow begins to melt to so great a degree that  the fissures are opened up once more, the extremely cold water resulting  therefrom will descend through the limestone into a cave perfectly dry,  and filled with an atmosphere many degrees below the freezing point,  whose frost-power eagerly lays hold of every drop of water which does  not make its escape in time by the drainage of the cave. Thus the spring  months will be the great time of the formation of ice, and also of the  raising of the temperature from some degrees below freezing to the more  temperate register at which I have generally found it, viz., rather  above than below 32 deg.. Professor Tyndall very properly likens the  external atmosphere to a ratchet-wheel, from its property of allowing  the passage of hot rays down to the surface of the earth, and resisting  their return: it may equally be so described on other grounds, inasmuch  as the cold and heavy atmosphere will sink in the winter into the pits  which lead to glacieres, and will refuse to be altogether displaced in  summer by anything short of solar radiation.    We found the one column of the previous day still standing, though  evidently in an unhappy state of decay. The sharpness of its edges was  wholly gone, and it was withered and contorted; there were two cracks  completely through it, dividing it into three pieces 4 or 5 feet long,  which were clearly on the point of coming down. Externally, the day was  fine and warm, and so we found the cave comparatively dry, only one drop  falling in a minute on to the stone where ninety-six had fallen in the  same time the day before. The thermometer registered 32 deg. as the greatest  cold of the night, and still stood at that point when we took it up.    We spent some little time in exploring the neighbourhood of the pits, in  order to find, if possible, the outlet for the drainage, but the ground  did not fall away sufficiently for any source from so low an origin to  show itself. The search was suggested by what I remembered of the  Glaciere of S. Georges three years before, where the people believe that  a small streamlet which issues from the bottom of a steep rock, some  distance off, owes its existence to the glaciere.      FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 1: In this neighbourhood, the _montagne_ of any _commune_ is  represented by the feminine form of the name of the village: thus,  _L'Arziere_ is the _montagne_ of Arzier, and _La Bassine_ of Bassin.  This has a curious effect in the case of some villages--such, for  instance, as S. Georges--one of the landmarks of the district between  the lakes of Joux and Geneva being the _Chalet de la S. Georges_, a  grammatical anomaly which puzzles a stranger descending the southernmost  slope of the Jura from the Asile de Marchairuz. This law of formation is  not universal; for the _montagnes_ of Rolle and S. Livres are called the  _Pre de Rolle_ and the _Pre de S. Livres_, while the _Fruitiere de Nyon_  is the rich upland possession of the town of that name.]    [Footnote 2: Probably a relic of the time when the earlier Barons of  Coppet possessed this district. The families of Grandson, Lesdiguieres,  and Dohna successively held the barony; and in later times the title _de  Coppet_ hid a name more widely known, for on the Chalet of _Les  Biolles_, some distance to the east of La Baronne, the name of _Auguste  de Stael de Holstein de Coppet_ is carved, after the fashion of Swiss  chalets.

The first  thorough thaw will have the same effect as the removal of the thumb from  the upper orifice in the case of the hand-shower-bath; and the water  thus rained down into the cave will have a temperature sufficiently high  to destroy some portion of the cold stored up by the descent of the  heavy atmosphere of winter, or at least to melt out the ice which may  have blocked up the lower ends of the fissures.]             *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER II.
