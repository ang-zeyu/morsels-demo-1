[Illustration: Each Food Shown is Equivalent in Protein to the Platter  of Meat in the Center of the Picture.]          SAVE MEAT    _REASONS WHY OUR GOVERNMENT HAS ASKED US TO SAVE MEAT WITH PRACTICAL  RECIPES FOR MEAT CONSERVATION_      As a nation we eat and waste 80 per cent. more meat than we require to  maintain health. This statement, recently issued by the United States  Food Administration, is appalling when we consider that there is a  greater demand for meat in the world to-day than ever before, coupled  with a greatly decreased production. The increase in the demand for  meat and animal products is due to the stress of the war. Millions of  men are on the fighting line doing hard physical labor, and require  a larger food allowance than when they were civilians. To meet  the demand for meat and to save their grains, our Allies have been  compelled to kill upward of thirty-three million head of their stock  animals, and they have thus stifled their animal production. This was  burning the candle at both ends, and they now face increased demand  handicapped by decreased production.    America must fill the breach. Not only must we meet the present  increased demand, but we must be prepared as the war advances to meet  an even greater demand for this most necessary food. The way out of  this serious situation is first to reduce meat consumption to the  amount really needed and then to learn to use other foods that will  supply the food element which is found in meat. This element is called  protein, and we depend upon it to build and repair body tissues.    Although most persons believe that protein can only be obtained  from meat, it is found in many other foods, such as milk, skim milk,  cheese, cottage cheese, poultry, eggs, fish, dried peas, beans, cow  peas, lentils and nuts. For instance, pound for pound, salmon, either  fresh or canned, equals round steak in protein content; cream cheese  contains one-quarter more protein and three times as much fat; peanuts  (hulled) one-q"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15478"],[0,"New York Times Current History: The European War, Vol 2, No. 1, April, 1915 (#4)"],[1,"ver, if  the United States would urgently recommend to its merchant vessels to  avoid the British naval war zone, in any case until the settlement of  the flag question. Germany is inclined to the confident hope that the  United States will be able to appreciate in its entire significance the  heavy battle which Germany is waging for existence, and that from the  foregoing explanations and promises it will acquire full understanding  of the motives and the aims of the measures announced by Germany.    Germany repeats that it has now resolved upon the projected measures  only under the strongest necessity of national self-defense, such  measures having been deferred out of consideration for neutrals.    If the United States, in view of the weight which it is justified in  throwing and able to throw into the scales of the fate of peoples,  should succeed at the last moment in removing the grounds which make  that procedure an obligatory duty for Germany, and if the American  Government, in particular, should find a way to make the Declaration of  London respected--on behalf, also, of those powers which are fighting on  Germany's side--and there by make possible for Germany legitimate  importation of the necessaries of life and industrial raw material, then  the German Government could not too highly appreciate such a service,  rendered in the interests of humane methods of warfare, and would gladly  draw conclusions from the new situation.      BRITAIN'S ANSWER.    _LONDON, Feb. 19.--The full text of Great Britain's note regarding the  flag, as handed to the American Ambassador, follows:_    The memorandum communicated on the 11th of February calls attention in  courteous and friendly terms to the action of the Captain of the British  steamer Lusitania in raising the flag of the United States of America  when approaching British waters, and says that the Government of the  United States feels certain anxiety in considering the possibility of  any general use of the flag of the United States by British vessels  traversing those waters, since the effect of such a policy might be to  bring about a menace to the lives and vessels of United States citizens.    It was understood that the German Government announced their intention  of sinking British merchant vessels at sight by torpedoes, without  giving any opportunity of making any provision for the saving of the  lives of non-combatant crews and passengers. It was in consequence of  this threat that the Lusitania raised the United States flag on her  inward voyage.    On her subsequent outward voyage a request was made by United States  passengers, who were embarking on board of her, that the United States  flag should be hoisted presumably to insure their safety. Meanwhile, the  memorandum from your Excellency had been received. His Majesty's  Government did not give any advice to the company as to how to meet this  request, and it understood that the Lusitania left Liverpool under the  British flag.    It seems unnecessary to say more as regards the Lusitania in particular.    In regard to the use of foreign flags by merchant vessels, the British  Merchant Shipping act makes it clear that the use of the British flag by  foreign merchant vessels is permitted in time of war for the purpose of  escaping capture. It is believed that in the case of some other nations  there is similar recognition of the same practice with regard to their  flag, and that none of them has forbidden it.    It would, therefore, be unreasonable to expect his Majesty's Government  to pass legislation forbidding the use of foreign flags by British  merchant vessels to avoid capture by the enemy, now that the German  Government have announced their intention to sink merchant vessels at  sight with their non-combatant crews, cargoes, and papers, a proceeding  hitherto regarded by the opinion of the world not as war, but piracy.    It is felt that the United States Government could not fairly ask the  British Government to order British merchant vessels to forgo a means,  always hitherto permitted, of escaping not only capture but the much  worse fate of sinking and destruction.    Great Britain always has, when a neutral, accorded to vessels of other  States at war the liberty to use the British flag as a means of  protection against capture, and instances are on record when United  States vessels availed themselves of this facility during the American  civil war. It would be contrary to fair expectation if now, when  conditions are reversed, the United States and neutral nations were to  grudge to British ships the liberty to take similar action.    The British Government have no intention of advising their merchant  shipping to use foreign flags as a general practice or to resort to them  otherwise than for escaping capture or destruction. The obligation upon  a belligerent warship to ascertain definitely for itself the nationality  and character of a merchant vessel before capturing it, and a fortiori  before sinking and destroying it, has been universally recognized.    If that obligation is fulfilled, the hoisting of a neutral flag on board  a British vessel cannot possibly endanger neutral shipping, and the  British Government holds that if loss to neutrals is caused by disregard  of this obligation it is upon the enemy vessel disregarding it and upon  the Government giving the orders that it should be disregarded that the  sole responsibility for injury to neutrals ought to rest.      ALLIES' DECLARATION OF REPRISALS.    _LONDON, March 1.--Following is the text of the statement read by  Premier Asquith in the House of Commons today and communicated at the  same time to the neutral powers in their capitals as an outline of the  Allies' policy of retaliation against Germany for her \"war zone\"  decree:_    Germany has declared the English Channel, the north and west coasts of  France, and the waters around the British Isles a war area, and has  officially given notice that all enemy ships found in that area will be  destroyed, and that neutral vessels may be exposed to danger.    This is, in effect, a claim to torpedo at sight, without regard to the  safety of the crew or passengers, any merchant vessel under any flag. As  it is not in the power of the German Admiralty to maintain any surface  craft in these waters, the attack can only be delivered by submarine  agency.    The law and customs of nations in regard to attacks on commerce have  always presumed that the first duty of the captor of a merchant vessel  is bringing it before a prize court, where it may be tried and where  regularities of the capture may be challenged, and where neutrals may  recover their cargo.    The sinking of prizes is, in itself, a questionable act, to be resorted  to only in extraordinary circumstances, and after provision has been  made for the safety of all crews and passengers.    The responsibility of discriminating between neutral and enemy vessels  and between neutral and enemy cargoes obviously rests with the attacking  ship, whose duty it is to verify the status and character of the vessel  and cargo, and to preserve all papers before sinking or capturing the  ship. So, also, the humane duty to provide for the safety of crews of  merchant vessels, whether neutral or enemy, is an obligation on every  belligerent.    It is upon this basis that all previous discussions of law for  regulating warfare have proceeded. The German submarine fulfills none of  these obligations. She enjoys no local command of the waters wherein she  operates. She does not take her captures within the jurisdiction of a  prize court. She carries no prize crew which can be put aboard prizes  which she seizes. She uses no effective means of discriminating between  neutral and enemy vessels. She does not receive on board for safety the  crew of the vessel she sinks. Her methods of warfare, therefore, are  entirely outside the scope of any international instruments regulating  operations against commerce in time of war.    The German declaration substitutes indiscriminate destruction for  regulated captures. Germany has adopted this method against the peaceful  trader and the non-combatant, with the avowed object of preventing  commodities of all kinds, including food for the civilian population,  from reaching or leaving the British Isles or Northern France.    Her opponents are, therefore, driven to frame retaliatory measures in  order in their turn to prevent commodities of any kind from reaching or  leaving Germany.    These measures will, however, be enforced by the British and French  Governments without risk to neutral ships or neutral or non-combatant  lives, and in strict observation of the dictates of humanity. The  British and French Governments will, therefore, hold themselves free to  detain and take into port ships carrying goods of presumed enemy  destination, ownership, or origin.    It is not intended to confiscate such vessels or cargoes unless they  would otherwise be liable to confiscation. Vessels with cargoes which  sailed before this date will not be affected.      Britain's New and Original Blockade    American Protests Following the \"War Zone\" Decrees Defined         The first definite statement of the real character of the       measures adopted by Great Britain and her allies for       restricting the trade of Germany was obtained at Washington on       March 17, 1915, when Secretary Bryan made public the text of       all the recent notes exchanged between the United States       Government and Germany and the Allies regarding the freedom of       legitimate American commerce in the war zones. These notes,       six in all, show that Great Britain and France stand firm in       their announced intention to cut off all trade with Germany.       The communications revealed that the United States Government,       realizing the difficulties of maintaining an effective       blockade by a close guard of an "]]]
