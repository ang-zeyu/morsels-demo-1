Had I been accused of a design to fire the temples, to slaughter  the priests with impious sword, of plotting the massacre of all honest  men, I should yet have been produced in court, and only punished on due  confession or conviction. Now for my too great zeal towards the senate I  have been condemned to outlawry and death, unheard and undefended, at a  distance of near five hundred miles away.[C] Oh, my judges, well do ye  deserve that no one should hereafter be convicted of a fault like mine!    'Yet even my very accusers saw how honourable was the charge they  brought against me, and, in order to overlay it with some shadow of  guilt, they falsely asserted that in the pursuit of my ambition I had  stained my conscience with sacrilegious acts. And yet thy spirit,  indwelling in me, had driven from the chamber of my soul all lust of  earthly success, and with thine eye ever upon me, there could be no  place left for sacrilege. For thou didst daily repeat in my ear and  instil into my mind the Pythagorean maxim, \"Follow after God.\" It was  not likely, then, that I should covet the assistance of the vilest  spirits, when thou wert moulding me to such an excellence as should  conform me to the likeness of God. Again, the innocency of the inner  sanctuary of my home, the company of friends of the highest probity, a  father-in-law revered at once for his pure character and his active  beneficence, shield me from the very suspicion of sacrilege.  Yet--atrocious as it is--they even draw credence for this charge from  _thee_; I am like to be thought implicated in wickedness on this very  account, that I am imbued with _thy_ teachings and stablished in _thy_  ways. So it is not enough that my devotion to thee should profit me  nothing, but thou also must be assailed by reason of the odium which I  have incurred. Verily this is the very crown of my misfortunes, that  men's opinions for the most part look not to real merit, but to the  event; and only recognise foresight where Fortune has crowned the issue  with her approval. Whereby it comes to pass that reputation is the first  of all things to abandon the unfortunate. I remember with chagrin how  perverse is popular report, how various and discordant men's judgments.  This only will I say, that the most crushing of misfortune's burdens is,  that as soon as a charge is fastened upon the unhappy, they are believed  to have deserved their sufferings. I, for my part, who have been  banished from all life's blessings, stripped of my honours, stained in  repute, am punished for well-doing.    'And now methinks I see the villainous dens of the wicked surging with  joy and gladness, all the most recklessly unscrupulous threatening a new  crop of lying informations, the good prostrate with terror at my danger,  every ruffian incited by impunity to new daring and to success by the  profits of audacity, the guiltless not only robbed of their peace of  mind, but even of all means of defence. Wherefore I would fain cry out:    FOOTNOTES:    [C] The distance from Rome to Pavia, the place of Boethius'  imprisonment, is 455 Roman miles.        SONG V.    BOETHIUS' PRAYER.          'Builder of yon starry dome,        Thou that whirlest, throned eternal,      Heaven's swift globe, and, as they roam,        Guid'st the stars by laws supernal:          So in full-sphered splendour dight          Cynthia dims the lamps of night,        But unto the orb fraternal          Closer drawn,[D] doth lose her light.        'Who at fall of eventide,        Hesper, his cold radiance showeth,      Lucifer his beams doth hide,        Paling as the sun's light groweth,          Brief, while winter's frost holds sway,          By thy will the space of day;        Swift, when summer's fervour gloweth,          Speed the hours of night away.        'Thou dost rule the changing year:        When rude Boreas oppresses,      Fall the leaves; they reappear,        Wooed by Zephyr's soft caresses.          Fields that Sirius burns deep grown          By Arcturus' watch were sown:        Each the reign of law confesses,          Keeps the place that is his own.

'Look, oh look upon this earth,        Thou who on law's sure foundation      Framedst all! Have we no worth,        We poor men, of all creation?          Sore we toss on fortune's tide;          Master, bid the waves subside!        And earth's ways with consummation          Of Thy heaven's order guide!'      FOOTNOTES:    [D] The moon is regarded as farthest from the sun at the full, and, as  she wanes, approaching gradually nearer.        V.      When I had poured out my griefs in this long and unbroken strain of  lamentation, she, with calm countenance, and in no wise disturbed at my  complainings, thus spake:    'When I saw thee sorrowful, in tears, I straightway knew thee wretched  and an exile. But how far distant that exile I should not know, had not  thine own speech revealed it. Yet how far indeed from thy country hast  thou, not been banished, but rather hast strayed; or, if thou wilt have  it banishment, hast banished thyself! For no one else could ever  lawfully have had this power over thee. Now, if thou wilt call to mind  from what country thou art sprung, it is not ruled, as once was the  Athenian polity, by the sovereignty of the multitude, but \"one is its  Ruler, one its King,\" who takes delight in the number of His citizens,  not in their banishment; to submit to whose governance and to obey  whose ordinances is perfect freedom. Art thou ignorant of that most  ancient law of this thy country, whereby it is decreed that no one  whatsoever, who hath chosen to fix there his dwelling, may be sent into  exile? For truly there is no fear that one who is encompassed by its  ramparts and defences should deserve to be exiled. But he who has ceased  to wish to dwell therein, he likewise ceases to deserve to do so. And so  it is not so much the aspect of this place which moves me, as thy  aspect; not so much the library walls set off with glass and ivory which  I miss, as the chamber of thy mind, wherein I once placed, not books,  but that which gives books their value, the doctrines which my books  contain. Now, what thou hast said of thy services to the commonweal is  true, only too little compared with the greatness of thy deservings. The  things laid to thy charge whereof thou hast spoken, whether such as  redound to thy credit, or mere false accusations, are publicly known. As  for the crimes and deceits of the informers, thou hast rightly deemed  it fitting to pass them over lightly, because the popular voice hath  better and more fully pronounced upon them. Thou hast bitterly  complained of the injustice of the senate. Thou hast grieved over my  calumniation, and likewise hast lamented the damage to my good name.  Finally, thine indignation blazed forth against fortune; thou hast  complained of the unfairness with which thy merits have been  recompensed. Last of all thy frantic muse framed a prayer that the peace  which reigns in heaven might rule earth also. But since a throng of  tumultuous passions hath assailed thy soul, since thou art distraught  with anger, pain, and grief, strong remedies are not proper for thee in  this thy present mood. And so for a time I will use milder methods, that  the tumours which have grown hard through the influx of disturbing  passion may be softened by gentle treatment, till they can bear the  force of sharper remedies.'        SONG VI.    ALL THINGS HAVE THEIR NEEDFUL ORDER          He who to th' unwilling furrows        Gives the generous grain,      When the Crab with baleful fervours        Scorches all the plain;      He shall find his garner bare,      Acorns for his scanty fare.        Go not forth to cull sweet violets        From the purpled steep,      While the furious blasts of winter        Through the valleys sweep;      Nor the grape o'erhasty bring      To the press in days of spring.        For to each thing God hath given        Its appointed time;      No perplexing change permits He        In His plan sublime.      So who quits the order due      Shall a luckless issue rue.        VI.      'First, then, wilt thou suffer me by a few questions to make some  attempt to test the state of thy mind, that I may learn in what way to  set about thy cure?'    'Ask what thou wilt,' said I, 'for I will answer whatever questions thou  choosest to put.'    Then said she: 'This world of ours--thinkest thou it is governed  haphazard and fortuitously, or believest thou that there is in it any  rational guidance?'    'Nay,' said I, 'in no wise may I deem that such fixed motions can be  determined by random hazard, but I know that God, the Creator, presideth  over His work, nor will the day ever come that shall drive me from  holding fast the truth of this belief.'    'Yes,' said she; 'thou didst even but now affirm it in song, lamenting  that men alone had no portion in the divine care. As to the rest, thou  wert unshaken in the belief that they were ruled by reason. Yet I  marvel exceedingly how, in spite of thy firm hold on this opinion, thou  art fallen into sickness. But let us probe more deeply: something or  other is missing, I think. Now, tell me, since thou "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14339"],[0,"Music Talks with Children (#4)"],[1,"is known as inattention. To listen with full attention, all  other things being entirely absent from the mind, is one form of  concentration.    Inattention is a destroyer. It divides our power between two or more  things when it should be directed upon a single thing. Concentration  gives us greater and greater mind-power. If you will look in the  dictionary to find what concentration means (you should be good  friends with the dictionary) you will find it is made up of _con_[15]  meaning with, and _centrum_, a center, \"with a center,\" or \"to come to  a center.\" If you hold a magnifying-glass between your hand and the  sun you will find that at a certain distance the sunlight is in a  circle. By changing the distance with delicacy you can diminish the  circle to almost a point,--you make the light _come to a center_. When  the circle of light is large, no particular effect is noted by the  hand. When, however, the circle is as small as it can be made you feel  a sensation of warmth which, if continued long enough, will really  burn the hand. That small circle is the sunlight _in concentration_.  The rays of sunlight, instead of being scattered, are centered. They  burn the hand because they are full of power--powerful.    By way of example: Let the different rays stand for inattention and  the tiny circle of light for concentration. The former has little or  no power; the latter is full of power. This very well illustrates what  happens, both when our thoughts are scattered over a large area, and  when they are brought together--concentrated--in a small circle. The  first listening indeed which should claim our attention is not  tone-listening, but listening to what is said to us. No one under a  good teacher ever learns well who is not attentive and obedient. And  then _listening_ and _doing_ are inseparably joined. Tone-listening  makes us self-critical and observant, and we are assured by men of  science that unless we become good observers in our early years, it is  later impossible for us.[16]    In the previous Talk we spoke about listening to all kinds of sounds,  particularly those out-of-doors. In this Talk we shall speak only of  real music-listening. You know, now, that music born out of the heart  is the thought of a good man. Of course, beautiful thoughts of any  kind should be listened to not only with attention, but with  reverence. Reverence is the tribute which the thoughtful listener pays  to the music of a man who has expressed himself beautifully in tone.  This at once reveals to us that we should listen to what is great for  the purpose of getting ideals. We hear what we hope to attain. It is  said of the violinist, Pierre Baillot, that when only ten years of age  he heard the playing of Viotti, and though he did not hear it again  for twenty years the performance ever remained in his mind as an ideal  to be realized in his studies, and he worked to attain it.    The pupils of the great Viennese teacher of the piano, Theodor  Leschetizky, say he asks no question more frequently than \"Can you not  hear?\" It is not only difficult to listen to ourselves, but listening  is one thing and decidedly a superior thing, while hearing is another  and equally inferior thing. And it shows us, when we think of it, that  no self-criticism is possible until we forget all things else and  listen to what we are doing and listen with concentration. It now  becomes clear to us that no one becomes an intelligent musician who is  not skilled in tone sense, in listening, and having thoughts about  what is heard.    We may read again from the excellent rules of Robert Schumann:    \"Frequently sing in choruses, especially the middle parts; this will  help to make you musical.\"    Out of this we learn to try to hear more than the melody, to try  sometimes not to think of the melody, but to listen only to that which  accompanies it. When, in school, you sing in two and three parts,  notice how one is inclined always to sing the soprano. The melody  pulls us away from another part if we are not concentrated upon our  part. Yet notice how beautifully musical the lower parts are. Listen  intently to them whatever part you sing.    It seems in music that we learn to listen in two directions. First, by  training the attention merely to follow prominent sounds and to be  conscious of all of them; then, later, we do not need to think so much  of the prominent melody but we strive to hear the accompanying parts.  These are the melodies which are somewhat concealed by the principal  one; not truly concealed either, for they are plain enough if we will  listen. They make one think of flowers hidden in the grass and  foliage. They are none the less beautiful though they are concealed;  for the sunlight seeks them out and makes them blossom.    We find hidden melodies in all good music because it is the character  of good music to have interesting and beautiful melodic thought  everywhere. There are never meaningless tones allowed. Every sound  says something and is needed. It is curious that in our playing the  moment we put our thoughts upon any tone or voice part with the desire  to hear it, it comes out at once as plainly as if it was the highest  melody. That illustrates the power of thought concentrated upon even a  hidden thing. You know how in Bach even the piano works move as if all  parts were to be sung by voices. It reminds one of conversation; of  the story, of the question and answer, of the merry chat in a pleasant  company. Some bits of sentence are tripping and full of laughter,[17]  others grave and majestic,[18] others have wonderful dignity of heart  and mind.[19]    Such qualities give music interest and meaning in every part. It will  not take you long to discover that it is just the absence of these  qualities that makes other music common.    The melody is not sustained by anything particularly well worth  listening to. One might say that good music is like the foliage of the  garden, every leaf and petal variously yet finely formed, and all  combined to make a beautiful whole.    When you have learned carefully to follow the accompaniment of a  melody, try to follow the single voice parts in the chorus,  particularly the Bass, Tenor, and Alto. And when you go to orchestral  concerts learn early to follow special instruments like the clarinet,  the oboe, the drum.    Especially try to follow the lower strings, the viola, the 'cello, and  the bass. They are strongly characteristic. You will learn their  peculiar qualities only by giving them special and concentrated  thought. You will now see that acute and careful listening has its  definite ways and purposes. Here they are:        I. Listening comes from concentration.       II. When listening to great music it must be with reverence as well         as with attention.      III. We must listen for ideals.       IV. We must listen in order to be self-critical.        V. Constant listening to true music reveals that there is never a         tone used unless it has a meaning.    And besides all this we must think that among those who listen to us  there may be some one who has learned this careful concentrated way.  Then we shall have it ever in mind to \"play as if in the presence of a  master.\"[20]          CHAPTER VI.    THINKING IN TONE.        \"The gods for labor sell us all good things.\"--_Epicharmus_.[21]    Perhaps you have some doubt as to exactly what is meant by  music-thinking. Being somewhat acquainted with composers and with  music, the thought may here come to you that all the music we hear in  the world must have been made by somebody--by many somebodies, in  fact. They have had to sit down, and forgetting all things else,  listen intently to the music-thought which fills the mind. If you will  sit quietly by yourself you will discover that you can easily think  words and sentences and really hear them in the mind without  pronouncing anything. In quite the same way the composer sits and  hears music, tone by tone, and as clearly as if it were played by a  piano or an orchestra. And to him the tones have a clear meaning, just  as words have a clear meaning to us. Naturally, one can see that there  could be no other way. Unless the composer can think out everything  exactly there could be no music, for music must be written, and one  can only write what one thinks. So at this point the thought to  remember is this: Music must exist in some one's mind before others  can have it to hear and enjoy.    In like manner--just the same manner, in fact--the painter is one who  thinks pictures; the sculptor, one who thinks statues; the architect,  one who thinks buildings. They think these things just as you think  words; and as you tell your thoughts in spoken words, so they tell  their thoughts in printed music, in painted pictures, in chiseled  statues, and in erected buildings. Now, from all this it should be  clear to you that there can be nothing which has not first been  thought of by some one. You _think_ the door must be closed and you  close it; you _think_ you must know the time and you look at the  clock; you _think_ the one hand should play more loudly than the other  and you try to do it.    Power to get things and to do things comes to us rapidly only in the  fairy-tales. In the real, beautiful, healthy world in which we live we  have to work hard and honestly for the power either to get things or  to do things. By faithful labor must we win what we want. What we do  not labor for we do not get. That is a condition of things so simple  that a child can readily understand it. But all, children and their  elders, are apt to forget it. In the life of every great man there is  a story different from that of every other great man, _but in every  one of them_ this truth about laboring for the power one has is found.    In our Talk on Listening, it was said that the sounds we hear around  us are the more easily understood if we first"]]]
