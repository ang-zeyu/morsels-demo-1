[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1366"],[0,"The Cloister and the Hearth (#4)"],[1,"he had drawn a long breath:    \"Hippocrates and Galen!\" he cried, \"'tis a soupe au vin--the restorative  of restoratives. Blessed be the nation that invented it, and the woman  that made it, and the young man who brings it to fainting folk. Have a  suck, my girl, while I relate to our young host the history and virtues  of this his sovereign compound. This corroborative, young sir, was  unknown to the ancients: we find it neither in their treatises of  medicine, nor in those popular narratives, which reveal many of their  remedies, both in chirurgery and medicine proper. Hector, in the Ilias,  if my memory does not play me false--    (Margaret. \"Alas! he's off.\")    ----was invited by one of the ladies of the poem to drink a draught of  wine; but he declined, on the plea that he was just going into battle,  and must not take aught to weaken his powers. Now, if the soupe au vin  had been known in Troy, it is clear that in declining vinum merum upon  that score, he would have added in the hexameter, 'But a soupe au vin,  madam, I will degust, and gratefully.' Not only would this have been but  common civility--a virtue no perfect commander is wanting in--but not  to have done it would have proved him a shallow and improvident person,  unfit to be trusted with the conduct of a war; for men going into a  battle need sustenance and all possible support, as is proved by this,  that foolish generals, bringing hungry soldiers to blows with full ones,  have been defeated, in all ages, by inferior numbers. The Romans lost  a great battle in the north of Italy to Hannibal, the Carthaginian, by  this neglect alone. Now, this divine elixir gives in one moment force to  the limbs and ardour to the spirits; and taken into Hector's body at  the nick of time, would, by the aid of Phoebus, Venus, and the blessed  saints, have most likely procured the Greeks a defeat. For note how  faint and weary and heart-sick I was a minute ago; well, I suck this  celestial cordial, and now behold me brave as Achilles and strong as an  eagle.\"    \"Oh, father, now? an eagle, alack!\"    \"Girl, I defy thee and all the world. Ready, I say, like a foaming  charger, to devour the space between this and Rotterdam, and strong  to combat the ills of life, even poverty and old age, which last  philosophers have called the summum malum. Negatur; unless the man's  life has been ill-spent--which, by the bye, it generally has. Now for  the moderns!\"    \"Father! dear father!\"    \"Fear me not, girl; I will be brief, unreasonably and unseasonably  brief. The soupe au vin occurs not in modern science; but this is only  one proof more, if proof were needed, that for the last few hundred  years physicians have been idiots, with their chicken-broth and their  decoction of gold, whereby they attribute the highest qualities to that  meat which has the least juice of any meat, and to that metal which  has less chemical qualities than all the metals; mountebanks! dunces!  homicides! Since, then, from these no light is to be gathered, go we  to the chroniclers; and first we find that Duguesclin, a French knight,  being about to join battle with the English--masters, at that time, of  half France, and sturdy strikers by sea and land--drank, not one, but  three soupes au vin in honour of the Blessed Trinity. This done, he  charged the islanders; and, as might have been foretold, killed a  multitude, and drove the rest into the sea. But he was only the first  of a long list of holy and hard-hitting ones who have, by this divine  restorative, been sustentated, fortified, corroborated, and consoled.\"    \"Dear father, prithee add thyself to that venerable company ere the  soup cools.\" And Margaret held the hat imploringly in both hands till he  inserted the straw once more.    This spared them the \"modern instances,\" and gave Gerard an opportunity  of telling Margaret how proud his mother would be her soup had profited  a man of learning.    \"Ay! but,\" said Margaret, \"it would like her ill to see her son give all  and take none himself. Why brought you but two straws?\"    \"Fair mistress, I hoped you would let me put my lips to your straw,  there being but two.\"    Margaret smiled and blushed. \"Never beg that you may command,\" said she.  \"The straw is not mine, 'tis yours: you cut it in yonder field.\"    \"I cut it, and that made it mine; but after that, your lip touched it,  and that made it yours.\"    \"Did it Then I will lend it you. There--now it is yours again; your lip  has touched it.\"    \"No, it belongs to us both now. Let us divide it.\"    \"By all means; you have a knife.\"    \"No, I will not cut it--that would be unlucky. I'll bite it. There I  shall keep my half: you will burn yours, once you get home, I doubt.'    \"You know me not. I waste nothing. It is odds but I make a hairpin of  it, or something.\"    This answer dashed the novice Gerard, instead of provoking him, to fresh  efforts, and he was silent. And now, the bread and soup being disposed  of, the old scholar prepared to continue his journey. Then came a  little difficulty: Gerard the adroit could not tie his ribbon again as  Catherine had tied it. Margaret, after slily eyeing his efforts for  some time, offered to help him; for at her age girls love to be coy and  tender, saucy and gentle, by turns, and she saw she had put him out of  countenance but now. Then a fair head, with its stately crown of auburn  hair, glossy and glowing through silver, bowed sweetly towards him; and,  while it ravished his eye, two white supple hands played delicately upon  the stubborn ribbon, and moulded it with soft and airy touches. Then a  heavenly thrill ran through the innocent young man, and vague glimpses  of a new world of feeling and sentiment opened on him. And these new and  exquisite sensations Margaret unwittingly prolonged: it is not natural  to her sex to hurry aught that pertains to the sacred toilet. Nay, when  the taper fingers had at last subjugated the ends of the knot, her mind  was not quite easy, till, by a manoeuvre peculiar to the female hand,  she had made her palm convex, and so applied it with a gentle pressure  to the centre of the knot--a sweet little coaxing hand-kiss, as much as  to say, \"Now be a good knot, and stay so.\" The palm-kiss was bestowed on  the ribbon, but the wearer's heart leaped to meet it.    \"There, that is how it was,\" said Margaret, and drew back to take one  last keen survey of her work; then, looking up for simple approval  of her skill, received full in her eyes a longing gaze of such ardent  adoration, as made her lower them quickly and colour all over. An  indescribable tremor seized her, and she retreated with downcast lashes  and tell-tale cheeks, and took her father's arm on the opposite side.  Gerard, blushing at having scared her away with his eyes, took the  other arm; and so the two young things went downcast and conscious, and  propped the eagle along in silence.    They entered Rotterdam by the Schiedamze Poort; and, as Gerard was  unacquainted with the town, Peter directed him the way to the Hooch  Straet, in which the Stadthouse was. He himself was going with Margaret  to his cousin, in the Ooster-Waagen Straet, so, almost on entering the  gate, their roads lay apart. They bade each other a friendly adieu, and  Gerard dived into the great town. A profound sense of solitude fell upon  him, yet the streets were crowded. Then he lamented too late that, out  of delicacy, he had not asked his late companions who they were and  where they lived.    \"Beshrew my shamefacedness!\" said he. \"But their words and their  breeding were above their means, and something did whisper me they would  not be known. I shall never see her more. Oh weary world, I hate you and  your ways. To think I must meet beauty and goodness and learning--three  pearls of price--and never see them more!\"    Falling into this sad reverie, and letting his body go where it would,  he lost his way; but presently meeting a crowd of persons all moving in  one direction, he mingled with them, for he argued they must be making  for the Stadthouse. Soon the noisy troop that contained the moody Gerard  emerged, not upon the Stadthouse, but upon a large meadow by the side of  the Maas; and then the attraction was revealed. Games of all sorts  were going on: wrestling, the game of palm, the quintain, legerdemain,  archery, tumbling, in which art, I blush to say, women as well as men  performed, to the great delectation of the company. There was also a  trained bear, who stood on his head, and marched upright, and bowed with  prodigious gravity to his master; and a hare that beat a drum, and a  cock that strutted on little stilts disdainfully. These things made  Gerard laugh now and then; but the gay scene could not really enliven  it, for his heart was not in tune with it. So hearing a young man say  to his fellow that the Duke had been in the meadow, but was gone to  the Stadthouse to entertain the burgomasters and aldermen and the  competitors for the prizes, and their friends, he suddenly remembered  he was hungry, and should like to sup with a prince. He left the  river-side, and this time he found the Hooch Straet, and it speedily led  him to the Stadthouse. But when he got there he was refused, first  at one door, then at another, till he came to the great gate of the  courtyard. It was kept by soldiers, and superintended by a pompous  major-domo, glittering in an embroidered collar and a gold chain of  office, and holding a white staff with a gold knob. There was a crowd of  persons at the gate endeavouring to soften this official rock. They came  up in turn like ripples, and retired as such in turn. It cost Gerard a  struggle to get near him, and when he was within four heads of the  gate, he saw something that made his heart beat; there was Peter, with  Margaret on his arm, soliciting humbly for entrance.    \"My cousin the alderman is not at home; they say he is here.\"    \"What is that to me, old"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13665"],[0,"War in the Garden of Eden (#4)"],[1,"was almost  invariably poor and rough. Most of the women had their babies with them,  little mites decked out in cheap finery and with their eyelids thickly  painted. The red dye from their caps streaked their faces, the flies  settled on them at will, and they had never been washed. When one thought  of the way one's own children were cared for, it seemed impossible that a  sufficient number of these little ones could survive to carry on the  race. The infant mortality must be great, though the children one sees  look fat and thriving.    Baghdad is not an old city. Although there was probably a village on the  site time out of mind, it does not come into any prominence until the  eighth century of our era. As the residence of the Abasside caliphs it  rapidly assumed an important position. The culmination of its magnificence  was reached in the end of the eighth century, under the rule of the  world-famous Haroun-el-Raschid. It long continued to be a centre of  commerce and industry, though suffering fearfully from the various sieges  and conquests which it underwent. In 1258 the Mongols, under a grandson of  the great Genghis Khan, captured the city and held it for a hundred years,  until ousted by the Tartars under Tamberlane. It was plundered in turn by  one Mongol horde after another until the Turks, under Murad the Fourth,  eventually secured it. Naturally, after being the scene of so much looting  and such massacres, there is little left of the original city of the  caliphs. Then, too, in Mesopotamia there is practically no stone, and  everything was built of brick, which readily lapses back to its original  state. For this reason the invaders easily razed a conquered town, and  Mesopotamia, so often called the \"cradle of the world,\" retains but little  trace of the races and civilizations that have succeeded each other in  ruling the land. When the Tigris was low at the end of the summer season,  we used to dig out from its bank great bricks eighteen inches square, on  which was still distinctly traced the seal of Nebuchadnezzar. These,  possibly the remnants of a quay, were all that remained of the times  before the advent of the caliphs.          II    THE TIGRIS FRONT      A few days after reaching Baghdad I left for Samarra, which was at that  time the Tigris front. I was attached to the Royal Engineers, and my  immediate commander was Major Morin, D.S.O., an able officer with an  enviable record in France and Mesopotamia. The advance army of the Tigris  was the Third Indian Army Corps, under the command of General Cobbe, a  possessor of the coveted, and invariably merited, Victoria Cross. The  Engineers were efficiently commanded by General Swiney. The seventy miles  of railroad from Baghdad to Samarra were built by the Germans, being the  only Mesopotamian portion of the much-talked-of Berlin-to-Baghdad Railway,  completed before the war. It was admirably constructed, with an excellent  road-bed, heavy rails and steel cross-ties made by Krupp. In their retreat  the Turks had been too hurried to accomplish much in the way of  destruction other than burning down a few stations and blowing up the  water-towers. The rolling-stock had been left largely intact. There were  no passenger-coaches, and you travelled either by flat or box car. Every  one followed the Indian custom of carrying with them their bedding-rolls,  and leather-covered wash-basin containing their washing-kit, as well as  one of the comfortable rhoorkhee chairs. In consequence, although for  travel by boat or train nothing was provided, there was no discomfort  entailed. The trains were fitted out with anti-aircraft guns, for the  Turkish aeroplanes occasionally tried to \"lay eggs,\" a by no means easy  affair with a moving train as a target. Whatever the reason was, and I  never succeeded in discovering it, the trains invariably left Baghdad in  the wee small hours, and as the station was on the right bank across the  river from the main town, and the boat bridges were cut during the night,  we used generally, when returning to the front, to spend the first part of  the night sleeping on the station platform. Generals or exalted staff  officers could usually succeed in having a car assigned to them, and  hauled up from the yard in time for them to go straight to bed in it.  Frequently their trip was postponed, and an omniscient sergeant-major  would indicate the car to the judiciously friendly, who could then enjoy a  solid night's sleep. The run took anywhere from eight to twelve hours; but  when sitting among the grain-bags on an open car, or comfortably ensconced  in a chair in a \"covered goods,\" with _Vingt Ans Apres_, the time passed  pleasantly enough in spite of the withering heat.    While still a good number of miles away from Samarra we would catch sight  of the sun glinting on the golden dome of the mosque, built over the cleft  where the twelfth Imam, the Imam Mahdi, is supposed to have disappeared,  and from which he is one day to reappear to establish the true faith upon  earth. Many Arabs have appeared claiming to be the Mahdi, and caused  trouble in a greater or less degree according to the extent of their  following. The most troublous one in our day was the man who besieged  Kharthoum and captured General \"Chinese\" Gordon and his men. Twenty-five  years later, when I passed through the Sudan, there were scarcely any men  of middle age left, for they had been wiped out almost to a man under the  fearful rule of the Mahdi, a rule which might have served as prototype to  the Germans in Belgium.    [Illustration: Golden Dome of Samarra]    [Illustration: Rafting down from Tekrit]    Samarra is very ancient, and has passed through periods of great  depression and equally great expansion. It was here in A.D. 363 that the  Roman Emperor Julian died from wounds received in the defeat of his forces  at Ctesiphon. The golden age lasted about forty years, beginning in 836,  when the Caliph Hutasim transferred his capital thither from Baghdad.  During that time the city extended for twenty-one miles along the  river-bank, with glorious palaces, the ruins of some of which still stand.  The present-day town has sadly shrunk from its former grandeur, but still  has an impressive look with its great walls and massive gateways. The  houses nearest the walls are in ruins or uninhabited; but in peacetime the  great reputation that the climate of Samarra possesses for salubrity draws  to it many Baghdad families who come to pass the summer months. A good  percentage of the inhabitants are Persians, for the eleventh and twelfth  Shiah Imams are buried on the site of the largest mosque. The two main  sects of Moslems are the Sunnis and the Shiahs; the former regard the  three caliphs who followed Mohammed as his legitimate successors,  whereas the latter hold them to be usurpers, and believe that his  cousin and son-in-law, Ali, husband of Fatimah, together with their sons  Husein and Hasan, are the prophet's true inheritors. Ali was assassinated  near Nejef, which city is sacred to his memory, and his son Husein was  killed at Kerbela; so these two cities are the greatest of the Shiah  shrines. The Turks belong almost without exception to the Sunni sect,  whereas the Persians and a large percentage of the Arabs inhabiting  Mesopotamia are Shiahs.    The country around Samarra is not unlike in character the southern part of  Arizona and northern Sonora. There are the same barren hills and the same  glaring heat. The soil is not sand, but a fine dust which permeates  everything, even the steel uniform-cases which I had always regarded as  proof against all conditions. The parching effect was so great that it was  not only necessary to keep all leather objects thoroughly oiled but the  covers of my books cracked and curled up until I hit upon the plan of  greasing them well also. In the alluvial lowlands trench-digging was a  simple affair, but along the hills we found a pebbly conglomerate that  gave much trouble.    Opinion was divided as to whether the Turk would attempt to advance down  the Tigris. Things had gone badly with our forces in Palestine at the  first battle of Gaza; but here we had an exceedingly strong position, and  the consensus of opinion seemed to be that the enemy would think twice  before he stormed it. Their base was at Tekrit, almost thirty miles away.  However, about ten miles distant stood a small village called Daur, which  the Turks held in considerable force. Between Daur and Samarra there was  nothing but desert, with gazelles and jackals the only permanent  inhabitants. Into this no man's land both sides sent patrols, who met in  occasional skirmishes. For reconnaissance work we used light-armored  motor-cars, known throughout the army as Lam cars, a name formed by the  initial letters of their titles. These cars were Rolls-Royces, and with  their armor-plate weighed between three and three-quarters and four tons.  They were proof against the ordinary bullet but not against the  armor-piercing. When I came out to Mesopotamia I intended to lay my plans  for a transfer to the cavalry, but after I had seen the cars at work I  changed about and asked to be seconded to that branch of the service.    A short while after my arrival our aeroplanes brought in word that the  Turks were massing at Daur, and General Cobbe decided that when they  launched forth he would go and meet them. Accordingly, we all moved out  one night, expecting to give \"Abdul,\" as the Tommies called him, a  surprise. Whether it was that we started too early and their aeroplanes  saw us, or whether they were only making a feint, we never found out; but  at all events the enemy fell back, and save for some advance-guard  skirmishing and a few prisoners, we drew a blank. We were not prepared to  attack the Daur position, and so returned to Samarra to await  developments.    Meanwhile I busied myself searching for an Arab servant."]]]
