Then honor shall weave of the laurel a crown,    That beauty shall bind on the brow of the brave.        II. INFLECTION. (18)    Inflection is a bending or sliding of the voice either upward or downward.    The upward or rising inflection is an upward slide of the voice, and is  marked by the acute accent, thus, ('); as,       Did you call'? Is he sick'?    The downward or falling inflection is a downward slide of the voice, and  is marked by the grave accent, thus, ('); as,       Where is London'? Where have you been'?    Sometimes both the rising and falling inflections are given to the same  sound. Such sounds are designated by the circumflex, thus, (v) or thus,  (^). The former is called the rising circumflex; the latter, the falling  circumflex; as,      But nobody can bear the death of Clodius.    When several successive syllables are uttered without either the upward or  downward slide, they are said to be uttered in a monotone, which is marked  thus, (--); as,      Roll on, thou deep and dark blue Ocean--roll    EXAMPLES. (19)      Does he read correctly' or incorrectly'?    In reading this sentence, the voice should slide somewhat as represented  in the following diagram:      Does he read cor-rectly or incorrect-ly?        If you said vinegar, I said sugar,    To be read thus:      If you said vinegar, I said sugar,        If you said yes, I said no.    To be read thus:      If you said yes, I said no.        What! did he say no?    To be read thus:      What! did he say no?        He did'; he said no',    To be read thus;      He did; he said no.        Did he do it voluntarily', or involuntarily'?    To be read thus:      Did he do it voluntarily, or involuntarily?        He did it voluntarily', not involuntarily',    To be read thus:      He did it voluntarily, not involuntarily.        EXERCISES. (20)    Do they act prudently', or imprudently'?    Are they at home', or abroad'?    Did you say Europe', or Asia'?    Is he rich', or poor'?    He said pain', not pain'.    Are you engaged', or at leisure'?    Shall I say plain', or pain'?    He went home' not abroad'.    Does he say able', or table'?    He said hazy' not lazy'?    Must I say flat', or flat'?    You should say flat' not flat'.    My father', must I stay'?    Oh! but he paused upon the brink.    It shall go hard with me, but I shall use the weapon.    Heard ye those loud contending waves,    That shook Cecropia's pillar'd state'?  Saw ye the mighty from their graves    Look up', and tremble at your fate'?    First' Fear', his hand, its skill to try',    Amid the chords bewildered laid';  And back recoiled', he knew not why'    E'en at the sound himself had made'.      Where be your gibes' now? your gambols'? your songs'? your flashes of  merriment, that were wont to set the table on a roar'?    Thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is  Holy; \"I dwell in the high and holy place.\"        FALLING INFLECTION. (21)    RULE I.--Sentences, and parts of sentences which make complete sense in  themselves, require the falling inflection.      EXAMPLES. (21)    1. By virtue we secure happiness'.    2. For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven': I will  exalt my throne above the stars of God':  I will sit, also, upon the mount  of the congregation, in the sides of the north'.    3. The wind and the rain are over'; calm is the noon of the day\\: the  clouds are divided in heaven'; over the green hills flies the inconstant  sun'; red through the stormy vale comes down the stream'.    4. This proposition was, however, rejected,' and not merely rejected, but  rejected with insult'.    Exception.--Emphasis sometimes reverses this rule, and requires the rising  inflection, apparently for the purpose of calling attention to the idea of  an unusual manner of expressing it.    EXAMPLES. (21)    1. I should not like to ride in that car'.  2. Look out! A man was drowned there yesterday'.  3. Presumptuous man! the gods' take care of Cato',      RULE II.--The language of emphasis generally requires the falling  inflection.    EXAMPLES. (22)    1. Charge', Chester, charge'; on', Stanley, on'.    2. Were I an American, as I am an Englishman, while a single' foreign  troop' remained' in my country, I would never' lay down my arms'--never',  never', never.'    3. Does anyone suppose that the payment of twenty shillings, would have  ruined Mr. Hampden's fortune? No'. But the payment of half twenty  shillings, on the principle' it was demanded, would have made him a  slave'.    4. I insist' upon this point': I urge' you to it; I press' it, demand' it.    5. All that I have', all that I am', and all that I hope' in this life, I  am now ready', here, to stake' upon it.      RULE III.--Interrogative sentences and members of sentences, which  can not be answered by yes or no, generally require the falling inflection.    EXAMPLE. (22)    1. How many books did he purchase'?    2. Why reason ye these things in your hearts'?    3. What see' you, that you frown so heavily to-day'?    4. Ah! what is that flame which now bursts on his eye'?    5. Whence this pleasing hope', this fond desire',     This longing after immortality'?      Exception.--When questions usually requiring  the falling inflection are  emphatic or repeated, they take the rising inflection.      EXAMPLES. (22)    1. Where did you say he had gone'?    2. To whom did you say the blame was to be imputed'?    3. What is' he? A knave. What' is he? A knave, I say.      RISING INFLECTION. (23)    RULE IV.--The rising inflection is generally used where the sense is  dependent or incomplete.    REMARK.--This inflection is generally very slight, requiring an acute and  educated ear to discern it, and it is difficult to teach pupils to  distinguish it, though they constantly use it. Care should be taken not to  exaggerate it.    EXAMPLES. (23)    1. Nature being exhausted', he quietly resigned himself to his fate.    2. A chieftain to the Highlands bound',     Cries', \"Boatman, do not tarry!\"    3. As he spoke without fear of consequences', so his actions were  marked with the most unbending resolution,    4. Speaking in the open air', at the top of the voice', is an admirable  exercise.    5. If then, his Providence' out of our evil, seek to bring forth good', our  labor must be to prevent that end.    6. He', born for the universe', narrowed his mind,     And to party gave up what was meant for mankind.      REMARK.--The names of persons or things addressed, when not used  emphatically, are included in this rule.    7. Brother', give me thy hand; and, gentle Warwick!,     Let me embrace thee in my weary arms.    8. O Lancaster', I fear thy overthrow.    9. Ye crags' and peaks', I'm with you once again.    Exception 1.--Relative emphasis often reverses this and the first rule,  because emphasis is here expressed in part by changing the usual  inflections.    EXAMPLES. (23)    1. If you care not for your property', you surely value your life'.    2. If you will not labor for your own' advancement, you should regard  that of your children'.    3. It is your place to obey', not to command'.    4. Though by that course he should not destroy his reputation', he will  lose all self-respect'.    Exception 2.--The names of persons addressed in a formal speech, or  when used emphatically, have the falling inflection.      EXAMPLES. (24)    1. Romans, countrymen, and lovers', hear me for my cause, etc.    2. Gentlemen of the jury', I solicit your attention, etc.    3. O Hubert', Hubert', save me from these men.      RULE V.--Negative sentences and parts of sentences, usually require  the rising inflection.    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16767"],[0,"Half-hours with the Telescope (#4)"],[1," for granted that this was so. But the  experiments of Hall and the Dollonds showed that there is no such strict  proportionality between the dispersive and refractive powers of  different kinds of glass. It accordingly becomes possible to correct the  chromatic aberration of one glass by superadding that of another.    [Illustration: _Fig. 4._]    This is effected by combining, as shown in fig. 4, a convex lens of  _crown_ glass with a concave lens of _flint_ glass, the convex lens  being placed nearest to the object. A little colour still remains, but  not enough to interfere seriously with the distinctness of the image.    But even if the image formed by the object-glass were perfect, yet this  image, viewed through a single convex lens of short focus placed as in  fig. 1, would appear curved, indistinct, coloured, and also _distorted_,  because viewed by pencils of light which do not pass through the centre  of the eye-glass. These effects can be diminished (but not entirely  removed _together_) by using an _eye-piece_ consisting of two lenses  instead of a single eye-glass. The two forms of eye-piece most commonly  employed are exhibited in figs. 5 and 6. Fig. 5 is Huyghens' eye-piece,  called also the _negative_ eye-piece, because a real image is formed  _behind_ the _field-glass_ (the lens which lies nearest to the  object-glass). Fig. 6 represents Ramsden's eye-piece, called also the  _positive_ eye-piece, because the real image formed by the object-glass  lies _in front of_ the field-glass.    [Illustration: _Fig. 5._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 6._]    The course of a slightly oblique pencil through either eye-piece is  exhibited in the figures. The lenses are usually plano-convex, the  convexities being turned towards the object-glass in the negative  eye-piece, and towards each other in the positive eye-piece. Coddington  has shown, however, that the best forms for the lenses of the negative  eye-piece are those shown in fig. 5.    The negative eye-piece, being achromatic, is commonly employed in all  observations requiring distinct vision only. But as it is clearly unfit  for observations requiring micrometrical measurement, or reference to  fixed lines at the focus of the object-glass, the positive eye-piece is  used for these purposes.    For observing objects at great elevations the diagonal eye-tube is  often convenient. Its construction is shown in fig. 7. ABC is a totally  reflecting prism of glass. The rays from the object-glass fall on the  face AB, are totally reflected on the face BC, and emerge through the  face AC. In using this eye-piece, it must be remembered that it  lengthens the sliding eye-tube, which must therefore be thrust further  in, or the object will not be seen in focus. There is an arrangement by  which the change of direction is made to take place between the two  glasses of the eye-piece. With this arrangement (known as the _diagonal  eye-piece_) no adjustment of the eye-tube is required. However, for  amateurs' telescopes the more convenient arrangement is the diagonal  eye-tube, since it enables the observer to apply any eye-piece he  chooses, just as with the simple sliding eye-tube.    [Illustration: _Fig. 7._]    We come next to the important question of the _mounting_ of our  telescope.    The best known, and, in some respects, the simplest method of  mounting a telescope for general observation is that known as the  _altitude-and-azimuth_ mounting. In this method the telescope is  pointed towards an object by two motions,--one giving the tube the  required _altitude_ (or elevation), the other giving it the required  _azimuth_ (or direction as respects the compass points).    For small alt-azimuths the ordinary pillar-and-claw stand is  sufficiently steady. For larger instruments other arrangements are  needed, both to give the telescope steadiness, and to supply slow  movements in altitude and azimuth. The student will find no difficulty  in understanding the arrangement of sliding-tubes and rack-work commonly  adopted. This arrangement seems to me to be in many respects defective,  however. The slow movement in altitude is not uniform, but varies in  effect according to the elevation of the object observed. It is also  limited in range; and quite a little series of operations has to be gone  through when it is required to direct the telescope towards a new  quarter of the heavens. However expert the observer may become by  practice in effecting these operations, they necessarily take up some  time (performed as they must be in the dark, or by the light of a small  lantern), and during this time it often happens that a favourable  opportunity for observation is lost.    These disadvantages are obviated when the telescope is mounted in such a  manner as is exhibited in fig. 8, which represents a telescope of my own  construction. The slow movement in altitude is given by rotating the rod  _he_, the endless screw in which turns the small wheel at _b_, whose  axle in turn bears a pinion-wheel working in the teeth of the quadrant  _a_. The slow movement in azimuth is given in like manner by rotating  the rod _h'e'_, the lantern-wheel at the end of which turns a  crown-wheel on whose axle is a pinion-wheel working in the teeth of the  circle _c_. The casings at _e_ and _e'_, in which the rods _he_ and  _h'e'_ respectively work, are so fastened by elastic cords that an  upward pressure on the handle _h_, or a downward pressure on the handle  _h'_, at once releases the endless screw or the crown-wheel  respectively, so that the telescope can be swept at once through any  desired angle in altitude or azimuth. This method of mounting has other  advantages; the handles are conveniently situated and constant in  position; also, as they do not work directly on the telescope, they can  be turned without setting the tube in vibration.    [Illustration: _Fig. 8._]    I do not recommend the mounting to be exactly as shown in fig. 8. That  method is much too expensive for an alt-azimuth. But a simple  arrangement of belted wheels in place of the toothed wheels _a_ and _c_  might very readily be prepared by the ingenious amateur telescopist; and  I feel certain that the comfort and convenience of the arrangement would  amply repay him for the labour it would cost him. My own  telescope--though the large toothed-wheel and the quadrant were made  inconveniently heavy (through a mistake of the workman who constructed  the instrument)--worked as easily and almost as conveniently as an  equatorial.    Still, it is well for the observer who wishes systematically to survey  the heavens--and who can afford the expense--to obtain a well-mounted  _equatorial_. In this method of mounting, the main axis is directed to  the pole of the heavens; the other axis, at right angles to the first,  carries the telescope-tube. One of the many methods adopted for mounting  equatorials is that exhibited--with the omission of some minor  details--in fig. 9. _a_ is the polar axis, _b_ is the axis (called the  declination axis) which bears the telescope. The circles _c_ and _d_  serve to indicate, by means of verniers revolving with the axes, the  motion of the telescope in right ascension and declination,  respectively. The weight _w_ serves to counterpoise the telescope, and  the screws _s_, _s_, _s_, _s_, serve to adjust the instrument so that  the polar axis shall be in its proper position. The advantage gained by  the equatorial method of mounting is that only one motion is required to  follow a star. Owing to the diurnal rotation of the earth, the stars  appear to move uniformly in circles parallel to the celestial equator;  and it is clear that a star so moving will be kept in the field of  view, if the telescope, once directed to the star, be made to revolve  uniformly and at a proper rate round the polar axis.    [Illustration: _Fig. 9._]    The equatorial can be directed by means of the circles _c_ and _d_ to  any celestial object whose right ascension and declination are known. On  the other hand, to bring an object into the field of view of an  alt-azimuth, it is necessary, either that the object itself should be  visible to the naked eye, or else that the position of the object should  be pretty accurately learned from star-maps, so that it may be picked up  by the alt-azimuth after a little searching. A small telescope called a  _finder_ is usually attached to all powerful telescopes intended for  general observation. The finder has a large field of view, and is  adjusted so as to have its axis parallel to that of the large telescope.  Thus a star brought to the centre of the large field of the finder  (indicated by the intersection of two lines placed at the focus of the  eye-glass) is at, or very near, the centre of the small field of the  large telescope.    If a telescope has no finder, it will be easy for the student to  construct one for himself, and will be a useful exercise in optics. Two  convex lenses not very different in size from those shown in fig. 1, and  placed as there shown--the distance between them being the sum of the  focal lengths of the two glasses--in a small tube of card, wood, or tin,  will serve the purpose of a finder for a small telescope. It can be  attached by wires to the telescope-tube, and adjusted each night before  commencing observation. The adjustment is thus managed:--a low power  being applied to the telescope, the tube is turned towards a bright  star; this is easily effected with a low power; then the finder is to be  fixed, by means of its wires, in such a position that the star shall be  in the centre of the field of the finder when also in the centre of the  telescope's field. When this has been done, the finder will greatly help  the observations of the evening; since with high powers much time would  be wasted in bringing an object into the field of view of the telescope  without the aid of a finder. Yet more time would be wasted in the case  of"]]]
