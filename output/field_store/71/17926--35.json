As stated in a previous chapter, all of the Indian tribes  occupying the region in the vicinity of the Yosemite Valley were  more or less affiliated by blood and intermarriage and resembled  each other in their customs, characteristics and religious  beliefs. What is said, therefore, on these subjects in the  following pages, will be understood to apply generally to all of  the tribes which have been mentioned as inhabiting this region,  although, of course, minor differences did exist, principally due  to environment. As in the case of all primitive peoples, their  mode of life, food supply, etc., were largely determined by  natural conditions, and the tribes living in the warm foot-hills  differed somewhat in these respects from those dwelling higher in  the mountains.      DIVISION OF TERRITORY.    In their original tribal settlements, at the time the first  pioneer whites came among them, the Indians had well defined or  understood boundary lines, between the territories claimed by  each tribe for their exclusive use in hunting game and gathering  means of support; and any trespassing on the domain of others was  likely to cause trouble. This arrangement, however, did not apply  to the higher ranges of the Sierras, which were considered common  hunting ground.      COMMERCE AMONG THE TRIBES.    As there was a difference in the natural products and resources  of different sections of the country, there was a system of  reciprocal trade in the exchange of the different desirable  commodities. Sometimes commerce between tribes extended for a  long distance, as, for instance, the Indians on the western side  of the Sierra Nevada Mountains were entirely dependent upon the  Pai-utes _(Pye-yutes')_ on the eastern side for the obsidian, a  kind of volcanic glass, from which they made the points for their  most deadly arrows, used in hunting large game or when in mortal  combat with their enemies. They were also dependent upon the  Pai-utes for their supply of salt for domestic use, which came in  solid blocks as quarried from salt mines, said to be two days'  travel on foot from Mono Lake.    From the Indians at or near the Catholic Missions to the South,  on the Pacific Coast, they got their hunting knives of iron or  steel, and sea shells of various kinds, for personal or dress  ornaments, and also to be used as money. From the same source  they obtained beads of various forms, sizes and colors, cheap  jewelry and other fancy articles, a few blankets, and pieces of  red bunting, strips of which the chiefs and head men wore around  their heads as badges, indicating their official positions.      COMMUNICATION.    They had a very efficient system of quickly spreading important  news by relays of special couriers, who took the news to the  first stations or tribes in different directions, where others  took the verbal dispatches and ran to the next station, and so  on, so that all tribes within an area of a hundred miles would  get the good or bad tidings within a few hours. In this manner  important communication was kept up between the different tribes.  They also had well organized signal systems, by fires in the  night and smoke by day, on high points of observation--variations  in the lights (either steady, bright or flashing) indicating  somewhat the character of the tidings thus given.      DWELLINGS.    Their winter huts, or _o'-chums_, as they termed them, were  invariably of a conical form, made with small poles, and covered  with the bark of the incense cedar (_Libocedrus decurrens_). A  few poles ten or twelve feet long were set in the ground around  an area of about twelve feet in diameter, with their tops  inclined together. The outside was then closely covered with long  strips of the cedar bark, making it perfectly water-tight. An  opening was left on the south side for an entrance, which could  be readily closed with a portable door. An opening was also left  at the top for the escape of the smoke, a fire being kindled in  the center inside.    [Illustration: _Drawing by Jorgensen_.  INDIAN O'-CHUM.  This style of house, made of cedar poles covered with bark, is  more easily heated than any other form of dwelling known.]    One of these huts would hold a family of a half-dozen persons,  with all their household property, dogs included; and there is  no other form of a single-room dwelling that can be kept warm  and comfortable in cold weather with so little fire, as this  Indian _o'-chum._    Their under-bedding usually consisted of the skins of bears,  deer, antelope or elk, and the top covering was a blanket or robe  made of the skins of small fur-bearing animals, such as rabbits,  hares, wildcats and foxes. The skins were cut in narrow strips,  which were loosely twisted so as to bring the fur entirely around  on the outside, and then woven into a warp of strong twine made  of the fine, tough, fibrous bark of a variety of milkweed  (_Asclepias speciosa_). These fur robes were very warm, and were  also used as wraps when traveling in cold weather.    During the warm summer season they generally lived outside in  brush arbors, and used their _o'-chums_ as storage places.      CLOTHING.    Their clothing was very simple and scant, before being initiated  into the use of a more ample and complete style of covering while  living at the reservations. The ordinary full complement of dress  for a man (_Nung'-ah_) was simply a breech-clout, or short  hip-skirt made of skins; that for a woman (_O'-hoh_) was a  skirt reaching from the waist to the knees, made of dressed  deerskin finished at the bottom with a slit fringe, and sometimes  decorated with various fancy ornaments. Both men and women  frequently wore moccasins made of dressed deer or elk skin. Young  children generally went entirely nude.    [Illustration: _Drawing by Jorgensen_.  YOSEMITE MAIDEN IN NATIVE DRESS.  This buckskin costume has now been replaced by the unpicturesque  calico of civilization.]      CHARACTERISTICS.    The Indians of the various tribes in this part of the Sierras  vary somewhat in physical characteristics, but in general are of  medium height, strong, lean and agile, and the men are usually  fine specimens of manhood. They are rather light in color, but  frequently rub their bodies with some kind of oil, which gives  the flesh a much redder and more glossy appearance. The hair is  black and straight, and the eyes are black and deep set. The  beard is sparse, and in former times was not allowed to grow at  all, each hair being pulled out with a rude kind of tweezers.  They are naturally of a gentle and friendly disposition, but  their experience with the white race has made them distant and  uncommunicative to strangers.    Most of the older Indians still cling to their old customs and  manner of living, and are very slow to learn or talk our  language, but the younger ones are striving to live like the  white people, and seem proud to adopt our style of dress and  manner of cooking. They all speak our language plainly, and some  few of them attend the public schools when living near by, and  acquire very readily the common rudiments of an education.    Their style of architecture is in a state of transition, like  themselves. Their old _o'-chum_ form of dwelling is now very  seldom seen--a rude building of more roomy and modern design  having taken its place.    All the able-bodied men are ready and willing to work at any kind  of common labor, when they have an opportunity, and have learned  to want nearly the same amount of pay as a white man for the same  work.    As a rule, they are trustworthy, and when confidence is placed in  their honesty it is very rarely betrayed. During nearly the past  fifty years, a great many thousands of people have visited the  Yosemite Valley with their own camping outfits, and, during the  day, and often all night, are absent on distant trips of  observation, with no one left in charge of camp, yet there has  never to my knowledge been an instance of anything being stolen  or molested by Indians. There are, however, some dishonest  Indians, who will steal from their own people, and some times,  when a long distance from their own camp, they may steal from the  whites. A few, if they can get whisky, through the aid of some  white person, will become drunk and fight among themselves, and  occasionally one of them may be killed; but, as a rule, they are  peaceful and orderly, and hold sacred the promise made to the  Indian Commissioners by the old tribal chiefs, when released from  confinement on the reservations, that they would forever keep the  peace, and never again make war against the white people.          Chapter Four.    SOURCES OF FOOD SUPPLY.      The food supply of the Sierra Indians was extensive and abundant,  consisting of the flesh of deer, antelope, elk and mustang  horses, together with fish, water-fowls, birds, acorns, berries,  pine nuts, esculent herbage and the tuberous roots of certain  plants, all of which were easily obtained, even with their simple  and limited means of securing them. Mushrooms, fungi,  grasshoppers, worms and the larvae of ants and other insects,  were also eaten, and some of these articles were considered great  delicacies.      HUNTING.    Their main effective weapons for hunting large game were their  bows and obsidian-pointed arrows. Their manner of hunting was  either by the stealthy still hunt, or a general turn-out,  surrounding a large area of favorable country and driving to a  common center, where at close range the hunters could sometimes  make an extensive slaughter.    [Illustration: _Drawing by Jorgensen._  A YOSEMITE HUNTER. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1658"],[0,"Phaedo (#4)"],[1,"nfusion. We  certainly do not mean by the immortality of the soul the immortality of  fame, which whether worth having or not can only be ascribed to a very  select class of the whole race of mankind, and even the interest in  these few is comparatively short-lived. To have been a benefactor to the  world, whether in a higher or a lower sphere of life and thought, is a  great thing: to have the reputation of being one, when men have passed  out of the sphere of earthly praise or blame, is hardly worthy of  consideration. The memory of a great man, so far from being immortal,  is really limited to his own generation:--so long as his friends or his  disciples are alive, so long as his books continue to be read, so long  as his political or military successes fill a page in the history of  his country. The praises which are bestowed upon him at his death hardly  last longer than the flowers which are strewed upon his coffin or the  'immortelles' which are laid upon his tomb. Literature makes the most  of its heroes, but the true man is well aware that far from enjoying an  immortality of fame, in a generation or two, or even in a much shorter  time, he will be forgotten and the world will get on without him.    4. Modern philosophy is perplexed at this whole question, which is  sometimes fairly given up and handed over to the realm of faith. The  perplexity should not be forgotten by us when we attempt to submit the  Phaedo of Plato to the requirements of logic. For what idea can we form  of the soul when separated from the body? Or how can the soul be united  with the body and still be independent? Is the soul related to the  body as the ideal to the real, or as the whole to the parts, or as the  subject to the object, or as the cause to the effect, or as the end to  the means? Shall we say with Aristotle, that the soul is the entelechy  or form of an organized living body? or with Plato, that she has a life  of her own? Is the Pythagorean image of the harmony, or that of the  monad, the truer expression? Is the soul related to the body as sight to  the eye, or as the boatman to his boat? (Arist. de Anim.) And in  another state of being is the soul to be conceived of as vanishing into  infinity, hardly possessing an existence which she can call her own,  as in the pantheistic system of Spinoza: or as an individual informing  another body and entering into new relations, but retaining her own  character? (Compare Gorgias.) Or is the opposition of soul and body a  mere illusion, and the true self neither soul nor body, but the union  of the two in the 'I' which is above them? And is death the assertion  of this individuality in the higher nature, and the falling away into  nothingness of the lower? Or are we vainly attempting to pass  the boundaries of human thought? The body and the soul seem to be  inseparable, not only in fact, but in our conceptions of them; and any  philosophy which too closely unites them, or too widely separates them,  either in this life or in another, disturbs the balance of human nature.  No thinker has perfectly adjusted them, or been entirely consistent with  himself in describing their relation to one another. Nor can we  wonder that Plato in the infancy of human thought should have confused  mythology and philosophy, or have mistaken verbal arguments for real  ones.    5. Again, believing in the immortality of the soul, we must still  ask the question of Socrates, 'What is that which we suppose to be  immortal?' Is it the personal and individual element in us, or the  spiritual and universal? Is it the principle of knowledge or of  goodness, or the union of the two? Is it the mere force of life which is  determined to be, or the consciousness of self which cannot be got rid  of, or the fire of genius which refuses to be extinguished? Or is there  a hidden being which is allied to the Author of all existence, who is  because he is perfect, and to whom our ideas of perfection give us a  title to belong? Whatever answer is given by us to these questions,  there still remains the necessity of allowing the permanence of evil, if  not for ever, at any rate for a time, in order that the wicked 'may not  have too good a bargain.' For the annihilation of evil at death, or the  eternal duration of it, seem to involve equal difficulties in the moral  government of the universe. Sometimes we are led by our feelings, rather  than by our reason, to think of the good and wise only as existing in  another life. Why should the mean, the weak, the idiot, the infant,  the herd of men who have never in any proper sense the use of reason,  reappear with blinking eyes in the light of another world? But our  second thought is that the hope of humanity is a common one, and that  all or none will be partakers of immortality. Reason does not allow us  to suppose that we have any greater claims than others, and experience  may often reveal to us unexpected flashes of the higher nature in  those whom we had despised. Why should the wicked suffer any more than  ourselves? had we been placed in their circumstances should we have been  any better than they? The worst of men are objects of pity rather than  of anger to the philanthropist; must they not be equally such to divine  benevolence? Even more than the good they have need of another life; not  that they may be punished, but that they may be educated. These are  a few of the reflections which arise in our minds when we attempt to  assign any form to our conceptions of a future state.    There are some other questions which are disturbing to us because we  have no answer to them. What is to become of the animals in a future  state? Have we not seen dogs more faithful and intelligent than men,  and men who are more stupid and brutal than any animals? Does their life  cease at death, or is there some 'better thing reserved' also for  them? They may be said to have a shadow or imitation of morality, and  imperfect moral claims upon the benevolence of man and upon the justice  of God. We cannot think of the least or lowest of them, the insect, the  bird, the inhabitants of the sea or the desert, as having any place in  a future world, and if not all, why should those who are specially  attached to man be deemed worthy of any exceptional privilege? When we  reason about such a subject, almost at once we degenerate into nonsense.  It is a passing thought which has no real hold on the mind. We may argue  for the existence of animals in a future state from the attributes of  God, or from texts of Scripture ('Are not two sparrows sold for one  farthing?' etc.), but the truth is that we are only filling up the void  of another world with our own fancies. Again, we often talk about  the origin of evil, that great bugbear of theologians, by which they  frighten us into believing any superstition. What answer can be made  to the old commonplace, 'Is not God the author of evil, if he knowingly  permitted, but could have prevented it?' Even if we assume that the  inequalities of this life are rectified by some transposition of human  beings in another, still the existence of the very least evil if it  could have been avoided, seems to be at variance with the love and  justice of God. And so we arrive at the conclusion that we are carrying  logic too far, and that the attempt to frame the world according to a  rule of divine perfection is opposed to experience and had better be  given up. The case of the animals is our own. We must admit that the  Divine Being, although perfect himself, has placed us in a state of life  in which we may work together with him for good, but we are very far  from having attained to it.    6. Again, ideas must be given through something; and we are always prone  to argue about the soul from analogies of outward things which may serve  to embody our thoughts, but are also partly delusive. For we cannot  reason from the natural to the spiritual, or from the outward to the  inward. The progress of physiological science, without bringing us  nearer to the great secret, has tended to remove some erroneous notions  respecting the relations of body and mind, and in this we have the  advantage of the ancients. But no one imagines that any seed of  immortality is to be discerned in our mortal frames. Most people have  been content to rest their belief in another life on the agreement of  the more enlightened part of mankind, and on the inseparable connection  of such a doctrine with the existence of a God--also in a less degree  on the impossibility of doubting about the continued existence of those  whom we love and reverence in this world. And after all has been  said, the figure, the analogy, the argument, are felt to be only  approximations in different forms to an expression of the common  sentiment of the human heart. That we shall live again is far more  certain than that we shall take any particular form of life.    7. When we speak of the immortality of the soul, we must ask further  what we mean by the word immortality. For of the duration of a living  being in countless ages we can form no conception; far less than a three  years' old child of the whole of life. The naked eye might as well try  to see the furthest star in the infinity of heaven. Whether time and  space really exist when we take away the limits of them may be doubted;  at any rate the thought of them when unlimited us so overwhelming to us  as to lose all distinctness. Philosophers have spoken of them as forms  of the human mind, but what is the mind without them? As then infinite  time, or an existence out of time, which are the only possible  explanations of eternal duration, are equally inconceivable to us, let  us substitute for them a hundred or a thousand years after death, and  ask not what will be our employment in eternity, but what will happen to  us in that definite portion of time; or what is now happening to those  who passed out of life a hundred or a thousand"]]]
