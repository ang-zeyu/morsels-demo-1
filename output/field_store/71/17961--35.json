But this       Doctor, notwithstanding that his owne confession appeareth       remaining in recorde under his owne hande-writing, and the       same thereunto fixed in the presence of the King's majestie,       and sundrie of his councell, yet did he utterly denie the       same. Whereupon the Kinges majestie, perceiving his       stubbourne wilfulnesse, conceived and imagined that in the       time of his absence hee had entered into newe conference and       league with the devill, his master, and that hee had beene       agayne newly marked, for the which he was narrowly searched;       but it coulde not in anie wice be founde; yet, for more       tryall of him to make him confesse, hee was commaunded to       have a most straunge torment, which was done in this manner       following: His nailes upon all his fingers were riven and       pulled off with an instrument called in Scottish a turkas,       which in England wee call a payre of pincers, and under       everie nayle there was thrust in two needles over, even up       to the heads; at all which tormentes notwithstanding the       Doctor never shronke anie whit, neither woulde he then       confesse it the sooner for all the tortures inflicted upon       him. Then was hee, with all convenient speed, by       commandement, convaied againe to the torment of the bootes,       wherein he continued a long time, and did abide so many       blowes in them, that the legges were crusht and beaten       together as small as might bee, and the bones and flesh so       bruised that the blood and marrow spouted forth in great       abundance, whereby they were made unserviceable for ever;       and notwithstanding all those grievous paines and cruell       torments, hee would not confess anie thing; so deeply had       the devill entered into his heart, that hee utterly denied       all that which he had before avouched, and would saie       nothing thereunto but this, that what he had done and sayde       before, was onely done and sayde for fear of paynes which he       had endured. After this horrible treatment the wretched man       was strangled and burnt.    The following list gives a few--and only a few--of the direful results  to which this widespread superstition led. The instances are chiefly  taken from Dr. Reville's _History of the Devil_, and Haydn's  well-known _Dictionary of Dates_:--         At Toulouse a noble lady, fifty-six years of age, named       Angela de Labarete, was the first who was burnt as a       sorceress, in which special quality she formed part of the       great _auto-da-fe_ which took place in that city in the year       1275; at Carcasonne, from 1320 to 1350, more than four       hundred executions for witchcraft are on record; in 1309       many Templars were burnt at Paris for witchcraft; Joan of       Arc was burnt as a witch at Rouen, May 30th, 1431; in 1484       Pope Innocent VIII. issued a bull against witchcraft,       causing persecutions to break out in all parts of       Christendom; during three months of the year 1515, about       five hundred witches were burnt at Geneva; in 1524 many       persons were burnt for the same crime in the Diocese of       Como; about the year 1520 a great number suffered in France,       and one sorcercer confessed to having 1,200 associates; from       1580 to 1595--a period of fifteen years--about nine hundred       witches were burnt in Lorraine; between 1627 and 1629, no       fewer than one hundred and fifty-seven persons, old and       young, and of all ranks, were burnt at Wurtzburg, in       Bavaria; in 1634 a clerk named Urbain Grandier, who was       parish priest at Loudon, was burnt on a charge of having       bewitched a whole convent of Ursuline nuns; in 1654 twenty       poor women were put to death as witches in Brittany; in       1648-9 serious disturbances on account of witchcraft took       place in Massachusetts; and in 1683 dreadful persecutions       raged in Pennsylvania from the same cause; in 1692, at       Salem, in New England, nineteen persons were hanged by the       Puritans for witchcraft, and eight more were condemned,       while fifty others confessed themselves to be witches, and       were pardoned; in 1657 the witch-judge Nicholas Remy boasted       of having burnt nine hundred persons in fifteen years; in       one German principality alone, at least two hundred and       forty-two persons were burnt between 1646 and 1651,       including many children from one to six years of age; in       1749 Maria Renata was burnt at Wurtzburg for witchcraft; on       January 17th, 1775, nine old women were burnt at Kalish, in       Poland, on a charge of having bewitched and rendered       unfruitful the lands belonging to the palatinate; at       Landshut, in Bavaria, in 1756, a young girl of thirteen       years was convicted of impure intercourse with the Devil and       put to death. There were also executions for sorcery at       Seville, in Spain, in 1781, and at Glarus, in Switzerland,       in 1783; while even as late as December 15th, 1802, five       women were condemned to death for sorcery at Patna, in the       Bengal Presidency, by the Brahmins, and were all executed.         IN ENGLAND the record of Witchcraft is also a       melancholy chapter. A statute was enacted declaring all       witchcraft and sorcery to be felony without benefit of       clergy, 33 Henry VIII. 1541; and again 5 Elizabeth, 1562,       and 1 James I. 1603. The 73rd Canon of the Church, 1603,       prohibits the Clergy from casting out devils. Barrington       estimates the judicial murders for witchcraft in England,       during two hundred years, at 30,000; Matthew Hopkins, the       \"witch-finder,\" caused the judicial murder of about one       hundred persons in Essex, Norfolk, and Suffolk, 1645-7; Sir       Matthew Hale burnt two persons for witchcraft in 1664; about       1676 seventeen or eighteen persons were burnt as witches at       St. Osyths, in Essex; in 1705 two pretended witches were       executed at Northampton, and five others seven years       afterwards; in 1716, a Mrs. Hicks, and her daughter, a       little girl of nine years old, are said to have been hanged       as witches at Huntingdon, but of this there seems to be some       doubt. The last really authentic trial in England for       witchcraft took place in 1712, when the jury convicted an       old woman named Jane Wenham, of Walkerne, a little village       in the north of Hertfordshire, and she was sentenced to be       hanged. The judge, however, quietly procured a reprieve for       her, and a kind-hearted gentleman in the neighbourhood gave       her a cottage to live in, where she ended her days in peace.       With regard to the mobbing of reputed sorcerers, it is       recorded that in the year 1628, Dr. Lamb, a so-called       wizard, who had been under the protection of the Duke of       Buckingham, was torn to pieces by a London mob. While even       as late as April 22nd, 1751, a wild and tossing rabble of       about 5,000 persons beset and broke into the work-house at       Tring, in Hertfordshire, where seizing Luke Osborne and his       wife, two inoffensive old people suspected of witchcraft,       they ducked them in a pond till the old woman died. After       which, her corpse was put to bed to her husband by the mob,       of whom only one person--a chimney-sweeper named Colley, who       was the ringleader--was brought to trial and hanged for the       detestable outrage.         The laws against witchcraft in England had lain dormant for       many years, when an ignorant person attempted to revive them       by filing a bill against a poor old woman in Surrey, accused       as a witch; this led to the repeal of the laws by the       statute 10 George II. 1736. Credulity in witchcraft,       however, still lingers in some of the country districts of       the United Kingdom. On September 4th, 1863, a poor old       paralysed Frenchman died in consequence of having been       ducked as a wizard at Castle Hedingham, in Essex, and       similar cases have since occurred; while on September 17th,       1875,--only ten years ago--an old woman named Ann Turner,       was killed as a witch, by a half-insane man, at Long       Compton, Warwickshire.         IN SCOTLAND, thousands of persons were burnt for       witchcraft within a period of about a hundred years, in the       fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Among the victims were       persons of the highest rank, while all orders of the state       concurred. James I. even caused a whole assize to be       prosecuted because of an acquittal; the king published his       work on _Daemonologie_, in Edinburgh, in 1597; the last       sufferer for witchcraft in Scotland was at Dornoch, in 1722.

The Queen spoke several times to her son, to learn after what manner he  was passing his time, and told him that in this he ought in duty to  satisfy her. But he never dared to trust her with his secret; he feared  her, though he loved her, for she was of the race of the Ogres, and the  King married her for her vast riches alone. It was even whispered about  the Court that she had Ogreish inclinations, and that, whenever she saw  little children passing by, she had all the difficulty in the world to  prevent herself from falling upon them. And so the Prince would never  tell her one word.    But when the King was dead, which happened about two years afterward,  and he saw himself lord and master, he openly declared his marriage: and  he went in great state to conduct his Queen to the palace. They made a  magnificent entry into the capital city, she riding between her two  children.    Soon after, the King made war on Emperor Cantalabutte, his neighbor. He  left the government of the kingdom to the Queen, his mother, and  earnestly commended his wife and children to her care. He was obliged to  carry on the war all the summer, and as soon as he left, the  Queen-mother sent her daughter-in-law and her children to a country  house among the woods, that she might with the more ease gratify her  horrible longing. Some few days afterward she went thither herself, and  said to her head cook:--    \"I intend to eat little Dawn for my dinner to-morrow.\"    \"O! madam!\" cried the head cook.    \"I will have it so,\" replied the Queen (and this she spoke in the tone  of an Ogress who had a strong desire to eat fresh meat), \"and will eat  her with a sharp sauce.\"    The poor man, knowing very well that he must not play tricks with  Ogresses, took his great knife and went up into little Dawn's chamber.  She was then nearly four years old, and came up to him, jumping and  laughing, to put her arms round his neck, and ask him for some  sugar-candy. Upon which he began to weep, the great knife fell out of  his hand, and he went into the back yard and killed a little lamb, and  dressed it with such good sauce that his mistress assured him she had  never eaten anything so good in her life. He had at the same time taken  up little Dawn and carried her to his wife, to conceal her in his  lodging at the end of the courtyard.    Eight days afterwards the wicked Queen said to the chief cook, \"I will  sup upon little Day.\"    He answered not a word, being resolved to cheat her again as he had done  before. He went to find little Day, and saw him with a foil in his hand,  with which he was fencing with a great monkey: the child was then only  three years of age. He took him up in his arms and carried him to his  wife, that she might conceal him in her chamber along with his sister,  and instead of little Day he served up a young and very tender kid,  which the Ogress found to be wonderfully good.    All had gone well up to now; but one evening this wicked Queen said to  her chief cook:--    \"I will eat the Queen with the same sauce I had with her children.\"    Now the poor chief cook was in despair and could not imagine how to  deceive her again. The young Queen was over twenty years old, not  reckoning the hundred years she had been asleep: and how to find  something to take her place greatly puzzled him. He then decided, to  save his own life, to cut the Queen's throat; and going up into her  chamber, with intent to do it at once, he put himself into as great fury  as he possibly could, and came into the young Queen's room with his  dagger in his hand. He would not, however, deceive her, but told her,  with a great deal of respect, the orders he had received from the  Queen-mother.    \"Do it; do it,\" she said, stretching out her neck. \"Carry out your  orders, and then I shall go and see my children, my poor children, whom  I loved so much and so tenderly.\"    For she thought them dead, since they had been taken away without her  knowledge.    \"No, no, madam,\" cried the poor chief cook, all in tears; \"you shall not  die, and you shall see your children again at once. But then you must  go home with me to my lodgings, where I have concealed them, and I will  deceive the Queen once more, by giving her a young hind in your stead.\"    Upon this he forthwith conducted her to his room, where, leaving her to  embrace her children, and cry along with them, he went and dressed a  young hind, which the Queen had for her supper, and devoured with as  much appetite as if it had been the young Queen. She was now well  satisfied with her cruel deeds, and she invented a story to tell the  King on his return, of how the Queen his wife and her two children had  been devoured by mad wolves.    One evening, as she was, according to her custom, rambling round about  the courts and yards of the palace to see if she could smell any fresh  meat, she heard, in a room on the ground floor, little Day crying, for  his mamma was going to whip him, because he had been naughty; and she  heard, at the same time, little Dawn begging mercy for her brother.    The Ogress knew the voice of the Queen and her children at once, and  being furious at having been thus deceived, she gave orders (in a most  horrible voice which made everybody tremble) that, next morning by break  of day, they should bring into the middle of the great court a large tub  filled with toads, vipers, snakes, and all sorts of serpents, in order  to have the Queen and her children, the chief cook, his wife and maid,  thrown into it, all of whom were to be brought thither with their hands  tied behind them.    They were brought out accordingly, and the executioners were just going  to throw them into the tub, when the King, who was not so soon expected,  entered the court on horseback and asked, with the utmost astonishment,  what was the meaning of that horrible spectacle.    No one dared to tell him, when the Ogress, all enraged to see what had  happened, threw herself head foremost into the tub, and was instantly  devoured by the ugly creatures she had ordered to be thrown into it to  kill the others. The King was of course very sorry, for she was his  mother; but he soon comforted himself with his beautiful wife and his  pretty children.          LITTLE THUMB.      Once upon a time there was a fagot-maker and his wife, who had seven  children, all boys. The eldest was but ten years old, and the youngest  only seven.    They were very poor, and their seven children were a great source of  trouble to them because not one of them was able to earn his bread. What  gave them yet more uneasiness was that the youngest was very delicate,  and scarce ever spoke a word, which made people take for stupidity that  which was a sign of good sense. He was very little, and when born he was  no bigger than one's thumb; hence he was called Little Thumb.    The poor child was the drudge of the household, and was always in the  wrong. He was, however, the most bright and discreet of all the  brothers; and if he spoke little, he heard and thought the more.    There came a very bad year, and the famine was so great that these poor  people resolved to rid themselves of their children. One evening, when  they were in bed, and the fagot-maker was sitting with his wife at the  fire, he said to her, with his heart ready to burst with grief:--    \"You see plainly that we no longer can give our children food, and I  cannot bear to see them die of hunger before my eyes; I am resolved to  lose them in the wood to-morrow, which may very easily be done, for,  while they amuse themselves in tying up fagots, we have only to run away  and leave them without their seeing us.\"    \"Ah!\" cried out his wife, \"could you really take the children and lose  them?\"    In vain did her husband represent to her their great poverty; she would  not consent to it. She was poor, but she was their mother.    However, having considered what a grief it would be to her to see them  die of hunger, she consented, and went weeping to bed.    Little Thumb heard all they had said; for, hearing that they were  talking business, he got up softly and slipped under his father's seat,  so as to hear without being seen. He went to bed again, but did not  sleep a wink all the rest of the night, thinking of what he had to do.  He got up early in the morning, and went to the brookside, where he  filled his pockets full of small white pebbles, and then returned home.  They all went out, but Little Thumb never told his brothers a word of  what he knew.    [Illustration: \"SLIPPED UNDER HIS FATHER'S SEAT.\" p. 30.]    They went into a very thick forest, where they could not see one  another at ten paces apart. The fagot-maker began to cut wood, and the  children to gather up sticks to make fagots. Their father and mother,  seeing them busy at their work, got away from them unbeknown and then  all at once ran as fast as they could through a winding by-path.    When the children found they were alone, they began to cry with all  their might. Little Thumb let them cry on, knowing very well how to get  home again; for, as he came, he had dropped the little white pebbles he  had in his pockets all along the way. Then he said to them, \"Do not be  afraid, my brothers,--father and mother have left us here, but I will  lead you home again; only follow me.\"    They followed, and he brought them home by the very same way they had  come into the forest. They dared not go in at first, but stood outside  the door to listen to what their father and mother were saying.    The very moment the fagot-maker"]]]
