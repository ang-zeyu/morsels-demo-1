The inundation does not possess the same  importance for the regions covered by it, that the rise of the Nile  does for Egypt. In fact, it does more harm than good, and the river-side  population have always worked hard to protect themselves from it and to  keep it away from their lands rather than facilitate its access to  them; they regard it as a sort of necessary evil to which they resign  themselves, while trying to minimize its effects.***         * This fact has been established by Ross and Lynch in two       articles in the _Journal of the Royal Geographical Society_,       vol. ix. pp. 446, 472. The Chaldaeans and Assyrians called       the gulf into which the two rivers debouched, Nar Marratum,       or \"salt river,\" a name which they extended to the Chaldaean       Sea, i.e. to the whole Persian Gulf.         ** Loftus estimated, about the middle of the last century,       the progress of alluvial deposit at about one English mile       in every seventy years; H. Rawlinson considers that the       progress must have been more considerable in ancient times,       and estimates it at an English mile in thirty years. Kiepert       thinks, taking the above estimate as a basis, that in the       sixth century before our era the fore-shore came from about       ten to twelve German miles (47 to 56 English) higher up than       the present fore-shore. G. Rawlinson estimates on his part       that between the thirtieth and twentieth centuries B.C., a       period in which he places the establishment of the first       Chaldaean Empire, the fore-shore was more than 120 miles       above the mouth of Shatt-el-Arab, to the north of the       present village of Kornah.         *** Fr. Lenormant has energetically defended this hypothesis       in the majority of his works: it is set forth at some length       in his work on _La Langue primitive de la Chaldee_. Hommel,       on the other hand, maintains and strives to demonstrate       scientifically the relationship of the non-Semitic tongue       with Turkish.    The traveller Olivier noticed this, and writes as follows: \"The land  there is rather less fertile [than in Egypt], because it does not  receive the alluvial deposits of the rivers with the same regularity as  that of the Delta. It is necessary to irrigate it in order to render it  productive, and to protect it sedulously from the inundations which are  too destructive in their action and too irregular.\"    The first races to colonize this country of rivers, or at any rate  the first of which we can find traces, seem to have belonged to three  different types. The most important were the Semites, who spoke a  dialect akin to Aramaic, Hebrew, and Phoenician. It was for a long  time supposed that they came down from the north, and traces of their  occupation have been pointed out in Armenia in the vicinity of Ararat,  or halfway down the course of the Tigris, at the foot of the Gordysean  mountains. It has recently been suggested that we ought rather to seek  for their place of origin in Southern Arabia, and this view is gaining  ground among the learned. Side by side with these Semites, the monuments  give evidence of a race of ill-defined character, which some have  sought, without much success, to connect with the tribes of the Urall or  Altai; these people are for the present provisionally called Sumerians.*  They came, it would appear, from some northern country; they brought  with them from their original home a curious system of writing, which,  modified, transformed, and adopted by ten different nations, has  preserved for us all that we know in regard to the majority of the  empires which rose and fell in Western Asia before the Persian conquest.  Semite or Sumerian, it is still doubtful which preceded the other at the  mouths of the Euphrates. The Sumerians, who were for a time all-powerful  in the centuries before the dawn of history, had already mingled closely  with the Semites when we first hear of them. Their language gave way to  the Semitic, and tended gradually to become a language of ceremony and  ritual, which was at last learnt less for everyday use, than for the  drawing up of certain royal inscriptions, or for the interpretation of  very ancient texts of a legal or sacred character. Their religion became  assimilated to the religion, and their gods identified with the gods, of  the Semites. The process of fusion commenced at such an early date, that  nothing has really come down to us from the time when the two races were  strangers to each other. We are, therefore, unable to say with certainty  how much each borrowed from the other, what each gave, or relinquished  of its individual instincts and customs. We must take and judge them as  they come before us, as forming one single nation, imbued with the  same ideas, influenced in all their acts by the same civilization, and  possessed of such strongly marked characteristics that only in the last  days of their existence do we find any appreciable change. In the course  of the ages they had to submit to the invasions and domination of some  dozen different races, of whom some--Assyrians and Chaldaeans--were  descended from a Semitic stock, while the others--Elamites, Cossaaans,  Persians, Macedonians, and Parthians--either were not connected with  them by any tie of blood, or traced their origin in some distant manner  to the Sumerian branch. They got quickly rid of a portion of these  superfluous elements, and absorbed or assimilated the rest; like  the Egyptians, they seem to have been one of those races which, once  established, were incapable of ever undergoing modification, and  remained unchanged from one end of their existence to the other.    * The name _Accadian_ proposed by H. Rawlinson and by Hincks, and  adopted by Sayce, seems to have given way to _Sumerian_, the title put  forward by Oppert. The existence of the Sumerian or Sumero-Accadian  has been contested by Halevy in a number of noteworthy works. M. Halevy  wishes to recognize in the so-called Sumerian documents the Semitic  tongue of the ordinary inscriptions, but written in a priestly syllabic  character subject to certain rules; this would be practically a  _cryptogram_, or rather an _allogram_. M. Halevy won over Messrs. Guyard  and Pognon in France, Delitzsch and a part of the Delitzsch school  in Germany, to his view of the facts. The controversy, which has been  carried on on both sides with a somewhat unnecessary vehemence, still  rages; it has been simplified quite recently by Delitzcsh's return to  the Sumerian theory. Without reviewing the arguments in detail, and  while doing full justice to the profound learning displayed by M.  Halevy, I feel forced to declare with Tiele that his criticisms \"oblige  scholars to carefully reconsider all that has been taken as proved in  these matters, but that they do not warrant us in rejecting as untenable  the hypothesis, still a very probable one, according to which the  difference in the graphic systems corresponds to a real difference in.  idiom.\"    Their country must have presented at the beginning very much the same  aspect of disorder and neglect which it offers to modern eyes. It was  a flat interminable moorland stretching away to the horizon, there to  begin again seemingly more limitless than ever, with, no rise or fall in  the ground to break the dull monotony; clumps of palm trees and slender  mimosas, intersected by lines of water gleaming in the distance, then  long patches of wormwood and mallow, endless vistas of burnt-up plain,  more palms and more mimosas, make up the picture of the land, whose  uniform soil consists of rich, stiff, heavy clay, split up by the heat  of the sun into a network of deep narrow fissures, from which the  shrubs and wild herbs shoot forth each year in spring-time. By an almost  imperceptible slope it falls gently away from north to south towards  the Persian Gulf, from east to west towards the Arabian plateau. The  Euphrates flows through it with unstable and changing course, between  shifting banks which it shapes and re-shapes from season to season.

The slightest impulse of its current encroaches on them, breaks through  them, and makes openings for streamlets, the majority of which are  clogged up and obliterated by the washing away of their margins, almost  as rapidly as they are formed. Others grow wider and longer, and,  sending out branches, are transformed into permanent canals or regular  rivers, navigable at certain seasons. They meet on the left bank  detached offshoots of the Tigris, and after wandering capriciously in  the space between the two rivers, at last rejoin their parent stream:  such are the Shatt-el-Hai and the Shatt-en-Nil. The overflowing waters  on the right bank, owing to the fall of the land, run towards the  low limestone hills which shut in the basin of the Euphrates in the  direction of the desert; they are arrested at the foot of these hills,  and are diverted on to the low-lying ground, where they lose themselves  in the morasses, or hollow out a series of lakes along its borders,  the largest of which, Bahr-i-Nedjif, is shut in on three sides by steep  cliffs, and rises or falls periodically with the floods. A broad canal,  which takes its origin in the direction of Hit at the beginning of the  alluvial plain, bears with it the overflow, and, skirting the lowest  terraces of the Arabian chain, runs almost parallel to the Euphrates. In  proportion as the canal proceeds southward the ground sinks still lower,  and becomes saturated with the overflowing waters, until, the banks  gradually disappearing, the whole neighbourhood is converted into a  morass. The Euphrates and its branches do not at all times succeed in  reaching the sea: they are lost for the most part in vast lagoons to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17324"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chald√¶a, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 4 (of 12) (#4)"],[1,"inhabited it.    [Illustration: 024.jpg TWO ASIATICS FKOM THE TOMB OF KHNUMHOPTU.]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Insinger    Should he escape these initial perils, the Amu--an agricultural and  settled people inhabiting the fertile region--would give the stranger  but a sorry reception: he would have to submit to their demands, and  the most exorbitant levies of toll did not always preserve caravans from  their attacks.* The country seems to have been but thinly populated;  tracts now denuded were then covered by large forests in which herds of  elephants still roamed,** and wild beasts, including lions and leopards,  rendered the route through them dangerous.         * The merchant who sets out for foreign lands \"leaves his       possessions to his children--for fear of lions and       Asiatics.\"         ** Thutmosis III. went elephant-hunting near the Syrian town       of Nii.    The notion that Syria was a sort of preserve for both big and small  game was so strongly implanted in the minds of the Egyptians, that their  popular literature was full of it: the hero of their romances betook  himself there for the chase, as a prelude to meeting with the princess  whom he was destined to marry,* or, as in the case of Kazarati, chief  of Assur, that he might encounter there a monstrous hyena with which to  engage in combat.         * As, for instance, the hero in the _Story of the       Predestined Prince_, exiled from Egypt with his dog, pursues       his way hunting till he reaches the confines of Naharaim,       where he is to marry the prince's daughter.    These merchants' adventures and explorations, as they were not followed  by any military expedition, left absolutely no mark on the industries or  manners of the primitive natives: those of them only who were close to  the frontiers of Egypt came under her subtle charm and felt the power  of her attraction, but this slight influence never penetrated beyond  the provinces lying nearest to the Dead Sea. The remaining populations  looked rather to Chaldaea, and received, though at a distance, the  continuous impress of the kingdoms of the Euphrates. The tradition which  attributes to Sargon of Agade, and to his son Istaramsin, the subjection  of the people of the Amanos and the Orontes, probably contains but a  slight element of truth; but if, while awaiting further information, we  hesitate to believe that the armies of these princes ever crossed the  Lebanon or landed in Cyprus, we must yet admit the very early advent  of their civilization in those western countries which are regarded as  having been under their rule. More than three thousand years before  our era, the Asiatics who figure on the tomb of Khnumhotpu clothed  themselves according to the fashions of Uru and Lagash, and affected  long robes of striped and spotted stuffs. We may well ask if they had  also borrowed the cuneiform syllabary for the purposes of their official  correspondence,* and if the professional scribe with his stylus and clay  tablet was to be found in their cities. The Babylonian courtiers were,  no doubt, more familiar visitors among them than the Memphite nobles,  while the Babylonian kings sent regularly to Syria for statuary stone,  precious metals, and the timber required in the building of  their monuments: Urbau and Gudea, as well as their successors and  contemporaries, received large convoys of materials from the Amanos, and  if the forests of Lebanon were more rarely utilised, it was not because  their existence was unknown, but because distance rendered their  approach more difficult and transport more costly. The Mediterranean  marches were, in their language, classed as a whole under one  denomination--Martu, Amurru,** the West--but there were distinctive  names for each of the provinces into which they were divided.         * The most ancient cuneiform tablets of Syrian origin are       not older than the XVIth century before our era; they       contain the official, correspondence of the native princes       with the Pharaohs Amenothes III. and IV. of the XVIIIth       dynasty, as will be seen later on in this volume; they were       discovered in the ruins of one of the palaces at Tel el-       Amarna in Egypt.         ** Formerly read Akharru. Martu would be the Sumerian and       Akharru the Semitic form, Akharru meaning _that which is       behind_. The discovery of the Tel el-Amarna tablets threw       doubt on the reading of the name Akharru: some thought that       it ought to be kept in any case; others, with more or less       certainty, think that it should be replaced by Amuru,       Amurru, the country of the Amorites. But the question has       now been settled by Babylonian contract and law tablets of       the period of Khaminurabi, in which the name is written _A-       mu-ur-ri (ki)_. Hommel originated the idea that Martu might       be an abbreviation of Amartu, that is, Amar with the       feminine termination of nouns in the Canaanitish dialect:       Martu would thus actually signify _the country of the       Amorites_.    Probably even at that date they called the north Khati,* and Cole-Syria,  Amurru, the land of the Amorites. The scattered references in their  writings seem to indicate frequent intercourse with these countries, and  that, too, as a matter of course which excited no surprise among their  contemporaries: a journey from Lagash to the mountains of Tidanum and  to Gubin, or to the Lebanon and beyond it to Byblos,** meant to them  no voyage of discovery. Armies undoubtedly followed the routes already  frequented by caravans and flotillas of trading boats, and the time came  when kings desired to rule as sovereigns over nations with whom their  subjects had peaceably traded.         * The name of the Khati, Khatti, is found in the _Book of       Omens_, which is supposed to contain an extract from the       annals of Sargon and Naramsin; as, however, the text which       we possess of it is merely a copy of the time of       Assurbanipal, it is possible that the word Khati is merely       the translation of a more ancient term, perhaps Martu.       Winckler thinks it to be included in Lesser Armenia and the       Melitone of classical authors.         ** Gubin is probably the Kupuna, Kupnu, of the Egyptians,       the Byblos of Phoenicia. Amiaud had proposed a most unlikely       identification with Koptos in Egypt. In the time of Ine-Sin,       King of Ur, mention is found of Simurru, Zimyra.    It does not appear, however, that the ancient rulers of Lagash ever  extended their dominion so far. The governors of the northern cities, on  the other hand, showed themselves more energetic, and inaugurated  that march westwards which sooner or later brought the peoples of the  Euphrates into collision with the dwellers on the Nile: for the first  Babylonian empire without doubt comprised part if not the whole of  Syria.*         * It is only since the discovery of the Tel el-Amarna       tablets that the fact of the dominant influence of Chaldaea       over Syria and of its conquest has been definitely realized.       It is now clear that the state of things of which the       tablets discovered in Egypt give us a picture, could only be       explained by the hypothesis of a Babylonish supremacy of       long duration over the peoples situated between the       Euphrates and the Mediterranean.    Among the most celebrated names in ancient history, that of Babylon is  perhaps the only one which still suggests to our minds a sense of vague  magnificence and undefined dominion. Cities in other parts of the world,  it is true, have rivalled Babylon in magnificence and power: Egypt could  boast of more than one such city, and their ruins to this day present to  our gaze more monuments worthy of admiration than Babylon ever contained  in the days of her greatest prosperity. The pyramids of Memphis and the  colossal statues of Thebes still stand erect, while the ziggurats and  the palaces of Chaldaea are but mounds of clay crumbling into the plain;  but the Egyptian monuments are visible and tangible objects; we can  calculate to within a few inches the area they cover and the elevation  of their summits, and the very precision with which we can gauge their  enormous size tends to limit and lessen their effect upon us. How is it  possible to give free rein to the imagination when the subject of it is  strictly limited by exact and determined measurements? At Babylon, on  the contrary, there is nothing remaining to check the flight of fancy: a  single hillock, scoured by the rains of centuries, marks the spot where  the temple of Bel stood erect in its splendour; another represents the  hanging gardens, while the ridges running to the right and left were  once the ramparts.

It       shows the state of the ruins in the first half of our       century, before the excavations carried out at European       instigation.    The vestiges of a few buildings remain above the mounds of rubble,  and as soon as the pickaxe is applied to any spot, irregular layers of  bricks, enamelled tiles, and inscribed tablets are brought to light--in  fine, all those numberless objects which bear witness to the presence  of man and to his long sojourn on the spot. But these vestiges are so  mutilated and disfigured that the principal outlines of the buildings  cannot be determined with any certainty, and afford us no data for  guessing their dimensions. He who would attempt to restore the ancient  appearance of the place would find at his disposal nothing but vague  indications, from which he might draw almost any conclusion he pleased.
