Exercise.--In considering the question of the exercise of  adolescents, one's thoughts immediately turn to athletics, games, and  dancing. As a nation the English have always been fond of athletics,  and have attributed to the influence of such team games as cricket and  football not only their success in various competitions but also their  success in the sterner warfare of life. This success has been obtained  on the tented field and in the work of exploring, mountaineering, and  other pursuits that make great demand not only on nerve and muscle but  also on strength of character and powers of endurance.    Team games appear to be the especial property of adolescents, for  young children are more or less individualistic and solitary in many  of their games, but boys and girls alike prefer team games from the  pre-adolescent age up to adult life. It is certain that no form of  exercise is superior to these games: they call into play every muscle  of the body, they make great demands on accuracy of eye and  coordination, they also stimulate and develop habits of command,  obedience, loyalty, and _esprit de corps_. In the great public schools  of England, and in the private schools which look up to them as their  models, team games are played, as one might say, in a religious  spirit. The boy or girl who attempts to take an unfair advantage, or  who habitually plays for his or her own hand, is quickly made to feel  a pariah and an outcast. Among the greatest blessings that are  conveyed to the children of the poorer classes is the instruction not  only in the technique of team games but also in the inoculation of the  spirit in which they ought to be played. It is absolutely necessary  that the highest ideals connected with games should be handed down,  for thus the children who perhaps do not always have the highest  ideals before them in real life may learn through this mimic warfare  how the battle of life must be fought and what are the characters of  mind and body that deserve and ensure success. It has been well said  that those who make the songs of a nation help largely to make its  character, and equally surely those who teach and control the games of  the adolescents are making or marring a national destiny.    Among the means of physical and moral advancement may be claimed  gymnastics. And here, alas, this nation can by no means claim to be  _facile princeps_. Not only have we been relatively slow in adopting  properly systematised exercises, but even to the present day the  majority of elementary schools are without properly fitted gymnasia  and duly qualified teachers. The small and relatively poor  Scandinavian nations have admirably fitted gymnasia in connection with  their _Folkschule_, which correspond to our elementary schools. The  exercises are based on those systematised by Ling; each series is  varied, and is therefore the more interesting, and each lesson  commences with simple, easily performed movements, leading on to those  that are more elaborate and fatiguing, and finally passing through a  descending series to the condition of repose.    The gymnasia where such exercises are taught in England are relatively  few and far between, and it is lamentable to find that many excellent  and well-appointed schools for children, whose parents pay large sums  of money for their education, have no properly equipped gymnasia nor  adequately trained teachers. When the question is put, \"How often do  you have gymnastics at your school?\" the answer is frequently, \"We  have none,\" or, \"Half an hour once a week.\" Exercises such as Ling's  not only exercise every muscle in the body in a scientific and  well-regulated fashion, but being performed by a number of pupils at  once in obedience to words of command, discipline, co-operation,  obedience to teachers, and loyalty to comrades, are taught at the same  time. The deepest interest attaches to many of the more complex  exercises, while some of them make large demands on the courage and  endurance of the young people.    In Scandinavia the State provides knickerbockers, tunics, and  gymnasium shoes for those children whose parents are too poor to  provide them; and again, in Scandinavia there is very frequently the  provision of bathrooms in which the pupils can have a shower bath and  rub-down after the exercises. These bathrooms in connection with the  gymnasia need not necessarily be costly; indeed many of them in  Stockholm and Denmark merely consist of troughs in the cement floor,  on the edge of which the children sit in a row while they receive a  shower bath over their heads and bodies. The feet get well washed in  the trough, and the smart douche of water on head and shoulders acts  as an admirable tonic.    Another exercise which ought to be specially dear to a nation of  islanders is swimming, and this, again, is a relatively cheap luxury  too much neglected amongst us. Certainly there are public baths, but  there are not enough to permit of all the elementary school children  bathing even once a week, and still less have they the opportunity of  learning to swim. There is much to be done yet before we can be justly  proud of our national system of education. We must not lose sight of  the ideal with which we started--viz. that we should endeavour to do  the best that is possible for our young people in body, soul, and  spirit. The three parts of our nature are intertwined, and a duty  performed to one part has an effect on the whole.          CHAPTER III.    CARE OF THE ADOLESCENT GIRL IN SICKNESS.      If measured by the death-rate the period of adolescence should cause  us little anxiety, but a careful examination into the state of health  of children of school age shows us that it is a time in which  disorders of health abound, and that although these disorders are not  necessarily, nor even generally, fatal, they are frequent, they spoil  the child's health, and inevitably bear fruit in the shape of an  injurious effect on health in after life.    That the health of adolescents should be unstable is what we ought to  expect from the general instability of the organism due to the  rapidity of growth and the remarkable developmental changes that are  crowded into these few years. Rapidity of growth and increase of  weight are very generally recognised, although their effects upon  health are apt to be overlooked. On the other hand, the still more  remarkable development that occurs in adolescence is very generally  ignored.    As a general rule the infectious fevers, the so-called childish  diseases--such as measles, chicken-pox, and whooping-cough--are less  common in adolescence than they are in childhood, while the special  diseases of internal organs due to their overwork, or to their natural  tendency to degeneration, is yet far in the future. The chief troubles  of adolescents appear to be due to overstress which accompanies rapid  development, to the difficulty of the whole organism in adapting  itself to new functions and altered conditions, and no doubt in some  measure to the unwisdom both of the young people and of their  advisers.    This is not the place for a general treatise on the diseases of  adolescents, but a few of the commonest and most obvious troubles  should be noted.    The Teeth.--It is quite surprising to learn what a very large  percentage of young soldiers are refused enlistment in the army on  account of decayed or defective teeth, and anyone who has examined the  young women candidates for the Civil Service and for Missionary  Societies must have recognised that their teeth are in no way better  than those of the young men. In addition to several vacancies in the  dental series, it is by no means unusual to find that a candidate has  three or even five teeth severely decayed. The extraordinary thing is  that not only the young people and their parents very generally fail  to recognise the gravity of this condition, but that even their  medical advisers have frequently acquiesced in a state of things that  is not only disagreeable but dangerous. A considerable proportion of  people with decayed teeth have also suppuration about the margins of  the gums and around the roots of the teeth. This pyorrhoea  alveolaris, as it is called, constitutes a very great danger to the  patient's health, the purulent discharge teems with poisonous  micro-organisms, which being constantly swallowed are apt to give rise  to septic disease in various organs. It is quite probable that some  cases of gastric ulcer are due to this condition, so too are some  cases of appendicitis, it has been known to cause a peculiarly fatal  form of heart disease, and it is also responsible for the painful  swelling of the joints of the fingers, with wasting of the muscles and  general weakness which goes by the name of rheumatoid arthritis. In  addition to this there are many local affections, such as swollen  glands in the neck, that may be due to this poisonous discharge. One  would think that the mere knowledge that decayed teeth can cause all  this havoc would lead to a grand rush to the dentist, but so far from  being the case, doctors find it extremely difficult to induce their  patients to part with this unsightly, evil-smelling, and dangerous  decayed tooth.    The Throat.--Some throat affections, such as diphtheria and quinsy,  are well known and justly dreaded; and although many a child's life  has been sacrificed to the slowness of its guardians to procure  medical advice and the health-restoring antitoxin, yet on the whole  the public conscience is awake to this duty. Far otherwise is it with  chronic diseases of the tonsils: they may be riddled with small cysts,  they may be constantly in a condition of subacute inflammation  dependent on a septic condition, but no notice is taken"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1377"],[0,"The Talisman (#4)"],[1,"as his  limbs, and which bade defiance to almost all changes of climate, as well  as to fatigue and privations of every kind. His disposition seemed, in  some degree, to partake of the qualities of his bodily frame; and as  the one possessed great strength and endurance, united with the power of  violent exertion, the other, under a calm and undisturbed semblance, had  much of the fiery and enthusiastic love of glory which constituted the  principal attribute of the renowned Norman line, and had rendered  them sovereigns in every corner of Europe where they had drawn their  adventurous swords.    It was not, however, to all the race that fortune proposed such tempting  rewards; and those obtained by the solitary knight during two years'  campaign in Palestine had been only temporal fame, and, as he was taught  to believe, spiritual privileges. Meantime, his slender stock of money  had melted away, the rather that he did not pursue any of the ordinary  modes by which the followers of the Crusade condescended to recruit  their diminished resources at the expense of the people of Palestine--he  exacted no gifts from the wretched natives for sparing their possessions  when engaged in warfare with the Saracens, and he had not availed  himself of any opportunity of enriching himself by the ransom of  prisoners of consequence. The small train which had followed him from  his native country had been gradually diminished, as the means of  maintaining them disappeared, and his only remaining squire was at  present on a sick-bed, and unable to attend his master, who travelled,  as we have seen, singly and alone. This was of little consequence to the  Crusader, who was accustomed to consider his good sword as his safest  escort, and devout thoughts as his best companion.    Nature had, however, her demands for refreshment and repose even on  the iron frame and patient disposition of the Knight of the Sleeping  Leopard; and at noon, when the Dead Sea lay at some distance on his  right, he joyfully hailed the sight of two or three palm-trees, which  arose beside the well which was assigned for his mid-day station. His  good horse, too, which had plodded forward with the steady endurance of  his master, now lifted his head, expanded his nostrils, and quickened  his pace, as if he snuffed afar off the living waters which marked the  place of repose and refreshment. But labour and danger were doomed to  intervene ere the horse or horseman reached the desired spot.    As the Knight of the Couchant Leopard continued to fix his eyes  attentively on the yet distant cluster of palm-trees, it seemed to him  as if some object was moving among them. The distant form separated  itself from the trees, which partly hid its motions, and advanced  towards the knight with a speed which soon showed a mounted horseman,  whom his turban, long spear, and green caftan floating in the wind, on  his nearer approach showed to be a Saracen cavalier. \"In the desert,\"  saith an Eastern proverb, \"no man meets a friend.\" The Crusader was  totally indifferent whether the infidel, who now approached on his  gallant barb as if borne on the wings of an eagle, came as friend or  foe--perhaps, as a vowed champion of the Cross, he might rather have  preferred the latter. He disengaged his lance from his saddle, seized  it with the right hand, placed it in rest with its point half elevated,  gathered up the reins in the left, waked his horse's mettle with  the spur, and prepared to encounter the stranger with the calm  self-confidence belonging to the victor in many contests.    The Saracen came on at the speedy gallop of an Arab horseman, managing  his steed more by his limbs and the inflection of his body than by any  use of the reins, which hung loose in his left hand; so that he was  enabled to wield the light, round buckler of the skin of the rhinoceros,  ornamented with silver loops, which he wore on his arm, swinging it as  if he meant to oppose its slender circle to the formidable thrust of the  Western lance. His own long spear was not couched or levelled like that  of his antagonist, but grasped by the middle with his right hand, and  brandished at arm's-length above his head. As the cavalier approached  his enemy at full career, he seemed to expect that the Knight of the  Leopard should put his horse to the gallop to encounter him. But the  Christian knight, well acquainted with the customs of Eastern warriors,  did not mean to exhaust his good horse by any unnecessary exertion; and,  on the contrary, made a dead halt, confident that if the enemy advanced  to the actual shock, his own weight, and that of his powerful charger,  would give him sufficient advantage, without the additional momentum  of rapid motion. Equally sensible and apprehensive of such a probable  result, the Saracen cavalier, when he had approached towards the  Christian within twice the length of his lance, wheeled his steed to the  left with inimitable dexterity, and rode twice around his antagonist,  who, turning without quitting his ground, and presenting his front  constantly to his enemy, frustrated his attempts to attack him on an  unguarded point; so that the Saracen, wheeling his horse, was fain to  retreat to the distance of a hundred yards. A second time, like a hawk  attacking a heron, the heathen renewed the charge, and a second time  was fain to retreat without coming to a close struggle. A third time he  approached in the same manner, when the Christian knight, desirous to  terminate this illusory warfare, in which he might at length have been  worn out by the activity of his foeman, suddenly seized the mace which  hung at his saddle-bow, and, with a strong hand and unerring aim,  hurled it against the head of the Emir, for such and not less his enemy  appeared. The Saracen was just aware of the formidable missile in time  to interpose his light buckler betwixt the mace and his head; but the  violence of the blow forced the buckler down on his turban, and though  that defence also contributed to deaden its violence, the Saracen was  beaten from his horse. Ere the Christian could avail himself of this  mishap, his nimble foeman sprung from the ground, and, calling on his  steed, which instantly returned to his side, he leaped into his seat  without touching the stirrup, and regained all the advantage of which  the Knight of the Leopard hoped to deprive him. But the latter had  in the meanwhile recovered his mace, and the Eastern cavalier, who  remembered the strength and dexterity with which his antagonist had  aimed it, seemed to keep cautiously out of reach of that weapon of which  he had so lately felt the force, while he showed his purpose of waging a  distant warfare with missile weapons of his own. Planting his long spear  in the sand at a distance from the scene of combat, he strung, with  great address, a short bow, which he carried at his back; and putting  his horse to the gallop, once more described two or three circles of  a wider extent than formerly, in the course of which he discharged six  arrows at the Christian with such unerring skill that the goodness of  his harness alone saved him from being wounded in as many places. The  seventh shaft apparently found a less perfect part of the armour, and  the Christian dropped heavily from his horse. But what was the surprise  of the Saracen, when, dismounting to examine the condition of his  prostrate enemy, he found himself suddenly within the grasp of the  European, who had had recourse to this artifice to bring his enemy  within his reach! Even in this deadly grapple the Saracen was saved by  his agility and presence of mind. He unloosed the sword-belt, in which  the Knight of the Leopard had fixed his hold, and, thus eluding his  fatal grasp, mounted his horse, which seemed to watch his motions with  the intelligence of a human being, and again rode off. But in the last  encounter the Saracen had lost his sword and his quiver of arrows, both  of which were attached to the girdle which he was obliged to abandon. He  had also lost his turban in the struggle.    These disadvantages seemed to incline the Moslem to a truce. He  approached the Christian with his right hand extended, but no longer in  a menacing attitude.    \"There is truce betwixt our nations,\" he said, in the lingua franca  commonly used for the purpose of communication with the Crusaders;  \"wherefore should there be war betwixt thee and me? Let there be peace  betwixt us.\"    \"I am well contented,\" answered he of the Couchant Leopard; \"but what  security dost thou offer that thou wilt observe the truce?\"    \"The word of a follower of the Prophet was never broken,\" answered the  Emir. \"It is thou, brave Nazarene, from whom I should demand security,  did I not know that treason seldom dwells with courage.\"    The Crusader felt that the confidence of the Moslem made him ashamed of  his own doubts.    \"By the cross of my sword,\" he said, laying his hand on the weapon as  he spoke, \"I will be true companion to thee, Saracen, while our fortune  wills that we remain in company together.\"    \"By Mohammed, Prophet of God, and by Allah, God of the Prophet,\" replied  his late foeman, \"there is not treachery in my heart towards thee. And  now wend we to yonder fountain, for the hour of rest is at hand, and  the stream had hardly touched my lip when I was called to battle by thy  approach.\"    The Knight of the Couchant Leopard yielded a ready and courteous assent;  and the late foes, without an angry look or gesture of doubt, rode side  by side to the little cluster of palm-trees.        CHAPTER II.    Times of danger have always, and in a peculiar degree, their seasons  of good-will and security; and this was particularly so in the ancient  feudal ages, in which, as the manners of the period had assigned war  to be the chief and most worthy occupation of mankind, the intervals  of peace, or rather of truce, were highly relished by those warriors to "]]]
