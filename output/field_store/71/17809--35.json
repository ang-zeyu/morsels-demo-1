Indeed, in  petticoats or in pantaloons, making a show of her \"heart\" in the  publication of these letters to a gentleman whom she had treated with  every species of contempt, obloquy, and insult, until she had made his  home insupportable, or courting the wondering admiration of country  bumpkins by unsexing herself for feats of horsemanship, or for other  athletic diversions, she is always anxious to produce a sensation,  anxious to stir up the gentle public to a roar.    Still, with all her infirmities of taste and temper, Mrs. Kemble is a  woman of unquestionable and very decided genius; a genius frequently  displayed in literature, where its growth may be traced, in prose, from  her foolish \"Journal in America\" to her more artistic \"Year of  Consolation;\" and in poetry, where its development is seen from its  budding in \"Frances the First\" to its most perfect blossoming in the  recent collection of her \"Poems.\" As an actress, her powers and  qualifications are probably greater than those of any other _tragedienne_  now on the English stage; and her characteristics and supremacy are  likely to be far more profitably as well as distinctly evinced in her  \"Shakspeare Readings\" than in any appearance before the footlights.             *       *       *       *       *      LITERATURE IN AFRICA.    The Bible has been translated into the principal language of eastern  Africa, and the American Bible Society has lately received a copy of  \"EVANGELIO za avioondika LUCAS. The Gospel according to St. Luke,  translated into Kinika, by the Rev. JOHN LEWIS KRAPF, Phil. Dr.; Bombay  American Mission Press: T.

He is now in Germany for the recovery of his health. The  language resembles in some particulars the dialects used in Western  Africa.

The British Association for the Advancement of Science assembled this  year at Edinburgh, and its first general meeting was held on Wednesday,  the 31st of July, when Sir DAVID BREWSTER, upon taking the chair,  delivered a very interesting address upon the history of the Association,  and the progress of the Sciences. On Thursday, business began in all the  sections, and in the evening Prof. Bennett delivered a lecture on the  passage of the blood through the minute vesicles of animals, in  connection with nutrition. On Friday, a party of about seventy started  under the direction of Mr. R. Chambers, to examine into the groovings on  the western face of Corstophine Hill, and the striae on the sandstone  near Ravelstone. They afterward visited Arthur's Seat and St. Margaret's,  where they examined the striated rocks and stones. In the evening there  was a conversazione and promenade. Saturday was devoted to excursions. On  Monday afternoon upward of two hundred members dined together, Sir David  Brewster presiding. In the evening, Dr. Mantell delivered a lecture on  the extinct birds of New Zealand. On Tuesday evening there was a  full-dress promenade and _soiree_. On Wednesday, the general committee  assembled to sanction the grants that had passed the Committee of  Recommendations: and in the afternoon of the same day the concluding  general meeting of the Association, for the accustomed ceremonial  proceedings, was held. The next annual meeting is to take place at  Ipswich, and Mr. Airy, the Astronomer Royal, will preside. The meeting,  altogether, was one of unusual interest; among the persons present were  the chief lights of science, in the empire and from the continent, and  our own country was represented by Prof. Hitchcock and several other  scholars. The papers read in the various sections were numerous, and some  of them are described as of very remarkable freshness and value. They  will soon be accessible in the published Transactions, which will this  year be more voluminous than ever.    The retiring President, Dr. Robinson, at the opening meeting,  congratulated himself on being able to surrender his dominion to his  successor in a more prosperous condition than he had received it, and  spoke in glowing terms of the character and scientific achievements of  that successor, of whose labors he gave a brief but glowing history. Sir  David Brewster, who was one of the founders of the Association, is a  native of Jedburgh, in Roxburgshire; where he was born December 11, 1781.  He was educated for the Church of Scotland, of which he became a  licentiate; and in 1800 he received the honorary degree of M. A. from the  University of Edinburgh. While studying here he enjoyed the friendship  of Robison, who then filled the Chair of Natural Philosophy; Playfair, of  Mathematics; and Dugald Stewart that of Moral Philosophy. In 1808, he  undertook the editorship of the \"Edinburgh Encyclopaedia,\" which was only  finished in 1830. In 1807 he received the honorary degree of LL. D. from  the University of Aberdeen; and in 1808 was elected a Fellow of the Royal  Society of Edinburgh. Between 1801 and 1812 he devoted his attention  greatly to the study of Optics; and the results were published in a  \"Treatise on New Philosophical Instruments,\" in 1813. In 1815 he received  the Copley Medal of the Royal Society for one of his discoveries in  optical science; and soon after was admitted a Fellow of that body. In  1816, the Institute of France adjudged to him half of the physical prize  of 3000 francs, awarded for two of the most important discoveries made in  Europe, in any branch of science, during the two preceding years; and in  1819, Dr. Brewster received from the Royal Society the Rumford gold and  silver medals, for his discoveries on the Polarization of Light. In 1816  he invented the Kaleidoscope, the patent-right of which was evaded, so  that the inventor gained little beyond fame, though the large sale of the  instrument must have produced considerable profit. In 1819, in  conjunction with Dr. Jameson, he established the \"_Edinburgh  Philosophical Journal_\"; and subsequently he commenced the \"_Edinburgh  Journal of Science_,\" of which sixteen volumes appeared. In 1825, the  Institute of France elected him a Corresponding Member; and he has  received the same honor from the Royal Academies of Russia, Prussia,  Sweden, and Denmark. In 1831, he received the Decoration of the  Hanoverian Guelphic Order; and in the following year, the honor of  Knighthood from William the Fourth.    Sir David Brewster has edited and written various works, besides  contributing largely to the _Edinburgh Review_, the _Transactions of the  British Association_, and other scientific societies, and the _North  British Review_. Among his more popular works are \"A Treatise on the  Kaleidoscope;\" an original Treatise on Optics for the _Cabinet  Cyclopaedia;_ and Letters on Natural Magic and a Life of Sir Isaac Newton  for the \"Family Library.\" The latter work has been translated into  German.    Sir David Brewster is likewise one of the editors of the _London and  Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine_.    The discoveries of Sir David Brewster range from the kaleidoscope to the  law of the angle of polarization, the physical laws of metallic  reflection, and the optical properties of crystals; and the venerable  philosopher is the author of an immense number of facts and practical  applications in every branch of optics.          *       *       *       *       *    The AMERICAN SCIENTIFIC ASSOCIATION assembled this year at New Haven, and  Was presided over by Alex. D. Bache, LL. D. of the Coast Survey. It was  attended by many of the most eminent men of science in this country,  among whom were President Woolsey, Professor Denison Olmsted, the elder  and the younger Silliman, E. C. Herrick, and E. Loomis, of Yale College;  Professors Louis Agassiz, E. N. Hosford and Benjamin Pierce of Harvard  University; Lieutenant Charles H. Davis, U. S. N.; Professor O. M.  Mitchell, Superintendent of the Cincinnati Observatory; Dr. A. L. Elwyn  of Philadelphia; Professor Walter R. Johnson of Washington; Professor  Joseph Henry, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution; William C.  Redfield of New York; and an unusual number of amateur scholars from  various parts of the Union. There were several papers of remarkable  value, among which that of Mr. Squier, our Charge d'Affaires for Central  America, was perhaps at this period of the most general interest. Others  were puerile, and as unfit in subject as in ability for presentation in  such an assembly. It is to be regretted that the Association does not  adopt the only protection against such discreditable annoyances, by  insisting upon the submission of everything offered for its consideration  to a competent private committee.           *       *       *       *       *    A GREAT NATIONAL SOCIETY FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING, is said to have  been discussed recently at the meetings of inferior"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14445"],[0,"Confidences: Talks With a Young Girl Concerning Herself (#4)"],[1,"in the blood. If you want to have nice red cheeks, you must breathe in  plenty of fresh air. Also you must have plenty of exercise, so as to  help send the blood all over the body. You know when you run, the blood  flows much faster than when you are quiet. It is a good plan to stand by  an open window every morning and every evening and fill your lungs with  good, pure air, taking about twenty-five deep breaths.                 *       *       *       *       *      I want to help you to grow as beautiful as God meant you to be when    He thought of you first.      George MacDonald.           *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER VII    THE SIGN LANGUAGE      Do you know one way we can tell if all the organs are doing their work  well? By watching for the sign language. If the blood is not carrying  the skin sufficient nourishment, it will be very pale and dull looking.  If the waste materials are not being carried off, they may accumulate in  the skin and clog the pores. Then we will have pimples or blackheads.  Each person's skin is a law unto itself, and what is beneficial to one  may not be to another. Generally, though, it will be found helpful to  bathe the face at night with hot water, to remove all dirt; then, if the  skin is rough, massage with good cold cream. In the morning a quick rub  with cold water should be taken (and do not be afraid to rub the face a  little). If you are going out in the sun or wind, follow with a little  good talcum or rice powder, to protect the face from the raw winds,  or, if the skin is inclined to be dry, apply a little cold cream before  using the powder. Any eruptions on the face show a defect in the  circulation. The blood is not disposing of the waste material properly,  and it is being left to clog the pores of the skin. These eruptions  should not be neglected, as they sometimes indicate a serious condition  of the blood or circulation.    The eyes tell if we are tired or unwell, for then they will be dull,  while, if we abuse or strain them, they often are red. This not only  makes them less attractive, but it shows we must attend to them. Would  it not be dreadful if they became so tired or worn out that we could  not see with them? The care of the eyes is very important. When you are  reading or writing, the light should come over your left shoulder, and  you should never try to read in a poor light. Sometimes, if the eyes are  tired, it will rest them to bathe them in warm, boiled water in which  some boracic acid crystals have been dissolved. You may even put a few  drops of this solution right in the eye, but never put anything else in  it except by the directions of a physician, as the eyes are too precious  to take any risks, and sometimes they are injured by various eye waters.    The hair also shows the state of the health, and it shows if we are  careless. Nothing so detracts from a girl's appearance as soiled or  untidy hair. One of the most potent charms a woman can have is a  well-kept, luxuriant, glossy head of hair. Just think how quickly one  notices thin, dry, stiff hair on a woman's head. And as for those that  carry around diseased scalps, plastered with offensive oils, they are  perfectly hideous. If people only knew how much esteem they lose through  such defects, they would give more attention to the matter. The hair  should be shampooed often enough to keep it clean and fluffy. How often  that is depends on the nature of the hair and the occupation of the  owner. Usually once in two weeks is often enough, but light, oily hair  may require it more frequently, for it loses much of its beauty when  oily. To promote the growth of the hair, massage of the scalp usually  brings very satisfactory results, stimulating a new growth and healthy  appearance. The value of tonics often is in the massage. Many of the  hair tonics and shampoos on the market not only are not beneficial, but  are dangerous. An ordinary egg shampoo, which may be prepared at home,  is perhaps the best, for it not only cleanses but nourishes the hair.    I must remind you of a part of your body that many people notice very  often and by it judge if you are careless. That is your hands and nails.  People who are careful about the appearance of their nails usually are  careful about other things. You will find as you grow older that you are  judged a good deal by the little things. It will pay you to get up half  an hour earlier if necessary so as to give yourself time for those  little personal attentions that help to make a girl dainty. You will be  surprised at the effect on your mind of extra well-brushed hair, clear,  bright complexion, polished nails and a well-put-on tie, also neat  gloves and shoes.                 *       *       *       *       *      Hush, my dear, lie still and slumber,      Holy angels guard thy bed!    Heavenly blessings without number      Gently falling on thy head.      Watts.           *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER VII    REST AND SLEEP      You have seen, Violet, how all the parts of the body work together,  although each one has its especial part to do. You remember, we found  the stomach must have a time to rest between meals. The other parts of  the body require rest, too. This they usually get while we are asleep.  We must not be neglectful and fail to give them enough rest, or they  will soon get worn out and give us trouble. Most little girls require  eight or ten hours' rest every night.    Sometimes, when people are not well or are all tired out, they find they  cannot sleep well at night. There are a number of little things that  can be done to induce sleep. A warm bath before retiring, followed by  a gentle massage, especially along the spine, often will, by relaxing  the nerves and muscles, produce very good results. A hot foot bath,  which draws the blood away from the brain, frequently will be found  beneficial. A glass of hot milk or cocoa, taken just before retiring,  often will have the same effect. If the sleeplessness is a result of  indigestion, a plain diet will relieve. Sleeping upon a hard bed without  any pillow sometimes produces the desired effect. Always have plenty of  fresh air in the room. Keep the mind free from the cares of the day.  If they will intrude, crowd them out by repeating something else--some  soothing sentence or bit of poetry. One good plan is to close the left  nostril by pressing on it with the finger, then take four deep breaths  through the right nostril. Then close the right nostril and take four  deep breaths through the left one. Repeat this about four times. Then  breathe slowly through both nostrils, but count your breaths. You seldom  will count very many. Never take any sleeping powders or tablets except  upon the advice of a physician, for they usually contain drugs that  will injure the heart.    You will find, Violet, that you will meet a number of women who are  nervous, which means they have not control of their nerves, but let  them run away with them. Sometimes this is shown in palpitation of  the heart, headache, backache, and many other disorders. There may  be a tendency to cry at trivial things, or a feeling of having \"the  blues.\" The cause usually can be found in uncongenial surroundings or  occupation, loss of friends, or real or fancied troubles. Whatever the  cause, it should be removed, if possible, and measures taken to restore  the worn out nerves that are crying for rest or food. Tonics help, so  does nourishing food, such as eggs and milk; also a change of scene and  occupation, if possible. A woman who is nervous frequently does not  realize what is the cause of her condition, and considers only the  symptoms. So when she has a headache, resorts to headache powders or  various effervescing drinks. In taking these she only is deadening the  pain and not removing the cause, so the pain is liable to return. Most  of the remedies taken for headache contain some harmful drug. If you  look carefully at the label, you usually will find that they contain  morphine, phenacetin, or acetanilid, which are very depressing to the  heart. Pain is the cry of tortured nerves, so if one suffers from  headaches or backaches, she should not take any of these harmful  drugs, but should hunt for the cause of the pain and remove that.                 *       *       *       *       *      Even from the body's purity, the mind    Receives a secret sympathetic aid.      Thomson.           *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER IX    INJURY OF THE NEST      We who love birds would not do anything to injure their homes, but  there are some children who have not learned to love birds or who are  thoughtless and injure their nests, sometimes even tearing them to  pieces or breaking off the limb of the tree.    There also are thoughtless children who do things to injure their  bodies. You would think it very foolish to allow someone to put a bee  on your face that would sting you and yet there are some thoughtless  children who would do just that if you would let them. They might even  try to tell you it would not hurt you, but of course you would know  better. You, who know how necessary is every part of the body, would not  allow anyone to injure any part of it, especially the part that contains  the mother nest. Think how badly the mother bird must have felt when the  child destroyed the nest, and think how badly you would feel, when it  came time for you to marry and have a baby, if you found the nest had  been so injured that you could not have any. You know, the nest as well  as the rest of the body belongs to you alone, and no one has a right to  injure it, but sometimes girls are as careless or as thoughtless as the  boy with the bee and do things that are harmful. I have told you how to  care for this mother nest so it will grow well and strong, but now I  must tell you something more. As you go out in the world you will meet  some"]]]
