Motherhood and the future of the  race were systematically belittled. Paternity is but a mere incident, it  was argued, in man's life: why should maternity be more than a mere  incident in woman's life? In England, by a curiously perverted form of  sexual attraction, women were so fascinated by the glamour that surrounded  men that they desired to suppress or forget all the facts of organic  constitution which made them unlike men, counting their glory as their  shame, and sought the same education as men, the same occupations as men,  even the same sports. As we know, there was at the origin an element of  rightness in this impulse.[2] It was absolutely right in so far as it was  a claim for freedom from artificial restriction, and a demand for economic  independence. But it became mischievous and absurd when it developed into  a passion for doing, in all respects, the same things as men do; how  mischievous and how absurd we may realize if we imagine men developing a  passion to imitate the ways and avocations of women. Freedom is only good  when it is a freedom to follow the laws of one's own nature; it ceases to  be freedom when it becomes a slavish attempt to imitate others, and would  be disastrous if it could be successful.[3]    At the present day this movement on the theoretical side has ceased to  possess any representatives who exert serious influence. Yet its practical  results are still prominently exhibited in England and the other countries  in which it has been felt. Infantile mortality is enormous, and in England  at all events is only beginning to show a tendency to diminish; motherhood  is without dignity, and the vitality of mothers is speedily crushed, so  that often they cannot so much as suckle their infants; ignorant  girl-mothers give their infants potatoes and gin; on every hand we are  told of the evidence of degeneracy in the race, or if not in the race, at  all events, in the young individuals of to-day.        It would be out of place, and would lead us too far, to discuss      here these various practical outcomes of the foolish attempt to      belittle the immense racial importance of motherhood. It is      enough here to touch on the one point of the excess of infantile      mortality.        In England--which is not from the social point of view in a very      much worse condition than most countries, for in Austria and      Russia the infant mortality is higher still, though in Australia      and New Zealand much lower, but still excessive--more than      one-fourth of the total number of deaths every year is of infants      under one year of age. In the opinion of medical officers of      health who are in the best position to form an opinion, about      one-half of this mortality, roughly speaking, is absolutely      preventable. Moreover, it is doubtful whether there is any real      movement of decrease in this mortality; during the past half      century it has sometimes slightly risen and sometimes slightly      fallen, and though during the past few years the general movement      of mortality for children under five in England and Wales has      shown a tendency to decrease, in London (according to J.F.J.      Sykes, although Sir Shirley Murphy has attempted to minimize the      significance of these figures) the infantile mortality rate for      the first three months of life actually rose from 69 per 1,000 in      the period 1888-1892 to 75 per 1,000 in the period 1898-1901.      (This refers, it must be remembered, to the period before the      introduction of the Notification of Births Act.) In any case,      although the general mortality shows a marked tendency to      improvement there is certainly no adequately corresponding      improvement in the infantile mortality. This is scarcely      surprising, when we realize that there has been no change for the      better, but rather for the worse, in the conditions under which      our infants are born and reared. Thus William Hall, who has had      an intimate knowledge extending over fifty-six years of the slums      of Leeds, and has weighed and measured many thousands of slum      children, besides examining over 120,000 boys and girls as to      their fitness for factory labor, states (_British Medical      Journal_, October 14, 1905) that \"fifty years ago the slum mother      was much more sober, cleanly, domestic, and motherly than she is      to-day; she was herself better nourished and she almost always      suckled her children, and after weaning they received more      nutritious bone-making food, and she was able to prepare more      wholesome food at home.\" The system of compulsory education has      had an unfortunate influence in exerting a strain on the parents      and worsening the conditions of the home. For, excellent as      education is in itself, it is not the primary need of life, and      has been made compulsory before the more essential things of life      have been made equally compulsory. How absolutely unnecessary      this great mortality is may be shown, without evoking the good      example of Australia and New Zealand, by merely comparing small      English towns; thus while in Guildford the infantile death rate      is 65 per thousand, in Burslem it is 205 per thousand.        It is sometimes said that infantile mortality is an economic      question, and that with improvement in wages it would cease. This      is only true to a limited extent and under certain conditions. In      Australia there is no grinding poverty, but the deaths of infants      under one year of age are still between 80 and 90 per thousand,      and one-third of this mortality, according to Hooper (_British      Medical Journal_, 1908, vol. ii, p. 289), being due to the      ignorance of mothers and the dislike to suckling, is easily      preventable. The employment of married women greatly diminishes      the poverty of a family, but nothing can be worse for the welfare      of the woman as mother, or for the welfare of her child. Reid,      the medical officer of health for Staffordshire, where there are      two large centres of artisan population with identical health      conditions, has shown that in the northern centre, where a very      large number of women are engaged in factories, still-births are      three times as frequent as in the southern centre, where there      are practically no trade employments for women; the frequency of      abnormalities is also in the same ratio. The superiority of      Jewish over Christian children, again, and their lower infantile      mortality, seem to be entirely due to the fact that Jewesses are      better mothers. \"The Jewish children in the slums,\" says William      Hall (_British Medical Journal_, October 14, 1905), speaking from      wide and accurate knowledge, \"were superior in weight, in teeth,      and in general bodily development, and they seemed less      susceptible to infectious disease. Yet these Jews were      overcrowded, they took little exercise, and their unsanitary      environment was obvious. The fact was, their children were much      better nourished. The pregnant Jewess was more cared for, and no      doubt supplied better nutriment to the foetus. After the children      were born 90 per cent. received breast-milk, and during later      childhood they were abundantly fed on bone-making material; eggs      and oil, fish, fresh vegetables, and fruit entered largely into      their diet.\" G. Newman, in his important and comprehensive book      on _Infant Mortality_, emphasizes the conclusion that \"first of      all we need a higher standard of physical motherhood.\" The      problem of infantile mortality, he declares (page 259), is not      one of sanitation alone, or housing, or indeed of poverty as      such, \"_but is mainly a question of motherhood_.\"    The fundamental need of the pregnant woman is _rest_. Without a large  degree of maternal rest there can be no puericulture.[4] The task of  creating a man needs the whole of a woman's best energies, more especially  during the three months before birth. It cannot be subordinated to the tax  on strength involved by manual or mental labor, or even strenuous social  duties and amusements. The numerous experiments and observations which  have been made during recent years in Maternity Hospitals, more especially  in France, have shown conclusively that not only the present and future  well-being of the mother and the ease of her confinement, but the fate of  the child, are immensely influenced by rest during the last month of  pregnancy. \"Every working woman is entitled to rest during the last three  months of her pregnancy.\" This formula was adopted by the International  Congress of Hygiene in 1900, but it cannot be practically carried out  except by the cooeperation of the whole community. For it is not enough to  say that a woman ought to rest during pregnancy; it is the business of the  community to ensure that that rest is duly secured. The woman herself, and  her employer, we may be certain, will do their best to cheat the  community, but it is the community which suffers, both economically and  morally, when a woman casts her inferior children into the world, and in  its own interests the community is forced to control both employer and  employed. We can no longer allow it to be said, in Bouchacourt's words,  that \"to-day the dregs of the human species--the blind, the deaf-mute, the  degenerate, the nervous, the vicious, the idiotic, the imbecile, the  cretins and epileptics--are better protected than pregnant women.\"[5]        Pinard, who must always be honored as one of the founders of      eugenics, has, together with his pupils, done much to prepare the      way for the acceptance of this simple but important principle by      making clear the grounds on which it is based. From prolonged      observations on the pregnant"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13618"],[0,"The Cathedral Church of Peterborough (#4)"],[1,"on the Abbey Church of  Peterborough was published among the Transactions of the Architectural  Society of the Archdeaconry of Northampton in 1855, and the late  Professor F.A. Paley, a second edition of whose pamphlet, \"Remarks on  the Architecture of Peterborough Cathedral,\" was issued in 1859. It by  no means detracts from the value of the method employed that the results  of the investigations of these two careful students of the fabric do not  accord with one another. Much must always be left to inference or  conjecture. Since they wrote many discoveries have been made which have  shewn some of their conclusions to have been inaccurate. But the rule  is a sound one, and indeed it is only by studying the documents and the  fabric together that one can hope to learn the history of any great  building.    Thus, when the chronicle records that Abbot Martin completed the  presbytery, and that then the monks entered into the new church, we  should naturally understand that he built no more than the existing  choir and its aisles. But there can be little doubt that his work  included the eastern bays and aisles of both transepts. The style of the  architecture speaks for itself, \"the stones tell their own tale,\" and  the most careful study, and the most painstaking investigations, have  failed to detect the slightest break in the continuity or character of  the work. This applies to the whole of the eastern part of the  transepts, excepting of course the alterations that were made in later  times. As Martin remained abbot till 1155, it is probable that he went  on with his building after the choir had been opened, and that this work  in the transepts was done in the latter part of his abbacy, but there is  no record of it.    Of Abbot William of Waterville (1155-1175) we are told that in his time  were erected the transepts (_ambae cruces_) and three stages of the  central tower (_tres ystoriae magistrae turris_). This does not contradict  what has been said above as to the eastern part of the transepts being  built in Abbot Martin's time. For the walls and aisles to the east only  would be in position; and his successor might well be credited with the  erection of the transepts, if he built the ends and western walls, and  roofed in the whole. It is tolerably clear also that this same abbot  must have built the two bays of the nave adjoining the central tower. A  tower of three stages, presumably of the massive character that marks  all large Norman towers, must have had some western supports. Two bays  of the nave would act as buttresses; and it is easy to see the  difference between these two bays and the rest of the nave. Apart from  many minute points of difference which only an expert architectural  student could fully appreciate, there is one conspicuous variation which  all can see. This is in the tympanum of the triforium arches; in all  four instances we notice rugged ornamentation here which occurs nowhere  else in the nave.    Exclusive of the western transept we may assign eighty years as the  period during which the Norman Minster was being erected. And it is one  of the most noteworthy points in connection with its architectural  history, and one that has produced the happiest result in the grandeur  of the whole effect of the building upon the spectator, that each  successive architect carried on faithfully the ideas of his  predecessors. The whole work has been continued, as it were, in the  spirit of one design; and the differences in details, while quite  observable when once pointed out, are yet so unobtrusive that they  seldom attract notice. To mention one such instance, Mr Paley calls  attention to the different ornamentation on the windows of the south  transept when compared with those in the north transept, as well as to  the fact that on the south those windows have straight sides to the  inner surface of the wall, while those on the north have the sides  splayed. He justly argues, from these and other considerations, that the  south transept was built first.    To Abbot William of Waterville succeeded Benedict (1177-1193). Of him we  are told that he built the whole nave in stone and wood-work, from the  tower of the choir to the front, and also erected a rood-loft. He built  also the great gate-way at the west of the precincts, with the chapel of  S. Nicolas above it, the chapel of S. Thomas of Canterbury and the  hospital attached to it, the great hall with the buildings connected;  and he also commenced that wonderful work (_illud mirificum opus_) near  the brewery, but his death occurred before it could be completed. What  this last named great work was we do not know. It is at least possible  that the reference is to the western transept.    Considerable controversy has arisen as to the work in the church thus  attributed to Benedict. Both chronicles give him credit for building the  whole nave from the tower of the choir to the front. The wording,  however, of the two is so similar as to cause some doubt as to their  being independent authorities. Granting that some small portion of the  nave to the east, as before described, must have been built as a support  to Waterville's tower, the question remains, what is the front to which  this record alludes? There is of course no doubt that the words speak of  the nave only, exclusive of the front. But was this the present west  front, as now remaining, or was there previously a Norman front to the  church? There is much to be said on both sides. Mr Paley believes the  latter; Mr Poole, the former. And possibly the true solution may be  found in a combination of both theories, though at first sight that  seems impossible. That a west front in Norman times was designed, and in  part built, Mr Paley has shewn most conclusively. He indeed thinks it  was finished, but that is open to considerable doubt. The evidence on  which he proves that two western towers were at least designed is quite  conclusive; and the whole passage in which he discusses the matter may  be quoted.[9] \"Proceeding towards the west end of the nave, we observe a  very singular feature. The third pillar from the west end on each side  is considerably larger and wider than the others; and it also projects  further into the aisles. The arch also, springing from it westward, is  of a much greater span. The opposite vaulting shafts, in the aisle  walls, are brought forward, beyond the line of the rest, to meet the  pillars in question; so that the arch across the aisles is, in this  part, very much contracted, and, instead of being a mere groin rib, like  the rest, is a strong moulded arch of considerable depth in the soffit.  What appears at first sight, still more strange, the wall of the aisles  opposite to the wider nave-arch just mentioned, is brought forward at  least a foot internally, but again retires to the old level at the last  bay; so that in this particular part the whole thickness of the  aisle-wall is considerably greater. Not less remarkable is the  circumstance, that the half-pillars on each side of this wider arch  resume the complex[10] form already described at the eastern end of the  nave, though they do not accurately agree either in plan or details....  Now it seems highly probable that it was at this very spot that it  [_i.e._, a Norman west front] stood, with two flanking Norman towers at  the end of the aisles. The wider nave-arch, with its massive and complex  pillars, was the entrance into the tower from each side of the nave. The  thicker aisle-wall opposite to it was, in fact, _the tower wall_. The  larger and heavier group of vaulting-shafts against the aisle-wall, and  the strong arch spanning the aisle across this point in place of the  groin-rib, were all parts of the tower.... The transformation of the  base of these two immense towers into a compartment of the aisle, so  similar to all the rest that its real nature has never been hitherto  suspected, is highly ingenious. It is only when once detected that the  anomalies above mentioned are at all intelligible.\"    These arguments prove to demonstration that the intention was to make  the Norman church end at the spot where now stand the third pillars of  the nave; and that the two western towers had begun to be built. As an  after thought another bay was added to the nave, with western transept,  and last of all the grand west front was another after thought. But they  do not establish the fact that the towers were ever finished, or the  Norman west front actually erected. The considerations adduced are  perfectly consistent with the theory that the additional length of the  nave was decided upon while the towers were still unfinished, and the  lower part of the towers transformed as Mr Paley has described. Thus we  combine the rival theories. For Mr Poole[11] maintains that the point,  up to which Benedict's work was carried, must mean the front we now see.  One argument he advances appears unanswerable.[12] Of the two  chroniclers, Swapham takes his history down to 1246; Abbot John ruled  from 1249 to 1262. Both these writers therefore, beyond all question,  were alive when the present front was finished. \"Here are two people  writing after the present west front was erected, and for persons before  whose eyes the present west front appeared every day, and speaking of  the tower and of the west front as well-known limits to a certain work.  Surely they not only meant, but _must have meant_, the front that _then_  was, in other words, the west front as it is _now_.\"    The conclusion of the controversy may perhaps not yet have been reached.  But all the difficulties appear to be explained by understanding that  Benedict's work extended to the west end of the present nave, and that  he carried the whole building further west than was originally intended,  and managed to do this without destroying the lower part of the towers  which had actually been raised.    When, therefore,"]]]
