The coats of an artery, when diseased,  may be torn by a severe strain, the blood escaping into the condensed  tissues which thus form the aneurysmal sac.    The division, of aneurysms into two classes, _true_ and _false_, is  unsatisfactory. On the face of it, an aneurysm which is false is not  an aneurysm, any more than a false bank-note is legal tender. A better  classification is into _spontaneous_ and _traumatic_. The man who has  chronic inflammation of a large artery, the result, for instance, of  gout, arduous, straining work, or kidney-disease, and whose artery  yields under cardiac pressure, has a _spontaneous_ aneurysm; the  barman or window-cleaner who has cut his radial artery, the soldier  whose brachial or femoral artery has been bruised by a rifle bullet  or grazed by a bayonet, and the boy whose naked foot is pierced by  a sharp nail, are apt to be the subjects of _traumatic_ aneurysm.  In those aneurysms which are a _saccular_ bulging on one side of the  artery the blood may be induced to coagulate, or may of itself deposit  layer upon layer of pale clot, until the sac is obliterated. This  laminar coagulation by constant additions gradually fills the  aneurysmal cavity and the pulsation in the sac then ceases;  contraction of the sac and its contents gradually takes place and  the aneurysm is cured. But in those aneurysms which are _fusiform_  dilatations of the vessel there is but slight chance of such cure, for  the blood sweeps evenly through it without staying to deposit clot or  laminated fibrine.    In the treatment of aneurysm the aim is generally to lower the blood  pressure by absolute rest and moderated diet, but a cure is rarely  effected except by operation, which, fortunately, is now resorted  to more promptly and securely than was previously the case.  Without trying the speculative and dangerous method of treatment  by compression, or the application of an india rubber bandage, the  surgeon now without loss of time cuts down upon the artery, and  applies an aseptic ligature close above the dilatation. Experience  has shown that this method possesses great advantages, and that it has  none of the disadvantages which were formerly supposed to attend it.  Saccular dilatations of arteries which are the result of cuts or  other injuries are treated by tying the vessel above and below, and by  dissecting out the aneurysm. Popliteal, carotid and other aneurysms,  which are not of traumatic origin, are sometimes dealt with on this  plan, which is the old \"Method of Antyllus\" with modern aseptic  conditions. Speaking generally, if an aneurysm can be dealt with  surgically the sooner that the artery is tied the better. Less heroic  measures are too apt to prove painful, dangerous, ineffectual and  disappointing. For anturysm in the chest or abdomen (which cannot be  dealt with by operation) the treatment may be tried of injecting a  pure solution of gelatine into the loose tissues of the armpit, so  that the gelatine may find its way into the blood stream and increase  the chance of curative coagulation in the distant aneurysmal sac.    (E.O.)        ANFRACTUOSITY (from Lat. _anfractuosus_, winding), twisting and  turning, circuitousness; a word usually employed in the plural to  denote winding channels such as occur in the depths of the sea,  mountains, or the fissures (_sulci_) separating the convolutions of  the brain, or, by analogy, in the mind.        ANGARIA (from [Greek: aggaros], the Greek form of a Babylonian word  adopted in Persian for \"mounted courier\"), a sort of postal system  adopted by the Roman imperial government from the ancient Persians,  among whom, according to Xenophon (_Cyrop._ viii. 6; cf. Herodotus  viii. 98) it was established by Cyrus the Great. Couriers on horseback  were posted at certain stages along the chief roads of the empire, for  the transmission of royal despatches by night and day in all weathers.  In the Roman system the supply of horses and their maintenance was a  compulsory duty from which the emperor alone could grant exemption.  The word, which in the 4th century was used for the heavy transport  vehicles of the cursus publicus, and also for the animals by which  they were drawn, came to mean generally \"compulsory service.\" So  _angaria_, _angariare_, in medieval Latin, and the rare English  derivatives \"angariate,\" \"angariation,\" came to mean any service which  was forcibly or unjustly demanded, and oppression in general.        ANGARY (Lat. _jus angariae_; Fr. _droit d'angarie_; Ger. _Angarie_;  from the Gr. [Greek: aggareia], the office of an [Greek: aggaros],  courier or messenger), the name given to the right of a belligerent to  seize and apply for the purposes of war (or to prevent the enemy from  doing so) any kind of property on, belligerent territory, including  that which may belong to subjects or citizens of a neutral state. Art.  53 of the Regulations respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land,  annexed to the Hague Convention of 1899 on the same subject, provides  that railway plant, land telegraphs, telephones, steamers and other  ships (other than such as are governed by maritime law), though  belonging to companies or private persons, _may be used_ for military  operations, but \"must be restored at the conclusion of peace _and_  indemnities paid for them.\" And Art. 54 adds that \"the plant of  railways coming from neutral states, whether the property of those  states or of companies or private persons, shall be sent back to them  as soon as possible.\" These articles seem to sanction the right of  angary against neutral property, while limiting it as against both  belligerent and neutral property. It may be considered, however,  that the right to use implies as wide a range of contingencies as the  \"necessity of war\" can be made to cover.    (T. BA.)        ANGEL, a general term denoting a subordinate superhuman being in  monotheistic religions, _e.g._. Islam, Judaism, Christianity, and in  allied religions, such as Zoroastrianism. In polytheism the grades of  superhuman beings are continuous; but in monotheism there is a sharp  distinction of kind, as well as degree, between God on the one hand,  and all other superhuman beings on the other; the latter are the  \"angels.\"    \"Angel\" is a transcription of the Gr. [Greek: angelos], messenger.  [Greek: angelos] in the New Testament, and the corresponding _mal'akh_  in the Old Testament, sometimes mean \"messenger,\" and sometimes  \"angel,\" and this double sense is duly represented in the English  Versions. \"Angel\" is also used in the English Version for [Hebrew:]  _'Abbir_, Ps. lxxviii. 25. (lit. \"mighty\"), for [Hebrew:]  _'Elohim_, Ps. viii. 5, and for the obscure [Hebrew:] _shin'an_,  in Ps. lxviii. 17.    [v.02 p.0005]    In the later development of the religion of Israel, _'Elohim_ is  almost entirely reserved for the one true God; but in earlier times  _'Elohim_ (gods), _bn[=e] 'Elohim, bn[=e] Elim_ (sons of gods,  _i.e._ members of the class of divine beings) were general terms  for superhuman beings. Hence they came to be used collectively of  superhuman beings, distinct from Yahweh, and therefore inferior,  and ultimately subordinate.[1] So, too, the angels are styled \"holy  ones,\"[2] and \"watchers,\"[3] and are spoken of as the \"host of  heaven\"[4] or of \"Yahweh.\"[5] The \"hosts,\" [Hebrew:] _Sebaoth_ in  the title _Yahweh Sebaoth_, Lord of Hosts, were probably at one time  identified with the angels.[6] The New Testament often speaks of  \"spirits,\" [Greek: pneumata].[7] In the earlier periods of the  religion of Israel, the doctrine of monotheism had not been formally  stated, so that the idea of \"angel\" in the modern sense does not  occur, but we find the _Mal'akh Yahweh_, Angel of the Lord, or  _Mal'akh Elohim_, Angel of God. The _Mal'akh Yahweh_ is an appearance  or manifestation of _Yahweh_ in the form of a man, and the term  _Mal'akh Yahweh_ is used interchangeably with Yahweh (cf. Exod. iii.  2, with iii. 4; xiii. 21 with xiv. 19). Those who see the _Mal'akh  Yahweh_ say they have seen God.[8] The _Mal'akh Yahweh_ (or _Elohim_)  appears to Abraham, Hagar, Moses, Gideon, &c., and leads the  Israelites in the Pillar of Cloud.[9] The phrase _Mal'akh Yahweh_ may  have been originally a courtly circumlocution for the Divine King;  but it readily became a means of avoiding crude anthropomorphism, and  later on, when the angels were classified, the _Mal'akh Yahweh_ came  to mean an angel of distinguished rank.[10] The identification of the  _Mal'akh Yahweh_ with the _Logos_, or Second Person of the Trinity, is  not indicated by the references in the Old Testament; but the idea  of a Being partly identified with God, and yet in some sense distinct  from Him, illustrates the tendency of religious thought to distinguish  persons within the unity of the Godhead, and foreshadows the doctrine  of the Trinity, at any rate in some slight degree.    In the earlier literature the _Mal'akh Yahweh_ or _Elohim_ is almost  the only _mal'akh_ (\"angel\") mentioned. There are, however, a few  passages which speak of subordinate superhuman beings other than the  _Mal'akh Yahweh_ or _Elohim_. There are the cherubim who guard Eden.  In Gen. xviii., xix. (J) the appearance of Yahweh to Abraham and  Lot is connected with three, afterwards two, men or messengers; but  possibly in the original form of the story Yahweh appeared alone.[11]  At Bethel, Jacob sees the angels of God on the ladder,[12] and later  on they appear to him at Mahanaim.[13] In all these cases the  angels, like the _Mal'akh Yahweh_, are connected with or represent a  theophany. Similarly the \"man\" who wrestles with Jacob at Peniel is  identified with God.[14] In Isaiah vi. the seraphim, superhuman  beings with six wings, appear as the attendants of Yahweh.

Slave homes were very  simple and only contained a home made table, chair and bed which were  made of the same type of wood and could easily be cleaned by scouring  with sand every Saturday. The beds were bottomed with rope which was run  backward and forward from one rail to the other. On this framework was  placed a mattress of wheat straw. Each spring the mattresses were  emptied and refilled with fresh wheat straw.    Slaves were required to prepare their own meals three times a day. This  was done in a big open fire place which was filled with hot coals. The  master did not give them much of a variety of food, but allowed each  family to raise their own vegetables. Each family was given a hand out  of bacon and meal on Saturdays and through the week corn ash cakes and  meat; which had been broiled on the hot coals was the usual diet found  in each home. The diet did not vary even at Christmas only a little  fruit was added.    Each family was provided with a loom and in Mrs. Avery's family, her  grandmother, Sylvia Heard, did most of the carding and spinning of the  thread into cloth. The most common cloth for women clothes was homespun,  and calico. This same cloth was dyed and used to make men shirts and  pants. Dye was prepared by taking a berry known as the shumake berry and  boiling them with walnut peelings. Spring and fall were the seasons for  masters to give shoes and clothing to their slaves. Both men and women  wore brogan shoes, the only difference being the piece in the side of  the womens.    One woman was required to do the work around the house there was also  one slave man required to work around the house doing odd jobs. Other  than these two every one else was required to do the heavy work in the  fields. Work began at \"sun up\" and lasted until \"sun down\". In the  middle of the day the big bell was rung to summon the workers from the  field, for their mid-day lunch. After work hours slaves were then free  to do work around their own cabins, such as sewing, cooking (etc.)    \"Once a week Mr. Heard allowed his slaves to have a frolic and folks  would get broke down from so much dancing\" Mrs. Avery remarked. The  music was furnished with fiddles. When asked how the slaves came to own  fiddles she replied, \"They bought them with money they earned selling  chickens.\" At night slaves would steal off from the Heard plantation, go  to LaGrange, Ga. and sell chickens which they had raised. Of course the  masters always required half of every thing raised by each slave and it  was not permissible for any slave to sell anything. Another form of  entertainment was the quilting party. Every one would go together to  different person's home on each separate night of the week and finish  that person's quilts. Each night this was repeated until every one had a  sufficient amount of covering for the winter. Any slave from another  plantation, desiring to attend these frolics, could do so after securing  a pass from their master.    Mrs. Avery related the occasion when her Uncle William was caught off  the Heard plantation without a pass, and was whipped almost to death by  the \"Pader Rollers.\" He stole off to the depths of the woods here he  built a cave large enough to live in. A few nights later he came back to  the plantation unobserved and carried his wife and two children back to  this cave where they lived until after freedom. When found years later  his wife had given birth to two children. No one was ever able to find  his hiding place and if he saw any one in the woods he would run like a  lion.    Mr. Heard was a very mean master and was not liked by any one of his  slaves. Secretly each one hated him. He whipped unmercifully and in most  cases unnecessarily. However, he sometimes found it hard to subdue some  slaves who happened to have very high tempers. In the event this was the  case he would set a pack of hounds on him. Mrs. Avery related to the  writer the story told to her of Mr. Heard's cruelty by her grandmother.  The facts were as follows: \"Every morning my grandmother would pray, and  old man Heard despised to hear any one pray saying they were only doing  so that they might become free niggers. Just as sure as the sun would  rise, she would get a whipping; but this did not stop her prayers every  morning before day. This particular time grandmother Sylvia was in  \"family way\" and that morning she began to pray as usual. The master  heard her and became so angry he came to her cabin seized and pulled her  clothes from her body and tied her to a young sapling. He whipped her so  brutally that her body was raw all over. When darkness fell her husband  cut her down from the tree, during the day he was afraid to go near her.  Rather than go back to the cabin she crawled on her knees to the woods  and her husband brought grease for her to grease her raw body. For two  weeks the master hunted but could not find her; however, when he finally  did, she had given birth to twins. The only thing that saved her was the  fact that she was a mid-wife and always carried a small pin knife which  she used to cut the navel cord of the babies. After doing this she tore  her petticoat into two pieces and wrapped each baby. Grandmother Sylvia  lived to get 115 years old.    Not only was Mr. Henderson cruel but it seemed that every one he hired  in the capacity of overseer was just as cruel. For instance, Mrs.  Henderson's grandmother Sylvia, was told to take her clothes off when  she reached the end of a row. She was to be whipped because she had not  completed the required amount of hoeing for the day. Grandmother  continued hoeing until she came to a fence; as the overseer reached out  to grab her she snatched a fence railing and broke it across his arms.  On another occasion grandmother Sylvia ran all the way to town to tell  the master that an overseer was beating her husband to death. The master  immediately jumped on his horse and started for home; and reaching the  plantation he ordered the overseer to stop whipping the old man. Mrs.  Avery received one whipping, with a hair brush, for disobedience; this  was given to her by the mistress.    Slaves were given separate churches, but the minister, who conducted the  services, was white. Very seldom did the text vary from the usual one of  obedience to the master and mistress, and the necessity for good  behavior. Every one was required to attend church, however, the only  self expression they could indulge in without conflict with the master  was that of singing. Any one heard praying was given a good whipping;  for most masters thought their prayers no good since freedom was the  uppermost thought in every one's head.    On the Heard plantation as on a number of others, marriages were made by  the masters of the parties concerned. Marriage licenses were unheard of.  If both masters mutually consented, the marriage ceremony was considered  over with. After that the husband was given a pass to visit his wife  once a week. In the event children were born the naming of them was left  entirely to the master. Parents were not allowed to name them.    Health of slaves was very important to every slave owner for loss of  life meant loss of money to them. Consequently they would call in their  family doctor, if a slave became seriously ill. In minor cases of  illness home remedies were used. \"In fact,\" Mrs. Avery smilingly  remarked, \"We used every thing for medicine that grew in the ground.\"  One particular home remedy was known as \"Cow foot oil\" which was made by  boiling cow's feet in water. Other medicines used were hoarhound tea,  catnip tea, and castor oil. Very often medicines and doctors failed to  save life; and whenever a slave died he was buried the same day. Mrs.  Avery remarked, \"If he died before dinner the funeral and burial usually  took place immediately after dinner.\"    Although a very young child, Mrs. Avery remembers the frantic attempt  slave owners made to hide their money when the war broke out. The  following is a story related concerning the Heard family. \"Mr. Heard,  our master, went to the swamp, dug a hole, and hid his money, then he  and his wife left for town on their horses. My oldest brother, Percy,  saw their hiding place; and when the Yanks came looking for the money,  he carried them straight to the swamps and showed than where the money  was hidden.\" Although the Yeard [TR: typo \"Heard\"] farm was in the  country the highway was very near and Mrs. Avery told of the long army  of soldiers marching to La Grange singing the following song: \"Rally  around the flag boys, rally around the flag, joy, joy, for freedom.\"  When the war ended Mr. Heard visited every slave home and broke the news  to each family that they were free people and if they so desired could  remain on his plantation. Mrs. Avery's family moved away, in fact most  slave families did, for old man Heard had been such a cruel master  everyone was anxious to get away from him. However, one year later he  sold his plantation to Mr George Traylor and some of the families moved  back, Mrs. Avery's family included.    Mrs. Avery married at the age of 16; and was the mother of 14 children,  three of whom are still living. Although she has had quite a bit of  illness during her life, at present she is quite well and active in  spite of her old age. She assured the writer that the story of slavery,  which she had given her, was a true one and sincerely hoped it would do  some good in this world.          FOLKLORE (Negro)  Minnie B. Ross    [MRS.
