(#4)"],[1," principles.    _First._ The fixed and unvarying laws of nature which regulate matter  and mind.    _Second._ The agreement of those who use it.    In accordance with these principles all language must be explained. It  is not only needless but impossible for us to deviate from them. They  remain the same in all ages and in all countries. It should be the  object of the grammarian, and of all who employ language in the  expression of ideas, to become intimately acquainted with their use.    It is the business of grammar to explain, not only verbal language, but  also the sublime principles upon which all written or spoken language  depends. It forms an important part of physical and mental science,  which, correctly explained, is abundantly simple and extensively useful  in its application to the affairs of human life and the promotion of  human enjoyment.    It will not be contended that we are assuming a position beyond the  capacities of learners, that the course here adopted is too philosophic.  Such is not the fact. Children are philosophers by nature. All their  ideas are derived from things as presented to their observations. No  mother learns her child to lisp the name of a thing which has no being,  but she chooses objects with which it is most familiar, and which are  most constantly before it; such as father, mother, brother, sister.    She constantly points to the object named, that a distinct impression  may be made upon its mind, and the thing signified, the idea of the  thing, and the name which represents it, are all inseparably associated  together. If the father is absent, the child may _think_ of him from the  idea or impression which his person and affection has produced in the  mind. If the mother pronounces his _name_ with which it has become  familiar, the child will start, look about for the object, or thing  signified by the _name_, father, and not being able to discover him,  will settle down contented with the _idea_ of him deeply impressed on  the mind, and as distinctly understood as if the father was present in  person. So with every thing else.    Again, after the child has become familiar with the name of the being  called father; the name, idea and object itself being intimately  associated the mother will next begin to teach it another lesson;  following most undeviatingly the course which nature and true philosophy  mark out. The father comes and goes, is present or absent. She says on  his return, father _come_, and the little one looks round to see the  thing signified by the word father, the idea of which is distinctly  impressed on the mind, and which it now sees present before it. But this  loved object has not always been here. It had looked round and called  for the father. But the mother had told it _he was gone_. Father gone,  father come, is her language, and here the child begins to learn ideas  of actions. Of this it had, at first, no notion whatever, and never  thought of the father except when his person was present before it, for  no impressions had been distinctly made upon the mind which could be  called up by a sound of which it could have no conceptions whatever. Now  that it has advanced so far, the idea of the father is retained, even  tho he is himself absent, and the child begins to associate the notion  of coming and going with his presence or absence. Following out this  course the mind becomes acquainted with things and actions, or the  changes which things undergo.    Next, the mother begins to learn her offspring the distinction and  qualities of things. When the little sister comes to it in innocent  playfulness the mother says, \"_good_ sister,\" and with the descriptive  word _good_ it soon begins to associate the quality expressed by the  affectionate regard, of its sister. But when that sister strikes the  child, or pesters it in any way, the mother says \"_naughty_ sister,\"  \"bad sister.\" It soon comprehends the descriptive words, _good_ and  _bad_, and along with them carries the association of ideas which such  conduct produces. In the same way it learns to distinguish the  difference between _great_ and _small_, _cold_ and _hot_, hard and soft.    In this manner the child becomes acquainted with the use of language. It  first becomes acquainted with things, the idea of which is left upon the  mind, or, more properly, the _impression of which_, left on the mind,  _constitutes the idea_; and a vocabulary of words are learned, which  represent these ideas, from which it may select those best calculated  to express its meaning whenever a conversation is had with another.    You will readily perceive the correctness of our first proposition, that  all language depends on the fixed and unerring laws of nature. Things  exist. A knowledge of them produces ideas in the mind, and sounds or  signs are adopted as vehicles to convey these ideas from one to another.    It would be absurd and ridiculous to suppose that any person, however  great, or learned, or wise, could employ language correctly without a  knowledge of the things expressed by that language. No matter how chaste  his words, how lofty his phrases, how sweet the intonations, or mellow  the accents. It would avail him nothing if _ideas_ were not represented  thereby. It would all be an unknown tongue to the hearer or reader. It  would not be like the loud rolling thunder, for that tells the wondrous  power of God. It would not be like the soft zephyrs of evening, the  radiance of the sun, the twinkling of the stars; for they speak the  intelligible language of sublimity itself, and tell of the kindness and  protection of our Father who is in heaven. It would not be like the  sweet notes of the choral songsters of the grove, for they warble hymns  of gratitude to God; not like the boding of the distant owl, for that  tells the profound solemnity of night; not like the hungry lion roaring  for his prey, for that tells of death and plunder; not like the distant  notes of the clarion, for that tells of blood and carnage, of tears and  anguish, of widowhood and orphanage. It can be compared to nothing but a  Babel of confusion in which their own folly is worse confounded. And  yet, I am sorry to say it, the languages of all ages and nations have  been too frequently perverted, and compiled into a heterogeneous mass  of abstruse, metaphysical volumes, whose only recommendation is the  elegant bindings in which they are enclosed.    And grammars themselves, whose pretended object is to teach the rules of  speaking and writing correctly, form but a miserable exception to this  sweeping remark. I defy any grammarian, author, or teacher of the  numberless systems, which come, like the frogs of Egypt, all of one  genus, to cover the land, to give a reasonable explanation of even the  terms they employ to define their meaning, if indeed, meaning they have.  What is meant by an \"_in_-definite article,\" a _dis_-junctive  _con_-junction, an _ad_-verb which qualifies an _adjective_, and  \"sometimes another _ad_-verb?\" Such \"parts of speech\" have no existence  in fact, and their adoption in rules of grammar, have been found  exceedingly mischievous and perplexing. \"Adverbs and conjunctions,\" and  \"_adverbial_ phrases,\" and \"conjunctive expressions,\" may serve as  common sewers for a large and most useful class of words, which the  teachers of grammar and lexicographers have been unable to explain; but  learners will gain little information by being told that such is an  _adverbial phrase_, and such, a _conjunctive expression_. This is an  easy method, I confess, a sort of wholesale traffic, in parsing  (_passing_) language, and may serve to cloak the ignorance of the  teachers and makers of grammars. But it will reflect little light on the  principles of language, or prove very efficient helps to \"speak or write  with propriety.\" Those who _think_, will demand the _meaning_ of these  words, and the reason of their use. When that is ascertained, little  difficulty will be found in giving them a place in the company of  respectable words. But I am digressing. More shall be said upon this  point in a future lecture, and in its proper place.    I was endeavoring to establish the position that all language depends  upon permanent principles; that words are the signs of ideas, and ideas  are the impressions of things communicated to the mind thro the medium  of some one of the five senses. I think I have succeeded so far as  simple material things are concerned, to the satisfaction of all who  have heard me. It may, perhaps, be more difficult for me to explain the  words employed to express complex ideas, and things of immateriality,  such as mind, and its attributes. But the rules previously adopted will,  I apprehend, apply with equal ease and correctness in this case; and we  shall have cause to admire the simple yet sublime foundation upon which  the whole superstructure of language is based.    In pursuing this investigation I shall endeavor to avoid all abstruse  and metaphysical reasoning, present no wild conjectures, or vain  hypotheses; but confine myself to plain, common place matter of fact. We  have reason to rejoice that a wonderful improvement in the science and  cultivation of the mind has taken place in these last days; that we are  no longer puzzled with the strange phantoms, the wild speculations which  occupied the giant minds of a Descartes, a Malebranch, a Locke, a Reid,  a Stewart, and hosts of others, whose shining talents would have  qualified them for the brightest ornaments of literature, real  benefactors of mankind, had not their education lead them into dark and  metaphysical reasonings, a continued tissue of the wildest vagaries, in  which they became entangled, till, at length, they were entirely lost in  the labyrinth of their own conjectures.    The occasion of all their difficulty originated in an attempt to  investigate the faculties of the mind without any means of getting at  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17606"],[0,"Throwing-sticks in the National Museum (#4)"],[1,"harpoon, thrown without the stick, and on the  heavy, ivory-weighted walrus-harpoon-shaft an ivory hand-rest is lashed  just behind the center of gravity. This little object is often  beautifully carved and prevents effectually the hand from slipping on  the shaft, even with the greatest lunge of the hunter. From this object  to the throwing-stick the way may be long and crooked, or there may be  no way at all. So far as the National Museum is concerned there is  nothing to guide us over this waste of ignorance.

(Mason. Throwing-sticks.)    Fig. 1. Eskimo launching a seal harpoon by means of the  throwing-stick. Mr. John Murdoch states that the hand is held much lower  by the Point Barrow Eskimo, the harpoon resting as low as the shoulder,  and that the movement of throwing the harpoon is quick, as in casting a  fly in fishing.    [Illustration: Fig. 1. Eskimo using the throwing-stick.]      PLATE II.    (Mason. Throwing-sticks.)    Fig. 2. Greenland type of throwing-stick. The specific  characteristics are the broad form; the scanty grooves for thumb and  fingers; the absence of pegs, separate finger grooves, or index  perforation; but the most noteworthy are the two grommets or eyelets to  fit ivory pegs on the harpoon-shaft. The peculiar method of  strengthening the ends with ivory pieces should also be noted. From  Holsteinburg, Greenland, 1884. Catalogue number, 74126.    [Illustration: Fig. 2. Greenland throwing-stick, back and  front.]      PLATE III.    (Mason. Throwing-sticks.)    Fig. 3. Ungava type of throwing-stick. The specific marks are  the general outline, especially the fiddle-head ornament at the bottom;  the bend upward at the lower extremity, the eccentric perforation for  the index finger, and the groove for three fingers. Collected at Ungava,  by Lucien M. Turner, 1884. Museum number, 76700.    [Illustration: Fig. 3. Ungava throwing-stick, front and back.]      PLATE IV.    (Mason. Throwing-sticks.)    Fig. 4. Cumberland Gulf type of throwing-stick. The specific  marks are the broad clumsy form, the separate provision for the thumb  and each finger, the bent lower extremity, and the broad furrow for the  bird-spear. Accidental marks are the mending of the handle, the material  of the stick, and the canine tooth for the spur at the bottom of the  square groove. Collected in Cumberland Gulf, by W.A. Mintzer, in 1876.  Museum number, 30013.    [Illustration: Fig. 4. Cumberland Gulf throwing-stick, back and  front.]      PLATE V.    (Mason. Throwing-sticks.)    Fig. 5. Anderson River type. The specific marks are the extreme  plainness of form, the lack of accommodations for the thumb and fingers,  excepting the eccentric index-finger hole, the poor groove for the  harpoon-shaft, and the absence of a hook or spur at the bottom of this  groove. The accidental marks are cuts running diagonally across the  back. In another specimen seen from the same locality the shaft groove  is squared after the manner of the Cumberland Gulf type. Collected at  the mouth of Anderson River, by R. Kennicott, in 1866. Museum number,  2267.    Fig. 6. Point Barrow type. The specific marks are the distinct  handle without finger grooves, the very eccentric index-finger hole, the  method of inserting the spur for the shaft, and the harpoon-shaft groove  very shallow above and deep below. In the specimens shown by Mr. Murdoch  there is great uniformity of shape. Collected at Point Barrow, by Lieut.  P.H. Ray, in 1883. Museum number, 89902.    [Illustration: Fig. 5. Anderson River throwing-stick, front and  back.  Fig. 6. Point Barrow throwing-stick, front and back.]      PLATE VI.    (Mason. Throwing-sticks.)    Fig. 7. Kotzebue Sound type. The specific marks are the twisted  handle, the broad shallow shaft groove, and, notably, the pocket for the  index-finger tip-visible on the lower side, but nearly absent from the  upper side, and lying directly under the shaft groove. In the examples  before noted all the holes for the index finger are to one side of this  shaft groove. Collected in Kotzebue Sound, by E.P. Herendeen, in 1874.  Museum number, 16235.    Fig. 8. The Rodgers type, so called because the locality is  doubtful. In specific characters it resembles Fig. 7. The differences  are the three cavities for finger tips in the handle, the shaft groove  very shallow and running out before reaching the index-finger cavity,  and the delicate hook for the spear shaft resembling those farther  south. Since writing this paper two throwing-sticks from Sitka have been  seen in many respects resembling this form, but covered all over their  surfaces with characteristic Thlinkit mythological figures, and having  iron hooks at the lower end of the shaft groove. Collected by Commodore  John Rodgers, in 1867. Museum number, 2533.    [Illustration: Fig. 7. Kotzebue Sound throwing-stick, front and  back.  Fig. 8. The Commodore Rodgers throwing-stick, front and back.]      PLATE VII.    (Mason. Throwing-sticks.)    Fig. 9. The Port Clarence and Cape Nome type. The notable  characteristics are the occurrence of an ivory peg in the handle for the  middle finger, the very small size of the handle, and the central  index-finger pocket central in position but quite piercing the stick.  Collected by E.W. Nelson, at Cape Nome, in 1880. Museum number, 44392.    [Illustration: Fig. 9. Port Clarence and Cape Nome  throwing-stick, front and back.]      PLATE VIII.    (Mason. Throwing-sticks.)    Fig. 10. Norton Sound type, single-pegged variety. Except in  the better finish, this type resembles the one last described. Collected  by L.M. Turner, at Saint Michael's Island, in 1876. Museum number,  24338.    [Illustration: Fig. 10. Norton Sound throwing-stick, front and  back.]      PLATE IX.    (Mason. Throwing-sticks.)    Fig. 11. Norton Sound type, two-pegged variety. In all  respects, excepting the number of pegs, this resembles Figs. 9 and 10.  In all of them the peg at the bottom of the groove is very clumsy.  Collected in Norton Sound, by E.W. Nelson, in 1878. Museum number,  32995.    Fig. 12. Throwing-stick from Sabotnisky, on the Lower Yukon. It  belongs to the Norton Sound type. The cavity on the upper side of the  handle for the finger-tips is remarkable for the carving of a bird  resembling figures seen on objects made by the Western Indians of the  United States. Collected by E.W. Nelson, at Sabotnisky, in 1879. Museum  number, 36013.    [Illustration: Fig. 11. Norton Sound throwing-stick, front and  back.  Fig. 12. Sabotnisky throwing-stick, front and back.]      PLATE X.    (Mason. Throwing-sticks.)    Fig. 13. Specimen from Yukon River, belonging to the Northern  Sound one-pegged variety. Collected by E.W. Nelson, in 1879. Museum  number,"]]]
