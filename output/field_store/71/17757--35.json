Foreign nations are trying to steal Uncle  Sam's secrets. If this country gets a big cannon, some other nation  will want a bigger one. It's a constant warfare. I'm going to devote my  talents--such as they are--to Uncle Sam. I'm going to make the biggest  cannon in the world--the one that will shoot the farthest and knock  into smithereens all the other big guns. That's the only way to protect  the canal. Do you understand, Ned?\"    \"Somewhat, Tom. Since I gave up my place in the bank, and became a sort  of handy-lad for you, I know more about your work.  But isn't it going  to be dangerous to make a cannon like that?\"    \"Well, in a way, yes, Ned. But we've got to take chances, just as  father did when he invested ten thousand dollars in that opal mine.  He'll never see his money again.\"    \"Don't you think so?\"    \"No, Ned.\"    \"And when do you expect to start on your gun, Tom?\"    \"Right away. I'm making some plans now. I'm going down to Sandy Hook  and witness the test of this new big cannon. You can come along, if you  like.\"    \"Well, I sure will like. When is it?\"    \"Oh, in about a week. I'll have to look--\"    \"'Scuse me, Massa Tom,\" broke in Eradicate, as he put his head through  the half-opened office door. \"'Scuse me, but dere's a express gen'men  outside, wif his auto truck, an' he's got some packages fo' yo' all,  marked 'dangerous--explosive--an' keep away fom de fire.' He want t'  know what he all gwine t' do wif 'em, Massa Tom?\"    \"Do with 'em? Oh, I guess it's that new giant powder I sent for. Why,  Eradicate, have him bring 'em right in here.\"    \"Yais, sah, Massa Tom. Dat's all right; but he jest can't bring 'em  in,\" and Eradicate looked behind him somewhat apprehensively.    \"Can't bring 'em in? Why not, I'd like to know?\" exclaimed Tom.  \"He's  paid for it.\"    \"'Scuse me, Massa Tom,\" said the colored man, \"but dat express gen'men  can't bring dem explosive powder boxes in heah, 'case as how his  autermobile hab done ketched fire an' he cain't get near it nohow.  Dat's why, Massa Tom!\"    \"Caesar's ghost!\" yelled the young inventor. \"The auto on fire, and  that powder in it! Come on Ned!\" and he made a rush for the door.          CHAPTER IV    KOKU'S BRAVE ACT      \"Tom! Tom!\" cried Ned, as he watched the disappearing figure of his  chum. \"Come back here! If there's going to be an explosion we ought to  run out of the back door!\"    \"I'm not running away!\" flashed back Tom. \"I'm going to get that powder  out of the auto before it goes up! If it does we'll be blown to kingdom  come, back door or front door! Come on!\"    \"Bacon and eggs!\" yelled Ned. \"He's running an awful risk! But I can't  let him go alone! I guess we're in for it!\"    Then he, too, rushed from the office toward the front of the shop,  before which, in a sort of private road, stood the blazing auto. And  Ned, who had now lost sight of Tom, because of our hero having turned a  corner in the corridor, heard excited shouts coming from the seat of  trouble.    \"If that's some new kind of powder Tom's sent for, to test for his new  big gun, and it goes up,\" Ned said to himself, as he rushed on, \"this  place will be blown to smithereens. All Tom's valuable machinery and  patents will be ruined!\"    Ned had now reached the front door of the shop. He had a glimpse of the  burning auto--a small express truck, well loaded with various packages.  And, through the smoke, which from the odor must have been caused by  burning gasoline, Ned could see several boxes marked in red letters:      DANGEROUS            EXPLOSIVE           KEEP AWAY FROM FIRE      \"Keep away from fire!\" murmured the panting lad. \"If they can get any  nearer fire I don't see how.\"    \"Oh, mah golly!\" gasped Eradicate, who had lumbered on behind Ned. \"Oh,  mah golly! Oh, good land ob massy! Look at Massa Tom!\"    \"I've got to help him!\" cried Ned, for he saw that his chum had rushed  to the rear of the auto, and was endeavoring to drag one of the powder  boxes across the lowered tail-board. Tom was straining and tugging at  it, but did not seem able to move the case. It was heavy, as Ned  learned later, and was also held down by the weight of other express  packages on top of it.    \"Oh, mah golly!\" cried Eradicate. \"Git some watah, somebody, an' put  out dat fire!\"    \"No--no water!\" yelled Tom, who heard him. \"Water will only make it  worse--it'll scatter the blazing gasoline. The feed pipe from the tank  must have burst. Throw on sand--sand is the only thing to use!\"    \"I'll git a shubble!\" cried Eradicate. \"I'll git a sand-shubble!\" and  he tottered off.    \"Wait, Tom, I'll give you a hand!\" cried Ned, as he saw his chum step  away from the end of the auto for a moment, as a burst of flame, and  choking smoke, driven by the wind, was blown almost in his face. \"I'll  help you!\"    \"We've got to be lively, then, Ned!\" gasped Tom. \"This is getting  hotter every minute! Where's that Koku? He could yank these boxes out  in a jiffy!\"    And indeed a giant's strength was needed at that moment.    Ned glanced around to see if he could catch a glimpse of the big man  whom Tom had brought from Giant Land, but Koku was not in sight.    \"Let's have another try now, Ned!\" suggested Tom, when a shift in the  wind left the rear of the auto comparatively free from smoke and flame.    \"You fellows had better skip!\" cried the expressman, who had been  throwing light packages off his vehicle from in front, where, as yet,  there was no fire. \"That powder'll go up in another minute. Some of the  boxes are beginning to catch now!\" he yelled. \"Look out!\"    \"That's right!\" shouted Tom, as he saw that the edge of one of the  wooden cases containing the powder was blazing slightly.  \"Lively, Ned!\"    Ned held back only for a second. Then, realizing that the time to act  was now or never, and that even if he ran he could hardly save himself,  he advanced to Tom's side. The smoke was choking and stifling them, and  the flames, coming from beneath the auto truck, made them gasp for  breath.    Together Tom and Ned tugged at the nearest case of powder--the one that  was ablaze.    \"We--we can't budge it!\" panted Tom.    \"It--it's caught somewhere,\" added Ned. \"Oh, if Koku were only here!\"    There was a sound behind the lads. A voice exclaimed:    \"Master want shovel, so Eradicate say--here it is!\"    They turned and saw a big, powerful man, with a simple, child-like  face, standing calmly looking at the burning auto.    \"Koku!\" cried Tom. \"Quick! Never mind the shovel! Get those powder  boxes out of that cart before they go up! Yank 'em out!  They're too  much for Ned and me! Quick!\"    \"Oh, of a courseness I will so do!\" said Koku, to whom, even yet, the  English language was somewhat of a mystery. He dropped the shovel, and,  heedless of the thick smoke from the burning gasoline, reached over and  took hold of the nearest box. It seemed as though he pulled it from the  auto truck as easily as Tom might have lifted a cork.    Then, carrying the box, which was now burning quite fiercely on one  corner, over toward Tom and Ned, who had moved back, the giant asked:    \"What you want of him, Master?\"    \"Put it down, Koku, and get out all the others! Lively, now, Koku!\"    \"I do,\" was the simple answer. The giant put the box on the grass and  ran back toward the auto.    \"Quick, Ned!\" shouted Tom. \"Throw some sand on this burning box! That  will put out the fire!\"    A few handfuls of earth served to extinguish the little blaze, and by  this time Koku had come back with another box of powder.    \"Get 'em all, Koku, get 'em all! Then we can put out the fire on the  auto.\"    For the giant it was but child's play to carry the heavy boxes of  powder, and soon he had them all removed from the truck. Then, with the  danger thus narrowly averted, they all, including the expressman,  turned in and began throwing sand on the fire, which now had a good  hold on the body of the auto. The shovel, which Eradicate had sent by  Koku, who could use more speed than could the aged colored man, came in  handy.    Soon the fire was out, though not before the truck had been badly  damaged, and some of its load destroyed. But, beyond a charring of some  of the powder boxes, the explosive was intact.    \"Whew! That was a lucky escape,\" murmured Tom, as he sat down on one of  the boxes, and wiped the smoke and sweat from his face.  \"A little  later and there'd only been a hole in the ground to tell what happened.  Hot work; eh, Ned?\"    \"I guess yes, Tom.\"    \"I thought of the powder as soon as I saw that the truck was on fire,\"  explained the expressman; \"but I didn't know what to do. I was kinder  flustered, I guess. This is the second time this old truck has caught  fire from a leaky gasoline pipe. I guess that will be the last--it will  for me, anyhow. I'll resign if they don't give me another machine. Will  you sign for your stuff?\" he asked Tom, holding out the receipt book,  which had escaped the flames.    \"Yes, and I'm mighty glad I'm here to sign for it,\" replied the young  inventor. \"Now, Koku, I guess you can take that stuff up to the shop;  but be careful where you put it.\"    \"I do, Master,\" replied the giant.    \"What sort of powder is that, Tom?\" asked Ned a little later, when they  were again back in the office, the excitement having calmed down. The  expressman had gone back to town afoot, to arrange about getting  another vehicle for what remained of his load. \"Is it the kind they use  in big guns?\"    \"One of the kinds,\" replied Tom. \"I sent for several samples, and this  is one. I'm going to conduct some tests to see what kind I'll need for  my own big gun. But I expect I'll have to invent an explosive as well  as a cannon, for I want the most powerful I can get. Want to look at  some of this powder?\"    \"Yes, if you think it's safe.\"    \"Oh, it's safe enough if you treat it right. I'll show you,\" and  working carefully Tom soon had one of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13610"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 1 (#4)"],[1,"women. They have, in appearance at      least, accepted the rule of shame imposed on them by men, but      only custom inspires the modesty for which they are praised; it      is really an outrage to their sex. This reversal of psychological      laws has, however, only been accepted by women with a struggle.      Primitive woman, proud of her womanhood, for a long time      defended her nakedness which ancient art has always represented.      And in the actual life of the young girl to-day there is a moment      when, by a secret atavism, she feels the pride of her sex, the      intuition of her moral superiority, and cannot understand why she      must hide its cause. At this moment, wavering between the laws of      Nature and social conventions, she scarcely knows if nakedness      should or should not affright her. A sort of confused atavistic      memory recalls to her a period before clothing was known, and      reveals to her as a paradisaical ideal the customs of that human      epoch.\"        In support of this view the authoress proceeds to point out that      the _decollete_ constantly reappears in feminine clothing, never      in male; that missionaries experience great difficulty in      persuading women to cover themselves; that, while women accept      with facility an examination by male doctors, men cannot force      themselves to accept examination by a woman doctor, etc. (These      and similar points had already been independently brought forward      by Sergi, _Archivio di Psichiatria_, vol. xiii, 1892.)        It cannot be said that Madame Renooz's arguments will all bear      examination, if only on the ground that nakedness by no means      involves absence of modesty, but the point of view which she      expresses is one which usually fails to gain recognition, though      it probably contains an important element of truth. It is quite      true, as Stendhal said, that modesty is very largely taught; from      the earliest years, a girl child is trained to show a modesty      which she quickly begins really to feel. This fact cannot fail to      strike any one who reads the histories of pseudo-hermaphroditic      persons, really males, who have from infancy been brought up in      the belief that they are girls, and who show, and feel, all the      shrinking reticence and blushing modesty of their supposed sex.      But when the error is discovered, and they are restored to their      proper sex, this is quickly changed, and they exhibit all the      boldness of masculinity. (See e.g., Neugebauer, \"Beobachtungen      aus dem Gebiete des Scheinzwittertumes,\" _Jahrbuch fuer Sexuelle      Zwischenstufen_, Jahrgang iv, 1902, esp. p. 92.) At the same time      this is only one thread in the tangled skein with which we are      here concerned. The mass of facts which meets us when we turn to      the study of modesty in women cannot be dismissed as a group of      artificially-imposed customs. They gain rather than lose in      importance if we have to realize that the organic sexual demands      of women, calling for coyness in courtship, lead to the temporary      suppression of another feminine instinct of opposite, though      doubtless allied, nature.        But these somewhat conflicting, though not really contradictory,      statements serve to bring out the fact that a woman's modesty is      often an incalculable element. The woman who, under some      circumstances and at some times, is extreme in her reticences,      under other circumstances or at other times, may be extreme in      her abandonment. Not that her modesty is an artificial garment,      which she throws off or on at will. It is organic, but like the      snail's shell, it sometimes forms an impenetrable covering, and      sometimes glides off almost altogether. A man's modesty is more      rigid, with little tendency to deviate toward either extreme.      Thus it is, that, when uninstructed, a man is apt to be impatient      with a woman's reticences, and yet shocked at her abandonments.    The significance of our inquiry becomes greater when we reflect that to  the reticences of sexual modesty, in their progression, expansion, and  complication, we largely owe, not only the refinement and development of  the sexual emotions,--\"_la pudeur_\" as Guyau remarked, \"_a civilise  l'amour_\"--but the subtle and pervading part which the sexual instinct has  played in the evolution of all human culture.        \"It is certain that very much of what is best in religion, art,      and life,\" remark Stanley Hall and Allin, \"owes its charm to the      progressively-widening irradiation of sexual feeling. Perhaps the      reluctance of the female first long-circuited the exquisite      sensations connected with sexual organs and acts to the antics of      animal and human courtship, while restraint had the physiological      function of developing the colors, plumes, excessive activity,      and exuberant life of the pairing season. To keep certain parts      of the body covered, irradiated the sense of beauty to eyes,      hair, face, complexion, dress, form, etc., while many savage      dances, costumes and postures are irradiations of the sexual act.      Thus reticence, concealment, and restraint are among the prime      conditions of religion and human culture.\" (Stanley Hall and      Allin, \"The Psychology of Tickling,\" _American Journal of      Psychology_, 1897, p. 31.)        Groos attributes the deepening of the conjugal relation among      birds to the circumstance that the male seeks to overcome the      reticence of the female by the display of his charms and      abilities. \"And in the human world,\" he continues, \"it is the      same; without the modest reserve of the woman that must, in most      cases, be overcome by lovable qualities, the sexual relationship      would with difficulty find a singer who would extol in love the      highest movements of the human soul.\" (Groos, _Spiele der      Menschen_, p. 341.)    I have not, however, been, able to find that the subject of modesty has  been treated in any comprehensive way by psychologists. Though valuable  facts and suggestions bearing on the sexual emotions, on disgust, the  origins of tatooing, on ornament and clothing, have been, brought forward  by physiologists, psychologists, and ethnographists, few or no attempts  appear to have been made to reach a general synthetic statement of these  facts and suggestions. It is true that a great many unreliable, slight, or  fragmentary efforts have been made to ascertain the constitution or basis  of this emotion.[1] Many psychologists have regarded modesty simply as the  result of clothing. This view is overturned by the well-ascertained fact  that many races which go absolutely naked possess a highly-developed sense  of modesty. These writers have not realized that physiological modesty is  earlier in appearance, and more fundamental, than anatomical modesty. A  partial contribution to the analysis of modesty has been made by Professor  James, who, with his usual insight and lucidity, has set forth certain of  its characteristics, especially the element due to \"the application to  ourselves of judgments primarily passed upon our mates.\" Guyau, in a very  brief discussion of modesty, realized its great significance and touched  on most of its chief elements.[2] Westermarck, again, followed by Grosse,  has very ably and convincingly set forth certain factors in the origin of  ornament and clothing, a subject which many writers imagine to cover the  whole field of modesty. More recently Ribot, in his work on the emotions,  has vaguely outlined most of the factors of modesty, but has not developed  a coherent view of their origins and relationships.        Since the present _Study_ first appeared, Hohenemser, who      considers that my analysis of modesty is unsatisfactory, has made      a notable attempt to define the psychological mechanism of shame.      (\"Versuch einer Analyse der Scham,\" _Archiv fuer die Gesamte      Psychologie_, Bd. II, Heft 2-3, 1903.) He regards shame as a      general psycho-physical phenomenon, \"a definite tension of the      whole soul,\" with an emotion superadded. \"The state of shame      consists in a certain psychic lameness or inhibition,\" sometimes      accompanied by physical phenomena of paralysis, such as sinking      of the head and inability to meet the eye. It is a special case      of Lipps's psychic stasis or damming up (_psychische Stauung_),      always produced when the psychic activities are at the same time      drawn in two or more different directions. In shame there is      always something present in consciousness which conflicts with      the rest of the personality, and cannot be brought into harmony      with it, which cannot be brought, that is, into moral (not      logical) relationship with it. A young man in love with a girl is      ashamed when told that he is in love, because his reverence for      one whom he regards as a higher being cannot be brought into      relationship with his own lower personality. A child in the same      way feels shame in approaching a big, grown-up person, who seems      a higher sort of being. Sometimes, likewise, we feel shame in      approaching a stranger, for a new person tends to seem higher and      more interesting than ourselves. It is not so in approaching a      new natural phenomenon, because we do not compare it with      ourselves. Another kind of shame is seen when this mental contest      is lower than our personality, and on this account in conflict      with it, as when we are ashamed of sexual thoughts. Sexual ideas      tend to evoke shame, Hohenemser remarks, because they so easily      tend to pass into sexual feelings; when they do not so pass (as      in scientific discussions) they do not evoke shame.        It will be seen that this discussion of modesty is highly      generalized and abstracted; "]]]
