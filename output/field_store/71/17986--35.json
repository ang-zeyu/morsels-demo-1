The same is true of the lower  animals, so that it would be inferred, as is the case, that the faces  of those animals are also expressive of emotion. There is also noticed  among them an exhibition of emotion by corporeal action. This is the  class of gestures common to them with the earliest made by man, as  above mentioned, and it is reasonable to suppose that those were made  by man at the time when, if ever, he was, like the animals, destitute  of articulate speech. The articulate cries uttered by some animals,  especially some birds, are interesting as connected with the principle  of imitation to which languages in part owe their origin, but in the  cases of forced imitation, the mere acquisition of a vocal trick,  they only serve to illustrate that power of imitation, and are without  significance. Sterne's starling, after his cage had been opened, would  have continued to complain that he could not get out. If the bird had  uttered an instinctive cry of distress when in confinement and a note  of joy on release, there would have been a nearer approach to language  than if it had clearly pronounced many sentences. Such notes and  cries of animals, many of which are connected with reproduction and  nutrition, are well worth more consideration than can now be given,  but regarding them generally it is to be questioned if they are so  expressive as the gestures of the same animals. It is contended that  the bark of a dog is distinguishable into fear, defiance, invitation,  and a note of warning, but it also appears that those notes have been  known only since the animal has been domesticated. The gestures of  the dog are far more readily distinguished than his bark, as in his  preparing for attack, or caressing his master, resenting an injury,  begging for food, or simply soliciting attention. The chief modern  use of his tail appears to be to express his ideas and sensations. But  some recent experiments of Prof. A. GRAHAM BELL, no less eminent from  his work in artificial speech than in telephones, shows that animals  are more physically capable of pronouncing articulate sounds than has  been supposed. He informed the writer that he recently succeeded by  manipulation in causing an English terrier to form a number of the  sounds of our letters, and particularly brought out from it the words  \"How are you, Grandmamma?\" with distinctness. This tends to prove  that only absence of brain power has kept animals from acquiring true  speech. The remarkable vocal instrument of the parrot could be used in  significance as well as in imitation, if its brain had been developed  beyond the point of expression by gesture, in which latter the bird is  expert.    The gestures of monkeys, whose hands and arms can be used, are nearly  akin to ours. Insects communicate with each other almost entirely by  means of the antennae. Animals in general which, though not deaf, can  not be taught by sound, frequently have been by signs, and probably  all of them understand man's gestures better than his speech. They  exhibit signs to one another with obvious intention, and they also  have often invented them as a means of obtaining their wants from man.        _GESTURES OF YOUNG CHILDREN._    The wishes and emotions of very young children are conveyed in a  small number of sounds, but in a great variety of gestures and facial  expressions. A child's gestures are intelligent long in advance of  speech; although very early and persistent attempts are made to give  it instruction in the latter but none in the former, from the time  when it begins _risu cognoscere matrem_. It learns words only as they  are taught, and learns them through the medium of signs which are not  expressly taught. Long after familiarity with speech, it consults  the gestures and facial expressions of its parents and nurses as  if seeking thus to translate or explain their words. These facts  are important in reference to the biologic law that the order of  development of the individual is the same as that of the species.    Among the instances of gestures common to children throughout the  world is that of protruding the lips, or pouting, when somewhat angry  or sulky. The same gesture is now made by the anthropoid apes and is  found strongly marked in the savage tribes of man. It is noticed by  evolutionists that animals retain during early youth, and subsequently  lose, characters once possessed by their progenitors when adult, and  still retained by distinct species nearly related to them.    The fact is not, however, to be ignored that children invent words as  well as signs with as natural an origin for the one as for the other.  An interesting case was furnished to the writer by Prof. BELL of an  infant boy who used a combination of sounds given as \"nyum-nyum,\"  an evident onomatope of gustation, to mean \"good,\" and not only in  reference to articles of food relished but as applied to persons of  whom the child was fond, rather in the abstract idea of \"niceness\"  in general. It is a singular coincidence that a bright young girl,  a friend of the writer, in a letter describing a juvenile feast,  invented the same expression, with nearly the same spelling, as  characteristic of her sensations regarding the delicacies provided.  The Papuans met by Dr. Comrie also called \"eating\" _nam-nam_. But the  evidence of all such cases of the voluntary use of articulate speech  by young children is qualified by the fact that it has been inherited  from very many generations, if not quite so long as the faculty of  gesture.        _GESTURES IN MENTAL DISORDER._    The insane understand and obey gestures when they have no knowledge  whatever of words. It is also found that semi-idiotic children who  cannot be taught more than the merest rudiments of speech, can receive  a considerable amount of information through signs, and can express  themselves by them. Sufferers from aphasia continue to use appropriate  gestures after their words have become uncontrollable. It is further  noticeable in them that mere ejaculations, or sounds which are only  the result of a state of feeling, instead of a desire to express  thought, are generally articulated with accuracy. Patients who have  been in the habit of swearing preserve their fluency in that division  of their vocabulary.        _UNINSTRUCTED DEAF-MUTES._    The signs made by congenital and uninstructed deaf-mutes to be now  considered are either strictly natural signs, invented by themselves,  or those of a colloquial character used by such mutes where  associated. The accidental or merely suggestive signs peculiar to  families, one member of which happens to be a mute, are too much  affected by the other members of the family to be of certain  value. Those, again, which are taught in institutions have become  conventional and designedly adapted to translation into oral speech,  although founded by the abbe de l'Epee, followed by the abbe Sicard,  in the natural signs first above mentioned.    A great change has doubtless occurred in the estimation of congenital  deaf-mutes since the Justinian Code, which consigned them forever to  legal infancy, as incapable of intelligence, and classed them with the  insane. Yet most modern writers, for instance Archbishop Whately and  Max Mueller, have declared that deaf-mutes could not think until  after having been instructed. It cannot be denied that the deaf-mute  thinks after his instruction either in the ordinary gesture signs or  in the finger alphabet, or more lately in artificial speech. By this  instruction he has become master of a highly-developed language, such  as English or French, which he can read, write, and actually talk,  but that foreign language he has obtained through the medium of signs.  This is a conclusive proof that signs constitute a real language and  one which admits of thought, for no one can learn a foreign language  unless he had some language of his own, whether by descent or  acquisition, by which it could be translated, and such translation  into the new language could not even be commenced unless the mind had  been already in action and intelligently using the original language  for that purpose. In fact the use by deaf-mutes of signs originating  in themselves exhibits a creative action of mind and innate faculty  of expression beyond that of ordinary speakers who acquired language  without conscious effort. The thanks of students, both of philology  and psychology, are due to Prof. SAMUEL PORTER, of the National Deaf  Mute College, for his response to the question, \"Is thought possible  without language?\" published in the _Princeton Review_ for January,  1880.    With regard to the sounds uttered by deaf-mutes, the same explanation  of heredity may be made as above, regarding the words invented by  young children. Congenital deaf-mutes at first make the same sounds  as hearing children of the same age, and, often being susceptible  to vibrations of the air, are not suspected of being deaf. When that  affliction is ascertained to exist, all oral utterances from the  deaf-mute are habitually repressed by the parents.        _GESTURES OF THE BLIND._    The facial expressions and gestures of the congenitally blind are  worthy of attention. The most interesting and conclusive examples  come from the case of Laura Bridgman, who, being also deaf, could not  possibly have derived them by imitation. When a letter from a beloved  friend was communicated to her by gesture-language, she laughed  and clapped her hands. A roguish expression was given to her face,  concomitant with the emotion, by her holding the lower lip by the  teeth. She blushed, shrugged her shoulders, turned in her elbows, and  raised her eye-brows under the same circumstances as other people.  In amazement, she rounded and protruded the lips, opened them, and  breathed strongly. It is remarkable that she constantly accompanied  her \"yes\" with the common affirmative nod, and"]]]
