He had bad dreams. Gilbert and Vaucheray were kneeling on the flags of  their cells, wildly stretching out their hands to him and yelling with  fright:    \"Help!... Help!\" they cried.    But, notwithstanding all his efforts, he was unable to move. He himself  was fastened by invisible bonds. And, trembling, obsessed by a monstrous  vision, he watched the dismal preparations, the cutting of the condemned  men's hair and shirt-collars, the squalid tragedy.    \"By Jove!\" he said, when he woke after a series of nightmares.  \"There's a lot of bad omens! Fortunately, we don't err on the side of  superstition. Otherwise...!\" And he added, \"For that matter, we have a  talisman which, to judge by Gilbert and Vaucheray's behaviour, should be  enough, with Lupin's help, to frustrate bad luck and secure the triumph  of the good cause. Let's have a look at that crystal stopper!\"    He sprang out of bed to take the thing and examine it more closely. An  exclamation escaped him. The crystal stopper had disappeared...        CHAPTER II. EIGHT FROM NINE LEAVES ONE    Notwithstanding my friendly relations with Lupin and the many flattering  proofs of his confidence which he has given me, there is one thing which  I have never been quite able to fathom, and that is the organization of  his gang.    The existence of the gang is an undoubted fact. Certain adventures can  be explained only by countless acts of devotion, invincible efforts of  energy and powerful cases of complicity, representing so many forces  which all obey one mighty will. But how is this will exerted? Through  what intermediaries, through what subordinates? That is what I do not  know. Lupin keeps his secret; and the secrets which Lupin chooses to  keep are, so to speak, impenetrable.    The only supposition which I can allow myself to make is that this gang,  which, in my opinion, is very limited in numbers and therefore all the  more formidable, is completed and extended indefinitely by the addition  of independent units, provisional associates, picked up in every class  of society and in every country of the world, who are the executive  agents of an authority with which, in many cases, they are not even  acquainted. The companions, the initiates, the faithful adherents--men  who play the leading parts under the direct command of Lupin--move to  and fro between these secondary agents and the master.    Gilbert and Vaucheray evidently belonged to the main gang. And that is  why the law showed itself so implacable in their regard. For the first  time, it held accomplices of Lupin in its clutches--declared, undisputed  accomplices--and those accomplices had committed a murder. If the murder  was premeditated, if the accusation of deliberate homicide could be  supported by substantial proofs, it meant the scaffold. Now there was,  at the very least, one self-evident proof, the cry for assistance which  Leonard had sent over the telephone a few minutes before his death:    \"Help!... Murder!... I shall be killed!...\"    The desperate appeal had been heard by two men, the operator on duty  and one of his fellow-clerks, who swore to it positively. And it was  in consequence of this appeal that the commissary of police, who was at  once informed, had proceeded to the Villa Marie-Therese, escorted by his  men and a number of soldiers off duty.    Lupin had a very clear notion of the danger from the first. The fierce  struggle in which he had engaged against society was entering upon a new  and terrible phase. His luck was turning. It was no longer a matter of  attacking others, but of defending himself and saving the heads of his  two companions.    A little memorandum, which I have copied from one of the note-books in  which he often jots down a summary of the situations that perplex him,  will show us the workings of his brain:    \"One definite fact, to begin with, is that Gilbert and Vaucheray  humbugged me. The Enghien expedition, undertaken ostensibly with the  object of robbing the Villa Marie-Therese, had a secret purpose. This  purpose obsessed their minds throughout the operations; and what they  were looking for, under the furniture and in the cupboards, was one  thing and one thing alone: the crystal stopper. Therefore, if I want to  see clear ahead, I must first of all know what this means. It is certain  that, for some hidden reason, that mysterious piece of glass possesses  an incalculable value in their eyes. And not only in theirs, for, last  night, some one was bold enough and clever enough to enter my flat and  steal the object in question from me.\"    This theft of which he was the victim puzzled Lupin curiously.    Two problems, both equally difficult of solution, presented themselves  to his mind. First, who was the mysterious visitor? Gilbert, who enjoyed  his entire confidence and acted as his private secretary, was the only  one who knew of the retreat in the Rue Matignon. Now Gilbert was in  prison. Was Lupin to suppose that Gilbert had betrayed him and put the  police on his tracks? In that case, why were they content with taking  the crystal stopper, instead of arresting him, Lupin?    But there was something much stranger still. Admitting that they had  been able to force the doors of his flat--and this he was compelled to  admit, though there was no mark to show it--how had they succeeded in  entering the bedroom? He turned the key and pushed the bolt as he did  every evening, in accordance with a habit from which he never departed.  And, nevertheless--the fact was undeniable--the crystal stopper had  disappeared without the lock or the bolt having been touched. And,  although Lupin flattered himself that he had sharp ears, even when  asleep, not a sound had waked him!    He took no great pains to probe the mystery. He knew those problems too  well to hope that this one could be solved other than in the course of  events. But, feeling very much put out and exceedingly uneasy, he then  and there locked up his entresol flat in the Rue Matignon and swore that  he would never set foot in it again.    And he applied himself forthwith to the question of corresponding with  Vaucheray or Gilbert.    Here a fresh disappointment awaited him. It was so clearly understood,  both at the Sante Prison and at the Law Courts, that all communication  between Lupin and the prisoners must be absolutely prevented, that a  multitude of minute precautions were ordered by the prefect of police  and minutely observed by the lowest subordinates. Tried policemen,  always the same men, watched Gilbert and Vaucheray, day and night, and  never let them out of their sight.    Lupin, at this time, had not yet promoted himself to the crowning honour  of his career, the post of chief of the detective-service, [*] and,  consequently, was not able to take steps at the Law Courts to insure the  execution of his plans. After a fortnight of fruitless endeavours, he  was obliged to bow.         * See 813, by Maurice Leblanc, translated by Alexander       Teixeira de Mattos.    He did so with a raging heart and a growing sense of anxiety.    \"The difficult part of a business,\" he often says, \"is not the finish,  but the start.\"    Where was he to start in the present circumstances? What road was he to  follow?    His thoughts recurred to Daubrecq the deputy, the original owner of the  crystal stopper, who probably knew its importance. On the other hand,  how was Gilbert aware of the doings and mode of life of Daubrecq the  deputy? What means had he employed to keep him under observation? Who  had told him of the place where Daubrecq spent the evening of that day?  These were all interesting questions to solve.    Daubrecq had moved to his winter quarters in Paris immediately after the  burglary at the Villa Marie-Therese and was now living in his own house,  on the left-hand side of the little Square Lamartine that opens out at  the end of the Avenue Victor-Hugo.    First disguising himself as an old gentleman of private means, strolling  about, cane in hand, Lupin spent his time in the neighbourhood, on the  benches of the square and the avenue. He made a discovery on the first  day. Two men, dressed as workmen, but behaving in a manner that left no  doubt as to their aims, were watching the deputy's house. When Daubrecq  went out, they set off in pursuit of him; and they were immediately  behind him when he came home again. At night, as soon as the lights were  out, they went away.    Lupin shadowed them in his turn. They were detective-officers.    \"Hullo, hullo!\" he said to himself. \"This is hardly what I expected. So  the Daubrecq bird is under suspicion?\"    But, on the fourth day, at nightfall, the two men were joined by six  others, who conversed with them in the darkest part of the Square  Lamartine. And, among these new arrivals, Lupin was vastly astonished  to recognize, by his figure and bearing, the famous Prasville, the  erstwhile barrister, sportsman and explorer, now favourite at the  Elysee, who, for some mysterious reason, had been pitchforked into the  headquarters of police as secretary-general, with the reversion of the  prefecture.    And, suddenly, Lupin remembered: two years ago, Prasville and Daubrecq  the deputy had had a personal encounter on the Place du Palais-Bourbon.  The incident made a great stir at the time. No one knew the cause of it.  Prasville had sent his seconds to Daubrecq on the same day; but Daubrecq  refused to fight.    A little while later, Prasville was appointed secretary-general.    \"Very odd, very odd,\" said Lupin, who remained plunged in thought, while  continuing to observe Prasville's movements.

They will be  moderately high, from five to ten thousand feet, and in desert regions.  The altitude will prevent extreme heat, and clouds or rain will be rare.  The range of temperature and unsteadiness of the air will be diminished  by placing them on hills a few hundred feet above the surrounding  country. The equipment and work of the two stations will be  substantially the same. Each will have telescopes and other instruments  of the largest size, which will be kept at work throughout the whole of  every clear night. The observers will do but little work in the daytime,  except perhaps on the sun, and will not undertake much of the  computation or reductions. This last work will be carried on at a third  station, which will be near a large city where the cost of living and of  intellectual labor is low. The photographs will be measured and stored  at this station, and all the results will be prepared for publication,  and printed there. The work of all three stations will be carefully  organized so as to obtain the greatest result for a given expenditure.  Every inducement will be offered to visiting astronomers who wish to do  serious work at either of the stations and also to students who intend  to make astronomy their profession. In the case of photographic  investigations it will be best to send the photographs so that  astronomers desiring them can work at home. The work of the young  astronomers throughout the world will be watched carefully and large  appropriations made to them if it appears that they can spend them to  advantage. Similar aid will be rendered to astronomers engaged in  teaching, and to any one, professional or amateur, capable of doing work  of the highest grade. As a fundamental condition for success, no  restrictions will be made that will interfere with the greatest  scientific efficiency, and no personal or local prejudices that will  restrict the work.    These plans may seem to you visionary, and too Utopian for the twentieth  century. But they may be nearer fulfilment than we anticipate. The true  astronomer of to-day is eminently a practical man. He does not accept  plans of a sensational character. The same qualities are needed in  directing a great observatory successfully, as in managing a railroad,  or factory. Any one can propose a gigantic expenditure, but to prove to  a shrewd man of affairs that it is feasible and advisable is a very  different matter. It is much more difficult to give away money wisely  than to earn it. Many men have made great fortunes, but few have learned  how to expend money wisely in advancing science, or to give it away  judiciously. Many persons have given large sums to astronomy, and some  day we shall find the man with broad views who will decide to have the  advice and aid of the astronomers of the world, in his plans for  promoting science, and who will thus expend his money, as he made it,  taking the greatest care that not one dollar is wasted. Again, let us  consider the next great advance, which perhaps will be a method of  determining the distances of the stars. Many of us are working on this  problem, the solution of which may come to some one any day. The present  field is a wide one, the prospects are now very bright, and we may look  forward to as great an advance in the twentieth century, as in the  nineteenth. May a portion of this come to the Case School and, with your  support, may its enviable record, in the past, be surpassed by its  future achievements."]]]
