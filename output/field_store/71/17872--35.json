The conversion of the latent dream thoughts into those manifest deserves  our close study as the first known example of the transformation of  psychical stuff from one mode of expression into another. From a mode of  expression which, moreover, is readily intelligible into another which  we can only penetrate by effort and with guidance, although this new  mode must be equally reckoned as an effort of our own psychical  activity. From the standpoint of the relationship of latent to manifest  dream-content, dreams can be divided into three classes. We can, in the  first place, distinguish those dreams which have a _meaning_ and are, at  the same time, _intelligible_, which allow us to penetrate into our  psychical life without further ado. Such dreams are numerous; they are  usually short, and, as a general rule, do not seem very noticeable,  because everything remarkable or exciting surprise is absent. Their  occurrence is, moreover, a strong argument against the doctrine which  derives the dream from the isolated activity of certain cortical  elements. All signs of a lowered or subdivided psychical activity are  wanting. Yet we never raise any objection to characterizing them as  dreams, nor do we confound them with the products of our waking life.    A second group is formed by those dreams which are indeed self-coherent  and have a distinct meaning, but appear strange because we are unable to  reconcile their meaning with our mental life. That is the case when we  dream, for instance, that some dear relative has died of plague when we  know of no ground for expecting, apprehending, or assuming anything of  the sort; we can only ask ourself wonderingly: \"What brought that into  my head?\" To the third group those dreams belong which are void of both  meaning and intelligibility; they are _incoherent, complicated, and  meaningless_. The overwhelming number of our dreams partake of this  character, and this has given rise to the contemptuous attitude towards  dreams and the medical theory of their limited psychical activity. It is  especially in the longer and more complicated dream-plots that signs of  incoherence are seldom missing.    The contrast between manifest and latent dream-content is clearly only  of value for the dreams of the second and more especially for those of  the third class. Here are problems which are only solved when the  manifest dream is replaced by its latent content; it was an example of  this kind, a complicated and unintelligible dream, that we subjected to  analysis. Against our expectation we, however, struck upon reasons which  prevented a complete cognizance of the latent dream thought. On the  repetition of this same experience we were forced to the supposition  that there is an _intimate bond, with laws of its own, between the  unintelligible and complicated nature of the dream and the difficulties  attending communication of the thoughts connected with the dream_.  Before investigating the nature of this bond, it will be advantageous to  turn our attention to the more readily intelligible dreams of the first  class where, the manifest and latent content being identical, the dream  work seems to be omitted.    The investigation of these dreams is also advisable from another  standpoint. The dreams of _children_ are of this nature; they have a  meaning, and are not bizarre. This, by the way, is a further objection  to reducing dreams to a dissociation of cerebral activity in sleep, for  why should such a lowering of psychical functions belong to the nature  of sleep in adults, but not in children? We are, however, fully  justified in expecting that the explanation of psychical processes in  children, essentially simplified as they may be, should serve as an  indispensable preparation towards the psychology of the adult.    I shall therefore cite some examples of dreams which I have gathered  from children. A girl of nineteen months was made to go without food  for a day because she had been sick in the morning, and, according to  nurse, had made herself ill through eating strawberries. During the  night, after her day of fasting, she was heard calling out her name  during sleep, and adding: \"_Tawberry, eggs, pap_.\" She is dreaming that  she is eating, and selects out of her menu exactly what she supposes she  will not get much of just now.    The same kind of dream about a forbidden dish was that of a little boy  of twenty-two months. The day before he was told to offer his uncle a  present of a small basket of cherries, of which the child was, of  course, only allowed one to taste. He woke up with the joyful news:  \"Hermann eaten up all the cherries.\"    A girl of three and a half years had made during the day a sea trip  which was too short for her, and she cried when she had to get out of  the boat. The next morning her story was that during the night she had  been on the sea, thus continuing the interrupted trip.    A boy of five and a half years was not at all pleased with his party  during a walk in the Dachstein region. Whenever a new peak came into  sight he asked if that were the Dachstein, and, finally, refused to  accompany the party to the waterfall. His behavior was ascribed to  fatigue; but a better explanation was forthcoming when the next morning  he told his dream: _he had ascended the Dachstein_. Obviously he  expected the ascent of the Dachstein to be the object of the excursion,  and was vexed by not getting a glimpse of the mountain. The dream gave  him what the day had withheld. The dream of a girl of six was similar;  her father had cut short the walk before reaching the promised objective  on account of the lateness of the hour. On the way back she noticed a  signpost giving the name of another place for excursions; her father  promised to take her there also some other day. She greeted her father  next day with the news that she had dreamt that _her father had been  with her to both places_.    What is common in all these dreams is obvious. They completely satisfy  wishes excited during the day which remain unrealized. They are simply  and undisguisedly realizations of wishes.    The following child-dream, not quite understandable at first sight, is  nothing else than a wish realized. On account of poliomyelitis a girl,  not quite four years of age, was brought from the country into town, and  remained over night with a childless aunt in a big--for her, naturally,  huge--bed. The next morning she stated that she had dreamt that _the  bed was much too small for her, so that she could find no place in it_.  To explain this dream as a wish is easy when we remember that to be  \"big\" is a frequently expressed wish of all children. The bigness of the  bed reminded Miss Little-Would-be-Big only too forcibly of her  smallness. This nasty situation became righted in her dream, and she  grew so big that the bed now became too small for her.    Even when children's dreams are complicated and polished, their  comprehension as a realization of desire is fairly evident. A boy of  eight dreamt that he was being driven with Achilles in a war-chariot,  guided by Diomedes. The day before he was assiduously reading about  great heroes. It is easy to show that he took these heroes as his  models, and regretted that he was not living in those days.    From this short collection a further characteristic of the dreams of  children is manifest--_their connection with the life of the day_. The  desires which are realized in these dreams are left over from the day  or, as a rule, the day previous, and the feeling has become intently  emphasized and fixed during the day thoughts. Accidental and indifferent  matters, or what must appear so to the child, find no acceptance in the  contents of the dream.    Innumerable instances of such dreams of the infantile type can be found  among adults also, but, as mentioned, these are mostly exactly like the  manifest content. Thus, a random selection of persons will generally  respond to thirst at night-time with a dream about drinking, thus  striving to get rid of the sensation and to let sleep continue. Many  persons frequently have these comforting _dreams_ before waking, just  when they are called. They then dream that they are already up, that  they are washing, or already in school, at the office, etc., where they  ought to be at a given time. The night before an intended journey one  not infrequently dreams that one has already arrived at the destination;  before going to a play or to a party the dream not infrequently  anticipates, in impatience, as it were, the expected pleasure. At other  times the dream expresses the realization of the desire somewhat  indirectly; some connection, some sequel must be known--the first step  towards recognizing the desire. Thus, when a husband related to me the  dream of his young wife, that her monthly period had begun, I had to  bethink myself that the young wife would have expected a pregnancy if  the period had been absent. The dream is then a sign of pregnancy. Its  meaning is that it shows the wish realized that pregnancy should not  occur just yet. Under unusual and extreme circumstances, these dreams  of the infantile type become very frequent. The leader of a polar  expedition tells us, for instance, that during the wintering amid the  ice the crew, with their monotonous diet and slight rations, dreamt  regularly, like children, of fine meals, of mountains of tobacco, and of  home.    It is not uncommon that out of some long, complicated and intricate  dream one specially lucid part stands out containing unmistakably the  realization of a desire, but bound up with much unintelligible matter.  On more frequently analyzing the seemingly more transparent dreams of  adults, it is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1549"],[0,"Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians (#4)"],[1,"cunning we are to meet the devil's craft and put from us  the memory of sin.    St. Paul also presents a true picture of Christ as the virgin-born  Son of God, delivered into death for our sins. To entertain a true  conception of Christ is important, for the devil describes Christ as an  exacting and cruel judge who condemns and punishes men. Tell him that  his definition of Christ is wrong, that Christ has given Himself for  our sins, that by His sacrifice He has taken away the sins of the whole  world.    Make ample use of this pronoun \"our\" Be assured that Christ has  canceled the sins, not of certain persons only, but your sins. Do not  permit yourself to be robbed of this lovely conception of Christ. Christ  is no Moses, no law-giver, no tyrant, but the Mediator for sins, the  Giver of grace and life.    We know this. Yet in the actual conflict with the devil, when he scares  us with the Law, when he frightens us with the very person of the  Mediator, when he misquotes the words of Christ, and distorts for us our  Savior, we so easily lose sight of our sweet High-Priest.    For this reason I am so anxious for you to gain a true picture of Christ  out of the words of Paul \"who gave himself for our sins.\" Obviously,  Christ is no judge to condemn us, for He gave Himself for our sins.  He does not trample the fallen but raises them. He comforts the  broken-hearted. Otherwise Paul should lie when he writes \"who gave  himself for our sins.\"    I do not bother my head with speculations about the nature of God. I  simply attach myself to the human Christ, and I find joy and peace, and  the wisdom of God in Him. These are not new truths. I am repeating what  the apostles and all teachers of God have taught long ago. Would to God  we could impregnate our hearts with these truths.        VERSE 4. That he might deliver us from this present evil world.    Paul calls this present world evil because everything in it is subject  to the malice of the devil, who reigns over the whole world as  his domain and fills the air with ignorance, contempt, hatred, and  disobedience of God. In this devil's kingdom we live.    As long as a person is in the world he cannot by his own efforts rid  himself of sin, because the world is bent upon evil. The people of  the world are the slaves of the devil. If we are not in the Kingdom  of Christ, it is certain we belong to the kingdom of Satan and we are  pressed into his service with every talent we possess.    Take the talents of wisdom and integrity. Without Christ, wisdom is  double foolishness and integrity double sin, because they not only  fail to perceive the wisdom and righteousness of Christ, but hinder  and blaspheme the salvation of Christ. Paul justly calls it the evil  or wicked world, for when the world is at its best the world is at its  worst. The grossest vices are small faults in comparison with the wisdom  and righteousness of the world. These prevent men from accepting the  Gospel of the righteousness of Christ. The white devil of spiritual sin  is far more dangerous than the black devil of carnal sin because the  wiser, the better men are without Christ, the more they are likely to  ignore and oppose the Gospel.    With the words, \"that he might deliver us,\" Paul argues that we stand in  need of Christ. No other being can possibly deliver us from this present  evil world. Do not let the fact disturb you that a great many people  enjoy excellent reputations without Christ. Remember what Paul says,  that the world with all its wisdom, might, and righteousness is the  devil's own. God alone is able to deliver us from the world.    Let us praise and thank God for His mercy in delivering us from the  captivity of Satan, when we were unable to do so by our own strength.  Let us confess with Paul that all our work-righteousness is loss and  dung. Let us condemn as filthy rags all talk about free will, all  religious orders, masses, ceremonies, vows, fastings, and the like.    In branding the world the devil's kingdom of iniquity, ignorance, error,  sin, death, and everlasting despair, Paul at the same time declares the  Kingdom of Christ to be a kingdom of equity, light, grace, remission  of sin, peace, saving health, and everlasting life into which we are  translated by our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever.    In this passage Paul contends against the false apostles for the article  of Justification. Christ, says Paul, has delivered us from this wicked  kingdom of the devil and the world according to the good will, the  pleasure and commandment of the Father. Hence we are not delivered by  our own will, or shrewdness, or wisdom, but by the mercy and love of  God, as it is written, I John 4:10, \"Herein is love, not that we loved  God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for  our sins.\"    Another reason why Paul, like John, emphasizes the Father's will is  Christ's habit of directing attention to the Father. For Christ came  into the world to reconcile God with us and to draw us to the Father.    Not by curious inquiries into the nature of God shall we know God  and His purpose for our salvation, but by taking hold of Christ, who  according to the will of the Father has given Himself into death for our  sins. When we understand this to be the will of the Father in Christ,  then shall we know God to be merciful, and not angry. We shall realize  that He loved us wretched sinners so much indeed that He gave us His  only-begotten Son into death for us.    The pronoun \"our\" refers to both God and Father. He is our God and  our Father. Christ's Father and our Father are one and the same. Hence  Christ said to Mary Magdalene: \"Go to my brethren, and say unto them,  I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.\"  God is our Father and our God, but only in Christ Jesus.        VERSE 5. To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.    Hebrew writing is interspersed with expressions of praise and gratitude.  This peculiarity can be traced in the apostolic writings, particularly  in those of Paul. The name of the Lord is to be mentioned with great  reverence and thanksgiving.        VERSE 6. I marvel.    How patiently Paul deals with his seduced Galatians! He does not pounce  on them but, like a father, he fairly excuses their error. With motherly  affection he talks to them yet he does it in a way that at the same time  he also reproves them. On the other hand, he is highly indignant at the  seducers whom he blames for the apostasy of the Galatians. His anger  bursts forth in elemental fury at the beginning of his epistle. \"If  any may,\" he cries, \"preach any other gospel unto you than that ye  have received, let him be accursed.\" Later on, in the fifth chapter,  he threatens the false apostles with damnation. \"He that troubleth you  shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.\" He pronounces a curse upon  them. \"I would they were even cut off which trouble you.\"    He might have addressed the Galatians after this fashion: \"I am ashamed  of you. Your ingratitude grieves me. I am angry with you.\" But his  purpose was to call them back to the Gospel. With this purpose in his  mind he speaks very gently to them. He could not have chosen a milder  expression than this, \"I marvel.\" It indicates his sorrow and his  displeasure.    Paul minds the rule which he himself lays down in a later chapter where  he says: \"Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are  spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering  thyself, lest thou also be tempted.\" Toward those who have been misled  we are to show ourselves parentally affectionate, so that they may  perceive that we seek not their destruction but their salvation. Over  against the devil and his missionaries, the authors of false doctrines  and sects, we ought to be like the Apostle, impatient, and rigorously  condemnatory, as parents are with the dog that bites their little one,  but the weeping child itself they soothe.    The right spirit in Paul supplies him with an extraordinary facility  in handling the afflicted consciences of the fallen. The Pope and his  bishops, inspired by the desire to lord it over men's souls, crack out  thunders and curses upon miserable consciences. They have no care for  the saving of men's souls. They are interested only in maintaining their  position.        VERSE 6. That ye are so soon.    Paul deplores the fact that it is difficult for the mind to retain a  sound and steadfast faith. A man labors for a decade before he succeeds  in training his little church into orderly religion, and then some  ignorant and vicious poltroon comes along to overthrow in a minute the  patient labor of years. By the grace of God we have effected here in  Wittenberg the form of a Christian church. The Word of God is taught  as it should be, the Sacraments are administered, and everything is  prosperous. This happy condition, secured by many years of arduous  labors, some lunatic might spoil in a moment. This happened in the  churches of Galatia which Paul had brought into life in spiritual  travail. Soon after his departure, however, these Galatian churches were  thrown into confusion by the false apostles.    The church is a tender plant. It must be watched. People hear a couple  of sermons, scan a few pages of Holy Writ, and think they know it all.  They are bold because they have never gone through any trials of faith.  Void of the Holy Spirit, they teach what they please as long as it  sounds good to the common people who are ever ready to join something  new.    We have to watch out for the devil lest he sow tares among the wheat  while we sleep. No sooner had Paul turned his back on the churches of  Galatia, than the false apostles went to work. Therefore, let us watch  over ourselves and over the whole church.        VERSE 6. I marvel that ye are so soon removed.    Again the Apostle puts in a gentle word. He does not berate the "]]]
