The ship is built of steel, and constructed according to the \"double  bottom\" system along the engine, boiler, and ammunition rooms. The  vaulted armor deck, extending 1.25 meters below the water line and  protecting the most vital parts of the ship, is 0.057 meter thick.  There are more than 100 water tight compartments below and above the  deck. A protecting belt of \"cellulose\" is provided for the engines and  boilers, extending from the armor deck downward.    The two main guns, placed on Krupp's hydraulic carriages, occupy  positions in front and rear, and are protected by stands 0.09 meter  thick and 1.60 meters high. They fire _en barbette_ with a lateral  range each of 260 degrees at bow and stern--i.e., 130 degrees on  either of the broadsides. The weight of the barrel of the gun is 25  tons, that of the steel shell 215 kilogrammes (about 430 lb.), that of  the brown powder charge 100 kilogrammes; initial velocity of  projectile, 610 meters; penetration, 0.524 meter iron; longest range,  17 kilometers (about 101/2 English miles); range at 15 deg. elevation,  10 kilometers. The six 15-centimeter guns are placed in a kind of  machicouli arrangement in two tiers on each of the broadsides, so that  always four guns can fire in the direction of the keel to the front  and rear. The weight of the barrel of the gun is each six tons, that  of the steel shells 51 kilogrammes, that of the charge 22 kilogrammes;  initial velocity, 610 meters.    The 11 quick-firing guns are partly placed along the broadsides,  partly in the masts, of which there are two. The triple expansion  engines, having each a bronze screw of 4.42 meters diameter, with  three blades and a rise of 6.3 meters, make with natural draught 105  revolutions, and with forced draught 120. The pumping apparatus are  able to lift in one hour 400 tons of water. The front boiler room  contains a special cylindrical boiler for the working of the  electrical apparatus, for hydraulic pumps of the artillery service,  for anchor windlasses, ventilators, fire engines, etc. The whole  engines weigh 890 tons. The bunkers have a capacity for 660 tons of  coal, which allows for a run of 4,500 sea miles.           *       *       *       *       *          CLARK'S GYROSCOPIC TORPEDOES.      Figs. 1 and 2 represent, upon a scale of about 1/10, two types of  torpedoes, the greatest number possible of the parts of which are made  revolvable, so as to render the torpedoes as dirigible as the gyrating  motion permits of.    Fig. 1 represents an electric torpedo actuated by accumulators, A A,  keyed upon the shaft, and revolving along with the gearings. At the  beginning of the running, the accumulators are not all coupled, but  under the action of a clockwork movement which is set in motion at the  moment of starting, metallic brushes descend one after another upon  the collectors, B, and set in action new batteries for keeping  constant or, if need be, accelerating the speed at the end of the  travel.    [Illustration: Fig. 1.]    [Illustration: Fig. 2. CLARK'S GYROSCOPIC TORPEDOES.]    Fig. 2 represents an air torpedo proposed by the same inventor. The  air reservoir, C, revolves along with the gearings under the action  of the pneumatic machine, D. The central shaft is hollow, so as to  serve as a conduit. The admission of air into the slide valve of the  machine is regulated by a clockwork which actuates a slide in an  aperture whose form and dimensions are so calculated that the speed  remains as constant as possible toward the end of the travel.    The trajectory of the two torpedoes is regulated by a cylindrical  bellows, F, which gives entrance to the sea water. The springs shown  in the figure balance the hydraulic pressure. The tension of these  springs is regulated by the rod, H, according to the indications of  the scale of depths, I.    When the torpedo reaches too great a depth, the action of the springs  can no longer balance the increase of the hydraulic pressure, and the  accumulation of the charge in the rear causes the front to rise toward  the surface. When the torpedo reaches the surface, a contrary action  is produced.--_Revue Industrielle._           *       *       *       *       *          THE FIRST STEAMBOAT ON THE SEINE.      [Illustration: FIRST STEAMBOAT BUILT ON THE SEINE.]    The accompanying engraving represents the remarkable steamboat that  the unfortunate Marquis de Jouffroy constructed at Paris in 1816,  after organizing a company for the carriage of passengers on the  Seine. De Jouffroy, as well known, made the first experiment in steam  navigation at Lyons in 1783, but the inventor's genius was not  recognized, and he met with nothing but deception and hostility. With  the obstinacy of men of conviction, he did not cease to prosecute his  task. He assuredly had an inkling of the future in store for the  invention that he was offering to humanity.    The paddle wheel boat that he constructed at Paris in 1816 did not  succeed any better than its predecessors; it was remarkable  nevertheless in appearance and structure.    The engine was forward, as shown in the engraving, which is copied  from a composition of Dubucourt's.    The company organized by the marquis was ruined, and, as well known,  the unfortunate inventor himself died in poverty in 1832, at the age  of eighty-one years.--_La Nature._           *       *       *       *       *          THE ELECTRIC MOTOR TESTS ON THE NEW YORK ELEVATED RAILROAD.      The American Institute of Electrical Engineers at its last meeting of  the season, held June 25, again considered the subject of electrical  traction, the paper presented by Mr. Leo Daft being based upon some  recent electrical work on the elevated railroads and its bearing on  the rapid transit problem. The _Railroad Gazette_ gives the following  abstract:        He introduced the subject with a tribute to the efficiency of      the elevated railroad system as it is now operated by steam,      with special reference to that section of it known as the Ninth      Avenue line, upon which his experiments with the electric motor      have been conducted, over which passengers are now conveyed a      distance of five miles in 26 minutes for five cents, which he      considered the best and cheapest municipal rapid transit in the      world, and which is operated with a higher degree of safety than      any other railroad in the world making an equal number of stops      per 100 miles. On a recent holiday, April 30 last, 835,720      passengers were carried upon the entire system without      noticeable detention or accident. The rapidly increasing traffic      makes the demand for better facilities a pressing one, and as      the average half million now carried daily will soon become a      million, it appears doubtful if any method can be devised of      providing for the growth by the use of steam motors on the      present structures, which are now taxed to their utmost. To the      mind of the mechanical engineer, having in view the ordinary      coefficients of tractive ability, there is no remedy for this.      The speaker stated that these coefficients were not entirely      trustworthy. He reiterated his previously expressed opinion,      based on frequent experiments, that there is a decided increase      in traction gained by the passage of the electric current from      the wheels to the rails, giving the details of one test where a      motor with a load making a total of 600 lb. climbed a gradient      of 2,900 ft. per mile, starting from a state of rest. He stated      that some of those people who had ridiculed his statements had      finally admitted that they were true.        The motor Ben Franklin, which had been used in making these      tests on the elevated roads, weighed 10 tons, and performed      service nearly equal to the steam motors weighing 18 tons. The      object of these tests was the determination of coal economy.      Tests with a Prony brake showed that the motor developed 128      H.P. The piece of track on which the experiments were conducted      embraced 2,200 ft. of level track and 1-8/10 miles of gradients,      varying from 11-3/10 to 98-7/10 ft. per mile, while at Thirtieth      street the station is at the foot of the steepest grade, thus      testing to the utmost the tractive capacity of the motor. The      experiments were begun in October, 1888, and carried on between      the hours of 9 P.M. and 4 A.M., beginning with one or two cars,      the load being increased nightly until it was finally made up of      eight coaches of 12 tons each, which were hauled up the 98 ft.      grade at a speed of 71/2 miles per hour, the entire distance being      covered at the rate of 14-6/10 miles per hour. The maximum speed      obtained on level with that train was 16.36 miles per hour.      Seventy trips were subsequently made with a 70 ton train      operated between the steam trains under 3 minutes headway, but      the work was considered too critical on account of the absence      of suitable brakes. A number of experiments made about this time      showed that the mean speed with a three-car train running      express on the up-town track was about 24 miles per hour,      although the ability of the motor on a level with a similar      train was nearly 28 miles per hour. This, however, was not the      maximum speed, as the level track was not long enough to permit      of its attaining the highest rate. It was the opinion of the      speaker, however, that the speed attained could not be exceeded      with prudence on the elevated structure.        The measurements of speed were made by dividing the track into      19 sections of 500 ft., each section being provided with a      circuit-closing plate connected with a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16983"],[0,"The Kitáb-i-Íqán (#4)"],[1,"manner, have such false imaginings  caused other communities to stray from the Kawthar of the infinite mercy  of Providence, and to be busied with their own idle thoughts.    Beside this passage, there is yet another verse in the Gospel wherein He  saith: \"Heaven and earth shall pass away: but My words shall not pass  away.\"(22) Thus it is that the adherents of Jesus maintained that the law  of the Gospel shall never be annulled, and that whensoever the promised  Beauty is made manifest and all the signs are revealed, He must needs  re-affirm and establish the law proclaimed in the Gospel, so that there  may remain in the world no faith but His faith. This is their fundamental  belief. And their conviction is such that were a person to be made  manifest with all the promised signs and to promulgate that which is  contrary to the letter of the law of the Gospel, they must assuredly  renounce him, refuse to submit to his law, declare him an infidel, and  laugh him to scorn. This is proved by that which came to pass when the sun  of the Muhammadan Revelation was revealed. Had they sought with a humble  mind from the Manifestations of God in every Dispensation the true meaning  of these words revealed in the sacred books--words the misapprehension of  which hath caused men to be deprived of the recognition of the  Sadratu'l-Muntaha, the ultimate Purpose--they surely would have been guided  to the light of the Sun of Truth, and would have discovered the mysteries  of divine knowledge and wisdom.    This servant will now share with thee a dewdrop out of the fathomless  ocean of the truths treasured in these holy words, that haply discerning  hearts may comprehend all the allusions and the implications of the  utterances of the Manifestations of Holiness, so that the overpowering  majesty of the Word of God may not prevent them from attaining unto the  ocean of His names and attributes, nor deprive them of recognizing the  Lamp of God which is the seat of the revelation of His glorified Essence.    As to the words--\"Immediately after the oppression of those days\"--they  refer to the time when men shall become oppressed and afflicted, the time  when the lingering traces of the Sun of Truth and the fruit of the Tree of  knowledge and wisdom will have vanished from the midst of men, when the  reins of mankind will have fallen into the grasp of the foolish and  ignorant, when the portals of divine unity and understanding--the essential  and highest purpose in creation--will have been closed, when certain  knowledge will have given way to idle fancy, and corruption will have  usurped the station of righteousness. Such a condition as this is  witnessed in this day when the reins of every community have fallen into  the grasp of foolish leaders, who lead after their own whims and desire.  On their tongue the mention of God hath become an empty name; in their  midst His holy Word a dead letter. Such is the sway of their desires, that  the lamp of conscience and reason hath been quenched in their hearts, and  this although the fingers of divine power have unlocked the portals of the  knowledge of God, and the light of divine knowledge and heavenly grace  hath illumined and inspired the essence of all created things, in such  wise that in each and every thing a door of knowledge hath been opened,  and within every atom traces of the sun hath been made manifest. And yet,  in spite of all these manifold revelations of divine knowledge, which have  encompassed the world, they still vainly imagine the door of knowledge to  be closed, and the showers of mercy to be stilled. Clinging unto idle  fancy, they have strayed far from the Urvatu'l-Vuthqa of divine knowledge.  Their hearts seem not to be inclined to knowledge and the door thereof,  neither think they of its manifestations, inasmuch as in idle fancy they  have found the door that leadeth unto earthly riches, whereas in the  manifestation of the Revealer of knowledge they find naught but the call  to self-sacrifice. They therefore naturally hold fast unto the former, and  flee from the latter. Though they recognize in their hearts the Law of God  to be one and the same, yet from every direction they issue a new command,  and in every season proclaim a fresh decree. No two are found to agree on  one and the same law, for they seek no God but their own desire, and tread  no path but the path of error. In leadership they have recognized the  ultimate object of their endeavour, and account pride and haughtiness as  the highest attainments of their heart's desire. They have placed their  sordid machinations above the divine decree, have renounced resignation  unto the will of God, busied themselves with selfish calculation, and  walked in the way of the hypocrite. With all their power and strength they  strive to secure themselves in their petty pursuits, fearful lest the  least discredit undermine their authority or blemish the display of their  magnificence. Were the eye to be anointed and illumined with the collyrium  of the knowledge of God, it would surely discover that a number of  voracious beasts have gathered and preyed upon the carrion of the souls of  men.    What \"oppression\" is greater than that which hath been recounted? What  \"oppression\" is more grievous than that a soul seeking the truth, and  wishing to attain unto the knowledge of God, should know not where to go  for it and from whom to seek it? For opinions have sorely differed, and  the ways unto the attainment of God have multiplied. This \"oppression\" is  the essential feature of every Revelation. Unless it cometh to pass, the  Sun of Truth will not be made manifest. For the break of the morn of  divine guidance must needs follow the darkness of the night of error. For  this reason, in all chronicles and traditions reference hath been made  unto these things, namely that iniquity shall cover the surface of the  earth and darkness shall envelop mankind. As the traditions referred to  are well known, and as the purpose of this servant is to be brief, He will  refrain from quoting the text of these traditions.    Were this \"oppression\" (which literally meaneth pressure) to be  interpreted that the earth is to become contracted, or were men's idle  fancy to conceive similar calamities to befall mankind, it is clear and  manifest that no such happenings can ever come to pass. They will  assuredly protest that this pre-requisite of divine revelation hath not  been made manifest. Such hath been and still is their contention. Whereas,  by \"oppression\" is meant the want of capacity to acquire spiritual  knowledge and apprehend the Word of God. By it is meant that when the  Day-star of Truth hath set, and the mirrors that reflect His light have  departed, mankind will become afflicted with \"oppression\" and hardship,  knowing not whither to turn for guidance. Thus We instruct thee in the  interpretation of the traditions, and reveal unto thee the mysteries of  divine wisdom, that haply thou mayest comprehend the meaning thereof, and  be of them that have quaffed the cup of divine knowledge and  understanding.    And now, concerning His words--\"The sun shall be darkened, and the moon  shall not give light, and the stars shall fall from heaven.\" By the terms  \"sun\" and \"moon,\" mentioned in the writings of the Prophets of God, is not  meant solely the sun and moon of the visible universe. Nay rather,  manifold are the meanings they have intended for these terms. In every  instance they have attached to them a particular significance. Thus, by  the \"sun\" in one sense is meant those Suns of Truth Who rise from the  dayspring of ancient glory, and fill the world with a liberal effusion of  grace from on high. These Suns of Truth are the universal Manifestations  of God in the worlds of His attributes and names. Even as the visible sun  that assisteth, as decreed by God, the true One, the Adored, in the  development of all earthly things, such as the trees, the fruits, and  colours thereof, the minerals of the earth, and all that may be witnessed  in the world of creation, so do the divine Luminaries, by their loving  care and educative influence, cause the trees of divine unity, the fruits  of His oneness, the leaves of detachment, the blossoms of knowledge and  certitude, and the myrtles of wisdom and utterance, to exist and be made  manifest. Thus it is that through the rise of these Luminaries of God the  world is made new, the waters of everlasting life stream forth, the  billows of loving-kindness surge, the clouds of grace are gathered, and  the breeze of bounty bloweth upon all created things. It is the warmth  that these Luminaries of God generate, and the undying fires they kindle,  which cause the light of the love of God to burn fiercely in the heart of  humanity. It is through the abundant grace of these Symbols of Detachment  that the Spirit of life everlasting is breathed into the bodies of the  dead. Assuredly the visible sun is but a sign of the splendour of that  Day-star of Truth, that Sun Which can never have a peer, a likeness, or  rival. Through Him all things live, move, and have their being. Through  His grace they are made manifest, and unto Him they all return. From Him  all things have sprung, and unto the treasuries of His revelation they all  have repaired. From Him all created things did proceed, and to the  depositories of His law they did revert.    That these divine Luminaries seem to be confined at times to specific  designations and attributes, as you have observed and are now observing,  is due solely to the imperfect and limited comprehension of certain minds.  Otherwise, they have been at all times, and will through eternity continue  to be, exalted above every praising name, and sanctified from every  descriptive attribute. The quintessence of every name can hope for no  access unto their court of holiness, and the highest and purest of all  attributes can never approach their"]]]
