The little boy looked at her with surprise.    \"Oh!\" said he; \"what do they call ye?\"    \"My own self,\" she said in a shrill but sweet little voice, and she  looked at him too. \"And what do they call ye?\"    \"Just my own self too!\" he answered cautiously; and with that they began  to play together.    She certainly showed him some fine games. She made animals out of the  ashes that looked and moved like life; and trees with green leaves  waving over tiny houses, with men and women an inch high in them, who,  when she breathed on them, fell to walking and talking quite properly.    But the fire was getting low, and the light dim, and presently the  little boy stirred the coals with a stick to make them blaze; when out  jumped a red-hot cinder, and where should it fall, but on the fairy  child's tiny foot.    Thereupon she set up such a squeal, that the boy dropped the stick, and  clapped his hands to his ears but it grew to so shrill a screech, that  it was like all the wind in the world whistling through one tiny  keyhole.    There was a sound in the chimney again, but this time the little boy did  not wait to see what it was, but bolted off to bed, where he hid under  the blankets and listened in fear and trembling to what went on.    A voice came from the chimney speaking sharply:    \"Who's there, and what's wrong?\" it said.    \"It's my own self,\" sobbed the fairy-child; \"and my foot's burnt sore.  O-o-h!\"    \"Who did it?\" said the voice angrily; this time it sounded nearer, and  the boy, peeping from under the clothes, could see a white face looking  out from the chimney-opening.    \"Just my own self too!\" said the fairy-child again.    \"Then if ye did it your own self,\" cried the elf-mother shrilly, \"what's  the use o' making all this fash about it?\"--and with that she  stretched out a long thin arm, and caught the creature by its ear, and,  shaking it roughly, pulled it after her, out of sight up the chimney.    The little boy lay awake a long time, listening, in case the  fairy-mother should come back after all; and next evening after supper,  his mother was surprised to find that he was willing to go to bed  whenever she liked.    \"He's taking a turn for the better at last!\" she said to herself; but he  was thinking just then that, when next a fairy came to play with him, he  might not get off quite so easily as he had done this time.          Black Bull of Norroway      In Norroway, long time ago, there lived a certain lady, and she had  three daughters: The oldest of them said to her mother: \"Mother, bake me  a bannock, and roast me a collop, for I'm going away to seek my  fortune.\" Her mother did so; and the daughter went away to an old witch  washerwife and told her purpose. The old wife bade her stay that day,  and look out of her back-door, and see what she could see. She saw  nought the first day. The second day she did the same, and saw nought.  On the third day she looked again, and saw a coach-and-six coming along  the road. She ran in and told the old wife what she saw. \"Well,\" quoth  the old woman, \"yon's for you.\" So they took her into the coach and  galloped off.    The second daughter next says to her mother: \"Mother, bake me a bannock,  and roast me a collop, for I'm going away to seek my fortune.\" Her  mother did so; and away she went to the old wife, as her sister had  done. On the third day she looked out of the back-door, and saw a  coach-and-four coming along the road. \"Well,\" quoth the old woman,  \"yon's for you.\" So they took her in, and off they set.    The third daughter says to her mother: \"Mother, bake me a bannock, and  roast me a collop, for I'm going away to seek my fortune.\" Her mother  did so; and away she went to the old witch. She bade her look out of her  back-door, and see what she could see She did so; and when she came  back, said she saw nought. The second day she did the same, and saw  nought. The third day she looked again, and on coming back said to the  old wife she saw nought but a great Black Bull coming crooning along the  road. \"Well,\" quoth the old witch, \"yon's for you.\" On hearing this she  was next to distracted with grief and terror; but she was lifted up and  set on his back, and away they went.    Aye they travelled, and on they travelled, till the lady grew faint with  hunger. \"Eat out of my right ear,\" says the Black Bull, \"and drink out  of my left ear, and set by your leaving.\" So she did as he said, and was  wonderfully refreshed. And long they rode, and hard they rode, till  they came in sight of a very big and bonny castle. \"Yonder we must be  this night,\" quoth the Bull; \"for my elder brother lives yonder;\" and  presently they were at the place. They lifted her off his back, and took  her in, and sent him away to a park for the night. In the morning, when  they brought the Bull home, they took the lady into a fine shining  parlour, and gave her a beautiful apple, telling her not to break it  till she was in the greatest strait ever mortal was in the world, and  that would bring her out of it. Again she was lifted on the Bull's back,  and after she had ridden far, and farther than I can tell, they came in  sight of a far bonnier castle, and far farther away than the last. Says  the Bull to her: \"Yonder we must be this night, for my second brother  lives yonder;\" and they were at the place directly. They lifted her down  and took her in, and sent the Bull to the field for the night. In the  morning they took the lady into a fine and rich room, and gave her the  finest pear she had ever seen, bidding her not to break it till she was  in the greatest strait ever mortal could be in, and that would get her  out of it. Again she was lifted and set on his back, and away they went.  And long they rode, and hard they rode, till they came in sight of the  far biggest castle and far farthest off, they had yet seen. \"We must be  yonder to-night,\" says the Bull, \"for my young brother lives yonder;\"  and they were there directly. They lifted her down, took her in, and  sent the Bull to the field for the night. In the morning they took her  into a room, the finest of all, and gave her a plum, telling her not to  break it till she was in the greatest strait mortal could be in, and  that would get her out of it. Presently they brought home the Bull, set  the lady on his back, and away they went.    And aye they rode, and on they rode, till they came to a dark and ugsome  glen, where they stopped, and the lady lighted down. Says the Bull to  her: \"Here you must stay till I go and fight the Old One. You must seat  yourself on that stone, and move neither hand nor foot till I come back,  else I'll never find you again. And if everything round about you turns  blue, I have beaten the Old One; but should all things turn red, he'll  have conquered me.\" She set herself down on the stone, and by-and-by all  round her turned blue. Overcome with joy, she lifted one of her feet,  and crossed it over the other, so glad was she that her companion was  victorious. The Bull returned and sought for her, but never could find  her.    Long she sat, and aye she wept, till she wearied. At last she rose and  went away, she didn't know where. On she wandered, till she came to a  great hill of glass, that she tried all she could to climb, but wasn't  able. Round the bottom of the hill she went, sobbing and seeking a  passage over, till at last she came to a smith's house; and the smith  promised, if she would serve him seven years, he would make her iron  shoon, wherewith she could climb over the glassy hill. At seven years'  end she got her iron shoon, clomb the glassy hill, and chanced to come  to the old washerwife's habitation. There she was told of a gallant  young knight that had given in some clothes all over blood to wash, and  whoever washed them was to be his wife. The old wife had washed till she  was tired, and then she set her daughter at it, and both washed, and  they washed, and they washed, in hopes of getting the young knight; but  for all they could do they couldn't bring out a stain. At length they  set the stranger damsel to work; and whenever she began, the stains came  out pure and clean, and the old wife made the knight believe it was her  daughter had washed the clothes. So the knight and the eldest daughter  were to be married, and the stranger damsel was distracted at the  thought of it, for she was deeply in love with him. So she bethought her  of her apple and breaking it, found it filled with gold and precious  jewellery, the richest she had ever seen. \"All these,\" she said to the  eldest daughter, \"I will give you, on condition that you put off your  marriage for one day and allow me to go into his room alone at night.\"  The lady consented; but meanwhile the old wife had prepared a sleeping  drink, and given it to the knight who drank it, and never wakened till  next morning. The live-long night the damsel sobbed and sang:         \"Seven long years I served for thee,        The glassy hill I clomb for thee,        Thy bloody clothes I wrang for thee;        And wilt thou not waken and turn to me?\"    [Illustration: THE GLASSY HILL I CLOMB FOR THEE]    Next day she knew not what to do for grief. Then she broke the pear, and  found it filled with jewellery far richer than the contents of the  apple. With these jewels she bargained for permission to be a second  night in the young knight's chamber; but the old wife gave him another  sleeping drink, and again he slept till morning. All night she kept  sighing and singing as before:         \"Seven long years I served for thee,        The glassy hill I clomb for thee,        Thy bloody clothes I wrang for thee;        And wilt thou not waken and turn to me?\"    Still he slept, and she"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14264"],[0,"The Practice and Science of Drawing (#4)"],[1,"to be hoped that science will perfect a  method of colour photography finally to dispel this illusion.    What, then, will serve as a working definition? There must be something  about feeling, the expression of that individuality the secret of which  everyone carries in himself; the expression of that ego that perceives  and is moved by the phenomena of life around us. And, on the other hand,  something about the ordering of its expression.    But who knows of words that can convey a just idea of such subtle  matter? If one says \"Art is the rhythmic expression of Life, or  emotional consciousness, or feeling,\" all are inadequate. Perhaps the  \"rhythmic expression of life\" would be the more perfect definition. But  the word \"life\" is so much more associated with eating and drinking in  the popular mind, than with the spirit or force or whatever you care to  call it, that exists behind consciousness and is the animating factor  of our whole being, that it will hardly serve a useful purpose. So that,  perhaps, for a rough, practical definition that will at least point away  from the mechanical performances that so often pass for art, \"#the  Rhythmic expression of Feeling#\" will do: for by Rhythm is meant that  ordering of the materials of art (form and colour, in the case of  painting) so as to bring them into relationship with our innate sense of  harmony which gives them their expressive power. Without this  relationship we have no direct means of making the sensuous material of  art awaken an answering echo in others. The boy shouting at the top of  his voice, making a horrible noise, was not an artist because his  expression was inadequate--was not related to the underlying sense of  harmony that would have given it expressive power.    [Illustration: Plate III.    STUDY FOR \"APRIL\"    In red chalk on toned paper.]    Let us test this definition with some simple cases. Here is a savage,  shouting and flinging his arms and legs about in wild delight; he is not  an artist, although he may be moved by life and feeling. But let this  shouting be done on some ordered plan, to a rhythm expressive of joy and  delight, and his leg and arm movements governed by it also, and he has  become an artist, and singing and dancing (possibly the oldest of the  arts) will result.    Or take the case of one who has been deeply moved by something he has  seen, say a man killed by a wild beast, which he wishes to tell his  friends. If he just explains the facts as he saw them, making no effort  to order his words so as to make the most telling impression upon his  hearers and convey to them something of the feelings that are stirring  in him, if he merely does this, he is not an artist, although the  recital of such a terrible incident may be moving. But the moment he  arranges his words so as to convey in a telling manner not only the  plain facts, but the horrible feelings he experienced at the sight, he  has become an artist. And if he further orders his words to a rhythmic  beat, a beat in sympathy with his subject, he has become still more  artistic, and a primitive form of poetry will result.    Or in building a hut, so long as a man is interested solely in the  utilitarian side of the matter, as are so many builders to-day, and just  puts up walls as he needs protection from wild beasts, and a roof to  keep out the rain, he is not yet an artist. But the moment he begins to  consider his work with some feeling, and arranges the relative sizes of  his walls and roof so that they answer to some sense he has for  beautiful proportion, he has become an artist, and his hut has some  architectural pretensions. Now if his hut is of wood, and he paints it  to protect it from the elements, nothing necessarily artistic has been  done. But if he selects colours that give him pleasure in their  arrangement, and if the forms his colour masses assume are designed with  some personal feeling, he has invented a primitive form of decoration.    And likewise the savage who, wishing to illustrate his description of a  strange animal he has seen, takes a piece of burnt wood and draws on the  wall his idea of what it looked like, a sort of catalogue of its  appearance in its details, he is not necessarily an artist. It is only  when he draws under the influence of some feeling, of some pleasure he  felt in the appearance of the animal, that he becomes an artist.    Of course in each case it is assumed that the men have the power to be  moved by these things, and whether they are good or poor artists will  depend on the quality of their feeling and the fitness of its  expression.    [Illustration: Plate IV.    STUDY ON TISSUE-PAPER IN RED CHALK FOR FIGURE OF BOREAS]      The purest form of this \"rhythmic expression of feeling\" is music. And  as Walter Pater shows us in his essay on \"The School of Giorgione,\"  \"music is the type of art.\" The others are more artistic as they  approach its conditions. Poetry, the most musical form of literature, is  its most artistic form. And in the greatest pictures form, colour, and  idea are united to thrill us with harmonies analogous to music.    The painter expresses his feelings through the representation of the  visible world of Nature, and through the representation of those  combinations of form and colour inspired in his imagination, that were  all originally derived from visible nature. If he fails from lack of  skill to make his representation convincing to reasonable people, no  matter how sublime has been his artistic intention, he will probably  have landed in the ridiculous. And yet, #so great is the power of  direction exercised by the emotions on the artist that it is seldom his  work fails to convey something, when genuine feeling has been the  motive#. On the other hand, the painter with no artistic impulse who  makes a laboriously commonplace picture of some ordinary or pretentious  subject, has equally failed as an artist, however much the skilfulness  of his representations may gain him reputation with the unthinking.    The study, therefore, of the #representation of visible nature# and of  #the powers of expression possessed by form and colour# is the object of  the painter's training.    And a command over this power of representation and expression is  absolutely necessary if he is to be capable of doing anything worthy of  his art.    This is all in art that one can attempt to teach. The emotional side is  beyond the scope of teaching. You cannot teach people how to feel. All  you can do is to surround them with the conditions calculated to  stimulate any natural feeling they may possess. And this is done by  familiarising students with the best works of art and nature.           *       *       *       *       *    It is surprising how few art students have any idea of what it is that  constitutes art. They are impelled, it is to be assumed, by a natural  desire to express themselves by painting, and, if their intuitive  ability is strong enough, it perhaps matters little whether they know or  not. But to the larger number who are not so violently impelled, it is  highly essential that they have some better idea of art than that it  consists in setting down your canvas before nature and copying it.    Inadequate as this imperfect treatment of a profoundly interesting  subject is, it may serve to give some idea of the point of view from  which the following pages are written, and if it also serves to disturb  the \"copying theory\" in the minds of any students and encourages them to  make further inquiry, it will have served a useful purpose.          II    DRAWING      By drawing is here meant #the expression of form upon a plane surface#.    Art probably owes more to form for its range of expression than to  colour. Many of the noblest things it is capable of conveying are  expressed by form more directly than by anything else. And it is  interesting to notice how some of the world's greatest artists have been  very restricted in their use of colour, preferring to depend on form for  their chief appeal. It is reported that Apelles only used three colours,  black, red, and yellow, and Rembrandt used little else. Drawing,  although the first, is also the last, thing the painter usually studies.  There is more in it that can be taught and that repays constant  application and effort. Colour would seem to depend much more on a  natural sense and to be less amenable to teaching. A well-trained eye  for the appreciation of form is what every student should set himself to  acquire with all the might of which he is capable.    It is not enough in artistic drawing to portray accurately and in cold  blood the appearance of objects. To express form one must first be moved  by it. There is in the appearance of all objects, animate and inanimate,  what has been called an #emotional significance#, a hidden rhythm that  is not caught by the accurate, painstaking, but cold artist. The form  significance of which we speak is never found in a mechanical  reproduction like a photograph. You are never moved to say when looking  at one, \"What fine form.\"    It is difficult to say in what this quality consists. The emphasis and  selection that is unconsciously given in a drawing done directly under  the guidance of strong feeling, are too subtle to be tabulated; they  escape analysis. But it is this selection of the significant and  suppression of the non-essential that often gives to a few lines drawn  quickly, and having a somewhat remote relation to the complex appearance  of the real object, more vitality and truth than are to be found in a  highly-wrought and painstaking drawing, during the process of which the  essential and vital things have been lost sight of in the labour of the  work; and the non-essential, which is usually more obvious, is allowed  to creep in and obscure the original impression. Of course, had the  finished drawing been done with the mind centred upon the particular  form"]]]
