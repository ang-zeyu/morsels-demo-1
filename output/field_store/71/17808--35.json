[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14419"],[0,"Grammatical Sketch of the Heve Language (#4)"],[1," phrase is formed pánauhridagua hasside.    The gerund in _do_ is found in the phrase Vus hóquedo panavame, the  boys playing, work, in which vus is boys, hóquedo or hóqueco, the  gerund of hoquen, play, and panavame, the plural of pánavan, work. The  passive voice has likewise the gerund, as for example: Nap sícriuhdo  cotzóm, Whilst thou art shorn, sleepest; here nap cotzóm is, you  sleep, sícriuhdo is the gerund in do passive of the verb sicán, and  toasquilo, hair.    The gerund in _dum_, and supine joined to a verb of motion is  equivalent to the future as before stated in the second mode of the  infinitive; but should there be no verb of movement with the gerund  in dum, the particle betzéuai, for, is used, as this suffices for  payment, (hoc ad solvendum sufficit,) Veride hasem ovíde betzéguai;  veride meaning this, hasem, suffices; ovide betzévai, for payment;  ovíden signifying pay.    Thus much it has been found necessary to say of the verb in its active  and passive voice, of its modes and times, which will serve as a  paradigm for the conjugation of any verb observant of the form of its  preterite and future (the roots whence rise the other tenses) to be  discovered in the vocabulary.    FREQUENTATIVE VERB.    21. This verb signifies the frequent repetition of the same action,  and is formed by adding the adverb tátze, peace-meal, as, I write  often, tátze ne hiósgan.    COMPULSIVE VERB.    22. It is thus called because it signifies to cause or compel to do  any thing, and is formed by taking away the last syllable of any verb  and replacing it with tudem or tuden, which alone is conjugated, and  has the perfect tudari, and future tudetze, as varuhtúden, I cause to  sin; verúhtze being the future of varúuen.    APPLICATIVE VERB.    23. When the action is for, by, or through, (\"para ó por,\") this verb  is used, having its termination in dem or den, perfect, deri, and  future, detze; as pánauan, work; whence is formed pánauiden, which is  the applicative, so that to say, I work for you, the phrase is Nee eme  pánauiden; and the mother to express, My son has failed me, (died),  says, No nótzi múquideri; although in the place of this applicative  the preposition betzéguai, for, is used likewise, or de, by; as,  Christ died for us, Cristo tamo betzéguai, or tamóde múqui.    CONTINUATIVE VERB.    24. This verb serves to continue the action, and is made from the  future, omitting the tze and substituting sem or sen, as nenérsem, I  am continually talking, from nehren, I speak; the future, nenértze;  biquesen, I am thus singing, from biquen, I sing; future, bequetze,  for which there appearing to be no perfect, the imperfect, bíquesenru  may be used, and the same is the case with the words that end in hon,  as merihon, go running; nenerhon, be speaking; biquehon, be singing,  of which the future termination is sintze, as nenérsintze.    COMPLETIVE VERB.    25. This gives completeness to the signification of the word out of  which it is made so full that nothing remains further, and is formed  of the future taking away the final tze, and placing suam instead, as,  baán, I eat; bétze, I will eat; besuam, I eat until I have finished  it all; todam, I leave; todetz, I will leave; todesuam, I leave  forever,--at once. The penitent may say, Oquine haóna no cananacemca  todesuatze, Now, forevermore, I will leave my sins; the perfect being  formed in coari, and the future in uatze.    ESTIMATIVE VERB.    26. This denotes the judgment that one forms of anything, as,  dénitzem, I judge it good; déni meaning good; hana Diosi denitzem,  perhaps you esteem God? nee eme deosaritzem, I judge you happy;  deosari meaning happy; nee eme náventzem, I consider you poor--pity  you; náven meaning poor: and they form the perfect, tziui, and future  tziúhtze.    CONVERSIVE VERB.    27. When a thing changes so as to pass from one to another form  or quality, this verb is used. Earth, tevat; genitive, teuhte;  accusative, teuhta, whence comes the verb teúhtuun, I make me  earth,--as do the sticks become, and bodies that rot. So dóhmetum,  make man, explains the mystery of the incarnation, as, God the Son  made himself man for us, Dios noquát tamóde, or tamo, betzeguai  dóhmetui. So batuum, is made water, bat, water; nasórtaan, I throw  away; nasórtuun, is thrown away, to become corruption; of which the  perfect is tui, the future, tutze.    28. There are some _Compound Verbs_ which end in donon, signifying  to go to do something, which appear to be formed from the future,  omitting the last syllable tze, and substituting donon, as amúdonon, I  go to hunt; amún being, I hunt; the future amútze; cumándonon, I go to  gather wood, from cumánan, I gather wood, future cumantze; baudónon,  I go to bring water, formed of bat, water; vun, the future of vtze,  bring, and donon, which has the perfect doni, and future dontze.    29. The termination guan, is usually a sign of the _Active Verb_, as  in mótzguan, I begin: máguan, or máhuan, I plough, and is added by  the natives to some Spanish words they use, such are perdonároguan,  I pardon; ayunároguan, I fast; velároguan, I watch. Some form the  perfect in guari, and future in guatze; others the perfect in uhri,  and future in úhtze, úitze, or in guatze.    30. To form _Compound Neuter Verbs_, the verb dáan, I go, is  frequently used, as bahútunan, I melt (active); bahútudaan, I melt,  or am melting, the neuter, barínan, I soften; baricdaan, I go on to  soften; zicónan, I break; zicócdaan, I break (neuter); the perfect  being dai, the future, détze.    31. _Other Neuters_ are formed of active verbs ending in an by  changing it into en, as sebán, I freeze; seben, freeze; basán, I  ripen; basen, ripen; sepán, cool; sepen, cool; nacuan, hurt; nacuen,  hurt. To form the perfect, the en is changed into i; but the future,  although it always ends in tze, differs, as will appear by the  vocabulary.    32. In the same manner as of Active Verbs in an, _Neuter Verbs_ in  en are made, so from other actives in an, neuters are made in un, as,  busán, I awake another; busún, I awake me; tutzan, I quench; tucún, I  quench me, in the perfect changing the un to i, and the future to tze.    PLURAL OF VERBS.    33. This language has the notable peculiarity of the verbs oftentimes  differing greatly in the plural from the singular, as, vaquén, enter  one; múume, enter many; vóon, one to lay down; medáguame, lay down  many; méran, one to run; vóome, many to run; batémucun, to drown  oneself; betécoome, many to drown themselves; batemean, drown one;  batecódan, drown many.    34. There are many _Compound Active Verbs_ ending in puguan or puuan,  which signify to pluck, as beguát, skin, genitive; beúhte, accusative;  beúhta, whence beuhpuuan, tear off the skin is formed, and from mo,  hair of the human head comes mópuuan, pluck the hair, etc.; sequát,  flower, genitive, seúhte; accusative, seúhta gives seúhpuuan, to  pluck flowers; nágua; root, genitive, naúhte; accusative, naúhta, when  naúhpuuan, eradicate, is formed, their perfect being in uhri, their  future in natze.    ZEM, ZEN.    35. Estimative Verbs it has already been said end in tzem, but there  are other verbs of that termination that signify certain passion,  failing, or quality, as, hisumtzem, I am hungry; veráctzem, I am  thirsty; vrútzen, I am hot; vtétzen, I am cold, which form their  perfects in tziui, the futures in tzíuhtze.    TAAN.    36. _The Particle_ taan compounded with a substantive, signifies to  do, as, sibúrtaan, to make girdles composed of sibúra, band; zántaan,  to make arrows, zamát signifying arrow; vacotaan, to make bow, from  vácotzi, that instrument; but when it is component of the verb it  signifies, I say that I wish, thus from nósquen, I return, nósquitaan  is made, signifying, I say that I wish to return, and from pánauan,  labor, is pánauataan, I say that I wish to labor.    ENI, MANI, HABI,    Being the English substantive verb AM.    37. Such is the condition of this part of speech: yonder is a man,  anát sei dor _eni_, and if he live there, or is there standing, anát  catzí, etc., which catzí is used only for persons. Yonder is water,  anát, or aguát bat _maní_, yonder is grass, anát dósa _habí_, and also  may be said, bat eni, dosa eni, but bat habí, dosa mani would not be  correct. Further than this the substantive verb am appears not to show  itself clearly: thus that utterance of God, I am that I am, has no  corresponding words in the tongue: it could seemingly be made somewhat  intelligible in this wise: Nee uehva nee, which word for word means,  I greatly I, and am is not expressed though understood. So in asking,  Who is it, the answer is, Nee, and not I with the verb. This method of  speaking should be regarded: to say the house of Pedro was my house,  it should be, Pevroque qui no quiru, of which qui means house, and  Pevroque qui, house of Pedro. The verb was, does not now exist in it  apart, but in expression it appears, or nearly so, in the substantive  qui, which is put in the imperfect by the termination of that tense,  ru being added, as, quiru, was house; no quiru, was my house. The same  is otherwise said: Pevroque qui no guaguaru, the house of Pedro was  mine; the guagua, if alone, signifies, is mine.    MAGUAN.    38. There are several _Compound Verbs_ that end in maguan, which  signify, to throw something to another, as, ermaguan, to throw blood  (erát) on him; dósmaguan, to throw grass (dosát) on him; teúhmaguan,  to throw dirt (tevát) on him; sitórimaguan, to throw honey (sitóri) on  him, which form the perfect in guari, the future in guatze.    TADEN.    39 The _Particle_ táden, the terminal of several verbs, expresses the  like or dislike the good or evil appearance of anything according to  the name or adverb to which it is joined, as, neve sodóta nanactáden,  or hidenatóden, I do not like this bower; tamide naven tamo tademe,  we find ourselves poor; nee deosári no taden, I find myself"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14426"],[0,"London to Ladysmith via Pretoria (#4)"],[1,"e, except  ammunition, had fallen into the enemy's hands. Before that happened the  news of Elandslaagte had arrived, and this brilliant action, which  reflects no less credit on Generals French and Hamilton who fought it  than on Sir George White who ordered it, dazzled all eyes, so that the  sequel to Glencoe was unnoticed, or at any rate produced little effect  on public opinion.    The Natal Field Force is now concentrated at Ladysmith, and confronts  in daily opposition the bulk of the Boer Army. Though the numbers of the  enemy are superior and their courage claims the respect of their  professional antagonists, it is difficult to believe that any serious  reverse can take place in that quarter, and meanwhile many thousand  soldiers are on the seas. But the fact is now abundantly plain to those  who are acquainted with the local conditions and with the Boer  character, that a fierce, certainly bloody, possibly prolonged struggle  lies before the army of South Africa. The telegrams, however, which we  receive from Great Britain of the national feeling, of the bye-election,  of Lord Rosebery's speech, are full of encouragement and confidence. 'At  last,' says the British colonist, as he shoulders his rifle and marches  out to fight, no less bravely than any soldier (witness the casualty  lists), for the ties which bind South Africa to the Empire--'at last  they have made up their minds at home.'          CHAPTER III    ALONG THE SOUTHERN FRONTIER      East London: November 5, 1899.    We have left Headquarters busy with matters that as yet concern no one  but themselves in the Mount Nelson Hotel at Cape Town--a most excellent  and well-appointed establishment, which may be thoroughly appreciated  after a sea voyage, and which, since many of the leading Uitlanders have  taken up their abode there during the war, is nicknamed 'The Helot's  Rest.' Last night I started by rail for East London, whence a small ship  carries the weekly English mail to Natal, and so by this circuitous  route I hope to reach Ladysmith on Sunday morning. We have thus gained  three days on our friends who proceed by the 'Dunottar Castle,' and who  were mightily concerned when they heard--too late to follow--of our  intentions. But though it is true in this case that the longest way  round is the shortest way, there were possibilities of our journey being  interrupted, because the line from De Aar Junction to Naauwpoort runs  parallel to the southern frontier of the Free State, and though hostile  enterprises have not yet been attempted against this section of the  railways they must always be expected.    Railway travelling in South Africa is more expensive but just as  comfortable as in India. Lying-down accommodation is provided for all,  and meals can be obtained at convenient stopping places. The train,  which is built on the corridor system, runs smoothly over the rails--so  smoothly, indeed, that I found no difficulty in writing. The sun is  warm, and the air keen and delicious. But the scenery would depress the  most buoyant spirits. We climbed up the mountains during the night, and  with the daylight the train was in the middle of the Great Karroo.  Wherefore was this miserable land of stone and scrub created? Huge  mounds of crumbling rock, fashioned by the rains into the most curious  and unexpected shapes, rise from the gloomy desert of the plain. Yet,  though the Karroo looks a hopeless wilderness, flocks of sheep at  distant intervals--one sheep requires six hundred acres of this scrappy  pasture for nourishment--manage to subsist; and in consequence, now and  again the traveller sees some far-off farm.    We look about eagerly for signs of war. Little is as yet to be seen, and  the Karroo remains unsympathetic. But all along the southern frontier of  the Free State the expectation of early collision grows. The first sign  after leaving Cape Town is the Proclamation against treason published by  Sir Alfred Milner. The notice-boards of the railway stations are freely  placarded with the full text in English and Dutch, beginning with  'Whereas a state of war exists between the Government of her Majesty and  the Governments of the South African Republic and of the Orange Free  State ...' continuing to enjoin good and loyal behaviour on all,  detailing the pains and penalties for disobedience, and ending with 'God  save the Queen.' Both races have recorded their opinions on their  respective versions: the British by underlining the penalties, the Dutch  by crossing out the first word of 'God Save the Queen.' It is signed 'A.  Milner,' and below, in bitter irony, 'W.P. Schreiner.'    Beyond Matjesfontein every bridge, and even every culvert, is watched by  a Kaffir with a flag, so that the train runs no risk of coming on  unexpected demolitions. On the road to De Aar we passed the second half  of the Brigade Division of Artillery, which sailed so long ago from the  Mersey in the notorious transports 'Zibengla' and 'Zayathla.' The  gunners were hurrying to the front in three long trains, each taking  half a battery complete with guns, horses, and men. All were  light-hearted and confident, as soldiers going off to the wars always  are, and in this case their, satisfaction at being on land after five  weeks of uncomfortable voyage in antiquated ships was easily to be  understood. But this is no time for reproaches.    At Beaufort West grave news awaited the mail, and we learned of the  capitulation of twelve hundred soldiers near Ladysmith. It is generally  believed that this will precipitate a rising of the Dutch throughout  this part of the colony and an invasion by the commandos now gathered  along the Orange River. The Dutch farmers talk loudly and confidently of  'our victories,' meaning those of the Boers, and the racial feeling runs  high. But the British colonists have an implicit faith--marvellous when  the past is remembered--in the resolve of the Imperial Government and of  the nation never to abandon them again.    At De Aar the stage of our journey which may be said to have been  uncertain began. Armoured trains patrol the line; small parties of armed  police guard the bridges; infantry and artillery detachments occupy the  towns. De Aar, Colesberg, and Stormberg are garrisoned as strongly as  the present limited means allow, and all the forces, regulars and  volunteers alike, are full of enthusiasm. But, on the other hand, the  reports of Boer movements seem to indicate that a hostile advance is  imminent. The Colesberg bridge across the Orange River has been seized  by the enemy, the line between Bethulie and Colesberg has just been cut,  and each train from De Aar to Stormberg is expected to be the last to  pass unassailed. We, however, slept peacefully through the night, and,  passing Colesberg safely, arrived at Stormberg, beyond which all is  again secure.    Stormberg Junction stands at the southern end of a wide expanse of  rolling grass country, and though the numerous rocky hills, or kopjes as  they are called, which rise inconveniently on all sides, make its  defence by a small force difficult, a large force occupying an extended  position would be secure. Here we found the confirmation of many  rumours. The news of a Boer advance on Burghersdorp, twenty-five miles  away, is, it seems, well founded, and when our train arrived the  evacuation of Stormberg by its garrison, of a half-battalion of the  Berkshire Regiment, 350 men of the Naval Brigade, a company of mounted  infantry, and a few guns, was busily proceeding.    The sailors were already in their train, and only prevented from  starting by the want of an engine. The infantry and artillery were to  start in a few hours. It is rather an unsatisfactory business, though  the arrival of more powerful forces will soon restore the situation.  Stormberg is itself an important railway junction. For more than a week  the troops have been working night and day to put it in a state of  defence. Little redoubts have been built on the kopjes, entrenchments  have been dug, and the few houses near the station are already strongly  fortified. I was shown one of these by the young officer in charge. The  approaches were, cleared of everything except wire fences and  entanglements; the massive walls were loopholed, the windows barricaded  with sandbags, and the rooms inside broken one into the other for  convenience in moving about.    Its garrison of twenty-five men and its youthful commander surveyed the  work with pride. They had laid in stores of all kinds for ten days, and  none doubted that Fort Chabrol, as they called it, would stand a gallant  siege. Then suddenly had come the message to evacuate and retreat. So it  was with the others. The train with the naval detachment and its guns  steamed off, and we gave it a feeble cheer. Another train awaited the  Berkshires. The mounted infantry were already on the march. 'Mayn't we  even blow up this lot?' said a soldier, pointing to the house he had  helped to fortify. But there was no such order, only this one  which seemed to pervade the air: 'The enemy are coming.  Retreat--retreat--retreat!' The stationmaster--one of the best types of  Englishmen to be found on a long journey--was calm and cheerful.    'No more traffic north of this,' he said. 'Yours was the last train  through from De Aar. I shall send away all my men by the special  to-night. And that's the end as far as Stormberg goes.'    'And you?'    'Oh, I shall stay. I have lived here for twelve years, and am well  known. Perhaps I may be able to protect the company's property.'    While we waited the armoured train returned from patrolling--an engine  between two carriages cloaked from end to end with thick plates and  slabs of blue-grey iron. It had seen nothing of the advancing Boers,  but, like us and like the troops, it had to retire southwards. There  were fifty Uitlanders from Johannesburg on the platform. They had been  employed entrenching;"]]]
