He  is a God who will not leave it unavenged if men turn from Him, and will  not cease to be angry until the fourth generation, even until they are  utterly exterminated. Therefore He is to be feared, and not to be  desisted.    He has also demonstrated this in all history, as the Scriptures  abundantly show and daily experience still teaches. For from the  beginning He has utterly extirpated all idolatry, and, on account of  it, both heathen and Jews; even as at the present day He overthrows all  false worship, so that all who remain therein must finally perish.  Therefore, although proud, powerful, and rich worldlings  [Sardanapaluses and Phalarides, who surpass even the Persians in  wealth] are now to be found, who boast defiantly of their Mammon, with  utter disregard whether God is angry at or smiles on them, and dare to  withstand His wrath, yet they shall not succeed, but before they are  aware, they shall be wrecked, with all in which they trusted; as all  others have perished who have thought themselves more secure or  powerful. And just because of such hardened heads who imagine because  God connives and allows them to rest in security, that He either is  entirely ignorant or cares nothing about such matters, He must deal a  smashing blow and punish them, so that He cannot forget it unto  children's children; so that every one may take note and see that this  is no joke to Him. For they are those whom He means when He says: Who  hate Me, i.e., those who persist in their defiance and pride; whatever  is preached or said to them, they will not listen; when they are  reproved, in order that they may learn to know themselves and amend  before the punishment begins, they become mad and foolish so as to  fairly merit wrath, as now we see daily in bishops and princes.    But terrible as are these threatenings, so much the more powerful is  the consolation in the promise, that those who cling to God alone  should be sure that He will show them mercy that is, show them pure  goodness and blessing not only for themselves, but also to their  children and children's children, even to the thousandth generation and  beyond that. This ought certainly to move and impel us to risk our  hearts in all confidence with God, if we wish all temporal and eternal  good, since the Supreme Majesty makes such sublime offers and presents  such cordial inducements and such rich promises.    Therefore let everyone seriously take this to heart, lest it be  regarded as though a man had spoken it. For to you it is a question  either of eternal blessing, happiness, and salvation, or of eternal  wrath, misery, and woe. What more would you have or desire than that He  so kindly promises to be yours with every blessing, and to protect and  help you in all need?    But, alas! here is the failure, that the world believes nothing of  this, nor regards it as God's Word, because it sees that those who  trust in God and not in Mammon suffer care and want, and the devil  opposes and resists them, that they have neither money, favor, nor  honor, and, besides, can scarcely support life; while, on the other  hand, those who serve Mammon have power, favor, honor, possessions, and  every comfort in the eyes of the world. For this reason, these words  must be grasped as being directed against such appearances; and we must  consider that they do not lie or deceive, but must come true.    Reflect for yourself or make inquiry and tell me: Those who have  employed all their care and diligence to accumulate great possessions  and wealth, what have they finally attained? You will find that they  have wasted their toil and labor, or even though they have amassed  great treasures, they have been dispersed and scattered, so that the  themselves have never found happiness in their wealth, and afterwards  never reached the third generation. Instances of this you will find a  plenty in all histories, also in the memory of aged and experienced  people. Only observe and ponder them.    Saul was a great king, chosen of God and a godly man; but when he was  established on his throne, and let his heart decline from God, and put  his trust in his crown and power, he had to perish with all that he  had, so that none even of his children remained. David, on the other  hand, was a poor, despised man, hunted down and chased, so that he  nowhere felt secure of his life; yet he had to remain in spite of Saul,  and become king. For these words had to abide and come true, since God  cannot lie or deceive. Only let not the devil and the world deceive you  with their show, which indeed remains for a time, but finally is  nothing.    Let us, then, learn well the First Commandment, that we may see how God  will tolerate no presumption nor any trust in any other object, and how  He requires nothing higher of us than confidence from the heart for  everything good, so that we may proceed right and straightforward and  use all the blessings which God gives no farther than as a shoemaker  uses his needle, awl, and thread for work, and then lays them aside, or  as a traveler uses an inn, and food, and his bed only for temporal  necessity, each one in his station, according to God's order, and  without allowing any of these things to be our food or idol. Let this  suffice with respect to the First Commandment, which we have had to  explain at length, since it is of chief importance, because, as before  said, where the heart is rightly disposed toward God and this  commandment is observed, all the others follow.        The Second Commandment.    Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord, thy God, in vain.      As the First Commandment has instructed the heart and taught [the  basis of] faith, so this commandment leads us forth and directs the  mouth and tongue to God. For the first objects that spring from the  heart and manifest themselves are words. Now, as I have taught above  how to answer the question, what it is to have a god, so you must learn  to comprehend simply the meaning of this and all the commandments, and  to apply it to yourself. If, then, it be asked: How do you understand  the Second Commandment, or what is meant by taking in vain, or misusing  God's name? answer briefly thus: It is misusing God's name when we call  upon the Lord God no matter in what way, for purposes of falsehood or  wrong of any kind. Therefore this commandment enjoins this much, that  God's name must not be appealed to falsely, or taken upon the lips  while the heart knows well enough, or should know, differently; as  among those who take oaths in court, where one side lies against the  other. For God's name cannot be misused worse than for the support of  falsehood and deceit. Let4this remain the exact German and simplest  meaning of this commandment.    From this every one can readily infer when and in how many ways God's  name is misused, although it is impossible to enumerate all its  misuses. Yet, to tell it in a few words, all misuse of the divine name  occurs, first, in worldly business and in matters which concern money,  possessions, honor, whether it be publicly in court, in the market, or  wherever else men make false oaths in God's name, or pledge their souls  in any matter. And this is especially prevalent in marriage affairs  where two go and secretly betroth themselves to one another, and  afterward abjure [their plighted troth].    But. the greatest abuse occurs in spiritual matters, which pertain to  the conscience, when false preachers rise up and offer their Lying  vanities as God's Word. Behold, all this is decking one's self out with  God's name, or making a pretty show, or claiming to be right, whether  it occur in gross, worldly business or in sublime, subtle matters of  faith and doctrine. And among liars belong also blasphemers, not alone  the very gross, well known to every one, who disgrace God's name  without fear (these are not for us, but for the hangman to discipline);  but also those who publicly traduce the truth and God's Word and  consign it to the devil. Of this there is no need now to speak further.      Here, then, let us learn and take to heart the great importance of this  commandment, that with all diligence we may guard against and dread  every misuse of the holy name, as the greatest sin that can be  outwardly committed. For to lie and deceive is in itself a great sin,  but is greatly aggravated when we attempt to justify it, and seek to  confirm it by invoking the name of God and using it as a cloak for  shame, so that from a single lie a double lie, nay, manifold lies,  result.    For this reason, too, God has added a solemn threat to this  commandment, to wit: For the Lord will not hold him guiltless that  taketh His name in van. That is: It shall not be condoned to any one  nor pass unpunished. For as little as He will leave it unavenged if any  one turn his heart from Him, as little will He suffer His name to be  employed for dressing up a lie. Now alas! it is a common calamity in  all the word that there are as few who are not using the name of God  for purposes of Lying and all wickedness as there are those who with  their heart trust alone in God. For by nature we all have within us  this beautiful virtue, to wit, that whoever has committed a wrong would  like to cover up and adorn his disgrace, so that no one may see it or  know it; and no one is so bold as to boast to all the world of the  wickedness he has perpetrated, all wish to act by stealth and without  any one being aware of what thy do. Then, if any one be arraigned, the  name of God is dragged into the affair and must make the villainy look  like godliness, and the shame like honor. This is the common course of  the world, which, like a great deluge, has flooded all lands."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17221"],[0,"History of the Plague in London (#4)"],[1,"e, of the street; and as  the distemper had not reached to that side of the city, our neighborhood  continued very easy. But at the other end of the town their  consternation was very great; and the richer sort of people, especially  the nobility and gentry from the west part of the city, thronged out of  town, with their families and servants, in an unusual manner. And this  was more particularly seen in Whitechapel; that is to say, the Broad  Street where I lived. Indeed, nothing was to be seen but wagons and  carts, with goods, women, servants, children, etc.; coaches filled with  people of the better sort, and horsemen attending them, and all hurrying  away; then empty wagons and carts appeared, and spare horses with  servants, who it was apparent were returning, or sent from the country  to fetch more people; besides innumerable numbers of men on horseback,  some alone, others with servants, and, generally speaking, all loaded  with baggage, and fitted out for traveling, as any one might perceive by  their appearance.    This was a very terrible and melancholy thing to see, and as it was a  sight which I could not but look on from morning to night (for indeed  there was nothing else of moment to be seen), it filled me with very  serious thoughts of the misery that was coming upon the city, and the  unhappy condition of those that would be left in it.    This hurry of the people was such for some weeks, that there was no  getting at the lord mayor's door without exceeding difficulty; there was  such pressing and crowding there to get passes and certificates of  health for such as traveled abroad; for, without these, there was no  being admitted to pass through the towns upon the road, or to lodge in  any inn. Now, as there had none died in the city for all this time, my  lord mayor gave certificates of health without any difficulty to all  those who lived in the ninety-seven parishes, and to those within the  liberties too, for a while.    This hurry, I say, continued some weeks, that is to say, all the months  of May and June; and the more because it was rumored that an order of  the government was to be issued out, to place turnpikes[21] and barriers  on the road to prevent people's traveling; and that the towns on the  road would not suffer people from London to pass, for fear of bringing  the infection along with them, though neither of these rumors had any  foundation but in the imagination, especially at first.    I now began to consider seriously with myself concerning my own case,  and how I should dispose of myself; that is to say, whether I should  resolve to stay in London, or shut up my house and flee, as many of my  neighbors did. I have set this particular down so fully, because I know  not but it may be of moment to those who come after me, if they come to  be brought to the same distress and to the same manner of making their  choice; and therefore I desire this account may pass with them rather  for a direction to themselves to act by than a history of my actings,  seeing it may not be of one farthing value to them to note what became  of me.    I had two important things before me: the one was the carrying on my  business and shop, which was considerable, and in which was embarked all  my effects in the world; and the other was the preservation of my life  in so dismal a calamity as I saw apparently was coming upon the whole  city, and which, however great it was, my fears perhaps, as well as  other people's, represented to be much greater than it could be.    The first consideration was of great moment to me. My trade was a  saddler, and as my dealings were chiefly not by a shop or chance trade,  but among the merchants trading to the English colonies in America, so  my effects lay very much in the hands of such. I was a single man, it is  true; but I had a family of servants, who[22] I kept at my business; had  a house, shop, and warehouses filled with goods; and in short to leave  them all as things in such a case must be left, that is to say, without  any overseer or person fit to be trusted with them, had been to hazard  the loss, not only of my trade, but of my goods, and indeed of all I had  in the world.    I had an elder brother at the same time in London, and not many years  before come over from Portugal; and, advising with him, his answer was  in the three words, the same that was given in another case[23] quite  different, viz., \"Master, save thyself.\" In a word, he was for my  retiring into the country, as he resolved to do himself, with his  family; telling me, what he had, it seems, heard abroad, that the best  preparation for the plague was to run away from it. As to my argument of  losing my trade, my goods, or debts, he quite confuted me: he told me  the same thing which I argued for my staying, viz., that I would trust  God with my safety and health was the strongest repulse[24] to my  pretensions of losing my trade and my goods. \"For,\" says he, \"is it not  as reasonable that you should trust God with the chance or risk of  losing your trade, as that you should stay in so eminent a point of  danger, and trust him with your life?\"    I could not argue that I was in any strait as to a place where to go,  having several friends and relations in Northamptonshire, whence our  family first came from; and particularly, I had an only sister in  Lincolnshire, very willing to receive and entertain me.    My brother, who had already sent his wife and two children into  Bedfordshire, and resolved to follow them, pressed my going very  earnestly; and I had once resolved to comply with his desires, but at  that time could get no horse: for though it is true all the people did  not go out of the city of London, yet I may venture to say, that in a  manner all the horses did; for there was hardly a horse to be bought or  hired in the whole city for some weeks. Once I resolved to travel on  foot with one servant, and, as many did, lie at no inn, but carry a  soldier's tent with us, and so lie in the fields, the weather being very  warm, and no danger from taking cold. I say, as many did, because  several did so at last, especially those who had been in the armies, in  the war[25] which had not been many years past: and I must needs say,  that, speaking of second causes, had most of the people that traveled  done so, the plague had not been carried into so many country towns and  houses as it was, to the great damage, and indeed to the ruin, of  abundance of people.    But then my servant who[26] I had intended to take down with me,  deceived me, and being frighted at the increase of the distemper, and  not knowing when I should go, he took other measures, and left me: so I  was put off for that time. And, one way or other, I always found that to  appoint to go away was always crossed by some accident or other, so as  to disappoint and put it off again. And this brings in a story which  otherwise might be thought a needless digression, viz., about these  disappointments being from Heaven.    It came very warmly into my mind one morning, as I was musing on this  particular thing, that as nothing attended us without the direction or  permission of Divine Power, so these disappointments must have something  in them extraordinary, and I ought to consider whether it did not  evidently point out, or intimate to me, that it was the will of Heaven I  should not go. It immediately followed in my thoughts, that, if it  really was from God that I should stay, he was able effectually to  preserve me in the midst of all the death and danger that would surround  me; and that if I attempted to secure myself by fleeing from my  habitation, and acted contrary to these intimations, which I believed to  be divine, it was a kind of flying from God, and that he could cause his  justice to overtake me when and where he thought fit.[27]    These thoughts quite turned my resolutions again; and when I came to  discourse with my brother again, I told him that I inclined to stay and  take my lot in that station in which God had placed me; and that it  seemed to be made more especially my duty, on the account of what I have  said.    My brother, though a very religious man himself, laughed at all I had  suggested about its being an intimation from Heaven, and told me several  stories of such foolhardy people, as he called them, as I was; that I  ought indeed to submit to it as a work of Heaven if I had been any way  disabled by distempers or diseases, and that then, not being able to go,  I ought to acquiesce in the direction of Him, who, having been my Maker,  had an undisputed right of sovereignty in disposing of me; and that then  there had been no difficulty to determine which was the call of his  providence, and which was not; but that I should take it as an  intimation from Heaven that I should not go out of town, only because I  could not hire a horse to go, or my fellow was run away that was to  attend me, was ridiculous, since at the same time I had my health and  limbs, and other servants, and might with ease travel a day or two on  foot, and, having a good certificate of being in perfect health, might  either hire a horse, or take post on the road, as I thought fit.    Then he proceeded to tell me of the mischievous consequences which  attend the presumption of the Turks and Mohammedans in Asia, and in  other places where he had been (for my brother, being a merchant, was a  few years before, as I have already observed, returned from abroad,  coming last from Lisbon); and how, presuming upon their professed  predestinating[28] notions, and of every man's end being predetermined,  and unalterably beforehand decreed, they would go unconcerned into  infected places, and converse with infected persons, by which means they  died at the rate of ten or fifteen thousand a week, whereas the  Europeans, or Christian merchants, who kept themselves retired and  reserved, generally escaped the contagion.
