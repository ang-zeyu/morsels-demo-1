A month before nothing could have been more easy; but within that time  the enemy had perceived the importance of the promontory, which commands  the narrow passage between the port and the Mediterranean, and fortified  it so strongly, that it passed by the name of the Little Gibraltar. It  was necessary, therefore, to form extensive batteries in the rear of La  Grasse, before there could be a prospect of seizing it. Buonaparte  laboured hard all day, and slept every night in his cloak by the guns,  until his works approached perfection. He also formed a large battery  behind Malbosquet; but this he carefully concealed from the enemy. It  was covered by a plantation of olives, and he designed to distract their  attention by opening its fire for the first time when he should be about  to make his great effort against Little Gibraltar. But the  Representatives of the People had nearly spoiled everything. These  gentlemen, walking their rounds, discovered the battery behind the  olives, and inquiring how long it had been ready, were told for eight  days. Not guessing with what views so many guns had been kept so long  idle, they ordered an immediate cannonade. The English made a vigorous  sally, and spiked the guns before Buonaparte could reach the spot. On  his arrival at the eminence behind, he perceived a long deep ditch,  fringed with brambles and willows, which he thought might be turned to  advantage. He ordered a regiment of foot to creep along the ditch, which  they did without being discovered until they were close upon the enemy.  General O'Hara, the English commander, mistook them for some of his own  allies, and, rushing out to give them some direction, was wounded and  made prisoner. The English were dispirited when they lost their general;  they retreated, and the French were at liberty to set about the repair  of their battery. In this affair much blood was shed. Napoleon himself  received a bayonet-thrust in his thigh, and fell into the arms of  Muiron, who carried him off the field. Such was the commencement of  their brotherly friendship. His wound, however, did not prevent him from  continuing his labours behind Little Gibraltar.    That fort had very nearly been seized, by a sort of accident, some time  before his preparations were completed; a casual insult excited a sudden  quarrel between the men in Buonaparte's trenches and the Spaniards in  Little Gibraltar. The French soldiers, without waiting for orders,  seized their arms, and rushed to the assault with fury. Napoleon coming  up, perceived that the moment was favourable, and persuaded Doppet to  support the troops with more regiments; but the doctor, marching at the  head of his column, was seized with a panic, on seeing a man killed by  his side, and ordered a retreat, before anything could be effected.    A few days after, this poltroon was in his turn superseded by a brave  veteran, General Dugommier, and Napoleon could at last count on having  his efforts backed. But, for the second time, the Representatives did  their best to ruin his undertaking. The siege had now lasted four  months, provisions were scarce in the camp, and these civilians, never  being able to comprehend what was meant by bestowing all this care on a  place so far below the city as Little Gibraltar, wrote to Paris that  they saw no chance of success, and hoped the government would agree with  them that the siege ought to be abandoned. Two days before this letter  reached Paris, Toulon had fallen, and the Representatives gave out that  the despatch was a forgery.    The moment had at last come when Buonaparte judged it right to make his  grand attempt. During the night of the 17th of December he threw 8000  bombs and shells into Little Gibraltar, and the works being thus  shattered, at daybreak Dugommier commanded the assault. The French,  headed by the brave Muiron, rushed with impetuous valour through the  embrasures, and put the whole garrison to the sword. The day was spent  in arranging the batteries, so as to command the shipping; and next  morning--so true had been Buonaparte's prophecy--when the French stood  to their posts, the English fleet was discovered to be already under  weigh.    Then followed a fearful scene. The English would not quit Toulon without  destroying the French ships and arsenals that had fallen into their  possession; nor could they refuse to carry with them the Antijacobin  inhabitants, who knew that their lives would be instantly sacrificed if  they should fall into the hands of the victorious Republicans, and who  now flocked to the beach to the number of 14,000, praying for the means  of escape. The burning of ships, the explosion of magazines, the roar of  artillery, and the cries of these fugitives, filled up many hours. At  last the men-of-war were followed by a flotilla bearing those miserable  exiles; the walls were abandoned; and Dugommier took possession of the  place.    The Republicans found that all persons of condition, who had taken part  against them, had escaped; and their rage was to be contented with  meaner victims. A day or two having been suffered to pass in quiet, a  proclamation, apparently friendly, exhorted the workmen, who had been  employed on the batteries of the besieged town, to muster at  headquarters. One hundred and fifty poor men, who expected to be  employed again in repairing the same fortifications obeyed this  summons--were instantly marched into a field--and shot in cold blood;  not less than a thousand persons were massacred under circumstances  equally atrocious. Buonaparte himself repelled with indignation the  charge of having had a hand in this butchery. Even if he had, he was not  the chief in command, and durst not have disobeyed orders but at the  sacrifice of his own life. It is on all sides admitted that a family of  royalists, being shipwrecked on the coast near Toulon a few days after,  were rescued from the hands of the ferocious Republicans, solely by his  interference and address. Putting himself at the head of some of his  gunners, he obtained possession of the unhappy prisoners; quieted the  mob by assuring them that they should all be publicly executed the next  morning; and meanwhile sent them off during the night in artillery  waggons supposed to be conveying stores.    The recovery of Toulon was a service of the first importance to the  government. It suppressed all insurrectionary spirit in the south of  France; and placed a whole army at their disposal elsewhere. But he, to  whose genius the success was due, did not at first obtain the credit of  his important achievement at Paris. The Representatives of the People  never made their appearance on the eventful morning at Little Gibraltar,  until three hours after the troops were in possession of the best part  of the fortifications. Then, indeed, they were seen sword in hand in the  trenches, blustering and swaggering in safety. Yet these men did not  blush to represent themselves as having headed the assault, while, in  their account of the conflict, even the name of Buonaparte did not find  a place. The truth could not, however, be concealed effectually; and he  was appointed to survey and arrange the whole line of fortifications on  the Mediterranean coast of France.    It was during the siege of Toulon that Napoleon, while constructing a  battery under the enemy's fire, had occasion to prepare a despatch, and  called out for some one who could use a pen. A young sergeant, named  Junot, leapt out, and, leaning on the breastwork, wrote as he dictated.  As he finished, a shot struck the ground by his side, scattering dust in  abundance over him and everything near him. \"Good,\" said the soldier,  laughing, \"this time we shall spare our sand.\" The cool gaiety of this  pleased Buonaparte; he kept his eye on the man; and Junot came in the  sequel to be Marshal of France and Duke of Abrantes.          CHAPTER III         Buonaparte Chief of Battalion at Nice--Fall of Robespierre--He is       superseded--Buonaparte at Paris in 1795--The day of the       Sections--Commands the Army of the Interior--Marries Josephine de       Beauharnois--Appointed to the command of the Army of Italy.      From this time Napoleon advanced by rapid strides to greatness. His  admirable skill was still further displayed in his survey of the  fortifications above mentioned; and having completed this service, he  was appointed to join the army of Italy, then stationed at Nice, with  the rank of Chief of Battalion.    Here his advice suggested a plan by which the Sardinians were driven  from the Col di Tende on the 7th March, 1794; Saorgio, with all its  stores, surrendered; and the French obtained possession of the maritime  Alps, so that the difficulties of advancing into Italy were greatly  diminished. Of these movements, however, his superior officers reaped as  yet the honour. He was even superseded (Aug. 6, 1794) very shortly after  their success. But this, which at the moment seemed a heavy misfortune,  was, in truth, one of the luckiest circumstances that ever befell him.    It is not true that he was put under arrest in consequence of the  downfall of Robespierre; although there is no doubt that he was supposed  to belong to the party which that monster had made the instrument of his  crimes, and known to have lived on terms of friendship with his younger  brother. He incurred the suspicion of Laporte and the other  \"Representatives\" attached to \"the army of Italy,\" in consequence of a  journey to the Gulf of Genoa, which he performed in obedience to secret"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17587"],[0,"Field Hospital and Flying Column (#4)"],[1," of grumbling or complaint was ever heard from them. They worked  from morning till night and got the hospital into splendid order. The  Committee were good enough to allow me to keep the best of the Red Cross  workers as probationers and to forbid entrance to the others. We had  suffered so much at their hands before this took place, that I was truly  grateful for this permission as no discipline or order was possible with  a large number of young girls constantly rushing in and out, sitting on  patients' beds, meddling with dressings, and doing all kinds of things  they shouldn't.    I am sure that no hospital ever had nicer patients than ours were. The  French patients, though all severely wounded and prisoners in the hands  of the Germans, bore their troubles cheerfully, even gaily. We had a  great variety of regiments represented in the hospital: Tirailleurs,  Zouaves, one Turco from Algeria--our big good-natured Adolphe--soldiers  from Paris, from Brittany and from Normandy, especially from Calvados.  The German soldiers, too, behaved quite well, and were very grateful for  everything done for them--mercifully we had no officers. We had not  separate rooms for them--French and German soldiers lay side by side in  the public wards.    One of the most harrowing things during that time was the way all the  Belgians were watching for the English troops to deliver them from the  yoke of their oppressor. Every day, many times a day, when German rules  got more and more stringent and autocratic, and fresh tales of  unnecessary harshness and cruelty were circulated, they would say over  and over again, \"Where are the English? If only the English would come!\"  Later they got more bitter and we heard, \"Why don't the English come and  help us as they promised? If only the English would come, it would be  all right.\" And so on, till I almost felt as if I could not bear it any  longer. One morning some one came in and said English soldiers had been  seen ten kilometres away. We heard the sound of distant cannon in a new  direction, and watched and waited, hoping to see the English ride in.  But some one must have mistaken the German khaki for ours, for no  English were ever near that place. There was no news of what was really  happening in the country, no newspapers ever got through, and we had  nothing to go upon but the German _affiches_ proclaiming victories  everywhere, the German trains garlanded with laurels and faded roses,  marked \"Destination--Paris,\" and the large batches of French prisoners  that were constantly marched through the town. An inscription written  over a doorway in Charleroi amused us rather: \"Vive Guillaume II, roi de  l'univers.\" Not yet, not yet, William.    Later on the Belgians issued a wonderful little newspaper at irregular  intervals of three or four days, typewritten and passed from hand to  hand. The most amazing news was published in it, which we always firmly  believed, till it was contradicted in the next issue. I collected two or  three copies of this paper as a curiosity, but unfortunately lost them  later on, with all my papers and luggage. One or two items I remember  quite well. One gave a vivid account of how the Queen of Holland had  killed her husband because he had allowed the Germans to pass through  Maestricht; another even more circumstantial story was that England had  declared war on Holland, Holland had submitted at once, and England  imposed many stringent conditions, of which I only remember two. One  was, that all her trade with Germany should cease at once; secondly,  that none of her lighthouses should show light at night.    One of the German surgeons who used to operate at our hospital was  particularly ingenious in inventing tortures for me; I used to have to  help him in his operations, and he would recount to me with gusto how  the English had retreated from Mons, how the Germans were getting nearer  and nearer to Paris, how many English killed, wounded and prisoners  there were, and so on. One morning he began about the Fleet and said  that a great battle was going on in the North Sea, and going very badly  for the English. I had two brothers fighting in the North Sea of whom I  had no news since the war began, and I could bear it no longer, but fled  from the operating-room.    Charleroi and its neighbourhood was just one large German camp, its  position on the railway making it a particularly valuable base for them.  The proclamations and rules for the behaviour of the inhabitants became  daily more and more intolerant. It was forbidden to lock the door, or  open the window, or pull down the blinds, or allow your dog out of the  house; all German officers were to be saluted--and if there was any  doubt, any German soldier was to be saluted, and so on, day after day.  One really funny one I wish I could reproduce. It forbade anyone to  \"wear a menacing look\" but it did not say who was to be the judge of  this look.    Every one was too restless and unhappy to settle to anything, all the  most important shops were burnt down, and very few of those that were  left were open. The whole population seemed to spend all their time in  the street waiting for something to happen. Certainly the Germans seem  to have had a special \"down\" on Charleroi and its neighbourhood, so many  villages in its vicinity were burnt down and most abominable cruelties  practised on its inhabitants. The peasants who were left were simply  terrorized, as no doubt the Germans meant them to be, and a white flag  hung from nearly every cottage window denoting complete submission. In  one village some German soldier wrote in chalk on the door of a house  where he had been well received, \"Guete Leute hier,\" and these poor  people got chalk and tried to copy the difficult German writing on every  door in the street. I am afraid that did not save them, however, when  their turn came. It was the utter ruthlessness and foresight with which  every contingency was prepared for that appalled me and made me realize  what a powerful enemy we were up against. Everything was thought out  down to the last detail and must have been prepared months beforehand.  Even their wagons for transport were all painted the same slate-grey  colour, while the English and Belgians were using any cart they could  commandeer in the early days, as I afterwards saw in a German camp  Pickford's vans and Lyons' tea carts that they had captured from us.  Even their postal arrangements were complete; we saw their grey  \"Feld-Post\" wagons going to and fro quite at the beginning of the war.    Several people in Charleroi told me that the absolute system and  organization of destruction frightened them more than the actual fire  itself. Every German soldier had a little hatchet, and when Charleroi  was fired, they simply went down the street as if they had been drilled  to it for months, cutting a square hole in the panel of each door, and  throwing a ball of celluloid filled with benzine inside. This exploded  and set the house on fire, and later on the soldiers would return to see  if it was burning well. They were entirely indifferent as to whether  anyone were inside or not, as the following incident, which came under  my notice, will show. Two English Red Cross Sisters were working at an  ambulance in Charleroi, and lodging with some people in the centre of  the city. When the town was being burnt they asked leave to go and try  to save some of their possessions. They arrived at the house, however,  and found it entirely burnt down, and all their things destroyed. They  were returning rather sorrowfully to their hospital when an old woman  accosted them and told them that a woman with a new-born infant was  lying in bed in one of the burning houses.    The house was not burning badly, and they got into it quite easily and  found the woman lying in bed with her little infant beside her, almost  out of her wits with terror, but too weak to move. The nurses found they  could not manage alone, so went down into the street to find a man. They  found, after some trouble, a man who had only one arm and got him to  help them take the woman to the hospital. One of the nurses was carrying  the baby, the other with the one-armed man was supporting the mother,  when the German soldiers fired at the little party, and the one-armed  man fell bleeding at the side of the road. The Sisters were obliged to  leave him for the moment, and went on with the mother and infant to the  hospital, got a stretcher and came back and fetched the man and brought  him also to the hospital. It was only a flesh wound in the shoulder and  he made a good recovery, but what a pitiful little group to waste  ammunition on--a newly confined mother and her infant, two Red Cross  Sisters and a crippled man.    One can only imagine that they were drunk when they did these kind of  things, for individually the German soldier is generally a decent  fellow, though some of the Prussian officers are unspeakable. Discipline  is very severe and the soldiers are obliged to carry out orders without  troubling themselves about rights and wrongs. It is curious that very  few German soldiers know why they are fighting, and they are always told  such wonderful stories of German victories that they think the war will  soon be over. When they arrived at Charleroi, for instance, they were  told they were at Charleville, and nearly all our wounded German  soldiers thought they were already in France. They also thought Paris  was already taken and London in flames. It hardly seems worth while to  lie to them in this way, for they are bound to find out the truth sooner  or later.          III    OUR HOSPITAL AND PATIENTS      After we had had a long week of night and day work, two more of my  nurses suddenly turned up at the hospital. They had most unexpectedly  got a message that I had sent in by hand to Brussels, begging for nurses  and saying how hard pressed we were, and"]]]
