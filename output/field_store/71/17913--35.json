COLEMAN.      Mr. Chairman and gentlemen: I was rash enough some time ago to promise  to prepare a paper for this occasion, the fulfillment of which prior  engagements have absolutely prevented.    I would greatly prefer to be let off altogether, but I do not like to  break down when expected to do anything; and if you have the patience  to listen for a few minutes to the reflections of an \"outsider,\" I  will endeavor to put what I have to say in as concise form as I can,  in such manner as will do no harm, even if it does no good.    For many years I was connected with steam engineering. I was once with  the Corliss Steam Engine Company, and afterward was the agent of Mr.  Joseph Harrison, of Russian fame, for the introduction of his safety  boilers.    That brought me into contact with the heavy manufacturers throughout  the Eastern States, and during that long experience I was particularly  impressed with a peculiarity common to the mill owners, which, I  believe it may be said with truth, is equally common to those  interested in locomotive engineering, namely, how much we overlook  common, every-day facts. For instance, we burn coal; that is, we think  we do, and boilers are put into mills and upon railroads, and we  suppose we are burning coal under them, when in reality we are only  partially doing so. We think that because coal is consumed it  necessarily is burned, but such is frequently very far from the fact.    I wish upon the present occasion to make merely a sort of general  statement of what I conceive to be combustion, and what I conceive to  be a boiler, and then to try to make a useful application of these  ideas to the locomotive.    Treating first the subject of combustion, let us take the top of the  grate-bars as our starting point. When we shovel coal upon the grate  bars and ignite it, what happens first? We separate the two  constituents of coal, the carbon from the hydrogen. We make a gas  works. Carbon by itself will burn no more than a stone; neither will  hydrogen. It requires a given number of equivalents of oxygen to mix  with so many equivalents of carbon, and a given number of equivalents  of oxygen to mix with so many of hydrogen to form that union which is  necessary to produce heat. This requires time, space, and air, and one  thing more, viz., heat.    I presume that most of you have read Charles Williams' treatise upon  \"Combustion,\" which was published many years ago, and which until  recently was often quoted as an absolute authority upon the art of  burning fuel under boilers. Mr. Williams in his treatise accurately  describes the chemistry of combustion, but he has misled the world for  fifty years by an error in reasoning and the failure to discuss a  certain mechanical fact connected with the combination of gases in the  process of combustion. He said: \"What is the use of heating the air  put into a furnace? If you take a cubic foot of air, it contains just  so many atoms of oxygen, neither more nor less. If the air be heated,  you cause it to assume double its volume, but you have not added a  single atom of oxygen, and you will require twice the space for its  passage between the grate bars, and twice the space in the furnace,  which is a nuisance; but if the air could be frozen, it would be  condensed, and more atoms of oxygen could be crowded into the cubic  foot, and the fire would receive a corresponding advantage.\" Mr.  Williams proceeded upon this theory, and died without solving the  perplexing mystery of as frequent failure as success which attended  his experiments with steamship boilers. The only successes which he  obtained were misleading, because they were made with boilers so badly  proportioned for their work that almost any change would produce  benefit.    Successful combustion requires something more than the necessary  chemical elements of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, for it requires  something to cook the elements, so to speak, and that is heat, and for  this reason: When the coal is volatilized in the furnace, what would  be a cubic foot of gas, if cold, is itself heated and its volume  increased to double its normal proportion. It is thin and attenuated.  The cold air which is introduced to the furnace is denser than the  gas. With dampers wide open in the chimney, and the gases and air  passing into the flues with a velocity of 40 feet per second, they  strike the colder surface of the tubes, and are cooled below the point  of combustion before they have had time to become assimilated; and  although an opponent in a debate upon steam boiler tests once stated  that his thermometer in the chimney showed only 250 degrees, and  indicated that all the value that was practical had been obtained from  the coal, I took the liberty to maintain that a chemist might have  analyzed the gases and shown there were dollars in them; and that if  the thermometer had been removed from the chimney and placed in the  pile of coal outside the boiler, it would have gone still lower; but  it would not have proved the value to have been extracted from the  coal, for it was not the complete test to apply.    The condition of things in the furnace may be illustrated thus: If we  should mingle a quart of molasses and a gallon of water, it would  require considerable manipulation and some time to cause them to  unite. Why? Because one element is so much denser than the other; but  if we should mix a quart of the gallon of water with the quart of  molasses, and render their densities somewhere near the density of the  remaining water, and then pour the masses together, there would be a  more speedy commingling of the two. And so with the furnace. I have  always maintained that every furnace should be lined with fire-brick,  in order that it shall be so intensely hot when the air enters that  the air shall instantly be heated to the same degree of tenuity as the  hot gases themselves, and the two will then unite like a flash--and  that is heat. And here is the solution of the Wye Williams mystery of  failure when cold air was introduced upon the top of a fire to aid  combustion. The proof of the necessity for heat to aid the chemical  assimilation of the volatilized coal elements is seen in starting a  fire in a common stove. At first there is only a blue flame, in which  the hand may be held; but wait until the lining becomes white hot, and  then throw on a little coal, and you will find a totally different  result. It is also seen in the Siemens gas furnace, with which you are  doubtless familiar. There is the introduction of gas with its  necessary complement of air. Until the furnace and retorts become  heated, the air and gas flutter through only partially united, and do  little good; but as soon as the retorts and furnace become thoroughly  hot, the same gas and air will melt a fire-brick.    These are common phenomena, which are familiar, but apt to be  unnoticed; but they logically point to the truth that no furnaces  should present a cooling medium in contact with fuel which is  undergoing this process of digestion, so to speak. It will be very  evident, I think, from these facts that water-legs in direct contact  with a fire are a mistake. They tend to check a fire as far as their  influence extends, as a thin sheet of ice upon the stomach after  dinner would check digestion, and for the same reason, namely, the  abstraction of heat from a chemical process. If fire-brick could be  laid around a locomotive furnace, and the grate, of course, kept of  the same area as before, it is my belief that a very important  advantage would be at once apparent. An old-fashioned cast iron heater  always produced a treacherous fire. It would grow dead around the  outside next to the cold iron; but put a fire-clay lining into it, and  it was as good as any other stove.    If I have now made clear what I mean by making heat, we will next  consider the steam boiler. What is a steam boiler? It is a thing to  absorb heat. The bottom line of this science is the bottom of a pot  over a fire, which is the best boiler surface in the world; there is  water upon one side of a piece of iron and heat against the other. One  square foot of the iron will transmit through it a given number of  units of heat into the water at a given temperature in a given time;  two square feet twice as many, and three, three times as many, and so  on. Put a cover upon the pot, and seal it tight, leave an orifice for  the steam, and that is a steam boiler with all its mysteries.    The old-fashioned, plain cylinder boiler is a plain cylindrical pot  over the fire. If enough plain cylinder boilers presenting the  requisite number of square feet of absorbing surface are put into a  cotton mill, experience has shown that they will make a yard of cotton  cloth about as cheaply as tubular boilers. If this is so, why do not  all put them in?

All these troops constituted the First German Army, which was directed  against the French Sixth Army on the Ourcq, and the British forces, and  the left of the Fifth French Army south of the Marne.    The Second German Army (IX., X., X.R., and Guard) was moving against the  centre and right of the Fifth French Army and the Ninth French Army.    On Sept. 7 both the Fifth and Sixth French Armies were heavily engaged  on our flank. The Second and Fourth Reserve German Corps on the Ourcq  vigorously opposed the advance of the French toward that river, but did  not prevent the Sixth Army from gaining some headway, the Germans  themselves suffering serious losses. The French Fifth Army threw the  enemy back to the line of the Petit Morin River after inflicting severe  losses upon them, especially about Montceaux, which was carried at the  point of the bayonet.    The enemy retreated before our advance, covered by his Second and Ninth  and Guard Cavalry Divisions, which suffered severely.    Our cavalry acted with great vigor, especially Gen. De Lisle's brigade,  with the Ninth Lancers and Eighteenth Hussars.    On Sept. 8 the enemy continued his retreat northward, and our army was  successfully engaged during the day with strong rearguards of all arms  on the Petit Morin River, thereby materially assisting the progress of  the French armies on our right and left, against whom the enemy was  making his greatest efforts. On both sides the enemy was thrown back  with very heavy loss. The First Army Corps encountered stubborn  resistance at La Tretoire, (north of Rabais.) The enemy occupied a  strong position with infantry and guns on the northern bank of the Petit  Morin River; they were dislodged with considerable loss. Several machine  guns and many prisoners were captured, and upward of 200 German dead  were left on the ground.    [Illustration: Map 6.--Sept. 9. Forcing the passage of the Marne.  This day the German retreat degenerated into a rout, and many captures  were made.]    The forcing of the Petit Morin at this point was much assisted by the  cavalry and the First Division, which crossed higher up the stream.    Later in the day a counter-attack by the enemy was well repulsed by the  First Army Corps, a great many prisoners and some guns again falling  into our hands.    On this day (Sept. 8) the Second Army Corps encountered considerable  opposition, but drove back the enemy at all points with great loss,  making considerable captures.    The Third Army Corps also drove back considerable bodies of the enemy's  infantry and made some captures.    On Sept. 9 the First and Second Army Corps forced the passage of the  Marne and advanced some miles to the north of it. The Third Corps  encountered considerable opposition, as the bridge at La Ferte was  destroyed and the enemy held the town on the opposite bank in some  strength, and thence persistently obstructed the construction of a  bridge; so the passage was not effected until after nightfall.    During the day's pursuit the enemy suffered heavy loss in killed and  wounded, some hundreds of prisoners fell into our hands and a battery of  eight machine guns was captured by the Second Division.    On this day the Sixth French Army was heavily engaged west of the River  Ourcq. The enemy had largely increased his force opposing them; and very  heavy fighting ensued, in which the French were successful throughout.    The left of the Fifth French Army reached the neighborhood of Chateau  Thierry after the most severe fighting, having driven the enemy  completely north of the river with great loss.    The fighting of this army in the neighborhood of Montmirail was very  severe.    The advance was resumed at daybreak on the 10th up to the line of the  Ourcq, opposed by strong rearguards of all arms. The First and Second  Corps, assisted by the cavalry divisions on the right, the Third and  Fifth Cavalry Brigades on the left, drove the enemy northward. Thirteen  guns, seven machine guns, about 2,000 prisoners, and quantities of  transport fell into our hands. The enemy left many dead on the field. On  this day the French Fifth and Sixth Armies had little opposition.    As the First and Second German Armies were now in full retreat, this  evening marks the end of the battle which practically commenced on the  morning of the 6th inst.; and it is at this point in the operations that  I am concluding the present dispatch.    Although I deeply regret [Transcriber: original 'regreat'] to have had  to report heavy losses in killed and wounded throughout these  operations, I do not think they have been excessive in view of the  magnitude of the great fight, the outlines of which I have only been  able very briefly to describe, and the demoralization and loss in killed  and wounded which are known to have been caused to the enemy by the  vigor and severity of the pursuit.    In concluding this dispatch I must call your Lordship's special  attention to the fact that from Sunday, Aug. 23, up to the present date,  (Sept. 17,) from Mons back almost to the Seine, and from the Seine to  the Aisne, the army under my command has been ceaselessly engaged  without one single day's halt or rest of any kind.    Since the date to which in this dispatch I have limited my report of the  operations, a great battle on the Aisne has been proceeding. A full  report of this battle will be made in an early further dispatch.    [Illustration: Map 7--Sept. 10 (evening). End of the battle of the  Marne.

III.    *The Battle of the Aisne.*      8th October, 1914.    My Lord: I have the honor to report the operations in which the British  forces in France have been engaged since the evening of Sept. 10:    1. In the early morning of the 11th the further pursuit of the enemy was  commenced, and the three corps crossed the Ourcq practically unopposed,  the cavalry reaching the line of the Aisne River, the Third and Fifth  Brigades south of Soissons, the First, Second and the Fourth on the high  ground at Couvrelles and Cerseuil.    On the afternoon of the 12th, from the opposition encountered by the  Sixth French Army to the west of Soissons, by the Third Corps southeast  of that place, by the Second Corps south of Missy and Vailly, and  certain indications all along the line, I formed the opinion that the  enemy had, for the moment at any rate, arrested his retreat and was  preparing to dispute the passage of the Aisne with some vigor.    South of Soissons the Germans were holding Mont de Paris against the  attack of the right of the French Sixth Army when the Third Corps  reached the neighborhood of Buzancy, southeast of that place. With the  assistance of the artillery of the Third Corps the French drove them  back across the river at Soissons, where they destroyed the bridges.    The heavy artillery fire which was visible for several miles in a  westerly direction in the valley of the Aisne showed that the Sixth  French Army was meeting with strong opposition all along the line.    On this day the cavalry under Gen. Allenby reached the neighborhood of  Braine and did good work in clearing the town and the high ground beyond  it of strong hostile detachments. The Queen's Bays are particularly  mentioned by the General as having assisted greatly in the success of  this operation. They were well supported by the Third Division, which on  this night bivouacked at Brenelle, south of the river.    The Fifth Division approached Missy, but were unable to make headway.    The First Army Corps reached the neighborhood of Vauxcere without much  opposition.    In this manner the battle of the Aisne commenced.    2. The Aisne Valley runs generally east and west, and consists of a  flat-bottomed depression of width varying from half a mile to two miles,  down which the river follows a winding course to the west, at some  points near the southern slopes of the valley and at others near the  northern. The high ground both on the north and south of the river is  approximately 400 feet above the bottom of the valley, and is very  similar in character, as are both slopes of the valley itself, which are  broken into numerous rounded spurs and re-entrants. The most prominent  of the former are the Chivre spur on the right bank and Sermoise spur on  the left. Near the latter place the general plateau, on the south is  divided by a subsidiary valley of much the same character, down which  the small River Vesle flows to the main stream near Sermoise. The slopes  of the plateau overlooking the Aisne on the north and south are of  varying steepness, and are covered with numerous patches of wood, which  also stretch upward and backward over the edge on to the top of the high  ground. There are several villages and small towns dotted about in the  valley itself and along its sides,"]]]
