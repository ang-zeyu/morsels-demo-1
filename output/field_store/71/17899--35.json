When the Philosopher come home late that night the Thin  Woman was waiting up for him.    \"Woman,\" said the Philosopher, \"you ought to be in bed.\"    \"Ought I indeed?\" said the Thin Woman. \"I'd have you know that I'll go  to bed when I like and get up when I like without asking your or any one  else's permission.\"    \"That is not true,\" said the Philosopher. \"You get sleepy whether you  like it or not, and you awaken again without your permission being  asked. Like many other customs such as singing, dancing, music, and  acting, sleep has crept into popular favour as part of a religious  ceremonial. Nowhere can one go to sleep more easily than in a church.\"    \"Do you know,\" said the Thin Woman, \"that a Leprecaun came here to-day?\"    \"I do not,\" said the Philosopher, \"and notwithstanding the innumerable  centuries which have elapsed since that first sleeper (probably with  extreme difficulty) sank into his religious trance, we can to-day sleep  through a religious ceremony with an ease which would have been a source  of wealth and fame to that prehistoric worshipper and his acolytes.\"    \"Are you going to listen to what I am telling you about the Leprecaun?\"  said the Thin Woman.    \"I am not,\" said the Philosopher. \"It has been suggested that we go  to sleep at night because it is then too dark to do anything else; but  owls, who are a venerably sagacious folk, do not sleep in the night  time. Bats, also, are a very clear-minded race; they sleep in the  broadest day, and they do it in a charming manner. They clutch the  branch of a tree with their toes and hang head downwards--a position  which I consider singularly happy, for the rush of blood to the head  consequent on this inverted position should engender a drowsiness and a  certain imbecility of mind which must either sleep or explode.\"    \"Will you never be done talking?\" shouted the Thin Woman passionately.    \"I will not,\" said the Philosopher. \"In certain ways sleep is useful.  It is an excellent way of listening to an opera or seeing pictures on  a bioscope. As a medium for day-dreams I know of nothing that can equal  it. As an accomplishment it is graceful, but as a means of spending a  night it is intolerably ridiculous. If you were going to say anything,  my love, please say it now, but you should always remember to think  before you speak. A woman should be seen seldom but never heard.  Quietness is the beginning of virtue. To be silent is to be beautiful.  Stars do not make a noise. Children should always be in bed. These are  serious truths, which cannot be controverted; therefore, silence is  fitting as regards them.\"    \"Your stirabout is on the hob,\" said the Thin Woman. \"You can get it for  yourself. I would not move the breadth of my nail if you were dying of  hunger. I hope there's lumps in it. A Leprecaun from Gort na Cloca Mora  was here to-day. They'll give it to you for robbing their pot of gold.  You old thief, you! you lobeared, crock-kneed fat-eye!\"    The Thin Woman whizzed suddenly from where she stood and leaped into  bed. From beneath the blanket she turned a vivid, furious eye on her  husband. She was trying to give him rheumatism and toothache and lockjaw  all at once. If she had been satisfied to concentrate her attention on  one only of these torments she might have succeeded in afflicting her  husband according to her wish, but she was not able to do that.    \"Finality is death. Perfection is finality. Nothing is perfect. There  are lumps in it,\" said the Philosopher.        CHAPTER V    WHEN the Leprecaun came through the pine wood on the following day he  met two children at a little distance from the house. He raised his open  right hand above his head (this is both the fairy and the Gaelic form of  salutation), and would have passed on but that a thought brought him  to a halt. Sitting down before the two children he stared at them for a  long time, and they stared back at him. At last he said to the boy:    \"What is your name, a vic vig O?\"    \"Seumas Beg, sir,\" the boy replied.    \"It's a little name,\" said the Leprecaun.    \"It's what my mother calls me, sir,\" returned the boy.    \"What does your father call you,\" was the next question.    \"Seumas Roghan Maelduin O'Carbhail Mac an Droid.\"    \"It's a big name,\" said the Leprecaun, and he turned to the little girl.  \"What is your name, a cailin vig O?\"    \"Brigid Beg, sir.\"    \"And what does your father call you?\"    \"He never calls me at all, sir.\"    \"Well, Seumaseen and Breedeen, you are good little children, and I like  you very much. Health be with you until I come to see you again.\"    And then the Leprecaun went back the way he had come. As he went he made  little jumps and cracked his fingers, and sometimes he rubbed one leg  against the other.    \"That's a nice Leprecaun,\" said Seumas.    \"I like him too,\" said Brigid.    \"Listen,\" said Seumas, \"let me be the Leprecaun, and you be the two  children, and I will ask you our names.\"    So they did that.    The next day the Leprecaun came again. He sat down beside the children  and, as before, he was silent for a little time.    \"Are you not going to ask us our names, sir?\" said Seumas.    His sister smoothed out her dress shyly. \"My name, sir, is Brigid Beg,\"  said she.    \"Did you ever play Jackstones?\" said the Leprecaun.    \"No, sir,\" replied Seumas.    \"I'll teach you how to play Jackstones,\" said the Leprecaun, and he  picked up some pine cones and taught the children that game.    \"Did you ever play Ball in the Decker?\"    \"No, sir,\" said Seumas.    \"Did you ever play 'I can make a nail with my ree-roraddy-O, I can make  a nail with my ree-ro-ray'?\"    \"No, sir,\" replied Seumas.    \"It's a nice game,\" said the Leprecaun, \"and so is Capon-the-back, and  Twenty-four yards on the Billy-goat's Tail, and Towns, and Relievo, and  Leap-frog. I'll teach you all these games,\" said the Leprecaun, \"and  I'll teach you how to play Knifey, and Hole-and-taw, and Horneys and  Robbers.    \"Leap-frog is the best one to start with, so I'll teach it to you at  once. Let you bend down like this, Breedeen, and you bend down like that  a good distance away, Seumas. Now I jump over Breedeen's back, and then  I run and jump over Seumaseen's back like this, and then I run ahead  again and I bend down. Now, Breedeen, you jump over your brother, and  then you jump over me, and run a good bit on and bend down again. Now,  Seumas, it's your turn; you jump over me and then over your sister, and  then you run on and bend down again and I jump.\"    \"This is a fine game, sir,\" said Seumas.    \"It is, a vic vig,--keep in your head,\" said the Leprecaun. \"That's a  good jump, you couldn't beat that jump, Seumas.\"    \"I can jump better than Brigid already,\" replied Seumas, \"and I'll jump  as well as you do when I get more practice--keep in your head, sir.\"    Almost without noticing it they had passed through the edge of the wood,  and were playing into a rough field which was cumbered with big, grey  rocks. It was the very last field in sight, and behind it the rough,  heather-packed mountain sloped distantly away to the skyline. There was  a raggedy blackberry hedge all round the field, and there were long,  tough, haggard-looking plants growing in clumps here and there. Near  a corner of this field there was a broad, low tree, and as they played  they came near and nearer to it. The Leprecaun gave a back very close to  the tree. Seumas ran and jumped and slid down a hole at the side of the  tree. Then Brigid ran and jumped and slid down the same hole.    \"Dear me!\" said Brigid, and she flashed out of sight.    The Leprecaun cracked his fingers and rubbed one leg against the other,  and then he also dived into the hole and disappeared from view.    When the time at which the children usually went home had passed, the  Thin Woman of Inis Magrath became a little anxious. She had never known  them to be late for dinner before. There was one of the children whom  she hated; it was her own child, but as she had forgotten which of them  was hers, and as she loved one of them, she was compelled to love both  for fear of making a mistake and chastising the child for whom her heart  secretly yearned. Therefore, she was equally concerned about both of  them.    Dinner time passed and supper time arrived, but the children did not.  Again and again the Thin Woman went out through the dark pine trees and  called until she was so hoarse that she could not even hear herself when  she roared. The evening wore on to the night, and while she waited for  the Philosopher to come in she reviewed the situation. Her husband had  not come in, the children had not come in, the Leprecaun had not returned  as arranged.... A light flashed upon her. The Leprecaun had kidnapped  her children! She announced a vengeance against the Leprecauns which  would stagger humanity. While in the extreme centre of her ecstasy the  Philosopher came through the trees and entered the house.    The Thin Woman flew to him-\"Husband,\" said she, \"the Leprecauns of Gort  na Cloca Mora have kidnapped our children.\"    The Philosopher gazed at her for a moment.    \"Kidnapping,\" said he, \"has been for many centuries a favourite  occupation of fairies, gypsies, and the brigands of the East. The usual  procedure is to attach a person and hold it to ransom. If the ransom is  not paid an ear or a finger may be cut from the captive and despatched  to those interested, with the statement that an arm or a leg will follow  in a week unless suitable arrangements are entered into.\"    \"Do you understand,\" said the Thin Woman passionately, \"that it is your  own children who have been kidnapped?\"    \"I do not,\" said the Philosopher. \"This course, however, is rarely  followed by the fairy people: they do not ordinarily steal for ransom,  but for love of thieving, or from some other obscure and possibly  functional causes, and the victim is retained in their forts or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16059"],[0,"Modern Spanish Lyrics (#4)"],[1,"Lusiadas_, employed Castilian in many verses with happy  result.    These figures lead to the threshold of the seventeenth  century which opened with a tremendous literary output in  many lines. Cervantes was writing his various novels;  the romance of roguery took on new life with _Guzman de  Alfarache_ (1599); the drama, which had been developing  rather slowly and spasmodically, burst suddenly into full  flower with Lope de Vega and his innumerable followers.  The old meter of the _romance_ was adopted as a favorite  form by all sorts and conditions of poets and was turned  from its primitive epic simplicity to the utmost variety  of subjects, descriptive, lyric and satiric.    From out this flood of production--for every dramatist was  in a measure a lyric poet, and dramatists were legion--we  can select for consideration only the men most prominent  as lyrists. First in the impulse which he gave to  literature for more than a century following stands Luis  de ARGOTE Y GONGORA (1561-1627), a Cordovan                   page xxiv  who chose to be known by his mother's name. His life was  mainly that of a disappointed place-hunter. His abrupt  change of literary manner has made some say that there  were in him two poets, Gongora the Good and Gongora the  Bad. He began by writing odes in the manner of Herrera and  _romances_ and _villancicos_ which are among the clearest  and best. They did not bring their author fame, however,  and he seems deliberately to have adopted the involved  metaphoric style to which Marini gave his name in Italy.  Gongora is merely the Spanish representative of the  movement, which also produced Euphuism in England and  _preciosite_ in France. But he surpassed all previous  writers in the extreme to which he carried the method, and  his _Soledades_ and _Polifemo_ are simply unintelligible  for the inversions and strained metaphors with which they  are overloaded.    His influence was enormous. Gongorism, or _culteranismo_,  as it was called at the time, swept the minor poets  with it, and even those who fought the movement most  vigorously, like Lope and Quevedo, were not wholly free  from the contagion. The second generation of dramatists  was strongly affected. Yet there are few lyric poets worth  mentioning among Gongora's disciples for the reason that  such a pernicious system meant certain ruin to those who  lacked the master's talent. The most important names are  the Count of Villamediana (1580-1622), a satirist whose  sharp tongue caused his assassination, and Paravicino y  Arteaga (1580-1633), a court preacher.    Obviously, such an innovation could not pass without  opposition from clear-sighted men. LOPE DE VEGA  (1562-1635) attacked it whenever opportunity offered, and  his verse seldom shows signs of corruption. It                 page xxv  is impossible to consider the master-dramatist at length  here. He wrote over 300 sonnets, many excellent eclogues,  epistles, and, in more popular styles, glosses,  _letrillas, villancicos, romances_, etc. Lope more than  any other poet of his time kept his ear close to the  people, and his light poems are full of the delicious  breath of the country.    The other principal opponent of Gongorism was Francisco  GOMEZ DE QUEVEDO Y VILLEGAS (1580-1645), whose wit and  independence made him formidable. In 1631 he published  the poems of Luis de Leon and Francisco de la Torre as a  protest against the baleful mannerism in vogue. But he  himself adopted a hardly less disagreeable style, called  conceptism, which is supposed to have been invented by  Alonso de Ledesma (1552-1623). It consists in a strained  search for unusual thoughts which entails forced  paradoxes, antitheses and epigrams. This system, combined  with local allusions, double meanings and current slang,  in which Quevedo delighted, makes his poems often  extremely difficult of comprehension. His _romances de  jaques_, written in thieves' jargon, are famous in Spain.  Quevedo wrote too much and carelessly and tried to cover  too many fields, but at his best his caustic wit and  fearless vigor place him high.    There were not lacking poets who kept themselves free from  taint of _culteranismo_, though they did not join in  the fight against it. The brothers Argensola (LUPERCIO  LEONARDO DE ARGENSOLA, 1559-1613, BARTOLOME LEONARDO DE  ARGENSOLA, 1562-1631), of Aragonese birth, turned to  Horace and other classics as well as to Italy for their  inspiration. Their pure and dignified sonnets, odes and  translations rank high. Juan MARTINEZ DE JAUREGUI             page xxvi  (1583-1641) wrote a few original poems, but is known  mainly for his excellent translation of Tasso's _Aminta_.  He too succumbed to Gongorism at times. The few poems of  Francisco de RIOJA (1586?-1659) are famous for the purity  of their style and their tender melancholy tone. A little  apart is Esteban Manuel de VILLEGAS (1589-1669), an  admirer of the Argensolas, \"en versos cortos divino,  insufrible en los mayores,\" who is known for his attempts  in Latin meters and his successful imitations of Anacreon  and Catullus.    The lyrics of CALDERON (1600-1681) are to be found mostly  in his _comedias_ and _autos_. There are passages which  display great gifts in the realm of pure poetry, but  too often they are marred by the impertinent metaphors  characteristic of _culteranismo_.    His name closes the most brilliant era of Spanish letters.  The decline of literature followed close upon that of the  political power of Spain. The splendid empire of Charles  V had sunk, from causes inherent in the policies of that  over-ambitious monarch, through the somber bigotry of  Philip II, the ineptitude of Philip III, the frivolity of  Philip IV, to the imbecility of Charles II; and the death  of the last of the Hapsburg rulers in 1700 left Spain in  a deplorably enfeebled condition physically and  intellectually. The War of the Succession (1701-1714)  exhausted her internal strength still more, and the final  acknowledgment of Philip V (reigned 1701-1746) brought  hardly any blessing but that of peace. Under these  circumstances poetry could not thrive; and in truth the  eighteenth century in Spain is an age devoted more to the  discussion of the principles of literature than to the  production of it. At first the decadent remnants of          page xxvii  the _siglo de oro_ still survived, but later the  French taste, following the principles formulated by  Boileau, prevailed almost entirely. The history of Spanish  poetry in the eighteenth century is a history of the  struggle between these two forces and ends in the triumph  of the latter.    The effects of Gongorism lasted long in Spain, which, with  its innate propensity to bombast, was more fertile soil  for it than other nations. Innumerable poetasters of the  early eighteenth century enjoyed fame in their day and  some possessed talent; but the obscure and trivial style  of the age from which they could not free themselves  deprived them of any chance of enduring fame. One may  mention, as the least unworthy, Gabriel Alvarez de Toledo  (1662-1714) and Eugenio Gerardo Lobo (1679-1750).    Some one has said that the poetry of Spain, with the  exception of the _romances_ and the drama of the _siglo  de oro_, has always drawn its inspiration from some other  country. Add to the exceptions the medieval epic and the  statement would be close to the truth. First Provence  through the medium of Galicia; then Italy and with it  ancient Rome; and lastly France and England, on more than  one occasion, have molded Spanish poetry. The power of  the French classical literature, soon dominant in Europe,  could not long be stayed by the Pyrenees; and Pope,  Thomson and Young were also much admired. Philip V, a  Frenchman, did not endeavor to crush the native spirit in  his new home, but his influence could not but be felt. He  established a Spanish Academy on the model of the French  in 1714.    It was some time before the reaction, based on common  sense and confined to the intellectuals, could take deep  root, and, as was natural, it went too far and condemned  much of the _siglo de oro_ entire. The _Diario              page xxviii  de los literatos_, a journal of criticism founded in 1737,  and the _Poetica_ of Ignacio de Luzan, published in  the same year, struck the first powerful blows. Luzan  (1702-1754) followed in general the precepts of Boileau,  though he was able to praise some of the good points in  the Spanish tradition. His own poems are frigid. The  _Satira contra los malos escritores de su tiempo_ (1742)  of Jorge Pitillas (pseudonym of Jose Gerardo de Hervas, d.  1742) was an imitation of Boileau which had great effect.  Blas Antonio Nasarre (1689-1751), Agustin Montiano  (1697-1765) and Luis Jose Velazquez (1722-1772) were  critics who, unable to compose meritorious plays or  verse themselves, cut to pieces the great figures of the  preceding age.    Needless to say, the Gallicizers were vigorously opposed,  but so poor were the original productions of the defenders  of the national manner that their side was necessarily the  losing one. Vicente Garcia de la Huerta (1734-1787) was  its most vehement partisan, but he is remembered only for  a tragedy, _Raquel_.    Thus it is seen that during a century of social and  industrial depression Spain did not produce a poet worthy  of the name. The condition of the nation was sensibly  bettered under Charles III (reigned 1759-1788) who did  what was possible to reorganize the state and curb the  stifling domination of the Roman Church and its agents  the Jesuits and the Inquisition. The Benedictine Feijoo  (1675-1764) labored faithfully to inoculate Spain, far  behind the rest of Europe, with an inkling of recent  scientific discoveries. And the budding prosperity,  however deceitful it proved, was reflected in a more  promising literary generation.                                page xxix    Nicolas FERNANDEZ"]]]
