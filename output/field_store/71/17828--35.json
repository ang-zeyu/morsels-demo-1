Then he said, \"Let me in; let me in; will  you not let me in this garden?\"  9. \"No, indeed,\" said the gardener, \"I will not let you in, I  assure you; for when I let you in yesterday, you meddled  with my flowers, and pulled some of my rare fruit. I do not  choose to let a boy into my garden who meddles with the  plants.\"  10. The boy looked ashamed, and when he found that the  gardener would not let him in, he went slowly away.  11. Frank saw and felt how much happier a boy may be by  not meddling with what does not belong to him.  12. He and his mother then continued their walk in the  garden, and enjoyed the day very much. Before they left, the  gardener gave each of them some pretty flowers.    42  ECLECTIC SERIES.    LESSON XIII.      THE WOLF.  1. A boy was once taking care of some sheep, not far from  a forest. Near by was a village, and he was told to call for  help if there was any danger.  2. One day, in order to have some fun, he cried out, with  all his might, \"The wolf is coming! the wolf is coming!\"  3. The men came running with clubs and axes to destroy  the wolf. As they saw nothing they went home again, and  left John laughing in his sleeve.  4. As he had had so much fun this time, John cried out  again, the next day, \"The wolf! the wolf!\"  5. The men came again, but not so many as the first time.  Again they saw no trace of the wolf; so they shook their  heads, and went back.  6. On the third day, the wolf came in earnest. John cried in  dismay, \"Help! help!     THIRD READER.  43  the wolf! the wolf!\" But not a single man came to help him.  7. The wolf broke into the flock, and killed    a great many sheep. Among them was a beautiful lamb,  which belonged to John.  8. Then he felt very sorry that he had deceived his friends  and neighbors, and grieved over the loss of his pet lamb.    The truth itself is not believed,  From one who often has deceived.    44  ECLECTIC SERIES.    LESSON XIV.          THE LITTLE BIRD'S SONG.    1. A little bird, with feathers brown,  Sat singing on a tree;  The song was very soft and low,  But sweet as it could be.    2. The people who were passing by,  Looked up to see the bird     THIRD READER.  45    That made the sweetest melody  That ever they had heard.  3. But all the bright eyes looked in vain;  Birdie was very small,  And with his modest, dark-brown coat,  He made no show at all.  4. \"Why, father,\" little Gracie said  \"Where can the birdie be?  If  I could sing a song like that,  I'd sit where folks could see.\"  5. \"I hope my little girl will learn  A lesson from the bird,  And try to do what good she can,  Not to be seen or heard.  6. \"This birdie is content to sit  Unnoticed on the way,  And sweetly sing his Maker's praise  From dawn to close of day.  7. \"So live, my child, all through your life,  That, be it short or long,  Though others may forget your looks,  They'll not forget your song.\"    46  ECLECTIC SERIES.    LESSON XV.          HARRY AND ANNIE.  1. Harry and Annie lived a mile from town, but they went  there to school every day. It was a pleasant walk down the  lane, and through the meadow by the pond.  2. I hardly know whether they liked it better in summer or  in winter. They used to pretend that they were travelers  exploring a new country, and would scatter leaves on     THIRD READER.  47  the road that they might find their way back again.  3. When the ice was thick and firm, they went across the  pond. But their mother did not like to have them do this  unless some one was with them.  4. \"Do n't go across the pond to-day, children,\" she said,  as she kissed them and bade them good-by one morning; \"it  is beginning to thaw.\"  5. \"All right, mother,\" said Harry, not very good-  naturedly, for he was very fond of running and sliding on the  ice. When they came to the pond, the ice looked hard and  safe.  6. \"There,\" said he to his sister, \"I knew it had n't thawed  any. Mother is always afraid we shall be drowned. Come  along, we will have a good time sliding. The school bell will  not ring for an hour at least.\"  7.  \"But you promised mother,\" said Annie.  8.  \"No, I did n't. I only said 'All right,' and it is all right.\"  9. \"I did n't say anything; so I can do as I like,\" said  Annie.  10. So they stepped on the ice, and started to go across the  pond. They had not gone       48  ECLECTIC SERIES.  far before the ice gave way, and they fell into the water.  11. A man who was at work near the shore, heard the  screams of the children, and plunged into the water to save  them. Harry managed to get to the shore without any help,  but poor Annie was nearly drowned before the man could  reach her.  12. Harry went home almost frozen, and told his mother  how disobedient he had been. He remembered the lesson  learned that day as long as he lived.    LESSON XVI.      BIRD FRIENDS.  1. I once knew a man who was rich in his love for birds,  and in their love for him. He lived in the midst of a grove  full of all kinds of trees. He had no wife or children in his  home.  2. He was an old man with gray beard, blue and kind eyes,  and a voice that the     THIRD READER.  49  birds loved; and this was the way he made them his friends.  3. While he was at work with a rake on his nice walks in  the grove, the birds came    close to him to pick up the worms in the fresh earth he dug  up. At first, they kept a rod or two from him, but they soon  found he was a kind man, and would not hurt them, but liked  to have them near him.  3. 4.     50  ECLECTIC SERIES.  4. They knew this by his kind eyes and voice, which tell  what is in the heart. So, day by day their faith in his love  grew in them.  5. They came close to the rake. They would hop on top of  it to be first at the worm. They would turn up their eyes into  his when he spoke to them, as if they said, \"He is a kind  man; he loves us; we need not fear him.\"  6. All the birds of the grove were soon his fast friends.  They were on the watch for him, and would fly down from  the green tree tops to greet him with their chirp.  7. When he had no work on the walks to do with his rake  or his hoe, he took crusts of bread with him, and dropped the  crumbs on the ground. Down they would dart on his head  and feet to catch them as they fell from his hand.  8  He showed me how they loved him. He put a crust of  bread in his mouth, with one end of it out of his lips. Down  they came like bees at a flower, and flew off with it crumb  by crumb.  9. When they thought he slept too long in the morning,  they would fly in and sit     THIRD READER.  51  on the bedpost, and call him up with their chirp.  10. They went with him to church, and while he said his  prayers and sang his hymns in it, they sat in the trees, and  sang their praises to the same good God who cares for them  as he does for us.  11. Thus the love and trust of birds were a joy to him all  his life long; and such love and trust no boy or girl can fail to  win with the same kind heart, voice, and eye that he had.    Adapted from Elihu Burritt.        LESSON XVII.    WHAT THE MINUTES SAY.    1.  We are but minutes--little things!  Each one furnished with sixty wings,  With which we fly on our unseen track,  And not a minute ever comes back.    2.  We are but minutes; use us well,  For how we are used we must one day tell.  Who uses minutes, has hours to use;  Who loses minutes, whole years must lose.     52  ECLECTIC SERIES    LESSON XVIII.          THE WIDOW AND THE MERCHANT.  1. A merchant, who was very fond of music, was asked by  a poor widow to give her some assistance. Her husband, who  was a musician, had died, and left her very poor indeed.  2. The merchant saw that the widow and her daughter,  who was with her, were in great     THIRD READER.  53  distress. He looked with pity into their pale faces, and was  convinced by their conduct that their sad story was true.  3. \"How much do you want, my good woman?\" said the  merchant.  4. \"Five dollars will save us,\" said the poor widow, with  some hesitation.  5. The merchant sat down at his desk, took a piece of  paper, wrote a few lines on it, and gave it to the widow with  the words, \"Take it to the bank you see on the other side of  the street.\"  6. The grateful widow and her daughter, without stopping  to read the note, hastened to the bank. The banker at once  counted out fifty dollars instead of five, and passed them to  the widow.  7. She was amazed when she saw so much money. \"Sir,  there is a mistake here,\" she said. \"You have given me fifty  dollars, and I asked for only five.\"  8. The banker looked at the note once more, and said,  \"The check calls for fifty dollars.\"  9. \"It is a mistake--indeed it is,\" said the widow.  10. The banker then asked her to wait     54  ECLECTIC SERIES.  a few minutes, while he went to see the merchant who gave  her the note.  11. \"Yes.\" said the merchant, when he had heard the  banker's story, \"I did make a mistake. I wrote fifty instead of  five hundred. Give the poor widow five hundred dollars, for  such honesty is poorly rewarded with even that sum.\"  LESSON XIX.    THE BIRDS SET FREE.  1. A man was walking one day through a large city. On a  street corner he saw a boy with a number of small birds for  sale, in a cage.  2. He looked with sadness upon the little prisoners flying  about the cage, peeping through the wires, beating them with  their wings, and trying to get out.  3. He stood for some time looking at the birds. At last he  said to the boy, \"How much do you ask for your birds?\"     THIRD READER.  55  4. \"Fifty cents apiece, sir,\" said the boy. \"I do not mean  how much apiece,\" said the man, \"but how much for all of  them? I want to buy them all.\"  5. The boy began to count, and found they came to five  dollars. \"There is your money,\"    said the man. The boy took it, well pleased with his  morning's trade.  6.

Acton would stand no half-hearted play; he wanted the last ounce  out of his men. The fellows stared a bit at first at his deadly  earnestness, so unlike Dick's disgusted resignation at their shortcomings;  but they found the change refreshing on the whole, for they could stand a  lot of bullying from a fellow like Acton, who never seemed to make a  mistake, or to have an off-day, and who could give stones and a beating to  the best man among them. They respected his skill, and buckled to the work  in hand. In about a fortnight there was a suggestion of style about the  moving of some of the fellows up the field. Worcester backed up Acton with  whole-hearted enthusiasm, and Raven was lost in wonder at the forward  movement. This backing Acton found rather useful, for Dick and Raven were  as popular as any in St. Amory's.    Some of the fellows were inclined to turn restive after about a fortnight,  when the novelty of earnestness in football had worn off, but Acton's  demands were as inexorable as ever. Matters came to a head (probably, as I  expect, to the new captain's inward satisfaction) when his girding upset  Chalmers--about the best forward of Biffen's regenerated lot. There was to  be a match with some of the Fifth for the Saturday, and Acton had arranged  a preliminary canter the day before to test his attack. Chalmers was the  winger, but on the day he was tremendously selfish, and stuck to the ball  until he was robbed or knocked off it. Now, Acton loathed the \"alone I did  it\" type of forward, and asked Chalmers pretty acidly what his inside man  was for. This riled Chalmers considerably, for he had a large private  opinion about his own play, and he said pretty hotly, \"Mind your own  business, Acton.\"    Acton said very coolly, \"I am going to do so. Please remember, Chalmers,  this is not a one-horse show.\"    \"Seems distinctly like it, judging by the fellow who's been doing all the  talking for the last age.\"    \"Play the game, and don't be an ass.\"    \"I object to being called an ass,\" said Chalmers, in a white rage.    \"Well, mule, then,\" said Acton, cheerfully. \"Anything to oblige you,  Chalmers, bar your waltzing down the touch-line to perdition. You're not a  Bassett nor a Bell yet, you know.\"    Chalmers would dearly have liked to have struck Acton, but Worcester  looked so utterly disgusted at the whole business, that I fancy it was  Dick's eye that suggested to Chalmers his getting into his coat and  sweater. He did so, and stalked angrily off the field.    Now, Chalmers really liked the game, and did not fancy being crossed out  of the eleven, which Acton would almost certainly proceed to do; so that  night after tea, he went to Worcester's study, and boarded Dick.    \"Apologize to Acton,\" said Dick.    \"But he called me an ass!\"    \"You were one,\" said Dick, dryly. \"Acton's putting in a lot of work over  the slackest house that ever disgraced the old school, and this is how  he's treated. Ass is a mild term.\"    Chalmers went to Raven.    \"Apologize,\" said Raven.    \"He called me a mule,\" urged Chalmers, despairingly.    \"So you were. I quite expected to see the kicking begin, really. Acton's  sweating no end to screw us up to concert-pitch, and flat mutiny is his  reward. Apologize, and help us win the Fifth to-morrow.\"    So Chalmers moved reluctantly across to Acton's and made his apology.    \"Don't mention it,\" said Acton, cheerfully. \"Sorry I upset you, Chalmers,  but you elected me captain, and I do want a little success in the houses,  and how can we get it if the fellows don't combine? Say no more about it;  I was rather afraid you weren't going to come, which is the unadorned  truth.\"    This last delicate touch, which showed Chalmers that, without the apology,  his captain had meant to cut him adrift, _sans_ hesitation, and yet  contained a pretty little compliment to his footer, embarrassed Chalmers  more than a little; but Acton offered his forward tea and muffins, and  five minutes afterwards Chalmers was finding out what a nice fellow Acton  really could be. The next day Chalmers smoothed his ruffled feelings by  piling on three goals against the Fifth, who sneaked off the Acres five  goals to the bad. This was the first time for ages that Biffen's had  tasted blood, and the news of the victory staggered others besides the  victims. There was quite a flutter among the house captains, and Acton, by  the way, had no more mutinies.    \"Without haste, without rest,\" Biffen's captain started his second project  for the elevation of his house. He had noticed what none of the other  fellows would condescend to see, that two of the despised niggers of  Biffen's were rather neat on the bars. He spent a quarter of an hour one  evening quietly watching the two in the gym, and he went away thoughtful.  Singh Ram and Mehtah thereupon each received a polite note, and \"could  they call about seven in Acton's study?\" They came, and Acton talked to  them briefly but to the point. When they sought their quarters again they  were beaming, and \"Singed\" Ram carried a fat book of German physical  exercises under his arm.    \"Am I not coming out strong?\" said Acton, laughing to himself, \"when I set  the very niggers a-struggling for the greater glory of Biffen's--or is it  Acton's? Then, there's that exhibition, which we must try to get for this  double-superlative house. Raven must beat that Sixth prig Hodgson, the  very bright particular star of Corker's. Would two hours' classics, on  alternate nights, meet his case? He shall have 'em, bless him! He shall  know what crops Horace grew on his little farm, and all the other rot  which gains Perry Exhibitions. Hodgson may strong coffee and wet towel  _per noctem_; but, with John Acton as coach, Raven shall upset the  apple-cart of Theodore Hodgson. There's Todd in for the Perry, too, I  hear. Hodgson may be worth powder and shot, but I'm hanged if Raven need  fear Cotton's jackal! If only half of my plans come off, still that will  put Philip Bourne in a tighter corner than he's ever been in before.  Therefore--_en avant!_\"          CHAPTER V    COTTON AND HIS JACKAL      As I said before, the victory of the despised Biffenites over the Fifth  Form eleven--a moderate one, it is true--caused quite a little breeze of  surprise to circulate around the other houses, which had by process of  time come to regard that slack house as hopeless in the fields or in the  schools. Over all the tea-tables that afternoon the news was commented on  with full details; how Chalmers had gained in deadliness just as much as  he had lost in selfishness, and how Raven and Worcester had worked like  horses, and mown down the opposition--\"Fifth Form opposition!\" said the  fags, with a lift of the eyebrows--like grass, and as for Biffen's new  captain, well, if there was one player who could hold a candle to him it  must be Phil Bourne, and he only.    In the Rev. E. Taylor's house, Cotton senior, who answered to the name of  \"Jim\" among his familiars, and was \"Bully Cotton\" to his enemies--every  Amorian below the Fifth, and a good sprinkling elsewhere--and Augustus  Vernon Robert Todd, who was \"Gus\" to every one, sat at tea together in  Todd's room. Cotton had been one of the slain that afternoon on the Acres,  and was still in his footer clothes, plus a sweater, which almost came up  to his ears. There was a bright fire in the grate, and though Todd's room  was not decorative compared with most of the other fellows' dens, yet it  was cheerful enough. Cotton had come back from the match hungry and a  trifle bruised from a smart upset, only to find his own fire out, and  preparations for tea invisible. Having uttered dire threats against his  absent, erring fag, he moved into his friend's room, and the two clubbed  together their resources, and the result was a square meal, towards which  Cotton contributed something like 19/20, A.V.R. Todd's share being limited  to the kettle, the water, and the fire. When Cotton had satisfied his  footer appetite, he turned down his stocking and proceeded vigorously to  anoint with embrocation his damaged leg, the pungent scent of the liniment  being almost ornamental in its strength.    \"How did you get that, Jim?\" said Gus, surveying the brawny limb with  interest.    \"Acton brought me down like a house, my boy.\"    \"Fair?\"    \"Oh yes; but you've got to go down if he catches you in his swing.\"    \"You fellows must have played beautifully to let Biffen's mob maul you to  that extent.\"    \"Gus, my boy, instead of frowsing up here all the afternoon with your  books, you should have been on the touch-line watching those Biffenites at  their new tricks. Your opinion then would have a little avoirdupois. As it  is, you Perry Exhibit, it is worth exactly nothing.\"    \"You're deucedly classical to-night, Jim.\"    \"Oh, I'm sick of this forsaken match and all the compliments we've had  over it. I'm going now to have a tub, and then we'll get that Latin paper  through, and, thirdly, I'll have the chessmen out.\"    \"Sorry, I can't, Jim,\" said Todd, discontentedly. \"There is that beastly  Perry Scholarship--I must really do something for that!\"    \"Thomas Rot, Esq.!\" said Cotton. \"Haven't you been a-cramming and  a-guzzling for that all this afternoon? You've a duty towards your chums,  Toddy, so I tell you.\"    \"That's all very well, Jim, for you, who are going to break some crammer's  heart, and then crawl into the Army through the Militia, but my pater  wants me to do something in the Perry, I tell you.\"    \"Chess!\" said Cotton, disregarding Todd's bleat, and then, with a sly  smile, he added, \"Shilling a game, Gus, and you know you always pull off  the odd one.\"    \"All right,\" said Todd, swallowing the bait with forlorn eagerness; \"I'll  have the board set out if you must come in.\"    \"Oh, I must!\" said"]]]
