Over the lowest  earth, the seventh, called Erez, lie in succession the abyss, the  Tohu, the Bohu, a sea, and waters.[23] Then the sixth[24] earth  is reached, the Adamah, the scene of the magnificence of God. In  the same way the Adamah is separated from the fifth earth, the  Arka, which contains Gehenna, and Sha'are Mawet, and Sha'are  Zalmawet, and Beer Shahat, and Tit ha-Yawen, and Abaddon, and  Sheol,[25] and there the souls of the wicked are guarded by the  Angels of Destruction. In the same way Arka is followed by  Harabah, the dry, the place of brooks and streams in spite of its  name, as the next, called Yabbashah, the mainland, contains the  rivers and the springs. Tebel, the second earth, is the first  mainland inhabited by living creatures, three hundred and  sixty-five species,[26] all essentially different from those of  our own earth. Some have human heads set on the body of a lion,  or a serpent, or an ox; others have human bodies topped by the  head of one of these animals. Besides, Tebel is inhabited by  human beings with two heads and four hands and feet, in fact with  all their organs doubled excepting only the trunk.[27] It happens  sometimes that the parts of these double persons quarrel with  each other, especially while eating and drinking, when each  claims the best and largest portions for himself. This species of  mankind is distinguished for great piety, another difference  between it and the inhabitants of our earth.    Our own earth is called Heled, and, like the others, it is  separated from the Tebel by an abyss, the Tohu, the Bohu, a sea,  and waters.    Thus one earth rises above the other, from the first to the  seventh, and over the seventh earth the heavens are vaulted, from  the first to the seventh, the last of them attached to the arm of  God. The seven heavens form a unity, the seven kinds of earth  form a unity, and the heavens and the earth together also form a  unity.[28]    When God made our present heavens and our present earth, \"the new  heavens and the new earth\"[29] were also brought forth, yea, and  the hundred and ninety-six thousand worlds which God created unto  His Own glory.[30]    It takes five hundred years to walk from the earth to the  heavens, and from one end of a heaven to the other, and also from  one heaven to the next,[31] and it takes the same length of time  to travel from the east to the west, or from the south to the  north.[32] Of all this vast world only one-third is inhabited,  the other two-thirds being equally divided between water and  waste desert land.    Beyond the inhabited parts to the east is Paradise[33] with its  seven divisions, each assigned to the pious of a certain degree.  The ocean is situated to the west, and it is dotted with islands  upon islands, inhabited by many different peoples. Beyond it, in  turn, are the boundless steppes full of serpents and scorpions,  and destitute of every sort of vegetation, whether herbs or  trees. To the north are the supplies of hell-fire, of snow, hail,  smoke, ice, darkness, and windstorms, and in that vicinity  sojourn all sorts of devils, demons, and malign spirits. Their  dwelling-place is a great stretch of land, it would take five  hundred years to traverse it. Beyond lies hell. To the south is  the chamber containing reserves of fire, the cave of smoke, and  the forge of blasts and hurricanes.[34] Thus it comes that the  wind blowing from the south brings heat and sultriness to the  earth. Were it not for the angel Ben Nez, the Winged, who keeps  the south wind back with his pinions, the world would be  consumed.[35] Besides, the fury of its blast is tempered by the  north wind, which always appears as moderator, whatever other  wind may be blowing.[36]    In the east, the west, and the south, heaven and earth touch each  other, but the north God left unfinished, that any man who  announced himself as a god might be set the task of supplying the  deficiency, and stand convicted as a pretender.[37]    The construction of the earth was begun at the centre, with the  foundation stone of the Temple, the Eben Shetiyah,[38] for the  Holy Land is at the central point of the surface of the earth,  Jerusalem is at the central point of Palestine, and the Temple is  situated at the centre of the Holy City. In the sanctuary itself  the Hekal is the centre, and the holy Ark occupies the centre of  the Hekal, built on the foundation stone, which thus is at the  centre of the earth.[39] Thence issued the first ray of light,  piercing to the Holy Land, and from there illuminating the whole  earth.[40] The creation of the world, however, could not take  place until God had banished the ruler of the dark.[41] \"Retire,\"  God said to him, \"for I desire to create the world by means of  light.\" Only after the light had been fashioned, darkness arose,  the light ruling in the sky, the darkness on the earth.[42] The  power of God displayed itself not only in the creation of the  world of things, but equally in the limitations which He imposed  upon each. The heavens and the earth stretched themselves out in  length and breadth as though they aspired to infinitude, and it  required the word of God to call a halt to their  encroachments.[43]      THE SECOND DAY    On the second day God brought forth four creations, the  firmament, hell, fire, and the angels.[44] The firmament is not  the same as the heavens of the first day. It is the crystal  stretched forth over the heads of the Hayyot, from which the  heavens derive their light, as the earth derives its light from  the sun. This firmament saves the earth from being engulfed by  the waters of the heavens; it forms the partition between the  waters above and the waters below.[45] It was made to crystallize  into the solid it is by the heavenly fire, which broke its  bounds, and condensed the surface of the firmament. Thus fire  made a division between the celestial and the terrestrial at the  time of creation, as it did at the revelation on Mount Sinai.[46]  The firmament is not more than three fingers thick,[47]  nevertheless it divides two such heavy bodies as the waters  below, which are the foundations for the nether world, and the  waters above, which are the foundations for the seven heavens,  the Divine Throne, and the abode of the angels.[48]    The separation of the waters into upper and lower waters was the  only act of the sort done by God in connection with the work of  creation.[49] All other acts were unifying. It therefore caused  some difficulties. When God commanded, \"Let the waters be  gathered together, unto one place, and let the dry land appear,\"  certain parts refused to obey. They embraced each other all the  more closely. In His wrath at the waters, God determined to let  the whole of creation resolve itself into chaos again. He  summoned the Angel of the Face, and ordered him to destroy the  world. The angel opened his eyes wide, and scorching fires and  thick clouds rolled forth from them, while he cried out, \"He who  divides the Red Sea in sunder!\"--and the rebellious waters stood.  The all, however, was still in danger of destruction. Then began  the singer of God's praises: \"O Lord of the world, in days to  come Thy creatures will sing praises without end to Thee, they  will bless Thee boundlessly, and they will glorify Thee without  measure. Thou wilt set Abraham apart from all mankind as Thine  own; one of his sons Thou wilt call 'My first-born'; and his  descendants will take the yoke of Thy kingdom upon themselves. In  holiness and purity Thou wilt bestow Thy Torah upon them, with  the words, 'I am the Lord your God,' whereunto they will make  answer, 'All that God hath spoken we will do.' And now I beseech  Thee, have pity upon Thy world, destroy it not, for if Thou  destroyest it, who will fulfil Thy will?\" God was pacified; He  withdrew the command ordaining the destruction of the world, but  the waters He put under the mountains, to remain there  forever.[50] The objection of the lower waters to division and  Separation[51] was not their only reason for rebelling. The  waters had been the first to give praise to God, and when their  separation into upper and lower was decreed, the waters above  rejoiced, saying, \"Blessed are we who are privileged to abide  near our Creator and near His Holy Throne.\" Jubilating thus, they  flew upward, and uttered song and praise to the Creator of the  world. Sadness fell upon the waters below. They lamented: \"Woe  unto us, we have not been found worthy to dwell in the presence  of God, and praise Him together with our companions.\" Therefore  they attempted to rise upward, until God repulsed them, and  pressed them under the earth.[52] Yet they were not left  unrewarded for their loyalty. Whenever the waters above desire to  give praise to God, they must first seek permission from the  waters below.[53]    The second day of creation was an untoward day in more than the  one respect that it introduced a breach where before there had  been nothing but unity; for it was the day that saw also the  creation of hell. Therefore God could not say of this day as of  the others, that He \"saw that it was good.\" A division may be  necessary, but it cannot be called good, and hell surely does not  deserve the attribute of good.[54] Hell[55] has seven  divisions,[36] one beneath the other. They are called Sheol,  Abaddon, Beer Shahat, Tit ha-Yawen, Sha'are Mawet, Sha'are  Zalmawet: and Gehenna. It requires three hundred years to  traverse the height, or the width, or the depth of each division,  and it would take six thousand three hundred[37] years to go over  a tract of land equal in extent to the seven divisions.[38]    Each of the seven divisions in turn has seven subdivisions, and  in each compartment there are seven rivers of fire and seven of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1494"],[0,"The Legends of the Jews â€” Volume 2 (#4)"],[1,"with four  pairs of shoes, and Joseph kept his garment, the same in  which he was arrayed when he arrived in Egypt and was  sold to Potiphar, the same in which he was locked up in  prison and appeared before Pharaoh, and the same he wore  when he was ruler over Egypt.[52]    As an atonement for the twenty pieces of silver taken by  his brethren in exchange for Joseph, God commanded that  every first-born son shall be redeemed by the priest with an  equal amount, and, also, every Israelite must pay annually  to the sanctuary as much as fell to each of the brethren as  his share of the price.[53]    The brethren of Joseph bought shoes for the money, for  they said: \"We will not eat it, because it is the price for  the blood of our brother, but we will tread upon him, for  that he spake, he would have dominion over us, and we will  see what will become of his dreams.\" And for this reason  the ordinance has been commanded, that he who refuseth to  raise up a name in Israel unto his brother that hath died  without having a son, shall have his shoe loosed from off his  foot, and his face shall be spat upon. Joseph's brethren refused  to do aught to preserve his life, and therefore the Lord  loosed their shoes from off their feet, for, when they went  down to Egypt, the slaves of Joseph took their shoes off  their feet as they entered the gates, and they prostrated  themselves before Joseph as before a Pharaoh, and, as they  lay prostrate, they were spat upon, and put to shame before  the Egyptians.[54]    The Midianites pursued their journey to Gilead, but they  soon regretted the purchase they had made. They feared  that Joseph had been stolen in the land of the Hebrews,  though sold to them as a slave, and if his kinsmen should  find him with them, death would be inflicted upon them for  the abduction of a free man. The high-handed manner of  the sons of Jacob confirmed their suspicion, that they might  be capable of man theft. Their wicked deed would explain,  too, why they had accepted so small a sum in exchange for  Joseph. While discussing these points, they saw, coming  their way, the travelling company of Ishmaelites that had  been observed earlier by the sons of Jacob, and they determined  to dispose of Joseph to them, that they might at least  not lose the price they had paid, and might escape the danger  at the same time of being made captives for the crime of  kidnapping a man. And the Ishmaelites bought Joseph from  the Midianites, and they paid the same price as his former  owners had given for him.[55]      JOSEPH'S THREE MASTERS    As a rule the only merchandise with which the Ishmaelites  loaded their camels was pitch and the skins of beasts. By  a providential dispensation they carried bags of perfumery  this time, instead of their usual ill-smelling freight, that  sweet fragrance might be wafted to Joseph on his journey  to Egypt.[56] These aromatic substances were well suited to  Joseph, whose body emitted a pleasant smell, so agreeable  and pervasive that the road along which he travelled was  redolent thereof, and on his arrival in Egypt the perfume  from his body spread over the whole land, and the royal  princesses, following the sweet scent to trace its source,  reached the place in which Joseph was.[57] Even after his  death the same fragrance was spread abroad by his bones,  enabling Moses to distinguish Joseph's remains from all  others, and keep the oath of the children of Israel, to inter  them in the Holy Land.[58]    When Joseph learned that the Ishmaelites were carrying  him to Egypt, he began to weep bitterly at the thought of  being removed so far from Canaan and from his father.  One of the Ishmaelites noticed Joseph's weeping and crying,  and thinking that he found riding uncomfortable, he lifted  him from the back of the camel, and permitted him to  walk on foot. But Joseph continued to weep and sob,  crying incessantly, \"O father, father!\" Another one of the  caravan, tired of his lamentations, beat him, causing only  the more tears and wails, until the youth, exhausted by his  grief, was unable to move on. Now all the Ishmaelites in  the company dealt out blows to him. They treated him with  relentless cruelty, and tried to silence him by threats. God  saw Joseph's distress, and He sent darkness and terror upon  the Ishmaelites, and their hands grew rigid when they  raised them to inflict a blow. Astonished, they asked themselves  why God did thus unto them upon the road. They  did not know that it was for the sake of Joseph.    The journey was continued until they came to Ephrath,  the place of Rachel's sepulchre. Joseph hastened to his  mother's grave, and throwing himself across it, he groaned  and cried, saying: \"O mother, mother, that didst bear me,  arise, come forth and see how thy son hath been sold into  slavery, with none to take pity upon him. Arise, see thy  son, and weep with me over my misfortune, and observe the  heartlessness of my brethren. Awake, O mother, rouse thyself  from thy sleep, rise up and prepare for the conflict with  my brethren, who stripped me even of my shirt, and sold me  as a slave to merchantmen, who in turn sold me to others,  and without mercy they tore me away from my father.  Arise, accuse my brethren before God, and see whom He  will justify in the judgment, and whom He will find guilty.  Arise, O mother, awake from thy sleep, see how my father  is with me in his soul and in his spirit, and comfort him and  ease his heavy heart.\"    Joseph wept and cried upon the grave of his mother, until,  weary from grief, he lay immovable as a stone. Then  he heard a voice heavy with tears speak to him from  the depths, saying: \"My son Joseph, my son, I heard thy  complaints and thy groans, I saw thy tears, and I knew thy  misery, my son. I am grieved for thy sake, and thy affliction  is added to the burden of my affliction. But, my son  Joseph, put thy trust in God, and wait upon Him. Fear not,  for the Lord is with thee, and He will deliver thee from all  evil. Go down into Egypt with thy masters, my son; fear  naught, for the Lord is with thee, O my son.\" This and  much more like unto it did the voice utter, and then it was  silent. Joseph listened in great amazement at first, and then  he broke out in renewed tears. Angered thereby, one of  the Ishmaelites drove him from his mother's grave with  kicks and curses. Then Joseph entreated his masters to take  him back to his father, who would give them great riches as  a reward. But they said, \"Why, thou art a slave! How  canst thou know where thy father is? If thou hadst had a  free man as father, thou wouldst not have been sold twice  for a petty sum.\" And then their fury against him increased,  they beat him and maltreated him, and he wept  bitter tears.    Now God looked upon the distress of Joseph, and He sent  darkness to enshroud the land once more. A storm raged,  the lightning flashed, and from the thunderbolts the whole  earth trembled, and the Ishmaelites lost their way in their  terror. The beasts and the camels stood still, and, beat them  as their drivers would, they refused to budge from the spot,  but crouched down upon the ground. Then the Ishmaelites  spake to one another, and said: \"Why hath God brought  this upon us? What are our sins, what our trespasses, that  such things befall us?\" One of them said to the others:  \"Peradventure this hath come upon us by reason of the sin  which we have committed against this slave. Let us beg him  earnestly to grant us forgiveness, and if then God will take  pity, and let these storms pass away from us, we shall know  that we suffered harm on account of the injury we inflicted  upon this slave.\"    The Ishmaelites did according to these words, and they  said unto Joseph: \"We have sinned against God and  against thee. Pray to thy God, and entreat Him to take  this death plague from us, for we acknowledge that we have  sinned against Him.\" Joseph fulfilled their wish, and God  hearkened to his petition, and the storm was assuaged. All  around became calm, the beasts arose from their recumbent  position, and the caravan could proceed upon its way. Now  the Ishmaelites saw plainly that all their trouble had come  upon them for the sake of Joseph, and they spoke one to  another, saying: \"We know now that all this evil hath happened  to us on account of this poor fellow, and wherefore  should we bring death upon ourselves by our own doings?  Let us take counsel together, what is to be done with the  slave.\" One of them advised that Joseph's wish be fulfilled,  and he be taken back to his father. Then they would be  sure of receiving the money they had paid out for him.  This plan was rejected, because they had accomplished a  great part of their journey, and they were not inclined to  retrace their steps. They therefore resolved upon carrying  Joseph to Egypt and selling him there. They would rid  themselves of him in this way, and also receive a great price  for him.    They continued their journey as far as the borders of  Egypt, and there they met four men, descendants of Medan,  the son of Abraham, and to these they sold Joseph for  five shekels. The two companies, the Ishmaelites and the  Medanites, arrived in Egypt upon the same day. The latter,  hearing that Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain of  the guard, was seeking a good slave, repaired to him at once,  to try to dispose of Joseph to him. Potiphar was willing to  pay as much as four hundred pieces of silver, for, high as  the price was, it did not seem too great for a slave that  pleased him as much as Joseph. However, he made a  condition. He said to the Medanites: \"I will pay you the  price demanded, but you must bring me the person that  sold the slave to you, that I may be in a position to find out  all about him, for the youth seems to me to be neither a  slave nor the son of a slave. He appears to be of noble  blood. I must convince myself that he was not"]]]
