If you'd been in reach about that  time, she'd just about clawed your eyes out, Andy Green. Oh me, oh  my!\" Sandy slapped his thigh and had another spasm.    Sounds indicated that the wave of recrimination was rolling nearer.  Andy turned to find himself within arm's length of Uncle Pete.    \"Maybe this is your idea of a practical joke, Green,\" he said to Andy.  \"But anyway, it will cost you your job. I ought to charge you up with  the time my outfit has spent gallivanting around the country on the  strength of your wild yarn. The quicker you hit the trail, the better  it will suit me. By the way, what's your first name?\" He asked,  pulling out a check-book.    \"Andy,\" answered the unrepentant one.    \"Andy,\" Uncle Peter paused with a fountain pen between his fingers. He  looked Andy up and down, and the frown left his face. He proceeded to  write out the check, and when it was done he handed it over with a  pleased smile.    \"What did you do it for, Green?\" he queried in a friendlier tone.    \"Self-defence,\" Andy told him laconically, and turned away.    Half an hour later, Andy and Pink trailed out of the coulee that  sheltered the Rocking R. When they were out and away from the fence,  and Pink's horses, knowing instinctively that they were homeward  bound, were jogging straight west without need of guidance, Andy felt  in his pocket for cigarette material. His fingers came in contact with  the check Uncle Peter had given him, and he drew it forth and looked  it over again.    \"Well, by gracious!\" he said to himself. \"Uncle Peter thinks we're  even, I guess.\"    He handed the check to Pink and rolled his cigarette; and Pink, after  one comprehending look at the slip of paper, doubled up over his  saddle-horn and shouted with glee--for the check was written: \"Pay to  the order of Ananias Green.\"    \"And I've got to sign myself a liar, or I don't collect no money,\"  sighed Andy. \"That's what I call tough luck, by gracious!\"           *       *       *       *       *          BLINK      The range-land was at its unpicturesque worst. For two days the wind  had raged and ranted over the hilltops, and whooped up the long  coulees, so that tears stood in the eyes of the Happy Family when they  faced it; impersonal tears blown into being by the very force of the  wind. Also, when they faced it they rode with bodies aslant over their  saddle-horns and hats pulled low over their streaming eyes, and with  coats fastened jealously close. If there were buttons enough, well and  good; if not, a strap cinched tightly about the middle was considered  pretty lucky and not to be despised. Though it was early September,  \"sour-dough\" coats were much in evidence, for the wind had a chill way  of searching to the very marrow--and even a good, sheepskin-lined  \"sour-dough\" was not always protection sufficient.    When the third day dawned bleakly, literally blown piecemeal from out  darkness as bleak, the Happy Family rose shiveringly and with sombre  disapproval of whatever met their blood-shot eyes; dressed hurriedly  in the chill of flapping tent and went out to stagger drunkenly over  to where Patsy, in the mess-tent, was trying vainly to keep the  biscuits from becoming dust-sprinkled, and sundry pans and tins from  taking jingling little excursions on their own account. Over the brow  of the next ridge straggled the cavvy, tails and manes whipping in the  gale, the nighthawk swearing so that his voice came booming down to  camp. Truly, the day opened inauspiciously enough for almost any dire  ending.    As further evidence, saddling horses for circle resolved itself, as  Weary remarked at the top of his voice to Pink, at his elbow, into \"a  free-for-all broncho busting tournament.\" For horses have nerves, and  nothing so rasps the nerves of man or beast as a wind that never stops  blowing; which means swaying ropes and popping saddle leather, and  coat-tails flapping like wet sheets on a clothes line. Horses do not  like these things, and they are prone to eloquent manifestations of  their disapproval.    Over by the bed-wagon, a man they called Blink, for want of a better  name, was fighting his big sorrel silently, with that dogged  determination which may easily grow malevolent. The sorrel was at best  a high-tempered, nervous beast, and what with the wind and the  flapping of everything in sight, and the pitching of half-a-dozen  horses around him, he was nearly crazed with fear in the abstract.    Blink was trying to bridle him, and he was not saying a word--which,  in the general uproar, was strange. But Blink seldom did say anything.  He was one of the aliens who had drifted into the Flying U outfit that  spring, looking for work. Chip had taken him on, and he had stayed. He  could ride anything in his string, and he was always just where he was  wanted. He never went to town when the others clattered off for a few  hours' celebration more or less mild, he never took part in any of the  camp fun, and he never offended any man. If any offended him they did  not know it unless they were observant; if they were, they would see  his pale lashes wink fast for a minute, and they might read aright the  sign and refrain from further banter. So Blink, though he was counted  a good man on roundup, was left pretty much alone when in camp.    Andy Green, well and none too favorably known down Rocking R way, and  lately adopted into the Happy Family on the recommendation of Pink and  his own pleasing personality, looped the latigo into the holder, gave  his own dancing steed a slap of the don't-try-to-run-any-whizzers-on-me  variety, and went over to help out Blink.    Blink eyed his approach with much the same expression with which he  eyed the horse. \"I never hollered for assistance,\" he remarked  grudgingly when Andy was at his elbow. \"When I can't handle any of the  skates in my string, I'll quit riding and take to sheep-herding.\"  Whereupon he turned his back as squarely as he might upon Andy and  made another stealthy grab for the sorrel's ears. (There is such a  thing in the range-land as jealousy among riders, and the fame of Andy  Green had gone afar.)    \"All right. Just as you say, and not as I care a darn,\" Andy retorted,  and went back to where his own mount stood tail to the wind. He did  not in the least mind the rebuff; he really felt all the indifference  his manner portrayed--perhaps even more. He had offered help where  help was needed, and that ended it for him. It never occurred to him  that Blink might feel jealous over Andy's hard-earned reputation as a  \"tamer of wild ones,\" or mistake his good nature for patronage.    Five minutes later, when Chip looked around comprehensively at the lot  of them in various degrees of readiness; saw that Blink was still  fighting silently for mastery of the sorrel and told Andy to go over  and help him get saddled, Andy said nothing of having had his services  refused, but went. This time, Blink also said nothing, but accepted in  ungracious surrender the assistance thus thrust upon him. For on the  range-land, unless one is in a mind to roll his bed and ride away, one  does not question when the leader commands. Andy's attitude was still  that of indifference; he really thought very little about Blink or his  opinions, and the rapid blinking of the pale lashes was quite lost  upon him.    They rode, eighteen ill-natured, uncomfortable cowboys, tumultuously  away from the camp, where canvas bulged and swayed, and loose corners  cracked like pistol shots, over the hill where even the short, prairie  grass crouched and flattened itself against the sod; where stray  pebbles, loosened by the ungentle tread of pitching hoofs, skidded  twice as far as in calm weather. The gray sky bent threateningly above  them, wind-torn into flying scud but never showing a hint of blue.  Later there might be rain, sleet, snow--or sunshine, as nature might  whimsically direct; but for the present she seemed content with only  the chill wind that blew the very heart out of a man.    Whenever Chip pulled up to turn off a couple of riders that they might  search a bit of rough country, his voice was sharp with the general  discomfort. When men rode away at his command, it was with brows drawn  together and vengeful heels digging the short-ribs of horses in quite  as unlovely a mood as themselves.    Out at the end of the \"circle,\" Chip divided the remainder of his men  into two groups for the homeward drive. One group he himself led. The  other owned Weary as temporary commander and galloped off to the left,  skirting close to the foothills of the Bear Paws. In that group rode  Pink and Happy Jack, Slim, Andy Green and Blink the silent.    \"I betche we get a blizzard out uh this,\" gloomed Happy Jack, pulling  his coat collar up another fraction of an inch. \"And the way Chip's  headed us, we got to cross that big flat going back in the thick of  it; chances is, we'll git lost.\"    No one made reply to this; it seemed scarcely worth while. Every man  of them rode humped away from the wind, his head drawn down as close  to his shoulders as might be. Conversation under those conditions was  not likely to become brisk.    \"A fellow that'll punch cows for a living,\" Happy Jack asserted  venomously after a minute, \"had ought to be shut up somewheres. He  sure ain't responsible. I betche next summer don't see me at it.\"    \"Aw, shut up. We know you're feeble-minded, without you blatting it by  the hour,\" snapped Pink, showing never a dimple.    Happy Jack tugged again at his collar and made remarks, to which no  one paid the slightest attention. They rode in amongst the hills and  narrow ridges dividing \"draws\" as narrow, where range cattle would  seek shelter from the cutting blast that raked the open."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13678"],[0,"Chapters on Jewish Literature (#4)"],[1,"with  a _tendency_ to glorify his people and his religion. But they are in the  main trustworthy, and are, indeed, one of the chief sources of  information for the history of the Jews in post-Biblical times. His  style is clear and attractive, and his power of grasping the events of  long periods is comparable with that of Polybius. He was no mere  chronicler; he possessed some faculty for explaining as well as  recording facts and some real insight into the meaning of events passing  under his own eyes.    He wrote for the most part in Greek, both because that language was  familiar to many cultured Jews of his day, and because his histories  thereby became accessible to the world of non-Jewish readers. Sometimes  he used both Aramaic and Greek. For instance, he produced his \"Jewish  War\" first in the one, subsequently in the other of these languages. The  Aramaic version has been lost, but the Greek has survived. His style is  often eloquent, especially in his book \"Against Apion.\" This was an  historical and philosophical justification of Judaism. At the close of  this work Josephus says: \"And so I make bold to say that we are become  the teachers of other men in the greatest number of things, and those  the most excellent.\" Josephus, like the Jewish Hellenists of an earlier  date, saw in Judaism a universal religion, which ought to be shared by  all the peoples of the earth. Judaism was to Josephus, as to Philo, not  a contrast or antithesis to Greek culture, but the perfection and  culmination of culture.    The most curious efforts to propagate Judaism were, however, those which  were clothed in a Sibylline disguise. In heathen antiquity, the Sibyl  was an inspired prophetess whose mysterious oracles concerned the  destinies of cities and nations. These oracles enjoyed high esteem among  the cultivated Greeks, and, in the second century B.C.E., some  Alexandrian Jews made use of them to recommend Judaism to the heathen  world. In the Jewish Sibylline books the religion of Israel is presented  as a hope and a threat; a menace to those who refuse to follow the  better life, a promise of salvation to those who repent. About the year  80 C.E., a book of this kind was composed. It is what is known as the  Fourth Book of the Sibylline Oracles. The language is Greek, the form  hexameter verse. In this poem, the Sibyl, in the guise of a prophetess,  tells of the doom of those who resist the will of the one true God,  praises the God of Israel, and holds out a beautiful prospect to the  faithful.    The book opens with an invocation:        Hear, people of proud Asia, Europe, too,      How many things by great, loud-sounding mouth,      All true and of my own, I prophesy.      No oracle of false Apollo this,      Whom vain men call a god, tho' he deceived;      But of the mighty God, whom human hands      Shaped not like speechless idols cut in stone.    The Sibyl speaks of the true God, to love whom brings blessing. The  ungodly triumph for a while, as Assyria, Media, Phrygia, Greece, and  Egypt had triumphed. Jerusalem will fall, and the Temple perish in  flames, but retribution will follow, the earth will be desolated by the  divine wrath, the race of men and cities and rivers will be reduced to  smoky dust, unless moral amendment comes betimes. Then the Sibyl's note  changes into a prophecy of Messianic judgment and bliss, and she ends  with a comforting message:        But when all things become an ashy pile,      God will put out the fire unspeakable      Which he once kindled, and the bones and ashes      Of men will God himself again transform,      And raise up mortals as they were before.      And then will be the judgment, God himself      Will sit as judge, and judge the world again.      As many as committed impious sins      Shall Stygian Gehenna's depths conceal      'Neath molten earth and dismal Tartarus.        But the pious shall again live on the earth,      And God will give them spirit, life, and means      Of nourishment, and all shall see themselves,      Beholding the sun's sweet and cheerful light.      O happiest men who at that time shall live!    The Jews found some consolation for present sorrows in the thought of  past deliverances. The short historical record known as the \"Scroll of  Fasting\" (_Megillath Taanith_) was perhaps begun before the destruction  of the Temple, but was completed after the death of Trajan in 118. This  scroll contained thirty-five brief paragraphs written in Aramaic. The  compilation, which is of great historical value, follows the order of  the Jewish Calendar, beginning with the month Nisan and ending with  Adar. The entries in the list relate to the days on which it was held  unlawful to fast, and many of these days were anniversaries of national  victories. The Megillath Taanith contains no jubilations over these  triumphs, but is a sober record of facts. It is a precious survival of  the historical works compiled by the Jews before their dispersion from  Palestine. Such works differ from those of Josephus and the Sibyl in  their motive. They were not designed to win foreign admiration for  Judaism, but to provide an accurate record for home use and inspire the  Jews with hope amid the threatening prospects of life.

CHAPTER III    THE TALMUD         The Amoraim compile the Palestinian Talmud and the Babylonian       Talmud.--Representative Amoraim:         I (220-280) Palestine--Jochanan, Simon, Joshua, Simlai;            Babylonia--Rab and Samuel.        II (280-320) Palestine--Ami, Assi, Abbahu, Chiya;            Babylonia--Huna and Zeira.       III (320-380) Babylonia--Rabba, Abayi, Rava.        IV (380-430) Babylonia--Ashi (first compilation of the            Babylonian Talmud).         V and VI (430-500) Babylonia--Rabina (completion of the            Babylonian Talmud).      The _Talmud_, or _Gemara_ (\"Doctrine,\" or \"Completion\"), was a natural  development of the Mishnah. The Talmud contains, indeed, many elements  as old as the Mishnah, some even older. But, considered as a whole, the  Talmud is a commentary on the work of the Tannaim. It is written, not in  Hebrew, as the Mishnah is, but in a popular Aramaic. There are two  distinct works to which the title Talmud is applied; the one is the  Jerusalem Talmud (completed about the year 370 C.E.), the other the  Babylonian (completed a century later). At first, as we have seen, the  Rabbinical schools were founded on Jewish soil. But Palestine did not  continue to offer a friendly welcome. Under the more tolerant rulers of  Babylonia or Persia, Jewish learning found a refuge from the harshness  experienced under those of the Holy Land. The Babylonian Jewish schools  in Nehardea, Sura, and Pumbeditha rapidly surpassed the Palestinian in  reputation, and in the year 350 C.E., owing to natural decay, the  Palestinian schools closed.    The Talmud is accordingly not one work, but two, the one the literary  product of the Palestinian, the other, of the Babylonian _Amoraim_. The  latter is the larger, the more studied, the better preserved, and to it  attention will here be mainly confined. The Talmud is not a book, it is  a literature. It contains a legal code, a system of ethics, a body of  ritual customs, poetical passages, prayers, histories, facts of science  and medicine, and fancies of folk-lore.    The Amoraim were what their name implies, \"Expounders,\" or  \"Discoursers\"; but their expositions were often original contributions  to literature. Their work extends over the long interval between 200 and  500 C.E. The Amoraim naturally were men of various character and  condition. Some were possessed of much material wealth, others were  excessively poor. But few of them were professional men of letters. Like  the Tannaim, the Amoraim were often artisans, field-laborers, or  physicians, whose heart was certainly in literature, but whose hand was  turned to the practical affairs of life. The men who stood highest  socially, the Princes of the Captivity in Babylonia and the Patriarchs  in Palestine, were not always those vested with the highest authority.  Some of the Amoraim, again, were merely receptive, the medium through  which tradition was handed on; others were creative as well. To put the  same fact in Rabbinical metaphor, some were Sinais of learning, others  tore up mountains, and ground them together in keen and critical  dialectics.    The oldest of the Amoraim, Chanina, the son of Chama, of Sepphoris  (180-260), was such a firm mountain of ancient learning. On the other  hand, Jochanan, the son of Napacha (199-279), of dazzling physical  beauty, had a more original mind. His personal charms conveyed to him  perhaps a sense of the artistic; to him the Greek language was a  delight, \"an ornament of women.\" Simon, the son of Lakish (200-275),  hardy of muscle and of intellect, started life as a professional  athlete. A later Rabbi, Zeira, was equally noted for his feeble,  unprepossessing figure and his nimble, ingenious mind. Another  contemporary of Jochanan, Joshua, the son of Levi, is the hero of many  legends. He was so tender to the poor that he declared his conviction  that the Messiah would arise among the beggars and cripples of Rome.  Simlai, who was born in Palestine, and migrated to Nehardea in  Babylonia, was more of a poet than a lawyer. His love was for the  ethical and poetic elements of the Talmud, the _Hagadah_, as this aspect  of the Rabbinical literature was called in contradistinction to the  _Halachah_, or legal elements. Simlai entered into frequent discussions  with the Christian Fathers on subjects of Biblical exegesis.    The centre of interest now changes to Babylonia. Here, in the year 219,  Abba Areka, or Rab (175-247), founded the Sura"]]]
