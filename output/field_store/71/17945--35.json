Pennsylvania was, in a very large measure, the product of the  generous spirit and tireless labors of its first proprietor, the leader  of the Friends, William Penn, to whom it was granted in 1681 and in  whose family it remained until 1776. The two Carolinas were first  organized as one colony in 1663 under the government and patronage of  eight proprietors, including Lord Clarendon; but after more than half a  century both became royal provinces governed by the king.    [Illustration: WILLIAM PENN, PROPRIETOR OF PENNSYLVANIA]      THE COLONIAL PEOPLES    =The English.=--In leadership and origin the thirteen colonies, except  New York and Delaware, were English. During the early days of all, save  these two, the main, if not the sole, current of immigration was from  England. The colonists came from every walk of life. They were men,  women, and children of \"all sorts and conditions.\" The major portion  were yeomen, or small land owners, farm laborers, and artisans. With  them were merchants and gentlemen who brought their stocks of goods or  their fortunes to the New World. Scholars came from Oxford and  Cambridge to preach the gospel or to teach. Now and then the son of an  English nobleman left his baronial hall behind and cast his lot with  America. The people represented every religious faith--members of the  Established Church of England; Puritans who had labored to reform that  church; Separatists, Baptists, and Friends, who had left it altogether;  and Catholics, who clung to the religion of their fathers.    New England was almost purely English. During the years between 1629 and  1640, the period of arbitrary Stuart government, about twenty thousand  Puritans emigrated to America, settling in the colonies of the far  North. Although minor additions were made from time to time, the greater  portion of the New England people sprang from this original stock.  Virginia, too, for a long time drew nearly all her immigrants from  England alone. Not until the eve of the Revolution did other  nationalities, mainly the Scotch-Irish and Germans, rival the English in  numbers.    The populations of later English colonies--the Carolinas, New York,  Pennsylvania, and Georgia--while receiving a steady stream of  immigration from England, were constantly augmented by wanderers from  the older settlements. New York was invaded by Puritans from New England  in such numbers as to cause the Anglican clergymen there to lament that  \"free thinking spreads almost as fast as the Church.\" North Carolina was  first settled toward the northern border by immigrants from Virginia.  Some of the North Carolinians, particularly the Quakers, came all the  way from New England, tarrying in Virginia only long enough to learn how  little they were wanted in that Anglican colony.    =The Scotch-Irish.=--Next to the English in numbers and influence were  the Scotch-Irish, Presbyterians in belief, English in tongue. Both  religious and economic reasons sent them across the sea. Their Scotch  ancestors, in the days of Cromwell, had settled in the north of Ireland  whence the native Irish had been driven by the conqueror's sword. There  the Scotch nourished for many years enjoying in peace their own form of  religion and growing prosperous in the manufacture of fine linen and  woolen cloth. Then the blow fell. Toward the end of the seventeenth  century their religious worship was put under the ban and the export of  their cloth was forbidden by the English Parliament. Within two decades  twenty thousand Scotch-Irish left Ulster alone, for America; and all  during the eighteenth century the migration continued to be heavy.  Although no exact record was kept, it is reckoned that the Scotch-Irish  and the Scotch who came directly from Scotland, composed one-sixth of  the entire American population on the eve of the Revolution.    [Illustration: SETTLEMENTS OF GERMAN AND SCOTCH-IRISH  IMMIGRANTS]    These newcomers in America made their homes chiefly in New Jersey,  Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and the Carolinas. Coming late upon  the scene, they found much of the land immediately upon the seaboard  already taken up. For this reason most of them became frontier people  settling the interior and upland regions. There they cleared the land,  laid out their small farms, and worked as \"sturdy yeomen on the soil,\"  hardy, industrious, and independent in spirit, sharing neither the  luxuries of the rich planters nor the easy life of the leisurely  merchants. To their agriculture they added woolen and linen  manufactures, which, flourishing in the supple fingers of their tireless  women, made heavy inroads upon the trade of the English merchants in  the colonies. Of their labors a poet has sung:            \"O, willing hands to toil;      Strong natures tuned to the harvest-song and bound to the kindly soil;      Bold pioneers for the wilderness, defenders in the field.\"    =The Germans.=--Third among the colonists in order of numerical  importance were the Germans. From the very beginning, they appeared in  colonial records. A number of the artisans and carpenters in the first  Jamestown colony were of German descent. Peter Minuit, the famous  governor of New Motherland, was a German from Wesel on the Rhine, and  Jacob Leisler, leader of a popular uprising against the provincial  administration of New York, was a German from Frankfort-on-Main. The  wholesale migration of Germans began with the founding of Pennsylvania.  Penn was diligent in searching for thrifty farmers to cultivate his  lands and he made a special effort to attract peasants from the Rhine  country. A great association, known as the Frankfort Company, bought  more than twenty thousand acres from him and in 1684 established a  center at Germantown for the distribution of German immigrants. In old  New York, Rhinebeck-on-the-Hudson became a similar center for  distribution. All the way from Maine to Georgia inducements were offered  to the German farmers and in nearly every colony were to be found, in  time, German settlements. In fact the migration became so large that  German princes were frightened at the loss of so many subjects and  England was alarmed by the influx of foreigners into her overseas  dominions. Yet nothing could stop the movement. By the end of the  colonial period, the number of Germans had risen to more than two  hundred thousand.    The majority of them were Protestants from the Rhine region, and South  Germany. Wars, religious controversies, oppression, and poverty drove  them forth to America. Though most of them were farmers, there were also  among them skilled artisans who contributed to the rapid growth of  industries in Pennsylvania. Their iron, glass, paper, and woolen mills,  dotted here and there among the thickly settled regions, added to the  wealth and independence of the province.    [Illustration: _From an old print_    A GLIMPSE OF OLD GERMANTOWN]    Unlike the Scotch-Irish, the Germans did not speak the language of the  original colonists or mingle freely with them. They kept to themselves,  built their own schools, founded their own newspapers, and published  their own books. Their clannish habits often irritated their neighbors  and led to occasional agitations against \"foreigners.\" However, no  serious collisions seem to have occurred; and in the days of the  Revolution, German soldiers from Pennsylvania fought in the patriot  armies side by side with soldiers from the English and Scotch-Irish  sections.    =Other Nationalities.=--Though the English, the Scotch-Irish, and the  Germans made up the bulk of the colonial population, there were other  racial strains as well, varying in numerical importance but contributing  their share to colonial life.    From France came the Huguenots fleeing from the decree of the king which  inflicted terrible penalties upon Protestants.    From \"Old Ireland\" came thousands of native Irish, Celtic in race and  Catholic in religion. Like their Scotch-Irish neighbors to the north,  they revered neither the government nor the church of England imposed  upon them by the sword. How many came we do not know, but shipping  records of the colonial period show that boatload after boatload left  the southern and eastern shores of Ireland for the New World.  Undoubtedly thousands of their passengers were Irish of the native  stock. This surmise is well sustained by the constant appearance of  Celtic names in the records of various colonies.    [Illustration:_From an old print_    OLD DUTCH FORT AND ENGLISH CHURCH NEAR ALBANY]    The Jews, then as ever engaged in their age-long battle for religious  and economic toleration, found in the American colonies, not complete  liberty, but certainly more freedom than they enjoyed in England,  France, Spain, or Portugal. The English law did not actually recognize  their right to live in any of the dominions, but owing to the easy-going  habits of the Americans they were allowed to filter into the seaboard  towns. The treatment they received there varied. On one occasion the  mayor and council of New York forbade them to sell by retail and on  another prohibited the exercise of their religious worship. Newport,  Philadelphia, and Charleston were more hospitable, and there large  Jewish colonies, consisting principally of merchants and their families,  flourished in spite of nominal prohibitions of the law.    Though the small Swedish colony in Delaware was quickly submerged  beneath the tide of English migration, the Dutch in New York continued  to hold their own for more than a hundred years after the English  conquest in 1664. At the end of the colonial period over one-half of the  170,000 inhabitants of the province were descendants of the original  Dutch--still distinct enough to give a decided cast to the life and  manners of New York. Many of them clung as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16965"],[0,"Queen Victoria (#4)"],[1,"e. His fine training and sympathetic  nature enabled him, little by little, to be the means of helping on  important reforms. In addition to this, both he and his wife found  time to work at drawing and music, which they studied together under  the best masters. Throughout the Queen's correspondence one reads  of his devotion to her both as husband and helpmate.    The times were hard; discontent with poverty and bad trade kept the  nation ill at ease, and, as is always the case, there were many who  did their best to stir up riot. As a consequence, possibly, of this  unrest, attempts were made on the Queen's life, once in 1840 and twice  in 1841.    The relief and joy felt by the whole nation at their young Queen's  lucky escapes from death by an assassin's hand are expressed in the  following lines by an anonymous author:--        God saved the Queen--all thoughts apart      This crowning joy fills every mind!      She sits within the nation's heart,        An angel shrined.        The assassin's hand the steel enclosed,      He poised his ruthless hand on high--      But God in mercy interposed        His shadow for her panoply.        Then let ten thousand lyres be swept,        Let paeans ring o'er sea and land--      The Almighty hath our Sovereign kept        Within the hollow of His hand!    In July 1840, it was considered necessary to appoint a Regent in case  of the Queen's death. A Bill for this purpose was brought in and  passed, naming the Prince as Regent. This pleased the Queen, for it  was a clear proof of the golden opinions the Prince had won everywhere  since his marriage, and it was passed, as she herself said, entirely  on account of his noble character. At an earlier period it is certain,  as Lord Melbourne assured her, that Parliament would not have passed  such a Bill.    The Queen was soon to lose her chief adviser and friend, for in June  1841 Parliament dissolved and the Whigs were not returned to power.  Lord Melbourne could, however, resign with an easy mind, for he  himself recognized how valuable a counsellor the Queen now possessed  in her husband. After handing his resignation to the Queen, he wrote  to her: \"Lord Melbourne has formed the highest opinion of His Royal  Highness's judgment, temper, and discretion, and he cannot but feel  a great consolation and security in the reflection that he leaves  Your Majesty in a situation in which Your Majesty has the inestimable  advantage of such advice and assistance.\" The Queen was exceedingly  proud of these words of praise, coming as they did unasked from a  minister of such long experience.    It was in the same year that the Prince was appointed Head of the  Royal Commission which had been formed to encourage the study of the  Fine Arts throughout the kingdom. This was work of a kind which he  especially loved, and he was now in a position to influence the  movement which led to the Great Exhibition of 1851.    [Illustration: Prince Albert  F.X. Winterhalter  Photo Emery Walker Ltd.]    But all was not plain sailing for the Prince, who was still regarded,  if not with dislike, at any rate with some mistrust, as being a  foreigner. For a long time yet he felt himself a stranger, the Queen's  husband and nothing more. Still, \"all cometh to him who knoweth how  to wait,\" and he set himself bravely to his uphill task. To use his  own words, \"I endeavour to be as much use to Victoria as I can,\"--this  was the keynote of his whole life.    The Prince took sides with neither of the political parties, and  first of all by careful economy he lessened the enormous household  expenses and proved that it was possible for royalty to live without  always being in debt. He established model farms at Osborne and  Windsor, introduced different and better breeds of cattle, and even  made a profit on the undertaking. He persuaded his wife to give up  the late hours which were still usual, and gradually, by kindness  and sympathy, won the household staff over to his way of thinking.    The Prince's life was an extremely full one. Soon after six o'clock  was his time for rising. Until nine he read and answered letters.  He then looked through all the principal newspapers and gave the  Queen a summary of the most important news. He found time also to  work and play with his children during his short intervals of leisure.  Consultations with ministers, reading and writing dispatches  followed, and then a short time was devoted to open-air exercise.  After lunch he often accompanied the Queen on a drive. More reading  and writing took up his time until dinner, after which there was  either a social evening or a visit to a theatre. He was \"complete  master in his house, and the active centre of an Empire whose power  extends to every quarter of the globe. . . . No British Cabinet  minister has ever worked so hard during the session of Parliament,  and that is saying a good deal, as the Prince Consort did for 21  years. . . . The Prince had no holidays at all, he was always in  harness.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: Miss C.M. Yonge, _Life of H.R.H. the Prince Consort_.]    Louis Philippe, the first French king who had ever visited this  country, except King John, wrote of him: \"Oh, he will do wonders;  he is so wise; he is not in a hurry; he gains so much by being known.  He will always give you good advice. Do not think I say so in flattery.  No! No! It is from my heart. He will be like his uncle, equally wise  and good. . . . He will be of the greatest use to you, and will keep  well at your side if a time of vicissitude should come, such as I  hope may never be--but, after all, no one can tell.\"          CHAPTER V: _Family Life      \"Upon the good education of princes, and especially of those who are  destined to govern, the welfare of the world in these days very  greatly depends.\"    The love of children was always a strong connecting link between the  Queen and her people. No trouble was ever spared by her to obtain  the best possible advice on the training of her own family. The  nursery was as well governed as her kingdom.    Acting upon the advice of Baron Stockmar, the Queen determined to  have some one at the head on whom she could thoroughly rely, as her  many occupations prevented her from devoting so much time to these  duties as she could have wished. Lady Lyttelton, who had been a  lady-in-waiting, was appointed governess to the Royal Family in 1842,  and for eight years she held this post, winning the affection and  respect of her young pupils and the gratitude of the Queen and her  husband.    From time to time the Queen wrote her views upon the subject. \"The  greatest maxim of all is,\" she declared, \"that the children should  be brought up as simply, and in as domestic a way as possible; that  (not interfering with their lessons) they should be as much as  possible with their parents, and learn to place their greatest  confidence in them in all things.\"    Training in religion, to be of real and lasting value, must be given  by the mother herself, and in 1844 the Queen noted with regret that  it was not always possible for her to be with the Princess Royal when  the child was saying her prayers.    \"I am _quite_ clear,\" she said, \"that she ought to be taught to have  great reverence for God and for religion, but that she should have  the feeling of devotion and love which our Heavenly Father encourages  His earthly children to have for Him, and not one of fear and  trembling; and that the thoughts of death and an after-life should  not be represented in an alarming and forbidding view, and that she  should be made to know _as yet_ no difference of creeds, and not think  that she can only pray on her knees, or that those who do not kneel  are less fervent and devout in their prayers.\"    On November 21, 1840, the Queen's first child, Victoria Adelaide Mary  Louisa, the Princess Royal, was born. The Prince's care of his wife  \"was like that of a mother, nor could there be a kinder, wiser, or  more judicious nurse.\" Only for a moment was he disappointed that  his first child was a daughter and not a son.    The children were all brought up strictly and were never allowed to  appear at Court until a comparatively late age. They were all taught  to use their hands as well as their heads, and at Osborne, in the  Swiss cottage, the boys worked at carpentering and gardening, while  the girls were employed in learning cooking and housekeeping.  Christmas was always celebrated in splendid fashion by the family,  and the royal children were always encouraged to give as presents  something which they had made with their own hands. Lessons in riding,  driving, and swimming also formed part of their training, for the  Queen was wise enough to realize that open-air exercise was very  necessary for the health of her children.    In 1846 the question arose as to who should educate the Prince of  Wales (born 1841). A pamphlet on the subject had been published and  created general interest. Baron Stockmar was again consulted, and  gave it as his opinion that the Prince's education should be one  \"which will prepare him for approaching events\"--that is, he was to  be so educated that he would be in touch with the movements of the  age and able to respond sympathetically to the wishes of the nation.  The rapid growth of democracy throughout Europe made it absolutely  necessary that his education should be of a different kind. The task  of governing well was becoming more and more difficult, and reigning  monarchs were criticized in an open fashion, such as had not hitherto  been possible. After much thought the post was given to Mr Henry Birch  (formerly a master at Eton College, and at that time rector of  Prestwich, near Manchester), who had made a very favourable  impression upon the Queen and her husband.    Plain people as well as princes must be educated, and this fact was  never lost sight of by the Queen and her husband. In 1857 the Prince  called attention "]]]
