They had heeded none of the priest's words, and did not  notice now that he approached them, so eager were they to see  which fiery snake would go highest among the oak branches.  Foremost among them, and most intent on the pretty game, was a boy  like a sunbeam, slender and quick, with blithe brown eyes and  laughing lips. The priest's hand was laid upon his shoulder. The  boy turned and looked up in his face.    \"Here,\" said the old man, with his voice vibrating as when a thick  rope is strained by a ship swinging from her moorings, \"here is  the chosen one, the eldest son of the Chief, the darling of the  people. Hearken, Bernhard, wilt thou go to Valhalla, where the  heroes dwell with the gods, to bear a message to Thor?\"    The boy answered, swift and clear:    \"Yes, priest, I will go if my father bids me. Is it far away?  Shall I run quickly? Must I take my bow and arrows for the  wolves?\"    The boy's father, the Chieftain Gundhar, standing among his  bearded warriors, drew his breath deep, and leaned so heavily on  the handle of his spear that the wood cracked. And his wife, Irma,  bending forward from the ranks of women, pushed the golden hair  from her forehead with one hand. The other dragged at the silver  chain about her neck until the rough links pierced her flesh, and  the red drops fell unheeded on the snow of her breast.    A sigh passed through the crowd, like the murmur of the forest  before the storm breaks. Yet no one spoke save Hunrad:    \"Yes, my Prince, both bow and spear shalt thou have, for the way  is long, and thou art a brave huntsman. But in darkness thou must  journey for a little space, and with eyes blindfolded. Fearest  thou?\"    \"Naught fear I,\" said the boy, \"neither darkness, nor the great  bear, nor the were-wolf. For I am Gundhar's son, and the defender  of my folk.\"    Then the priest led the child in his raiment of lamb's-wool to a  broad stone in front of the fire. He gave him his little bow  tipped with silver, and his spear with shining head of steel. He  bound the child's eyes with a white cloth, and bade him kneel  beside the stone with his face to the east. Unconsciously the wide  arc of spectators drew inward toward the centre, as the ends of  the bow draw together when the cord is stretched. Winfried moved  noiselessly until he stood close behind the priest.    The old man stooped to lift a black hammer of stone from the  ground,--the sacred hammer of the god Thor. Summoning all the  strength of his withered arms, he swung it high in the air. It  poised for an instant above the child's fair head--then turned to  fall.    One keen cry shrilled out from where the women stood: \"Me! take  me! not Bernhard!\"    The flight of the mother towards her child was swift as the  falcon's swoop. But swifter still was the hand of the deliverer.    Winfried's heavy staff thrust mightily against the hammer's handle  as it fell. Sideways it glanced from the old man's grasp, and the  black stone, striking on the altar's edge, split in twain. A shout  of awe and joy rolled along the living circle. The branches of the  oak shivered. The flames leaped higher. As the shout died away the  people saw the lady Irma, with her arms clasped round her child,  and above them, on the altar-stone, Winfried, his face shining  like the face of an angel.    [Illustration--Then Winfried told the story of Bethlehem]        IV    THE FELLING OF THE TREE      IV    A swift mountain-flood rolling down its channel; a huge rock  tumbling from the hill-side and falling in mid-stream; the baffled  waters broken and confused, pausing in their flow, dash high  against the rock, foaming and murmuring, with divided impulse,  uncertain whether to turn to the right or the left.    Even so Winfried's bold deed fell into the midst of the thoughts  and passions of the council. They were at a standstill. Anger and  wonder, reverence and joy and confusion surged through the crowd.  They knew not which way to move: to resent the intrusion of the  stranger as an insult to their gods, or to welcome him as the  rescuer of their darling prince.    The old priest crouched by the altar, silent. Conflicting counsels  troubled the air. Let the sacrifice go forward; the gods must be  appeased. Nay, the boy must not die; bring the chieftain's best  horse and slay it in his stead; it will be enough; the holy tree  loves the blood of horses. Not so, there is a better counsel yet;  seize the stranger whom the gods have led hither as a victim and  make his life pay the forfeit of his daring.    The withered leaves on the oak rustled and whispered overhead. The  fire flared and sank again. The angry voices clashed against each  other and fell like opposing waves. Then the chieftain Gundhar  struck the earth with his spear and gave his decision.    \"All have spoken, but none are agreed. There is no voice of the  council. Keep silence now, and let the stranger speak. His words  shall give us judgment, whether he is to live or to die.\"    Winfried lifted himself high upon the altar, drew a roll of  parchment from his bosom, and began to read.    \"A letter from the great Bishop of Rome, who sits on a golden  throne, to the people of the forest, Hessians and Thuringians,  Franks and Saxons. _In nomine Domini, sanctae et individuae  trinitatis, amen!\"_    A murmur of awe ran through the crowd. \"It is the sacred tongue of  the Romans: the tongue that is heard and understood by the wise  men of every land. There is magic in it. Listen!\"    Winfried went on to read the letter, translating it into the  speech of the people.    \"'We have sent unto you our Brother Boniface, and appointed him  your bishop, that he may teach you the only true faith, and  baptize you, and lead you back from the ways of error to the path  of salvation. Hearken to him in all things like a father. Bow your  hearts to his teaching. He comes not for earthly gain, but for the  gain of your souls. Depart from evil works. Worship not the false  gods, for they are devils. Offer no more bloody sacrifices, nor  eat the flesh of horses, but do as our Brother Boniface commands  you. Build a house for him that he may dwell among you, and a  church where you may offer your prayers to the only living God,  the Almighty King of Heaven.'\"    It was a splendid message: proud, strong, peaceful, loving. The  dignity of the words imposed mightily upon the hearts of the  people. They were quieted as men who have listened to a lofty  strain of music.    \"Tell us, then,\" said Gundhar, \"what is the word that thou  bringest to us from the Almighty. What is thy counsel for the  tribes of the woodland on this night of sacrifice?\"    \"This is the word, and this is the counsel,\" answered Winfried.  \"Not a drop of blood shall fall to-night, save that which pity has  drawn from the breast of your princess, in love for her child. Not  a life shall be blotted out in the darkness tonight; but the great  shadow of the tree which hides you from the light of heaven shall  be swept away. For this is the birth-night of the white Christ,  son of the All-Father, and Saviour of mankind. Fairer is He than  Baldur the Beautiful, greater than Odin the Wise, kinder than  Freya the Good. Since He has come to earth the bloody sacrifices  must cease. The dark Thor, on whom you vainly call, is dead. Deep  in the shades of Niffelheim he is lost forever. His power in the  world is broken. Will you serve a helpless god? See, my brothers,  you call this tree his oak. Does he dwell here? Does he protect  it?\"    A troubled voice of assent rose from the throng. The people  stirred uneasily. Women covered their eyes. Hunrad lifted his head  and muttered hoarsely, \"Thor! take vengeance! Thor!\"    Winfried beckoned to Gregor. \"Bring the axes, thine and one for  me. Now, young woodsman, show thy craft! The king-tree of the  forest must fall, and swiftly, or all is lost!\"    The two men took their places facing each other, one on each side  of the oak. Their cloaks were flung aside, their heads bare.  Carefully they felt the ground with their feet, seeking a firm  grip of the earth. Firmly they grasped the axe-helves and swung  the shining blades.    \"Tree-god!\" cried Winfried, \"art thou angry? Thus we smite thee!\"    \"Tree-god!\" answered Gregor, \"art thou mighty? Thus we fight  thee!\"    Clang! clang! the alternate strokes beat time upon the hard,  ringing wood. The axe-heads glittered in their rhythmic flight,  like fierce eagles circling about their quarry.    The broad flakes of wood flew from the deepening gashes in the  sides of the oak. The huge trunk quivered. There was a shuddering  in the branches. Then the great wonder of Winfried's life came to  pass.    Out of the stillness of the winter night, a mighty rushing noise  sounded overhead.    Was it the ancient gods on their white battle-steeds, with their  black hounds of wrath and their arrows of lightning, sweeping  through the air to destroy their foes?    A strong, whirling wind passed over the tree-tops. It gripped the  oak by its branches and tore it from its roots. Backward it fell,  like a ruined tower, groaning and crashing as it split asunder in  four great pieces.    Winfried let his axe drop, and bowed his head for a moment in the  presence of almighty power.    Then he turned to the people, \"Here is the timber,\" he cried,  \"already felled and split for your new building. On this spot  shall rise a chapel to the true God and his servant St. Peter.    \"And here,\" said he, as his eyes fell on a young fir-tree,  standing straight and green, with its top pointing towards the  stars, amid the divided ruins of the fallen oak, \"here is the  living tree, with no stain of blood upon it, that shall be the  sign of your new worship. See how it points to the sky. Let us  call it the tree of the Christ-child. Take it up and carry it to  the chieftain's hall.

When the Eagle nearly reached the ground, the other birds set up a cry  of greeting.    \"Hail, King Eagle!\" they sang. \"How high you flew! How near the sun! Did  he not scorch your Majesty's feathers? Hail, mighty king!\" and they made  a deafening chorus. But the Eagle stopped them.    \"The Wren is your king, not I,\" he said. \"He mounted higher than I did.\"    \"The Wren? Ha-ha! The _Wren_! We can't believe that The Wren flew  higher than you? No, no!\" they all shouted. But just then the Eagle  lighted on a tree, and from the top of his head hopped the little Wren,  cocking his head and ruffling himself proudly.    \"Yes, I mounted higher than he,\" he cried, \"for I was perched on his  head all the while, ha-ha! And now, therefore, I am king, small though I  be.\"    Now the Eagle was very angry when he saw the trick that had been played  upon him, and he swooped upon the sly Wren to punish him. But the Wren  screamed, \"Remember, remember your promise never to injure me or mine!\"  Then the Eagle stopped, for he was a noble bird and never forgot a  promise. He folded his wings and turned away in disgust.    \"Be king, then, O cheat and trickster!\" he said.    \"Cheat and trickster!\" echoed the other birds. \"We will have no such  fellow for our king. Cheat and trickster he is, and he shall be  punished. You shall be king, brave Eagle, for without your strength he  could never have flown so high. It is you whom we want for our  protector and lawmaker, not this sly fellow no bigger than a bean.\"    So the Eagle became their king, after all; and a noble bird he is, as  you must understand, or he would never have been chosen to guard our  nation's coat of arms. And besides this you may see his picture on many  a banner and crest and coin of gold or silver, so famous has he become.    But the Wren was to be punished. And while the birds were trying to  decide what should be done with him, they put him in prison in a  mouse-hole and set Master Owl to guard the door. Now while the judges  were putting their heads together the lazy Owl fell fast asleep, and out  of prison stole the little Wren and was far away before any one could  catch him. So he was never punished after all, as he richly deserved to  be.    The birds were so angry with old Master Owl for his carelessness that he  has never since dared to show his face abroad in daytime, but hides away  in his hollow tree. And only at night he wanders alone in the woods,  sorry and ashamed.          HALCYONE      The story of the first Kingfisher is a sad one, and you need not read it  unless for a very little while you wish to feel sorry.    Long, long ago when the world was new, there lived a beautiful princess  named Halcyone. She was the daughter of old AEolus, King of the Winds,  and lived with him on his happy island, where it was his chief business  to keep in order the four boisterous brothers, Boreas, the North Wind,  Zephyrus, the West Wind, Auster, the South Wind, and Eurus, the East  Wind. Sometimes, indeed, AEolus had a hard time of it; for the Winds  would escape from his control and rush out upon the sea for their  terrible games, which were sure to bring death and destruction to the  sailors and their ships. Knowing them so well, for she had grown up with  these rough playmates, Halcyone came to dread more than anything else  the cruelties which they practiced at every opportunity.    One day the Prince Ceyx came to the island of King AEolus. He was the son  of Hesperus, the Evening Star, and he was the king of the great land of  Thessaly. Ceyx and Halcyone grew to love each other dearly, and at last  with the consent of good King AEolus, but to the wrath of the four Winds,  the beautiful princess went away to be the wife of Ceyx and Queen of  Thessaly.    For a long time they lived happily in their peaceful kingdom, but  finally came a day when Ceyx must take a long voyage on the sea, to  visit a temple in a far country. Halcyone could not bear to have him go,  for she feared the dangers of the great deep, knowing well the cruelty  of the Winds, whom King AEolus had such difficulty in keeping within  bounds. She knew how the mischievous brothers loved to rush down upon  venturesome sailors and blow them into danger, and she knew that they  especially hated her husband because he had carried her away from the  island where she had watched the Winds at their terrible play. She  begged Ceyx not to go, but he said that it was necessary. Then she  prayed that if he must go he would take her with him, for she could not  bear to remain behind dreading what might happen.    But Ceyx was resolved that Halcyone should not go. The good king longed  to take her with him; no more than she could he smile at the thought of  separation. But he also feared the sea, not on his own account, but for  his dear wife. In spite of her entreaties he remained firm. If all went  well he promised to return in two months' time. But Halcyone knew that  she should never see him again as now he spoke.    The day of separation came. Standing heart-broken upon the shore,  Halcyone watched the vessel sail away into the East, until as a little  speck it dropped below the horizon; then sobbing bitterly she returned  to the palace.    Now the king and his men had completed but half their journey when a  terrible storm arose. The wicked Winds had escaped from the control of  good old AEolus and were rushing down upon the ocean to punish Ceyx for  carrying away the beautiful Halcyone. Fiercely they blew, the lightning  flashed, and the sea ran high; and in the midst of the horrible tumult  the good ship went to the bottom with all on board. Thus the fears of  Halcyone were proved true, and far from his dear wife poor Ceyx perished  in the cruel waves.    That very night when the shipwreck occurred, the sad and fearful  Halcyone, sleeping lonely at home, knew in a dream the very calamity  which had happened. She seemed to see the storm and the shipwreck, and  the form of Ceyx appeared, saying a sad farewell to her. As soon as it  was light she rose and hastened to the seashore, trembling with a  horrible dread. Standing on the very spot whence she had last seen the  fated ship, she looked wistfully over the waste of stormy waters. At  last she spied a dark something tossing on the waves. The object floated  nearer and nearer, until a huge breaker cast before her on the sand the  body of her drowned husband.    \"O dearest Ceyx!\" she cried. \"Is it thus that you return to me?\"  Stretching out her arms toward him, she leaped upon the sea wall as if  she would throw herself into the ocean, which advanced and retreated,  seething around his body. But a different fate was to be hers. As she  leaped forward two strong wings sprouted from her shoulders, and before  she knew it she found herself skimming lightly as a bird over the water.  From her throat came sounds of sobbing, which changed as she flew into  the shrill piping of a bird. Soft feathers now covered her body, and a  crest rose above the forehead which had once been so fair. Halcyone was  become a Kingfisher, the first Kingfisher who ever flew lamenting above  the waters of the world.    The sad bird fluttered through the spray straight to the body that was  tossed upon the surf. As her wings touched the wet shoulders, and as her  horny beak sought the dumb lips in an attempt to kiss what was once so  dear, the body of Ceyx began to receive new life. The limbs stirred, a  faint color returned to the cheeks. At the same moment a change like  that which had transformed Halcyone began to pass over her husband. He  too was becoming a Kingfisher. He too felt the thrill of wings upon his  shoulders, wings which were to bear him up and away out of the sea which  had been his death. He too was clad in soft plumage with a kingly crest  upon his kingly head. With a faint cry, half of sorrow for what had  happened, half of joy for the future in which these two loving ones were  at least to be together, Ceyx rose from the surf-swept sand where his  lifeless limbs had lain and went skimming over the waves beside Halcyone  his wife.    So those unhappy mortals became the first kingfishers, happy at last in  being reunited. So we see them still, flying up and down over the waters  of the world, royal forms with royal crests upon their heads.    They built their nest of the bones of fish, a stout and well-joined  basket which floated on the waves as safely as any little boat. And  while their children, the baby Halcyons, lay in this rocking cradle, for  seven days in the heart of winter, no storms ever troubled the ocean  and mariners could set out upon their voyages without fear.    For while his little grandchildren rocked in their basket, the good King  AEolus, pitying the sorrows of his daughter Halcyone, was always  especially careful to chain up in prison those wicked brothers the  Winds, so that they could do no mischief of any kind.    And that is why a halcyon time has come to mean a season of peace and  safety.          THE FORGETFUL KINGFISHER      In these days the Kingfisher is a sad and solitary bird, caring not to  venture far from the water where she finds her food. Up and down the  river banks she goes, uttering a peculiar plaintive cry. What is she  saying, and why is she so restless? The American Kingfisher is gray, but  her cousin of Europe is a bird of brilliant azure with a breast of rusty  red. Therefore it must have been the foreign Kingfisher who was  forgetful, as you shall hear.    Long, long after the sorrows of Halcyone, the first Kingfisher, were  ended, came the great storm which lasted forty days and forty nights,  causing the worst flood which the world has ever known. That was a  terrible time. When Father Noah hastened to build his ark, inviting the  animals and birds to take refuge with him, the Kingfisher herself was  glad to go aboard. For even she, protected"]]]
