When, at my meals, it jumped on my knees, turned round, looked at me,  and spoke in a coaxing and flattering way, it was asking for something  to eat. When its mother came up with a mouse in her jaws, her muffled  and low-toned mew informed the little one from a distance, and caused  it to spring and run up to the game that was brought to it. The cry is  always the same, but varied in the strength of the inflections and in  its protraction, so as to represent the various states of mind with  which my young animal is moved--just as it was with the drunken man in  the mimicry scene. These facts are probably well known to all  observers of animals.    We have seen that this tonality of the watch dog's cries is competent  to indicate that a person is coming to the house. We find similar  cries of warning uttered by birds. When I was a professor in the  faculty of Lille, I frequently visited the well known aged Professor  of Physics, M. Delezenne. He had a working room at the end of a  garden, in which a laughing mew wandered. From the time that any one  came in till he went out, this bird made the vocal explosions to which  it owes its name; and the good professor was certain, without ever  being mistaken, that somebody was coming to his laboratory. He was  notified. My Jaco in Paris has a warble that answers the ringing of  the bell. If we have not heard the bell, we are notified by Jaco of  its ringing, and, going to the door, find some one there. I have been  told of a parrot belonging to the steward of a lyceum which had heard  the words \"Come in,\" when any one rang the bell. He never failed to  cry, \"Come in,\" when the bell moved, and the visitor was embarrassed  at seeing nobody after having been invited to open the door.    Instances in which the cries of birds had an incontestable and precise  signification are numerous; let me refer to a few of the best known.  The cackle of a hen, after having laid an egg and left her nest, is  decidedly characteristic. Her clucking when she is impelled to sit on  her eggs, or when she is calling her chicks, is no less demonstrative.  There is not a farmer who does not recognize it and understand it. In  these things we see the relation between the tone of the prating or  cluck of the hen and her acts. But when a nightingale sings all night,  or a goldfinch whistles, or a raven croaks, we cannot so easily  interpret the significance of their inarticulate sounds. The finch  calls its mate by uttering a few notes followed by a long trill.  Matches of a barbarous character, based on this habit, I were held in  the north of France while I was living at Lille, between 1855 and  1860. I do not know whether they have been suppressed or not, but the  laws for the protection of animals ought to take cognizance of them.  The gamesters put out the eyes of the male finches, and made them,  thus blinded, compete as singers, for which purpose they brought their  cages into proximity. When the birds heard and recognized one  another's voices, they made their appeal to the female; the one that  renewed his amorous trills most frequently, protracted them longest  and to the last, gained the prize. The bird that was declared victor  received a medal amid the applause of a large and enthusiastic crowd;  and considerable wagers were staked upon the result. I have heard that  these poor blinded birds sometimes fell down exhausted with singing,  and kept on calling the absent female till they died, not being  willing to yield to a rival, who on his side was also keeping up his  equally useless appeals.    These finch contests were suggested after the meaning of the song of  the birds was learned. But when these birds, which are more usually  isolated--whence they have been named _Fringilla coelebs_, or  celibates--hop around our houses and also utter their amorous trills  at another than the mating season, they are evidently not calling the  female. Should we not then seek to determine by the tone whether their  call, which is always the same, is amorous or not?    In countries where flocks of turkeys are raised one can learn very  quickly from their gobblings when they have captured a hare. If they  meet him standing still or lying down, they form in a circle around  him, and, putting their heads down, repeat continually their peculiar  cries. The hare remains quiet, and it is sometimes possible to take  him up, terrorized as he is in the midst of the black circle of  gobbling beaks and heads. The language of the turkeys is at that time  incontestably significant. It is warlike, and similar to that of the  males when they are fighting. In the present instance they have joined  for war, and they make it on the frightened hare.    My Jaco, like all parrots, which are excellent imitators, pronounces a  few words and repeats them over and over again. Such birds amuse us  because the words they know sometimes happen to be ludicrously  fitting. A bird of this kind had been struck by the note sounded by  the wind blowing into a room through a crack in the glass work  whenever a certain door was opened; and he had become so perfect in  his imitation that they sometimes, on hearing the noise, went to shut  the door when it was not open.    Jaco formerly belonged to a very pious old lady who was accustomed to  say her litanies with another person. He had caught the words \"Pray  for us,\" in the invocations to the several saints, and said them so  well as sometimes to deceive his learned mistress, and cause her to  think she was saying her litanies with two colleagues. When Jaco was  out of food, and any one passed by him, he would say, \"My poor  Cocotte!\" or \"My poor rat!\" in an arch, mawkish, protracted tone that  indicated very clearly what he wanted, and that his drinking cup was  empty. There was no doubt in the house as to his meaning; and whenever  one heard it he said: \"He has nothing to eat.\" He was exceedingly fond  of fresh pits of apples and pears, and I was in the habit of  collecting them and keeping them to give him. So whenever, as I came  near him, I put my hand into my pocket he never failed to say: \"Poor  Cocco!\" in a supplicating tone which it was impossible to mistake. A  sugar plum is a choice morsel to him. He can tell what it is from a  distance when I hold it out in my fingers; and when I give it to him  he cannot restrain himself if it has been any considerable time since  he has had the delicacy. Usually, after having made the first motion  to get it, as if he were ravished and wanted to express his joy in  advance, he would draw back before taking it, and say, in a comical  tone, \"Hold, my poor Cocotte!\" His manner of thanking in advance is  likewise amusing. The expression of his eyes and the pose of his head  are all in accord with the tone of his exclamation. When he tastes the  plum he utters a series of _ahs_, and produces a kind of warble by  prolonging some of his notes and shortening up others. We find in  these examples, without doubt, that the articulate voice makes us  better able to judge the meaning of the impressions that are moving  the animal than inarticulate cries, or merely musical sounds. When  Jaco met a child for whom he had a great affection, he would promenade  on his perch, or turn the wheel, spreading out his tail and ruffling  the feathers of his head, while his eyes grew red with excitement if  the child was too slow in bestowing the accustomed caress. Then he  would stop, bend down his head, and, looking at his friend, say  pleasantly, \"Jaco,\" in a tone and with a manner quite in contrast with  the pronunciation of the same word when he was hungry.    It is not the word he speaks that is of interest; he might have been  taught another, and it would have been the same; but it is the tone.  In this case, too, the articulation gives an easier clew to the  meaning the bird seeks to express, having a meaning according to the  manner of pronouncing it, than any isolated, simply musical sound,  like the song of the nightingale, canary bird, and warbler. This  became evident to me, not from observing animals for a few moments  without seeing them again, but from studying them continuously.    Jaco did not like solitude, and was talkative and fond of being  caressed, like all of his kind. One day, when there was no one in the  country house, all having gone out into the garden or the fields, I  heard him saying over what few words he knew, in different  inflections. I went quietly into the room where he was, without being  seen; but he heard my steps, although I walked in very cautiously,  hoping to surprise him. He ceased his chatter, listened, and, after a  silence, pronounced \"Jaco\" in a low tone, drawing out the end of the  word. He listened again, and repeated the word in the same tone; then,  after another silence, repeated it with a rise of the voice. I  continued observing him, and, as he heard no one, he raised his tone  gradually, repeating the same word, and ended at last with a genuine  cry of distress. The people ran in from without, supposing something  had happened to him. He then repeated his name in a lower tone, which  seemed to indicate his satisfaction at finding his isolation ended. I  went in myself, and his prattle unmistakably betrayed his gladness at  being no longer alone.    Is there not in this an act of real intelligence? While alone, the  parrot entertained himself by talking; but when he heard a sound he  hoped at first to see some one come; and when no one answered him, he  raised his voice, as a person would do who calls, and, getting no  reply, cried out louder and louder till he was heard and answered. The  meaning of the differences of intonation is as evident in this case as  in that of the drunken man. A parrot raised in the South had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15199"],[0,"The Reformed Librarie-Keeper (1650) (#4)"],[1,"nference, if the natural abilities of youths in a School (when  reformed) may bee thus far improved: how far more may they bee improved,  when they are past the age of Youth, and com to Manhood in Colleges and  Universities, if namely Colleges and Universities, could in the sphere  of their activities bee proportionally Reformed, as the Schools may bee  in their sphere: for it is rational to conclude thus: if the first step  of our Reformation will lead us thus far, how far will the second and  third lead us? and if Scholastical Exercises in Youths of eighteen or  twentie years, will advance them to that perfection of Learning and  Virtues, which few of double their age or none almost ever attein unto,  what will Collegial and Academical Exercises (if reformed and set upon  their proper Objects) bring them unto? I shall therefore to eas you, or  such as may have this scruple and jealousie over mee, declare that my  purpose is so far from making Colleges and Universities useless, that if  I might have my desire in them, they should becom a thousand times more  useful then now they are, that is, as far above the ordinarie State  wherein they are set, as this School is above the ordinarie waie of  Schooling: for if wee look upon the true and proper ends of School,  College and Universitie-studies and Exercises, wee shall see that as in  nature they are in a gradual proportion, distant from, and subordinate  unto each other, so they ought to rise one out of another, and bee built  upon each other's Foundations.    The true and proper end of Schooling is to teach and Exercise Children  and Youths in the Grounds of all Learning and Virtues, so far as either  their capacitie in that age will suffer them to com, or is requisite to  apprehend the principles of useful matters, by which they may bee made  able to exercise themselvs in everie good Employment afterwards by  themselvs, and as the Proverb is, _sine Cortice natare_. The true and  proper end of Colleges should bee to bring together into one Societie  such as are able thus to Exercise themselvs in anie or all kind of  Studies, that by their mutual Association, Communication, and Assistance  in Reading, Meditating and conferring about profitable matters, they may  not onely perfit their own Abilities, but advance the superstructures of  all Learning to that perfection, which by such means is attainable. And  the true and proper End of Universities, should bee to publish unto the  World the Matters, which formerly have not been published; to discover  the Errors and hurtfulness of things mistaken for Truths; and to supplie  the defects and _desiderata_, which may bee servicable to all sorts of  Professions.    Now according to those aimes and ends, I suppose it may bee inferred,  that none should bee dismissed out of the Schools, till they are able  to make use of all sorts of Books, and direct themselvs profitably in  everie cours of Studie or Action, whereunto their _Genius_ shall lead  them; and that none should bee admitted into anie Colleges, but such as  will join with others, to elaborate som profitable Tasks, for the  Advancement and facilitating of superstructures in things already by som  discovered, but not made common unto all; And that none should bee made  Publick Professors in Universities, but such as have not onely a Publick  aim, but som approved Abilities, to supply som defects and to Elaborate  som _desiderata_ of usefull knowledg, or to direct such as are studious,  how to order their thoughts in all Matters of search and Meditation, for  the discoverie of things not hitherto found out by others; but which in  probabilitie may bee found out by rational searching.    Thus then I conceiv, that in a well-Reformed Common wealth, which is to  bee subordinate unto the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, wherein the Glorie of  God, the happiness of the nature of man: and the Glorious libertie of  the Sons of God is to bee revealed; all the subjects thereof should in  their Youth bee trained up in som Schools fit for their capacities, and  that over these Schools, som Overseers should bee appointed to look to  the cours of their Education, to see that none should bee left destitute  of som benefit of virtuous breeding, according to the several kinds of  emploiments, whereunto they may bee found most fit and inclinable,  whether it bee to bear som civil Office in the Common-wealth, or to bee  Mechanically emploied, or to bee bred to teach others humane Sciences,  or to bee imploied in Prophetical Exercises. As for this School, which  at this time I have delineated, it is proper to such of the Nobilitie,  Gentrie and better sort of Citizens, which are fit to bee made capable  to bear Offices in the Common-wealth: the other Schools may bee spoken  off in due time, so far as they are distinct from this, but that which  now I have to suggest is chiefly this, that as out of the Schools the  chois, which ought to bee made for Colleges, ought, _Caeteris paribus_,  onely to bee of such as are most fit to Advance the Ends of a Collegial  Association; so out of Colleges a chois ought to bee made of Professors  for the Universitie onely, of such as are fitted to advance the Ends of  Publick teaching in Universities, which are not to Repeat and  Compendiate that which others have published twentie times already,  over and over again, but to add unto the Common stock of humane  knowledg, that which others have not observed, to the end that all these  degrees of Studies and Exercises of the minde of man, beeing subordinate  unto the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, the happiness of Man by all Rational  and Spiritual waies of improving humane Abilities, may bee advanced unto  it's perfection in this life so far as may bee.    But how far short wee com now of all these designs, I need not to relate  unto you: the Colleges as they are now Conformed, can scarce reach to  the half of that which the Schools might bring us unto: and the  Professors of the Universities com not up to that, which the Collegial  Associations might elaborate, if they were rightly directed to set their  Talents at work; and if the publick Spirit of Christian love and  ingenuitie did possess those, that are possessed of publick places in  the Colleges of the Universities. For if this Spirit did rule their Aims  and Endevors, there would bee no self-seeking, no partialitie, no envie,  nor anie cross actings for private ends, to the prejudice of the  Publick; but the generous love of virtue and of profitable Learning,  would swaie all their inclinations to a free conjunction; and make all  their endeavors subordinate unto the publick good of the Common-wealth  of Israel in the Communion of Saints. But how far this Principle of  acting is now wanting amongst us all, I shall not need to mention: you  have considered it long ago, and wee have together lamented that defect,  and the doleful effects thereof: our endevor must bee to seek out the  best means of a Reformation therein, and to make use of them as God  shall give us opportunities. And truly somthing of this kinde might bee  don, without anie great alteration or stir, even as matters now are  formed in the Colleges; if God would bee so gracious to us, as to beget  in the mindes of those that understand those things, a heartie Aim and  Resolution to benefit the Christian Common-wealth of Learning, by their  Collegial Relations and Associations one to another. For if men that are  ingenuous will call to minde the end first, for which God doth give them  all their Talents, and then also for which men of publick Spirits have  erected Colleges and Universities, and endowed the same with long and  competent maintenances; that such as are fit for Studies, and called to  bee Instrumental in the propagation of Truth and Virtue, might not bee  distracted with the care of the World, in reference to outward matters,  but might have all the conveniences which are imaginable to improve  those Talents to the utmost, either singly, or conveniently with others,  if (I saie) ingenuous Christians would minde these ends, for which the  benefit of their Talents from God and of their accommodations from men  to improve those Talents are bestowed upon them: it would not bee  possible for them; to be so unthankful towards God, and avers from the  rule of Christianitie, and from the love of doing good to the generation  wherein they live; that they should intend to lead a Collegial life  onely for their own private eas and conveniencie in outward things; that  beeing accommodated with all necessarie helps of the Bodie, they may  pleas themselvs onely in the cours of their Studies, with that  Reservation and Retiredness, which is proper to a Monkish life in Popish  Cloisters; wherein the Spirit of Mutual envie, of detraction and  division is more irreconcilably entertained, then in anie other  Societies of the World. For their Cloister-constitutions, obliging them  onely to the observation of som formal works as an _opus operatum_; for  which their maintenance is allowed them; they not knowing anie further  design of their life, or any greater happiness in this World, then to  pleas themselvs; bestow all the rest of their time and thoughts, as  their natural inclinations lead them, which is commonly to nothing els  but to self-love and Pride, which became a Provocation unto others, to  discover mutually their corruptions, which by reaction make them all  full of envie, of hatred, of evil surmises, and of malicious practices  one against another: so that no where Satan doth dwel and rule more  effectually, then in those Religious Houses, as they are falsly so  called. How much of this Monkish disposition doth remain as yet in the  formal Constitutions of Colleges, or in the Spirits of those that  partake of Collegial accommodations, is not a thing which I shall take  upon me to Judg; but I shall leav it to God, and to his daie to  discover; onely I would bee glad that all such as are"]]]
