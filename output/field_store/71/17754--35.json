The one word \"male\" shut women out in the old days from these easy  avenues to citizenship and to-day her path by the state by state  method is beset by almost insuperable difficulties.          CHAPTER III.    ELECTION LAWS AND REFERENDA      To establish a \"government of the people\" is to follow an ideal set  by the growth of democratic principles, but, after such government has  been established by a constitution, it remains to be determined how  the will of the people is to be recorded and each state accordingly  has enacted an election law to provide for registration and for  taking the vote. These laws are so defective as to give unquestioned  advantage to dishonesty and corruption in most elections upon  referendum questions. In several states there is little doubt that  suffrage amendments have been lost through fraud. All the suffragists  in Michigan seem to agree that the amendment was counted out in the  first campaign of 1912 and that ballot boxes were stuffed in the  second, 1913. Willis E. Reed, Attorney General of Nebraska, has  declared that he believes the amendment was counted out in that  state. An investigation has revealed forty-seven varieties of fraud  or violation of the election law in forty-four counties in the Iowa  suffrage election of June 5, 1916. Given a group determined to prevent  women from getting the vote, a group provided with money and knowing  no scruple, and the inadequacy of the law in many States offers  a positive guarantee at the outset of a campaign that a suffrage  amendment will be lost.    If suffrage amendments are defeated by illegal practices, why not  demand redress, asks the novice in suffrage campaigns. Ah, there's the  rub. In twenty-four states, no provision has been made by the election  law for any form of contest or recount on a referendum nor are  precedents for a recount found. Political corrupters may, in these  states, bribe voters, colonize voters and repeat them to their hearts'  content and redress of any kind is practically impossible. If clear  evidence of fraud could be produced a case might be brought to the  courts and the guilty parties might be punished, but the election  would stand. In New York, in 1915, the question was submitted to the  voters as to whether a constitutional convention should be called.  The convention was ordered by a majority of about 1,500. Later the  District Attorney of New York City found proof that at least 800  fraudulent votes had been cast in that city. Leading lawyers discussed  the question of effect upon the election and the general opinion among  them was that, even though the entire majority, and more, should  be found to be fraudulent, the election could not be set aside. The  convention was held.    In the other twenty-three states,[A] contests on referenda seem  possible under the law, but in practically every one, the contest  means a resort to the courts and in only eight[B] of these is  reference made to a recount. The law is vague and incomplete in nearly  all of these States. In some of these, including Michigan, where the  suffrage amendment is declared to have been counted out, application  for a recount must be made in each voting precinct. To have secured  redress in Michigan, provided the fraud was widespread, as it is  believed to have been, it would have been necessary to have secured  definite evidence of fraud in a probable 1,000 precincts and to have  instituted as many cases. This would have consumed many months and  would have demanded thousands of dollars.    [Footnote A: In Ohio, New Mexico, Wyoming, Utah, New Jersey, Minnesota  and Michigan by law; in Illinois, Texas, New Hampshire, Massachusetts,  Oregon, Arizona and Iowa by precedent; in West Virginia, South Dakota,  Kentucky and Colorado, officials express the opinion that the  law governing candidates's contests could be stretched to cover  amendments. In Pennsylvania, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and  Washington, the law is so fragmentary as to make the possibilities  very uncertain. Information on this last group of laws will be found  in Appendix B.]    [Footnote B: Ohio, Texas, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Minnesota,  Michigan, Massachusetts and Utah.]    In some States the courts decide what the redress shall be, but where  such provision exists, no assurance is given by the law that such  redress will include a correction of the returns. In at least seven  States,[A] the applicants must pay all costs if they fail to prove  their case a provision amounting to a penalty imposed upon those who  try to enforce the law.    [Footnote A: Illinois, Michigan, Nebraska, New Jersey, West Virginia,  Minnesota, Utah.]    The penalties for bribery range from $5 to $2,000 and from thirty  days' to ten years' imprisonment, but only one state (Ohio) provides  in definite terms for punishment of bribery as a part of the penalty  in an election contest. In most cases proof of bribery does not throw  out the vote of briber or bribed, nor does an action to throw  out purchased votes in contest cases bring with it automatically  punishment of the purchased voter. This omission from the contest  provisions presupposes that these bribery cases would be separate  actions. Thirty-two states in clear terms disfranchise (or give the  Legislature power to disfranchise) bribers and bribed, but few make  provision for the method of actually enforcing the law, and upon  inquiry the Secretary of State of many of these states reported  that, so far as he knew, no man had ever been disfranchised for  this offense. This was true of states which have been notorious for  political corruption.    From Ohio alone has evidence been found of the actual enforcement  of the disfranchisement provision. In this state nearly 1,800 bribed  voters of Adams County were disfranchised in 1910 for scandalous  and well-remembered corruption but in 1915 they were restored to  citizenship. These cases reveal a disgraceful provision in the Ohio  law, by which the briber is given immunity if he will turn State's  evidence on the bribed; the vote-buyer may purchase votes by the  thousands with perfect safety provided that when suspected he will  deliver up a few of the bought by way of example.    With a vague, uncertain law to define their punishment in most states,  and no law at all in twenty-four states, as a preliminary security,  corrupt opponents of a woman suffrage amendment find many additional  aids to their nefarious acts. A briber must make sure that the bribed  carries out his part of the contract. Whenever it is easy to check  up the results of the bribe, corruption may reign supreme with little  risk of being found out. A study of some of the recent suffrage votes  gives significant food for reflection. It shows how the form, color  and arrangement of the ballot may help the corrupt politician to  organize ignorant voters to do his will. In Georgia and Louisiana no  party names are printed on the official ballot and emblems only are  used. In almost half our states, though the party name is used also,  the emblem is the real guide. New York does not even relegate this  emblem to the top of the column. The emblem is placed before the name  of each candidate, so that the illiterate voter can make no mistake in  recognizing the sign of the machine which controls his vote. Scarcely  more than a dozen states have the headless ballot[A] which makes  it impossible for politicians to make corrupt use of the illiterate  voter.    [Footnote A: Oregon, Nevada, South Carolina, Florida, Colorado,  California, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, Massachusetts,  Mississippi, Nebraska, Pennsylvania.]    In Wisconsin suffrage referendum the suffrage ballot was separate and  pink. It was easy to teach the most illiterate how to vote \"No\" and  to check up returns with considerable accuracy. In New York there  were three ballots. The official ballot had emblems which easily  distinguished it. The other two were exactly alike in shape, size and  color and each contained three propositions: those which came from  the constitutional convention and the other those which came from the  Legislature. The orders went forth to vote down the constitutional  provisions and it was done by a majority of 482,000, or nearly  300,000 more than the majority against woman suffrage. On the  ballot containing the suffrage amendment, which was No. 1, there was  proposition No. 3, which all the political parties wanted carried and  to which no one objected. It could easily be found by all illiterates  as it contained more lines of printing, yet so difficult was it to  teach ignorant men to vote \"Yes\" on that one proposition that, despite  the fact that orders had gone forth to all the state that No. 3 was to  be carried, it barely squeezed through.    In Pennsylvania there are no emblems to distinguish the tickets and  on the large ballot the suffrage amendment was difficult to find by  an untutored voter. In probable consequence Pennsylvania polled the  largest proportional vote for the amendment of any eastern state. In  Massachusetts the ballot was small and the suffrage amendment could be  easily picked out by a bribed voter. In Iowa the suffrage ballot was  separate and yellow while the main ballots were white.    In the North Dakota referendum the regular ballot was long and  complicated and the suffrage ballot separate and small. It was easy to  teach the dullest illiterate how to vote \"No.\" It might be said  that it would be equally easy to teach him to vote \"Yes.\" True, but  suffragists never bribe. Both the briber and the illiterate are allies  of the opposition.    A referendum on a non-partisan issue has none of the protection  accorded a party question.

This covers large spaces quickly, but the compass is less accurate  than the pace.     3. Tape.  Lines of taping must be well planned, with triangle ties to secure  the angles. Pulling up straight is difficult in a wind, especially on  broken ground, and one per cent. error is quite possible then. When  working alone peg the tape down by the ring, or round a stone.     4. Tapes and cross lines.  Stretch two strings crossing squarely on the ground: fix the square  by laying a squared drawing block below and looking at strings over  it. Two helpers each hold a tape, zero on a string, and the two tapes  are held together by the observer and read off, giving the distance  to each string; this is to be plotted at once on squared paper, and  the plan is completed in detail as it progresses, without any note-  book or later plotting. The helpers must be capable of holding the  tape square to the string. Good for sites up to two hundred or three  hundred feet.     5. Plane table.  Excellent for some ground, where objects are visible from a distance:  otherwise it requires a marker put up at every point to be fixed.  Cumbrous to carry, much slower than 4.     6. Box sextant, used as giving angular accuracy to any of the  foregoing; most useful with taping, and in following.     7. Sextant and three points.  The most rapid accurate method is to adopt three points visible all  over the ground (as trees or chimneys) or set up three markers. Find  shape and size of this triangle. Then at any point take two angles  visible between the points, and this fixes position of observer. A  large site may have forty points fixed in two hours thus to about 1  in 1000. For detail and plotting see Petrie, _Methods and Aims in  Archaeology_.     8. Theodolite.  For the most accurate work a theodolite is used, giving points to  about 1 in 5000. It is almost essential for any astronomical meridian  or latitude.    None of these methods necessitate any helper, except 4 which needs  two helpers. The observation is from the point to be fixed in 1, 2,  3, 4, and 7; but it is _to_ the point, needing signals or visible  features on the points, in 5, 6, and 8, and for those methods a large  stock of rods must be taken, and the whole ground gone over, before  the work of observation; such methods take far more time than the  others. The able surveyor will know by instinct how to use all the  inferior methods as supplements to the higher, whenever time demands  and accuracy allows.    When first searching a site, note the direction of any wall to the  horizon point, and so see if other walls are parallel.    In all cases a plumb line is wanted for alining foundations and  scattered blocks. Always carry six feet of thin string, and pick up  the nearest suitable stone for a weight, up to three or four pounds  in a wind.     5. Drawing and Copying.          Inscriptions.  If there is any chance of being interrupted by any claimant, or by  crowds, always make a hand copy at once, as quickly as possible.  After a squeeze or photograph is taken, yet the hand copy is often of  value to explain positions of squeeze slips or detail of photographs.    If there is no chance of interruption, then a carefully drawn copy  full size should be made. For this a dry squeeze is the ground work.  Lay a sheet of thin paper, such as thin wrapping or plain paper, on  the stone, and press all the letters over with the fingers, so as to  make a sharp bend; a break in the deep hollows does not matter. Then,  putting the paper on a drawing-board or sheet of millboard, cock it  up so that the shadow of the squeeze is seen, and draw over the lines  (starting at right base), referring to the stone whenever uncertain.  This is the only right way to copy hieroglyphics by hand. Note that  the edges are usually rather worn, and the drawn lines should be  inside the squeeze lines. If the stone is large, several lesser  sheets are best.    Where there is writing, or the relief is too faint to squeeze, put  the paper immediately below the first line, and draw it sign for  sign, so that the spacing is preserved and no omission is possible.  Fold back the paper as each line is copied, and so always keep the  copying close below the line of inscription.    If the signs are in an alphabet that is not familiar, refer to the  table of alphabets.    Sculpture  Sculpture in low relief can be copied best by dry squeeze. As the  connexion of the sheets used should be exact, put up the first sheet  truly vertical, and mark little pencil crosses at the corners on the  stone. Then the corners of successive sheets should be fitted into  the angles of the crosses. When inking in the pencil drawings, do not  carry the lines within two inches of the edges of the sheets. Then  place sheets edge to edge, adjust them to fit as best they may,  weight them heavily with books, turn back one edge and weight it, and  then slip a strip of wetted adhesive paper half-way under the edge  that is down; at once liberate the edge that is up, and dab (not rub)  both heavily down on the adhesive. This makes a joint free of  cockling, and when dry the inking can be completed across the joint.  Where there is any colour remaining on sculpture or inscription, only  dry squeezing is permissible.    Where signs are worn or decayed it is needful to try various  lighting. This can be done in the open air, by shading the part by  the hands placed around it as a sort of tube, the head blocking out  the light over the tube. Then quickly raise a hand alternately, so as  to reverse the oblique lighting, and watch the effect on the sign.    If the stone has not too tender a face, careful washing often brings  out an inscription; and in such cases it is usually far easier to  copy from a wet than from a dry stone.    If reliefs have been much weathered they can be made plain for  photographing by laying horizontal and covering with sand; on wiping  away the sand from the relief the ground will be left flat sand, so  hiding the confused hollows of weathering.    The safest way for drawings to travel is to post them at the nearest  post direct to where they will be worked up. The Postal Union takes  rolls of 21 cm. thick, 60 cm. long, up to 5 kilos as parcels, or  rolls of 10 cm. thick, 75 cm. long, up to 2 kilos by book post open  at ends. This is far better than carrying rolls by hand.    Wet squeezing. Where there is no colour, and the stone is strong and  not crumbling, a wet squeeze is the best copy. There are three  purposes for it, and the method differs for each; (1) thin single  sheet kept fresh on the outer face for photographing later; or (2)  single sheet well beaten in and patched, depending on pricking the  outlines and hand-copy from it, or blacking over the relief on the  inner side and photographing; or (3) double sheet hard beaten, and  patched in the hollows, for plaster casting afterwards.    For (1) there is no need to get an impression of the hollows to the  bottom, and the face of the paper should be smooth. A soft paper,  with little or no size, and a soft clothes-brush will do well for  this. The sheet should cover the whole inscription, or have as few  joints as may be. The stone should be dabbed with a wet brush so as  to saturate the face, the sheet of paper well soaked in water laid  upon it, taking care not to leave bubbles, and then dabbing firmly  with the brush will drive the paper into the hollows. If the stone is  polished or very smooth, it is needful to peel off the paper while  wet by holding two corners, and lay it reversed on a flat surface to  dry; if left on the stone the contraction will destroy the impress.  Out of doors the paper can be held down by pebbles around it, or by  sand on the edges, to prevent the wind catching it.    (2) The stronger squeeze should be of a tough paper with moderate  sizing. Cut the paper to the form of the stone. Thrust it into a pail  of water, knead it about vigorously, roll it into a ball and pummel  it, so as to break the grain and let the water well into it. Then wet  the stone, shake out the paper like a wet handkerchief, full of  creases, lay it on the stone and begin to beat it in with a hard,  long spoke-brush. A few strokes round the edge will catch it down so  that the wind does not disturb it. Then begin to beat it heavily  along the top edge; beat it to a pulp, and patch with strips left  soaking in the water wherever breaks occur. If the stone is porous  the paper may part from it, especially if expanded by beating; the  only course then is to slush more water on the face so that it will  go through the breaks and hold the paper down again. It may be  needful to slit the paper to let the water go below it. Beat down  again, enough to fix it.    (3) For casting purposes a final backing sheet, moderately beaten on,  is needed to hold the squeeze together and stiffen it. Either (2) or  (3) can be left on the face of the stone till quite dry, and then  carefully detached by lifting up from one corner, and slipping a  dinner-knife or a slip of wood under the paper to lift any part that  sticks.    Stiff squeezes as (3) must be packed flat; thin, as (1) and sometimes  (2), may be rolled in a large curve, but this always deteriorates a  squeeze.    For plaster casting, a squeeze should be heated on a stove and  brushed over with melted paraffin, or better wax, sufficient to cover  the face without choking the finer detail. Before each cast the face  should be lightly oiled with a tuft of wool.    Small objects.  These can be copied by a thin paper squeeze, and the squeeze may be  mounted by pasting a card and lightly pressing the squeeze back down  on it. This will take out all cockling and make it lie flat for  photographing.    Tin-foil is very handy for squeezes, and may be saved from chocolate  for this. Press it firmly on a coin or seal with a tuft of wool, or  beat it with a soft tooth-brush, being "]]]
