In my opinion this       explanation that the change in the waypoint was thought to be       minimal in terms of distance is a concocted story designed to       explain away the fundamental mistake, made by someone, in failing       to ensure that Captain Collins was notified that his aircraft was       now programmed to fly on a collision course with Mt. Erebus.    These paragraphs are attacked on the grounds, in short, that the members  of the navigation section said to be adversely affected by  them--according to the applicants, Mr R. Brown as regards (e) and Messrs  Amies, Brown, Hewitt and Lawton as regards (f)--were not given a fair  opportunity of answering the findings or allegations.    To understand this complaint one needs a clear picture of what it was  that the Commission found or alleged against the navigation section.  When studying the report as a whole we have encountered difficulties in  this regard, difficulties not altogether removed when we explored them  during the argument with Mr Baragwanath. But our understanding is that  in essence the Commissioner suggests that the original change of the  southernmost point to one in the Sound, 25 miles west of McMurdo  Station, was probably deliberate on the part of the navigation section  (although he refrained from a definite finding) and that in November  1979 they deliberately made a major change back to the vicinity of  McMurdo Station but deliberately set out to conceal the change from the  American personnel there. The motive for the 1979 change ascribed by the  Commissioner to the navigation section appears to be that they  considered that the New Zealand Civil Aviation Division had only  approved a route over Mount Erebus, yet at the same time that the  American 'authorities' would object to that route, regarding the route  down the Sound as safer. In short the theory (if we understand it  correctly) is that the navigation section were in a dilemma as there was  no route approved by all concerned.    Beyond argument, it would seem, there was slipshod work within the  airline in the making of the change and the failure to expressly notify  flight crews. But the allegations of deliberate concealment and a  concocted story are another matter. The complaint is that they were  never put squarely to the members of the navigation section. The  Commissioner himself did put to the chief navigator, Mr Hewitt, that  'Someone may suggest before the inquiry is over' that the word 'McMurdo'  was relayed to McMurdo to conceal a long-standing error in the  co-ordinates. Mr Hewitt replied 'Certainly not, sir' and there, the  applicants point out, the matter was left, without further questions to  witnesses by anyone or any reference in counsel's final submissions.    On the other hand Mr Baragwanath urged in substance that the witnesses  from the navigation section must have understood that their evidence was  under suspicion; that they had ample opportunities to explain how and  why any mistakes occurred; and that it was for the Commissioner to  assess their explanations, taking into account any impressions they made  on him individually as witnesses.      Captain Eden    First Officer Rhodes, an accident inspector, had been one of the party  who went to the Antarctica very shortly after the crash. He was  representing the Air Line Pilots Association as well as working with  others in the party. When he first gave evidence at the inquiry he was  called by counsel for the association. Apparently concern was felt by  the airline that some of his evidence might be taken to reflect on  Captain Gemmell (the Flight Manager, Technical, and former Chief Pilot)  so First Officer Rhodes was recalled as a witness by counsel for the  airline. He said that he had 'no reason to doubt Captain Gemmell in any  way shape or form'. There was some cross-examination by counsel for the  association but no reference was made to Captain Eden in any of the  questions. The Commissioner said in paragraph 348 of his report:         348. Captain Eden is at present the director of flight operations       for the airline. He appeared in the witness box to be a       strong-minded and aggressive official. It seemed clear from this       further production of First Officer Rhodes as a witness that it had       been suggested to him by Captain Eden that he should either make a       direct allegation against Captain Gemmell or else make no       allegation at all, and that since First Officer Rhodes seemed to       have no direct evidence in his possession, he was therefore obliged       to give the answer which Captain Eden had either suggested or       directed. However, First Officer Rhodes was not entirely       intimidated because as will be observed from the evidence just       quoted, he insisted on saying that Captain Gemmell had brought an       envelope containing documents back to Auckland.    Exception is taken to that paragraph as making findings of intimidation  against Captain Eden without any such allegation ever having been put to  him. Captain Eden gave evidence later in the inquiry than First Officer  Rhodes and the transcript shows that he was asked nothing by anyone  about their discussion.      Captain Gemmell    The following paragraphs of the report are attacked for their references  to this senior officer:         352. As to the ring-binder notebook, it had been returned to Mrs       Collins by an employee of the airline, but all the pages of the       notebook were missing. Captain Gemmell was asked about this in       evidence. He suggested that, the pages might have been removed       because they had been damaged by kerosene. However, the ring-binder       notebook itself, which was produced at the hearing, was entirely       undamaged.         353. After the evidence given before the Commission had concluded,       I gave some thought to the matters just mentioned. I knew that the       responsibility for recovering all property on the crash site lay       exclusively with the New Zealand Police Force, and that they had       grid-searched the entire site. All property recovered had been       placed in a large store at McMurdo Base, which was padlocked, and       access to the shed was only possible through a senior sergeant of       Police. I asked counsel assisting the Commission to make inquiries       about the flight bags which had been located on the site but which       had not been returned to Mrs Collins or Mrs Cassin.         354. The Royal New Zealand Air Force helicopter pilot who flew the       property from the crash site to McMurdo remembered either one or       two crew flight bags being placed aboard his helicopter, and he       said that they were then flown by him to McMurdo. This was       independently confirmed by the loadmaster of the helicopter, who       recollected seeing the flight bags. The senior sergeant of Police       in charge of the McMurdo store was spoken to, and he recollected       either one or two flight bags among other property awaiting packing       for return to New Zealand. He said that personnel from Air New       Zealand had access to the store, as well as the chief inspector,       and the senior sergeant said that he thought that he had given the       flight bags to the chief inspector and that the chief inspector was       the sole person to whom he had released any property. The chief       inspector was then interviewed on 11 December 1980 by telephone,       being at that time in Australia, but he said that no flight bags       were ever handed to him.       ...         359. The following facts seemed to emerge:         (1) The two flight bags were lodged in the Police store at McMurdo       and would have been returned in due course to Mrs Collins and Mrs       Cassin by the Police. But they were taken away from the store by       someone and have not since been seen.       ...    These paragraphs followed a discussion by the Commissioner of a  submission by counsel for the Pilots Association that a number of  documents which would have tended to support the proposition that  Captain Collins had relied upon the incorrect co-ordinates had not been  located; and in that context the Commissioner recorded Captain Gemmell's  denial that he had recovered any documents relevant to the flight which  had not been handed over to the chief inspector. There was also a  reference shortly afterwards in the report to Captain Gemmell having  brought back some quantity of documents with him from Antarctica. On its  own this would be innocuous, but it is part of a context which could  lead to inferences adverse to Captain Gemmell being drawn from the  paragraphs complained of.    The applicants say that there was a mistake of fact, no evidence of  probative value and no fair opportunity to answer the criticisms or  findings which they claim to be implicit in these paragraphs. The last  point, the natural justice one, has a special feature in the case of  Captain Gemmell. The applicants say that the findings, apart from one  made under mistake (paragraph 352), were based on information or  evidence gathered by the Commissioner after the public hearings; and  that, while an opportunity of meeting the new matter was given to the  Chief Inspector of Air Accidents, none was given to Air New Zealand or  Captain Gemmell.    Another special feature is that the Commissioner himself ultimately  concluded (paragraph 360) 'However, there is not sufficient evidence to  justify any finding on my part that Captain Gemmell recovered documents  from Antarctica which were relevant to the fatal flight, and which he  did not account for to the proper authorities'.      Alleged 'Orchestration'    We now come to the most serious complaint. It concerns paragraph 377 of  the report, a paragraph building up to a quotable phrase that has become  well known in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16131"],[0,"Campaign Pictures of the War in South Africa (1899-1900) (#4)"],[1,"  \"rather thank God you are a living man this moment. It was His hand that  saved you; nothing else could have done so.\" He spoke reverently; there was  no cant in the sentiment he uttered--his face was too open, too manly, too  fearless for hypocrisy. \"How long is it since I was knocked over?\" \"About  three hours.\" \"Is my comrade dead?\" \"Quite dead,\" the Boer replied; \"death  came instantly to him. He was shot through the brain.\" \"Poor beggar!\" I  muttered, \"and he'll have to rot on the open veldt, I suppose?\"    The Boer leader's face flushed angrily. \"Do you take us for savages?\" he  said. \"Rest easy. Your friend will get decent burial. What was his rank?\"  \"War correspondent.\" \"And your own?\" \"War correspondent also. My papers are  in my pocket somewhere.\" \"Sir,\" said the Boer leader, \"you dress exactly  like two British officers; you ride out with a fighting party, you try to  ride off at a gallop under the very muzzles of our rifles when we tell you  to surrender. You can blame no one but yourselves for this day's work.\" \"I  blame no man; I played the game, and am paying the penalty.\" Then they told  me how poor Lambie's horse had swerved between myself and them after Lambie  had fallen, then they saw me fall forward in the saddle, and they knew I  was hit. A few strides later one of them had sent a bullet through my  horse's head, and he had rolled on top of me. Yet, with it all, I had  escaped with a graze over the right temple and a badly knocked-up shoulder.  Truly, as the Boer said, the hand of God must have shielded me.    For a day and a half I lay at that laager whilst our wounded men were  brought in, and here I should like to say a word to the people of England.  Our men, when wounded, are treated by the Boers with manly gentleness and  kind consideration. When we left the laager in an open trolly, we, some  half-dozen Australians, and about as many Boers, all wounded, were driven  for some hours to a small hospital, the name of which I do not know. It was  simply a farmhouse turned into a place for the wounded. On the road thither  we called at many farms, and at every one men, women, and children came out  to see us. Not one taunting word was uttered in our hearing, not one  braggart sentence passed their lips. Men brought us cooling drinks, or  moved us into more comfortable positions on the trolly. Women, with gentle  fingers, shifted bandages, or washed wounds, or gave us little dainties  that come so pleasant in such a time; whilst the little children crowded  round us with tears running down their cheeks as they looked upon the  bloodstained khaki clothing of the wounded British. Let no man or woman in  all the British Empire whose son or husband lies wounded in the hands of  the Boers fear for his welfare, for it is a foul slander to say that the  Boers do not treat their wounded well. England does not treat her own men  better than the Boers treat the wounded British, and I am writing of that  which I have seen and know beyond the shadow of a doubt.    From the little farmhouse hospital I was sent on in an ambulance train to  the hospital at Springfontein, where all the nurses and medical staff are  foreigners, all of them trained and skilful. Even the nurses had a  soldierly air about them. Here everything was as clean as human industry  could make it, and the hospital was worked like a piece of military  mechanism. I only had a day or two here, and then I was sent by train in an  ambulance carriage to the capital of the Orange Free State, and here I am  in Bloemfontein Hospital. There are a lot of our wounded here, both  officers and men, some of whom have been here for months.    I have made it my business to get about amongst the private soldiers, to  question them concerning the treatment they have received since the moment  the Mauser rifles tumbled them over, and I say emphatically that in every  solitary instance, without one single exception, our countrymen declare  that they have been grandly treated. Not by the hospital nurses only, not  by the officials alone, but by the very men whom they were fighting. Our  \"Tommies\" are not the men to waste praise on any men unless it is well  deserved, but this is just about how \"Tommy\" sums up the situation:    \"The Boer is a rough-looking beggar in the field, 'e don't wear no uniform,  'nd 'e don't know enough about soldiers' drill to keep himself warm, but 'e  can fight in 'is own bloomin' style, which ain't our style. If 'e'd come  out on the veldt, 'nd fight us our way, we'd lick 'im every time, but when  it comes to fightin' in the kopjes, why, the Boer is a dandy, 'nd if the  rest of Europe don't think so, only let 'em have a try at 'im 'nd see. But  when 'e has shot you he acts like a blessed Christian, 'nd bears no malice.  'E's like a bloomin' South Sea cocoanut, not much to look at outside, but  white 'nd sweet inside when yer know 'im, 'nd it's when you're wounded 'nd  a prisoner that you get a chance to know 'im, see.\" And \"Tommy\" is about  correct in his judgment.    The Boers have made most excellent provision for the treatment of wounded  after battle. All that science can do is done. Their medical men fight as  hard to save a British life or a British limb as medical men in England  would battle to save life or limb of a private person. At the Bloemfontein  Hospital everything is as near perfection, from a medical and surgical  point, as any sane man can hope to see. It is an extensive institution. One  end is set apart for the Boer wounded, the other for the British. No  difference is made between the two in regard to accommodation--food,  medical attendance, nursing, or visiting. Ministers of religion come and go  daily--almost hourly--at both ends. Our men, when able to walk, are allowed  to roam around the grounds, but, of course, are not allowed to go beyond  the gates, being prisoners of war. Concerning our matron (Miss M.M. Young)  and nurses, all I can say is that they are gentlewomen of the highest type,  of whom any nation in the world might well be proud.    I have met one or two old friends since I came here, notably Lieutenant  Bowling, of the Australian Horse, who is now able to get about, and is  cheerful and jolly. Lieutenant Bowling has his right thumb shot off, and  had a terribly close call for his life, a Mauser bullet going into his head  alongside his right eye, and coming out just in front of the right ear. His  friends need not be anxious concerning him; he is quite out of danger, and  he and I have killed a few tedious hours blowing tobacco smoke skywards,  and chatting about life in far off Australia. Another familiar face was  that of an English private, named Charles Laxen, of the Northumberlands,  who was wounded at Stormberg. I am told that he displayed excellent pluck  before he was laid out, firstly by a piece of shell on the side of the  head, and, later, by a Mauser bullet through the left knee. He is getting  along O.K., but will never see service as a soldier again on account of the  wounded leg.    I had written to the President of the Orange Free State, asking him to  grant me my liberty on the ground that I was a non-combatant. Yesterday Mr.  Steyn courteously sent his private secretary and carriage to the hospital  with an intimation that I should be granted an interview. I was accordingly  driven down to what I believe was the Stadt House. In Australia we should  term it the Town Hall. The President met me, and treated me very  courteously, and, after chatting over my capture and the death of my  friend, he informed me that I might have my liberty as soon as I considered  myself sufficiently recovered to travel. He offered me a pass _via_  Lourenco Marques, but I pointed out that if I were sent that way I should  be so far away from my work as to be practically useless to my paper. The  President explained to me that it was not his wish nor the desire of his  colleagues to hamper me in any way in regard to my work. \"What we want more  than anything else,\" remarked the President, \"is that the world shall know  the truth, and nothing but the truth, in reference to this most unhappy  war, and we will not needlessly place obstruction in your way in your  search for facts; if we can by any means place you in the British lines we  will do so. If we find it impossible to do that you must understand that  there is some potent reason for it.\" So I let that question drop, feeling  satisfied that everything that a sensible man has a right to ask would be  done on my behalf.    President Steyn is a man of a notable type. He is a big man physically,  tall and broad, a man of immense strength, but very gentle in his manner,  as so many exceptionally strong men are. He has a typical Dutch face, calm,  strong, and passionless. A man not easily swayed by outside agencies; one  of those persons who think long and earnestly before embarking upon a  venture, but, when once started, no human agency would turn him back from  the line of conduct he had mapped out for himself. He is no ignorant  back-block politician, but a refined, cultured gentleman, who knows the  full strength of the British Empire; and, knowing it, he has defied it in  all its might, and will follow his convictions to the bitter end, no matter  what that end may be. He introduced me to a couple of gentlemen whose names  are very dear to the Free Staters, viz., Messrs. Fraser and Fischer, and  whilst the interview lasted nothing was talked of but the war, and it  struck me very forcibly that not one of those men had any hatred in their  hearts towards the British people. \"This,\" said the President, \"is not a  war between us and the British people on any question of principle; it is a  war forced upon us by a band of capitalistic adventurers, who have  hoodwinked the British public and dragged them into an unholy, an unjust  struggle with a people whose only desire was to live at peace with all men.  We do not hate your nation; we"]]]
