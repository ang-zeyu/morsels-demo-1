To the Present Time, Volume 11 (of 12) (#4)"],[1,"of Heliopolis, and Tiberius returned  it to the priests of that city as its rightful owners. Another proof of  the equal justice with which this province was governed was to be seen  in the buildings then carried on by the priests in Upper Egypt. We find  the name of Tiberius carved in hieroglyphics on additions or repairs  made to the temples at Thebes, at Aphroditopolis, at Berenice, on the  Red Sea, at Philae, and at the Greek city of Parembole, in Nubia. The  great portico was at this time added to the temple at Tentyra, with an  inscription dedicating it to the goddess in Greek and in hieroglyphics.  As a building is often the work of years, while sculpture is only the  work of weeks, so the fashion of the former is always far less changing  than that of the latter. The sculptures on the walls of this beautiful  portico are crowded and graceless; while, on the other hand, the  building itself has the same grand simplicity and massive strength that  we find in the older temples of Upper Egypt.    We cannot but admire the zeal of the Egyptians by whom this work  was then finished. They were treated as slaves by their Greek  fellow-countrymen; their houses were ransacked every third year by  military authority in search of arms; they could have had no help from  their Roman masters, who only drained the province of its wealth; and  the temple had perhaps never been heard of by the emperor, who could  have been little aware that the most lasting monument of his reign was  being raised in the distant province of Egypt.    [Illustration: 024.jpg TEMPLE AT TENTYRA, ENLARGED BY ROMAN ARCHITECTS]    The priests of the other parts of the country sent gifts out of their  poverty in aid of this pious work; and among the figures on the walls  we see those of forty cities, from Semneh, at the second cataract, to  Memphis and Sais, in the Delta, each presenting an offering to the god  of the temple.    In the third year of this reign Germanicus Caesar, who, much against his  will, had been sent into the East as governor, found time to leave his  own province, and to snatch a hasty view of the time-honoured buildings  of Egypt. Descending the river to Thebes, and, while gazing on the  huge remains of the temples, he asked the priests to read to him the  hieroglyphical writing on the walls. He was told that it recounted the  greatness of the country in the time of King Ramses, when there were  seven hundred thousand Egyptians of an age to bear arms; and that  with these troops Ramses had conquered the Libyans, Ethiopians, Medes,  Persians, Bactrians, Scythians, Syrians, Armenians, Cappadocians,  Bithynians, and Lycians. He was also told the tributes laid upon each  of those nations; the weight of gold and silver, the number of chariots  and horses, the gifts of ivory and scents for the temples, and the  quantity of grain which the conquered provinces sent to feed the  population of Thebes. After listening to the musical statue of  Amenhothes, Germanicus went on to Elephantine and Syene; and, on his  return, he turned aside to the pyramids and the Lake of Mceris, which  regulated the overflow of the Nile on the neighbouring fields. At  Memphis, Germanicus consulted the sacred bull Apis as to his future  fortune, and met with an unfavourable answer. The manner of consulting  Apis was for the visitor to hold out some food in his hand, and the  answer was understood to be favourable if the bull turned his head  to eat, but unfavourable if he looked another way. When Germanicus  accordingly held out a handful of grain, the well-fed animal turned his  head sullenly towards the other side of his stall; and on the death of  this young prince, which shortly followed, the Egyptians did not  forget to praise the bull's foresight. This blameless and seemingly  praiseworthy visit of Germanicus did not, however, escape the notice  of the jealous Tiberius. He had been guilty of gaining the love of the  people by walking about without guards, in a plain Greek dress, and of  lowering the price of grain in a famine by opening the public granaries;  and Tiberius sternly reproached him with breaking the known law of  Augustus, by which no Roman citizen of consular or even of equestrian  rank might enter Alexandria without leave from the emperor.    There were at this time about a million of Jews in Egypt. In Alexandria  they seem to have been about one-third of the population, as they  formed the majority in two wards out of the five into which the city was  divided. They lived under their own elders and Sanhedrim, going up at  their solemn feasts to worship in their own temple at Onion; but, from  their mixing with the Greeks, they had become less strict than their  Hebrew brethren in their observance of the traditions. Some few of them,  however, held themselves in obedience to the Sanhedrim in Jerusalem, and  looked upon the temple of Jerusalem as the only Jewish temple; and these  men were in the habit of sending an embassy on the stated solemn feasts  of the nation to offer the appointed sacrifices and prayers to Jahveh  in the holy city on their behalf. But though the decree by Caesar, which  declared that the Jews were Alexandrian citizens, was engraved on a  pillar in the city, yet they were by no means treated as such, either by  the government, or by the Greeks, or by the Egyptians.    [Illustration: 027.jpg ON THE BANKS OF THE NILE.]    When, during the famine, the public granaries seemed unable to supply  the whole city with food, even the humane Germanicus ordered that the  Jews, like the Egyptians, should have no share of the gift. They were  despised even by the Egyptians themselves, who, to insult them, said  that the wicked god Typhon had two sons, Hierosolymus and Judaeus, and  that from these the Jews were descended.    In the neighbourhood of Alexandria, on a hill near the shores of the  Lake Mareotis, was a little colony of Jews, who, joining their own  religion with the mystical opinions and gloomy habits of the Egyptians,  have left us one of the earliest known examples of the monastic life.  They bore the name of Therapeutae. They had left, says Philo, their  worldly wealth to their families or friends; they had forsaken wives,  children, brethren, parents, and the society of men, to bury themselves  in solitude and pass their lives in the contemplation of the divine  essence. Seized by this heavenly love, they were eager to enter upon the  next world, as though they were already dead to this. Every one, whether  man or woman, lived alone in his cell or monastery, caring for neither  food nor raiment, but having his thoughts wholly turned to the Law and  the Prophets, or to sacred hymns of their own composing. They had their  God always in their thoughts, and even the broken sentences which they  uttered in their dreams were treasures of religious wisdom. They prayed  every morning at sunrise, and then spent the day in turning over the  sacred volumes, and the commentaries, which explained the allegories,  or pointed out a secondary meaning as hidden beneath the surface of even  the historical books of the Old Testament. At sunset they again prayed,  and then tasted their first and only meal. Selfdenial indeed was the  foundation of all their virtues. Some made only three meals in the week,  that their meditations might be more free; while others even attempted  to prolong their fast to the sixth day. During six days of the week they  saw nobody, not even one another. On the seventh day they met together  in the synagogue. Here they sat, each according to his age; the women  separated from the men. Each wore a plain, modest robe, which covered  the arms and hands, and they sat in silence while one of the elders  preached. As they studied the mystic powers of numbers, they thought the  number seven was a holy number, and that seven times seven made a great  week, and hence they kept the fiftieth day as a solemn festival. On that  day they dined together, the men on one side and the women on the other.  The rushy papyrus formed the couches; bread was their only meat, water  their drink, salt the seasoning, and cresses the delicacy. They would  keep no slaves, saying that all men were born equal. Nobody spoke,  unless it was to propose a question out of the Old Testament, or to  answer the question of another. The feast ended with a hymn of praise.    [Illustration: 029.jpg BEDOUIN TENT IN THE DESERT]    The ascetic Jews of Palestine, the Essenes on the banks of the Dead Sea,  by no means, according to Philo, thus quitted the active duties of life;  and it would seem that the Therapeutas rather borrowed their customs  from the country in which they had settled, than from any sects of the  Jewish nation. Some classes of the Egyptian priesthood had always held  the same views of their religious duties. These Egyptian monks slept on  a hard bed of palm branches, with a still harder wooden pillow for the  head; they were plain in their dress, slow in walking, spare in diet,  and scarcely allowed themselves to smile. They washed thrice a day, and  prayed as often; at sunrise, at noon, and at sunset. They often fasted  from animal food, and at all times refused many meats as unclean.  They passed their lives alone, either in study or wrapped in religious  thought. They never met one another but at set times, and were seldom  seen by strangers. Thus, leaving to others the pleasures, wealth, and  lesser prizes of this life, they received from them in return what most  men value higher, namely, honour, fame, and power.    The Romans, like the Greeks, feeling but little partiality in favour  of their own gods, were rarely guilty of intolerance against those of  others; and would hardly have checked the introduction of a new religion  unless it made its followers worse citizens. But in Rome, where  every act of its civil or military authorities was accompanied with a  religious rite, any slight towards the gods was a slight"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17332"],[0,"History of Egypt From 330 B.C. To the Present Time, Volume 12 (of 12) (#4)"],[1,"admiration to the Christians, whom he rendered so miserable  by his victories, and of whose power in Asia he had completed the  overthrow. Previous to his death, Saladm had divided the kingdom  between his three sons; El-Afdhal received Damascus, Southern Syria,  and Palestine, with the title of sultan; El-Aziz obtained the kingdom of  Egypt, and Ez Zahir the princedom of Aleppo.    El-Aziz undertook a campaign against Syria, but was defeated and obliged  to retreat to Cairo on account of a mutiny among his troops. El-Afdhal  pursued him, and had already pressed forward as far as Bilbeis, when  El-Adil, who had hitherto espoused his cause, fearing that he might  become too powerful, forced him to conclude a peace. The only advantage  he obtained was that he regained possession of Jerusalem and the  southern part of Syria. Soon after, El-Adil prevailed upon his nephew  Aziz, with whom he stood on friendly terms, to renew the war and to  take Damascus; El-Afdhal was betrayed, and only Sarchod was left to him,  whereas El-Adil occupied Damascus and forced Aziz to return to Egypt  again (June, 1196). After Aziz's death, in November, 1198, El-Afdhal was  summoned by some of the emirs to act as regent in Egypt. Others called  upon El-Adil to adopt the same course. El-Afdhal, however, became master  of Egypt, and besieged Damascus, reinforced by his brother Zahir, who  feared his uncle's ambition no less than himself. The agreement between  the brothers, however, did not last long; their armies separated, and  El-Afdhal was obliged to raise the siege and retreat to Egypt. He was  pursued by his uncle, and forced, after several skirmishes, to surrender  the capital and content himself once more with Sarchod and one or two  towns on the Euphrates (February, 1200). El-Adil ruled for a short time  in the name of El-Aziz's son; he soon came forward as sultan, forced  Zahir to recognise him as his suzerain, and appointed his son El-Muzzain  as governor of Damascus; the towns which belonged to him in Mesopotamia  were distributed among his other sons, and he thus became, to a certain  extent, the overlord of all the lands conquered by Saladin. His son,  El-Ashraf, later became lord of Chelat in Armenia, and his descendant,  Masud, Kamil's son, obtained possession of happy Arabia; so that the  name Malik Adil was pronounced in all the Moslem chancels from the  borders of Georgia to the Gulf of Aden.    [Illustration: 025.jpg VASE IN THE ABBOTT COLLECTION, NEW YORK]    El-Adil was so much engaged with wars against the Moslem princes,--the  princes of Nissibis and Mardin,--and also with repulsing El-Afdhal, who  wished to recover his lost kingdom, that he was unable to proceed with  any force against the Crusaders; he took unwilling measures against them  when they actually broke the peace, and was always ready to conclude  a new treaty. He took Jaffa by storm when the pilgrims, armed by Henry  VI., came to Palestine and interfered with the Moslem devotions, and  when the chancellor Conrad thereupon seized Sidon and Beirut, El-Adil  contented himself with laying waste the former town and hindering  the capture of the fortress Joron; Beirut he allowed to fall into  the enemy's hands. Still later he permitted several attacks of the  Christians--such as the devastation of the town Fuah, situated on the  Rosetta arm of the Nile--to pass unnoticed, and even bought peace at  the expense of the districts of Ramleh and Lydda, which had formerly  belonged to him. It was not until the year 1206 that he acted upon the  offensive against the regent, John of Ibelin, and even then he contented  himself with slight advantages and concluded a new truce for thirty  years.    Shortly before his death, El-Adil, like his brother Saladin, narrowly  escaped losing all his glory and the fruits of so many victories. Pope  Honorius III. had successfully aroused the zeal of the Western  nations for a new Crusade. Numerous well-armed and warlike-minded  pilgrims--among whom were King Andreas of Hungary and Duke Leopold of  Austria--landed at Acre in 1217, and King John of Jerusalem led them  against the Moslems. El-Adil hastened from Egypt to the scene of action,  but was forced to retreat to Damascus and to give up the whole of the  southern district, with the exception of the well-fortified holy town,  to be plundered by the Christians. In the following spring, whilst  El-Adil was in Syria, a Christian fleet sailed to Damietta, and besieged  the town. The attacking forces were composed of Germans and Hungarians,  who had embarked at Spalato on the Adriatic for St. Jean d'Acre, where  they spent a year in unfortunate expeditions and quarrels with the  Christians of Syria. They were joined by a fleet of three hundred boats  furnished by North Germans and Frisians, who, leaving the banks of  the Rhine, had journeyed there by way of the Straits of Gibraltar,  prolonging the journey by a year's fighting in Portugal.    The Christians then in Palestine had persuaded the Crusaders to begin  with an attack on Egypt, and they had therefore chosen to land at  Damietta. This was a large commercial town to the east of one of the  arms of the Nile, which was defended by three walls and a large tower  built on an island in the middle of the Nile, from which started the  chains that barred the river.    The Frisian sailors constructed a castle of wood, which was placed  between the masts of two ships, and from which the Crusaders were able  to leap to the tower, and thus they were able to blockade and starve  the town. The siege was long, and an epidemic breaking out among the  besiegers carried off a sixth of their number. The sultan tried to  succour the besieged by floating down the stream corpses of camels,  which were stuffed with provisions, but the Christians captured them. He  then offered to give the Crusaders, on condition they would depart,  the True Cross and all he possessed of the kingdom of Jerusalem; but  Pelagius, the papal legate,--a Spanish monk who had himself named  commander-in-chief,--rejected the offer.    El-Adil was so stunned by the news of the success of the Christians  that he died a few days after (August, 1218). El-Kamil, however, was not  discouraged; he not only defended Damietta, but also harassed the enemy  in their own camp by means of hordes of Bedouins. Not until he was  forced, by a conspiracy of his troops in favour of his brother El-Faiz,  to fly to Cairo, did the Christians succeed in getting across the Nile  and completely surrounding Damietta. Order was soon restored in  Egypt, owing to the arrival of Prince Muzzain, who had taken over the  government of Damascus on the death of his father. The rebels were  chastised, and both brothers proceeded towards Damietta: they could not  succeed, however, in raising the siege, and the garrison diminished  daily through hunger, sickness, and constant attacks, and the fortress  soon fell into the hands of the Crusaders, almost without a blow  (November 5, 1219). The Crusaders pillaged the town, taking from it four  hundred thousand gold pieces. The Italians also settled there, and  made it the seat of their commerce with Egypt. This conquest caused  excitement in Europe, and the Pope called Pelagius \"the second Joshua.\"    [Illustration: 027.jpg PUBLIC FOUNTAIN, CAIRO.]    If the Franks had been more at peace among themselves, they might  easily have pushed forward to Cairo after the fall of Damietta. But the  greatest discontent prevailed between the papal legate, Pelagius, and  King John of Brienne, so that the latter soon after left Egypt, while  Pelagius was forced to wait for reinforcements before he could get away  from Damietta.    El-Kamil, meanwhile, reinforced his army with the help of the friendly  Syrian princes, and, by destroying the channels and dams of the Nile  canals, so endangered the Christian camp that they were soon forced  to sue for peace, and offered to quit Damietta on the condition of an  unmolested retreat. El-Kamil, equally anxious for peace, accepted these  conditions (August, 1221). Scarcely had the AEyubites thus warded off:  the threatening danger when they proceeded to fall out among themselves.    After the death of El-Kamil, who in the end was generally regarded as  overlord, a new war broke out, in March, 1238, between his son El-Adil  II., who was reigning in Egypt, and his brother Ayyub, who occupied  Damascus. Ayyub conquered Egypt, but, in his absence, his uncle Ismail,  Prince of Balbek, seized upon Damascus and made a league with the Franks  in Palestine and several of the Syrian princes. Through this unnatural  league, Ismail, however, estranged not only the Moslem inhabitants of  Syria, but also his own army. Part of the army deserted in consequence  to Ayyub, who was thus enabled easily to subdue the allied army (1240).  Another coalition was formed against him a few years later, and this  time Da'ud of Kerak was one of the allies. Ayyub sent a strong army of  Egyptians, negroes, and Mamluks under the future sultan, Beybars,  to Syria. The Syrian troops fought unwillingly against their  fellow-believers in the opposite ranks, and the wild Chariz-mites,  who had also joined the ranks, inspired them with terror, so that they  deserted the field of battle in the neighbourhood of Gaza (October,  1244). The Christians, left to themselves, were not in a position to  resist the enemy's attacks; and the Egyptians made themselves masters  of Jerusalem and Hebron, and in the following year obtained Damascus,  Balbek, Ascalon, and Tiberias. In 1248 Ayyub came again into Syria, in  order to chastise El-Malik en-Nasir, Prince of Aleppo, who had seized  upon Hemessa when he heard of the coming Crusaders under Saint Louis.  To this end he made peace with the natives of Aleppo, and returned to  Jerusalem in order to make the necessary preparations for defence.
