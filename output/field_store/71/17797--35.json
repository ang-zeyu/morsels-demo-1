Enjoy yourself.\" And  suddenly she turned turtle, disappeared, and swam away quickly, quickly,  like a rat. Then she flicked round and began swimming back. She was  going to say something else. Beryl felt that she was being poisoned  by this cold woman, but she longed to hear. But oh, how strange, how  horrible! As Mrs. Harry Kember came up close she looked, in her black  waterproof bathing-cap, with her sleepy face lifted above the water,  just her chin touching, like a horrible caricature of her husband.      Chapter 1.VI.    In a steamer chair, under a manuka tree that grew in the middle of  the front grass patch, Linda Burnell dreamed the morning away. She did  nothing. She looked up at the dark, close, dry leaves of the manuka, at  the chinks of blue between, and now and again a tiny yellowish flower  dropped on her. Pretty--yes, if you held one of those flowers on the  palm of your hand and looked at it closely, it was an exquisite small  thing. Each pale yellow petal shone as if each was the careful work of a  loving hand. The tiny tongue in the centre gave it the shape of a bell.  And when you turned it over the outside was a deep bronze colour. But  as soon as they flowered, they fell and were scattered. You brushed them  off your frock as you talked; the horrid little things got caught in  one's hair. Why, then, flower at all? Who takes the trouble--or the  joy--to make all these things that are wasted, wasted... It was uncanny.    On the grass beside her, lying between two pillows, was the boy. Sound  asleep he lay, his head turned away from his mother. His fine dark hair  looked more like a shadow than like real hair, but his ear was a bright,  deep coral. Linda clasped her hands above her head and crossed her feet.  It was very pleasant to know that all these bungalows were empty, that  everybody was down on the beach, out of sight, out of hearing. She had  the garden to herself; she was alone.    Dazzling white the picotees shone; the golden-eyed marigold glittered;  the nasturtiums wreathed the veranda poles in green and gold flame. If  only one had time to look at these flowers long enough, time to get over  the sense of novelty and strangeness, time to know them! But as soon as  one paused to part the petals, to discover the under-side of the leaf,  along came Life and one was swept away. And, lying in her cane chair,  Linda felt so light; she felt like a leaf. Along came Life like a wind  and she was seized and shaken; she had to go. Oh dear, would it always  be so? Was there no escape?    ... Now she sat on the veranda of their Tasmanian home, leaning against  her father's knee. And he promised, \"As soon as you and I are old  enough, Linny, we'll cut off somewhere, we'll escape. Two boys together.  I have a fancy I'd like to sail up a river in China.\" Linda saw that  river, very wide, covered with little rafts and boats. She saw the  yellow hats of the boatmen and she heard their high, thin voices as they  called...    \"Yes, papa.\"    But just then a very broad young man with bright ginger hair walked  slowly past their house, and slowly, solemnly even, uncovered. Linda's  father pulled her ear teasingly, in the way he had.    \"Linny's beau,\" he whispered.    \"Oh, papa, fancy being married to Stanley Burnell!\"    Well, she was married to him. And what was more she loved him. Not  the Stanley whom every one saw, not the everyday one; but a timid,  sensitive, innocent Stanley who knelt down every night to say his  prayers, and who longed to be good. Stanley was simple. If he believed  in people--as he believed in her, for instance--it was with his whole  heart. He could not be disloyal; he could not tell a lie. And how  terribly he suffered if he thought any one--she--was not being dead  straight, dead sincere with him! \"This is too subtle for me!\" He flung  out the words, but his open, quivering, distraught look was like the  look of a trapped beast.    But the trouble was--here Linda felt almost inclined to laugh, though  Heaven knows it was no laughing matter--she saw her Stanley so seldom.  There were glimpses, moments, breathing spaces of calm, but all the rest  of the time it was like living in a house that couldn't be cured of the  habit of catching on fire, on a ship that got wrecked every day. And it  was always Stanley who was in the thick of the danger. Her whole time  was spent in rescuing him, and restoring him, and calming him down, and  listening to his story. And what was left of her time was spent in the  dread of having children.    Linda frowned; she sat up quickly in her steamer chair and clasped her  ankles. Yes, that was her real grudge against life; that was what she  could not understand. That was the question she asked and asked, and  listened in vain for the answer. It was all very well to say it was  the common lot of women to bear children. It wasn't true. She, for one,  could prove that wrong. She was broken, made weak, her courage was gone,  through child-bearing. And what made it doubly hard to bear was, she did  not love her children. It was useless pretending. Even if she had had  the strength she never would have nursed and played with the little  girls. No, it was as though a cold breath had chilled her through and  through on each of those awful journeys; she had no warmth left to give  them. As to the boy--well, thank Heaven, mother had taken him; he was  mother's, or Beryl's, or anybody's who wanted him. She had hardly  held him in her arms. She was so indifferent about him that as he lay  there... Linda glanced down.    The boy had turned over. He lay facing her, and he was no longer asleep.  His dark-blue, baby eyes were open; he looked as though he was peeping  at his mother. And suddenly his face dimpled; it broke into a wide,  toothless smile, a perfect beam, no less.    \"I'm here!\" that happy smile seemed to say. \"Why don't you like me?\"    There was something so quaint, so unexpected about that smile that Linda  smiled herself. But she checked herself and said to the boy coldly, \"I  don't like babies.\"    \"Don't like babies?\" The boy couldn't believe her. \"Don't like me?\" He  waved his arms foolishly at his mother.    Linda dropped off her chair on to the grass.    \"Why do you keep on smiling?\" she said severely. \"If you knew what I was  thinking about, you wouldn't.\"    But he only squeezed up his eyes, slyly, and rolled his head on the  pillow. He didn't believe a word she said.    \"We know all about that!\" smiled the boy.    Linda was so astonished at the confidence of this little creature... Ah  no, be sincere. That was not what she felt; it was something far  different, it was something so new, so... The tears danced in her eyes;  she breathed in a small whisper to the boy, \"Hallo, my funny!\"    But by now the boy had forgotten his mother. He was serious again.  Something pink, something soft waved in front of him. He made a grab at  it and it immediately disappeared. But when he lay back, another, like  the first, appeared. This time he determined to catch it. He made a  tremendous effort and rolled right over.      Chapter 1.VII.    The tide was out; the beach was deserted; lazily flopped the warm sea.  The sun beat down, beat down hot and fiery on the fine sand, baking  the grey and blue and black and white-veined pebbles. It sucked up the  little drop of water that lay in the hollow of the curved shells; it  bleached the pink convolvulus that threaded through and through  the sand-hills. Nothing seemed to move but the small sand-hoppers.  Pit-pit-pit! They were never still.    Over there on the weed-hung rocks that looked at low tide like shaggy  beasts come down to the water to drink, the sunlight seemed to spin like  a silver coin dropped into each of the small rock pools. They danced,  they quivered, and minute ripples laved the porous shores. Looking  down, bending over, each pool was like a lake with pink and blue houses  clustered on the shores; and oh! the vast mountainous country behind  those houses--the ravines, the passes, the dangerous creeks and  fearful tracks that led to the water's edge. Underneath waved the  sea-forest--pink thread-like trees, velvet anemones, and orange  berry-spotted weeds. Now a stone on the bottom moved, rocked, and there  was a glimpse of a black feeler; now a thread-like creature wavered by  and was lost. Something was happening to the pink, waving trees; they  were changing to a cold moonlight blue. And now there sounded the  faintest \"plop.\" Who made that sound? What was going on down there? And  how strong, how damp the seaweed smelt in the hot sun...    The green blinds were drawn in the bungalows of the summer colony. Over  the verandas, prone on the paddock, flung over the fences, there were  exhausted-looking bathing-dresses and rough striped towels. Each back  window seemed to have a pair of sand-shoes on the sill and some lumps of  rock or a bucket or a collection of pawa shells. The bush quivered in  a haze of heat; the sandy road was empty except for the Trouts' dog  Snooker, who lay stretched in the very middle of it. His blue eye  was turned up, his legs stuck out stiffly, and he gave an occasional  desperate-sounding puff, as much as to say he had decided to make an end  of it and was only waiting for some kind cart to come along.    \"What are you looking at, my grandma? Why do you keep stopping and sort  of staring at the wall?\"    Kezia and her grandmother were taking their siesta together. The little  girl, wearing only her short drawers and her under-bodice, her arms and  legs bare, lay on one of the puffed-up pillows of her grandma's bed, and  the old woman, in a white ruffled dressing-gown, sat in a rocker at the  window, with a long piece of pink knitting in her lap. This room  that they shared, like the other rooms of the bungalow, was of light  varnished wood and the floor was bare.

Guesses had even been made at the  size of this globe, Aristotle fixing its circumference at 400,000  stadia (or 40,000 miles), but Eratosthenes attempted a more accurate  measurement. He compared the length of the shadow thrown by the sun  at Alexandria and at Syene, near the first cataract of the Nile,  which he assumed to be on the same meridian of longitude, and to be  at about 5000 stadia (500 miles) distance. From the difference in  the length of the shadows he deduced that this distance represented  one-fiftieth of the circumference of the earth, which would accordingly  be about 250,000 stadia, or 25,000 geographical miles. As the actual  circumference is 24,899 English miles, this was a very near  approximation, considering the rough means Eratosthenes had at his  disposal.    Having thus estimated the size of the earth, Eratosthenes then  went on to determine the size of that portion which the ancients  considered to be habitable. North and south of the lands known to  him, Eratosthenes and all the ancients considered to be either  too cold or too hot to be habitable; this portion he reckoned to  extend to 38,000 stadia, or 3800 miles. In reckoning the extent  of the habitable portion from east to west, Eratosthenes came to  the conclusion that from the Straits of Gibraltar to the east of  India was about 80,000 stadia, or, roughly speaking, one-third of  the earth's surface. The remaining two-thirds were supposed to be  covered by the ocean, and Eratosthenes prophetically remarked that  \"if it were not that the vast extent of the Atlantic Sea rendered it  impossible, one might almost sail from the coast of Spain to that  of India along the same parallel.\" Sixteen hundred years later, as  we shall see, Columbus tried to carry out this idea. Eratosthenes  based his calculations on two fundamental lines, corresponding in a  way to our equator and meridian of Greenwich: the first stretched,  according to him, from Cape St. Vincent, through the Straits of  Messina and the island of Rhodes, to Issus (Gulf of Iskanderun); for  his starting-line in reckoning north and south he used a meridian  passing through the First Cataract, Alexandria, Rhodes, and Byzantium.    The next two hundred years after Eratosthenes' death was filled  up by the spread of the Roman Empire, by the taking over by the  Romans of the vast possessions previously held by Alexander and  his successors and by the Carthaginians, and by their spread into  Gaul, Britain, and Germany. Much of the increased knowledge thus  obtained was summed up in the geographical work of STRABO, who  wrote in Greek about 20 B.C. He introduced from the extra knowledge  thus obtained many modifications of the system of Eratosthenes,  but, on the whole, kept to his general conception of the world. He  rejected, however, the existence of Thule, and thus made the world  narrower; while he recognised the existence of Ierne, or Ireland;  which he regarded as the most northerly part of the habitable world,  lying, as he thought, north of Britain.    Between the time of Strabo and that of Ptolemy, who sums up all  the knowledge of the ancients about the habitable earth, there was  only one considerable addition to men's acquaintance with their  neighbours, contained in a seaman's manual for the navigation of  the Indian Ocean, known as the _Periplus_ of the Erythraean Sea.  This gave very full and tolerably accurate accounts of the coasts  from Aden to the mouth of the Ganges, though it regarded Ceylon  as much greater, and more to the south, than it really is; but  it also contains an account of the more easterly parts of Asia,  Indo-China, and China itself, \"where the silk comes from.\" This  had an important influence on the views of Ptolemy, as we shall  see, and indirectly helped long afterwards to the discovery of  America.    [Illustration: PTOLEMAEI ORBIS]    It was left to PTOLEMY of Alexandria to sum up for the ancient  world all the knowledge that had been accumulating from the time  of Eratosthenes to his own day, which we may fix at about 150 A.D.  He took all the information he could find in the writings of the  preceding four hundred years, and reduced it all to one uniform  scale; for it is to him that we owe the invention of the method  and the names of latitude and longitude. Previous writers had been  content to say that the distance between one point and another  was so many stadia, but he reduced all this rough reckoning to  so many degrees of latitude and longitude, from fixed lines as  starting-points. But, unfortunately, all these reckonings were  rough calculations, which are almost invariably beyond the truth;  and Ptolemy, though the greatest of ancient astronomers, still  further distorted his results by assuming that a degree was 500  stadia, or 50 geographical miles. Thus when he found in any of  his authorities that the distance between one port and another was  500 stadia, he assumed, in the first place, that this was accurate,  and, in the second, that the distance between the two places was  equal to a degree of latitude or longitude, as the case might be.  Accordingly he arrived at the result that the breadth of the habitable  globe was, as he put it, twelve hours of longitude (corresponding  to 180 deg.)--nearly one-third as much again as the real dimensions  from Spain to China. The consequence of this was that the distance  from Spain to China _westward_ was correspondingly diminished by  sixty degrees (or nearly 4000 miles), and it was this error that  ultimately encouraged Columbus to attempt his epoch-making voyage.    Ptolemy's errors of calculation would not have been so extensive  but that he adopted a method of measurement which made them  accumulative. If he had chosen Alexandria for the point of departure  in measuring longitude, the errors he made when reckoning westward  would have been counterbalanced by those reckoning eastward, and  would not have resulted in any serious distortion of the truth; but  instead of this, he adopted as his point of departure the Fortunatae  Insulae, or Canary Islands, and every degree measured to the east  of these was one-fifth too great, since he assumed that it was  only fifty miles in length. I may mention that so great has been  the influence of Ptolemy on geography, that, up to the middle of  the last century, Ferro, in the Canary Islands, was still retained  as the zero-point of the meridians of longitude.    Another point in which Ptolemy's system strongly influenced modern  opinion was his departure from the previous assumption that the  world was surrounded by the ocean, derived from Homer. Instead  of Africa being thus cut through the middle by the ocean, Ptolemy  assumed, possibly from vague traditional knowledge, that Africa  extended an unknown length to the south, and joined on to an equally  unknown continent far to the east, which, in the Latinised versions  of his astronomical work, was termed \"terra australis incognita,\"  or \"the unknown south land.\" As, by his error with regard to the  breadth of the earth, Ptolemy led to Columbus; so, by his mistaken  notions as to the \"great south land,\" he prepared the way for the  discoveries of Captain Cook. But notwithstanding these errors,  which were due partly to the roughness of the materials which he  had to deal with, and partly to scientific caution, Ptolemy's work  is one of the great monuments of human industry and knowledge. For  the Old World it remained the basis of all geographical knowledge  up to the beginning of the last century, just as his astronomical  work was only finally abolished by the work of Newton. Ptolemy  has thus the rare distinction of being the greatest authority on  two important departments of human knowledge--astronomy and  geography--for over fifteen hundred years. Into the details of  his description of the world it is unnecessary to go. The map will  indicate how near he came to the main outlines of the Mediterranean,  of Northwest Europe, of Arabia, and of the Black Sea. Beyond these  regions he could only depend upon the rough indications and guesses  of untutored merchants. But it is worth while referring to his method  of determining latitude, as it was followed up by most succeeding  geographers. Between the equator and the most northerly point known  to him, he divides up the earth into horizontal strips, called  by him \"climates,\" and determined by the average length of the  longest day in each. This is a very rough method of determining  latitude, but it was probably, in most cases, all that Ptolemy  had to depend upon, since the measurement of angles would be a  rare accomplishment even in modern times, and would only exist  among a few mathematicians and astronomers in Ptolemy's days. With  him the history of geographical knowledge and discovery in the  ancient world closes.    In this chapter I have roughly given the names and exploits of  the Greek men of science, who summed up in a series of systematic  records the knowledge obtained by merchants, by soldiers, and by  travellers of the extent of the world known to the ancients. Of this  knowledge, by far the largest amount was gained, not by systematic  investigation for the purpose of geography, but by military expeditions  for the purpose of conquest. We must now retrace our steps, and  give a rough review of the various stages of conquest. We must now  retrace our steps, and give a rough review of the various stages  of conquest by which the different regions of the Old World became  known to the Greeks and the Roman Empire, whose knowledge Ptolemy  summarises.
