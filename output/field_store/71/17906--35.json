[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16224"],[0,"A Bibliographical, Antiquarian and Picturesque Tour in France and Germany, (#4)"],[1,"slators, by corrections of \"Names of Persons, Places,  and Things,\" would be to betray a stubbornness or obtuseness of feeling  which certainly does not enter into the composition of its author.    I now turn, not without some little anxiety, yet not wholly divested of the  hope of a favourable issue, to the character and object of the Edition HERE  presented to the Public. It will be evident, at first glance, that it is  greatly \"shorn of its beams\" in regard to graphic decorations and  typographical splendour. Yet its garb, if less costly, is not made of  coarse materials: for it has been the wish and aim of the Publishers, that  this impression should rank among books worthy of the DISTINGUISHED PRESS  from which it issues. Nor is it unadorned by the sister art of _Engraving_;  for, although on a reduced scale, some of the repeated plates may even  dispute the palm of superiority with their predecessors. Several of the  GROUPS, executed on _copper_ in the preceding edition, have been executed  on _wood_ in the present; and it is for the learned in these matters to  decide upon their relative merits. To have attempted portraits upon wood,  would have inevitably led to failure. There are however, a few NEW PLATES,  which cannot fail to elicit the Purchaser's particular attention. Of these,  the portraits of the _Abbe de la Rue_ (procured through the kind offices of  my excellent friend Mr. Douce), and the _Comte de Brienne_, the _Gold Medal  of Louis XII_. the _Stone Pulpit of Strasbourg Cathedral,_ and the _Prater  near Vienna_--are particularly to be noticed.[14] This Edition has also  another attraction, rather popular in the present day, which may add to its  recommendation even with those possessed of its precursor. It contains  fac-similes of the AUTOGRAPHS of several distinguished Literati and Artists  upon the Continent;[15] who, looking at the text of the work through a less  jaundiced medium than the Parisian translator, have continued a  correspondence with the Author, upon the most friendly terms, since its  publication. The accuracy of these fac-similes must be admitted, even by  the parties themselves, to be indisputable. Among them, are several,  executed by hands.. which now CEASE to guide the pen! I had long and fondly  hoped to have been gratified by increasing testimonies of the warmth of  heart which had directed several of the pens in question--hoped ... even  against the admonition of a pagan poet ...      \"Vitae summa brevis SPEM nos vetat inchoare LONGAM.\"    But such hopes are now irretrievably cut off; and the remembrance of the  past must solace the anticipations of the future.    So much respecting the _decorative_ department of this new edition of the  Tour. I have now to request the Reader's attention to a few points more  immediately connected with what may be considered its _intrinsic_ worth. In  the first place, it may be pronounced to be an Edition both _abridged_ and  _enlarged_: abridged, as regards the lengthiness of description of many of  the MSS. and Printed Books--and enlarged, as respects the addition, of many  notes; partly of a controversial, and partly of an obituary, description.  The \"Antiquarian and Picturesque\" portions remain nearly as heretofore; and  upon the whole I doubt whether the amputation of matter has extended beyond  _an eighth_ of what appeared in the previous edition. It had long ago been  suggested to me--from a quarter too high and respectable to doubt the  wisdom of its decision--that the Contents of this Tour should be made known  to the Public through a less costly medium:--that the objects described in  it were, in a measure, new and interesting--but that the high price of the  purchase rendered it, to the majority of Readers, an inaccessible  publication. I hope that these objections are fully met, and successfully  set aside, by the Work in its PRESENT FORM. To have produced it, _wholly  divested_ of ornament, would have been as foreign to my habits as repugnant  to my feelings. I have therefore, as I would willingly conclude, hit upon  the happy medium--between sterility and excess of decoration.    After all, the greater part of the ground here trodden, yet continues to be  untrodden ground to the public. I am not acquainted with any publication  which embraces all the objects here described; nor can I bring myself to  think that a perusal of the first and third volumes may not be unattended  with gratification of a peculiar description, to the lovers of antiquities  and picturesque beauties. The second volume is rather the exclusive  province of the Bibliographer. In retracing the steps here marked out, I  will not be hypocrite enough to dissemble a sort of triumphant feeling  which accompanies a retrospection of the time, labour, and money devoted..  in doing justice, according to my means, to the attractions and worth of  the Countries which these pages describe. Every such effort is, in its way,  a NATIONAL effort. Every such attempt unites, in stronger bonds, the  reciprocities of a generous feeling between rival Nations; and if my reward  has not been in _wealth_, it has been in the hearty commendation of the  enlightened and the good: \"Mea me virtute involvo.\"[16]    I cannot boast of the commendatory strains of public Journals in my own  country. No intellectual steam-engine has been put in motion to manufacture  a review of unqualified approbation of the Work now submitted to the public  eye--at an expense, commensurate with the ordinary means of purchase. With  the exception of an indirect and laudatory notice of it, in the immortal  pages of the Author of Waverley, of the Sketch book, and of Reginald  Dalton, this Tour has had to fight its way under the splendour of its own  banners, and in the strength of its own cause. The previous Edition is now  a scarce and a costly book. Its Successor has enough to recommend it, even  to the most fastidious collector, from the elegance of its type and  decorations, and from the reasonableness of its price; but the highest  ambition of its author is, that it may be a part of the furniture of every  Circulating Library in the Kingdom. If he were not conscious that GOOD  would result from its perusal, he would not venture upon such an avowal.  \"FELIX FAUSTUMQUE SIT!\"      [1] M. Crapelet is of course speaking of the PREVIOUS edition of the Tour.      He continues thus: \"M. Dibdin, dans son voyage en France, a visite nos      departemens de l'ouest et de l'est, toutes leurs principales villes,      presque tous les lieux remarquables par les antiquites, par les      monumens, par les beautes du site, ou par les souvenirs historiques.      Il a visite les chateaux, les eglises, les chapelles; il a observe nos      moeurs, nos coutumes; nos habitudes; il a examine nos Musees et nos      premiers Cabinets de curiosite; il s'est concentre dans nos      Bibliotheques. Il parle de notre litterature et des hommes de lettres,      des arts et de nos artistes; il critique les personnes comme les      choses; il loue quelquefois, il plaisante souvent; la vivacite de son      esprit l'egare presque toujours.\" A careful perusal of the notes in      THIS edition will shew that my veracity has not \"almost always led me      astray.\"    [2] GABRIEL PEIGNOT; _Varietes, Notices et Raretes Bibliographiques, 1822,      8vo. p. 4_.    [3] _Lettre d'un Relieur Francais a un Bibliographe Anglais; a Paris, de      l'Imprimerie de Crapelet_, 1822, 8vo. p.p. 28.    [4] It is a little curious that M. Lesne has not been singular in this      supposition. My amiable and excellent friend M. Schweighaeuser of      Strasbourg had the same notion: at least, he told me that the style of      the Tour very frequently reminded him of that of Sterne. I can only      say--and say very honestly--that I as much thought of Sterne as I did      of ... William Caxton!    [5] Copious as are the above quotations, from the thoroughly original M.      Lesne, I cannot resist the risking of the readers patience and good      opinion, by the subjoining of the following passage--with which the      brochure concludes. \"D'apres la multitude de choses hasardees que      contient votre Lettre, vous en aurez probablement recu quelques unes      de personnes que vous aurez choquees plus que moi, qui vous devrais      plutot des remercimens pour avoir pris la peine de traduire quelques      pages de mon ouvrage; mais il n'en est pas de meme de bien des gens,      et cela ne doit pas les engager a etre autant communicatif avec vous,      si vous reveniez en France. Je souhaite, dans ce dernier cas, que tous      les typographes, les bibliothecaires, les bibliognostes, les      bibliographes, les bibliolathes, les bibliomanes, les biblophiles, les      bibliopoles, ceux qui exercent la bibliuguiancie et les bibliopegistes      meme, soient pour vous autant de bibliotaphes; vous ne seriez plus a      meme de critiquer ce que vous sauriez et ce que vous ne sauriez pas,      comme vous l'aviez si souvent fait inconsiderement:          Mais tous vos procedes ne nous etonnent pas,        C'est le sort des Francais de faire DES INGRATS;        On les voit servir ceux qui leur furent nuisibles;        Je crois que sur ce point ils sont incorrigibles.        Je vous avouerai cependant que je suis loin d'etre fache de vous voir      en agir ainsi envers mes compatriotes: je desirerais que beaucoup      d'Anglais fissent de meme; cela pourrait desangliciser ou      desanglomaniser les Francais. Vous, Monsieur, qui aimez les mots      nouveaux, aidez-moi, je vous prie, a franciser, a purifier celui-ci.      Quant a moi          Je ne fus pas nourri de Grec et de Latin,        J'appris a veiller tard, a me lever matin,        La nature est le livre ou je fis mes etudes,        Et tous ces mots nouveaux me semblent long-temps rudes;        Je trouve qu'on ne peut tres bien les prononcer        Sans affectation, au moins sans grimacer;        Que tous ces mots "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16250"],[0,"Tristan and Isolda: Opera in Three Acts (#4)"],[1,"who causes thus  my bosom's throes,  whose eager fire  within me glows,  whose light upon  my spirit flows,  Love's goddess needs  that night should close;  that brightly she may reign  and shun the torchlight vain.    (_She goes up to the door and takes down the torch_.)    Go watch without--  keep wary guard!  The signal!--  and were it my spirit's spark,  smiling  I'd destroy it and hail the dark!    [_She throws the torch to the ground where it slowly dies out.  BRANGAENA turns away, disturbed, and mounts an outer flight of steps  leading to the roof, where she slowly disappears. ISOLDA listens and  peers, at first shyly, towards an avenue. Urged, by rising impatience,  she then approaches the avenue and looks more boldly. She signs with  her handkerchief, first slightly, then more plainly, waving it quicker  as her impatience increases. A gesture of sudden delight shows that  she has perceived her lover in the distance. She stretches herself  higher and higher, and then, to look better over the intervening  space, hastens back to the steps, from the top of which she signals  again to the on-comer. As he enters, she springs to meet him_.]      SCENE II.    TRISTAN (_rushing in_). Isolda! Beloved!    ISOLDA. Tristan! Beloved one!    (_Passionate embrace, with which they come down to the front_.)    BOTH. Art thou mine?  Do I behold thee?  Do I embrace thee?  Can I believe it?  At last! At last!  Here on my breast!  Do I then clasp thee!  Is it thy own self?  Are these thine eyes?  These thy lips?  Here thy hand?  Here thy heart?  Is't I?--Is't thou,  held in my arms?  Am I not duped?  Is it no dream?  O rapture of spirit!  O sweetest, highest,  fairest, strongest,  holiest bliss?  Endless pleasure!  Boundless treasure!  Ne'er to sever!  Never! Never!  Unconceived,  unbelieved,  overpowering  exaltation!  Joy-proclaiming,  bliss-outpouring,  high in heaven,  earth ignoring!  Tristan mine!  Isolda mine!  Tristan!  Isolda!  Mine alone!  Thine alone!  Ever all my own!    TRISTAN. The light! The light!  O but this light,  how long 'twas let to burn!  The sun had sunk,  the day had fled;  but all their spite  not yet was sped:  the scaring signal  they set alight,  before my belov'd one's dwelling,  my swift approach repelling.    ISOLDA. Thy belov'd one's hand  lowered the light,  for Brangaena's fears  in me roused no fright:  while Love's goddess gave me aid,  sunlight a mock I made.  But the light its fear  and defeat repaid;  with thy misdeeds  a league it made.  What thou didst see  in shadowing night,  to the shining sun  of kingly might  must thou straightway surrender,  that it should  exist in bright  bonds of empty splendor.--  Could I bear it then?  Can I bear it now?    TRISTAN. O now were we  to night devoted,  the dishonest day  with envy bloated,  lying, could not mislead,  though it might part us indeed.  Its pretentious glows  and its glamouring light  are scouted by those  who worship night.  All its flickering gleams  in flashes out-blazing  blind us no more  where we are gazing.  Those who death's night  boldly survey,  those who have studied  her secret way,  the daylight's falsehoods--  rank and fame,  honor and all  at which men aim--  to them are no more matter  than dust which sunbeams scatter,  In the daylight's visions thronging  only abides one longing;  we yearn to hie  to holy night,  where, unending,  only true,  Love extendeth delight!    (TRISTAN _draws_ ISOLDA _gently aside to a flowery bank, sinks  on his knee before her and rests his head on her arm_.)    (TRISTAN _and_ ISOLDA _sink into oblivious ecstasy, reposing on  the flowery bank close together_.)    BRANGAENA (_from the turret, unseen_). Long I watch  alone by night:  ye enwrapt  in love's delight,  heed my boding  voice aright.  I forewarn you  woe is near;  waken to  my words of fear.  Have a care!  Have a care!  Swiftly night doth wear!    ISOLDA. List, beloved!    TRISTAN. Let me die thus!    ISOLDA (_slowly raising herself a little_). Envious  watcher!    TRISTAN (_remaining in reclining position_). I'll ne'er  waken.    ISOLDA. But the Day  must dawn and rouse thee?    TRISTAN (_raising his head slightly_). Let the Day  to Death surrender!    ISOLDA. Day and Death  will both engender  feud against  our passion tender.    TRISTAN (_drawing_ ISOLDA _gently towards him with expressive  action_). O might we then  together die,  each the other's  own for aye!  never fearing,  never waking,  blest delights  of love partaking,--  each to each be given,  in love alone our heaven!    ISOLDA (_gazing up at him in thoughtful ecstasy_).  O might we then  together die!    TRISTAN. Each the other's--    ISOLDA. Own for aye,--    TRISTAN. Never fearing--    ISOLDA. Never waking--    TRISTAN. Blest delights  of love partaking--    ISOLDA. Each to each be given;  in love alone our heaven.    (ISOLDA, _as if overcome, droops her head on his breast._)    BRANGAENA'S VOICE (_as before_).  Have a care!  Have a care!  Night yields to daylight's glare.    TRISTAN (_bends smilingly to ISOLDA_).  Shall I listen?    ISOLDA (looking fondly up at TRISTAN).  Let me die thus!    TRISTAN. Must I waken?    ISOLDA. Nought shall wake me!    TRISTAN. Must not daylight  dawn, and rouse me?    ISOLDA. Let the Day  to Death surrender!    TRISTAN. May thus the Day's  evil threats be defied?    ISOLDA (_with growing enthusiasm_).  From its thraldom let us fly.    TRISTAN. And shall not its dawn  be dreaded by us?    ISOLDA (_rising with a grand gesture_).  Night will shield us for aye!    (TRISTAN _follows her; they embrace in fond exaltation_.)    BOTH. O endless Night!  blissful Night!  glad and glorious  lover's Night!  Those whom thou holdest,  lapped in delight,  how could e'en the boldest  unmoved endure thy flight?  How to take it,  how to break it,--  joy existent,  sunlight distant,  Far from mourning,  sorrow-warning,  fancies spurning,  softly yearning,  fear expiring,  sweet desiring!  Anguish flying,  gladly dying;  no more pining,  night-enshrining,  ne'er divided  whate'er betided,  side by side  still abide  in realms of space unmeasured,  vision blest and treasured!  Thou Isolda,  Tristan I;  no more Tristan,  no more Isolda.  Never spoken,  never broken,  newly sighted,  newly lighted,  endless ever  all our dream:  in our bosoms gleam  love delights supreme!      SCENE III.    [BRANGAENA _utters a piercing cry_. TRISTAN _and_ ISOLDA  _remain in their absorbed state_. KURVENAL _rushes in with  drawn sword_.]    KURVENAL. Save yourself, Tristan!    [_He looks fearfully off behind him_. MARK, MELOT, _and  courtiers, in hunting dress, come swiftly up the avenue and pause in  the foreground in consternation before the lovers_. BRANGAENA _at  the same time descends from the roof and hastens towards_ ISOLDA.  _The latter in involuntary shame leans on the flowery bank with  averted face_. TRISTAN _with an equally unconscious action  stretches his mantle wide out with one arm, so as to conceal_  ISOLDA _from the gaze of the new-comers. In this position he remains  for some time, turning a changeless look upon the men, who gaze at him  in varied emotion. The morning dawns_.]    TRISTAN. The dreary day--  its last time comes!    MELOT (_to Mark_). Now say to me, my sov'reign,  was my impeachment just?  I staked my head thereon:  How is the pledge redeemed?  Behold him in  the very act:  honor and fame,  faithfully I  have saved from shame for thee.    MARK (_deeply moved, with trembling voice_). Hast thou  preserved them?  Say'st thou so?--  See him there,  the truest of all true hearts!  Look on him  the faithfulest of friends, too  His offence  so black and base  fills my heart  with anguish and disgrace.  Tristan traitor,  what hope stayeth  that the honor  he betrayeth  should by Melot's rede  rest to me indeed?    TRISTAN (_with convulsive violence_). Daylight phantoms--  morning visions  empty and vain--  Avaunt! Begone!    MARK (_in deep emotion_). This--blow.  Tristan, to me?  Where now has truth fled,  if Tristan can betray?  Where now are faith  and friendship fair,  when from the fount of faith,  my Tristan, they are gone?  The buckler Tristan  once did don,  where is that shield  of virtue now?  when from my friends it flies,  and Tristan's honor dies?    (TRISTAN _slowly lowers his eyes to the ground. His features  express increasing grief while MARK continues_.)    Why hast thou noble  service done,  and honor, fame  and potent might  amassed for Mark, thy king?  Must honor, fame,  power and might,  must all thy noble  service done  be paid with Mark's dishonor?  Seemed the reward  too slight and scant  that what thou hast won him--  realms and riches--  thou art the heir unto, all?  When childless he lost  once a wife,  he loved thee so  that ne'er again  did Mark desire to marry.  When all his subjects,  high and low,  demands and pray'rs,  on him did press  to choose himself a consort--  a queen to give the kingdom,  when thou thyself  thy uncle urged  that what the court  and country pleaded  well might be conceded,  opposing high and low,  opposing e'en thyself,  with kindly cunning  still he refused,  till, Tristan, thou didst threaten  forever to leave  both court and land  if thou receivedst  not command  a bride for the king to woo:  then so he let thee do.--  This wondrous lovely wife,  thy might for me did win,  who could behold her,  who address her,  who in pride  and bliss possess her,  but would bless his happy fortune?  She whom I have  paid respect to ever,  whom I owned,  yet possess'd her never  she, the princess  proud and peerless,  lighting up  my life so cheerless,  'spite foes,--without fear,  the fairest of brides  thou didst bring me here.  Why in hell must I bide,  without hope of a heaven?  Why endure disgrace  unhealed by tears or grief?  The unexplained,  unpenetrated  cause of all these woes,  who will to us disclose?    TRISTAN (_raising his eyes pitifully towards_ MARK).  O monarch! I--  may"]]]
