What fun it is to throw  snowballs, and to skate on the ice!    See the boys and girls! How merry they are! Henry has his sled, and draws  his little sister. There they go!    I think Henry is kind, for his sister is too small to skate.    Look! Did you see that boy fall down? But I see he is not hurt, for he is  laughing.

Their grandpa likes to sit on the large rock, and watch the big ships as  they sail far away on the blue sea. Sometimes he sits there all day long.    The little girls like to dig in the sand, and pick up pretty shells. They  watch the waves as they roll up on the beach, and break into white foam.    They sometimes make little houses of sand, and build walls around them;  and they dig wells with their small wooden spades.    They have been picking up shells for their little sister. She is too young  to come to the beach.    I think all children like to play by the seaside when the sun is bright,  and the wind does not blow too hard.

He thought these would be nice pets for Willie; so he asked the lad how  much he wanted for his rabbits.    The boy said, \"Only fifty cents, sir.\"    Willie's father bought them, and carried them home.    Here you see the rabbits and their little master. He has a pen for them,  and always shuts them in it at night to keep them safe.    He gives them bread and grass to eat. They like grass, and will take it  from his hand. He has called in a little friend to see them.    Willie is telling him about their funny ways.    SLATE WORK.

Don't you know the nest we saw some days ago?  What do you think is in it now?\"    \"O Willie, I know! Some little brown birds. Let us go and see them.\"    \"All right; but we must not go too near. There! I just saw the old bird  fly out of the bush. Stand here, Rose. Can you see?\"    \"Why, Willie, what ugly little things! What big mouths they have, and no  feathers!\"    \"Keep still, Rose. Here comes the old bird with a worm in her bill.

Frank was a poor, little, lame boy. His father and mother were dead. His  dear, old grandma took care of him, and tried to make him happy.    Every day, Mary's mother filled Frank's basket with bread and meat, and a  little tea for his grandma.    \"How do you do, Frank?\" said Mary. \"Don't make a noise; my doll is going  to sleep. It is just a little sick to-day.\"    \"Well, then, let us whistle it to sleep.\" And Frank, taking a willow  whistle out of his pocket, blew a long note.    \"Oh, how sweet!\" cried Mary. \"Do let me try.\"        LESSON LX.    turned    face    cried    low    al'most    soon    more    cry    once(wuns)        be cause'      [Illustration: Boy and Girl sitting on log.]      \"Yes, Mary, I will give it to you, because you are so good to my grandma.\"    \"Oh! thank you very much.\" Mary blew and blew a long time. \"I can't make  it whistle,\" said she, almost ready to cry.    \"Sometimes they will whistle, and sometimes they won't,\" said Frank. \"Try  again, Mary.\"    She tried once more, and the whistle made a low, sweet sound. \"It  whistles!\" she cried.    In her joy, she had turned the doll's face down, and its eyes shut tight,  as if it had gone to sleep.    \"There!\" cried Frank, \"I told you the way to put a doll to sleep, is to  whistle to it.\"    \"So it is,\" said Mary. \"Dear, little thing; it must be put in its bed  now.\"    So they went into the house. Frank's basket was soon filled, and he went  home happy.

They were  very small, and the old hen took good care of them. She found food for  them in the daytime, and at night kept them under her wings.    One day, this old hen took her chickens down to a small brook. She thought  the air from the water would do them good.    When they got to the brook, they walked on the bank a little while. It was  very pretty on the other side of the brook, and the old hen thought she  would take her children over there.
