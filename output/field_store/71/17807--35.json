How straight it stands  in the candlestick! Stand up straight, girls and boys. Do not stoop. Do  not hump yourself over your school desk. Walk erect. It means so much  now, it will mean much more in later years. Some day, if you heed my  word, you will be grateful that the preacher once said to you so  emphatically that you could not forget, \"John, Mary, stand up straight.\"    Fourth, the candle stands for Light. It is useless until the wick is  lighted. It burns for others. Your life is a light. Jesus wants all  Christians to think of themselves as lights in the world. \"Let your  light shine.\" Be a lighted candle for the Lord.    MEMORY VERSE, _Proverbs_ 20: 27        \"The spirit of man is the candle of the Lord.\"    MEMORY HYMN [84]        _\"The spacious firmament on high.\"_          ALAS, THE MARKS      There is an old, old story about a father who had great difficulty in  making his boy obey. The boy did wrong in spite of all that the father  could say or do. One day the father said to the boy, \"Here is the shed  door, now every time you do wrong I am going to pound a nail into the  door.\" One by one the nails were pounded into the door, until it was  literally filled with nails. The boy did not like the looks of the door,  the thought of it began to trouble his conscience. So he spoke to his  father about it. \"Well,\" said his father, \"I'll tell you what we will  do. Every time you are obedient, every time you do a good deed rather  than a wrong one, we will pull a nail out.\" The bargain was struck, and  as, one by one, the nails were driven in, so, one by one, they were  pulled out.    Finally the day arrived when there was but one nail left. You can  imagine the joy of the boy when he and his father went together to pull  that nail out. With great glee the claws of the hammer were fastened  about the head of Mr. Nail and, jerk, out he came. \"Oh,\" exclaimed the  boy, \"the marks are left.\" Yes, it was true, for every nail driven in  and pulled out a mark was left, and it was an ugly looking door. \"That  is the sad thing about it all,\" said the father, \"every time you do an  evil deed a mark is left upon the life. It is never the same as if the  evil deed had not been committed. It is fine that we have all the nails  out, but it would have been much better had they never been driven in.\"    MEMORY VERSE, _Jeremiah_ 2: 22        \"For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much sope,      yet thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord God.\"    MEMORY HYMN [348]        _\"Take my life and let it be      Consecrated, Lord, to thee.\"_          A BLIND MAN WHO SAW      Once upon a time there was a boy who had a call to be a preacher. Now  this boy was Scotch, and the fondest ambition of a Scotch mother is that  her son shall become a minister. You may believe that this particular  lad's mother was very, very happy. So George (George was his name) went  to school. He was not a brilliant student, but he was faithful, he did  his work well and passed his grades. One day he noted some difficulty  with his eyes. The trouble increased rather than diminished. Before he  had finished his education, while he was yet a young man, he became  totally blind. He was greatly discouraged. He was tempted to give up  entirely, stop trying to do anything. Certainly he could not be a  successful preacher if he was blind. Who would listen to him? How could  he do his work?    However there was another voice inside him, the voice of courage, hope  and faith. It was the voice of the Lord that bid him go right on with  his plans. He heeded the urge of the inner voice. He was ordained.  People loved him, and flocked to hear him preach. Though his natural  vision was darkened, his spiritual vision was so much brighter. Though  he could not look upon the beautiful sights of the world, he had eyes to  see more clearly the wonderful things of the soul. His fame spread  throughout Edinburgh, Scotland, England, and all the English-speaking  world, and everywhere he was known and loved as the blind preacher.    This blind preacher wrote many hymns. The greatest hymn he ever wrote,  and one of the finest in all the English language, is the Memory Hymn  for to-day.    His name? Well, I almost forgot that. His name is George Matheson.    MEMORY VERSE, _Isaiah_ 42: 16        \"I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead      them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkness light      before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do      unto them, and not forsake them.\"    MEMORY HYMN [481]        _\"O love that wilt not let me go.\"_          CHOOSING A KING      What would you do if you were asked to select a young man who should  some day be president of the United States? What tests would you apply?  Would you look upon the clothes that he wore? Would you consider the  color of his hair? Would you insist that he should be of a certain  height? Once upon a time there was a good and wise man who was asked to  choose a king for his people. He started on his journey in search of the  most promising youth he could find. By and by he came to a home where  there were many boys. One of these boys stood before him. He was tall.  He was well formed. He had a good bearing. Surely, thought the  king-chooser, here is just the man. But something inside him, \"the still  small voice\" I think it was, said to him, \"No, do not choose him, he is  not the one.\" The father then called a second son. Like the first he was  goodly to look upon. The great man commissioned to choose a king was  about to select this one when the same voice inside warned him to wait.  A third son was summoned. A third time the voice said, \"No, he is not  the one.\"    How chagrined the father must have been to have all seven of his  splendid sons rejected! All? No, not all. For the king-chooser said,  \"Have you no more sons?\" \"Yes, I have one other, but he is young and the  keeper of the sheep. I am sure you would not think of him as a king.\"  \"Nevertheless,\" said the prophet, \"send for him.\" And he came, the  youngest, the most unlikely one of all, at least so the father and the  brothers thought. But the voice within said, \"This is the one, choose  him.\" You will want to read all of this wonderful story and you will  find it in your Bible, First Samuel the sixteenth chapter.    MEMORY VERSE, I _Samuel_ 16: 7        \"And the Lord said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on      the height of his stature; for the Lord seeth not as man seeth;      for the man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord      looketh on the heart.\"    MEMORY HYMN [354]        _\"O for a heart to praise my God.\"_          WORSHIP AND TOIL      One day about one hundred years ago a little boy named Jean stood by his  father's side watching the setting sun sink into the waves of the sea.  The glory of the scene stirred his boyish enthusiasm and he poured out  his heart in an ecstasy of joy. The father reverently took off his cap  and said, \"My son, it is God.\" The boy never forgot that word, \"It is  God.\"    Jean came of a peasant family, so he had to take his place in the field  and earn his bread \"by the sweat of his brow.\" On Sundays the fields  were forsaken and the family went to the village church where the father  was the leader of the choir. After church friends and relatives  sometimes came home to spend the afternoon with the family. One Sunday,  soon after the return from church, the bent figure of an aged peasant  slowly made his way along the road. There was something about the figure  that struck the boy Jean. He took a piece of charcoal and hurriedly drew  a sketch upon the wall. Every movement and attitude was so perfectly  depicted that everybody laughed--everybody but the father. He sensed the  gift possessed by his boy, whose growing talent he had been watching.  \"My Jean,\" he said, \"I will no longer hinder you from learning that  which you are so anxious to know.\"    Jean Francis Millet, for such is his full name, became the artist of  peasantry. He never made any other boast. His character was of the  highest. He had a firm faith in God. He believed in the Bible as the  Word of God. He looked upon his use of the brush as preaching upon  canvas the purity and truth he believed.    \"The Angelus\" is the name of the best known picture that he painted. It  shows two workers in a potato field, a man and a woman, who hear from  the near-by village the faint tones of the Angelus bell calling them to  prayer. They pause, stand erect, bow their heads and worship. It is a  beautiful picture. I hope you have a copy framed in your room.    MEMORY VERSE, _Luke_ 11: 1        \"Lord, teach us to pray.\"    MEMORY HYMN [495]        _\"From every stormy wind that blows.\"_          GOD'S CLOCK      Do you own a watch? If you do not now you will some day. I have a friend  whose watch came to him in this wise. His father said to him, \"When you  graduate from High School I will give you a watch.\"    Is there a \"town clock\" where you live? Is it dependable? Do men set  their watches by it? Do people, passing it, glance up to see if they are  late? In the village where I began my ministry the Baptist tower held  the town clock. I lived but a few doors away. I went to bed by it. I  studied by it. I was wakened by it. Even now, and many years have passed  since then, I can hear its clear bell strike the hours.    The strangest clock I ever saw was in China. I went up the West River to  the city of Canton. I was carried through the narrow, smelly, crowded  streets to the top of a little hill at the city's edge. There, on the  very tip-top I saw the \"Water Clock.\" I read, \"This water clock is a  most ancient, authentic, celebrated and sacred relic of Kwong Tung  Province, over 1,300 years old. It was erected on the top story of the  north"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14417"],[0,"The Agamemnon of Aeschylus (#4)"],[1,"ire, more Fire!\" And fire was reared,  Stintless and high, a stormy streaming beard,  That waved in flame beyond the promontory  Rock-ridged, that watches the Saronian sea,  Kindling the night: then one short swoop to catch  The Spider's Crag, our city's tower of watch;  Whence hither to the Atreidae's roof it came,  A light true-fathered of Idaean flame.  Torch-bearer after torch-bearer, behold  The tale thereof in stations manifold,  Each one by each made perfect ere it passed,  And Victory in the first as in the last.  These be my proofs and tokens that my lord  From Troy hath spoke to me a burning word.    LEADER.    Woman, speak on. Hereafter shall my prayer  Be raised to God; now let me only hear,  Again and full, the marvel and the joy.    CLYTEMNESTRA.    Now, even now, the Achaian holdeth Troy!  Methinks there is a crying in her streets  That makes no concord. When sweet unguent meets  With vinegar in one phial, I warrant none  Shall lay those wranglers lovingly at one.  So conquerors and conquered shalt thou hear,  Two sundered tones, two lives of joy or fear.    Here women in the dust about their slain,  Husbands or brethren, and by dead old men  Pale children who shall never more be free,  For all they loved on earth cry desolately.  And hard beside them war-stained Greeks, whom stark  Battle and then long searching through the dark  Hath gathered, ravenous, in the dawn, to feast  At last on all the plenty Troy possessed,  No portion in that feast nor ordinance,  But each man clutching at the prize of chance.  Aye, there at last under good roofs they lie  Of men spear-quelled, no frosts beneath the sky,  No watches more, no bitter moony dew....  How blessed they will sleep the whole night through!  Oh, if these days they keep them free from sin  Toward Ilion's conquered shrines and Them within  Who watch unconquered, maybe not again  The smiter shall be smit, the taker ta'en.  May God but grant there fall not on that host  The greed of gold that maddeneth and the lust  To spoil inviolate things! But half the race  Is run which windeth back to home and peace.  Yea, though of God they pass unchallenged,  Methinks the wound of all those desolate dead  Might waken, groping for its will....                                    Ye hear  A woman's word, belike a woman's fear.  May good but conquer in the last incline  Of the balance! Of all prayers that prayer is mine.    LEADER.    O Woman, like a man faithful and wise  Thou speakest. I accept thy testimonies  And turn to God with praising, for a gain  Is won this day that pays for all our pain.      [CLYTEMNESTRA _returns to the Palace. The_ CHORUS _take up their  position for the Second Stasimon._    AN ELDER.    0 Zeus, All-ruler, and Night the Aid,  Gainer of glories, and hast thou thrown  Over the towers of Ilion    Thy net close-laid,  That none so nimble and none so tall  Shall escape withal  The snare of the slaver that claspeth all?    ANOTHER.    And Zeus the Watcher of Friend and Friend  I also praise, who hath wrought this end.  Long since on Paris his shaft he drew,    And hath aimed true,  Not too soon falling nor yet too far,  The fire of the avenging star.    CHORUS.    (_This is God's judgement upon Troy. May it not be too fierce! Gold cannot  save one who spurneth Justice_.)    The stroke of Zeus hath found them! Clear this day    The tale, and plain to trace.  He judged, and Troy hath fallen.--And have men said  That God not deigns to mark man's hardihead,    Trampling to earth the grace  Of holy and delicate things?--Sin lies that way.  For visibly Pride doth breed its own return    On prideful men, who, when their houses swell      With happy wealth, breathe ever wrath and blood.  Yet not too fierce let the due vengeance burn;    Only as deemeth well      One wise of mood.        Never shall state nor gold        Shelter his heart from aching      Whoso the Altar of Justice old        Spurneth to Night unwaking.    (_The Sinner suffers in his longing till at last Temptation overcomes him;  as longing for Helen overcame Paris._)    The tempting of misery forceth him, the dread    Child of fore-scheming Woe!  And help is vain; the fell desire within  Is veiled not, but shineth bright like Sin:    And as false gold will show  Black where the touchstone trieth, so doth fade  His honour in God's ordeal. Like a child,    Forgetting all, he hath chased his winged bird,      And planted amid his people a sharp thorn.    And no God hears his prayer, or, have they heard,      The man so base-beguiled        They cast to scorn.          Paris to Argos came;          Love of a woman led him;        So God's altar he brought to shame,          Robbing the hand that fed him.    (_Helen's flight; the visions seen by the King's seers; the phantom of  Helen and the King's grief._)    She hath left among her people a noise of shield and sword,  A tramp of men armed where the long ships are moored;  She hath ta'en in her goings Desolation as a dower;  She hath stept, stept quickly, through the great gated Tower,      And the thing that could not be, it hath been!  And the Seers they saw visions, and they spoke of strange ill:    \"A Palace, a Palace; and a great King thereof:    A bed, a bed empty, that was once pressed in love:  And thou, thou, what art thou?  Let us be, thou so still,    Beyond wrath, beyond beseeching, to the lips reft of thee!\"    For she whom he desireth is beyond the deep sea,      And a ghost in his castle shall be queen.    Images in sweet guise    Carven shall move him never,  Where is Love amid empty eyes?    Gone, gone for ever!    (_His dreams and his suffering; but the War that he made caused greater  and wider suffering._)    But a shape that is a dream, 'mid the phantoms of the night,  Cometh near, full of tears, bringing vain vain delight:  For in vain when, desiring, he can feel the joy's breath  --Nevermore! Nevermore!--from his arms it vanisheth,      On wings down the pathways of sleep.    In the mid castle hall, on the hearthstone of the Kings,  These griefs there be, and griefs passing these,  But in each man's dwelling of the host that sailed the seas,  A sad woman waits; she has thoughts of many things,      And patience in her heart lieth deep.    Knoweth she them she sent,    Knoweth she? Lo, returning,  Comes in stead of the man that went    Armour and dust of burning.    (_The return of the funeral urns; the murmurs of the People._)    And the gold-changer, Ares, who changeth quick for dead,  Who poiseth his scale in the striving of the spears,  Back from Troy sendeth dust, heavy dust, wet with tears,  Sendeth ashes with men's names in his urns neatly spread.  And they weep over the men, and they praise them one by one,  How this was a wise fighter, and this nobly-slain--      \"Fighting to win back another's wife!\"  Till a murmur is begun,    And there steals an angry pain      Against Kings too forward in the strife.          There by Ilion's gate          Many a soldier sleepeth,        Young men beautiful; fast in hate          Troy her conqueror keepeth.    (_For the Shedder of Blood is in great peril, and not unmarked by God. May  I never be a Sacker of Cities!_)    But the rumour of the People, it is heavy, it is chill;  And tho' no curse be spoken, like a curse doth it brood;  And my heart waits some tiding which the dark holdeth still,  For of God not unmarked is the shedder of much blood.  And who conquers beyond right ... Lo, the life of man decays;    There be Watchers dim his light in the wasting of the years;      He falls, he is forgotten, and hope dies.  There is peril in the praise    Over-praised that he hears;      For the thunder it is hurled from God's eyes.          Glory that breedeth strife,          Pride of the Sacker of Cities;        Yea, and the conquered captive's life,          Spare me, O God of Pities!    DIVERS ELDERS.    --The fire of good tidings it hath sped the city through,  But who knows if a god mocketh? Or who knows if all be true?

Soon surely shall we read the message right;  Were fire and beacon-call and lamps of light  True speakers, or but happy lights, that seem  And are not, like sweet voices in a dream.  I see a Herald yonder by the shore,  Shadowed with olive sprays. And from his sore  Rent raiment cries a witness from afar,  Dry Dust, born brother to the Mire of war,  That mute he comes not, neither through the smoke  Of mountain forests shall his tale be spoke;  But either shouting for a joyful day,  Or else.... But other thoughts I cast away.  As good hath dawned, may good shine on, we pray!    --And whoso for this City prayeth aught    Else, let him reap the harvest of his thought!      [_Enter the_ HERALD, _running. His garments are torn and war-stained. He  falls upon his knees and kisses the Earth, and salutes each Altar in  turn._    HERALD.    Land of my fathers! Argos!
