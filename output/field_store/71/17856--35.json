They are kind to others,  and in return they expect others to be kind to them. In some countries  across the sea there are fairies called Hillmen.    Now, there once lived a certain housewife who liked to make bargains.  She gave away only those things for which she had no use, and then  expected always to get something in return.    One day a Hillman knocked at her door.    \"Can you lend us a saucepan?\" he asked. \"There's a wedding on the hill,  and all the pots are in use.\"    \"Is he to have one?\" whispered the servant who opened the door.    \"Aye, to be sure,\" answered the housewife; \"one must be neighborly. Get  the saucepan for him, lass.\"    The maid turned to take a good saucepan from the shelf, but the  housewife stopped her.    \"Not that, not that,\" she whispered. \"Get the old one out of the  cupboard. It leaks, but that doesn't matter. The Hillmen are so neat and  are such nimble workers that they are sure to mend it before they send  it home. I can oblige the fairies and save sixpence in tinkering, too.\"    The maid brought the old saucepan that had been laid by until the  tinker's next visit, and gave it to the Hillman. He thanked her and went  away.    When the saucepan was returned, it had been neatly mended, just as the  housewife thought it would be.    At night the maid filled the pan with milk and set it on the fire to  heat for the children's supper. In a few moments the milk was so smoked  and burnt that no one would touch it. Even the pigs refused to drink it.    \"Ah, you good-for-nothing!\" cried the housewife. \"There's a quart of  milk wasted at once.\"    \"And that's twopence,\" cried a queer little voice that seemed to come  from the chimney.    The housewife filled the saucepan again and set it over the fire. It had  not been there more than two minutes before it boiled over and was burnt  and smoked as before.    \"The pan must be dirty,\" muttered the woman, who was very much vexed.  \"Two full quarts of milk have been wasted.\"    \"And that's fourpence!\" added the queer little voice from the chimney.    The saucepan was scoured; then it was filled with milk the third time  and set over the fire. Again the milk boiled over and was spoiled.    Now the housewife was quite vexed. \"I have never had anything like this  to happen since I first kept house,\" she exclaimed. \"Three quarts of  milk wasted!\"    \"And that's sixpence,\" cried the queer little voice from the chimney.  \"You didn't save the tinkering after all, mother!\"    With that the Hillman himself came tumbling from the chimney and ran off  laughing. But from that time, the saucepan was as good as any other.    --JULIANA H. EWING.    [Illustration: The Hillman running off from the fire]          [Illustration: The Elf and the Dormouse under the toadstool]    THE ELF AND THE DORMOUSE        Under a toad stool      Crept a wee Elf,    Out of the rain      To shelter himself.      Under the toad stool      Sound asleep,    Sat a big Dormouse      All in a heap.      Trembled the wee Elf      Frightened, and yet    Fearing to fly away      Lest he get wet.      To the next shelter--      Maybe a mile!    Sudden the wee Elf      Smiled a wee smile;      Tugged till the toad stool      Toppled in two;    Holding it over him,      Gayly he flew.      Soon he was safe home,      Dry as could be.    Soon woke the Dormouse--      \"Good gracious me!      \"Where is my toad stool?\"      Loud he lamented.    And that's how umbrellas      First were invented.    --OLIVER HERFORD.    [Illustration: The elf flying away with the toadstool as the Dormouse  watches]          THE BELL OF ATRI    I      Good King John of Atri loved his people very much and wished to see them  happy. He knew, however, that some were not; he knew that many suffered  wrongs which were not righted. This made him sad.    One day the king thought of a way to help his people. He had a great  bell hung in a tower in the market place. He had the rope made so long  that a child could reach it.    Then the king sent heralds through the streets to tell the people why he  had put the bell in the market place. The heralds blew their trumpets  long and loud, and the people came from their homes to hear the message.    \"Know ye,\" cried a herald, \"that whenever a wrong is done to any man, he  has but to ring the great bell in the square. A judge will go to the  tower to hear the complaint, and he will see that justice is done.\"    \"Long live our good king!\" shouted the people. \"Now our wrongs shall be  righted.\"    And so it was. Whenever anyone was wronged, he rang the bell in the  tower. The judge put on his rich robes and went there. He listened to  the complaint, and the guilty were punished.    The people in Atri were now very happy, and the days went swiftly by.  The bell hung in its place year after year, and it was rung many times.  By and by the rope became so worn that one could scarcely reach it.    The king said, \"Why, a child could not reach the rope now, and a wrong  might not be righted. I must put in a new one.\"    So he ordered a rope from a distant town. In those days it took a long  time to travel from one town to another. What should they do if somebody  wished to ring the bell before the new rope came?    \"We must mend the rope in some way,\" said a man.    \"Here,\" said another; \"take this piece of grapevine and fasten it to the  rope. Then it will be long enough for any one to reach.\"    This was done, and for some time the bell was rung in that way.      II      One hot summer noon everything was very still. All the people were  indoors taking their noonday rest.    Suddenly they were awakened by the arousing bell:      Some one--hath done--a wrong,    Hath done--a wrong!    Hath done--a wrong!    The judge started from a deep sleep, turned on his couch, and listened.  Could it be the bell of justice?    Again the sound came:      Some one--hath done--a wrong!    Hath done--a wrong!    Hath done--a wrong!    It was the bell of justice. The judge put on his rich robes and,  panting, hurried to the market place.    There he saw a strange sight: a poor steed, starved and thin, tugging at  the vines which were fastened to the bell. A great crowd had gathered  around.    \"Whose horse is this?\" the judge asked.    \"It is the horse of the rich soldier who lives in the castle,\" said a  man. \"He has served his master long and well, and has saved his life  many times. Now that the horse is too old to work, the master turns him  out. He wanders through the lanes and fields, picking up such food as  can be found.\"    \"His call for justice shall be heard,\" said the judge. \"Bring the  soldier to me.\"    The soldier tried to treat the matter as a jest. Then he grew angry and  said in an undertone, \"One can surely do what he pleases with his own.\"    [Illustration: The judge sees the horse in the market place]    \"For shame!\" cried the judge. \"Has the horse not served you for many  years? And has he not saved your life? You must build a good shelter for  him, and give him the best grain and the best pasture. Take the horse  home and be as true to him as he has been to you.\"    The soldier hung his head in shame and led the horse away. The people  shouted and applauded.    \"Great is King John,\" they cried, \"and great the bell of Atri!\"    --ITALIAN TALE.          A DUMB WITNESS      One day at noontime a poor man was riding along a road. He was tired and  hungry, and wished to stop and rest. Finding a tree with low branches,  he tied his horse to one of them. Then he sat down to eat his dinner.    Soon a rich man came along and started to tie his horse to the same  tree.    \"Do not fasten your horse to that tree,\" cried the poor man. \"My horse  is savage and he may kill yours. Fasten him to another tree.\"    \"I shall tie my horse where I wish,\" the rich man replied; and he tied  his horse to the same tree. Then he, too, sat down to eat.    Very soon the men heard a great noise. They looked up and saw that their  horses were kicking and fighting. Both men rushed to stop them, but it  was too late; the rich man's horse was dead.    \"See what your horse has done!\" cried the rich man in an angry voice.  \"But you shall pay for it! You shall pay for it!\"    Then he dragged the man before a judge.    \"Oh, wise judge,\" he cried, \"I have come to you for justice. I had a  beautiful, kind, gentle horse which has been killed by this man's savage  horse. Make the man pay for the horse or send him to prison.\"    \"Not so fast, my friend,\" the judge said. \"There are two sides to every  case.\"    He turned to the poor man. \"Did your horse kill this man's horse?\" he  asked.    The poor man made no reply.    The judge asked in surprise, \"Are you dumb? Can you not talk?\"    But no word came from the poor man's lips.    Then the judge turned to the rich man.    \"What more can I do?\" he asked. \"You see for yourself this poor man  cannot speak.\"    \"Oh, but he can,\" cried the rich man. \"He spoke to me.\"    \"Indeed!\" said the judge. \"When?\"    \"He spoke to me when I tied my horse to the tree.\"    \"What did he say?\" asked the judge.    \"He said, 'Do not fasten your horse to that tree. My horse is savage and  may kill yours.'\"    \"0 ho!\" said the judge. \"This poor man warned you that his horse was  savage, and you tied your horse near his after the warning. This puts a  new light on the matter. You are to blame, not he.\"    The judge turned to the poor man and said, \"My man, why did you not  answer my questions?\"    \"Oh, wise judge,\" said the poor man, \"if I had told you that I warned  him not to tie his horse near mine, he would have denied it. Then how  could you have told which one of us to believe? I let him tell his own  story, and you have learned the truth.\"    This speech pleased the judge. He praised the poor man for his wisdom,  and sent the rich man away without a penny.    --ARABIAN TALE.

I called it the 'Female Club' instead of  'An Old Maids Club,' as Mr Zangwill did, for there were no old maids  waiting near the oven.    \"Most of them come as early as 5 a.m., and none care to leave till they  have their cakes baked, for, if you do, your tins will be pushed aside  as you are not there to scream at and scold the baker--if someone slips  a copper into his hand he, on the quiet, puts their tins in first,  though they may have come later!    \"Besides, if you are not there to watch carefully (for the tins are not  named or numbered), someone might take your tins in exchange for his  own, if the cakes, etc., look more tempting. During Purim this is not  looked upon as stealing, but merely as a joke or a bit of fun. The  youngsters will not move an inch unless they can trust someone to take  their place. So I leave you to try to imagine the noise and the chatter.  There is probably not a thing that has happened in Jerusalem during the  last two months that is not discussed around the public oven while  people are waiting for their cake-tins; and, as everyone wants to talk  rather than to listen, the noise is like the buzz in a factory.    \"After all the cooking and so forth was finished, of course we had to  keep the Fast of Esther, and everyone, even babies went to Shule to hear  the Megilla (the _Book of Esther_) read; and, when the Chazan came to  Haman, the Gragers went off with just such a noise as they do in the  London Shules in Old Montague Street or Booth Street. Then we went home;  and after the evening meal the joyfulness began, for they did not wait  till the next day, as we do in England.    \"As only one room was lighted up by each family to economize light and  for other reasons--there are no curtains or blinds to draw down--we were  able to go through all Meah Sheorim and stop a minute or two at every  lighted window and watch the goings on. We heard nothing but singing and  clapping of hands, while the children danced. Sometimes one of the  elders looking on could not resist joining in the fun, and tied his  kaftan behind his back so as to leave his legs free, put one of the  youngsters on his shoulders, and danced like a chassid or a jolly  Irishman.    \"As we went from house to house peeping in at the windows, sometimes  some of the family would come out and drag us in by force, and make us  drink wine and eat cakes. If we did not wish to join in the dancing, but  wanted to leave, they would just say 'Shalom'--'go in peace but come  again.' I can tell you it was jolly, and nowhere else in all the world  could Yomtov be kept up as it is here.    \"We were given wine in so many houses that from the eldest to the  youngest we were beginning to feel rather funny. Next morning, after  being well shaken up by Father, and after we had had a wash with cold  water in the open air, we made up our minds to be firmer at the next  Purim.    \"After going in the morning to hear the Chazan again, and coming home  and enjoying the Hamantaschen and other good things, then begins the  pleasure and excitement of sending Shalach-manoth to friends,  acquaintances, and chiefly to the poor, and even to enemies if you have  any. As you are supposed, if possible, to send back to the sender  something similar to what is sent to you, things cannot be made ready  beforehand. To the poor you always send useful presents as well as  delicacies which are likely to last them for months or longer.    \"As to the beggars, I never imagined there could be so many in one  country. We generally get enough beggars coming to us on Fridays and  before holy days, but at Yom Kippur and Purim they come in crowds. Most  of them are Sephardim and Yeminites. It is true you give each of them  only a para, which is about a quarter of a farthing, and they give you a  blessing for it; but, if they come to a rich class of home and are not  given there according to the style of the house, they upbraid the  people, and even curse them, so the children are told to stand at the  doors with paras and cakes, etc. At some houses they are invited in.  Each carries a sack on his shoulder, expecting, I suppose, that it will  be filled with good things by the time Purim is over; and, as they never  pass a door without begging, they are not likely to be disappointed.    \"The fun I enjoyed best was the uncovering of our plates and seeing what  Shalach-monus had been sent to us. A cap had been sent to Father, made  of velvet, with tails of sable and other skins round it. Father felt  very downcast, for he did not at all like the idea of giving up wearing  the high hat that he always wore in London on Sabbaths and holidays.  Whether he will wear the velvet schtramel or not I cannot tell, but I  will wait and see who wins--Father or the community--for we have some  idea who sent it.    \"Mother received a beautiful, soft silk kerchief to wear on her head,  and it seemed a sign that the community wanted her to put her wig aside  and wear a kerchief instead. I was most thankful they did not send me a  pair of scissors. If they had, I should have thought they wanted me to  cut my plaits off. Well, I should have fought for my hair as I would for  life!    \"In the afternoon I went to visit some friends, and I found a house full  of men, young and old, with their schtramel on their heads, and their  kaftans tied back, singing at the very top of their voices (and some  have very fine voices); others were clapping their hands, while eight  men, four on each side, were dancing what looked like a pantomime ballet  that I once went to. It was simply grand to watch them, for some were  old men with long, white beards, while others were serious-looking  young men who are to be seen daily in the street walking to and from  their homes and Shules, always deep in thought and so very  serious-looking that you would imagine that they did not know how to  smile. Here they were, on this Purim afternoon, dancing with all their  might, and with bright, smiling eyes! You could see it was not wine that  had made them bright and cheery: it was the spirit, or fire, of their  religious zeal commemorating with thankfulness the anniversary of the  day when their nation was saved from destruction. Of course I was too  fascinated watching them at the time to think this was the reason for  this unusual sight.    \"After a while, they went to pay visits to the Rav and to others who  were scholars or pious men in the community. Often when walking to the  various houses they would catch hold of others and dance with them in  the open streets as you see children doing when an organ-grinder plays.    \"I was so attracted by them, and so was everyone who saw them, that we  followed them at a respectful distance. Sometimes someone had had a  little too much wine when visiting and it had gone to his head. Then  some of the party would say: 'Ah well, it is Purim--there is no shame.'      \"I told Father this when I returned home, and he explained to me that  their rejoicing during Purim did not mean simply a material  satisfaction--it was a spiritual rejoicing, as on Simhath Torah, when  the Reading of the Law was started again, so that during Purim and  Simhath Torah allowance is made if a little more wine is taken than is  usually the case.    \"Then we had Purim Schpielers, who visited every house, dressed up very  funnily and full of jokes; some acted, and some were disguised. In fact,  it was the happiest Purim I have ever spent, and I doubt if there is any  other place where it could be spent so happily. For here in Jerusalem we  are all like one large family: respect is paid to the righteous and to  worthy scholars, whether they are poor or rich. Money has not the same  power here. There is a good deal of quarrelling and mischief going on  among our female neighbours, but the quarrels are not very serious but  more like quarrels in a large family. In another letter I will write  about our 'Female Club.'\"          THE BAKING OF THE MATZOS      Friday evening came round again, and the friends of the Jacob family  were comfortably seated in the bright cellar-kitchen, eagerly waiting to  hear another letter read, for old and young were equally interested in  hearing details of life in Palestine so many years ago.    On coming in with a letter Mr Jacob said: \"As preparation for the  Passover is not far off, I think it will interest you to hear how it was  done in Palestine.\"    They all agreed, so he began:    \"My dear Jacob,--Please forgive my not having written sooner, but I have  really been too busy. We have just had Passover. I think you will be  glad to hear how we prepared for it here. Each family is forced to bake  its own matzos, as none can be bought from abroad. It was no easy  matter, I can tell you, especially the baking, and it is a good thing we  had strong teeth, as the matzos are not rolled out as thin as in London  and are pretty hard to eat. There's a lot of fun attached to making  matzos, but I am thankful the baking comes only once a year.    \"As each family in turn gets the use of the public baking-oven, it is  necessary to start soon after Purim to prepare the special flour used  for matzos. In every house a room is set apart and thoroughly cleansed  for the wheat, which is laid out on large trays. Then during the winter  it is examined by the mother and girls to see that no dust be mixed with  it, and sometimes neighbours come in and help. All who enter this room  must have very clean hands; even the finger-nails must be carefully  cleaned, and clean clothes put on, so that there is no chance of any  chometz. When enough of the best grains have been selected, they are  washed, dried, and then ground into flour.    \"As each family's turn comes round for the use of the bakehouse, those  who help always wash very carefully and put on clean overalls; also new  cooking-utens"]]]
