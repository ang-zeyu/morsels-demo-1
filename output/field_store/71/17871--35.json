[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15483"],[0,"Rambles and Recollections of an Indian Official (#4)"],[1,"views are stated with absolute precision  in a letter written in 1854 or 1855, and published in _The Times_ in  November, 1857:     We have no right to annex or confiscate Oude; but we have a right,  under the treaty of 1837, to take the management of it, but not to  appropriate its revenues to ourselves. We can do this with honour to  our Government and benefit to the people. To confiscate would be  dishonest and dishonourable. To annex would be to give the people a  government almost as bad as their own, if we put our screw upon them  (_Journey_, ed. 1858, vol. i, Intro., p. xxi).    The earnest efforts of the Resident to suppress crime and improve the  administration of Oudh aroused the bitter resentment of a corrupt  court and exposed his life to constant danger. Three deliberate  attempts to assassinate him at Lucknow are recorded.    The first, in December, 1851, is described in detail in a letter of  Sleeman's dated the 16th of that month, and less fully by General  Hervey, in _Some Records of Crime_, vol. ii, p. 479. The Resident's  life was saved by a gallant orderly named Tikaram, who was badly  wounded. Inquiry proved that the crime was instigated by the King's  moonshee.    The second attempt, on October 9, 1853, is fully narrated in an  official letter to the Government of India (Bibliography, No. 15).  Its failure may be reasonably ascribed to a special interposition of  Providence. The Resident during all the years he had lived at Lucknow  had been in the habit of sleeping in an upper chamber approached by a  separate private staircase guarded by two sentries. On the night  mentioned the sentries were drugged and two men stole up the stairs.  They slashed at the bed with their swords, but found it empty,  because on that one occasion General Sleeman had slept in another  room.    The third attempt was not carried as far, and the exact date is not  ascertainable, but the incident is well remembered by the family and  occurred between 1853 and 1856. One day the Resident was crossing his  study when, for some reason or another, he looked behind a curtain  screening a recess. He then saw a man standing there with a large  knife in his hand. General Sleeman, who was unarmed, challenged the  man as being a Thug. He at once admitted that he was such, and under  the spell of a master-spirit allowed himself to be disarmed without  resistance. He had been employed at the Residency for some time,  unsuspected.    Such personal risks produced no effect on the stout heart of Sleeman,  who continued, unshaken and undismayed, his unselfish labours.    In 1854 the long strain of forty-five years' service broke down  Sleeman's strong constitution. He tried to regain health by a visit  to the hills, but this expedient proved ineffectual, and he was  ordered home. On the 10th of February, 1856, while on his way home on  board the Monarch, he died off Ceylon, at the age of sixty-seven, and  was buried at sea, just six days after he had been granted the  dignity of K.C.B.    Lord Dalhousie's desire to meet his trusted officer was never  gratified. The following correspondence between the Governor-General  and Sleeman, now published for the first time, is equally creditable  to both parties:                    BARRACKPORE PARK,                  January 9th, 1856.   MY DEAR GENERAL SLEEMAN,   I have heard to-day of your arrival in Calcutta, and have heard at  the same time with sincere concern that you are still suffering in  health. A desire to disturb you as little as possible induces me to  have recourse to my pen, in order to convey to you a communication  which I had hoped to be able to make in person.   Some time since, when adjusting the details connected with my  retirement from the Government of India, I solicited permission to  recommend to Her Majesty's gracious consideration the names of some  who seemed to me to be worthy of Her Majesty's favour. My request was  moderate. I asked only to be allowed to submit the name of one  officer from each Presidency. The name which is selected from the  Bengal army was your own, and I ventured to express my hope that Her  Majesty would be pleased to mark her sense of the long course of  able, and honourable, and distinguished service through which you had  passed, by conferring upon you the civil cross of a Knight Commander  of the Bath.   As yet no reply has been received to my letter. But as you have now  arrived at the Presidency, I lose no time in making known to you what  has been done; in the hope that you will receive it as a proof of the  high estimation in which your services and character arc held, as  well by myself as by the entire community of India.              I beg to remain,                 My dear General,                   Very truly yours,                     DALHOUSIE.    Major-General Sleeman.    Reply to above. Dated 11th January, 1856.    MY LORD,   I was yesterday evening favoured with your Lordship's most kind and  flattering letter of the 9th instant from Barrackpore.   I cannot adequately express how highly honoured I feel by the  mention that you have been pleased to make of my services to Her  Majesty the Queen, and how much gratified I am by this crowning act  of kindness from your Lordship in addition to the many favours I have  received at your hands during the last eight years; and whether it  may, or may not, be my fate to live long enough to see the honourable  rank actually conferred upon me, which you have been so considerate  and generous as to ask for me, the letter now received from your  Lordship will of itself be deemed by my family as a substantial  honour, and it will so preserved, I trust, by my son, with feelings  of honest pride, at the thought that his father had merited such a  mark of distinction from so eminent a statesman as the Marquis of  Dalhousie.   My right hand is so crippled by rheumatism that I am obliged to make  use of an amanuensis to write this letter, and my bodily strength is  so much reduced, that I cannot hope before embarking for England to  pay my personal respects to your Lordship.   Under these unfortunate circumstances, I now beg to take my leave of  your Lordship; to offer my unfeigned and anxious wishes for your  Lordship's health and happiness, and with every sentiment of respect  and gratitude, to subscribe myself,              Your Lordship's most faithful and                Obedient servant,                    W. H. SLEEMAN,                      Major-General.     To the Most Noble        The Marquis of Dalhousie, K.T.,           Governor-General, &c., &c.,              Calcutta.    Sir William Sleeman was an accomplished Oriental linguist, well  versed in Arabic, Persian, and Urdu, and also in possession of a good  working knowledge of Latin, Greek, and French. His writings afford  many proofs of his keen interest in the sciences of geology,  agricultural chemistry, and political economy, and of his intelligent  appreciation of the lessons taught by history. Nor was he insensible  to the charms of art, especially those of poetry. His favourite  authors among the poets seem to have been Shakespeare, Milton, Scott,  Wordsworth, and Cowper. His knowledge of the customs and modes of  thought of the natives of India, rarely equalled and never surpassed,  was more than half the secret of his notable success as an  administrator. The greatest achievement of his busy and unselfish  life was the suppression of the system of organized murder known as  Thuggee, and in the execution of that prolonged and onerous task he  displayed the most delicate tact, the keenest sagacity, and the  highest power of organization.    His own words are his best epitaph: 'I have gone on quietly,' he  writes, '\"through evil and through good report\", doing, to the best  of my ability, the duties which it has pleased the Government of  India, from time to time, to confide to me in the manner which  appeared to me most conformable to its wishes and its honour,  satisfied and grateful for the trust and confidence which enabled me  to do so much good for the people, and to secure so much of their  attachment and gratitude to their rulers.' [5]    His grandson. Captain J. L. Sleeman, who, when stationed in India  from 1903 to 1908, visited the scenes of his grandfather's labours,  states that everywhere he found the memory of his respected ancestor  revered, and was given the assurance that no Englishman had ever  understood the native of India so well, or removed so many oppressive  evils as General Sir W. H. Sleeman, and that his memory would endure  for ever in the Empire to which he devoted his life's work.    This necessarily meagre account of a life which deserves more ample  commemoration may be fitly closed by a few words concerning the  relatives and descendants of Sir William Sleeman.    His sister and regular correspondent, to whom he dedicated the  _Rambles and Recollections_, was married to Captain Furse, R.N.     His brother's son James came out to India in 1827, joined the 73rd  Regiment of the Bengal Army, was selected for employment in the  Political Department, and was thus enabled to give valuable aid in  the campaign against Thuggee. In due course he was appointed to the  office of General Superintendent of the Operations against Thuggee,  which had been held by his uncle. He rose to the rank of Colonel, and  after a long period of excellent service, lived to enjoy nearly  thirty years of honourable retirement. He died at his residence near  Ross in 1899 at the age of eighty-one.    In 1831 Sir William's only son, Henry Arthur, was gazetted to the  16th (Queen's) Lancers, and having retired early from the army, with  the rank of Captain, died in 1905.    His elder son William Henry died while serving with the Mounted  Infantry during the South African War. His younger son, James Lewis,  a Captain in the Royal Sussex Regiment, who also saw active service  during the war, and was mentioned in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15488"],[0,"Woman's Life in Colonial Days (#4)"],[1,"an eye, and a  tooth for a tooth.\" Moses Coit Tyler has declared in his _History of  American Literature_:[2] \"They did not attempt to combine the sacred and  the secular; they simply abolished the secular and left only the sacred.  The state became the church; the king a priest; politics a department of  theology; citizenship the privilege of those only who had received  baptism and the Lord's Supper.\"    And what an idea of the sacred was theirs! The gentleness, the mercy,  the loving kindness that are of God so seldom enter into those ancient  discussions that such attributes are almost negligible. Michael  Wigglesworth's poem, _The Day of Doom_, published in 1662, may be  considered as an authoritative treatise on the theology of the Puritans;  for it not only was so popular as to receive several reprints, but was  sanctioned by the elders of the church themselves. If this was  orthodoxy--and the proof that it was is evident--it was of a sort that  might well sour and embitter the nature of man and fill the gentle soul  of womanhood with fear and dark forebodings. We well know that the  Puritans thoroughly believed that man's nature was weak and sinful, and  that the human soul was a prisoner placed here upon earth by the Creator  to be surrounded with temptations. This God is good, however, in that he  has given man an opportunity to overcome the surrounding evils.        \"But I'm a prisoner,        Under a heavy chain;      Almighty God's afflicting hand,        Doth me by force restrain.               *       *       *       *       *        \"But why should I complain        That have so good a God,      That doth mine heart with comfort fill        Ev'n whilst I feel his rod?               *       *       *       *       *        \"Let God be magnified,        Whose everlasting strength      Upholds me under sufferings        Of more than ten years' length.\"    The _Day of Doom_ is, in the main, its author's vision of judgment day,  and, whatever artistic or theological defects it may have, it undeniably  possesses realism. For instance, several stanzas deal with one of the  most dreadful doctrines of the Puritan faith, that all infants who died  unbaptized entered into eternal torment--a theory that must have  influenced profoundly the happiness and woe of colonial women. The poem  describes for us what was then believed should be the scene on that  final day when young and old, heathen and Christian, saint and sinner,  are called before their God to answer for their conduct in the flesh.  Hear the plea of the infants, who dying, at birth before baptism could  be administered, asked to be relieved from punishment on the grounds  that they have committed no sin.        \"If for our own transgression,        or disobedience,      We here did stand at thy left hand,        just were the Recompense;      But Adam's guilt our souls hath spilt,        his fault is charg'd upon us;      And that alone hath overthrown and utterly        undone us.\"    Pointing out that it was Adam who ate of the tree and that they were  innocent, they ask:        \"O great Creator, why was our nature        depraved and forlorn?      Why so defil'd, and made so vil'd,        whilst we were yet unborn?      If it be just, and needs we must        transgressors reckon'd be,      Thy mercy, Lord, to us afford,        which sinners hath set free.\"    But the Creator answers:        \"God doth such doom forbid,      That men should die eternally        for what they never did.      But what you call old Adam's fall,        and only his trespass,      You call amiss to call it his,        both his and yours it was.\"    The Judge then inquires why, since they would have received the  pleasures and joys which Adam could have given them, the rewards and  blessings, should they hesitate to share his \"treason.\"        \"Since then to share in his welfare,        you could have been content,      You may with reason share in his treason,        and in the punishment,      Hence you were born in state forlorn,        with natures so depraved      Death was your due because that you        had thus yourselves behaved.               *       *       *       *       *        \"Had you been made in Adam's stead,        you would like things have wrought,      And so into the self-same woe        yourselves and yours have brought.\"    Then follows a reprimand upon the part of the judge because they should  presume to question His judgments, and to ask for mercy:        \"Will you demand grace at my hand,        and challenge what is mine?      Will you teach me whom to set free,        and thus my grace confine.        \"You sinners are, and such a share        as sinners may expect;      Such you shall have, for I do save        none but mine own Elect.        \"Yet to compare your sin with theirs        who liv'd a longer time,      I do confess yours is much less        though every sin's a crime.        \"A crime it is, therefore in bliss        you may not hope to dwell;      But unto you I shall allow        the easiest room in Hell.\"    Would not this cause anguish to the heart of any mother? Indeed, we  shall never know what intense anxiety the Puritan woman may have  suffered during the few days intervening between the hour of the birth  and the date of the baptism of her infant. It is not surprising,  therefore, that an exceedingly brief period was allowed to elapse before  the babe was taken from its mother's arms and carried through snow and  wind to the desolate church. Judge Sewall, whose _Diary_ covers most of  the years from 1686 to 1725, and who records every petty incident from  the cutting of his finger to the blowing off of the Governor's hat, has  left us these notes on the baptism of some of his fourteen children:    \"April 8, 1677. Elizabeth Weeden, the Midwife, brought the infant to  the third Church when Sermon was about half done in the afternoon ...  I named him John.\" (Five days after birth.)[3] \"Sabbath-day, December  13th 1685. Mr. Willard baptizeth my Son lately born, whom I named  Henry.\" (Four days after birth.)[4] \"February 6, 1686-7. Between 3 and  4 P.M. Mr. Willard baptized my Son, whom I named Stephen.\" (Five days  after birth.)[5]    Little wonder that infant mortality was exceedingly high, especially  when the baptismal service took place on a day as cold as this one  mentioned by Sewall: \"Sabbath, Janr. 24 ... This day so cold that the  Sacramental Bread is frozen pretty hard, and rattles sadly as broken  into the Plates.\"[6] We may take it for granted that the water in the  font was rapidly freezing, if not entirely frozen, and doubtless the  babe, shrinking under the icy touch, felt inclined to give up the  struggle for existence, and decline a further reception into so cold  and forbidding a world. Once more hear a description by the kindly,  but abnormally orthodox old Judge: \"Lord's Day, Jany 15, 1715-16. An  extraordinary Cold Storm of Wind and Snow.... Bread was frozen at the  Lord's Table: Though 'twas so Cold, yet John Tuckerman was baptised.  At six a-clock my ink freezes so that I can hardly write by a good  fire in my Wive's Chamber. Yet was very Comfortable at Meeting. Laus  Deo.\"[7]    But let us pass to other phases of this theology under which the Puritan  woman lived. The God pictured in the _Day of Doom_ not only was of a  cruel and angry nature but was arbitrary beyond modern belief. His wrath  fell according to his caprice upon sinner or saint. We are tempted to  inquire as to the strange mental process that could have led any human  being to believe in such a Creator. Regardless of doctrine, creed, or  theology, we cannot totally dissociate our earthly mental condition from  that in the future state; we cannot refuse to believe that we shall have  the same intelligent mind, and the same ability to understand, perceive,  and love. Apparently, however, the Puritan found no difficulty in  believing that the future existence entailed an entire change in the  principles of love and in the emotions of sympathy and pity.          \"He that was erst a husband pierc'd          with sense of wife's distress,        Whose tender heart did bear a part          of all her grievances.        Shall mourn no more as heretofore,            because of her ill plight,        Although he see her now to be            a damn'd forsaken wight.          \"The tender mother will own no other            of all her num'rous brood        But such as stand at Christ's right hand,            acquitted through his Blood.        The pious father had now much rather            his graceless son should lie        In hell with devils, for all his evils,            burning eternally.\"                          (_Day of Doom._)    But we do not have to trust to Michael Wigglesworth's poem alone for a  realistic conception of the God and the religion of the Puritans. It is  in the sermons of the day that we discover a still more unbending,  harsh, and hideous view of the Creator and his characteristics. In the  thunderings of Cotton Mather and Jonathan Edwards, we, like the colonial  women who sat so meekly in the high, hard benches, may fairly smell the  brimstone of the Nether World. Why, exclaims Jonathan Edwards in his  sermon, _The Eternity of Hell Torments_:    \"Do but consider what it is to suffer extreme torment forever and ever;  to suffer it day and night, from one day to another, from one year to  another, from one age to another, from one thousand ages to another, and  so, adding age to age, and thousands to thousands, in pain, in wailing  and lamenting, groaning and shrieking, and gnashing your teeth; with  your souls full of dreadful grief and amazement, with your bodies and  every member full of racking torture, without any possibility of  getting ease; without any possibility of moving God to pity by your  cries; without any possibility of hiding yourselves from him.... How  dismal will it be, when you are under "]]]
