[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14992"],[0,"The Life of Froude (#4)"],[1," a spell. Froude  attended his sermons, and was fascinated still more. For a time,  however, the effect was merely aesthetic. The young man enjoyed the  voice, the eloquence, the thinking power of the preacher as he might  have enjoyed a sonata of Beethoven's. But his acquaintance with the  reading men was not kept up, and he led an idle, luxurious life.  Nobody then dreamt of an Oxford Commission, and the Colleges, like  the University, were left to themselves. They were not economically  managed, and the expenses of the undergraduates were heavy. Their  battels were high, and no check was put upon the bills which they  chose to run up with tradesmen. Froude spent his father's: money,  and enjoyed himself. The dissipation was not flagrant. He was never  a sensualist, nor a Sybarite. Even then he had a frugal mind, and  knew well the value of money. \"I remember,\" he says in The Oxford  Counter Reformation, an autobiographical essay--\"I remember  calculating that I could have lived at a boarding-house on contract,  with every luxury which I had in college, at a reduction of fifty  per cent.\"* He was not given to coarse indulgence, and idleness was  probably his worst sin at Oxford. But his innocence of evil was not  ignorance; and though he never led a fast life himself, he knew  perfectly well how those lived who did.    --  * Short Studies on Great Subjects, 4th series, p. 180.  --    An intellect like Froude's seldom slumbers long. He had to attend  lectures, and his old love of Homer revived. Plato opened a new  world, a word which never grows old, and becomes fresher the more it  is explored. Herodotus proved more charming than The Arabian Nights.  Thucydides showed how much wisdom may be contained in the form of  history. Froude preferred Greek to Latin, and sat up at night to  read the Philoctetes, the only work of literature that ever moved  him to tears. Aeschylus divided his allegiance with Sophocles. But  the author who most completely mastered him, and whom he most  completely mastered, was Pindar. The Olympian Odes seemed to him  like the Elgin Marbles in their serene and unapproachable splendour.  All this classical reading, though it cannot have been fruitless,  was not done systematically for the schools. Froude had no ambition,  believing that he should soon die. But a reading-party during the  Long Vacation of 1839 resulted in an engagement, which changed the  course of his life.    Hitherto he had been under the impression that nobody cared for him  at all, and that it mattered not what became of him. The sense of  being valued by another person made him value himself. He became  ambitious, and worked hard for his degree. He remembered how the  master of his first school had prophesied that he would be a Bishop.  He did not want to be a Bishop, but he began to think that such  grandeur would not have been predicted of a fool. Abandoning his  idle habits, he read night and day that he might distinguish himself  in the young lady's eyes. After six months her father interfered. He  had no confidence in the stability of this very young suitor's  character, and he put an end to the engagement. Froude was stunned  by the blow, and gave up all hope of a first class. In any case  there would have been difficulties. His early training in  scholarship had not been accurate, and he suffered from the blunders  of his education. But under the influence of excitement he had so  far made up for lost time that he got, like Hurrell, a second class  in the final classical schools. His qualified success gave him, no  satisfaction. He was suffering from a bitter sense of disappointment  and wrong. It seemed to him that he was marked out for misfortune,  and that there was no one to help him or to take any trouble about  him. Thrown back upon himself, however, he conquered his  discouragement and resolved that he would be the master of his fate.    It was in the year 1840 that Froude took his degree. Newman was then  at the height of his power and influence. The Tracts for the Times,  which Mrs. Browning in Aurora Leigh calls \"tracts against the  times,\" were popular with undergraduates, and High Churchmen were  making numerous recruits. Newman's sermons are still read for their  style. But we can hardly imagine the effect which they produced when  they were delivered. The preacher's unrivalled command of English,  his exquisitely musical voice, his utter unworldliness, the fervent  evangelical piety which his high Anglican doctrine did not disturb,  were less moving than his singular power, which he seemed to have  derived from Christ Himself, of reading the human heart. The young  men who listened to him felt, each of them, as if he had confessed  his inmost thoughts to Newman, as if Newman were speaking to him  alone. And yet, from his own point of view, there was a danger in  his arguments, a danger which he probably did not see himself,  peculiarly insidious to an acute, subtle, speculative mind like  Froude's.    Newman's intellect, when left to itself, was so clear, so powerful,  so intense, that it cut through sophistry like a knife, and went  straight from premisses to conclusion. But it was only left to  itself within narrow and definite limits. He never suffered from  religious doubts. From Evangelical Protestantism to Roman  Catholicism he passed by slow degrees without once entering the  domain of scepticism. Dissenting altogether from Bishop Butler's  view that reason is the only faculty by which we can judge even of  revelation, he set religion apart, outside reason altogether. From  the pulpit of St. Mary's he told his congregation that Hume's  argument against miracles was logically sound. It was really more  probable that the witnesses should be mistaken than that Lazarus  should have been raised from the dead. But, all the same, Lazarus  was raised from the dead: we were required by faith to believe it,  and logic had nothing to do with the matter. How Butler would have  answered Hume, Butler to whom probability was the guide of life, we  cannot tell. Newman's answer was not satisfactory to Froude. If Hume  were right, how could he also be wrong? Newman might say, with  Tertullian, Credo quia impossibile. But mankind in general are not  convinced by paradox, and \"to be suddenly told that the famous  argument against miracles was logically valid after all was at least  startling.\"*    --  * Short Studies on Great Subjects, 4th series, p. 205.  --    Perplexed by this dilemma, Froude at Oxford as a graduate, taking  pupils in what was then called science, and would now be called  philosophy, for the Honour School of Literae Humaniores. He was soon  offered, and accepted, a tutorship in Ireland. His pupils father,  Mr. Cleaver, was rector of Delgany in the county of Wicklow. Mr.  Cleaver was a dignified, stately clergyman of the Evangelical  school. Froude had been taught by his brother at home, and by his  friends at Oxford, to despise Evangelicals as silly, ignorant,  ridiculous persons. He saw in Mr. Cleaver the perfect type of a  Christian gentleman, cultivated, pious, and well bred. Mrs. Cleaver  was worthy of her husband. They were both models of practical  Christianity. They and their circle held all the opinions about  Catholicism and the Reformation which Newman and the Anglo-Catholics  denounced. The real thing was always among them, and they did not  want any imitation. \"A clergyman,\" says Froude, \"who was afterwards  a Bishop in the Irish Church, declared in my hearing that the theory  of a Christian priesthood was a fiction; that the notion of the  Sacraments as having a mechanical efficacy irrespective of their  conscious effect upon the mind of the receiver was an idolatrous  superstition; that the Church was a human institution, which had  varied in form in different ages, and might vary again; that it was  always fallible; that it might have Bishops in England, and dispense  with Bishops in Scotland and Germany; that a Bishop was merely an  officer; that the apostolical succession was probably false as a  fact--and, if a fact, implied nothing but historical continuity. Yet  the man who said these things had devoted his whole life to his  Master's service--thought of nothing else, and cared for nothing  else.\"*    --  * Short Studies on Great Subjects, 4th series, p. 212.  --    Froude had been taught by his brother, and his brother's set, to  believe that Dissenters were, morally and intellectually, the scum  of the earth. Here were men who, though not Dissenters themselves,  held doctrines practically undistinguishable from theirs, and yet  united the highest mental training with the service of God and the  imitation of Christ. There was in the Cleaver household none of that  reserve which the Tractarians inculcated in matters of religion. The  Christian standard was habitually held up as the guide of life and  conduct, an example to be always followed whatever the immediate  consequences that might ensue. Mr. Cleaver was a man of moderate  fortune, who could be hospitable without pinching, and he was  acquainted with the best Protestant society in Ireland. Public  affairs were discussed in his house with full knowledge, and without  the frivolity affected by public men. O'Connell was at that time  supreme in the government of Ireland, though his reign was drawing  to a close. The Whigs held office by virtue of a compact with the  Irish leader, and their Under-Secretary at Dublin Castle, Thomas  Drummond, had gained the affections of the people by his sympathetic  statesmanship. An epigrammatic speaker said in the House of Commons  that Peel governed England, O'Connell governed Ireland, and the  Whigs governed Downing Street. It was all coming to an end. Drummond  died, the Whigs went out of office, Peel governed Ireland, and  England too. Froude just saw the last phase of O'Connellism, and he  did not like it. In politics he never looked very far below the  surface of things,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14993"],[0,"Rig Veda Americanus (#4)"],[1,"of Huitzilopochtli, who is distinctly  referred to by his title _Yautlatoani_ (see _ante_, p. 18). In the myth,  she dwelt upon the Coatepetl, the Serpent Mountain, on the site of  Tulan. For a full discussion of this myth I refer to my inquiry, \"_Were  the Toltecs an Historic Nationality?_\" in _Proceedings of the Amer.  Phil. Soc._ for Sept. 1887, and _American Hero-Myths_, chap. 11.  (Phila., 1881).    The Gloss distinctly states that the mother of Huitzilopochtli is  referred to in the hymn. We must regard Chimalipan therefore as  identical with _Chimalman_, who, according to another myth dwelt in Tula  as a virgin, and was divinely impregnated by the descending spirit of  the All-father in the shape of a bunch of feathers.    In other myths she is mentioned as also the mother of the Huitznahua,  the enemies and the brothers of Huitzilopochtli, referred to in the  second of this collection of chants.

Torquemada gives as his synonyms _Xiuhtecutli_, \"Lord of Fire,\" and  _Huehueteotl_, \"the Ancient God\" (_Monarquia Indiana_, Lib. VI., cap.  28). Elsewhere he identifies him with the Sun-god (_Ibid._, Lib. XIV.,  cap. 4). Sahagun describes his annual festival (_Hist._, Lib. II., cap.  38), and gives another of his names, _Cuecaltzin_, a reverential form of  _cuezalotl_, flame (_Hist._, Lib. I., cap. 13).    The _tzonmolco_ so often referred to in this hymn was the sixty-fourth  edifice in the great temple of Tenochtitlan, and was devoted to the  worship of Ixcocauhqui (Sahagun). The word literally means \"the place of  spreading hairs,\" the rays or ornaments spreading from the head of the  statue of the god representing flames (Sahagun).    The reference in v. 6 seems to be to one of the women who were  sacrificed at the festival, as related by Sahagun (Lib. II., App.).          VII. _Mimixcoa icuic._        1.

In the ball ground I sang well and strong, like to the quetzal  bird; I answered back to the god.      _Notes._    \"The Chichimecs,\" says Sahagun (_Hist._, Lib. VI., cap. 7), \"worshipped  only one god, called _Mixcoatl_.\" The _Anales de Cuauhtitlan_ speaks of  Mixcoatl as one of the leaders of the ancient Nahuas from their  primitive home Chicomoztoc, the land of the Seven Caves. This is what is  referred to in the above hymn. In later times Mixcoatl became god of  hunting and of the tornado, and his worship extended to the Otomis.    _Tzihuactitlan_, \"the land of the tzihuac bushes,\" I have not found  mentioned by any of the Spanish authorities, but it is named in  connection with Chicomoztoc in an ancient war-song given in my _Ancient  Nahuatl Poetry_, pp. 88 and 140.    The hymn appears to be in memory of the leadership of Mixcoatl in  conducting the ancestors of the Nahua on their long wanderings after  leaving their pristine seats. It should be read in connection with the  earlier pages of the _Annals of Cuauhtitlan_.    The reduplicated form of the name, _Mimixcoatl_, is not found elsewhere,  and appears to be a poetic license.          VIII. _Xochipilli icuic._        1.

The priests go forth to the house of Tlaloc, to the home of the  gods of the plain.      _Notes._    _Xochipilli_, \"lord of flowers,\" otherwise named _Macuilxochitl_, \"five  flowers\" (the name of a small odorous plant), was the deity who gave and  protected all flowering plants. As one of the gods of fertility and  production, he was associated with Tlaloc, god of rains, and Cinteotl,  god of maize. His festival is described in Sahagun (_Historia_, Lib. I.,  cap. 14).      2. _Cipactonalla_, from _cipactli_, and _tonalli_, may refer to  _Cipactonal_, the reputed discoverer of the Aztec calendar. See  _Sahagun_, _Historia_, Lib. IV., cap. I.

Her figure was that of a young woman with gay  garments and jewelry (Duran, _Historia_,"]]]
