Moreover, our aim is to  recount the stages of the wayfarer's journey, not to set forth the  conflicting utterances of the mystics.    Although a brief example hath been given concerning the beginning and  ending of the relative world, the world of attributes, yet a second  illustration is now added, that the full meaning may be manifest. For  instance, let thine Eminence consider his own self; thou art first in  relation to thy son, last in relation to thy father. In thine outward  appearance, thou tellest of the appearance of power in the realms of  divine creation; in thine inward being thou revealest the hidden mysteries  which are the divine trust deposited within thee. And thus firstness and  lastness, outwardness and inwardness are, in the sense referred to, true  of thyself, that in these four states conferred upon thee thou shouldst  comprehend the four divine states, and that the nightingale of thine heart  on all the branches of the rosetree of existence, whether visible or  concealed, should cry out: \"He is the first and the last, the Seen and the  Hidden....\"(48)    These statements are made in the sphere of that which is relative, because  of the limitations of men. Otherwise, those personages who in a single  step have passed over the world of the relative and the limited, and dwelt  on the fair plane of the Absolute, and pitched their tent in the worlds of  authority and command--have burned away these relativities with a single  spark, and blotted out these words with a drop of dew. And they swim in  the sea of the spirit, and soar in the holy air of light. Then what life  have words, on such a plane, that \"first\" and \"last\" or other than these  be seen or mentioned! In this realm, the first is the last itself, and the  last is but the first.      In thy soul of love build thou a fire    And burn all thoughts and words entire.(49)    O my friend, look upon thyself: Hadst thou not become a father nor  begotten a son, neither wouldst thou have heard these sayings. Now forget  them all, that thou mayest learn from the Master of Love in the  schoolhouse of oneness, and return unto God, and forsake the inner land of  unreality(50) for thy true station, and dwell within the shadow of the  tree of knowledge.    O thou dear one! Impoverish thyself, that thou mayest enter the high court  of riches; and humble thy body, that thou mayest drink from the river of  glory, and attain to the full meaning of the poems whereof thou hadst  asked.    Thus it hath been made clear that these stages depend on the vision of the  wayfarer. In every city he will behold a world, in every Valley reach a  spring, in every meadow hear a song. But the falcon of the mystic heaven  hath many a wondrous carol of the spirit in His breast, and the Persian  bird keepeth in His soul many a sweet Arab melody; yet these are hidden,  and hidden shall remain.      If I speak forth, many a mind will shatter,    And if I write, many a pen will break.(51) ,(52)    Peace be upon him who concludeth this exalted journey and followeth the  True One by the lights of guidance.    And the wayfarer, after traversing the high planes of this supernal  journey, entereth          The Valley of Contentment      In this Valley he feeleth the winds of divine contentment blowing from the  plane of the spirit. He burneth away the veils of want, and with inward  and outward eye, perceiveth within and without all things the day of: \"God  will compensate each one out of His abundance.\"(53) From sorrow he turneth  to bliss, from anguish to joy. His grief and mourning yield to delight and  rapture.    Although to outward view, the wayfarers in this Valley may dwell upon the  dust, yet inwardly they are throned in the heights of mystic meaning; they  eat of the endless bounties of inner significances, and drink of the  delicate wines of the spirit.    The tongue faileth in describing these three Valleys, and speech falleth  short. The pen steppeth not into this region, the ink leaveth only a blot.  In these planes, the nightingale of the heart hath other songs and  secrets, which make the heart to stir and the soul to clamor, but this  mystery of inner meaning may be whispered only from heart to heart,  confided only from breast to breast.      Only heart to heart can speak the bliss of mystic knowers;    No messenger can tell it and no missive bear it.(54)      I am silent from weakness on many a matter,    For my words could not reckon them and my speech would fall short.(55)    O friend, till thou enter the garden of such mysteries, thou shalt never  set lip to the undying wine of this Valley. And shouldst thou taste of it,  thou wilt shield thine eyes from all things else, and drink of the wine of  contentment; and thou wilt loose thyself from all things else, and bind  thyself to Him, and throw thy life down in His path, and cast thy soul  away. However, there is no other in this region that thou need forget:  \"There was God and there was naught beside Him.\"(56) For on this plane the  traveler witnesseth the beauty of the Friend in everything. Even in fire,  he seeth the face of the Beloved. He beholdeth in illusion the secret of  reality, and readeth from the attributes the riddle of the Essence. For he  hath burnt away the veils with his sighing, and unwrapped the shroudings  with a single glance; with piercing sight he gazeth on the new creation;  with lucid heart he graspeth subtle verities. This is sufficiently  attested by: \"And we have made thy sight sharp in this day.\"(57)    After journeying through the planes of pure contentment, the traveler  cometh to          The Valley of Wonderment      and is tossed in the oceans of grandeur, and at every moment his wonder  groweth. Now he seeth the shape of wealth as poverty itself, and the  essence of freedom as sheer impotence. Now is he struck dumb with the  beauty of the All-Glorious; again is he wearied out with his own life. How  many a mystic tree hath this whirlwind of wonderment snatched by the  roots, how many a soul hath it exhausted. For in this Valley the traveler  is flung into confusion, albeit, in the eye of him who hath attained, such  marvels are esteemed and well beloved. At every moment he beholdeth a  wondrous world, a new creation, and goeth from astonishment to  astonishment, and is lost in awe at the works of the Lord of Oneness.    Indeed, O Brother, if we ponder each created thing, we shall witness a  myriad perfect wisdoms and learn a myriad new and wondrous truths. One of  the created phenomena is the dream. Behold how many secrets are deposited  therein, how many wisdoms treasured up, how many worlds concealed.  Observe, how thou art asleep in a dwelling, and its doors are barred; on a  sudden thou findest thyself in a far-off city, which thou enterest without  moving thy feet or wearying thy body; without using thine eyes, thou  seest; without taxing thine ears, thou hearest; without a tongue, thou  speakest. And perchance when ten years are gone, thou wilt witness in the  outer world the very things thou hast dreamed tonight.    Now there are many wisdoms to ponder in the dream, which none but the  people of this Valley can comprehend in their true elements. First, what  is this world, where without eye and ear and hand and tongue a man puts  all of these to use? Second, how is it that in the outer world thou seest  today the effect of a dream, when thou didst vision it in the world of  sleep some ten years past? Consider the difference between these two  worlds and the mysteries which they conceal, that thou mayest attain to  divine confirmations and heavenly discoveries and enter the regions of  holiness.    God, the Exalted, hath placed these signs in men, to the end that  philosophers may not deny the mysteries of the life beyond nor belittle  that which hath been promised them. For some hold to reason and deny  whatever the reason comprehendeth not, and yet weak minds can never grasp  the matters which we have related, but only the Supreme, Divine  Intelligence can comprehend them:      How can feeble reason encompass the Qur'an,    Or the spider snare a phoenix in his web?(58)    All these states are to be witnessed in the Valley of Wonderment, and the  traveler at every moment seeketh for more, and is not wearied. Thus the  Lord of the First and the Last in setting forth the grades of  contemplation, and expressing wonderment hath said: \"O Lord, increase my  astonishment at Thee!\"    Likewise, reflect upon the perfection of man's creation, and that all  these planes and states are folded up and hidden away within him.      Dost thou reckon thyself only a puny form    When within thee the universe is folded?(59)    Then we must labor to destroy the animal condition, till the meaning of  humanity shall come to light.    Thus, too, Luqman, who had drunk from the wellspring of wisdom and tasted  of the waters of mercy, in proving to his son Nathan the planes of  resurrection and death, advanced the dream as an evidence and an example.  We relate it here, that through this evanescent Servant a memory may  endure of that youth of the school of Divine Unity, that elder of the art  of instruction and the Absolute. He said: \"O Son, if thou art able not to  sleep, then thou art able not to die. And if thou art able not to waken  after sleep, then thou shalt be able not to rise after death.\"    O friend, the heart is the dwelling of eternal mysteries, make it not the  home of fleeting fancies; waste not the treasure of thy precious life in  employment with this swiftly passing world. Thou comest from the world of  holiness--bind not thine heart to the earth; thou art a dweller in the  court of nearness--choose not the homeland of the dust.    In sum, there is no end to the description of these stages, but because of  the wrongs inflicted by the peoples of the earth, this Servant is in no  mood to continue:   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16996"],[0,"Two Old Faiths (#4)"],[1,"to  speculation had begun to appear. Probably it had all along existed in  the Hindu mind, but had remained latent during the stirring period when  the people were engaged in incessant wars. Climate, also, must have  affected the temperament of the race; and, as the Hindus steadily  pressed down the valley of the Ganges into warmer regions, their love of  repose and contemplative quietism would continually deepen. And when the  Brahmans became a fully developed hierarchy, lavishly endowed, with no  employment except the performance of religious ceremonies, their minds  could avoid stagnation only by having recourse to speculative thought.  Again, asceticism has a deep root in human nature; earnest souls,  conscious of their own weakness, will fly from the temptations of the  world. Various causes thus led numbers of men to seek a life of  seclusion; they dwelt chiefly in forests, and there they revolved the  everlasting problems of existence, creation, the soul, and God. The  lively Greeks, for whom, with all their high intellectual endowments, a  happy sensuous existence was nearly all in all, were amazed at the  numbers in northern India who appeared weary of the world and  indifferent to life itself. By and for these recluses were gradually  composed the Aranyakas, or forest treatises; and out of these grew a  series of more regular works, called Upanishads.[13] At least two  hundred and fifty of these are known to exist. They have been called  \"guesses at truth;\" they are more so than formal solutions of great  questions. Many of them are unintelligible rhapsodies; others rise  almost to sublimity. They frequently contradict each other; the same  writer sometimes contradicts himself. One prevailing characteristic is  all-important; their doctrine is pantheism. The pantheism is sometimes  not so much a coldly reasoned system as an aspiration, a yearning, a  deep-felt need of something better than the mob of gods who came in the  train of Indra, and the darker deities who were still crowding in. Even  in spite of the counteracting power of the Gospel mysticism has run  easily into pantheism in Europe, and orthodox Christians sometimes slide  unconsciously into it, or at least into its language.[14] But, as has  been already noted, a strain of pantheism existed in the Hindu mind from  early times.    Accordingly, these hermit sages, these mystic dreamers, soon came to  identify the human soul with God. And the chief end of man was to seek  that the stream derived from God should return to its source, and,  ceasing to wander through the wilderness of this world, should find  repose in the bosom of the illimitable deep, the One, the All. The  Brahmans attached the Upanishads to the Veda proper, and they soon came  to be regarded as its most sacred part. In this way the influence these  treatises have exercised has been immense; more than any other portion  of the earlier Hindu writings they have molded the thoughts of  succeeding generations. Philosophy had thus begun.    [Sidenote: Six philosophic schools.]  The speculations of which we see the commencement and progress in the  Upanishads were finally developed and classified in a series of writings  called the six Sastras or _darsanas_. These constitute the regular  official philosophy of India. They are without much difficulty reducible  to three leading schools of thought--the Nyaya, the Sankhya, and the  Vedanta.    Roundly, and speaking generally, we may characterize these systems as  theistic, atheistic, and pantheistic respectively.    [Sidenote: The Nyaya.]  It is doubtful, however, whether the earlier form of the Nyaya was  theistic or not. The later form is so, but it says nothing of the moral  attributes of God, nor of his government. The chief end of man,  according to the Nyaya, is deliverance from pain; and this is to be  attained by cessation from all action, whether good or bad.    [Sidenote: The Sankhya.]  The Sankhya declares matter to be self-existent and eternal. Soul is  distinct from matter, and also eternal. When it attains true knowledge  it is liberated from matter and from pain. The Sankhya holds the  existence of God to be without proof.    [Sidenote: The Vedanta.]  But the leading philosophy of India is unquestionably the Vedanta. The  name means \"the end or scope of the Veda;\" and if the Upanishads were  the Veda, instead of treatises tacked on to it, the name would be  correct; for the Vedanta, like the Upanishads, inculcates pantheism.    The form which this philosophy ultimately assumed is well represented in  the treatise called the Vedanta Sara, or essence of the Vedanta. A few  extracts will suffice to exhibit its character. \"The unity of the soul  and God--this is the scope of all Vedanta treatises.\" We have frequent  references made to the \"great saying,\" _Tat twam_--that is, That art  thou, or Thou art God; and _Aham Brahma_, that is, I am God. Again it is  said, \"The whole universe is God.\" God is \"existence (or more exactly an  existent thing[15]), knowledge, and joy.\" Knowledge, not a knower; joy,  not one who rejoices.    [Sidenote: It teaches absolute idealism.]  Every thing else has only a seeming existence, which is in consequence  of ignorance (or illusion). Ignorance makes the soul think itself  different from God; and it also \"projects\" the appearance of an external  world.    \"He who knows God becomes God.\" \"When He, the first and last, is  discerned, one's own acts are annihilated.\"    Meditation, without distinction of subject and object, is the highest  form of thought. It is a high attainment to say, \"I am God;\" but the  consummation is when thought exists without an object.    There are four states of the soul--waking, dreaming, dreamless sleep,  and the \"fourth state,\" or pure intelligence. The working-man is in  dense ignorance; in sleep he is freed from part of this ignorance; in  dreamless sleep he is freed from still more; but the consummation is  when he attains something beyond this, which it seems cannot be  explained, and is therefore called the fourth state.    [Sidenote: Doctrine of \"the Self.\"  Inconsistent statements.]  The name, which in later writings is most frequently given to the \"one  without a second,\"[16] is Atman, which properly means self. Much is said  of the way in which the self in each man is to recover, or discover, its  unity with the supreme or real self. For as the one sun shining in the  heavens is reflected, often in distorted images, in multitudes of  vessels filled with water, so the one self is present in all human  minds.[17] There is not--perhaps there could not be--consistency in the  statements of the relation of the seeming to the real. In most of the  older books a practical or conventional existence is admitted of the  self in each man, but not a real existence. But when the conception is  fully formulated the finite world is not admitted to exist save as a  mere illusion. All phenomena are a play--a play without plot or purpose,  which the absolute plays with itself.[18] This is surely transcendent  transcendentalism. One regrets that speculation did not take one step  more, and declare that the illusion was itself illusory. Then we should  have gone round the circle, and returned to _sensus communis_. We must  be pardoned if we seem to speak disrespectfully of such fantastic  speculations; we desire rather to speak regretfully of the many  generations of men which successively occupied themselves with such  unprofitable dreams; for this kind of thought is traceable even from  Vedic days. It is more fully developed in the Upanishads. In them occurs  the classical sentence so frequently quoted in later literature, which  declares that the absolute being is the \"one [thing] without a  second.\"[19]    [Sidenote: The Gita.]  The book which perhaps above all others has molded the mind of India in  more recent days is the Bhagavad Gita, or Song of the Holy One. It is  written in stately and harmonious verse, and has achieved the same task  for Indian philosophy as Lucretius did for ancient Epicureanism.[20] It  is eclectic, and succeeds, in a sort of way, in forcing the leading  systems of Indian thought into seeming harmony.    [Sidenote: Intellectual pride.]  Some have thought they could discern in these daring speculations  indications of souls groping after God, and saddened because of the  difficulty of finding him. Were it so, all our sympathies would at once  be called forth. But no; we see in these writings far more of  intellectual pride than of spiritual sadness. Those ancient dreamers  never learned their own ignorance. They scarcely recognized the  limitations of the human mind. And when reason could take them no  farther they supplemented it by dreams and ecstasy until, in the Yoga  philosophy, they rushed into systematized mysticisms and magic far more  extravagant than the wildest _theurgy_ of the degraded Neoplatonism of  the Roman Empire.    A learned writer thus expresses himself:         \"The only one of the six schools that seem to recognize the       doctrine of divine providence is the Yoga. It thus seems that the       consistent followers of these systems can have, in their perfected       state, no religion, no action, and no moral character.\"[21]    [Sidenote: Indian philosophy a sad failure.]  And now to take a brief review of the whole subject. The Hindu sages  were men of acute and patient thought; but their attempt to solve the  problem of the divine and human natures, of human destiny and duty, has  ended in total failure. Each system baseless, and all mutually  conflicting; systems cold and cheerless, that frown on love and virtuous  exertion, and speak of annihilation or its equivalent, absorption, as  our highest hope: such is the poor result of infinite speculation. \"The  world by wisdom knew not God.\" O, that India would learn the much-needed  lesson of humility which the experience of ages ought to teach her!
