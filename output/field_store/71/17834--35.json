Whales are diminishing: the Cape  Charles and Hawke Harbour establishments are running, but those at  L'Anse au Loup and Seven islands are not. The whole whaling industry  is disappearing all over the world before the uncontrolled persecution  of the new steam whalers. The walrus is exterminated everywhere in  Labrador except in the north. The seals are diminishing. Every year  the hunters are better supplied with better implements of butchery.  The catch is numbered by the hundreds of thousands, and this only for  one fleet in one place at one season, when the Newfoundlanders come up  the St. Lawrence at the end of the winter. The woodland caribou has  been killed off to such an extent as to cause both Indians and wolves  to die off with him. The barren-ground caribou is still plentiful,  though decreasing. The dying out of so many Indians before the time of  the Low and Eaton expedition of 1893-4 led to an increase of  fur-bearing animals. But renewed, improved, increased and uncontrolled  trapping has now reduced them below their former level. Hunting for  the market seems to be going round in a vicious circle, always  narrowing in on the quarry, which must ultimately be strangled to  death. The white man comes in with better equipment, more systematic  methods and often a \"get-rich-and-get-out\" idea that never entered a  native head. The Indian has to go further afield. The white follows.  Their prey shrinks back in diminishing numbers before them both.  Prices go up. The hunt becomes keener, the animals fewer and farther  off. Presently hunters and hunted will reach the far side of the  utmost limits. And then traded, traders and trade will all disappear  together. And it might so well be otherwise.    There is another point that should never be passed over. In these days  the public conscience is beginning to realize that the objection to  man's cruelty towards his other fellow-beings is something more than a  fad or a fancy. And wanton slaughter is very apt to be accompanied by  shameless cruelty. To kill off parents when the young are helpless....  But I have already given enough sickening details of this. The  treatment of the adults is almost worse in many typical cases. An  Indian will skin a hare alive and gloat over his quivering  death-agonies. The excuse is, \"white man have fun, Indian have fun,  too.\" And it is a valid excuse, from one point of view. When \"there's  nothing in caribou\" except the value of the tongue, the tongue has  been cut out of the living deer, whose only other value is considered  to be the amusement afforded by his horrible fate. And, fiendish  cruelty like this is not confined to the outer wilds. When some  civilized English-speaking bird-catchers get a bird they do not want,  they will deliberately wrench its bill apart, so that it must die of  lingering starvation. Sometimes the cruelty is done to man himself.  Not so many years ago some whalers secured a lot of walrus hides and  tusks by having a whole herd of walrus wiped out, in spite of the fact  that these animals were, at that very time, known to be the only food  available for a neighbouring tribe of Eskimos. The Eskimos were  starved to death, every soul among them, as the Government explorers  found out. But Eskimos have no votes and never write to the papers;  while walrus hides were booming in the markets of civilization.    Things like these are not much spoken of. They very rarely appear in  print. And when they are mentioned at all it is generally with an  apology for introducing unpleasant details. But I am sure I need not  apologize to gentlemen who are anxious to know the full truth of this  great question, who cannot fail to see the connection between wanton  destruction and revolting cruelty, and who must be as ready to rouse  the moral conscience of our people against the cruelty as they are to  rouse its awakening sense of conservation against the destruction.      CONSERVATION    All the sound reasons ever given for conserving other natural  resources apply to the conservation of wild life--and with three-fold  power. When a spend-thrift squanders his capital it is lost to him and  his heirs; yet it goes somewhere else. When a nation allows any one  kind of natural resource to be squandered it must suffer a real,  positive loss; yet substitutes of another kind can generally be found.  But when wild life is squandered it does not go elsewhere, like  squandered money; it cannot possibly be replaced by any substitute, as  some inorganic resources are: it is simply an absolute, dead loss,  gone beyond even the hope of recall.    Now, we have seen verifiable facts enough to prove that Labrador, out  of its total area of eleven Englands, is not likely to be  advantageously exploitable over much more than the area of one England  for other purposes than the growth and harvesting of wild life by land  and water. How are these ten Englands to be brought under  conservation, before it is too late, in the best interests of the five  chief classes of people who are concerned already or will be soon? Of  course, the same individual may belong to more than one class. I  merely use these divisions to make sure of considering all sides of  the question. The five great interests are those of--1. Food. 2.  Business. 3. The Indians and Eskimos. 4. Sport, and 5. The  Zoophilists, by which I mean all people interested in wild-animal  life, from zoologists to tourists.    1. FOOD.--The resident population is so sparse that there is not one  person for every 20,000 acres; and most of these people live on the  coast. Consequently, the vast interior could not be used for food  supplies in any case. Besides, ever since the white man occupied the  coast, the immediate hinterland, which used to be full of life, has  become more and more barren. Fish is plentiful enough. A few small  crops of common vegetables could be grown in many places, and outside  supplies are becoming more available. So the toll of birds and mammals  taken by the present genuine residents for necessary food is not a  menace, if taken in reason. In isolated places in the Gulf, like  Harrington, the Provincial law might safely be relaxed, so as to allow  the eggs of ducks and gulls to be taken up to the 5th of June and  those of murres, auks and puffins up to the 15th. Flight birds might  also be shot at any time on the outside capes and islands. There is a  local unwritten law down there--\"No guns inside, after the 1st of  June\"--and it has been kept for twenty years. Similar relaxations  might be allowed in other places, in genuine cases of necessity. But  the egging and out-of-season slaughter done by people, resident or  not, who are in touch with the outside world, should be stopped  absolutely. And the few walrus now required as food by the few  out-living Eskimos should be strictly protected. Of course, killing  for food under real stress of need at any time or place goes without  saying. The real and spurious cases will soon be discriminated by any  proper system.    2. BUSINESS.--Business is done in fish, whales, seals, fur, game,  plumage and eggs. The fish are a problem apart. But it is worth noting  that uncontrolled exploitation is beginning to affect even their  countless numbers in certain places. Whales have always been exploited  indiscriminately, and their wide range outside of territorial waters  adds to the difficulties of any regulation. But some seasonal and  sanctuary protection is necessary to prevent their becoming extinct.  The \"white porpoise\" could have its young protected; and whaling  stations afford means of inspection and consequent control. The only  chance at present is that when whales become too scarce to pay they  are let alone, and may revive a little. The seals can be protected  locally and ought to be. The preponderance of females and young killed  in the whelping season is a drain impossible for them to withstand  under modern conditions of slaughter. The difficulty of policing large  areas simultaneously might be compensated for by special sanctuaries.  The Americans are protecting their seals by restrictions on the  numbers, ages and sex of those killed; and doing so successfully. The  fur trade is open to the same sort of wise restriction, when  necessary, to the protection of wild fur by the breeding of tame, as  in the fox farms, and to the benefits of sanctuaries. Marketable game,  plumage and eggs can be regulated at out ports and markets. And the  extension of suitable laws to non-game animals, coupled with the  establishment of sanctuaries, would soon improve conditions all round,  especially in the interest of business itself. No one wants his  business to be destroyed. But if Labrador is left without control  indefinitely every business dealing with the products of wild life  will be obliged to play the suicidal game of competitive grab till the  last source of supply is exhausted, and capital, income and employment  all go together.    3. INDIANS AND ESKIMOS.--The Eskimos are few and mostly localized. The  Indians stand to gain by anything that will keep the fur trade in full  vigour, as they are mostly hunters and trappers. Restriction on the  number of skins, if that should prove necessary, and certainly on the  sale of all poisons, could be made operative. Strychnine is said to  kill animals eating the carcases even so far as to the seventh remove.  Close seasons and sanctuaries are difficult to enforce with all  Indians. But the registration of trappers, the enforcement of laws,  the employment of Indians as guides for sportsmen, and other means,  would have a salutary effect. The full-bloods, unfortunately, do not  take kindly to guiding. Indians wishing to change their way of life or  proving persistent lawbreakers might be hived in reserves with their  wives and families. The reserves themselves would cost nothing, the  Indians could find employment as other Indians have, and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1487"],[0,"The Perfect Wagnerite: A Commentary on the Niblung's Ring (#4)"],[1,", willing to buy love and life, not with suicidal curses and  renunciations, but with patient manual drudgery in the service of higher  powers. And these higher powers are called into existence by the same  self-organization of life still more wonderfully into rare persons who  may by comparison be called gods, creatures capable of thought, whose  aims extend far beyond the satisfaction of their bodily appetites  and personal affections, since they perceive that it is only by the  establishment of a social order founded on common bonds of moral faith  that the world can rise from mere savagery. But how is this order to be  set up by Godhead in a world of stupid giants, since these thoughtless  ones pursue only their narrower personal ends and can by no means  understand the aims of a god? Godhead, face to face with Stupidity, must  compromise. Unable to enforce on the world the pure law of thought, it  must resort to a mechanical law of commandments to be enforced by  brute punishments and the destruction of the disobedient. And however  carefully these laws are framed to represent the highest thoughts of the  framers at the moment of their promulgation, before a day has elapsed  that thought has grown and widened by the ceaseless evolution of life;  and lo! yesterday's law already fallen out with today's thought. Yet if  the high givers of that law themselves set the example of breaking  it before it is a week old, they destroy all its authority with their  subjects, and so break the weapon they have forged to rule them for  their own good. They must therefore maintain at all costs the sanctity  of the law, even when it has ceased to represent their thought; so that  at last they get entangled in a network of ordinances which they no  longer believe in, and yet have made so sacred by custom and so terrible  by punishment, that they cannot themselves escape from them. Thus  Godhead's resort to law finally costs it half its integrity--as if  a spiritual king, to gain temporal power, had plucked out one of his  eyes--and it finally begins secretly to long for the advent of some  power higher than itself which will destroy its artificial empire of  law, and establish a true republic of free thought.    This is by no means the only difficulty in the dominion of Law. The  brute force for its execution must be purchased; and the mass of its  subjects must be persuaded to respect the authority which employs this  force. But how is such respect to be implanted in them if they are  unable to comprehend the thought of the lawgiver? Clearly, only by  associating the legislative power with such displays of splendor and  majesty as will impress their senses and awe their imaginations. The god  turned lawgiver, in short, must be crowned Pontiff and King. Since he  cannot be known to the common folk as their superior in wisdom, he must  be known to them as their superior in riches, as the dweller in castles,  the wearer of gold and purple, the eater of mighty feasts, the commander  of armies, and the wielder of powers of life and death, of salvation  and damnation after death. Something may be done in this way without  corruption whilst the golden age still endures. Your gods may not  prevail with the dwarfs; but they may go to these honest giants who will  give a day's work for a day's pay, and induce them to build for Godhead  a mighty fortress, complete with hall and chapel, tower and bell, for  the sake of the homesteads that will grow up in security round that  church-castle. This only, however, whilst the golden age lasts. The  moment the Plutonic power is let loose, and the loveless Alberic comes  into the field with his corrupting millions, the gods are face to face  with destruction; since Alberic, able with invisible hunger-whip to  force the labor of the dwarfs and to buy the services of the giants,  can outshine all the temporal shows and splendors of the golden age,  and make himself master of the world, unless the gods, with their bigger  brains, can capture his gold. This, the dilemma of the Church today,  is the situation created by the exploit of Alberic in the depths of the  Rhine.    Second Scene    From the bed of the river we rise into cloudy regions, and finally come  out into the clear in a meadow, where Wotan, the god of gods, and his  consort Fricka lie sleeping. Wotan, you will observe, has lost one eye;  and you will presently learn that he plucked it out voluntarily as the  price to be paid for his alliance with Fricka, who in return has brought  to him as her dowry all the powers of Law. The meadow is on the brink of  a ravine, beyond which, towering on distant heights, stands Godhome, a  mighty castle, newly built as a house of state for the one-eyed god and  his all-ruling wife. Wotan has not yet seen this castle except in his  dreams: two giants have just built it for him whilst he slept; and the  reality is before him for the first time when Fricka wakes him. In that  majestic burg he is to rule with her and through her over the humble  giants, who have eyes to gape at the glorious castles their own  hands have built from his design, but no brains to design castles for  themselves, or to comprehend divinity. As a god, he is to be great,  secure, and mighty; but he is also to be passionless, affectionless,  wholly impartial; for Godhead, if it is to live with Law, must have no  weaknesses, no respect for persons. All such sweet littlenesses must be  left to the humble stupid giants to make their toil sweet to them; and  the god must, after all, pay for Olympian power the same price the dwarf  has paid for Plutonic power.    Wotan has forgotten this in his dreams of greatness. Not so Fricka. What  she is thinking of is this price that Wotan has consented to pay,  in token whereof he has promised this day to hand over to the giants  Fricka's sister, the goddess Freia, with her golden love-apples. When  Fricka reproaches Wotan with having selfishly forgotten this, she finds  that he, like herself, is not prepared to go through with his bargain,  and that he is trusting to another great worldforce, the Lie (a European  Power, as Lassalle said), to help him to trick the giants out of their  reward. But this force does not dwell in Wotan himself, but in another,  a god over whom he has triumphed, one Loki, the god of Intellect,  Argument, Imagination, Illusion, and Reason. Loki has promised to  deliver him from his contract, and to cheat the giants for him; but he  has not arrived to keep his word: indeed, as Fricka bitterly points  out, why should not the Lie fail Wotan, since such failure is the very  essence of him?    The giants come soon enough; and Freia flies to Wotan for protection  against them. Their purposes are quite honest; and they have no doubt  of the god's faith. There stands their part of the contract fulfilled,  stone on stone, port and pinnacle all faithfully finished from Wotan's  design by their mighty labor. They have come undoubtingly for their  agreed wage. Then there happens what is to them an incredible,  inconceivable thing. The god begins to shuffle. There are no moments in  life more tragic than those in which the humble common man, the manual  worker, leaving with implicit trust all high affairs to his betters, and  reverencing them wholly as worthy of that trust, even to the extent  of accepting as his rightful function the saving of them from all  roughening and coarsening drudgeries, first discovers that they are  corrupt, greedy, unjust and treacherous. The shock drives a ray of  prophetic light into one giant's mind, and gives him a momentary  eloquence. In that moment he rises above his stupid gianthood, and  earnestly warns the Son of Light that all his power and eminence of  priesthood, godhood, and kingship must stand or fall with the unbearable  cold greatness of the incorruptible law-giver. But Wotan, whose assumed  character of law-giver is altogether false to his real passionate  nature, despises the rebuke; and the giant's ray of insight is lost in  the murk of his virtuous indignation.    In the midst of the wrangle, Loki comes at last, excusing himself  for being late on the ground that he has been detained by a matter of  importance which he has promised to lay before Wotan. When pressed to  give his mind to the business immediately in hand, and to extricate  Wotan from his dilemma, he has nothing to say except that the giants are  evidently altogether in the right. The castle has been duly built: he  has tried every stone of it, and found the work first-rate: there is  nothing to be done but pay the price agreed upon by handing over Freia  to the giants. The gods are furious; and Wotan passionately declares  that he only consented to the bargain on Loki's promise to find a way  for him out of it. But Loki says no: he has promised to find a way out  if any such way exist, but not to make a way if there is no way. He has  wandered over the whole earth in search of some treasure great enough  to buy Freia back from the giants; but in all the world he has found  nothing for which Man will give up Woman. And this, by the way, reminds  him of the matter he had promised to lay before Wotan. The Rhine maidens  have complained to him of Alberic's theft of their gold; and he mentions  it as a curious exception to his universal law of the unpurchasable  preciousness of love, that this gold-robber has forsworn love for the  sake of the fabulous riches of the Plutonic empire and the mastery of  the world through its power.    No sooner is the tale told than the giants stoop lower than the dwarf.  Alberic forswore love only when it was denied to him and made the  instrument for cruelly murdering his self-respect. But the giants,  with love within their reach, with Freia and her golden apples in their  hands, offer to give her up for the treasure of Alberic. Observe, it  is the treasure alone that they desire. They have no fierce dreams  of dominion over their"]]]
