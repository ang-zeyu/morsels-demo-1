[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17404"],[0,"Kinship Organisations and Group Marriage in Australia (#4)"],[1,"in which the marriage regulations, as with the Urabunna, so split the  intermarrying fractions, that the tribe is, as it were, divided into  water-tight compartments; how far kinship terms are applied under these  circumstances our information does not say.    The tribe is defined by American anthropologists as a union of hordes or  clans for common defence under a chief. The American tribe differs in  two respects, at least, from the Australian tribe; in the first place,  marriage outside the tribe is exceptional in America and common in  Australia; in the second place, the stranger gains entrance to the  American tribe only by adoption; and we may probably add, thirdly, that  the American tribe does not invariably lay claim to landed property or  hunting rights.    The tribe is subdivided in various ways. In addition to the various  forms of natal and other associations, there is, at any rate in  Australia, a local organisation; the local group is often the owner of a  portion of the tribal area. This local group again falls into a number  of families (in the European sense), and the land is parcelled out among  them in some cases, in others it may be the property of individuals. But  there is a great lack of clearness with regard to the bodies or persons  in whom landed property is vested. The composition of the local group  varies according to the customs of residence after marriage, and the  rules by which membership of the kinship organisation is determined.  These two forces acting together may produce two types of local group:  (1) the mixed group, in which persons of various kinship organisations  are scattered at random; (2) the kin group, in which either all the  males or all the females together with the children are members of one  kinship organisation.    Save in the rare instances of non-exogamous kinship groups, the family  necessarily contains one member, at least, whose kin is not the same as  that of the remainder; this is either the husband or the wife, according  as descent is reckoned in the female or the male line; where polygyny is  practised, this unity may go no further than the phratry or the class,  each wife being of a different totem kin.    Although it frequently happens that the children belong to the kin which  through one of the parents or otherwise exercises the supreme authority  in the family, it is far from being the case that there is invariable  agreement between the principles on which kinship and authority are  determined. Three main types of family may be distinguished: (1)  patripotestal, (2) matripotestal, (_a_) direct, and (_b_) indirect, in  which the authority is wielded by the father, mother, and mother's  relatives, in particular her brothers, respectively. Innumerable  transitional forms are found, some of which will be mentioned in the  next chapter, which deals with the rule of descent by which membership  of natal groups is determined.    Turning now to kinship organisations, we find that the most widely  distributed type is the totem kin, in fact, if we except the Hottentots  and a few other peoples among whom no trace of it is found, it is  difficult to say where totemism has not at one time or another  prevailed. It is found as a living cult to-day among the greater part of  the aborigines of North and South America, in Australia, and among some  of the Bantu populations of the southern half of Africa. In more or less  recognisable forms it is found in other parts of Africa, New Guinea,  India, and other parts of the world. In the ancient world its existence  has been maintained for Rome (clan Valeria etc.), Greece, and Egypt, but  the absence of information as to details of the social structure renders  these theories uncertain.    Aberrant cases apart, totemism is understood to involve (1) the  existence of a body of persons claiming kinship, who (2) stand in a  certain relation to some object, usually an animal, and (3) do not marry  within the kin.    Passing over the classes, which are peculiar to Australia and will be  fully dealt with below, we come to a more comprehensive form of kinship  organisation in the phratries. These are a grouping of the community in  two or more exogamous divisions, between which the totem kins, where  they exist, are distributed. The essential feature of a phratry is that  it is exogamous; its members cannot ordinarily marry within it, and,  where there are more than two phratries, there may exist rules limiting  their choice to certain phratries.[4]    This dual or other grouping of the kins is widely found in North  America, the number of phratries ranging from two among the Tlinkits,  Cayugas, Choctaws, and others, to ten among the Moquis of Arizona. As in  Australia, the totem kins bearing the same eponymous animal as the  phratry are usually, e.g. among the Tlinkits, found in the phratry in  question. Exceptions to this rule are found among the Haida, where both  eagle and raven are in the eagle phratry.    The Mohegan and Kutchin phratries call for special notice. The kins of  the former are arranged in three groups: wolf, turtle, and turkey; and  the first phratry includes quadrupeds, the second turtles of various  kinds and the yellow eel, and the third birds. We find a parallel to  these phratries in the groups of the Kutchin, but in the latter case  our lack of knowledge of the tribe precludes us from saying whether  totem kins exist among them, and, if so, how far the grouping is  systematic; the Kutchin groups, according to one authority, are known by  the generic names of birds, beasts, and fish. As a rule, however, no  classification of kins is found, nor are the phratry names specially  significant.    Dual grouping of the kins is also found in New Guinea, the Torres  Straits Islands, and possibly among the ancient Arabs[5]; but evidence  in the latter case has not been systematically dealt with.    Other peoples have a similar dichotomous organisation; but it is either  not based on the totem kins or they have fallen into the background.    In various parts of Melanesia we find the people divided into two  groups, each associated with a single totem or mythological personage,  and sexual intercourse, whether marital or otherwise, is strictly  forbidden between those of the same phratry[6]. In India the Todas have  a similar organisation[7], and the Wanika in East Africa[8].    Customs of residence and descent affect the distribution of the  phratries within the tribe, no less than the composition of the local  group. With patrilineal descent they tend to occupy the tribal territory  in such a way that each phratry becomes a local group. With the  disappearance of phratry names this would be transformed into a local  exogamous group, which is, however, indistinguishable from the local  group of the same nature which is the result of the development of a  totem kin under similar conditions.    As a rule kinship organisations descend in a given tribe either in the  male line or in the female. Among the Ova-Herero, however, and other  Bantu tribes, there are two kinds of organisation, one--the  _eanda_--descending in female line and regulative of marriage, is  clearly the totem kin; property remains in the _eanda_, and  consequently descends to the sister's son. The other--the  _oruzo_--descends in the male line; it is concerned with chieftainship  and priesthood, which remain in the same _oruzo_, and the heir is the  brother's son.[9]    This dual rule of descent brings us face to face with the question of  how membership of kinship groups is determined.

[3]  Two kinds of kinship are recognised in Australian tribes--(_a_)  totem and (_b_) phratry or class--but the precise relationship of one to  the other is far from clear. Nor is there much information as to what  terms of kinship are used within the totem kin. It is certain that  neither set of terms includes the other, for the totem kin extends  beyond the tribe or may do so, and there is more than one in each  phratry.

Descent of kinship, origin and primitive form. Matriliny in Australia.       Relation to potestas, position of widow, etc. Change of rule of       descent; relation to potestas, inheritance and local organisation.      In discussions of the origin and evolution of kinship organisations, we  are necessarily concerned not only with their forms but also with the  rules of descent which regulate membership of them. Until recently the  main questions at issue were twofold: (1) the priority or otherwise of  female descent; (2) the causes of the transition from one form of  descent to another. Of late the question has been raised whether in the  beginning hereditary kinship groups existed at all, or whether  membership was not rather determined by considerations of an entirely  different order. Dr Frazer, who has enunciated this view, maintains that  totemism rests on a primitive theory of conception, due to savage  ignorance of the facts of procreation.[10] But his theory is based  exclusively on the foundation of the beliefs of the Central Australians  and seems to neglect more than one important point which goes to show  that the Arunta have evolved their totemic system from the more ordinary  hereditary form. Whether this be so or not, it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17408"],[0,"The Florentine Painters of the Renaissance (#4)"],[1,"together proclaim. It is true that  Giotto's profound feeling for either the materially or the spiritually  significant was denied him--and there is no possible compensation for  the difference; but although his sense for the real was weaker, it yet  extended to fields which Giotto had not touched. Like all the supreme  artists, Giotto had no inclination to concern himself with his attitude  toward the significant, with his feelings about it; the grasping and  presentation of it sufficed him. In the weaker personality, the  significant, vaguely perceived, is converted into emotion, is merely  felt, and not realised. Over this realm of feeling Fra Angelico was the  first great master. \"God's in his heaven--all's right with the world\" he  felt with an intensity which prevented him from perceiving evil  anywhere. When he was obliged to portray it, his imagination failed him  and he became a mere child; his hells are bogy-land; his martyrdoms are  enacted by children solemnly playing at martyr and executioner; and he  nearly spoils one of the most impressive scenes ever painted--the great  \"Crucifixion\" at San Marco--with the childish violence of St. Jerome's  tears. But upon the picturing of blitheness, of ecstatic confidence in  God's loving care, he lavished all the resources of his art. Nor were  they small. To a power of rendering tactile values, to a sense for the  significant in composition, inferior, it is true, to Giotto's, but  superior to the qualifications of any intervening painter, Fra Angelico  added the charm of great facial beauty, the interest of vivid  expression, the attraction of delicate colour. What in the whole world  of art more rejuvenating than Angelico's \"Coronation\" (in the  Uffizi)--the happiness on all the faces, the flower-like grace of line  and colour, the childlike simplicity yet unqualifiable beauty of the  composition? And all this in tactile values which compel us to grant the  reality of the scene, although in a world where real people are  standing, sitting, and kneeling we know not, and care not, on what. It  is true, the significance of the event represented is scarcely touched  upon, but then how well Angelico communicates the feeling with which it  inspired him! Yet simple though he was as a person, simple and  one-sided as was his message, as a product he was singularly complex. He  was the typical painter of the transition from Mediaeval to Renaissance.  The sources of his feeling are in the Middle Ages, but he _enjoys_ his  feelings in a way which is almost modern; and almost modern also are his  means of expression. We are too apt to forget this transitional  character of his, and, ranking him with the moderns, we count against  him every awkwardness of action, and every lack of articulation in his  figures. Yet both in action and in articulation he made great progress  upon his precursors--so great that, but for Masaccio, who completely  surpassed him, we should value him as an innovator. Moreover, he was not  only the first Italian to paint a landscape that can be identified (a  view of Lake Trasimene from Cortona), but the first to communicate a  sense of the pleasantness of nature. How readily we feel the freshness  and spring-time gaiety of his gardens in the frescoes of the  \"Annunciation\" and the \"Noli me tangere\" at San Marco!      IV.    [Page heading: MASACCIO]    Giotto born again, starting where death had cut short his advance,  instantly making his own all that had been gained during his absence,  and profiting by the new conditions, the new demands--imagine such an  avatar, and you will understand Masaccio.    Giotto we know already, but what were the new conditions, the new  demands? The mediaeval skies had been torn asunder and a new heaven and a  new earth had appeared, which the abler spirits were already inhabiting  and enjoying. Here new interests and new values prevailed. The thing of  sovereign price was the power to subdue and to create; of sovereign  interest all that helped man to know the world he was living in and his  power over it. To the artist the change offered a field of the freest  activity. It is always his business to reveal to an age its ideals. But  what room was there for sculpture and painting,--arts whose first  purpose it is to make us realise the material significance of things--in  a period like the Middle Ages, when the human body was denied all  intrinsic significance? In such an age the figure artist can thrive, as  Giotto did, only in spite of it, and as an isolated phenomenon. In the  Renaissance, on the contrary, the figure artist had a demand made on him  such as had not been made since the great Greek days, to reveal to a  generation believing in man's power to subdue and to possess the world,  the physical types best fitted for the task. And as this demand was  imperative and constant, not one, but a hundred Italian artists arose,  able each in his own way to meet it,--in their combined achievement,  rivalling the art of the Greeks.    In sculpture Donatello had already given body to the new ideals when  Masaccio began his brief career, and in the education, the awakening, of  the younger artist the example of the elder must have been of  incalculable force. But a type gains vastly in significance by being  presented in some action along with other individuals of the same type;  and here Donatello was apt, rather than to draw his meed of profit, to  incur loss by descending to the obvious--witness his _bas-reliefs_ at  Siena, Florence, and Padua. Masaccio was untouched by this taint.  Types, in themselves of the manliest, he presents with a sense for the  materially significant which makes us realise to the utmost their power  and dignity; and the spiritual significance thus gained he uses to give  the highest import to the event he is portraying; this import, in turn,  gives a higher value to the types, and thus, whether we devote our  attention to his types or to his action, Masaccio keeps us on a high  plane of reality and significance. In later painting we shall easily  find greater science, greater craft, and greater perfection of detail,  but greater reality, greater significance, I venture to say, never.  Dust-bitten and ruined though his Brancacci Chapel frescoes now are, I  never see them without the strongest stimulation of my tactile  consciousness. I feel that I could touch every figure, that it would  yield a definite resistance to my touch, that I should have to expend  thus much effort to displace it, that I could walk around it. In short,  I scarcely could realise it more, and in real life I should scarcely  realise it so well, the attention of each of us being too apt to  concentrate itself upon some dynamic quality, before we have at all  begun to realise the full material significance of the person before us.  Then what strength to his young men, and what gravity and power to his  old! How quickly a race like this would possess itself of the earth, and  brook no rivals but the forces of nature! Whatever they do--simply  because it is they--is impressive and important, and every movement,  every gesture, is world-changing. Compared with his figures, those in  the same chapel by his precursor, Masolino, are childish, and those by  his follower, Filippino, unconvincing and without significance, because  without tactile values. Even Michelangelo, where he comes in rivalry,  has, for both reality and significance, to take a second place. Compare  his \"Expulsion from Paradise\" (in the Sixtine Chapel) with the one here  by Masaccio. Michelangelo's figures are more correct, but far less  tangible and less powerful; and while he represents nothing but a man  warding off a blow dealt from a sword, and a woman cringing with ignoble  fear, Masaccio's Adam and Eve stride away from Eden heart-broken with  shame and grief, hearing, perhaps, but not seeing, the angel hovering  high overhead who directs their exiled footsteps.    Masaccio, then, like Giotto a century earlier,--himself the Giotto of an  artistically more propitious world--was, as an artist, a great master of  the significant, and, as a painter, endowed to the highest degree with a  sense of tactile values, and with a skill in rendering them. In a career  of but few years he gave to Florentine painting the direction it pursued  to the end. In many ways he reminds us of the young Bellini. Who knows?  Had he but lived as long, he might have laid the foundation for a  painting not less delightful and far more profound than that of Venice.  As it was, his frescoes at once became, and for as long as there were  real artists among them remained, the training-school of Florentine  painters.      V.    Masaccio's death left Florentine painting in the hands of three men  older, and two somewhat younger than himself, all men of great talent,  if not of genius, each of whom--the former to the extent habits already  formed would permit, the latter overwhelmingly, felt his influence. The  older, who, but for Masaccio, would themselves have been the sole  determining personalities in their art, were Fra Angelico, Paolo  Uccello, and Andrea del Castagno; the younger, Domenico Veneziano and  Fra Filippo. As these were the men who for a whole generation after  Masaccio's death remained at the head of their craft, forming the taste  of the public, and communicating their habits and aspirations to their  pupils, we at this point can scarcely do better than try to get some  notion of each of them and of the general art tendencies they  represented.    [Page heading: PAOLO UCCELLO]    Fra Angelico we know already as the painter who devoted his life to  picturing the departing mediaeval vision of a heaven upon earth. Nothing  could have been farther from the purpose of Uccello and Castagno.  Different as these two were from each other, they have this much in  common, that in their works which remain to us, dating, it is true, from  their years of maturity, there is"]]]
