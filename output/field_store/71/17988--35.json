He didn't know why. He  had always counted on Letty when the time should come to speak the  word. He had shown his heart in everything but words; what more did a  girl want? Of course, if any one preferred a purely fantastic duty to  a man's love, and allowed a scapegrace brother to foist two red-faced,  squalling babies on her, there was nothing to be said. So, in this  frame of mind he had had one flaming, passionate, wrong-headed scene  with his father, and strode out of Beulah with dramatic gestures of  shaking its dust off his feet. His father, roused for once from his  lifelong patience, had been rather terrible in that last scene; so  terrible that he had never forgiven himself, or really believed  himself fully forgiven by God, though his son had alienated half the  village and nearly rent the parish in twain by his conduct.    As for Letty, she held her peace. She could only hope that the  minister and his wife suspected nothing, and she was sure of Beulah's  point of view. That a girl would never give up a suitor, if she had  any hope of tying him to her for life, was a popular form of belief in  the community; and strangely enough it was chiefly the women, not the  men, who made it current. Now and then a soft-hearted and chivalrous  male would observe indulgently of some village beauty, \"I shouldn't  wonder a mite if she could 'a' had Bill for the askin'\"; but this  opinion would be met by such a chorus of feminine incredulity that its  author generally withdrew it as unsound and untenable.    It was then, when Dick had gone away, that the days had grown drab and  long, but the twins kept Letty's inexperienced hands busy, though in  the first year she had the help of old Miss Clarissa Perry, a  childless expert in the bringing-up of babies.    The friendship of Reba Larrabee, so bright and cheery and  comprehending, was a never-ending solace. There was nothing of the  martyr about Letty. She was not wholly resigned to her lot, and to  tell the truth she did not intend to be, for a good many years yet.    \"I'm not a minister, but I'm the wife of a minister, which is the next  best thing,\" Mrs. Larrabee used to say. \"I tell you, Letty, there's no  use in human creatures being resigned till their bodies are fairly  worn out with fighting. When you can't think of another mortal thing  to do, be resigned; but I'm convinced that the Lord is ashamed of us  when we fold our hands too soon!\"    \"You were born courageous, Reba!\" And Letty would look admiringly at  the rosy cheeks and bright eyes of her friend.    \"My blood circulates freely; that helps me a lot. Everybody's blood  circulates in Racine, Wisconsin.\"--And the minister's wife laughed  genially. \"Yours, hereabouts, freezes up in your six months of cold  weather, and when it begins to thaw out the snow is ready to fall  again. That sort of thing induces depression, although no mere climate  would account for Mrs. Popham.--Ossian said to Luther the other day:  'Maria ain't hardly to blame, parson. She come from a gloomy stock.  The Ladds was all gloomy, root and branch. They say that the Ladd  babies was always discouraged two days after they was born.'\"    The cause of Letty's chief heartache, the one that she could reveal to  nobody, was that her brother should leave her nowadays so completely  to her own resources. She recalled the time when he came home from  Boston, pale, haggard, ashamed, and told her of his marriage, months  before. She could read in his lack-lustre eyes, and hear in his  voice, the absence of love, the fear of the future. That was bad  enough, but presently he said: \"Letty, there's more to tell. I've no  money, and no place to put my wife, but there's a child coming. Can I  bring her here till--afterwards? You won't like her, but she's so  ailing and despondent just now that I think she'll behave herself, and  I'll take her away as soon as she's able to travel. She would never  stay here in the country, anyway; you couldn't hire her to do it.\"    She came: black-haired, sullen-faced Eva, with a vulgar beauty of her  own, much damaged by bad temper, discontent, and illness. Oh, those  terrible weeks for Letty, hiding her own misery, putting on a brave  face with the neighbors, keeping the unwelcome sister-in-law in the  background.    It was bitterly cold, and Eva raged against the climate, the house,  the lack of a servant, the absence of gayety, and above all at the  prospect of motherhood. Her resentment against David, for some reason  unknown to Letty, was deep and profound and she made no secret of it;  until the outraged Letty, goaded into speech one day, said: \"Listen,  Eva! David brought you here because his sister's house was the proper  place for you just now. I don't know why you married each other, but  you did, and it's evidently a failure. I'm going to stand by David and  see you through this trouble, but while you're under my roof you'll  have to speak respectfully of my brother; not so much because he's my  brother, but because he's your husband and the father of the child  that's coming:--do you understand?\"    Letty had a good deal of red in her bronze hair and her brown eyes  were as capable of flashing fire as Eva's black ones; so the girl not  only refrained from venting her spleen upon the absent David, but  ceased to talk altogether, and the gloom in the house was as black as  if Mrs. Popham and all her despondent ancestors were living under its  roof.    The good doctor called often and did his best, shrugging his shoulders  and lifting his eyebrows as he said: \"Let her work out her own  salvation. I doubt if she can, but we'll give her the chance. If the  problem can be solved, the child will do it.\"          [Illustration]    IV      Well, the problem never was solved, never in this world, at least; and  those who were in the sitting-room chamber when Eva was shown her two  babies lying side by side on a pillow, never forgot the quick glance  of horrified incredulity, or the shriek of aversion with which she  greeted them.    Letty had a sense of humor, and it must be confessed that when the  scorned and discarded babies were returned to her, and she sat by the  kitchen stove trying to plan a second bottle, a second cradle, and see  how far the expected baby could divide its modest outfit with the  unexpected one, she burst into a fit of hysterical laughter mingled  with an outpour of tears.    The doctor came in from the sick-room puzzled and crestfallen from his  interview with an entirely new specimen of woman-kind. He had brought  Letty and David into the world and soothed the last days of all her  family, and now in this tragedy--for tragedy it was--he was her only  confidant and adviser.    Letty looked at him, the tears streaming from her eyes.    \"Oh, Doctor Lee, Doctor Lee! If an overruling Providence could smile,  wouldn't He smile now? David and Eva never wanted to marry each other,  I'm sure of it, and the last thing they desired was a child. Now  there are two of them. Their father is away, their mother won't look  at them! What will become of me until Eva gets well and behaves like a  human being? I never promised to be an aunt to twins; I never did like  twins; I think they're downright vulgar!\"        \"Waly waly! bairns are bonny:      One's enough and twa's ower mony,\"    quoted the doctor. \"It's worse even than you think, my poor Letty, for  the girl can't get well, because she won't! She has gritted her teeth,  turned her face to the wall, and refused her food. It's the beginning  of the end. You are far likelier to be a foster mother than an aunt!\"    Letty's face changed and softened and her color rose. She leaned over  the two pink, crumpled creatures, still twitching nervously with the  amazement and discomfort of being alive.    [Illustration: \"COME TO YOUR AUNT LETTY THEN AND BE MOTHERED!\" SHE  SOBBED]    \"Come to your Aunt Letty then and be mothered!\" she sobbed, lifting  the pillow and taking it, with its double burden, into her arms. \"You  shan't suffer, poor innocent darlings, even if those who brought you  into the world turn away from you! Come to your Aunt Letty and be  mothered!\"    \"That's right, that's right,\" said the doctor over a lump in his  throat. \"We mustn't let the babies pay the penalty of their parents'  sins; and there's one thing that may soften your anger a little,  Letty: Eva's not right; she's not quite responsible. There are cases  where motherhood, that should be a joy, brings nothing but mental  torture and perversion of instinct. Try and remember that, if it helps  you any. I'll drop in every two or three hours and I'll write David  to come at once. He must take his share of the burden.\"    Well, David came, but Eva was in her coffin. He was grave and silent,  and it could not be said that he showed a trace of fatherly pride. He  was very young, it is true, thoroughly ashamed of himself, very  unhappy, and anxious about his new cares; but Letty could not help  thinking that he regarded the twins as a sort of personal  insult,--perhaps not on their own part, nor on Eva's, but as an  accident that might have been prevented by a competent Providence. At  any rate, he carried himself as a man with a grievance, and when he  looked at his offspring, which was seldom, it seemed to Letty that he  regarded the second one as an unnecessary intruder and cherished a  secret resentment at its audacity in coming to this planet uninvited.  He went back to his work in Boston without its having crossed his mind  that anybody but his sister could take care of his children. He didn't  really regard them as children or human beings; it takes a woman's  vision to make that sort of leap into the future.

A trio of Corelli's is gone through; then Madame Cuzzoni sings  Handel's last new air; Dr. Pepusch takes his turn at the harpsichord;  another trio of Hasse, or a solo on the violin by Bannister; a selection  on the organ from Mr. Handel's new oratorio; and then the day's  programme is over.    Dukes, duchesses, wits and philosophers, poets and musicians, make their  way down the satirized stairs to go, some in carriages, some in chairs,  some on foot, to their own palaces, houses, or lodgings.      III.    We do not now think of Handel in connection with the opera. To the  modern mind he is so linked to the oratorio, of which he was the father  and the consummate master, that his operas are curiosities but little  known except to musical antiquaries. Yet some of the airs from the  Handel operas are still cherished by singers as among the most beautiful  songs known to the concert-stage.    In 1720 Handel was engaged by a party of noblemen, headed by his Grace  of Chandos, to compose operas for the Royal Academy of Music at the  Haymarket. An attempt had been made to put this institution on a firm  foundation by a subscription of L50,000, and it was opened on May 2d  with a full company of singers engaged by Handel. In the course of eight  years twelve operas were produced in rapid succession: \"Floridante,\"  December 9, 1721; \"Ottone,\" January 12, 1723; \"Flavio\" and \"Giulio  Cesare,\" 1723; \"Tamerlano,\" 1724; \"Rodelinda,\" 1725; \"Scipione,\" 1726;  \"Alessandro,\" 1726; \"Admeto,\" 727; \"Siroe,\" 1728; and \"Tolommeo,\" 1728.  They made as great a _furore_ among the musical public of that day as  would an opera from Gounod or Verdi in the present. The principal airs  were sung throughout the land, and published as harpsichord pieces; for  in these halcyon days of our composers the whole atmosphere of the land  was full of the flavor and color of Handel. Many of the melodies in  these now forgotten operas have been worked up by modern composers, and  so have passed into modern music unrecognized. It is a notorious fact  that the celebrated song, \"Where the Bee sucks,\" by Dr. Arne, is taken  from a movement in \"Rinaldo.\" Thus the new life of music is ever growing  rich with the dead leaves of the past. The most celebrated of these  operas was entitled \"Otto.\" It was a work composed of one long string of  exquisite gems, like Mozart's \"Don Giovanni\" and Gounod's \"Faust.\" Dr.  Pepusch, who had never quite forgiven Handel for superseding him as the  best organist in England, remarked, of one of the airs, \"That great bear  must have been inspired when he wrote that air.\" The celebrated Madame  Cuzzoni made her _debut_ in it. On the second night the tickets rose  to four guineas each, and Cuzzoni received two thousand pounds for the  season.    The composer had already begun to be known for his irascible temper.  It is refreshing to learn that operatic singers of the day, however  whimsical and self-willed, were obliged to bend to the imperious genius  of this man. In a spirit of ill-timed revolt Cuzzoni declined to sing  an air. She had already given him trouble by her insolence and freaks,  which at times were unbearable. Handel at last exploded. He flew at the  wretched woman and shook her like a rat. \"Ah! I always knew you were  a fery tevil,\" he cried, \"and I shall now let you know that I am  Beelzebub, the prince of de tevils!\" and, dragging her to the open  window, was just on the point of pitching her into the street when,  in every sense of the word, she recanted. So, when Carestini, the  celebrated tenor, sent back an air, Handel was furious. Rushing into the  trembling Italian's house, he said, in his four- or five-language style:  \"You tog! don't I know better as yourself vaat it pest for you to sing?  If you vill not sing all de song vaat I give you, I vill not pay you ein  stiver.\" Among the anecdotes told of Handel's passion is one growing out  of the composer's peculiar sensitiveness to discords. The dissonance  of the tuning-up period of an orchestra is disagreeable to the most  patient. Handel, being peculiarly sensitive to this unfortunate  necessity, always arranged that it should take place before the  audience assembled, so as to prevent any sound of scraping or blowing.  Unfortunately, on one occasion, some wag got access to the orchestra  where the ready-tuned instruments were lying, and with diabolical  dexterity put every string and crook out of tune. Handel enters. All  the bows are raised together, and at the given beat all start off _con  spirito_. The effect was startling in the extreme. The unhappy _maestro_  rushes madly from his place, kicks to pieces the first double-bass he  sees, and, seizing a kettle-drum, throws it violently at the leader of  the band. The effort sends his wig flying, and, rushing bareheaded to  the footlights, he stands a few moments amid the roars of the house,  snorting with rage and choking with passion. Like Burleigh's nod,  Handel's wig seemed to have been a sure guide to his temper. When things  went well, it had a certain complacent vibration; but when he was out of  humor, the wig indicated the fact in a very positive way. The Princess  of Wales was wont to blame her ladies for talking instead of listening.  \"Hush, hush!\" she would say. \"Don't you see Handel's wig?\"    For several years after the subscription of the nobility had been  exhausted, our composer, having invested L10,000 of his own in the  Haymarket, produced operas with remarkable affluence, some of them  _pasticcio_ works, composed of all sorts of airs, in which the  singers could give their _bravura songs_. These were \"Lotario,\"  1729; \"Partenope,\" 1730; \"Poro,\" 1731; \"Ezio,\" 1732; \"Sosarme,\" 1732;  \"Orlando,\" 1733; \"Ariadne,\" 1734; and also several minor works. Handel's  operatic career was not so much the outcome of his choice as dictated  to him by the necessity of time and circumstance. As time went on, his  operas lost public interest. The audiences dwindled, and the overflowing  houses of his earlier experience were replaced by empty benches. This,  however, made little difference with Handel's royal patrons. The king  and the Prince of Wales, with their respective households, made it  an express point to show their deep interest in Handel's success.  In illustration of this, an amusing anecdote is told of the Earl of  Chesterfield. During the performance of \"Rinaldo\" this nobleman, then  an equerry of the king, was met quietly retiring from the theatre in the  middle of the first act. Surprise being expressed by a gentleman who  met the earl, the latter said: \"I don't wish to disturb his Majesty's  privacy.\"    Handel paid his singers in those days what were regarded as enormous  prices. Senisino and Carestini had each twelve hundred pounds, and  Cuzzoni two thousand, for the season. Toward the end of what may be  called the Handel season nearly all the singers and nobles forsook him,  and supported Farinelli, the greatest singer living, at the rival house  in Lincoln's Inn Fields.      IV.    From the year 1729 the career of Handel was to be a protracted battle,  in which he was sometimes victorious, sometimes defeated, but always  undaunted and animated with a lofty sense of his own superior power.  Let us take a view of some of the rival musicians with whom he came  in contact. Of all these Bononcini was the most formidable. He came to  England in 1720 with Ariosti, also a meritorious composer. Factions  soon began to form themselves around Handel and Bononcini, and a bitter  struggle ensued between these old foes. The same drama repeated itself,  with new actors, about thirty years afterward, in Paris. Gluck was then  the German hero, supported by Marie Antoinette, and Piccini fought for  the Italian opera under the colors of the king's mistress Du Barry,  while all the _litterateurs_ and nobles ranged themselves on either  side in bitter contest. The battle between Handel and Bononcini, as the  exponents of German and Italian music, was also repeated in after-years  between Mozart and Salieri, Weber and Rossini, and to-day is seen in  the acrimonious disputes going on between Wagner and the Italian school.  Bononcini's career in England came to an end very suddenly. It was  discovered that a madrigal brought out by him was pirated from another  Italian composer; whereupon Bononcini left England, humiliated to the  dust, and finally died obscure and alone, the victim of a charlatan  alchemist, who succeeded in obtaining all his savings.    Another powerful rival of Handel was Porpora, or, as Handel used to  call him, \"old Borbora.\" Without Bononcini's fire or Handel's daring  originality, he represented the dry contrapuntal school of Italian  music. He was "]]]
