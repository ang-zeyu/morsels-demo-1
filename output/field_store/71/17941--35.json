He was defeated by Verginius Rufus, commanding the           forces in Upper Germany, and committed suicide. Verginius           afterwards declared for Galba, though his troops wanted to           make him emperor. Cp. chap. 8.        [16] Clodius Macer commanded Legio III Augusta and governed           Numidia, which Tiberius at the end of his reign had detached           from the pro-consulate of Africa.        [17] Governor of Lower Germany. See chap. 58 and iii. 62.        [18] Cp. chap. 58.            THE DISTRIBUTION OF FORCES    Such then at Rome was the variety of feeling natural in so vast a        8  population. To turn to the provinces abroad: Spain was under the  command of Cluvius Rufus, a man of great eloquence, and more skilled  in the arts of peace than of war.[19] The Gallic provinces had not  forgotten Vindex: moreover, they were bound to Galba by his recent  grant of Roman citizenship and his rebate of their tribute for the  future. The tribes, however, which lay nearest to the armies stationed  in Germany had not received these honours: some even had lost part of  their territory and were equally aggrieved at the magnitude of their  own injuries and of their neighbours' benefits. The troops in Germany  were proud of their recent victory, indignant at their treatment and  perplexed by a nervous consciousness that they had supported the wrong  side: a very dangerous state for so strong a force to be in. They had  been slow to desert Nero, and Verginius[20] did not immediately  declare for Galba. Whether he really did not want the throne is  doubtful: without question his soldiers made him the offer. The death  of Fonteius Capito aroused the indignation even of those who had no  right to complain. However, they still lacked a leader: Galba had sent  for Verginius under a pretence of friendship, and, when he was not  allowed to return and was even charged with treachery, the soldiers  considered his case their own.    The army of Upper Germany felt no respect for their commander,           9  Hordeonius Flaccus.[21] Weakened by age and an affection of the feet  he was without resolution or authority, and could not have controlled  the mildest troops. These fiery spirits were only the further inflamed  when they felt such a weak hand on the reins. The legions of Lower  Germany had been for some time without a commander,[22] until Aulus  Vitellius appeared. He was the son of the Lucius Vitellius who had  been censor and thrice consul,[23] and Galba thought this sufficient  to impress the troops. The army in Britain showed no bad feeling. All  through the disturbance of the civil wars no troops kept cleaner  hands. This may have been because they were so far away and severed by  the sea, or perhaps frequent engagements had taught them to keep their  rancour for the enemy. Quiet ruled in Illyricum also, although the  legions, which had been summoned by Nero,[24] while lingering in Italy  had made overtures to Verginius. But the armies lay far apart, always  a sound assistance to the maintenance of military discipline, since  the men could neither share vices nor join forces.    The East was still untroubled. Licinius Mucianus held Syria with        10  four legions.[25] He was a man who was always famous, whether in good  fortune or in bad. As a youth he was ambitious and cultivated the  friendship of the great. Later he found himself in straitened  circumstances and a very ambiguous position, and, suspecting Claudius'  displeasure, he withdrew into the wilds of Asia, where he came as near  to being an exile as afterwards to being an emperor. He was a strange  mixture of good and bad, of luxury and industry, courtesy and  arrogance. In leisure he was self-indulgent, but full of vigour on  service. His outward behaviour was praiseworthy, though ill was spoken  of his private life. However, with those who were under him or near  him, and with his colleagues he gained great influence by various  devices, and seems to have been the sort of man who would more readily  make an emperor than be one.    The Jewish war was being conducted by Flavius Vespasianus--appointed  by Nero--with three legions.[26] He had no ill-will against Galba, and  nothing to hope from his fall. Indeed he had sent his son Titus to  carry his compliments and offer allegiance, an incident we must  reserve for its proper place.[27] It was only after Vespasian's rise  that Roman society came to believe in the mysterious movings of  Providence, and supposed that portents and oracles had predestined the  throne for him and his family.    Of Egypt and its garrison, ever since the days of the sainted           11  Augustus, the knights of Rome have been uncrowned kings.[28] The  province being difficult to reach, rich in crops, torn and tossed by  fanaticism and sedition, ignorant of law, unused to bureaucratic  government, it seemed wiser to keep it in the control of the  Household.[29] The governor at that date was Tiberius Alexander,  himself a native of Egypt.[30] Africa and its legions, now that  Clodius Macer had been executed,[31] were ready to put up with any  ruler after their experience of a petty master. The two Mauretanias,  Raetia, Noricum, Thrace, and the other provinces governed by  procurators had their sympathies determined by the neighbourhood of  troops, and always caught their likes or dislikes from the strongest  army. The ungarrisoned provinces, and chief amongst these Italy, were  destined to be the prize of war, and lay at the mercy of any master.  Such was the state of the Roman world when Servius Galba, consul for  the second time, and Titus Vinius his colleague, inaugurated the year  which was to be their last, and almost the last for the commonwealth  of Rome.    FOOTNOTES:        [19] He wrote a history of his own time, which was one of           Tacitus' chief authorities.        [20] See note 17.        [21] Verginius' successor.

'Amongst other secret principles of           his imperial policy, Augustus had put Egypt in a position by           itself, forbidding all senators and knights of the highest           class to enter that country without his permission. For Egypt           holds the key, as it were, both of sea and land' (tr. Ramsay).           Cp. iii. 8.        [29] i.e. to govern it by the emperor's private agents. The           province was regarded as part of the emperor's estate           (patrimonium). This post was the highest in the imperial           service.        [30] A member of a Jewish family settled in Alexandria and           thus entitled to Roman citizenship. He was a nephew of the           historian Philo; had been Procurator of Judaea and chief of           Corbulo's staff in Armenia.        [31] See chap. 7.      THE GERMAN REVOLT AND THE ADOPTION OF PISO    A few days after the first of January a dispatch arrived from           12  Belgica, in which Pompeius Propinquus,[32] the imperial agent,  announced that the legions of Upper Germany had broken their oath of  allegiance and were clamouring for a new emperor, but that by way of  tempering their treason they referred the final choice to the Senate  and People of Rome. Galba had already been deliberating and seeking  advice as to the adoption of a successor, and this occurrence hastened  his plans. During all these months this question formed the current  subject of gossip throughout the country; Galba was far spent in years  and the general propensity for such a topic knew no check. Few people  showed sound judgement or any spirit of patriotism. Many were  influenced by foolish hopes and spread self-interested rumours  pointing to some friend or patron, thereby also gratifying their  hatred for Titus Vinius,[33] whose unpopularity waxed daily with his  power. Galba's affability only served to strengthen the gaping  ambition of his newly powerful friends, for his weakness and credulity  halved the risk and doubled the reward of treason.    The real power of the throne was divided between the consul, Titus      13  Vinius, and Cornelius Laco, the prefect of the Guards; and an  influence as great was enjoyed by Icelus, one of Galba's freedmen, who  had been given the gold ring[34] and was now greeted by the name of  Marcianus. These three ordinarily disagreed, and followed each his own  interest in smaller matters: on the question of the succession they  fell into two camps. Vinius was for Marcus Otho. Laco and Icelus were  agreed not so much on any one as on any other. Galba was aware of the  friendship between Otho and Vinius. Otho was a bachelor and Vinius had  an unmarried daughter: so gossip, never reticent, pointed to them as  father and son-in-law. Galba, one may suppose, felt some concern for  his country, too. Why take the throne from Nero, if it was to be left  to Otho? Otho had led a careless boyhood and a dissolute youth, and  endeared himself to Nero by aping his vices. Thus it was to Otho, as  being already in the secret, that Nero entrusted his favourite  mistress, Poppaea Sabina,[35] until he could get rid of Octavia. Later  he grew jealous and removed Otho to the province of Lusitania under  cover of a governorship. Otho had been popular in his administration  of the province, and was one of the first to join Galba's party. Being  a man of action and one of the most distinguished of Galba's officers  in the war, when once he had conceived the hope of succeeding him, he  eagerly indulged it. Most of the soldiers were on his side and the  Court supported "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16939"],[0,"Gems of Divine Mysteries (#4)"],[1,"past, that thou mayest inhale the sweet savours of eternity from the  Joseph of faithfulness, gain admittance into the celestial Egypt, and  perceive the fragrances of enlightenment from this resplendent and  luminous Tablet, a Tablet wherein the Pen hath inscribed the ancient  mysteries of the names of His Lord, the Exalted, the Most High. Perchance  thou mayest be recorded in the holy Tablets among them that are well  assured.    30 O thou who art standing before My Throne and yet remain unaware  thereof! Know thou that whoso seeketh to scale the summits of the divine  mysteries must needs strive to the utmost of his power and capacity for  his Faith, that the pathway of guidance may be made clear unto him. And  should he encounter One Who layeth claim to a Cause from God, and Who  holdeth from His Lord a testimony beyond the power of men to produce, he  must needs follow Him in all that He pleaseth to proclaim, command and  ordain, even were He to decree the sea to be land, or to pronounce earth  to be heaven, or that the former lieth above the latter or below it, or to  ordain any change or transformation, for He, verily, is aware of the  celestial mysteries, the unseen subtleties, and the ordinances of God.    31 Were the peoples of every nation to observe that which hath been  mentioned, the matter would be made simple unto them, and such words and  allusions would not withhold them from the Ocean of the names and  attributes of God. And had the people known this truth, they would not  have denied God's favours, nor would they have risen against, contended  with, and rejected His Prophets. Similar passages are also to be found in  the Qur'an, should the matter be carefully examined.    32 Know, moreover, that it is through such words that God proveth His  servants and sifteth them, separating the believer from the infidel, the  detached from the worldly, the pious from the profligate, the doer of good  from the worker of iniquity, and so forth. Thus hath the Dove of holiness  proclaimed: \"Do men think when they say 'We believe' they shall be let  alone and not be put to proof?\"(23)    33 It behoveth him who is a wayfarer in the path of God and a wanderer in  His way to detach himself from all who are in the heavens and on the  earth. He must renounce all save God, that perchance the portals of mercy  may be unlocked before his face and the breezes of providence may waft  over him. And when he hath inscribed upon his soul that which We have  vouchsafed unto him of the quintessence of inner meaning and explanation,  he will fathom all the secrets of these allusions, and God shall bestow  upon his heart a divine tranquillity and cause him to be of them that are  at peace with themselves. In like manner wilt thou comprehend the meaning  of all the ambiguous verses that have been sent down concerning the  question thou didst ask of this Servant Who abideth upon the seat of  abasement, Who walketh upon the earth as an exile with none to befriend,  comfort, aid, or assist Him, Who hath placed His whole trust in God, and  Who proclaimeth at all times: \"Verily we are God's, and to Him shall we  return.\" (24)    34 Know thou that the passages that We have called \"ambiguous\" appear as  such only in the eyes of them that have failed to soar above the horizon  of guidance and to reach the heights of knowledge in the retreats of  grace. For otherwise, unto them that have recognized the Repositories of  divine Revelation and beheld through His inspiration the mysteries of  divine authority, all the verses of God are perspicuous and all His  allusions are clear. Such men discern the inner mysteries that have been  clothed in the garment of words as clearly as ye perceive the heat of the  sun or the wetness of water, nay even more distinctly. Immeasurably  exalted is God above our praise of His loved ones, and beyond their praise  of Him!    35 Now that We have reached this most excellent theme and attained such  lofty heights by virtue of that which hath flowed from this Pen through  the incomparable favours of God, the Exalted, the Most High, it is Our  wish to disclose unto thee certain stations in the wayfarer's journey  towards his Creator. Perchance all that thine eminence hath desired may be  revealed unto thee, that the proof may be made complete and the blessing  abundant.    36 Know thou of a truth that the seeker must, at the beginning of his  quest for God, enter the Garden of Search. In this journey it behoveth the  wayfarer to detach himself from all save God and to close his eyes to all  that is in the heavens and on the earth. There must not linger in his  heart either the hate or the love of any soul, to the extent that they  would hinder him from attaining the habitation of the celestial Beauty. He  must sanctify his soul from the veils of glory and refrain from boasting  of such worldly vanities, outward knowledge, or other gifts as God may  have bestowed upon him. He must search after the truth to the utmost of  his ability and exertion, that God may guide him in the paths of His  favour and the ways of His mercy. For He, verily, is the best of helpers  unto His servants. He saith, and He verily speaketh the truth: \"Whoso  maketh efforts for Us, in Our ways shall We assuredly guide him.\" (25) And  furthermore: \"Fear God and God will give you knowledge.\" (26)    37 In this journey the seeker becometh witness to a myriad changes and  transformations, confluences and divergences. He beholdeth the wonders of  Divinity in the mysteries of creation and discovereth the paths of  guidance and the ways of His Lord. Such is the station reached by them  that search after God, and such are the heights attained by those who  hasten unto Him.    38 When once the seeker hath ascended unto this station, he will enter the  City of Love and Rapture, whereupon the winds of love will blow and the  breezes of the spirit will waft. In this station the seeker is so overcome  by the ecstasies of yearning and the fragrances of longing that he  discerneth not his left from his right, nor doth he distinguish land from  sea or desert from mountain. At every moment he burneth with the fire of  longing and is consumed by the onslaught of separation in this world. He  speedeth through the Paran of love and traverseth the Horeb of rapture.  Now he laugheth, now he weepeth sore; now he reposeth in peace, now he  trembleth in fear. Nothing can alarm him, naught can thwart his purpose,  and no law can restrain him. He standeth ready to obey whatsoever His Lord  should please to decree as to his beginning and his end. With every breath  he layeth down his life and offereth up his soul. He bareth his breast to  meet the darts of the enemy and raiseth his head to greet the sword of  destiny; nay rather, he kisseth the hand of his would-be murderer and  surrendereth his all. He yieldeth up spirit, soul, and body in the path of  his Lord, and yet he doeth so by the leave of his Beloved and not of his  own whim and desire. Thou findest him chill in the fire and dry in the  sea, abiding in every land and treading every path. Whosoever toucheth him  in this state will perceive the heat of his love. He walketh the heights  of detachment and traverseth the vale of renunciation. His eyes are ever  expectant to witness the wonders of God's mercy and eager to behold the  splendours of His beauty. Blessed indeed are they that have attained unto  such a station, for this is the station of the ardent lovers and the  enraptured souls.    39 And when this stage of the journey is completed and the wayfarer hath  soared beyond this lofty station, he entereth the City of Divine Unity,  and the garden of oneness, and the court of detachment. In this plane the  seeker casteth away all signs, allusions, veils, and words, and beholdeth  all things with an eye illumined by the effulgent lights which God Himself  hath shed upon him. In his journey he seeth all differences return to a  single word and all allusions culminate in a single point. Unto this  beareth witness he who sailed upon the ark of fire and followed the inmost  path to the pinnacle of glory in the realm of immortality: \"Knowledge is  one point, which the foolish have multiplied.\"(27) This is the station  that hath been alluded to in the tradition: \"I am He, Himself, and He is  I, Myself, except that I am that I am, and He is that He is.\"(28)    40 In this station, were He Who is the Embodiment of the End to say:  \"Verily, I am the Point of the Beginning\", He would indeed be speaking the  truth. And were He to say: \"I am other than Him\", this would be equally  true. Likewise, were He to proclaim: \"Verily, I am the Lord of heaven and  earth\", or \"the King of kings\", or \"the Lord of the realm above\", or  Muhammad, or 'Ali, or their descendants, or aught else, He would indeed be  proclaiming the truth of God. He, verily, ruleth over all created things  and standeth supreme above all besides Him. Hast thou not heard what hath  been said aforetime: \"Muhammad is our first, Muhammad our last, Muhammad  our all\"? And elsewhere: \"They all proceed from the same Light\"?    41 In this station the truth of the unity of God and of the signs of His  sanctity is established. Thou shalt indeed see them all rising above the  bosom of God's might and embraced in the arms of His mercy; nor can any  distinction be made between His bosom and His arms. To speak of change or  transformation in this plane would be sheer blasphemy and utter impiety,  for this is the station wherein the light of divine unity shineth forth,  and the truth of His oneness is expressed, and the splendours of the  everlasting Morn are reflected in lofty and faithful mirrors. By God! Were  I to reveal the full measure of that which He hath ordained for this  station, the souls of men would depart from their bodies, the inner  realities of all things would be shaken in their foundations, they that  dwell within the realms of creation would"]]]
