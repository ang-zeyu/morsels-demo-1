One creature alone he found it  necessary to treat with harshness: this was Caliban, the son of the  wicked old witch, a hideous, deformed monster, horrible to look on, and  vicious and brutal in all his habits.    When Miranda was grown up into a maiden, sweet and fair to see, it  chanced that Antonio and Alonso, with Sebastian, his brother, and  Ferdinand, his son, were at sea together with old Gonzalo, and their  ship came near Prospero's island. Prospero, knowing they were there,  raised by his art a great storm, so that even the sailors on board gave  themselves up for lost; and first among them all Prince Ferdinand leaped  into the sea, and, as his father thought in his grief, was drowned. But  Ariel brought him safe ashore; and all the rest of the crew, although  they were washed overboard, were landed unhurt in different parts of  the island, and the good ship herself, which they all thought had been  wrecked, lay at anchor in the harbor whither Ariel had brought her. Such  wonders could Prospero and his spirits perform.    While yet the tempest was raging, Prospero showed his daughter the brave  ship laboring in the trough of the sea, and told her that it was filled  with living human beings like themselves. She, in pity of their lives,  prayed him who had raised this storm to quell it. Then her father bade  her to have no fear, for he intended to save every one of them.    Then, for the first time, he told her the story of his life and hers,  and that he had caused this storm to rise in order that his enemies,  Antonio and Alonso, who were on board, might be delivered into his  hands.    When he had made an end of his story he charmed her into sleep, for  Ariel was at hand, and he had work for him to do. Ariel, who longed  for his complete freedom, grumbled to be kept in drudgery, but on being  threateningly reminded of all the sufferings he had undergone when  Sycorax ruled in the land, and of the debt of gratitude he owed to the  master who had made those sufferings to end, he ceased to complain, and  promised faithfully to do whatever Prospero might command.    \"Do so,\" said Prospero, \"and in two days I will discharge thee.\"    Then he bade Ariel take the form of a water nymph and sent him in search  of the young prince. And Ariel, invisible to Ferdinand, hovered near  him, singing the while--       \"Come unto these yellow sands        And then take hands:      Court'sied when you have, and kiss'd        (The wild waves whist),      Foot it featly here and there;      And, sweet sprites, the burden bear!\"    And Ferdinand followed the magic singing, as the song changed to a  solemn air, and the words brought grief to his heart, and tears to his  eyes, for thus they ran--       \"Full fathom five thy father lies;        Of his bones are coral made.      Those are pearls that were his eyes,        Nothing of him that doth fade,      But doth suffer a sea-change      Into something rich and strange.      Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell.      Hark! now I hear them,-- ding dong bell!\"    And so singing, Ariel led the spell-bound prince into the presence of  Prospero and Miranda. Then, behold! all happened as Prospero desired.  For Miranda, who had never, since she could first remember, seen  any human being save her father, looked on the youthful prince with  reverence in her eyes, and love in her secret heart.    \"I might call him,\" she said, \"a thing divine, for nothing natural I  ever saw so noble!\"    And Ferdinand, beholding her beauty with wonder and delight, exclaimed--    \"Most sure the goddess on whom these airs attend!\"    Nor did he attempt to hide the passion which she inspired in him, for  scarcely had they exchanged half a dozen sentences, before he vowed to  make her his queen if she were willing. But Prospero, though secretly  delighted, pretended wrath.    \"You come here as a spy,\" he said to Ferdinand. \"I will manacle your  neck and feet together, and you shall feed on fresh water mussels,  withered roots and husk, and have sea-water to drink. Follow.\"    \"No,\" said Ferdinand, and drew his sword. But on the instant Prospero  charmed him so that he stood there like a statue, still as stone; and  Miranda in terror prayed her father to have mercy on her lover. But he  harshly refused her, and made Ferdinand follow him to his cell. There  he set the Prince to work, making him remove thousands of heavy logs of  timber and pile them up; and Ferdinand patiently obeyed, and thought his  toil all too well repaid by the sympathy of the sweet Miranda.    She in very pity would have helped him in his hard work, but he would  not let her, yet he could not keep from her the secret of his love, and  she, hearing it, rejoiced and promised to be his wife.    Then Prospero released him from his servitude, and glad at heart, he  gave his consent to their marriage.    \"Take her,\" he said, \"she is thine own.\"    In the meantime, Antonio and Sebastian in another part of the island  were plotting the murder of Alonso, the King of Naples, for Ferdinand  being dead, as they thought, Sebastian would succeed to the throne on  Alonso's death. And they would have carried out their wicked purpose  while their victim was asleep, but that Ariel woke him in good time.    Many tricks did Ariel play them. Once he set a banquet before them, and  just as they were going to fall to, he appeared to them amid thunder  and lightning in the form of a harpy, and immediately the banquet  disappeared. Then Ariel upbraided them with their sins and vanished too.    Prospero by his enchantments drew them all to the grove without his  cell, where they waited, trembling and afraid, and now at last bitterly  repenting them of their sins.    Prospero determined to make one last use of his magic power, \"And then,\"  said he, \"I'll break my staff and deeper than did ever plummet sound  I'll drown my book.\"    So he made heavenly music to sound in the air, and appeared to them in  his proper shape as the Duke of Milan. Because they repented, he  forgave them and told them the story of his life since they had cruelly  committed him and his baby daughter to the mercy of wind and waves.  Alonso, who seemed sorriest of them all for his past crimes, lamented  the loss of his heir. But Prospero drew back a curtain and showed them  Ferdinand and Miranda playing at chess. Great was Alonso's joy to greet  his loved son again, and when he heard that the fair maid with whom  Ferdinand was playing was Prospero's daughter, and that the young folks  had plighted their troth, he said--    \"Give me your hands, let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart that  doth not wish you joy.\"    So all ended happily. The ship was safe in the harbor, and next day they  all set sail for Naples, where Ferdinand and Miranda were to be married.  Ariel gave them calm seas and auspicious gales; and many were the  rejoicings at the wedding.    Then Prospero, after many years of absence, went back to his own  dukedom, where he was welcomed with great joy by his faithful subjects.  He practiced the arts of magic no more, but his life was happy, and not  only because he had found his own again, but chiefly because, when his  bitterest foes who had done him deadly wrong lay at his mercy, he took  no vengeance on them, but nobly forgave them.    As for Ariel, Prospero made him free as air, so that he could wander  where he would, and sing with a light heart his sweet song--       \"Where the bee sucks, there suck I:      In a cowslip's bell I lie;      There I couch when owls do cry.      On the bat's back I do fly      After summer, merrily:      Merrily, merrily, shall I live now,      Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.\"          AS YOU LIKE IT        There was once a wicked Duke named Frederick, who took the dukedom that  should have belonged to his brother, sending him into exile. His  brother went into the Forest of Arden, where he lived the life of a bold  forester, as Robin Hood did in Sherwood Forest in merry England.    The banished Duke's daughter, Rosalind, remained with Celia, Frederick's  daughter, and the two loved each other more than most sisters. One day  there was a wrestling match at Court, and Rosalind and Celia went to see  it. Charles, a celebrated wrestler, was there, who had killed many men  in contests of this kind. Orlando, the young man he was to wrestle with,  was so slender and youthful, that Rosalind and Celia thought he would  surely be killed, as others had been; so they spoke to him, and asked  him not to attempt so dangerous an adventure; but the only effect of  their words was to make him wish more to come off well in the encounter,  so as to win praise from such sweet ladies.    Orlando, like Rosalind's father, was being kept out of his inheritance  by his brother, and was so sad at his brother's unkindness that, until  he saw Rosalind, he did not care much whether he lived or died. But now  the sight of the fair Rosalind gave him strength and courage, so that  he did marvelously, and at last, threw Charles to such a tune, that the  wrestler had to be carried off the ground. Duke Frederick was pleased  with his courage, and asked his name.    \"My name is Orlando, and I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys,\"  said the young man.    Now Sir Rowland de Boys, when he was alive, had been a good friend to  the banished Duke, so that Frederick heard with regret whose son Orlando  was, and would not befriend him. But Rosalind was delighted to hear that  this handsome young stranger was the son of her father's old friend, and  as they were going away, she turned back more than once to say another  kind word to the brave young man.    \"Gentleman,\" she said, giving him a chain from her neck, \"wear this for  me. I could give more, but that my hand lacks means.\"    Rosalind and Celia, when they were alone, began to talk about the  handsome wrestler, and Rosalind confessed that she loved him at first  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14300"],[0,"The Life of Napoleon I (Complete) (#4)"],[1,"which heroes are made. His seems to have  been an ill-balanced nature, soon buoyed up by enthusiasms, and as  speedily depressed by their evaporation; endowed with enough of  learning and culture to be a Voltairean and write second-rate  verses; and with a talent for intrigue which sufficed to embarrass  his never very affluent fortunes. Napoleon certainly derived no  world-compelling qualities from his father: for these he was indebted  to the wilder strain which ran in his mother's blood. The father  doubtless saw in the French connection a chance of worldly advancement  and of liberation from pecuniary difficulties; for the new rulers now  sought to gain over the patrician families of the island. Many of them  had resented the dictatorship of Paoli; and they now gladly accepted  the connection with France, which promised to enrich their country and  to open up a brilliant career in the French army, where commissions  were limited to the scions of nobility.    Much may be said in excuse of Charles Buonaparte's decision, and no  one can deny that Corsica has ultimately gained much by her connection  with France. But his change of front was open to the charge that it  was prompted by self-interest rather than by philosophic foresight. At  any rate, his second son throughout his boyhood nursed a deep  resentment against his father for his desertion of the patriots'  cause. The youth's sympathies were with the peasants, whose allegiance  was not to be bought by baubles, whose constancy and bravery long held  out against the French in a hopeless guerilla warfare. His hot  Corsican blood boiled at the stories of oppression and insult which he  heard from his humbler compatriots. When, at eleven years of age, he  saw in the military college at Brienne the portrait of Choiseul, the  French Minister who had urged on the conquest of Corsica, his passion  burst forth in a torrent of imprecations against the traitor; and,  even after the death of his father in 1785, he exclaimed that he could  never forgive him for not following Paoli into exile.    What trifles seem, at times, to alter the current of human affairs!  Had his father acted thus, the young Napoleon would in all probability  have entered the military or naval service of Great Britain; he might  have shared Paoli's enthusiasm for the land of his adoption, and have  followed the Corsican hero in his enterprises against the French  Revolution, thenceforth figuring in history merely as a greater  Marlborough, crushing the military efforts of democratic France, and  luring England into a career of Continental conquest. Monarchy and  aristocracy would have gone unchallenged, except within the \"natural  limits\" of France; and the other nations, never shaken to their  inmost depths, would have dragged on their old inert fragmentary  existence.    The decision of Charles Buonaparte altered the destiny of Europe. He  determined that his eldest boy, Joseph, should enter the Church, and  that Napoleon should be a soldier. His perception of the characters of  his boys was correct. An anecdote, for which the elder brother is  responsible, throws a flood of light on their temperaments. The master  of their school arranged a mimic combat for his pupils--Romans against  Carthaginians. Joseph, as the elder was ranged under the banner of  Rome, while Napoleon was told off among the Carthaginians; but, piqued  at being chosen for the losing side, the child fretted, begged, and  stormed until the less bellicose Joseph agreed to change places with  his exacting junior. The incident is prophetic of much in the later  history of the family.    Its imperial future was opened up by the deft complaisance now shown  by Charles Buonaparte. The reward for his speedy submission to France  was soon forthcoming. The French commander in Corsica used his  influence to secure the admission of the young Napoleon to the  military school of Brienne in Champagne; and as the father was able to  satisfy the authorities not only that he was without fortune, but also  that his family had been noble for four generations, Napoleon was  admitted to this school to be educated at the charges of the King of  France (April, 1779). He was now, at the tender age of nine, a  stranger in a strange land, among a people whom he detested as the  oppressors of his countrymen. Worst of all, he had to endure the taunt  of belonging to a subject race. What a position for a proud and  exacting child! Little wonder that the official report represented him  as silent and obstinate; but, strange to say, it added the word  \"imperious.\" It was a tough character which could defy repression  amidst such surroundings. As to his studies, little need be said. In  his French history he read of the glories of the distant past (when  \"Germany was part of the French Empire\"), the splendours of the reign  of Louis XIV., the disasters of France in the Seven Years' War, and  the \"prodigious conquests of the English in India.\" But his  imagination was kindled from other sources. Boys of pronounced  character have always owed far more to their private reading than to  their set studies; and the young Buonaparte, while grudgingly learning  Latin and French grammar, was feeding his mind on Plutarch's  \"Lives\"--in a French translation. The artful intermingling of the  actual and the romantic, the historic and the personal, in those vivid  sketches of ancient worthies and heroes, has endeared them to many  minds. Rousseau derived unceasing profit from their perusal; and  Madame Roland found in them \"the pasture of great souls.\" It was so  with the lonely Corsican youth. Holding aloof from his comrades in  gloomy isolation, he caught in the exploits of Greeks and Romans a  distant echo of the tragic romance of his beloved island home. The  librarian of the school asserted that even then the young soldier had  modelled his future career on that of the heroes of antiquity; and we  may well believe that, in reading of the exploits of Leonidas,  Curtius, and Cincinnatus, he saw the figure of his own antique  republican hero, Paoli. To fight side by side with Paoli against the  French was his constant dream. \"Paoli will return,\" he once exclaimed,  \"and as soon as I have strength, I will go to help him: and perhaps  together we shall be able to shake the odious yoke from off the neck  of Corsica.\"    But there was another work which exercised a great influence on his  young mind--the \"Gallic War\" of Caesar. To the young Italian the  conquest of Gaul by a man of his own race must have been a congenial  topic, and in Caesar himself the future conqueror may dimly have  recognized a kindred spirit. The masterful energy and all-conquering  will of the old Roman, his keen insight into the heart of a problem,  the wide sweep of his mental vision, ranging over the intrigues of the  Roman Senate, the shifting politics of a score of tribes, and the  myriad administrative details of a great army and a mighty  province--these were the qualities that furnished the chief mental  training to the young cadet. Indeed, the career of Caesar was destined  to exert a singular fascination over the Napoleonic dynasty, not only  on its founder, but also on Napoleon III.; and the change in the  character and career of Napoleon the Great may be registered mentally  in the effacement of the portraits of Leonidas and Paoli by those of  Caesar and Alexander. Later on, during his sojourn at Ajaccio in 1790,  when the first shadows were flitting across his hitherto unclouded  love for Paoli, we hear that he spent whole nights poring over Caesar's  history, committing many passages to memory in his passionate  admiration of those wondrous exploits. Eagerly he took Caesar's side as  against Pompey, and no less warmly defended him from the charge of  plotting against the liberties of the commonwealth[6]. It was a  perilous study for a republican youth in whom the military instincts  were as ingrained as the genius for rule.    Concerning the young Buonaparte's life at Brienne there exist few  authentic records and many questionable anecdotes. Of these last, that  which is the most credible and suggestive relates his proposal to his  schoolfellows to construct ramparts of snow during the sharp winter of  1783-4. According to his schoolfellow, Bourrienne, these mimic  fortifications were planned by Buonaparte, who also directed the  methods of attack and defence: or, as others say, he reconstructed  the walls according to the needs of modern war. In either case, the  incident bespeaks for him great power of organization and control. But  there were in general few outlets for his originality and vigour. He  seems to have disliked all his comrades, except Bourrienne, as much as  they detested him for his moody humours and fierce outbreaks of  temper. He is even reported to have vowed that he would do as much  harm as possible to the French people; but the remark smacks of the  story-book. Equally doubtful are the two letters in which he prays to  be removed from the indignities to which he was subjected at  Brienne[7]. In other letters which are undoubtedly genuine, he refers  to his future career with ardour, and writes not a word as to the  bullying to which his Corsican zeal subjected him. Particularly  noteworthy is the letter to his uncle begging him to intervene so as  to prevent Joseph Buonaparte from taking up a military career. Joseph,  writes the younger brother, would make a good garrison officer, as he  was well formed and clever at frivolous compliments--\"good therefore  for society, but for a fight--?\"    Napoleon's determination had been noticed by his teachers. They had  failed to bend his will, at least on important points. In lesser  details his Italian adroitness seems to have been of service; for the  officer who inspected the school reported of him: \"Constitution,  health excellent: character submissive, sweet, honest, grateful:  conduct very regular: has"]]]
