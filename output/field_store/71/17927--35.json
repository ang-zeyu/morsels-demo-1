The defense maintained by  its army in the earlier part of the struggle provided the breathing  space required by the other allies. All through the struggle the staying  power of the French provided example and created the necessary morale  for the co-operating Allied forces, until our own gallant soldiers could  be mustered and sent abroad for the knockout blow.    As is usual where conspiracies to perform dark deeds are hatched a clew  or record is left behind. In spite of Germany's protestations of  innocence, her loud cries that the war was forced upon her, there is  ample evidence that for years she had been planning it; that she wanted  it and only awaited the opportune time to launch it. It was a gradual  unearthing and examination of this evidence that at length revealed to  the world the astounding plot.    It is not necessary to touch more than briefly the evidence of Germany's  designs, and the intrigues through which she sought world domination and  the throttling of human liberty. The facts are now too well established  to need further confirmation. The ruthless manner in which the Kaiser's  forces prosecuted the war, abandoning all pretense of civilization and  relapsing into the most utter barbarism, is enough to convince anyone of  her definite and well prepared program, which she was determined to  execute by every foul means under the sun.    She had skillfully been laying her lines and building her military  machine for more than forty years. As the time approached for the blow  she intended to strike, she found it difficult to conceal her purposes.  Noises from the armed camp--bayings of the dogs of war--occasionally  stirred the sleeping world; an awakening almost occurred over what is  known as the Morocco incident.    On account of the weakness of the Moroccan government, intervention by  foreign powers had been frequent. Because of the heavy investment of  French capital and because the prevailing anarchy in Morocco threatened  her interests in Algeria, France came to be regarded as having special  interests in Morocco. In 1904 she gained the assent of Britain and the  cooperation of Spain in her policy. Germany made no protest; in fact,  the German Chancellor, von Bulow, declared that Germany was not  specially concerned with Moroccan affairs. But in 1905 Germany demanded  a reconsideration of the entire question.    France was forced against the will of her minister of foreign affairs,  Delcasse, to attend a conference at Algeciras. That conference discussed  placing Morocco under international control, but because France was the  only power capable of dealing with the anarchy in the country, she was  left in charge, subject to certain Spanish rights, and allowed to  continue her work. The Germans again declared that they had no political  interests in Morocco.    In 1909, Germany openly recognized the political interests of France in  Morocco. In 1911 France was compelled by disorders in the country to  penetrate farther into the interior. Germany under the pretext that her  merchants were not getting fair treatment in Morocco, reopened the  entire question and sent her gunboat Panther, to Agadir on the west  coast of Africa, as if to establish a port there, although she had no  interests in that part of the country. France protested vigorously and  Britain supported her.    Matters came very close to war. But Germany was not yet ready to force  the issue. Her action had been simply a pretext to find out the extent  to which England and France were ready to make common cause. She  recalled her gunboat and as a concession to obtain peace, was permitted  to acquire some territory in the French Congo country. But German  newspapers and German political utterances showed much bitterness.  Growling and snarling grew apace in Germany, and to those who made a  close study of the situation it became evident that Germany sooner or  later intended to launch a war.    One of the characteristic German utterances of the time, came from  Albrect Wirth, a German political writer of standing, in close touch  with the thought and aims of his nation. The utterance about to be  quoted may, in the light of later events, appear indiscreet, as Germany  wished to avoid an appearance of responsibility for the world war; but  the minds of the German people had to be prepared and this could not be  accomplished without some of the writers and public men letting the cat  out of the bag. Wirth said:    \"Morocco is easily worth a big war, or several. At best--and even  prudent Germany is getting to be convinced of this--war is only  postponed and not abandoned. Is such a postponement to our advantage?  They say we must wait for a better moment. Wait for the deepening of the  Kiel canal, for our navy laws to take full effect. It is not exactly  diplomatic to announce publicly to one's adversaries, 'To go to war now  does not tempt us, but three years hence we shall let loose a world  war'--No; if a war is really planned, not a word of it must be spoken;  one's designs must be enveloped in profound mystery; then brusquely, all  of a sudden, jump on the enemy like a robber in the darkness.\" The heavy  footed German had difficulty in moving with the stealth of a robber, but  the policy here recommended was followed.    In 1914, the three years indicated by Wirth had expired. There began to  occur dark comings and goings; mysterious meetings and conferences on  the continent of Europe. The German emperor, accompanied by the princes  and leaders of the German states, began to cruise the border and  northern seas of the Fatherland, where they would be safe from listening  ears, prying eyes, newspapers, telephones and telegraphs. It became  known that the Kaiser was cultivating the weak-minded Russian czar in  an attempt to win his country from its alliance with England and France.  There were no open rumblings of war, but the air was charged with  electricity like that preceeding a storm.    An unaccountable business depression affected pretty much the entire  world. Money, that most sensitive of all things, began to show  nervousness and a tendency to go into hiding. The bulk of the world was  still asleep to the real meaning of events, but it had begun to stir in  its dreams, as if some prescience, some premonition had begun to reach  it even in its slumbers.    Finally the first big event occurred--the tragedy that was not intended  to accomplish as much, but which hastened the dawn of the day in which  began the Spiritual Emancipation of the governments of earth. The  Archduke Francis Ferdinand, nephew of the emperor of Austria, heir to  the throne of Austria-Hungary and commander in chief of its army, and  his wife the duchess of Hohenburg, were assassinated June 28, 1914, by a  Serbian student, Gavrio Prinzip. The assassination occurred at Sarajevo  in Bosnia, a dependency, or rather, a Slavic state that had been seized  by Austria. It was the lightning flash that preceeded the thunder's  mighty crash.    Much has been written of the causes which led to the tragedy. Prinzip  may have been a fanatic, but he was undoubtedly aided in his act by a  number of others. The natural inference immediately formed was that the  murder was the outcome of years of ill feeling between Serbia and  Austria-Hungary, due to the belief of the people in the smaller state,  that their aspirations as a nation were hampered and blocked by the  German element in the Austrian empire. The countries had been on the  verge of war several years before over the seizure of Bosnia and  Herzegovina by Austria, and later over the disposition of Scutari and  certain Albanian territory conquered in the Balkan-Turkish struggle.    Events are coming to light which may place a new construction on the  causes leading to the assassination at Sarajevo. It was undoubtedly the  pretext sought by Germany for starting the great war. Whether it may not  have been carefully planned to serve that object and the Serbian  Prinzip, employed as a tool to bring it about, is not so certain.    Several years prior to the war, the celebrated Russian, Tolstoy, gave  utterance to a remarkable prophecy. Tolstoy was a mystic, and it was not  unusual for him to go into a semi-trance state in which he professed to  peer far into the future and obtain visions of things beyond the ken of  average men. The Russian czar was superstitious and it is said that the  German emperor had a strong leaning towards the mystic and psychic. In  fact, it has been stated that the Kaiser's claim to a partnership with  The Almighty was the result of delusions formed in his consultations  with mediums--the modern descendants of the soothsayers of olden times.    Tolstoy stated that both the Czar and the Kaiser desired to consult with  him and test his powers of divination. The three had a memorable  sitting. Some time afterwards the results were given to the world.  Tolstoy predicted the great war, and he stated his belief that the torch  which would start the conflagration would be lighted in the Balkans  about 1913.    Tolstoy was not a friend of either Russian or German autocracy, hence  his seance may have been but a clever ruse to discover what was in the  minds of the two rulers. Germany probably was not ready to start the war  in 1913, but there is abundant warrant for the belief that she was  trimming the torch at that time, and, who knows, the deluded Prinzip may  have been the torch.    The old dotard Francis Joseph who occupied the throne of  Austria-Hungary, was completely under the domination of the Germans. He  could be relied upon to further any designs which the Kaiser and the  German war lords might have.    The younger man, Francis Ferdinand, was not so easy to handle as his  aged uncle. Accounts agree that he was arrogant, ambitious and had a  will of his own. He was unpopular in his country and probably unpopular  with the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1662"],[0,"The 1997 CIA World Factbook (#4)"],[1," may begin in any month.

GDP: This entry gives the gross domestic product (GDP) or value of all  final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year. GDP  dollar estimates in the Factbook are derived from purchasing power  parity (PPP) calculations. See the note on GDP methodology for more  information.    GDP methodology: In the Economy section, GDP dollar estimates for all  countries are derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations  rather than from conversions at official currency exchange rates. The  PPP method involves the use of standardized international dollar price  weights, which are applied to the quantities of final goods and  services produced in a given economy. The data derived from the PPP  method provide a better comparison of economic well-being between  countries. The division of a GDP estimate in domestic currency by the  corresponding PPP estimate in dollars gives the PPP conversion rate.  When converted at PPP rates, $1,000 will buy the same market basket of  goods in any country. Whereas PPP estimates for OECD countries are  quite reliable, PPP estimates for developing countries are often rough  approximations. Most of the GDP estimates are based on extrapolation  of PPP numbers published by the UN International Comparison Program  (UNICP) and by Professors Robert Summers and Alan Heston of the  University of Pennsylvania and their colleagues. In contrast, currency  exchange rates depend on a variety of international and domestic  financial forces that often have little relation to domestic output.  In developing countries with weak currencies the exchange rate  estimate of GDP in dollars is typically one-fourth to one-half the PPP  estimate. Furthermore, exchange rates may suddenly go up or down by  10% or more because of market forces or official fiat whereas real  output has remained unchanged. On 12 January 1994, for example, the 14  countries of the African Financial Community (whose currencies are  tied to the French franc) devalued their currencies by 50%. This move,  of course, did not cut the real output of these countries by half. One  important caution: the proportion of, say, defense expenditures as a  percentage of GDP in local currency accounts may differ substantially  from the proportion when GDP accounts are expressed in PPP terms, as,  for example, when an observer tries to estimate the dollar level of  Russian or Japanese military expenditures. Note: the numbers for GDP  and other economic data can not be chained together from successive  volumes of the Factbook because of changes in the US dollar measuring  rod, revisions of data by statistical agencies, use of new or  different sources of information, and changes in national statistical  methods and practices.

Illicit drugs: This entry gives information on the five categories of  illicit drugs--narcotics, stimulants, depressants (sedatives),  hallucinogens, and cannabis. These categories include many drugs  legally produced and prescribed by doctors as well as those illegally  produced and sold outside of medical channels.    Cannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, which provides  hallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes marijuana  (pot, Acapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC,  Marinol), hashish (hash), and hashish oil (hash oil).    Coca (mostly Erythroxylum coca) is a bush with leaves that contain the  stimulant used to make cocaine. Coca is not to be confused with cocoa,  which comes from cacao seeds and is used in making chocolate, cocoa,  and cocoa butter.    Cocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca bush.    Depressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and anxiety and  include chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal,  phenobarbital), benzodiazepines (Librium, Valium), methaqualone  (Quaalude), glutethimide (Doriden), and others (Equanil, Placidyl,  Valmid).    Drugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical, mental,  emotional, or behavioral change in an individual.    Drug abuse is the use of any licit or illicit chemical substance that  results in physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral impairment in an  individual.    Hallucinogens are drugs that affect sensation, thinking,  self-awareness, and emotion. Hallucinogens include LSD (acid,  microdot), mescaline and peyote (mexc, buttons, cactus), amphetamine  variants (PMA, STP, DOB), phencyclidine (PCP, angel dust, hog),  phencyclidine analogues (PCE, PCPy, TCP), and others (psilocybin,  psilocyn).    Hashish is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp plant  (Cannabis sativa).    Heroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine.    Mandrax is a trade name for methaqualone, a pharmaceutical depressant.    Marijuana is the dried leaves of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis  sativa).    Methaqualone is a pharmaceutical depressant, referred to as mandrax in  Southwest Asia.    Narcotics are drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep, and refer  to opium, opium derivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural  narcotics include opium (paregoric, parepectolin), morphine  (MS-Contin, Roxanol), codeine (Tylenol with codeine, Empirin with  codeine, Robitussan AC), and thebaine. Semisynthetic narcotics include  heroin (horse, smack), and hydromorphone (Dilaudid). Synthetic  narcotics include meperidine or Pethidine (Demerol, Mepergan),  methadone (Dolophine, Methadose), and others (Darvon, Lomotil).    Opium is the brown, gummy exudate of the incised, unripe seedpod of  the opium poppy.    Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for the natural and  semisynthetic narcotics.    Poppy straw concentrate is the alkaloid derived from the mature dried  opium poppy.    Qat (kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of Catha edulis  that is chewed or drunk as tea.    Quaaludes is the North American slang"]]]
