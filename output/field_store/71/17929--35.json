The Indian god Varuna and the Sumerian Ea are  also found to have much in common, and it seems undoubted that the  Manu fish and flood myth is a direct Babylonian inheritance, like the  Yuga (Ages of the Universe) doctrine and the system of calculation  associated with it. It is of interest to note, too, that a portion of  the Gilgamesh epic survives in the _Ramayana_ story of the monkey god  Hanuman's search for the lost princess Sita; other relics of similar  character suggest that both the Gilgamesh and Hanuman narratives are  derived in part from a very ancient myth. Gilgamesh also figures in  Indian mythology as Yama, the first man, who explored the way to the  Paradise called \"The Land of Ancestors\", and over which he  subsequently presided as a god. Other Babylonian myths link with those  found in Egypt, Greece, Scandinavia, Iceland, and the British Isles  and Ireland. The Sargon myth, for instance, resembles closely the myth  of Scyld (Sceaf), the patriarch, in the _Beowulf_ epic, and both  appear to be variations of the Tammuz-Adonis story. Tammuz also  resembles in one of his phases the Celtic hero Diarmid, who was slain  by the \"green boar\" of the Earth Mother, as was Adonis by the boar  form of Ares, the Greek war god.    In approaching the study of these linking myths it would be as rash to  conclude that all resemblances are due to homogeneity of race as to  assume that folklore and mythology are devoid of ethnological  elements. Due consideration must be given to the widespread influence  exercised by cultural contact. We must recognize also that the human  mind has ever shown a tendency to arrive quite independently at  similar conclusions, when confronted by similar problems, in various  parts of the world.    But while many remarkable resemblances may be detected between the  beliefs and myths and customs of widely separated peoples, it cannot  be overlooked that pronounced and striking differences remain to be  accounted for. Human experiences varied in localities because all  sections of humanity were not confronted in ancient times by the same  problems in their everyday lives. Some peoples, for instance,  experienced no great difficulties regarding the food supply, which  might be provided for them by nature in lavish abundance; others were  compelled to wage a fierce and constant conflict against hostile  forces in inhospitable environments with purpose to secure adequate  sustenance and their meed of enjoyment. Various habits of life had to  be adopted in various parts of the world, and these produced various  habits of thought. Consequently, we find that behind all systems of  primitive religion lies the formative background of natural phenomena.  A mythology reflects the geography, the fauna and flora, and the  climatic conditions of the area in which it took definite and  permanent shape.    In Babylonia, as elsewhere, we expect, therefore, to find a mythology  which has strictly local characteristics--one which mirrors river and  valley scenery, the habits of life of the people, and also the various  stages of progress in the civilization from its earliest beginnings.  Traces of primitive thought--survivals from remotest antiquity--should  also remain in evidence. As a matter of fact Babylonian mythology  fulfils our expectations in this regard to the highest degree.    Herodotus said that Egypt was the gift of the Nile: similarly  Babylonia may be regarded as the gift of the Tigris and  Euphrates--those great shifting and flooding rivers which for long  ages had been carrying down from the Armenian Highlands vast  quantities of mud to thrust back the waters of the Persian Gulf and  form a country capable of being utilized for human habitation. The  most typical Babylonian deity was Ea, the god of the fertilizing and  creative waters.    He was depicted clad in the skin of a fish, as gods in other  geographical areas were depicted wearing the skins of animals which  were regarded as ancestors, or hostile demons that had to be  propitiated. Originally Ea appears to have been a fish--the  incarnation of the spirit of, or life principle in, the Euphrates  River. His centre of worship was at Eridu, an ancient seaport, where  apparently the prehistoric Babylonians (the Sumerians) first began to  utilize the dried-up beds of shifting streams to irrigate the soil.  One of the several creation myths is reminiscent of those early  experiences which produced early local beliefs:        O thou River, who didst create all things,      When the great gods dug thee out,      They set prosperity upon thy banks,      Within thee Ea, the king of the Deep, created his dwelling.[10]    The Sumerians observed that the land was brought into existence by  means of the obstructing reeds, which caused mud to accumulate. When  their minds began to be exercised regarding the origin of life, they  conceived that the first human beings were created by a similar  process:        Marduk (son of Ea) laid a reed upon the face of the waters,      He formed dust and poured it out beside the reed ...      He formed mankind.[11]    Ea acquired in time, as the divine artisan, various attributes which  reflected the gradual growth of civilization: he was reputed to have  taught the people how to form canals, control the rivers, cultivate  the fields, build their houses, and so on.    But although Ea became a beneficent deity, as a result of the growth  of civilization, he had also a demoniac form, and had to be  propitiated. The worshippers of the fish god retained ancient modes of  thought and perpetuated ancient superstitious practices.    The earliest settlers in the Tigro-Euphrates valley were  agriculturists, like their congeners, the proto-Egyptians and the  Neolithic Europeans. Before they broke away from the parent stock in  its area of characterization they had acquired the elements of  culture, and adopted habits of thought which were based on the  agricultural mode of life. Like other agricultural communities they  were worshippers of the \"World Mother\", the Creatrix, who was the  giver of all good things, the \"Preserver\" and also the  \"Destroyer\"--the goddess whose moods were reflected by natural  phenomena, and whose lovers were the spirits of the seasons.    In the alluvial valley which they rendered fit for habitation the  Sumerians came into contact with peoples of different habits of life  and different habits of thought. These were the nomadic pastoralists  from the northern steppe lands, who had developed in isolation  theories regarding the origin of the Universe which reflected their  particular experiences and the natural phenomena of their area of  characterization. The most representative people of this class were  the \"Hatti\" of Asia Minor, who were of Alpine or Armenoid stock. In  early times the nomads were broken up into small tribal units, like  Abraham and his followers, and depended for their food supply on the  prowess of the males. Their chief deity was the sky and mountain god,  who was the \"World Father\", the creator, and the wielder of the  thunder hammer, who waged war against the demons of storm or drought,  and ensured the food supply of his worshippers.    The fusion in Babylonia of the peoples of the god and goddess cults  was in progress before the dawn of history, as was the case in Egypt  and also in southern Europe. In consequence independent Pantheons came  into existence in the various city States in the Tigro-Euphrates  valley. These were mainly a reflection of city politics: the deities  of each influential section had to receive recognition. But among the  great masses of the people ancient customs associated with agriculture  continued in practice, and, as Babylonia depended for its prosperity  on its harvests, the force of public opinion tended, it would appear,  to perpetuate the religious beliefs of the earliest settlers, despite  the efforts made by conquerors to exalt the deities they introduced.    Babylonian religion was of twofold character. It embraced temple  worship and private worship. The religion of the temple was the  religion of the ruling class, and especially of the king, who was the  guardian of the people. Domestic religion was conducted in homes, in  reed huts, or in public places, and conserved the crudest  superstitions surviving from the earliest times. The great \"burnings\"  and the human sacrifices in Babylonia, referred to in the Bible, were,  no doubt, connected with agricultural religion of the private order,  as was also the ceremony of baking and offering cakes to the Queen of  Heaven, condemned by Jeremiah, which obtained in the streets of  Jerusalem and other cities. Domestic religion required no temples.  There were no temples in Crete: the world was the \"house\" of the  deity, who had seasonal haunts on hilltops, in groves, in caves, &c.  In Egypt Herodotus witnessed festivals and processions which are not  referred to in official inscriptions, although they were evidently  practised from the earliest times.    Agricultural religion in Egypt was concentrated in the cult of Osiris  and Isis, and influenced all local theologies. In Babylonia these  deities were represented by Tammuz and Ishtar. Ishtar, like Isis,  absorbed many other local goddesses.    According to the beliefs of the ancient agriculturists the goddess was  eternal and undecaying. She was the Great Mother of the Universe and  the source of the food supply. Her son, the corn god, became, as the  Egyptians put it, \"Husband of his Mother\". Each year he was born anew  and rapidly attained to manhood; then he was slain by a fierce rival  who symbolized the season of pestilence-bringing and parching sun  heat, or the rainy season, or wild beasts of prey. Or it might be that  he was slain by his son, as Cronos was by Zeus and Dyaus by Indra. The  new year slew the old year.

He may play such stuff to his wife, but not to us.\"    DOMINIE. Well, these \"Kinderscenen\" _are_ curious little bits for  grown-up men's hands. Your mother is right, they are too short: there  certainly ought to be more of them. But they are not waltzes!    STOCK. Indeed, I am not allowed to play waltzes at all. My teacher is  very thorough: first, I shall have to dig through all the Gradus ad  Parnassum; and then he is going to undertake a concerto of Beethoven's  with me, and will write the proper fingering over it. I shall play that  in public; and then, as he and my aunt say, \"I shall be the death of you  all.\"    MR. BUFFALO (_who has overheard him, steps up_). Now, Herr Dominie, how  do you like my method? Perhaps you have a different one? Nevertheless,  that shan't prevent our being good friends. Certainly, if any thing is  to be accomplished in these times, it is necessary to keep at  work,--that is my doctrine. But Stock, here, has unusual patience and  perseverance. He has worked through all Cramer's 96 Etudes in succession  without grumbling. He was wretched enough over them; but his papa bought  him a saddle-horse to ride round on every day, and he revived in the  fresh air.         (_Herr Zach with his wife and an old aunt are playing cards in the       further room._)    DOMINIE. But do you not combine the study of musical pieces with the  study of exercises, in order that the cultivation of the taste may go  hand in hand with mechanical improvement?    MR. BUFFALO. My dear friend, you are too narrow-minded there,--you make  a mistake: taste must come of itself, from much playing and with years.  Your Cecilia played the two new waltzes, and the Nocturne of Chopin, and  Beethoven's trio very nicely. But then that was all drilled into her: we  could tell that well enough by hearing it,--Stock and I.    DOMINIE. Did it sound unnatural to you,--mannered? and did you think it  wooden, dry, dull?    MR. BUFFALO. Not exactly that; but the trouble was it sounded _studied_.  The public applauded, it is true; but they don't know any thing. Stock  and I thought--    DOMINIE. Do you not think that the taste for a beautiful interpretation  may be early awakened, without using severity with the pupil? and that  to excite the feeling for music, to a certain degree, even in early  years, is in fact essential? The neglect of this very thing is the  reason that we are obliged to listen to so many players, who really have  mechanically practised themselves to death, and have reduced musical art  to mere machinery,--to an idle trick of the fingers.    MR. BUFFALO. That's all nonsense. I say teach them the scales, to run up  and down the gamut! Gradus ad Parnassum's the thing! Classical,  classical! Yesterday you made your daughter play that Trill-Etude by  Carl Meyer. Altogether too fine-sounding! It tickles the ear, to be  sure, especially when it is played in such a studied manner. _We_ stick  to Clementi and Cramer, and to Hummel's piano-school,--the good old  school. You have made a great mistake with your eldest daughter.    DOMINIE. The world does not seem to agree with you.    MADAME, of the Tz. family (_has listened and lost a trick by it, steps  up quickly, and says maliciously_). You must agree that she would have  played better, if you had left her for ten years with Cramer and  Clementi. We don't like this tendency to Schumann and Chopin. But what  folly to talk! One must be careful what one says to the father of such a  child! It is quite a different thing with us. Mr. Buffalo is bound to  our Stock by no bond of affection. He follows out his aim without any  hesitation or vanity, and looks neither to the right nor to the left,  but straightforward.    DOMINIE. I beg your pardon, madam: you may be right,--from your point of  view. We must be a little indulgent with sensitive people. But will not  your son play to us?         (_Stock plays two Etudes of Clementi, three of Cramer, and four       from the Gradus, but did not even grow warm over them. The horse       his father gave him has made him quite strong._)           *       *       *       *       *    I may be asked, \"But how did Stock play?\" How? I do not wish to write a  treatise: my plan is only to give hints and suggestions. I am not  writing in the interest of Stock, Buffalo, & Co.    After the playing, we went to supper: the oysters were good, but the  wine left a little sharp taste. My timid daughter did not like oysters;  but she ate a little salad, and at table listened instead of talking.    A few innocent anecdotes were related at table about horses and balls  and dogs and Stock's future. On taking leave, Madame said  condescendingly to Cecilia, \"If you keep on, my dear, one of these days  you will play very nicely.\"          CHAPTER III.    MANY STUDENTS OF THE PIANO AND FEW PLAYERS.      _(A Letter addressed to the Father of a Piano Pupil)._    It is a pity that you have no sons, for a father takes great delight in  his sons; but I agree with you, when you say that, if you had one, you  would rather he should break stones than pound the piano. You say you  have many friends who rejoice in that paternal felicity, and whose sons,  great and small, bright and dull, have been learning the piano for three  years or more, and still can do nothing. You are doubtless right; and,  further, they never will learn any thing. You ask, Of what use is it to  man or boy to be able to stammer through this or that waltz, or  polonaise or mazurka, with stiff arms, weak fingers, a stupid face, and  lounging figure? What gain is it to art? You say, Is not time worth  gold, and yet we are offered lead? And the poor teachers torment  themselves and the boys, abuse art and the piano; and at the end of the  evening, in despair, torment their own wives, after they have all day  long been scolding, cuffing, and lamenting, without success or  consolation. You speak the truth. I have had the same experience myself,  though not to the same degree, and though I did not bring home to my  wife a dreary face, but only a good appetite. But I did not give myself  up to lamentation over piano-teaching. I gathered up courage and rose  above mere drudgery. I reflected and considered and studied, and tried  whether I could not manage better, as I found I could not succeed with  the boys; and I have managed better and succeeded better, because I have  hit upon a different way, and one more in accordance with nature than  that used in the piano schools. I laid down, as the first and most  important principle, the necessity for \"the formation of a fine touch,\"  just as singing-teachers rely upon the culture of a fine tone, in order  to teach singing well. I endeavored, without notes, to make the  necessary exercises so interesting that the attention of the pupils  always increased; and that they even, after a short time, took great  pleasure in a sound, tender, full, singing tone; an acquirement which,  unfortunately, even many _virtuosos_ do not possess. In this way, we  made an opening at the beginning, not in the middle: we harnessed the  horse _before_ the wagon. The pupil now obtained a firm footing, and had  something to enjoy, without being tormented at every lesson with dry  matters to be learned, the advantage of which was not obvious to him,  and the final aim of which he did not perceive. Until a correct touch  has been acquired, it is of no use to talk about a fine singing tone.  How can we expect to arouse an interest by mere toneless tinkling, while  stiff, inflexible fingers are struggling with the notes; while the pupil  sees only his inability to do any thing right, and receives nothing but  blame from the teacher; while, at the same time, so much is to be kept  in mind, and he must be required to observe the time, and to use the  right fingers? Poor, stupid children! Later, after teaching the notes, I  did not fall into the universal error of selecting pieces which were  either too difficult, or such as, though purely musical, were not well  adapted to the piano; but I chose short, easy pieces, without prominent  difficulties, in the correct and skilful performance of which the pupil  might take pleasure. Consequently, they were studied carefully, slowly,  willingly, and with interest, which last is a great thing gained; for  the pupil rejoiced in the anticipation of success. The struggle over  single difficult places destroys all pleasure, palsies talent, creates  disgust, and, what is worse, it tends to render uncertain the  confirmation of the faculty already partially acquired,--of _bringing  out a fine legato tone, with loose and quiet fingers and a yielding,  movable wrist, without the assistance of the arm_.    You suppose that talent is especially wanting, and not merely good  teachers; for otherwise, with the zealous pursuit of piano-playing in  Saxony, we should produce hundreds who could, at least, play correctly  and with facility, if not finely. Here you are mistaken: we have, on the  contrary, a great deal of musical talent. There are, also, even in the  provincial cities, teachers who are not only musical, but who also  possess so much zeal and talent for teaching that many of their pupils  are able to play tolerably well. I will add further, that the taste for  music is much more cultivated and improved, even in small places, by  singing-societies and by public and private concerts, than was formerly  the case. We also have much better aids in instruction books, etudes,  and suitable piano pieces; but still we find everywhere \"jingling\" and  \"piano-banging,\" as you express it, and yet no piano-playing.    Let us consider this aspect of the subject a little more closely. In  the first place, the proper basis for a firm structure is wanting. The  knowledge of the notes cannot afford a proper basis, except in so far as  it is of service in the execution of a piece. Of what use are the notes  to a singer, if he has no attack, and does"]]]
