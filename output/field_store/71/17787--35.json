[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14033"],[0,"Plutarch's Lives, Volume 1 (of 4) (#4)"],[1," urged against the times which produced Epictetus, Dio  Chrysostom and Arrian; while at Rome, Pliny the Younger, Tacitus,  Martial, and Juvenal were reviving the memories of the Augustan age.    From several passages in Plutarch's writings we gather that he studied  under a master named Ammonius, at Athens. For instance, at the end of  his Life of Themistokles, he mentions a descendant of that great man who  was his fellow-student at the house of Ammonius the philosopher. Again,  he tells us that once Ammonius, observing at his afternoon lecture that  some of his class had indulged too freely in the pleasures of the table,  ordered his own son to be flogged, \"because,\" he said, \"the young  gentleman cannot eat his dinner without pickles,\" casting his eye at the  same time upon the other offenders so as to make them sensible that the  reproof applied to them also.    By way of completing his education he proceeded to visit Egypt. The  \"wisdom of the Egyptians\" always seems to have had a fascination for the  Greeks, and at this period Alexandria, with its famous library and its  memories of the Ptolemies, of Kallimachus and of Theokritus, was an  important centre of Greek intellectual activity. Plutarch's treatise on  Isis and Osiris is generally supposed to be a juvenile work suggested by  his Egyptian travels. In all the Graeco-Egyptian lore he certainly  became well skilled, although we have no evidence as to how long he  remained in Egypt. He makes mention indeed of a feast given in his  honour by some of his relatives on the occasion of his return home from  Alexandria, but we can gather nothing from the passage as to his age at  that time.    One anecdote of his early life is as follows:--\"I remember,\" he says,  \"that when I was still a young man, I was sent with another person on a  deputation to the Proconsul; my colleague, as it happened, was unable to  proceed, and I saw the Proconsul and performed the commission alone.  When I returned I was about to lay down my office and to give a public  account of how I had discharged it, when my father rose in the public  assembly and enjoined me not to say _I_ went, but _we_ went, nor to say  that _I_ said, but _we_ said, throughout my story, giving my colleague  his share.\"    The most important event in the whole of Plutarch's pious and peaceful  life is undoubtedly his journey to Italy and to Rome; but here again we  know little more than that he knew but little Latin when he went  thither, and was too busy when there to acquire much knowledge of that  tongue. His occupation at Rome, besides antiquarian researches which  were afterwards worked up into his Roman Lives, was the delivery of  lectures on philosophical and other subjects, a common practice among  the learned Greeks of his day. Many of these lectures, it is  conjectured, were afterwards recast by him into the numerous short  treatises on various subjects now included under the general name of  Moralia. Plutarch's visit to Rome and business there is admirably  explained in the following passage of North's 'Life of Plutarch':--\"For  my part, I think Plutarch was drawn to Rome by meanes of some friends he  had there, especially by Sossius Senecio, that had been a Consull, who  was of great estimation at that time, and namely under the Empire of  Trajan. And that which maketh me think so, is because of Plutarch's own  words, who saith in the beginning of his first book of his discourse at  the table, that he gathered together all his reasons and discourses made  here and there, as well in Rome with Senecio, as in Greece with Plutarch  and others. Not being likely that he would have taken the pains to have  made so long a voyage, and to have come to such a city where he  understood not their vulgar tongue, if he had not been drawn thither by  Senecio, and such other men; as also in acknowledgement of the good  turnes and honour he had received by such men, he dedicated diverse of  his bookes unto them, and among others, the Lives unto Senecio, and the  nine volumes of his discourse at the table, with the treaty, How a man  may know that he profiteth in vertue. Now for the time, considering what  he saith in the end of his book against curiosity, I suppose that he  taught in Rome in the time of Titus and of Domitian: for touching this  point, he maketh mention of a nobleman called Rusticus, who being one  day at his lecture, would not open a letter which was brought him from  the Emperor, nor interrupt Plutarch, but attended to the end of his  declamation, and until all the hearers were gone away; and addeth also,  that Rusticus was afterwards put to death by the commandment of  Domitian. Furthermore, about the beginning of the Life of Demosthenes,  Plutarch saith, that whilst he remained in Italy and at Rome, he had no  leizure to study the Latine tongue; as well for that he was busied at  that time with matters he had in hand, as also to satisfie those that  were his followers to learne philosophie of him.\"[A]    [Footnote A: North's 'Plutarch,' 1631, p. 1194.]    A list of all Plutarch's writings would be a very long one. Besides the  Lives, which is the work on which his fame chiefly rests, he wrote a  book of 'Table Talk,' which may have suggested to Athenaeus the plan of  his 'Symposium.'    The most remarkable of his minor works is that 'On the Malignity of  Herodotus.' Grote takes this treatise as being intended seriously as an  attack upon the historian, and speaks of the \"honourable frankness which  Plutarch calls his malignity.\" But it is probably merely a rhetorical  exercise, in which Plutarch has endeavoured to see what could be said  against so favourite and well-known a writer.    He was probably known as an author before he went to Rome. Large  capitals have always had a natural attraction for literary genius, as it  is in them alone that it can hope to be appreciated. And if this be the  case at the present day, how much more must it have been so before the  invention of printing, at a time when it was more usual to listen to  books read aloud than to read them oneself? Plutarch journeyed to Rome  just as Herodotus went to Athens, or as he is said to have gone to the  Olympian festival, in search of an intelligent audience of educated men.  Whether his object was merely praise, or whether he was influenced by  ideas of gain, we cannot say. No doubt his lectures were not delivered  gratis, and that they were well attended seems evident from Plutarch's  own notices of them, and from the names which have been preserved of the  eminent men who used to frequent them. Moreover, strange though it may  appear to us, the demand for books seems to have been very brisk even  though they were entirely written by hand.    The epigrams of Martial inform us of the existence of a class of slaves  whose occupation was copying books, and innumerable allusions in Horace,  Martial, &c., to the Sosii and others prove that the trade of a  bookseller at Rome was both extensive and profitable. Towards the end of  the Republic it became the fashion for Roman nobles to encourage  literature by forming a library, and this taste was given immense  encouragement by Augustus, who established a public library in the  Temple of Apollo on the Mount Palatine, in imitation of that previously  founded by Asinius Pollio. There were other libraries besides these, the  most famous of which was the Ulpian library, founded by Trajan, who  called it so from his own name, Ulpius. Now Trajan was a contemporary of  our author, and this act of his clearly proves that there must have been  during Plutarch's lifetime a considerable reading public, and consequent  demand for books at Rome.    Of Plutarch's travels in Italy we know next to nothing. He mentions  incidentally that he had seen the bust or statue of Marius at Ravenna,  but never gives us another hint of how far he explored the country about  which he wrote so much. No doubt his ignorance of the Latin language  must not be taken as a literal statement, and probably means that he was  not skilled in it as a spoken tongue, for we can scarcely imagine that  he was without some acquaintance with it when he first went to Rome, and  he certainly afterwards became well read in the literature of Rome. In  some cases he has followed Livy's narrative with a closeness which  proves that he must have been acquainted with that author either in the  original or in a translation, and the latter alternative is, of the two,  the more improbable.    It seems to be now generally thought that his stay at Rome was a short  one. Clough, in his excellent Preface, says on this subject, \"The fault  which runs through all the earlier biographies, from that of Rualdus  downwards, is the assumption, wholly untenable, that Plutarch passed  many years, as many perhaps as forty, at Rome. The entire character of  his life is of course altered by such an impression.\" He then goes on to  say that in consequence of this mistaken idea, it is not worth while for  him to quote Dryden's 'Life of Plutarch,' which was originally prefixed  to the translations re-edited by himself. Yet I trust I may be excused  if I again quote North's 'Life of Plutarch,' as the following passage  seems to set vividly before us the quiet literary occupation of his  later days.    \"For Plutarch, though he tarried a long while in Italy, and in Rome, yet  that tooke not away the remembrance of the sweet aire of Greece, and of  the little towne where he was borne; but being touched from time to time  with a sentence of an ancient poet, who saith that,        \"'In whatsoever countrey men are bred      (I know not by what sweetnesse of it led),      They nourish in their minds a glad desire,      Unto their native homes for to retire,'    \"he resolved to go back into Greece againe, there to end the rest of his  daies in rest and honour among his citizens, of whom he was honourably  welcomed home. Some judge that he left Rome after the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14056"],[0,"The French Impressionists (1860-1900) (#4)"],[1,"of the spectrum vibrate with different speed.  Painting should therefore try to discover here, as in the light parts,  the play of the atoms of solar light, instead of representing shadows  with ready-made tones composed of bitumen and black.    The third conclusion resulting from this: the colours in the shadow are  modified by _refraction_. That means, _f.i._ in a picture representing  an interior, the source of light (window) may not be indicated: the  light circling round the picture will then be composed of the  _reflections_ of rays whose source is invisible, and all the objects,  acting as mirrors for these reflections, will consequently influence  each other. Their colours will affect each other, even if the surfaces  be dull. A red vase placed upon a blue carpet will lead to a very  subtle, but mathematically exact, interchange between this blue and this  red, and this exchange of luminous waves will create between the two  colours a tone of reflections composed of both. These composite  reflections will form a scale of tones complementary of the two  principal colours. The science of optics can work out these  complementary colours with mathematical exactness. If _f.i._ a head  receives the orange rays of daylight from one side and the bluish light  of an interior from the other, green reflections will necessarily appear  on the nose and in the middle region of the face. The painter Besnard,  who has specially devoted himself to this minute study of complementary  colours, has given us some famous examples of it.    The last consequence of these propositions is that the blending of the  spectral tones is accomplished by a _parallel_ and _distinct_ projection  of the colours. They are artificially reunited on the crystalline: a  lens interposed between the light and the eye, and opposing the  crystalline, which is a living lens, dissociates again these united  rays, and shows us again the seven distinct colours of the atmosphere.  It is no less artificial if a painter mixes upon his palette different  colours to compose a tone; it is again artificial that paints have been  invented which represent some of the combinations of the spectrum, just  to save the artist the trouble of constantly mixing the seven solar  tones. Such mixtures are false, and they have the disadvantage of  creating heavy tonalities, since the coarse mixture of powders and oils  cannot accomplish the action of light which reunites the luminous waves  into an intense white of unimpaired transparency. The colours mixed on  the palette compose a dirty grey. What, then, is the painter to do, who  is anxious to approach, as near as our poor human means will allow, that  divine fairyland of nature? Here we touch upon the very foundations of  Impressionism. The painter will have to paint with only the seven  colours of the spectrum, and discard all the others: that is what Claude  Monet has done boldly, adding to them only white and black. He will,  furthermore, instead of composing mixtures on his palette, place upon  his canvas touches of none but the seven colours _juxtaposed_, and leave  the individual rays of each of these colours to blend at a certain  distance, so as to act like sunlight itself upon the eye of the  beholder.    [Illustration: DEGAS    WAITING]    This, then, is the theory of the _dissociation of tones_, which is the  main point of Impressionist technique. It has the immense advantage of  suppressing all mixtures, of leaving to each colour its proper strength,  and consequently its freshness and brilliancy. At the same time the  difficulties are extreme. The painter's eye must be admirably subtle.  Light becomes the sole subject of the picture; the interest of the  object upon which it plays is secondary. Painting thus conceived becomes  a purely optic art, a search for harmonies, a sort of natural poem,  quite distinct from expression, style and design, which were the  principal aims of former painting. It is almost necessary to invent  another name for this special art which, clearly pictorial though it be,  comes as near to music, as it gets far away from literature and  psychology. It is only natural that, fascinated by this study, the  Impressionists have almost remained strangers to the painting of  expression, and altogether hostile to historical and symbolist painting.  It is therefore principally in landscape painting that they have  achieved the greatness that is theirs.    Through the application of these principles which I have set forth very  summarily, Claude Monet arrived at painting by means of the infinitely  varied juxtaposition of a quantity of colour spots which dissociate the  tones of the spectrum and draw the forms of objects through the  arabesque of their vibrations. A landscape thus conceived becomes a kind  of symphony, starting from one theme (the most luminous point, _f.i._),  and developing all over the canvas the variations of this theme. This  investigation is added to the habitual preoccupations of the landscapist  study of the character peculiar to the scene, style of the trees or  houses, accentuation of the decorative side--and to the habitual  preoccupations of the figure painter in the portrait. The canvases of  Monet, Renoir and Pissarro have, in consequence of this research, an  absolutely original aspect: their shadows are striped with blue,  rose-madder and green; nothing is opaque or sooty; a light vibration  strikes the eye. Finally, blue and orange predominate, simply because in  these studies--which are more often than not full sunlight  effects--blue is the complementary colour of the orange light of the  sun, and is profusely distributed in the shadows. In these canvases can  be found a vast amount of exact grades of tone, which seem to have been  entirely ignored by the older painters, whose principal concern was  style, and who reduced a landscape to three or four broad tones,  endeavouring only to explain the sentiment inspired by it.    And now I shall have to pass on to the Impressionists' ideas on the  style itself of painting, on Realism.    From the outset it must not be forgotten that Impressionism has been  propagated by men who had all been Realists; that means by a reactionary  movement against classic and romantic painting. This movement, of which  Courbet will always remain the most famous representative, has been  _anti-intellectual_. It has protested against every literary,  psychologic or symbolical element in painting. It has reacted at the  same time against the historical painting of Delaroche and the  mythological painting of the _Ecole de Rome_, with an extreme violence  which appears to us excessive now, but which found its explanation in  the intolerable tediousness or emphasis at which the official painters  had arrived. Courbet was a magnificent worker, with rudimentary ideas,  and he endeavoured to exclude even those which he possessed. This  exaggeration which diminishes our admiration for his work and prevents  us from finding in it any emotion but that which results from technical  mastery, was salutary for the development of the art of his successors.  It caused the young painters to turn resolutely towards the aspects of  contemporary life, and to draw style and emotion from their own epoch;  and this intention was right. An artistic tradition is not continued by  imitating the style of the past, but by extracting the immediate  impression of each epoch. That is what the really great masters have  done, and it is the succession of their sincere and profound  observations which constitutes the style of the races.    [Illustration: CLAUDE MONET    THE PINES]    Manet and his friends drew all their strength from this idea. Much finer  and more learned than a man like Courbet, they saw an aspect of  modernity far more complex, and less limited to immediate and grossly  superficial realism. Nor must it be forgotten that they were  contemporaries of the realistic, anti-romantic literary movement, a  movement which gave them nothing but friends. Flaubert and the Goncourts  proved that Realism is not the enemy of refined form and of delicate  psychology. The influence of these ideas created first of all Manet and  his friends: the technical evolution (of which we have traced the chief  traits) came only much later to oppose itself to their conceptions.  Impressionism can therefore be defined as a _revolution of pictorial  technique together with an attempt at expressing modernity_. The  reaction against Symbolism and Romanticism happened to coincide with the  reaction against muddy technique.    The Impressionists, whilst occupying themselves with cleansing the  palette of the bitumen of which the Academy made exaggerated use, whilst  also observing nature with a greater love of light, made it their object  to escape in the representation of human beings the laws of _beauty_,  such as were taught by the School. And on this point one might apply to  them all that one knows of the ideas of the Goncourts and Flaubert, and  later of Zola, in the domain of the novel. They were moved by the same  ideas; to speak of the one group is to speak of the other. The longing  for truth, the horror of emphasis and of false idealism which paralysed  the novelist as well as the painter, led the Impressionists to  substitute for _beauty_ a novel notion, that of _character_. To search  for, and to express, the true character of a being or of a site, seemed  to them more significant, more moving, than to search for an exclusive  beauty, based upon rules, and inspired by the Greco-Latin ideal. Like  the Flemings, the Germans, the Spaniards, and in opposition to the  Italians whose influence had conquered all the European academies, the  French Realist-Impressionists, relying upon the qualities of lightness,  sincerity and expressive clearness which are the real merits of their  race, detached themselves from the oppressive and narrow preoccupation  with the"]]]
