Making allowance for the different art medium  that the singing actor must work in, and despite the larger curves of  operatic pose and gesture, Maurel kept astonishingly near to the  characters he assumed. He was Shakespearian; his Falstaff was the most  wonderful I ever saw.\"    [Illustration: VICTOR MAUREL]    And then Iago: \"In the Maurel conception, Othello's Ancient was not  painted black in black--the heart of darkness, but with many nuances,  many gradations. He was economical of gesture, playing on the jealous  Moor as plays a skillfully handled bow upon a finely attuned violin. His  was truly an objective characterization. His Don Giovanni was broadly  designed. He was the aristocrat to the life, courtly, brave, amorous,  intriguing, cruel, superstitious and quick to take offense. In his best  estate, the drinking song was sheer virtuosity. Suffice to add that  Verdi intrusted to him the task of \"originating\" two such widely  sundered roles as Iago and Falstaff. An extraordinary artist!\"    One evening we were discussing the merits of various famous singers of  the past and present. My friend is an authority whose opinion I greatly  respect. He is not only a singer himself but is rapidly becoming a  singing master of renown.    After we had conferred for a long time, my friend summed it all up with  the remark:    \"You know who, in my opinion, is the greatest, the dean of them all, a  past master of the art of song--Victor Maurel.\"    Did I not know! In times gone by had we not discussed by the hour every  phase of Maurel's mastery of voice and action? Did we not together  listen to that voice and watch with breathless interest his investiture  of Don Giovanni, in the golden days when Lilli Lehmann and the De  Reszkes took the other parts. Was there ever a more elegant courtly Don,  a greater Falstaff, a more intriguing Iago?    In those youthful days, my friend's greatest ambition was to be able to  sing and act like Maurel. To this end he labored unceasingly. Second  only to this aim was another--to know the great baritone personally, to  become his friend, to discuss the finest issues of art with him, to  consult him and have the benefit of his experience. The consummation of  this desire has been delayed for years, but it is one of the \"all  things\" which will surely come to him who waits. Maurel is now once more  on American soil, and doubtless intends remaining for a considerable  period. My friend is also established in the metropolis. The two have  met, not only once but many times--indeed they have become fast friends.    \"I will take you to him,\" promised friend Jacque,--knowing my desire to  meet the \"grand old man\"; \"but don't ask for too many of his opinions  about singers, as he does not care to be quoted.\"    Late one afternoon we arrived at his residence. At the moment he was in  his music room, where, for the last hour he had been singing  _Falstaff_! If we could only have been hidden away in some quiet corner  to listen! He came running down the stairway with almost the agility of  a boy, coming to meet us with simple dignity and courtesy. After the  first greetings were over we begged permission to examine the many  paintings which met the eye everywhere. There was a large panel facing  us, representing a tall transparent vase, holding a careless bunch of  summer flowers, very artistically handled. Near it hung an out-of-door  sketch, a garden path leading into the green. Other bits of landscape  still-life and portraits made up the collection. They had all been  painted by the same artist--none other than Maurel himself. As we  examined the flower panel, he came and stood by us.    \"Painting is a great art,\" he said; \"an art which requires profound  study. I have been a close student of this art for many years and love  it more and more.\"    \"M. Maurel aims now to express himself through the art of color and  form, as he has always done through voice and gesture,\" remarked my  friend.    \"Art is the highest means of expression,\" went on the master, \"whether  through music, painting, sculpture, architecture or the theater. The  effort to express myself through another art-medium, painting, has long  been a joy to me. I have studied with no teacher but myself, but I have  learned from all the great masters; they have taught me everything.\"    He then led the way to his music room on the floor above. Here were more  paintings, many rare pieces of furniture and his piano. A fine portrait  of Verdi, with an affectionate autograph, stood on a table; one of  Ambroise Thomas, likewise inscribed, hung near. \"A serious man, almost  austere,\" said Maurel, regarding the portrait of Verdi thoughtfully,  \"but one of the greatest masters of all time.\"    Praying us to be seated, he placed himself on an ottoman before us. The  talk easily drifted into the subject of the modern operatic stage, and  modern operas of the Italian school, in which one is so often tempted to  shout rather than sing. The hero of Mozart's Don Giovanni, who could  sing his music as perhaps no one else has ever done, would not be likely  to have much patience with the modern style of explosive vocal  utterance.    \"How do you preserve your voice and your repertoire?\" I questioned.    M. Maurel gazed before him thoughtfully.    \"It is entirely through the mind that I keep both. I know so exactly  how to produce tone qualities, that if I recall those sensations which  accompany tone production, I can induce them at will. How do we make  tones, sing an aria, impersonate a role? Is not all done with the mind,  with thought? I must think the tone before I produce it--before I sing  it; I must mentally visualize the character and determine how I will  represent it, before I attempt it. I must identify myself with the  character I am to portray before I can make it _live_. Does not then all  come from thinking--from thought?    \"Again: I can think out the character and make a mental picture of it  for myself, but how shall I project it for others to see? I have to  convince myself first that I am that character--I must identify myself  with it; then I must convince those who hear me that I am really that  character.\" Maurel rose and moved to the center of the room.    \"I am to represent some character--Amonasro, let us say. I must present  the captive King, bound with chains and brought before his captors. I  must feel with him, if I am really going to represent him. I must  believe myself bound and a prisoner; then I must, through pose and  action, through expression of face, gesture, voice, everything--I must  make this character real to the audience.\"    And as we looked, he assumed the pose of the man in chains, his hands  seemed tied, his body bent, his expression one in which anger and  revenge mingled; in effect, he was for the moment Amonasro.    \"I have only made you see my mental concept of Amonasro. If I have once  thoroughly worked out a conception, made it my own, then it is mine. I  can create it at any moment. If I feel well and strong I can sing the  part now in the same way as I have always sung it, because my thought is  the same and thought produces. Whether I have a little more voice, or  less voice, what does it matter? I can never lose my conception of a  character, for it is in my mind, and mind projects it. So there is no  reason to lose the voice, for that also is in mind and can be thought  out at will.    \"Suppose I have an opposite character to portray,--the elegant Don  Giovanni, for example\"; and drawing himself up and wrapping an imaginary  cloak about him, with the old well-remembered courtly gesture, his face  and manner were instantly transformed at the thought of his favorite  character. He turned and smiled on us, his strong features lighted, and  his whole appearance expressed the embodiment of Mozart's hero.    \"You see I must have lived, so to say, in these characters and made them  my own, or I could not recall them at a moment's notice. All  impersonation, to be artistic, to be vital, must be a part of one's  self; one must get into the character. When I sing Iago I am no longer  myself--I am another person altogether; self is quite forgotten; I am  Iago, for the time being.    \"In Paris, at the Sorbonne, I gave a series of lectures; the first was  on this very subject, the identification of one's self with the  character to be portrayed. The large audience of about fifteen hundred,  contained some of the most famous among artists and men of letters\"; and  Maurel, with hands clasped about his knee, gazed before him into space,  and we knew he was picturing in mental vision, the scene at the  Sorbonne, which he had just recalled.    After a moment, he resumed. \"The singer, though trying to act out the  character he assumes, must not forget to _sing_. The combination of fine  singing and fine acting is rare. Nowadays people think if they can act,  that atones for inartistic singing; then they yield to the temptation  to shout, to make harsh tones, simply for effect.\" And the famous  baritone caricatured some of the sounds he had recently heard at an  operatic performance with such gusto, that a member of the household  came running in from an adjoining room, thinking there must have been an  accident and the master of the house was calling for help. He hastily  assured her all was well--no one was hurt; then we all had a hearty  laugh over the little incident.    And now we begged to be allowed to visit the atelier, where the  versatile artist worked out his pictures. He protested that it was in  disorder, that he would not dare to take us up, and so on. After a  little he yielded to persuasion, saying, however, he would go up first  and arrange the room a little. As soon as he had left us my friend  turned to me:    \"What a remarkable man!

THE SMOOTHING CUT (LARGE SKEW).    FIG. 6. Lay the skew chisel on the rest with the cutting edge above the  cylinder and at an angle of about 60 deg. to the surface.    Slowly draw the chisel back and at the same time raise the handle until  the chisel begins to cut about 1/4\" to 3/8\" from the heel. The first cut  is begun from 1\" to 2\" from either end and is pushed toward the near  end. Then begin at the first starting point and cut toward the other  end. One should never start at the end to make a cut as there is danger  that the chisel will catch and cause the wood to split or that the  chisel will be torn from the hands.    The first cut takes off the bumps and rings left by the gouge, and takes  the stock down so one can just see where the scraping to size was done.  Then take the last cut and remove all traces of these, leaving the  cylinder perfectly smooth and of the required diameter at each end. Test  the cylinder for accuracy with a straight edge.    [Illustration: Fig. 6.]      4. TESTING FOR SMOOTHNESS. In testing for smoothness place the palm of  the hand, with the fingers extended straight, lightly on the back of the  cylinder opposite the tool rest. This position will avoid any  possibility of the hand being drawn in between the cylinder and the  rest.    [Illustration: Fig. 7.]      5. MEASURING FOR LENGTH (RULE AND PENCIL). FIG. 7. Hold the back edge of  the rule in the left hand and place it on the tool rest so that the  front edge is almost in contact with the revolving cylinder.    With a sharp pencil mark off the required length, starting from the dead  center end. The first mark should be just far enough in on the cylinder  to insure cutting past the point of the dead center. This will leave all  surplus stock at the live center end where it is needed, because, if not  enough stock is left at this end, there is danger of striking the live  center spur with the tool and of injuring the chisel and perhaps the  work.    In case several measurements are to be made, as in some of the following  exercises, the rule should not be moved until all are marked. This will  insure more accurate work than if the rule be changed several times.      6. SQUARING ENDS (SMALL SKEW AND PARTING TOOL). FIG. 8. This operation  is done with the toe or acute angle of the 1/2\" or 1/4\" skew chisel.    Place the chisel square on the tool rest. Swing the handle out from the  cylinder so that the grind, which forms the cutting edge, next to the  stock is perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder. The heel of the  chisel is then tipped slightly from the cylinder in order to give  clearness. Raise the handle and push the toe of the chisel into the  stock about 1/8\" outside the line indicating the end of the cylinder.  Swing the handle still farther from the cylinder and cut a half V. This  will give clearance for the chisel point and will prevent burning.  Continue this operation on both ends until the cylinder is cut to about  3/16\" in diameter.    The remaining 1/8\" is then removed by taking very thin cuts (about  1/32\") holding the chisel as first stated. After each cut is made the  end should be tested for squareness by holding the edge of the chisel  over the end of the cylinder.    [Illustration: Fig. 8.]    This is an easy cut after it is mastered, but is one of the hardest to  learn. Should the operator lose control of the tool and allow any part  other than the point to touch the cylinder, a run or gashing of the  wood will be caused.    In large cylinders where considerable stock has to be cut away in order  to square the ends, time will be saved by sizing the ends down with the  parting tool to within 1/8\" of the desired line, leaving enough stock at  the base of the cuts to still hold the cylinder rigid while cutting on  the ends.    [Illustration: Fig. 9.]    For this operation hold the parting tool on the rest with the cutting  edge parallel to the axis of the cylinder and the lower grind tangent to  the cylinder. Lift the handle and force the cutting edge into the wood;  at the same time push the chisel forward to keep it at the proper  tangency.      7. CUTTING OFF (SMALL SKEW). FIG. 9.    After both ends have been squared cut away stock, at both ends, to leave  just enough to hold the cylinder from separating from the waste ends.    With the chisel held in the right hand in the same position as in  squaring the ends, and the fingers of the left hand around the stock to  catch it, slowly force the point of the chisel into the stock at the  live center end, until it is cut free and the cylinder stops in the  operator's hand. Too much pressure should not be used in this operation  or it will cause the cylinder to twist off instead of being cut, and  will leave a ragged hole in the end.    The dead center end, which has been scored heavily before cutting off at  the live center, is then removed by holding the grind of the chisel flat  on the end of the cylinder. The latter is revolved by hand until the  stock is cut away.      Exercise A-I--2-a. Shoulder Cuts    1. Turn a cylinder to the largest diameter required.    2. Lay off measurements with rule and pencil.    3. With the gouge (where space permits) or the parting tool (in narrow  spaces) rough out surplus stock, keeping 1/16\" away from the lines  indicating shoulders.    4. Caliper to the diameter of the second step.    5. The shoulders are cut down as described in \"Squaring Ends, Step 6,  Straight Cuts.\"    6. The new diameter or step is then trued up with a skew chisel in the  same manner as a cylinder; except that in nearing the shoulder the  chisel is pushed up on the cylinder until the heel, which is the only  part that can be worked into the corner, becomes the cutting point. Fig.  10. In very narrow steps it will be advisable to use the heel entirely  as a cutting point.    In spaces between shoulders, too narrow to permit the use of the skew  chisel, very effective work can be accomplished by slightly tipping the  parting tool sideways to allow a shearing cut to be taken with the  cutting edge.    7. Where several steps are required on the same cylinder, each  successive one is worked out as above described.    Note:--All preliminary steps in working stock to size, laying of  dimensions, etc., in preparation for the exercise in hand, will be  omitted in the following exercises:      Exercise A-I--3-a. Taper Cuts    [Illustration: Fig. 10.]    Calipering for New Diameters. For all diameters on tapers the calipers  should be set 1/16\" larger than the desired measurement in order to  avoid working under size in the finishing cut which removes all caliper  marks.    If the taper runs to the extreme end of the cylinder, as in Plate  A-I--3-a, a parting tool should be used, instead of a gouge, to take off  a very thin shoulder.    If the taper forms an internal angle as in Plate A-I--3-b, a gouge is  used as in Step 2--Sizing Cut--Plate A-I--1-a.    In other cases where tapers connect with straight cylindrical shoulders  it is best to turn the shoulders to size before working the tapers.    In cutting a long straight taper the skew chisel is used, much in the  same manner as in ordinary cylinder work, except that at the start of  each cut the heel must be the cutting point. This will avoid any chance  of the chisel catching and drawing back and thus gouging the wood beyond  the starting point. As soon as the cut is well under way the chisel may  be pushed up on the cylinder so that the cutting point is a little above  the heel. All cuts should be made from the highest point on the cylinder  to the lowest and thus cut across the grain of the wood.    In making the cut, care should be taken to see that the chisel is not  tipped to a greater angle than that of the taper wanted. Should that be  done a hollow, or dished out, taper is sure to be the result instead of  a straight one.      Exercise A-I--4-a. V Cutting    In cutting V's a small skew is almost always used and the cutting is  done with the heel.    Place the chisel square on the tool rest so that the cutting edge is  perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder. Draw the chisel back and  raise the handle so that the heel is driven into the wood, thus scoring  it. This cut should not be too deep or the chisel will burn. This  scoring should be at the exact center of the V cut.    Swing the handle a little to the right and at the same time tip the  chisel so that the grind, which forms the cutting edge, is at an angle  of about 45 deg. with the axis of the cylinder. The handle is then raised at  an angle of 45 deg. bringing the heel down to make a good cut. The chisel is  then swung to the other side and a similar cut is taken. These cuts are  continued, together with the center scoring, until quite close to the  pencil marks. Test the angle before the finishing cut is taken.    It will be found best to have the V slightly greater than 90 deg. at the  base until the final cut is made, at which time it can be trued up.    The V should be tested with the square end of a rule. The cylinder  should not be in motion while testing.    When angles other than 45 deg. are cut, the cutting edge of the chisel  should be tipped so that it is parallel or nearly so to the side of the  cut desired.      A-I--5-a. Concave Cuts    The concave cuts as a rule will give the pupil considerable trouble at  first owing to the fact that the grind, which forms the cutting edge and  which must be held perpendicular to the cylinder at the start, is on the  under side of the tool and cannot be seen. However, as soon as the  correct angle of the tool is located, the cut will be found as easy as  any. Concaves are usually made with a medium sized gouge either the 1/2\"  or 3/4\".    Place the gouge on the rest with the grind or cutting edge well above  the wood. The tool is "]]]
