The light hath shone on thee from the horizon of the sacred  Mount and the spirit of enlightenment hath breathed in the Sinai of thy  heart.

That which beseemeth Me none shall understand, nor can  anyone recount. Verily, I have preserved it in My hidden storehouses and  in the treasuries of My command, as a sign of My loving-kindness unto My  servants and My mercy unto My people.        \"66: O CHILDREN OF THE DIVINE AND INVISIBLE ESSENCE!...\"      O CHILDREN OF THE DIVINE AND INVISIBLE ESSENCE!

Ponder at all times in  your hearts how ye were created. Since We have created you all from one  same substance it is incumbent on you to be even as one soul, to walk with  the same feet, eat with the same mouth and dwell in the same land, that  from your inmost being, by your deeds and actions, the signs of oneness  and the essence of detachment may be made manifest. Such is My counsel to  you, O concourse of light! Heed ye this counsel that ye may obtain the  fruit of holiness from the tree of wondrous glory.        \"69: O YE SONS OF SPIRIT!

PART II--FROM THE PERSIAN          Preamble                  In the Name of the Lord of Utterance, The Mighty.        \"1: O YE PEOPLE THAT HAVE MINDS TO KNOW AND EARS TO HEAR!...\"      O YE PEOPLE THAT HAVE MINDS TO KNOW AND EARS TO HEAR! The first call of  the Beloved is this: O mystic nightingale! Abide not but in the  rose-garden of the spirit. O messenger of the Solomon of love! Seek thou  no shelter except in the Sheba of the well-beloved, and O immortal  phoenix! dwell not save on the mount of faithfulness. Therein is thy  habitation, if on the wings of thy soul thou soarest to the realm of the  infinite and seekest to attain thy goal.        \"2: O SON OF SPIRIT! The bird seeketh its nest; the nightingale the...\"      O SON OF SPIRIT! The bird seeketh its nest; the nightingale the charm of  the rose; whilst those birds, the hearts of men, content with transient  dust, have strayed far from their eternal nest, and with eyes turned  towards the slough of heedlessness are bereft of the glory of the divine  presence. Alas! How strange and pitiful; for a mere cupful, they have  turned away from the billowing seas of the Most High, and remained far  from the most effulgent horizon.        \"3: O FRIEND! In the garden of thy heart plant naught but the...\"      O FRIEND! In the garden of thy heart plant naught but the rose of love,  and from the nightingale of affection and desire loosen not thy hold.  Treasure the companionship of the righteous and eschew all fellowship with  the ungodly.        \"4: O SON OF JUSTICE! Whither can a lover go but to the land of his...\"      O SON OF JUSTICE! Whither can a lover go but to the land of his beloved?  and what seeker findeth rest away from his heart's desire? To the true  lover reunion is life, and separation is death. His breast is void of  patience and his heart hath no peace. A myriad lives he would forsake to  hasten to the abode of his beloved.        \"5: O SON OF DUST! Verily I say unto thee: Of all men the most  negligent...\"      O SON OF DUST! Verily I say unto thee: Of all men the most negligent is he  that disputeth idly and seeketh to advance himself over his brother. Say,  O brethren! Let deeds, not words, be your adorning.        \"6: O SON OF EARTH! Know, verily, the heart wherein the least remnant...\"      O SON OF EARTH! Know, verily, the heart wherein the least remnant of envy  yet lingers, shall never attain My everlasting dominion, nor inhale the  sweet savors of holiness breathing from My kingdom of sanctity.        \"7: O SON OF LOVE! Thou art but one step away from the glorious...\"      O SON OF LOVE! Thou art but one step away from the glorious heights above  and from the celestial tree of love. Take thou one pace and with the next  advance into the immortal realm and enter the pavilion of eternity. Give  ear then to that which hath been revealed by the pen of glory.        \"8: O SON OF GLORY! Be swift in the path of holiness, and enter the...\"      O SON OF GLORY! Be swift in the path of holiness, and enter the heaven of  communion with Me. Cleanse thy heart with the burnish of the spirit, and  hasten to the court of the Most High.        \"9: O FLEETING SHADOW! Pass beyond the baser stages of doubt and rise  to...\"      O FLEETING SHADOW! Pass beyond the baser stages of doubt and rise to the  exalted heights of certainty. Open the eye of truth, that thou mayest  behold the veilless Beauty and exclaim: Hallowed be the Lord, the most  excellent of all creators!        \"10: O SON OF DESIRE! Give ear unto this: Never shall mortal eye  recognize...\"      O SON OF DESIRE! Give ear unto this: Never shall mortal eye recognize the  everlasting Beauty, nor the lifeless heart delight in aught but in the  withered bloom. For like seeketh like, and taketh pleasure in the company  of its kind.        \"11: O SON OF DUST! Blind thine eyes, that thou mayest behold My...\"      O SON OF DUST! Blind thine eyes, that thou mayest behold My beauty; stop  thine ears, that thou mayest hearken unto the sweet melody of My voice;  empty thyself of all learning, that thou mayest partake of My knowledge;  and sanctify thyself from riches, that thou mayest obtain a lasting share  from the ocean of My eternal wealth. Blind thine eyes, that is, to all  save My beauty; stop thine ears to all save My word; empty thyself of all  learning save the knowledge of Me; that with a clear vision, a pure heart  and an attentive ear thou mayest enter the court of My holiness.        \"12: O MAN OF TWO VISIONS! Close one eye and open the other. Close one  to...\"      O MAN OF TWO VISIONS!"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16949"],[0,"Flowers from a Persian Garden and Other Papers (#4)"],[1,"      furnish an example of this in English poetry.\" In the          opening verse of Mesihi's ode, as above transliterated          in European characters, the _redif_ is \"behar,\" or          spring, and the word which precedes it is the true          rhyme-ending. Sir William Jones has made an elegant          paraphrase of this charming ode, in which, however, he          diverges considerably from the original, as will be seen          from his rendering of the first stanza:              Hear how the nightingale, on every spray,            Hails in wild notes the sweet return of May!            The gale, that o'er yon waving almond blows,            The verdant bank with silver blossoms strows;            The smiling season decks each flowery glade--            Be gay; too soon the flowers of spring will fade.    This Turkish poet's maxim, it will be observed, was \"enjoy the present  day\"--the _carpe diem_ of Horace, the genial old pagan. On the same  suggestive theme of Springtide a celebrated Turkish poetess, Fitnet  Khanim (for the Ottoman Turks have poetesses of considerable genius as  well as poets), has composed a pleasing ode, addressed to her lord, of  which the following stanzas are also from Mr. Gibb's collection:      The fresh spring-clouds across all earth their glistening pearls        profuse now sow;    The flowers, too, all appearing, forth the radiance of their beauty        show;    Of mirth and joy 'tis now the time, the hour, to wander to and fro;    The palm-tree o'er the fair ones' pic-nic gay its grateful shade        doth throw.      _O Liege, come forth! From end to end with verdure doth the whole        earth glow;    'Tis springtide once again, once more the tulips and the roses blow!_      Behold the roses, how they shine, e'en like the cheeks of maids        most fair;    The fresh-sprung hyacinth shows like to beauties' dark, sweet, musky        hair;    The loved one's form behold, like cypress which the streamlet's bank        doth bear;    In sooth, each side for soul and heart doth some delightful joy        prepare.      _O Liege, come forth! From end to end with verdure doth the whole        earth glow;    'Tis springtide once again, once more the tulips and the roses blow!_      The parterre's flowers have all bloomed forth, the roses, sweetly        smiling, shine;    On every side lorn nightingales, in plaintive notes discerning, pine.    How fair carnation and wallflower the borders of the garden line!    The long-haired hyacinth and jasmine both around the cypress twine.      _O Liege, come forth! From end to end with verdure doth the whole        earth glow;    'Tis springtide once again, once more the tulips and the roses blow!_    I cannot resist the temptation to cite, in concluding this introductory  paper, another fine eulogy of the delights of spring, by Amir Khusru, of  Delhi (14th century), from his _Mihra-i-Iskandar_, which has been thus  rendered into rhythmical prose:    \"A day in spring, when all the world a pleasing picture seemed; the sun  at early dawn with happy auspices arose. The earth was bathed in balmy  dew; the beauties of the garden their charms displayed, the face of each  with brilliancy adorned. The flowers in freshness bloomed; the lamp of  the rose acquired lustre from the breeze; the tulip brought a cup from  paradise; the rose-bower shed the sweets of Eden; beneath its folds the  musky buds remained, like a musky amulet on the neck of Beauty. The  violet bent its head; the fold of the bud was closer pressed; the opened  rose in splendour glowed, and attracted every eye; the lovely flowers  oppressed with dew in tremulous motion waved. The air o'er all the  garden a silvery radiance threw, and o'er the flowers the breezes  played; on every branch the birds attuned their notes, and every bower  with warblings sweet was filled, so sweet, they stole the senses. The  early nightingale poured forth its song, that gives a zest to those who  quaff the morning goblet. From the turtle's soft cooings love seized  each bird that skimmed the air.\"          II    STORIES FROM THE \"GULISTAN.\"      The _Gulistan_ consists of short tales and anecdotes, to which are  appended comments in prose and verse, and is divided into eight  chapters, or sections: (1) the Morals of Kings; (2) the Morals of  Dervishes; (3) the Excellence of Contentment; (4) the Advantages of  Taciturnity; (5) Love and Youth; (6) Imbecility and Old Age; (7) the  Effects of Education; (8) Rules for the Conduct of Life. In culling some  of the choicest flowers of this perennial Garden, the particular order  observed by Saadi need not be regarded here; it is preferable to pick  here a flower and there a flower, as fancy may direct.           *       *       *       *       *    It may happen, says our author, that the prudent counsel of an  enlightened sage does not succeed; and it may chance that an unskilful  boy inadvertently hits the mark with his arrow: A Persian king, while on  a pleasure excursion with a number of his courtiers at Nassala Shiraz,  appointed an archery competition for the amusement of himself and his  friends. He caused a gold ring, set with a valuable gem, to be fixed on  the dome of Asad, and it was announced that whosoever should send an  arrow through the ring should obtain it as a reward of his skill. The  four hundred skilled archers forming the royal body-guard each shot at  the ring without success. It chanced that a boy on a neighbouring  house-top was at the same time diverting himself with a little bow, when  one of his arrows, shot at random, went through the ring. The boy,  having obtained the prize, immediately burned his bow, shrewdly  observing that he did so in order that the reputation of this feat  should never be impaired.    The advantage of abstinence, or rather, great moderation in eating and  drinking, is thus curiously illustrated: Two dervishes travelled  together; one was a robust man, who regularly ate three meals every day,  the other was infirm of body, and accustomed to fast frequently for two  days in succession. On their reaching the gate of a certain town, they  were arrested on suspicion of being spies, and both lodged, without  food, in the same prison, the door of which was then securely locked.  Several days after, the unlucky dervishes were found to be quite  innocent of the crime imputed to them, and on opening the door of the  prison the strong man was discovered to be dead, and the infirm man  still alive. At this circumstance the officers of justice marvelled; but  a philosopher observed, that had the contrary happened it would have  been more wonderful, since the one who died had been a great eater, and  consequently was unable to endure the want of food, while the other,  being accustomed to abstinence, had survived.    Of Nushirvan the Just (whom the Greeks called Chosroe), of the Sassanian  dynasty of Persian kings--sixth century--Saadi relates that on one  occasion, while at his hunting-seat, he was having some game dressed,  and ordered a servant to procure some salt from a neighbouring village,  at the same time charging him strictly to pay the full price for it,  otherwise the exaction might become a custom. His courtiers were  surprised at this order, and asked the king what possible harm could  ensue from such a trifle. The good king replied: \"Oppression was brought  into the world from small beginnings, which every new comer increased,  until it has reached the present degree of enormity.\" Upon this Saadi  remarks: \"If the monarch were to eat a single apple from the garden of a  peasant, the servant would pull up the tree by the roots; and if the  king order five eggs to be taken by force, his soldiers will spit a  thousand fowls. The iniquitous tyrant remaineth not, but the curses of  mankind rest on him for ever.\"    Only those who have experienced danger can rightly appreciate the  advantages of safety, and according as a man has become acquainted with  adversity does he recognise the value of prosperity--a sentiment which  Saadi illustrates by the story of a boy who was in a vessel at sea for  the first time, in which were also the king and his officers of state.  The lad was in great fear of being drowned, and made a loud outcry, in  spite of every effort of those around him to soothe him into  tranquility. As his lamentations annoyed the king, a sage who was of the  company offered to quiet the terrified youth, with his majesty's  permission, which being granted, he caused the boy to be plunged several  times in the sea and then drawn up into the ship, after which the youth  retired to a corner and remained perfectly quiet. The king inquired why  the lad had been subjected to such roughness, to which the sage replied:  \"At first he had never experienced the danger of being drowned, neither  had he known the safety of a ship.\"    One of our English moralists has remarked that the man who chiefly  prides himself on his ancestry is like a potato-plant, whose best  qualities are under ground. Saadi tells us of an old Arab who said to  his son: \"O my child, in the day of resurrection they will ask you what  you have done in the world, and not from whom you are descended.\"--In  the _Akhlak-i-Jalaly_, a work comprising the practical philosophy of the  Muhammedans, written, in the 15th century, in the Persian language, by  Fakir Jani Muhammed Asaad, and translated into English by W. F. Thompson,  Ali, the Prophet's cousin, is reported to have said:      My soul is my father, my title my worth;    A Persian or Arab, there's little between:    Give me him for a comrade, whatever his birth,    Who shows what _he is_--not what _others have been_.    An Arabian poet says:      Be the son of whom thou wilt, try to acquire literature,    The acquisition of which may make pedigree unnecessary to thee;    Since a man of worth is he who can say, \"I am so and so,\"    Not he who can only say, \"My father was so and so.\"   "]]]
