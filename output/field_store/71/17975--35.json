The indications given in our text and the       passages brought together by Schrader, which place Gilzan in       direct connection with Kirruri on one side and with Kurkhi       on the other, oblige us to locate the country in the upper       basin of the Tigris, and I should place it near Bitlis-       tchai, where different forms of the word occur many times on       the map, such as Ghalzan in Ghalzan-dagh; Kharzan, the name       of a caza of the sandjak of Sert; Khizan, the name of a caza       of the sandjak of Bitlis. Girzan-Kilzan would thus be the       Roman province of Arzanene, Ardzn in Armenian, in which the       initial g or h of the ancient name has been replaced in the       process of time by a soft aspirate. Khubushkia or Khutushkia       has been placed by Lenormant to the east of the Upper Zab,       and south of Arapkha, and this identification has been       approved by Schrader and also by Delitzsch; according to the       passages that Schrader himself has cited, it must, however,       have stretched northwards as far as Shatakh-su, meeting       Gilzan at one point of the sandjaks of Van and Hakkiari.         ** Assur-nazir-pal, in going from Kirruri to Kirkhi in the       basin of the Tigris, could go either by the pass of Bitlis       or that of Sassun; that of Bitlis is excluded by the fact       that it lies in Kirruri, and Kirruri is not mentioned in       what follows. But if the route chosen was by the pass of       Sassun, Khulun necessarily must have occupied a position at       the entrance of the defiles, perhaps that of the present       town of Khorukh. The name Khatu recalls that of the Khoith       tribe which the Armenian historians mention as in this       locality. Khaturu is perhaps Hatera in the caza of Lidjo, in       the sandjak of Diarbekir, and Arzania the ancient Arzan,       Arzn, the ruins of which may be seen near Sheikh-Yunus.       Tila-Tela is not the same town as the Tela in Mesopotamia,       which we shall have occasion to speak of later, but is       probably to be identified with Til or Tilleh, at the       confluence of the Tigris and the Bohtan-tcha. Finally, it is       possible that the name Khalua may be preserved in that of       Halewi, which Layard gives as belonging to a village       situated almost halfway between Rundvan and Til.         *** Nishtun was probably the most important spot in this       region: from its position on the list, between Khulun and       Khataru on one side and Arzania on the other, it is evident       we must look for it somewhere in Sassun or in the direction       of Mayafarrikin.    [Illustration: 021.jpg THE CAMPAIGNS OF ASSUR-NAZIR-PAL IN NAIRI]    In a small town near one of the sources of the Tigris, Assur-nazir-pal  founded a colony on which he imposed his name; he left there a statue  of himself, with an inscription celebrating his exploits carved on its  base, and having done this, he returned to Nineveh laden with booty.    [Illustration: 022.jpg THE SITE OF SHADIKANNI AT ARBAN, ON THE KHABUR]         Drawn by Boudier, from a sketch taken by Layard.      A few weeks had sufficed for him to complete, on this side, the work  bequeathed to him by his father, and to open up the neighbourhood of the  northeast provinces; he was not long in setting out afresh, this time to  the north-west, in the direction of the Taurus.*         * The text of the \"Annals\" declares that these events took       place \"in this same limmu,\" in what the king calls higher up       in the column \"the beginning of my royalty, the first year       of my reign.\" We must therefore suppose that he ascended the       throne almost at the beginning of the year, since he was       able to make two campaigns under the same eponym.    He rapidly skirted the left bank of the Tigris, burned some score of  scattered hamlets at the foot of Nipur and Pazatu,* crossed to the right  bank, above Amidi, and, as he approached the Euphrates, received  the voluntary homage of Kummukh and the Mushku.** But while he was  complacently engaged in recording the amount of vessels of bronze, oxen,  sheep, and jars of wine which represented their tribute, a messenger of  bad tidings appeared before him. Assyria was bounded on the east by a  line of small states, comprising the Katna*** and the Bit-Khalupi,****  whose towns, placed alternately like sentries on each side the Khabur,  protected her from the incursions of the Bedawin.         * Nipur or Nibur is the Nibaros of Strabo. If we consider       the general direction of the campaign, we are inclined to       place Nipur close to the bank of the Tigris, east of the       regions traversed in the preceding campaign, and to identify       it, as also Pazatu, with the group of high hills called at       the present day the Ashit-dagh, between the Kharzan-su and       the Batman-tchai.         ** The Mushku (Moschiano or Meshek) mentioned here do not       represent the main body of the tribe, established in       Cappadocia; they are the descendants of such of the Mushku       as had crossed the Euphrates and contested the possession of       the regions of Kashiari with the Assyrians.         *** The name has been read sometimes Katna, sometimes Shuna.       The country included the two towns of Kamani and Dur-       Katlimi, and on the south adjoined Bit-Khalupi; this       identifies it with the districts of Magada and Sheddadiyeh,       and, judging by the information with which Assur-nazir-pal       himself furnishes us, it is not impossible that Dur-Katline       may have been on the site of the present Magarda, and Kamani       on that of Sheddadiyeh. Ancient ruins have been pointed out       on both these spots.         **** Suru, the capital of Bit-Khalupi, was built upon the       Khabur itself where it is navigable, for Assur-nazir-pal       relates further on that he had his royal barge built there       at the time of the cruise which he undertook on the       Euphrates in the VIth year of his reign. The itineraries of       modern travellers mention a place called es-Sauar or es-       Saur, eight hours' march from the mouth of the Khabur on the       right bank of the river, situated at the foot of a hill some       220 feet high; the ruins of a fortified enclosure and of an       ancient town are still visible. Following Tomkins, I should       there place Suru, the chief town of Khalupi; Bit-Khalupi       would be the territory in the neighbourhood of es-Saur.    [Illustration: 024.jpg ONE OF THE WINGED BULLS FOUND AT ARBAN]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a sketch by Layard.    They were virtually Chaldaean cities, having been, like most of those  which flourished in the Mesopotamian plains, thoroughly impregnated  with Babylonian civilisation. Shadikanni, the most important of them,  commanded the right bank of the Khabur, and also the ford where the road  from Nineveh crossed the river on the route to Harian and Carche-mish.  The palaces of its rulers were decorated with winged bulls, lions,  stelae, and bas-reliefs carved in marble brought from the hills of  Singar. The people seem to have been of a capricious temperament, and,  nothwithstanding the supervision to which they were subjected, few  reigns elapsed in which it was not necessary to put down a rebellion  among them. Bit-Khalupi and its capital Suru had thrown off the Assyrian  yoke after the death of Tukulti-ninip; the populace, stirred up no doubt  by Aramaean emissaries, had assassinated the Harnathite who governed  them, and had sent for a certain Akhiababa, a man of base extraction  from Bit-Adini, whom they had proclaimed king. This defection, if not  promptly dealt with, was likely to entail serious consequences, since it  left an important point on the frontier exposed: and there now remained  nothing to prevent the people of Adini or their allies from spreading  over the country between the Khabur and the Tigris, and even pushing  forward their marauding bands as far as the very walls of Singar and  Assur.    [Illustration: 024b.jpg NO. 1. ENAMELED BRICK (NIMROD). NO. 2. FRAGMENT  OF MURAL PAINTING (NIMROD).]      [Illustration: 025.jpg STELE FROM ARBAN]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from Layard's sketch    Without losing a moment, Assur-nazir-pal marched down the course of the  Khabur, hastily collecting the tribute of the cities through which he  passed. The defenders of Sura were disconcerted by his sudden appearance  before their town, and their rulers came out and prostrated themselves  at the king's feet: \"Dost thou desire it? it is life for us;--dost thou  desire it? it is death;--dost thou desire it? what thy heart chooseth,  that do to us!\" But the appeal to his clemency was in vain; the alarm  had been so great and the danger so pressing, that Assur-nazir-pal was  pitiless. The town was handed over to the soldiery, all the treasure  it contained was confiscated, and the women and children of the best  families were made slaves; some of the ringleaders paid the penalty of  their revolt on the spot; the rest, with Akhiabaha, were carried away  and flayed alive, some at Nineveh, some elsewhere. An Assyrian garrison  was installed in the citadel, and an ordinary governor, Azilu by name,  replaced the dynasty of native princes. The report of this terrible  retribution induced the Laqi* to tender their submission, and their  example was followed by Khaian, king of Khindanu on the Euphrates.  He bought off the Assyrians with gold, silver, lead, precious  stones, deep-hued purple, and dromedaries; he erected a statue of  Assur-nazir-pal in the centre of his palace as a sign of his vassalage,  and built into the wall near the gates of his town an inscription  dedicated to the gods of the conqueror.         * The Laqi were situated on both banks of the Euphrates,       principally on the right bank, between the Khabur and the       Balikh, interspersed among the Sukhi, of whom"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17328"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 8 (of 12) (#4)"],[1,"given way at  first before the invaders, and had grouped themselves in the eastern  plain round Kition; they had, however, subsequently assumed the  offensive, and endeavoured to regain the territory they had lost.  Kition, which had been destroyed in one of their wars, had been rebuilt,  and thus obtained the name of Qart-hadshat, \"the new city.\"*         * The name of this city, at first read as Amtikhadashti, and       identified with Ammokhostos or with Amathous,--_Amti-       Khadash_ would in this case be equivalent to _New       Amathous_,--is really Karti-Khadashti, as is proved by the       variant reading discovered by Schrader, and this is       identical with the native name of Carthage in Africa. This       new city must have been of some antiquity by the time of       Elulai, for it is mentioned on a fragment of a bronze vase       found in Cyprus itself: this fragment belonged to a King       Hiram, who according to some authorities would be Hiram II.,       according to others, Hiram I.    Mutton's successor, Elulai, continued, as we know, the work of defence  and conquest: perhaps it was with a view to checking his advance that  seven kings of Cyprus sent an embassy, in 709 B.C., to his suzerain,  Sargon, and placed themselves under the protection of Assyria. If this  was actually the case, and Elulai was compelled to suspend hostilities  against these hereditary foes, one can understand that this grievance,  added to the reasons for uneasiness inspired by the situation of his  continental dominions, may have given him the desire to rid himself of  the yoke of Assyria, and contributed to his resolution to ally himself  with the powers which were taking up arms against her. The constant  intercourse of his subjects with the Delta, and his natural anxiety to  avoid anything which might close one of the richest markets of the world  to the Tyrian trade, inclined him to receive favourably the overtures of  the Pharaoh: the emissaries of Shabitoku found him as much disposed  as Hezekiah himself to begin the struggle. The latter monarch, who  had ascended the throne while still very young, had at first shown no  ambition beyond the carrying out of religious reforms. His father Ahaz  had been far from orthodox, in spite of the influence exerted over him  by Isaiah. During his visit to Tiglath-pileser at Damascus (729 B.C.) he  had noticed an altar whose design pleased him. He sent a description  of it to the high priest Urijah, with orders to have a similar one  constructed, and erected in the court of the temple at Jerusalem: this  altar he appropriated to his personal use, and caused the priests to  minister at it, instead of at the old altar, which he relegated to an  inferior position. He also effected changes in the temple furniture,  which doubtless appeared to him old-fashioned in comparison with the  splendours of the Assyrian worship which he had witnessed, and he made  some alterations in the approaches to the temple, wishing, as far as we  can judge, that the King of Judah should henceforth, like his brother of  Nineveh, have a private, means of access to his national god.    This was but the least of his offences: for had he not offered his own  son as a holocaust at the moment he felt himself most menaced by the  league of Israel and Damascus? Among the people themselves there were  many faint-hearted and faithless, who, doubting the power of the God of  their forefathers, turned aside to the gods of the neighbouring nations,  and besought from them the succour they despaired of receiving from any  other source; the worship of Jahveh was confounded with that of Moloch  in the valley of the children of Hinnom, where there was a sanctuary or  Tophet, at which the people celebrated the most horrible rites: a large  and fierce pyre was kept continually burning there, to consume the  children whose fathers brought them to offer in sacrifice.* Isaiah  complains bitterly of these unbelievers who profaned the land with their  idols, \"worshipping the work of their own hands, that which their own  fingers had made.\"** The new king, obedient to the divine command,  renounced the errors of his father; he removed the fetishes with which  the superstition of his predecessors had cumbered the temple, and which  they had connected with the worship of Jahveh, and in his zeal even  destroyed the ancient brazen serpent, the Nehushtan, the origin of which  was attributed to Moses.***         * Isa. xxx. 33, where the prophet describes the Tophet       Jahveh's anger is preparing for Assyria.         ** Isa. ii. 8.         *** 2 Kings xviii. 4. I leave the account of this religious       reformation in the place assigned to it in the Bible; other       historians relegate it to a time subsequent to the invasion       of Sennacherib.    On the occasion of the revolt of Yamani, Isaiah counselled Hezekiah to  remain neutral, and this prudence enabled him to look on in security at  the ruin of the Philistines, the hereditary foes of his race. Under his  wise administration the kingdom of Judah, secured against annoyance from  envious neighbours by the protection which Assur freely afforded to its  obedient vassals, and revived by thirty years of peace, rose rapidly  from the rank of secondary importance which it had formerly been content  to occupy. \"Their land was full of silver and gold, neither was there  any end of their treasures; their land also was full of horses, neither  was there any end of their chariots.\"*         * Isa. ii. 7, where the description applies better to the       later years of Ahaz or the reign, of Hezekiah than to the       years preceding the war against Pekah and Rezin.    Now that the kingdom of Israel had been reduced to the condition of an  Assyrian province, it was on Judah and its capital that the hopes of the  whole Hebrew nation were centred.    Tyre and Jerusalem had hitherto formed the extreme outwork of the Syrian  states; they were the only remaining barrier which separated the empires  of Egypt and Assyria, and it was to the interest of the Pharaoh to  purchase their alliance and increase their strength by every means in  his power. Negotiations must have been going on for some time between  the three powers, but up to the time of the death of Sargon and  the return of Merodach-baladan to Babylon their results had been  unimportant, and it was possible that the disasters which had befallen  the Kalda would tend to cool the ardour of the allies. An unforeseen  circumstance opportunely rekindled their zeal, and determined them to  try their fortune.    [Illustration: 023.jpg MAP OF THE CAMPAIGN OF SENNACHERIB IN JUDEA]    The inhabitants of Ekron, dissatisfied with Padi, the chief whom the  Assyrians had set over them, seized his person and sent him in chains to  Hezekiah.*         * The name of the city, written Amgarruna, is really       Akkaron-Ekron.    To accept the present was equivalent to open rebellion, and a  declaration of war against the power of the suzerain. Isaiah, as usual,  wished Judah to rely on Jahveh alone, and preached against alliance  with the Babylonians, for he foresaw that success would merely result in  substituting the Kalda for the Ninevite monarch, and in aggravating the  condition of Judah. \"All that is in thine house,\" he said to Hezekiah,  \"and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall  be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left, saith the Lord. And of thy  sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take  away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the King of Babylon.\"  Hezekiah did not pay much heed to the prediction, for, he reflected,  \"peace and truth shall be in my days,\" and the future troubled him  little.* When the overthrow of Merodach-baladan had taken place, the  prophet still more earnestly urged the people not to incur the vengeance  of Assyria without other help than that of Tyre or Ethiopia, and  Eliakim, son of Hilkiah, spoke in the same strain; but Shebna, the  prefect of the palace, declaimed against this advice, and the latter's  counsel prevailed with his master.**         * 2 Kings xx. 16-19.         ** This follows from the terms in which the prophet compares       the two men (Isa. xxii. 15-25).    Hezekiah agreed to accept the sovereignty over Ekron which its  inhabitants offered to him, but a remnant of prudence kept him from  putting Padi to death, and he contented himself with casting him into  prison. Isaiah, though temporarily out of favour with the king, ceased  not to proclaim aloud in all quarters the will of the Almighty. \"Woe to  the rebellious children, saith the Lord, that take counsel, but not  of Me; and that cover with a covering (form alliances), but not of My  spirit, that they may add sin to sin: that walk to go down into Egypt,  and have not asked at My mouth, to strengthen themselves in the strength  of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt! Therefore shall the  strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust in the shadow of Egypt  your confusion. When your princes shall be at Tanis, and your messengers  shall come to Heracleopolis,* [Heb. Hanes.--Tr.] you shall all be  ashamed of a people that cannot profit you.... For Egypt helpeth in  vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I called her Rahab that sitteth  still.\"* He returned, unwearied and with varying imagery, to his theme,  contrasting the uncertainty and frailty of the expedients of worldly  wisdom urged by the military party, with the steadfast will of Jahveh  and the irresistible authority with which He invests His faithful  servants. \"The Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh,  and not spirit; and when the Lord shall stretch out His hand, both he  that helpeth shall stumble, and he that is holpen shall fall, and they  shall all fail together. For thus saith the Lord unto me, Like as when  the lion growleth, and the young lion over his prey, if a"]]]
