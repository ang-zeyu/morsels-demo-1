[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14969"],[0,"Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex (#4)"],[1," in its  crudest form in the following words: \"It is a female brain in a male  body.\" But we do not know the characteristics of a \"female brain.\" The  substitution of the anatomical for the psychological is as frivolous as  it is unjustified. The tentative explanation by v. Krafft-Ebing seems to  be more precisely formulated than that of Ulrich but does not  essentially differ from it. v. Krafft-Ebing thinks that the bisexual  predisposition gives to the individual male and female brain centers as  well as somatic sexual organs. These centers develop first towards  puberty mostly under the influence of the independent sex glands. We  can, however, say the same of the male and female \"centers\" as of the  male and female brains; and, moreover, we do not even know whether we  can assume for the sexual functions separate brain locations (\"centers\")  such as we may assume for language.    After this discussion, two notions, at all events, persist; first, that  a bisexual predisposition is to be presumed for the inversion also, only  we do not know of what it consists beyond the anatomical formations;  and, second, that we are dealing with disturbances which are experienced  by the sexual impulse during its development.[11]    *The Sexual Object of Inverts.*--The theory of psychic hermaphroditism  presupposed that the sexual object of the inverted is the reverse of the  normal. The inverted man, like the woman, succumbs to the charms  emanating from manly qualities of body and mind; he feels himself like a  woman and seeks a man.    But however true this may be for a great number of inverts, it by no  means indicates the general character of inversion. There is no doubt  that a great part of the male inverted have retained the psychic  character of virility, that proportionately they show but little of the  secondary characters of the other sex, and that they really look for  real feminine psychic features in their sexual object. If that were not  so it would be incomprehensible why masculine prostitution, in offering  itself to inverts, copies in all its exterior, to-day as in antiquity,  the dress and attitudes of woman. This imitation would otherwise be an  insult to the ideal of the inverts. Among the Greeks, where the most  manly men were found among inverts, it is quite obvious that it was not  the masculine character of the boy which kindled the love of man, but it  was his physical resemblance to woman as well as his feminine psychic  qualities, such as shyness, demureness, and the need of instruction and  help. As soon as the boy himself became a man he ceased to be a sexual  object for men and in turn became a lover of boys. The sexual object in  this case as in many others is therefore not of the like sex, but it  unites both sex characters, a compromise between the impulses striving  for the man and for the woman, but firmly conditioned by the masculinity  of body (the genitals).[12]    The conditions in the woman are more definite; here the active inverts,  with special frequency, show the somatic and psychic characters of man  and desire femininity in their sexual object; though even here greater  variation will be found on more intimate investigation.    *The Sexual Aim of Inverts.*--The important fact to bear in mind is that  no uniformity of the sexual aim can be attributed to inversion.  Intercourse per anum in men by no means goes with inversion;  masturbation is just as frequently the exclusive aim; and the limitation  of the sexual aim to mere effusion of feelings is here even more  frequent than in hetero-sexual love. In women, too, the sexual aims of  the inverted are manifold, among which contact with the mucous membrane  of the mouth seems to be preferred.    *Conclusion.*--Though from the material on hand we are by no means in a  position satisfactorily to explain the origin of inversion, we can say  that through this investigation we have obtained an insight which can  become of greater significance to us than the solution of the above  problem. Our attention is called to the fact that we have assumed a too  close connection between the sexual impulse and the sexual object. The  experience gained from the so called abnormal cases teaches us that a  connection exists between the sexual impulse and the sexual object which  we are in danger of overlooking in the uniformity of normal states where  the impulse seems to bring with it the object. We are thus instructed to  separate this connection between the impulse and the object. The sexual  impulse is probably entirely independent of its object and is not  originated by the stimuli proceeding from the object.      B. _The Sexually Immature and Animals as Sexual Objects_    Whereas those sexual inverts whose sexual object does not belong to the  normally adapted sex, appear to the observer as a collective number of  perhaps otherwise normal individuals, the persons who choose for their  sexual object the sexually immature (children) are apparently from the  first sporadic aberrations. Only exceptionally are children the  exclusive sexual objects. They are mostly drawn into this role by a  faint-hearted and impotent individual who makes use of such substitutes,  or when an impulsive urgent desire cannot at the time secure the proper  object. Still it throws some light on the nature of the sexual impulse,  that it should suffer such great variation and depreciation of its  object, a thing which hunger, adhering more energetically to its object,  would allow only in the most extreme cases. The same may be said of  sexual relations with animals--a thing not at all rare among  farmers--where the sexual attraction goes beyond the limits of the  species.    For esthetic reasons one would fain attribute this and other excessive  aberrations of the sexual impulse to the insane, but this cannot be  done. Experience teaches that among the latter no disturbances of the  sexual impulse can be found other than those observed among the sane, or  among whole races and classes. Thus we find with gruesome frequency  sexual abuse of children by teachers and servants merely because they  have the best opportunities for it. The insane present the aforesaid  aberration only in a somewhat intensified form; or what is of special  significance is the fact that the aberration becomes exclusive and takes  the place of the normal sexual gratification.    This very remarkable relation of sexual variations ranging from the  normal to the insane gives material for reflection. It seems to me that  the fact to be explained would show that the impulses of the sexual life  belong to those which even normally are most poorly controlled by the  higher psychic activities. He who is in any way psychically abnormal, be  it in social or ethical conditions, is, according to my experience,  regularly so in his sexual life. But many are abnormal in their sexual  life who in every other respect correspond to the average; they have  followed the human cultural development, but sexuality remained as their  weak point.    As a general result of these discussions we come to see that, under  numerous conditions and among a surprising number of individuals, the  nature and value of the sexual object steps into the background. There  is something else in the sexual impulse which is the essential and  constant.[13]      2. DEVIATION IN REFERENCE TO THE SEXUAL AIM    The union of the genitals in the characteristic act of copulation is  taken as the normal sexual aim. It serves to loosen the sexual tension  and temporarily to quench the sexual desire (gratification analogous to  satisfaction of hunger). Yet even in the most normal sexual process  those additions are distinguishable, the development of which leads to  the aberrations described as _perversions_. Thus certain intermediary  relations to the sexual object connected with copulation, such as  touching and looking, are recognized as preliminary to the sexual aim.  These activities are on the one hand themselves connected with pleasure  and on the other hand they enhance the excitement which persists until  the definite sexual aim is reached. One definite kind of contiguity,  consisting of mutual approximation of the mucous membranes of the lips  in the form of a kiss, has received among the most civilized nations a  sexual value, though the parts of the body concerned do not belong to  the sexual apparatus but form the entrance to the digestive tract. This  therefore supplies the factors which allow us to bring the perversions  into relation with the normal sexual life, and which are available also  for their classification. The perversions are either (_a_) anatomical  _transgressions_ of the bodily regions destined for sexual union, or (_b_)  a _lingering_ at the intermediary relations to the sexual object which  should normally be rapidly passed on the way to the definite sexual aim.      (_a_) _Anatomical Transgression_    *Overestimation of the Sexual Object.*--The psychic estimation in which  the sexual object as a goal of the sexual impulse shares is only in the  rarest cases limited to the genitals; generally it embraces the whole  body and tends to include all sensations emanating from the sexual  object. The same overestimation spreads over the psychic sphere and  manifests itself as a logical blinding (diminished judgment) in the face  of the psychic attainments and perfections of the sexual object, as well  as a blind obedience to the judgments issuing from the latter. The full  faith of love thus becomes an important, if not the primordial source of  authority.[14]    It is this sexual overvaluation, which so ill agrees with the  restriction of the sexual aim to the union of the genitals only, that  assists other parts of the body to participate as sexual aims.[15] In  the development of this most manifold anatomical overestimation there is  an unmistakable desire towards variation, a thing denominated by Hoche  as \"excitemen"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14970"],[0,"Academica (#4)"],[1," assure you I had no sooner  returned to Rome than I renewed my intimacy with my old friends, my books.\"  These gave him real comfort, and his studies seemed to bear richer fruit  than in his days of prosperity[66]. The tenor of all his letters at this  time is the same: see especially the remaining letters to Varro and also to  Sulpicius[67]. The _Partitiones Oratoriae_, the _Paradoxa_, the _Orator_,  and the _Laudatio Catonis_, to which Caesar replied by his _Anticato_, were  all finished within the year. Before the end of the year the _Hortensius_  and the _De Finibus_ had probably both been planned and commenced. Early in  the following year the _Academica_, the history of which I shall trace  elsewhere, was written.    I have now finished the first portion of my task; I have shown Cicero as  the man of letters and the student of philosophy during that portion of his  life which preceded the writing of the _Academica_. Even the evidence I  have produced, which does not include such indirect indications of  philosophical study as might be obtained from the actual philosophical  works of Cicero, is sufficient to justify his boast that at no time had he  been divorced from philosophy[68]. He was entitled to repel the charge made  by some people on the publication of his first book of the later  period--the _Hortensius_--that he was a mere tiro in philosophy, by the  assertion that on the contrary nothing had more occupied his thoughts  throughout the whole of a wonderfully energetic life[69]. Did the scope of  this edition allow it, I should have little difficulty in showing from a  minute survey of his works, and a comparison of them with ancient  authorities, that his knowledge of Greek philosophy was nearly as accurate  as it was extensive. So far as the _Academica_ is concerned, I have had in  my notes an opportunity of defending Cicero's substantial accuracy; of the  success of the defence I must leave the reader to judge. During the  progress of this work I shall have to expose the groundlessness of many  feelings and judgments now current which have contributed to produce a low  estimate of Cicero's philosophical attainments, but there is one piece of  unfairness which I shall have no better opportunity of mentioning than the  present. It is this. Cicero, the philosopher, is made to suffer for the  shortcomings of Cicero the politician. Scholars who have learned to despise  his political weakness, vanity, and irresolution, make haste to depreciate  his achievements in philosophy, without troubling themselves to inquire too  closely into their intrinsic value. I am sorry to be obliged to instance  the illustrious Mommsen, who speaks of the _De Legibus_ as \"an oasis in the  desert of this dreary and voluminous writer.\" From political partizanship,  and prejudices based on facts irrelevant to the matter in hand, I beg all  students to free themselves in reading the _Academica_.    II. _The Philosophical Opinions of Cicero_.    In order to define with clearness the position of Cicero as a student of  philosophy, it would be indispensable to enter into a detailed historical  examination of the later Greek schools--the Stoic, Peripatetic, Epicurean  and new Academic. These it would be necessary to know, not merely as they  came from the hands of their founders, but as they existed in Cicero's age;  Stoicism not as Zeno understood it, but as Posidonius and the other pupils  of Panaetius propounded it; not merely the Epicureanism of Epicurus, but  that of Zeno, Phaedrus, Patro, and Xeno; the doctrines taught in the Lyceum  by Cratippus; the new Academicism of Philo as well as that of Arcesilas and  Carneades; the medley of Academicism, Peripateticism, and Stoicism put  forward by Antiochus in the name of the Old Academy. A systematic attempt  to distinguish between the earlier and later forms of doctrine held by  these schools is still a great desideratum. Cicero's statements concerning  any particular school are generally tested by comparing them with the  assertions made by ancient authorities about the earlier representatives of  the school. Should any discrepancy appear, it is at once concluded that  Cicero is in gross error, whereas, in all probability, he is uttering  opinions which would have been recognised as genuine by those who were at  the head of the school in his day. The criticism of Madvig even is not free  from this error, as will be seen from my notes on several passages of the  _Academica_[70]. As my space forbids me to attempt the thorough inquiry I  have indicated as desirable, I can but describe in rough outline the  relation in which Cicero stands to the chief schools.    The two main tasks of the later Greek philosophy were, as Cicero often  insists, the establishment of a criterion such as would suffice to  distinguish the true from the false, and the determination of an ethical  standard[71]. We have in the _Academica_ Cicero's view of the first  problem: that the attainment of any infallible criterion was impossible. To  go more into detail here would be to anticipate the text of the _Lucullus_  as well as my notes. Without further refinements, I may say that Cicero in  this respect was in substantial agreement with the New Academic school, and  in opposition to all other schools. As he himself says, the doctrine that  absolute knowledge is impossible was the one Academic tenet against which  all the other schools were combined[72]. In that which was most  distinctively New Academic, Cicero followed the New Academy.    It is easy to see what there was in such a tenet to attract Cicero. Nothing  was more repulsive to his mind than dogmatism. As an orator, he was  accustomed to hear arguments put forward with equal persuasiveness on both  sides of a case. It seemed to him arrogant to make any proposition with a  conviction of its absolute, indestructible and irrefragable truth. One  requisite of a philosophy with him was that it should avoid this  arrogance[73]. Philosophers of the highest respectability had held the most  opposite opinions on the same subjects. To withhold absolute assent from  all doctrines, while giving a qualified assent to those which seemed most  probable, was the only prudent course[74]. Cicero's temperament also, apart  from his experience as an orator, inclined him to charity and toleration,  and repelled him from the fury of dogmatism. He repeatedly insists that the  diversities of opinion which the most famous intellects display, ought to  lead men to teach one another with all gentleness and meekness[75]. In  positiveness of assertion there seemed to be something reckless and  disgraceful, unworthy of a self-controlled character[76]. Here we have a  touch of feeling thoroughly Roman. Cicero further urges arguments similar  to some put forward by a long series of English thinkers from Milton to  Mill, to show that the free conflict of opinion is necessary to the  progress of philosophy, which was by that very freedom brought rapidly to  maturity in Greece[77]. Wherever authority has loudly raised its voice,  says Cicero, there philosophy has pined. Pythagoras[78] is quoted as a  warning example, and the baneful effects of authority are often  depicted[79]. The true philosophic spirit requires us to find out what can  be said for every view. It is a positive duty to discuss all aspects of  every question, after the example of the Old Academy and Aristotle[80].  Those who demand a dogmatic statement of belief are mere busybodies[81].  The Academics glory in their freedom of judgment. They are not compelled to  defend an opinion whether they will or no, merely because one of their  predecessors has laid it down[82]. So far does Cicero carry this freedom,  that in the fifth book of the _Tusculan Disputations_, he maintains a view  entirely at variance with the whole of the fourth book of the _De Finibus_,  and when the discrepancy is pointed out, refuses to be bound by his former  statements, on the score that he is an Academic and a freeman[83]. \"Modo  hoc, modo illud probabilius videtur[84].\" The Academic sips the best of  every school[85]. He roams in the wide field of philosophy, while the Stoic  dares not stir a foot's breadth away from Chrysippus[86]. The Academic is  only anxious that people should combat his opinions; for he makes it his  sole aim, with Socrates, to rid himself and others of the mists of  error[87]. This spirit is even found in Lucullus the Antiochean[88]. While  professing, however, this philosophic bohemianism, Cicero indignantly  repels the charge that the Academy, though claiming to seek for the truth,  has no truth to follow[89]. The probable is for it the true.    Another consideration which attracted Cicero to these tenets was their  evident adaptability to the purposes of oratory, and the fact that  eloquence was, as he puts it, the child of the Academy[90]. Orators,  politicians, and stylists had ever found their best nourishment in the  teaching of the Academic and Peripatetic masters[91]. The Stoics and  Epicureans cared nothing for power of expression. Again, the Academic  tenets were those with which the common sense of the world could have most  sympathy[92]. The Academy also was the school which had the most  respectable pedigree. Compared with its system, all other philosophies were  plebeian[93]. The philosopher who best preserved the Socratic tradition was  most estimable, _ceteris paribus_, and that man was Carneades[94].    In looking at the second great problem, that of the ethical standard, we  must never forget that it was considered by nearly all the later  philosophers as of overwhelming importance compared with the first.  Philosophy was emphatically defined as the art of conduct (_ars vivendi_).  All speculative and non-ethical doctrines were merely estimable as  supplying a basis on which this practical art could be reared. This is  equally true of the Pyrrhonian scepticism and of the dogmatism of Zeno and"]]]
