But the fatal and grotesque alliance with Panda, which culminated in his  installation as King of the Zulus by Pretorius in 1840, and which was  entirely inconsistent with the attitude hitherto assumed towards the  natives, was the undoing of the trekkers of 1836.    Panda's men as native auxiliaries eager to avenge themselves on the  common enemy Dingaan were all very well in their way. Most of them,  however, belonged to Natal and joined him in the hope of recovering the  tribal lands from which they had been evicted by Chaka and to which they  had a better right than the trekkers.    The Boers now began to reap the harvest of the Panda alliance. They  regarded the new arrivals as intruders, refused to acknowledge their  claims, and finally in August, 1841, decreed their expulsion from Natal.  The location chosen for their settlement was a district in Pondoland in  the possession of a chief under British protection, who already had had  occasion to lodge at Capetown a complaint against the Boers.    The British Government now found it necessary to intervene again in  Natal. A military occupation was announced by proclamation in December,  1841, and 240 men, under the command of an infantry captain named Smith,  were sent up to Durban to give effect to it.    When Smith, after a difficult march along the coast, reached his  destination on May 4, 1842, he pitched his camp on the flat which forms  the base of one of the promontories enclosing the Bay. He at once  lowered the Republican flag flying over the block-house at the Point,  and soon found that 1,500 Boers were occupying Congella on the shore of  the Bay. An attempt to surprise them by night failed disastrously;  Smith's force was reduced to half its strength, and the block-house was  captured by Pretorius.    Smith was now besieged in his camp, and the nearest help that could come  to him was at Grahamstown, five hundred miles away. Thither a gallant  civilian named King, who was one of the pioneers, rode in ten days; and  on June 25, when the little garrison was in extremity, it was relieved  by sea. Pretorius withdrew into the interior, and the Volksraad at  Pietermaritzburg, the capital of the Republic of Natalia, voted the  submission of the Boers. Pending a final settlement it was allowed to  remain in authority over the settlers, but the district around Durban  Bay was at once taken over as British territory. In May, 1843, a year  after the landing of Smith, the Republic of Natalia passed away and  Natal was proclaimed a British Colony.    The final settlement did not come for some time. The Volksraad was  abolished, but the claims of the Boers to the lands upon which they had  squatted were liberally considered. They were, however, dissatisfied  because the rights of Panda's men were also regarded, and many trekked  away across the Drakensberg. Those who remained protested that their  lives and property were insecure in the presence of the natives, and  Pretorius was deputed to go and lay their grievances before the British  Governor at the Cape.    The ill success of his mission provoked him to reprisals, and he  proceeded to stir up trouble in the Orange River Sovereignty, which had  recently been formally proclaimed British Territory. If not actively  loyal it was peaceably disposed until the arrival of Pretorius, who soon  drove out the British Resident and the little garrison of Bloemfontein  and set them on the run as far as Colesberg in the Cape Colony. He was  defeated at Boomplatz in August, 1848, by Sir Harry Smith, a veteran of  the Peninsular War, and British authority was for a time reestablished  over the Sovereignty. The Colonial Office soon however tired of the new  possession and gladly scuttled out in 1854 in order to avoid the task of  reaping the harvest of a clumsy and grotesque policy, which it had  formulated a few years before, of hemming in the _voortrekkers_, who had  settled north of the Orange River, with a barrier of native states set  up for the purpose on the east and west; and which now threatened to  involve it in a quarrel which naturally arose between Moshesh, the  Basuto chief, and the emigrants whom he had been appointed to restrain.    Pretorius retired across the Vaal where he joined Potgieter, who, after  the failure of his attack on Dingaan in 1838, had gone into  Moselekatse's country and had driven him beyond the Limpopo. A Republic  was set up beyond the Vaal which the British Government recognized as  independent in the Zand River Convention of 1852.    Such is in brief the story of the Boers' claim to Natal. They considered  it to be their lawful heritage out of which they had been jockeyed, and  in October, 1899, they seemed to have a chance of recovering it. They  boasted that they would not only win back Pietermaritzburg, which was  named after two leaders of the Great Trek, Pieter Retief and Gert  Maritz, but that they would establish themselves on the shores of the  Indian Ocean. It was not the vainglorious gasconade of a swashbuckler.  Four months after October 11, 1899, when the Boer ultimatum expired, the  British Army was still engaged in endeavouring to drive out the Boers  from British territory, and hardly a rifle had been discharged in the  enemy's country.    Napoleon was in the habit of impressing upon his officers the necessity  of studying past campaigns, both modern and ancient; but those who  anticipated confidently that the Boer War would soon be brought to a  successful close by the British Army were led into their error by the  history of past campaigns. There was, however, one campaign, the War of  Independence in North America, which the discerning might have  recognized as an analogous struggle; but it was overlooked, and the  history of the great European conflicts was established as the leading  authority. The occupation of the populous places and the control of the  means of access to them, which seemed to present few difficulties, meant  the end of the war and the subsequent negotiations as to the amount of  the indemnity or other penalty to be paid by the defeated.    But not only were the necessary preliminary successes deferred far  beyond the expected time of their accomplishment--Bloemfontein was not  occupied until five months, nor Pretoria until eight months had rolled  by since that October dawn when the Boers crossed the frontier into  Natal--but the prospect of the end of the War soon began to recede into  the perspective of infinity: and even now, after an interval of some  years since the peace of Vereeniging, when, like the proportions of some  huge edifice which can be truly comprehended only by the observer who  views it from a distance, the various incidents and phases of the War  begin to assume their relative importance, the difficulty of discovering  some guiding principle which shall reconcile the Great Boer War with  other wars is as great as ever.    Sometimes a cause can be found _a posteriori_ by groping in the dim and  deceptive light cast by an effect: or a process of exhaustion and  elimination may be set up in which the qualities common to each side are  cancelled and the result attributed to the credit balance which will  appear under one of the accounts. We saw for some months a gallant and  well equipped if somewhat amorphous British Army impotently  endeavouring, though in superior numbers, to make headway against an  aggregation of Boer commandos, and checked at various points on an arc  drawn wholly in British territory and extending in a circuit of over 500  miles from Ladysmith in Northern Natal through Stormberg and Colesberg  to Kimberley and Mafeking; and at each extremity of the arc was a  besieged city. Was the military art as taught in Europe founded upon  error, or had the British Army been negligently instructed in it?    Yet no European troops had had so much recent experience of active  service. We had lately fought in the Soudan, in East and West Africa, in  Burmah and on the North-West frontier of India; there was in fact hardly  a year in the preceding decade in which the portals of the temple of a  British Janus would have been closed. Moreover, our fighting had not  been against trained soldiers, but against enemies who like the Boers  were undisciplined, collectively if not individually brave men  patriotically defending their own country. We therefore entered the  arena with experience which no other European Army possessed.        II. PATRIOTISM, DUTY, AND DISCIPLINE.      Many hard things have been said of Patriotism.[6] Dr. Johnson's  definition is well known, and more recently it has been styled the  sublimest form of Selfishness. These, however, are not definitions but  rather criticisms of certain phases of Patriotism, which is closely  allied to Family Affection and, like that sentiment, originates in the  helplessness and the egotism of the Individual.    The weak infant clings to his mother for sustenance, comfort and  protection, and the tender care which is bestowed upon him while his  body and his mind are developing fosters the notion of the subjective  importance of the human unit. Human nature is so constituted that the  Individual is disposed to over-estimate his own consequence and to  regard his own surroundings as superior to the surroundings of all other  persons, and therefore more worthy of recognition, encouragement, and  admiration. As the Child grows in years this sentiment is gradually and  unconsciously modified, but it is never wholly eradicated. The inward  emotion aroused in his heart by parental solicitude becomes partially  altruistic and outward and is transmuted into Gratitude and Love.    The Child emerges into Youth and thence into Manhood, and the area of  his immediate environment is enlarged. He needs further succour and  assistance, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/157"],[0,"Daddy-Long-Legs (#4)"],[1,"any letters in return, and I've been  warned not to bother you with questions, but tell me, Daddy, just this  once--are you awfully old or just a little old?  And are you perfectly  bald or just a little bald?  It is very difficult thinking about you in  the abstract like a theorem in geometry.    Given a tall rich man who hates girls, but is very generous to one  quite impertinent girl, what does he look like?    R.S.V.P.                                                     19th December    Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,    You never answered my question and it was very important.                                   ARE YOU BALD?      I have it planned exactly what you look like--very  satisfactorily--until I reach the top of your head, and then I AM  stuck.  I can't decide whether you have white hair or black hair or  sort of sprinkly grey hair or maybe none at all.    Here is your portrait:    But the problem is, shall I add some hair?    Would you like to know what colour your eyes are?  They're grey, and  your eyebrows stick out like a porch roof (beetling, they're called in  novels), and your mouth is a straight line with a tendency to turn down  at the corners.  Oh, you see, I know!  You're a snappy old thing with a  temper.           (Chapel bell.)                                                     9.45 p.m.    I have a new unbreakable rule:  never, never to study at night no  matter how many written reviews are coming in the morning.  Instead, I  read just plain books--I have to, you know, because there are eighteen  blank years behind me.  You wouldn't believe, Daddy, what an abyss of  ignorance my mind is; I am just realizing the depths myself.  The  things that most girls with a properly assorted family and a home and  friends and a library know by absorption, I have never heard of.  For  example:    I never read Mother Goose or David Copperfield or Ivanhoe or Cinderella  or Blue Beard or Robinson Crusoe or Jane Eyre or Alice in Wonderland or  a word of Rudyard Kipling.  I didn't know that Henry the Eighth was  married more than once or that Shelley was a poet.  I didn't know that  people used to be monkeys and that the Garden of Eden was a beautiful  myth.  I didn't know that R. L. S. stood for Robert Louis Stevenson or  that George Eliot was a lady.  I had never seen a picture of the 'Mona  Lisa' and (it's true but you won't believe it) I had never heard of  Sherlock Holmes.    Now, I know all of these things and a lot of others besides, but you  can see how much I need to catch up.  And oh, but it's fun!  I look  forward all day to evening, and then I put an 'engaged' on the door and  get into my nice red bath robe and furry slippers and pile all the  cushions behind me on the couch, and light the brass student lamp at my  elbow, and read and read and read one book isn't enough.  I have four  going at once.  Just now, they're Tennyson's poems and Vanity Fair and  Kipling's Plain Tales and--don't laugh--Little Women.  I find that I am  the only girl in college who wasn't brought up on Little Women.  I  haven't told anybody though (that WOULD stamp me as queer). I just  quietly went and bought it with $1.12 of my last month's allowance; and  the next time somebody mentions pickled limes, I'll know what she is  talking about!    (Ten o'clock bell.  This is a very interrupted letter.)                                                     Saturday    Sir,    I have the honour to report fresh explorations in the field of  geometry.  On Friday last we abandoned our former works in  parallelopipeds and proceeded to truncated prisms.  We are finding the  road rough and very uphill.                                                     Sunday    The Christmas holidays begin next week and the trunks are up.  The  corridors are so filled up that you can hardly get through, and  everybody is so bubbling over with excitement that studying is getting  left out.  I'm going to have a beautiful time in vacation; there's  another Freshman who lives in Texas staying behind, and we are planning  to take long walks and if there's any ice--learn to skate.  Then there  is still the whole library to be read--and three empty weeks to do it  in!    Goodbye, Daddy, I hope that you are feeling as happy as I am.                                   Yours ever,                                             Judy    PS.  Don't forget to answer my question.  If you don't want the trouble  of writing, have your secretary telegraph.  He can just say:                              Mr. Smith is quite bald,                                        or                               Mr. Smith is not bald,                                        or                             Mr. Smith has white hair.      And you can deduct the twenty-five cents out of my allowance.    Goodbye till January--and a merry Christmas!                                                 Towards the end of                                         the Christmas vacation.                                         Exact date unknown    Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,    Is it snowing where you are?  All the world that I see from my tower is  draped in white and the flakes are coming down as big as pop-corns.  It's late afternoon--the sun is just setting (a cold yellow colour)  behind some colder violet hills, and I am up in my window seat using  the last light to write to you.    Your five gold pieces were a surprise!  I'm not used to receiving  Christmas presents.  You have already given me such lots of  things--everything I have, you know--that I don't quite feel that I  deserve extras.  But I like them just the same.  Do you want to know  what I bought with my money?    I. A silver watch in a leather case to wear on my wrist and get me to  recitations in time.    II.  Matthew Arnold's poems.    III.  A hot water bottle.    IV.  A steamer rug.  (My tower is cold.)    V. Five hundred sheets of yellow manuscript paper.  (I'm going to  commence being an author pretty soon.)    VI.  A dictionary of synonyms.  (To enlarge the author's vocabulary.)    VII.  (I don't much like to confess this last item, but I will.) A pair  of silk stockings.    And now, Daddy, never say I don't tell all!    It was a very low motive, if you must know it, that prompted the silk  stockings.  Julia Pendleton comes into my room to do geometry, and she  sits cross-legged on the couch and wears silk stockings every night.  But just wait--as soon as she gets back from vacation I shall go in and  sit on her couch in my silk stockings.  You see, Daddy, the miserable  creature that I am but at least I'm honest; and you knew already, from  my asylum record, that I wasn't perfect, didn't you?    To recapitulate (that's the way the English instructor begins every  other sentence), I am very much obliged for my seven presents.  I'm  pretending to myself that they came in a box from my family in  California.  The watch is from father, the rug from mother, the hot  water bottle from grandmother who is always worrying for fear I shall  catch cold in this climate--and the yellow paper from my little brother  Harry.  My sister Isabel gave me the silk stockings, and Aunt Susan the  Matthew Arnold poems; Uncle Harry (little Harry is named after him)  gave me the dictionary.  He wanted to send chocolates, but I insisted  on synonyms.    You don't object, do you, to playing the part of a composite family?    And now, shall I tell you about my vacation, or are you only interested  in my education as such?  I hope you appreciate the delicate shade of  meaning in 'as such'. It is the latest addition to my vocabulary.    The girl from Texas is named Leonora Fenton.  (Almost as funny as  Jerusha, isn't it?) I like her, but not so much as Sallie McBride; I  shall never like any one so much as Sallie--except you.  I must always  like you the best of all, because you're my whole family rolled into  one.  Leonora and I and two Sophomores have walked 'cross country every  pleasant day and explored the whole neighbourhood, dressed in short  skirts and knit jackets and caps, and carrying shiny sticks to whack  things with.  Once we walked into town--four miles--and stopped at a  restaurant where the college girls go for dinner.  Broiled lobster (35  cents), and for dessert, buckwheat cakes and maple syrup (15 cents).  Nourishing and cheap.    It was such a lark!  Especially for me, because it was so awfully  different from the asylum--I feel like an escaped convict every time I  leave the campus.  Before I thought, I started to tell the others what  an experience I was having.  The cat was almost out of the bag when I  grabbed it by its tail and pulled it back.  It's awfully hard for me  not to tell everything I know.  I'm a very confiding soul by nature; if  I didn't have you to tell things to, I'd burst.    We had a molasses candy pull last Friday evening, given by the house  matron of Fergussen to the left-behinds in the other halls.  There were  twenty-two of us altogether, Freshmen and Sophomores and juniors and  Seniors all united in amicable accord.  The kitchen is huge, with  copper pots and kettles hanging in rows on the stone wall--the littlest  casserole among them about the size of a wash boiler.  Four hundred  girls live in Fergussen.  The chef, in a white cap and apron, fetched  out twenty-two other white caps and aprons--I can't imagine where he  got so many--and we all turned ourselves into cooks.    It was great fun, though I have seen better candy.  When it was finally  finished, and ourselves and the kitchen and the door-knobs all  thoroughly sticky, we organized a procession and still in our caps and  aprons, each carrying a big fork or spoon or frying pan, we marched  through the empty corridors to the officers' parlour, where  half-a-dozen professors and instructors were passing a tranquil  evening.  We serenaded them with college songs and offered  refreshments.  They accepted politely but dubiously.  We left them  sucking chunks of "]]]
