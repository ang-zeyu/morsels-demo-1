By remembering our kinship with all men,    By well-wishing, friendly speaking and kindly doing,    By cheering the downcast and adding sunshine to daylight,    By welcoming strangers (poor shepherds or wise men),    By keeping the music of the angels' song in this home,      God help us every one to share the blessing of Jesus:    In whose name we keep Christmas:    And in whose words we pray together:      _Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name._    _Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven._    _Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we            forgive our debtors._    _And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil:_    _For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever.            Amen._          A CHRISTMAS PRAYER FOR LONELY FOLKS        Lord God of the solitary,    Look upon me in my loneliness.    Since I may not keep this Christmas in the home,    Send it into my heart.      Let not my sins cloud me in,    But shine through them with forgiveness in the face of the child            Jesus.    Put me in loving remembrance of the lowly lodging in the stable of            Bethlehem,    The sorrows of the blessed Mary, the poverty and exile of the            Prince of Peace.    For His sake, give me a cheerful courage to endure my lot,    And an inward comfort to sweeten it.      Purge my heart from hard and bitter thoughts.    Let no shadow of forgetting come between me and friends far away:    Bless them in their Christmas mirth:    Hedge me in with faithfulness,    That I may not grow unworthy to meet them again.      Give me good work to do,    That I may forget myself and find peace in doing it for Thee.    Though I am poor, send me to carry some gift to those who are            poorer,    Some cheer to those who are more lonely.    Grant me the joy to do a kindness to one of Thy little ones:    Light my Christmas candle at the gladness of an innocent and            grateful heart.      Strange is the path where Thou leadest me:    Let me not doubt Thy wisdom, nor lose Thy hand.    Make me sure that Eternal Love is revealed in Jesus, Thy dear Son,    To save us from sin and solitude and death.    Teach me that I am not alone,    But that many hearts, all round the world,    Join with me through the silence, while I pray in His name:      _Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name._    _Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven._    _Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we            forgive our debtors._    _And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil:_    _For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever.            Amen._           *       *       *       *       *"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14577"],[0,"The Teaching of History (#4)"],[1," shortly after informs the reader that the  second United States Bank was rechartered because the State banks had  suspended specie payments. The student may or may not be curious about  the failure of the first bank to receive a new charter, the operation of  State banks, or why they suspended payment in 1814. If he has been  properly taught, he probably will be, but if the teacher wishes to  discuss these considerations in detail at the next recitation it will be  infinitely better to have the facts contributed by the class than for  the teacher to do the reciting. It is quite possible that the individual  answers to advance questions assigned with such a purpose will be  incomplete, but the interest of the class will be incalculably greater  if they themselves furnish the bulk of the additional matter required.  Collectively the class will usually secure complete answers to  reasonable questions. The teacher has his opportunity in supplying such  important facts as the students fail to find.    Until the student may reasonably be expected to know the books of the  library having to do with his subject, the teacher in giving out an  advance lesson should mention by author and title the books most helpful  in the preparation of assigned questions; otherwise the student in a  perfectly sincere effort to do the work assigned may spend an hour in  search of the proper book.    It may be urged that this search is a valuable experience, but it is  obviously too costly. As the year advances and the pupil learns more and  more about the uses of books and methods of investigation increasingly  less specific instruction as to sources should be given by the teacher.  Early in the year, with four lessons to prepare daily, the pupil cannot  afford an hour simply to search for a book. He needs that hour for  preparation of other work, and if by some fortunate conjunction of  circumstances his other work is not sufficiently exacting to require it,  he cannot hope to appear in history class with a well-prepared lesson  if an hour of his time has been spent in simply looking for a book.    It is frequently worth while to spend a few minutes of the recitation in  characterizing the epoch in which the events of the lesson take place or  in listening to a brief character sketch of the men contributing to  these events. Care should of course be taken that biography does not  usurp the place of history, but it materially adds to the interest of  the recitation if the kings, generals, and statesmen cease to be merely  historical characters and become human beings.      _His acquaintance with the great men and women of history will be  vitalized_    It is needless to say that characterizations of men or epochs should not  be assigned without instruction as to how they should be prepared. In  the case of a great historical character, what is needed for class  purposes is not a biography with the dry facts of birth, marriage,  death, etc. The report should be brief, but bristling with adjectives  supported in each case by at least one fact of the man's life. These may  be selected from his personal appearance, private life, amusements,  education, obstacles overcome, public services, political sagacity, or  military prowess. The sketch may close with a few brief estimates by  biographers or historians of his proper place in history.    If a characterization of a period of history is to be required, the  teacher should explain that such a characterization should be an  exercise in the selection of brief statements of fact reflecting the  ideals, institutions, and conditions of the period being described. From  histories, source books, fiction, and literature, let the student select  facts illustrating such things as the spirit of the laws, conditions at  court, public education, amusements of the people, social progress,  position of religion, etc. A little time spent in characterizing a  period of history and a few of its great men will assist in changing the  recital of the bare facts given in the text to an intelligent  understanding of conditions and a vital discussion of events. For  instance, the ordinary high school text, in dealing with the French and  Indian war, speaks briefly of the lack of English success during the  early part of the struggle and then says that with the coming of Pitt to  the ministry the whole course of events was changed because of the great  statesman's wonderful personality. The teacher who wishes to make such a  dramatic circumstance really vital to his class must have more  information with which to work. A picture of the coarse, vulgar England  with its incompetent army and navy, apathetic church, and corrupt  government, followed by a stirring character sketch of the great Pitt,  will cost but a few minutes of the recitation and will metamorphose a  moribund attention to a vital interest.    Care should be taken that the characterizations given in class be  properly prepared. To this end it will be well to assign the preparation  of these sketches at least a week in advance, at the same time arranging  a conference with the student a day or two before the recitation. In  this conference the teacher should make such corrections in the pupil's  method of preparation and selection of matter as seem necessary. The  characterizations should not be read, but delivered by the student  facing the class, precisely for the moment as though he were the  teacher. Future tests and examinations should hold the class responsible  for the facts thus presented. If, as is too often the case in work of  this sort, the student giving the report is the sole beneficiary of the  exercise, the time required is disproportionate to the benefit derived.      _He will correlate the past and the present_    If there are facts recounted in the lesson that may be clinched in the  student's mind by showing the relation of those facts to present-day  conditions or institutions, a few advance questions calculated to bring  out this relationship may well be assigned.    It is generally conceded that one chief purpose of history instruction  is to enable us to interpret the present and the future in the light of  the past, but it all too often happens that current history is forgotten  in the recital of facts that are centuries old. Candidates for teachers'  certificates in their examinations in United States history show far  less knowledge about the great problems and events of the present day  than they do of colonial history. The student in English history in our  high schools to-day knows all about the Domesday Book, but almost  nothing of the recent history of England. Quite possibly the text has  nothing to say about it, and it is equally likely that the class may  fail to cover the text and miss the little that is actually given. No  opportunity should be missed to indicate the bearing of the past on  present-day conditions. Even if the events of the lesson exert no direct  influence on affairs to-day, their significance may be brought home to  the student by an illustration from current history. The account of the  Black Death gives excellent occasion for a brief discussion of modern  sanitation and the war on the White Plague. The efforts of Parliament to  fix wages can be illustrated by some of the minimum wage laws passed by  recent legislatures. John Ball's teachings suggest a brief discussion of  modern socialism, daily becoming more active in its influence. The  medieval trade guilds and modern labor unions; the monopolies of  Elizabeth's time and the anti-trust law of to-day; George the Third's  two hundred capital crimes and modern methods of penology; the jealousy  of Athens in guarding the privilege of citizenship and the facility with  which immigrants at present become American citizens are only a few  illustrations, indicating the ease with which the past and the present  may be correlated.      _He will be required to memorize a limited amount of matter verbatim_    In assigning a lesson it is sometimes desirable to require certain  matter to be learned _verbatim_. In American history the Preamble to the  Constitution, the principles of government contained in the Declaration  of Independence, the essential doctrine in the Virginia and Kentucky  Resolutions, certain clauses of the Constitution, and extracts from  other historical documents may well be required to be memorized  accurately. It is scarcely to be supposed that the student can improve  on the clarity and definiteness of the English in such documents. He is  expected to understand the principles which they assert. He may well be  required to train his memory to accuracy by learning certain assignments  _verbatim_. If memory work received a little more attention in our high  schools to-day, we should be less likely to hear the statement of a  political creed neutralized by the omission of an important word. We  should be less likely to see the classic words of Lincoln mangled beyond  recognition by messy misquotation.    The assignment of advance questions such as have been suggested  possesses several advantages. It makes it possible for the teacher to  hold the class responsible for definite preparation, very much as the  teacher in algebra is able to do with the problems assigned in advance.  It forces the students to do most of the talking. It encourages an  intelligent use of the library in a manner calculated to develop the  student's powers of investigation. If the pupil forgets most of his  history, but retains the ability to investigate carefully, thoroughly,  and critically, the plan has more than justified itself. The plan  enables the teacher to spend his time in explanation of what the pupil  has been unable to do for herself, and thus effects a considerable  saving in time. It would be interesting to secure a statement of how  much of the teacher's time is ordinarily spent in doing for the student  in recitation what he should have"]]]
