The trumpet, on the other hand,  has retained something of a mystical character even to our  day. The most powerful illustration of this known to me is  in the \"Requiem\" by Berlioz. The effect of those tremendous  trumpet calls from the four corners of the orchestra is an  overwhelming one, of crushing power and majesty, much of which  is due to the rhythm.    To sum up. We may regard rhythm as the intellectual side  of music, melody as its sensuous side. The pipe is the one  instrument that seems to affect animals--hooded cobras,  lizards, fish, etc. Animals' natures are purely sensuous,  therefore the pipe, or to put it more broadly, melody, affects  them. To rhythm, on the other hand, they are indifferent;  it appeals to the intellect, and therefore only to man.    This theory would certainly account for much of the  potency of what we moderns call music. All that aims to be  dramatic, tragic, supernatural in our modern music, derives  its impressiveness directly from rhythm.[01] What would  that shudder of horror in Weber's \"Freischuetz\" be without  that throb of the basses? Merely a diminished chord of the  seventh. Add the pizzicato in the basses and the chord sinks  into something fearsome; one has a sudden choking sensation,  as if one were listening in fear, or as if the heart had  almost stopped beating. All through Wagner's music dramas  this powerful effect is employed, from \"The Flying Dutchman\"  to \"Parsifal.\" Every composer from Beethoven to Nicode has  used the same means to express the same emotions; it is the  medium that pre-historic man first knew; it produced the same  sensation of fear in him that it does in us at the present day.    Rhythm denotes a thought; it is the expression of a  purpose. There is will behind it; its vital part is intention,  power; it is an act. Melody, on the other hand, is an almost  unconscious expression of the senses; it translates feeling  into sound. It is the natural outlet for sensation. In anger  we raise the voice; in sadness we lower it. In talking we  give expression to the emotions in sound. In a sentence in  which fury alternates with sorrow, we have the limits of the  melody of speech. Add to this rhythm, and the very height of  expression is reached; for by it the intellect will dominate  the sensuous.      [01] The strength of the \"Fate\" motive in Beethoven's fifth       symphony undoubtedly lies in the succession of the four       notes at equal intervals of time. Beethoven himself       marked it _So pocht das Schicksal an die Pforte_.          II    ORIGIN OF SONG vs. ORIGIN OF INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC      Emerson characterized language as \"fossil poetry,\" but \"fossil  music\" would have described it even better; for as Darwin says,  man _sang_ before he became human.    Gerber, in his \"Sprache als Kunst,\" describing the degeneration  of sound symbols, says \"the saving point of language is  that the original material meanings of words have become  forgotten or lost in their acquired ideal meaning.\" This  applies with special force to the languages of China, Egypt,  and India. Up to the last two centuries our written music  was held in bondage, was \"fossil music,\" so to speak. Only  certain progressions of sounds were allowed, for religion  controlled music. In the Middle Ages folk song was used by  the Church, and a certain amount of control was exercised  over it; even up to the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries  the use of sharps and flats was frowned upon in church music.  But gradually music began to break loose from its old chains,  and in our own century we see Beethoven snap the last thread  of that powerful restraint which had held it so long.    The vital germ of music, as we know it, lay in the fact that  it had always found a home in the hearts of the common people  of all nations. While from time immemorial theory, mostly in  the form of mathematical problems, was being fought over, and  while laws were being laid down by religions and governments  of all nations as to what music must be and what music was  forbidden to be, the vital spark of the divine art was being  kept alive deep beneath the ashes of life in the hearts of the  oppressed common folk. They still sang as they felt; when the  mood was sad the song mirrored the sorrow; if it were gay the  song echoed it, despite the disputes of philosophers and the  commands of governments and religion. Montaigne, in speaking  of language, said with truth, \"'Tis folly to attempt to fight  custom with theories.\" This folk song, to use a Germanism,  we can hardly take into account at the present moment, though  later we shall see that spark fanned into fire by Beethoven,  and carried by Richard Wagner as a flaming torch through the  very home of the gods, \"Walhalla.\"    Let us go back to our dust heap. Words have been called  \"decayed sentences,\" that is to say, every word was once a  small sentence complete in itself. This theory seems true  enough when we remember that mankind has three languages,  each complementing the other. For even now we say many words  in one, when that word is reinforced and completed by our  vocabulary of sounds and expression, which, in turn, has its  shadow, gesture. These shadow languages, which accompany  all our words, give to the latter vitality and raise them  from mere abstract symbols to living representatives of  the idea. Indeed, in certain languages, this auxiliary  expression even overshadows the spoken word. For instance,  in Chinese, the _theng_ or intonation of words is much more  important than the actual words themselves. Thus the third  intonation or _theng_, as it is called in the Pekin dialect,  is an upward inflection of the voice. A word with this upward  inflection would be unintelligible if given the fourth _theng_  or downward inflection. For instance, the word \"kwai\" with a  downward inflection means \"honourable,\" but give it an upward  inflection \"kwai\" and it means \"devil.\"    Just as a word was originally a sentence, so was a tone in  music something of a melody. One of the first things that  impresses us in studying examples of savage music is the  monotonic nature of the melodies; indeed some of the music  consists almost entirely of one oft-repeated sound. Those  who have heard this music say that the actual effect is not  one of a steady repetition of a single tone, but rather that  there seems to be an almost imperceptible rising and falling  of the voice. The primitive savage is unable to sing a tone  clearly and cleanly, the pitch invariably wavering. From  this almost imperceptible rising and falling of the voice  above and below one tone we are able to gauge more or less the  state of civilization of the nation to which the song belongs.  This phrase-tone corresponds, therefore, to the sentence-word,  and like it, gradually loses its meaning as a phrase and fades  into a tone which, in turn, will be used in new phrases as  mankind mounts the ladder of civilization.    At last then we have a single tone clearly uttered, and  recognizable as a musical tone. We can even make a plausible  guess as to what that tone was. Gardiner, in his \"Music of  Nature,\" tells of experiments he made in order to determine the  normal pitch of the human voice. By going often to the gallery  of the London Stock Exchange he found that the roar of voices  invariably amalgamated into one long note, which was always  F. If we look over the various examples of monotonic savage  music quoted by Fletcher, Fillmore, Baker, Wilkes, Catlin,  and others, we find additional corroboration of the statement;  song after song, it will be noticed, is composed entirely of  F, G, and even F alone or G alone. Such songs are generally  ancient ones, and have been crystallized and held intact by  religion, in much the same way that the chanting heard in the  Roman Catholic service has been preserved.    Let us assume then that the normal tone of the human voice  in speaking is F or G [F: f g] for men, and for women the  octave higher. This tone does very well for our everyday life;  perhaps a pleasant impression may raise it somewhat, _ennui_ may  depress it slightly; but the average tone of our \"commonplace\"  talk, if I may call it that, will be about F. But let some  sudden emotion come, and we find monotone speech abandoned for  impassioned speech, as it has been called. Instead of keeping  the voice evenly on one or two notes, we speak much higher or  lower than our normal pitch.    And these sounds may be measured and classified to a certain  extent according to the emotions which cause them, although  it must be borne in mind that we are looking at the matter  collectively; that is to say, without reckoning on individual  idiosyncrasies of expression in speech. Of course we know that  joy is apt to make us raise the voice and sadness to lower  it. For instance, we have all heard gruesome stories, and  have noticed how naturally the voice sinks in the telling. A  ghost story told with an upward inflection might easily  become humourous, so instinctively do we associate the upward  inflection with a non-pessimistic trend of thought. Under stress  of emotion we emphasize words strongly, and with this emphasis  we almost invariably raise the voice a fifth or depress it a  fifth; with yet stronger emotion the interval of change will  be an octave. We raise the voice almost to a scream or drop it  to a whisper. Strangely enough these primitive notes of music  correspond to the first two of those harmonics which are part  and parcel of every musical sound. Generally speaking, we may  say that the ascending inflection carries something of joy  or hope with it, while the downward inflection has something  of the sinister and fearful. To be sure, we raise our voices  in anger and in pain,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16358"],[0,"The English Gipsies and Their Language (#4)"],[1," dreading fire, but asking for nothing but freedom?    The more I have conversed intimately with Gipsies, the more have I been  struck by the fact, that my mingled experiences of European education and  of life in the Far West of America have given me a basis of mutual  intelligence which had otherwise been utterly wanting.  I, myself, have  known in a wild country what it is to be half-starved for many days--to  feel that all my thoughts and intellectual exertions, hour by hour, were  all becoming centered on one subject--how to get something to eat.  I  felt what it was to be wolfish and even ravening; and I noted, step by  step, in myself, how a strange sagacity grew within me--an art of  detecting food.  It was during the American war, and there were thousands  of us pitifully starved.  When we came near some log hut I began at once  to surmise, if I saw a flour sack lying about, that there was a mill not  far distant; perhaps flour or bread in the house; while the dwellers in  the hut were closely scanned to judge from their appearance if they were  well fed, and of a charitable disposition.  It is a melancholy thing to  recall; but it is absolutely necessary for a thinker to have once lived  such a life, that he may be able to understand what is the intellectual  status of those fellow beings whose whole life is simply a hunt for  enough food to sustain life, and enough beer to cheer it.    I have spoken of the Gipsy fondness for the hedgehog.  Richard Liebich,  in his book, _Die Zigeuner in ihrem Wesen und in ihrer Sprache_, tells  his readers that the only indication of a belief in a future state which  he ever detected in an old Gipsy woman, was that she once dreamed she was  in heaven.  It appeared to her as a large garden, full of fine fat  hedgehogs.  \"This is,\" says Mr Liebich, \"unquestionably very earthly, and  dreamed very sensuously; reminding us of Mahommed's paradise, which in  like manner was directed to the animal and not to the spiritual nature,  only that here were hedgehogs and there houris.\"    Six or seven thousand years of hungry-marauding, end by establishing  strange points of difference between the mind of a Gipsy and a well-to-do  citizen.  It has starved God out of the former; he inherited unbelief  from his half fed Pariah ancestors, and often retains it, even in  England, to this day, with many other unmistakable signs of his Eastern-  jackal origin.  And strange as it may seem to you, reader, his  intercourse with Christians has all over Europe been so limited, that he  seldom really knows what religion is.  The same Mr Liebich tells us that  one day he overheard a Gipsy disputing with his wife as to what was the  true character of the belief of the Gentiles.  Both admitted that there  was a great elder grown up God (the _baro puro dewel_), and a smaller  younger God (the _tikno tarno dewel_).  But the wife maintained,  appealing to Mr Liebich for confirmation, that the great God no longer  reigned, having abdicated in favour of the Son, while the husband  declared that the Great older God died long ago, and that the world was  now governed by the little God who was, however, not the son of his  predecessor, but of a poor carpenter.    I have never heard of any such nonsense among the English wandering  Gipsies with regard to Christianity, but at the same time I must admit  that their ideas of what the Bible contains are extremely vague.  One day  I was sitting with an old Gipsy, discussing Rommany matters, when he  suddenly asked me what the word was in the _waver temmeny jib_, or  foreign Gipsy, for The Seven Stars.    \"That would be,\" I said, \"the _Efta Sirnie_.  I suppose your name for it  is the Hefta Pens.  There is a story that once they were seven sisters,  but one of them was lost, and so they are called seven to this day--though  there are only six.  And their right name is the Pleiades.\"    \"That _gudlo_--that story,\" replied the gipsy, \"is like the one of the  Seven Whistlers, which you know is in the Scriptures.\"    \"What!\"    \"At least they told me so; that the Seven Whistlers are seven spirits of  ladies who fly by night, high in the air, like birds.  And it says in the  Bible that once on a time one got lost, and never came back again, and  now the six whistles to find her.  But people calls 'em the Seven  Whistlers--though there are only six--exactly the same as in your story  of the stars.\"    \"It's queer,\" resumed my Gipsy, after a pause, \"how they always tells  these here stories by Sevens.  Were you ever on Salisbury Plain?\"    \"No!\"    \"There are great stones there--_bori bars_--and many a night I've slept  there in the moonlight, in the open air, when I was a boy, and listened  to my father tellin' me about the Baker.  For there's seven great  stories, and they say that hundreds of years ago a baker used to come  with loaves of bread, and waste it all a tryin' to make seven loaves  remain at the same place, one on each stone.  But one all'us fell off,  and to this here day he's never yet been able to get all seven on the  seven stones.\"    I think that my Gipsy told this story in connection with that of the  Whistlers, because he was under the impression that it also was of  Scriptural origin.  It is, however, really curious that the Gipsy term  for an owlet is the _Maromengro's Chavi_, or Baker's Daughter, and that  they are all familiar with the monkish legend which declares that Jesus,  in a baker's shop, once asked for bread.  The mistress was about to give  him a large cake, when her daughter declared it was too much, and  diminished the gift by one half.             \"He nothing said,     But by the fire laid down the bread,     When lo, as when a blossom blows--     To a vast loaf the manchet rose;     In angry wonder, standing by,     The girl sent forth a wild, rude cry,     And, feathering fast into a fowl,     Flew to the woods a wailing owl.\"    According to Eilert Sundt, who devoted his life to studying the _Fanten  and Tataren_, or vagabonds and Gipsies of Sweden and Norway, there is a  horrible and ghastly semblance among them of something like a religion,  current in Scandinavia.  Once a year, by night, the Gipsies of that  country assemble for the purpose of un-baptizing all of their children  whom they have, during the year, suffered to be baptized for the sake of  gifts, by the Gorgios.  On this occasion, amid wild orgies, they worship  a small idol, which is preserved until the next meeting with the greatest  secresy and care by their captain.  I must declare that this story seems  very doubtful to me.    I have devoted this chapter to illustrating from different points the  fact that there lives in England a race which has given its impress to a  vast proportion of our vagabond population, and which is more curious and  more radically distinct in all its characteristics, than our writers,  with one or two exceptions, have ever understood.  One extraordinary  difference still remains to be pointed out--as it has, in fact, already  been, with great acumen, by Mr George Borrow, in his \"Gipsies in Spain,\"  and by Dr Alexander Paspati, in his \"Etudes sur les Tchinghianes ou  Bohemiens de l'Empire Ottoman\" (Constantinople, 1870); also by Mr Bright,  in his \"Hungary,\" and by Mr Simson.  It is this, that in every part of  the world it is extremely difficult to get Rommany words, even from  intelligent gipsies, although they may be willing with all their heart to  communicate them.  It may seem simple enough to the reader to ask a man  \"How do you call 'to carry' in your language?\"  But can the reader  understand that a man, who is possibly very much shrewder than himself in  reading at a glance many phases of character, and in countless  trickeries, should be literally unable to answer such a question?  And  yet I have met with many such.  The truth is, that there are people in  this world who never had such a thing as an abstract idea, let us say  even of an apple, plumped suddenly at them--not once in all their  lives--and, when it came, the unphilosophical mind could no more grasp  it, than the gentleman mentioned by G. H. Lewes (History of Philosophy),  could grasp the idea of substance without attribute as presented by  Berkeley.  The real Gipsy could talk about apples all day, but the sudden  demand for the unconnected word, staggers him--at least, until he has had  some practice in this, to him, new process.  And it is so with other  races.  Professor Max Muller once told me in conversation, as nearly as I  can recollect, that the Mohawk Indian language is extremely rich in  declension, every noun having some sixteen or seventeen inflexions of  case, but no nominative.  One can express one's relations to a father to  a most extraordinary extent, among the dilapidated descendants of that  once powerful tribe.  But such a thing as the abstract idea of _a_  father, or of 'father' _pur et simple_, never entered the Mohawk mind,  and this is very like the Gipsies.    When a rather wild Gipsy once gives you a word, it must be promptly  recorded, for a demand for its repetition at once confuses him.  _On doit  saisir le mot echappe au Nomade, et ne pas l'obliger a le repeter, car il  le changera selon so, facon_, says Paspati.  Unused to abstract efforts  of memory, all that he can retain is the sense of his last remark, and  very often this is changed with the fleeting second by some associated  thought, which materially modifies it.  It is always difficult, in  consequence, to take down a story in the exact terms which a philologist  desires.  There are two words for \"bad\" in English Gipsy, _wafro_ and  _vessavo_; and I think it must have taken me ten minutes one day to  learn, from a by no means dull gipsy, whether the latter word was known  to him, or if it were used at all.  He got himself into a hopeless tangle  in trying to explain the difference between _wafro_ and _naflo_, or ill,  until his mind finally refused to act on _vessavo_ "]]]
