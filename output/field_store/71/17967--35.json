When the wooers  have withdrawn, Odysseus and Telemachus remove the weapons  from the hall to the armoury. Afterwards Odysseus has an  interview with Penelope (who does not recognise him), but  he is recognised by his old nurse Eurycleia. Penelope  mentions her purpose to wed the man who on the following  day, the feast of the Archer-god Apollo, shall draw the bow  of Odysseus, and send an arrow through the holes in twelve  axe-blades, set up in a row. Thus the poet shows that  Odysseus has arrived in Ithaca not a day too soon. Odysseus  is comforted by a vision of Athene, and      DAY 41 (Books xx, xxi, xxii, xxiii).    by the ominous prayer uttered by a weary woman grinding at  the mill. The swineherd and the disloyal Melanthius arrive  at the palace. The wooers defer the plot to kill  Telemachus, as the day is holy to Apollo. Odysseus is led  up from his seat near the door to a place beside Telemachus  at the chief's table. The wooers mock Telemachus, and the  second-sighted Theoclymenus sees the ominous shroud of  death covering their bodies, and the walls dripping with  blood. He leaves the doomed company. In the trial of the  bow, none of the wooers can draw it; meanwhile Odysseus has  declared himself to the neatherd and the swineherd. The  former bars and fastens the outer gates of the court, the  latter bids Eurycleia bar the doors of the womens' chambers  which lead out of the hall. Odysseus now gets the bow into  his hands, strings it, sends the arrow through the  axe-blades, and then leaping on the threshold of stone,  deals his shafts among the wooers. Telemachus, the  neatherd, and Eumaeus, aiding him, he slaughters all the  crew, despite the treachery of Melanthius. The paramours of  the wooers are hanged, and Odysseus, after some delay, is  recognised by Penelope.      DAY 42 (Books xxiii, xxiv).    This day is occupied with the recognition of Odysseus by  his aged father Laertes, and with the futile attempt of the  kinsfolk of the wooers to avenge them on Odysseus. Athene  reconciles the feud, and the toils of Odysseus are  accomplished.    The reader has now before him a chronologically arranged  sketch of the action of the Odyssey. It is, perhaps,  apparent, even from this bare outline, that the composition  is elaborate and artistic, that the threads of the plot are  skilfully separated and combined. The germ of the whole  epic is probably the popular tale, known all over the  world, of the warrior who, on his return from a long  expedition, has great difficulty in making his prudent wife  recognise him. The incident occurs as a detached story in  China, and in most European countries it is told of a  crusader. 'We may suppose it to be older than the legend of  Troy, and to have gravitated into the cycle of that legend.  The years of the hero's absence are then filled up with  adventures (the Cyclops, Circe, the Phaeacians, the Sirens,  the descent into hell) which exist as scattered tales, or  are woven into the more elaborate epics of Gaels, Aztecs,  Hindoos, Tartars, South-Sea Islanders, Finns, Russians,  Scandinavians, and Eskimo. The whole is surrounded with the  atmosphere of the kingly age of Greece, and the result is  the Odyssey, with that unity of plot and variety of  character which must have been given by one masterly  constructive genius. The date at which the poet of the  Odyssey lived may be approximately determined by his  consistent descriptions of a peculiar and definite  condition of society, which had ceased to exist in the  ninth century B.C., and of a stage of art in which  Phoenician and Assyrian influences predominated. (Die Kunst  bei Homer. Brunn.) As to the mode of composition, it would  not be difficult to show that at least the a priori Wolfian  arguments against the early use of writing for literary  purposes have no longer the cogency which they were once  thought to possess. But this is matter for a separate  investigation.            The Odyssey        Book I      In a Council of the Gods, Poseidon absent, Pallas procureth    an order for the restitution of Odysseus; and appearing to    his son Telemachus, in human shape, adviseth him to    complain of the Wooers before the Council of the people,    and then go to Pylos and Sparta to inquire about his    father.    Tell me, Muse, of that man, so ready at need, who wandered  far and wide, after he had sacked the sacred citadel of  Troy, and many were the men whose towns he saw and whose  mind he learnt, yea, and many the woes he suffered in his  heart upon the deep, striving to win his own life and the  return of his company.  Nay, but even so he saved not his  company, though he desired it sore. For through the  blindness of their own hearts they perished, fools, who  devoured the oxen of Helios Hyperion: but the god took from  them their day of returning. Of these things, goddess,  daughter of Zeus, whencesoever thou hast heard thereof,  declare thou even unto us.    Now all the rest, as many as fled from sheer destruction,  were at home, and had escaped both war and sea, but  Odysseus only, craving for his wife and for his homeward  path, the lady nymph Calypso held, that fair goddess, in  her hollow caves, longing to have him for her lord. But  when now the year had come in the courses of the seasons,  wherein the gods had ordained that he should return home to  Ithaca, not even there was he quit of labours, not even  among his own; but all the gods had pity on him save  Poseidon, who raged continually against godlike Odysseus,  till he came to his own country. Howbeit Poseidon had now  departed for the distant Ethiopians, the Ethiopians that  are sundered in twain, the uttermost of men, abiding some  where Hyperion sinks and some where he rises.  There he  looked to receive his hecatomb of bulls and rams, there he  made merry sitting at the feast, but the other gods were  gathered in the halls of Olympian Zeus. Then among them the  father of gods and men began to speak, for he bethought him  in his heart of noble Aegisthus, whom the son of Agamemnon,  far-famed Orestes, slew. Thinking upon him he spake out  among the Immortals:    'Lo you now, how vainly mortal men do blame the gods! For  of us they say comes evil, whereas they even of themselves,  through the blindness of their own hearts, have sorrows  beyond that which is ordained. Even as of late Aegisthus,  beyond that which was ordained, took to him the wedded wife  of the son of Atreus, and killed her lord on his return,  and that with sheer doom before his eyes, since we had  warned him by the embassy of Hermes the keen-sighted, the  slayer of Argos, that he should neither kill the man, nor  woo his wife. For the son of Atreus shall be avenged at the  hand of Orestes, so soon as he shall come to man's estate  and long for his own country. So spake Hermes, yet he  prevailed not on the heart of Aegisthus, for all his good  will; but now hath he paid one price for all.'    And the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, answered him, saying: 'O  father, our father Cronides, throned in the highest; that  man assuredly lies in a death that is his due; so perish  likewise all who work such deeds! But my heart is rent for  wise Odysseus, that hapless one, who far from his friends  this long while suffereth affliction in a seagirt isle,  where is the navel of the sea, a woodland isle, and therein  a goddess hath her habitation, the daughter of the wizard  Atlas, who knows the depths of every sea, and himself  upholds the tall pillars which keep earth and sky asunder.  His daughter it is that holds the hapless man in sorrow:  and ever with soft and guileful tales she is wooing him to  forgetfulness of Ithaca. But Odysseus yearning to see if it  were but the smoke leap upwards from his own land, hath a  desire to die. As for thee, thine heart regardeth it not at  all, Olympian! What! did not Odysseus by the ships of the  Argives make thee free offering of sacrifice in the wide  Trojan land? Wherefore wast thou then so wroth with him, O  Zeus?'    And Zeus the cloud-gatherer answered her, and said, 'My  child, what word hath escaped the door of thy lips? Yea,  how should I forget divine Odysseus, who in understanding  is beyond mortals and beyond all men hath done sacrifice to  the deathless gods, who keep the wide heaven? Nay, but it  is Poseidon, the girdler of the earth, that hath been wroth  continually with quenchless anger for the Cyclops' sake  whom he blinded of his eye, even godlike Polyphemus whose  power is mightiest amongst all the Cyclopes. His mother was  the nymph Thoosa, daughter of Phorcys, lord of the  unharvested sea, and in the hollow caves she lay with  Poseidon. From that day forth Poseidon the earth-shaker  doth not indeed slay Odysseus, but driveth him wandering  from his own country. But come, let us here one and all  take good counsel as touching his returning, that he may be  got home; so shall Poseidon let go his displeasure, for he  will in no wise be able to strive alone against all, in  despite of all the deathless gods.'    Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, answered him, and said:  'O father, our father Cronides, throned in the highest, if  indeed this thing is now well pleasing to the blessed gods,  that wise Odysseus should return to his own home, let us  then speed Hermes the Messenger, the slayer of Argos, to  the island of Ogygia. There with all speed let him declare  to the lady of the braided tresses our unerring counsel,  even the return of the patient Odysseus, that so he may  come to his home. But as for me I will go to Ithaca that I  may rouse his son yet the more, planting might in his  heart, to call an assembly of the long-haired Achaeans and  speak out to all the wooers who slaughter continually the  sheep of his thronging flocks, and his kine with trailing  feet and shambling gait. And I will guide him to Sparta and  to sandy Pylos to seek "]]]
