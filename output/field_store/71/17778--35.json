[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13882"],[0,"John Thorndyke's Cases (#4)"],[1," is acting on the  obvious appearances, which is the proper thing to do in the first place.  Perhaps his notebook contains more than I think it does. But we shall  see.\"    When we entered the village I stopped to settle some business with the  chemist, who acted as Dr. Cooper's dispenser, suggesting to Thorndyke  that he should walk on to the house; but when I emerged from the shop  some ten minutes later he was waiting outside, with a smallish  brown-paper parcel under each arm. Of one of these parcels I insisted on  relieving him, in spite of his protests, but when he at length handed it  to me its weight completely took me by surprise.    \"I should have let them send this home on a barrow,\" I remarked.    \"So I should have done,\" he replied, \"only I did not wish to draw  attention to my purchase, or give my address.\"    Accepting this hint I refrained from making any inquiries as to the  nature of the contents (although I must confess to considerable  curiosity on the subject), and on arriving home I assisted him to  deposit the two mysterious parcels in his room.    When I came downstairs a disagreeable surprise awaited me. Hitherto the  long evenings had been spent by me in solitary and undisturbed enjoyment  of Dr. Cooper's excellent library, but to-night a perverse fate decreed  that I must wander abroad, because, forsooth, a preposterous farmer, who  resided in a hamlet five miles distant, had chosen the evening of my  guest's arrival to dislocate his bucolic elbow. I half hoped that  Thorndyke would offer to accompany me, but he made no such suggestion,  and in fact seemed by no means afflicted at the prospect of my absence.    \"I have plenty to occupy me while you are away,\" he said cheerfully; and  with this assurance to comfort me I mounted my bicycle and rode off  somewhat sulkily along the dark road.    My visit occupied in all a trifle under two hours, and when I reached  home, ravenously hungry and heated by my ride, half-past nine had  struck, and the village had begun to settle down for the night.    \"Sergeant Payne is a-waiting in the surgery, sir,\" the housemaid  announced as I entered the hall.    \"Confound Sergeant Payne!\" I exclaimed. \"Is Dr. Thorndyke with him?\"    \"No, sir,\" replied the grinning damsel. \"Dr. Thorndyke is hout.\"    \"Hout!\" I repeated (my surprise leading to unintentional mimicry).    \"Yes, sir. He went hout soon after you, sir, on his bicycle. He had a  basket strapped on to it--leastways a hamper--and he borrowed a basin  and a kitchen-spoon from the cook.\"    I stared at the girl in astonishment. The ways of John Thorndyke were,  indeed, beyond all understanding.    \"Well, let me have some dinner or supper at once,\" I said, \"and I will  see what the sergeant wants.\"    The officer rose as I entered the surgery, and, laying his helmet on the  table, approached me with an air of secrecy and importance.    \"Well, sir,\" said he, \"the fat's in the fire. I've arrested Mr. Draper,  and I've got him locked up in the court-house. But I wish it had been  someone else.\"    \"So does he, I expect,\" I remarked.    \"You see, sir,\" continued the sergeant, \"we all like Mr. Draper. He's  been among us a matter of seven years, and he's like one of ourselves.  However, what I've come about is this; it seems the gentleman who was  with you this evening is Dr. Thorndyke, the great expert. Now Mr. Draper  seems to have heard about him, as most of us have, and he is very  anxious for him to take up the defence. Do you think he would consent?\"    \"I expect so,\" I answered, remembering Thorndyke's keen interest in the  case; \"but I will ask him when he comes in.\"    \"Thank you, sir,\" said the sergeant. \"And perhaps you wouldn't mind  stepping round to the court-house presently yourself. He looks uncommon  queer, does Mr. Draper, and no wonder, so I'd like you to take a look at  him, and if you could bring Dr. Thorndyke with you, he'd like it, and so  should I, for, I assure you, sir, that although a conviction would mean  a step up the ladder for me, I'd be glad enough to find that I'd made a  mistake.\"    I was just showing my visitor out when a bicycle swept in through the  open gate, and Thorndyke dismounted at the door, revealing a square  hamper--evidently abstracted from the surgery--strapped on to a carrier  at the back. I conveyed the sergeant's request to him at once, and asked  if he was willing to take up the case.    \"As to taking up the defence,\" he replied, \"I will consider the matter;  but in any case I will come up and see the prisoner.\"    With this the sergeant departed, and Thorndyke, having unstrapped the  hamper with as much care as if it contained a collection of priceless  porcelain, bore it tenderly up to his bedroom; whence he appeared, after  a considerable interval, smilingly apologetic for the delay.    \"I thought you were dressing for dinner,\" I grumbled as he took his seat  at the table.    \"No,\" he replied. \"I have been considering this murder. Really it is a  most singular case, and promises to be uncommonly complicated, too.\"    \"Then I assume that you will undertake the defence?\"    \"I shall if Draper gives a reasonably straightforward account of  himself.\"    It appeared that this condition was likely to be fulfilled, for when we  arrived at the court-house (where the prisoner was accommodated in a  spare office, under rather free-and-easy conditions considering the  nature of the charge) we found Mr. Draper in an eminently communicative  frame of mind.    \"I want you, Dr. Thorndyke, to undertake my defence in this terrible  affair, because I feel confident that you will be able to clear me. And  I promise you that there shall be no reservation or concealment on my  part of anything that you ought to know.\"    \"Very well,\" said Thorndyke. \"By the way, I see you have changed your  shoes.\"    \"Yes, the sergeant took possession of those I was wearing. He said  something about comparing them with some footprints, but there can't be  any footprints like those shoes here in Sundersley. The nails are fixed  in the soles in quite a peculiar pattern. I had them made in Edinburgh.\"    \"Have you more than one pair?\"    \"No. I have no other nailed boots.\"    \"That is important,\" said Thorndyke. \"And now I judge that you have  something to tell us that bears on this crime. Am I right?\"    \"Yes. There is something that I am afraid it is necessary for you to  know, although it is very painful to me to revive memories of my past  that I had hoped were buried for ever. But perhaps, after all, it may  not be necessary for these confidences to be revealed to anyone but  yourself.\"    \"I hope not,\" said Thorndyke; \"and if it is not necessary you may rely  upon me not to allow any of your secrets to leak out. But you are wise  to tell me everything that may in any way bear upon the case.\"    At this juncture, seeing that confidential matters were about to be  discussed, I rose and prepared to withdraw; but Draper waved me back  into my chair.    \"You need not go away, Dr. Jervis,\" he said. \"It is through you that I  have the benefit of Dr. Thorndyke's help, and I know that you doctors  can be trusted to keep your own counsel and your clients' secrets. And  now for some confessions of mine. In the first place, it is my painful  duty to tell you that I am a discharged convict--an 'old lag,' as the  cant phrase has it.\"    He coloured a dusky red as he made this statement, and glanced furtively  at Thorndyke to observe its effect. But he might as well have looked at  a wooden figure-head or a stone mask as at my friend's immovable visage;  and when his communication had been acknowledged by a slight nod, he  proceeded:    \"The history of my wrong-doing is the history of hundreds of others. I  was a clerk in a bank, and getting on as well as I could expect in that  not very progressive avocation, when I had the misfortune to make four  very undesirable acquaintances. They were all young men, though rather  older than myself, and were close friends, forming a sort of little  community or club. They were not what is usually described as 'fast.'  They were quite sober and decently-behaved young follows, but they were  very decidedly addicted to gambling in a small way, and they soon  infected me. Before long I was the keenest gambler of them all. Cards,  billiards, pool, and various forms of betting began to be the chief  pleasures of my life, and not only was the bulk of my scanty salary  often consumed in the inevitable losses, but presently I found myself  considerably in debt, without any visible means of discharging my  liabilities. It is true that my four friends were my chief--in fact,  almost my only--creditors, but still, the debts existed, and had to be  paid.    \"Now these four friends of mine--named respectively Leach, Pitford,  Hearn, and Jezzard--were uncommonly clever men, though the full extent  of their cleverness was not appreciated by me until too late. And I,  too, was clever in my way, and a most undesirable way it was, for I  possessed the fatal gift of imitating handwriting and signatures with  the most remarkable accuracy. So perfect were my copies that the writers  themselves were frequently unable to distinguish their own signatures  from my imitations, and many a time was my skill invoked by some of my  companions to play off practical jokes upon the others. But these jests  were strictly confined to our own little set, for my four friends were  most careful and anxious that my dangerous accomplishment should not  become known to outsiders.    \"And now follows the consequence which you have no doubt foreseen. My  debts, though small, were accumulating, and I saw no prospect of being  able to pay them. Then, one night, Jezzard made a proposition. We had  been playing bridge at his rooms, and once more my ill luck had caused  me to increase my debt. I scribbled out an IOU, and pushed it across the  table to Jezzard, who picked it up with a very wry face, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13888"],[0,"Bacon (#4)"],[1,"showed himself capable of taking a  broad and calm view of questions which it was the fashion among good  men, and men who were in possession of the popular ear, to treat with  narrowness and heat, there was nothing to disclose his deeper  thoughts--nothing foreshadowed the purpose which was to fill his life.  He had, indeed, at the age of twenty-five, written a \"youthful\"  philosophical essay, to which he gave the pompous title \"_Temporis  Partus Maximus_,\" \"the Greatest Birth of Time.\" But he was thirty-one  when we first find an indication of the great idea and the great  projects which were to make his name famous. This indication is  contained in an earnest appeal to Lord Burghley for some help which  should not be illusory. Its words are distinct and far-reaching, and  they are the first words from him which tell us what was in his heart.  The letter has the interest to us of the first announcement of a promise  which, to ordinary minds, must have appeared visionary and extravagant,  but which was so splendidly fulfilled; the first distant sight of that  sea of knowledge which henceforth was opened to mankind, but on which no  man, as he thought, had yet entered. It contains the famous avowal--\"_I  have taken all knowledge to be my province_\"--made in the confidence  born of long and silent meditations and questionings, but made in a  simple good faith which is as far as possible from vain boastfulness.         \"MY LORD,--With as much confidence as mine own honest and faithful       devotion unto your service and your honourable correspondence unto       me and my poor estate can breed in a man, do I commend myself unto       your Lordship. I wax now somewhat ancient: one and thirty years is       a great deal of sand in the hour glass. My health, I thank God, I       find confirmed; and I do not fear that action shall impair it,       because I account my ordinary course of study and meditation to be       more painful than most parts of action are. I ever bare a mind (in       some middle place that I could discharge) to serve her Majesty, not       as a man born under Sol, that loveth honour, nor under Jupiter,       that loveth business (for the contemplative planet carrieth me away       wholly), but as a man born under an excellent sovereign that       deserveth the dedication of all men's abilities. Besides, I do not       find in myself so much self-love, but that the greater parts of my       thoughts are to deserve well (if I be able) of my friends, and       namely of your Lordship; who, being the Atlas of this commonwealth,       the honour of my house, and the second founder of my poor estate, I       am tied by all duties, both of a good patriot, and of an unworthy       kinsman, and of an obliged servant, to employ whatsoever I am to do       you service. Again, the meanness of my estate doth somewhat move       me; for though I cannot accuse myself that I am either prodigal or       slothful, yet my health is not to spend, nor my course to get.       Lastly, I confess that I have as vast contemplative ends as I have       moderate civil ends; for I have taken all knowledge to be my       province; and if I could purge it of two sorts of rovers, whereof       the one with frivolous disputations, confutations, and verbosities,       the other with blind experiments and auricular traditions and       impostures, hath committed so many spoils, I hope I should bring in       industrious observations, grounded conclusions, and profitable       inventions and discoveries: the best state of that province. This,       whether it be curiosity or vain glory, or nature, or (if one take       it favourably) _philanthropia_, is so fixed in my mind as it cannot       be removed. And I do easily see, that place of any reasonable       countenance doth bring commandment of more wits than of a man's       own; which is the thing I greatly affect. And for your Lordship,       perhaps you shall not find more strength and less encounter in any       other. And if your Lordship shall find now, or at any time, that I       do seek or affect any place whereunto any that is nearer unto your       Lordship shall be concurrent, say then that I am a most dishonest       man. And if your Lordship will not carry me on, I will not do as       Anaxagoras did, who reduced himself with contemplation unto       voluntary poverty, but this I will do--I will sell the inheritance       I have, and purchase some lease of quick revenue, or some office of       gain that shall be executed by deputy, and so give over all care of       service, and become some sorry book-maker, or a true pioneer in       that mine of truth which (he said) lay so deep. This which I have       writ unto your Lordship is rather thoughts than words, being set       down without all art, disguising, or reservation. Wherein I have       done honour both to your Lordship's wisdom, in judging that that       will be best believed of your Lordship which is truest, and to your       Lordship's good nature, in retaining nothing from you. And even so       I wish your Lordship all happiness, and to myself means and       occasions to be added to my faithful desire to do you service. From       my lodgings at Gray's Inn.\"    This letter to his unsympathetic and suspicious, but probably not  unfriendly relative, is the key to Bacon's plan of life; which, with  numberless changes of form, he followed to the end. That is, a  profession, steadily, seriously, and laboriously kept to, in order to  provide the means of living; and beyond that, as the ultimate and real  end of his life, the pursuit, in a way unattempted before, of all  possible human knowledge, and of the methods to improve it and make it  sure and fruitful. And so his life was carried out. On the one hand it  was a continual and pertinacious seeking after government employment,  which could give credit to his name and put money in his  pocket--attempts by general behaviour, by professional services when the  occasion offered, by putting his original and fertile pen at the service  of the government, to win confidence, and to overcome the manifest  indisposition of those in power to think that a man who cherished the  chimera of universal knowledge could be a useful public servant. On the  other hand, all the while, in the crises of his disappointment or  triumph, the one great subject lay next his heart, filling him with  fire and passion--how really to know, and to teach men to know indeed,  and to use their knowledge so as to command nature; the great hope to be  the reformer and restorer of knowledge in a more wonderful sense than  the world had yet seen in the reformation of learning and religion, and  in the spread of civilised order in the great states of the Renaissance  time. To this he gave his best and deepest thoughts; for this he was for  ever accumulating, and for ever rearranging and reshaping those masses  of observation and inquiry and invention and mental criticism which were  to come in as parts of the great design which he had seen in the visions  of his imagination, and of which at last he was only able to leave noble  fragments, incomplete after numberless recastings. This was not indeed  the only, but it was the predominant and governing, interest of his  life. Whether as solicitor for Court favour or public office; whether  drudging at the work of the law or managing State prosecutions; whether  writing an opportune pamphlet against Spain or Father Parsons, or  inventing a \"device\" for his Inn or for Lord Essex to give amusement to  Queen Elizabeth; whether fulfilling his duties as member of Parliament  or rising step by step to the highest places in the Council Board and  the State; whether in the pride of success or under the amazement of  unexpected and irreparable overthrow, while it seemed as if he was only  measuring his strength against the rival ambitions of the day, in the  same spirit and with the same object as his competitors, the true motive  of all his eagerness and all his labours was not theirs. He wanted to be  powerful, and still more to be rich; but he wanted to be so, because  without power and without money he could not follow what was to him the  only thing worth following on earth--a real knowledge of the amazing and  hitherto almost unknown world in which he had to live. Bacon, to us, at  least, at this distance, who can only judge him from partial and  imperfect knowledge, often seems to fall far short of what a man should  be. He was not one of the high-minded and proud searchers after  knowledge and truth, like Descartes, who were content to accept a frugal  independence so that their time and their thoughts might be their own.  Bacon was a man of the world, and wished to live in and with the world.  He threatened sometimes retirement, but never with any very serious  intention. In the Court was his element, and there were his hopes. Often  there seems little to distinguish him from the ordinary place-hunters,  obsequious and selfish, of every age; little to distinguish him from the  servile and insincere flatterers, of whom he himself complains, who  crowded the antechambers of the great Queen, content to submit with  smiling face and thankful words to the insolence of her waywardness and  temper, in the hope, more often disappointed than not, of hitting her  taste on some lucky occasion, and being rewarded for the accident by a  place of gain or honour. Bacon's history, as read in his letters, is not  an agreeable one; after every allowance made for the fashions of  language and the necessities of a suitor, there is too much of insincere  profession of disinterestedness, too much of exaggerated profession of  admiration and devoted service, too much of disparagement and  insinuation against others, for a man who respected himself. He  submitted too much to the miserable conditions of rising which he found.  But, nevertheless, it must be said"]]]
