And to  speak the truth, goodman, for I perceive I am no doctor at lying, my  father and mother would have me stay at home when my brethren were  gone, and that liketh me not; therefore am I come out to seek my luck  in the world: for Upmeads is good for a star-gazer, maybe, or a  simpler, or a priest, or a worthy good carle of the fields, but not for  a king's son with the blood running hot in his veins.  Or what sayest  thou, gossip?\"    Quoth the dame:  \"I could weep for thy mother; but for thee nought at  all.  It is good that thou shouldest do thy will in the season of youth  and the days of thy pleasure.  Yea, and I deem that thou shalt come  back again great and worshipful; and I am called somewhat foreseeing.  Only look to it that thou keep the pretty thing that I have just given  thee.\"    \"Well,\" said the chapman, \"this is fine talk about pleasure and the  doing of one's will; nevertheless a whole skin is good wares, though it  be not to be cheapened in any market of the world.  Now, lord, go thou  where thou wilt, whether I say go or abide; and forsooth I am no man of  King Peter's, that I should stay thee.  As for the name of the next  town, it is called Higham-on-the-Way, and is a big town plenteous of  victuals, with strong walls and a castle, and a very rich abbey of  monks:  and there is peace within its walls, because the father abbot  wages a many men to guard him and his, and to uphold his rights against  all comers; wherein he doth wisely, and also well.  For much folk  flocketh to his town and live well therein; and there is great recourse  of chapmen thither.  No better market is there betwixt this and  Babylon.  Well, Sir Ralph, I rede thee if thou comest unhurt to  Higham-on-the-Way, go no further for this time, but take service with  the lord abbot, and be one of his men of war; thou may'st then become  his captain if thou shouldest live; which would be no bad adventure for  one who cometh from Upmeads.\"    Ralph looked no brighter for this word, and he answered nought to it:  but said presently:    \"And what is to be looked for beyond Higham if one goeth further?  Dost  thou know the land any further?\"    The carle smiled:  \"Yea forsooth, and down to the Wood Perilous, and  beyond it, and the lands beyond the Wood; and far away through them.  I  say not that I have been to the Dry Tree; but I have spoken to one who  hath heard of him who hath seen it; though he might not come by a  draught of the Well at the World's End.\"    Ralph's eyes flashed, and his cheeks reddened as he listened hereto;  but he spake quietly:    \"Master Clement, how far dost thou make it to Higham-on-the-Way?\"    \"A matter of forty miles,\" said the Chapman; \"because, as thou wottest,  if ye ride south from hence, ye shall presently bring your nose up  against the big downs, and must needs climb them at once; and when ye  are at the top of Bear Hill, and look south away ye shall see nought  but downs on downs with never a road to call a road, and never a  castle, or church, or homestead:  nought but some shepherd's hut; or at  the most the little house of a holy man with a little chapel thereby in  some swelly of the chalk, where the water hath trickled into a pool;  for otherwise the place is waterless.\" Therewith he took a long pull at  the tankard by his side, and went on:    \"Higham is beyond all that, and out into the fertile plain; and a  little river hight Coldlake windeth about the meadows there; and it is  a fair land; though look you the wool of the downs is good, good, good!  I have foison of this year's fleeces with me.  Ye shall raise none such  in Upmeads.\"    Ralph sat silent a little, as if pondering, and then he started up and  said: \"Good master Clement, we have eaten thy meat and thank thee for  that and other matters.  Wilt thou now be kinder, and bid thy boy bring  round Falcon our horse; for we have far to go, and must begone  straight-away.\"    \"Yea, lord,\" said Clement, \"even so will I do.\"  And he muttered under  his breath; \"Thou talkest big, my lad, with thy 'we'; but thou art  pressed lest Nicholas be here presently to fetch thee back; and to say  sooth I would his hand were on thy shoulder even now.\"    Then he spake aloud again, and said:    \"I must now begone to my lads, and I will send one round with thy  war-horse. But take my rede, my lord, and become the man of the Abbot  of St. Mary's of Higham, and all will be well.\"    Therewith he edged himself out of the chamber, and the dame fell to  making a mighty clatter with the vessel and trenchers and cups on the  board, while Ralph walked up and down the chamber his war-gear jingling  upon him.  Presently the dame left her table-clatter and came up to  Ralph and looked kindly into his face and said:  \"Gossip, hast thou  perchance any money?\"    He flushed up red, and then his face fell; yet he spake gaily: \"Yea,  gossip, I have both white and red:  there are three golden crowns in my  pouch, and a little flock of silver pennies: forsooth I say not as many  as would reach from here to Upmeads, if they were laid one after the  other.\"    She smiled and patted his cheek, and said:    \"Thou art no very prudent child, king's son.  But it comes into my mind  that my master did not mean thee to go away empty-handed; else had he  not departed and left us twain together.\"    Therewith she went to the credence that stood in a corner, and opened a  drawer therein and took out a little bag, and gave it into Ralph's  hand, and said:  \"This is the gift of the gossip; and thou mayst take  it without shame; all the more because if thy father had been a worser  man, and a harder lord he would have had more to give thee.  But now  thou hast as much or more as any one of thy brethren.\"    He took the bag smiling and shame-faced, but she looked on him fondly  and said:    \"Now I know not whether I shall lay old Nicholas on thine heels when he  cometh after thee, as come he will full surely; or whether I shall  suffer the old sleuth-hound nose out thy slot of himself, as full  surely he will set on to it.\"    \"Thou mightest tell him,\" said Ralph, \"that I am gone to take service  with the Abbot of St. Mary's of Higham:  hah?\"    She laughed and said:  \"Wilt thou do so, lord, and follow the rede of  that goodman of mine, who thinketh himself as wise as Solomon?\"    Ralph smiled and answered her nothing.    \"Well,\" she said, \"I shall say what likes me when the hour is at hand.  Lo, here! thine horse.  Abide yet a moment of time, and then go whither  thou needs must, like the wind of the summer day.\"    Therewith she went out of the chamber and came back again with a scrip  which she gave to Ralph and said:  \"Herein is a flask of drink for the  waterless country, and a little meat for the way.  Fare thee well,  gossip!  Little did I look for it when I rose up this morning and  nothing irked me save the dulness of our town, and the littleness of  men's doings therein, that I should have to cut off a piece of my life  from me this morning, and say, farewell gossip, as now again I do.\"    Therewith she kissed him on either cheek and embraced him; and it might  be said of her and him that she let him go thereafter; for though as  aforesaid he loved her, and praised her kindness, he scarce understood  the eagerness of her love for him; whereas moreover she saw him not so  often betwixt Upmeads and Wulstead:  and belike she herself scarce  understood it.  Albeit she was a childless woman.    So when he had got to horse, she watched him riding a moment, and saw  how he waved his hand to her as he turned the corner of the  market-place, and how a knot of lads and lasses stood staring on him  after she lost sight of him.  Then she turned her back into the chamber  and laid her head on the table and wept.  Then came in the goodman  quietly and stood by her and she heeded him not.  He stood grinning  curiously on her awhile, and then laid his hand on her shoulder, and  said as she raised her face to him:    \"Sweetheart, it availeth nought; when thou wert young and exceeding  fair, he was but a little babe, and thou wert looking in those days to  have babes of thine own; and then it was too soon: and now that he is  such a beauteous young man, and a king's son withal, and thou art  wedded to a careful carle of no weak heart, and thou thyself art more  than two-score years old, it is too late.  Yet thou didst well to give  our lord the money.  Lo! here is wherewithal to fill up the lack in thy  chest; and here is a toy for thee in place of the pair of beads thou  gavest him; and I bid thee look on it as if I had given him my share of  the money and the beads.\"    She turned to Clement, and took the bag of money, and the chaplet which  he held out to her, and she said: \"God wot thou art no ill man, my  husband, but would God I had a son like to him!\"    She still wept somewhat; but the chapman said:  \"Let it rest there,  sweetheart! let it rest there!  It may be a year or twain before thou  seest him again:  and then belike he shall be come back with some woman  whom he loves better than any other; and who knows but in a way he may  deem himself our son.  Meanwhile thou hast done well, sweetheart, so be  glad.\"    Therewith he kissed her and went his ways to his merchandize, and she  to the ordering of her house, grieved but not unhappy.        CHAPTER 4    Ralph Rideth the Downs      As for Ralph, he rode on with a merry heart, and presently came to an  end of the plain country, and the great downs rose up before him with a  white road winding up to the top of them.  Just before the slopes began  to rise was a little thorp beside a stream, and thereby a fair church  and a little house of Canons: so Ralph rode toward the church to see if  therein were an altar of St. Nicholas, who was his good lord and  patron, that he might ask of him a blessing on his journey.  But as he "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16921"],[0,"Plague Ship (#4)"],[1,"-\" And he did not name the hovering third member of  his party.    Jellico stood waiting and after a long moment of silence Grange was  forced to state his business.    \"We have until noon--\"    Jellico, his fingers hooked in his belt, simply waited. And under his  level gaze the Eysie Captain began to find the going hard.    \"They have given us until noon,\" he started once more, \"to get  together--\"    Jellico's voice came, coldly remote. \"There is no reason for any 'getting  together,' Grange. By rights I can have you up before the Trade Board for  poaching. The Solar Queen has sole trading rights here. If you up-ship  within a reasonable amount of time, I'll be inclined to let it pass.  After all I've no desire to run all the way to the nearest Patrol post to  report you--\"    \"You can't expect to buck Inter-Solar. We'll make you an offer--\" That  was Kallee's contribution, made probably because his commanding officer  couldn't find words explosive enough.    Jellico, whose forté was more direct action, took an excursion into  heavy-handed sarcasm. \"You Eysies have certainly been given excellent  briefing. I would advise a little closer study of the Code--and not the  sections in small symbols at the end of the tape, either! _We're_ not  bucking anyone. You'll find our registration for Sargol down on tapes at  the Center. And I suggest that the sooner you withdraw the better--before  we cite you for illegal planeting.\"    Grange had gained control of his emotions. \"We're pretty far from Center  here,\" he remarked. It was a statement of fact, but it carried over-tones  which they were able to assess correctly. The Solar Queen was a Free  Trader, alone on an alien world. But the I-S ship might be cruising in  company, ready to summon aid, men and supplies. Dane drew a deep breath,  the Eysies _must_ be sure of themselves, not only that, but they must  want what Sargol had to offer to the point of being willing to step  outside the law to get it.    The I-S Captain took a step forward. \"I think we understand each other  now,\" he said, his confidence restored.    Van Rycke answered him, his deep voice cutting across the sighing of the  wind in the grass forest.    \"Your proposition?\"    Perhaps this return to their implied threat bolstered their belief in the  infallibility of the Company, their conviction that no independent dared  stand up against the might and power of Inter-Solar. Kallee replied:    \"We'll take up your contract, at a profit to you, and you up-ship before  the Salariki are confused over whom they are to deal with--\"    \"And the amount of profit?\" Van Rycke bored in.    \"Oh,\" Kallee shrugged, \"say ten percent of Cam's last shipment--\"    Jellico laughed. \"Generous, aren't you, Eysie? Ten percent of a cargo  which can't be assessed--the gang on Limbo kept no records of what they  plundered.\"    \"We don't know what he was carrying when he crashed on Limbo,\" countered  Kallee swiftly. \"We'll base our offer on what he carried to Axal.\"    Now Van Rycke chucked. \"I wonder who figured that one out?\" he inquired  of the scented winds. \"He must save the Company a fair amount of credits  one way or another. Interesting offer--\"    By the bland satisfaction to be read on the three faces below the I-S men  were assured of their victory. The Solar Queen would be paid off with a  pittance, under the vague threat of Company retaliation she would  up-ship from Sargol, and they would be left in possession of the rich  Koros trade--to be commended and rewarded by their superiors. Had they,  Dane speculated, ever had any dealings with Free Traders before--at least  with the brand of independent adventurers such as manned the Solar Queen?    Van Rycke burrowed in his belt pouch and then held out his hand. On the  broad palm lay a flat disc of metal. \"Very interesting--\" he repeated. \"I  shall treasure this recording--\"    The sight of that disc wiped all satisfaction from the Eysie faces.  Grange's purplish flush spread up from his tight tunic collar, Kallee  blinked, and the unknown third's hand dropped to his sleep rod. An action  which was not overlooked by either Dane or Ali.    \"A smooth set down to you,\" Jellico gave the conventional leave taking of  the Service.    \"You'd better--\" the Eysie Captain began hotly, and then seeing the disc  Van Rycke held--that sensitive bit of metal and plastic which was  recording this interview for future reference, he shut his mouth tight.    \"Yes?\" the Queen's Cargo-master prompted politely. But Kallee had taken  his Captain's arm and was urging Grange away from the spacer.    \"You have until noon to lift,\" was Jellico's parting shot as the three in  Company livery started toward the road.    \"I don't think that they will,\" he added to Van Rycke.    The Cargo-master nodded. \"You wouldn't in their place,\" he pointed out  reasonably. \"On the other hand they've had a bit of a blast they weren't  expecting. It's been a long time since Grange heard anyone say 'no.'\"    \"A shock which is going to wear off,\" Jellico's habitual distrust of the  future gathered force.    \"This,\" Van Rycke tucked the disc back into his pouch, \"sent them off  vector a parsec or two. Grange is not one of the strong arm blaster  boys. Suppose Tang Ya does a little listening in--and maybe we can rig  another surprise if Grange does try to ask advice of someone off world.  In the meantime I don't think they are going to meddle with the Salariki.  They don't want to have to answer awkward questions if _we_ turn up a  Patrol ship to ask them. So--\" he stretched and beckoned to Dane, \"we  shall go to work once more.\"    Again two paces behind Van Rycke Dane tramped to the trade circle of the  Salariki clansmen. They might have walked out only five or six minutes of  ship time before, and the natives betrayed no particular interest in  their return. But, Dane noted, there was only one empty stool, one  ceremonial table in evidence. The Salariki had expected only one Terran  Trader to join them.    What followed was a dreary round of ceremony, an exchange of platitudes  and empty good wishes and greetings. No one mentioned Koros stones--or  even perfume bark--that he was willing to offer the off-world traders.  None lifted so much as a corner of his trade cloth, under which, if he  were ready to deal seriously, his hidden hand would meet that of the  buyer, so that by finger pressure alone they could agree or disagree on  price. But such boring sessions were part of Trade and Dane, keeping a  fraction of attention on the speeches and \"drinkings-together,\" watched  those around him with an eye which tried to assess and classify what he  saw.    The keynote of the Salariki character was a wary independence. The only  form of government they would tolerate was a family-clan organization.  Feuds and deadly duels between individuals and clans were the accepted  way of life and every male who reached adulthood went armed and ready for  combat until he became a \"Speaker for the past\"--too old to bear arms in  the field. Due to the nature of their battling lives, relatively few of  the Salariki ever reached that retirement. Short-lived alliances between  families sometimes occurred, usually when they were to face a common  enemy greater than either. But a quarrel between chieftains, a fancied  insult would rip that open in an instant. Only under the Trade Shield  could seven clans sit this way without their warriors being at one  another's furred throats.    An hour before sunset Paft turned his goblet upside down on his table, a  move followed speedily by every chieftain in the circle. The conference  was at an end for that day. And as far as Dane could see it had  accomplished exactly nothing--except to bring the Eysies into the open.  What _had_ Traxt Cam discovered which had given him the trading contract  with these suspicious aliens? Unless the men from the Queen learned it,  they could go on talking until the contract ran out and get no farther  than they had today.    From his training Dane knew that ofttimes contact with an alien race did  require long and patient handling. But between study and experiencing the  situation himself there was a gulf, and he thought somewhat ruefully that  he had much to learn before he could meet such a situation with Van  Rycke's unfailing patience and aplomb. The Cargo-master seemed in nowise  tired by his wasted day and Dane knew that Van would probably sit up half  the night, going over for the hundredth time Traxt Cam's sketchy  recordings in another painstaking attempt to discover why and how the  other Free Trader had succeeded where the Queen's men were up against a  stone wall.    The harvesting of Koros stones was, as Dane and all those who had been  briefed from Cam's records knew, a perilous job. Though the rule of the  Salariki was undisputed on the land masses of Sargol, it was another  matter in the watery world of the shallow seas. There the Gorp were in  command of the territory and one had to be constantly alert for attack  from the sly, reptilian intelligence, so alien to the thinking processes  of both Salariki and Terran that there was, or seemed to be, no point of  possible contact. One went gathering Koros gems after balancing life  against gain. And perhaps the Salariki did not see any profit in that  operation. Yet Traxt Cam had brought back his bag of gems--somehow he had  managed to secure them in trade.    Van Rycke climbed the ramp, hurrying on into the Queen as if he would not  get back to his records soon enough. But Dane paused and looked back at  the grass jungle a little wistfully. To his mind these early morning  hours were the best time on Sargol. The light was golden, the night winds  had not yet arisen. He disliked exchanging the freedom of the open for  the confinement of the spacer.    And, as he hesitated there, two of the juvenile population of Sargol came  out of the forest. Between them they carried one of their hunting nets, a "]]]
