He  reflected, while he was dressing for dinner on Christmas night, how  odd it was he had ever thought of Using them. He might as well have  hoped to Use the Dresden shepherds and shepherdesses that grinned out  in the last stages of refinement at him from the glazed cabinets in  the drawing-rooms.... Or the Labour Members themselves....    True there was Evesham. He had shown an exquisitely open mind about  the whole thing. He had at once grasped the underlying principles,  thrown out some amazingly luminous suggestions. Oh yes, Evesham was a  statesman, right enough. But had even he ever really _believed_ in the  idea of a Provisional Government of England by the Female Foundlings?    To Perkins the whole thing had seemed so simple, so imminent--a thing  that needed only a little general good-will to bring it about. And  now.... Suppose his Bill _had_ passed its Second Reading, suppose it  had become Law, would this poor old England be by way of functioning  decently--after all? Foundlings were sometimes naughty....    What was the matter with the whole human race? He remembered again  those words of Scragson's that had had such a depressing effect on him  at the Cambridge Union--\"Look here, you know! It's all a huge nasty  mess, and we're trying to swab it up with a pocket handkerchief.\"  Well, he'd given up trying to do that....      Sec.2.    During dinner his eyes wandered furtively up and down the endless  ornate table, and he felt he had been, in a sort of way, right in  thinking these people were the handiest instrument to prise open  the national conscience with. The shining red faces of the men, the  shining white necks and arms of the women, the fearless eyes, the  general free-and-easiness and spaciousness, the look of late hours  counteracted by fresh air and exercise and the best things to eat and  drink--what mightn't be made of these people, if they'd only Submit?    Perkins looked behind them, at the solemn young footmen passing  and repassing, noiselessly, in blue and white liveries. _They_ had  Submitted. And it was just because they had been able to that they  were no good.    \"Damn!\" said Perkins, under his breath.      Sec.3.    One of the big conifers from the park had been erected in the hall,  and this, after dinner, was found to be all lighted up with electric  bulbs and hung with packages in tissue paper.    The Duchess stood, a bright, feral figure, distributing these packages  to the guests. Perkins' name was called out in due course and the  package addressed to him was slipped into his hand. He retired  with it into a corner. Inside the tissue-paper was a small morocco  leather case. Inside that was a set of diamond and sapphire  sleeve-links--large ones.    He stood looking at them, blinking a little.    He supposed he must put them on. But something in him,  some intractably tough bit of his old self, rose up  protesting--frantically.    If he couldn't Use these people, at least they weren't going to Use  _him_!    \"No, damn it!\" he said under his breath, and, thrusting the case into  his pocket, slipped away unobserved.      Sec.4.    He flung himself into a chair in his bedroom and puffed a blast of air  from his lungs.... Yes, it had been a narrow escape. He knew that if  he had put those beastly blue and white things on he would have been a  lost soul....    \"You've got to pull yourself together, d'you hear?\" he said to  himself. \"You've got to do a lot of clear, steady, merciless  thinking--now, to-night. You've got to persuade yourself somehow that,  Foundlings or no Foundlings, this regeneration of mankind business may  still be set going--and by _you_.\"    He paced up and down the room, fuming. How recapture the generous  certitudes that had one by one been slipping away from him? He found  himself staring vacantly at the row of books on the little shelf by  his bed. One of them seemed suddenly to detach itself--he could almost  have sworn afterwards that he didn't reach out for it, but that it  hopped down into his hand....    \"Sitting Up For The Dawn\"! It was one of that sociological series by  which H.G. W*lls had first touched his soul to finer issues when he  was at the 'Varsity.    He opened it with tremulous fingers. Could it re-exert its old sway  over him now?    The page he had opened it at was headed \"General Cessation Day,\" and  he began to read....    \"The re-casting of the calendar on a decimal basis seems a simple  enough matter at first sight. But even here there are details that  will have to be thrashed out....    \"Mr. Edgar Dibbs, in his able pamphlet 'Ten to the Rescue,'[1]  advocates a twenty-hour day, and has drawn up an ingenious scheme for  accelerating the motion of this planet by four in every twenty-four  hours, so that the alternations of light and darkness shall be  re-adjusted to the new reckoning. I think such re-adjustment would  be indispensable (though I know there is a formidable body of opinion  against me). But I am far from being convinced of the feasibility  of Mr. Dibbs' scheme. I believe the twenty-four hour day has come to  stay--anomalous though it certainly will seem in the ten-day week,  the fifty-day month, and the thousand-day year. I should like to have  incorporated Mr. Dibbs' scheme in my vision of the Dawn. But, as I  have said, the scope of this vision is purely practical....    [Footnote 1: Published by the Young Self-Helpers' Press, Ipswich.]    \"Mr. Albert Baker, in a paper[2] read before the South Brixton  Hebdomadals, pleads that the first seven days of the decimal  week should retain their old names, the other three to be called  provisionally Huxleyday, Marxday, and Tolstoiday. But, for reasons  which I have set forth elsewhere,[3] I believe that the nomenclature  which I had originally suggested[4]--Aday, Bday, and so on to  Jday--would be really the simplest way out of the difficulty.  Any fanciful way of naming the days would be bad, as too sharply  differentiating one day from another. What we must strive for in the  Dawn is that every day shall be as nearly as possible like every  other day. We must help the human units--these little pink slobbering  creatures of the Future whose cradle we are rocking--to progress not  in harsh jerks, but with a beautiful unconscious rhythm....    [Footnote 2: \"Are We Going Too Fast?\"]    [Footnote 3: \"A Midwife For The Millennium.\" H.G. W*lls.]    [Footnote 4: \"How To Be Happy Though Yet Unborn.\" H.G. W*lls.]    \"There must be nothing corresponding to our Sunday. Sunday is a canker  that must be cut ruthlessly out of the social organism. At present  the whole community gets 'slack' on Saturday because of the paralysis  that is about to fall on it. And then 'Black Monday'!--that day when  the human brain tries to readjust itself--tries to realise that the  shutters are down, and the streets are swept, and the stove-pipe hats  are back in their band-boxes....    \"Yet of course there must be holidays. We can no more do without  holidays than without sleep. For every man there must be certain  stated intervals of repose--of recreation in the original sense of the  word. My views on the worthlessness of classical education are perhaps  pretty well known to you, but I don't underrate the great service that  my friend Professor Ezra K. Higgins has rendered by his discovery[5]  that the word recreation originally signified a re-creating--i.e.,[6]  a time for the nerve-tissues to renew themselves in. The problem  before us is how to secure for the human units in the Dawn--these  giants of whom we are but the foetuses--the holidays necessary for  their full capacity for usefulness to the State, without at the same  time disorganising the whole community--and them.    [Footnote 5: \"Words About Words.\" By Ezra K. Higgins, Professor of    Etymology, Abraham Z. Stubbins University, Padua, Pa., U.S.A. (2    vols.).]    [Footnote 6: \"_Id est_\"--\"That is.\"]    \"The solution is really very simple. The community will be divided  into ten sections--Section A, Section B, and so on to Section J. And  to every section one day of the decimal week will be assigned as a  'Cessation Day.' Thus, those people who fall under Section A will rest  on Aday, those who fall under Section B will rest on Bday, and so on.  On every day of the year one-tenth of the population will be resting,  but the other nine-tenths will be at work. The joyous hum and clang of  labour will never cease in the municipal workshops....    \"You figure the smokeless blue sky above London dotted all over with  airships in which the holiday-making tenth are re-creating themselves  for the labour of next week--looking down a little wistfully, perhaps,  at the workshops from which they are temporarily banished. And here I  scent a difficulty. So attractive a thing will labour be in the Dawn  that a man will be tempted not to knock off work when his Cessation  Day comes round, and will prefer to work for no wage rather than not  at all. So that perhaps there will have to be a law making Cessation  Day compulsory, and the Overseers will be empowered to punish  infringement of this law by forbidding the culprit to work for ten  days after the first offence, twenty after the second, and so on. But  I don't suppose there will often be need to put this law in motion.  The children of the Dawn, remember, will not be the puny self-ridden  creatures that we are. They will not say, 'Is this what I want to  do?' but 'Shall I, by doing this, be (a) harming or (b) benefiting--no  matter in how infinitesimal a degree--the Future of the Race?'    \"Sunday must go. And, as I have hinted, the progress of mankind will  be steady proportionately to its own automatism. Yet I think there  would be no harm in having one--just one--day in the year set aside as  a day of universal rest--a day for the searching of hearts.

[Illustration: Three bee-hives; wooden boxes about two feet square and four  feet high, with a sloped roof.]    3. They are very wise and busy little creatures. They all join together to  build cells of wax for their honey.    4. Each bee takes its proper place, and does its own work. Some go out and  gather honey from the flowers; others stay at home and work inside the  hive.    5. The cells which they build, are all of one shape and size, and no room  is left between them.    6. The cells are not round, but have six sides. 7. Did you ever look into  a glass hive to see the bees while at work? It is pleasant to see how busy  they always are.    8. But the drones do not work. Before winter comes, all the drones are  driven from the hive or killed, that they may not eat the honey which they  did not gather.    9. It is not quite safe for children to handle bees. They have sharp  stings that they know well how to use in their defense.        SLATE WORK.    [Illustration: Script Exercise:    How doth the little busy bee    Improve each shining hour.

In days that are sunny     He's getting his honey;     In days that are cloudy       He's making his wax:     On pinks and on lilies,     And gay daffodillies,     And columbine blossoms,       He levies a tax!    3.

Mary Armstrong was a pretty little girl, but she was heedless about  some things.    2. Her way of leaving her books and playthings just where she had used  them last, gave her mother much trouble in picking them up and putting  them in their proper places.    3. She had often told Mary the evil effects of being so careless. Her  books became spoiled, and her toys broken.    4. But worse than this was the growing habit of carelessness, which would  be of great harm to her all her life. It would make her unhappy, and would  annoy her friends.    5. One day Mary and her mother went out into their pleasant yard, to spend  an hour in the open air. Mrs. Armstrong took her work with her.    6. Mary ran about and played with Dash, her pet dog, and was having a  happy time.    7. But in a corner of the yard she found her nicest doll all torn and  broken, and its dress covered with mud.    8. She knew, at once, that Dash had done this, and she scolded him  harshly.    9. Carrying the broken doll to her mamma. she showed it to her, and could  hardly keep from crying.    10. Mrs. Armstrong asked Mary if she had not left the doll on the porch  where Dash could easily get it; and Mary had to answer, \"Yes, ma'am.\"    11. \"Then you must not blame the dog, Mary, for he does not know it is  wrong for him to play with your doll. I hope this will be a lesson to you  hereafter, to put your things away when you are through playing.\"    12. \"I will try,\" said Mary. And her mother promised to mend the doll as  well as she could.

Sheep are washed and sheared some time in the month of June. This  should be done quite early in the month, before the hot days begin.    2. It is fine sport for those who look on, but not much fun for the sheep.      3. It is best for the sheep to have the wool taken off; otherwise they  would suffer in the summer time.    4. When the time comes for washing the sheep, they are driven to a pond or  a little river.    5. Then they are thrown into the water, one at a time. The men who are in  the water catch them, and squeeze the wet wool with their hands to get the  dirt all out of it.    6. Then the wool is thoroughly dried, the sheep are taken to the shearer;  and he cuts off the wool with a large pair of shears.    7. It is then dyed, spun, and woven into cloth.    8. In a short time, before the cold winter comes, new wool grows out on  the sheep. By the corning of spring there is so much, that it must be cut  off again.

Little Patty lives in a log house near a great forest. She has no  sisters, and her big brothers are away all day helping their father.    2. But Patty is never lonely; for, though the nearest house is miles away,  she has many little friends. Here are two of them that live in the woods.    3. But how did Patty teach them to be so tame? Patty came to the woods  often, and was always so quiet and gentle that the squirrels soon found  they need not be afraid of her.    4. She brought her bread and milk to eat under the trees, and was sure to  leave crumbs for the squirrels.    5. When they came near, she sat very still and watched them. So, little by  little, she made them her friends, till, at last, they would sit on her  shoulder, and eat from her hand.    6. Squirrels build for themselves summer houses. Those are made of leaves,  and sticks, and moss. They are nice and cool for summer, but would never  do for the winter cold and snow.    7. So these wise little people find a hollow in an old tree. They make it  warm and snug with soft moss and leaves; and here the squirrels live all  through the long winter.

Sam had spent all his money for the book, but he was a happy boy.    3. At length he came into the highroad, where there was a gate. A blind  man stood, holding it open.    4. The poor man said, \"Please give me a few cents to buy some bread!\" But  Sam gave him nothing.    5. What! did Sam give the poor blind man nothing? Yes; for, as I told you,  he had spent all his money.    6. So Sam walked on, very sad. Soon after, a fine carriage came up, and in  it were Harry and his mother.    7. The blind man stood, and held out his hat. \"Let us give the poor man  something,\" said Harry to his mother.    8. His mother gave him some cents. Harry took them, but did not put them  into the man's hat.    9. He threw them into the hedge as far as he could. The poor man could not  find them, for, you know, ho was blind.    10. Sam had turned back to look at the fine carriage. He saw Harry throw  the cents into the hedge; so he came back at once, and looked for the  money until he found it all for the blind man.    11.
