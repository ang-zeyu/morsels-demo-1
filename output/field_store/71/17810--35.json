Two cowled women in black, veiled to the eyes in gauze heavily sewn with  sequins, barefooted, with massive silver anklets, watched us pass. Hindu  workmen in turban and loin-cloth furnished a picturesque note, but did  not seem to be injuring themselves by over-exertion. Naked small boys  raced us for a short distance. The banks glided by very slowly and very  evenly, the wash sucked after us like water in a slough after a duck  boat, and the sky above the yellow sand looked extremely blue.    At short and regular intervals, half-way up the miniature sandhills,  heavy piles or snubbing-posts had been planted. For these we at first  could guess no reason. Soon, however, we had to pass another ship; and  then we saw that one of us must tie up to avoid being drawn irresistibly  by suction into collision with the other. The craft sidled by, separated  by only a few feet, so that we could look across to each other's decks  and exchange greetings. As the day grew this interest grew likewise.  Dredgers in the canal; rusty tramps flying unfamiliar flags of strange  tiny countries; big freighters, often with Greek or Turkish characters  on their sterns; small dirty steamers of suspicious business; passenger  ships like our own, returning from the tropics, with white-clad, languid  figures reclining in canvas chairs; gunboats of this or that nation  bound on mysterious affairs; once a P. & O. converted into a troopship,  from whose every available porthole, hatch, deck, and shroud laughing,  brown, English faces shouted chaff at our German decks--all these  either tied up for us, or were tied up for by us. The only craft that  received no consideration on our part were the various picturesque Arab  dhows, with their single masts and the long yards slanting across them.  Since these were very small, our suction dragged at them cruelly. As a  usual thing four vociferous figures clung desperately to a rope passed  around one of the snubbing-posts ashore, while an old man shrieked  syllables at them from the dhow itself. As they never by any chance  thought of mooring her both stem and stern, the dhow generally changed  ends rapidly, shipping considerable water in the process. It must be  very trying to get so excited in a hot climate.    The high sandbanks of the early part of the day soon dropped lower to  afford us a wider view. In its broad, general features the country was,  quite simply, the desert of Arizona over again. There were the same  high, distant, and brittle-looking mountains, fragile and pearly; the  same low, broken half-distances; the same wide sweeps; the same  wonderful changing effects of light, colour, shadow, and mirage; the  same occasional strips of green marking the watercourses and oases. As  to smaller detail, we saw many interesting divergences. In the  foreground constantly recurred the Bedouin brush shelters, each with its  picturesque figure or so in flowing robes, and its grumpy camels. Twice  we saw travelling caravans, exactly like the Bible pictures. At one  place a single burnoused Arab, leaning on his elbows, reclined full  length on the sky-line of a clean-cut sandhill. Glittering in the  mirage, half-guessed, half-seen, we made out distant little white towns  with slender palm trees. At places the water from the canal had  overflowed wide tracts of country. Here, along the shore, we saw  thousands of the water-fowl already familiar to us, as well as such  strangers as gaudy kingfishers, ibises, and rosy flamingoes.    The canal itself seemed to be in a continual state of repair. Dredgers  were everywhere; some of the ordinary shovel type, others working by  suction, and discharging far inland by means of weird huge pipes that  apparently meandered at will over the face of nature. The control  stations were beautifully French and neat, painted yellow, each with its  gorgeous bougainvilleas in flower, its square-rigged signal masts, its  brightly painted extra buoys standing in a row, its wharf--and its  impassive Arab fishermen thereon. We reclined in our canvas chairs, had  lemon squashes brought to us, and watched the entertainment steadily and  slowly unrolled before us.    We reached the end of the canal about three o'clock of the afternoon,  and dropped anchor off the low-lying shores. Our binoculars showed us  white houses in apparently single rank along a far-reaching narrow sand  spit, with sparse trees and a railroad line. That was the town of Suez,  and seemed so little interesting that we were not particularly sorry  that we could not go ashore. Far in the distance were mountains; and the  water all about us was the light, clear green of the sky at sunset.    Innumerable dhows and row-boats swarmed down, filled with eager salesmen  of curios and ostrich plumes. They had not much time in which to  bargain, so they made it up in rapid-fire vociferation. One very tall  and dignified Arab had as sailor of his craft the most extraordinary  creature, just above the lower limit of the human race. He was of a dull  coal black, without a single high light on him anywhere, as though he  had been sand-papered, had prominent teeth, like those of a baboon, in a  wrinkled, wizened monkey face, across which were three tattooed bands,  and possessed a little, long-armed, spare figure, bent and wiry. He  clambered up and down his mast, fetching things at his master's behest;  leapt nonchalantly for our rail or his own spar, as the case might be,  across the staggering abyss; clung so well with his toes that he might  almost have been classified with the quadrumana; and between times  squatted humped over on the rail, watching us with bright, elfish, alien  eyes.    At last the big German sailors bundled the whole variegated horde  overside. It was time to go, and our anchor chain was already rumbling  in the hawse pipes. They tumbled hastily into their boats; and at once  swarmed up their masts, whence they feverishly continued their  interrupted bargaining. In fact, so fully embarked on the tides of  commerce were they, that they failed to notice the tides of nature  widening between us. One old man, in especial, at the very top of his  mast, jerked hither and thither by the sea, continued imploringly to  offer an utterly ridiculous carved wooden camel long after it was  impossible to have completed the transaction should anybody have been  moonstruck enough to have desired it. Our ship's prow swung; and just at  sunset, as the lights of Suez were twinkling out one by one, we headed  down the Red Sea.          V.    THE RED SEA.      Suez is indeed the gateway to the East. In the Mediterranean often the  sea is rough, the winds cold, passengers are not yet acquainted, and hug  the saloons or the leeward side of the deck. Once through the canal and  all is changed by magic. The air is hot and languid; the ship's company  down to the very scullions appear in immaculate white; the saloon chairs  and transoms even are put in white coverings; electric fans hum  everywhere; the run on lemon squashes begins; and many quaint and  curious customs of the tropics obtain.    For example: it is etiquette that before eight o'clock one may wander  the decks at will in one's pyjamas, converse affably with fair ladies in  pigtail and kimono, and be not abashed. But on the stroke of eight bells  it is also etiquette to disappear very promptly and to array one's self  for the day; and it is very improper indeed to see or be seen after that  hour in the rather extreme _negligee_ of the early morning. Also it  becomes the universal custom, or perhaps I should say the necessity, to  slumber for an hour after the noon meal. Certainly sleep descending on  the tropical traveller is armed with a bludgeon. Passengers, crew,  steerage, \"deck,\" animal, and bird fall down then in an enchantment. I  have often wondered who navigates the ship during that sacred hour, or,  indeed, if anybody navigates it at all. Perhaps that time is sacred to  the genii of the old East, who close all prying mortal eyes, but in  return lend a guiding hand to the most pressing of mortal affairs. The  deck of the ship is a curious sight between the hours of half-past one  and three. The tropical siesta requires no couching of the form. You sit  down in your chair, with a book--you fade slowly into a deep, restful  slumber. And yet it is a slumber wherein certain small pleasant things  persist from the world outside. You remain dimly conscious of the  rhythmic throbbing of the engines, of the beat of soft, warm air on your  cheek.    At three o'clock or thereabout you rise as gently back to life, and sit  erect in your chair without a stretch or a yawn in your whole anatomy.  Then is the one time of day for a display of energy--if you have any to  display. Ship games, walks--fairly brisk--explorations to the  forecastle, a watch for flying fish or Arab dhows, anything until  tea-time. Then the glowing sunset; the opalescent sea, and the soft  afterglow of the sky--and the bugle summoning you to dress. That is a  mean job. Nothing could possibly swelter worse than the tiny cabin. The  electric fan is an aggravation. You reappear in your fresh \"whites\"  somewhat warm and flustered in both mind and body. A turn around the  deck cools you off; and dinner restores your equanimity--dinner with the  soft, warm tropic air breathing through all the wide-open ports; the  electric fans drumming busily; the men all in clean white; the ladies,  the very few precious ladies, in soft, low gowns. After dinner the deck,  as near cool as it will be, and heads bare to the breeze of our  progress, and glowing cigars. At ten or eleven o'clock the groups begin  to break up, the canvas chairs to empty. Soon reappears a pyjamaed  figure followed by a steward carrying a mattress. This is spread, under  its owner's direction, in a dark corner forward.

[_A knocking_.]  O Death! I know it!--'tis my Famulus--  Good-bye, ye dreams of bliss Elysian!  Shame! that so many a glowing vision  This dried-up sneak must scatter thus!          [WAGNER, _in sleeping-gown and night-cap, a lamp in his hand._         FAUST _turns round with an annoyed look_.]    _Wagner_. Excuse me! you're engaged in declamation;  'Twas a Greek tragedy no doubt you read?  I in this art should like initiation,  For nowadays it stands one well instead.  I've often heard them boast, a preacher  Might profit with a player for his teacher.    _Faust_. Yes, when the preacher is a player, granted:  As often happens in our modern ways.    _Wagner_. Ah! when one with such love of study's haunted,  And scarcely sees the world on holidays,  And takes a spy-glass, as it were, to read it,  How can one by persuasion hope to lead it?    _Faust_. What you don't feel, you'll never catch by hunting,  It must gush out spontaneous from the soul,  And with a fresh delight enchanting  The hearts of all that hear control.  Sit there forever! Thaw your glue-pot,--  Blow up your ash-heap to a flame, and brew,  With a dull fire, in your stew-pot,  Of other men's leavings a ragout!  Children and apes will gaze delighted,  If their critiques can pleasure impart;  But never a heart will be ignited,  Comes not the spark from the speaker's heart.    _Wagner_. Delivery makes the orator's success;  There I'm still far behindhand, I confess.    _Faust_. Seek honest gains, without pretence!  Be not a cymbal-tinkling fool!  Sound understanding and good sense  Speak out with little art or rule;  And when you've something earnest to utter,  Why hunt for words in such a flutter?  Yes, your discourses, that are so refined'  In which humanity's poor shreds you frizzle,  Are unrefreshing as the mist and wind  That through the withered leaves of autumn whistle!    _Wagner_. Ah God! well, art is long!  And life is short and fleeting.  What headaches have I felt and what heart-beating,  When critical desire was strong.  How hard it is the ways and means to master  By which one gains each fountain-head!  And ere one yet has half the journey sped,  The poor fool dies--O sad disaster!    _Faust_. Is parchment, then, the holy well-spring, thinkest,  A draught from which thy thirst forever slakes?  No quickening element thou drinkest,  Till up from thine own soul the fountain breaks.    _Wagner_. Excuse me! in these olden pages  We catch the spirit of the by-gone ages,  We see what wisest men before our day have thought,  And to what glorious heights we their bequests have brought.    _Faust_. O yes, we've reached the stars at last!  My friend, it is to us,--the buried past,--  A book with seven seals protected;  Your spirit of the times is, then,  At bottom, your own spirit, gentlemen,  In which the times are seen reflected.  And often such a mess that none can bear it;  At the first sight of it they run away.  A dust-bin and a lumber-garret,  At most a mock-heroic play[8]  With fine, pragmatic maxims teeming,  The mouths of puppets well-beseeming!    _Wagner_. But then the world! the heart and mind of man!  To know of these who would not pay attention?    _Faust_. To know them, yes, as weaklings can!  Who dares the child's true name outright to mention?  The few who any thing thereof have learned,  Who out of their heart's fulness needs must gabble,  And show their thoughts and feelings to the rabble,  Have evermore been crucified and burned.  I pray you, friend, 'tis wearing into night,  Let us adjourn here, for the present.    _Wagner_. I had been glad to stay till morning light,  This learned talk with you has been so pleasant,  But the first day of Easter comes to-morrow.  And then an hour or two I'll borrow.  With zeal have I applied myself to learning,  True, I know much, yet to know all am burning.                                            [_Exit_.]    _Faust_. [_Alone_.] See how in _his_ head only, hope still lingers,  Who evermore to empty rubbish clings,  With greedy hand grubs after precious things,  And leaps for joy when some poor worm he fingers!    That such a human voice should dare intrude,  Where all was full of ghostly tones and features!  Yet ah! this once, my gratitude  Is due to thee, most wretched of earth's creatures.  Thou snatchedst me from the despairing state  In which my senses, well nigh crazed, were sunken.  The apparition was so giant-great,  That to a very dwarf my soul had shrunken.    I, godlike, who in fancy saw but now  Eternal truth's fair glass in wondrous nearness,  Rejoiced in heavenly radiance and clearness,  Leaving the earthly man below;  I, more than cherub, whose free force  Dreamed, through the veins of nature penetrating,  To taste the life of Gods, like them creating,  Behold me this presumption expiating!  A word of thunder sweeps me from my course.    Myself with thee no longer dare I measure;  Had I the power to draw thee down at pleasure;  To hold thee here I still had not the force.  Oh, in that blest, ecstatic hour,  I felt myself so small, so great;  Thou drovest me with cruel power  Back upon man's uncertain fate  What shall I do? what slum, thus lonely?  That impulse must I, then, obey?  Alas! our very deeds, and not our sufferings only,  How do they hem and choke life's way!    To all the mind conceives of great and glorious  A strange and baser mixture still adheres;  Striving for earthly good are we victorious?  A dream and cheat the better part appears.  The feelings that could once such noble life inspire  Are quenched and trampled out in passion's mire.    Where Fantasy, erewhile, with daring flight  Out to the infinite her wings expanded,  A little space can now suffice her quite,  When hope on hope time's gulf has wrecked and stranded.  Care builds her nest far down the heart's recesses,  There broods o'er dark, untold distresses,  Restless she sits, and scares thy joy and peace away;  She puts on some new mask with each new day,  Herself as house and home, as wife and child presenting,  As fire and water, bane and blade;  What never hits makes thee afraid,  And what is never lost she keeps thee still lamenting.    Not like the Gods am I! Too deep that truth is thrust!  But like the worm, that wriggles through the dust;  Who, as along the dust for food he feels,  Is crushed and buried by the traveller's heels.    Is it not dust that makes this lofty wall  Groan with its hundred shelves and cases;  The rubbish and the thousand trifles all  That crowd these dark, moth-peopled places?  Here shall my craving heart find rest?  Must I perchance a thousand books turn over,  To find that men are everywhere distrest,  And here and there one happy one discover?  Why grin'st thou down upon me, hollow skull?  But that thy brain, like mine, once trembling, hoping,  Sought the light day, yet ever sorrowful,  Burned for the truth in vain, in twilight groping?  Ye, instruments, of course, are mocking me;  Its wheels, cogs, bands, and barrels each one praises.  I waited at the door; you were the key;  Your ward is nicely turned, and yet no bolt it raises.  Unlifted in the broadest day,  Doth Nature's veil from prying eyes defend her,  And what (he chooses not before thee to display,  Not all thy screws and levers can force her to surrender.  Old trumpery! not that I e'er used thee, but  Because my father used thee, hang'st thou o'er me,  Old scroll! thou hast been stained with smoke and smut  Since, on this desk, the lamp first dimly gleamed before me.  Better have squandered, far, I now can clearly see,  My little all, than melt beneath it, in this Tophet!  That which thy fathers have bequeathed to thee,  Earn and become possessor of it!  What profits not a weary load will be;  What it brings forth alone can yield the moment profit.    Why do I gaze as if a spell had bound me  Up yonder? Is that flask a magnet to the eyes?  What lovely light, so sudden, blooms around me?  As when in nightly woods we hail the full-moon-rise.    I greet thee, rarest phial, precious potion!  As now I take thee down with deep devotion,  In thee I venerate man's wit and art.  Quintessence of all soporific flowers,  Extract of all the finest deadly powers,  Thy favor to thy master now impart!  I look on thee, the sight my pain appeases,  I handle thee, the strife of longing ceases,  The flood-tide of the spirit ebbs away.  Far out to sea I'm drawn, sweet voices listening,  The glassy waters at my feet are glistening,  To new shores beckons me a new-born day.    A fiery chariot floats, on airy pinions,  To where I sit! Willing, it beareth me,  On a new path, through ether's blue dominions,  To untried spheres of pure activity.  This lofty life, this bliss elysian,  Worm that thou waft erewhile, deservest thou?  Ay, on this earthly sun, this charming vision,  Turn thy back resolutely now!  Boldly draw near and rend the gates asunder,  By which each cowering mortal gladly steals.  Now is the time to show by deeds of wonder  That manly greatness not to godlike glory yields;  Before that gloomy pit to stand, unfearing,  Where Fantasy self-damned in its own torment lies,  Still onward to that pass-way steering,  Around whose narrow mouth hell-flames forever rise;  Calmly to dare the step, serene, unshrinking,  Though into nothingness the hour should see thee sinking.    Now, then, come down from thy old case, I bid thee,  Where thou, forgotten, many a year hast hid thee,  Into thy master's hand, pure, crystal glass!  The joy-feasts of the fathers thou hast brightened,  The hearts of gravest guests were lightened,  When, pledged, from hand to hand they saw thee pass.  Thy sides, with many a curious type bedight,  Which each, as with one draught he quaffed the liquor  Must read in rhyme from off the wondrous beaker,  Remind me, ah! of many a youthful night.  I shall not hand thee now to any neighbor,  Not now to show my wit upon thy carvings labor;  Here is a juice of quick-intoxicatin"]]]
