To aid him in his work Galvez appealed to the Superior of the Franciscan  Convent in the City of Mexico, and Padre Junipero Serra, by common  consent of the officers and his fellows, was denominated as the man of  all men for the important office of Padre Presidente of the Jesuit  Missions that were to be placed henceforth under the care of the  Franciscans.    This plan, however, was changed within a few months. It was decided to  call upon the priests of the Dominican Order to take charge of the  Jesuit Missions, while the Franciscans put all their strength and energy  into the founding of the new Missions in Alta California.    Thus it came to pass that the Franciscans took charge of the founding of  the California Missions, and that Junipero Serra became the first real  pioneer of what is now so proudly denominated \"The Golden State.\"    The orders that Galvez had received were clear and positive:    \"Occupy and fortify San Diego and Monterey for God and the King of  Spain.\" He was a devout son of the Church, full of enthusiasm, having  good sense, great executive ability, considerable foresight, untiring  energy, and decided contempt for all routine formalities. He began his  work with a truly Western vigor. Being invested with almost absolute  power, there were none above him to interpose vexatious formalities to  hinder the immediate execution of his plans.    [Illustration: JUNIPERO SERRA Founder and First Padre Presidente of the  Franciscan Missions of California From the Schumacker crayon]    [Illustration: MAP OF THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA, SHOWING THE FRANCISCAN  MISSION ESTABLISHMENTS. Map originally made for Palou's Life of Padre  Junipero Serra, published in Mexico in 1787.]    In order that the spiritual part of the work might be as carefully  planned as the political, Galvez summoned Serra. What a fine  combination! Desire and power hand in hand! What nights were spent by  the two in planning! What arguments, what discussions, what final  agreements the old adobe rooms occupied by them must have heard! But it  is by just such men that great enterprises are successfully begun and  executed. For fervor and enthusiasm, power and sense, when combined,  produce results. Plans were formulated with a completeness and rapidity  that equalled the best days of the _Conquistadores_. Four expeditions  were to go: two by land and two by sea. So would the risk of failure be  lessened, and practical knowledge of both routes be gained. Galvez had  two available vessels: the \"San Carlos\" and the \"San Antonio.\"    For money the visitor-general called upon the Pious Fund, which, on the  expulsion of the Jesuits, he had placed in the hands of a governmental  administrator. He had also determined that the Missions of the peninsula  should do their share to help in the founding of the new Missions, and  Serra approved and helped in the work.    When Galvez arrived, he found Gaspar de Portola acting as civil and  military governor, and Fernando Javier Rivera y Moncada, the former  governor, commanding the garrison at Loreto. Both were captains, Rivera  having been long in the country. He determined to avail himself of the  services of these two men, each of them to command one of the land  expeditions. Consequently with great rapidity, for those days,  operations were set in motion. Rivera in August or September, 1768, was  sent on a commission to visit in succession all the Missions, and gather  from each one all the provisions, live-stock, and implements that could  be spared. He was also to prevail upon all the available families he  could find to go along as colonists. In the meantime, others sent out by  Galvez gathered in church furniture, ornaments, and vestments for the  Missions, and later Serra made a tour for the same purpose. San Jose was  named the patron saint of the expedition, and in December the \"San  Carlos\" arrived at La Paz partially laden with supplies.    The vessel was in bad condition, so it had to be unloaded, careened,  cleaned, and repaired, and then reloaded, and in this latter work both  Galvez and Serra helped, the former packing the supplies for the Mission  of San Buenaventura, in which he was particularly interested, and Serra  attending to those for San Carlos. They joked each other as they worked,  and when Galvez completed his task ahead of Serra he had considerable  fun at the Padre Presidente's expense. In addition to the two Missions  named, one other, dedicated to San Diego, was first to be established.  By the ninth of January, 1769, the \"San Carlos\" was ready. Confessions  were heard, masses said, the communion administered, and Galvez made a  rousing speech. Then Serra formally blessed the undertaking, cordially  embraced Fray Parron, to whom the spiritual care of the vessel was  intrusted, the sails were lowered, and off started the first division of  the party that meant so much to the future California. In another vessel  Galvez went along until the \"San Carlos\" doubled the point and started  northward, when, with gladness in his heart and songs on his lips, he  returned to still further prosecute his work.    The fifteenth of February the \"San Antonio,\" under the command of Perez,  was ready and started. Now the land expeditions must be moved. Rivera  had gathered his stock, etc., at Santa Maria, the most northern of the  Missions, but finding scant pasturage there, he had moved eight or ten  leagues farther north to a place called by the Indians Velicata. Fray  Juan Crespi was sent to join Rivera, and Fray Lasuen met him at Santa  Maria in order to bestow the apostolic blessing ere the journey began,  and on March 24 Lasuen stood at Velicata and saw the little band of  pilgrims start northward for the land of the gentiles, driving their  herds before them. What a procession it must have been! The animals,  driven by Indians under the direction of soldiers and priests,  straggling along or dashing wildly forward as such creatures are wont to  do! Here, as well as in the starting of the \"San Carlos\" and \"San  Antonio,\" is a great scene for an artist, and some day canvases worthy  the subjects should be placed in the California State Capitol at  Sacramento.    Governor Portola was already on his way north, but Serra was delayed by  an ulcerated foot and leg, and, besides, he had not yet gathered  together all the Mission supplies he needed, so it was May 15 before  this division finally left Velicata. The day before leaving, Serra  established the Mission of San Fernando at the place of their  departure, and left Padre Campa in charge.    Padre Serra's diary, kept in his own handwriting during this trip from  Loreto to San Diego, is now in the Edward E. Ayer Library in Chicago.  Some of his expressions are most striking. In one place, speaking of  Captain Rivera's going from Mission to Mission to take from them  \"whatever he might choose of what was in them for the founding of the  new Missions,\" he says: \"Thus he did; and altho it was with a somewhat  heavy hand, it was undergone for God and the king.\"    The work of Galvez for Alta California was by no means yet accomplished.  Another vessel, the \"San Jose,\" built at his new shipyard, appeared two  days before the \"San Antonio\" set sail, and soon afterwards Galvez went  across the gulf in it to secure a load of fresh supplies. The sixteenth  of June the \"San Jose\" sailed for San Diego as a relief boat to the \"San  Carlos\" and \"San Antonio,\" but evidently met with misfortune, for three  months later it returned to the Loreto harbor with a broken mast and in  general bad condition. It was unloaded and repaired at San Blas, and in  the following June again started out, laden with supplies, but never  reached its destination, disappearing forever without leaving a  trace behind.

The gift of James D. Phelan, in  Golden Gate Park San Francisco.]    The \"San Antonio\" first arrived at San Diego. About April 11, 1769, it  anchored in the bay, and awakened in the minds of the natives strange  feelings of astonishment and awe. Its presence recalled to them the  \"stories of the old,\" when a similar apparition startled their  ancestors. That other white-winged creature had come long generations  ago, and had gone away, never to be seen again. Was this not to do  likewise? Ah, no! in this vessel was contained the beginning of the end  of the primitive man. The solitude of the centuries was now to be  disturbed and its peace invaded; aboriginal life destroyed forever. The  advent of this vessel was the death knell of the Indian tribes.    Little, however, did either the company on board the \"San Antonio\" or  the Indians themselves conceive such thoughts as these on that memorable  April day.    But where was the \"San Carlos,\" which sailed almost a month earlier than  the \"San Antonio\"? She was struggling with difficulties,--leaking  water-casks, bad water, scurvy, cold weather. Therefore it was not until  April 29 that she appeared. In vain the captain of the \"San Antonio\"  waited for the \"San Carlos\" to launch a boat and to send him word as to  the cause of the late arrival of the flagship; so he visited her to  discover for himself the cause. He found a sorry state of affairs. All  on board were ill from scurvy. Hastily erecting canvas houses on the  beach, the men of his own crew went to the relief of their suffering  comrades of the other vessel. Then the crew of the relieving ship took  the sickness, and soon there were so few well"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13858"],[0,"The Laws Of War, Affecting Commerce And Shipping (#4)"],[1,"Enemy cannot sue in this country.]    Sir William then goes on to say,         \"another principle of law, of a less politic nature, but       equally general in its reception and direct in its       application, forbids this sort of communication as       fundamentally inconsistent with the relation at the time       existing between the two countries, and that is the total       inability to sustain any contract by an appeal to the       tribunals of the one country, on the part of the subjects of       the other. In the law of almost every country, the character       of an Alien Enemy carries with it a disability to sue, or to       sustain, in the language of the civilians, a _persona standi       in judicio_. The peculiar law of our own country applies       this principle with great rigour--the same principle is       received in our Courts of the Law of nations; they are so       far _British_ courts, that no man can sue therein who is a       subject of the Enemy, unless under particular circumstances       that _pro hac vice_ discharge him from the character of an       Enemy, such as his coming under a flag of truce, a cartel,       or a pass, or some other act of public authority that puts       him in the Queen's peace _pro hac vice_. But otherwise he is       totally _Ex lex_! Even in the case of ransom bills which       were contracts, but contracts arising out of _the laws of       war_, and tolerated as such, the Enemy was not permitted to       sue _in his own person_, for the payment of the ransom bill;       the payment was enforced by an action brought by the       imprisoned hostage in the courts of his own country, for the       recovery of his freedom. A state in which contracts cannot       be enforced is not a state of legal commerce.\"    [Sidenote: No Trade permitted except under Royal licence.]         \"Upon these and similar grounds, it has been the established       rule of this court, confirmed by the judgment of the supreme       court, that a trading with the enemy, except under a Royal       Licence, subjects the property to confiscation.         \"Where the Government has authorised, under sanction of an       Act of Parliament, a _homeward trade_ from the enemy's       possessions, but has not specifically protected an _outward_       _trade_ to the same, though intimately connected with that       homeward trade, and almost necessary to its existence, the       rule has been enforced, where strong claim not merely of       convenience, but almost of necessity, excused it on behalf       of the individual.         \"It has been enforced, where cargoes have been laden before       the war, but where the parties have not used all possible       diligence to countermand the voyage after the first notice       of hostilities.[23]         \"In the last war between England and America, a case       occurred in which an American citizen had purchased a       quantity of goods within the British territory, a long time       previous to the war, and had deposited them upon an island       near the frontier; upon the breaking out of hostilities, his       agents had hired a vessel to proceed to the spot, to bring       away the goods; on her return she was captured, and with the       cargo, condemned as prize of war.\"[24]    So also, where goods were purchased, some time before the war, by the  agent of an American citizen in Great Britain, but not shipped until  nearly a year after the declaration of hostilities, they were  pronounced liable to confiscation.[25]    Where property is to be withdrawn from the country of the enemy, it is  the more satisfactory and guarded proceeding on the part of the  _British_ merchant to apply to his own Government for the special  importation of the article; it is indeed the only safe way in which  parties can proceed.[26]    [Sidenote: Subjects of an Ally may not trade with the Enemy.]    During a Conjoint War no Subject of an Ally can trade with the common  enemy without liability to forfeiture in the prize courts of the Ally,  of all his property engaged in such trade. As the former rule can be  relaxed only by permission of the Sovran power of the state, so this  can be relaxed only by the permission of the allied nations, according  to their mutual consent.[27]    [Sidenote: Contracts void.]    On similar principles, all Contracts made with the Enemy _during War_  are utterly _void_. This applies to Insurances on the enemy's property  and trade; to the drawing and negociation of Bills of Exchange,  whether the subject of this country or of the alien enemy be the  acceptor; to the sending of Money or Bills to the enemy's country; to  Commercial Partnerships. All endeavours to trade by third persons are  equally illegal.[28]    Thus also all Contracts made in contemplation of War, and which never  could have existed at all, but as an insurance against the pressure of  war, and with a view to evade the rights that arise out of war, and in  fraud of the belligerent, are illegal, even though made by  neutrals.[29]    [Sidenote: Insurances.]    The municipal or common law of every state declares all Insurances to  be void, by which ships or merchandize of the enemy are sought to be  protected. Also all Insurances by or on behalf of _alien_ enemies are  wholly illegal and void, although effected before the breaking out of  hostilities; but if both the policy had been effected and the loss  accrued before the war, the remedy is only suspended during the war.    The general principle is that the contract of assurance is vacated and  annulled _ab initio_; wherever an insurance is made on a voyage  expressly prohibited by the common, statute, or maritime law of the  country; the policy is of no effect.[30]    Thus, if a ship, though neutral, be insured on a voyage prohibited by  an embargo laid on in time of war, by the prince of the country in  whose ports the ships happen to be, such an insurance is void.[31]    Similarly, all Insurances to protect the interests of British subjects  trading without licence with the enemy are absolutely void.[32]    So also, if a Licence is not strictly pursued, so that the voyage  becomes illegal, the insurance is void.[33]    I have said that all Insurances will be void which are designed to  protect voyages or trading to hostile ports. But, for this purpose, it  must be clearly made out, not only that the port into which the ship  sails is hostile, but also, that she was bound with a distinct hostile  destination at the time of loss. Thus a policy to \"ports in the  Baltic,\" is legal, as some may be hostile, and some not, and it is not  certain that she was sailing to a hostile port.    The general principle by which the validity of a policy is to be  tested, is by the voyage, that it is a voyage prohibited by law, on  some ground of public policy. The will, therefore, of the parties is  of no account, as the prohibition is for public, and not private  benefit. So that if the underwriter is told that the voyage is illicit  he is not more bound than if he were not told so.[34]    It is Insurances upon voyages generally prohibited by law, such as to  an enemy's garrison, or upon a voyage directly contrary to an express  act of parliament, or to royal proclamation in time of War, that are  absolutely void and null;--therefore, on neutral vessels, or the  vessels of British subjects possessing neutral rights and sailing from  neutral ports to enemies ports are not void.[35]    Similarly, with respect to Insurances on neutral vessels carrying  _contraband goods_, for it is not the voyage, but the cargo, that is  illegal in that case.[36]    Insurances are good on Neutral Vessels engaged in the Colonial Trade  of the Enemy, and which was closed to the Neutral in time of  peace,[37] It must be observed, that if a voyage is illegal, and voids  the policy for that voyage, it does not follow that it voids the  voyage in the opposite direction, and even the goods purchased by the  proceeds of a former illegal voyage, may be the subject of  Insurance.[38]    [Sidenote: Bills of Exchange drawn during War.]    It has been stated above that all Bills drawn or negociated with the  enemy, whether a British subject or the alien enemy be the acceptor,  are null and void; during the last war, however, attempts were often  made to draw and negociate bills that should pass muster in our courts  of law, as for example:--    An alien enemy, during war, drew upon a British subject resident in  England, and who had funds of the alien in his hands; the drawer then  indorsed the bill to an English-born subject, resident in the hostile  country; such a bill cannot be enforced even after the restoration of  peace, for otherwise it would enable alien enemies to take the benefit  of all their property in this country, by allowing them to pay debts  out of such funds, by the instrumentality of bills.[39]    The principle seems to be,--that it is not every bill that bears the  name of an alien enemy upon it that is void, but such bills only that  are instrumental in assisting in communication with an alien  enemy;--and a liberal application of this principle has been made use  of to open a way for English prisoners to make use of their property  at home for their support in the country of their captivity. Thus,  where one of two Englishmen, detained in France on the breaking out of  hostilities, drew in favour of the other, upon a subject here, it was  held that he might legally draw such a bill for his _subsistence_, and  that he might indorse it to an alien enemy, an inhabitant of the  hostile country; for he could not avail himself of the bill except by  negociation; and to whom could he negociate it, except to the  inhabitants of the country in which he resided?[40]    Bills, like other contracts, are only void by the policy of war; but  the law still recognizes some extent of obligation between the  parties, so that bills void in their"]]]
