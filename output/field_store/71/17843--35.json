RECORD FOR THE YEAR 1892    While it is intended that the record here presented shall include  specially the lynchings of 1893, it will not be amiss to give the record  for the year preceding. The facts contended for will always appear  manifest--that not one-third of the victims lynched were charged with  rape, and further that the charges made embraced a range of offenses from  murders to misdemeanors.    In 1892 there were 241 persons lynched. The entire number is divided among  the following states:    Alabama, 22; Arkansas, 25; California, 3; Florida, 11; Georgia, 17; Idaho,  8; Illinois, 1; Kansas, 3; Kentucky, 9; Louisiana, 29; Maryland, 1;  Mississippi, 16; Missouri, 6; Montana, 4; New York, 1; North Carolina, 5;  North Dakota, 1; Ohio, 3; South Carolina, 5; Tennessee, 28; Texas, 15;  Virginia, 7; West Virginia, 5; Wyoming, 9; Arizona Territory, 3; Oklahoma,  2.    Of this number 160 were of Negro descent. Four of them were lynched in New  York, Ohio and Kansas; the remainder were murdered in the South. Five of  this number were females. The charges for which they were lynched cover a  wide range. They are as follows:    Rape, 46; murder, 58; rioting, 3; race prejudice, 6; no cause given, 4;  incendiarism, 6; robbery, 6; assault and battery, 1; attempted rape, 11;  suspected robbery, 4; larceny, 1; self-defense, 1; insulting women, 2;  desperadoes, 6; fraud, 1; attempted murder, 2; no offense stated, boy and  girl, 2.    In the case of the boy and girl above referred to, their father, named  Hastings, was accused of the murder of a white man; his fourteen-year-old  daughter and sixteen-year-old son were hanged and their bodies filled with  bullets, then the father was also lynched. This was in November, 1892, at  Jonesville, Louisiana.          3    LYNCHING IMBECILES    _(An Arkansas Butchery)_      The only excuse which capital punishment attempts to find is upon the  theory that the criminal is past the power of reformation and his life is  a constant menace to the community. If, however, he is mentally  unbalanced, irresponsible for his acts, there can be no more inhuman act  conceived of than the wilful sacrifice of his life. So thoroughly is that  principle grounded in the law, that all civilized society surrounds human  life with a safeguard, which prevents the execution of a criminal who is  insane, even if sane at the time of his criminal act. Should he become  insane after its commission the law steps in and protects him during the  period of his insanity. But Lynch Law has no such regard for human life.  Assuming for itself an absolute supremacy over the law of the land, it has  time and again dyed its hands in the blood of men who were imbeciles. Two  or three noteworthy cases will suffice to show with what inhuman ferocity  irresponsible men have been put to death by this system of injustice.    An instance occurred during the year 1892 in Arkansas, a report of which  is given in full in the _Arkansas Democrat_, published at Little Rock, in  that state, on the eleventh day of February of that year. The paper  mentioned is perhaps one of the leading weeklies in that state and the  account given in detail has every mark of a careful and conscientious  investigation. The victims of this tragedy were a colored man, named Hamp  Biscoe, his wife and a thirteen-year-old son. Hamp Biscoe, it appears, was  a hard working, thrifty farmer, who lived near England, Arkansas, upon a  small farm with his family. The investigation of the tragedy was  conducted by a resident of Arkansas named R.B. Caries, a white man, who  furnished the account to the _Arkansas Democrat_ over his own signature.  He says the original trouble which led to the lynching was a quarrel  between Biscoe and a white man about a debt. About six years after Biscoe  preempted his land, a white man made a demand of $100 upon him for  services in showing him the land and making the sale. Biscoe denied the  service and refused to pay the demand. The white man, however, brought  suit, obtained judgment for the hundred dollars and Biscoe's farm was sold  to pay the judgment.    The suit, judgment and subsequent legal proceedings appear to have driven  Biscoe almost crazy and brooding over his wrongs he grew to be a confirmed  imbecile. He would allow but few men, white or colored, to come upon his  place, as he suspected every stranger to be planning to steal his farm. A  week preceding the tragedy, a white man named Venable, whose farm adjoined  Biscoe's, let down the fence and proceeded to drive through Biscoe's  field. The latter saw him; grew very excited, cursed him and drove him  from his farm with bitter oaths and violent threats. Venable went away and  secured a warrant for Biscoe's arrest. This warrant was placed in the  hands of a constable named John Ford, who took a colored deputy and two  white men out to Biscoe's farm to make the arrest. When they arrived at  the house Biscoe refused to be arrested and warned them he would shoot if  they persisted in their attempt to arrest him. The warning was unheeded by  Ford, who entered upon the premises, when Biscoe, true to his word, fired  upon him. The load tore a part of his clothes from his body, one shot  going through his arm and entering his breast. After he had fallen, Ford  drew his revolver and shot Biscoe in the head and his wife through the  arm. The Negro deputy then began firing and struck Biscoe in the small of  the back. Ford's wound was not dangerous and in a few days he was able to  be around again. Biscoe, however, was so severely shot that he was unable  to stand after the firing was over.    Two other white men hearing the exchange of shots went to the rescue of  the officers, forced open the door of Biscoe's cabin and arrested him, his  wife and thirteen-year-old son, and took them, together with a babe at the  breast, to a small frame house near the depot and put them under guard.  The subsequent proceedings were briefly told by Mr. Carlee in the columns  of the _Arkansas Democrat_ above mentioned, from whose account the  following excerpt is taken:      It was rumored here that the Negroes were to be lynched that night, but    I do not think it was generally credited, as it was not believed that    Ford was greatly hurt and the Negro was held to be fatally injured and    crazy at that. But that night, about 8 o'clock, a party of perhaps    twelve or fifteen men, a number of whom were known to the guards, came    to the house and told the Negro guards they would take care of the    prisoners now, and for them to leave; as they did not obey at once they    were persuaded to leave with words that did not admit of delay.      The woman began to cry and said, \"You intend to kill us to get our    money.\" They told her to hush (she was heavy with child and had a child    at her breast) as they intended to give her a nice present. The guards    heard no more, but hastened to a Negro church near by and urged the    preacher to go up and stop the mob. A few minutes after, the shooting    began, perhaps about forty shots being fired. The white men then left    rapidly and the Negroes went to the house. Hamp Biscoe and his wife were    killed, the baby had a slight wound across the upper lip; the boy was    still alive and lived until after midnight, talking rationally and    telling who did the shooting.      He said when they came in and shot his father, he attempted to run out    of doors and a young man shot him in the bowels and that he fell. He saw    another man shoot his mother and a taller young man, whom he did not    know, shoot his father. After they had killed them, the young man who    had shot his mother pulled off her stockings and took $220 in currency    that she had hid there. The men then came to the door where the boy was    lying and one of them turned him over and put his pistol to his breast    and shot him again. This is the story the dying boy told as near as I    can get it. It is quite singular that the guards and those who had    conversed with him were not required to testify. The woman was known to    have the money as she had exposed it that day. She also had $36 in    silver, which the plunderer of the body did not get. The Negro was    undoubtedly insane and had been for several years. The citizens of this    community condemn the murder and have no sympathy with it. The Negro was    a well-to-do farmer, but had become crazed because he was convinced some    plot had been made to steal his land and only a few days ago declared    that he expected to die in defense of his home in a short time and he    did not care how soon. The killing of a woman with the child at her    breast and in her condition, and also a young boy, was extremely brutal.    As for Hamp Biscoe he was dangerous and should long have been confined    in the insane asylum. Such were the facts as near as I can get them and    you can use them as you see fit, but I would prefer you would suppress    the names charged by the Negroes with the killing.    Perhaps the civilized world will think, that with all these facts laid  before the public, by a writer who signs his name to his communication, in  a land where grand juries are sworn to investigate, where judges and  juries are sworn to administer the law and sheriffs are paid to execute  the decrees of the courts, and where, in fact, every instrument of  civilization is supposed to work for the common good of all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14980"],[0,"Outwitting Our Nerves: A Primer of Psychotherapy (#4)"],[1,"Count.= Ideas are not the lifeless things they may appear. They  are not merely intellectual property that can be locked up and ignored  at will, nor are they playthings that can be taken up or discarded  according to the caprice of the moment. Ideas work themselves into the  very fiber of our being. They are part of us and they _do_ things. If  they are true, in line with things as they are, they do things that  are for our good, but if they are false, we often discover that they  have an altogether unsuspected power for harm and are capable of  astonishing results, results which have no apparent relation to the  ideas responsible for them and which are, therefore, laid to physical  causes. Thinking straight, then, becomes a hygienic as well as a  moral duty.    =Ideas and Emotions.= Ideas do not depend upon themselves for their  driving-power. Life is not a cold intellectual process; it is a vivid  experience, vibrant with feeling and emotion. It therefore happens  that the experiences of life tend to bring ideas and emotions together  and when an idea and an emotion get linked up together, they tend to  stay together, especially if the emotion be intense or the experience  is often repeated.    The word emotion means outgoing motion, discharging force. This force  is like live steam. An emotion is the driving part of an instinct. It  is the dynamic force, the electric current which supplies the power  for every thought and every action of a human life.    Man is not a passive creature. The words that describe him are not  passive words. Indeed, it is almost impossible to think about man at  all except in terms of desire, impulse, purpose, action, energy. There  are three things that may be done with energy: First, it may be  frittered away, allowed to leak, to escape. Secondly, it may be locked  up; this results usually in an explosion, a finding of destructive  outlets. Finally, it may be harnessed, controlled, used in beneficent  ways. Health and happiness depend upon which one of the three courses  is taken.      CHARACTER AND HEALTH    Evidently, it is highly important to have a working knowledge of these  emotions and instincts; important to know enough about them and their  purpose to handle them rightly if they do not spontaneously work  together for our best character and health. The problems of character  and the problems of health so overlap that it is impossible to write a  book about nervous disorders which does not at the same time deal with  the principles of character-formation. The laws and mechanisms which  govern the everyday life of the normal person are the same laws and  mechanisms which make the nervous person ill. As Boris Sidis puts it,  \"The pathological is the normal out of place.\" The person who is  master of himself, working together as a harmonious whole, is stronger  in every way than the person whose forces are divided. Given a little  self-knowledge, the nervous invalid often becomes one of the most  successful members of society,--to use the word successful in the best  sense.    =It Pays to Know.= To be educated is to have the right idea and the  right emotion in the right place. To be sure, some people have so well  learned the secret of poise that they do not have to study the why nor  the how. Intuition often far outruns knowledge. It would be foolish  indeed to suggest that only the person versed in psychological lore is  skilled in the art of living. Psychology is not life; it can make no  claim to furnish the motive nor the power for successful living, for  it is not faith, nor hope, nor love; but it tries to point the way and  to help us fulfil conditions. There is no more reason why the average  man should be unaware of the instincts or the subconscious mind, than  that he should be ignorant of germs or of the need of fresh air.    If it be argued that character and health are both inherently  by-products of self-forgetful service, rather than of painstaking  thought, we answer that this is true, but that there can be no  self-forgetting when things have gone too far wrong. At such times it  pays to look in, if we can do it intelligently, in order that we may  the sooner get our eyes off ourselves and look out. The pursuit of  self-knowledge is not a pleasurable pastime but simply a valuable  means to an end.      KNOWING OUR MACHINE    =Counting on Ourselves.= Knowing our machine makes us better able to  handle it. For, after all, each of us is, in many ways, very like a  piece of marvelous and complicated machinery. For one thing, our  minds, as well as our bodies, are subject to uniform laws upon which  we can depend. We are not creatures of chaos; under certain conditions  we can count on ourselves. Freedom does not mean freedom from the  reign of law. It means that, to a certain extent, we can make use of  the laws. Psychic laws are as susceptible to investigation,  verification, and use as are any laws in the physical world. Each  person is so much the center of his own life that it is very easy for  him to fall into the way of thinking that he is different from all the  rest of the world. It is a healthful experience for him to realize  that every person he meets is made on the same principles, impelled by  the same forces, and fighting much the same fight. Since the laws of  the mental world are uniform, we can count on them as aids toward  understanding other people and understanding ourselves.    =\"Intelligent Scrutiny versus Morbid Introspection.\"= It helps  wonderfully to be able to look at ourselves in an objective,  impersonal way. We are likely to be overcome by emotion, or swept by  vague longings which seem to have no meaning and which, just because  they are bound up so closely with our own ego, are not looked at but  are merely felt. Unknown forces are within us, pulling us this way and  that, until sometimes we who should be masters are helpless slaves.  One great help toward mastery and one long step toward serenity is a  working-knowledge of the causes and an impersonal interest in the  phenomena going on within. Introspection is a morbid, emotional  fixation on self, until it takes on this quality of objectivity. What  Cabot calls the \"sin of impersonality\" is a grievous sin when  directed toward another person, but most of us could stand a good deal  of ingrowing impersonality without any harm.    The fact that the human machine can run itself without a hitch in the  majority of cases is witness to its inherent tendency toward health.  People were living and living well through all the centuries before  the science of psychology was formulated. But not with all people do  things run so smoothly. There were demoniacs in Bible times and  neurotics in the Middle Ages, as there are nervous invalids and  half-well people to-day. Psychology has a real contribution to make,  and in recent years its lessons have been put into language which the  average man can understand.    Psychology is not merely interested in abstract terms with long names.  It is no longer absorbed merely in states of consciousness taken  separately and analyzed abstractly. The newer functional psychology is  increasingly interested in the study of real persons, their purposes  and interests, what they feel and value, and how they may learn to  realize their highest aspirations. It is about ordinary people, as  they think and act, in the kitchen, on the street cars, at the  bargain-counter, people in crowds and alone, mothers and their babies,  little children at play, young girls with their lovers, and all the  rest of human life. It is the science of _you_, and as such it can  hardly help being interesting.    While psychology deals with such topics as the subconscious mind, the  instincts, the laws of habit, and association of ideas and suggestion,  it is after all not so much an academic as a practical question. These  forces govern the thought you are thinking at this moment, the way you  will feel a half-hour from now, the mood you will be in to-morrow, the  friends you will make and the profession you will choose, besides  having a large share in the health or ill-health of your body in the  meantime.      SUMMARY    Perhaps it would be well before going farther to summarize what we  have been saying. Here in a nutshell is the kernel of the subject:    Disease may be caused by physical or by psychic forces. A \"nervous\"  disorder is not a physical but a psychic disease. It is caused not by  lack of energy but by misdirected energy; not by overwork or  nerve-depletion, but by misconception, emotional conflict, repressed  instincts, and buried memories. Seventy-five per cent. of all cases of  ill-health are due to psychic causes, to disjointed thinking rather  than to a disjointed spine. Wherefore, let us learn to think right.    In outline form, the trouble in a neurosis may be stated something  like this:    Lack of adaptation to the social environment--caused by    Lack of harmony within the personality--caused by      Misdirected energy--caused by        Inappropriate emotions--caused by          Wrong ideas or ignorance.    Working backward, the cure naturally would be:    Right ideas--resulting in    Appropriate emotions--resulting in      Redirected energy--resulting in        Harmony--resulting in          Readjustment to the environment.    If the reader is beginning to feel somewhat bewildered by these  general statements, let him take heart. So far we have tried merely to  suggest the outline of the whole problem, but we shall in the future  be more specific. Nervous troubles, which seem so simple, are really  involved with the whole mechanism of mental life and can in no way be  understood except as these mechanisms are understood. We have hinted  at some of the causes of \"nerves,\" but we cannot give a real  explanation until we explain the forces behind them. These forces may  at first seem a bit abstract, or a bit remote from the main theme, but  each"]]]
