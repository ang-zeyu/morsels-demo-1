The tide of pleasure-loving humanity jostling against them had carried  their feet to the \"Lion Palace.\" From there, seated at table and  quenching their thirst with high-balls, they watched the feverish  palpitations of the city's life-blood pulsating in the veins of Coney  Island, to which they had drifted from Brighton Beach.    Ernest blew thoughtful rings of smoke into the air.    \"Do you notice the ferocious look in the mien of the average frequenter  of this island resort?\" he said to Jack, whose eyes, following the  impulse of his more robust youth, were examining specimens of feminine  flotsam on the waves of the crowd.    \"It is,\" he continued, speaking to himself for want of an audience,  \"the American who is in for having a 'good time.' And he is going to get  it. Like a huntsman, he follows the scent of happiness; but I warrant  that always it eludes him. Perhaps his mad race is only the epitome of  humanity's vain pursuit of pleasure, the eternal cry that is never  answered.\"    But Jack was not listening. There are times in the life of every man  when a petticoat is more attractive to him than all the philosophy of  the world.    Ernest was a little hurt, and it was not without some silent  remonstrance that he acquiesced when Jack invited to their table two  creatures that once were women.    \"Why?\"    \"But they are interesting.\"    \"I cannot find so.\"    They both had seen better times--of course. Then money losses came, with  work in shop or factory, and the voice of the tempter in the commercial  wilderness.    One, a frail nervous little creature, who had instinctively chosen a  seat at Ernest's side, kept prattling in his ear, ready to tell the  story of her life to any one who was willing to treat her to a drink.  Something in her demeanour interested him.    \"And then I had a stroke of luck. The manager of a vaudeville was my  friend and decided to give me a trial. He thought I had a voice. They  called me Betsy, the Hyacinth Girl. At first it seemed as if people  liked to hear me. But I suppose that was because I was new. After a  month or two they discharged me.\"    \"And why?\"    \"I suppose I was just used up, that's all.\"    \"Frightful!\"    \"I never had much of a voice--and the tobacco smoke--and the wine--I  love wine.\"    She gulped down her glass.    \"And do you like your present occupation?\"    \"Why not? Am I not young? Am I not pretty?\"    This she said not parrotwise, but with a simple coquettishness that was  all her own.    On the way to the steamer a few moments later, Ernest asked,  half-reproachfully: \"Jack--and you really enjoyed this conversation?\"    \"Didn't you?\"    \"Do you mean this?\"    \"Why, yes; she was--very agreeable.\"    Ernest frowned.    \"We're twenty, Ernest. And then, you see, it's like a course in  sociology. Susie--\"    \"Susie, was that her name?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"So she had a name?\"    \"Of course.\"    \"She shouldn't. It should be a number.\"    \"They may not be pillars of society; still, they're human.\"    \"Yes,\" said Ernest, \"that is the most horrible part of it.\"          VIII      The moon was shining brightly.    Swift and sure the prow of the night-boat parted the silvery foam.    The smell of young flesh. Peals of laughter. A breathless pianola. The  tripping of dancing-feet. Voices husked with drink and voices soft with  love. The shrill accents of vulgarity. Hustling waiters. Shop-girls.  Bourgeois couples. Tired families of four and upward. Sleeping children.  A boy selling candy. The crying of babies.    The two friends were sitting on the upper deck, muffled in their long  rain-coats.    In the distance the Empire City rose radiant from the mist.    \"Say, Ernest, you should spout some poetry as of old. Are your lips  stricken mute, or are you still thinking of Coney Island?\"    \"Oh, no, the swift wind has taken it away. I am clean, I am pure. Life  has passed me. It has kissed me, but it has left no trace.\"    He looked upon the face of his friend. Their hands met. They felt, with  keen enjoyment, the beauty of the night, of their friendship, and of the  city beyond.    Then Ernest's lips moved softly, musically, twitching with a strange  ascetic passion that trembled in his voice as he began:      _\"Huge steel-ribbed monsters rise into the air       Her Babylonian towers, while on high,       Like gilt-scaled serpents, glide the swift trains by,     Or, underfoot, creep to their secret lair.     A thousand lights are jewels in her hair,       The sea her girdle, and her crown the sky;       Her life-blood throbs, the fevered pulses fly.     Immense, defiant, breathless she stands there.       \"And ever listens in the ceaseless din,       Waiting for him, her lover, who shall come,         Whose singing lips shall boldly claim their own,       And render sonant what in her was dumb,     The splendour, and the madness, and the sin,         Her dreams in iron and her thoughts of stone.\"_    He paused. The boat glided on. For a long time neither spoke a word.    After a while Jack broke the silence: \"And are you dreaming of becoming  the lyric mouth of the city, of giving utterance to all its yearnings,  its 'dreams in iron and its thoughts of stone'?\"    \"No,\" replied Ernest, simply, \"not yet. It is strange to what  impressions the brain will respond. In Clarke's house, in the midst of  inspiring things, inspiration failed me. But while I was with that girl  an idea came to me--an idea, big, real.\"    \"Will it deal with her?\"    Ernest smiled: \"Oh, no. She personally has nothing to do with it. At  least not directly. It was the commotion of blood and--brain. The  air--the change. I don't know what.\"    \"What will it be?\" asked Jack, with interest all alert.    \"A play, a wonderful play. And its heroine will be a princess, a little  princess, with a yellow veil.\"    \"What of the plot?\"    \"That I shall not tell you to-day. In fact, I shall not breathe a word  to any one. It will take you all by surprise--and the public by storm.\"    \"So it will be playable?\"    \"If I am not very much mistaken, you will see it on Broadway within a  year. And,\" he added graciously, \"I will let you have two box-seats for  the first night.\"    They both chuckled at the thought, and their hearts leaped within them.    \"I hope you will finish it soon,\" Jack observed after a while. \"You  haven't done much of late.\"    \"A similar reflection was on my mind when you came yesterday. That  accounts for the low spirits in which you found me.\"    \"Ah, indeed,\" Jack replied, measuring Ernest with a look of wonder. \"But  now your face is aglow. It seems that the blood rushes to your head  swifter at the call of an idea than at the kiss of a girl.\"    \"Thank God!\" Ernest remarked with a sigh of relief. \"Mighty forces  within me are fashioning the limpid thought. Passion may grip us by the  throat momentarily; upon our backs we may feel the lashes of desire and  bathe our souls in flames of many hues; but the joy of activity is the  ultimate passion.\"          IX      It seemed, indeed, as if work was to Ernest what the sting of pleasure  is to the average human animal. The inter-play of his mental forces gave  him the sensuous satisfaction of a woman's embrace. His eyes sparkled.  His muscle tightened. The joy of creation was upon him.    Often very material reasons, like stone weights tied to the wings of a  bird, stayed the flight of his imagination. Magazines were waiting for  his copy, and he was not in the position to let them wait. They supplied  his bread and butter.    Between the bread and butter, however, the play was growing scene by  scene. In the lone hours of the night he spun upon the loom of his fancy  a brilliant weft of swift desire--heavy, perfumed, Oriental--interwoven  with bits of gruesome tenderness. The thread of his own life intertwined  with the thread of the story. All genuine art is autobiography. It is  not, however, necessarily a revelation of the artist's actual self, but  of a myriad of potential selves. Ah, our own potential selves! They are  sometimes beautiful, often horrible, and always fascinating. They loom  to heavens none too high for our reach; they stray to yawning hells  beneath our very feet.    The man who encompasses heaven and hell is a perfect man. But there are  many heavens and more hells. The artist snatches fire from both. Surely  the assassin feels no more intensely the lust of murder than the poet  who depicts it in glowing words. The things he writes are as real to him  as the things that he lives. But in his realm the poet is supreme. His  hands may be red with blood or white with leprosy: he still remains  king. Woe to him, however, if he transcends the limits of his kingdom  and translates into action the secret of his dreams. The throng that  before applauded him will stone his quivering body or nail to the cross  his delicate hands and feet.    Sometimes days passed before Ernest could concentrate his mind upon his  play. Then the fever seized him again, and he strung pearl on pearl,  line on line, without entrusting a word to paper. Even to discuss his  work before it had received the final brush-strokes would have seemed  indecent to him.    Reginald, too, seemed to be in a turmoil of work. Ernest had little  chance to speak to him. And to drop even a hint of his plans between the  courses at breakfast would have been desecration.    Sunset followed sunset, night followed night. The stripling April had  made room for the lady May. The play was almost completed in Ernest's  mind, and he thought, with a little shudder, of the physical travail of  the actual writing. He felt that the transcript from brain to paper  would demand all his powers. For, of late, his thoughts seemed strangely  evanescent; they seemed to run away from him whenever he attempted to  seize them.    The day was glad with sunshine, and he decided to take a long walk in  the solitude of the Palisades, to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17149"],[0,"Creative Chemistry: Descriptive of Recent Achievements in the Chemical (#4)"],[1,"off before  the lower, and finally the three kingdoms of nature will be reduced to  one, the mineral. Civilized man, enthroned in his citadel and defended  by all the forces of nature that he has brought under his control, is  after all in the same situation as a savage, shivering in the darkness  beside his fire, listening to the pad of predatory feet, the rustle of  serpents and the cry of birds of prey, knowing that only the fire keeps  his enemies off, but knowing too that every stick he lays on the fire  lessens his fuel supply and hastens the inevitable time when the beasts  of the jungle will make their fatal rush.    Chaos is the \"natural\" state of the universe. Cosmos is the rare and  temporary exception. Of all the million spheres this is apparently the  only one habitable and of this only a small part--the reader may draw  the boundaries to suit himself--can be called civilized. Anarchy is the  natural state of the human race. It prevailed exclusively all over the  world up to some five thousand years ago, since which a few peoples have  for a time succeeded in establishing a certain degree of peace and  order. This, however, can be maintained only by strenuous and persistent  efforts, for society tends naturally to sink into the chaos out of which  it has arisen.    It is only by overcoming nature that man can rise. The sole salvation  for the human race lies in the removal of the primal curse, the sentence  of hard labor for life that was imposed on man as he left Paradise. Some  folks are trying to elevate the laboring classes; some are trying to  keep them down. The scientist has a more radical remedy; he wants to  annihilate the laboring classes by abolishing labor. There is no longer  any need for human labor in the sense of personal toil, for the physical  energy necessary to accomplish all kinds of work may be obtained from  external sources and it can be directed and controlled without extreme  exertion. Man's first effort in this direction was to throw part of his  burden upon the horse and ox or upon other men. But within the last  century it has been discovered that neither human nor animal servitude  is necessary to give man leisure for the higher life, for by means of  the machine he can do the work of giants without exhaustion. But the  introduction of machines, like every other step of human progress, met  with the most violent opposition from those it was to benefit. \"Smash  'em!\" cried the workingman. \"Smash 'em!\" cried the poet. \"Smash 'em!\"  cried the artist. \"Smash 'em!\" cried the theologian. \"Smash 'em!\" cried  the magistrate. This opposition yet lingers and every new invention,  especially in chemistry, is greeted with general distrust and often with  legislative prohibition.    Man is the tool-using animal, and the machine, that is, the power-driven  tool, is his peculiar achievement. It is purely a creation of the human  mind. The wheel, its essential feature, does not exist in nature. The  lever, with its to-and-fro motion, we find in the limbs of all animals,  but the continuous and revolving lever, the wheel, cannot be formed of  bone and flesh. Man as a motive power is a poor thing. He can only  convert three or four thousand calories of energy a day and he does that  very inefficiently. But he can make an engine that will handle a hundred  thousand times that, twice as efficiently and three times as long. In  this way only can he get rid of pain and toil and gain the wealth he  wants.    Gradually then he will substitute for the natural world an artificial  world, molded nearer to his heart's desire. Man the Artifex will  ultimately master Nature and reign supreme over his own creation until  chaos shall come again. In the ancient drama it was _deus ex machina_  that came in at the end to solve the problems of the play. It is to the  same supernatural agency, the divinity in machinery, that we must look  for the salvation of society. It is by means of applied science that the  earth can be made habitable and a decent human life made possible.  Creative evolution is at last becoming conscious.          II    NITROGEN    PRESERVER AND DESTROYER OF LIFE      In the eyes of the chemist the Great War was essentially a series of  explosive reactions resulting in the liberation of nitrogen. Nothing  like it has been seen in any previous wars. The first battles were  fought with cellulose, mostly in the form of clubs. The next were fought  with silica, mostly in the form of flint arrowheads and spear-points.  Then came the metals, bronze to begin with and later iron. The  nitrogenous era in warfare began when Friar Roger Bacon or Friar  Schwartz--whichever it was--ground together in his mortar saltpeter,  charcoal and sulfur. The Chinese, to be sure, had invented gunpowder  long before, but they--poor innocents--did not know of anything worse to  do with it than to make it into fire-crackers. With the introduction of  \"villainous saltpeter\" war ceased to be the vocation of the nobleman and  since the nobleman had no other vocation he began to become extinct. A  bullet fired from a mile away is no respecter of persons. It is just as  likely to kill a knight as a peasant, and a brave man as a coward. You  cannot fence with a cannon ball nor overawe it with a plumed hat. The  only thing you can do is to hide and shoot back. Now you cannot hide if  you send up a column of smoke by day and a pillar of fire by night--the  most conspicuous of signals--every time you shoot. So the next step was  the invention of a smokeless powder. In this the oxygen necessary for  the combustion is already in such close combination with its fuel, the  carbon and hydrogen, that no black particles of carbon can get away  unburnt. In the old-fashioned gunpowder the oxygen necessary for the  combustion of the carbon and sulfur was in a separate package, in the  molecule of potassium nitrate, and however finely the mixture was  ground, some of the atoms, in the excitement of the explosion, failed to  find their proper partners at the moment of dispersal. The new gunpowder  besides being smokeless is ashless. There is no black sticky mass of  potassium salts left to foul the gun barrel.    The gunpowder period of warfare was actively initiated at the battle of  Cressy, in which, as a contemporary historian says, \"The English guns  made noise like thunder and caused much loss in men and horses.\"  Smokeless powder as invented by Paul Vieille was adopted by the French  Government in 1887. This, then, might be called the beginning of the  guncotton or nitrocellulose period--or, perhaps in deference to the  caveman's club, the second cellulose period of human warfare. Better,  doubtless, to call it the \"high explosive period,\" for various other  nitro-compounds besides guncotton are being used.    The important thing to note is that all the explosives from gunpowder  down contain nitrogen as the essential element. It is customary to call  nitrogen \"an inert element\" because it was hard to get it into  combination with other elements. It might, on the other hand, be looked  upon as an active element because it acts so energetically in getting  out of its compounds. We can dodge the question by saying that nitrogen  is a most unreliable and unsociable element. Like Kipling's cat it walks  by its wild lone.    It is not so bad as Argon the Lazy and the other celibate gases of that  family, where each individual atom goes off by itself and absolutely  refuses to unite even temporarily with any other atom. The nitrogen  atoms will pair off with each other and stick together, but they are  reluctant to associate with other elements and when they do the  combination is likely to break up any moment. You all know people like  that, good enough when by themselves but sure to break up any club,  church or society they get into. Now, the value of nitrogen in warfare  is due to the fact that all the atoms desert in a body on the field of  battle. Millions of them may be lying packed in a gun cartridge, as  quiet as you please, but let a little disturbance start in the  neighborhood--say a grain of mercury fulminate flares up--and all the  nitrogen atoms get to trembling so violently that they cannot be  restrained. The shock spreads rapidly through the whole mass. The  hydrogen and carbon atoms catch up the oxygen and in an instant they are  off on a stampede, crowding in every direction to find an exit, and  getting more heated up all the time. The only movable side is the cannon  ball in front, so they all pound against that and give it such a shove  that it goes ten miles before it stops. The external bombardment by the  cannon ball is, therefore, preceded by an internal bombardment on the  cannon ball by the molecules of the hot gases, whose speed is about as  great as the speed of the projectile that they propel.    [Illustration: (C) Underwood & Underwood    THE HAND GRENADES WHICH THESE WOMEN ARE BORING will contain potential  chemical energy capable of causing a vast amount of destruction when  released.

WOMEN IN A MUNITION PLANT ENGAGED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF  TRI-NITRO-TOLUOL, THE MOST IMPORTANT OF MODERN HIGH EXPLOSIVES]    The active agent in all these explosives is the nitrogen atom in  combination with two oxygen atoms, which the chemist calls the \"nitro  group\" and which he represents by NO_{2}. This group was, as I have  said, originally used in the form of saltpeter or potassium nitrate, but  since the chemist did not want the potassium part of it--for it fouled  his guns--he took the nitro group out of the nitrate by means of  sulfuric acid and by the same means hooked it on to some compound of  carbon and hydrogen that would burn without leaving any residue, and  give nothing but gases.
