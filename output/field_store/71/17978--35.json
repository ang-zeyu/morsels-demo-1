Is it any  wonder that so few reach any great success?    That there is an enormous lack of appropriation of energy in most  men's lives is an undoubted fact. Just where this energy is stored,  and just what its eternal significance may be, is immaterial to our  purpose.    It may be that this reserve is Nature's safeguard against our  extravagance.    It may be, as some philosophers contend, that the subconscious, with  its vast stores of energy, is a higher, more spiritual phase of man.    [Sidenote: _Drawing Power from on High_]    It may be that the subconscious is for each one of us his individual  segment of the Divine Essence--that it marks our \"at-one-ment\" with  God.    It may be that to evoke these latent energies is to call upon those  resources of our being which are the embodiment within us of the  spirit of the Creator of all things.    It may be that this Divine Essence, if adequately aroused, may exert  an absolute transcendence over material things and lift humanity to a  God-like plane.    \"What we call man,\" wrote Emerson, \"the eating, drinking, planting,  counting man, does not, as we know him, represent himself, but  misrepresents himself. Him we do not respect; but the real soul whose  organ he is, would he let it appear through his action, would make our  knees bend.\" \"I said, ye are gods,\" quoth the Psalmist. \"Be ye  perfect, even as your Father,\" was the injunction of the Master.    Whatever the eternal significance of your latent energy may be, the  fact remains that it is yours, and yours to use.    If you are to succeed, if you are to do big things, you must be a man  of \"doggedness.\" You must keep your eyes trained everlastingly upon  the vision of the thing you want. You must stay in the race until you  get your \"second wind.\" You must be master of yourself and draw freely  on your stored-up powers.    [Sidenote: _The Man Who Lasts_]    Do as we shall tell you in this _Course_ and you will become a master  man, the kind of man who \"lasts,\" the kind of man who works his  imagination overtime, the kind of man who can strain his energies to  the utmost and then, finding himself still a failure, can rise \"like  the glow of the sun\" to do bolder and bigger things--the kind of man  who wins.          CHAPTER IV    HOW TO AVOID WASTES THAT DRAIN THE ENERGY OF SUCCESS      [Sidenote: _Speeding the Bullet Without Aiming_]    We have shown you that you have within you the potentialities of  success in the form of latent mental energy. We have shown you that  your ability to achieve depends upon your ability to utilize to the  full your underground mental resources.    But success demands that you do more than merely use all your mental  energies. You must use them intelligently.    [Sidenote: _Why Most Men Fail_]    Most men fail because they speed the bullet without aiming. They fire  at random, and so bag no game.    Your pent-up mental energy is the powder in the cartridge. Its  usefulness depends upon the man behind the gun.    _To succeed in business you must intelligently control and direct_  (1) _your own mental energies_, (2) _the mental energies of others._    The course of the average man through life is an aimless zigzag. It  has neither direction nor purpose. It represents wasted energy  capriciously expended.    Mental energy is like water: it has a tendency to scatter. It is  diffusive. It seeks release in a thousand different directions at the  same time.    As a boy, first learning to write, you were unable to prevent the  simultaneous squirming of tongue and legs, all ludicrously irrelevant  to your purpose of writing. So now, as a business man, unless you have  learned the secret of self-mastery, you are unable to concentrate your  efforts, your attention is easily distracted, you exhaust yourself in  displays of passion, you are forever doing things during business  hours that have no relation to your business, you are forever doing  things in connection with your business that do not contribute to its  progress, you expend just as much energy as the accomplished executive  or the successful \"hustler,\" but you fritter it away in unprofitable  activities.    [Sidenote: _The Successful Promoter_]    To correct this is to gain mastery and power.    Concentrate your mental energies on one thing at a time. Stop  spreading them around. The promoter may have a dozen big enterprises  under way at once, but he takes them up one at a time. He transfers  his whole mind and thought from one to the next. You cannot of course  be eternally doing the same thing; but make no mistake about it, the  only way to succeed at anything is to consciously control your mental  energies. You may throw them now into this attack, now into another;  but you must always have a tight grip on yourself, or you cannot  succeed.    [Sidenote: _The Human Dynamo_]    You will often hear some \"live-wire\" business man spoken of as a  \"human dynamo.\" He has the faculty of turning out a stupendous amount  of work in a comparatively short time. How he can carry in his mind  the details of so many large projects, how he can accomplish so much  in actual, tangible results in many directions, how he can pull the  strings of so many enterprises without getting lost in the maze of  detail, is the marvel of his associates. And yet this man is never  \"hurried, nor flurried, nor worried.\" But every word and every act is  straight to the point and productive of results worth while.    [Sidenote: _Cool Brains and Hot Boxes_]    \"A cool brain is the reverse of a hot box. It carries the business of  the day along with a steady drive, and is invariably the mark of the  big man. The man who dispatches his work quietly, promptly and  efficiently, with no trace of fuss and flurry, is a big man. It is not  the hurrying, clattering and chattering individual who turns off the  most work. He may imagine he is getting over a lot of track, but he  wastes far more than the necessary amount of steam in doing it. The  fable of the hare and the tortoise would not be a bad primer for a  number of us, and the lesson relearned would not only be beneficial in  a business-producing way, but it would help us in the full enjoyment  of our work.\"    [Sidenote: _Marvelous Increased Efficiency Handling \"Pig\"_]    Progress in mental efficiency must result from the application of  knowledge of the mental machine. Just as we watch the steam-engine and  the electric motor to see that they are not \"overloaded,\" so we must  watch the mental machine, that no more power be turned on than can be  profitably employed.    This principle has already been applied to physical labor by Mr.  Frederick W. Taylor in his ground-breaking studies in \"scientific  management.\" Mr. Taylor's celebrated experiments in the handling of  pig-iron, by which the quantity handled in a day by one man was  increased from twelve and one-half tons to forty-seven and one-half  tons, \"showed that a man engaged in such extremely heavy work could  only be under load forty-three per cent of the working day, and must  be entirely free from load for fifty-seven per cent, to attain the  maximum efficiency.\"    [Sidenote: _\"Overloaded\" Human Engines_]    There is no reason why efficiency in mental effort should not be  gauged just as accurately as in muscular activity. If there are times  when your wits are not as keen, when you have not the same grasp of  fundamentals, as at other times, it is because you are mentally  \"overloaded.\" It may be the result of a great variety of causes. It  may be from too many hours of continuous mental effort. But the  probabilities are that it is the result of vexation, worry,  dissipation, or allowing the mind to be burdened with the strain of  vicious, or at least irrelevant and distracting, impulses and desires.  And so efficiency is lost.    [Sidenote: _Scientific Management of Self_]    The \"human dynamo\" is a man who long ago learned the lesson of  scientific management of his own mental forces. He does one thing at a  time, and does it the best he knows how. He directs the whole power of  his mentality to the one problem and solves it with accuracy and  dispatch. There is no more of a \"load\" on his \"gray matter\" than there  is on that of the fretting, fuming, finger-biting fritterer, but every  pound of steam is spent in useful work.    Look at the victim of St. Vitus' dance. There you have an illustration  of wasted energy. And it is mental energy, for every muscular movement  represents the release of thought power. The mental lives of most men  are equally aimless. They are lives of ceaseless activity producing  nothing.    [Sidenote: _Psychological Causes of Waste_]    Sometimes it happens that a man is not working to advantage because of  some defect in his physical make-up. He may have defective vision or  some peculiarity of hearing that renders him unable to respond as  quickly as he should to the demands made upon him. If these defects  are ascertained, it is usually a simple matter to correct the defects  by mechanical means or readjust the relative duties of different  persons so that the defects will be minimized.    [Sidenote: _Tests for Sensory Defects_]    Where large numbers of people are employed, it is comparatively easy  to use tests for discovering defects of sight or hearing by simple  apparatus without requiring the services of a high-priced expert. By  adopting these test methods any manager of a large industrial  establishment can satisfy himself whether his employees are up to  certain normal standards. He can even apply the tests to himself.    Optical tests can be conducted by securing an ordinary letter chart  such as is used by oculists and opticians. Seat the subject twenty  feet away. If he can read all the lines of letters from the largest  down to the smallest his eyesight is practically perfect.

The valley at this part being shut in by its  perpendicular cliffs with not a path to guide the traveler through the  dense thickets, is wildly picturesque and romantic in its loneliness.\"    Of the cave he says: \"This cave is a quarter of a mile east of Cave  Spring Creek, and has a wide and elevated entrance; passing into it a  hundred yards or more, the passage narrows, and in order to go further a  stream of water has frequently to be waded through; this passage has  been followed by some persons several miles without finding any object  of interest; but a few hundred yards from the entrance, by diverging to  the right, we enter a large chamber, studded with stalactites and  stalagmites, many uniting and forming solid columns of support. Many of  these are very beautiful, and often as white as alabaster. There are  other large rooms, but they possess no peculiar interest. Found large  deposits of earth on the floor having a saline taste.\"    Of the extensive pine forests in Ozark County, he says: \"The size and  quality of the timber will compare favorably with that of the  celebrated pineries of Wisconsin and Minnesota.\"    In several other counties the pine is equally good, and other valuable  timber everywhere abundant, although in a school geography published in  1838, the following descriptions of this region occur:    \"The lowlands of the Mississippi are bounded by the region of the Ozark  Mountains. With the exception of the alluvial tracts on the borders of  the streams, it is extremely hilly and broken. The mountains rise from  eight hundred to eighteen hundred feet above the streams, with rounded  summits and often perpendicular cliffs, and have a rocky surface, which  admits only a scanty growth of timber.\" * *    \"Missouri is generally a region of prairies and table lands, much of  which, as already described, is almost destitute of timber and water. It  is crossed by the Ozark Mountains, which form a rugged tract of  considerable extent. Earthquakes are not infrequent in some parts of  this state. The soil is not generally productive.\"    A comparison of these curious views with the latest official reports is  highly amusing, as well as suggestive that early impressions are liable  to require modification.    In addition to the wonderful springs of pure water, there are numerous  fine mineral springs, among which are a number of Epsom salt springs.  At Jacksonville, in Randolph County, there is a large mineral spring  from which it is said an over-heated horse may drink all he will without  injury. Epsom-salts, or Epsomite, frequently occurs, as does the Niter,  in a crystalline form of the pure mineral, as an efflorescence on rocks  in many of the caves and in other sheltered positions.    [Illustration: The Surveyed Portions of Marble Cave Stone County  Missouri    Surveyed and Plotted by Fred Prince. 1894    Scale of 100 feet]    FOOTNOTES:    [1] Lead and Zinc. Prof. C.R. Keyes.          CHAPTER II.    MARBLE CAVE.      Marble Cave, which is the finest yet explored in Missouri, is southeast  of the center of Stone County, a short distance north of the picturesque  White River. The nearest station is Marionville on the St. Louis and San  Francisco railroad, and the drive of forty miles is delightful, but can  be divided, into two of twenty each by a stop at Galena. The road, for  the most part, is naturally macadamized and is through a most charming  country whose roughness and beauty increase together as the journey  advances. At first it winds along fertile valleys between wooded hills,  crossing many times a shallow stream of water so clear as to afford no  concealment for an occasional water-moccasin, whose bite is said to be  not poisonous if inflicted under water, and which must be true because  the horses showed not the least uneasiness.    The second week in May found the vegetation in its summer beauty;  strawberries were ripe, and the weather without a fault.    Galena is pleasantly situated on the hills overlooking the James River,  and is entirely invisible from the road by which it is approached until  a slight curve in the line of ascent ends the first half of the journey  with surprising suddenness. In the immediate vicinity there are several  small caves which are worthy of attention and will be described later  on.    To properly picture the twenty miles of changing and charming views  between Galena and Marble Cave would require the light and skillful  touch of a special artist gifted with a tangible perception of  atmospheric values. Gradually the road forsakes the pretty valleys with  their fields and streams, to take the summit of the hills and then be  known as the \"Ridge Road,\" which affords a wide range of vision not  previously enjoyed, presenting scenes not to be found reproduced  elsewhere with any degree of exactness. Looking into the depth of the  forest as it slopes away on either side, the impression is of a  magnificent park, undefaced by what are called improvements. This effect  is produced by the scarcity, or entire absence of underbrush, and a  beautiful surface covering of grasses or flowering plants of all kinds  and colors, varied here and there with masses of ferns of unusual size  and delicate beauty. The most unexpected and lavish feature of the rich  display is the many miles of fragrant honeysuckle that grows only  eighteen inches high in the forest shade, but if transplanted to a sunny  spot develops into the familiar vine. The most beautiful portion of  all this is called The Wilderness, and seems designed for a National  Park. Such a park reserve, even if very small, could not fail to be a  lasting pleasure, since it would be more accessible to large centers of  population than other reserves, and its most delightful seasons are  spring and autumn when the Yellowstone is under snow.    [Illustration: A Mill-Site Near Marble Cave.]    The distant view obtained through open spaces is an undulating forest in  all directions, being apparently both trackless and endless. The great  variety of greens observed in the foliage blends in the distance into  one dark shade, then changes to dark blue, which gradually fades out to  a hazy uncertainty where it is lost at the sky-line.    As long ago as 1853, the variety and abundance of the natural growth of  fruits throughout the Ozarks was observed by Professor Swallow, who then  advised the planting of vines.    Beyond the Wilderness is the Marble Cave property and the entrance to  the Cave is through a large sink-hole in the top of Roark Mountain. This  hole is said to be about two hundred feet long, one hundred feet wide  and thirty-five feet deep. It is shaped like a great oblong bowl with  sloping sides, divided irregularly near the middle, and having the  bottom broken out in a jagged way that is very handsome and gives an  ample support to the growth of ferns, wild roses, and other vegetation  with which it is abundantly decorated. About half of the descent into  the basin is accomplished by scrambling down the roughly broken rocks,  and the balance by a broad wooden stairway ending at a narrow platform  that supports the locked gate.    For kind and valuable assistance rendered to insure the success and  pleasure of the visit to the wonderful cave, which they regard with  affection and pride, very cordial thanks are due to Capt. T.S. Powell,  former manager, his son, Mr. Will Powell, the first guide, and Mr. Fred  Prince, who has made the only official survey and map. It may be stated  here that the survey and map are far from complete, and many known  passages have never yet been entered.    Being the first visiting party of the season, certain disadvantages were  encountered in a great accumulation of wet clay and rubbish, washed in  by the rains since the previous summer; but the gate was opened with  considerable effort, and slowly and cautiously we descended the  slippery, clay-banked stairs to the immense mound of debris forty-five  feet below the gate, to behold, at last, the grandeur of the Auditorium.    The magnificence of that one chamber should give to Marble Cave a  world-wide fame even if there were nothing more beyond. The blue-gray  limestone walls have a greater charm than those of an open canon, owing  to the fact that they sweep away from any given point in long, true  curves to form an elliptical chamber three hundred and fifty feet long  by one hundred and twenty-five feet wide, with the vault above showing  absolute perfection of arch, and measuring, by the survey, from its  lowest to its highest point, one hundred and ninety-five feet. These  measurements are said to be indisputably correct, and if so, the  Auditorium of Marble Cave is the largest unsupported, perfect arch in  the world; it being one hundred feet longer than the famous Mormon  Tabernacle at Salt Lake City. In addition to the artistic superiority of  architectural form, its acoustic properties having been tested, it is  found to be truly an auditorium. The curving walls and pure atmosphere  combine to aid the voice, and carry its softest tones with marvelous  distinctness to every portion of the immense inclosed space. As a  concert hall its capacity has been tested by musicians who are said to  have been enthusiastic over the success of their experiments. Several  years ago a piano was lowered into the cave for use on a special  occasion, and still occupies a position on the dancing platform, where  it will probably remain indefinitely under the scant protection of a  small canvas tent.    The chief ornament of the Auditorium is the White Throne, a stalagmitic  mass that when viewed from the stairway appears to rest solidly against  the most distant wall, and looks so small an object in that vast space  as to render a realization of its actual measurement impossible. The  height of the Throne is sixty-five feet and the girth two hundred. It is  a mass of dripstone resting on a limestone base reserved "]]]
