Like all great cheeses it  has been widely imitated, but never equaled. Imported Gorgonzola, when  fruity ripe, is still firm but creamy and golden inside with rich  green veins running through. Very pungent and highly flavored, it is  eaten sliced or crumbled to flavor salad dressings, like Roquefort.      Hable Creme Chantilly    The name Hable Creme Chantilly sounds French, but the cheese is  Swedish and actually lives up to the blurb in the imported package:  \"The overall characteristic is indescribable and delightful  freshness.\"    This exclusive product of the Walk Gaerd Creamery was hailed by Sheila  Hibben in _The New Yorker_ of May 6, 1950, as enthusiastically as  Brillat-Savarin would have greeted a new dish, or the Planetarium a  new star:         Endeavoring to be as restrained as I can, I shall merely suggest       that the arrival of Creme Chantilly is a historic event and that       in reporting on it I feel something of the responsibility that       the contemporaries of Madame Harel, the famous cheese-making lady       of Normandy, must have felt when they were passing judgment on       the first Camembert.    Miss Hibben goes on to say that only a fromage a la creme made in  Quebec had come anywhere near her impression of the new Swedish  triumph. She quotes the last word from the makers themselves: \"This is  a very special product that has never been made on this earth before,\"  and speaks of \"the elusive flavor of mushrooms\" before summing up,  \"the exquisitely textured curd and the unexpectedly fresh flavor  combine to make it one of the most subtly enjoyable foods that have  come my way in a long time.\"    And so say we--all of us.    Hand Cheese    Hand cheese has this niche in our Cheese Hall of Fame not because we  consider it great, but because it is usually included among the  eighteen varieties on which the hundreds of others are based. It is  named from having been molded into its final shape by hand.  Universally popular with Germanic races, it is too strong for the  others. To our mind, Hand cheese never had anything that Allgaeuer or  Limburger hasn't improved upon.    It is the only cheese that is commonly melted into steins of beer and  drunk instead of eaten. It is usually studded with caraway seeds, the  most natural spice for curds.      Limburger    Limburger has always been popular in America, ever since it was  brought over by German-American immigrants; but England never took to  it. This is eloquently expressed in the following entry in the English  _Encyclopedia of Practical Cookery_:         Limburger cheese is chiefly famous for its pungently offensive       odor. It is made from skimmed milk, and allowed to partially       decompose before pressing. It is very little known in this       country, and might be less so with advantage to consumers.    But this is libel. Butter-soft and sapid, Limburger has brought  gustatory pleasure to millions of hardy gastronomes since it came to  light in the province of Luettich in Belgium. It has been Americanized  for almost a century and is by now one of the very few cheeses  successfully imitated here, chiefly in New York and Wisconsin.    Early Wisconsiners will never forget the Limburger Rebellion in Green  County, when the people rose in protest against the Limburger caravan  that was accustomed to park in the little town of Monroe where it was  marketed. They threatened to stage a modern Boston Tea Party and dump  the odoriferous bricks in the river, when five or six wagonloads were  left ripening in the sun in front of the town bank. The Limburger was  finally stored safely underground.      Livarot    Livarot has been described as decadent, \"The very Verlaine of them  all,\" and Victor Meusy personifies it in a poem dedicated to all the  great French cheeses, of which we give a free translation:        In the dog days      In its overflowing dish      Livarot gesticulates      Or weeps like a child.      Muenster        At the diplomatic banquet      One must choose his piece.      All is politics,      A cheese and a flag.        You annoy the Russians      If you take Chester;      You irritate the Prussians      In choosing Muenster.      Victor Meusy    Like Limburger, this male cheese, often caraway-flavored, does not  fare well in England. Although over here we consider Muenster far  milder than Limburger, the English writer Eric Weir in _When Madame  Cooks_ will have none of it:    I cannot think why this cheese was not thrown from the aeroplanes  during the war to spread panic amongst enemy troops. It would have  proved far more efficacious than those nasty deadly gases that kill  people permanently.      Neufchatel        If the cream cheese be white      Far fairer the hands that made them.        Arthur Hugh Clough    Although originally from Normandy, Neufchatel, like Limburger, was so  long ago welcomed to America and made so splendidly at home here that  we may consider it our very own. All we have against it is that it has  served as the model for too many processed abominations.    Parmesan, Romano, Pecorino, Pecorino Romano    Parmesan when young, soft and slightly crumbly is eaten on bread. But  when well aged, let us say up to a century, it becomes Rock of  Gibraltar of cheeses and really suited for grating. It is easy to  believe that the so-called \"Spanish cheese\" used as a barricade by  Americans in Nicaragua almost a century ago was none other than the  almost indestructible Grana, as Parmesan is called in Italy.    The association between cheese and battling began in B.C. days with  the Jews and Romans, who fed cheese to their soldiers not only for its  energy value but as a convenient form of rations, since every army  travels on its stomach and can't go faster than its impedimenta. The  last notable mention of cheese in war was the name of the _Monitor_:  \"A cheese box on a raft.\"    Romano is not as expensive as Parmesan, although it is as friable,  sharp and tangy for flavoring, especially for soups such as onion and  minestrone. It is brittle and just off-white when well aged.    Although made of sheep's milk, Pecorino is classed with both Parmesan  and Romano. All three are excellently imitated in Argentina. Romano  and Pecorino Romano are interchangeable names for the strong,  medium-sharp and piquant Parmesan types that sell for considerably  less. Most of it is now shipped from Sardinia. There are several  different kinds: Pecorino Dolce (sweet), Sardo Tuscano, and Pecorino  Romano Cacio, which relates it to Caciocavallo.    Kibitzers complain that some of the cheaper types of Pecorino are  soapy, but fans give it high praise. Gillian F., in her \"Letter from  Italy\" in Osbert Burdett's delectable _Little Book of Cheese_, writes:         Out in the orchard, my companion, I don't remember how, had       provided the miracle: a flask of wine, a loaf of bread and a slab       of fresh Pecorino cheese (there wasn't any \"thou\" for either) ...       But that cheese was Paradise; and the flask was emptied, and a       wood dove cooing made you think that the flask's contents were in       a crystal goblet instead of an enamel cup ... one only ... and       the cheese broken with the fingers ... a cheese of cheeses.      Pont L'Eveque    This semisoft, medium-strong, golden-tinted French classic made since  the thirteenth century, is definitely a dessert cheese whose  excellence is brought out best by a sound claret or tawny port.      Port-Salut (_See_ Trappist)      Provolone    Within recent years Provolone has taken America by storm, as  Camembert, Roquefort, Swiss, Limburger, Neufchatel and such great  ones did long before. But it has not been successfully imitated here  because the original is made of rich water-buffalo milk unattainable  in the Americas.    With Caciocavallo, this mellow, smoky flavorsome delight is put up in  all sorts of artistic forms, red-cellophaned apples, pears, bells, a  regular zoo of animals, and in all sorts of sizes, up to a monumental  hundred-pound bas-relief imported for exhibition purposes by Phil  Alpert.      Roquefort    Homage to this _fromage!_ Long hailed as _le roi_ Roquefort, it has  filled books and booklets beyond count. By the miracle of _Penicillium  Roqueforti_ a new cheese was made. It is placed historically back  around the eighth century when Charlemagne was found picking out the  green spots of Persille with the point of his knife, thinking them  decay. But the monks of Saint-Gall, who were his hosts, recorded in  their annals that when they regaled him with Roquefort (because it was  Friday and they had no fish) they also made bold to tell him he was  wasting the best part of the cheese. So he tasted again, found the  advice excellent and liked it so well he ordered two _caisses_ of it  sent every year to his palace at Aix-la-Chapelle. He also suggested  that it be cut in half first, to make sure it was well veined with  blue, and then bound up with a wooden fastening.    Perhaps he hoped the wood would protect the cheeses from mice and  rats, for the good monks of Saint-Gall couldn't be expected to send an  escort of cats from their chalky caves to guard them--even for  Charlemagne. There is no telling how many cats were mustered out in  the caves, in those early days, but a recent census put the number at  five hundred. We can readily imagine the head handler in the caves  leading a night inspection with a candle, followed by his chief taster  and a regiment of cats. While the Dutch and other makers of cheese  also employ cats to patrol their storage caves, Roquefort holds the  record for number. An interesting point in this connection is that as  rats and mice pick only the prime cheeses, a gnawed one is not thrown  away but greatly prized.      Sapsago, Schabziger or Swiss Green Cheese    The name Sapsago is a corruption of Schabziger, German for whey  cheese.

As their stroke slackened, the man in the bow with the tom-tom beat  more savagely upon it, and shouted to them in shrill sharp cries.  Their eyes shone, their teeth clenched, the sweat streamed from  their naked bodies. They might have been slaves chained to the  thwarts of a trireme.    Just ahead of them lay at anchor the only other ship beside our own  in port, a two-masted schooner, the _Gladys E. Wilden_, out of  Boston. Her captain leaned upon the rail smoking his cigar, his  shirt-sleeves held up with pink elastics, on the back of his head a  derby hat. As the rowers passed under his bows he looked critically  at the streaming black bodies and spat meditatively into the water.  His own father could have had them between decks as cargo. Now for  the petroleum and lumber he brings from Massachusetts to Sierra  Leone he returns in ballast.    Because her lines were so home-like and her captain came from Cape  Cod, we wanted to call on the _Gladys E. Wilden_, but our own  captain had different views, and the two ships passed in the night,  and the man from Boston never will know that two folks from home  were burning signals to him.    Because our next port of call, Grand Bassam, is the chief port of  the French Ivory Coast, which is 125,000 square miles in extent, we  expected quite a flourishing seaport. Instead, Grand Bassam was a  bank of yellow sand, a dozen bungalows in a line, a few wind-blown  cocoanut palms, an iron pier, and a French flag. Beyond the cocoanut  palms we could see a great lagoon, and each minute a wave leaped  roaring upon the yellow sand-bank and tried to hurl itself across  it, eating up the bungalows on its way, into the quiet waters of the  lake. Each time we were sure it would succeed, but the yellow bank  stood like rock, and, beaten back, the wave would rise in white  spray to the height of a three-story house, hang glistening in the  sun and then, with the crash of a falling wall, tumble at the feet  of the bungalows.    We stopped at Grand Bassam to put ashore a young English girl who  had come out to join her husband. His factory is a two days' launch  ride up the lagoon, and the only other white woman near it does not  speak English. Her husband had wished her, for her health's sake, to  stay in his home near London, but her first baby had just died, and  against his unselfish wishes, and the advice of his partner, she had  at once set out to join him. She was a very pretty, sad, unsmiling  young wife, and she spoke only to ask her husband's partner  questions about the new home. His answers, while they did not seem  to daunt her, made every one else at the table wish she had remained  safely in her London suburb.    Through our glasses we all watched her husband lowered from the iron  pier into a canoe and come riding the great waves to meet her.    The Kroo boys flashed their trident-shaped paddles and sang and  shouted wildly, but he sat with his sun helmet pulled over his eyes  staring down into the bottom of the boat; while at his elbow,  another sun helmet told him yes, that now he could make out the  partner, and that, judging by the photograph, that must be She in  white under the bridge.    The husband and the young wife were swung together over the side to  the lifting waves in a two-seated \"mammy chair,\" like one of those  _vis-a-vis_ swings you see in public playgrounds and picnic groves,  and they carried with them, as a gift from Captain Burton, a fast  melting lump of ice, the last piece of fresh meat they will taste in  many a day, and the blessings of all the ship's company. And then,  with inhospitable haste there was a rattle of anchor chains, a quick  jangle of bells from the bridge to the engine-room, and the  _Bruxellesville_ swept out to sea, leaving the girl from the London  suburb to find her way into the heart of Africa. Next morning we  anchored in a dripping fog off Sekondi on the Gold Coast, to allow  an English doctor to find his way to a fever camp. For nine years he  had been a Coaster, and he had just gone home to fit himself, by a  winter's vacation in London, for more work along the Gold Coast. It  is said of him that he has \"never lost a life.\" On arriving in  London he received a cable telling him three doctors had died, the  miners along the railroad to Ashanti were rotten with fever, and  that he was needed.     [Illustration: The \"Mammy Chair\" is Like Those Swings You See in   Public Playgrounds.]    So he and his wife, as cheery and bright as though she were setting  forth on her honeymoon, were going back to take up the white man's  burden. We swung them over the side as we had the other two, and  that night in the smoking-room the Coasters drank \"Luck to him,\"  which, in the vernacular of this unhealthy shore, means \"Life to  him,\" and to the plucky, jolly woman who was going back to fight  death with the man who had never lost a life.    As the ship was getting under way, a young man in \"whites\" and a sun  helmet, an agent of a trading company, went down the sea ladder by  which I was leaning. He was smart, alert; his sleeves, rolled  recklessly to his shoulders, showed sinewy, sunburnt arms; his  helmet, I noted, was a military one. Perhaps I looked as I felt;  that it was a pity to see so good a man go back to such a land, for  he looked up at me from the swinging ladder and smiled understanding  as though we had been old acquaintances.    \"You going far?\" he asked. He spoke in the soft, detached voice of  the public-school Englishman.    \"To the Congo,\" I answered.    He stood swaying with the ship, looking as though there were  something he wished to say, and then laughed, and added gravely,  giving me the greeting of the Coast: \"Luck to you.\"    \"Luck to YOU,\" I said.    That is the worst of these gaddings about, these meetings with men  you wish you could know, who pass like a face in the crowded street,  who hold out a hand, or give the password of the brotherhood, and  then drop down the sea ladder and out of your life forever.          II    MY BROTHER'S KEEPER      To me, the fact of greatest interest about the Congo is that it is  owned, and the twenty millions of people who inhabit it are owned by  one man. The land and its people are his private property. I am not  trying to say that he governs the Congo. He does govern it, but that  in itself would not be of interest. His claim is that he owns it.  Though backed by all the mailed fists in the German Empire, and all  the _Dreadnoughts_ of the seas, no other modern monarch would make  such a claim. It does not sound like anything we have heard since  the days and the ways of Pharaoh. And the most remarkable feature of  it is, that the man who makes this claim is the man who was placed  over the Congo as a guardian, to keep it open to the trade of the  world, to suppress slavery. That, in the Congo, he has killed trade  and made the products of the land his own, that of the natives he  did not kill he has made slaves, is what to-day gives the Congo its  chief interest. It is well to emphasize how this one man stole a  march on fourteen Powers, including the United States, and stole  also an empire of one million square miles.    Twenty-five years ago all of Africa was divided into many parts. The  part which still remained to be distributed among the Powers was  that which was watered by the Congo River and its tributaries.    Along the north bank of the Congo River ran the French Congo; the  Portuguese owned the lands to the south, and on the east it was shut  in by protectorates and colonies of Germany and England. It was, and  is, a territory as large, were Spain and Russia omitted, as Europe.  Were a map of the Congo laid upon a map of Europe, with the mouth of  the Congo River where France and Spain meet at Biarritz, the  boundaries of the Congo would reach south to the heel of Italy, to  Greece, to Smyrna; east to Constantinople and Odessa; northeast to  St. Petersburg and Finland, and northwest to the extreme limits of  Scotland. Distances in this country are so enormous, the means of  progress so primitive, that many of the Belgian officers with whom I  came south and who already had travelled nineteen days from Antwerp,  had still, before they reached their posts, to steam, paddle, and  walk for three months.    In 1844 to dispose amicably of this great territory, which was much  desired by several of the Powers, a conference was held at Berlin.  There it was decided to make of the Congo Basin an Independent  State, a \"free-for-all\" country, where every flag could trade with  equal right, and with no special tariff or restriction.    The General Act of this conference agreed: \"The trade of ALL nations  shall enjoy complete freedom.\" \"No Power which exercises or shall  exercise Sovereign rights in the above-mentioned regions shall be  allowed to _grant therein a monopoly or favor of any kind in matters  of trade_.\" \"ALL the Powers exercising Sovereign rights or influence  in the afore-said territories bind themselves to watch over the  preservation of the native tribes, and to care for the improvement  of _the condition of their moral and material welfare_, and _to  help in suppressing slavery_.\" The italics are mine. These  quotations from the act are still binding upon the fourteen Powers,  including the United States.    For several years previous to the Conference of Berlin, Leopold of  Belgium, as a private individual, had shown much interest in the  development of the Congo. The opening up of that territory was  apparently his hobby. Out of his own pocket he paid for expeditions  into the Congo Basin, employed German and English explorers, and  protested against the then existing iniquities of the Arabs, who for  ivory and slaves raided the Upper Congo."]]]
