Ordain, then, for them  every good conceived by Thee and predestined in Thy Book. Thou art,  verily, the All-Powerful, He Whom nothing whatsoever can frustrate. From  everlasting Thou hast been clothed with transcendent greatness and power,  with unspeakable majesty and glory. There is no God beside Thee, the  Almighty, the All-Glorious, the Ever-Forgiving.    Glorified be Thy name, Thou in Whose hand are the kingdoms of earth and  heaven.            XV: \"O THOU WHO ART THE RULER OF EARTH AND HEAVEN...\"      O Thou Who art the Ruler of earth and heaven and the Author of all names!  Thou hearest the voice of my lamentation which from the fortress-town of  Akka ascendeth towards Thee, and beholdest how my captive friends have  fallen into the hands of the workers of iniquity.    We render Thee thanks, O our Lord, for all the troubles which have touched  us in Thy path. Oh, that the span of my earthly life could be so extended  as to embrace the lives of the former and the latter generations, or could  even be so lengthened that no man on the face of the earth could measure  it, and be afflicted every day and every moment with a fresh tribulation  for love of Thee and for Thy pleasure's sake!    Thou well knowest, however, O my God, that my wish is wholly dissolved in  Thy wish, and that Thou hast irrevocably decreed that my soul should  ascend unto the loftiest mansions of Thy Kingdom, and pass into the  presence of my all-glorious Companion.    Hasten, by Thy grace and bounty, my passing, O my Lord, and pour forth  upon all them that are dear to Thee what will preserve them from fear and  trembling after me. Powerful art Thou to do whatsoever may please Thee. No  God is there except Thee, the All-Glorious, the All-Wise.    Thou seest, O my Lord, how Thy servants have left their homes in their  longing to meet Thee, and how they have been hindered by the ungodly from  looking upon Thy face, and from circumambulating the sanctuary of Thy  grandeur. Pour out Thy steadfastness and send down Thy calm upon them, O  my Lord! Thou art, in truth, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Compassionate.            XVI: \"PRAISE BE TO THEE, O LORD MY GOD! THOU SEEST MY...\"      Praise be to Thee, O Lord my God! Thou seest my tears and lamentations,  and hearest my sighing, my cry and bitter wailing. I am the one, O my  Lord, that hath held fast the cord of Thy mercy which hath surpassed the  entire creation. I am the one that hath clung to the hem of Thy  loving-kindness, O Thou in Whose hand is the empire of all names!    Have mercy upon me and upon all them that are in my company, through the  wonders of Thy grace and power. Shield us, then, O my God, from the  mischief of Thine enemies, and assist us to help Thy Faith, and to protect  Thy Cause, and to celebrate Thy glory. Thou art, verily, He Who from  everlasting hath inhabited the inaccessible heights of His unity, and will  continue to remain the same for ever and ever. Nothing whatsoever escapeth  Thy knowledge, nor is there anything that can frustrate Thee. No God is  there beside Thee, the Almighty, the Ever-Faithful, the Most Exalted, the  All-Glorious, the Best-Beloved.    Lauded and glorified art Thou, in Whose hand is the empire of all things!            XVII: \"MAGNIFIED BE THY NAME, O GOD, THE LORD OF...\"      Magnified be Thy name, O God, the Lord of heaven! Attire my head with the  crown of martyrdom, even as Thou didst attire my body with the ornament of  tribulation before all that dwell in Thy land. Grant, moreover, that they  whose hearts yearn over Thee may draw nigh unto the horizon of Thy grace,  above which the Day-Star of Thy beauty sheddeth its radiance. Ordain,  also, for them what will make them rich enough to dispense with aught else  except Thee, and rid them of all attachment to such as have repudiated Thy  signs.    There is none other God but Thee, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting.            XVIII: \"PRAISED BE THOU, O MY GOD! HOW CAN I THANK...\"      Praised be Thou, O my God! How can I thank Thee for having singled me out  and chosen me above all Thy servants to reveal Thee, at a time when all  had turned away from Thy beauty! I testify, O my God, that if I were given  a thousand lives by Thee, and offered them up all in Thy path, I would  still have failed to repay the least of the gifts which, by Thy grace,  Thou hast bestowed upon me.    I lay asleep on the bed of self when lo, Thou didst waken me with the  divine accents of Thy voice, and didst unveil to me Thy beauty, and didst  enable me to listen to Thine utterances, and to recognize Thy Self, and to  speak forth Thy praise, and to extol Thy virtues, and to be steadfast in  Thy love. Finally I fell a captive into the hands of the wayward among Thy  servants.    Thou beholdest, therefore, the exile which I suffer in Thy days, and art  aware of my vehement longing to look upon Thy face, and of mine  irrepressible yearnings to enter the court of Thy glory, and of the  stirrings of my heart under the influences of the winds of Thy mercy.    I entreat Thee, O Thou Who art the Ruler of the kingdoms of creation and  the Author of all names, to write down my name with the names of them who,  from eternity, have circled round the Tabernacle of Thy majesty, and clung  to the hem of Thy loving-kindness, and held fast the cord of Thy tender  mercy.    Thou art, in truth, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.            XIX: \"PRAISED BE THOU, O LORD MY GOD! I IMPLORE THEE,...\"      Praised be Thou, O Lord my God! I implore Thee, by Thy Most Great Name  through Which Thou didst stir up Thy servants and build up Thy cities, and  by Thy most excellent titles, and Thy most august attributes, to assist  Thy people to turn in the direction of Thy manifold bounties, and set  their faces towards the Tabernacle of Thy wisdom. Heal Thou the sicknesses  that have assailed the souls on every side, and have deterred them from  directing their gaze towards the Paradise that lieth in the shelter of Thy  shadowing Name, which Thou didst ordain to be the King of all names unto  all who are in heaven and all who are on earth. Potent art Thou to do as  pleaseth Thee. In Thy hands is the empire of all names. There is none  other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Wise.    I am but a poor creature, O my Lord; I have clung to the hem of Thy  riches. I am sore sick; I have held fast the cord of Thy healing. Deliver  me from the ills that have encircled me, and wash me thoroughly with the  waters of Thy graciousness and mercy, and attire me with the raiment of  wholesomeness, through Thy forgiveness and bounty. Fix, then, mine eyes  upon Thee, and rid me of all attachment to aught else except Thyself. Aid  me to do what Thou desirest, and to fulfill what Thou pleasest.    Thou art truly the Lord of this life and of the next. Thou art, in truth,  the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.            XX: \"LAUDED BE THY NAME, O THOU WHO BEHOLDEST ALL...\"      Lauded be Thy name, O Thou Who beholdest all things and art hidden from  all things! From every land Thou hearest the lamentations of them that  love Thee, and from every direction Thou hearkenest unto the cries of such  as have recognized Thy sovereignty. Were their oppressors to be asked:  \"Wherefore have ye oppressed them and held them in bondage in Ba_gh_dad  and elsewhere? What injustice have they committed? Whom have they  betrayed? Whose blood have they spilled, and whose property have they  plundered?\" they would know not what to answer.    Thou knowest full well, O my God, that their only crime is to have loved  Thee. For this reason have their oppressors laid hold on them, and  scattered them abroad. Aware as I am, O my God, that Thou wilt send down  upon Thy servants only what is good for them, I nevertheless beseech Thee,  by Thy name which overshadoweth all things, to raise up, for their  assistance and as a sign of Thy grace and as an evidence of Thy power,  those who will keep them safe from all their adversaries.    Potent art Thou to do Thy pleasure. Thou art, verily, the Supreme Ruler,  the Almighty, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.            XXI: \"PRAISED BE THOU, O LORD MY GOD! I AM THY SERVANT...\"      Praised be Thou, O Lord my God! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy  servant. I have set my face towards Thy Cause, believing in Thy oneness,  acknowledging Thy unity, recognizing Thy sovereignty and the power of Thy  might, and confessing the greatness of Thy majesty and glory. I ask Thee,  by Thy name through which the heaven was cleft asunder, and the earth was  rent in twain, and the mountains were crushed, not to withhold from me the  breezes of Thy mercy which have been wafted in Thy days, nor to suffer me  to be far removed from the shores of Thy nearness and bounty.    I am he who is sore athirst, O my Lord! Give me to drink of the living  waters of Thy grace. I am but a poor creature; reveal unto me the tokens  of Thy riches. Doth it beseem Thee to cast out of the door of Thy grace  and bounty such as have set their hopes on Thee, and can it befit Thy  sovereignty to hinder them that yearn after Thee from attaining the adored  sanctuary of Thy presence and from beholding Thy face? By Thy glory! Such  is not my belief in Thee, for I am persuaded that Thou art the God of  bounteousness, Whose grace hath encompassed all things.    I beseech Thee, O my Lord, by Thy mercy that hath surpassed the entire  creation, and Thy generosity that hath embraced all created things, to  cause me to turn my face wholly towards Thee, and to seek Thy shelter, and  to be steadfast in my love for Thee. Write down, then, for me what Thou  didst ordain for them who love Thee. Powerful art Thou to do what Thou  pleasest. No God is there beside Thee, the Ever-Forgiving, the  All-Bountiful.    Praised be God, the Lord of the worlds!"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16985"],[0,"The Proclamation of Bahá'u'lláh (#4)"],[1,"celebrateth the praise of its Lord. Some have known God and remember Him;  others remember Him, yet know Him not. Thus have We set down Our decree in  a perspicuous Tablet.    Give ear, O King, unto the Voice that calleth from the Fire which burneth  in this verdant Tree, on this Sinai which hath been raised above the  hallowed and snow-white Spot, beyond the Everlasting City: 'Verily, there  is none other God but Me, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Merciful!' We, in  truth, have sent Him Whom We aided with the Holy Spirit (Jesus Christ)  that He may announce unto you this Light that hath shone forth from the  horizon of the will of your Lord, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, and  Whose signs have been revealed in the West. Set your faces towards Him  (Baha'u'llah) on this Day which God hath exalted above all other days, and  whereon the All-Merciful hath shed the splendour of His effulgent glory  upon all who are in heaven and all who are on earth. Arise thou to serve  God and help His Cause. He, verily, will assist thee with the hosts of the  seen and unseen, and will set thee king over all that whereon the sun  riseth. Thy Lord, in truth, is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.    The breezes of the Most Merciful have passed over all created things;  happy the man that hath discovered their fragrance, and set himself  towards them with a sound heart. Attire thy temple with the ornament of My  Name, and thy tongue with remembrance of Me, and thine heart with love for  Me, the Almighty, the Most High. We have desired for thee naught except  that which is better for thee than what thou dost possess and all the  treasures of the earth. Thy Lord, verily, is knowing, informed of all.  Arise, in My Name, amongst My servants, and say: 'O ye peoples of the  earth! Turn yourselves towards Him Who hath turned towards you. He,  verily, is the Face of God amongst you, and His Testimony and His Guide  unto you. He hath come to you with signs which none can produce.' The  voice of the Burning Bush is raised in the midmost heart of the world, and  the Holy Spirit calleth aloud among the nations: 'Lo, the Desired One is  come with manifest dominion!'    O King! The stars of the heaven of knowledge have fallen, they who seek to  establish the truth of My Cause through the things they possess, and who  make mention of God in My Name. And yet, when I came unto them in My  glory, they turned aside. They, indeed, are of the fallen. This is, truly,  that which the Spirit of God (Jesus Christ) hath announced, when He came  with truth unto you, He with Whom the Jewish doctors disputed, till at  last they perpetrated what hath made the Holy Spirit to lament, and the  tears of them that have near access to God to flow....    O King! We heard the words thou didst utter in answer to the Czar of  Russia, concerning the decision made regarding the war (Crimean War). Thy  Lord, verily, knoweth, is informed of all. Thou didst say: 'I lay asleep  upon my couch, when the cry of the oppressed, who were drowned in the  Black Sea, wakened me.' This is what we heard thee say, and, verily, thy  Lord is witness unto what I say. We testify that that which wakened thee  was not their cry but the promptings of thine own passions, for We tested  thee, and found thee wanting. Comprehend the meaning of My words, and be  thou of the discerning. It is not Our wish to address thee words of  condemnation, out of regard for the dignity We conferred upon thee in this  mortal life. We, verily, have chosen courtesy, and made it the true mark  of such as are nigh unto Him. Courtesy, is, in truth, a raiment which  fitteth all men, whether young or old. Well is it with him that adorneth  his temple therewith, and woe unto him who is deprived of this great  bounty. Hadst thou been sincere in thy words, thou wouldst have not cast  behind thy back the Book of God, when it was sent unto thee by Him Who is  the Almighty, the All-Wise. We have proved thee through it, and found thee  other than that which thou didst profess. Arise, and make amends for that  which escaped thee. Ere long the world and all that thou possessest will  perish, and the kingdom will remain unto God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy  fathers of old. It behoveth thee not to conduct thine affairs according to  the dictates of thy desires. Fear the sighs of this Wronged One, and  shield Him from the darts of such as act unjustly.    For what thou hast done, thy kingdom shall be thrown into confusion, and  thine empire shall pass from thine hands, as a punishment for that which  thou hast wrought. Then wilt thou know how thou hast plainly erred.  Commotions shall seize all the people in that land, unless thou arisest to  help this Cause, and followest Him Who is the Spirit of God (Jesus Christ)  in this, the Straight Path. Hath thy pomp made thee proud? By My Life! It  shall not endure; nay, it shall soon pass away, unless thou holdest fast  by this firm Cord. We see abasement hastening after thee, whilst thou art  of the heedless. It behoveth thee when thou hearest His Voice calling from  the seat of glory to cast away all that thou possessest, and cry out:  'Here am I, O Lord of all that is in heaven and all that is on earth!'    O King! We were in 'Iraq, when the hour of parting arrived. At the bidding  of the King of Islam (Sultan of Turkey) We set Our steps in his direction.  Upon Our arrival, there befell Us at the hands of the malicious that which  the books of the world can never adequately recount. Thereupon the inmates  of Paradise, and they that dwell within the retreats of holiness,  lamented; and yet the people are wrapped in a thick veil!...    More grievous became Our plight from day to day, nay, from hour to hour,  until they took Us forth from Our prison and made Us, with glaring  injustice, enter the Most Great Prison....    Know of a truth that your subjects are God's trust amongst you. Watch ye,  therefore, over them as ye watch over your own selves. Beware that ye  allow not wolves to become the shepherds of the fold, or pride and conceit  to deter you from turning unto the poor and the desolate. Arise thou, in  My name, above the horizon of renunciation, and set, then, thy face  towards the Kingdom, at the bidding of thy Lord, the Lord of strength and  of might.    Adorn the body of Thy kingdom with the raiment of My name, and arise,  then, to teach My Cause. Better is this for thee than that which thou  possessest. God will, thereby, exalt thy name among all the kings. Potent  is He over all things. Walk thou amongst men in the name of God, and by  the power of His might, that thou mayest show forth His signs amidst the  peoples of the earth....    Regard ye the world as a man's body, which is afflicted with divers  ailments, and the recovery of which dependeth upon the harmonizing of all  of its component elements. Gather ye around that which We have prescribed  unto you, and walk not in the ways of such as create dissension. Meditate  on the world and the state of its people. He, for Whose sake the world was  called into being, hath been imprisoned in the most desolate of cities  (Akka), by reason of that which the hands of the wayward have wrought.  From the horizon of His prison-city He summoneth mankind unto the  Dayspring of God, the Exalted, the Great. Exultest thou over the treasures  thou dost possess, knowing they shall perish? Rejoicest thou in that thou  rulest a span of earth, when the whole world, in the estimation of the  people of Baha, is worth as much as the black in the eye of a dead ant?  Abandon it unto such as have set their affections upon it, and turn thou  unto Him Who is the Desire of the world. Whither are gone the proud and  their palaces? Gaze thou into their tombs, that thou mayest profit by this  example, inasmuch as We made it a lesson unto every beholder. Were the  breezes of Revelation to seize thee, thou wouldst flee the world, and turn  unto the Kingdom, and wouldst expend all thou possessest, that thou mayest  draw nigh unto this sublime Vision.          CZAR ALEXANDER II      O CZAR of Russia! Incline thine ear unto the voice of God, the King, the  Holy, and turn thou unto Paradise, the Spot wherein abideth He Who, among  the Concourse on high, beareth the most excellent titles, and Who, in the  kingdom of creation, is called by the name of God, the Effulgent, the  All-Glorious. Beware lest thy desire deter thee from turning towards the  face of thy Lord, the Compassionate, the Most Merciful. We, verily, have  heard the thing for which thou didst supplicate thy Lord, whilst secretly  communing with Him. Wherefore, the breeze of My loving-kindness wafted  forth, and the sea of My mercy surged, and We answered thee in truth. Thy  Lord, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Whilst I lay chained and  fettered in the prison, one of thy ministers extended Me his aid.  Wherefore hath God ordained for thee a station which the knowledge of none  can comprehend except His knowledge. Beware lest thou barter away this  sublime station... Beware lest thy sovereignty withhold thee from Him Who  is the Supreme Sovereign. He, verily, is come with His Kingdom, and all  the atoms cry aloud: 'Lo! The Lord is come in His great majesty!' He Who  is the Father is come, and the Son (Jesus), in the holy vale, crieth out:  'Here am I, here am I, O Lord, My God!' whilst Sinai circleth round the  House, and the Burning Bush calleth aloud: 'The All-Bounteous is come  mounted upon the clouds! Blessed is he that draweth nigh unto Him, and woe  betide them that are far away.'    Arise thou amongst men in the name of this all-compelling Cause, and  summon, then, the nations unto God, the Exalted, the Great. Be thou not of  them who called upon God by one of His names, but who, when He Who is the  Object of all names appeared, denied Him and turned aside from Him, and,  in the end, pronounced sentence against Him with manifest injustice.  Consider and call thou to mind"]]]
