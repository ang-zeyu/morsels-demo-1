[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15831"],[0,"The Scientific American Boy; Or, The Camp at Willow Clump Island (#4)"],[1,"nd, and that was by means  of snow shoes. Bill had only a vague idea of how snow shoes were made.      CHAIR SEAT SNOW SHOE.    [Illustration: Fig. 22. Chair Seat Snow Shoe]    The first pair was made from a couple of thin wooden chair seats which  we found in the shed. They proved quite serviceable, being very light  and offering a fairly large bearing surface. The chair seats were  trimmed off at each side to make the shoes less clumsy, and a loop of  leather was fastened near the center of each shoe, in which the toe  could be slipped. This shoe possessed the disadvantage of being too flat  and of picking up too much snow when used.      BARREL STAVE SNOW SHOE.    [Illustration: Fig. 23. Barrel Stave Snow Shoe.]    Another pair of shoes was made from barrel staves. At first one stave  was made to serve for a shoe, but we found that two staves fastened  together with a pair of wooden cleats were much better. Jack was the  proud inventor of these shoes and insisted that they were far more  satisfactory than the elaborate ones which were later devised.      BARREL HOOP SNOW SHOE.    [Illustration: Fig. 24. Barrel Hoop Snow Shoe.]    Now that Jack had shown his ingenuity, Fred thought it was his turn to  do something, and after mysteriously disappearing for the space of an  hour we saw him suddenly come waddling back to the shed on a pair of  barrel hoops covered with heavy canvas. He had stretched the canvas so  tightly across the hoops that they were bent to an oval shape. It was  claimed for these shoes, and with good reason, that they were not so  slippery as the barrel stave shoe, for they permitted the foot to sink  slightly into the snow.    After dinner, Dutchy came back with a book of his father's, a sort of an  encyclopedia in which several different kinds of snow shoes were  illustrated. Reddy, whose father owned a sawmill, volunteered to provide  us with strips of hickory from which to make the frames.      THE SIOUX SNOW SHOE.    [Illustration: Fig. 25. Sioux Shoe.]    [Illustration: Fig. 26. Frame of the Sioux Shoe.]    [Illustration: Fig 27. Web of the Sioux Shoe.]    [Illustration: Fig. 28. Weaving Needle]    The Sioux snow shoe was the first type we tackled. Two strips of hickory  4 feet long and 3/4 inch square in section, were bent over a pair of  spreaders and securely fastened together at each end. The spreaders were  about 12 inches long and located about 15 inches apart. They were  notched at the ends, as shown in Fig. 26, to receive the side strips,  which were not fastened together until after they had been nailed to the  spreaders. We found that the most satisfactory way of fastening together  the ends of the hickory strips was to bolt them together. When the frame  was completed, we began the tedious process of weaving in the filling or  web of the snow shoe. First we cut notches in the edges of the  spreaders, spacing these notches an inch apart. Then we procured several  balls of heavy twine at the corner store. Tying one end of the cord to  the right side stick about three inches below the forward spreader, we  stretched a strand down to the notch at the left end of the lower  spreader. The strand was drawn taut, and after making several twists  around it the cord was tied to the left side stick three inches above  the spreader. From this point the cord was stretched to the notch at the  right end of the upper spreader, twisted several times and brought back  to the starting point. The cord was now wrapped around the side stick  for a space of about an inch, and then carried down to the second notch  on the lower spreader, whence it was woven through the other two strands  and tied about the left side stick about four inches from the spreader.  Thus the weaving continued, passing the cord alternately over and under  any cross strands encountered. In order to make the left side correspond  with the right, a separate cord was wound around it, filling up the  space between the strands of the web. The filling above and below the  spreaders could not be so methodically done, but we managed to weave the  strands quite neatly with about the same mesh as used at the center. To  facilitate the weaving we improvised a rough needle of a piece of wire.  The latter was bent double to receive the cord which was wedged in  between the two arms of the needle.      THE IROQUOIS SHOE.    [Illustration: Fig. 29. Bending the Hickory Strips.]    [Illustration: Fig. 30. Frame of Iroquois Shoe.]    [Illustration: Fig. 31. Iroquois Snow Shoe.]    But the best snow shoe we made was the Iroquois shoe. The frame of this  shoe was made of hickory strips of the same width and thickness as used  in the Sioux shoe, but 8 feet long. The strips were bent in a loop and  the ends were bolted together. How to bend the wood without breaking it  seemed a very difficult problem. Wood, we knew, could be easily bent  without breaking if boiled or steamed for a while; but we had nothing  large enough in which to boil a strip of wood 8 feet long. Bill hit upon  the plan of wrapping the stick with burlap and then pouring boiling  water on it until it became sufficiently soft to bend easily. An old  oats-sack was cut up into strips and wound onto the hickory sticks for a  distance of 18 inches at each side of the center. We then repaired to  the kitchen to do the steaming. The hickory stick was held over a large  dish-pan filled with boiling water, and from this we dipped out the  water and poured it slowly over the burlap wrapping of the stick. After  a little of this treatment the stick was sufficiently steamed to permit  of bending to the required shape. The ends were then firmly secured by  means of bolts passed through bolt holes which had been previously  drilled. The frame was completed by fitting the spreader sticks in  place, after which it was laid away to dry. When the frame was perfectly  dry we started weaving the web. In this case, however, instead of cord  we used cane strips, which we had bought from a chair caner. This  necessitated drilling holes in the side sticks to receive the cane  strips. The web consisted of strands crossing each other diagonally, as  illustrated. Our second pair of Iroquois snow shoes was made with a web  of rawhide which we bought from a hardware store at Millville.      THE AINU SNOW SHOE.    [Illustration: Fig. 32. Ainu Snow Shoe.]    One of the snowshoes described in the book was very much like Fred's  barrel-hoop snow shoe in appearance. According to the description, it  was a type used by the Ainus, a peculiar people living in the cold  northern islands of Japan. As the shoe seemed quite simple and rather  unique, we thought we would make one like it. Two hickory strips each 4  feet long were bent to a U-shape and lashed together, forming an oval  about 2 feet 6 inches long by 18 inches wide. The frame was held to oval  shape by tying the sides together. Then the filling was woven in,  running the strands diagonally, as shown in Fig. 32.    We had excellent weather for snow shoes after that snowstorm. A thaw  followed by a cold spell caused a thick crust to form on the snow which  would nearly hold us up without the aid of our snowshoes. We were rather  awkward with those shoes for a while, trying to keep them clear of each  other, and we found it particularly hard to turn sharply without causing  one shoe to run foul of the other. But with a little practice we soon  felt quite at home on them. In order to prevent cutting the web with our  heels, we found it necessary to wear rubbers.    [Illustration: Fig. 33. The Norwegian Ski.]    Our vacation came to an end before we were prepared for the expedition  to Willow Clump Island. But before leaving the subject on snow shoes,  two more shoes remain to be described, namely the Swiss snow shoe and  the Norwegian ski. The Swiss shoe was made during the summer and the ski  during the following winter.      THE NORWEGIAN SKI.    [Illustration: Fig. 34. Bending the Ski.]    [Illustration: Fig. 35. The Ski Stick.]    The Norwegian ski was made of close-grained wood, 1 inch thick, 3-1/2  inches wide and 6 feet long. About 18 inches from the forward end the  wood was planed down to a thickness of 1/4 of an inch. This end was  placed in the dish-pan of boiling water, and in a short time it was  pliable enough to permit of bending. It was secured in the proper bent  position by slipping the toe end of the shoe between the banisters on  the back porch and nailing a cleat back of the heel end. When the ski  was perfectly dry the toe strap was nailed on just back of the balancing  point, and also another strap, to be secured about the ankle. Then a  cleat was nailed onto the ski to fit against the heel of the shoe. In  use we found it best to cut a groove in the bottom of the ski, so as to  give us a better grip on the snow in climbing up hills. With the skis we  had to use short poles or \"ski sticks\" to assist in starting, stopping  and steering when coasting. The ski stick was a bean pole provided with  a wooden block near the lower end, to prevent it from being forced too  far through the snow.      THE SWISS SNOW SHOE OR SWAMP SHOE.    [Illustration: Fig. 36. The Swiss Snow Shoe.]    The Swiss shoe was made primarily to assist us in exploring some boggy  land a short distance up the river from our island. The original swamp  shoes were made from the bottoms of two old baskets, and they worked so  admirably that it was decided to equip the whole society with them.  Uncle Ed, when told about them, informed us that that was the kind of  snow shoe used in Switzerland. Of course, we could not afford to destroy  a pair of baskets for each member of the club, and so we had to weave  the shoes from the willows which grew on the island.          CHAPTER IV.    TENT MAKING.      We had a farewell meeting of the society the evening before Bill and I  had to return to boarding-school. At this meeting plans were made for  the Easter vacation. We also"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15839"],[0,"The Rebel of the School (#4)"],[1,"the mistress ought not to allow such a  girl in the school. It's all very well to be on the foundation, but  there are limits. Why, her old grandfather kept nothing better than a  huckster's shop. It doesn't seem right that a girl of that sort should  belong to this school, and then take airs.\"    \"But the question is,\" said Cassandra suddenly, \"does she take airs?\"    The girls all stopped talking, and gazed up at Cassandra with  astonishment in their faces.    \"I have overheard you,\" said Miss Weldon calmly. \"I presume you are  alluding to Miss Craven?\"    \"We are talking about Ruth Craven,\" said Kate Rourke; \"and you will  excuse me, Cassie, but I never saw a girl more chock-full of pride. She  is so conceited that she is intolerable.\"    \"I heard of her yesterday, but have not had an opportunity to form any  estimate of her character,\" continued Cassandra. \"I should prefer that  you did not call me Cassie, if you please, Kate. I will watch her and  find out if I agree with you. I only noticed yesterday that she is  remarkably pretty. I will ask her to walk home with me to-day and have  tea. I should like to introduce her to mother.\"    \"Well, I never!\" said Hannah. \"And you really mean that you would  introduce that girl to Mrs. Weldon?\"    \"I think so. Yes, I am almost certain. Here she comes. I like her face.  Don't let her hear you giggling, please, Kate; it is very unkind to make  a new girl feel uncomfortable.\"    Kate smothered a laugh and turned away. The doors of the school were now  thrown open, and the girls disappeared by their special entrances.    It was just at that moment that Ruth in her shabby dress, but with her  sweet and most beautiful face, joined the group of girls who were going  into the school. She was without a companion. The other girls went in  by twos, each clinging to her special crony. Cassandra now changed her  position, and found herself within a yard or two of Ruth Craven. She was  examining Ruth with great care, but not at all from the unkind point of  view; hers was a sympathetic aspect. That little old serge dress made  something come up in Cassandra's throat, and she longed beyond words to  give her a better dress. Ruth's hat, too, left much to be desired. It  was an old black sailor-hat, which had been burnt to a dull brown. But,  notwithstanding the hat and the dress, there was the face. The face was  most lovely, and the back of the shabby frock was covered by hair as  black as jet, and curling and rippling in the sunshine.    \"What wouldn't every other girl in the school give to have such a face  as that, and such hair as that?\" thought Cassandra. \"I must speak to  her.\"    She was just bending forward, meaning to touch Ruth on her shoulder,  when there came a commotion near the entrance, and the excited face of  Alice Tennant came into view. Alice was accompanied by a tall, showily  dressed girl. The girl had a very vivid color in her cheeks, intensely  bright and roguish dark-blue eyes, light chestnut hair touched with  gold--hair which was a mass of waves and tendrils and fluffiness, and on  which a little dark-blue velvet cap was placed.    \"I am not going to be shy,\" cried the new-comer in a hearty, clear, loud  voice with a considerable amount of brogue in it. \"Leave off clutching  me by the arm, Alice, my honey, for see my new companions I will. Ah,  what a crowd of girls!--colleens we call them in Ireland. Oh, glory! how  am I ever to get the names of half of them round my tongue? Ah, and  isn't that one a beauty?\"    \"Hush, Kathleen--do hush!\" said Alice. \"They will hear you.\"    \"And what do I care if they do, darling? It doesn't matter to me. I mean  to talk to that girl; she's won my heart entirely.\"    Before Alice could prevent her, the Irish girl had sprung forward,  pushed a couple of Great Shirley girls out of their places, and had  taken Ruth Craven by the arm.    \"It's a kiss I'm going to give you, my beauty,\" she said. \"Oh, it's  right glad I am to see you! My name is Kathleen O'Hara, and I hail from  the ould country. Ah, though! it's lonely I'm likely to be, isn't it,  deary? You don't deny me the pleasure of your society when I tell you  that in all this vast crowd I stand solitary--solitary but for her; and,  bedad! I'm not certain that I take to her at all. Let me tuck my hand  inside your arm, sweetest.\"    A titter was heard from the surrounding girls. Ruth turned very red,  then she looked into Kathleen's eyes.    \"You mean kindly,\" she said, \"but perhaps you had better not. You, too,  are a stranger.\"    \"Are you a stranger?\" asked Kathleen. \"Then that clinches the matter.  Ah, yes; it's lonely I am. I have come from my dear mountain home to be  civilised; but civilisation will never suit Kathleen O'Hara. She isn't  meant to have it. She's meant to dance on the tops of the mountains, and  to gather flowers in the bogs. She's made to dance and joke and laugh,  and to have a gay time. Ah! my people at home made a fine mistake when  they sent me to be civilised. But I like you, honey. I like the shape of  your face, and the way you are made, and the wonderful look in your eyes  when you glance round at me. It is you and me will be the finest of  friends, sha'n't we?\"    Before Ruth could reply the girls had entered the great hall, which  presently became quite full.    \"Don't let go of me, darling, for the life of you. It's lost I'd be in a  place of this sort. Let me clutch on to you until they put me into the  lowest place in the school.\"    \"But why so?\" asked Ruth, glancing at her tall companion in some  astonishment. \"Don't you know anything?\"    \"I? Never a bit, darling. I don't suppose they'll keep me here. I have  no learning, and I never want to have any, and what's more--\"    \"Hush, girls! No talking,\" called the indignant voice of a form-room  mistress.    Kathleen's dark-blue eyes grew round with laughter. She suddenly dropped  a curtsy.    \"Mum's the word, ma'am,\" she said, and then she glanced round at her  numerous companions.    The girls had all been watching her. Their faces broke into smiles, the  smiles became titters, and the titters roars. The mistress had again to  come forward and ask what was wrong.    \"It's only me, miss,\" said Kathleen, \"so don't blame any of the other  innocent lambs. I'm fresh from old Ireland. Oh, miss, it's a beautiful  country! Were you never there? If you could only behold her purple  mountains, and let yourself go on the bosom of her rushing streams! Were  you ever in the old country, miss, if I might venture to ask a civil  question?\"    \"No,\" said Miss Atherton in a very suppressing tone. \"I don't understand  impertinent questions, and I expect the schoolgirls to be orderly.--Ah,  Ruth Craven! Will you take this young lady under your wing?\"    \"Didn't I say we were to be mates, dear?\" said Kathleen O'Hara; and as  they passed from the great hall, Kathleen's hand was still fondly linked  on Ruth's arm.          CHAPTER III.    THE WILD IRISH GIRL.      Lessons went on in their usual orderly fashion. At eleven o'clock there  was a break for a quarter of an hour. The girls streamed into the  playground. The playground was very large, and was asphalted, and in  consequence quite dry and pleasant to walk on. There was a field just  beyond, and into this field the girls now strolled by twos and twos.  Kathleen O'Hara clung to Ruth Craven's arm; she kept talking to her and  asking her questions.    \"You needn't reply unless you like, pet,\" she said. \"All I want is just  to look into your face. I adore beauty; I worship it more than anything  else on earth. I was brought up in the midst of it. I never saw anything  uglier than poor old Towser when he broke his leg and cut his upper jaw;  but although he was ugly, he was the darling of my heart. He died, and I  cried a lot. I can't quite get over it. Yes, I suppose I am uncivilised,  and I never want to be anything else. Do you think I want to copy those  nimby-pimby girls over there, or that lot, or that?\"    \"You had better not point, please, Miss O'Hara,\" said Ruth. \"They won't  like it.\"    \"What do I care whether they like it or not?\" said Kathleen. \"I wasn't  brought here to curry favor with them. What would my darling father say  if I told him that I was going to curry favor with the girls of the  Great Shirley School? And what would mother say? No, no; I may pick up  a few smatterings, or I may not, but there is one thing certain: I mean  to make a friend of you, Ruth--yes, a great big bosom friend. You will  be fond of me, won't you?\"    \"I like you now,\" said Ruth. \"I know you are kind, and you are very  pretty.\"    \"Why, then, darling,\" said Kathleen, \"is it the Blarney Stone you have  kissed? You have a sweet little voice of your own, although it hasn't  the dear touch of the brogue that I miss so in all the other girls.\"    \"But you like Miss Tennant don't you?\" said Ruth.    \"Oh, yes. Poor little Alice! She's very reserved and very, very formal,  but she's a good soul, and I won't worry her. But you are the one my  heart has gone out to. Ah! that is the way of Irish hearts. They go  straight out to their kindred spirits. You are a kindred spirit of mine,  Ruth Craven, and you can't get away from me, not even if you will.\"    The fifteen minutes for recreation came to an end, and the girls  returned to the schoolroom. Ruth was in a high class for her age, and  was already absorbed in her work. Kathleen drummed with her fingers on  her desk and looked round her. Kathleen was in a low class; she was with  girls a great deal smaller and younger than herself.    \"How old are you, Miss O'Hara?\" the English teacher, Miss Dove, had  said.    \"I am fifteen, bless your heart, darling!\" replied Kathleen.    \"Don't talk exactly like that,\" said Miss Dove, who, in spite of  herself, was attracted by the sweet voice and sweeter eyes. \"Say, 'I am  fifteen, Miss Dove.'\"    Kathleen made a grimace. Her grimace was so comical that all the small"]]]
