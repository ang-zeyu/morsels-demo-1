[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15561"],[0,"The Boer in Peace and War (#4)"],[1," any ordinary  person that a Boer, no matter if he can count his sovereigns by the  million, would never dream of giving up his farm and turning country  gentleman. He may take no part in the actual work (and this is not  much in his line under any circumstances), but he exercises that  amount of careful supervision necessary to successful farming, and  continues to do so until the end. Even the members of the Volksraad,  who are usually well-to-do farmers, never neglect their crops, albeit  a handsome income is assured in their official capacity.    But does farming in the Dutch Republics pay? Most emphatically, No. I  am not making this assertion because I have tried it myself, I am  simply quoting the dictum of every Boer. I have been careful to  obtain a consensus of opinion on this question for the guidance of  those who may contemplate embarking upon such an unsatisfactory and  dangerous undertaking. Farming does not pay. For my own satisfaction,  I recently questioned a Boer with regard to his average yearly income,  and he was good enough to humour me.    The value of his stock worked out as follows:         1,000 sheep             say   L 500         100 head of cattle     \"     1000          48 horses             \"      480                                     -----                                     L1980                                     -----                                                    L   s. d.  His yearly clip averaged 10 bales @  L10  =  100  0  0  On an average he sold:    20 head of cattle               \"  L 8  =  160  0  0    10 horses                       \"  L10  =  100  0  0    Butter, 1,000 pounds            \"   1s. =   50  0  0    Hides and skin                        say    5  0  0    Horns                                  \"     1  0  0    Mealies, 60 bags                \"  12s. =   36  0  0    Forage, 5,000 bundles           \"   3d. =   62 10  0    Kaffir corn, 30 bags            \"  15s. =   22 10  0                                              -----------  Total average yearly income                 L537  0  0                                              -----------    It must not be supposed for one moment that here we have a rich man. I  am merely citing the case of a farmer who said to me: 'I'd rather be a  book-keeper at twenty-pounds a month.' He had no idea that his annual  income figured up to anything like L537. And yet that same man would  endeavour to make a good bargain in purchasing sixpennyworth of  hairpins because he considered himself a 'poor man.'    There are hundreds of farmers, more particularly in the Free State,  who are unable to realize the extent of their wealth in stock or the  acreage of their own farms. They brand every ox, sheep, and horse that  belongs to them, and it is only by such marks that they are enabled to  recognise their own property when they see it. I have known instances  where hundreds of horses belonging to one man have succumbed in a  single season on account of horse-sickness, and their owner regarded  the loss as a mere trifle, because he knew that such a catastrophe did  not materially affect his position.    Klondyke had its 'millionaires in huts,' Boerland has its millionaires  in hovels. You will find farmers who are worth many thousands of  pounds living in places under whose roofs a Kaffir would certainly  disdain to pass the night. They possess wives and families, too, but  they exhibit no desire to better their domestic surroundings. If the  houses happen to include another room other than the living room, that  extra room is invariably used for storing grain. The women are untidy  and unprepossessing, and the children have not yet learned to  appreciate stockings and shoes. It is almost paradoxical to think of  human beings in a civilized country living such lives, people who have  great possibilities within their reach. The children readily  assimilate the habits and ways of their parents, and grow up into men  and women of a like type, and so on from generation to generation. No  wonder, then, that the Boers are a retrograde race.    [Illustration: A BOER FAMILY.]    It has been made sufficiently plain that when once the Boers have  acquired a country, they allow that country to rest in peace--from  an agricultural point of view only. This is quite apparent when it is  explained that the Free State has an estimated acreage of 7,491,500,  and out of that only 75,000 acres are cultivated. This is not the  fault of the country, but of the Boer himself. He has no sooner  settled down on a bit of land, where there is a plentiful growth of  grass to feed his stock, than he longs for pastures new, his only  reason for staying where he is being that he does not want the  Englishman to step into his homestead.    No exhibition of national prejudice is intended when I say that were  the Dutch Republics sprinkled with a few hundred Scottish farmers,  these countries would assume a more fertile and healthy aspect in two  or three years. The soil is good; all that is wanted is concentrated  hard work, and the countries would surprise several people--the Boers,  for instance--by the extent of their agricultural wealth. There are,  of course, climatic disadvantages to contend against--prolonged  droughts are of common occurrence--but, as in other countries, the  farmer must take the bad with the good. The great thing with the Boer  is stock, and plenty of it. He does not care about anything else until  the rinderpest comes.    Comparisons are odious, but let us compare the Boer with the English  farmers. Should the harvests of the latter be destroyed (as in the  case of an entire county of farmers in England at one time), ruin  stares them in the face, showing that stock is of little moment. It is  different in the case of the Boer. Take his stock away from him, and  you deprive him of his daily bread. Of course, the facilities for  successful cultivation in England are different from those in the  Dutch Republics; at the same time, there is such a thing as  irrigation, and were this resorted to more generally, and a larger  area of land put under cultivation, the Boer farmer would be on a more  stable footing.    A somewhat erroneous deduction has been gleaned by many people from  guide-books, in which particulars are given respecting the limited  extent of arable land available, but guide-book makers mostly prefer  to guess at the figures rather than go to the trouble of ascertaining  the truth. Without further reference to the guide-books, it is  noteworthy that the possibilities of both the Transvaal and Free State,  from an agricultural point of view, are greatly under-estimated, the  fact being that a very small proportion of arable land is cultivated at  all. In a number of cases water facilities are entirely ignored.    Wool is the current coin of the country with the Boer farmers, and the  merchant who is desirous of continuing his business must have a  certain amount of capital behind him, because the farmer likes to see  money at least once a year. Things have changed somewhat now. In the  olden days it was different. It was absolutely necessary then to put  down a cheque for the full amount, but the average farmer is becoming  less suspicious in transactions of this nature.    The life of the merchant during the wool season is not exactly a happy  one. He likes to please his customers, but he does not always  succeed. The average farmer who comes in with a load of wool has the  appearance of a man whose primary intention is to buy up all the  stores (although he may go away with a bag of coffee only), and  afterwards consider with great deliberation the question of acquiring  the whole town. All this is based upon the fact that he has a load of  wool for sale. The merchant would rather give him five shillings than  fivepence per pound, because it would be a certain sign that the good  times had arrived. No matter, however, what price the merchant offers,  your average farmer can always obtain more. He does not say where; he  prefers to keep that up his sleeve. He also advances by farthings and  halfpence, because he is chary about entering into the intricacies of  eighths. He, moreover, strongly objects to accepting a lower price  than that given to his neighbour. His neighbour may be an excellent  man, and he may be in possession of very good sheep, but that his wool  should be more valuable is not so apparent--is, in fact, most  improbable. Every farmer has implicit faith in the merits of his own  particular clip, and if differences really exist, he is prepared to  state emphatically that the advantage is on his side.          CHAPTER IV      There has been a good deal of speculation as to why the Boers are such  experts with the rifle, but that is easily and naturally explained. In  the first place, they know their own country, and that is a decided  advantage where bare veldt is concerned. An Englishman on the same  ground would make mistakes, and probably sight his rifle at 200 yards;  but the Boer puts his up to 500 yards and kills his game, whilst the  Englishman, with his imperfect knowledge of the country, misses it.  When the Dutch first settled in South Africa, they were compelled  either to shoot their dinner or go without. So they began straight  away by shooting their dinner--and they have been able to shoot it  ever since. In warfare, too, they know exactly how to proceed. They  know that it is policy to shoot the Englishmen and save their own  skins. So they get behind large stones and shoot the Englishmen. They  know, further, that the best guarantee of success is to wait  patiently. They know nothing about military discipline, and they don't  want to know anything about it. According to their idea, this is how  the crack British regiments proceed: They march up in a body--close  order--and when they come within range of the Boers the commanding  officer gives the following commands: 'Halt! Attention! "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1557"],[0,"Men of Iron (#4)"],[1,"nd, seeing its length,  looked vexed. Then he read for an earnest moment or two, skipping from  line to line. Presently he folded the letter and thrust it into the  pouch at his side. \"So it is, your Grace,\" said he to the lordly  prelate, \"that we who have luck to rise in the world must ever suffer by  being plagued at all times and seasons. Here is one I chanced to know a  dozen years ago, who thinks he hath a claim upon me, and saddles me  with his son. I must e'en take the lad, too, for the sake of peace and  quietness.\" He glanced around, and seeing Gascoyne, who had drawn near,  beckoned to him. \"Take me this fellow,\" said he, \"to the buttery, and  see him fed; and then to Sir James Lee, and have his name entered in the  castle books. And stay, sirrah,\" he added; \"bid me Sir James, if it may  be so done, to enter him as a squire-at-arms. Methinks he will be better  serving so than in the household, for he appeareth a soothly rough cub  for a page.\"    Myles did look rustic enough, standing clad in frieze in the midst of  that gay company, and a murmur of laughter sounded around, though he  was too bewildered to fully understand that he was the cause of the  merriment. Then some hand drew him back--it was Gascoyne's--there was a  bustle of people passing, and the next minute they were gone, and  Myles and old Diccon Bowman and the young squire were left alone in the  anteroom.    Gascoyne looked very sour and put out. \"Murrain upon it!\" said he; \"here  is good sport spoiled for me to see thee fed. I wish no ill to thee,  friend, but I would thou hadst come this afternoon or to-morrow.\"    \"Methinks I bring trouble and dole to every one,\" said Myles, somewhat  bitterly. \"It would have been better had I never come to this place,  methinks.\"    His words and tone softened Gascoyne a little. \"Ne'er mind,\" said the  squire; \"it was not thy fault, and is past mending now. So come and fill  thy stomach, in Heaven's name.\"    Perhaps not the least hard part of the whole trying day for Myles  was his parting with Diccon. Gascoyne and he had accompanied the old  retainer to the outer gate, in the archway of which they now stood; for  without a permit they could go no farther. The old bowman led by the  bridle-rein the horse upon which Myles had ridden that morning. His own  nag, a vicious brute, was restive to be gone, but Diccon held him in  with tight rein. He reached down, and took Myles's sturdy brown hand in  his crooked, knotted grasp.    \"Farewell, young master,\" he croaked, tremulously, with a watery glimmer  in his pale eyes. \"Thou wilt not forget me when I am gone?\"    \"Nay,\" said Myles; \"I will not forget thee.\"    \"Aye, aye,\" said the old man, looking down at him, and shaking his head  slowly from side to side; \"thou art a great tall sturdy fellow now, yet  have I held thee on my knee many and many's the time, and dandled thee  when thou wert only a little weeny babe. Be still, thou devil's limb!\"  he suddenly broke off, reining back his restive raw-boned steed,  which began again to caper and prance. Myles was not sorry for the  interruption; he felt awkward and abashed at the parting, and at the old  man's reminiscences, knowing that Gascoyne's eyes were resting amusedly  upon the scene, and that the men-at-arms were looking on. Certainly  old Diccon did look droll as he struggled vainly with his vicious  high-necked nag. \"Nay, a murrain on thee! an' thou wilt go, go!\" cried  he at last, with a savage dig of his heels into the animal's ribs,  and away they clattered, the led-horse kicking up its heels as a final  parting, setting Gascoyne fairly alaughing. At the bend of the road the  old man turned and nodded his head; the next moment he had disappeared  around the angle of the wall, and it seemed to Myles, as he stood  looking after him, as though the last thread that bound him to his  old life had snapped and broken. As he turned he saw that Gascoyne was  looking at him.    \"Dost feel downhearted?\" said the young squire, curiously.    \"Nay,\" said Myles, brusquely. Nevertheless his throat was tight and dry,  and the word came huskily in spite of himself.        CHAPTER 5    THE EARL of Mackworth, as was customary among the great lords in those  days, maintained a small army of knights, gentlemen, men-at-arms, and  retainers, who were expected to serve him upon all occasions of need,  and from whom were supplied his quota of recruits to fill such levies as  might be made upon him by the King in time of war.    The knights and gentlemen of this little army of horse and foot soldiers  were largely recruited from the company of squires and bachelors, as the  young novitiate soldiers of the castle were called.    This company of esquires consisted of from eighty to ninety lads,  ranging in age from eight to twenty years. Those under fourteen years  were termed pages, and served chiefly the Countess and her waiting  gentlewomen, in whose company they acquired the graces and polish of the  times, such as they were. After reaching the age of fourteen the lads  were entitled to the name of esquire or squire.    In most of the great houses of the time the esquires were the especial  attendants upon the Lord and Lady of the house, holding such positions  as body-squires, cup-bearers, carvers, and sometimes the office of  chamberlain. But Devlen, like some other of the princely castles of the  greatest nobles, was more like a military post or a fortress than an  ordinary household. Only comparatively few of the esquires could be  used in personal attendance upon the Earl; the others were trained  more strictly in arms, and served rather in the capacity of a sort of  body-guard than as ordinary squires. For, as the Earl rose in power and  influence, and as it so became well worth while for the lower nobility  and gentry to enter their sons in his family, the body of squires became  almost cumbersomely large. Accordingly, that part which comprised the  squires proper, as separate from the younger pages, was divided into  three classes--first, squires of the body, who were those just past  pagehood, and who waited upon the Earl in personal service; second,  squires of the household, who, having regular hours assigned for  exercise in the manual of arms, were relieved from personal service  excepting upon especial occasions; and thirdly and lastly, at the head  of the whole body of lads, a class called bachelors--young men ranging  from eighteen to twenty years of age. This class was supposed to  exercise a sort of government over the other and younger squires--to  keep them in order as much as possible, to marshal them upon occasions  of importance, to see that their arms and equipments were kept in good  order, to call the roll for chapel in the morning, and to see that those  not upon duty in the house were present at the daily exercise at arms.  Orders to the squires were generally transmitted through the bachelors,  and the head of that body was expected to make weekly reports of affairs  in their quarters to the chief captain of the body.    From this overlordship of the bachelors there had gradually risen a  system of fagging, such as is or was practised in the great English  public schools--enforced services exacted from the younger lads--which  at the time Myles came to Devlen had, in the five or six years it had  been in practice, grown to be an absolute though unwritten law of the  body--a law supported by all the prestige of long-continued usage. At  that time the bachelors numbered but thirteen, yet they exercised over  the rest of the sixty-four squires and pages a rule of iron, and were  taskmasters, hard, exacting, and oftentimes cruel.    The whole company of squires and pages was under the supreme command of  a certain one-eyed knight, by name Sir James Lee; a soldier seasoned by  the fire of a dozen battles, bearing a score of wounds won in fight and  tourney, and withered by hardship and labor to a leather-like toughness.  He had fought upon the King's side in all the late wars, and had at  Shrewsbury received a wound that unfitted him for active service, so  that now he was fallen to the post of Captain of Esquires at Devlen  Castle--a man disappointed in life, and with a temper imbittered by that  failure as well as by cankering pain.    Yet Perhaps no one could have been better fitted for the place he held  than Sir James Lee. The lads under his charge were a rude, rough, unruly  set, quick, like their elders, to quarrel, and to quarrel fiercely, even  to the drawing of sword or dagger. But there was a cold, iron sternness  about the grim old man that quelled them, as the trainer with a lash of  steel might quell a den of young wolves. The apartments in which he was  lodged, with his clerk, were next in the dormitory of the lads, and  even in the midst of the most excited brawlings the distant sound of his  harsh voice, \"Silence, messieurs!\" would bring an instant hush to the  loudest uproar.    It was into his grim presence that Myles was introduced by Gascoyne.  Sir James was in his office, a room bare of ornament or adornment or  superfluous comfort of any sort--without even so much as a mat of rushes  upon the cold stone pavement to make it less cheerless. The old one-eyed  knight sat gnawing his bristling mustaches. To anyone who knew him it  would have been apparent that, as the castle phrase went, \"the devil sat  astride of his neck,\" which meant that some one of his blind wounds was  aching more sorely than usual.    His clerk sat beside him, with account-books and parchment spread upon  the table, and the head squire, Walter Blunt, a lad some three or four  years older than Myles, and half a head taller, black-browed, powerfully  built, and with cheek and chin darkened by the soft budding of his  adolescent beard, stood making his report.    Sir James listened in grim silence while Gascoyne told his errand.    \"So, then, pardee, I am bid to take another one of ye, am I?\" he"]]]
