You will never be happy unless you realize that you can make  and remake your own soul.    These simple principles and the absence of all dogmas as to God or  Brahman distinguish the teaching of Gotama from most Indian systems, but  he accepted the usual Indian beliefs about Karma and rebirth and with  them the usual conclusion that release from the series of rebirths is  the _summum bonum_. This deliverance he called saintship (_arahattam_)  or nirvana of which I shall say something below. In early Buddhism it is  primarily a state of happiness to be attained in this life and the  Buddha persistently refused to explain what is the nature of a saint  after death. The question is unprofitable and perhaps he would have  said, had he spoken our language, unmeaning. Later generations did not  hesitate to discuss the problem but the Buddha's own teaching is simply  that a man can attain before death to a blessed state in which he has  nothing to fear from either death or rebirth.    The Buddha attacked both the ritual and the philosophy of the Brahmans.  After his time the sacrificial system, though it did not die, never  regained its old prestige and he profoundly affected the history of  Indian metaphysics. It may be justly said that most of his philosophic  as distinguished from his practical teaching was common property before  his time, but he transmuted common ideas and gave them a currency and  significance which they did not possess before. But he was less  destructive as a religious and social reformer than many have supposed.  He did not deny the existence nor forbid the worship of the popular  gods, but such worship is not Buddhism and the gods are merely angels  who may be willing to help good Buddhists but are in no wise guides to  religion, since they need instruction themselves. And though he denied  that the Brahmans were superior by birth to others, he did not preach  against caste, partly because it then existed only in a rudimentary  form. But he taught that the road to salvation was one and open to all  who were able to walk in it[10], whether Hindus or foreigners. All may  not have the necessary qualifications of intellect and character to  become monks but all can be good laymen, for whom the religious life  means the observance of morality combined with such simple exercises as  reading the scriptures. It is clear that this lay Buddhism had much to  do with the spread of the faith. The elemental simplicity of its  principles--namely that religion is open to all and identical with  morality--made a clean sweep of Brahmanic theology and sacrifices and put  in its place something like Confucianism. But the innate Indian love for  philosophizing and ritual caused generation after generation to add more  and more supplements to the Master's teaching and it is only outside  India that it has been preserved in any purity.      4. _Asoka_    Gotama spent his life in preaching and by his personal exertions spread  his doctrines over Bihar and Oudh but for two centuries after his death  we know little of the history of Buddhism. In the reign of Asoka  (273-232 B.C.) its fortunes suddenly changed, for this great Emperor  whose dominions comprised nearly all India made it the state religion  and also engraved on rocks and pillars a long series of edicts recording  his opinions and aspirations. Buddhism is often criticized as a gloomy  and unpractical creed, suited at best to stoical and scholarly recluses.  But these are certainly not its characteristics when it first appears in  political history, just as they are not its characteristics in Burma or  Japan to-day. Both by precept and example Asoka was an ardent exponent  of the strenuous life. In his first edict he lays down the principle  \"Let small and great exert themselves\" and in subsequent inscriptions he  continually harps upon the necessity of energy and exertion. The Law or  Religion (Dhamma) which his edicts enjoin is merely human and civic  virtue, except that it makes respect for animal life an integral part of  morality. In one passage he summarizes it as \"Little impiety, many good  deeds, compassion, liberality, truthfulness and purity.\" He makes no  reference to a supreme deity, but insists on the reality and importance  of the future life. Though he does not use the word _Karma_ this is  clearly the conception which dominates his philosophy: those who do good  are happy in this world and the next but those who fail in their duty  win neither heaven nor the royal favour. The king's creed is remarkable  in India for its great simplicity. He deprecates superstitious  ceremonies and says nothing of Nirvana but dwells on morality as  necessary to happiness in this life and others. This is not the whole of  Gotama's teaching but two centuries after his death a powerful and  enlightened Buddhist gives it as the gist of Buddhism for laymen.    Asoka wished to make Buddhism the creed not only of India but of the  world as known to him and he boasts that he extended his \"conquests of  religion\" to the Hellenistic kingdoms of the west. If the missions which  he despatched thither reached their destination, there is little  evidence that they bore any fruit, but the conversion of Ceylon and some  districts in the Himalayas seems directly due to his initiative.      5. _Extension of Buddhism and Hinduism beyond India_    This is perhaps a convenient place to review the extension of Buddhism  and Hinduism outside India. To do so at this point implies of course an  anticipation of chronology, but to delay the survey might blind the  reader to the fact that from the time of Asoka onward India was engaged  not only in creating but also in exporting new varieties of religious  thought.    The countries which have received Indian culture fall into two classes:  first those to which it came as a result of religious missions or of  peaceful international intercourse, and second those where it was  established after conquest or at least colonization. In the first class  the religion introduced was Buddhism. If, as in Tibet, it seems to us  mixed with Hinduism, yet it was a mixture which at the date of its  introduction passed in India for Buddhism. But in the second and smaller  class including Java, Camboja and Champa the immigrants brought with  them both Hinduism and Buddhism. The two systems were often declared to  be the same but the result was Hinduism mixed with some Buddhism, not  _vice versa_.    The countries of the first class comprise Ceylon, Burma and Siam,  Central Asia, Nepal, China with Annam, Korea and Japan, Tibet with  Mongolia. The Buddhism of the first three countries[11] is a real unity  or in European language a church, for though they have no common  hierarchy they use the same sacred language, Pali, and have the same  canon. Burma and Siam have repeatedly recognized Ceylon as a sort of  metropolitan see and on the other hand when religion in Ceylon fell on  evil days the clergy were recruited from Burma and Siam. In the other  countries Buddhism presents greater differences and divisions. It had no  one sacred language and in different regions used either Sanskrit texts  or translations into Chinese, Tibetan, Mongolian and the languages of  Central Asia.    1. Ceylon. There is no reason to doubt that Buddhism was introduced  under the auspices of Asoka. Though the invasions and settlements of  Tamils have brought Hinduism into Ceylon, yet none of the later and  mixed forms of Buddhism, in spite of some attempts to gain a footing,  ever flourished there on a large scale. Sinhalese Buddhism had probably  a closer connection with southern India than the legend suggests and  Conjevaram was long a Buddhist centre which kept up intercourse with  both Ceylon and Burma.    2. Burma. The early history of Burmese Buddhism is obscure and its  origin probably complex, since at many different periods it may have  received teachers from both India and China. The present dominant type  (identical with the Buddhism of Ceylon) existed before the sixth  century[12] and tradition ascribes its introduction both to the labours  of Buddhaghosa and to the missionaries of Asoka. There was probably a  connection between Pegu and Conjevaram. In the eleventh century Burmese  Buddhism had become extremely corrupt except in Pegu but King Anawrata  conquered Pegu and spread a purer form throughout his dominions.    3. Siam. The Thai race, who starting from somewhere in the Chinese  province of Yuennan began to settle in what is now called Siam about the  beginning of the twelfth century, probably brought with them some form  of Buddhism. About 1300 the possessions of Rama Komheng, King of Siam,  included Pegu and Pali Buddhism prevailed among his subjects. Somewhat  later, in 1361, a high ecclesiastic was summoned from Ceylon to arrange  the affairs of the church but not, it would seem, to introduce any new  doctrine. Pegu was the centre from which Pali Buddhism spread to upper  Burma in the eleventh century and it probably performed the same service  for Siam later. The modern Buddhism of Camboja is simply Siamese  Buddhism which filtered into the country from about 1250 onwards. The  older Buddhism of Camboja, for which see below, was quite different.    At the courts of Siam and Camboja, as formerly in Burma, there are  Brahmans who perform state ceremonies and act as astrologers. Though  they have little to do with the religion of the people, their presence  explains the predominance of Indian rather than Chinese influence in  these countries.    4. Tradition says that Indian colonists settled in Khotan during the  reign of Asoka, but no precise date can at present be fixed for the  introduction of Buddhism into the Tarim basin and other regions commonly  called Central Asia.

Naturally enough, under these circumstances the Jews of Spain turned  their eyes to their co-religionists in Africa; but, the secret  negotiations between them being discovered, the persecution blazed out  afresh, and the Seventeenth Council of Toledo[1] decreed that relapsed  Jews should be sold as slaves; that their children should be forcibly  taken from them; and that they should not be allowed to marry among  themselves.[2]        [1] Canon 8, de damnatione Judaeorum.        [2] For the further history of the Jews in Spain, see Appendix      A.    These odious decrees against the Jews must be attributed to the dominant  influence of the clergy, who requited the help they thus received from  the secular arm by wielding the powers of anathema and excommunication  against the political enemies of the king.[1] Moreover the cordial  relations which subsisted between the Church and the State, animated as  they were by a strong spirit of independence, enabled the Spanish kings  to resist the dangerous encroachments of the Papal power, a subject  which has been more fully treated in an Appendix.[2]        [1] The councils are full of denunciations aimed at the rebels      against the king's authority. By the Fourth Council (633) the      deposed Swintila was excommunicated.        [2] Appendix B.          CHAPTER II.    THE SARACENS IN SPAIN.      The Gothic domination lasted 300 years, and in that comparatively short  period we are asked by some writers to believe that the invaders quite  lost their national characteristics, and became, like the Spaniards,  luxurious and effeminate.[1] Their haughty exclusiveness, and the fact  of their being Arians, may no doubt have tended to keep them for a time  separate from, and superior to, the subject population, whom they  despised as slaves, and hated as heretics. But when the religious  barrier was removed, the social one soon followed, and so completely did  the conquerors lose their ascendency, that they even surrendered their  own Teutonic tongue for the corrupt Latin of their subjects.        [1] Cardonne's \"History of Spain,\" vol. i. p. 62. \"Bien      differens des leurs ancetres etoient alors enerves par les      plaisirs, la douceur du climat; le luxe et les richesses      avoient amolli leur courage et corrompu les moeurs.\" Cp.      Dunham, vol. i. 157.    But the Goths had certainly not become so degenerate as is generally  supposed. Their Saracen foes did not thus undervalue them. Musa ibn  Nosseyr, the organiser of the expedition into Spain, and the first  governor of that country under Arab rule, when asked by the Khalif  Suleiman for his opinion of the Goths, answered that \"they were lords  living in luxury and abundance, but champions who did not turn their  backs to the enemy.\"[1] There can be no doubt that this praise was well  deserved. Nor is the comparative ease with which the country was  overrun, any proof to the contrary. For that must be attributed to  wholesale treachery from one end of the country to the other. But for  this the Gothic rulers had only themselves to blame. Their treatment of  the Jews and of their slaves made the defection of these two classes of  their subjects inevitable.    The old Spanish chroniclers represent the fall of the Gothic kingdom as  the direct vengeance of Heaven for the sins of successive kings;[2] but  on the heads of the clergy, even more than of the king, rests the guilt  of their iniquitous and suicidal policy towards the Arians[3] and the  Jews. The treachery of Julian,[4] whatever its cause, opened a way for  the Arabs into the country by betraying into their hands Ceuta, the key  of the Straits. Success in their first serious battle was secured to  them by the opportune desertion from the enemy's ranks of the  disaffected political party under the sons of the late king Witiza,[5]  and an archbishop Oppas, who afterwards apostatized; while the rapid  subjugation of the whole country was aided and assured by the hosts of  ill-used slaves who flocked to the Saracen standards, and by the Jews[6]  who hailed the Arabs as fellow-Shemites and deliverers from the hated  yoke of the uncircumcised Goths.        [1] Al Makkari, vol. i. p. 297. (De Gayangos' translation).        [2] \"Chron. Sil.,\" sec. 17, \"recesserat ab Hispania manus      Domini ob inveteratam regum malitiam.\" See above, p. 7, note 2.        [3] Arianism lingered on till the middle of the eighth century      at least, since Rodrigo of Toledo, iii., sec. 3, says of      Alfonso I., that he \"extirpavit haeresin Arianam.\"        [4] For Julian, or, more correctly, Ilyan, see De      Gayangos' note to Al Makkari, i. p. 537, etc.        [5] Called Ghittishah by the Arabs. For the Witizan party see      \"Sebast. Salan,\" sec. 7; \"Chron. Sil.,\" sec. 15. The daughter      of Witiza married a noble Arab. The descendants of the King,      under the name Witizani, were known in Spain till the end of      the eighth century at least. See Letter of Beatus and Etherius      to Elipandus, sec. 61; \"Multi hodie ab ipso rege sumunt nomen      _Witizani_, etiam pauperes.\" See also Al Makkari, ii. 14.        [6] The Jews garrisoned the taken towns (Al Makkari, i. pp.      280, 282, and De Gayangos' note, p. 531). Even as late as 852      we find the Jews betraying Barcelona to the Moors, who slew      nearly all the Christians.    Yet in spite of all these disadvantages the Goths made a brave stand--as  brave, indeed, as our Saxon forefathers against the Normans. The first  decisive battle in the South[1] lasted, as some writers have declared,  six whole days, and the Arabs were at one time on the point of being  driven into the sea. This is apparent from Tarik's address to his  soldiers in the heat of battle: \"Moslems, conquerors of Africa, whither  would you fly? The sea is behind you, and the foe in front. There is no  help for you save in your own right hands[2] and the favour of God.\" Nor  must we lay any stress on the disparity of forces on either side,  amounting to five to one, for a large proportion of Roderic's army was  disaffected. It is probable that only the Goths made a determined stand;  and even after such a crushing defeat as they received at Guadalete, and  after the loss of their king, the Gothic nobles still offered a stubborn  resistance in Merida, Cordova, and elsewhere.[3] One of them,  Theodomir, after defending himself manfully in Murcia for some time, at  last by his valour and address contrived to secure for himself, and even  to hand down to his successor Athanagild, a semi-independent rule over  that part of Spain.        [1] Generally called the battle of Guadalete (Wada Lek, see De      Gayangos on Al Makk. i. pp. 524, 527), fought either near Xeres      or Medina Sidonia.        [2] \"Una salus victis nullam sperare salutem.\" See Al Makk. i.      p. 271; Conde i. p. 57 (Bohn's Translation).        [3] We must not forget also that the mild and politic conduct      of the Saracens towards the towns that surrendered, even after      resistance, marvellously facilitated their conquest.    But the great proof that the Goths had not lost all their ancient  hardihood and nobleness, is afforded by the fact that, when they had  been driven into the mountains of the North and West, they seem to have  begun at once to organize a fresh resistance against the invaders. The  thirty[1] wretched barbarians, whom the Arabs thought it unnecessary to  pursue into their native fastnesses, soon showed that they had power to  sting; and the handful of patriots, who in the cave of Covadonga  gathered round Pelayo, a scion of the old Gothic line, soon swelled into  an army, and the army into a nation. Within six years of the death of  Roderic had begun that onward march of the new Spanish monarchy, which,  with the exception of a disastrous twenty-five years at the close of the  tenth century, was not destined to retrograde, scarcely even to halt,  until it had regained every foot of ground that had once belonged to the  Gothic kings.    Let us turn for a moment to the antecedents of the Arab invaders.  History affords no parallel, whether from a religious or political point  of view, to the sudden rise of Mohammedanism and the wonderful conquests  which it made. \"The electric spark[2] had indeed fallen on what seemed  black unnoticeable sand, and lo the sand proved explosive powder and  blazed heaven-high from Delhi to Granada!\" Mohammed began his preaching  in 609, and confined himself to persuasion till 622, the year of the  Flight from Mecca. After this a change seems to have come over his  conduct, if not over his character, and the Prophet, foregoing the  peaceful and more glorious mission of a Heaven-sent messenger, appealed  to the human arbitrament of the sword: not with any very marked success,  however, the victory of Bedr in 624 being counterbalanced by the defeat  of Ohud in in the following year. In 631, Arabia being mostly pacified,  the first expedition beyond its boundaries was undertaken under  Mohammed's own leadership, but this abortive attempt gave no indications  of the astonishing successes to be achieved in the near future. Mohammed  himself died in the following year, yet, in spite of this and the  consequent revolt of almost all Arabia, within two years Syria was  overrun and Damascus taken. Persia, which had contended for centuries on  equal terms with Rome, was overthrown in a single campaign. In 637  Jerusalem fell, and the sacred soil of Palestine passed under the yoke  of the Saracens. Within three years Alexandria and the rich valley of  the Nile were the prize of Amru and his army. The conquest of Egypt only  formed the stepping-stone to the reduction of Africa, and the victorious  Moslems did not pause in their career until they reached the Atlantic  Ocean, and Akbah,[3] riding his horse"]]]
