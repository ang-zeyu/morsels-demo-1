[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15154"],[0,"Psychology and Industrial Efficiency (#4)"],[1,"we are  accustomed to proceed after this fashion: if a man applies for a  position, he is considered with regard to the totality of his  qualities, and at first nobody cares whether the particular feature is  inherited or acquired, whether it is an individual chance variation or  whether it is common to a larger group, perhaps to all members of a  certain nationality or race. We simply start from the clear fact that  the personalities which enter into the world of affairs present an  unlimited manifoldness of talents and abilities and functions of the  mind. From this manifoldness, it necessarily follows that some are  more, some less, fit for the particular economic task. In view of the  far-reaching division of labor in our modern economic life, it is  impossible to avoid the question how we can select the fit  personalities and reject the unfit ones.    How has modern society prepared itself to settle this social demand?  In case that certain knowledge is indispensable for the work or that  technical abilities must have been acquired, the vocation is  surrounded by examinations. This is true of the lower as well as of  the higher activities. The direct examination is everywhere  supplemented by testimonials covering the previous achievements, by  certificates referring to the previous education, and in frequent  cases by the endeavor to gain a personal impression from the  applicant. But if we take all this together, the total result remains  a social machinery by which perhaps the elimination of the entirely  unfit can be secured. But no one could speak of a really satisfactory  adaptation of the manifold personalities to the economic vocational  tasks. All those examinations and tests and certificates refer  essentially to what can be learned from without, and not to the true  qualities of the mind and the deeper traits. The so-called  impressions, too, are determined by the most secondary and external  factors. Society relies instinctively on the hope that the natural  wishes and interests will push every one to the place for which his  dispositions, talents, and psychophysical gifts prepare him.    In reality this confidence is entirely unfounded. A threefold  difficulty exists. In the first place, young people know very little  about themselves and their abilities. When the day comes on which they  discover their real strong points and their weaknesses, it is often  too late. They have usually been drawn into the current of a  particular vocation, and have given too much energy to the preparation  for a specific achievement to change the whole life-plan once more.  The entire scheme of education gives to the individual little chance  to find himself. A mere interest for one or another subject in school  is influenced by many accidental circumstances, by the personality of  the teacher or the methods of instruction, by suggestions of the  surroundings and by home traditions, and accordingly even such a  preference gives rather a slight final indication of the individual  mental qualities. Moreover, such mere inclinations and interests  cannot determine the true psychological fitness for a vocation. To  choose a crude illustration, a boy may think with passion of the  vocation of a sailor, and yet may be entirely unfit for it, because  his mind lacks the ability to discriminate red and green. He himself  may never have discovered that he is color-blind, but when he is ready  to turn to the sailor's calling, the examination of his  color-sensitiveness which is demanded may have shown the disturbing  mental deficiency. Similar defects may exist in a boy's attention or  memory, judgment or feeling, thought or imagination, suggestibility or  emotion, and they may remain just as undiscovered as the defect of  color-blindness, which is characteristic of four per cent of the male  population. All such deficiencies may be dangerous in particular  callings. But while the vocation of the ship officer is fortunately  protected nowadays by such a special psychological examination, most  other vocations are unguarded against the entrance of the mentally  unfit individuals.    As the boys and girls grow up without recognizing their psychical  weaknesses, the exceptional strength of one or another mental function  too often remains unnoticed by them as well. They may find out when  they are favored with a special talent for art or music or  scholarship, but they hardly ever know that their attention, or their  memory, or their will, or their intellectual apprehension, or their  sensory perceptions, are unusually developed in a particular  direction; yet such an exceptional mental disposition might be the  cause of special success in certain vocations. But we may abstract  from the extremes of abnormal deficiency and abnormal overdevelopment  in particular functions. Between them we find the broad region of the  average minds with their numberless variations, and these variations  are usually quite unknown to their possessors. It is often surprising  to see how the most manifest differences of psychical organization  remain unnoticed by the individuals themselves. Men with a pronounced  visual type of memory and men with a marked acoustical type may live  together without the slightest idea that their contents of  consciousness are fundamentally different from each other. Neither the  children nor their parents nor their teachers burden themselves with  the careful analysis of such actual mental qualities when the choice  of a vocation is before them. They know that a boy who is completely  unmusical must not become a musician, and that the child who cannot  draw at all must not become a painter, just as on physical grounds a  boy with very weak muscles is not fit to become a blacksmith. But as  soon as the subtler differentiation is needed, the judgment of all  concerned seems helpless and the physical characteristics remain  disregarded.    A further reason for the lack of adaptation, and surely a most  important one, lies in the fact that the individual usually knows only  the most external conditions of the vocations from which he chooses.  The most essential requisite for a truly perfect adaptation, namely, a  real analysis of the vocational demands with reference to the  desirable personal qualities, is so far not in existence. The young  people generally see some superficial traits of the careers which seem  to stand open, and, besides, perhaps they notice the great rewards of  the most successful. The inner labor, the inner values, and the inner  difficulties and frictions are too often unknown to those who decide  for a vocation, and they are unable to correlate those essential  factors of the life-calling with all that nature by inheritance, and  society by surroundings and training, have planted and developed in  their minds.    In addition to this ignorance as to one's own mental disposition and  to the lack of understanding of the true mental requirements of the  various social tasks comes finally the abundance of trivial chances  which become decisive in the choice of a vocation. Vocation and  marriage are the two most consequential decisions in life. In the  selection of a husband or a wife, too, the decision is very frequently  made dependent upon the most superficial and trivial motives. Yet the  social philosopher may content himself with the belief that even in  the fugitive love desire a deeper instinct of nature is expressed,  which may at least serve the biological tasks of married life. In the  choice of a vocation, even such a belief in a biological instinct is  impossible. The choice of a vocation, determined by fugitive whims and  chance fancies, by mere imitation, by a hope for quick earnings, by  irresponsible recommendation, or by mere laziness, has no internal  reason or excuse. Illusory ideas as to the prospects of a career,  moreover, often falsify the whole vista; and if we consider all this,  we can hardly be surprised that our total result is in many respects  hardly better than if everything were left entirely to accident. Even  on the height of a mental training to the end of adolescence, we see  how the college graduates are too often led by accidental motives to  the decision whether they shall become lawyers or physicians or  business men, but this superficiality of choice of course appears much  more strongly where the lifework is to be built upon the basis of a  mere elementary or high school education.    The final result corresponds exactly to these conditions. Everywhere,  in all countries and in all vocations, but especially in the economic  careers, we hear the complaint that there is lack of really good men.  Everywhere places are waiting for the right man, while at the same  time we find everywhere an oversupply of mediocre aspirants. This,  however, does not in the least imply that there really are not enough  personalities who might be perfectly fit even for the highest demands  of the vocations; it means only that as a matter of course the result  in the filling of positions cannot be satisfactory, if the placing of  the individuals is carried on without serious regard for the personal  mental qualities. The complaint that there is lack of fit human  material would probably never entirely disappear, as with a better  adjustment of the material, the demands would steadily increase; but  it could at least be predicted with high probability that this lack of  really fit material would not be felt so keenly everywhere if the  really decisive factor for the adjustment of personality and vocation,  namely, the dispositions of the mind, were not so carelessly ignored.    Society, to be sure, has a convenient means of correction. The  individual tries, and when he is doing his work too badly, he loses  his job, he is pushed out from the career which be has chosen, with  the great probability that he will be crushed by the wheels of social  life. It is a rare occurrence"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15164"],[0,"Folk Tales Every Child Should Know (#4)"],[1,", as though the Evil One were at his heels, to his brother's  house, and begged him for God's sake to take back the quern that  instant; for, said he:    \"If it grinds only one hour more, the whole parish will be swallowed up  by herrings and broth.\"    But his brother wouldn't hear of taking it back till the other paid him  down three hundred dollars more.    So the poor brother got both the money and the quern, and it wasn't long  before he set up a farmhouse far finer than the one in which his  brother lived, and with the quern he ground so much gold that he covered  it with plates of gold; and as the farm lay by the sea-side, the golden  house gleamed and glistened far away over the sea. All who sailed by,  put ashore to see the rich man in the golden house, and to see the  wonderful quern, the fame of which spread far and wide, till there was  nobody who hadn't heard tell of it.    So one day there came a skipper who wanted to see the quern; and the  first thing he asked was if it could grind salt.    \"Grind salt!\" said the owner; \"I should just think it could. It can  grind anything.\"    When the skipper heard that, he said he must have the quern, cost what  it would; for if he only had it, he thought he should be rid of his long  voyages across stormy seas for a lading of salt. Well, at first the man  wouldn't hear of parting with the quern; but the skipper begged and  prayed so hard that at last he let him have it, but he had to pay many,  many thousand dollars for it. Now, when the skipper had got the quern on  his back, he soon made off with it, for he was afraid lest the man  should change his mind; so he had no time to ask how to handle the  quern, but got on board his ship as fast as he could, and set sail.  When he had sailed a good way off, he brought the quern on deck and  said:    \"Grind salt, and grind both good and fast.\"    Well, the quern began to grind salt so that it poured out like water;  and when the skipper had got the ship full, he wished to stop the quern,  but whichever way he turned it, and however much he tried, it was no  good; the quern kept grinding on, and the heap of salt grew higher and  higher, and at last down sunk the ship.    There lies the quern at the bottom of the sea, and grinds away at this  very day, and that's why the sea is salt.          III    THE LAD WHO WENT TO THE NORTH WIND      Once on a time there was an old widow who had one son and, as she was  poorly and weak, her son had to go up into the safe to fetch meal for  cooking; but when he got outside the safe, and was just going down the  steps, there came the North Wind, puffing and blowing, caught up the  meal, and so away with it through the air. Then the lad went back into  the safe for more; but when he came out again on the steps, if the North  Wind didn't come again and carry off the meal with a puff; and more than  that, he did so the third time. At this the lad got very angry; and as  he thought it hard that the North Wind should behave so, he thought he'd  just look him up, and ask him to give up his meal.    So off he went, but the way was long, and he walked and walked; but at  last he came to the North Wind's house.    \"Good day!\" said the lad, and \"thank you for coming to see us  yesterday.\"    \"GOOD DAY!\" answered the North Wind, for his voice was loud and gruff,  \"AND THANKS FOR COMING TO SEE ME. WHAT DO YOU WANT?\"    \"Oh!\" answered the lad, \"I only wished to ask you to be so good as to  let me have back that meal you took from me on the safe steps, for we  haven't much to live on; and if you're to go on snapping up the morsel  we have there'll be nothing for it but to starve.\"    \"I haven't got your meal,\" said the North Wind; \"but if you are in such  need, I'll give you a cloth which will get you everything you want, if  you only say, 'Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good  dishes!'\"    With this the lad was well content. But, as the way was so long he  couldn't get home in one day, he turned into an inn on the way; and when  they were going to sit down to supper, he laid the cloth on a table  which stood in the corner and said:    \"Cloth spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good dishes.\"    He had scarce said so before the cloth did as it was bid; and all who  stood by thought it a fine thing, but most of all the landlady. So,  when all were fast asleep, at dead of night, she took the lad's cloth,  and put another in its stead, just like the one he had got from the  North Wind, but which couldn't so much as serve up a bit of dry bread.    So, when the lad woke, he took his cloth and went off with it, and that  day he got home to his mother.    \"Now,\" said he, \"I've been to the North Wind's house, and a good fellow  he is, for he gave me this cloth, and when I only say to it, 'Cloth,  spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good dishes,' I get any sort  of food I please.\"    \"All very true, I dare say,\" said his mother; \"but seeing is believing,  and I shan't believe it till I see it.\"    So the lad made haste, drew out a table, laid the cloth on it, and said:    \"Cloth, spread yourself, and serve all up kinds of good dishes.\"    But never a bit of dry bread did the cloth serve up.    \"Well,\" said the lad, \"there's no help for it but to go to the North  Wind again;\" and away he went.    So he came to where the North Wind lived late in the afternoon.    \"Good evening!\" said the lad.    \"Good evening,\" said the North Wind.    \"I want my rights for that meal of ours which you took,\" said the lad;  \"for as for that cloth I got, it isn't worth a penny.\"    \"I've got no meal,\" said the North Wind; \"but yonder you have a ram  which coins nothing but golden ducats as soon as you say to it:    \"'Ram, ram! make money!'\"    So the lad thought this a fine thing but as it was too far to get home  that day, he turned in for the night to the same inn where he had slept  before.    Before he called for anything, he tried the truth of what the North Wind  had said of the ram, and found it all right; but when the landlord saw  that, he thought it was a famous ram, and, when the lad had fallen  asleep, he took another which couldn't coin gold ducats, and changed the  two.    Next morning off went the lad; and when he got home to his mother he  said:    \"After all, the North Wind is a jolly fellow; for now he has given me a  ram which can coin golden ducats if I only say, 'Ram, ram! make  money!'\"    \"All very true, I dare say,\" said his mother; \"but I shan't believe any  such stuff until I see the ducats made.\"    \"Ram, ram! make money!\" said the lad; but if the ram made anything it  wasn't money.    So the lad went back again to the North Wind and blew him up, and said  the ram was worth nothing, and he must have his rights for the meal.    \"Well,\" said the North Wind; \"I've nothing else to give you but that old  stick in the corner yonder; but it's a stick of that kind that if you  say:    \"'Stick, stick! lay on!' it lays on till you say:    \"'Stick, stick! now stop!'\"    So, as the way was long, the lad turned in this night too to the  landlord; but as he could pretty well guess how things stood as to the  cloth and the ram, he lay down at once on the bench and began to snore,  as if he were asleep.    Now the landlord, who easily saw that the stick must be worth something,  hunted up one which was like it, and when he heard the lad snore, was  going to change the two, but just as the landlord was about to take it  the lad bawled out:    \"Stick, stick! lay on!\"    So the stick began to beat the landlord, till he jumped over chairs, and  tables, and benches, and yelled and roared:    \"Oh my! oh my! bid the stick be still, else it will beat me to death,  and you shall have back both your cloth and your ram.\"    When the lad thought the landlord had got enough, he said:    \"Stick, stick! now stop!\"    Then he took the cloth and put it into his pocket, and went home with  his stick in his hand, leading the ram by a cord round its horns; and so  he got his rights for the meal he had lost.          IV    THE LAD AND THE DEIL      Once on a time there was a lad who was walking along a road cracking  nuts, so he found one that was worm-eaten, and just at that very moment  he met the Deil.    \"Is it true, now,\" said the lad, \"what they say, that the Deil can make  himself as small as he chooses, and thrust himself on through a  pinhole?\"    \"Yes, it is,\" said the Deil.    \"Oh! it is, is it? then let me see you do it, and just creep into this  nut,\" said the lad.    So the Deil did it.    Now, when he had crept well into it through the worm's hole, the lad  stopped it up with a pin.    \"Now, I've got you safe,\" he said, and put the nut into his pocket.    So when he had walked on a bit, he came to a smithy, and he turned in  and asked the smith if he'd be good enough to crack that nut for him.    \"Ay, that'll be an easy job,\" said the smith, and took his smallest  hammer, laid the nut on the anvil, and gave it a blow, but it wouldn't  break.    So he took another hammer a little bigger, but that wasn't heavy enough  either.    Then he took one bigger still, but it was still the same story; and so  the smith got wroth, and grasped his great sledge-hammer.    \"Now, I'll crack you to bits,\" he said, and let drive at the nut with  all his might and main. And so the nut flew to pieces with a bang that  blew off half the roof of the smithy, and the whole house creaked and  groaned as though it were ready to fall.    \"Why! if I don't think the Deil must have been in that nut,\" said the  smith.    \"So he was; you're quite right,\" said the lad, as he went away laughing.          V    ANANZI AND THE LION      Once on a time Ananzi planned a scheme. He went to town and bought ever  so many firkins of fat, and ever so many sacks, and ever so many balls  of string, and a very big frying pan, then he went to the bay and blew a  shell, and called the Head-fish in the sea, \"Green Eel,\" to him. Then he "]]]
