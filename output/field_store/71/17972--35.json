By this means we obtain an idea of the development of  different types of pottery, and the sequence of the types. Thus it is  that we can say with some degree of confidence that the black and red  ware is the most ancient form, and that the buff with red designs is one  of the latest forms of prehistoric pottery. Other objects found in the  graves can be classified as they occur with different pottery types.    With the help of the pottery we can thus gain a more or less reliable  conspectus of the development of the late \"Neolithic\" culture of Egypt.  This system of \"sequence-dating\" was introduced by Prof. Petrie, and is  certainly very useful. It must not, however, be pressed too far or be  regarded as an iron-bound system, with which all subsequent discoveries  must be made to fit in by force. It is not to be supposed that all  prehistoric pottery developed its series of types in an absolutely  orderly manner without deviations or throws-back. The work of man's  hands is variable and eccentric, and does not develop or evolve in an  undeviating course as the work of nature does. It is a mistake, very  often made by anthropologists and archaeologists, who forget this  elementary fact, to assume \"curves of development,\" and so forth, or  semi-savage culture, on absolutely even and regular lines. Human culture  has not developed either evenly or regularly, as a matter of fact.  Therefore we cannot always be sure that, because the Egyptian black and  red pottery does not occur in graves with buff and red, it is for  this reason absolutely earlier in date than the latter. Some of the  development-sequences may in reality be contemporary with others instead  of earlier, and allowance must always be made for aberrations and  reversions to earlier types.    This caveat having been entered, however, we may provisionally  accept Prof. Petrie's system of sequence-dating as giving the best  classification of the prehistoric antiquities according to development.  So it may fairly be said that, as far as we know, the black and red  pottery (\"sequence-date 30--\") is the most ancient Neolithic Egyptian  ware known; that the buff and red did not begin to be used till about  \"sequence-date 45;\" that bone and ivory carvings were commonest in the  earlier period (\"sequence-dates 30-50\"); that copper was almost unknown  till \"sequence-date 50,\" and so on. The arbitrary numbers used range  from 30 to 80, in order to allow for possible earlier and later  additions, which may be rendered necessary by the progress of discovery.  The numbers are of course as purely arbitrary and relative as those  of the different thermometrical systems, but they afford a convenient  system of arrangement. The products of the prehistoric Egyptians are, so  to speak, distributed on a conventional plan over a scale numbered from  30 to 80, 30 representing the beginning and 80 the close of the term,  so far as its close has as yet been ascertained. It is probable that  \"sequence-date 80\" more or less accurately marks the beginning of the  dynastic or historical period.    This hypothetically chronological classification is, as has been said,  due to Prof. Petrie, and has been adopted by Mr. Randall-Maclver and  other students of prehistoric Egypt in their work. [*_El Amra and  Abydos_, Egypt Exploration Fund, 1902.] To Prof. Petrie then is due the  credit of systematizing the study of Egyptian prehistoric antiquities;  but the further credit of having _discovered_ these antiquities  themselves and settled their date belongs not to him but to the  distinguished French archaeologist, M. J. de Morgan, who was for several  years director of the museum at Giza, and is now chief of the French  archaeological delegation in Persia, which has made of late years so many  important discoveries. The proof of the prehistoric date of this class  of antiquities was given, not by Prof. Petrie after his excavations at  Dendera in 1897-8, but by M. de Morgan in his volume, _Recherches sur  les Origines de l'Egypte: l'Age de la Pierre et les Metaux_, published  in 1895-6. In this book the true chronological position of the  prehistoric antiquities was pointed out, and the existence of an  Egyptian Stone Age finally decided. M. de Morgan's work was based on  careful study of the results of excavations carried on for several years  by the Egyptian government in various parts of Egypt, in the course  of which a large number of cemeteries of the primitive type had been  discovered. It was soon evident to M. de Morgan that these primitive  graves, with their unusual pottery and flint implements, could be  nothing less than the tombs of the prehistoric Egyptians, the Egyptians  of the Stone Age.    Objects of the prehistoric period had been known to the museums for many  years previously, but owing to the uncertainty of their provenance and  the absence of knowledge of the existence of the primitive cemeteries,  no scientific conclusions had been arrived at with regard to them; and  it was not till the publication of M. de Morgan's book that they were  recognized and classified as prehistoric. The necropoles investigated  by M. de Morgan and his assistants extended from Kawamil in the north,  about twenty miles north of Abydos, to Edfu in the south. The chief  cemeteries between these two points were those of Bat Allam, Saghel  el-Baglieh, el-'Amra, Nakada, Tukh, and Gebelen. All the burials were  of simple type, analogous to those of the Neolithic races in the rest  of the world. In a shallow, oval grave, excavated often but a few inches  below the surface of the soil, lay the body, cramped up with the knees  to the chin, sometimes in a rough box of pottery, more often with only  a mat to cover it. Ready to the hand of the dead man were his flint  weapons and tools, and the usual red and black, or buff and red, pots  lay beside him; originally, no doubt, they had been filled with the  funeral meats, to sustain the ghost in the next world. Occasionally a  simple copper weapon was found. With the body were also buried slate  palettes for grinding the green eye-paint which the Egyptians loved even  at this early period. These are often carved to suggest the forms of  animals, such as birds, bats, tortoises, goats, etc.; on others are  fantastic creatures with two heads. Combs of bone, too, are found,  ornamented in a similar way with birds' or goats' heads, often double.  And most interesting of all are the small bone and ivory figures of men  and women which are also found. These usually have little blue beads for  eyes, and are of the quaintest and naivest appearance conceivable. Here  we have an elderly man with a long pointed beard, there two women with  inane smiles upon their countenances, here another woman, of better work  this time, with a child slung across her shoulder. This figure, which  is in the British Museum, must be very late, as prehistoric Egyptian  antiquities go. It is almost as good in style as the early Ist Dynasty  objects. Such were the objects which the simple piety of the early  Egyptian prompted him to bury with the bodies of his dead, in order that  they might find solace and contentment in the other world.    All the prehistoric cemeteries are of this type, with the graves pressed  closely together, so that they often impinge upon one another. The  nearness of the graves to the surface is due to the exposed positions,  at the entrances to _wadis_, in which the primitive cemeteries are  usually found. The result is that they are always swept by the winds,  which prevent the desert sand from accumulating over them, and so have  preserved the original level of the ground. From their proximity to  the surface they are often found disturbed, more often by the agency of  jackals than that of man.    Contemporaneously with M. de Morgan's explorations, Prof. Flinders  Petrie and Mr. J. Quibell had, in the winter of 1894-5, excavated in  the districts of Tukh and Nakada, on the west bank of the Nile opposite  Koptos, a series of extensive cemeteries of the primitive type, from  which they obtained a large number of antiquities, published in their  volume Nagada and Dallas. The plates giving representations of the  antiquities found were of the highest interest, but the scientific value  of the letter-press is vitiated by the fact that the true historical  position of the antiquities was not perceived by their discoverers, who  came to the conclusion that these remains were those of a \"New Pace\" of  Libyan invaders. This race, they supposed, had entered Egypt after the  close of the flourishing period of the \"Old Kingdom\" at the end of the  VIth Dynasty, and had occupied part of the Nile valley from that time  till the period of the Xth Dynasty.    This conclusion was proved erroneous by M. de Morgan almost as soon  as made, and the French archaeologist's identification of the primitive  remains as pre-dynastic was at once generally accepted. It was obvious  that a hypothesis of the settlement of a stone-using barbaric race in  the midst of Egypt at so late a date as the period immediately preceding  the XIIth Dynasty, a race which mixed in no way with the native  Egyptians themselves, and left no trace of their influence upon the  later Egyptians, was one which demanded greater faith than the simple  explanation of M. de Morgan.    The error of the British explorers was at once admitted by Mr. Quibell,  in his volume on the excavations of 1897 at el-Kab, published in 1898.*  Mr. Quibell at once found full and adequate confirmation of M. de  Morgan's discovery in his diggings at el-Kab. Prof. Petrie admitted  the correctness of M. de Morgan's views in the preface to his volume  Diospolis Parva, published three years later in 1901.** The preface to  the first volume of M. de Morgan's "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17322"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 2 (of 12) (#4)"],[1,"by [--], see the page images in       the HTML file}    When the Egyptians wished to denote that a person or thing was in a  certain place, they inserted their names within the picture of the place  in question. Thus the name of Teti is written inside a picture of Teti's  castle, the result being the compound hieroglyph [--] Again, when the  son of a king became king in his turn, they enclose his ordinary name  in the long flat-bottomed frame [--] which we call a cartouche;  the elliptical part [--] of which is a kind of plan of the world, a  representation of those regions passed over by Ra in his journey, and  over which Pharaoh, because he is a son of Ra, exercises his rule.  When the names of Teti or Snofrui, following the group [----] which  respectively express sovereignty over the two halves of Egypt, the  South and the North, the whole expression describing exactly the visible  person of Pharaoh during his abode among mortals. But this first name  chosen for the child did not include the whole man; it left without  appropriate designation the double of Horus, which was revealed in  the prince at the moment of accession. The double therefore received a  special title, which is always constructed on a uniform plan: first the  picture [--] hawk-god, who desired to leave to his descendants a portion  of his soul, then a simple or compound epithet, specifying that virtue  of Horus which the Pharaoh wished particularly to possess--\"Horu  nib-maifc,\" Horus master of Truth; \"Horu miri-toui,\" Horus friend of  both lands; \"Horu nibkhauu,\" Horus master of the risings; \"Horu maziti,\"  Horus who crushes his enemies.    [Illustration: 024.jpg THE ADULT KING ADVANCING, FOLLOWED BY HIS DOUBLE]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from an illustration in Arundale-       Bonomi-Birch's _Gallery of Antiquities from the British       Museum,_ pl. 31. The king thus represented is Thutmosis II.       of the XVIIIth dynasty; the spear, surmounted by a man's       head, which the double holds in his hand, probably recalls       the human victims formerly sacrificed at the burial of a       chief.    The variable part of these terms is usually written in an oblong  rectangle, terminated at the lower end by a number of lines portraying  in a summary way the facade of a monument, in the centre of which a  bolted door may sometimes be distinguished: this is the representation  of the chapel where the double will one day rest, and the closed door is  the portal of the tomb.* The stereotyped part of the names and titles,  which is represented by the figure of the god, is placed outside the  rectangle, sometimes by the side of it, sometimes upon its top: the hawk  is, in fact, free by nature, and could nowhere remain imprisoned against  his will.         * This is what is usually known as the \"Banner Name;\"       indeed, it was for some time believed that this sign       represented a piece of stuff, ornamented at the bottom by       embroidery or fringe, and bearing on the upper part the       title of a king. Wilkinson thought that this \"square title,\"       as he called it, represented a house. The real meaning of       the expression was determined by Professor Flinders Petrie       and by myself.    This artless preamble was not enough to satisfy the love of precision  which is the essential characteristic of the Egyptians. When they wished  to represent the double in his sepulchral chamber, they left out of  consideration the period in his existence during which he had presided  over the earthly destinies of the sovereign, in order to render them  similar to those of Horus, from whom the double proceeded.    [Illustration: 026.jpg Page Image]    They, therefore, withdrew him from the tomb which should have been his  lot, and there was substituted for the ordinary sparrow-hawk one of  those groups which symbolize sovereignty over the two countries of the  Nile--the coiled urasus of the North, and the vulture of the South,  [--]; there was then finally added a second sparrow-hawk, the golden  sparrow-hawk, [--], the triumphant sparrow-hawk which had delivered  Egypt from Typhon. The soul of Snofrai, which is called, as a surviving  double, [--], \"Horus master of Truth,\" is, as a living double, entitled  \"[--]\" \"[--]\" the Lord of the Vulture and of the \"Urous,\" master of  Truth, and Horus triumphant.*         * The Ka, or double name, represented in this illustration       is that of the Pharaoh Khephren, the builder of the second       of the great pyramids at Gizeh; it reads \"Horu usir-Haiti,\"       Horus powerful of heart.    On the other hand, the royal prince, when he put on the diadem,  received, from the moment of his advancement to the highest rank, such  an increase of dignity, that his birth-name--even when framed in a  cartouche and enhanced with brilliant epithets--was no longer able to  fully represent him. This exaltation of his person was therefore marked  by a new designation. As he was the living flesh of the sun, so his  surname always makes allusion to some point in his relations with his  father, and proclaims the love which he felt for the latter, \"Miriri,\"  or that the latter experienced for him, \"Mirniri,\" or else it indicates  the stability of the doubles of Ra, \"Tatkeri,\" their goodness,  \"Nofirkeri,\" or some other of their sovereign virtues. Several Pharaohs  of the IVth dynasty had already dignified themselves by these surnames;  those of the VIth were the first to incorporate them regularly into the  royal preamble.    [Illustration: 027.jpg PAGE IMAGE]    There was some hesitation at first as to the position the surname ought  to occupy, and it was sometimes placed after the birth-name, as in \"Papi  Nofirkeri,\" sometimes before it, as in [--] \"Nofirkeri Papi.\" It was  finally decided to place it at the beginning, preceded by the group [--]  \"King of Upper and Lower Egypt,\" which expresses in its fullest extent  the power granted by the gods to the Pharaoh alone; the other, or  birth-name, came after it, accompanied by the words [--]. \"Son of the  Sun.\" There were inscribed, either before or above these two solar names  --which are exclusively applied to the visible and living body of the  master--the two names of the sparrow-hawk, which belonged especially to  the soul; first, that of the double in the tomb, and then that of the  double while still incarnate. Four terms seemed thus necessary to the  Egyptians in order to define accurately the Pharaoh, both in time and in  eternity.    Long centuries were needed before this subtle analysis of the royal  person, and the learned graduation of the formulas which corresponded to  it, could transform the Nome chief, become by conquest suzerain over all  other chiefs and king of all Egypt, into a living god here below, the  all-powerful son and successor of the gods; but the divine concept of  royalty, once implanted in the mind, quickly produced its inevitable  consequences. From the moment that the Pharaoh became god upon earth,  the gods of heaven, his fathers or his brothers, and the goddesses  recognized him as their son, and, according to the ceremonial imposed  by custom in such cases, consecrated his adoption by offering him the  breast to suck, as they would have done to their own child.    [Illustration: 028.jpg THE GODDESS ADOPTS THE KING BY SUCKLING HIM]         Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by Insinger. The       original is in the great speos of Silsilis. The king here       represented is Harmhabit of the XVIIIth dynasty; cf.       Champollion, _Monuments de l'Egypt et de la Nubie,_ pl.       cix., No. 3; Rosellini, _Monumenti Storici,_ pl. xliv. 5;       Lepsius, Denkm., iii. 121 b.    Ordinary mortals spoke of him only in symbolic words, designating him by  some periphrasis: Pharaoh, \"Pirui-Aui,\" the Double Palace, \"Pruiti,\" the  Sublime Porte, His Majesty,* the Sun of the two lands, Horus master of  the palace, or, less ceremoniously, by the indeterminate pronoun \"One.\"         * The title \"Honuf\" is translated by the same authors,       sometimes as \"His Majesty,\" sometimes as \"His Holiness.\" The       reasons for translating it \"His Majesty,\" as was originally       proposed by Champollion, and afterwards generally adopted,       have been given last of all by E. de Rouge.    The greater number of these terms is always accompanied by a wish  addressed to the sovereign for his \"life,\" \"health,\" and \"strength,\" the  initial signs of which are written after all his titles. He accepts all  this graciously, and even on his own initiative, swears by his own life,  or by the favour of Ra, but he forbids his subjects to imitate him: for  them it is a sin, punishable in this world and in the next, to adjure  the person of the sovereign, except in the case in which a magistrate  requires from them a judicial oath.

No one is free from this obligation: his ministers themselves, and the  great ones of his kingdom, cannot deliberate with him on matters of  state, without inaugurating the proceeding by a sort of solemn service  in his honour, and reciting to him at length a eulogy of his divinity.  They did not, indeed, openly exalt him above the other gods, but these  were rather too "]]]
