It is no wonder that, with such a       hideous desecration of the rights of the birds, the       population of the Rocks is rapidly decreasing.         I believe the light-keeper is supposed to be a conservator       of the birds and to prevent such uncontrolled destruction;       but what can he do, a man who is practically exiled from the       rest of his race for the entire year, frozen in for six       months of the year? He is naturally so overjoyed at the       sight of a fellow creature from the big world outside as to       indulge him, whatever his collecting proclivities may be.       The eggs that are taken by the occasional sailor seem to me       to cut no figure at all in the actual diminution of the bird       life there. That is a slender thing compared with the       destruction caused by the bird students. It is a severe       indictment of the ornithologist that such statements as the       foregoing happen to be true.         Almost as remarkable for its number of waterfowl of the same       species is the roost on the east cliffs of Bonaventure       island. These have fortunately been rendered by Nature, thus       far, inaccessible and the bird men have not yet found a way       of getting among them. Yet, even so, there is constantly a       great deal of reckless shooting at the birds simply for the       sake of \"stirring them up.\" This place is not protected by       law, I believe, as a special reservation, but that might       easily be brought about if the matter were placed in the       hands of some responsible citizen residing on that island.         There is a happy situation in connection with the great       Perce rock at Perce, on the top of which the gulls and       cormorants have kept house for untold generations. These       birds are a constant temptation to the men with a gun, but       the Perce people are so attached to the birds that no one       would ever think of killing one, except the occasional       French fisherman who will eat a young gull when hard       pressed. Any attempt made by outsiders to use the birds as       targets is resented so strongly that even the cormorants are       let live.         Your address seems to me timely and extremely pertinent. I       hope your proposition may receive more than passing       attention and the suggestions therein be made effective, for       they certainly aim to maintain the natural attractions and       the natural resources of the country.    Mr. Napoleon A. Comeau, author of _Life and Sport on the North Shore_,  and one who has had fifty years' practical experience within the  Labrador area, writes from Godbout River, Que.:         I trust your good work will be crowned with success. A lot       of good has already been accomplished by the spreading of       literature on this subject by the Audubon Society, the       A.O.U. and others, but much remains to be accomplished. It       has always been my aim in this section to prevent wanton       destruction of all kinds and I am glad to say I have had       considerable success in educating our younger generation       here. Small birds of all kinds used to be wantonly killed by       boys, a thing I rarely see now--it was the same in the other       ways by men--but I must say that _real_ trappers or Indians       are not the worst by any means. These men will kill at all       times and seasons but only through necessity; strangers and       so-called sportsmen are generally the offenders. I have been       a trapper myself for years, a professional, but had been       taught never to kill wantonly.... Of course, much study and       care must be exercised in preserving species of birds and       animals from destruction, or else, as you say, mistakes may       be made. There are species of such that are destructive to       others when allowed to increase beyond certain limits, and       it takes a very short time to do that in some cases....       About three years ago, ruffed grouse were so scarce       everywhere that I have travelled hundreds of miles without       seeing one. They were protected by law, which no doubt did       much near the densely populated sections, but as far as our       coast was concerned did absolutely nothing because Indians       and trappers shot them on sight for food. Last year there       were a few seen here and there and all at once, during the       present season, there are thousands. Hundreds have been shot       and they are reported abundant all over. I imagine this must       be due to particularly favourable weather conditions and the       immense number of foxes trapped last winter. There is also       this fall, an extraordinary number of muskrats--they are       swarming everywhere, even in totally, unfavourable       localities, doing much damage in some places. What is the       cause of this? Presumably it must be through some cause       decreasing the number of their enemies. This is why I think       much care must be taken before any steps are taken to       protect certain species. Some still hold their own against       all odds.    His Royal Highness the Duke of Connaught, Governor General of Canada,  acknowledged the receipt of the _Address_ from Balmoral Castle in  September, granted an interview at Ottawa in December, and authorized  the use of his name to show his sympathy with the movement.    Dr. W.T. Grenfell has a long and most intimate knowledge of the  Atlantic Labrador. He writes:         The matters of animal preservation which interest me most       are: The rapid decline in numbers of harp seals which we       Northern people can get for our boots and clothing. This       food and clothing supply, formerly readily obtainable all       along the Labrador, helped greatly to maintain in comfort       our scattered population. It is scarcely now worth while       putting out seal nets. We attribute this to the destruction       of seals at the time of their whelping, by steamers which       are ever growing larger and more numerous. No mammal,       producing but one offspring can long survive this.         Along the Labrador coast east of the Canadian border, birds       are destroyed on sight and nests robbed wherever found. The       laws are a dead letter because there is no one to enforce       them.         There is great need also for scientific inquiry with regard       to the fisheries--the herring and mackerel are apparently       gone, the salmon are getting scarcer, and the cod fisheries       have been failing perceptibly these past years. Yet there is       no practical effort made to discover the reason and obviate       it.    On the 9th of September, 1911, Earl Grey made the following entry in  the visitors' book at La Roche:         I desire to thank the provincial government of Quebec for       having given me the opportunity of visiting, as their guest,       the Laurentides National Park, and to acknowledge the great       pleasure which I have derived from all I have seen and       done.... I would also like to congratulate them on the       wisdom of their policy in establishing so large a reserve,       as a protection for various breeds of wild animals which       would otherwise be in danger of extinction, and as a place       of rest, refreshment, and recreation for those who love the       quiet of the wilds.    Mr. George Bird Grinnell, one of the greatest authorities in the world  on the Indian and wild life of North America, writes:         I have recently read with extraordinary interest your       address, presented last January to the Commission of       Conservation....         I wish to offer you my personal thanks for the effective way       in which you have set forth the desirability of establishing       wild-life refuges in Labrador, and I trust that what you       have said will start a movement in Canada to carry out this       good project. It has long interested me to know that your       people and their officials seem much more farseeing than       those on this side of the line, and Canada's show of       national parks and reservations is far more creditable than       that of her neighbour to the south.    Dr. H. Mather Hare, who does on the Canadian Labrador what Dr.  Grenfell does on the Newfoundland or Atlantic Labrador, and whose  headquarters are at Harrington, where the first coast sanctuary ought  to be established at the earliest possible moment, says:         May I make a suggestion? The fishermen coming here from Nova       Scotia and Newfoundland do not believe there is really a law       against egging and shooting. They say it is a put-up job by       the people living on the coast, because they want all the       eggs and birds themselves. This being the case, would it not       be a good idea to have a notice in several of the Nova       Scotia and Newfoundland papers warning the fishermen       against breaking the law, and in this way putting the       interdiction on a legal footing; so they may understand that       it is not a mere bluff on the part of the people living on       the coast. So far there has been nothing but talk, and       nothing official; no arrest made, etc., so one can hardly       blame them for the position they take, especially as they       have been doing the same thing for many years.         The notice should be very clear and penalties set forth       plainly.    Mr. W.T. Lindsay, M.E., who has travelled thousands of miles through  Labrador, writes:         I have spent two summers in the north eastern wilderness of       Quebec and can fully appreciate your suggestions.         I take the liberty of sending you a copy of an \"interview\"       by the _Montreal Witness_ upon my return in 1909, by which       you will see that I am in accord with your views, _i.e._,       unless the Government takes immediate steps to protect the       wild animals "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15139"],[0,"Notizie del pubblico giardino de' semplici di Padova compilate intorno l'anno (#4)"],[1,"del professore, e sottratte così  ai guasti progressivi del tempo e delle stagioni.    [7] Al Pontedera era imposto di scrivere la storia dell'orto non senza  apposita ricompensa. Il poco che ne scrisse in lingua latina esiste, con  sette volumi di annotazioni e documenti da lui raccolti per servire alla  stessa, nella biblioteca dell'orto. Il chiarissimo professore de  Visiani, da cui si ebbero le notizie in queste note comprese, promise  solennemente nella lodata sua _Memoria dell'origine_ ec. una storia di  questo celebratissimo stabilimento. Egli che con ogni sua possa nei  pochi anni che lo governa ne accrebbe lo splendore fino ad un segno cui  mai non giunse per lo passato, non tarderà, si spera, a trarla a buon  fine.

L'orto di Padova non  ha quindi, nemmeno per questa parte, _che invidiare a qualunque altro  dei più ricchi e celebrati d'Europa_."]]]
