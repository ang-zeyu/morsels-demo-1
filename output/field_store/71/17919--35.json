If I heard about me the spiteful criticisms of irritating  critics, I was consoled by talking to Berlioz who honored me with his  friendship and whose admiration for Hugo equalled mine. In the meantime  my literary education was improving, and I made the acquaintance of the  classics and found immortal beauties in them. My admiration for the  classics, however, did not diminish my regard for Hugo, for I never  could see why it was unfaithfulness to him not to despise Racine. It was  fortunate for me that this was my view, for I have seen the most fiery  romanticists, like Meurice and Vacquerie, revert to Racine in their  later years, and repair the links in a golden chain which should never  have been broken.    The Empire fell and Victor Hugo came back to Paris. So I was going to  have a chance of realizing my dream of seeing him and hearing his voice!  But I dreaded meeting him almost as much as I wished to do so. Like  Rossini Victor Hugo received his friends every evening. He came forward  with both hands outstretched and told me what pleasure it was for him to  see me at his house. Everything whirled around me!    \"I cannot say the same to you,\" I answered. \"I wish I were somewhere  else.\" He laughed heartily and showed that he knew how to overcome my  bashfulness. I waited to hear some of the conversation which, according  to my preconceived ideas, would be in the style of his latest romance.  However, it was entirely different; simple polished phrases, entirely  logical, came from that \"mouth of mystery.\"    I went to Hugo's evenings as often as possible, for I never could drink  my fill of the presence of the hero of my youthful dreams. I had  occasion to note to what an extent a fiery republican, a modern Juvenal,  whose verses branded \"kings\" as if with a red hot iron, in his private  life was susceptible to their flattery. The Emperor of Brazil had called  on him, and the next day he could not stop talking about it constantly.  Rather ostentatiously he called him \"Don Pedro d'Alcantara.\" In French  this would be \"M. Pierre du Pont.\" Spanish inherently gives such florid  sounds to ordinary names. This florid style is not frequent in French,  and that is precisely what Corneille and Victor Hugo succeeded in  giving it.    A slight incident unfortunately changed my relations with the great  poet.    \"As long as Mlle. Bertin was alive,\" he told me, \"I would never permit  _La Esmeralda_ to be set to music; but if some musician should now ask  for this poem, I would be glad to let him have it.\"    The invitation was obvious. Yet, as is generally known, this dramatic  and lyric adaptation of the famous romance is not particularly happy. I  was much embarrassed and I pretended not to understand, but I never  dared to go to Hugo's house again.    Years passed. In 1881 a subscription was taken up to erect a statue to  the author of _La Legende des Siecles_, and they began to plan  celebrations for its dedication, particularly a big affair at the  Trocadero. My imagination took fire at the idea, and I wrote my _Hymne a  Victor Hugo_.    As is well known, the master knew nothing at all about music, and the  same was true of those around him. It is a matter of conjecture how the  master and his followers happened to mistake some absurd and formless  motif for one of Beethoven's sublime inspirations. Victor Hugo adapted  the beautiful verses of _Stella_ to this halting motif. It was published  as an appendix in the _Chatiments_, with a remark about the union of two  geniuses, the fusion of the verse of a great poet with the _admirable_  verse of a great musician. And the poet would have Mme. Drouet play this  marvellous music on the piano from time to time! _Tristia Herculis!_    As I wanted to put in my hymn something peculiar to Victor Hugo, which  could not possibly be attributed to anyone else, I tried to introduce  this motif of which he was so fond. And, by means of numerous tricks  which every musician has up his sleeve, I managed to give it the form  and character which it had lacked.    The subscription did not go fast enough to suit the master, and he had  it stopped. So I put my hymn in a drawer and waited for a better  opportunity.    About this time M. Bruneau, the father of the well-known composer,  conceived the idea of giving spring concerts at the Trocadero. Bruneau  came to see me and asked me if I had some unpublished work which I would  let him have. This was an excellent occasion for the presentation of my  _Hymne_, as it had been written with the Trocadero in mind. The  performance was decided on and Victor Hugo was invited to come and hear  it.    The performance was splendid--a large orchestra, the magnificent organ,  eight harps, and eight trumpets sounding their flourishes in the organ  loft, and a large chorus for the peroration of such splendor that it was  compared to the set pieces at the close of a display of fireworks. The  reception and ovation which the crowd gave the great poet, who rarely  appeared in public, was beyond description. The honeyed incense of the  organ, harps and trumpets was new to him and pleased his Olympian  nostrils.    \"Dine with me to-night,\" he said to me. And from that day on, I often  dined with him informally with M. and Mme. Lockrou, Meurice, Vacquerie  and other close friends. The fare was delightful and unpretentious, and  the conversation was the same. The master sat at the head of the table,  with his grandson and granddaughter on either side, saying little but  always something apropos. Thanks to his vigor, his strong sonorous  voice, and his quiet good humor, he did not seem like an old man, but  rather like an ageless and immortal being, whom Time would never touch.  His presence was just Jove-like enough to inspire respect without  chilling his followers. These small gatherings, which I fully  appreciated, are among the most precious recollections of my life.    Time, alas, goes on, and that fine intellect, which had ever been  unclouded, began to give signs of aberration. One day he said to an  Italian delegation, \"The French are Italians; the Italians are French.  French and Italians ought to go to Africa together and found the United  States of Europe.\"    The red rays of twilight announced the oncoming night.    Those who saw them will never forget his grandiose funeral ceremonies,  that casket under the Arc de Triomphe, covered with a veil of crape,  and that immense crowd which paid homage to the greatest lyric poet of  the century.    There was a committee to make musical preparations and I was a member.  The most extraordinary ideas were proposed. One man wanted to have the  _Marseillaise_ in a minor key. Another wanted violins, for \"violins  produce an excellent effect in the open air.\" Naturally we got nowhere.    The great procession started in perfect order, but, as in all long  processions, gaps occurred. I was astonished to find myself in the  middle of the Champs Elysees, in a wide open space, with no one near me  but Ferdinand de Lesseps, Paul Bert, and a member of the Academie, whose  name I shall not mention as he is worthy of all possible respect.    De Lesseps was then at the height of his glory, and from time to time  applause greeted him as he passed.    Suddenly the Academician leaned over and whispered in my ear,    \"Evidently they are applauding us.\"          CHAPTER IV    THE HISTORY OF AN OPERA-COMIQUE      Young musicians often complain, and not without reason, of the  difficulties of their careers. It may, perhaps, be useful to remind them  that their elders have not always had beds of roses, and that too often  they have had to breast both wind and sea after spending their best  years in port, unable to make a start. These obstacles frequently are  the result of the worst sort of malignity, when it is for the best  interest of everyone--both of the theatres which rebuff them, and the  public which ignores them--that they be permitted to set out under full  sail.    In 1864 one of the most brilliant of the reviews had the following  comments to make on this subject:         Our real duty--and it is a true kindness--is not to encourage them       (beginners) but to discourage them. In art a vocation is       everything, and a vocation needs no one, for God aids. What use is       it to encourage them and their efforts when the public obstinately       refuses to pay any attention to them? If an act is ordered from one       of them, it fails to go. Two or three years later the same thing is       tried again with the same result. No theatre, even if it were four       times as heavily subsidized as the Theatre-Lyrique, could continue       to exist on such resources. So the result is that they turn to       accredited talent and call on such men from outside as Gounod,       Felicien David and Victor Masse. The younger composers at once       shout treason and scandal. Then, they select masterpieces by Mozart       and Weber and there are the same outcries and recriminations. In       the final analysis where are these young composers of genius? Who       are they and what are their names? Let them go to the orchestra and       hear _Le Nozze di Figaro_, _Oberon_, _Freischutz_ and _Orphee_ ...       we are doing something for them by placing such models before them.    The young composers who were thus politely invited to be seated  included, among others, Bizet, Delibes, Massenet, and the writer of  these lines. Massenet and I would have been satisfied with writing a  ballet for the Opera. He proposed the _Rat Catcher_ from an old German  tale, while I proposed _Une nuit de Cleopatra_ on the text of Theophile  Gautier. They refused us the honor, and, when they consented to order a  ballet from Delibes, they did not dare to trust him with the whole work.  They let him do only one act and the other was given to a Hungarian  composer.

The coal-mines at Belfast, with their  towering stacks and clouds of smoke, gave the first evidence of the  country's wondrous underground wealth, and then farther on in the journey  came the small city of Middleburg with its slate-coloured corrugated iron  roofs in marked contrast to the green veld grass surrounding it. There  appeared armed and bandoliered Boers, prepared to join their countrymen in  the field, with wounded friends and sad-faced women to bid farewell to  them. While the train lay waiting at the station small commandos of  burghers came dashing through the dusty streets, bustled their horses into  trucks at the rear end of the passenger train, and in a few moments they  were mingling with the foreign volunteers in the coaches. Grey-haired  Boers gravely bade adieu to their wives and children, lovers embraced  their weeping sweethearts, and the train moved on toward Pretoria and the  battlefields where these men were to risk their lives for the life of  their country.    Historic ground, where Briton and Boer had fought before, came in view.  Bronkhorst Spruit, where a British commander led more than one hundred of  his men to death in 1880, lay to the left of the road in a little wooded  ravine. Farther on toward Pretoria appeared rocky kopjes, where afterwards  the Boers, retreating from the capital city, gathered their disheartened  forces, and resisted the advance of the enemy. Eerste Fabriken was a  hamlet hardly large enough to make an impression upon the memory, but it  marked a battlefield where the burghers fought desperately. Children were  then gathering peaches from the trees, whose roots drank the blood of  heroes months afterwards. Several miles farther on were the hills on the  outskirts of Pretoria, where, in the war of 1881, the Boer laagers sent  forth men to encompass the city and to prevent the British besieged in it  from escaping. It was ground hallowed in Boer history since the early  voortrekkers crossed the ridges of the Magaliesberg and sought protection  from the savage hordes of Moselekatse in the fertile valley of the Aapjes  River.    Pretoria in war-time was most peaceful. In the days before the  commencement of hostilities it was a city of peace as contrasted with the  metropolis, Johannesburg, and its warring citizens, but when cannon were  roaring on the frontier, Pretoria itself seemed to escape even the echoes.  After the first commandos had departed the city streets were deserted, and  only women and children gathered at the bulletin boards to learn the fate  of the burgher armies. The stoeps of houses and cottages were deserted of  the bearded yeomanry, and the halls of the Government buildings resounded  only with the tread of those who were not old or strong enough to bear  arms. The long ox-waggons which in former times were so common in the  streets were not so frequently to be seen, but whenever one of them rolled  toward the market square, it was a Boer woman who cracked the raw-hide  whip over the heads of the oxen. Pretoria was the same quaint city as of  old, but it lacked the men who were its most distinguishing feature. The  black-garbed Volksraad members, the officials, and the old retired  farmers, who were wont to discuss politics on the stoeps of the capitol  and the Transvaal Hotel were absent. Inquiries concerning them could be  addressed only to women and children, and the replies invariably were:  \"They are on commando,\" or, \"They were killed in battle.\"    The scenes of activity in the city were few in number, and they were  chiefly in connection with the arrival of foreign volunteers and the  transit of burgher commandos on the way to the field. The Grand Hotel and  the Transvaal Hotel, the latter of which was conducted by the Government  for the temporary entertainment of the volunteers, were constantly filled  with throngs of foreigners, comprising soldiers of fortune, Red Cross  delegations, visitors, correspondents, and contractors, and almost every  language except that of the Boers could be heard in the corridors.  Occasionally a Boer burgher on leave of absence from the front appeared at  the hotels for a respite from army rations, or to attend the funeral of a  comrade in arms, but the foreigners were always predominant. Across the  street, in the War Department, there were busy scenes when the volunteers  applied for their equipments, and frequently there were stormy actions  when the European tastes of the men were offended by the equipment offered  by the Department officials. Men who desired swords and artistic  paraphernalia for themselves and their horses felt slighted when the scant  but serviceable equipment of a Boer burgher was offered to them, but  sulking could not remedy the matter, and usually they were content to  accept whatever was given to them. Former officers in European armies,  noblemen and even professional men were constantly arriving in the city,  and all seemed to be of the same opinion that commissions in the Boer army  could be had for the asking. Some of these had their minds disabused with  good grace, and went to the field as common burghers; others sulked for  several weeks, but finally joined a commando, and a few returned to their  homes without having heard the report of a gun. For those who chose to  remain behind and enjoy the peacefulness of Pretoria, there was always  enough of novelty and excitement among the foreigners to compensate partly  for missing the events in the field.    The army contractors make their presence felt in all countries which are  engaged in war, and Pretoria was filled with them. They were in the  railway trains running to and from Lorenzo Marques; in the hotel  corridors, in all the Government departments, and everywhere in the city.  A few of the naturalised Boers, who were most denunciatory of the British  before the war and urged their fellow-countrymen to resort to arms,  succeeded in evading the call to the field and were most energetic in  supplying bread and supplies to the Government. Nor was their patriotism  dimmed by many reverses of the army, and they selfishly demanded that the  war should be continued indefinitely. Europeans and Americans who partook  of the protection of the Government in times of peace, were transformed by  war into grasping, insinuating contractors who revelled in the country's  misfortune. Englishmen, unworthy of the name, enriched themselves by  furnishing sinews of war to their country's enemy, and in order to secure  greater wealth sought to prolong the war by cheering disheartened Boers  and expressing faith in their final success. The chambers of the  Government building were filled with men who had horses, waggons, flour,  forage and clothing to offer at exorbitant prices, and in thousands of  instances the embarrassed Government was obliged to pay whatever sums were  demanded. Hand-in-hand with the contractors were the speculators who were  taking advantage of the absence of the leading officials to secure  valuable concessions, mining claims, and even gold mines. Before the war,  when hordes of speculators and concession-seekers thronged the city, the  scene was pathetic enough, but when all shrewd Raad members were at the  front and unable to guard their country's interests the picture was dark  and pitiful.    Pretoria seemed to have but one mood during the war. It was never deeply  despondent nor gay. There was a sort of funereal atmosphere throughout the  city, whether its residents were rejoicing over a Spion Kop or suffering  from the dejection of a Paardeberg. It was the same grim throng of old  men, women, and children who watched the processions of prisoners of war  and attended the funerals at the quaint little Dutch church in the centre  of the city. The finest victories of the army never changed the appearance  of the city nor the mood of its inhabitants. There were no parades nor  shouting when a victory was announced, and there was the same stoical  indifference when the news of a bitter defeat was received. A victory was  celebrated in the Dutch church by the singing of psalms, and a defeat by  the offering of prayers for the success of the army.    The thousands of British subjects who were allowed to remain in the  Transvaal, being of a less phlegmatic race, were not so calm when a  victory of their nation's army was announced, and when the news of  Cronje's surrender reached them they celebrated the event with almost as  much gusto as if they had not been in the enemy's country. A fancy dress  ball was held in Johannesburg in honour of the event, and a champagne  dinner was given within a few yards of the Government buildings in  Pretoria, but a few days later all the celebrants were transported across  the border by order of the Government.    One of the pathetic features of Pretoria was the Boers' expression of  faith in foreign mediation or intervention. At the outset of hostilities  it seemed unreasonable that any European nation or America would risk a  war with Great Britain for the purpose of assisting the Boers, yet there  was hardly one burgher who did not cling steadfastly to the opinion that  the war would be ended in such a manner. The idea had evidently been  rooted in their mind that Russia would take advantage of Great Britain's  entanglement in South Africa to occupy Herat and Northern India, and when  a newspaper item to that effect appeared it was gravely presumed to  indicate the beginning of the end. Some over-zealous Irishmen assured the  Boers that, in the event of a South African war, their fellow-countrymen  in the United States would invade Canada and"]]]
