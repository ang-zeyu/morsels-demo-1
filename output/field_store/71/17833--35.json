I came--\"    \"Oh, I know, I know. You came to see after your sister's things, but  still, if you look at it a little more carefully, you will see that it  _was_ a coincidence that you should be by nature a man of prompt action.  Nine men out of ten in your place--still, I'm not depressed. You cannot  say, Holland, that I behave or talk like a man who has ten years of hard  labour before him, can you? I dare say you have never been thrown with a  person who showed less anxiety. Yet as a matter of fact, there is  something preying on my mind. Something entirely aside from anything you  could imagine.\"    \"You don't tell me!\" said Geoffrey, who did not know whether to be most  amused or infuriated by his companion's conversation.    \"I am about to tell you,\" said McVay graciously, \"I am very seriously  worried about my sister. In fact I don't see that there is any getting  away from it; you will have to let me go out for an hour or so and get  her.\"    \"Let you do _what_?\"    \"Get my sister. She's living in a little hut in your woods, and I am  actually afraid she will be snowed up.\"    \"It seems highly probable.\"    \"Well, then, I must go and get her.\"    Geoffrey stared at him a moment, and then said: \"You must be crazy.\"    \"Maybe I am,\" answered McVay, as if the suggestion were not without an  amusing side. \"Maybe I am, but that is not the point. Think of a girl,  Holland, alone, all night, in such a storm. Now, I put it to you: it is  not a position in which you would leave your sister, is it?\"    Geoffrey began a sentence and finding it inadequate, contented himself  with a laugh.    \"There you see,\" said McVay. \"It's out of the question. The place is  draughty, too, though there is a stove. Do you remember the house at  all? You would be surprised to see how nicely I've fixed it up for her.\"    \"No doubt I should,\" replied Holland, thinking of the Vaughan and  Marheim valuables.    \"It is surprisingly livable, but it _is_ draughty,\" McVay went on. \"The  truth is I ought to have gone south, as I meant to do last week. But one  cannot foresee everything. The winters have been open until Christmas so  often lately. However, I made a mistake and I am perfectly willing to  rectify it. If you have no objection, I'll go and bring her back here.\"    \"If you have any respect for your skin you won't move from that chair.\"    \"Oh, the devil, Holland, don't be so--\" he hesitated for the right word,  not wishing to be unjust,--\"so obtuse. Listen to that wind! It's cold  here. Think what it must be in that shanty.\"    \"Very unpleasant, I should think.\"    \"More than that, more than that,--suffering, I have no doubt. Why, she  might freeze to death if anything went wrong with the fire. It is not  safe. It's a distinct risk to leave her. Let alone that a storm like  this would scare any girl alone in a place like that, there is some  danger to her life. Don't you see that?\"    \"Yes, I see,\" returned Geoffrey, \"but you ought to have thought of that  before you came burgling in a blizzard.\"    \"Thought of it! Of course I thought of it. But I had no idea whatever of  being caught, with old McFarlane laid up and the two boys away, it did  seem about the safest job yet.\"    There was a pause, for Geoffrey evidently had no intention of even  arguing the matter, and presently McVay continued:    \"Now you know you would feel badly to-morrow morning if anything went  wrong with her, and you knew you could have helped it!\"    \"Helped it!\" said Geoffrey. \"What do you mean? Let you loose on the  county for the sake of a story no sane man would believe?\"    \"Well,\" returned McVay judicially, \"perhaps you could not do that, but,\"  he added brightly, \"you could go yourself.\"    \"Yes,\" said Geoffrey, \"I _could_--\"    \"Then I think you ought to be getting along.\"    \"Upon my word, McVay,\" said Holland, \"you are something of a humorist,  aren't you?\"    McVay again looked puzzled, but rose to the occasion.    \"Oh, hardly that,\" he said. \"Every now and then I have a way of putting  things,--a way of my own. I find often I am able to amuse people, but if  you are cheerful yourself, you make other people so. I was just thinking  that it must be a great thing for men who have been in prison for years  to have some one come in with a new point of view.\"    \"I'm sure you will be an addition to prison life. It's an ill wind, you  know.\"    \"It's an ill wind for my sister, literally enough. Come, Holland, you  certainly can trust me. Do be starting.\"    \"Why, what do you take me for?\" said the exasperated Geoffrey. \"Do you  really suppose that I am going, looking for a den of your accomplices in  order to give you a chance to escape?\"    \"'Accomplices!'\" exclaimed McVay; and for the first time a shade of  anger crossed his brow; \"'_accomplices'_! I have no accomplices.  Anything I do I think I am able to do alone. Still,\" he added putting  aside his annoyance, \"if you feel nervous about leaving me I'd just as  lief give you my word of honour to stay here until you come back.\"    \"Your _what_?\"    McVay made a slight gesture of his shoulders, as if he were being a good  deal tried. \"Oh, anything you like,\" he said. \"I suppose you could lock  me up in a closet.\"    \"I don't think we need trouble to arrange the details,\" said Geoffrey  drily. \"But I'll tell you what I will do. After I get you safely in jail  to-morrow, I'll get a trap and go and look up this hut.\"    \"It may be too late then.\"    \"It may,\" said Geoffrey, and continued to read.    Yet he had no further satisfaction in his book. He knew that the burglar  kept casting meditative glances at him as if in wonder at such  brutality, and in truth, his own mind was not entirely at ease. If by  any chance the story were true,--if there was a woman at his doors  freezing to death, how could he sit enjoying the fire? But, on the other  hand, could any one have a more evident motive for deception than his  informant? What better opportunity for escape could be arranged? It was  so evident, so impudent as to be almost convincing. What more likely for  instance, than that the hut was a regular rendezvous for criminals and  tramps, that by going he would be walking into the veriest trap? Yet  again there was the report confirmed by Harris's story that a woman was  in some way connected with these robberies. The wind whistled round the  house with a suggestion of difficulty, of combat with the elements, of  actual danger, perhaps, that suddenly gave Geoffrey a new view of delay.  Had it not something the air of cowardice, or at least of laziness? He  found his eyes had read the same page three times, while his brain was  busy devising means by which McVay could be secured in his absence--if  he went.    At length he rose suddenly to his feet.    \"I'll go,\" he said, \"but before I go, I'll tie you up so safely that, if  I don't come back, you'll starve to death before you'll be able to get  out or make any one hear you. On these terms do you still want me to  go?\"    \"Oh, yes, I want you to go,\" said McVay, \"only for goodness sake be  careful. If you should feel any temptation to lie down and go to sleep  don't yield to it; they say it's fatal. The great thing is to keep on  walking--\"    \"Oh, shut up,\" said Geoffrey. In view of the possibility that he was  going to meet death at the hands of his fluent companion's accomplices  he found this friendly advice unbearable.    \"This hut, I take it,\" he said, \"is an old woodcutter's shanty in the  north woods?\"    \"Yes, something over a mile and a half north of here.\"    \"I know the place,\" said Geoffrey, \"now come along, and we'll see how I  can fix you up until I come back.\"    He had in mind a heavy upstairs cedar-closet. It had been designed by a  thoughtful architect for the storing of summer wearing apparel, and was  strongly built. It had besides the advantage of having a door that  opened in and so was difficult to break open from the inside. Here,  having removed a complete burglar's outfit from his pockets, Geoffrey  disposed McVay, being met with a readiness on McVay's part that seemed  to prove either that he was sincere in his belief in Holland's safe  return, or else was perfectly confident of being able to open the door  as soon as Geoffrey's back was turned.    \"But he'll find himself mistaken,\" Geoffrey murmured as, having locked  the door, he turned away. At this instant a faint knocking was audible,  and, gathering that McVay had some final instructions to give, Geoffrey  again opened the door.    \"By the way,\" said the burglar, and for the first time a certain  constraint, amounting almost to embarrassment, was discernible in his  manner, \"my sister has no idea about--it would be a great shock to  her--in fact, you understand, she has not discovered exactly how our  money comes to us.\"    \"Do you expect me to believe that?\" asked Geoffrey.    \"I grant it does not sound likely,\" returned McVay, \"and indeed would  not be possible with any other man than myself. But I hit upon a pretty  good yarn,--worked out well everyway. I told her--\"    \"I don't want to hear your infernal lies.\"    \"But it might be convenient for you to know. I told her,\" McVay  chuckled, \"that I was employed as night watchman at Drake's paper mill.  That of course kept me out all night, and--\"    \"She must think night watchmen get good wages.\"    \"That was just it. I told her Drake was an old friend of mine, and just  wanted an excuse to give me an allowance until he found me a better job.  You see I just lost a nice job in a bank--\"    \"I suppose it would be indiscreet to inquire why?\"    \"Well, we won't discuss it,\" said McVay with an agreeable smile. \"Of  course she could understand that such an inferior position as a  watchman's had to be kept a profound secret, hence our remote mode of  life, and the fact that I don't allow a butcher or baker to come near"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1484"],[0,"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (#4)"],[1,"matters. How could this  event concern the martial Counsellor? The two nations would soon come to  an understanding. Diplomacy sometimes amounted to something.    \"No,\" insisted the German ferociously. \"It is war, blessed war. Russia  will sustain Servia, and we will support our ally. . . . What will  France do? Do you know what France will do?\" . . .    Julio shrugged his shoulders testily as though asking to be left out of  all international discussions.    \"It is war,\" asserted the Counsellor, \"the preventive war that we need.  Russia is growing too fast, and is preparing to fight us. Four years  more of peace and she will have finished her strategic railroads, and  her military power, united to that of her allies, will be worth as much  as ours. It is better to strike a powerful blow now. It is necessary to  take advantage of this opportunity. . . . War. Preventive war!\"    All his clan were listening in silence. Some did not appear to feel the  contagion of his enthusiasm. War! . . . In imagination they saw their  business paralyzed, their agencies bankrupt, the banks cutting down  credit . . . a catastrophe more frightful to them than the slaughters  of battles. But they applauded with nods and grunts all of Erckmann's  ferocious demonstrations. He was a Herr Rath, and an officer besides.  He must be in the secrets of the destiny of his country, and that was  enough to make them drink silently to the success of the war.    Julio thought that the Counsellor and his admirers must be drunk. \"Look  here, Captain,\" he said in a conciliatory tone, \"what you say lacks  logic. How could war possibly be acceptable to industrial Germany? Every  moment its business is increasing, every month it conquers a new  market and every year its commercial balance soars upward in unheard of  proportions. Sixty years ago, it had to man its boats with Berlin  hack drivers arrested by the police. Now its commercial fleets and war  vessels cross all oceans, and there is no port where the German merchant  marine does not occupy the greatest part of the docks. It would only be  necessary to continue living in this way, to put yourselves beyond the  exigencies of war! Twenty years more of peace, and the Germans would be  lords of the world's commerce, conquering England, the former mistress  of the seas, in a bloodless struggle. And are they going to risk all  this--like a gambler who stakes his entire fortune on a single card--in  a struggle that might result unfavorably?\" . . .    \"No, war,\" insisted the Counsellor furiously, \"preventive war. We live  surrounded by our enemies, and this state of things cannot go on. It is  best to end it at once. Either they or we! Germany feels herself strong  enough to challenge the world. We've got to put an end to this Russian  menace! And if France doesn't keep herself quiet, so much the worse for  her! . . . And if anyone else . . . ANYONE dares to come in against us,  so much the worse for him! When I set up a new machine in my shops, it  is to make it produce unceasingly. We possess the finest army in the  world, and it is necessary to give it exercise that it may not rust  out.\"    He then continued with heavy emphasis, \"They have put a band of iron  around us in order to throttle us. But Germany has a strong chest and  has only to expand in order to burst its bands. We must awake before  they manacle us in our sleep. Woe to those who then oppose us! . . .\"    Desnoyers felt obliged to reply to this arrogance. He had never seen  the iron circle of which the Germans were complaining. The nations were  merely unwilling to continue living, unsuspecting and inactive,  before boundless German ambition. They were simply preparing to defend  themselves against an almost certain attack. They wished to maintain  their dignity, repeatedly violated under most absurd pretexts.    \"I wonder if it is not the others,\" he concluded, \"who are obliged to  defend themselves because you represent a menace to the world!\"    An invisible hand sought his under the table, as it had some nights  before, to recommend prudence; but now he clasped it forcibly with the  authority of a right acquired.    \"Oh, sir!\" sighed the sweet Bertha, \"to talk like that, a youth so  distinguished who has . . .\"    She was not able to finish, for her husband interrupted. They were no  longer in American waters, and the Counsellor expressed himself with the  rudeness of a master of his house.    \"I have the honor to inform you, young man,\" he said, imitating the  cutting coldness of the diplomats, \"that you are merely a South American  and know nothing of the affairs of Europe.\"    He did not call him an \"Indian,\" but Julio heard the implication as  though he had used the word itself. Ah, if that hidden handclasp had not  held him with its sentimental thrills! . . . But this contact kept him  calm and even made him smile. \"Thanks, Captain,\" he said to himself. \"It  is the least you can do to get even with me!\"    Here his relations with the German and his clientele came to an end. The  merchants, as they approached nearer and nearer to their native land,  began casting off that servile desire of ingratiating themselves which  they had assumed in all their trips to the new world. They now had more  important things to occupy them. The telegraphic service was working  without cessation. The Commandant of the vessel was conferring in his  apartment with the Counsellor as his compatriot of most importance.  His friends were hunting out the most obscure places in order to  talk confidentially with one another. Even Bertha commenced to avoid  Desnoyers. She was still smiling distantly at him, but that smile was  more of a souvenir than a reality.    Between Lisbon and the coast of England, Julio spoke with her husband  for the last time. Every morning was appearing on the bulletin board the  alarming news transmitted by radiograph. The Empire was arming itself  against its enemies. God would punish them, making all manner of  troubles fall upon them. Desnoyers was motionless with astonishment  before the last piece of news--\"Three hundred thousand revolutionists  are now besieging Paris. The suburbs are beginning to burn. The horrors  of the Commune have broken out again.\"    \"My, but these Germans have gone mad!\" exclaimed the disgusted youth to  the curious group surrounding the radio-sheet. \"We are going to lose  the little sense that we have left! . . . What revolutionists are they  talking about? How could a revolution break out in Paris if the men of  the government are not reactionary?\"    A gruff voice sounded behind him, rude, authoritative, as if trying to  banish the doubts of the audience. It was the Herr Comerzienrath who was  speaking.    \"Young man, these notices are sent us by the first agencies of Germany  . . . and Germany never lies.\"    After this affirmation, he turned his back upon them and they saw him no  more.    On the following morning, the last day of the voyage. Desnoyers' steward  awoke him in great excitement. \"Herr, come up on deck! a most beautiful  spectacle!\"    The sea was veiled by the fog, but behind its hazy curtains could be  distinguished some silhouettes like islands with great towers and sharp,  pointed minarets. The islands were advancing over the oily waters slowly  and majestically, with impressive dignity. Julio counted eighteen. They  appeared to fill the ocean. It was the Channel Fleet which had just left  the English coast by Government order, sailing around simply to show  its strength. Seeing this procession of dreadnoughts for the first  time, Desnoyers was reminded of a flock of marine monsters, and gained  a better idea of the British power. The German ship passed among them,  shrinking, humiliated, quickening its speed. \"One might suppose,\" mused  the youth, \"that she had an uneasy conscience and wished to scud to  safety.\" A South American passenger near him was jesting with one of  the Germans, \"What if they have already declared war! . . . What if they  should make us prisoners!\"    After midday, they entered Southampton roads. The Frederic August  hurried to get away as soon as possible, and transacted business with  dizzying celerity. The cargo of passengers and baggage was enormous.  Two launches approached the transatlantic and discharged an avalanche of  Germans residents in England who invaded the decks with the joy of those  who tread friendly soil, desiring to see Hamburg as soon as possible.  Then the boat sailed through the Channel with a speed most unusual in  these places.    The people, leaning on the railing, were commenting on the extraordinary  encounters in this marine boulevard, usually frequented by ships of  peace. Certain smoke lines on the horizon were from the French squadron  carrying President Poincare who was returning from Russia. The European  alarm had interrupted his trip. Then they saw more English vessels  patrolling the coast line like aggressive and vigilant dogs. Two North  American battleships could be distinguished by their mast-heads in the  form of baskets. Then a Russian battleship, white and glistening, passed  at full steam on its way to the Baltic. \"Bad!\" said the South American  passengers regretfully. \"Very bad! It looks this time as if it were  going to be serious!\" and they glanced uneasily at the neighboring  coasts on both sides. Although they presented the usual appearance,  behind them, perhaps, a new period of history was in the making.    The transatlantic was due at Boulogne at midnight where it was supposed  to wait until daybreak to discharge its passengers comfortably. It  arrived, nevertheless, at ten, dropped anchor outside the harbor, and  the Commandant gave orders that the disembarkation should take place  in less than an hour. For this reason they had quickened their speed,  consuming a vast amount of extra coal. It was necessary to get away  as soon as possible, seeking the refuge of Hamburg. The"]]]
