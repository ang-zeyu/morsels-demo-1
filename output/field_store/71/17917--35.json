SOCRATES: Well, but speaking of men, Euthyphro, did you ever hear any  one arguing that a murderer or any sort of evil-doer ought to be let  off?    EUTHYPHRO: I should rather say that these are the questions which they  are always arguing, especially in courts of law: they commit all sorts  of crimes, and there is nothing which they will not do or say in their  own defence.    SOCRATES: But do they admit their guilt, Euthyphro, and yet say that  they ought not to be punished?    EUTHYPHRO: No; they do not.    SOCRATES: Then there are some things which they do not venture to say  and do: for they do not venture to argue that the guilty are to be  unpunished, but they deny their guilt, do they not?    EUTHYPHRO: Yes.    SOCRATES: Then they do not argue that the evil-doer should not be  punished, but they argue about the fact of who the evil-doer is, and  what he did and when?    EUTHYPHRO: True.    SOCRATES: And the gods are in the same case, if as you assert they  quarrel about just and unjust, and some of them say while others deny  that injustice is done among them. For surely neither God nor man will  ever venture to say that the doer of injustice is not to be punished?    EUTHYPHRO: That is true, Socrates, in the main.    SOCRATES: But they join issue about the particulars--gods and men alike;  and, if they dispute at all, they dispute about some act which is called  in question, and which by some is affirmed to be just, by others to be  unjust. Is not that true?    EUTHYPHRO: Quite true.    SOCRATES: Well then, my dear friend Euthyphro, do tell me, for my better  instruction and information, what proof have you that in the opinion of  all the gods a servant who is guilty of murder, and is put in chains by  the master of the dead man, and dies because he is put in chains before  he who bound him can learn from the interpreters of the gods what he  ought to do with him, dies unjustly; and that on behalf of such an one  a son ought to proceed against his father and accuse him of murder. How  would you show that all the gods absolutely agree in approving of his  act? Prove to me that they do, and I will applaud your wisdom as long as  I live.    EUTHYPHRO: It will be a difficult task; but I could make the matter very  clear indeed to you.    SOCRATES: I understand; you mean to say that I am not so quick of  apprehension as the judges: for to them you will be sure to prove that  the act is unjust, and hateful to the gods.    EUTHYPHRO: Yes indeed, Socrates; at least if they will listen to me.    SOCRATES: But they will be sure to listen if they find that you are a  good speaker. There was a notion that came into my mind while you were  speaking; I said to myself: 'Well, and what if Euthyphro does prove to  me that all the gods regarded the death of the serf as unjust, how do I  know anything more of the nature of piety and impiety? for granting that  this action may be hateful to the gods, still piety and impiety are not  adequately defined by these distinctions, for that which is hateful  to the gods has been shown to be also pleasing and dear to them.' And  therefore, Euthyphro, I do not ask you to prove this; I will suppose, if  you like, that all the gods condemn and abominate such an action. But I  will amend the definition so far as to say that what all the gods hate  is impious, and what they love pious or holy; and what some of them  love and others hate is both or neither. Shall this be our definition of  piety and impiety?    EUTHYPHRO: Why not, Socrates?    SOCRATES: Why not! certainly, as far as I am concerned, Euthyphro, there  is no reason why not. But whether this admission will greatly assist you  in the task of instructing me as you promised, is a matter for you to  consider.    EUTHYPHRO: Yes, I should say that what all the gods love is pious and  holy, and the opposite which they all hate, impious.    SOCRATES: Ought we to enquire into the truth of this, Euthyphro, or  simply to accept the mere statement on our own authority and that of  others? What do you say?    EUTHYPHRO: We should enquire; and I believe that the statement will  stand the test of enquiry.    SOCRATES: We shall know better, my good friend, in a little while. The  point which I should first wish to understand is whether the pious or  holy is beloved by the gods because it is holy, or holy because it is  beloved of the gods.    EUTHYPHRO: I do not understand your meaning, Socrates.    SOCRATES: I will endeavour to explain: we, speak of carrying and we  speak of being carried, of leading and being led, seeing and being seen.  You know that in all such cases there is a difference, and you know also  in what the difference lies?    EUTHYPHRO: I think that I understand.    SOCRATES: And is not that which is beloved distinct from that which  loves?    EUTHYPHRO: Certainly.    SOCRATES: Well; and now tell me, is that which is carried in this state  of carrying because it is carried, or for some other reason?    EUTHYPHRO: No; that is the reason.    SOCRATES: And the same is true of what is led and of what is seen?    EUTHYPHRO: True.    SOCRATES: And a thing is not seen because it is visible, but conversely,  visible because it is seen; nor is a thing led because it is in the  state of being led, or carried because it is in the state of being  carried, but the converse of this. And now I think, Euthyphro, that  my meaning will be intelligible; and my meaning is, that any state of  action or passion implies previous action or passion. It does not become  because it is becoming, but it is in a state of becoming because it  becomes; neither does it suffer because it is in a state of suffering,  but it is in a state of suffering because it suffers. Do you not agree?    EUTHYPHRO: Yes.    SOCRATES: Is not that which is loved in some state either of becoming or  suffering?    EUTHYPHRO: Yes.    SOCRATES: And the same holds as in the previous instances; the state of  being loved follows the act of being loved, and not the act the state.    EUTHYPHRO: Certainly.    SOCRATES: And what do you say of piety, Euthyphro: is not piety,  according to your definition, loved by all the gods?    EUTHYPHRO: Yes.    SOCRATES: Because it is pious or holy, or for some other reason?    EUTHYPHRO: No, that is the reason.    SOCRATES: It is loved because it is holy, not holy because it is loved?    EUTHYPHRO: Yes.    SOCRATES: And that which is dear to the gods is loved by them, and is in  a state to be loved of them because it is loved of them?    EUTHYPHRO: Certainly.    SOCRATES: Then that which is dear to the gods, Euthyphro, is not holy,  nor is that which is holy loved of God, as you affirm; but they are two  different things.    EUTHYPHRO: How do you mean, Socrates?    SOCRATES: I mean to say that the holy has been acknowledged by us to be  loved of God because it is holy, not to be holy because it is loved.    EUTHYPHRO: Yes.    SOCRATES: But that which is dear to the gods is dear to them because it  is loved by them, not loved by them because it is dear to them.    EUTHYPHRO: True.    SOCRATES: But, friend Euthyphro, if that which is holy is the same with  that which is dear to God, and is loved because it is holy, then that  which is dear to God would have been loved as being dear to God; but if  that which is dear to God is dear to him because loved by him, then that  which is holy would have been holy because loved by him. But now you see  that the reverse is the case, and that they are quite different from  one another. For one (theophiles) is of a kind to be loved cause it  is loved, and the other (osion) is loved because it is of a kind to  be loved. Thus you appear to me, Euthyphro, when I ask you what is  the essence of holiness, to offer an attribute only, and not the  essence--the attribute of being loved by all the gods. But you still  refuse to explain to me the nature of holiness. And therefore, if you  please, I will ask you not to hide your treasure, but to tell me once  more what holiness or piety really is, whether dear to the gods or not  (for that is a matter about which we will not quarrel); and what is  impiety?    EUTHYPHRO: I really do not know, Socrates, how to express what I mean.  For somehow or other our arguments, on whatever ground we rest them,  seem to turn round and walk away from us.    SOCRATES: Your words, Euthyphro, are like the handiwork of my ancestor  Daedalus; and if I were the sayer or propounder of them, you might say  that my arguments walk away and will not remain fixed where they are  placed because I am a descendant of his. But now, since these notions  are your own, you must find some other gibe, for they certainly, as you  yourself allow, show an inclination to be on the move.    EUTHYPHRO: Nay, Socrates, I shall still say that you are the Daedalus  who sets arguments in motion; not I, certainly, but you make them  move or go round, for they would never have stirred, as far as I am  concerned.    SOCRATES: Then I must be a greater than Daedalus: for whereas he only  made his own inventions to move, I move those of other people as well.  And the beauty of it is, that I would rather not. For I would give the  wisdom of Daedalus, and the wealth of Tantalus, to be able to detain  them and keep them fixed. But enough of this. As I perceive that you are  lazy, I will myself endeavour to show you how you might instruct me in  the nature of piety; and I hope that you will not grudge your labour.  Tell me, then--Is not that which is pious necessarily just?    EUTHYPHRO: Yes.    SOCRATES: And is, then, all which is just pious? or, is that which is  pious all just, but that which is just, only in part and not all, pious?    EUTHYPHRO: I do not understand you, Socrates.    SOCRATES: And yet I know that you are as much wiser than I am, as you  are younger. But, as I was saying, revered friend, the abundance of your  wisdom makes you lazy.

TARPEY  _sitting at it._ MAGISTRATE _and_ POLICEMAN _enter._      MAGISTRATE. So that is the Fair Green. Cattle and sheep and mud.  No system. What a repulsive sight!    POLICEMAN. That is so, indeed.    MAGISTRATE. I suppose there is a good deal of disorder in this  place?    POLICEMAN. There is.    MAGISTRATE. Common assault?    POLICEMAN. It's common enough.    MAGISTRATE. Agrarian crime, no doubt?    POLICEMAN. That is so.    MAGISTRATE. Boycotting? Maiming of cattle? Firing into houses?    POLICEMAN. There was one time, and there might be again.    MAGISTRATE. That is bad. Does it go any farther than that?    POLICEMAN. Far enough, indeed.    MAGISTRATE. Homicide, then! This district has been shamefully  neglected! I will change all that. When I was in the Andaman  Islands, my system never failed. Yes, yes, I will change all  that. What has that woman on her stall?    POLICEMAN. Apples mostly--and sweets.    MAGISTRATE. Just see if there are any unlicensed goods  underneath--spirits or the like. We had evasions of the salt tax  in the Andaman Islands.    POLICEMAN (_sniffing cautiously and upsetting a heap of apples_). I  see no spirits here--or salt.    MAGISTRATE (_to_ MRS. TARPEY). Do you know this town well, my good  woman?    MRS. TARPEY (_holding out some apples_). A penny the half-dozen,  your honor.    POLICEMAN (_shouting_). The gentleman is asking do you know the  town! He's the new magistrate!    MRS. TARPEY (_rising and ducking_). Do I know the town? I do, to be  sure.    MAGISTRATE (_shouting_). What is its chief business?    MRS, TARPEY. Business, is it? What business would the people here  have but to be minding one another's business?    MAGISTRATE. I mean what trade have they?    MRS. TARPEY. Not a trade. No trade at all but to be talking.    MAGISTRATE. I shall learn nothing here.    (JAMES RYAN _comes in, pipe in mouth. Seeing MAGISTRATE, he  retreats quickly, taking pipe from mouth._)    MAGISTRATE. The smoke from that man's pipe had a greenish look;  he may be growing unlicensed tobacco at home. I wish I had  brought my telescope to this district. Come to the post-office; I  will telegraph for it. I found it very useful in the Andaman  Islands.    (MAGISTRATE _and_ POLICEMAN _go out left._)    MRS. TARPEY. Bad luck to Jo Muldoon, knocking my apples this way  and that way. (_Begins arranging them._) Showing off he was to the  new magistrate.    (_Enter_ BARTLEY FALLON _and_ MRS. FALLON.)    BARTLEY. Indeed it's a poor country and a scarce country to be  living in. But I'm thinking if I went to America it's long ago  the day I'd be dead!    MRS. FALLON. So you might, indeed.    (_She puts her basket on a barrel and begins putting parcels in  it, taking them from under her cloak._)    BARTLEY. And it's a great expense for a poor man to be buried in  America.    MRS. FALLON. Never fear, Bartley Fallon, but I'll give you a good  burying the day you'll die.    BARTLEY. Maybe it's yourself will be buried in the graveyard of  Cloonmara before me, Mary Fallon, and I myself that will be dying  unbeknownst some night, and no one a-near me. And the cat itself  may be gone straying through the country, and the mice squealing  over the quilt.    MRS. FALLON. Leave off talking of dying. It might be twenty years  you'll be living yet.    BARTLEY (_with a deep sigh_). I'm thinking if I'll be living at the  end of twenty years, it's a very old man I'll be then!    MRS. TARPEY (_turns and sees them_). Good-morrow, Bartley Fallon;  good-morrow, Mrs. Fallon. Well, Bartley, you'll find no cause for  complaining to-day; they are all saying it was a good fair.    BARTLEY (_raising his voice_). It was not a good fair, Mrs. Tarpey.  It was a scattered sort of a fair. If we didn't expect more, we  got less. That's the way with me always: whatever I have to sell  goes down and whatever I have to buy goes up. If there's ever any  misfortune coming to this world, it's on myself it pitches, like  a flock of crows on seed potatoes.    MRS. FALLON. Leave off talking of misfortunes, and listen to Jack  Smith that is coming the way, and he singing.    (_Voice of JACK SMITH heard singing_)      I thought, my first love,      There'd be but one house between you and me.    And I thought I would find      Yourself coaxing my child on your knee.    Over the tide      I would leap with the leap of a swan.    Till I came to the side      Of the wife of the red-haired man!    (JACK SMITH _comes in; he is a red-haired man, and is carrying a  hayfork._)    MRS. TARPEY. That should be a good song if I had my hearing.    MRS. FALLON (_shouting_). It's \"The Red-haired Man's Wife.\"    MRS. TARPEY. I know it well. That's the song that has a skin on  it!    (_She turns her back to them and goes on arranging her apples._)    MRS. FALLON. Where's herself, Jack Smith?    JACK SMITH. She was delayed with her washing; bleaching the  clothes on the hedge she is, and she daren't leave them, with all  the tinkers that do be passing to the fair. It isn't to the fair  I came myself, but up to the Five-Acre Meadow I'm going, where I  have a contract for the hay. We'll get a share of it into tramps  to-day.    (_He lays down hayfork and lights his pipe._)    BARTLEY. You will not get it into tramps to-day. The rain will be  down on it by evening, and on myself too. It's seldom I ever  started on a journey but the rain would come down on me before  I'd find any place of shelter.    JACK SMITH. If it didn't itself, Bartley, it is my belief you  would carry a leaky pail on your head in place of a hat, the way  you'd not be without some cause of complaining.    (_A voice heard: \"Go on, now, go on out o' that. Go on, I say.\"_)    JACK SMITH. Look at that young mare of Pat Ryan's that is backing  into Shaughnessy's bullocks with the dint of the crowd! Don't be  daunted, Pat, I'll give you a hand with her. (_He goes out,  leaving his hayfork._)    MRS. FALLON. It's time for"]]]
