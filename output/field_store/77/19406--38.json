Sec. 1. Our Ancestors, of Happy Memory, tell us, that there is an Island in  the _Indian_ Ocean, situate under the Equinoctial, where Men come into  the world spontaneously without the help of Father and Mother. This  Island it seems, is blest with such a due Influence of the Sun, as to be  the most temperate and perfect of all places in the Creation; tho' it  must be confess'd that such an Assertion is contrary to the Opinion of  the most celebrated Philosophers and Physicians, who affirm that the  fourth Climate is the most Temperate. Now if the reason which they give  for this Assertion, viz. _That these parts situate under the Equinoctial  are not habitable_; were drawn, from any Impediment from the Earth, 'tis  allow'd that it would appear more probable; but if the reason be,  because of the intense Heat (which is that which most of 'em assign)  'tis absolutely false, and the contrary is prov'd by undeniable  demonstration. For 'tis demonstrated in Natural Philosophy, that there  is no other cause of Heat than Motion, or else the Contact and Light of  Hot Bodies. 'Tis also prov'd that the Sun, in it self, is not hot, nor  partakes of any mix'd Quality: 'tis prov'd moreover, that the thickest  and smoothest Bodies receive Light in the greatest degree of perfection;  and next to them, the thicker which are not smooth, and those which are  very thin receive no Light at all. (This was first demonstrated by  _Avicenna_, never mention'd before by any of the Ancients.) From these  Premises, this Consequence will necessarily follow, _viz_. That the Sun  do's not Communicate his Heat to the Earth, after the same manner as hot  Bodies heat those other Bodies which are near them because the Sun is  not hot in it self. Nor can it be said that the Earth is heated by  Motion, because it stands still, and remains in the same posture, both  when the Sun shines upon it, and when it does not, and yet 'tis evident  to Sense, that there is a vast difference in it, in respect of Heat and  Cold, at those several times. Nor does the Sun first heat the Air, and  so the Earth; because we may observe in hot weather, that the Air which  is nearest the Earth, is hotter by much than that which is higher and  more remote. It remains therefore that the Sun has no other way of  heating the Earth but by its Light, for Heat always follows Light, so  that when its Beams are collected, as in Burning-Glasses for instance,  it fires all before it. Now 'tis Demonstrated in Mathematicks, that the  Sun is a Spherical Body, and so is the Earth; and that the Sun is much  greater than the Earth; and that part of the Earth which is at all times  illuminated by the Sun is above half of it; and that in that half which  is illuminated, the Light is most intense in the midst; both because  that part is the most remote from Darkness, which is the Circumference  of the Circle, as also, because it lies opposite to more parts of the  Sun: and that those parts which are nearest the Circumference of the  Circle, have less Light; and so gradually, till the Circumference of the  Circle, which encompasses the illuminated part of the Earth, ends in  Darkness.    Sec. 2. Now that is the Center of the Circle of Light, where the Sun is  Vertical to the Inhabitants, and then in that place, the Heat is most  extreamly intense; and so those Countries are the coldest, where the Sun  is farthest from being Vertical. And if there were any such place where  the Sun was always Vertical, it must needs be extream hot. Now 'tis  demonstrated in Astronomy, that the Sun is Vertical twice a Year only,  to those which live under the Equinoctial, _viz_. when he enters into  _Aries_ and _Libra_; and all the rest of the Year he declines from them,  six months Northward, and six months Southward; and for that reason they  are neither too hot nor too cold, but of a Moderate Temper between both.  There's much more to be said about this Argument, in order to the  explaining it fully, but it is not suitable to our purpose; I have only  hinted it to you, because it helps the Story a little, and makes it  something more probable that a Man may be form'd without the help of  Father and Mother; and there are some which affirm positively that _Hai  Ebn Yokdhan_ was so, others deny it, and tell the Story thus:           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration 3]           *       *       *       *       *    Sec. 3.

Many pious kings followed who built or repaired sacred  edifices and Buddhism evidently flourished, but we also hear of heresy. In  the third century A.D.[44] King Voharaka Tissa suppressed[45] the Vetulyas.  This sect was connected with the Abhayagiri monastery, but, though it  lasted until the twelfth century, I have found no Sinhalese account of its  tenets. It is represented as the worst of heresies, which was suppressed by  all orthodox kings but again and again revived, or was reintroduced from  India. Though it always found a footing at the Abhayagiri it was not  officially recognized as the creed of that Monastery which since the time  of Vattagamani seems to have professed the relatively orthodox doctrine  called Dhammaruci.    Mention is made in the Katha-vatthu of heretics who held that the  Buddha remained in the Tusita heaven and that the law was preached on  earth not by him but by Ananda and the commentary[46] ascribes these  views to the Vetulyakas. The reticence of the Sinhalese chronicles  makes it doubtful whether the Vetulyakas of Ceylon and these heretics  are identical but probably the monks of the Abhayagiri, if not  strictly speaking Mahayanist, were an off-shoot of an ancient sect  which contained some germs of the Mahayana. Hsuan Chuang in his  narrative[47] states (probably from hearsay) that the monks of the  Mahavihara were Hinayanists but that both vehicles were studied at the  Abhayagiri. I-Ching on the contrary says expressly that all the  Sinhalese belonged to the Aryasthavira Nikaya. Fa-Hsien describes the  Buddhism of Ceylon as he saw it about 412 A.D., but does not apply to  it the terms Hina or Mahayana. He evidently regarded the Abhayagiri as  the principal religious centre and says it had 5000 monks as against  3000 in the Mahavihara, but though he dwells on the gorgeous  ceremonial, the veneration of the sacred tooth, the representations of  Gotama's previous lives, and the images of Maitreya, he does not  allude to the worship of Avalokita and Manjusri or to anything that  can be called definitely Mahayanist. He describes a florid and  somewhat superstitious worship which may have tended to regard the  Buddha as superhuman, but the relics of Gotama's body were its chief  visible symbols and we have no ground for assuming that such teaching  as is found in the Lotus sutra was its theological basis. Yet we may  legitimately suspect that the traditions of the Abhayagiri remount to  early prototypes of that teaching.    In the second and third centuries the Court seems to have favoured the  Mahavihara and King Gothabhaya banished monks belonging to the  Vetulya sect,[48] but in spite of this a monk of the Abhayagiri named  Sanghamitta obtained his confidence and that of his son, Mahasena, who  occupied the throne from 275 to 302 A.D. The Mahavihara was destroyed  and its occupants persecuted at Sanghamitta's instigation but he was  murdered and after his death the great Monastery was rebuilt. The  triumph however was not complete for Mahasena built a new monastery  called Jetavana on ground belonging to the Mahavihara and asked the  monks to abandon this portion of their territory. They refused and  according to the Mahavamsa ultimately succeeded in proving their  rights before a court of law. But the Jetavana remained as the  headquarters of a sect known as Sagaliyas. They appear to have been  moderately orthodox, but to have had their own text of the Vinaya for  according to the Commentary[49] on the Mahavamsa they \"separated the  two Vibhangas of the Bhagava[50] from the Vinaya ... altering their  meaning and misquoting their contents.\" In the opinion of the  Mahavihara both the Abhayagiri and Jetavana were schismatical, but the  laity appear to have given their respect and offerings to all three  impartially and the Mahavamsa several times records how the same  individual honoured the three Confraternities.    With the death of Mahasena ends the first and oldest part of the  Mahavamsa, and also in native opinion the grand period of Sinhalese  history, the subsequent kings being known as the Culavamsa or minor  dynasty. A continuation[51] of the chronicle takes up the story and  tells of the doings of Mahasena's son Sirimeghavanna.[52] Judged  by the standard of the Mahavihara, he was fairly satisfactory. He  rebuilt the Lohapasada and caused a golden image of Mahinda to be made  and carried in procession. This veneration of the founder of a  local church reminds one of the respect shown to the images of  half-deified abbots in Tibet, China and Japan. But the king did not  neglect the Abhayagiri or assign it a lower position than the  Mahavihara for he gave it partial custody of the celebrated relic  known as the Buddha's tooth which was brought to Ceylon from Kalinga  in the ninth year of his reign and has ever since been considered the  palladium of the island.    2      It may not be amiss to consider here briefly what is known of the  history of the Buddha's relics and especially of this tooth. Of the  minor distinctions between Buddhism and Hinduism one of the sharpest  is this cultus. Hindu temples are often erected over natural objects  supposed to resemble the footprint or some member of a deity and  sometimes tombs receive veneration.[53] But no case appears to be  known in which either Hindus or Jains show reverence to the bones or  other fragments of a human body. It is hence remarkable that  relic-worship should be so wide-spread in Buddhism and appear so early  in its history. The earliest Buddhist monuments depict figures  worshipping at a stupa, which was probably a reliquary, and there is  no reason to distrust the traditions which carry the practice back at  least to the reign of Asoka. The principal cause for its prevalence  was no doubt that Buddhism, while creating a powerful religious  current, provided hardly any objects of worship for the faithful.[54]  It is also probable that the rudiments of relic worship existed in the  districts frequented by the Buddha. The account of his death states  that after the cremation of his body the Mallas placed his bones in  their council hall and honoured them with songs and dances. Then eight  communities or individuals demanded a portion of the relics and over  each portion a cairn was built. These proceedings are mentioned as if  they were the usual ceremonial observed on the death of a great man  and in the same Sutta[55] the Buddha himself mentions four classes  of men worthy of a cairn or dagoba.[56] We may perhaps conclude that  in the earliest ages of Buddhism it was usual in north-eastern India  to honour the bones of a distinguished man after cremation and inter  them under a monument. This is not exactly relic worship but it has in  it the root of the later tree. The Pitakas contain little about the  practice but the Milinda Panha discusses the question at length and in  one passage[57] endeavours to reconcile two sayings of the Buddha,  \"Hinder not yourselves by honouring the remains of the Tathagatha\" and  \"Honour that relic of him who is worthy of honour.\" It is the first  utterance rather than the second that seems to have the genuine ring  of Gotama.    The earliest known relics are those discovered in the stupa of Piprava  on the borders of Nepal in 1898. Their precise nature and the date of  the inscription describing them have been the subject of much  discussion. Some authorities think that this stupa may be one of those  erected over a portion of the Buddha's ashes after his funeral. Even  Barth, a most cautious and sceptical scholar, admitted[58] first that  the inscription is not later than Asoka, secondly that the vase is a  reliquary containing what were believed to be bones of the Buddha.  Thus in the time of Asoka the worship of the Buddha's relics was well  known and I see no reason why the inscription should not be anterior  to that time.    According to Buddhaghosa's _Sumangalavilasini_ and Sinhalese texts  which though late are based on early material,[59] Mahakassapa  instigated Ajatasattu to collect the relics of the Buddha, and to  place them in a stupa, there to await the advent of Asoka. In Asoka's  time the stupa had become overgrown and hidden by jungle but when the  king was in search of relics, its position was revealed to him. He  found inside it an inscription authorizing him to disperse the  contents and proceeded to distribute them among the 84,000  monasteries which he is said to have constructed.    In its main outlines this account is probable. Ajatasattu conquered  the Licchavis and other small states to the north of Magadha and if he  was convinced of the importance of the Buddha's relics it would be  natural that he should transport them to his capital, regarding them  perhaps as talismans.[60] Here they were neglected, though not  damaged, in the reigns of Brahmanical kings and were rescued from  oblivion by Asoka, who being sovereign of all India and anxious to  spread Buddhism throughout his dominions would be likely to distribute  the relics as widely as he distributed his pillars and inscriptions.  But later Buddhist kings could not emulate this imperial impartiality  and we may surmise that such a monarch as Kanishka would see to it  that all the principal relics in northern India found their way to his  capital. The bones discovered at Peshawar are doubtless those  considered most authentic in his reign.    Next to the tooth, the most interesting relic of the Buddha was his  _patra_ or alms-bowl, which plays a part somewhat similar to that of  the Holy Grail in Christian romance. The Mahavamsa states that  Asoka sent it to Ceylon, but the Chinese pilgrim Fa-Hsien[61] saw it  at Peshawar about 405 A.D. It was shown to the people daily at the  midday and evening services. The pilgrim thought it contained about  two pecks yet such were its miraculous"]]]
