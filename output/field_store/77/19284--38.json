There is one specimen in the Museum.      10. COMMON BUZZARD. _Buteo vulgaris_, Leach. French, \"Buse.\"--The  Buzzard is a tolerably regular, and by no means uncommon, autumnal  visitant, specimens occurring from some of the Islands almost every  autumn. But it is, I believe, an autumnal visitant only, as I do not  know of a single specimen taken at any other time of year, nor can I  find a record of one. I have seen examples in the flesh from both  Alderney and Herm, in both of which Islands it occurs at least as  frequently as it does in Guernsey, though still only as an autumnal  visitant.    It is included in Professor Ansted's list, but only marked as occurring  in Guernsey, and there is one specimen in the Museum.      11. ROUGHLEGGED BUZZARD. _Buteo lagopus_, Gmelin. French, \"Archibuse  pattue\" or \"Buse pattue.\"--Though its visits seem not so absolutely  confined to the autumn as the Common Buzzard, the Rough-legged Buzzard  is a much more uncommon visitant to the Channel Islands, and can only be  looked upon as a rare occasional straggler. Mr. MacCulloch informs me  that one was killed near L'Hyvreuse, which is perhaps now more commonly  known as the New Ground, in Guernsey, about Christmas, 1870, and I  found one at the bird-stuffer and carpenter's shop at Alderney, which  had been shot by his friend who shot the Greenland Falcon, but I could  get no information about the date except that it was late autumn or  winter, and about two years ago. These are the only Channel Island  specimens of which I have been able to glean any intelligence. Probably,  however, it has occurred at other times and been overlooked. As it may  have occasionally been mistaken for the more common Common Buzzard, I  may say that it is always to be distinguished from that bird by the  feathered tarsus. On the wing, perhaps, when flying overhead, the most  readily observed distinction is the dark band on the lower part of the  breast. I have, however, seen a very dark variety of the Rough-legged  Buzzard, in which nearly the whole of the plumage was a uniform dark  chocolate-brown, and consequently the dark band on the breast could not  be seen even when one had the bird in one's hand, and had it not been  for the feathered tarsus this bird might easily have been mistaken for a  very dark variety of the Common Buzzard, and when on the wing it would  have been impossible to identify it. Indeed, though it was immediately  distinguishable from the Common Buzzard by its feathered legs, there was  some little difficulty about identifying it, even when handling it as a  skin.    Professor Ansted includes the Rough-legged Buzzard in his list, but  only marks it as occurring in Guernsey. There is no specimen at present  in the Museum.      12. MARSH HARRIER. _Circus Oeruginosus_, Linnaeus. French, \"Busard  des Marais.\"--This seems to be the least common of the Harriers in the  Channel Islands, though it does occur occasionally, and perhaps more  frequently than is generally supposed.    There are two specimens in the Museum in Guernsey both in immature  plumage; in that state, in fact, in which this bird most commonly  occurs, and in which it is the Bald Buzzard of Bewick.    Miss C.B. Carey records one in the November number of the 'Zoologist'  for 1874 in the following words:--\"In the May of this year an adult male  Marsh Harrier was found in Herm. Unfortunately it got into the hands of  some person who, I believe, kept it too long before bringing it over to  be preserved, so that all that remains of it is the head.\" I had no  opportunity of examining this bird myself, not even the head, but I am  disposed to doubt its being fully adult, as it seems to me much more  probable that it was much in the same state as those in the Museum, in  which state it is much more common than in the fully adult plumage. Miss  Carey seems only to have seen the head herself, so there may easily  have been a mistake on this point.    Mr. MacCulloch writes me word that a Marsh Harrier was killed in Herm in  May, 1875. It may be just possible, however, that this is the same bird  recorded by Miss C.B. Carey, and that Mr. MacCulloch only heard of it in  the May of the following year, and noted it accordingly. This, however,  is mere supposition on my part, for which I have no reason except that  both birds were said to have been killed in Herm, and both in May.    Professor Ansted mentions the Marsh Harrier in his list, but marks it as  only found in Guernsey.      12. HEN HARRIER. _Circus cyaneus_, Linnaeus. French, \"Busard St.  Martin.\"[6]--The Hen Harrier, perhaps, occurs rather more frequently  than the Marsh Harrier, but it can only be considered a rare occasional  visitant. In June, 1876, I saw one young Hen Harrier, which had been  shot in Herm in the April of that year, about the same time as the  Iceland Falcon, and by the same keeper, who had brought it to Mr. Couch  to stuff. Another was shot in Herm on the 19th of June, 1877. This bird  is now in Mr. Maxwell's collection, where I saw it on the 27th of June.  It was first reported to me by Mr. Jago, the bird-stuffer in Guernsey.    These are the only two Channel Island specimens of the Hen Harrier  which I have been able to find. I have never shot it myself or seen it  alive. It is, however, included in Professor Ansted's list, but marked  as occurring in Guernsey only.      [13. Omitted.]      14. MONTAGU'S HARRIER. _Circus cineraceus_, Montagu. French, \"Busard  Montagu,\" \"Busard cendre.\"--Montagu's Harrier is certainly a more  frequent visitant to the Islands than either the Hen Harrier or the  Marsh Harrier. Miss C.B. Carey records one in the 'Zoologist' for 1873  as having been shot in Alderney in July of that year. She adds that it  was an adult male in full plumage, and that she saw it herself at Mr.  Couch's shop. In the 'Zoologist' for 1874 she records another Montagu's  Harrier--a young one--shot in Herm in July of that year. She adds  that--\"It was brought to Mr. Couch to skin. He found a whole Lark's egg,  and also the shell of another, in its throat. He showed me how the whole  egg was sticking in the empty shell of the broken one.\"    All the Harriers seem to have a special liking for eggs. In his notice  of the Marsh Harrier Professor Newton says, in his edition of Yarrell,'  that birds' eggs are an irresistible delicacy; and, in speaking of the  food of the present species, he says it consists chiefly of  grasshoppers, reptiles, small mammals, birds and their eggs; these last,  if their size permit, being often swallowed whole, as was the case in  the instance mentioned by Miss Carey. Mr. Howard Saunders also says he  can bear witness to the egg-eating propensities of the Harriers.    Besides the two recorded by Miss C.B. Carey, I saw one--a young bird--in  Mr. Maxwell's collection, which had been killed at Herm, and another--a  young male--at Mr. Jago's, the bird-stuffer, which had also been killed  at Herm. There were also two young birds in the bird-stuffer and  carpenter's shop at Alderney, both of which had been killed in that  Island shortly before my last visit, June, 1878.    As mistakes may occasionally arise in identifying specimens, especially  in immature plumage, it may be as well to notice a distinction between  the Hen Harrier and Montagu's Harrier, which has been pointed out by Mr.  Howard Saunders, and which holds good in all ages and in both sexes.  This distinction is, that in the Hen Harrier the outer web of the fifth  primary is notched, whereas in Montagu's Harrier it is plain, or, in  other words, the Hen Harrier has the exterior web of the primaries, up  to and including the fifth, notched, and in Montagu's Harrier this is  only the case as far as the fourth.[7] This distinction is very useful  in identifying young birds and females, which are sometimes very much  alike. In fully adult males the orange markings on the flanks and  thighs, and the greyish upper tail-coverts of Montagu's Harrier,  distinguish it immediately at a glance from the Hen Harrier, in which  those parts are white.    Montagu's Harrier is not included by Professor Ansted in his list, nor  is there a specimen in the Museum.      15. LONGEARED OWL. _Asiootus_, Linnaeus. French, \"Hibou vulgaire,\"  \"Hibou moyen due.\"--The Long-eared Owl seems only a very rare and  accidental visitant to the Channel Islands. I have never met with it  myself, but Mr. Couch records the occurrence of one in the 'Zoologist'  for 1875, p. 4296:--\"I have a Long-eared Owl, shot at St. Martin's on  the 9th of November in that year.\" This is the only occurrence I can be  sure of, except that Mr. Couch, about two years afterwards, sent me a  skin of a Guernsey-killed Long-eared Owl; but this may have been the  bird mentioned above, as he sent me no date with it.    As it is partially migratory, and its numbers in the British Islands,  especially in the Eastern Counties, are increased during the autumn by  migratory arrivals, a few may wander, especially in the autumn, to the  Channel Islands, but it can only be rarely.    Professor Ansted includes it in his list, and marks it as having been  found both in Guernsey and Sark. There is no specimen of the Long-eared  Owl at present in the Museum. If there has been one it must have got  moth-eaten, like many of the other birds there, and been destroyed.      16. SHORTEARED OWL. _Asio accipitrinus_, Pallas. French, \"Hibou  brachyote.\"--Unlike the Long-eared Owl, the Short-eared Owl is a regular  autumnal visitant to the Channel Islands, arriving about October in  considerable numbers, but remaining only for a short time, as I do not  know of any making their appearance after the end of November, and the  majority of those that have arrived seem to pass on about that time, not  remaining throughout the winter, and I hear"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14474"],[0,"The Chemical History of a Candle (#5)"],[1,"little  so, in the middle; and when you have tried the experiment once or twice,  so as to make it nicely, you will be very interested to see where the heat  is, and to find that it is where the air and the fuel come together.    This is most important for us as we proceed with our subject. Air is  absolutely necessary for combustion; and, what is more, I must have you  understand that _fresh_ air is necessary, or else we should be imperfect  in our reasoning and our experiments. Here is a jar of air. I place it  over a candle, and it burns very nicely in it at first, shewing that what  I have said about it is true; but there will soon be a change. See how the  flame is drawing upwards, presently fading, and at last going out. And  going out, why? Not because it wants air merely, for the jar is as full  now as it was before; but it wants pure, fresh air. The jar is full of  air, partly changed, partly not changed; but it does not contain  sufficient of the fresh air which is necessary for the combustion of a  candle. These are all points which we, as young chemists, have to gather  up; and if we look a little more closely into this kind of action, we  shall find certain steps of reasoning extremely interesting. For instance,  here is the oil-lamp I shewed you--an excellent lamp for our  experiments--the old Argand lamp. I now make it like a candle [obstructing  the passage of air into the centre of the flame]; there is the cotton;  there is the oil rising up it; and there is the conical flame. It burns  poorly, because there is a partial restraint of air. I have allowed no air  to get to it, save round the outside of the flame, and it does not burn  well. I cannot admit more air from the outside, because the wick is large;  but if, as Argand did so cleverly, I open a passage to the middle of the  flame, and so let air come in there, you will see how much more  beautifully it burns. If I shut the air off, look how it smokes; and why?  We have now some very interesting points to study. We have the case of the  combustion of a candle; we have the case of a candle being put out by the  want of air; and we have now the case of imperfect combustion; and this is  to us so interesting, that I want you to understand it as thoroughly as  you do the case of a candle burning in its best possible manner. I will  now make a great flame, because we need the largest possible  illustrations. Here is a larger wick [burning turpentine on a ball of  cotton]. All these things are the same as candles, after all. If we have  larger wicks, we must have a larger supply of air, or we shall have less  perfect combustion. Look now at this black substance going up into the  atmosphere; there is a regular stream of it. I have provided means to  carry off the imperfectly burned part, lest it should annoy you. Look at  the soots that fly off from the flame: see what an imperfect combustion it  is, because it cannot get enough air. What, then, is happening? Why,  certain things which are necessary to the combustion of a candle are  absent, and very bad results are accordingly produced; but we see what  happens to a candle when it is burnt in a pure and proper state of air. At  the time when I shewed you this charring by the ring of flame on the one  side of the paper, I might have also shewn you, by turning to the other  side, that the burning of a candle produces the same kind of  soot--charcoal or carbon.    But, before I shew that, let me explain to you--as it is quite necessary  for our purpose--that, though I take a candle and give you, as the general  result, its combustion in the form of a flame, we must see whether  combustion is always in this condition, or whether there are other  conditions of flame; and we shall soon discover that there are, and that  they are most important to us. I think, perhaps, the best illustration of  such a point to us, as juveniles, is to shew the result of strong  contrast. Here is a little gunpowder. You know that gunpowder burns with  flame--we may fairly call it flame. It contains carbon and other  materials, which altogether cause it to burn with a flame. And here is  some pulverised iron, or iron filings. Now, I purpose burning these two  things together. I have a little mortar in which I will mix them. (Before  I go into these experiments, let me hope that none of you, by trying to  repeat them, for fun's sake, will do any harm. These things may all be  very properly used if you take care; but without that, much mischief will  be done.) Well, then, here is a little gunpowder, which I put at the  bottom of that little wooden vessel, and mix the iron filings up with it,  my object being to make the gunpowder set fire to the filings and burn  them in the air, and thereby shew the difference between substances  burning with flame and not with flame. Here is the mixture; and when I set  fire to it, you must watch the combustion, and you will see that it is of  two kinds. You will see the gunpowder burning with a flame, and the  filings thrown up. You will see them burning too, but without the  production of flame.  They will each burn separately. [The Lecturer then  ignited the mixture.] There is the gunpowder, which burns with a flame;  and there are the filings--they burn with a different kind of combustion.  You see, then, these two great distinctions; and upon these differences  depend all the utility and all the beauty of flame which we use for the  purpose of giving out light. When we use oil, or gas, or candle, for the  purpose of illumination, their fitness all depends upon these different  kinds of combustion.    There are such curious conditions of flame, that it requires some  cleverness and nicety of discrimination to distinguish the kinds of  combustion one from another. For instance, here is a powder which is very  combustible, consisting, as you see, of separate little particles. It is  called _lycopodium_[7], and each of these particles can produce a vapour,  and produce its own flame; but, to see them burning, you would imagine it  was all one flame. I will now set fire to a quantity, and you will see the  effect. We saw a cloud of flame, apparently in one body; but that rushing  noise [referring to the sound produced by the burning] was a proof that  the combustion was not a continuous or regular one. This is the lightning  of the pantomimes, and a very good imitation. [The experiment was twice  repeated by blowing lycopodium from a glass tube through a spirit-flame.]  This is not an example of combustion like that of the filings I have been  speaking of, to which we must now return.    Suppose I take a candle, and examine that part of it which appears  brightest to our eyes. Why, there I get these black particles, which  already you have seen many times evolved from the flame, and which I am  now about to evolve in a different way. I will take this candle and clear  away the gutterage, which occurs by reason of the currents of air; and if  I now arrange a glass tube so as just to dip into this luminous part, as  in our first experiment, only higher, you see the result. In place of  having the same white vapour that you had before, you will now have a  black vapour. There it goes, as black as ink. It is certainly very  different from the white vapour; and when we put a light to it, we shall  find that it does not burn, but that it puts the light out. Well, these  particles, as I said before, are just the smoke of the candle; and this  brings to mind that old employment which Dean Swift recommended to  servants for their amusement, namely, writing on the ceiling of a room  with a candle. But what is that black substance? Why, it is the same  carbon which exists in the candle. How comes it out of the candle? It  evidently existed in the candle, or else we should not have had it here.  And now I want you to follow me in this explanation. You would hardly  think that all those substances which fly about London, in the form of  soots and blacks, are the very beauty and life of the flame, and which are  burned in it as those iron filings were burned here. Here is a piece of  wire gauze, which will not let the flame go through it; and I think you  will see, almost immediately, that when I bring it low enough to touch  that part of the flame which is otherwise so bright, that it quells and  quenches it at once, and allows a volume of smoke to rise up.    I want you now to follow me in this point,--that whenever a substance  burns, as the iron filings burnt in the flame of gunpowder, without  assuming the vaporous state (whether it becomes liquid or remains solid),  it becomes exceedingly luminous. I have here taken three or four examples  apart from the candle, on purpose to illustrate this point to you; because  what I have to say is applicable to all substances, whether they burn or  whether they do not burn,--that they are exceedingly bright if they retain  their solid state, and that it is to this presence of solid particles in  the candle-flame that it owes its brilliancy.    Here is a platinum-wire, a body which does not change by heat. If I heat  it in this flame, see how exceedingly luminous it becomes. I will make the  flame dim, for the purpose of giving a little light only, and yet you will  see that the heat which it can give to that platinum-wire, though far less  than the heat it has itself, is able to raise the platinum-wire to a far  higher state of effulgence. This flame has carbon in it; but I will take  one that has no carbon in it. There is a material, a kind of fuel--a  vapour, or gas, whichever you like to call it--in that vessel, and it has  no solid particles in it; so I take that because it is an example of flame  itself burning without any solid matter whatever; and if I now put this  solid substance in it, you see what an intense heat it has, and how  brightly it causes the solid body to glow. This is the pipe through which  we convey this particular gas, which"]]]
