When any one turns round rapidly, till he becomes dizzy, and falls upon  the ground, the spectra of the ambient objects continue to present  themselves in rotation, and he seems to behold the objects still in motion.  Now if these spectra were impressions on a passive organ, they either must  continue as they were received last, or not continue at all.    5. Place a piece of red silk about an inch in diameter on a sheet of white  paper in a strong light, as in Plate I; look steadily upon it from the  distance of about half a yard for a minute; then closing your eye-lids,  cover them with your hands and handkerchief, and a green spectrum will be  seen in your eyes resembling in form the piece of red silk. After some  seconds of time the spectrum will disappear, and in a few more seconds will  reappear; and thus alternately three or four times, if the experiment be  well made, till at length it vanishes entirely.    [Illustration: Plate III.]    6. Place a circular piece of white paper, about four inches in diameter, in  the sunshine, cover the center of this with a circular piece of black silk,  about three inches in diameter; and the center of the black silk with a  circle of pink silk, about two inches in diameter; and the center of the  pink silk with a circle of yellow silk, about one inch in diameter; and the  center of this with a circle of blue silk, about half an inch in diameter;  make a small spot with ink in the center of the blue silk, as in Plate  III.; look steadily for a minute on this central spot, and then closing  your eyes, and applying your hand at about an inch distance before them, so  as to prevent too much or too little light from passing through the  eye-lids, and you will see the most beautiful circles of colours that  imagination can conceive; which are most resembled by the colours  occasioned by pouring a drop or two of oil on a still lake in a bright day.  But these circular irises of colours are not only different from the  colours of the silks above mentioned, but are at the same time perpetually  changing as long as they exist.    From all these experiments it appears, that these spectra in the eye are  not owing to the mechanical impulse of light impressed on the retina; nor  to its chemical combination with that organ; nor to the absorption and  emission of light, as is supposed, perhaps erroneously, to take place in  calcined shells and other phosphorescent bodies, after having been exposed  to the light: for in all these cases the spectra in the eye should either  remain of the same colour, or gradually decay, when the object is  withdrawn; and neither their evanescence during the presence of their  object, as in the second experiment, nor their change from dark to  luminous, as in the third experiment, nor their rotation, as in the fourth  experiment, nor the alternate presence and evanescence of them, as in the  fifth experiment, nor the perpetual change of colours of them, as in the  last experiment, could exist.    IV. The subsequent articles shew, that these animal motions or  configurations of our organs of sense constitute our ideas.    1. If any one in the dark presses the ball of his eye, by applying his  finger to the external corner of it, a luminous appearance is observed; and  by a smart stroke on the eye great slashes of fire are perceived. (Newton's  Optics.) So that when the arteries, that are near the auditory nerve, make  stronger pulsations than usual, as in some fevers, an undulating sound is  excited in the ears. Hence it is not the presence of the light and sound,  but the motions of the organ, that are immediately necessary to constitute  the perception or idea of light and sound.    2. During the time of sleep, or in delirium, the ideas of imagination are  mistaken for the perceptions of external objects; whence it appears, that  these ideas of imagination, are no other than a reiteration of those  motions of the organs of sense, which were originally excited by the  stimulus of external objects: and in our waking hours the simple ideas,  that we call up by recollection or by imagination, as the colour of red, or  the smell of a rose, are exact resemblances of the same simple ideas from  perception; and in consequence must be a repetition of those very motions.    3. The disagreeable sensation called the tooth-edge is originally excited  by the painful jarring of the teeth in biting the edge of the glass, or  porcelain cup, in which our food was given us in our infancy, as is further  explained in the Section XVI. 10, on Instinct.--This disagreeable sensation  is afterwards excitable not only by a repetition of the sound, that was  then produced, but by imagination alone, as I have myself frequently  experienced; in this case the idea of biting a china cup, when I imagine it  very distinctly, or when I see another person bite a cup or glass, excites  an actual pain in the nerves of my teeth. So that this idea and pain seem  to be nothing more than the reiterated motions of those nerves, that were  formerly so disagreeably affected.    Other ideas that are excited by imagination or recollection in many  instances produce similar effects on the constitution, as our perceptions  had formerly produced, and are therefore undoubtedly a repetition of the  same motions. A story which the celebrated Baron Van Swieton relates of  himself is to this purpose. He was present when the putrid carcase of a  dead dog exploded with prodigious stench; and some years afterwards,  accidentally riding along the same road, he was thrown into the same  sickness and vomiting by the idea of the stench, as he had before  experienced from the perception of it.    4. Where the organ of sense is totally destroyed, the ideas which were  received by that organ seem to perish along with it, as well as the power  of perception. Of this a satisfactory instance has fallen under my  observation. A gentleman about sixty years of age had been totally deaf for  near thirty years: he appeared to be a man of good understanding, and  amused himself with reading, and by conversing either by the use of the  pen, or by signs made with his fingers, to represent letters. I observed  that he had so far forgot the pronunciation of the language, that when he  attempted to speak, none of his words had distinct articulation, though his  relations could sometimes understand his meaning. But, which is much to the  point, he assured me, that in his dreams he always imagined that people  conversed with him by signs or writing, and never that he heard any one  speak to him. From hence it appears, that with the perceptions of sounds he  has also lost the ideas of them; though the organs of speech still retain  somewhat of their usual habits of articulation.    This observation may throw some light on the medical treatment of deaf  people; as it may be learnt from their dreams whether the auditory nerve be  paralytic, or their deafness be owing to some defect of the external organ.    It rarely happens that the immediate organ of vision is perfectly  destroyed. The most frequent causes of blindness are occasioned by defects  of the external organ, as in cataracts and obfuscations of the cornea. But  I have had the opportunity of conversing with two men, who had been some  years blind; one of them had a complete gutta serena, and the other had  lost the whole substance of his eyes. They both told me that they did not  remember to have ever dreamt of visible objects, since the total loss of  their sight.    V. Another method of discovering that our ideas are animal motions of the  organs of sense, is from considering the great analogy they bear to the  motions of the larger muscles of the body. In the following articles it  will appear that they are originally excited into action by the irritation  of external objects like our muscles; are associated together like our  muscular motions; act in similar time with them; are fatigued by continued  exertion like them; and that the organs of sense are subject to  inflammation, numbness, palsy, convulsion, and the defects of old age, in  the same manner as the muscular fibres.    1. All our perceptions or ideas of external objects are universally allowed  to have been originally excited by the stimulus of those external objects;  and it will be shewn in a succeeding section, that it is probable that all  our muscular motions, as well those that are become voluntary as those of  the heart and glandular system, were originally in like manner excited by  the stimulus of something external to the organ of motion.    2. Our ideas are also associated together after their production precisely  in the same manner as our muscular motions; which will likewise be fully  explained in the succeeding section.    3. The time taken up in performing an idea is likewise much the same as  that taken up in performing a muscular motion. A musician can press the  keys of an harpsichord with his fingers in the order of a tune he has been  accustomed to play, in as little time as he can run over those notes in his  mind. So we many times in an hour cover our eye-balls with our eye-lids  without perceiving that we are in the dark; hence the perception or idea of  light is not changed for that of darkness in so small a time as the  twinkling of an eye; so that in this case the muscular"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15709"],[0,"The Christmas Angel (#5)"],[1,"has yet to be told. And  you stake your faith, your hope, your charity upon this blind human  judgment,--which is mere Chance!\"    Miss Terry opened her lips to say, \"I saw--\" but the Angel interrupted her.    \"You saw but the beginning,\" he said. \"You saw but the first page of each  history. Shall I turn over the leaves and let you read what really  happened? Shall I help you to see the whole truth instead of a part? On  this night holy Truth, which is of Heaven, comes for all men to see and to  believe. Look!\"          CHAPTER VIII    JACK AGAIN      The Christmas Angel gently waved his hand to and fro. Gradually, as Miss  Terry sat back in her chair, the library grew dark; or rather, things faded  into an indistinguishable blur. Then it seemed as if she were sitting at a  theatre gazing at a great stage. But at this theatre there was nothing  about her, nothing between her and the place where things were happening.           *       *       *       *       *    First she saw two little ragamuffins quarreling over something in the snow.  She recognized them. They were the two Jewish boys who had picked up the  Jack-in-the-box. An officer appeared, and they ran away, the bigger boy  having possession of the toy; the smaller one with fists in his eyes,  bawling with disappointment.    Miss Terry's lips curled with the cynical disgust which she had felt when  first witnessing this scene. But a sweet voice--and she knew it was the  Angel's--whispered in her ear, \"Wait and see!\"    She watched the two boys run through the streets until they came to a dark  corner. There the little fellow caught up with the other, and once more the  struggle began. It was a hard and bloody fight. But this time the victory  was with the smaller lad, who used his fists and feet like an enraged  animal, until the other howled for mercy and handed over the disputed toy.    \"Whatcher want it fer, Sam?\" he blubbered as he saw it go into the little  fellow's pocket.    \"Mind yer own business! I just want it,\" answered Sam surlily.    \"Betcher I know,\" taunted the bigger boy.    \"Betcher yer don't.\"    \"Do!\"    \"Don't!\"    Another fight seemed imminent. But wisdom prevailed with Sammy. He would  not challenge fate a third time. \"Come on, then, and see,\" he grunted.    And Ike followed. Off the two trudged, through the brilliantly lighted  streets, until they came to a part of the city where the ways were narrower  and dark.    \"Huh! Knowed you was comin' here,\" commented Ike as they turned into a  grim, dirty alley.    Little Sam growled, \"Didn't!\" apparently as a matter of habit.    \"Did!\" reasserted Ike. \"Just where I was comin' myself.\"    Sam turned to him with a grin.    \"Was yer now? By--! Ain't that funny? I thought of it right off.\"    \"Sure. Same here!\"    They both burst into a guffaw and executed an impromptu double-shuffle of  delight. They were at the door of a tenement house with steep stairs  leading into darkness. Up three flights pounded the two pairs of heavy  boots, till they reached a half-open door, whence issued the clatter of a  sewing-machine and the voices of children. Sam stood on the threshold  grinning debonairly, with hands thrust into his pockets. Ike peered over  his shoulder, also grinning.    It was a meagre room into which they gazed, a room the chief furniture of  which seemed to be babies. Two little ones sprawled on the floor. A third  tiny tot lay in a broken-down carriage beside the door. A pale, ill-looking  woman was running the machine. On the cot bed was crumpled a fragile  little fellow of about five, and a small pair of crutches lay across the  foot of the bed.    When the two boys appeared in the doorway, the woman stopped her machine  and the children set up a howl of pleasure. \"Sammy! Ikey!\" cried the woman,  smiling a wan welcome, as the babies crept and toddled toward the  newcomers. \"Where ye come from?\"    \"Been to see the shops and the lights in the swell houses,\" answered Sammy  with a grimace. \"Gee! Ain't they wastin' candles to beat the cars!\"    \"Enough to last a family a whole year,\" muttered Ike with disgust.    The woman sighed. \"Maybe they ain't wasted exactly,\" she said. \"How I'd  like to see 'em! But I got to finish this job. I told the chil'ren they  mustn't expect anything this Christmas. But they are too little to know the  difference anyway; all but Joe. I wish I had something for Joe.\"    \"I got something for Joe,\" said Sammy unexpectedly.    The face of the pale little cripple lighted.    \"What is it?\" he asked eagerly. \"Oh, what is it? A real Christmas present  for me?\"    \"Naw! It ain't a Christmas present,\" said Sam.    \"We don't care anything about Christmas,\" volunteered Ikey with a grin.    Sam looked at him with a frown of rebuke.    \"It's just a _present_,\" he said. \"And it didn't cost a cent. I didn't buy  it. I--we found it!\"    \"Found it in the street?\" Joe's eyes shone.    \"Yah!\" the boys nodded.    \"Oh, it _is_ a Christmas present!\" cried Joe. \"Santa Claus must have  dropped it there for me, because he knew we hadn't any chimney in this  house, and he sent you kind, kind boys to bring it to me.\"    The two urchins looked sideways at each other, but said nothing. Presently  Sam drew out the box from his pocket and tried to thrust it into Ike's  hand. \"You give it to 'um,\" he said. \"You're the biggest.\"    \"Naw! You give it. You found it,\" protested Ike.    \"Ah, g'wan!\"    \"Big fool!\"    There was a tussle, and it almost seemed as if the past unpleasantness was  to be repeated from an opposite cause. But Joe's voice settled the dispute.    \"Oh, Sammy, please!\" he cried. \"I can't wait another minute. Do please give  it to me now!\"    At these words Sam stepped forward without further argument and laid the  box on the bed in front of the little cripple. The babies crowded about.  The mother left her machine and stood smiling faintly at the foot of the  bed.    Joe pressed the spring. _Ping!_ Out sprang the Jack-in-the-box, with the  same red nose, the same leer, the same roguish eyes which had surprised the  children of fifty years ago.    [Illustration: _PING!_ OUT SPRANG THE JACK-IN-THE-BOX]    Jack was always sure of his audience. My! How they screamed and begged Joe  to \"do it again.\" And as for Joe, he lay back on his pillow and laughed and  laughed as though he would never stop. It was the first Jack any of them  had seen.    Tears stood in the mother's eyes. \"Well,\" she said, \"it's as good as a play  to see him. Joe hasn't laughed like that for months. You boys have done him  lots of good. I wouldn't wonder if it helped him get well! If you was  Christians I'd say you showed the real Christmas spirit. But Lord--perhaps  ye do, all the same! I dunno!\"    Sam and Ike were so busy playing with the children that they did not hear.           *       *       *       *       *    Gradually the tenement house faded and became a blur before Miss Terry's  eyes. Once more she saw the mantel-shelf before her and the Christmas Angel  with outstretched arms waving to and fro. \"You see!\" he said. \"You did not  guess all the pleasure that was shut up in that box with old Jack, did  you?\"    Miss Terry shook her head.    \"And you see how different it all was from what you thought. Now let us see  what became of the Canton-flannel dog.\"    \"The Flanton Dog.\" Miss Terry amended the phrase under her breath. It  seemed so natural to use Tom's word.    \"Yes, the Flanton Dog,\" the Angel smiled. \"What do you think became of  him?\"    \"I saw what became of him,\" said Miss Terry. \"Bob Cooper threw him under an  automobile, and he was crushed flatter than a pancake.\"    \"Then you left the window,\" said the Angel. \"In your human way you assumed  that this was the end. But wait and see.\"    Once more the room darkened and blurred, and Miss Terry looked out upon  past events as upon a busy, ever-shifting stage.          CHAPTER IX    THE DOG AGAIN      She saw the snowy street, into which, from the tip of his stick, Bob Cooper  had just tossed the Flanton Dog. She saw, what she had not seen before, the  woman and child on the opposite side of the street. She saw the baby  stretch out wistful hands after the dog lying in the snow. Then an  automobile honked past, and she felt again the thrill of horror as it ran  over the poor old toy. At the same moment the child screamed, and she saw  it point tearfully at the Flanton tragedy. The mother, who had seen nothing  of all this, stooped and spoke to him reprovingly.    \"What's the matter, Johnnie?\" she said. \"Sh! Don't make such a noise. Here  we are at Mrs. Wales's gate, and you mustn't make a fuss. Now be a good boy  and wait here till Mother comes out.\"    She rang the area bell and stood basket in hand, waiting to be admitted.  But Johnnie gazed at one spot in the street, with eyes full of tears, and  with now and then a sob gurgling from his throat. He could not forget what  he had seen.    The door opened for the mother, who disappeared inside the house, with one  last command to the child: \"Now be a good boy, Johnnie. I'll be back in  half a minute.\"    Hardly was she out of sight when Johnnie started through the snowdrift  toward the middle of the street. With difficulty he lifted his little legs  out of the deep snow; now and then he stumbled and fell into the soft mass.  But he rose only the more determined upon his errand, and kept his eyes  fixed on the wreck of the Flanton Dog.    Bob Cooper, who was idly strolling up and down the block, smoking a  cigarette, as he watched the flitting girlish shadows in a certain window  opposite, saw the child's frantic struggles in the snow and was intensely  amused. \"Bah Jove!\" he chuckled. \"I believe he's after the wretched dawg  that I tossed over there with my stick. Fahncy it!\" And carelessly he  puffed a whiff of smoke.    At last the baby reached the middle of the street and stooped to pick up  the battered toy. It was flattened and shapeless, but the child clasped it  tenderly"]]]
