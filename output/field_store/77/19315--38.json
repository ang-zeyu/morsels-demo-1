The double reed was inclosed in a _pirouette_, or cup,  and the keys of the tenor or bass, just the same as with similar  flutes and bombards, were hidden by a barrel-shaped cover, pierced  with small openings, apparently intended to modify the too searching  tone as well as to protect the touch pieces which moved the keys. The  compass was limited to fundamental notes, and from the cylindrical  tube and reed was an octave lower in pitch than the length would show.  In all these instruments provision was made in the holes and keys for  transposition of the hands according to the player's habit of placing  the right or left hand above the other. The unused hole was stopped  with wax. There is a fine and complete set of four cromornes in the  museum of the Conservatoire at Brussels.    We must also place among double-reed instruments the various bagpipes,  cornemuses, and musettes, which are shawm or oboe instruments with  reservoirs of air, and furnished with drones inclosing single reeds. I  shall have more to say about the drone in the third lecture. In  restricting our attention to the Highland bagpipe, with which we are  more or less familiar, it is surprising to find the peculiar scale of  the chaunter, or finger pipe, in an old Arabic scale, still prevailing  in Syria and Egypt. Dr. A.J. Ellis' lecture on \"The Musical Scales of  Various Nations,\" read before the Society of Arts, and printed in the  _Journal_ of the Society, March 27, 1885, No. 1688, vol. xxxiii., and  in an appendix, October 30, 1885, in the same volume, should be  consulted by any one who wishes to know more about this curious  similarity.    We have now arrived at the clarinet. Although embodying a very ancient  principle--the \"squeaker\" reed which our little children still make,  and continued in the Egyptian arghool--the clarinet is the most recent  member of the wood wind band. The reed initiating the tone by the  player's breath is a broad, single, striking or beating reed, so  called because the vibrating tongue touches the edges of the body of  the cutting or framing. A cylindrical pipe, as that of the clarinet,  drops, approximately, an octave in pitch when the column of air it  contains is set up in vibration by such a reed, because the reed  virtually closes the pipe at the end where it is inserted, and like a  stopped organ pipe sets up a node of maximum condensation or  rarefaction at that end. This peculiarity interferes with the  resonance of the even-numbered partials of the harmonic scale, and  permits only the odd-numbered partials, 1, 3, 5, and so on, to sound.  The first harmonic, as we find in the clarinet, is therefore the third  partial, or twelfth of the fundamental note, and not the octave, as in  the oboe and flute.    In the oboe the shifting of the nodes in a conical tube open at its  base, and narrowing to its apex, permits the resonance of the complete  series of the harmonic scale, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and upward. The flute has  likewise the complete series, because through the blowhole it is a  pipe open at both ends. But while stating the law which governs the  pitch and harmonic scale of the clarinet, affirmed equally by  observation and demonstration, we are left at present with only the  former when regarding two very slender, almost cylindrical reed pipes,  discovered in 1889 by Mr. Flinders Petrie while excavating at Fayoum  the tomb of an Egyptian lady named Maket. Mr. Petrie dates these pipes  about 1100 B.C., and they were the principal subject of Mr.  Southgate's recent lectures upon the Egyptian scale.    Now Mr. J. Finn, who made these ancient pipes sound at these lectures  with an arghool reed of straw, was able upon the pipe which had, by  finger holes, a tetrachord, to repeat that tetrachord a fifth higher  by increased pressure of blowing, and thus form an octave scale,  comprising eight notes. \"Against the laws of nature,\" says a friend of  mine, for the pipe having dropped more than an octave through the  reed, was at its fundamental pitch, and should have overblown a  twelfth.    But Mr. Finn allows me to say with reference to those reeds, perhaps  the oldest sounding musical instruments known to exist, that his  experiments with straw reeds seem to indicate low, medium, and high  octave registers. The first and last difficult to obtain with reeds as  made by us. He seeks the fundamental tones of the Maket pipes in the  first or low register, an octave below the normal pitch. By this the  fifths revert to twelfths. I offer no opinion, but will leave this  curious phenomenon to the consideration of my friends, Mr. Blaikley,  Mr. Victor Mahillon, and Mr. Hermann Smith, acousticians intimate with  wind instruments.    The clarinet was invented about A.D. 1700, by Christopher Denner, of  Nuremberg. By his invention, an older and smaller instrument, the  chalumeau, of eleven notes, without producible harmonics, was, by an  artifice of raising a key to give access to the air column at a  certain point, endowed with a harmonic series of eleven notes a  twelfth higher. The chalumeau being a cylindrical pipe, the upper  partials could only be in an odd series, and when Denner made them  speak, they were consequently not an octave, but a twelfth above the  fundamental notes. Thus, an instrument which ranged, with the help of  eight finger holes and two keys, from F in the bass clef to B flat in  the treble had an addition given to it at once of a second register  from C in the treble clef to E flat above it. The scale of the  original instrument is still called chalumeau by the clarinet player;  about the middle of the last century it was extended down to E. The  second register of notes, which by this lengthening of pipe started  from B natural, received the name of clarinet, or clarionet, from the  clarino or clarion, the high solo trumpet of the time it was expected  that this bright harmonic series would replace.    This name of clarinet, or clarionet, became accepted for the entire  instrument, including the chalumeau register. It is the communication  between the external air and the upper part of the air column in the  instrument which, initiating a ventral segment or loop of vibration,  forces the air column to divide for the next possible partial, the  twelfth, that Denner has the merit of having made practicable. At the  same time the manipulation of it presents a difficulty in learning the  instrument. It is in the nature of things that there should be a  difference of tone quality between the lower and upper registers thus  obtained; and that the highest fundamental notes, G sharp, A and B  flat, should be colorless compared with the first notes of the  overblown series. This is a difficulty the player has to contend with,  as well as the complexity of fingering, due to there being no less  than eighteen sound holes. Much has been done to graft Boehm's system  of fingering upon the clarinet, but the thirteen key system, invented  early in this century by Iwan Muller, is still most employed. The  increased complication of mechanism is against a change, and there is  even a stronger reason, which I cannot do better than translate, in  the appropriate words of M. Lavoix fils, the author of a well-known  and admirable work upon instrumentation:        \"Many things have still to be done, but inventors must not lose      the point in view, that no tone quality is more necessary to the      composer than that of the clarinet in its full extent; that it      is very necessary especially to avoid melting together the two      registers of chalumeau and clarinet, so distinct from each      other. If absolute justness for these instruments is to be      acquired at the price of those inestimable qualities, it would      be better a hundred times to leave it to virtuosi, thanks to      their ability, to palliate the defects of their instrument,      rather than sacrifice one of the most beautiful and intensely      colored voices of our orchestra.\"    There are several clarinets of various pitches, and formerly more than  are used now, owing to the difficulty of playing except in handy keys.  In the modern orchestra the A and B flat clarinets are the most used;  in the military band, B flat and E flat. The C clarinet is not much  used now. All differ in tone and quality; the A one is softer than the  B flat; the C is shrill. The B flat is the virtuoso instrument. In  military bands the clarinet takes the place which would be that of the  violin in the orchestra, but the tone of it is always characteristically  different. Although introduced in the time of Handel and Bach those  composers made no use of it. With Mozart it first became a leading  orchestral instrument.    The Basset horn, which has become the sensuously beautiful alto  clarinet in E flat, is related to the clarinet in the same way that  the cor Anglais is to the oboe. Basset is equivalent to Baryton (there  is a Basset flute figured in Praetorius), and this instrument appears  to have been invented by one Horn, living at Passau, in Bavaria, about  1770. His name given to the instrument has been mistranslated into  Italian as Corno di Bassetto. There is a bass clarinet employed with  effect by Meyerbeer in the \"Huguenots,\" but the characteristic  clarinet tone is less noticeable; it is, however, largely used in  military bands. The Basset horn had the deep compass of the bass  clarinet which separates it from the present alto clarinet, although  it was more like the alto in caliber. The alto clarinet is also used  in military bands; and probably what the Basset horn would have been  written for is divided between the present bass and alto clarinets.    Preceding the invention of the sarrusophone, by which a perfected oboe  was contrived in a brass instrument, a modified brass instrument, the  saxophone, bearing a similar relation to the clarinet, was invented in  1846 by Sax, whose name will occur again and again in connection"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14992"],[0,"The Life of Froude (#5)"],[1,"the wrongs of Ireland did not appeal to him.  That Protestantism was the religion of the English pale, and of the  Scottish Presbyterians in Ulster, not of the Irish people, was a  fact outside his thoughts. He saw two things clearly enough. One was  the strength and beauty of the religious faith by which the Cleavers  and their friends lived. The other was the misery, squalor, and  chronic discontent of the Catholic population, then almost twice as  large as after the famine it became. He did not pause to reflect  upon what had been done by laws made in England, or upon the  iniquity of taxing Ireland in tithes for the Church of a small  minority. He concluded simply that Protestantism meant progress, and  Catholicism involved stagnation. He heard dark stories of Ribbonism,  and was gravely assured that if Mr. Cleaver's Catholic coachman,  otherwise an excellent servant, were ordered to shoot his master, he  would obey. Very likely Mr. Cleaver was right, though the event did  not occur. What was the true origin of Ribbonism, what made it  dangerous, why it had the sympathy of the people, were questions  which Froude could hardly be expected to answer, inasmuch as they  were not answered by Sir Robert Peel.    While Froude was at Delgany there appeared the once famous Tract  Ninety, last of the series, unless we are to reckon Monckton  Milnes's One Tract More. The author of Tract Ninety was Newman, and  the ferment it made was prodigious. It was a subtle, ingenious, and  plausible attempt to prove that the Articles and other formularies  of the English Church might be honestly interpreted in a Catholic  sense, as embodying principles which the whole Catholic Church held  before the Reformation, and held still. Mr. Cleaver and his circle  were profoundly shocked. To them Catholicism meant Roman  Catholicism, or, as they called it, Popery. If a man were not a  Protestant, he had no business to remain in the United Church of  England and Ireland. If he did remain in it, he was not merely  mistaken, but dishonest, and sophistry could not purge him from the  moral stain of treachery to the institution of which he was an  officer. Froude's sense of chivalry was aroused, and he warmly  defended Newman, whom he knew to be as honest as himself, besides  being saintly and pure. If he had stopped there, all might have been  well. Mr. Cleaver was himself high-minded, and could appreciate the  virtue of standing up for an absent friend. But Froude went further.  He believed Newman to be legally and historically right. The Church  of England was designed to be comprehensive. Chatham had spoken of  it, not unfairly, as having an Arminian liturgy and Calvinist  articles. When the Book of Common Prayer assumed its present shape,  every citizen had been required to conform, and the policy of  Elizabeth was to exclude no one. The result was a compromise, and  Mr. Cleaver would have found it hard to reconcile his principles  with the form of absolution in the Visitation of the Sick. This was,  in Mr. Cleaver's opinion, sophistry almost as bad as Newman's, and  Froude's tutorship came to an end. There was no quarrel, and, after  a tour through the south of Ireland, where he saw superstition and  irreverence, solid churches, well-fed priests, and a starving  peasantry in rags, Froude returned for a farewell visit to Delgany.  On this occasion he met Dr. Pusey, who had been at Christ Church  with Mr. Cleaver, and was then visiting Bray. Dr. Pusey, however,  was not at his ease He was told by a clerical guest, afterwards a  Bishop, with more freedom than courtesy, that they wanted no Popery  brought to Ireland, they had enough of their own. The sequel is  curious. For while Newman justified Mr. Cleaver by going over to  Rome, his own sons, including Froude's pupil, became Puseyite  clergymen of the highest possible type. Froude returned to Oxford at  the beginning of 1842, and won the Chancellor's Prize for an English  essay on the influence of political economy in the development of  nations. In the summer he was elected to a Devonshire Fellowship at  Exeter, and his future seemed secure. But his mind was not at rest.  It was an age of ecclesiastical controversy, and Oxford was the  centre of what now seems a storm in a teacup. Froude became mixed up  in it. On the one hand was the personal influence of Newman, who  raised more doubts than he solved. On the other hand Froude's  experience of Evangelical Protestantism in Ireland, where he read  for the first time The Pilgrim's Progress, contradicted the  assumption of the Tractarians that High Catholicity was an essential  note of true religion. Gradually the young Fellow became aware that  High Church and Low Church did not exhaust the intellectual world.  He read Carlyle's French revolution, and Hero Worship, and Past and  Present. He read Emerson too. For Emerson and Carlyle the Church of  England did not exist. Carlyle despised it.    Emerson had probably not so much as given it a thought in his life.  But what struck Froude most about them was that they dealt with  actual phaenomena, with things and persons around them, with the  world as it was. They did not appeal to tradition, or to antiquity,  but to nature, and to the mind of man. The French Revolution, then  but half a century old, was interpreted by Carlyle not as  Antichrist, but as God's judgment upon sin.    Perhaps one view was not more historical than the other. But the first  was groundless, and second had at least some evidence in support of it.  God may be, or rather must be, conceived to work through other instruments  besides Christianity. \"Neither in Jerusalem, nor on this mountain,  shall men worship the Father.\" Carlyle completed what Newman had  begun, and the dogmatic foundation of Froude's belief gave way. The  two greatest geniuses of the age, as he thought them, agreeing in  little else, agreed that Christianity did not rest upon reason. Then upon  what did it rest? Reason appeals to one. Faith is the appanage of a  few. From Carlyle Froude went to Goethe, then almost unknown at  Oxford, a true philosopher as well as a great poet, an example of  dignity, a liberator of the human soul.    The Church as a profession is not suitable to a man in Froude's  state of mind. But in Oxford at that time there flourished a lamentable  system which would have been felt to be irreligious if the  authorities of the place had known what religion really was. Most  Fellows lost their Fellowships in a very short time unless they took  orders, and Froude's Fellowship was in that sense a clerical one.  They were ordained as a matter of course, the Bishop requiring no  other title. They were not expected, unless they wished it, to take  any parochial duty, and the notion that they had a \"serious call\" to  keep their Fellowships can only be described as absurd. Froude had  no other profession in view, and he persuaded himself that a Church  established by law must allow a wider range of opinion than a  voluntary communion could afford to tolerate. As we have seen, he  had defended Tract Ninety, and he claimed for himself the latitude  which he conceded to Newman. It was in his case a mistake, as he  very soon discovered. But the system which encouraged it must bear a  large part of the blame. Meanwhile he had been employed by Newman on  an uncongenial task. After the discontinuance of Tracts for the  Times, Newman projected another series, called Lives of the Saints.  The idea was of course taken from the Bollandist Acta Sanctorum. But  Newman had a definite polemical purpose. Just as he felt the force  of Hume's argument against the probability of miracles, so he  realised the difficulty of answering Gibbon's inquiry when miracles  ceased. Had they ever ceased at all? Many Roman Catholics, if not  the most enlightened and instructed, thought not. Newman conceived  that the lives of English and Irish saints held much matter for  edification, including marvels and portents of various kinds. He  desired that these things should be believed, as he doubtless  believed them. They proved, he thought, if they could be proved  themselves, that supernatural power resided in the Church, and when  the Church was concerned he laid his reason aside.    He was extraordinarily sanguine. \"Rationalise,\" he said to Froude,  \"when the evidence is weak, and this will give credibility for  others, when you can show that the evidence is strong.\" Froude chose  St. Neot, a contemporary of Alfred, in whose life the supernatural  played a comparatively small part. He told his story as legend, not  quite as Newman wanted it. \"This is all,\" he said at the end, \"and  perhaps rather more than all, that is known of the life of the  blessed St. Neot.\" His connection with the series ceased. But his  curiosity was excited. He read far and wide in the Benedictine  biographies. No trace of investigation into facts could he discover.  If a tale was edifying, it was believed, and credibility had nothing  to do with it. The saints were beatified conjurers, and any nonsense  about them was swallowed, if it involved the miraculous element. The  effect upon Froude may be left to his own words. \"St. Patrick I  found once lighted a fire with icicles, changed a French marauder  into a wolf, and floated to Ireland on an altar stone. I thought it  nonsense. I found it eventually uncertain whether Patricius was not  a title, and whether any single apostle of that name had so much as  existed.\"    Froude's scepticism was too indiscriminate when it assailed the  existence of St. Patrick, which is not now doubted by scholars,  baseless as the Patrician legends may be. Colgan's Lives of Irish  Saints had taken him back to Ireland, that he might examine the  scenes described. He visited them under the best guidance; and  Petre, the learned historian of the Round Towers, showed him a host  of curious antiquities, including a utensil which had come to be  called the Crown of"]]]
