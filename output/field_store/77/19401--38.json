Such forces are not soon or easily exhausted, and justice is not  satisfied till all have reaped what they sowed.\"    Jones had an odd feeling that he was slipping away into some other state  of consciousness. Thorpe began to seem unreal. Presently he would be  unable to ask more questions. He felt utterly sick and faint with it  all, and his strength was ebbing.    \"Oh, quick!\" he cried, \"now tell me more. Why did I see this? What must  I do?\"    The wind swept across the field on their right and entered the wood  beyond with a great roar, and the air round him seemed filled with  voices and the rushing of hurried movement.    \"To the ends of justice,\" answered the other, as though speaking out  of the centre of the wind and from a distance, \"which sometimes is  entrusted to the hands of those who suffered and were strong. One wrong  cannot be put right by another wrong, but your life has been so worthy  that the opportunity is given to--\"    The voice grew fainter and fainter, already it was far overhead with the  rushing wind.    \"You may punish or--\" Here Jones lost sight of Thorpe's figure  altogether, for he seemed to have vanished and melted away into the  wood behind him. His voice sounded far across the trees, very weak, and  ever rising.    \"Or if you can rise to the level of a great forgiveness--\"    The voice became inaudible.... The wind came crying out of the wood  again.           *       *       *       *       *    Jones shivered and stared about him. He shook himself violently and  rubbed his eyes. The room was dark, the fire was out; he felt cold and  stiff. He got up out of his armchair, still trembling, and lit the gas.  Outside the wind was howling, and when he looked at his watch he saw  that it was very late and he must go to bed.    He had not even changed his office coat; he must have fallen asleep in  the chair as soon as he came in, and he had slept for several hours.  Certainly he had eaten no dinner, for he felt ravenous.          III      Next day, and for several weeks thereafter, the business of the office  went on as usual, and Jones did his work well and behaved outwardly with  perfect propriety. No more visions troubled him, and his relations with  the Manager became, if anything, somewhat smoother and easier.    True, the man _looked_ a little different, because the clerk kept seeing  him with his inner and outer eye promiscuously, so that one moment he  was broad and red-faced, and the next he was tall, thin, and dark,  enveloped, as it were, in a sort of black atmosphere tinged with red.  While at times a confusion of the two sights took place, and Jones saw  the two faces mingled in a composite countenance that was very horrible  indeed to contemplate. But, beyond this occasional change in the outward  appearance of the Manager, there was nothing that the secretary noticed  as the result of his vision, and business went on more or less as  before, and perhaps even with a little less friction.    But in the rooms under the roof in Bloomsbury it was different, for  there it was perfectly clear to Jones that Thorpe had come to take up  his abode with him. He never saw him, but he knew all the time he was  there. Every night on returning from his work he was greeted by the  well-known whisper, \"Be ready when I give the sign!\" and often in the  night he woke up suddenly out of deep sleep and was aware that Thorpe  had that minute moved away from his bed and was standing waiting and  watching somewhere in the darkness of the room. Often he followed him  down the stairs, though the dim gas jet on the landings never revealed  his outline; and sometimes he did not come into the room at all, but  hovered outside the window, peering through the dirty panes, or sending  his whisper into the chamber in the whistling of the wind.    For Thorpe had come to stay, and Jones knew that he would not get rid of  him until he had fulfilled the ends of justice and accomplished the  purpose for which he was waiting.    Meanwhile, as the days passed, he went through a tremendous struggle  with himself, and came to the perfectly honest decision that the \"level  of a great forgiveness\" was impossible for him, and that he must  therefore accept the alternative and use the secret knowledge placed  in his hands--and execute justice. And once this decision was arrived  at, he noticed that Thorpe no longer left him alone during the day as  before, but now accompanied him to the office and stayed more or less at  his side all through business hours as well. His whisper made itself  heard in the streets and in the train, and even in the Manager's room  where he worked; sometimes warning, sometimes urging, but never for a  moment suggesting the abandonment of the main purpose, and more than  once so plainly audible that the clerk felt certain others must have  heard it as well as himself.    The obsession was complete. He felt he was always under Thorpe's eye day  and night, and he knew he must acquit himself like a man when the moment  came, or prove a failure in his own sight as well in the sight of the  other.    And now that his mind was made up, nothing could prevent the carrying  out of the sentence. He bought a pistol, and spent his Saturday  afternoons practising at a target in lonely places along the Essex  shore, marking out in the sand the exact measurements of the Manager's  room. Sundays he occupied in like fashion, putting up at an inn  overnight for the purpose, spending the money that usually went into the  savings bank on travelling expenses and cartridges. Everything was done  very thoroughly, for there must be no possibility of failure; and at the  end of several weeks he had become so expert with his six-shooter that  at a distance of 25 feet, which was the greatest length of the Manager's  room, he could pick the inside out of a halfpenny nine times out of a  dozen, and leave a clean, unbroken rim.    There was not the slightest desire to delay. He had thought the matter  over from every point of view his mind could reach, and his purpose was  inflexible. Indeed, he felt proud to think that he had been chosen as  the instrument of justice in the infliction of so well-deserved and so  terrible a punishment. Vengeance may have had some part in his decision,  but he could not help that, for he still felt at times the hot chains  burning his wrists and ankles with fierce agony through to the bone.  He remembered the hideous pain of his slowly roasting back, and the  point when he thought death _must_ intervene to end his suffering, but  instead new powers of endurance had surged up in him, and awful further  stretches of pain had opened up, and unconsciousness seemed farther off  than ever. Then at last the hot irons in his eyes.... It all came back  to him, and caused him to break out in icy perspiration at the mere  thought of it ... the vile face at the panel ... the expression of the  dark face.... His fingers worked. His blood boiled. It was utterly  impossible to keep the idea of vengeance altogether out of his mind.    Several times he was temporarily baulked of his prey. Odd things  happened to stop him when he was on the point of action. The first day,  for instance, the Manager fainted from the heat. Another time when he  had decided to do the deed, the Manager did not come down to the office  at all. And a third time, when his hand was actually in his hip pocket,  he suddenly heard Thorpe's horrid whisper telling him to wait, and  turning, he saw that the head cashier had entered the room noiselessly  without his noticing it. Thorpe evidently knew what he was about, and  did not intend to let the clerk bungle the matter.    He fancied, moreover, that the head cashier was watching him. He was  always meeting him in unexpected corners and places, and the cashier  never seemed to have an adequate excuse for being there. His movements  seemed suddenly of particular interest to others in the office as well,  for clerks were always being sent to ask him unnecessary questions,  and there was apparently a general design to keep him under a sort of  surveillance, so that he was never much alone with the Manager in the  private room where they worked. And once the cashier had even gone so  far as to suggest that he could take his holiday earlier than usual if  he liked, as the work had been very arduous of late and the heat  exceedingly trying.    He noticed, too, that he was sometimes followed by a certain individual  in the streets, a careless-looking sort of man, who never came face to  face with him, or actually ran into him, but who was always in his train  or omnibus, and whose eye he often caught observing him over the top of  his newspaper, and who on one occasion was even waiting at the door of  his lodgings when he came out to dine.    There were other indications too, of various sorts, that led him to  think something was at work to defeat his purpose, and that he must act  at once before these hostile forces could prevent.    And so the end came very swiftly, and was thoroughly approved by Thorpe.    It was towards the close of July, and one of the hottest days London had  ever known, for the City was like an oven, and the particles of dust  seemed to burn the throats of the unfortunate toilers in street and  office.

Where were Carpets originally made?    Carpets are of oriental origin, and are made of different sorts of  stuffs; they are woven in a variety of ways. Persian and Turkey  carpets are most esteemed; they are woven in a piece, in looms of a  very simple construction. Formerly the manufacture of these carpets  was confined to Persia and Turkey; but they are now successfully made,  both in Europe and the United States, &c. Great Britain is the  principal seat of the carpet manufacture of the world. Brussels,  Wilton, and Kidderminster carpets derive their names from the places  where they were invented.      Is not the art of weaving very ancient?    It appears to have been known from a period as early as the time of  Abraham and Jacob; its inventor is not known, but it is possible that  men took a lesson from the ingenious spider, which weaves its web  after the same manner. The ancient Egyptians appear to have brought it  to great perfection, and were even acquainted with the art of  interweaving colors after the manner of the Scottish plaid.      What is Baize?    A coarse, open, woollen stuff, with a long nap. It is chiefly made in  the United States, England, France, &c.      What is Linen?    There are various kinds of linen, made from cotton, flax, and hemp;  but the term is chiefly applied to that woven with the two last  mentioned. Linen means cloth of flax; hence its derivation from the  Latin word _linum_, flax.      What is Flax?    An annual plant, the fibres of which are beaten into threads, spun,  and afterwards woven into linen; it is extensively cultivated in the  United States, Russia, and some other countries of Europe. Hemp is a  plant of a similar nature, equally used with flax, in the manufacture  of linens. Russian hemp is cultivated to a larger extent than that of  any other country, and is considered the best that is grown.      How long has the use of Hemp and Flax been known?    Those plants are said to be natives of Persia, and introduced from  some parts of the East into Europe, over which it is now widely  distributed: it existed both in a wild and cultivated state, in some  parts of Russia, as early as five centuries before Christ These  products form a considerable article of exportation, besides the  quantity used in Russia itself; a considerable part is wrought into  linens, diapers, canvas, and other manufactures; and even the seeds  are exported, both in their natural state and as oil. In various parts  of Russia, hemp-seed oil and flax-seed (or linseed) oil are prepared  in very large quantities.      What is Diaper?    A sort of linen cloth, woven in flowers, and other figures; it is said  to have received its name from d'Iper, now Ypres, a town of Belgium,  situated on a river of the same name, where it was first made.      What is Holland?    A fine, close, even, linen cloth, used for sheets, &c. It obtained its  name from being principally made in Holland.      What is Canvas?    A hempen cloth, so loosely woven as to leave interstices between the  threads, in little squares. It is used for working in patterns upon it  with wools, &c.; by painters for a ground work on which they draw  their pictures; for tents, sails, and many other purposes. There are  several sorts, varying in the fineness of their texture.      What is Damask?    A sort of silken stuff, having some parts raised on its surface to  represent flowers or figures. It took its name from Damascus, in  Syria, whence it was first brought.      Is there not another sort of Damask?    Yes, made from linen; and so called because its large flowers resemble  those of damask roses. It was first made in Flanders, and is used for  table linen, &c.      What is Flannel?    A slight, loose, woollen stuff, used for warm clothing; it was  originally made in Wales, where it still continues to be manufactured  in great perfection.          CHAPTER IV.    COCOA, TODDY, CHERRIES, BARK, CORK, COCHINEAL, CLOVES, CINNAMON,  AND CASSIA.      Of what form is the tree which bears those large nuts, called Cocoa  nuts?    It is tall and straight, without branches, and generally about thirty  or forty feet high; at the top are twelve leaves, ten feet long, and  half a foot broad; above the leaves, grows a large excrescence in the  form of a cabbage, excellent to eat, but taking it off kills the tree.  The cocoa is a species of Palm.      Is not the Indian liquor called Toddy, produced from the Cocoa Tree?    Yes, between the leaves and the top arise several shoots about the  thickness of a man's arm, which, when cut, distil a white, sweet,  and agreeable liquor; while this liquor exudes, the tree yields no  fruit; but when the shoots are allowed to grow, it puts out a large  cluster or branch, on which the cocoa nuts hang, to the number of ten  or twelve.         _Distil_, to let fall in drops.         _Exude_, to force or throw out.    [Illustration: THE CATHEDRAL OF MILAN, ITALY.]      How often does this tree produce nuts?    Three times a year, the nuts being about the size of a man's head, and  of an oval form.      Of what countries is it a native?    Of Asia, the Indies, Africa, Arabia, the Islands of the Southern  Pacific, and the hottest parts of America.      What are the uses of this Tree?    The leaves of the tree are made into baskets; they are also used for  thatching houses: the fibrous bark of the nut, and the trunk of the  tree, are made into cordage, sails, and cloth; the shell, into  drinking bowls and cups; the kernel affords a wholesome food, and the  milk contained in the shell, a cooling liquor.      From what country was the Cherry Tree first brought?    From Cerasus, a city of Pontus, in Asia, on the southern borders of  the Black Sea; from which place this tree was brought to Rome, in the  year of that city 680, by Lucullus; it was conveyed, a hundred and  twenty-eight years after, into Great Britain, A.D. 55.      What is the meaning of A.D.?    A short way of writing Anno Domini, Latin words for _in the year of  our Lord_.      Who was Lucullus?    A renowned Roman general.      Is the wood of the Cherry Tree useful?    It is used in cabinet-making, for boxes, and other articles.      What is Bark?    The exterior part of trees, which serves them as a skin or covering.         _Exterior_, the outside.      Does it not undergo some change during the year?    Each year the bark of a tree divides, and distributes itself two  contrary ways, the outer part gives towards the skin, till it becomes  skin itself, and at length falls off; the inner part is added to the  wood. The bark is to the body of a tree, what the skin of our body is  to the flesh.      Of what use is Bark?    Bark is useful for many things: of the bark of willows and linden  trees, ropes are sometimes made. The Siamese make their cordage of the  cocoa tree bark, as do most of the Asiatic and African nations; in the  East Indies, they make the bark of a certain tree into a kind of  cloth; some are used in medicines, as the Peruvian bark for Quinine;  others in dyeing, as that of the alder; others in spicery, as  cinnamon, &c.; the bark of oak, in tanning; that of a kind of birch is  used by the Indians for making canoes.      What are Canoes?    Boats used by savages; they are made chiefly of the trunks of trees  dug hollow; and sometimes of pieces of bark fastened together.      How do the savages guide them?    With paddles, or oars; they seldom carry sails, and the loading is  laid in the bottom.      Are not the savages very dexterous in the management of them?    Yes, extremely so; they strike the paddles with such regularity, that  the canoes seem to fly along the surface of the water; at the same  time balancing the vessels with their bodies, to prevent their  overturning.         _Dexterous_, expert, nimble.      Do they leave their canoes in the water on their return from a voyage?    No, they draw them ashore, hang them up by the two ends, and leave  them to dry; they are generally so light as to be easily carried from  place to place.      Were not books once made of Bark?    Yes, the ancients wrote their books on the barks of many trees, as on  those of the ash and the lime tree, &c.      Which part did they use?    Not the exterior or outer bark, but the inner and finer, which is of  so durable a texture, that there are manuscripts written on it which  are still extant, though more than a thousand years old.      Is it not also used in Manure?    Yes, especially that of the oak; but the best oak bark is used in  tanning.      What is Cork?    The thick, spongy, external bark of the Cork Tree, a species of oak.  There are two varieties of this tree, the broad-leaved and the narrow:  it is an evergreen, and grows to the height of thirty feet. The Cork  Tree attains to a very great age.      Where is the Tree found?    In Spain, Italy, France, and many other countries. The true cork is  the produce of the broad-leaved tree.      What are its uses?    Cork is employed in various ways, but especially for stopping vessels  containing liquids, and, on account of its buoyancy in water, in the  construction of life boats. It is also used in the manufacture of life  preservers and cork jackets. The greatest quantities are brought from  Catalonia, in Spain. The uses of Cork were well known to the ancients.      To what particular use did the Egyptians put it?    They made coffins of it, lined with a resinous composition, which  preserved the bodies of the dead uncorrupted.      What is Cochineal?    A drug used by the dyers, for dyeing crimsons and scarlets; and for  making carmine, a brilliant red used in painting, and several of"]]]
