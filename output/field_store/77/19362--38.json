But if they had told us not to say anything about the planet  Mars or the Book of Deuteronomy, I should not have asked why; there were  a great many things which seemed to me to have as little reason. I first  came to understand anything about \"the man without a country\" one day  when we overhauled a dirty little schooner which had slaves on board.  An officer was sent to take charge of her, and, after a few minutes, he  sent back his boat to ask that some one might be sent him who could  speak Portuguese. We were all looking over the rail when the message  came, and we all wished we could interpret, when the captain asked Who  spoke Portuguese. But none of the officers did; and just as the captain  was sending forward to ask if any of the people could, Nolan stepped out  and said he should be glad to interpret, if the captain wished, as he  understood the language. The captain thanked him, fitted out another  boat with him, and in this boat it was my luck to go.    When we got there, it was such a scene as you seldom see, and never want  to. Nastiness beyond account, and chaos run loose in the midst of the  nastiness. There were not a great many of the negroes; but by way of  making what there were understand that they were free, Vaughan had had  their hand-cuffs and ankle-cuffs knocked off, and, for convenience'  sake, was putting them upon the rascals of the schooner's crew. The  negroes were, most of them, out of the hold, and swarming all round the  dirty deck, with a central throng surrounding Vaughan and addressing him  in every dialect, and _patois_ of a dialect, from the Zulu click up to  the Parisian of Beledeljereed.    As we came on deck, Vaughan looked down from a hogshead, on which he had  mounted in desperation, and said:--    \"For God's love, is there anybody who can make these wretches understand  something? The men gave them rum, and that did not quiet them. I knocked  that big fellow down twice, and that did not soothe him. And then I  talked Choctaw to all of them together; and I'll be hanged if they  understood that as well as they understood the English.\"    Nolan said he could speak Portuguese, and one or two fine-looking  Kroomen were dragged out, who, as it had been found already, had worked  for the Portuguese on the coast at Fernando Po.    \"Tell them they are free,\" said Vaughan; \"and tell them that these  rascals are to be hanged as soon as we can get rope enough.\"    Nolan \"put that into Spanish,\"--that is, he explained it in such  Portuguese as the Kroomen could understand, and they in turn to such of  the negroes as could understand them. Then there was such a yell of  delight, clinching of fists, leaping and dancing, kissing of Nolan's  feet, and a general rush made to the hogshead by way of spontaneous  worship of Vaughan, as the _deus ex machina_ of the occasion.    \"Tell them,\" said Vaughan, well pleased, \"that I will take them all to  Cape Palmas.\"    This did not answer so well. Cape Palmas was practically as far from the  homes of most of them as New Orleans or Rio Janeiro was; that is, they  would be eternally separated from home there. And their interpreters, as  we could understand, instantly said, \"_Ah, non Palmas_\" and began to  propose infinite other expedients in most voluble language. Vaughan was  rather disappointed at this result of his liberality, and asked Nolan  eagerly what they said. The drops stood on poor Nolan's white forehead,  as he hushed the men down, and said:--    \"He says, 'Not Palmas.' He says, 'Take us home, take us to our own  country, take us to our own house, take us to our own pickaninnies and  our own women.' He says he has an old father and mother who will die if  they do not see him. And this one says he left his people all sick, and  paddled down to Fernando to beg the white doctor to come and help them,  and that these devils caught him in the bay just in sight of home, and  that he has never seen anybody from home since then. And this one says,\"  choked out Nolan, \"that he has not heard a word from his home in six  months, while he has been locked up in an infernal barracoon.\"    Vaughan always said he grew gray himself while Nolan struggled through  this interpretation. I, who did not understand anything of the passion  involved in it, saw that the very elements were melting with fervent  heat, and that something was to pay somewhere. Even the negroes  themselves stopped howling, as they saw Nolan's agony, and Vaughan's  almost equal agony of sympathy. As quick as he could get words, he  said:--    \"Tell them yes, yes, yes; tell them they shall go to the Mountains of  the Moon, if they will. If I sail the schooner through the Great White  Desert, they shall go home!\"    And after some fashion Nolan said so. And then they all fell to kissing  him again, and wanted to rub his nose with theirs.    But he could not stand it long; and getting Vaughan to say he might go  back, he beckoned me down into our boat. As we lay back in the  stern-sheets and the men gave way, he said to me: \"Youngster, let that  show you what it is to be without a family, without a home, and without  a country. And if you are ever tempted to say a word or to do a thing  that shall put a bar between you and your family, your home, and your  country, pray God in his mercy to take you that instant home to his own  heaven. Stick by your family, boy; forget you have a self, while you do  everything for them. Think of your home, boy; write and send, and talk  about it. Let it be nearer and nearer to your thought, the farther you  have to travel from it; and rush back to it, when you are free, as that  poor black slave is doing now. And for your country, boy,\" and the words  rattled in his throat, \"and for that flag,\" and he pointed to the ship,  \"never dream a dream but of serving her as she bids you, though the  service carry you through a thousand hells. No matter what happens to  you, no matter who flatters you or who abuses you, never look at another  flag, never let a night pass but you pray God to bless that flag.  Remember, boy, that behind all these men you have to do with, behind  officers, and government, and people even, there is the Country Herself,  your Country, and that you belong to Her as you belong to your own  mother. Stand by Her, boy, as you would stand by your mother, if those  devils there had got hold of her to-day!\"    I was frightened to death by his calm, hard passion, but I blundered  out, that I would, by all that was holy, and that I had never thought of  doing anything else. He hardly seemed to hear me; but he did, almost in  a whisper, say: \"O, if anybody had said so to me when I was of your  age!\"    I think it was this half-confidence of his, which I never abused, for I  never told this story till now, which afterward made us great friends.  He was very kind to me. Often he sat up, or even got up, at night, to  walk the deck with me, when it was my watch. He explained to me a great  deal of my mathematics, and I owe to him my taste for mathematics. He  lent me books, and helped me about my reading. He never alluded so  directly to his story again; but from one and another officer I have  learned, in thirty years, what I am telling. When we parted from him in  St. Thomas harbor, at the end of our cruise, I was more sorry than I can  tell. I was very glad to meet him again in 1830; and later in life, when  I thought I had some influence in Washington, I moved heaven and earth  to have him discharged. But it was like getting a ghost out of prison.  They pretended there was no such man, and never was such a man. They  will say so at the Department now! Perhaps they do not know. It will not  be the first thing in the service of which the Department appears to  know nothing!    There is a story that Nolan met Burr once on one of our vessels, when a  party of Americans came on board in the Mediterranean. But this I  believe to be a lie; or, rather, it is a myth, _ben trovato_, involving  a tremendous blowing-up with which he sunk Burr,--asking him how he  liked to be \"without a country.\" But it is clear from Burr's life, that  nothing of the sort could have happened; and I mention this only as an  illustration of the stories which get a-going where there is the least  mystery at bottom.    So poor Philip Nolan had his wish fulfilled. I know but one fate more  dreadful; it is the fate reserved for those men who shall have one day  to exile themselves from their country because they have attempted her  ruin, and shall have at the same time to see the prosperity and honor to  which she rises when she has rid herself of them and their iniquities.  The wish of poor Nolan, as we all learned to call him, not because his  punishment was too great, but because his repentance was so clear, was  precisely the wish of every Bragg and Beauregard who broke a soldier's  oath two years ago, and of every Maury and Barron who broke a sailor's.  I do not know how often they have repented. I do know that they have  done all that in them lay that they might have no country,--that all the  honors, associations, memories, and hopes which belong to \"country\"  might be broken up into little shreds and distributed to the winds. I  know, too, that their punishment, as they vegetate through what is left  of life to them in wretched Boulognes and Leicester Squares, where they  are destined to upbraid each other till they die, will have all the  agony of Nolan's, with the added pang that every one who sees them will  see them to despise and to execrate them. They will have their wish,  like him.    For him, poor fellow, he repented of his folly, and then, like a man,  submitted to the fate he had asked for. He never intentionally added to  the difficulty or delicacy of the charge of those who had him in hold.  Accidents would happen; but they never happened from his fault.  Lieutenant Truxton told me, that,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15869"],[0,"A Voyage Towards the South Pole and Round the World Volume 2 (#5)"],[1,"e; and I have reason to believe my  endeavours succeeded.    Having mentioned a house, it may not be amiss to observe, that some here  differ from those I saw at the other isles: being inclosed or walled on  every side, with reeds neatly put together, but not close. The entrance is  by a square hole, about two feet and a half each way. The form of these  houses is an oblong square; the floor or foundation every way shorter than  the eve, which is about four feet from the ground. By this construction,  the rain that falls on the roof, is carried off from the wall, which  otherwise would decay and rot.    We did not distinguish any king or leading chief, or any person who took  upon him the appearance of supreme authority. The man and woman before  mentioned, whom I believed to be man and wife, interested themselves on  several occasions in our affairs; but it was easy to see they had no great  authority. Amongst other things which I gave them as a reward for their  service, was a young dog and bitch, animals which they have not, but are  very fond of, and know very well by name. They have some of the same sort  of earthen pots we saw at Amsterdam; and I am of opinion they are of their  own manufacture, or that of some neighbouring isle.    The road, as I have already mentioned, is on the north side of the isle,  just to the southward of the southernmost cove; for there are two on this  side. The bank is of some extent, and the bottom free from rocks, with  twenty-five and twenty fathoms water, one or two miles from the shore.    Fire-wood is very convenient to be got at, and easy to be shipped off; but  the water is so brackish that it is not worth the trouble of carrying it on  board; unless one is in great distress for want of that article, and can  get no better. There is, however, better, not only on this isle, but on  others in the neighbourhood; for the people brought us some in cocoa-nut  shells which was as good as need be; but probably the springs are too  trifling to water a ship.    I have already observed, that the S.W. side of the island is covered by a  reef or reefs of rocks, and small isles. If there be a sufficient depth of  water between them and the island, as there appeared to be, and a good  bottom, this would be a much securer place for a ship to anchor in, than  that where we had our station.    CHAPTER III.    _The Passage from the Friendly Isles to the New Hebrides, with an Account  of the Discovery of Turtle Island, and a Variety of Incidents which  happened, both before and after the Ship arrived in Port Sandwich, in the  Island of Mallicollo. A Description of the Port, the adjacent Country, its  Inhabitants, and many other Particulars._    1774 July    On the first of July, at sun-rise, Amattafoa was still in sight, bearing  N.E., distant twenty leagues. Continuing our course to the west, we, the  next day at noon, discovered land bearing N.W. by W., for which we steered;  and, upon a nearer approach, found it to be a small island. At four o'clock  it bore from N.W. half W. to N.W. by N., and, at the same time, breakers  were seen from the masthead, extending from W. to S.W. The day being too  far spent to make farther discoveries, we soon after shortened sail, hauled  the wind, and spent the night, making short boards, which, at day-break, we  found had been so advantageous that we were farther from the island than we  expected, and it was eleven o'clock before we reached the N.W. or lee-side,  where anchorage and landing seemed practicable. In order to obtain a  knowledge of the former, I sent the master with a boat to sound, and, in  the mean time, we stood on and off with the ship. At this time four or five  people were seen on the reef, which lies round the isle, and about three  times that number on the shore. As the boat advanced, those on the reef  retired and joined the others; and when the boat landed they all fled to  the woods. It was not long before the boat returned, when the master  informed me that there were no soundings without the reef, over which, in  one place only, he found a boat channel of six feet water. Entering by it,  he rowed in for the shore, thinking to speak with the people, not more than  twenty in number, who were armed with clubs and spears; but the moment he  set his foot on shore, they retired to the woods. He left on the rocks some  medals, nails, and a knife, which they no doubt found, as some were seen  near the place afterwards. This island is not quite a league in length, in  the direction of N.E. and S.W., and not half that in breadth. It is covered  with wood, and surrounded by a reef of coral rocks, which in some places  extend two miles from the shore. It seems to be too small to contain many  inhabitants; and probably the few whom we saw, may have come from some isle  in the neighbourhood to fish for turtle; as many were seen near this reef,  and occasioned that name to be given to the island, which is situated in  latitude 19 deg. 48' south, longitude 178 deg. 21' west.    Seeing breakers to the S.S.W., which I was desirous of knowing the extent  of before night, I left Turtle Isle, and stood for them. At two o'clock we  found they were occasioned by a coral bank, of about four or five leagues  in circuit. By the bearing we had taken, we knew these to be the same  breakers we had seen the preceding evening. Hardly any part of this bank or  reef is above water at the reflux of the waves. The heads of some of the  rocks are to be seen near the edge of the reef, where it is the shoalest;  for in the middle is deep water. In short, this bank wants only a few  little islets to make it exactly like one of the half-drowned isles so  often mentioned. It lies S.W. from Turtle Island, about five or six miles,  and the channel between it and the reef of that isle is three miles over.  Seeing no more shoals or islands, and thinking there might be turtle on  this bank, two boats were properly equipped and sent thither; but returned  without having seen one.    The boats were now hoisted in, and we made sail to the west, with a brisk  gale at east, which continued till the 9th, when we had for a few hours, a  breeze at N.W., attended with squalls of rain. This was succeeded by a  steady fresh gale at S.E., with which we steered N.W., being at this time  in the latitude of 20 deg. 20' S. longitude 176 deg. 8' E.    On the 15th at noon, being in the latitude of 15 deg. 9' south, longitude 171 deg.  16' east, I steered west. The next day the weather was foggy, and the wind  blew in heavy squalls, attended with rain, which in this ocean, within the  tropics, generally indicates the vicinity of some high land. This was  verified at three in the afternoon, when high land was seen bearing S.W.  Upon this we took in the small sails, reefed the top-sails, and hauling up  for it, at half-past five we could see it extend from S.S.W. to N.N.W. half  W. Soon after we tacked and spent the night, which was very stormy, in  plying. Our boards were disadvantageous; for, in the morning, we found we  had lost ground. This, indeed, was no wonder, for having an old suit of  sails bent, the most of them were split to pieces; particularly a  fore-top-sail, which was rendered quite useless. We got others to the yards,  and continued to ply, being desirous of getting round the south ends of the  lands, or at least so far to the south as to be able to judge of their  extent in that direction. For no one doubted that this was the Australia  del Espiritu Santo of Quiros, which M. de Bougainville calls the Great  Cyclades, and that the coast we were now upon was the east side of Aurora  Island, whose longitude is 168 deg. 30' E.    The gale kept increasing till we were reduced to our low sails; so that, on  the 18th, at seven in the morning, I gave over plying, set the top-sails  double-reefed, bore up for, and hauled round the north end of Aurora  Island, and then stretched over for the Isle of Lepers, under close-reefed  topsails and courses, with a very hard gale at N.E.; but we had now the  advantage of a smooth sea, having the Isle of Aurora to windward. At noon  the north end of it bore N.E. 1/2 N., distant four leagues; our latitude,  found by double altitudes, and reduced to this time, was 15 deg. 1' 30\" south,  longitude 168 deg. 14' east. At two o'clock p.m. we drew near the middle of the  Isle of Lepers, and tacked about two miles from land; in which situation we  had no soundings with a line of seventy fathoms. We now saw people on the  shore, and many beautiful cascades of water pouring down the neighbouring  hills. The next time we stood for this isle, we came to within half a mile  of it, where we found thirty fathoms a sandy bottom; but a mile off we  found no soundings at seventy fathoms. Here two canoes came off to us, in  one of which were three men, and in the other but one. Though we made all  the signs of friendship, we could not bring them nearer than a stone's  throw; and they made but a short stay before they retired ashore, where we  saw a great number of people assembled in parties, and armed with bows and  arrows. They were of a very dark colour; and, excepting some ornaments at  their breast and arms, seemed to be entirely naked.    As I intended to get to the south, in order to explore the land which might  lie there, we continued to ply between the Isle of Lepers and Aurora; and  on the 19th, at noon, the south end of the last-mentioned isle bore south  24 deg. east, and the north end north, distant twenty miles. Latitude observed  15 deg. 11'. The wind continued to blow strong at S.E., so that what we got by  plying in the day, we lost in the night. On the 20th, at sun-rise, we found  ourselves off the south end of Aurora, on the N.W. side of which, the coast  forms a small bay. In this we made some trips to try for anchorage; but  found no less than eighty fathoms water, the bottom a fine dark sand, at  half a mile from shore. Nevertheless, I"]]]
