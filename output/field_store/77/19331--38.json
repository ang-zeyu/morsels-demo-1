We may be excused perhaps for thinking that it had  been well for the inhabitants of the New World, if Fortune had delivered  them into the hands of the generous Arabs rather than to the cruel  soldiery of Cortes and Pizarro.        [1] Al Makk., ii. 34. \"What are thirty barbarians perched upon      a rock? They must inevitably die.\"        [2] Carlyle's \"Hero Worship\" ad finem.        [3] Cardonne, i. p. 37; Gibbon, vi. 348, note.    In 688, that is, in a little more than a generation from the death of  Mohammed, the Moslems undertook the siege of Constantinople. Fortunately  for the cause of civilisation and of Christendom, this long siege of  several years proved unsuccessful, as well as a second attack in 717.  But by the latter date the footing in Europe, which the valour of the  Byzantines denied them, had already been gained by the expedition into  Spain under Tarik in 711. The same year that witnessed the crossing of  the Straits of Gibraltar in the West saw also in the East the passage of  the Oxus by the eager warriors of Islam.    There seems to be some ground for supposing that the Saracens had  attacked Spain even before the time of Tarik. As early as 648, or only  one year after the invasion of Africa, an expedition is said to have  been made into that country under Abdullah ibn Sa'd,[1] which resulted  in the temporary subjugation of the southern provinces. A second inroad  is mentioned by Abulfeda[2] as having taken place in Othman's reign  (644-656); while for an incursion in the reign of Wamba (671-680) we  have the authority of the Spanish historians, Isidore of Beja and  Sebastian of Salamanca, the former of whom adds the fact that the  Saracens were invited in by Erviga, who afterwards succeeded Wamba on  the throne--a story which seems likely enough when read in the light of  the subsequent treason of Julian. These earlier attacks, however, seem  to have been mere raids, undertaken without an immediate view to  permanent conquest.    By way of retaliation, or with a commendable foresight, the Goths sent  help to Carthage when besieged by the Arabs in 695; and, while Julian  their general still remained true to his allegiance, they beat off the  Saracens from Ceuta. But on the surrender of that fortress the Arabs  were enabled to send across the Straits a small reconnoitring detachment  of five hundred men under Tarif abu Zarah,[3] a Berber. This took place  in October 710; but the actual invasion did not occur till April 30,  711, when 12,000 men landed under Tarik ibn Zeyad. There seems to have  been a preliminary engagement before the decisive one of Gaudalete (July  19th-26th)--the Gothic general in the former being stated variously to  have been Theodomir,[4] Sancho,[5] or Edeco.[6]        [1] See De Gayangos' note on Al Makkari, i. p. 382.        [2] \"Annales Moslemici,\" i. p. 262.        [3] The names of Tarif ibn Malik abu Zarah and Tarik ibn Zeyad      have been confused by all the careless writers on Spanish      history--_e.g._ Conde, Dunham, Yonge, Southey, etc.; but Gibbon,      Freeman, etc., of course do not fall into this error. For      Tarif's names see De Gayangos, Al Makk., i. pp. 517, 519; and      for Tarik's see \"Ibn Abd el Hakem,\" Jones' translation, note      10.

It is enough to say that in three years almost all Spain and  part of Southern Gaul were added to the Saracen empire. But the Arabs  made the fatal mistake[1] of leaving a remnant of their enemies  unconquered in the mountains of Asturia, and hardly had the wave of  conquest swept over the country, than it began slowly but surely to  recede. The year 733 witnessed the high-water mark of Arab extension in  the West, and Christian Gaul was never afterwards seriously threatened  with the calamity of a Mohammedan domination.    The period of forty-five years which elapsed between the conquest and  the establishment of the Khalifate of Cordova was a period of disorder,  almost amounting to anarchy, throughout Spain. This state of things was  one eminently favourable to the growth and consolidation of the infant  state which was arising among the mountains of the Northwest. In that  corner of the land, which alone[2] was not polluted by the presence of  Moslem masters, were gathered all those proud spirits who could not  brook subjection and valued freedom above all earthly possessions.[3]  Here all the various nationalities that had from time to time borne  rule in Spain,        \"Punic and Roman Kelt and Goth and Greek,\" [4]    all the various classes, nobles, freemen, and slaves, were gradually  welded by the strong pressure of a common calamity into one compact and  homogeneous whole.[5] Meanwhile what was the condition of those  Christians who preferred to live in their own homes, but under the  Moslem yoke? It must be confessed that they might have fared much worse;  and the conciliatory policy pursued by the Arabs no doubt contributed  largely to the facility of the conquest. The first conqueror, Tarik ibn  Zeyad, was a man of remarkable generosity and clemency, and his conduct  fully justified the proud boast which he uttered when arraigned on false  charges before the Sultan Suleiman.[6] \"Ask the true believers,\" he  said, \"ask also the Christians, what the conduct of Tarik has been in  Africa and in Spain. Let them say if they have ever found him cowardly,  covetous, or cruel.\"        [1] Al Makkari, ii. 34.        [2] According to Sebastian of Salamanca, the Moors had never      been admitted into any town of Biscay before 870.        [3] Prescott, \"Ferdinand and Isabella,\" seems to think that      only the lower orders remained under the Moors. Yet in a note      he mentions a remark of Zurita's to the contrary (page 3).        [4] Southey, \"Roderick,\" Canto IV.        [5] Thierry, \"Dix Ans d'Etudes Historiques,\" p. 346. \"Reserres      dans ce coin de terre, devenu pour eux toute la patrie, Goths      et Romains, vainqueurs et vaincus, etrangers et indigenes,      maitres et esclaves, tous unis dans le meme malheur ... furent      egaux dans cet exil.\" Yet there were revolts in every reign.      Fruela I. (757-768), revolt of Biscay and Galicia: Aurelio      (768-774), revolt of slaves and freedmen, see \"Chron. Albeld.,\"      vi. sec. 4, and Rodrigo, iii. c. 5, in pristinam servitutem      redacti sunt: Silo (774-783), Galician revolt: also revolts in      reigns of Alfonso I., Ramiro I. See Prescott, \"Ferd. and      Isab.,\" p. 4.        [6] Or his predecessor, Welid, for the point is not determined.    The terms granted to such towns as surrendered generally contained the  following provisions: that the citizens should give up all their horses  and arms; that they might, if they chose, depart, leaving their  property; that those who remained should, on payment of a small tribute,  be permitted to follow their own religion, for which purposes certain  churches were to be left standing; that they should have their own  judges, and enjoy (within limits) their own laws. In some cases the  riches of the churches were also surrendered, as at Merida,[1] and  hostages given. But conditions even better than these were obtained from  Abdulaziz, son of Musa, by Theodomir in Murcia. The original document  has been preserved by the Arab historians, and is well worthy of  transcription:    \"In the name of God the Clement and Merciful! Abdulaziz and Tadmir make  this treaty of peace--may God confirm and protect it! Tadmir shall  retain the command over his own people, but over no other people among  those of his faith. There shall be no wars between his subjects and  those of the Arabs, nor shall the children or women of his people be led  captive. They shall not be disturbed in the exercise of their religion:  their churches shall not be burnt, nor shall any services be demanded  from them, or obligations be laid upon them--those expressed in this  treaty alone excepted.... Tadmir shall not receive our enemies, nor fail  in fidelity to us, and he shall not conceal whatever hostile purposes he  may know to exist against us. His nobles and himself shall pay a tribute  of a dinar[2] each year, with four measures of wheat and four of barley;  of mead, vinegar, honey, and oil each four measures. All the vassals of  Tadmir, and every man subject to tax, shall pay the half of these  imposts.\"[3]    These favourable terms were due in part to the address of Theodomir,[4]  and partly perhaps to Abdulaziz's own partiality for the Christians,  which was also manifested in his marriage with Egilona, the widow of  King Roderic, and the deference which he paid to her. This predilection  for the Christians brought the son of Musa into ill favour with the  Arabs, and he was assassinated in 716.[5]        [1] Conde i. p. 69. This was perhaps due to Musa's notorious      avarice.        [2] Somewhat less than ten shillings.        [3] Al Makkari, i. 281: Conde, i. p. 76.        [4] Isidore, sec, 38, says of him: \"Fuit scripturarum amator,      eloquentia mirificus, in proeliis expeditus, qui et apud Amir      Almumenin prudentior inter ceteros inventus, utiliter est      honoratus.\"        [5] Al Makkari, ii. p. 30. He was even accused of entering into      treasonable correspondence with the Christians of Galicia; of      forming a project for the massacre of Moslems; of being himself      a Christian, etc.    On the whole it may be said that the Saracen conquest was accomplished  with wonderfully little bloodshed, and with few or none of those  atrocities which generally characterize the subjugation of a whole  people by men of an alien race and an alien creed. It cannot, however,  be denied that the only contemporary Christian chronicler is at variance  on this point with all the Arab accounts.    \"Who,\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15263"],[0,"The Underground Railroad (#5)"],[1," It was rainy and muddy--my pants were rolled up to the knees. I was in  the character of a man seeking employment in this country. End of thirty  minutes gave the second signal.    William appeared unmoved; soon sent out the boys; instantly sociable;  Peter and Levin at the Island; one of the young masters with them; not  safe to undertake to see them till Saturday night, when they would be at  home; appointed a place to see Vina, in an open field, that night; they  to bring me something to eat; our interview only four minutes; I left;  appeared by night; dark and cloudy; at ten o'clock appeared William;  exchanged signals; led me a few rods to where stood Vina; gave her the  signal sent by Peter; our interview ten minutes; she did not call me  \"master,\" nor did she say \"sir,\" by which I knew she had confidence in  me.    Our situation being dangerous, we decided that I meet Peter and Levin on  the bank of the river early dawn of day, Sunday, to establish the laws.  During our interview, William prostrated on his knees, and face to the  ground; arms sprawling; head cocked back, watching for wolves, by which  position a man can see better in the dark. No house to go to safely,  traveled round till morning, eating hoe cake which William had given me  for supper; next day going around to get employment. I thought of  William, who is a Christian preacher, and of the Christian preachers in  Pennsylvania. One watching for wolves by night, to rescue Vina and her  three children from Christian licentiousness; the other standing erect  in open day, seeking the praise of men.    During the four days waiting for the important Sunday morning, I  thoroughly surveyed the rocks and shoals of the river from Florence  seven miles up, where will be my place of departure. General notice was  taken of me as being a stranger, lurking around. Fortunately there are  several small grist mills within ten miles around. No taverns here, as  in the North; any planter's house entertains travelers occasionally.    One night I stayed at a medical gentleman's, who is not a large planter;  another night at an ex-magistrate's house in South Florence--a Virginian  by birth--one of the late census takers; told me that many more persons  cannot read and write than is reported; one fact, amongst many others,  that many persons who do not know the letters of the alphabet, have  learned to write their own names; such are generally reported readers  and writers.    It being customary for a stranger not to leave the house early in the  morning where he has lodged, I was under the necessity of staying out  all night Saturday, to be able to meet Peter and Levin, which was  accomplished in due time. When we approached, I gave my signal first;  immediately they gave theirs. I talked freely. Levin's voice, at first,  evidently trembled. No wonder, for my presence universally attracted  attention by the lords of the land. Our interview was less than one  hour; the laws were written. I to go to Cincinnati to get a rowing boat  and provisions; a first class clipper boat to go with speed. To depart  from the place where the laws were written, on Saturday night of the  first of March. I to meet one of them at the same place Thursday night,  previous to the fourth Saturday from the night previous to the Sunday  when the laws were written. We to go down the Tennessee river to some  place up the Ohio, not yet decided on, in our row boat. Peter and Levin  are good oarsmen. So am I. Telegraph station at Tuscumbia, twelve miles  from the plantation, also at Paducah.    Came from Florence to here Sunday night by steamboat. Eastport is in  Mississippi. Waiting here for a steamboat to go down; paying one dollar  a day for board. Like other taverns here, the wretchedness is  indescribable; no pen, ink, paper or newspaper to be had; only one room  for everybody, except the gambling rooms. It is difficult for me to  write. Vina intends to get a pass for Catharine and herself for the  first Sunday in March.    The bank of the river where I met Peter and Levin is two miles from the  plantation. I have avoided saying I am from Philadelphia. Also avoided  talking about negroes. I never talked so much about milling before. I  consider most of the trouble over, till I arrive in a free State with my  crew, the first week in March; then will I have to be wiser than  Christian serpents, and more cautious than doves. I do not consider it  safe to keep this letter in my possession, yet I dare not put it in the  post-office here; there is so little business in these post-offices that  notice might be taken.    I am evidently watched; everybody knows me to be a miller. I may write  again when I get to Cincinnati, if I should have time. The  ex-magistrate, with whom I stayed in South Florence, held three hours'  talk with me, exclusive of our morning talk. Is a man of good general  information; he was exceedingly inquisitive. \"I am from Cincinnati,  formerly from the _State of New York_.\" I had no opportunity to get  anything to eat from seven o'clock Tuesday morning till six o'clock  Wednesday evening, except the hoe cake, and no sleep.    Florence is the head of navigation for small steamboats. Seven miles,  all the way up to my place of departure, is swift water, and rocky.  Eight hundred miles to Cincinnati. I found all things here as Peter told  me, except the distance of the river. South Florence contains twenty  white families, three warehouses of considerable business, a  post-office, but no school. McKiernon is here waiting for a steamboat to  go to New Orleans, so we are in company.    PRINCETON, GIBSON COUNTY, INDIANA, FEB. 18, 1851.    To Wm. Still:--The plan is to go to Canada, on the Wabash, opposite  Detroit. There are four routes to Canada. One through Illinois,  commencing above and below Alton; one through to North Indiana, and the  Cincinnati route, being the largest route in the United States.    I intended to have gone through Pennsylvania, but the risk going up the  Ohio river has caused me to go to Canada. Steamboat traveling is  universally condemned, though many go in boats, consequently many get  lost. Going in a skiff is new, and is approved of in my case. After I  arrive at the mouth of the Tennessee river, I will go up the Ohio  seventy-five miles, to the mouth of the Wabash, then up the Wabash,  forty-four miles to New Harmony, where I shall go ashore by night, and  go thirteen miles east, to Charles Grier, a farmer, (colored man), who  will entertain us, and next night convey us sixteen miles to David  Stormon, near Princeton, who will take the command, and I be released.    David Stormon estimates the expenses from his house to Canada, at forty  dollars, without which, no sure protection will be given. They might be  instructed concerning the course, and beg their way through without  money. If you wish to do what should be done, you will send me fifty  dollars, in a letter, to Princeton, Gibson county, Inda., so as to  arrive there by the 8th of March. Eight days should be estimated for a  letter to arrive from Philadelphia.    The money to be State Bank of Ohio, or State Bank, or Northern Bank of  Kentucky, or any other Eastern bank. Send no notes larger than twenty  dollars.    Levi Coffin had no money for me. I paid twenty dollars for the skiff. No  money to get back to Philadelphia. It was not understood that I would  have to be at any expense seeking aid.    One half of my time has been used in trying to find persons to assist,  when I may arrive on the Ohio river, in which I have failed, except  Stormon.    Having no letter of introduction to Stormon from any source, on which I  could fully rely, I traveled two hundred miles around, to find out his  stability. I have found many Abolitionists, nearly all who have made  propositions, which themselves would not comply with, and nobody else  would. Already I have traveled over three thousand miles. Two thousand  and four hundred by steamboat, two hundred by railroad, one hundred by  stage, four hundred on foot, forty-eight in a skiff.    I have yet five hundred miles to go to the plantation, to commence  operations. I have been two weeks on the decks of steamboats, three  nights out, two of which I got perfectly wet. If I had had paper money,  as McKim desired, it would have been destroyed. I have not been  entertained gratis at any place except Stormon's. I had one hundred and  twenty-six dollars when I left Philadelphia, one hundred from you,  twenty-six mine.    Telegraphed to station at Evansville, thirty-three miles from Stormon's,  and at Vinclure's, twenty-five miles from Stormon's. The Wabash route is  considered the safest route. No one has ever been lost from Stormon's to  Canada. Some have been lost between Stormon's and the Ohio. The wolves  have never suspected Stormon. Your asking aid in money for a case  properly belonging east of Ohio, is detested. If you have sent money to  Cincinnati, you should recall it. I will have no opportunity to use it.    Seth Concklin, Princeton, Gibson county, Ind.    P.S. First of April, will be about the time Peter's family will arrive  opposite Detroit. You should inform yourself how to find them there. I  may have no opportunity.    I will look promptly for your letter at Princeton, till the 10th of  March, and longer if there should have been any delay by the mails.    In March, as contemplated, Concklin arrived in Indiana, at the place  designated, with Peter's wife and three children, and sent a thrilling  letter to the writer, portraying in the most vivid light his adventurous  flight from the hour they left Alabama until their arrival in Indiana.  In this report he stated, that instead of starting early in the morning,  owing to some unforeseen delay on the part of the family, they did not  reach the designated place till towards day, which greatly exposed them  in passing a certain town which he had hoped to avoid.    But as his brave heart was"]]]
