Morris looked up wearily.    \"College Road?\" he repeated. \"Where is that, sir?\"    \"It doesn't matter,\" said Gatton shortly, \"if the name is unfamiliar  to you. Had Sir Marcus a car?\"    \"Not latterly, sir.\"    \"Any other servants?\"    \"No. As a bachelor he had no use for a large establishment, and  Friars' Park remains in the possession of the late Sir Burnham's  widow.\"    \"Sir Burnham? Sir Marcus's uncle?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"What living relatives had Sir Marcus?\"    \"His aunt--Lady Burnham Coverly--with whom I believe he was on bad  terms. Her own son, who ought to have inherited the title, was dead,  you see. I think she felt bitterly towards my master. The only other  relative I ever heard of was Mr. Eric--Sir Marcus's second cousin--now  _Sir_ Eric, of course.\"    I turned aside, glancing at some books which lay scattered on the  table. The wound was a new one and I suppose I was not man enough to  hide the pain which mention of Eric Coverly still occasioned me.    \"Were the cousins good friends?\" continued the even, remorseless voice  of the inquisitor.    Morris looked up quickly.    \"They were not, sir,\" he answered. \"They never had been. But some few  months back a fresh quarrel arose and one night in this very room it  almost came to blows.\"    \"Indeed? What was the quarrel about?\"    The old hesitancy claimed Morris again, but at last:    \"Of course,\" he said, with visible embarrassment, \"it was--a woman.\"    I felt my heart leaping wildly, but I managed to preserve an outward  show of composure.    \"What woman?\" demanded Gatton.    \"I don't know, sir.\"    \"Do you mean it?\"    A fierce note of challenge had come into the quiet voice, but Morris  looked up and met Gatton's searching stare unflinchingly.    \"I swear it,\" he said. \"I never was an eavesdropper.\"    \"I suggest it was the same woman that Sir Marcus went to see last  night?\" Gatton continued.    The examination of Morris had reached a point at which I found myself  hard put to it to retain even a seeming of composure. All Gatton's  questions had been leading up to this suggestion, as I now perceived  clearly enough; and from the cousins' quarrel to Isobel, Eric's  _fiancee_, who was engaged at the New Avenue Theater, was an  inevitable step. But:    \"Possibly, sir,\" was Morris's only answer.    Inspector Gatton stared hard at the man for a moment or so, then:    \"Very well,\" he said. \"Take my advice and turn in. There will be much  for you to do presently, I am afraid. Who was Sir Marcus's solicitor?\"    Morris gave the desired information in a tired, toneless voice, and we  departed. Little did Gatton realize that his words were barbed, when,  as we descended to the street, he said:    \"I have a call to make at Scotland Yard next, after which my first  visit will be to the stage-doorkeeper of the New Avenue Theater.\"    \"Can I be of further assistance to you at the moment?\" I asked,  endeavoring to speak casually.    \"Thanks, no. But I should welcome your company this afternoon at my  examination of the Red House. I understand that it is in your  neighborhood, so perhaps as you are also professionally interested in  the case, you might arrange to meet me there. Are you returning home  now or going to the _Planet_ office?\"    \"I think to the office,\" I replied. \"In any event 'phone there making  an appointment and I will meet you at the Red House.\"          CHAPTER IV    ISOBEL      Ten minutes later I was standing in a charming little boudoir which  too often figured in my daydreams. My own photograph was upon the  mantelpiece, and in Isobel's dark eyes when she greeted me there was a  light which I lacked the courage to try to understand. I had not at  that time learned what I learned later, and have already indicated,  that my own foolish silence had wounded Isobel as deeply as her  subsequent engagement to Eric Coverly had wounded me.    The psychology of a woman is intriguing in its very naivete, and now  as she stood before me, slim and graceful in her well-cut walking  costume, a quick flicker of red flaming in her cheeks and her eyes  alight with that sweet tantalizing look in which expectation and a hot  pride were mingled, I wondered and felt sick at heart. Desirable she  was beyond any other woman I had known, and I called myself witling  coward, to have avoided putting my fortune to the test on that fatal  day of my departure for Mesopotamia. For just as she looked at me now  she had looked at me then. But to-day she was evidently on the point  of setting out--I did not doubt with the purpose of meeting Eric  Coverly; on that day of the irrevocable past she had been free and I  had been silent.    \"You nearly missed me, Jack,\" she said gayly. \"I was just going out.\"    By the very good-fellowship of her greeting she restored me to myself  and enabled me to stamp down--at least temporarily--the monster  through whose greedy eyes I had found myself considering the happiness  of Eric Coverly.    \"I am afraid, Isobel,\" I replied, \"that what I have to tell you is not  by any means pleasant--although--\"    \"Yes?\" she prompted, noting how I hesitated.    \"Although it means that you are now the future Lady Coverly.\"    The bright color left her cheeks. That some black tragedy underlay my  words she had intuitively perceived, but I could see that she failed  to grasp the whole meaning of my bald statement. She sank down slowly  into a cushioned chair, so that a beam of golden light pouring in  through the opened window set aglowing the russet tints in her dark  brown hair.    \"Did you know Sir Marcus?\" I asked, speaking as gently as I could.    With what intense, if hidden, emotion I awaited her answer it were  impossible to describe.    \"Do you mean--\"    She met my glance, and I nodded gravely.    \"Oh, Jack! When did it happen?\"    \"Last night. But you have not told me if you knew him?\" I persisted.    Isobel shook her head.    \"Not in any way--intimately,\" she replied. \"Eric\"--she hesitated,  glancing up quickly and as quickly down again--\"and he were not on  good terms.\"    \"But you had met him?\" I persisted; for I had detected in her manner a  reluctance to discuss Sir Marcus which I failed to understand.    \"I used to meet him, Jack, when--when you were away. He came once or  twice with Eric. They were not good friends, even then. But I never  liked him. I quite lost sight of him from the time that he came into  the title--about four years ago, was it not?--until quite recently. He  had been in Russia, I think. Then he--\" Again she hesitated. It was  odd how often people hesitated, as if seeking for words, when speaking  of the late baronet. \"He called at the theater. Considering that he  knew of my engagement to Eric, his manner was not quite nice. But I  was anxious to prevent trouble, and did not mention the visit to Eric.  Sir Marcus was very persistent, however. One night Eric saw him  leaving the stage-door and I believe there was a dreadful scene at  Eric's rooms.\"    \"And that is all you know of him, Isobel?\"    \"Practically all, except what I have heard, of course. I might add  that I instructed Marie to tell Sir Marcus I was engaged whenever he  might call in future.\"    \"And did he call again?\"    \"Marie said that he sent his card up on several occasions, but she  knew how the affair worried me and did not tell me at the time. I saw  him in the stalls occasionally, and--oh!--\"    The last word was a mere murmur. Isobel's expression grew more than  ever troubled.    \"He was there last night,\" she whispered, and raising her eyes to me:  \"Tell me how it happened, and where--\"    But ere I had time to begin there was an interruption. Dimly, a  telephone bell rang. I could hear the voice of Marie, Isobel's maid,  answering the call then:    \"Mr. Coverly to speak to you, madam,\" said Marie, entering the room.    \"He must have only just heard the news!\" cried Isobel, rising swiftly  and going out.    Consumed by impatience, I walked up and down the dainty apartment  listening to Isobel's muffled voice speaking in the lobby. Twice I  went to the window and peered down into the street, expecting to see  the thick-set figure of Inspector Gatton approaching. My frame of mind  was peculiar and troubled. Gatton's inquiries pointed unmistakably to  a suspicion that Sir Marcus's last hours had been spent, if not  actually with, at any rate near to Isobel. And since the man who would  most directly profit by the baronet's death happened also to be  Isobel's _fiance_, I foresaw a dreadful ordeal for both if Eric  Coverly was not in a position to establish an alibi.    I had been about to ask her if Coverly had been in her company on the  previous night when the interruption had occurred. Now if Gatton  should arrive and find me in Isobel's flat, what construction would he  put upon my presence?    Yet again I went to the window and peered anxiously up and down the  street. Every cab that approached I expected to contain the inspector,  and I heaved a sigh of relief as one after another passed the door.  Pedestrians who turned the distant corner I scrutinized closely and  was so employed when Isobel came running back to the room.    All her color had fled and her eyes were wide and fear-stricken.    \"Oh, Jack, Jack!\" she cried, \"it is horrible, horrible! Eric is at his  solicitors' and they tell him that suspicion is bound to fall on  _him_! It's preposterous--unthinkable. It must have been some fiend  who committed such a crime, not a human being--\"    \"Then,\" I interrupted excitedly, \"Coverly was not with you last  night?\"    \"No! That is the crowning tragedy of it all. He 'phoned me early in  the evening saying that he had an unavoidable business appointment to  keep. From the tone of his voice--\"    She ceased speaking abruptly, and stared at me rather wildly.    \"Isobel,\" I said, \"you should surely know that you can trust your life  to me--and the life of any one dear to you.\"    She quickly laid her hand on my arm and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15344"],[0,"Grace Harlowe's Sophomore Year at High School (#5)"],[1,"ear.\"    \"Well, well, come on and fly,\" cried Hippy. \"My heart is palpitating so  with excitement that I am afraid it will beat once too often if something  doesn't happen.\"    \"I was waiting for my helper,\" answered David, \"but he appears to be late.  You boys will do as well.\"    \"Who is your helper, David?\" asked Anne.    \"You could never guess,\" he replied smiling, \"so I'll have to tell you.  It's old Jean, the hunter.\"    \"Why, the dear old thing!\" cried Grace. \"To think of him leaving his  uncivilized state to do anything so utterly civilized and modern as to  help with a flying machine.\"    \"And he does it well, too,\" went on David. \"He is not only thoroughly  interested but he keeps guard out here in case any one should try to break  in. There are his cot and things in the corner. He sleeps in the open  unless it rains. Then he sleeps inside.\"    As the old hunter did not put in an appearance David decided to wait no  longer.    \"Why can't we all help?\" asked Grace. \"What must we do? Please tell us.\"    \"All right,\" answered David, \"just give it a shove into the open space,  and you'll see how she gradually rises for a flight.\"    After making a careful examination of all the parts of the aeroplane, and  starting the engine, David took his seat in the machine.    Then the two boys, assisted by Grace and Nora, pushed it swiftly out into  the broad open space back of the ruin.    Suddenly the machine began to rise. Slowly, at first, then seeming to  gather strength and confidence like a young bird that has learned to fly  at last, it soared over the apple trees. David, white, but very calm,  quietly worked the levers that operated the little engine. When he had  risen about a hundred feet, he began to dip and soar around the orchard in  circles. He appeared to have forgotten his friends, watching anxiously  below. He did not notice that little Mrs. Gray's knees had suddenly  refused to support her, nor that she had sat flat on the ground in a state  of utter bewilderment at the sight of his sudden flight. David looked far  across at the beautiful rolling meadows, and fields dotted with farmhouses  and cottages. How he loved the fertile valley, with its little river  winding in and out between green banks! It was all so beautiful, but it  was time to descend. He must not give his pet too much liberty, or he  might rue his indiscretion. He headed his machine for the open space back  of the Omnibus House, and began the descent. Then, something snapped, and  he fell. He remembered as he fell the look of horror on the up-raised  faces of his friends, and then everything became a blank.    It all happened in a flash, much too quickly to do anything but stand and  wait until the aeroplane had crashed to the ground, but it seemed much  longer, and Anne remembered later that she had felt a curious impulse to  run away and hide. If David were to meet his death through this new toy,  she could not endure to stay and see it happen.    But David was far from dead. He was only stunned and dizzy from the swift  descent. He had not been high enough from the ground when the accident  occurred to sustain serious injuries. They lifted him from the machine and  laid him upon the grass, while Reddy ran to the brook and brought back his  cap filled with water.    Mrs. Gray produced her smelling salts which she always carried with her.  \"Not for my own use, my dears,\" she always said, \"but for the benefit of  other people.\"    Reddy loosened David's collar and dashed the water into his face; while  Hippy chafed the unconscious boy's wrists.    Presently David opened his eyes, looking vaguely about. He had a confused  idea that something had happened to him, but just what it was he could not  think. He looked up into the anxious faces of his friends who stood around  him. Then he remembered.    \"I'm not hurt,\" he said in a rather weak voice. Then he sat up and smiled  feebly at the company. \"I just had the wind knocked out of me. I am sure  no bones are broken. How about my pet bird? Has she smashed her little  ribs?\"    \"No, old fellow,\" exclaimed Hippy in a reassuring tone, for Hippy had  never been able to endure the sight of suffering or disappointment. \"Her  wings are a good deal battered, that's all. But are you all right, old  man?\" he added, feeling David's arms and legs, and even putting an ear  over his heart.    \"It's still beating, you foolish, old fat-head,\" said David, patting his  friend affectionately on the back.    In the meantime Anne had helped Mrs. Gray to her feet.    \"I declare, I feel as though I had dropped from the clouds myself,\" said  the old lady, wiping her eyes. \"I am so stunned and bewildered. David, my  dear boy, if you had been seriously hurt I should never have forgiven  myself for allowing you to fly off like that. What would your poor mother  say if she knew what had happened?\"    \"It won't be necessary to break the news to her, Mrs. Gray,\" said David.  \"I shall be as good as new inside of a few minutes. It's my poor little  bird here who has received the injuries. Look at her poor battered wings!  I think I know just what caused my sudden descent though, and I'll take  care it doesn't happen again.\"    David then began a minute examination of his damaged pet, and soon located  the trouble. His friends listened, deeply interested, as he explained the  principles of aviation, and showed them how he had carried out his own  ideas in constructing his aeroplane. Grace, who had a taste for mechanics,  asked all sorts of questions, until Hippy asked her if she intended  building an aeroplane of her own.    \"I may,\" replied Grace, laughing. \"You know that girls have as much chance  at the big things of the world to-day, as boys.\"    \"Well, if you do, let me know,\" responded Hippy, \"and I'll write an epic  poem about you that will make the world sit up and take notice.\"    \"Then I am assured of fame beforehand,\" laughed Grace.    \"Look!\" said Nora suddenly. \"Who are those people coming across the  orchard? Doesn't that look like Julia Crosby and some of her crowd?\"    \"Yes,\" exclaimed Grace, \"it is, and Miriam is with them.\"    \"Then help me get my aeroplane into the shed quickly,\" exclaimed David.  \"You know that the Crosby girl is not a favorite with me.\" Then he added  half to himself, \"I don't see why Miriam insists on going around with her  so much.\"    The boys lost no time in getting the aeroplane into the house, David  slammed the doors, and triumphantly turned the key in the lock just as  Miriam and her party came up.    With a quick glance Miriam's eyes took in the situation. She bowed  courteously to Mrs. Gray, whom she dared not slight; included Grace, Nora  and Jessica in a cool little nod, and stared straight past Anne. Then  turning to her brother she said, \"David, show Miss Crosby and her friends  your aeroplane, they wish to see it.\"    A look of grim determination settled about David's mouth. Looking his  sister squarely in the face, he said, \"I am sorry to seem disobliging but  I cannot show your friends my aeroplane and I am surprised to find that  they know I have one.\"    Miriam reddened at this, but said insolently, \"If you can invite other  people to see it, you can show it to us.\"    There was an uncomfortable silence. Mrs. Gray looked surprised and  annoyed. The peaceful old lady, disliked scenes of any kind. Grace and her  chums, knowing that Miriam was only making herself ridiculous, felt  embarrassed for her. Then Julia Crosby laughed in her tantalizing  irritating way.    That settled the matter as far as David was concerned.    \"You are right,\" he said, \"I could show my flying machine to you and your  friends if I cared to do so. However, I don't care to. Knowing that I  wished my experiment to be kept a secret, you came here with the one idea  of being disagreeable, and you have succeeded. I am sorry to be so rude to  my own sister, but occasionally the brutal truth is a good thing for you  to hear, Miriam.\"    Miriam was speechless with anger, but before she could frame a reply, Mrs.  Gray said soothingly \"Children, children don't quarrel. David, it is  getting late. We had better go. I suppose it is of no use to ask any of  you athletic young folks to ride back to town.\" With a little bow to  Miriam and her discomfited party, Mrs. Gray turned toward where her  carriage awaited her, followed by David and his friends.    After bidding her good-bye, the young people took the road to town. For  David's sake all mention of the recent unpleasantness was tacitly avoided,  though it was uppermost in each one's mind.    \"I have one thing to be thankful for,\" said Grace to Anne, as she turned  in at her own gate, \"and that is that Miriam Nesbit isn't my sister.\"    As for Miriam, her feelings can be better imagined than described. She  sulked and pouted the whole way home, vowing to get even with David for  daring to cross her. Julia Crosby grew rather tired of Miriam's tirade,  and left her with the parting advice that she had better forget it.    When Miriam reached home she immediately asked if David had come in.  Receiving an affirmative reply, she went from room to room looking for  him, and finally found him in the library. He was busy with a book on  aviation. She snatched the book from him, threw it across the room and  expressed her opinion of himself and his friends in very plain terms.  Without a word David picked up his book and walked out of the library,  leaving her in full possession of the field.          CHAPTER V    ON THE EVE OF BATTLE      But little time remained before the first basketball game of the series  between the sophomores and juniors. Both teams had been untiring in their  practice. There had been no further altercations between them as to the  use of the gymnasium, for the juniors, fearing the wrath of Miss Thompson,  were more circumspect in their behavior, and let the sophomore team  strictly alone.    \"They are liable to break out at any"]]]
