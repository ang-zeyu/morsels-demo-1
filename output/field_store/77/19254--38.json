With such narrow orifices it is clear that any small solid  particles which may find their way into the spray injector along with the  petroleum will foul the nozzle and check the fire. Hence in many of the  steamboats on the Caspian Sea, although a single spray injector suffices  for one furnace, two are used, in order that when one gets fouled the  other may still work; but, of course, the fouled orifices require  incessant cleaning out.    _Locomotives._--In arranging a locomotive for burning petroleum, several  details are required to be added in order to render the application  convenient. In the first place, for getting up steam to begin with, a gas  pipe of 1 inch internal diameter is fixed along the outside of the boiler,  and at about the middle of its length it is fitted with a three-way cock  having a screw nipple and cap. The front end of the longitudinal pipe is  connected to the blower in the chimney, and the back end is attached to  the spray injector. Then by connecting to the nipple a pipe from a  shunting locomotive under steam, the spray jet is immediately started by  the borrowed steam, by which at the same time a draught is also maintained  in the chimney. In a fully equipped engine shed the borrowed steam would  be obtained from a fixed boiler conveniently placed and specially arranged  for the purpose of raising steam. In practice steam can be raised from  cold water to 3 atm. pressure--45 lb. per square inch--in twenty minutes.  The use of auxiliary steam is then dispensed with, and the spray jet is  worked by steam from its own boiler; a pressure of 8 atm.--120 lb.--is  thus obtained in fifty to fifty-five minutes from the time the spray jet  was first started. In daily practice, when it is only necessary to raise  steam in boilers already full of hot water, the full pressure of 7 to 8  atm. is obtained in from twenty to twenty-five minutes. While  experimenting with liquid fuel for locomotives, a separate tank was placed  on the tender for carrying the petroleum, having a capacity of about 3  tons. But to have a separate tank on the tender, even though fixed in  place, would be a source of danger from the possibility of its moving  forward in case of collision. It was therefore decided, as soon as  petroleum firing was permanently introduced, to place the tank for fuel in  the tender between the two side compartments of the water tank, utilizing  the original coal space. For a six-wheeled locomotive the capacity of the  tank is 3-1/2 tons of oil--a quantity sufficient for 250 miles, with a  train of 480 tons gross exclusive of engine and tender. In charging the  tender tank with petroleum, it is of great importance to have strainers of  wire cloth in the manhole of two different meshes, the outer one having  openings, say, of 1/4 in., the inner, say 1/8 in.; these strainers are  occasionally taken out and cleaned. If care be taken to prevent any solid  particles from entering with the petroleum, no fouling of the spray  injector is likely to occur; and even if an obstruction should arise, the  obstacle being of small size can easily be blown through by screwing back  the steam cone in the spray injector far enough to let the solid particles  pass and be blown out into the fire-box by the steam. This expedient is  easily resorted to even when running; and no more inconvenience arises  than an extra puff of dense smoke for a moment, in consequence of the  sudden admission of too much fuel. Besides the two strainers in the  manhole of the petroleum tank on the tender, there should be another  strainer at the outlet valve inside the tank, having a mesh of 1/3 in.  holes.    _Driving locomotives._--In lighting up, certain precise rules have to be  followed, in order to prevent explosion of any gas that may have  accumulated in the fire box. Such explosions do often take place through  negligence; but they amount simply to a puff of gas, driving smoke out  through the ash-pan dampers, without any disagreeably loud report. This is  all prevented by adhering to the following simple rules: First clear the  spray nozzle of water by letting a small quantity of steam blow through,  with the ash-pan doors open; at the same time start the blower in the  chimney for a few seconds, and the gas, if any, will be immediately drawn  up the chimney. Next place on the bottom of the combustion chamber a piece  of cotton waste, or a handful of shavings saturated with petroleum and  burning with a flame. Then by opening first the steam valve of the spray  injector, and next the petroleum valve gently, the very first spray of oil  coming on the flaming waste immediately ignites without any explosion  whatever; after which the quantity of fuel can be increased at pleasure.  By looking at the top of the chimney, the supply of petroleum can be  regulated by observing the smoke. The general rule is to allow a  transparent light smoke to escape, thus showing that neither too much air  is being admitted nor too little. The combustion is quite under the  control of the driver, and the regulation can be so effected as to prevent  smoke altogether. While running, it is indispensable that the driver and  fireman should act together, the latter having at his side of the engine  the four handles for regulating the fire, namely, the steam wheel and the  petroleum wheel for the spray injector, and the two ash-pan door handles  in which there are notches for regulating the air admission. Each  alteration in the position of the reversing lever or screw, as well as in  the degree of opening of the steam regulator or the blast pipe, requires a  corresponding alteration of the fire. Generally the driver generally  passes the word when he intends shutting off steam, so that the alteration  in the firing can be effected before the steam is actually shut off; and  in this way the regulation of the fire and that of the steam are virtually  done together. All this care is necessary to prevent smoke, which is  nothing less than a waste of fuel. When, for instance, the train arrives  at the top of a bank, which it has to go down with the brakes on, exactly  at the moment of the driver shutting off the steam and shifting the  reversing lever into full forward gear, the petroleum and steam are shut  off from the spray injector, the ash-pan doors are closed, and if the  incline be a long one, the revolving iron damper over the chimney top is  moved into position, closing the chimney, though not hermetically. The  accumulated heat is thereby retained in the fire-box; and the steam even  rises in pressure, from the action of the accumulated heat alone. As soon  as the train reaches the bottom of the incline and steam is again  required, the first thing done is to uncover the chimney top; then the  steam is turned on to the spray injector, and next a small quantity of  petroleum is admitted, but without opening the ash-pan doors, a small fire  being rendered possible by the entrance of air around the spray injector,  as well as by possible leakage past the ash-pan doors. The spray  immediately coming in contact with the hot chamber ignites without any  audible explosion; and the ash-pan doors are finally opened, when  considerable power is required, or when the air otherwise admitted is not  sufficient to support complete combustion. By looking at the fire through  the sight hole it can always be seen at night whether the fire is white or  dusky; in fact, with altogether inexperienced men it was found that after  a few trips they could become quite expert in firing with petroleum. The  better men contrive to burn less fuel than others, simply by greater care  in attending to all the points essential to success. At present  seventy-two locomotives are running with petroleum firing; ten of them are  passenger engines, seventeen are eight-wheel coupled goods engines, and  forty-five are six-wheel coupled. As might be expected, several points  have arisen which must be dealt with in order to insure success. For  instance, the distance ring between the plates around the firing door is  apt to leak, in consequence of the intense heat driven against it, and the  absence of water circulation; it is therefore either protected by having  the brick arch built up against it, or, better still, it is taken out  altogether when the engines are in for repairs, and a flange joint is  substituted, similar to what is now used in the engines of the London and  Northwestern Railway. This arrangement gives better results, and occasions  no trouble whatever.    _Storage of petroleum._--The length of line now worked with petroleum is  from Tsaritsin to Burnack, 291 miles. There is a main iron reservoir for  petroleum at each of the four engine sheds, namely at Tsaritsin, Archeda,  Filonoff, and Borisoglebsk. Each reservoir is 66 ft. internal diameter and  24 ft. high, and when full holds about 2,050 tons. The method of charging  the reservoir, which stands a good way from the line, and is situated at a  convenient distance from all dwelling houses and buildings, is as follows:  On a siding specially prepared for the purpose are placed ten cistern cars  full of oil, the capacity of each being about ten tons. From each of these  cars a connection is made by a flexible India rubber pipe to one of ten  stand pipes which project 1 ft. above the ground line. Parallel with the  rails is laid a main pipe, with which the ten stand pipes are all  connected, thus forming one general suction main. About the middle of the  length of the main, which is laid underground and covered with sawdust or  other non-conducting material, is fixed a Blake steam pump. As soon as all  the ten connections are made with the cistern cars, the pump is set to  work, and in about one hour the whole of the cars are discharged into the  main reservoir, the time depending of course upon the capacity of the  pump.

Algeria depends on hydrocarbons for nearly all of its  export receipts, about 30% of government revenues, and nearly 25%  of GDP. In 1973-74 the sharp increase in oil prices led to a booming economy  that helped to finance an ambitious program of industrialization. Plunging oil  and gas prices, combined with the mismanagement of Algeria's highly centralized  economy, have brought the nation to its most serious social and economic crisis  since independence. The government has promised far-reaching reforms, including  giving public sector companies more autonomy, encouraging private-sector  activity, boosting gas and nonhydrocarbon exports, and a major overhaul  of the banking and financial systems. In 1988 the government started to  implement a new economic policy to dismantle large state farms into  privately operated units.
