Whence else should so much misery come? It is  still a great mercy that the earth bears and supports us.    Therefore, above all things, our young people should have this  commandment earnestly enforced upon them, and they should be trained to  hold this and the First Commandment in high regard; and whenever they  transgress, we must at once be after them with the rod and hold the  commandment before them, and constantly inculcate it, so as to bring  them up not only with punishment, but also in the reverence and fear of  God.    Thus you now understand what. it is to take God's name in vain, that is  (to recapitulate briefly), either simply for purposes of falsehood, and  to allege God's name for something that is not so, or to curse, swear,  conjure, and, in short, to practice whatever wickedness one may.  Besides this you must also know how to use the name [of God] aright.  For when saying: Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God, in  vain, He gives us to understand at the same time that it is to be used  properly. For it has been revealed and given to us for the very purpose  that it may be of constant use and profit. Hence it is a natural  inference, since using the holy name for falsehood or wickedness is  here forbidden, that we are, on the other hand, commanded to employ it  for truth and for all good, as when one swears truly where there is  need and it is demanded. So also when there is right teaching, and when  the name is invoked in trouble or praised and thanked in prosperity  etc.; all of which is comprehended summarily and commanded in the  passage Ps. 50, 15: Call upon Me in the days of trouble; I will deliver  thee, and thou shalt glorify Me. For all this is bringing 't into the  service of truth, and using it in a blessed way, and thus His name is  hallowed, as we pray in the Lord's Prayer.    Thus you have the sum of the entire commandment explained. And with  this understanding the question with which many teachers have troubled  themselves has been easily solved, to wit, why swearing is prohibited  in the Gospel, and yet Christ, St. Paul, and other saints often swore.  The explanation is briefly this: We are not to swear in support of  evil, that is, of falsehood, and where there is no need or use; but for  the support of good and the advantage of our neighbor we should swear.  For it is a truly good work, by which God is praised, truth and right  are established, falsehood is refuted, peace is made among men,  obedience is rendered, and quarrels are settled. For in this way God  Himself interposes and separates between right and wrong, good and  evil. If one part swears falsely, he has his sentence that he shall not  escape punishment, ad though it be deferred a long time, he shall not  succeed; that all that he may gain thereby will slip out of his hands,  and he will never enjoy it; as I have seen in the case of many who  perjured themselves in their marriage-vows, that they have never had a  happy hour or a healthful day, and thus perished miserably in body,  soul, and possessions.    Therefore I advise and exhort as before that by means of warning and  threatening, restraint and punishment, the children be trained betimes  to shun falsehood, and especially to avoid the use of God's name in its  support. For where they are allowed to do as they please, no good will  result, as is even now evident that the world is worse than it has ever  been and that there is no government, no obedience, no fidelity, no  faith, but only daring, unbridled men, whom no teaching or reproof  helps; all of which is God's wrath and punishment for such wanton  contempt of this commandment.    On the other hand, they should be constantly urged and incited to  honor God's name, and to have it always upon their lips in everything  that may happen to them or come to their notice: For that is the true  honor of His Name, to look to it and implore it for all consolation, so  that (as we have heard above) first the heart by faith gives God the  honor due Him, and afterwards the lips by confession.    This is also a blessed and useful habit and very effectual against the  devil, who is ever about us, and lies in wait to bring us into sin and  shame, calamity and trouble, but who is very loath to hear God's name,  and cannot remain long where it is uttered and called upon from the  heart. And, indeed, many a terrible and shocking calamity would befall  us if, by our calling upon His name, God did not preserve us. I have  myself tried it, and learned by experience that often sudden great  calamity was immediately averted and removed during such invocation. To  vex the devil, I say, we should always have this holy name in our  mouth, so that he may not be able to injure us as he wishes.    For this end it is also of service that we form the habit of daily  commending ourselves to God, with soul and body, wife, children,  servants, and all that we have, against every need that may occur;  whence also the blessing and thanksgiving at meals, and other prayers,  morning and evening, have originated and remain in use. Likewise the  practices of children to cross themselves when anything monstrous or  terrible is seen or heard, and to exclaim: \"Lord God, protect us!\"  \"Help, dear Lord Jesus!\" etc. Thus, too, if any one meets with  unexpected good fortune, however trivial, that he say: \"God be praised  and thanked; this God has bestowed on me!\" etc., as formerly the  children were accustomed to fast and pray to St. Nicholas and other  saints. This would be more pleasing and acceptable to God than all  monasticism and Carthusian sanctity.    Behold, thus we might train our youth in a childlike way and playfully  in the fear and honor of God, so that the First and Second Commandments  might be well observed and in constant practice. Then some good might  take root, spring up and bear fruit, and men grow up whom an entire  land might relish and enjoy. Moreover, this would be the true way to  bring Up children well as long as they can become trained with kindness  and delight. For what must be enforced with rods and blows only will  not develop into a good breed and at best they will remain godly under  such treatment no longer than while the rod is upon their back.    But this [manner of training] so spreads its roots in the heart that  they fear God more than rods and clubs. This I say with such  simplicity for the sake of the young, that it may penetrate their  minds. For since we are preaching to children, we must also prattle  with them. Thus we have prevented the abuse and have taught the right  use of the divine name, which should consist not only in words, but  also in practices and life, so that we may know that God is well  pleased with this and will as richly reward it as He will terribly  punish the abuse.    The Third Commandment.    Thou shalt sanctify the holy day.  [Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.]      The word holy day (Feiertag) is rendered from the Hebrew word Sabbath  which properly signifies to rest, that is, to abstain from labor. Hence  we are accustomed to say, Feierbend machen [that is, to cease working],  or heiligen Abend geben [sanctify the Sabbath]. Now, in the Old  Testament, God separated the seventh day, and appointed it for rest,  and commanded that it should be regarded as holy above all others. As  regards this external observance, this commandment was given to the  Jews alone, that they should abstain from toilsome work, and rest, so  that both man and beast might recuperate, and not be weakened by  unremitting labor. Although they afterwards restricted this too  closely, and grossly abused it, so that they traduced and could not  endure in Christ those works which they themselves were accustomed to  do on that day, as we read in the Gospel just as though the commandment  were fulfilled by doing no external [manual] work whatever, which,  however, was not the meaning, but, as we shall hear, that they sanctify  the holy day or day of rest.    This commandment, therefore, according to its gross sense, does not  concern us Christians; for it is altogether an external matter, like  other ordinances of the Old Testament, which were attached to  particular customs, persons, times, and places, and now have been made  free through Christ. But to grasp a Christian meaning for the simple as  to what God requires in this commandment, note that we keep holy days  not for the sake of intelligent and learned Christians (for they have  no need of it [holy days]), but first of all for bodily causes and  necessities, which nature teaches and requires; for the common people,  man-servants and maid-servants, who have been attending to their work  and trade the whole week, that for a day they may retire in order to  rest and be refreshed.    Secondly, and most especially, that on such day of rest (since we can  get no other opportunity) freedom and time be taken to attend divine  service, so that we come together to hear and treat of God's and then  to praise God, to sing and pray.    However, this, I say, is not so restricted to any time, as with the  Jews, that it must be just on this or that day; for in itself no one  day is better than another; but this should indeed be done daily;  however, since the masses cannot give such attendance, there must be at  least one day in the week set apart. But since from of old Sunday [the  Lord's Day] has been appointed for this purpose, we also should  continue the same, in order that everything be done in harmonious  order, and no one create disorder by unnecessary innovation.    Therefore this is the simple meaning of the commandment: since  holidays are observed anyhow, such observance should be devoted to  hearing God's Word, so that the special function of this day should be  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17221"],[0,"History of the Plague in London (#5)"],[1,"arguments my brother changed my resolutions again, and I  began to resolve to go, and accordingly made all things ready; for, in  short, the infection increased round me, and the bills were risen to  almost seven hundred a week, and my brother told me he would venture to  stay no longer. I desired him to let me consider of it but till the next  day, and I would resolve; and as I had already prepared everything as  well as I could, as to my business and who[29] to intrust my affairs  with, I had little to do but to resolve.    I went home that evening greatly oppressed in my mind, irresolute, and  not knowing what to do. I had set the evening wholly apart to consider  seriously about it, and was all alone; for already people had, as it  were by a general consent, taken up the custom of not going out of doors  after sunset: the reasons I shall have occasion to say more of by and  by.    In the retirement of this evening I endeavored to resolve first what was  my duty to do, and I stated the arguments with which my brother had  pressed me to go into the country, and I set against them the strong  impressions which I had on my mind for staying,--the visible call I  seemed to have from the particular circumstance of my calling, and the  care due from me for the preservation of my effects, which were, as I  might say, my estate; also the intimations which I thought I had from  Heaven, that to me signified a kind of direction to venture; and it  occurred to me, that, if I had what I call a direction to stay, I ought  to suppose it contained a promise of being preserved, if I obeyed.    This lay close to me;[30] and my mind seemed more and more encouraged to  stay than ever, and supported with a secret satisfaction that I should  be kept.[31] Add to this, that turning over the Bible which lay before  me, and while my thoughts were more than ordinary serious upon the  question, I cried out, \"Well, I know not what to do, Lord direct me!\"  and the like. And at that juncture I happened to stop turning over the  book at the Ninety-first Psalm, and, casting my eye on the second verse,  I read to the seventh verse exclusive, and after that included the  tenth, as follows: \"I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my  fortress: my God; in him will I trust. Surely he shall deliver thee from  the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover  thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth  shall be thy shield and buckler. Thou shalt not be afraid for the  terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day; nor for the  pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that  wasteth at noonday. A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand  at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee. Only with thine eyes  shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked. Because thou hast  made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the Most High, thy habitation;  there shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy  dwelling,\" etc.    I scarce need tell the reader that from that moment I resolved that I  would stay in the town, and, casting myself entirely upon the goodness  and protection of the Almighty, would not seek any other shelter  whatever; and that as my times were in his hands,[32] he was as able to  keep me in a time of the infection as in a time of health; and if he did  not think fit to deliver me, still I was in his hands, and it was meet  he should do with me as should seem good to him.    With this resolution I went to bed; and I was further confirmed in it  the next day by the woman being taken ill with whom I had intended to  intrust my house and all my affairs. But I had a further obligation laid  on me on the same side: for the next day I found myself very much out of  order also; so that, if I would have gone away, I could not. And I  continued ill three or four days, and this entirely determined my stay:  so I took my leave of my brother, who went away to Dorking in  Surrey,[33] and afterwards fetched around farther into Buckinghamshire  or Bedfordshire, to a retreat he had found out there for his family.    It was a very ill time to be sick in; for if any one complained, it was  immediately said he had the plague; and though I had, indeed, no  symptoms of that distemper, yet, being very ill both in my head and in  my stomach, I was not without apprehension that I really was infected.  But in about three days I grew better. The third night I rested well,  sweated a little, and was much refreshed. The apprehensions of its  being the infection went also quite away with my illness, and I went  about my business as usual.    These things, however, put off all my thoughts of going into the  country; and my brother also being gone, I had no more debate either  with him or with myself on that subject.    It was now mid-July; and the plague, which had chiefly raged at the  other end of the town, and, as I said before, in the parishes of St.  Giles's, St. Andrew's, Holborn, and towards Westminster, began now to  come eastward, towards the part where I lived. It was to be observed,  indeed, that it did not come straight on towards us; for the city, that  is to say within the walls, was indifferent healthy still. Nor was it  got then very much over the water into Southwark; for though there died  that week twelve hundred and sixty-eight of all distempers, whereof it  might be supposed above nine hundred died of the plague, yet there was  but twenty-eight in the whole city, within the walls, and but nineteen  in Southwark, Lambeth Parish included; whereas in the parishes of St.  Giles and St. Martin's-in-the-Fields alone, there died four hundred and  twenty-one.    But we perceived the infection kept chiefly in the outparishes, which  being very populous and fuller also of poor, the distemper found more to  prey upon than in the city, as I shall observe afterwards. We perceived,  I say, the distemper to draw our way, viz., by the parishes of  Clerkenwell, Cripplegate, Shoreditch, and Bishopsgate; which last two  parishes joining to Aldgate, Whitechapel, and Stepney, the infection  came at length to spread its utmost rage and violence in those parts,  even when it abated at the western parishes where it began.    It was very strange to observe that in this particular week (from the  4th to the 11th of July), when, as I have observed, there died near four  hundred of the plague in the two parishes of St. Martin's and St.  Giles-in-the-Fields[34] only, there died in the parish of Aldgate but  four, in the parish of Whitechapel three, in the parish of Stepney but  one.    Likewise in the next week (from the 11th of July to the 18th), when the  week's bill was seventeen hundred and sixty-one, yet there died no more  of the plague, on the whole Southwark side of the water, than sixteen.    But this face of things soon changed, and it began to thicken in  Cripplegate Parish especially, and in Clerkenwell; so that by the second  week in August, Cripplegate Parish alone buried eight hundred and  eighty-six, and Clerkenwell one hundred and fifty-five. Of the first,  eight hundred and fifty might well be reckoned to die of the plague; and  of the last, the bill itself said one hundred and forty-five were of the  plague.    During the month of July, and while, as I have observed, our part of the  town seemed to be spared in comparison of the west part, I went  ordinarily about the streets as my business required, and particularly  went generally once in a day, or in two days, into the city, to my  brother's house, which he had given me charge of, and to see it was  safe; and having the key in my pocket, I used to go into the house, and  over most of the rooms, to see that all was well. For though it be  something wonderful to tell that any should have hearts so hardened, in  the midst of such a calamity, as to rob and steal, yet certain it is  that all sorts of villainies, and even levities and debaucheries, were  then practiced in the town as openly as ever: I will not say quite as  frequently, because the number of people were[35] many ways lessened.    But the city itself began now to be visited too, I mean within the  walls. But the number of people there were[35] indeed extremely lessened  by so great a multitude having been gone into the country; and even all  this month of July they continued to flee, though not in such multitudes  as formerly. In August, indeed, they fled in such a manner, that I began  to think there would be really none but magistrates and servants left in  the city.    As they fled now out of the city, so I should observe that the  court[36] removed early, viz., in the month of June, and went to  Oxford, where it pleased God to preserve them; and the distemper did  not, as I heard of, so much as touch them; for which I cannot say that I  ever saw they showed any great token of thankfulness, and hardly  anything of reformation, though they did not want being told that their  crying vices might, without breach of charity, be said to have gone far  in bringing that terrible judgment upon the whole nation.    The face of London was now, indeed, strangely altered: I mean the whole  mass of buildings, city, liberties, suburbs, Westminster, Southwark, and  altogether; for as to the particular part called the city, or within the  walls, that was not yet much infected. But in the whole, the face of  things, I say, was much altered. Sorrow and sadness sat upon every face,  and though some part were not yet overwhelmed, yet all looked deeply  concerned; and as we saw it apparently coming on, so every one looked on  himself and his family as in the utmost danger. Were it possible to  represent those times exactly to those that did not see them, and give  the reader due ideas of the horror that everywhere presented itself, it  must make just impressions upon their minds, and fill them with  surprise. London might well be said to be "]]]
