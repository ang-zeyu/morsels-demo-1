[Illustration: Fig. 49.--_La Galliarde_.  From the \"Orchesographie\" of Thoinot Arbeau (Jean Tabourot), Langres,  1588.]    Desirable, therefore, as good manners and such like are, they do not  fulfil all the requirements that the worthy Canon wished to be  involved by them.    [Footnote: The advice which he gives is valuable  from its bearing on the customs of the 16th century. It even has great  historical value, indicating the influence dancing has had on good  manners. That the history of dancing is the history of manners may be  too much insisted upon. For these reasons we insert these little known  passages. The first has reference to the right way of proceeding at a  ball.       \"Having entered the place where the company is gathered for the     dance, choose a good young lady (honneste damoiselle) and raising     your hat or bonnet with your right hand you will conduct her to     the ball with your left. She, wise and well trained, will tender     her left and rise to follow you. Then in the sight of all you     conduct her to the end of the room, and you will request the     players of instruments to strike up a 'basse danse'; because     otherwise through inadvertance they might strike up some other     kind of dance. And when they commence to play you must commence     to dance. And be careful, that they understand, in your asking     for a 'basse danse,' you desire a regular and usual one.     Nevertheless, if the air of one song on which the 'basse danse'     is formed pleases you more than another you can give the     beginning of the strain to them.\"       \"_Capriol_:--If the lady refuses, I shall feel very ashamed.       \"_Arbeau_:--A well-trained lady never refuses him who so honours     her as to lead her to the dance.       \"_Capriol_:--I think so too, but in the meantime the shame of the     refusal remains with me.       \"_Arbeau_:--If you feel sure of another lady's graciousness, take     her and leave aside this graceless one, asking her to excuse you     for having been importunate; nevertheless, there are those who     would not bear it so patiently. But it is better to speak thus     than with bitterness, because in so doing you acquire a     reputation for being gentle and humane, and to her will fall the     character of a 'glorieuse' unworthy of the attention paid her.\"       \"When the instrument player has ceased\" continues our good Canon     \"make a deep bow by way of taking leave of the young lady and     conduct her gently to the place whence you took her, whilst     thanking her for the honour she has done you.\" Another extract is     not wanting in flavour: \"Hold the head and body straight, have a     countenance of assurance, spit and cough little, and if necessity     compels you, turn your face the other side and use a beautiful     white handkerchief. Talk graciously, in gentle and honest speech,     neither letting your hands hang as if dead or too full of     gesticulation. Be dressed cleanly and neatly 'avec la chausse     bien tiree et Pescarpin propre.'       \"And bear in mind these particulars.\"  ]    We have have seen from the fourteenth century (figs. 35 C, 36 A, 46)  how common the bagpipe was in out-of-door dances; in the illustrations  from Duerer (fig. 46) and in fig. 53 from Holtzer it has developed, and  has two accessory pipes, besides that played by the mouth, and the  player is accompanied by a sort of clarionet. This also appears to be  the only accompaniment of the Trio (fig. 58).  [Illustration: Fig.  50.--Morris dancers. From a window that was in the possession of  George Tollett, Esq., Birtley, Staffordshire, 16th century.]    [Illustration: Fig. 51.--Court dance. From a drawing by Callot, 1635  A.D.]    In the sixteenth century certain Spanish dances were introduced into  France, such as la Pavane, which was accompanied by hautboys and  sackbuts.    [Illustration: Fig. 52.--Comic dancers. By Callot, from the act  entitled \"Balli di Sfessama,\" 1609 A.D.]    [Illustration: Fig. 53.--Country dance.

From August de l'Aubin.]    [Illustration: Fig. 55.--A dance in the 18th century. From a painting  by Hogarth.]    There were, however, various other dances of a number too  considerable to describe here, also introduced. The dance of the  eighteenth century from Derby ware (fig. 59) seems to be but a  continuation in action of those of the sixteenth century, as  out-of-door performances.    [Illustration: Fig. 56.--Caricature of a dancing master. Hogarth.]    We have now arrived at the modern style of ball, so beloved by many of  the French Monarchs. Henry IV. and Napoleon were fond of giving these  in grand style, and in some sort of grand style they persist even as a  great social function to our own time. The Court balls of Louis XIII.  and XIV. at Versailles were really gorgeous ballets, and their  grandeur was astonishing; this custom was continued under the  succeeding monarchs. An illustration of one in the eighteenth century  by August de l'Aubin (fig. 54) sufficiently shows their character.  There is nothing new in the postures illustrated, which may have  originated thousands of years ago. As illustrating the popular ball of  the period, the design by Hogarth (fig. 55) is an excellent contrast.  The _contredanse_ represented was originally the old country dance  exported to France and returned with certain arrangements added. This  is a topic we need not pursue farther, as almost every reader knows  what social dancing now is.    [Illustration: Fig. 57.--Spring dancing away from winter.

Close of the 18th century. From  Derby ware.]    [Illustration: Fig. 60.--Spanish dance in the Hall of Saragoza, 19th  century.]          CHAPTER VI.      THE MODERN THEATRE DANCE.    Although the theatrical ballet dance is comparatively modern, the  elements of its formation are of the greatest antiquity; the chorus of  dancers and the performances of the men in the Egyptian chapters  represent without much doubt public dancing performances. We get  singing, dancing, mimicry and pantomime in the early stages of Greek  art, and the development of the dance rhythm in music is equally  ancient.    The Alexandrine Pantomime, introduced into Rome about 30 B.C. by  Bathillus and Pylades, appears to have been an entertainment  approaching the ballet.    In the middle ages there were the mysteries and \"masks\"; the latter  were frequent in England, and are introduced by Shakespere in \"Henry  VIII.\"    In Italy there appears to have been a kind of ballet in the 14th  century, and from Italy, under the influence of Catharine de' Medici,  came the ballet. Balthasar di Beaujoyeulx produced the first recorded  ballet in France, in the Italian style, in 1582. This was, however,  essentially a Court ballet.    The theatre ballet apparently arose out of these Court ballets. Henry  III. and Henry IV., the latter especially, were very fond of these  entertainments, and many Italians were brought to France to assist in  them. Pompeo Diabono, a Savoyard, was brought to Paris in 1554 to  regulate the Court ballets. At a later date came Rinuccini, the poet,  a Florentine, as was probably Caccini, the musician. They had composed  and produced the little operetta of \"Daphne,\" which had been performed  in Florence in 1597. Under these last-mentioned masters the ballet in  France took somewhat of its present form. This passion for Court  ballets continued under Louis XIII. and Louis XIV.    [Illustration: Fig. 61.--Mlle. de Camargo. After a painting by  Lancret, about 1740 A.D.]    Louis XIII. as a youth danced in one of the ballets at St. Germain, it  is said at the desire of Richelieu, who was an expert in spectacle. It  appears that he was encouraged in these amusements to remedy fits of  melancholy.    Louis XIV., at seven, danced in a masquerade, and afterwards not only  danced in the ballet of \"Cassandra,\" in 1651, but did all he could to  raise the condition of the dance and encourage dancing and music. His  influence, combined with that of Cardinal Richelieu, raised the  ballet from gross and trivial styles to a dignity worthy of music,  poetry and dancing. His uncle, Gaston of Orleans, still patronized the  grosser style, but it became eclipsed by the better. Lulli composed  music to the words of Moliere and other celebrities; amongst notable  works then produced was the \"Andromeda\" of Corneille, a tragedy, with  hymns and dances, executed in 1650, at the Petit Bourbon.    [Illustration: Fig. 62.--Pauline Duvernay at Covent Garden,  1833-1838.]    The foundation of the theatrical ballet was, however, at the  instigation of Mazarin, to prevent a lowering of tone in the  establishment of the _Academie de Danse_ under thirteen Academicians  in 1661. This appears to have been merged into the _Academie Royale de  Musique et de Danse_ in 1669, which provided a proper training for  debutants, under MM. Perrin and Cambert, whilst Beauchamp, the master  of the Court ballets, had charge of the dancing. The first  opera-ballet, the \"Pomona\" of Perrin and Cambert, was produced in  1671. To this succeeded many works of Lulli, to whom is attributed the  increased speed in dance music and dancing, that of the Court ballets  having been slow and stately.    [Illustration: Fig. 63.--Mlle. Fanny Ellsler. From a lithograph by A.  Lacaucbie.]    The great production of the period appears to have been the \"Triumph  of Love\" in 1681, with twenty scenes and seven hundred performers;  amongst these were many of the nobility, and some excellent  _ballerine_, such as Pesaut,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/173"],[0,"The Insidious Dr. Fu Manchu (#5)"],[1," to suppose that his cry was not 'The red  hand!' but 'The red ANT!'  Petrie, to think that I failed, by less than  an hour, to save him from such an end!\"        CHAPTER IV      \"THE body of a lascar, dressed in the manner usual on the P. & O.  boats, was recovered from the Thames off Tilbury by the river police at  six A.M. this morning.  It is supposed that the man met with an  accident in leaving his ship.\"    Nayland Smith passed me the evening paper and pointed to the above  paragraph.    \"For 'lascar' read 'dacoit,'\" he said.  \"Our visitor, who came by way  of the ivy, fortunately for us, failed to follow his instructions.  Also, he lost the centipede and left a clew behind him.  Dr. Fu-Manchu  does not overlook such lapses.\"    It was a sidelight upon the character of the awful being with whom we  had to deal.  My very soul recoiled from bare consideration of the fate  that would be ours if ever we fell into his hands.    The telephone bell rang.  I went out and found that Inspector Weymouth  of New Scotland Yard had called us up.    \"Will Mr. Nayland Smith please come to the Wapping River Police Station  at once,\" was the message.    Peaceful interludes were few enough throughout that wild pursuit.    \"It is certainly something important,\" said my friend; \"and, if  Fu-Manchu is at the bottom of it--as we must presume him to  be--probably something ghastly.\"    A brief survey of the time-tables showed us that there were no trains  to serve our haste.  We accordingly chartered a cab and proceeded east.    Smith, throughout the journey, talked entertainingly about his work in  Burma.  Of intent, I think, he avoided any reference to the  circumstances which first had brought him in contact with the sinister  genius of the Yellow Movement.  His talk was rather of the sunshine of  the East than of its shadows.    But the drive concluded--and all too soon.  In a silence which neither  of us seemed disposed to break, we entered the police depot, and  followed an officer who received us into the room where Weymouth waited.    The inspector greeted us briefly, nodding toward the table.    \"Poor Cadby, the most promising lad at the Yard,\" he said; and his  usually gruff voice had softened strangely.    Smith struck his right fist into the palm of his left hand and swore  under his breath, striding up and down the neat little room.  No one  spoke for a moment, and in the silence I could hear the whispering of  the Thames outside--of the Thames which had so many strange secrets to  tell, and now was burdened with another.    The body lay prone upon the deal table--this latest of the river's  dead--dressed in rough sailor garb, and, to all outward seeming, a  seaman of nondescript nationality--such as is no stranger in Wapping  and Shadwell.  His dark, curly hair clung clammily about the brown  forehead; his skin was stained, they told me.  He wore a gold ring in  one ear, and three fingers of the left hand were missing.    \"It was almost the same with Mason.\"  The river police inspector was  speaking.  \"A week ago, on a Wednesday, he went off in his own time on  some funny business down St. George's way--and Thursday night the  ten-o'clock boat got the grapnel on him off Hanover Hole.  His first  two fingers on the right hand were clean gone, and his left hand was  mutilated frightfully.\"    He paused and glanced at Smith.    \"That lascar, too,\" he continued, \"that you came down to see, sir; you  remember his hands?\"    Smith nodded.    \"He was not a lascar,\" he said shortly.  \"He was a dacoit.\"    Silence fell again.    I turned to the array of objects lying on the table--those which had  been found in Cadby's clothing.  None of them were noteworthy, except  that which had been found thrust into the loose neck of his shirt.  This last it was which had led the police to send for Nayland Smith,  for it constituted the first clew which had come to light pointing to  the authors of these mysterious tragedies.    It was a Chinese pigtail.  That alone was sufficiently remarkable; but  it was rendered more so by the fact that the plaited queue was a false  one being attached to a most ingenious bald wig.    \"You're sure it wasn't part of a Chinese make-up?\" questioned Weymouth,  his eye on the strange relic.  \"Cadby was clever at disguise.\"    Smith snatched the wig from my hands with a certain irritation, and  tried to fit it on the dead detective.    \"Too small by inches!\" he jerked.  \"And look how it's padded in the  crown.  This thing was made for a most abnormal head.\"    He threw it down, and fell to pacing the room again.    \"Where did you find him--exactly?\" he asked.    \"Limehouse Reach--under Commercial Dock Pier--exactly an hour ago.\"    \"And you last saw him at eight o'clock last night?\"--to Weymouth.    \"Eight to a quarter past.\"    \"You think he has been dead nearly twenty-four hours, Petrie?\"    \"Roughly, twenty-four hours,\" I replied.    \"Then, we know that he was on the track of the Fu-Manchu group, that he  followed up some clew which led him to the neighborhood of old Ratcliff  Highway, and that he died the same night.  You are sure that is where  he was going?\"    \"Yes,\" said Weymouth; \"He was jealous of giving anything away, poor  chap; it meant a big lift for him if he pulled the case off.  But he  gave me to understand that he expected to spend last night in that  district.  He left the Yard about eight, as I've said, to go to his  rooms, and dress for the job.\"    \"Did he keep any record of his cases?\"    \"Of course!  He was most particular.  Cadby was a man with ambitions,  sir!  You'll want to see his book.  Wait while I get his address; it's  somewhere in Brixton.\"    He went to the telephone, and Inspector Ryman covered up the dead man's  face.    Nayland Smith was palpably excited.    \"He almost succeeded where we have failed, Petrie,\" he said.  \"There is  no doubt in my mind that he was hot on the track of Fu-Manchu!  Poor  Mason had probably blundered on the scent, too, and he met with a  similar fate.  Without other evidence, the fact that they both died in  the same way as the dacoit would be conclusive, for we know that  Fu-Manchu killed the dacoit!\"    \"What is the meaning of the mutilated hands, Smith?\"    \"God knows!  Cadby's death was from drowning, you say?\"    \"There are no other marks of violence.\"    \"But he was a very strong swimmer, Doctor,\" interrupted Inspector  Ryman.  \"Why, he pulled off the quarter-mile championship at the  Crystal Palace last year!  Cadby wasn't a man easy to drown.  And as  for Mason, he was an R.N.R., and like a fish in the water!\"    Smith shrugged his shoulders helplessly.    \"Let us hope that one day we shall know how they died,\" he said simply.    Weymouth returned from the telephone.    \"The address is No.--Cold Harbor Lane,\" he reported.  \"I shall not be  able to come along, but you can't miss it; it's close by the Brixton  Police Station.  There's no family, fortunately; he was quite alone in  the world.  His case-book isn't in the American desk, which you'll find  in his sitting-room; it's in the cupboard in the corner--top shelf.  Here are his keys, all intact.  I think this is the cupboard key.\"    Smith nodded.    \"Come on, Petrie,\" he said.  \"We haven't a second to waste.\"    Our cab was waiting, and in a few seconds we were speeding along  Wapping High Street.  We had gone no more than a few hundred yards, I  think, when Smith suddenly slapped his open hand down on his knee.    \"That pigtail!\" he cried.  \"I have left it behind!  We must have it,  Petrie!  Stop!  Stop!\"    The cab was pulled up, and Smith alighted.    \"Don't wait for me,\" he directed hurriedly.  \"Here, take Weymouth's  card.  Remember where he said the book was?  It's all we want.  Come  straight on to Scotland Yard and meet me there.\"    \"But Smith,\" I protested, \"a few minutes can make no difference!\"    \"Can't it!\" he snapped.  \"Do you suppose Fu-Manchu is going to leave  evidence like that lying about?  It's a thousand to one he has it  already, but there is just a bare chance.\"    It was a new aspect of the situation and one that afforded no room for  comment; and so lost in thought did I become that the cab was outside  the house for which I was bound ere I realized that we had quitted the  purlieus of Wapping.  Yet I had had leisure to review the whole troop  of events which had crowded my life since the return of Nayland Smith  from Burma.  Mentally, I had looked again upon the dead Sir Crichton  Davey, and with Smith had waited in the dark for the dreadful thing  that had killed him.  Now, with those remorseless memories jostling in  my mind, I was entering the house of Fu-Manchu's last victim, and the  shadow of that giant evil seemed to be upon it like a palpable cloud.    Cadby's old landlady greeted me with a queer mixture of fear and  embarrassment in her manner.    \"I am Dr. Petrie,\" I said, \"and I regret that I bring bad news  respecting Mr. Cadby.\"    \"Oh, sir!\" she cried.  \"Don't tell me that anything has happened to  him!\" And divining something of the mission on which I was come, for  such sad duty often falls to the lot of the medical man: \"Oh, the poor,  brave lad!\"    Indeed, I respected the dead man's memory more than ever from that  hour, since the sorrow of the worthy old soul was quite pathetic, and  spoke eloquently for the unhappy cause of it.    \"There was a terrible wailing at the back of the house last night,  Doctor, and I heard it again to-night, a second before you knocked.  Poor lad!  It was the same when his mother died.\"    At the moment I paid little attention to her words, for such beliefs  are common, unfortunately; but when she was sufficiently composed I  went on to explain what I thought necessary.  And now the old lady's  embarrassment took precedence of her sorrow, and presently the truth  came out:    \"There's a--young lady--in his rooms, sir.\"    I started.  This might mean little or might mean much.    \"She came and waited"]]]
