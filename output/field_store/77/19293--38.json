In allegorical interpretation persons are transformed into  ideas and their history into a system of philosophy. The Greek  philosophers had applied this method to Homer since the fourth century  B.C.E., in order to read into the epic poet, whose work they regarded  almost as a Divine revelation, their reflective theories of the  universe. And doubtless the Jewish philosophers were influenced by  their example.    Their allegorical treatment of the Bible was intended, not merely to  adapt it to the Greek world, but to strengthen its hold on the  Alexandrian Jews themselves. These, as they acquired Hellenic culture,  found that the Bible in its literal sense did not altogether satisfy  their conceptions. They detected in it a certain primitiveness, and  having eaten further of the tree of knowledge, they were aware of its  philosophical nakedness. It was full of anthropomorphism, and it  seemed wanting in that which the Greek world admired above all  things--a systematic theology and systematic ethics. The idea that the  words of the Bible contained some hidden meanings goes back to the  earliest Jewish tradition and is one of the bases of the oral law; but  the special characteristic of the Alexandrian exegesis is that it  searched out theories of God and life like those which the Greek  philosophers had developed. The device was necessary to secure the  allegiance of the people to the Torah. And from the need of expounding  the Bible in this way to the Jewish public at Alexandria, there arose  a new form of religious literature, the sermon, and a new form of  commentary, the homiletical. The words \"homiletical\" and \"homily\"  suggest what they originally connoted; they are derived from the Greek  word [Greek: homilia], \"an assembly,\" and a homily was a discourse  delivered to an assembly. The Meturgeman of Palestine and Babylon, who  expounded the Hebrew text in Aramaic, became the preacher of  Alexandria, who gave, in Greek, of course, homiletical expositions of  the law. In the great synagogue each Sabbath some leader in the  community would give a harangue to the assembly, starting from a  Biblical text and deducing from it or weaving into it the ideas of  Hellenic wisdom, touched by Jewish influence; for the synagogues at  Alexandria as elsewhere were the schools (_Schule_) as much as the  houses of prayer; schools, as Philo says, of \"temperance, bravery,  prudence, justice, piety, holiness, and in short of all virtues by  which things human and Divine are well ordered.\"[29] He speaks  repeatedly of the Sabbath gatherings, when the Jews would become, as  he puts it, a community of philosophers,[30] as they listened to the  exegesis of the preacher, who by allegorical and homiletical fancies  would make a verse or chapter of the Torah live again with a new  meaning to his audience. The Alexandrian Jews, though the form of  their writing was influenced by the Greeks, probably brought with them  from Palestine primitive traces of allegorism. Allegory and its  counterpart, allegorical interpretation, are deeply imbedded in the  Oriental mind, and we hear of ancient schools of symbolists in the  oldest portions of the Talmud.[31] At what period the Alexandrians  began to use allegorical interpretation for the purpose of harmonizing  Greek ideas with the Bible we do not know, but the first writer in  this style of whom we have record (though scholars consider that his  fragments are of doubtful authenticity) is Aristobulus. He is said to  have been the tutor of Ptolemy Philometor, and he must have written at  the beginning of the first century B.C.E. He dedicated to the king his  \"Exegesis of the Mosaic Law,\" which was an attempt to reveal the  teachings of the Peripatetic system, _i.e._, the philosophy of  Aristotle, within the text of the Pentateuch. All anthropomorphic  expressions are explained away allegorically, and God's activity in  the material universe is ascribed to his [Greek: Dunamis] or power,  which pervades all creation. Whether the power is independent and  treated as a separate person is not clear from the fragments that  Eusebius[32] has preserved for us. Aristobulus was only one link in a  continuous chain, though his is the only name among Philo's  predecessors that has come down to us. Philo speaks, fifteen times in  all, of explanations of allegorists who read into the Bible this or  that system of thought[33] regarding the words of the law as \"manifest  symbols of things invisible and hints of things inexpressible.\" And if  their work were before us, it is likely that Philo would appear as the  central figure of an Alexandrian Midrash gathered from many sources,  instead of the sole authority for a vast development of the Torah. We  must not regard him as a single philosophical genius who suddenly  springs up, but as the culmination of a long development, the supreme  master of an old tradition.    If the allegorical method appears now as artificial and frigid, it  must be remembered that it was one which recommended itself strongly  to the age. The great creative era of the Greek mind had passed away  with the absorption of the city-state in Alexander's empire. Then  followed the age of criticism, during which the works of the great  masters were interpreted, annotated, and compared. Next, as creative  thought became rarer, and confidence in human reason began to be  shaken, men fell back more and more for their ideas and opinions upon  some authority of the distant past, whom they regarded as an inspired  teacher. The sayings of Homer and Pythagoras were considered as  divinely revealed truths; and when treated allegorically, they were  shown to contain the philosophical tenets of the Platonic, the  Aristotelian, or the Stoic school. Thus, in the first century B.C.E.,  the Greek mind, which had earlier been devoted to the free search for  knowledge and truth, was approaching the Hebraic standpoint, which  considered that the highest truth had once for all been revealed to  mankind in inspired writings, and that the duty of later generations  was to interpret this revealed doctrine rather than search  independently for knowledge. On the other hand, the Jewish  interpreters were trying to reach the Greek standpoint when they set  themselves to show that the writers of the Bible had anticipated the  philosophers of Hellas with systems of theology, psychology, ethics,  and cosmology. Allegorism, it may be said, is the instrument by which  Greek and Hebrew thought were brought together. Its development was in  its essence a sign of intellectual vigor and religious activity; but  in the time of Philo it threatened to have one evil consequence, which  did in the end undermine the religion of the Alexandrian community.  Some who allegorized the Torah were not content with discovering a  deeper meaning beneath the law, but went on to disregard the literal  sense, _i.e._, they allegorized away the law, and held in contempt the  symbolic observance to which they had attached a spiritual meaning. On  the other hand, there was a party which adhered strictly to the  literal sense ([Greek: to hreton]) and rejected allegorism.[34] Philo  protested against these extremes and was the leader of those who were  liberal in thought and conservative in practice, and who venerated the  law both for its literal and for its allegorical sense. To effect the  true harmony between the literal and the allegorical sense of the  Torah, between the spiritual and the legal sides of Judaism, between  Greek philosophy and revealed religion--that was the great work of  Philo-Judaeus.    Though the religious and intellectual development of the Alexandrian  community proceeded on different lines from that of the main body of  the nation in Palestine, yet the connection between the two was  maintained closely for centuries. The colony, as we have noticed,  recognized whole-heartedly the spiritual headship of Jerusalem, and at  the great festivals of the year a deputation went from Alexandria to  the holy sanctuary, bearing offerings from the whole community. In  Jerusalem, on the other hand, special synagogues, where Greek was the  language,[35] were built for Alexandrian visitors. Alexandrian  artisans and craftsmen took part in the building of Herod's temple,  but were found inferior to native workmen.[36] The notices within the  building were written in Greek as well as in Aramaic, and the golden  gates to the inner court were, we are told by Josephus,[37] the gift  of Philo's brother, the head of the Alexandrian community. Some  fragments have come down to us of a poem about Jerusalem in Greek  verse by a certain Philo, who lived in the first century B.C.E., and  was perhaps an ancestor of our worthy. He glorifies the Holy City,  extols its fertility, and speaks of its ever-flowing waters beneath  the earth. His greater namesake says that wherever the Jews live they  consider Jerusalem as their metropolis. The Talmud again tells how  Judah Ben Tabbai and Joshua Ben Perahya, during the persecution of the  Pharisees by Hyreanus, fled to Alexandria, and how later Joshua Ben  Hanania[38] sojourned there and gave answers to twelve questions which  the Jews propounded to him, three of them dealing with \"the Wisdom.\"  The Talmud has frequent reference to Alexandrian Jews, and that it  makes little direct mention of the Alexandrian exegesis is explained  by the distrust of the whole Hellenistic movement, which the rise of  Christianity and the growth of Gnosticism induced in the rabbis of the  second and third centuries. They lived at a time when it had been  proved that that movement led away from Judaism, and its main tenets  had been adopted or perverted by an antagonistic creed. It was a  tragic necessity which compelled the severance between the Eastern and  Western developments of the religion.

The sociologists  of the past thought the grey matter of their own brains all-sufficing.  They forgot that flesh is pink and blood is red. That is why they  could not convert people....    \"The five-hundredth and last day of each year shall be a General  Cessation Day. It will correspond somewhat to our present Christmas  Day. But with what a difference! It will not be, as with us, a mere  opportunity for relatives to make up the quarrels they have picked  with each other during the past year, and to eat and drink things that  will make them ill well into next year. Holly and mistletoe there will  be in the Municipal Eating Rooms, but the men and women who sit down  there to General Cessation High-Tea will be glowing not with a facile  affection for their kith and kin, but with communal anxiety for the  welfare of the great-great-grand-children of people they have never  met and are never likely to meet.    \"The great event of the day will be the performance of the ceremony of  'Making Way.'    \"In the Dawn, death will not be the haphazard affair that it is under  the present anarchic conditions. Men will not be stumbling out of  the world at odd moments and for reasons over which they have no  control. There will always, of course, be a percentage of deaths by  misadventure. But there will be no deaths by disease. Nor, on the  other hand, will people die of old age. Every child will start life  knowing that (barring misadventure) he has a certain fixed period of  life before him--so much and no more, but not a moment less.    \"It is impossible to foretell to what average age the children of the  Dawn will retain the use of all their faculties--be fully vigorous  mentally and physically. We only know they will be 'going strong' at  ages when we have long ceased to be any use to the State. Let us, for  sake of argument, say that on the average their facilities will have  begun to decay at the age of ninety--a trifle over thirty-two, by the  new reckoning. That, then, will be the period of life fixed for all  citizens. Every man on fulfilling that period will avail himself of  the Municipal Lethal Chamber. He will 'make way'....    \"I thought at one time that it would be best for every man to 'make  way' on the actual day when he reaches the age-limit. But I see now  that this would savour of private enterprise. Moreover, it would rule  out that element of sentiment which, in relation to such a thing as  death, we must do nothing to mar. The children and friends of a man on  the brink of death would instinctively wish to gather round him. How  could they accompany him to the lethal chamber, if it were an ordinary  working-day, with every moment of the time mapped out for them?    \"On General Cessation Day, therefore, the gates of the lethal chambers  will stand open for all those who shall in the course of the past year  have reached the age-limit. You figure the wide streets filled all day  long with little solemn processions--solemn and yet not in the least  unhappy.... You figure the old man walking with a firm step in the  midst of his progeny, looking around him with a clear eye at this dear  world which is about to lose him. He will not be thinking of himself.  He will not be wishing the way to the lethal chamber was longer. He  will be filled with joy at the thought that he is about to die for  the good of the race--to 'make way' for the beautiful young breed  of men and women who, in simple, artistic, antiseptic garments, are  disporting themselves so gladly on this day of days. They pause  to salute him as he passes. And presently he sees, radiant in the  sunlight, the pleasant white-tiled dome of the lethal chamber. You  figure him at the gate, shaking hands all round, and speaking perhaps  a few well-chosen words about the Future....\"      Sec.5.    It was enough. The old broom hadn't lost its snap. It had swept clean  the chambers of Perkins' soul--swished away the whole accumulation of  nasty little cobwebs and malignant germs. Gone were the mean doubts  that had formed in him, the lethargy, the cheap cynicism. Perkins was  himself again.    He saw now how very stupid it was of him to have despaired just  because his own particular panacea wasn't given a chance. That  Provisional Government plan of his had been good, but it was only  one of an infinite number of possible paths to the Dawn. He would  try others--scores of others....    He must get right away out of here--to-night. He must have his car  brought round from the garage--now--to a side door....    But first he sat down to the writing-table, and wrote quickly:        _Dear Duchess,_        _I regret I am called away on urgent political business...._              _Yours faithfully_ _J. Perkins...._    He took the morocco leather case out of his pocket and enclosed it,  with the note, in a large envelope.    Then he pressed the electric button by his bedside, almost feeling  that this was a signal for the Dawn to rise without more ado....          SOME DAMNABLE ERRORS ABOUT CHRISTMAS    _By_    G.K. CH*ST*RT*N      That it is human to err is admitted by even the most positive of our  thinkers. Here we have the great difference between latter-day thought  and the thought of the past. If Euclid were alive to-day (and I dare  say he is) he would not say, \"The angles at the base of an isosceles  triangle are equal to one another.\" He would say, \"To me (a very  frail and fallible being, remember) it does somehow seem that these  two angles have a mysterious and awful equality to one another.\" The  dislike of schoolboys for Euclid is unreasonable in many ways; but  fundamentally it is entirely reasonable. Fundamentally it is the  revolt from a man who was either fallible and therefore (in pretending  to infallibility) an impostor, or infallible and therefore not human.    Now, since it is human to err, it is always in reference to those  things which arouse in us the most human of all our emotions--I mean  the emotion of love--that we conceive the deepest of our errors.  Suppose we met Euclid on Westminster Bridge, and he took us aside and  confessed to us that whilst he regarded parallelograms and rhomboids  with an indifference bordering on contempt, for isosceles triangles he  cherished a wild romantic devotion. Suppose he asked us to accompany  him to the nearest music-shop, and there purchased a guitar in order  that he might worthily sing to us the radiant beauty and the radiant  goodness of isosceles triangles. As men we should, I hope, respect his  enthusiasm, and encourage his enthusiasm, and catch his enthusiasm.  But as seekers after truth we should be compelled to regard with a  dark suspicion, and to check with the most anxious care, every fact  that he told us about isosceles triangles. For adoration involves a  glorious obliquity of vision. It involves more than that. We do not  say of Love that he is short-sighted. We do not say of Love that he  is myopic. We do not say of Love that he is astigmatic. We say quite  simply, Love is blind. We might go further and say, Love is deaf. That  would be a profound and obvious truth. We might go further still and  say, Love is dumb. But that would be a profound and obvious lie. For  love is always an extraordinarily fluent talker. Love is a wind-bag,  filled with a gusty wind from Heaven.    It is always about the thing that we love most that we talk most.  About this thing, therefore, our errors are something more than our  deepest errors: they are our most frequent errors. That is why for  nearly two thousand years mankind has been more glaringly wrong on the  subject of Christmas than on any other subject. If mankind had hated  Christmas, he would have understood it from the first. What would  have happened then, it is impossible to say. For that which is hated,  and therefore is persecuted, and therefore grows brave, lives on  for ever, whilst that which is understood dies in the moment of our  understanding of it--dies, as it were, in our awful grasp. Between  the horns of this eternal dilemma shivers all the mystery of the jolly  visible world, and of that still jollier world which is invisible.  And it is because Mr. Shaw and the writers of his school cannot, with  all their splendid sincerity and, acumen, perceive that he and they  and all of us are impaled on those horns as certainly as the sausages  I ate for breakfast this morning had been impaled on the cook's  toasting-fork--it is for this reason, I say, that Mr. Shaw and his  friends seem to me to miss the basic principle that lies at the root  of all things human and divine. By the way, not all things that are  divine are human. But all things that are human are divine. But to  return to Christmas.    I select at random two of the more obvious fallacies that obtain. One  is that Christmas should be observed as a time of jubilation. This is  (I admit) quite a recent idea. It never entered into the tousled heads  of the shepherds by night, when the light of the angel of the Lord  shone about them and they arose and went to do homage to the Child. It  never entered into the heads of the Three Wise Men. They did not bring  their gifts as a joke, but as an awful oblation. It never entered into  the heads of the saints and scholars, the poets and painters, of the  Middle Ages. Looking back across the years, they saw in that dark and  ungarnished manger only a shrinking woman, a brooding man, and a child  born to sorrow. The philomaths of the eighteenth century, looking  back, saw nothing at all. It is not the least of the glories of the  Victorian Era that it rediscovered Christmas. It is not the least of  the mistakes of the Victorian Era that it supposed Christmas to be a  feast.    The splendour of the saying, \"I have piped unto you, and you have not  danced; I have wept with you, and you have not mourned\" lies in the  fact that it might have been uttered with equal truth by any man who  had ever piped or wept."]]]
