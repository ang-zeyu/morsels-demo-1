So being then at  rest, he earnestly took in hand that which he had long thought of  before, to wit, the Lives, and tooke great pains with it until he had  brought his worke to perfection, as we have done at this present;  although that some Lives, as those of Scipio African, of Metellus  Numidicus, and some other are not to be found. Now himselfe confesseth  in some place, that when he began this worke, at the first it was but to  profit others; but that afterwards it was to profit himselfe, looking  upon those histories, as if he had looked in a glasse, and seeking to  reform his life in some sort, and to forme it in the mould of the  vertues of these great men; taking this fashion of searching their  manners, and writing the Lives of these noble men, to be a familiar  haunting and frequenting of them. Also he thought, [said he himselfe]  that he lodged these men one after another in his house, entering into  consideration of their qualities, and that which was great in either of  them, choosing and principally taking that which was to be noted, and  most worthy to be knowne in their sayings and deeds.\"[A]    [Footnote A: North's 'Plutarch,' 1631, p. 1198.]    Of Plutarch in his domestic relations we gather much information from  his own writings. The name of his father has not been preserved, but it  was probably Nikarchus, from the common habit of Greek families to  repeat a name in alternate generations. His brothers Timon and Lamprias  are frequently mentioned in his essays and dialogues, where Timon is  spoken of in the most affectionate terms. Rualdus has ingeniously  recovered the name of his wife, Timoxena, from internal evidence  afforded by his writings. A touching letter is still extant, addressed  by Plutarch to his wife, bidding her not give way to excessive grief at  the death of their only daughter, who was named Timoxena after her  mother. The number of his sons we cannot exactly state. Autobulus and  Plutarch are especially spoken of as his sons, since the treatise on the  Timaeus of Plato is dedicated to them, and the marriage of his son  Autobulus is the occasion of one of the dinner-parties recorded in the  'Table Talk.' Another person, one Soklarus, is spoken of in terms which  seem to imply that he was Plutarch's son, but this is nowhere definitely  stated. His treatise also on Marriage Questions, addressed to Eurydike  and Pollianus, seems to speak of her as having been recently an inmate  of his house, but without enabling us to form an opinion whether she was  his daughter or not. A modern writer well describes his maturer years by  the words: \"Plutarch was well born, well taught, well conditioned; a  self-respecting amiable man, who knew how to better a good education by  travels, by devotion to affairs private and public; a master of ancient  culture, he read books with a just criticism: eminently social, he was a  king in his own house, surrounded himself with select friends, and knew  the high value of good conversation; and declares in a letter written to  his wife that 'he finds scarcely an erasure, as in a book well written,  in the happiness of his life.'\"    He was an active member of the little community of Chaeronea, being  archon of that town. Whether this dignity was annual or for life we do  not know, but it was probably the former, and very likely he served it  more than once. He speaks of his devotion to the duties of his office as  causing him to incur the ridicule of some of his fellow-citizens, when  they saw him engaged in the humblest duties. \"But,\" he says, in Clough's  version, \"the story told about Antisthenes comes to my assistance. When  some one expressed surprise at his carrying home some pickled fish from  market in his own hands, _It is_, he answered, _for myself_. Conversely,  when I am reproached with standing by and watching while tiles are  measured out, and stone and mortar brought up, _This service_, I say,  _is not for myself_, it is for my country.\"    Plutarch was for many years a priest of Apollo at Delphi. The scene of  some of his 'Table Talk' is laid there, when he in his priestly capacity  gives a dinner party in honour of the victor in the poetic contest at  the Pythian games. Probably this office was a source of considerable  income, and as the journey from Chaeronea to Delphi, across Mount  Parnassus, is a very short one, it interfered but little with his  literary and municipal business. In his essay on \"Whether an old man  should continue to take part in public life,\" he says, \"You know,  Euphanes, that I have for many Pythiads (that is, periods of four years  elapsing between the Pythian festivals), exercised the office of Priest  of Apollo: yet I think you would not say to me,'Plutarch, you have  sacrificed enough; you have led processions and dances enough; it is  time, now that you are old, to lay aside the garland from your head, and  to retire as superannuated from the oracle.'\"    Thus respected and loved by all, Plutarch's old age passed peacefully  away. \"Notwithstanding,\" as North says, \"that he was very old, yet he  made an end of the Lives.... Furthermore, Plutarch, having lived alwaies  honourably even to old age, he died quietly among his children and  friends in the city of Chaeronea, leaving his writings, an immortal  savour of his name, unto posterity. Besides the honour his citizens did  him, there was a statue set up for him by ordinance of the people of  Rome, in memory of his virtues. Now furthermore, though time hath  devoured some part of the writings of this great man, and minished some  other: neverthelesse those which remaine, being a great number, have  excellent use to this day among us.\"          PLUTARCH'S LIVES.          LIFE OF THESEUS.      I. As in books on geography, Sossius Senecio, the writers crowd the  countries of which they know nothing into the furthest margins of their  maps, and write upon them legends such as, \"In this direction lie  waterless deserts full of wild beasts;\" or, \"Unexplored morasses;\" or,  \"Here it is as cold as Scythia;\" or, \"A frozen sea;\" so I, in my  writings on Parallel Lives, go through that period of time where history  rests on the firm basis of facts, and may truly say, \"All beyond this is  portentous and fabulous, inhabited by poets and mythologers, and there  is nothing true or certain.\"    When I had written the lives of Lykurgus the lawgiver and Numa the king,  it appeared to me natural to go back to Romulus also, as I was engaged  on the history of times so close to his. So when I was reflecting, in  the words of Aeschylus,        \"Against this chieftain, who can best contend?      Whom shall I match in fight, what trusty friend?\"    it occurred to me to compare the founder of the fair and famous city of  Athens with him, and to contrast Theseus with the father of unconquered  glorious Rome. Putting aside, then, the mythological element, let us  examine his story, and wherever it obstinately defies probability, and  cannot be explained by natural agency, let us beg the indulgence of our  readers, who will kindly make allowance for tales of antiquity.    II. Theseus appears to have several points of resemblance to Romulus.  Both were unacknowledged illegitimate children, and were reputed to  descend from the Gods.        \"Both warriors, well we all do know,\"    and both were wise as well as powerful. The one founded Rome, while the  other was the joint founder of Athens; and these are two of the most  famous of cities. Both carried off women by violence, and neither of  them escaped domestic misfortune and retribution, but towards the end of  their lives both were at variance with their countrymen, if we may put  any trust in the least extravagant writings upon the subject.    III. Theseus traced his descent on the father's side from Erechtheus and  the original Autochthones,[A] while on the mother's side he was  descended from Pelops. For Pelops surpassed all the other princes of the  Peloponnesus in the number of his children as well as in wealth; and of  these he gave many of his daughters in marriage to the chief men of the  country, and established many of his sons as rulers in various cities.  One of these, Pittheus, the grandfather of Theseus, founded Troezen,  which is indeed but a little state, though he had a greater reputation  than any man of his time for eloquence and wisdom. The nature of this  wisdom of his seems to have been much of the same kind as that which  made the reputation of Hesiod, in the collection of maxims known as the  'Works and Days.' One of these maxims is indeed ascribed to Pittheus:         \"Let promised pay be truly paid to friends.\"    At any rate, this is what Aristotle the philosopher has recorded; and  also Euripides, when he speaks of Hippolytus as \"child of holy  Pittheus,\" shows the prevailing opinion about Pittheus. Now Aegeus  desired to have children, and the Oracle at Delphi is said to have given  him the well-known response, forbidding him to have intercourse with any  woman before he reached Athens, but not appearing to explain this  clearly. Consequently, on his way home, he went to Troezen, and asked  the advice of Pittheus about the response of the God, which ran thus:        \"Great chief, the wine-skin's foot must closed remain,      Till thou to Athens art returned again.\"    Pittheus clearly perceived what the oracle must mean, and persuaded or  cheated Aegeus into an intrigue with Aethra. Afterwards, when he  discovered that he had conversed with the daughter of Pittheus, as he  imagined that she might prove with child, he left behind him his sword  and sandals hidden under a great stone, which had a hollow inside it  exactly fitting them. This he told to Aethra alone, and charged her if a  son of his should be born, and on growing to man's estate should be able  to lift the stone and take from under it the deposit, that she should"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14056"],[0,"The French Impressionists (1860-1900) (#5)"],[1,"and with all the metaphysics and abstractions  following in its train.    [Illustration: CLAUDE MONET    CHURCH AT VERNON]    This fact of the substitution of _character_ for _beauty_ is the  essential feature of the movement. What is called Impressionism is--let  it not be forgotten--a technique which can be applied to any subject.  Whether the subject be a virgin, or a labourer, it can be painted with  divided tones, and certain living artists, like the symbolist Henri  Martin, who has almost the ideas of a Pre-Raphaelite, have proved it by  employing this technique for the rendering of religious or philosophic  subjects. But one can only understand the effort and the faults of the  painters grouped around Manet, by constantly recalling to one's mind  their predeliction for _character_. Before Manet a distinction was made  between _noble_ subjects, and others which were relegated to the domain  of _genre_ in which no great artist was admitted to exist by the School,  the familiarity of their subjects barring from them this rank. By the  suppression of the _nobleness_ inherent to the treated subject, the  painter's technical merit is one of the first things to be considered in  giving him rank. The Realist-Impressionists painted scenes in the  ball-room, on the river, in the field, the street, the foundry, modern  interiors, and found in the life of the humble immense scope for  studying the gestures, the costumes, the expressions of the nineteenth  century.    Their effort had its bearing upon the way of representing persons, upon  what is called, in the studio language, the \"_mise en cadre_.\" There,  too, they overthrew the principles admitted by the School. Manet, and  especially Degas, have created in this respect a new style from which  the whole art of realistic contemporary illustration is derived. This  style had been hitherto totally ignored, or the artists had shrunk from  applying it. It is a style which is founded upon the small painters of  the eighteenth century, upon Saint-Aubin, Debucourt, Moreau, and,  further back, upon Pater and the Dutchmen. But this time, instead of  confining this style to vignettes and very small dimensions, the  Impressionists have boldly given it the dimensions and importance of big  canvases. They have no longer based the laws of composition, and  consequently of style, upon the ideas relative to the subjects, but upon  values and harmonies. To take a summary example: if the School composed  a picture representing the death of Agamemnon, it did not fail to  subordinate the whole composition to Agamemnon, then to Clytemnestra,  then to the witnesses of the murder, graduating the moral and literary  interest according to the different persons, and sacrificing to this  interest the colouring and the realistic qualities of the scene. The  Realists composed by picking out first the strongest \"value\" of the  picture, say a red dress, and then distributing the other values  according to a harmonious progression of their tonalities. \"The  principal person in a picture,\" said Manet, \"is the light.\" With Manet  and his friends we find, then, that the concern for expression and for  the sentiments evoked by the subject, was always subordinated to a  purely pictorial and decorative preoccupation. This has frequently led  the Impressionists to grave errors, which they have, however, generally  avoided by confining themselves to very simple subjects, for which the  daily life supplied the grouping.    [Illustration: RENOIR    PORTRAIT OF MADAME MAITRE]    One of the reforms due to their conception has been the suppression of  the professional model, and the substitution for it of the natural  model, seen in the exercise of his occupation. This is one of the most  useful conquests for the benefit of modern painting. It marks a just  return to nature and simplicity. Nearly all their figures are real  portraits; and in everything that concerns the labourer and the  peasant, they have found the proper style and character, because they  have observed these beings in the true medium of their occupations,  instead of forcing them into a sham pose and painting them in disguise.  The basis of all their pictures has been first of all a series of  landscape and figure studies made in the open air, far from the studio,  and afterwards co-ordinated. One may wish pictorial art to have higher  ambitions; and one may find in the Primitives an example of a curious  mysticism, an expression of the abstract and of dreams. But one should  not underrate the power of naive and realistic observation, which the  Primitives carried into the execution of their works, subordinating it,  however, to religious expression, and it must also be admitted that the  Realist-Impressionists served at least their conception of art logically  and homogeneously. The criticism which may be levelled against them is  that which Realism itself carries in its train, and we shall see that  esthetics could never create classifications capable of defining and  containing the infinite gradations of creative temperaments.    In art, classifications have rarely any value, and are rather damaging.  Realism and Idealism are abstract terms which cannot suffice to  characterise beings who obey their sensibility. It is therefore  necessary to invent as many words as there are remarkable men. If  Leonardo was a great painter, are Turner and Monet not painters at all?  There is no connection between them; their methods of thought and  expression are antithetical. Perhaps it will be most simple, to admire  them all, and to renounce any further definition of the painter,  adopting this word to mark the man who uses the palette as his means of  expression.    Thus preoccupation with contemporary emotions, substitution of character  for classic beauty (or of emotional beauty for formal beauty), admission  of the _genre_-painter into the first rank, composition based upon the  reciprocal reaction of values, subordination of the subject to the  interest of execution, the effort to isolate the art of painting from  the ideas inherent to that of literature, and particularly the  instinctive move towards the \"symphonisation\" of colours, and  consequently towards music,--these are the principal features of the  aesthetic code of the Realist-Impressionists, if this term may be  applied to a group of men hostile towards esthetics such as they are  generally taught.          III    EDOUARD MANET: HIS WORK, HIS INFLUENCE      As I have said, Edouard Manet has not been entirely the originator of  the Impressionist technique. It is the work of Claude Monet which  presents the most complete example of it, and which also came first as  regards date. But it is very difficult to determine such cases of  priority, and it is, after all, rather useless. A technique cannot be  invented in a day. In this case it was the result of long  investigations, in which Manet and Renoir participated, and it is  necessary to unite under the collective name of Impressionists a group  of men, tied by friendship, who made a simultaneous effort towards  originality, all in about the same spirit, though frequently in very  different ways. As in the case of the Pre-Raphaelites, it was first of  all friendship, then unjust derision, which created the solidarity of  the Impressionists. But the Pre-Raphaelites, in aiming at an idealistic  and symbolic art, were better agreed upon the intellectual principles  which permitted them at once to define a programme. The Impressionists  who were only united by their temperaments, and had made it their first  aim to break away from all school programmes, tried simply to do  something new, with frankness and freedom.    Manet was, in their midst, the personality marked out at the same time  by their admiration, and by the attacks of the critics for the post of  standard-bearer. A little older than his friends, he had already, quite  alone, raised heated discussions by the works in his first manner. He  was considered an innovator, and it was by instinctive admiration that  his first friends, Whistler, Legros, and Fantin-Latour, were gradually  joined by Marcelin Desboutin, Degas, Renoir, Monet, Pissarro,  Caillebotte, Berthe Morisot, the young painter Bazille, who met his  premature death in 1870, and by the writers Gautier, Banville,  Baudelaire (who was a passionate admirer of Manet's); then later by  Zola, the Goncourts, and Stephane Mallarme. This was the first nucleus  of a public which was to increase year by year. Manet had the personal  qualities of a chief; he was a man of spirit, an ardent worker, and an  enthusiastic and generous character.    [Illustration: MANET    THE DEAD TOREADOR]    Manet commenced his first studies with Couture. After having travelled a  good deal at sea to obey his parents, his vocation took hold of him  irresistibly. About 1850 the young man entered the studio of the severe  author of the _Romains de la Decadence_. His stay was short. He  displeased the professor by his uncompromising energy. Couture said of  him angrily: \"He will become the Daumier of 1860.\" It is known that  Daumier, lithographer, and painter of genius, was held in meagre esteem  by the academicians. Manet travelled in Germany after the _coup d'etat_,  copied Rembrandt in Munich, then went to Italy, copied Tintoretto in  Venice, and conceived there the idea of several religious pictures. Then  he became enthusiastic about the Spaniards, especially Velasquez and  Goya. The sincere expression of things seen took root from this moment  as the principal rule of art in the brain of this young Frenchman who  was loyal, ardent, and hostile to all subtleties. He painted some fine  works, like the _Buveur d'absinthe_ and the _Vieux musicien_. They show  the influence of Courbet, but already the blacks and the greys have an  original and superb quality; they announce a virtuoso of the first  order.    It was in 1861 that Manet first sent"]]]
