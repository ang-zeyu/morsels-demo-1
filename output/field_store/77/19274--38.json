When a boy comes into the world he brings peace with him, and a      loaf of bread in his hand, but a girl brings nothing. (_Niddah_,      fol. 31, col. 2.)        It is impossible for the world to be without males and females,      but blessed is he whose children are boys, and hapless is he      whose children are girls. (_Kiddushin_, fol. 82, col. 2.)        Whosoever does not leave a son to be heir, God will heap wrath      upon him. (Scripture is quoted in proof of this, compare Numb.      xxvii. 8 with Zeph. i. 15.) (_Bava Bathra_, fol. 116, col. 1.)    \"There are two ways before me, one leading into Paradise, the other into  Hell.\" When Yochanan, the son of Zachai, was sick unto death, his  disciples came to visit him; and when he saw them he wept, upon which  his disciples exclaimed, \"Light of Israel! Pillar of the right! Mighty  Hammer! why weepest thou?\" He replied, \"If I were going to be led into  the presence of a king, who is but flesh and blood, to-day here and  to-morrow in the grave, whose anger with me could not last forever,  whose sentence against me, were it even unto death, could not endure  forever, and whom perhaps I might pacify with words or bribe with money,  yet for all that should I weep; but now that I am about to enter the  presence of the King of kings, the Holy One--blessed be He forever and  ever!--whose anger would be everlasting, whose sentence of death or  imprisonment admits of no reprieve, and who is not to be pacified with  words nor bribed with money, and in whose presence there are two roads  before me, one leading into Paradise and the other into Hell, and should  I not weep?\" Then prayed they him, and said, \"Rabbi, give us thy  farewell blessing;\" and he said unto them, \"Oh that the fear of God may  be as much upon you as the fear of man.\"    _Berachoth_, fol. 28, col. 2.    Rabbi Ami says, \"Knowledge is of great price, for it is placed between  two divine names, as it is written (I Sam. ii. 3), 'A God of knowledge  is the Lord,' and therefore mercy is to be denied to him who has no  knowledge; for it is written (Isa. xxvii. 11), 'It is a people of no  understanding, therefore He that hath made them will not have mercy on  them.'\"    _Berachoth_ fol. 33, col. 1.        Here we have a clear law, drawn from Scripture, forbidding, or      at any rate denying, mercy to the ignorant. The words of Rabbi      (the Holy) are a practical commentary on the text worth quoting,      \"Woe is unto me because I have given my morsel to an ignorant      one.\" (_Bava Bathra_, fol. 8, col. 1.)        But who is the ignorant one from whom this mercy is to be      withheld? Here the doctors disagree. He, says Rabbi Eliezer, who      does not read the Shema, \"Hear, O Israel,\" etc., both morning      and evening. According to Rabbi Yehudah, he that does not put on      phylacteries is an ignorant one. Rabbi Azai affirms that he who      wears no fringes to his garment is an ignorant one, etc. Others      again say he who even reads the Bible and the Mishna but does      not serve the disciples of the wise, is an ignorant one. Rabbi      Huna winds up with the words \"the law is as the others have      said,\" and so leaves the difficulty where he finds it.      (_Berachoth_, fol. 47, col. 2.)        Of him \"who transgresses the words of the wise, which he is      commanded to obey,\" it is written, \"He is guilty of death and      has forfeited his life.\" (_Berachoth_, fol. 4, col. 2, and      _Yevamoth_, fol. 20, col. 1.) Whoso, therefore, shows mercy to      him contradicts the purpose and incurs the displeasure of God.      It was in application of this principle, literally interpreted,      that the wise should hold no parley with the ignorant, which led      the Jews to condemn the contrary procedure of Jesus Christ.        It was this prohibition to show mercy to the ignorant, together      with the solemn threatenings directed against those who      neglected the study of the law, that worked such a wonderful      revolution in Hezekiah's time; for it is said that then \"they      searched from Dan to Beersheba, and did not find an ignorant      one.\" (_Sanhedrin_, fol. 94, col. 2.)    When the Holy One--blessed be He!--remembers that His children are in  trouble among the nations of the world, He drops two tears into the  great ocean, the noise of which startles the world from one end to the  other, and causes the earth to quake.    _Berachoth_, fol. 59, col. 1.    We read in the Talmud that a Gentile once came to Shamai and said, \"How  many laws have you?\" Shamai replied, \"We have two, the written law and  the oral law.\" To which the Gentile made answer, \"When you speak of the  written law, I believe you, but in your oral law I have no faith.  Nevertheless, you may make me a proselyte on condition that you teach me  the written law only.\" Upon this Shamai rated him sharply, and sent him  away with indignant abuse. When, however, this Gentile came with the  same object, and proposed the same terms to Hillel, the latter proceeded  at once to proselytize him, and on the first day taught him Aleph, Beth,  Gemel, Daleth. On the morrow Hillel reversed the order of these letters,  upon which the proselyte remonstrated and said, \"But thou didst not  teach me so yesterday.\" \"True,\" said Hillel, \"but thou didst trust me in  what I taught thee then; why, then, dost thou not trust me now in what I  tell thee respecting the oral law?\"    _Shabbath_, fol. 31, col. 1.    Every man as he goes on the eve of the Sabbath from the synagogue to his  house is escorted by two angels, one of which is a good angel and the  other an evil. When the man comes home and finds the lamps lit, the  table spread, and the bed in order, the good angel says, \"May the coming  Sabbath be even as the present;\" to which the evil angel (though with  reluctance) is obliged to say, \"Amen.\" But if all be in disorder, then  the bad angel says, \"May the coming Sabbath be even as the present,\" and  the good angel is (with equal reluctance), obliged to say \"Amen\" to it.    Ibid., fol. 119, col. 2.    Two are better than three. Alas! for the one that goes and does not  return again.    _Shabbath_, fol. 152, col. 1.        As in the riddle of the Sphinx, the \"two\" here stands for youth      with its two sufficient legs, and the \"three\" for old age, which      requires a third support in a staff.    There were two things which God first thought of creating on the eve of  the Sabbath, which, however, were not created till after the Sabbath had  closed. The first was fire, which Adam by divine suggestion drew forth  by striking together two stones; and the second, was the mule, produced  by the crossing of two different animals.    _P'sachim_, fol. 54, col. 1.    \"Every one has two portions, one in paradise and another in hell.\"  Acheer asked Rabbi Meyer, \"What meaneth this that is written (Eccl. vii.  14), 'God also has set the one over against the other'?\" Rabbi Meyer  replied, \"There is nothing which God has created of which He has not  also created the opposite. He who created mountains and hills created  also seas and rivers.\" But said Acheer to Rabbi Meyer, \"Thy master,  Rabbi Akiva, did not say so, but spake in this way: He created the  righteous and also the wicked; He created paradise and hell: every man  has two portions, one portion in paradise, and the other in hell. The  righteous, who has personal merit, carries both his own portion of good  and that of his wicked neighbor away with him to paradise; the wicked,  who is guilty and condemned, carries both his own portion of evil and  also that of his righteous neighbor away with him to hell.\" When Rav  Mesharshia asked what Scripture guarantee there was for this, this was  the reply: \"With regard to the righteous, it is written (Isa. lxi. 7),  'They shall rejoice in their portion, therefore in their land (beyond  the grave) they shall possess the double.' Respecting the wicked it is  written (Jer. xvii. 18), 'And destroy them with double destruction.'\"    _Chaggigah_, fol. 15, col. 1.        The question asked above by Acheer has been practically resolved      by all wise men from the beginning of the world, but it is the      boast of the Hegelians that it has for the first time been      resolved philosophically by their master. Others had maintained      that you could not think a thing but through its opposite; he      first maintained it could not exist but through its opposite,      that, in fact, the thing and its opposite must needs arise      together, and that eternally, as complements of one unity: the      white is not there without the black, nor the black without the      white; the good is not there without the evil, nor the evil      without the good.    Pride is unbecoming in women. There were two proud women, and their  names were contemptible; the name of the one, Deborah, meaning wasp, and  of the other, Huldah, weasel. Respecting the wasp it is written (Judges  iv. 6), \"And she sent and called Barak,\" whereas she ought to have gone  to him. Concerning the weasel it is written (2 Kings xxii. 15), \"Tell  the man that sent you,\" whereas she should have said, \"Tell the king.\"    _Meggillah_, fol. 14, col. 2.    If speech is worth one sela (a small coin so called), silence is worth  two.    Ibid., fol. 18, col. 1.        The Swiss motto, \"Speech is worth silver, silence worth gold,\"      expresses a sentiment which finds great favor with the authors      and varied expression in the pages of the Talmud.    If silence be good for wise men, how much better must it be for fools!    _P'sachim_, fol. 98, col. 2.    For every evil silence is the best remedy.    _Meggillah_, fol. 18, col. 1.    Silence is as good as confession.    _Yevamoth_, fol. 87, col. 1.    Silence in a Babylonian was a mark of his being of good family.    _Kiddushin_, fol. 71, col. 2.
