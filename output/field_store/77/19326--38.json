ADVENTURES    \"There is great talking among those waiting their turn for the use of  the oven, and great teasing, and sometimes fighting, amongst the boys.  Now and then one of the elder men pulls their ears with a vengeance for  being 'shkotzim', as he calls it. Then they keep quiet till he goes  away. When our turn came, Millie kneaded the flour, while father  poured the water on for her. You remember what a strong girl she is, and  she did the kneading with such a will that I warned her not to get too  hot. No flour-dredgers are used. My duty was to roll out the dough, but  Mother wasn't satisfied with the way I did it, and sent me to put more  wood in the oven. When the oven was hot enough, I had to sweep all the  burnt wood and ashes out to get it nice and clean.    [Illustration: CHADAR (SCHOOL)]    \"Then we started to put the matzos in, one by one. Oh, it was hot work!  I hardly knew what to do, it was so hot. Mother came and pushed me  aside, saying to herself I was good for nothing. In fact, my dear Jacob,  one wants training to stand such heat, as one does to be a blacksmith.  Mother said that making matzos teaches us to realize what some of the  hardships were that our forefathers went through in Egypt. I hope it  will become easier in time, for all the others are quite happy making  and baking them, singing at the same time.    \"Well, well! to be a true Jew is a hard matter. As I grow older and get  more knowledge and sense I shall find a pleasure in doing these things.      TEMPTATION--AND JONATHAN    \"After a few hours of hard work all the newly baked matzos were put in a  basket, in which had been laid a clean table-cloth; and, when all had  been carefully packed in, they were covered with another white cloth.  What I felt most was not being allowed to taste a bit, for it is  forbidden till Seder to eat any of the matzos. As I was carrying the  basket home, I felt as if the devil was in me, and the temptation was so  strong that I undid the cord and took one out. Hearing someone coming up  behind me, I slipped it hurriedly into my pocket and took up the basket  and started off again.    \"I heard the footsteps coming closer until who should come up to me but  my best friend, Jonathan? He glared at me and said: 'Oh you sinner in  Israel!' 'Why, what have I done?' I exclaimed. 'I saw you put a matzo in  your pocket!' he said.    \"I felt hot all over, for I did not want him to have a bad opinion of  me, as we had sworn friendship to each other like Jonathan and David.    \"So I took the matzo out of my pocket, threw it in the gutter, and  jumped on it.    \"'Why have you done that?' he said. 'Because I don't want you to think  badly of me.' 'Yet you did not care for what God thought!' he said.  'Don't you know that our Rabbis say that a bad thought is just as evil  as a bad deed; for, if we check a bad thought or wish, it helps us not  to put the bad thoughts or wish into action. If we were as anxious to  please God as we are to please our friends, and to be as well thought of  by Him, we should check our bad thoughts before they led us to do bad  deeds.'    \"He said, too, that he was sorry to see that I cared more for his  approval than I did for God's approval. I promised for the future to try  to overcome any evil thoughts or wishes that came into my mind so that I  should not be so tempted to do wrong--in fact I would try to check a bad  thought in the bud.    \"Then he forgave me, and we parted good friends, for I love him. He is  exactly what I think Jonathan must have been to David, and I will write  more about him in another letter.    \"When I arrived home, we had to prepare and cleanse the house for  Passover. We had to do all the work ourselves, for we could not hire any  helpers except, by a stroke of luck, the 'white-washers,' as they are  called.      SPRING CLEANING    \"All the furniture is put out of doors, not even a pin is left in the  house. As everyone does the same, a stranger passing by would think  there must be a 'jumble sale' going on.    \"Passover time is usually like lovely English summer weather. As very  little water can be got, guess how everything is scrubbed and rubbed!    \"Outside Meah Sheorim there are large holes from which clay has been  taken for building purposes, and during the winter-rains they get filled  with water and they look nearly as large as ponds.    \"We carried or pushed all the furniture to one of these ponds, took sand  moistened with a little water, and rubbed the furniture till it was  white and clean. This we have to do three times: such is the rule. If  any of the furniture was polished, you can imagine that not much of the  polish was left after all this scrubbing and rubbing.    \"We threw into the pond whatever we could, and as it was not deep, we  pulled up our trousers, and washed those pieces of furniture in the  water. Some threw in boards, and we made see-saws and played on them  till one of us fell in. It was such fun! Sometimes the furniture got  mixed, and it was hard to tell to whom it belonged. Indeed, I never  enjoyed myself so much as on this Erev Passover. Even more than in  London when I went to see _Sindbad the Sailor_. There is plenty of fun  going on when we are left free, but that is not often, you may be sure.  The best fun we had was when someone threw a chair into the pond and sat  on it while other boys pushed it along. Somebody else threw in a barrel  and a few of us got on it, and then over we went into the water.      LOTS OF FUN    \"We were not anxious to go home, even for meals, when our mothers called  us. When we did get home, we found all the walls looking lovely with  fresh whitewash. For a few days we were not allowed to go into the house  unless we took our outer clothes off to prevent our bringing in some  chometz. The weather was beautifully warm, so that we really enjoyed  eating our meals out of doors and calling out to other boys as they ate  theirs.    \"On the eve before Passover we had the fun of going to the Turkish bath  and then to Mikva and help to have all new things 'tavelt', and then the  greatest enjoyment was on the day for the preparation of the Seder!      THE BONFIRE    \"Before I stop writing I must tell you of the bonfire we had on Erev  Passover, when over a hundred of us each threw the wooden spoon and  remnants of chometz on the lighted fire, and then there was such a blaze  for nearly two hours! We caught hold of each other's hands and danced  round the bonfire. Oh! it was a grand sight. Now I'm called to go to a  Bar Mitzvah, but will write you again very soon. How I wish you were  here with me, Jacob!\"    \"I wish I was, too,\" exclaimed Benjamin, who had sat listening quietly  whilst the letter was being read. On the faces of several of the elder  people there was a far-away look and sometimes a smile, for the scenes  described in the letter brought back memories of their own childhood  when the holidays and the preparations for them were similar to those in  Palestine.      HOW TO ENJOY THE PASSOVER IN LONDON    One of the boy-listeners said: \"I see now why some of us in London do  not enjoy the holidays. It is due to our surroundings. Many of us here  have to work or go to business whether it is a holiday or not, and so we  do not enjoy them in the same spirit as the boys and girls in Palestine,  where they are freer to carry out the teaching of our religion.\"    \"Well!\" said Benjamin; \"there's one thing at least I can do, and that is  to help my mother to prepare for the Passover in my spare time.\"    \"And I, too,\" and \"I, too,\" exclaimed others.    \"Bravo, boys!\" said Mr Jacob. \"Even if you do not enjoy it so much  physically, you will do so spiritually, for anyone who tries to help his  mother to keep up our fine old customs will be blessed.\"          LAG B'OMER      It was a week before Lag B'Omer, and the friends of the Jacobs family  continued to attend every Friday evening to hear a letter from Jerusalem  read. There was only one drawback to these Friday re-unions, and that  was that every week the little cellar-kitchen sitting-room got more and  more crowded, for each friend became so interested that he brought  another with him without asking permission. However, as no one  complained, Mr and Mrs Jacobs said nothing, and were indeed thankful  that so many were interested in those old letters; and Mr Jacobs at once  started reading as follows:--    \"DEAR MILLIE,--I want to tell you how we spent Lag B'Omer here, for in  London we used not to make much of a holy day of it. Here days are taken  in preparing for it, baking cakes and preparing tasty meals. Both old  and young spend that day in visits to the graves of our great Rabbis and  in picnics on the Mount of Olives or in the cool shade of the many caves  in the neighbourhood. Those who have large families have their hands  full, for the walks in the open air give the children huge appetites;  and, unless you are prepared for such appetites it is difficult to  supply all that is needed, for you cannot buy extra food, as in England,  except perhaps a few nuts and a drink of water.    \"Before dawn, our youngsters awakened us and hurried us to get ready to  start, as if we should not have quite enough of their pranks even if we  left a few hours later. As we have to form ourselves into large groups,  we arrange these a day or two beforehand, for there are a great number  of Arabs and Turks about, and many of them are very wild. If you go  alone, or even in pairs, they are often known to attack you, especially  in the case of a girl or a woman. At first I laughed at the girls  fearing to go alone when in the country, but, after having had an  unpleasant adventure myself, I determined to be more careful and obey  those who knew better than I did as to what was safe and what "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15193"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 841, February 13, 1892 (#5)"],[1,"to swear in the local _patois_. Being fond of coffee, he was sometimes  given a spoonful, which he would come awkwardly up to the table to  drink with his master. One day the master, not thinking of his bird,  had already added cognac to his coffee, and gave the parrot the  accustomed spoonful. The parrot took a swallow of it, and, in his  surprise at the novel taste, raised his head and repeated the oath in  a tone that excited laughter in all who were present. The cause of his  surprise being discovered, he was soothed, and then took his usual  ration with evident signs of contentment. The mimicry of language in  this case clearly represented the shade of the new impression he felt.    Jaco is very timid. In the evening, when he is put to roost in a close  and dark room, he is afraid of the shadow of his perch that is cast by  the light we carry in our hand; he eyes it, and utters a low cry,  which stops when the candle is blown out and he cannot see the shadow  any longer. He stands in dread of blows in the bottom of his cage,  because, having a wing broken, he cannot fly, and is afraid of  falling. Feeling his weakness, his language has a different tone from  the usual one. Large birds flying in the sky above him annoy him  greatly, and we can all tell by his voice when such a bird is near or  flying over. He inclines his head and chatters in a low tone as long  as the bird is in sight, paying no attention to anything else. Turkeys  and hens announce the approach of a bird of prey in a similar manner.    We find in the facts which we have related, as well as in many others  which are cited respecting the ways and habits of parrots, proofs of a  remarkable intelligence. These creatures are distinguished by the  unlimited affection which they bestow upon some persons, as well as by  their excessive dislikes, which nothing can explain. Jaco conceived an  extraordinary dislike for a maid who, although she took good care of  him, was in the habit of washing the bottom of his cage under a  faucet. He afterward discarded another person, whom he had liked so  much that she could do what she pleased with him, even to passing her  hand over his back and taking him by the tail, holding him in her  hands, or putting him in her apron--caresses of a kind that parrots do  not usually permit. Nothing astonished him or offended him. He proved  very inconstant toward her, and now, while better disposed toward the  other girl, he is furious against this one. A third miss has come to  capture his affection; and when he has been left asleep, or resting in  his cage, he has always the same word, but different in the inflection  wheedling, angry, or nearly indifferent, as either of the three  persons comes near him. Jaco's pronunciation is scanned in many  meters. Only one young student has had the privilege of retaining his  affection unmarred.    Jaco had been left in the country for a whole week in the winter.  Alone and isolated, he was taken care of by a person who was not  constantly with him. The young student, accompanied by a tutor, came  to pass a few days in the house. At the sight of the youth, Jaco,  surprised, called out, \"Momon! Momon!\" \"It was affecting,\" they wrote  me, \"to see so great signs of joy.\" I have also myself witnessed  similar signs of joy at the coming of the student. Jaco's speech at  such times is always in harmony with his feelings. In the pleasant  season Jaco's cage is put outdoors; and at meal times, knowing very  well what is going on within, he keeps up a steady course of suppliant  appeals for attention. His appeals cease at once if I go out with  fruit in my hand, and if I go toward him he utters a prattle of joy  that sounds like musical laughter. These manifestations indicate that  he is happy at seeing that he has been thought of.    I close these anecdotes, as I began them, by repeating that animals  communicate their impressions, and the feelings that move them, by  various modulations of their inarticulate cries, which are  incomprehensible to us unless we have succeeded by attentive  observation in connecting them with the acts that follow or precede  them. We have also seen that the articulation of a few words learned  by parrots aids us greatly in learning the meaning of these different  inflections.    The extension of these studies would furnish much of interest; but  further observations should be made upon the same animals for a  longtime continuously, relating especially to their peculiar instincts  as manifested by their various cries. We might then, by comparing and  relating acts and cries, reach the point of comprehending and perhaps  fixing the meaning in many cases where we are now in ignorance. Every  one has noticed a few facts, and has interpreted and related them, but  much is still wanting for the co-ordination of them in the point of  view of the signification of the language and communication of animals  among themselves. It has not been made in a general sense.  --_Translated for the Popular Science Monthly from the Revue  Scientifique_.           *       *       *       *       *          MODIFICATION OF OUR CLIMATE.    By JOSEPH WALLACE.      Every now and then some weather sage predicts extremely cold winters,  and another ventures to say that the sun is gradually losing heat and  in time Arctic cold will prevail over the globe. Whatever may have  been the changes during the vast cycles of time prior to the advent of  man, or whatever may be the changes in the time to come, one thing is  quite certain; that our climate has been much modified within the past  two or three thousand years.    \"There have been fifteen climatic changes since the beginning of the  glacial age, each change lasting 10,500 years, and each change  reversing the season in the two hemispheres, the pole which had  enjoyed continuous summer being doomed to undergo perpetual winter for  10,500 years, and then passing to its former state for an equal term.  The physical changes upon the earth's surface during the past 80,000  years modified the changes of climate even in the Arctic regions, so  that the intense cold of the former epochs was much modified during  the latter epochs.\" Reckoning these climatic changes in their order,  we had entered the epoch of a more genial temperature about fifteen  hundred years ago; and if no disturbing change takes place during the  present epoch, we may reasonably expect a gradual modification of our  winters for nine thousand years to come. The changes to intense cold  from perpetual summer during the greater part of the glacial period  are supposed to have been caused by the high temperature of the north  pole as compared to that of the south pole, owing to the distribution  of land around the two, the south having almost none. Dr. Croll thinks  it was caused by the varying inclination of the earth's axis, which  produced the relative position of the two poles toward the sun to be  periodically reversed at distant periods. Dr. James Geikie agrees with  Croll on the reverse of seasons every 10,500 years during certain  periods of high ellipticity of the earth's orbit.    But it may be asked, \"How could the fauna and flora propagate  themselves under such conditions?\" The flora itself at the quaternary  age was of extreme vigor. We know this from the little which is left  us, but more especially from the presence of a large number of  herbivorous animals--stags, horses, elephants, rhinoceros, etc.--which  animated the plains and valleys of Europe and America at the same  time. Evidently they could not have lived and propagated themselves  without abundant vegetation for nourishment and development.    That which has deceived the adherents of the glacial theory, as  understood in its absolute sense, is, they have generally placed a too  high estimate on its extent and intensity. It needs but a little  effort of the reasoning powers to come to the conclusion that the  earth had cooled to the degree that all animal and vegetable life  could exist upon it, and that a portion of the earth's surface  permanently covered with snow and ice was absolutely indispensable to  the existence, perpetuity, and well-being of animal and vegetable  life. Again, they have attributed to the glaciers the rocks, gravels,  and other material which they have found spread here and there long  distances from the mountains. The transportation of the so-called  erratic rocks has appeared inexplicable in any other way, and the  piles of rock and gravel have been considered so many _moraines_, that  is, deposits of diverse material transported by the glaciers. They do  not regard the probability of other agents taking the place of  glaciers, and undervalue the moving power of water. Water in liquid  state has often produced analogous effects, and it has often been the  error of the glacialists to confound the one with the other. The  erratic rocks and the moraines are undoubtedly the ordinary  indications of the ancient gravels, but, taken isolatedly, they are  not sufficient proof. In order to convince they should be accompanied  with a third indication, which is the presence of striated rocks which  we find in the neighborhood of our actual glaciers. When all these  signs are together then there is hardly a possibility of error, but  one alone is not sufficient, because it can be the effect of another  cause.    No doubt the temperature was really lower at the quaternary age and at  the epoch generally assigned to man's advent in European countries,  but the difference was not so great as some say. A lowering of four  degrees is sufficient to explain the ancient extension of the  glaciers. We can look on this figure as the maximum, for it is proved  to-day that humanity played the main _role_ in the glacial phenomena.  The beds of rivers and the alluvia are there to tell that all the  water was not in a solid state at that time, that the glaciers were  much more extended than"]]]
