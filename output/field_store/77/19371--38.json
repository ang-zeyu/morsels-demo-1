No judicial officer ever wishes to be compelled to say that he       has listened to evidence which is false. He always prefers to say,       as I hope the hundreds of judgments which I have written will       illustrate, that he cannot accept the relevant explanation, or that       he prefers a contrary version set out in the evidence.         But in this case, the palpably false sections of evidence which I       heard could not have been the result of mistake, or faulty       recollection. They originated, I am compelled to say, in a       pre-determined plan of deception. They were very clearly part of an       attempt to conceal a series of disastrous administrative blunders       and so, in regard to the particular items of evidence to which I       have referred, I am forced reluctantly to say that I had to listen       to an orchestrated litany of lies.    The applicants claim that these findings were not based on evidence of  probative value and that the affected employees were not given a fair  opportunity of answering such charges. The general allegation in the  statement of claim that the findings attacked were made in excess of  jurisdiction has in our view a special bearing on this paragraph. The  applicants say that the paragraph affects a considerable number of  employees--namely Mr Amies, Mr R. Brown, Mr Davis, Captain Eden, Captain  Gemmell, Captain Grundy, Captain Hawkins, Mr Hewitt, Captain Johnson and  Mr Lawton. These include all the employees affected by the other  paragraphs under challenge.    We accept that reasonable readers of the report would take from it that  the conspiracy which the Commissioner appears to postulate in his  references to 'a pre-determined plan of deception' and 'an orchestrated  litany of lies' was seen by him as so wide as to cover all those  persons. Paragraph 377 is the culmination of a series of paragraphs  beginning with paragraph 373 and separately headed by the Commissioner  'The Stance adopted by the Airline before the Commission of Inquiry'.  They include specific references to the chief executive, described as  'very able but evidently autocratic' in the context of an allusion to  what 'controlled the ultimate course adopted by the witnesses called on  behalf of the airline'. There are also specific references to the  executive pilots and members of the navigation section.    It is possible that some individual witnesses did give some false  evidence during this inquiry. The applicants accept that this was for  the Commissioner to consider and that it is not for us to interfere with  his assessment of witnesses. But the complaint goes much further than  that. It is that there is simply no evidence on which he could find a  wholesale conspiracy to commit perjury, organised by the chief  executive, which is what this part of the report appears to suggest. Our  conclusion that here the Commissioner went beyond his jurisdiction and  did not comply with natural justice--a conclusion to be explained more  fully later in this judgment--makes it unnecessary for us to decide  whether there was any evidence that could conceivably warrant such an  extreme finding. It is only right to say, however, that if forced to  decide the question we would find it at least difficult to see in the  transcript any evidence of that kind.    The language of paragraph 377 has evidently been carefully selected for  maximum colour and bite, and the Commissioner has sought to reinforce  its impact by bringing in his status and experience as a judicial  officer. While unfortunate, it is no doubt that result of a search for  sharp and striking expression in a report that would be widely read. He  cannot have overstated the evidence deliberately. Similarly at senior  management level in Air New Zealand there would have been a natural  tendency to try to have the company's case put in as favourable a light  as possible before the Commission; but it was adding a further and  sinister dimension to their conduct to assert that they went as far as  organised perjury.      Costs    The applicants ask for an order quashing one of the Commissioner's  decisions as to costs. The decision in question and the reasons for it  are stated in an appendix to the report:         ... I asked the airline for its submissions on the question of       costs. The general tenor of the submissions is that the       establishment of this Royal Commission was directed by the New       Zealand Government and that the airline should not be ordered to       meet any part of the public expenditure so incurred. As a statement       of general principle, this is correct. But there is specific       statutory power to order that a party to the inquiry either pay or       contribute towards the cost of the inquiry, and that the power       should be exercised, in my opinion, whenever the conduct of that       party at the hearing has materially and unnecessarily extended the       duration of the hearing. This clearly occurred at the hearings       which took place before me.         In an inquiry of this kind, an airline can either place all its       cards on the table at the outset, or it can adopt an adversary       stance. In the present case, the latter course was decided upon.       The management of the airline instructed its counsel to deny every       allegation of fault, and to counter-attack by ascribing total       culpability to the air crew, against whom there were alleged no       less than 13 separate varieties of pilot error. All those       allegations, in my opinion, were without foundation. Apart from       that, there were material elements of information in the possession       of the airline which were originally not disclosed, omissions for       which counsel for the airline were in no way responsible, and which       successively came to light at different stages of the Inquiry when       the hearings had been going on for weeks, in some cases for months.       I am not going to burden this recital with detailed particulars,       but I should have been told at the outset that the flight path from       Hallett to McMurdo was not binding on pilots, that Captain Wilson       briefed pilots to maintain whatever altitudes were authorised by       McMurdo Air Traffic Control, that documents were ordered by the       chief executive to be destroyed, that an investigation committee       had been set up by the airline in respect of which a file was held,       and that one million copies of the Brizindine article had been       printed, a fact never revealed by the airline at all. So it was not       a question of the airline putting all its cards on the table. The       cards were produced reluctantly, and at long intervals, and I have       little doubt that there are one or two which still lie hidden in       the pack. In such circumstances the airline must make a       contribution towards the public cost of the Inquiry.         ...         6. The costs incurred by the Government in respect of this Inquiry       have been calculated by the Tribunals Division of the Department of       Justice at $275,000. A substantial liability for the burden of such       costs must lie upon the State but in my opinion the State ought to       be in part reimbursed in respect of the cost to the public of the       Inquiry, and I accordingly direct that Air New Zealand Limited pay       to the Department of Justice the sum of $150,000 by way of       contribution to the public cost of the Inquiry.    The order is in any event invalid because the amount is far greater than  the maximum allowed by the long out-of-date but apparently still extant  scale prescribed in 1903 (1904 Gazette 491). It is only fair to the  Commissioner to say that the scale seems never to have been drawn to his  attention by any counsel, although he gave an opportunity to make  submissions on costs. But there is a deeper objection to the validity of  the order, to which we will come shortly.      Conclusions    Having set out the various complaints we now state our conclusions more  specifically than in the earlier part of this judgment.    As to the jurisdiction of the Court in the present proceedings, the  application is made solely under the Judicature Amendment Act 1972.  Under that Act a decision cannot be set aside unless it was made in  exercise of a statutory power and _either_ it could have been quashed in  certiorari proceedings at common law--that is the effect of s. 4  (1)--_or_ the applicant is entitled to a declaration that it was  unauthorised or invalid, in which case s. 4 (2) empowers the Court to  set aside the decision instead.    The Erebus Commission, like others in the past in New Zealand when a  Supreme Court Judge has been the Chairman or the sole Commissioner, was  expressed to be appointed both under the Letters Patent delegating the  relevant Royal Prerogative to the Governor-General and under the  authority of and subject to the provisions of the Commissions of Inquiry  Act 1908. Some of us have reservations on various legal  questions--whether the Commission had statutory authority for its  inquiry as well as Prerogative authority; whether the findings in the  body of the report amounted to 'decisions', whether complete absence of  evidence is relevant in considering natural justice or can be redressed  in proceedings of this kind. These questions may be of more importance  in cases concerning the Thomas Commission which are to come before this  Court next year. Moreover, though most important in principle, they are  highly technical. It seems to us preferable that the Court should not  determine them now unless it is essential to do so. And we do not think  it is essential, because we are agreed on what now follows and it  enables substantial justice to be done in the present case.    It is established in New Zealand that in appropriate proceedings the  Courts may prevent "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16131"],[0,"Campaign Pictures of the War in South Africa (1899-1900) (#5)"],[1,"not hate your soldiers, though they fight  against us; but we do hate and despise the men who have brought a cruel war  upon us for their own evil ends, whilst they try to cloak their designs in  a mantle of righteousness and liberty.\" I may not have given the exact  words of the President, as I am writing from memory, but I think I have  given his exact sentiments; and, if I am any judge of human nature, the  love of his country is the love of his life.                                        \"STOPPING A FEW.\"      I saw him first, years ago upon a station in New South Wales; a neat, smart  figure less than nine stone in weight, but it was nine stone of fencing  wire full of the electricity of life. He was in the stockyard when I first  saw him, working like any ordinary station hand, for it was the busy  portion of the year, and at such times the squatters' sons work like any  hired hand, only a lot harder, if they are worth their salt, and have not  been bitten by the mania for dudeism during their college course in the  cities. There was nothing of the dandy about this fellow. From head to heel  he was a man's son, full of the vim of living, strong with the lust of  life. The sweat ran down his face, dirty with the dust kicked up by the  cattle in the stockyard. His clothes were not guiltless of mire, for he had  been knocked over more than once that morning, and there was an edge upon  his voice as he rapped out his orders to the stockmen who were working with  him. He did not look in the least degree pretty, and there was not enough  poetry about him just then to make an obituary jingle on a tombstone. I  little thought that day that a time would come when he would prove the  glory of his Australian breeding in the teeth of an enemy's guns on African  soil.    I saw him again--under silk this time--as a gentleman rider. He was the  same quiet, cool little fellow, grey-eyed, steel-lipped, stout-hearted,  with \"hands\" that Archer might have envied. He rode at his fences that day  as the Australian amateurs can ride, with a rip and a rattle, with the  long, loose leg, the hands well down, and head up and back, and \"Over or  Through\" was his motto. I did not know him to speak to in those old days.  We were to shake hands under peculiar circumstances away in a foreign land,  in a foreign hospital, both of us prisoners of war, both of us wounded.  That was where and how I spoke to little Dowling, lieutenant in the First  Australian Horse, as game a sample of humanity as ever threw leg over  saddle or loosed a rifle at a foe. He came to my bedside the morning after  I entered the hospital, and standing over me with a green shade over one  eye, and one hand in a sling, said laconically:    \"Australian ain't you?\"    \"Yes, by gad, and I know you.\" He reached out his left hand, and placed it  in mine.    \"Been 'stopping one'?\" he remarked.    \"Only a graze, thank God,\" I replied.    Then the matron and the German doctor, as fine a gentleman as ever drew  breath, came along to have a look at me, and he was turned out; but we  chummed, as Australians have a knack of doing in time of trouble, and I  tried hard to get him to talk of his adventures, but he was a mummy on that  subject. He would not yarn about his own doings on the fateful day when he  was laid out, though he was eloquent enough concerning the doings of his  comrades. All I could get out of him in regard to his own part in the fray  was that his men and he had been ambushed, and that he had \"stopped one\"  with his head, and one with his hand, and another with his leg, his horse  had been killed, and he knew mighty little more about it until he found  himself in the hands of the Boers, who had treated him well and kindly. I  asked the matron about his wounds, and she told me that a bullet had  entered the corner of his right eye, coming out by the right ear, ruining  the sight for ever. Another had carried away his right thumb, and a couple  had passed through his right leg, one just below the groin, another 'just  above the knee. That was what he modestly termed \"stopping a few.\"    After I had been in hospital a little while, the matron gave me leave to  prowl about to pick up \"copy,\" and my feet soon led me into the ward where  the wounded Dutchmen were lying, and there I met a couple of burghers who  had been in the _melee_ when Dowling was gathered in. One of them was  a handsome Swede, with a long blonde moustache, that fell with a glorious  sweep on to his chest, as the Viking's did of old. He was an adventurer,  who knew how to take his gruel like a man. He had joined the Boers because  he thought they were the weaker side, and had done his best for them. He  saw Dowling talking to me one day, and asked me if I knew the \"little  devil.\" \"Yes,\" I replied, \"we are countrymen.\" \"Americans?\" he asked. \"No,  Australians.\" He raised himself on his elbow, whilst I propped his  shoulders up with pillows, and as he remained thus he gazed admiringly at  the slight, boyish figure which limped lazily through the ward. \"What a  little tiger cat he is,\" muttered the recumbent giant. \"I thought we'd have  to kill him before we got him, and that would have been a shame, for I hate  to kill brave men when they have no chance.\" \"Tell me about it,\" I said.  \"He won't give me any information himself, only tells me he 'stopped a  few.'\" The big, handsome Swede laughed a mighty laugh under his great  blonde moustache.    \"Stopped a few, did he? If all your fellows fought it out to the bitter end  as he did, we should run short of ammunition before the war was very old.\"    A Boer nurse came over and asked us \"what nonsense we made one with the  other, that we did laugh to ourselves like two hens clucking over one egg.\"  The blonde giant turned his joyous blue eyes upon her, and paid her a  compliment which caused her to bridle, whilst the blood swept like a  race-horse in its stride over neck, and cheek, and brow, causing her  dainty, girlish face to look prettier than ever. \"Ah, little Eckhardt,\" he  whispered, and then murmured something in Dutch. I did not understand the  words, but there was something in the sound of the adventurer's voice which  conjured up a moonlit garden, a rose-crowned gate swinging on one hinge, a  girl on one side and a fool on the other. The nurse tossed her pretty head  with its wealth of jet black hair, and as she smoothed his pillows with  infinite care she murmured: \"Fighting and making love, making love and  fighting--it is all one to you, Karl. I know you, you big pirate; you are  as a hen that lays away from home.\" And with that round of shrapnel she  left us.    Karl got rid of a fourteen-pound sigh, which sounded like the bursting of a  lyddite shell. Then he slipped his hand under his pillow and drew forth a  flask of \"Dop.\" \"Drink to her,\" he said. \"To whom?\" I asked, falling in  with the humour of the man. \"To the girl I love,\" he muttered like a  schoolboy. \"Which one, Karl?\" I asked, and I laughed as I spoke. He  snatched the brandy from my hand, lifted the flask to his lips, and drank  deeply. Then again his mighty laugh ran through the hospital ward. \"Which  one?\" he said; \"why, all of them, God bless them. But the maid that is  nearest is always the dearest.\" \"Shut up, you Goth,\" I said, \"and tell me  about Dowling, for some day I shall write the story, and I would like to  hear it from the lips of one of his enemies.\" The Swede lay back upon his  pillow, stroking the golden horns of hair that fell each side of his mouth,  and I noticed that the lips which a little time before had been smiling  into the face of the nurse were now hard set and stern. So I could have  imagined him standing by the side of his gun, or rushing headlong on to our  ranks. A man with a mouth like that could not flinch in the hour of peril  if he tried, for his jaw had the Kitchener grip, the antithesis of the  parrot pout of the dandy, or the flabby fulness of the fool.    \"It was in the fore part of the day,\" he said at length. \"We had been  posted snugly overnight on both sides of two ranges of kopjes, for we knew  that your fellows were going to attempt a reconnaissance next day. How did  we know? you ask. Well, comrade, ask no questions of that kind, and I'll  tell you no lies. The truth I won't tell you.\"    But we knew, and we were ready. We were disappointed when we saw the force,  for we had expected something much bigger, and had made arrangements for a  larger capture. It was only a troop of Australian Horse that came our way,  and 'the little devil' was riding at their head. We bided our time, hoping  that he might be followed by more men, and, above all, we expected and  wanted some guns; but they did not put in an appearance, so we loosed upon  the little troop. They were fairly ambushed; they did not know that a rifle  was within miles of them until the bullets were singing through their  ranks. Horses plunged suddenly forward, reared, lurched now to the near  side, now to the off, then blundered forward on their heads, for many of  our men fired at the chargers instead of at the riders. Dowling's horse  went down with a bullet between the flap of the saddle and the crease of  the shoulder, and the little chap went spinning over his head amongst the  rocks. But a good many saddles were empty. He was up in a moment, yelling  to his men to ride for their lives, and they rode. We charged from cover,  and rode down on the men who had fallen, and as we closed in on them your  countryman lifted his rifle and loosed on us.    \"One of our fellows took a flying shot at him at close quarters, for his  rifle was talking the language of death, and that is a tongue no man likes  to listen to. The bit of lead took him in the eye and came out by his ear,  and down he went. But he climbed up in a moment, and his rifle was going to  his shoulder again, when I fired to break his arm, and carried his thumb  away--the thumb of the right hand, I think."]]]
