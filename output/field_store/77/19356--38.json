[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15718"],[0,"How To Write Special Feature Articles (#5)"],[1,"of knowledge, such as agriculture,  banking and finance, home economics, public health, social service,  government and politics, or one of the physical sciences, makes it  possible for a writer to specialize in his articles. In choosing a  department in which to do special work in college, a student may be  guided by his own tastes and interests, or he may select some field in  which there is considerable demand for well trained writers. The man or  woman with a specialty has a superior equipment for writing.    With the development of courses in journalism in many colleges and  universities has come the opportunity to obtain instruction and  practice, not only in the writing of special feature and magazine  articles, but also in newspaper reporting, editing, and short story  writing. To write constantly under guidance and criticism, such as it is  impossible to secure in newspaper and magazine offices, will develop  whatever ability a student possesses.    Experience as a newspaper reporter supplements college training in  journalism and is the best substitute for college work generally  available to persons who cannot go to college. For any one who aspires  to write, reporting has several distinct advantages and some dangers.    The requirement that news be printed at the earliest possible moment  teaches newspaper workers to collect facts and opinions quickly and to  write them up rapidly under pressure. Newspaper work also develops a  writer's appreciation of what constitutes news and what determines news  values; that is, it helps him to recognize at once, not only what  interests the average reader, but how much it interests him. Then, too,  in the course of his round of news gathering a reporter sees more of  human life under a variety of circumstances than do workers in any other  occupation. Such experience not only supplies him with an abundance of  material, but gives him a better understanding and a more sympathetic  appreciation of the life of all classes.    To get the most out of his reporting, a writer must guard against two  dangers. One is the temptation to be satisfied with superficial work  hastily done. The necessity of writing rapidly under pressure and of  constantly handling similar material, encourages neglect of the niceties  of structure and of style. In the rush of rapid writing, the importance  of care in the choice of words and in the arrangement of phrases and  clauses is easily forgotten. Even though well-edited newspapers insist  on the highest possible degree of accuracy in presenting news, the  exigencies of newspaper publishing often make it impossible to verify  facts or to attain absolute accuracy. Consequently a reporter may drop  into the habit of being satisfied with less thorough methods of  collecting and presenting his material than are demanded by the higher  standards of magazine writing.    The second danger is that he may unconsciously permit a more or less  cynical attitude to replace the healthy, optimistic outlook with which  he began his work. With the seamy side of life constantly before him, he  may find that his faith in human nature is being undermined. If,  however, he loses his idealism, he cannot hope to give his articles that  sincerity, hopefulness, and constructive spirit demanded by the average  reader, who, on the whole, retains his belief that truth and  righteousness prevail.    Of the relation of newspaper reporting to the writing of magazine  articles and to magazine editing, Mr. Howard Wheeler, editor of  Everybody's Magazine, has said:        It is the trained newspaper men that the big periodical publishers      are reaching out for. The man who has been through the newspaper      mill seems to have a distinct edge on the man who enters the field      without any newspaper training.        The nose for news, the ability to select and play up leads, the feel      of what is of immediate public interest is just as important in      magazine work as in newspaper work.        Fundamentally the purpose of a magazine article is the same as the      purpose of a newspaper story--to tell a tale, to tell it directly,      convincingly, and interestingly.    Practical experience in the field of his specialty is of advantage in  familiarizing a writer with the actual conditions about which he is  preparing himself to write. To engage for some time in farming,  railroading, household management, or any other occupation, equips a  person to write more intelligently about it. Such practical experience  either supplements college training in a special field, or serves as the  best substitute for such specialized education.    WHAT EDITORS WANT. All the requirements for success in special  feature writing may be reduced to the trite dictum that editors want  what they believe their readers want. Although a commonplace, it  expresses a point of view that aspiring writers are apt to forget. From  a purely commercial standpoint, editors are middlemen who buy from  producers what they believe they can sell to their customers. Unless an  editor satisfies his readers with his articles, they will cease to buy  his publication. If his literary wares are not what his readers want, he  finds on the newsstands unsold piles of his publication, just as a  grocer finds on his shelves faded packages of an unpopular breakfast  food. Both editor and grocer undertake to buy from the producers what  will have a ready sale and will satisfy their customers.    The writer, then, as the producer, must furnish wares that will attract  and satisfy the readers of the periodical to which he desires to sell  his product. It is the ultimate consumer, not merely the editor, that he  must keep in mind in selecting his material and in writing his article.  \"Will the reader like this?\" is the question that he must ask himself at  every stage of his work. Unless he can convince himself that the average  person who reads the periodical to which he proposes to submit his  article will like what he is writing, he cannot hope to sell it to the  editor.    UNDERSTANDING THE READER. Instead of thinking of readers as a more or  less indefinite mass, the writer will find it advantageous to picture to  himself real persons who may be taken as typical readers. It is very  easy for an author to think that what interests him and his immediate  circle will appeal equally to people in general. To write successfully,  however, for the Sunday magazine of a newspaper, it is necessary to keep  in mind the butcher, the baker, and--if not the candlestick-maker, at  least the stenographer and the department store clerk--as well as the  doctor, lawyer, merchant, and chief. What is true of the Sunday  newspaper is true of the popular magazine.    The most successful publisher in this country attributes the success of  his periodical to the fact that he kept before his mind's eye, as a  type, a family of his acquaintance in a Middle-Western town of fifteen  hundred inhabitants, and shaped the policy of his publication to meet  the needs and interests of all its members. An editor who desired to  reach such a family would be immeasurably helped in selecting his  material by trying constantly to judge from their point of view whatever  passed through his hands. It is equally true that a writer desiring to  gain admittance to that magazine, or to others making the same appeal,  would greatly profit by visualizing as vividly as possible a similar  family. Every successful writer, consciously or unconsciously, thus  pictures his readers to himself.    If, for example, an author is preparing an article for an agricultural  journal, he must have in his mind's eye an average farmer and this  farmer's family. Not only must he see them in their surroundings; he  must try to see life from their point of view. The attitude of the  typical city man toward the farm and country life is very different from  that of the countryman. Lack of sympathy and insight is a fatal defect  in many an article intended by the writer for farm readers.    Whatever the publication to which an author desires to contribute, he  should consider first, last, and all the time, its readers--their  surroundings, their education, their income, their ambitions, their  amusements, their prejudices--in short, he must see them as they really  are.    The necessity of understanding the reader and his point of view has been  well brought out by Mr. John M. Siddall, editor of the _American  Magazine_, in the following excerpt from an editorial in that  periodical:        The man who refuses to use his imagination to enable him to look at      things from the other fellow's point of view simply cannot exercise      wide influence. He cannot reach people.        Underneath it, somehow, lies a great law, the law of service. You      can't expect to attract people unless you do something for them. The      business man who has something to sell must have something useful to      sell, and he must talk about it from the point of view of the people      to whom he wants to sell his goods. In the same way, the journalist,      the preacher, and the politician must look at things from the point      of view of those they would reach. They must feel the needs of      others and then reach out and meet those needs. They can never have      a large following unless they give something. The same law runs into      the human relation. How we abhor the man who talks only about      himself--the man who never inquires about _our_ troubles, _our_      problems; the man who never puts himself in _our_ place, but      unimaginatively and unsympathetically goes on and on, egotistically      hammering away on the only subject that interests him--namely      _himself_.    STUDYING NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES. Since every successful publication  may be assumed to be satisfying its readers to a considerable degree,  the best way to determine what kind of readers it has, and what "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15721"],[0,"The Hawk of Egypt (#5)"],[1,"the least bit anxious to be  under her feet, and you'll see.  Remember, she is very young, just like  a bit of dough which must be stuffed with the currants and raisins of  knowledge and then well-baked in the oven of experience before it can  be handed across Life's counter to anyone.  Further, take care not to  blunder into any little trap she may set you out of pique.\"    \"But, dearest, I always _do_ blunder when I'm out of the saddle.\"    \"Well, even if you do, for goodness' sake keep your mouth shut.

But just ask us to honour the cave by placing our foot over the  threshold, and as sure as anything, you'll find yourself making the  early cup of tea.\"          CHAPTER IV      \"_Wide open and unguarded stand our gates,    Named by the four winds, North, South, East and West;    Portals that lead to an enchanted land. . ._\"              T. B. ALDRICH.      Damaris duly arrived in Egypt, accompanied by Wellington--who had shown  no sign of incipient hydrophobia--and Jane Coop, her maid.    It were best to describe them both now, and so get it all over.    Whilst waiting one exeat upon Waterloo station, the girl had annexed  unto herself a holy terror in the shape of a brindle bull-pup.    The hilarious quadruped had twined its leash about one leg of its  master--who was an alien from Wapping--and the spout of a zinc  watering-can which a porter had left upon the platform; for which joke  it had received a vile cuff on its wrinkled physiognomy from the alien  master.    Like some avenging goddess, Damaris, the ladylike, almost finished  product of Onslow House, sprang straight at the man, smote him with the  flat of the hand upon the face, and pounced upon the yelping pup.    \"Take your leg out of the dog's chain, you idiot!\" she cried, her eyes  blazing, her perfect teeth flashing in a positive snarl.  \"Be quick;  don't be so clumsy.  How dare you hit a dog.  He _hit_ him,\" she  announced to the interested, sympathetic crowd.  \"Hit him on his lovely  face.    \"You gif that dog back to me, missie,--he's mine.\"    \"He's mine.  I've got him, and my mother is one of the heads of the  Society that protects children.\"    \"That's got nothing to do wif dogs.\"    \"This is a puppy, so it's a child,\" had come the decisive reply.  \"And  I'll buy him, though I needn't really, if I refer it to the Society.\"    \"I'll take ten poun' for 'im.\"    The child fished for her purse, which, contained half-a-crown and her  ticket, and flung it with a supreme gesture of contempt at the man's  feet; then, squeezing up the dog in her arms, tore a simple gold  bracelet off her left arm and flung it after the purse.    \"Worv two poun' at the mos'.\"    Then, from out of a first-class carriage of the train waiting to start  for Southampton slowly descended Olivia, Duchess of Longacres.    The girl and the alien had their backs turned to her, but the crowd had  seen; had looked; started to laugh, and then had become silent, so  great was the dignity of the old lady.    Clad in a voluminous grey taffeta gown, from under which peeped little  crimson shoes; covered with a huge loose ermine wrap, with the black  poke-bonnet on top of the outrageous golden perruque and the grey  parrot bobbing up and down excitedly upon her shoulder, she stood  silently taking in the scene.    There was the light of battle in the famous hawk's-eyes as she listened  to the girl defending the pup, and her splendid teeth shone in a grin  of enjoyment as she suddenly rattled her ebony stick upon the alien's  ankle-bones, those most tender bits of anatomical scaffolding.    There was a yell of pain as the alien backed hastily into the arms of a  lusty youth who had continuously besought Damaris, to allow him \"ter  put it acrorst ther blighter's h'ugly mug,\" and a cry of delight as  Damaris ran to the old lady's side and, squeezing the pup in one arm,  made the sweetest little reverence in the pretty continental way before  she excitedly wrung her god-mother's hand.    \"_Marraine_, he hit the puppy, and I've bought him for ten pounds; at  least, Dad will send a cheque tonight.  I've given him half-a-crown and  my bracelet on account.\"    \"Call Hobson,\" said her grace to the bird, who, obeying, had shrilly  piped, \"Tumble up, men, tumble up,\" until Hobson the maid suddenly  surged, from the second-class and ploughed her way through the  delighted crowd.    \"Give the purse and bracelet to my maid, you------\"    \"Swab,\" supplemented the parrot.    \"-----at once,\" finished her grace, just as, with a cry of \"Here's  Dad!\"  Damaris ran to meet her father, who, having got hung up in the  traffic, had failed to meet the train.  He listened patiently, with  dancing eyes, to the story, smiled across at the duchess, gave the man  a pound-note and a jolly good talking to, and acquired a bull pup with  the Rodney Stone strain, which they promptly christened Wellington, as  it had won at Waterloo.    Wellington forthwith developed an inordinate jealousy of Jane Coop.    Jane Coop was maid, adviser and buffer to the girl whom she loved more  than anyone on earth.    Born on the Squire's lands, she had developed a positive genius for  mothering delicate lambs and calves and sickly chicks, so that when a  crisis had arrived almost immediately after the birth of Damaris, the  Squire had bundled the highly-certificated nurse into a motor and sent  her packing back to London, and called upon Jane Coop to rise to the  occasion.    She had risen.    Bonny and plump, she had taken the weakly little bit of humanity, also  the situation, into her strong, capable hands; treated the mother and  babe just as she would have treated a couple of delicate lambs, and  pulled them both through.    From that day forth she had dominated the house, tyrannised over the  Squire and his lady, defied each and every governess who had shown  signs of undue strictness, and found her reward for her devotion in the  love of the child who teased her to death and--in the long run--obeyed  her.    She had shown herself a positive sheep-dog on board the boat.  She had  rounded up her white lamb and yapped upon the heels of those who dared  approach with too great familiarity; had bristled and shown her teeth  upon every possible occasion, until those who would fain have led the  girl into new and verdant pastures had fled at the sheep-dog's  approach, leaving them both to enjoy the novelty of everything, each  after her own kind.    Damaris revelled in it all: the seagulls; the lighthouses; the ships  that passed in the day and night; and the tail-end of a storm they hit  up in the Bay, whilst Jane Coop invented new verses to the Litany as  she tried, in her cabin, to solve the problem of two into one, and  Wellington, somewhere under the water-line, daily gave a fine imitation  of hell-bound to a circle of admiring seamen.    To his last hour at sea Captain X will forever retain the memory of  what it cost him in strength of will to maintain his dignity, when,  standing straight and exceedingly beautiful, with one hand full of  lists, the huge bulldog at her feet, with a black bow under his left  ear, and an assembly of the greatest sufferers before her, Damaris, two  days before arriving at Port Said, solemnly read out the items and the  shop price of each article chewed, damaged or totally destroyed during  the voyage by the dog.    \"Shoes, boots, pants, edges of trousers; two pipes, one pouch, six  packets of gaspers; one entire tray of crockery; one air-cushion  dropped in fright by stewardess; one coil of rope, one life-buoy, one  tin can dented, one man's ankles slightly bruised; one bare patch to  ship's cat's back. . . .\"  And so on and so forth; whilst murmurs arose  from the sufferers, who chorused that \"they didn't want no  compensation, only too pleased to part with their bits, as long . . .\"  etc., etc.    \"I do not think the fault was all on one side, Miss Hethencourt,\"  summed up the Captain, speaking in guttural consonant and flattened  vowel from suppressed emotion.  \"The--er--the plaintiff must have  approached the dog as he was chained and------\"    \"A bulldog,\" broke in Damaris, \"is a magnet to the best in every human  being.  They simply could not help themselves; they were drawn within  reach of his teeth; they----\"    \"I cannot quite------\" interrupted the captain.  \"Yes?\"    Chips, the carpenter, showed signs of bursting with information  withheld.    \"Beggin' your pardon for interruption, sir, but what; the lady says is  true; we just couldn't keep away.  I saw the Chink--beg pardon, sir, I  mean Ling-a-Ling the laundryman, burning joss-sticks in front of  'im,\"--pointing of stub finger towards shameless dog--\"one night when  the dawg was asleep.  Jus' worship, please, sir, on all parts.  And  Mrs. Pudge what didn't oughter 'ave been down in our quarters, dropped  the air cushion, sir, 'cause she missed in stays------\"    \"I cannot,\" interrupted the captain--then choked at a mental vision of  Mrs. Pudge, who scorned such frivolous inventions as whalebone to  support the figure--then trumpeted behind his handkerchief, ending in  that combined half-snort, half-giggle which is so disastrous to dignity  and complexion, \"I cannot allow the--the--er--form of the Company's  stewardesses to be so discussed.\"    \"Beggin' yer pardon, sir,\" fiercely rejoined Chips--who was getting a  bit of his own back on Mrs. Pudge--\"I'm using the nautical expression,  sir; she failed to get about when that there dawg\"--pointing of stub  thumb at heedless dog--\"growled 'cause she has water in the knee.
