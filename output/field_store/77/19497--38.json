But, having satisfied our imagination on  this point, and placed our supposititious inhabitants in the hot world  of Mercury, how are we going to meet the conditions imposed by the  rapid changes of distance--the swift fall of the planet toward the sun,  followed by the equally swift rush away from it? For change of distance  implies change of heat and temperature.    It is true that we have a slight effect of this kind on the earth.  Between midsummer (of the northern hemisphere) and midwinter our planet  draws 3,000,000 miles nearer the sun, but the change occupies six  months, and, at the earth's great average distance, the effect of this  change is too slight to be ordinarily observable, and only the  astronomer is aware of the consequent increase in the apparent size of  the sun. It is not to this variation of the sun's distance, but rather  to the changes of the seasons, depending on the inclination of the  earth's axis, that we owe the differences of temperature that we  experience. In other words, the total supply of heat from the sun is not  far from uniform at all times of the year, and the variations of  temperature depend upon the distribution of that supply between the  northern and southern hemispheres, which are alternately inclined  sunward.    But on Mercury the supply of solar heat is itself variable to an  enormous extent. In six weeks, as we have seen, Mercury diminishes its  distance from the sun about one third, which is proportionally ten times  as great a change of distance as the earth experiences in six months.  The inhabitants of Mercury in those six pregnant weeks see the sun  expand in the sky to more than two and a half times its former  magnitude, while the solar heat poured upon them swiftly augments from  something more than four and a half times to above eleven times the  amount received upon the earth! Then, immediately, the retreat of the  planet begins, the sun visibly shrinks, as a receding balloon becomes  smaller in the eyes of its watchers, the heat falls off as rapidly as it  had previously increased, until, the aphelion point being reached, the  process is again reversed. And thus it goes on unceasingly, the sun  growing and diminishing in the sky, and the heat increasing and  decreasing by enormous amounts with astonishing rapidity. It is  difficult to imagine any way in which atmospheric influences could  equalize the effects of such violent changes, or any adjustments in the  physical organization of living beings that could make such changes  endurable.    But we have only just begun the story of Mercury's peculiarities. We  come next to an even more remarkable contrast between that planet and  our own. During the Paris Exposition of 1889 a little company of  astronomers was assembled at the Juvisy observatory of M. Flammarion,  near the French capital, listening to one of the most surprising  disclosures of a secret of nature that any _savant_ ever confided to a  few trustworthy friends while awaiting a suitable time to make it  public. It was a secret as full of significance as that which Galileo  concealed for a time in his celebrated anagram, which, when at length he  furnished the key, still remained a riddle, for then it read: \"The  Mother of the Loves imitates the Shapes of Cynthia,\" meaning that the  planet Venus, when viewed with a telescope, shows phases like those of  the moon. The secret imparted in confidence to the knot of astronomers  at Juvisy came from a countryman of Galileo's, Signor G. V.  Schiaparelli, the Director of the Observatory of Milan, and its purport  was that the planet Mercury always keeps the same face directed toward  the sun. Schiaparelli had satisfied himself, by a careful series of  observations, of the truth of his strange announcement, but before  giving it to the world he determined to make doubly sure. Early in 1890  he withdrew the pledge of secrecy from his friends and published his  discovery.    No one can wonder that the statement was generally received with  incredulity, for it was in direct contradiction to the conclusions of  other astronomers, who had long believed that Mercury rotated on its  axis in a period closely corresponding with that of the earth's  rotation--that is to say, once every twenty-four hours. Schiaparelli's  discovery, if it were received as correct, would put Mercury, as a  planet, in a class by itself, and would distinguish it by a peculiarity  which had always been recognized as a special feature of the moon, viz.,  that of rotating on its axis in the same period of time required to  perform a revolution in its orbit, and, while this seemed natural enough  for a satellite, almost nobody was prepared for the ascription of such  eccentric conduct to a planet.    The Italian astronomer based his discovery upon the observation that  certain markings visible on the disk of Mercury remained in such a  position with reference to the direction of the sun as to prove that the  planet's rotation was extremely slow, and he finally satisfied himself  that there was but one rotation in the course of a revolution about the  sun. That, of course, means that one side of Mercury always faces toward  the sun while the opposite side always faces away from it, and neither  side experiences the alternation of day and night, one having perpetual  day and the other perpetual night. The older observations, from which  had been deduced the long accepted opinion that Mercury rotated, like  the earth, once in about twenty-four hours, had also been made upon the  markings on the planet's disk, but these are not easily seen, and their  appearances had evidently been misinterpreted.    The very fact of the difficulty of seeing any details on Mercury tended  to prevent or delay corroboration of Schiaparelli's discovery. But there  were two circumstances that contributed to the final acceptance of his  results. One of these was his well-known experience as an observer and  the high reputation that he enjoyed among astronomers, and the other was  the development by Prof. George Darwin of the theory of tidal friction  in its application to planetary evolution, for this furnished a  satisfactory explanation of the manner in which a body, situated as near  the sun as Mercury is, could have its axial rotation gradually reduced  by the tidal attraction of the sun until it coincided in period with its  orbital revolution.    Accepting the accuracy of Schiaparelli's discovery, which was  corroborated in every particular in 1896 by Percival Lowell in a special  series of observations on Mercury made with his 24-inch telescope at  Flagstaff, Arizona, and which has also been corroborated by others, we  see at once how important is its bearing on the habitability of the  planet. It adds another difficulty to that offered by the remarkable  changes of distance from the sun, and consequent variations of heat,  which we have already discussed. In order to bring the situation home to  our experience, let us, for a moment, imagine the earth fallen into  Mercury's dilemma. There would then be no succession of day and night,  such as we at present enjoy, and upon which not alone our comfort but  perhaps our very existence depends, but, instead, one side of our  globe--it might be the Asiatic or the American half--would be  continually in the sunlight, and the other side would lie buried in  endless night. And this condition, so suggestive of the play of pure  imagination, this plight of being a two-faced world, like the god  Janus, one face light and the other face dark, must be the actual state  of things on Mercury.    There is one interesting qualification. In the case just imagined for  the earth, supposing it to retain the present inclination of its axis  while parting with its differential rotation, there would be an  interchange of day and night once a year in the polar regions. On  Mercury, whose axis appears to be perpendicular, a similar phenomenon,  affecting not the polar regions but the eastern and western sides of the  planet, is produced by the extraordinary eccentricity of its orbit. As  the planet alternately approaches and recedes from the sun its orbital  velocity, as we have already remarked, varies between the limits of  twenty-three and thirty-five miles per second, being most rapid at the  point nearest the sun. But this variation in the speed of its revolution  about the sun does not, in any manner, affect the rate of rotation on  its axis. The latter is perfectly uniform and just fast enough to  complete one axial turn in the course of a single revolution about the  sun. The accompanying figure may assist the explanation.    [Illustration: DIAGRAM SHOWING THAT, OWING TO THE ECCENTRICITY OF ITS  ORBIT, AND ITS VARYING VELOCITY, MERCURY, ALTHOUGH MAKING BUT ONE TURN  ON ITS AXIS IN THE COURSE OF A REVOLUTION ABOUT THE SUN, NEVERTHELESS  EXPERIENCES ON PARTS OF ITS SURFACE THE ALTERNATION OF DAY AND NIGHT.]    Let us start with Mercury in perihelion at the point _A_. The little  cross on the planet stands exactly under the sun and in the center of  the illuminated hemisphere. The large arrows show the direction in which  the planet travels in its revolution about the sun, and the small curved  arrows the direction in which it rotates on its axis. Now, in moving  along its orbit from _A_ to _B_ the planet, partly because of its  swifter motion when near the sun, and partly because of the elliptical  nature of the orbit, traverses a greater angular interval with reference  to the sun than the cross, moving with the uniform rotation of the  planet on its axis, is able to traverse in the same time. As drawn in  the diagram, the cross has moved through exactly ninety degrees, or one  right angle, while the planet in its orbit has moved through  considerably more than a right angle.
