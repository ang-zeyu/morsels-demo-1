Tributes of grief and  sympathy were offered from all official quarters of the island.    The appalling calamity fell upon the people of our country with  crushing force, and for a brief time an intense excitement prevailed,  which in a community less just and self-controlled than ours might have  led to hasty acts of blind resentment. This spirit, however, soon gave  way to the calmer processes of reason and to the resolve to investigate  the facts and await material proof before forming a judgment as to the  cause, the responsibility, and, if the facts warranted, the remedy due.  This course necessarily recommended itself from the outset to the  Executive, for only in the light of a dispassionately ascertained  certainty could it determine the nature and measure of its full duty  in the matter.    The usual procedure was followed, as in all cases of casualty or  disaster to national vessels of any maritime state. A naval court of  inquiry was at once organized, composed of officers well qualified by  rank and practical experience to discharge the onerous duty imposed  upon them. Aided by a strong force of wreckers and divers, the court  proceeded to make a thorough investigation on the spot, employing every  available means for the impartial and exact determination of the causes  of the explosion. Its operations have been conducted with the utmost  deliberation and judgment, and, while independently pursued, no  attainable source of information was neglected, and the fullest  opportunity was allowed for a simultaneous investigation by the Spanish  authorities.    The finding of the court of inquiry was reached, after twenty-three days  of continuous labor, on the 21st of March instant, and, having been  approved on the 22d by the commander in chief of the United States naval  force on the North Atlantic station, was transmitted to the Executive.    It is herewith laid before the Congress, together with the voluminous  testimony taken before the court.    Its purport is, in brief, as follows:    When the _Maine_ arrived at Havana, she was conducted by the regular  Government pilot to buoy No. 4, to which she was moored in from 5-1/2  to 6 fathoms of water.    The state of discipline on board and the condition of her magazines,  boilers, coal bunkers, and storage compartments are passed in review,  with the conclusion that excellent order prevailed and that no  indication of any cause for an internal explosion existed in any  quarter.    At 8 o'clock in the evening of February 15 everything had been reported  secure, and all was quiet.    At forty minutes past 9 o'clock the vessel was suddenly destroyed.    There were two distinct explosions, with a brief interval between them.  The first lifted the forward part of the ship very perceptibly; the  second, which was more open, prolonged, and of greater volume, is  attributed by the court to the partial explosion of two or more of the  forward magazines.    The evidence of the divers establishes that the after part of the ship  was practically intact and sank in that condition a very few moments  after the explosion. The forward part was completely demolished.    Upon the evidence of a concurrent external cause the finding of the  court is as follows:    At frame 17 the outer shell of the ship, from a point 11-1/2 feet from  the middle line of the ship and 6 feet above the keel when in its normal  position, has been forced up so as to be now about 4 feet above the  surface of the water, therefore about 34 feet above where it would be  had the ship sunk uninjured.    The outside bottom plating is bent into a reversed V shape (*A), the  after wing of which, about 15 feet broad and 32 feet in length (from  frame 17 to frame 25), is doubled back upon itself against the  continuation of the same plating, extending forward.    At frame 18 the vertical keel is broken in two and the flat keel bent  into an angle similar to the angle formed by the outside bottom plates.  This break is now about 6 feet below the surface of the water and about  30 feet above its normal position.    In the opinion of the court this effect could have been produced only by  the explosion of a mine situated under the bottom of the ship at about  frame 18 and somewhat on the port side of the ship.      The conclusions of the court are:    That the loss of the _Maine_ was not in any respect due to fault or  negligence on the part of any of the officers or members of her crew;    That the ship was destroyed by the explosion of a submarine mine, which  caused the partial explosion of two or more of her forward magazines;  and    That no evidence has been obtainable fixing the responsibility for the  destruction of the _Maine_ upon any person or persons.    I have directed that the finding of the court of inquiry and the views  of this Government thereon be communicated to the Government of Her  Majesty the Queen Regent, and I do not permit myself to doubt that the  sense of justice of the Spanish nation will dictate a course of action  suggested by honor and the friendly relations of the two Governments.    It will be the duty of the Executive to advise the Congress of the  result, and in the meantime deliberate consideration is invoked.    WILLIAM McKINLEY.        EXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 11, 1898_.    _To the Congress of the United States:_    Obedient to that precept of the Constitution which commands the  President to give from time to time to the Congress information of the  state of the Union and to recommend to their consideration such measures  as he shall judge necessary and expedient, it becomes my duty to now  address your body with regard to the grave crisis that has arisen in the  relations of the United States to Spain by reason of the warfare that  for more than three years has raged in the neighboring island of Cuba.    I do so because of the intimate connection of the Cuban question with  the state of our own Union and the grave relation the course which  it is now incumbent upon the nation to adopt must needs bear to the  traditional policy of our Government if it is to accord with the  precepts laid down by the founders of the Republic and religiously  observed by succeeding Administrations to the present day.    The present revolution is but the successor of other similar  insurrections which have occurred in Cuba against the dominion of Spain,  extending over a period of nearly half a century, each of which during  its progress has subjected the United States to great effort and expense  in enforcing its neutrality laws, caused enormous losses to American  trade and commerce, caused irritation, annoyance, and disturbance among  our citizens, and, by the exercise of cruel, barbarous, and uncivilized  practices of warfare, shocked the sensibilities and offended the humane  sympathies of our people.    Since the present revolution began, in February, 1895, this country has  seen the fertile domain at our threshold ravaged by fire and sword in  the course of a struggle unequaled in the history of the island and  rarely paralleled as to the numbers of the combatants and the bitterness  of the contest by any revolution of modern times where a dependent  people striving to be free have been opposed by the power of the  sovereign state.    Our people have beheld a once prosperous community reduced to  comparative want, its lucrative commerce virtually paralyzed, its  exceptional productiveness diminished, its fields laid waste, its mills  in ruins, and its people perishing by tens of thousands from hunger and  destitution. We have found ourselves constrained, in the observance  of that strict neutrality which our laws enjoin and which the law of  nations commands, to police our own waters and watch our own seaports  in prevention of any unlawful act in aid of the Cubans.    Our trade has suffered, the capital invested by our citizens in Cuba  has been largely lost, and the temper and forbearance of our people  have been so sorely tried as to beget a perilous unrest among our own  citizens, which has inevitably found its expression from time to time in  the National Legislature, so that issues wholly external to our own body  politic engross attention and stand in the way of that close devotion to  domestic advancement that becomes a self-contained commonwealth whose  primal maxim has been the avoidance of all foreign entanglements. All  this must needs awaken, and has, indeed, aroused, the utmost concern on  the part of this Government, as well during my predecessor's term as in  my own.    In April, 1896, the evils from which our country suffered through the  Cuban war became so onerous that my predecessor made an effort to bring  about a peace through the mediation of this Government in any way that  might tend to an honorable adjustment of the contest between Spain  and her revolted colony, on the basis of some effective scheme of  self-government for Cuba under the flag and sovereignty of Spain. It  failed through the refusal of the Spanish government then in power to  consider any form of mediation or, indeed, any plan of settlement which  did not begin with the actual submission of the insurgents to the mother  country, and then only on such terms as Spain herself might see fit to  grant. The war continued unabated. The resistance of the insurgents was  in no wise diminished.    The efforts of Spain were increased, both by the dispatch of fresh  levies to Cuba and by the addition to the horrors of the strife of  a new and inhuman phase happily unprecedented in the modern history  of civilized Christian peoples. The policy of devastation and  concentration, inaugurated by the Captain-General's _bando_ of  October 21, 1896, in the Province of Pinar del Rio was thence extended  to embrace all of the island to which the power of the Spanish arms was  able to reach by occupation or by military operations.

The Professor breathed hard and said nothing.    \"It's not the first time, either,\" said the policeman, severely,  shaking his head.  \"You were in trouble last month for the same thing.  You've blackened this young man's eye.  Do you give him in charge, sir?\"    I relented.    \"No,\" said I, \"I do not.\"    \"What's that?\" said the policeman.    \"I was to blame myself.  I intruded upon him.  He gave me fair warning.\"    The policeman snapped up his notebook.    \"Don't let us have any more such goings-on,\" said he.  \"Now, then!  Move on, there, move on!\"  This to a butcher's boy, a maid, and one or  two loafers who had collected.  He clumped heavily down the street,  driving this little flock before him.  The Professor looked at me, and  there was something humorous at the back of his eyes.    \"Come in!\" said he.  \"I've not done with you yet.\"    The speech had a sinister sound, but I followed him none the less into  the house.  The man-servant, Austin, like a wooden image, closed the  door behind us.                                      CHAPTER IV             \"It's Just the very Biggest Thing in the World\"    Hardly was it shut when Mrs. Challenger darted out from the  dining-room.  The small woman was in a furious temper.  She barred her  husband's way like an enraged chicken in front of a bulldog.  It was  evident that she had seen my exit, but had not observed my return.    \"You brute, George!\" she screamed.  \"You've hurt that nice young man.\"    He jerked backwards with his thumb.    \"Here he is, safe and sound behind me.\"    She was confused, but not unduly so.    \"I am so sorry, I didn't see you.\"    \"I assure you, madam, that it is all right.\"    \"He has marked your poor face!  Oh, George, what a brute you are!  Nothing but scandals from one end of the week to the other.  Everyone  hating and making fun of you.  You've finished my patience.  This ends  it.\"    \"Dirty linen,\" he rumbled.    \"It's not a secret,\" she cried.  \"Do you suppose that the whole  street--the whole of London, for that matter----  Get away, Austin, we  don't want you here.  Do you suppose they don't all talk about you?  Where is your dignity?  You, a man who should have been Regius  Professor at a great University with a thousand students all revering  you.  Where is your dignity, George?\"    \"How about yours, my dear?\"    \"You try me too much.  A ruffian--a common brawling ruffian--that's  what you have become.\"    \"Be good, Jessie.\"    \"A roaring, raging bully!\"    \"That's done it!  Stool of penance!\" said he.    To my amazement he stooped, picked her up, and placed her sitting upon  a high pedestal of black marble in the angle of the hall.  It was at  least seven feet high, and so thin that she could hardly balance upon  it.  A more absurd object than she presented cocked up there with her  face convulsed with anger, her feet dangling, and her body rigid for  fear of an upset, I could not imagine.    \"Let me down!\" she wailed.    \"Say 'please.'\"    \"You brute, George!  Let me down this instant!\"    \"Come into the study, Mr. Malone.\"    \"Really, sir----!\" said I, looking at the lady.    \"Here's Mr. Malone pleading for you, Jessie.  Say 'please,' and down  you come.\"    \"Oh, you brute!  Please! please!\"    He took her down as if she had been a canary.    \"You must behave yourself, dear.  Mr. Malone is a Pressman.  He will  have it all in his rag to-morrow, and sell an extra dozen among our  neighbors.  'Strange story of high life'--you felt fairly high on that  pedestal, did you not?  Then a sub-title, 'Glimpse of a singular  menage.'  He's a foul feeder, is Mr. Malone, a carrion eater, like all  of his kind--porcus ex grege diaboli--a swine from the devil's herd.  That's it, Malone--what?\"    \"You are really intolerable!\" said I, hotly.    He bellowed with laughter.    \"We shall have a coalition presently,\" he boomed, looking from his wife  to me and puffing out his enormous chest.  Then, suddenly altering his  tone, \"Excuse this frivolous family badinage, Mr. Malone.  I called you  back for some more serious purpose than to mix you up with our little  domestic pleasantries.  Run away, little woman, and don't fret.\"  He  placed a huge hand upon each of her shoulders.  \"All that you say is  perfectly true.  I should be a better man if I did what you advise, but  I shouldn't be quite George Edward Challenger.  There are plenty of  better men, my dear, but only one G. E. C.  So make the best of him.\"  He suddenly gave her a resounding kiss, which embarrassed me even more  than his violence had done.  \"Now, Mr. Malone,\" he continued, with a  great accession of dignity, \"this way, if YOU please.\"    We re-entered the room which we had left so tumultuously ten minutes  before.  The Professor closed the door carefully behind us, motioned me  into an arm-chair, and pushed a cigar-box under my nose.    \"Real San Juan Colorado,\" he said.  \"Excitable people like you are the  better for narcotics.  Heavens! don't bite it!  Cut--and cut with  reverence!  Now lean back, and listen attentively to whatever I may  care to say to you.  If any remark should occur to you, you can reserve  it for some more opportune time.    \"First of all, as to your return to my house after your most  justifiable expulsion\"--he protruded his beard, and stared at me as one  who challenges and invites contradiction--\"after, as I say, your  well-merited expulsion.  The reason lay in your answer to that most  officious policeman, in which I seemed to discern some glimmering of  good feeling upon your part--more, at any rate, than I am accustomed to  associate with your profession.  In admitting that the fault of the  incident lay with you, you gave some evidence of a certain mental  detachment and breadth of view which attracted my favorable notice.  The sub-species of the human race to which you unfortunately belong has  always been below my mental horizon.  Your words brought you suddenly  above it.  You swam up into my serious notice.  For this reason I asked  you to return with me, as I was minded to make your further  acquaintance.  You will kindly deposit your ash in the small Japanese  tray on the bamboo table which stands at your left elbow.\"    All this he boomed forth like a professor addressing his class.  He had  swung round his revolving chair so as to face me, and he sat all puffed  out like an enormous bull-frog, his head laid back and his eyes  half-covered by supercilious lids.  Now he suddenly turned himself  sideways, and all I could see of him was tangled hair with a red,  protruding ear.  He was scratching about among the litter of papers  upon his desk.  He faced me presently with what looked like a very  tattered sketch-book in his hand.    \"I am going to talk to you about South America,\" said he.  \"No comments  if you please.  First of all, I wish you to understand that nothing I  tell you now is to be repeated in any public way unless you have my  express permission.  That permission will, in all human probability,  never be given.  Is that clear?\"    \"It is very hard,\" said I. \"Surely a judicious account----\"    He replaced the notebook upon the table.    \"That ends it,\" said he.  \"I wish you a very good morning.\"    \"No, no!\" I cried.  \"I submit to any conditions.  So far as I can see,  I have no choice.\"    \"None in the world,\" said he.    \"Well, then, I promise.\"    \"Word of honor?\"    \"Word of honor.\"    He looked at me with doubt in his insolent eyes.    \"After all, what do I know about your honor?\" said he.    \"Upon my word, sir,\" I cried, angrily, \"you take very great liberties!  I have never been so insulted in my life.\"    He seemed more interested than annoyed at my outbreak.    \"Round-headed,\" he muttered.  \"Brachycephalic, gray-eyed, black-haired,  with suggestion of the negroid.  Celtic, I presume?\"    \"I am an Irishman, sir.\"    \"Irish Irish?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"That, of course, explains it.  Let me see; you have given me your  promise that my confidence will be respected?  That confidence, I may  say, will be far from complete.  But I am prepared to give you a few  indications which will be of interest.  In the first place, you are  probably aware that two years ago I made a journey to South  America--one which will be classical in the scientific history of the  world?  The object of my journey was to verify some conclusions of  Wallace and of Bates, which could only be done by observing their  reported facts under the same conditions in which they had themselves  noted them.  If my expedition had no other results it would still have  been noteworthy, but a curious incident occurred to me while there  which opened up an entirely fresh line of inquiry.    \"You are aware--or probably, in this half-educated age, you are not  aware--that the country round some parts of the Amazon is still only  partially explored, and that a great number of tributaries, some of  them entirely uncharted, run into the main river.  It was my business  to visit this little-known back-country and to examine its fauna, which  furnished me with the materials for several chapters for that great and  monumental work upon zoology which will be my life's justification.  I  was returning, my work accomplished, when I had occasion to spend a  night at a small Indian village at a point where a certain  tributary--the name and position of which I withhold--opens into the  main river.  The natives were Cucama Indians, an amiable but degraded  race, with mental powers hardly superior to the average Londoner.  I  had effected some cures among them upon my way up the river, and had  impressed them considerably with my personality, so that I was not  surprised to find myself eagerly awaited upon my return.  I gathered  from their signs that someone had urgent need of my medical services,  and I followed the chief to one of his huts.  When I entered I found  that the sufferer to whose aid I had been summoned had that instant  expired.  He was, to my"]]]
