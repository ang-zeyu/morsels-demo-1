[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16957"],[0,"Mr. Sponge's Sporting Tour (#5)"],[1," a perfect dray-oss in miniature. An 'Arrow gent,  lookin' at him t'other day christen'd him \"Multum in Parvo.\" But though  he's so _ter-men_-dous strong, he has the knack o' goin', specially in  deep; and if you're not a-goin' to Sir Richard, but into some o' them  plough sheers (shires), I'd 'commend him to you.'    'Let's have a look at him,' replied Mr. Sponge, throwing his right leg over  Hercules' head and sliding from the saddle on to the ground, as if he were  alighting from the quietest shooting pony in the world.    All then was hurry, scurry, and scamper to get this second prodigy out.  Presently he appeared. Multum in Parvo certainly was all that Buckram  described him. A long, low, clean-headed, clean-necked, big-hocked,  chestnut, with a long tail, and great, large, flat white legs, without mark  or blemish upon them. Unlike Hercules, there was nothing indicative of vice  or mischief about him. Indeed, he was rather a sedate, meditative-looking  animal; and, instead of the watchful, arms'-length sort of way Leather and  Co. treated Hercules, they jerked and punched Parvo about as if he were a  cow.    Still Parvo had his foibles. He was a resolute, head-strong animal, that  would go his own way in spite of all the pulling and hauling in the world.  If he took it into his obstinate head to turn into a particular field, into  it he would be; or against the gate-post he would bump the rider's leg in a  way that would make him remember the difference of opinion between them.  His was not a fiery, hot-headed spirit, with object or reason for its  guide, but just a regular downright pig-headed sort of stupidity, that  nobody could account for. He had a mouth like a bull, and would walk clean  through a gate sometimes rather than be at the trouble of rising to leap  it; at other times he would hop over it like a bird. He could not beat Mr.  Buckram's men, because they were always on the look-out for objects of  contention with sharp spur rowels, ready to let into his sides the moment  he began to stop; but a weak or a timid man on his back had no more chance  than he would on an elephant. If the horse chose to carry him into the  midst of the hounds at the meet, he would have him in--nay, he would think  nothing of upsetting the master himself in the middle of the pack. Then the  provoking part was, that the obstinate animal, after having done all the  mischief, would just set to to eat as if nothing had happened. After  rolling a sportsman in the mud, he would repair to the nearest hay-stack or  grassy bank, and be caught. He was now ten years old, or a _leetle_ more  perhaps, and very wicked years some of them had been. His adventures, his  sellings and his returning, his lettings and his unlettings, his bumpings  and spillings, his smashings and crashings, on the road, in the field, in  single and in double harness, would furnish a volume of themselves; and in  default of a more able historian, we purpose blending his future fortune  with that of 'Ercles,' in the service of our hero Mr. Sponge, and his  accomplished groom, and undertaking the important narration of them  ourselves.    [Illustration]          CHAPTER IV    LAVERICK WELLS      We trust our opening chapters, aided by our friend Leech's pencil, will  have enabled our readers to embody such a Sponge in their mind's eye as  will assist them in following us through the course of his peregrinations.  We do not profess to have drawn such a portrait as will raise the same sort  of Sponge in the minds of all, but we trust we have given such a general  outline of style, and indication of character, as an ordinary knowledge of  the world will enable them to imagine a good, pushing, free-and-easy sort  of man, wishing to be a gentleman without knowing how.    Far more difficult is the task of conveying to our readers such information  as will enable them to form an idea of our hero's ways and means. An  accommodating world--especially the female portion of it--generally  attribute ruin to the racer, and fortune to the fox-hunter; but though Mr.  Sponge's large losses on the turf, as detailed by him to Mr. Buckram on the  occasion of their deal or 'job,' would bring him in the category of the  unfortunates; still that representation was nearly, if not altogether,  fabulous. That Mr. Sponge might have lost a trifle on the great races of  the year, we don't mean to deny, but that he lost such a sum as eighteen  hundred on the Derby, and seven on the Leger, we are in a condition to  contradict, for the best of all possible reasons, that he hadn't it to  lose. At the same time we do not mean to attribute falsehood to Mr.  Sponge--quite the contrary--it is no uncommon thing for merchants and  traders--men who 'talk in thousands,' to declare that they lost twenty  thousand by this, or forty thousand by that, simply meaning that they  didn't make it, and if Mr. Sponge, by taking the longest of the long odds  against the most wretched of the outsiders, might have won the sums he  named, he surely had a right to say he lost them when he didn't get them.    It never does to be indigenously poor, if we may use such a term, and when  a man gets to the end of his tether, he must have something or somebody to  blame rather than his own extravagance or imprudence, and if there is no  'rascally lawyer' who has bolted with his title-deeds, or fraudulent agent  who has misappropriated his funds, why then, railroads, or losses on the  turf, or joint-stock banks that have shut up at short notice, come in as  the scapegoats. Very willing hacks they are, too, railways especially, and  so frequently ridden, that it is no easy matter to discriminate between the  real and the fictitious loser.    But though we are able to contradict Mr. Sponge's losses on the turf, we  are sorry we are not able to elevate him to the riches the character of a  fox-hunter generally inspires. Still, like many men of whom the common  observation is, 'nobody knows how he lives,' Mr. Sponge always seemed well  to do in the world. There was no appearance of want about him. He always  hunted: sometimes with five horses, sometimes with four, seldom with less  than three, though at the period of our introduction he had come down to  two. Nevertheless, those two, provided he could but make them 'go,' were  well calculated to do the work of four. And hack horses, of all sorts, it  may be observed, generally do double the work of private ones; and if there  is one man in the world better calculated to get the work out of them than  another, that man most assuredly is Mr. Sponge. And this reminds us, that  we may as well state that his bargain with Buckram was a sort of jobbing  deal. He had to pay ten guineas a month for each horse, with a sort of  sliding scale of prices if he chose to buy--the price of 'Ercles' (the big  brown) being fixed at fifty, inclusive of hire at the end of the first  month, and gradually rising according to the length of time he kept him  beyond that; while, 'Multum in Parvo,' the resolute chestnut, was booked at  thirty, with the right of buying at five more, a contingency that Buckram  little expected. He, we may add, had got him for ten, and dear he thought  him when he got him home.    The world was now all before Mr. Sponge where to choose; and not being the  man to keep hack horses to look at, we must be setting him a-going.    'Leicesterscheer swells,' as Mr. Buckram would call them, with their  fourteen hunters and four hacks, will smile at the idea of a man going from  home to hunt with only a couple of 'screws,' but Mr. Sponge knew what he  was about, and didn't want any one to counsel him. He knew there were  places where a man can follow up the effect produced by a red coat in the  morning to great advantage in the evening; and if he couldn't hunt every  day in the week, as he could have wished, he felt he might fill up his time  perhaps quite as profitably in other ways. The ladies, to do them justice,  are never at all suspicious about men--on the 'nibble'--always taking it  for granted, they are 'all they could wish,' and they know each other so  well, that any cautionary hint acts rather in a man's favour than  otherwise. Moreover, hunting men, as we said before, are all supposed to be  rich, and as very few ladies are aware that a horse can't hunt every day in  the week, they just class the whole 'genus' fourteen-horse power men,  ten-horse power men, five-horse power men, two-horse power men, together,  and tying them in a bunch, label it '_very rich_,' and proceed to take  measures accordingly.    Let us now visit one of the 'strongholds' of fox and fortune-hunting.    A sudden turn of a long, gently rising, but hitherto uninteresting road,  brings the posting traveller suddenly upon the rich, well-wooded,  beautifully undulating vale of Fordingford, whose fine green pastures are  brightened with occasional gleams of a meandering river, flowing through  the centre of the vale. In the far distance, looking as though close upon  the blue hills, though in reality several miles apart, sundry spires and  taller buildings are seen rising above the grey mists towards which a  straight, undeviating, matter-of-fact line of railway passing up the right  of the vale, directs the eye. This is the famed Laverick Wells, the  resort, as indeed all watering-places are, according to newspaper accounts,  of                               'Knights and dames,      And all that wealth and lofty lineage claim.'    At the period of which we write, however, 'Laverick Wells' was in great  feather--it had never known such times. Every house, every lodging, every  hole and corner was full, and the great hotels, which more resemble  Lancashire cotton-mills than English hostelries, were sending away  applicants in the most offhand, indifferent way.    The Laverick Wells hounds had formerly been under the management of the  well-known Mr. Thomas Slocdolager, a hard-riding, hard-bitten, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16960"],[0,"History of the United States (#5)"],[1,"to their mother  tongue as they did to their capacious farmhouses or their Dutch ovens;  but they were slowly losing their identity as the English pressed in  beside them to farm and trade.    The melting pot had begun its historic mission.      THE PROCESS OF COLONIZATION    Considered from one side, colonization, whatever the motives of the  emigrants, was an economic matter. It involved the use of capital to pay  for their passage, to sustain them on the voyage, and to start them on  the way of production. Under this stern economic necessity, Puritans,  Scotch-Irish, Germans, and all were alike laid.    =Immigrants Who Paid Their Own Way.=--Many of the immigrants to America  in colonial days were capitalists themselves, in a small or a large way,  and paid their own passage. What proportion of the colonists were able  to finance their voyage across the sea is a matter of pure conjecture.  Undoubtedly a very considerable number could do so, for we can trace the  family fortunes of many early settlers. Henry Cabot Lodge is authority  for the statement that \"the settlers of New England were drawn from the  country gentlemen, small farmers, and yeomanry of the mother  country.... Many of the emigrants were men of wealth, as the old lists  show, and all of them, with few exceptions, were men of property and  good standing. They did not belong to the classes from which emigration  is usually supplied, for they all had a stake in the country they left  behind.\" Though it would be interesting to know how accurate this  statement is or how applicable to the other colonies, no study has as  yet been made to gratify that interest. For the present it is an  unsolved problem just how many of the colonists were able to bear the  cost of their own transfer to the New World.    =Indentured Servants.=--That at least tens of thousands of immigrants  were unable to pay for their passage is established beyond the shadow of  a doubt by the shipping records that have come down to us. The great  barrier in the way of the poor who wanted to go to America was the cost  of the sea voyage. To overcome this difficulty a plan was worked out  whereby shipowners and other persons of means furnished the passage  money to immigrants in return for their promise, or bond, to work for a  term of years to repay the sum advanced. This system was called  indentured servitude.    It is probable that the number of bond servants exceeded the original  twenty thousand Puritans, the yeomen, the Virginia gentlemen, and the  Huguenots combined. All the way down the coast from Massachusetts to  Georgia were to be found in the fields, kitchens, and workshops, men,  women, and children serving out terms of bondage generally ranging from  five to seven years. In the proprietary colonies the proportion of bond  servants was very high. The Baltimores, Penns, Carterets, and other  promoters anxiously sought for workers of every nationality to till  their fields, for land without labor was worth no more than land in the  moon. Hence the gates of the proprietary colonies were flung wide open.  Every inducement was offered to immigrants in the form of cheap land,  and special efforts were made to increase the population by importing  servants. In Pennsylvania, it was not uncommon to find a master with  fifty bond servants on his estate. It has been estimated that two-thirds  of all the immigrants into Pennsylvania between the opening of the  eighteenth century and the outbreak of the Revolution were in bondage.  In the other Middle colonies the number was doubtless not so large; but  it formed a considerable part of the population.    The story of this traffic in white servants is one of the most striking  things in the history of labor. Bondmen differed from the serfs of the  feudal age in that they were not bound to the soil but to the master.  They likewise differed from the negro slaves in that their servitude had  a time limit. Still they were subject to many special disabilities. It  was, for instance, a common practice to impose on them penalties far  heavier than were imposed upon freemen for the same offense. A free  citizen of Pennsylvania who indulged in horse racing and gambling was  let off with a fine; a white servant guilty of the same unlawful conduct  was whipped at the post and fined as well.    The ordinary life of the white servant was also severely restricted. A  bondman could not marry without his master's consent; nor engage in  trade; nor refuse work assigned to him. For an attempt to escape or  indeed for any infraction of the law, the term of service was extended.  The condition of white bondmen in Virginia, according to Lodge, \"was  little better than that of slaves. Loose indentures and harsh laws put  them at the mercy of their masters.\" It would not be unfair to add that  such was their lot in all other colonies. Their fate depended upon the  temper of their masters.    Cruel as was the system in many ways, it gave thousands of people in the  Old World a chance to reach the New--an opportunity to wrestle with fate  for freedom and a home of their own. When their weary years of servitude  were over, if they survived, they might obtain land of their own or  settle as free mechanics in the towns. For many a bondman the gamble  proved to be a losing venture because he found himself unable to rise  out of the state of poverty and dependence into which his servitude  carried him. For thousands, on the contrary, bondage proved to be a real  avenue to freedom and prosperity. Some of the best citizens of America  have the blood of indentured servants in their veins.    =The Transported--Involuntary Servitude.=--In their anxiety to secure  settlers, the companies and proprietors having colonies in America  either resorted to or connived at the practice of kidnapping men, women,  and children from the streets of English cities. In 1680 it was  officially estimated that \"ten thousand persons were spirited away\" to  America. Many of the victims of the practice were young children, for  the traffic in them was highly profitable. Orphans and dependents were  sometimes disposed of in America by relatives unwilling to support them.  In a single year, 1627, about fifteen hundred children were shipped to  Virginia.    In this gruesome business there lurked many tragedies, and very few  romances. Parents were separated from their children and husbands from  their wives. Hundreds of skilled artisans--carpenters, smiths, and  weavers--utterly disappeared as if swallowed up by death. A few thus  dragged off to the New World to be sold into servitude for a term of  five or seven years later became prosperous and returned home with  fortunes. In one case a young man who was forcibly carried over the sea  lived to make his way back to England and establish his claim to a  peerage.    Akin to the kidnapped, at least in economic position, were convicts  deported to the colonies for life in lieu of fines and imprisonment. The  Americans protested vigorously but ineffectually against this practice.  Indeed, they exaggerated its evils, for many of the \"criminals\" were  only mild offenders against unduly harsh and cruel laws. A peasant  caught shooting a rabbit on a lord's estate or a luckless servant girl  who purloined a pocket handkerchief was branded as a criminal along with  sturdy thieves and incorrigible rascals. Other transported offenders  were \"political criminals\"; that is, persons who criticized or opposed  the government. This class included now Irish who revolted against  British rule in Ireland; now Cavaliers who championed the king against  the Puritan revolutionists; Puritans, in turn, dispatched after the  monarchy was restored; and Scotch and English subjects in general who  joined in political uprisings against the king.    =The African Slaves.=--Rivaling in numbers, in the course of time, the  indentured servants and whites carried to America against their will  were the African negroes brought to America and sold into slavery. When  this form of bondage was first introduced into Virginia in 1619, it was  looked upon as a temporary necessity to be discarded with the increase  of the white population. Moreover it does not appear that those planters  who first bought negroes at the auction block intended to establish a  system of permanent bondage. Only by a slow process did chattel slavery  take firm root and become recognized as the leading source of the labor  supply. In 1650, thirty years after the introduction of slavery, there  were only three hundred Africans in Virginia.    The great increase in later years was due in no small measure to the  inordinate zeal for profits that seized slave traders both in Old and in  New England. Finding it relatively easy to secure negroes in Africa,  they crowded the Southern ports with their vessels. The English Royal  African Company sent to America annually between 1713 and 1743 from five  to ten thousand slaves. The ship owners of New England were not far  behind their English brethren in pushing this extraordinary traffic.    As the proportion of the negroes to the free white population steadily  rose, and as whole sections were overrun with slaves and slave traders,  the Southern colonies grew alarmed. In 1710, Virginia sought to curtail  the importation by placing a duty of L5 on each slave. This effort was  futile, for the royal governor promptly vetoed it. From time to time  similar bills were passed, only to meet with royal disapproval. South  Carolina, in 1760, absolutely prohibited importation; but the measure  was killed by the British crown. As late as 1772, Virginia, not daunted  by a century of rebuffs, sent to George III a petition in this vein:  \"The importation of slaves into the colonies from the coast of Africa  hath long been considered as a trade of great inhumanity and under its  present encouragement, we have too much reason to fear, will endanger  the very existence of"]]]
