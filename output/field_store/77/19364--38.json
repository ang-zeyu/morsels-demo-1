Of which you should each morning...      CRESPEL.    Ah, wretch,  Come, come, may the waves engulf thee!    We'll see if the devil    Will get thee out.      CRESPEL.

ANTONIA (appearing).      Well? What did my father say?      HOFFMAN.    Ask me nothing;  Later you'll know all; a new road  Opens for us, my Antonia!...  To follow my steps dismiss from your memory  These dreams of future success and glory  That your heart to mine confided.      ANTONIA.      But yourself!      HOFFMAN.    Love calls to both of us,  All that is not you is nothing in my life.      ANTONIA.      Very well! Here is my hand!      HOFFMAN.    Ah dear Antonia, shall I appreciate  What you do for me? (He kisses her hands.)    Your father will perhaps return.  I leave you... until to-morrow.      ANTONIA.      Until to-morrow.    (Hoffman goes out.)      ANTONIA (opening one of the doors).    Of my father easily he has become the accomplice,  But come, regrets are superfluous,  I promised him. I shall sing no more.    (She falls in a chair.)      MIRACLE (appearing suddenly behind her.)    You will sing no more. Do you know what a sacrifice?  He imposes on your youth, and have you measured it?  Grace, beauty, talent, sacred gift;  All these blessings that heaven gave for your share,  Must they be hid in the shadow of a household?  Have you not heard, in a proud dream,  Like unto a forest by the wind moving,  Like a soft shiver of the pressing crowd  That murmurs your name and follows you with its eyes?  There is the ardent joy and the eternal festival,  That the flower of your years is about to abandon,  For the middle class pleasures where they would enchain you,  And the squalling children who will give you less beauty!      ANTONIA (without turning round).    Ah, what is this voice that troubles my spirit?  Is it Hell that speaks or Heaven that warns me?  No! happiness is not there, oh cursed voice,  And against my pride my love has armed me;  Glory is not worth the happy shade whence invites me  The house of my beloved.      MIRACLE.    What loves can now be yours,  Hoffman sacrifices you to his brutality,  He only loves in you your beauty,  And for him as for the others.  Soon will come the time of infidelity.    (He disappears.)      ANTONIA (rising).    No, do not tempt me! go away,  Demon! I will no longer listen.  I have sworn to be his, my beloved awaits me,  I'm no longer my own and I can't take myself back;  And a few moments since, on his heart adored  What eternal love did he not pledge me;  Who will save me from the demon, from myself?  My mother, my mother, I love her.    (She falls weeping on the clavichord.)      MIRACLE (re-appears behind Antonia)    Your mother? Dare you invoke her?  Your mother? But is it not she?  Who speaks by my voice ingrate, and recalls to you  The splendor of the name that you would abdicate?    (The portrait lights up and becomes animated.)      Listen!      THE VOICE.      Antonia!      ANTONIA.    Heavens!... my mother, my mother!      THE GHOST.    Dear child whom I call,  As I used to do,  'Tis your mother, 'tis she,  Listen to her voice.      ANTONIA.      Mother!      MIRACLE.      Yes, yes, 'tis her voice, do you hear?  Her voice, best counselor,  Who leaves you a talent the world has lost!      THE GHOST.      Antonia!      MIRACLE.    Listen! She seems to live aagin,  And the distant public by its bravos fills her bliss.      ANTONIA.      Mother!      GHOST.      Antonia!      MIRACLE.      Join with her.      ANTONIA.      Yes, her soul calls me  As before;  'Tis my mother, 'tis she  I hear her voice.      THE GHOST.    Dear child whom I call  As I used to do;  'Tis your mother, 'tis she;  List to her voice.      ANTONIA.      No, enough, I cannot!      MIRACLE.      Again.      ANTONIA.      I will sing no more.      MIRACLE.      Again.      ANTONIA.      What ardor draws and devours me?      MIRACLE.      Again! Why stop?      ANTONIA (out of breath).    I give way to a transport that maddens,  What flame is it dazzles my eyes  A single moment to live,  And my soul flies to Heaven.      THE GHOST.      Dear child whom I call,        etc., etc.      ANTONIA.      'Tis my mother, 'tis she,        etc., etc.      ANTONIA.      Ah!    (She falls dying on the sofa. Miracle sinks in the earth uttering a peal    of laughter.)      CRESPEL (running in).    My child... my daughter... Antonia!.      ANTONIA (expiring).    My father! Listen, 'tis my mother  Who calls me. And he... has returned...  'Tis a song of love,  Flies away,  Sad or joyful...    (She dies.)      CRESPEL.    No... a single word... just one... my child... speak!  Come, speak! Execrable death!  No! pity, mercy... go away!      HOFFMAN (coming hurriedly).      Why these cries?      CRESPEL.    Hoffman!... ah wretch!  'Tis you who killed her!...      HOFFMAN (rushing to Antonia).      Antonia!      CRESPEL (beside himself).    Blood to color her cheek. A weapon.  A knife!...    (He seizes a knife and attacks Hoffman.)      NICKLAUSSE (entering and stopping Crespel).      Unhappy man!      HOFFMAN (to Nicklausse).    Quick! give the alarm;  A doctor... a doctor!...      MIRACLE (appearing).      Present!    (He feels Antonia's pulse.)      Dead!      CRESPEL (crazy).      Ah, God, my child, my daughter!      HOFFMAN (despairingly).      Antonia!          EPILOGUE.    (Same scene as First Act. The various personages are in the same    positions they were in at the end of First Act.)      HOFFMANN.    There is the story  Of my loves,  And the memory  In my heart will always remain.      CHORUS.      Bravo, bravo, Hoffmann.      HOFFMANN.    Ah, I am mad. For us the craze divine,  The spirits of alcohol, of beer and of wine,  For us intoxication,  Chaos where we forget.      NICKLAUSSE.      Ah, I understand, three dramas in a drama, Olympia...      HOFFMANN.      Smashed!      NICKLAUSSE.      Antonia...      HOFFMANN.      Dead!      NICKLAUSSE.      Giulietta...      HOFFMANN.    Oh, for her, the last verse of the song of Klein-Zach.  When he drank too much gin or rack,  You ought to have seen the two tails at his back,  Like lilies in a lac,  The monster made a sound of flick flack,      Flic, flac,      There's Klein-Zach.      CHORUS.        Flick flack,      There's Klein-Zach.      CHORUS.    Light up the punch, drunk we'll get;  And may the weakest  Roll under the table;  Luther was a goodly man,  Tire lan laire, tire lan la,      etc., etc.    (The students tumultuously go in the next room. Hoffmann remains as if    in a stupor.)      THE MUSE (appearing in an aureole of light).    And I? I, the faithful friend,  Whose hand wiped thy tears?  By whom thy latent sorrow  Exhales in heavenly dreams?  Am I nothing? May the tempest  Of passion pass away in thee!  The man is no more; the poet revives  I love thee Hoffmann! be mine!  Let the ashes of thy heart fire thy genius,  Whose serenity smiles on thy sorrows.  The Muse will soften thy blessed sufferings.  One is great by love but greater by tears.    (She disappears.)      HOFFMANN (alone).    Oh God! what ecstasy embraces my soul,  Like a concert divine Thy voice hath moved me,  With soft and burning fire my being is devoured,  Thy glances in mine have suffused their flame,  Like radiant stars.  And I feel, beloved Muse,  Thy perfumed breath flutter  On my lips and on my eyes!    (He falls face on table.)      STELLA (approaching slowly).      Hoffmann? asleep...      NICKLAUSSE.      No, dead drunk. Too late, madame.      LINDORF.      Corbleu!      NICKLAUSSE.      Oh, here is the counselor, Lindorf, who awaits you.    (Stella keeps her eyes on Hoffmann and throws a flower at his feet as    she goes out with Lindorf.)      THE END.

Nor would the  Maskilim have accomplished their aim, had the material they found at  hand been different from what it was.    The Jews in the land of the Slavonians were fortunate in being regarded  as aliens in a country which, as we have seen, they inhabited long  before those who claimed to be its possessors by divine right of  conquest. If their position was precarious, their sufferings were those  of a conquered nation. As the whim and fancy of the reigning prince,  knyaz, varied, they were induced one day to settle in the country by the  offer of the most flattering privileges, and the next day they were  expelled, only to be requested to return again. Now their synagogues and  cemeteries were exempt from taxation, now an additional poll-tax or  land-tax was levied on every Jew (serebshizna); one day they were  allowed to live unhampered by restrictions, then they were prohibited to  wear certain garments and ornaments, and commanded to use yellow caps  and kerchiefs to distinguish them from the Gentiles (1566).    But all this was the consequence of political subjugation. Judged by the  standard of the times, they were veritable freemen, freer than the  Huguenots of France and the Puritans of England. They were left  unmolested in the administration of their internal affairs, and were  permitted to appoint their own judges, enforce their own laws, and  support their own institutions. Forming a state within a state, they  developed a civilization contrasting strongly with that round about  them, and comparing favorably with some of the features of ours of  to-day. Slavonic Jewry was divided into four districts, consisting of  the more important communities (kahals), to which a number of smaller  ones (prikahalki) were subservient. These, known as the Jewish  Assemblies (zbori zhidovskiye), met at stated intervals. As in our  federal Government, the administrative, executive, and legislative  departments were kept distinct, and those who presided over them  (roshim) were elected annually by ballot. These roshim, or elders,  served by turns for periods of one month each. The rabbi of each  community was the chief judge, and was assisted by several inferior  judges (dayyanim). For matters of importance there were courts of appeal  established in Ostrog and Lemberg, the former having jurisdiction over  Volhynia and the Ukraine, the latter over the rest of Jewish  Russo-Poland. For inter-kahal litigation, there was a supreme court, the  Wa'ad Arba' ha-Arazot (the Synod of the Four Countries), which held its  sessions during the Lublin fair in winter and the Yaroslav fair in  summer. In cases affecting Jews and Gentiles, a decision was given by  the _judex Judaeorum_, who held his office by official appointment of  the grand duke.    So far their system of self-government appears almost a prototype of our  own. The same is true of their municipal administration. The rabbi, who  had the deciding vote in case of a dead-lock, stood in the same relation  to them as the mayor holds to us, only that his term of office,  nominally limited to three years, was actually for life or during good  behavior. Yet the power vested in him was only delegated power. A number  of selectmen, or aldermen, guarded the rights of the community with the  utmost jealousy, and tolerated no innovation, unless previously  sanctioned by them. There were also several honorary offices, with a  one-year tenure, which none could fill who had not had experience in an  inferior position. The chief duties attached to these offices were to  appraise the amount of taxation, pay the salaries of the rabbi, his  dayyanim, and the teachers of the public schools, provide for the poor,  and, above all, intercede with the Government.[38]    Still more interesting and, for our purpose, more important were their  public and private institutions of learning. Jews have always been noted  for the solicitous care they exercise in the education of the young. The  Slavonic Jews surpassed their brethren of other countries in this  respect. At times they wrenched the tender bond of parental love in  their ardor for knowledge. With a republican form of government they  created an aristocracy, not of wealth or of blood, but of intellect. The  education of girls was, indeed, neglected. To be able to read her  prayers in Hebrew and to write Yiddish was all that was expected of a  mother in Israel. It was otherwise with the boys. Every Jew deemed  himself in duty bound to educate his son. \"Learning is the best  merchandise\"--_Torah iz die beste sehorah_--was the lesson inculcated  from cradle to manhood, the precept followed from manhood to old age.  All the lullabies transmitted to us from earliest times indicate the  pursuit of knowledge as the highest ambition cherished by mothers for  their sons:      Patsche, patsche, little tootsies,    We shall buy us little bootsies;    Little bootsies we shall buy,    To run to heder we shall try;    Torah we'll learn and all good ma'alot (qualities),    On our wedding eve we shall solve sha'alot (ritual problems).[39]    To have a scholarly son or son-in-law was the best passport to the  highest circles, a means of rising from the lowliest to the loftiest  station in life.    It is no wonder, then, that schools abounded in every community. At the  early age of four the child was usually sent to the heder (school;  literally, room), where he studied until he was ready for the yeshibah,  the higher \"seat\" of learning. The melammedim, teachers, were graded  according to their ability, and the school year consisted of two terms,  zemannim, from the first Sabbath after the Holy Days to Passover and  from after Passover to Rosh ha-Shanah. The boy's intellectual capacities  were steadily, if not systematically, cultivated, sometimes at the  expense of his bodily development. It was not unusual for a child of  seven or eight to handle a difficult problem in the Talmud, a precocity  characteristic to this day of the children hailing from Slavonic  countries. Their 'illuyim (prodigies) might furnish ample material for  more than one volume of _les enfants celebres_.    Nor were the children of the poor left to grow up in ignorance. Learning  was free, to be had for the asking. More than this, stringent measures  were taken that no child be without instruction. Talmud Torahs were  founded even in the smallest kehillot (communities), and the students  were supplied, not only with books, but also with the necessaries of  life. Communal and individual benefactors furnished clothes, and every  member (ba'al ha-bayit) had to provide food and lodging for an indigent  pupil at least one day of each week. The \"Freitisch\" (free board) was an  inseparable adjunct to every school. Poor young men were not regarded as  \"beggar students.\" They were looked upon as earning their living by  study, even as teachers by instructing. To pray for the dead or the  living in return for their support is a recent innovation, and mostly  among other than Slavonic Jews. It is a custom adopted from medieval  Christianity, and practiced in England by the poor student, who, in the  words of Chaucer,      Busily 'gan for the souls to pray    On them that gave him wherewith to scolay.    For a faithful and vivid description of the yeshibot we cannot do better  than transcribe the account given in the pages of the little pamphlet  _Yeven Mezulah_ in which Nathan Hannover, mentioned above, has left us a  reliable history of the Cossack uprisings and the Kulturgeschichte of  his own time.        I need bring no proof for the statement that nowhere was the      study of the Law so universal as in Russo-Poland. In every      community there was a well-paid dean (rosh yeshibah), who,      exempt from worry about a livelihood, devoted himself      exclusively to teaching and studying by day and by night. In      every kahal, many youths, maintained liberally, studied under      the guidance of the dean. In turn, they instructed the less      advanced, who were also supported by the community. A kahal of      fifty [families] had to provide for at least thirty such. They      boarded and lodged in the homes of their patrons, and frequently      received pocket-money in addition. Thus there was hardly a house      in which the Torah was not studied, either by the master of the      house, a son, a son-in-law, or a student stranger. They always      bore in mind the dictum of Rabba, \"He who loves scholars will      have scholarly sons; he who welcomes scholars will have      scholarly sons-in-law; he who admires scholars will become      learned himself.\" No wonder, then, that every community swarmed      with scholars, that out of every fifty of its members at least      twenty were far advanced, and had the morenu (i.e. bachelor)      degree.        The dean was vested with absolute authority. He could punish an      offender, whether rich or poor. Everybody respected him, and he      often received gifts of money or valuables. In all religious      processions he came first. Then followed the students, then the      learned, and the rest of the congregation brought up the rear.      This veneration for the dean prompted many a youth to imitate      his example, and thus our country was rendered full of the      knowledge of the Law.    What became of the students when they were graduated? Let us turn once  more to Hannover's interesting narrative. The \"fairs\" of those days were  much more than opportunities for barter; they afforded favorable and  attractive occasions for other objects. Zaslav and Yaroslav during the  summer, Lemberg and Lublin in the winter, were \"filled with hundreds of  deans and thousands of students,\" and one who had a marriageable  daughter had but to resort thither to have his worries allayed.  Therefore, \"Jews and Jewesses attended these bazaars in"]]]
