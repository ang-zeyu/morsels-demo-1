Reginald's face was wan and bore the peculiar pallor of one who had  worked late at night.    \"You must be frightfully busy?\" Ernest asked, with genuine concern.    \"So I am,\" Reginald replied. \"I always work in a white heat. I am  restless, nervous, feverish, and can find no peace until I have given  utterance to all that clamours after birth.\"    \"What is it that is so engaging your mind, the epic of the French  Revolution?\"    \"Oh, no. I should never have undertaken that. I haven't done a stroke of  work on it for several weeks. In fact, ever since Walkham called, I  simply couldn't. It seemed as if a rough hand had in some way destroyed  the web of my thought. Poetry in the writing is like red hot glass  before the master-blower has fashioned it into birds and trees and  strange fantastic shapes. A draught, caused by the opening of a door may  distort it. But at present I am engaged upon more important work. I am  modelling a vessel not of fine-spun glass, but of molten gold.\"    \"You make me exceedingly anxious to know what you have in store for us.  It seems to me you have reached a point where even you can no longer  surpass yourself.\"    Reginald smiled. \"Your praise is too generous, yet it warms like  sunshine. I will confess that my conception is unique. It combines with  the ripeness of my technique the freshness of a second spring.\"    Ernest was bubbling with anticipated delights. His soul responded to  Reginald's touch as a harp to the winds. \"When,\" he cried, \"shall we be  privileged to see it?\"    Reginald's eyes were already straying back to his writing table. \"If the  gods are propitious,\" he remarked, \"I shall complete it to-night.  To-morrow is my reception, and I have half promised to read it then.\"    \"Perhaps I shall be in the position soon to let you see my play.\"    \"Let us hope so,\" Reginald replied absent-mindedly. The egotism of the  artist had once more chained him to his work.          X      That night a brilliant crowd had gathered in Reginald Clarke's house.  From the studio and the adjoining salon arose a continual murmur of  well-tuned voices. On bare white throats jewels shone as if in each a  soul were imprisoned, and voluptuously rustled the silk that clung to  the fair slim forms of its bearers in an undulating caress. Subtle  perfumes emanated from the hair and the hands of syren women,  commingling with the soft plump scent of their flesh. Fragrant tapers,  burning in precious crystal globules stained with exquisite colours,  sprinkled their shimmering light over the fashionable assemblage and  lent a false radiance to the faces of the men, while in the hair and the  jewels of the women each ray seemed to dance like an imp with its mate.    A seat like a throne, covered with furs of tropic beasts of prey, stood  in one corner of the room in the full glare of the light, waiting for  the monarch to come. Above were arranged with artistic _raffinement_  weird oriental draperies, resembling a crimson canopy in the total  effect. Chattering visitors were standing in groups, or had seated  themselves on the divans and curiously-fashioned chairs that were  scattered in seeming disorder throughout the salon. There were critics  and writers and men of the world. Everybody who was anybody and a little  bigger than somebody else was holding court in his own small circle of  enthusiastic admirers. The Bohemian element was subdued, but not  entirely lacking. The magic of Reginald Clarke's name made stately dames  blind to the presence of some individuals whom they would have passed on  the street without recognition.    Ernest surveyed this gorgeous assembly with the absent look of a  sleep-walker. Not that his sensuous soul was unsusceptible to the  atmosphere of culture and corruption that permeated the whole, nor to  the dazzling colour effects that tantalised while they delighted the  eye. But to-night they shrivelled into insignificance before the  splendour of his inner vision. A radiant dreamland palace, his play, had  risen from the night of inchoate thought. It was wonderful, it was real,  and needed for its completion only the detail of actual construction.  And now the characters were hovering in the recesses of his brain, were  yearning to leave that many-winded labyrinth to become real beings of  paper and ink. He would probably have tarried overlong in this fanciful  mansion, had not the reappearance of an unexpected guest broken his  reverie.    \"Jack!\" he exclaimed in surprise, \"I thought you a hundred miles away  from here.\"    \"That shows that you no longer care for me,\" Jack playfully answered.  \"When our friendship was young, you always had a presentiment of my  presence.\"    \"Ah, perhaps I had. But tell me, where do you hail from?\"    \"Clarke called me up on the telephone--long-distance, you know. I  suppose it was meant as a surprise for you. And you certainly looked  surprised--not even pleasantly. I am really head-over-heels at work.  But you know how it is. Sometimes a little imp whispers into my ears  daring me to do a thing which I know is foolish. But what of it? My legs  are strong enough not to permit my follies to overtake me.\"    \"It was certainly good of you to come. In fact, you make me very glad. I  feel that I need you to-night--I don't know why. The feeling came  suddenly--suddenly as you. I only know I need you. How long can you  stay?\"    \"I must leave you to-morrow morning. I have to hustle somewhat. You know  my examinations are taking place in a day or two and I've got to cram up  a lot of things.\"    \"Still,\" remarked Ernest, \"your visit will repay you for the loss of  time. Clarke will read to us to-night his masterpiece.\"    \"What is it?\"    \"I don't know. I only know it's the real thing. It's worth all the  wisdom bald-headed professors may administer to you in concentrated  doses at five thousand a year.\"    \"Come now,\" Jack could not help saying, \"is your memory giving way?  Don't you remember your own days in college--especially the mathematical  examinations? You know that your marks came always pretty near the  absolute zero.\"    \"Jack,\" cried Ernest in honest indignation, \"not the last time. The last  time I didn't flunk.\"    \"No, because your sonnet on Cartesian geometry roused even the  math-fiend to compassion. And don't you remember Professor Squeeler,  whose heart seemed to leap with delight whenever he could tell you that,  in spite of incessant toil on your part, he had again flunked you in  physics with fifty-nine and a half per cent.?\"    \"And he wouldn't raise the mark to sixty! God forgive him,--I cannot.\"    Here their exchange of reminiscences was interrupted. There was a stir.  The little potentates of conversation hastened to their seats, before  their minions had wholly deserted them.    The king was moving to his throne!    Assuredly Reginald Clarke had the bearing of a king. Leisurely he took  his seat under the canopy.    A hush fell on the audience; not a fan stirred as he slowly unfolded his  manuscript.          XI      The music of Reginald Clarke's intonation captivated every ear.  Voluptuously, in measured cadence, it rose and fell; now full and strong  like the sound of an organ, now soft and clear like the tinkling of  bells. His voice detracted by its very tunefulness from what he said.  The powerful spell charmed even Ernest's accustomed ear. The first page  gracefully glided from Reginald's hand to the carpet before the boy  dimly realised that he was intimately familiar with every word that fell  from Reginald's lips. When the second page slipped with seeming  carelessness from the reader's hand, a sudden shudder ran through the  boy's frame. It was as if an icy hand had gripped his heart. There could  be no doubt of it. This was more than mere coincidence. It was  plagiarism. He wanted to cry out. But the room swam before his eyes.  Surely he must be dreaming. It was a dream. The faces of the audience,  the lights, Reginald, Jack--all phantasmagoria of a dream.    Perhaps he had been ill for a long time. Perhaps Clarke was reading the  play for him. He did not remember having written it. But he probably had  fallen sick after its completion. What strange pranks our memories will  play us! But no! He was not dreaming, and he had not been ill.    He could endure the horrible uncertainty no longer. His overstrung  nerves must find relaxation in some way or break with a twang. He turned  to his friend who was listening with rapt attention.    \"Jack, Jack!\" he whispered.    \"What is it?\"    \"That is my play!\"    \"You mean that you inspired it?\"    \"No, I have written it, or rather, was going to write it.\"    \"Wake up, Ernest! You are mad!\"    \"No, in all seriousness. It is mine. I told you--don't you  remember--when we returned from Coney Island--that I was writing a  play.\"    \"Ah, but not this play.\"    \"Yes, this play. I conceived it, I practically wrote it.\"    \"The more's the pity that Clarke had preconceived it.\"    \"But it is mine!\"    \"Did you tell him a word about it?\"    \"No, to be sure.\"    \"Did you leave the manuscript in your room?\"    \"I had, in fact, not written a line of it. No, I had not begun the  actual writing.\"    \"Why should a man of Clarke's reputation plagiarise your plays, written  or unwritten?\"    \"I can see no reason. But--\"    \"Tut, tut.\"    For already this whispered conversation had elicited a look like a stab  from a lady before them.    Ernest held fast to the edge of a chair. He must cling to some reality,  or else drift rudderless in a dim sea of vague apprehensions.    Or was Jack right?    Was his mind giving way? No! No! No! There must be a monstrous secret  somewhere, but what matter? Did anything matter? He had called on his  mate like a ship lost in the fog. For the first time he had not  responded. He had not understood. The bitterness of tears rose to the  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17149"],[0,"Creative Chemistry: Descriptive of Recent Achievements in the Chemical (#5)"],[1,"ycerin, the same as you use for sunburn. This mixed  with nitric and sulfuric acids gives nitroglycerin, an easy thing to  make, though I should not advise anybody to try making it unless he has  his life insured. But nitroglycerin is uncertain stuff to keep and being  a liquid is awkward to handle. So it was mixed with sawdust or porous  earth or something else that would soak it up. This molded into sticks  is our ordinary dynamite.    If instead of glycerin we take cellulose in the form of wood pulp or  cotton and treat this with nitric acid in the presence of sulfuric we  get nitrocellulose or guncotton, which is the chief ingredient of  smokeless powder.    Now guncotton looks like common cotton. It is too light and loose to  pack well into a gun. So it is dissolved with ether and alcohol or  acetone to make a plastic mass that can be molded into rods and cut into  grains of suitable shape and size to burn at the proper speed.    Here, then, we have a liquid explosive, nitroglycerin, that has to be  soaked up in some porous solid, and a porous solid, guncotton, that has  to soak up some liquid. Why not solve both difficulties together by  dissolving the guncotton in the nitroglycerin and so get a double  explosive? This is a simple idea. Any of us can see the sense of  it--once it is suggested to us. But Alfred Nobel, the Swedish chemist,  who thought it out first in 1878, made millions out of it. Then,  apparently alarmed at the possible consequences of his invention, he  bequeathed the fortune he had made by it to found international prizes  for medical, chemical and physical discoveries, idealistic literature  and the promotion of peace. But his posthumous efforts for the  advancement of civilization and the abolition of war did not amount to  much and his high explosives were later employed to blow into pieces the  doctors, chemists, authors and pacifists he wished to reward.    Nobel's invention, \"cordite,\" is composed of nitroglycerin and  nitrocellulose with a little mineral jelly or vaseline. Besides cordite  and similar mixtures of nitroglycerin and nitrocellulose there are two  other classes of high explosives in common use.    One is made from carbolic acid, which is familiar to us all by its use  as a disinfectant. If this is treated with nitric and sulfuric acids we  get from it picric acid, a yellow crystalline solid. Every government  has its own secret formula for this type of explosive. The British call  theirs \"lyddite,\" the French \"melinite\" and the Japanese \"shimose.\"    The third kind of high explosives uses as its base toluol. This is not  so familiar to us as glycerin, cotton or carbolic acid. It is one of the  coal tar products, an inflammable liquid, resembling benzene. When  treated with nitric acid in the usual way it takes up like the others  three nitro groups and so becomes tri-nitro-toluol. Realizing that  people could not be expected to use such a mouthful of a word, the  chemists have suggested various pretty nicknames, trotyl, tritol,  trinol, tolite and trilit, but the public, with the wilfulness it always  shows in the matter of names, persists in calling it TNT, as though it  were an author like G.B.S., or G.K.C, or F.P.A. TNT is the latest of  these high explosives and in some ways the best of them. Picric acid has  the bad habit of attacking the metals with which it rests in contact  forming sensitive picrates that are easily set off, but TNT is inert  toward metals and keeps well. TNT melts far below the boiling point of  water so can be readily liquefied and poured into shells. It is  insensitive to ordinary shocks. A rifle bullet can be fired through a  case of it without setting it off, and if lighted with a match it burns  quietly. The amazing thing about these modern explosives, the organic  nitrates, is the way they will stand banging about and burning, yet the  terrific violence with which they blow up when shaken by an explosive  wave of a particular velocity like that of a fulminating cap. Like  picric acid, TNT stains the skin yellow and causes soreness and  sometimes serious cases of poisoning among the employees, mostly girls,  in the munition factories. On the other hand, the girls working with  cordite get to using it as chewing gum; a harmful habit, not because of  any danger of being blown up by it, but because nitroglycerin is a heart  stimulant and they do not need that.    [Illustration: The Genealogical Tree of Nitric Acid From W.Q. Whitman's  \"The Story of Nitrates in the War,\" _General Science Quarterly_]    TNT is by no means smokeless. The German shells that exploded with a  cloud of black smoke and which British soldiers called \"Black Marias,\"  \"coal-boxes\" or \"Jack Johnsons\" were loaded with it. But it is an  advantage to have a shell show where it strikes, although a disadvantage  to have it show where it starts.    It is these high explosives that have revolutionized warfare. As soon as  the first German shell packed with these new nitrates burst inside the  Gruson cupola at Liege and tore out its steel and concrete by the roots  the world knew that the day of the fixed fortress was gone. The armies  deserted their expensively prepared fortifications and took to the  trenches. The British troops in France found their weapons futile and  sent across the Channel the cry of \"Send us high explosives or we  perish!\" The home Government was slow to heed the appeal, but no  progress was made against the Germans until the Allies had the means to  blast them out of their entrenchments by shells loaded with five hundred  pounds of TNT.    All these explosives are made from nitric acid and this used to be made  from nitrates such as potassium nitrate or saltpeter. But nitrates are  rarely found in large quantities. Napoleon and Lee had a hard time to  scrape up enough saltpeter from the compost heaps, cellars and caves for  their gunpowder, and they did not use as much nitrogen in a whole  campaign as was freed in a few days' cannonading on the Somme. Now there  is one place in the world--and so far as we know one only--where  nitrates are to be found abundantly. This is in a desert on the western  slope of the Andes where ancient guano deposits have decomposed and  there was not enough rain to wash away their salts. Here is a bed two  miles wide, two hundred miles long and five feet deep yielding some  twenty to fifty per cent. of sodium nitrate. The deposit originally  belonged to Peru, but Chile fought her for it and got it in 1881. Here  all countries came to get their nitrates for agriculture and powder  making. Germany was the largest customer and imported 750,000 tons of  Chilean nitrate in 1913, besides using 100,000 tons of other nitrogen  salts. By this means her old, wornout fields were made to yield greater  harvests than our fresh land. Germany and England were like two duelists  buying powder at the same shop. The Chilean Government, pocketing an  export duty that aggregated half a billion dollars, permitted the  saltpeter to be shoveled impartially into British and German ships, and  so two nitrogen atoms, torn from their Pacific home and parted, like  Evangeline and Gabriel, by transportation oversea, may have found  themselves flung into each other's arms from the mouths of opposing  howitzers in the air of Flanders. Goethe could write a romance on such a  theme.    Now the moment war broke out this source of supply was shut off to both  parties, for they blockaded each other. The British fleet closed up the  German ports while the German cruisers in the Pacific took up a position  off the coast of Chile in order to intercept the ships carrying nitrates  to England and France. The Panama Canal, designed to afford relief in  such an emergency, caved in most inopportunely. The British sent a fleet  to the Pacific to clear the nitrate route, but it was outranged and  defeated on November 1, 1914. Then a stronger British fleet was sent  out and smashed the Germans off the Falkland Islands on December 8. But  for seven weeks the nitrate route had been closed while the chemical  reactions on the Marne and Yser were decomposing nitrogen-compounds at  an unheard of rate.    England was now free to get nitrates for her munition factories, but  Germany was still bottled up. She had stored up Chilean nitrates in  anticipation of the war and as soon as it was seen to be coming she  bought all she could get in Europe. But this supply was altogether  inadequate and the war would have come to an end in the first winter if  German chemists had not provided for such a contingency in advance by  working out methods of getting nitrogen from the air. Long ago it was  said that the British ruled the sea and the French the land so that left  nothing to the German but the air. The Germans seem to have taken this  jibe seriously and to have set themselves to make the most of the aerial  realm in order to challenge the British and French in the fields they  had appropriated. They had succeeded so far that the Kaiser when he  declared war might well have considered himself the Prince of the Power  of the Air. He had a fleet of Zeppelins and he had means for the  fixation of nitrogen such as no other nation possessed. The Zeppelins  burst like wind bags, but the nitrogen plants worked and made Germany  independent of Chile not only during the war, but in the time of peace.    Germany during the war used 200,000 tons of nitric acid a year in  explosives, yet her supply of nitrogen is exhaustless.    [Illustration: World production and consumption of fixed inorganic  nitrogen expressed in tons nitrogen    From _The Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry_, March,  1919.]      Nitrogen is free as air. That is the trouble; it is too free. It is  fixed nitrogen that we want and that we are willing to pay for; nitrogen  in combination with some other elements in the form of food or  fertilizer so we can make use of it as we set it free.
