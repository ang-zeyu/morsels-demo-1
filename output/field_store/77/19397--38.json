[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16643"],[0,"Essays (#5)"],[1,"proverb says, \"A  fig-tree, looking on a fig-tree, becometh fruitful.\"    It is remarkable, the character of the pleasure we derive from the  best books. They impress us ever with the conviction that one nature  wrote and the same reads. We read the verses of one of the great  English poets, of Chaucer,[33] of Marvell,[34] of Dryden,[35] with the  most modern joy,--with a pleasure, I mean, which is in great part  caused by the abstraction of all _time_ from their verses. There is  some awe mixed with the joy of our surprise, when this poet, who lived  in some past world, two or three hundred years ago, says that which  lies close to my own soul, that which I also had well-nigh thought and  said. But for the evidence thence afforded to the philosophical  doctrine of the identity of all minds, we should suppose some  pre-established harmony, some foresight of souls that were to be, and  some preparation of stores for their future wants, like the fact  observed in insects, who lay up food before death for the young grub  they shall never see.    I would not be hurried by any love of system, by any exaggeration of  instincts, to underrate the Book. We all know that as the human body  can be nourished on any food, though it were boiled grass and the  broth of shoes, so the human mind can be fed by any knowledge. And  great and heroic men have existed who had almost no other information  than by the printed page. I only would say that it needs a strong head  to bear that diet. One must be an inventor to read well. As the  proverb says, \"He that would bring home the wealth of the Indies must  carry out the wealth of the Indies.\" There is then creative reading as  well as creative writing. When the mind is braced by labor and  invention, the page of whatever book we read becomes luminous with  manifold allusion. Every sentence is doubly significant, and the sense  of our author is as broad as the world. We then see, what is always  true, that as the seer's hour of vision is short and rare among heavy  days and months, so is its record, perchance, the least part of his  volume. The discerning will read, in his Plato[36] or Shakespeare,  only that least part,--only the authentic utterances of the  oracle;--all the rest he rejects, were it never so many times Plato's  and Shakespeare's.    Of course there is a portion of reading quite indispensable to a wise  man. History and exact science he must learn by laborious reading.  Colleges, in like manner, have their indispensable office,--to teach  elements. But they can only highly serve us when they aim not to  drill, but to create; when they gather from far every ray of various  genius to their hospitable halls, and by the concentrated fires set  the hearts of their youth on flame. Thought and knowledge are natures  in which apparatus and pretension avail nothing. Gowns[37] and  pecuniary foundations,[38] though of towns of gold, can never  countervail the least sentence or syllable of wit.[39] Forget this,  and our American colleges will recede in their public importance,  whilst they grow richer every year.           *       *       *       *       *    III. There goes in the world a notion that the scholar should be a  recluse, a valetudinarian,[40]--as unfit for any handiwork or public  labor as a penknife for an axe. The so-called \"practical men\" sneer at  speculative men, as if, because they speculate or _see_, they could do  nothing. I have heard it said that the clergy--who are always, more  universally than any other class, the scholars of their day--are  addressed as women; that the rough, spontaneous conversation of men  they do not hear, but only a mincing[41] and diluted speech. They are  often virtually disfranchised; and indeed there are advocates for  their celibacy. As far as this is true of the studious classes, it is  not just and wise. Action is with the scholar subordinate, but it is  essential. Without it he is not yet man. Without it thought can never  ripen into truth. Whilst the world hangs before the eye as a cloud of  beauty, we cannot even see its beauty. Inaction is cowardice, but  there can be no scholar without the heroic mind. The preamble[42] of  thought, the transition through which it passes from the unconscious  to the conscious, is action. Only so much do I know, as I have lived.  Instantly we know whose words are loaded with life, and whose not.    The world--this shadow of the soul, or _other me_, lies wide around.  Its attractions are the keys which unlock my thoughts and make me  acquainted with myself. I launch eagerly into this resounding tumult.  I grasp the hands of those next me, and take my place in the ring to  suffer and to work, taught by an instinct that so shall the dumb  abyss[43] be vocal with speech. I pierce its order; I dissipate its  fear;[44] I dispose of it within the circuit of my expanding life. So  much only of life as I know by experience, so much of the wilderness  have I vanquished and planted, or so far have I extended my being, my  dominion. I do not see how any man can afford, for the sake of his  nerves and his nap, to spare any action in which he can partake. It is  pearls and rubies to his discourse. Drudgery, calamity, exasperation,  want, are instructors in eloquence and wisdom. The true scholar  grudges every opportunity of action passed by, as a loss of power.    It is the raw material out of which the intellect molds her splendid  products. A strange process too, this by which experience is converted  into thought, as a mulberry-leaf is converted into satin.[45] The  manufacture goes forward at all hours.    The actions and events of our childhood and youth are now matters of  calmest observation. They lie like fair pictures in the air. Not so  with our recent actions,--with the business which we now have in hand.  On this we are quite unable to speculate. Our affections as yet  circulate through it. We no more feel or know it than we feel the  feet, or the hand, or the brain of our body. The new deed is yet a  part of life,--remains for a time immersed in our unconscious life. In  some contemplative hour it detaches itself from the life like a ripe  fruit,[46] to become a thought of the mind. Instantly it is raised,  transfigured; the corruptible has put on incorruption.[47] Henceforth  it is an object of beauty, however base its origin and neighborhood.  Observe, too, the impossibility of antedating this act. In its grub  state it cannot fly, it cannot shine, it is a dull grub. But suddenly,  without observation, the selfsame thing unfurls beautiful wings, and  is an angel of wisdom. So is there no fact, no event, in our private  history, which shall not, sooner or later, lose its adhesive, inert  form, and astonish us by soaring from our body into the empyrean.[48]  Cradle and infancy, school and playground, the fear of boys, and dogs,  and ferules,[49] the love of little maids and berries, and many  another fact that once filled the whole sky, are gone already; friend  and relative, profession and party, town and country, nation and  world, must also soar and sing.[50]    Of course, he who has put forth his total strength in fit actions has  the richest return of wisdom. I will not shut myself out of this globe  of action, and transplant an oak into a flower-pot, there to hunger  and pine; nor trust the revenue of some single faculty, and exhaust  one vein of thought, much like those Savoyards,[51] who, getting their  livelihood by carving shepherds, shepherdesses, and smoking Dutchmen,  for all Europe, went out one day to the mountain to find stock, and  discovered that they had whittled up the last of their pine-trees.  Authors we have, in numbers, who have written out their vein, and who,  moved by a commendable prudence, sail for Greece or Palestine, follow  the trapper into the prairie, or ramble round Algiers, to replenish  their merchantable stock.    If it were only for a vocabulary, the scholar would be covetous of  action. Life is our dictionary.[52] Years are well spent in country  labors; in town; in the insight into trades and manufactures; in frank  intercourse with many men and women; in science; in art; to the one  end of mastering in all their facts a language by which to illustrate  and embody our perceptions. I learn immediately from any speaker how  much he has already lived, through the poverty or the splendor of his  speech. Life lies behind us as the quarry from whence we get tiles and  copestones for the masonry of to-day. This is the way to learn  grammar. Colleges and books only copy the language which the field and  the work-yard made.    But the final value of action, like that of books, and better than  books, is that it is a resource. That great principle of Undulation in  nature, that shows itself in the inspiring and expiring of the breath;  in desire and satiety; in the ebb and flow of the sea; in day and night;  in heat and cold; and, as yet more deeply ingrained in every atom and  every fluid, is known to us under the name of Polarity,--these \"fits of  easy transmission and reflection,\" as Newton[53] called them, are the  law of nature because they are the law of spirit.    The mind now thinks, now acts, and each fit reproduces the other. When  the artist has exhausted his materials, when the fancy no longer  paints, when thoughts are no longer apprehended and books are a  weariness,--he has always the resource _to live_. Character is higher  than intellect. Thinking is the function. Living is the functionary.  The stream retreats to its source. A great soul will be strong to  live, as well as strong to think. Does he lack organ or medium to  impart his truth? He can still fall back on this elemental force of  living them. This is a total act. Thinking is a partial act. Let the  grandeur of justice shine in his affairs. Let the beauty of affection  cheer his lowly roof. Those \"far from fame,\" who dwell and act with  him, will feel the force of his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16653"],[0,"Myths of Babylonia and Assyria (#5)"],[1,"in accordance with the doings of the deities; they sorrowed or  made glad in sympathy with the spirits of nature. Worshippers also  suggested by their ceremonies how the deities should act at various  seasons, and thus exercised, as they believed, a magical control over  them.    In Babylonia the agricultural myth regarding the Mother goddess and  the young god had many variations. In one form Tammuz, like Adonis,  was loved by two goddesses--the twin phases of nature--the Queen of  Heaven and the Queen of Hades. It was decreed that Tammuz should spend  part of the year with one goddess and part of the year with the other.  Tammuz was also a Patriarch, who reigned for a long period over the  land and had human offspring. After death his spirit appeared at  certain times and seasons as a planet, star, or constellation. He was  the ghost of the elder god, and he was also the younger god who was  born each year.    In the Gilgamesh epic we appear to have a form of the patriarch  legend--the story of the \"culture hero\" and teacher who discovered the  path which led to the land of ancestral spirits. The heroic Patriarch  in Egypt was Apuatu, \"the opener of the ways\", the earliest form of  Osiris; in India he was Yama, the first man, \"who searched and found  out the path for many\".    The King as Patriarch was regarded during life as an incarnation of  the culture god: after death he merged in the god. \"Sargon of Akkad\"  posed as an incarnation of the ancient agricultural Patriarch: he  professed to be a man of miraculous birth who was loved by the goddess  Ishtar, and was supposed to have inaugurated a New Age of the  Universe.    The myth regarding the father who was superseded by his son may  account for the existence in Babylonian city pantheons of elder and  younger gods who symbolized the passive and active forces of nature.    Considering the persistent and cumulative influence exercised by  agricultural religion it is not surprising to find, as has been  indicated, that most of the Babylonian gods had Tammuz traits, as most  of the Egyptian gods had Osirian traits. Although local or imported  deities were developed and conventionalized in rival Babylonian  cities, they still retained traces of primitive conceptions. They  existed in all their forms--as the younger god who displaced the elder  god and became the elder god, and as the elder god who conciliated the  younger god and made him his active agent; and as the god who was  identified at various seasons with different heavenly bodies and  natural phenomena. Merodach, the god of Babylon, who was exalted as  chief of the National pantheon in the Hammurabi Age, was, like Tammuz,  a son, and therefore a form of Ea, a demon slayer, a war god, a god of  fertility, a corn spirit, a Patriarch, and world ruler and guardian,  and, like Tammuz, he had solar, lunar, astral, and atmospheric  attributes. The complex characters of Merodach and Tammuz were not due  solely to the monotheistic tendency: the oldest deities were of  mystical character, they represented the \"Self Power\" of Naturalism as  well as the spirit groups of Animism.    The theorizing priests, who speculated regarding the mysteries of life  and death and the origin of all things, had to address the people  through the medium of popular beliefs. They utilized floating myths  for this purpose. As there were in early times various centres of  culture which had rival pantheons, the adapted myths varied greatly.  In the different forms in which they survive to us they reflect, not  only aspects of local beliefs, but also grades of culture at different  periods. We must not expect, however, to find that the latest form of  a myth was the highest and most profound. The history of Babylonian  religion is divided into periods of growth and periods of decadence.  The influence of domestic religion was invariably opposed to the new  and high doctrines which emanated from the priesthood, and in times of  political upheaval tended to submerge them in the debris of immemorial  beliefs and customs. The retrogressive tendencies of the masses were  invariably reinforced by the periodic invasions of aliens who had no  respect for official deities and temple creeds.    We must avoid insisting too strongly on the application of the  evolution theory to the religious phenomena of a country like  Babylonia.    The epochs in the intellectual life of an ancient people are not  comparable to geological epochs, for instance, because the forces at  work were directed by human wills, whether in the interests of  progress or otherwise. The battle of creeds has ever been a battle of  minds. It should be recognized, therefore, that the human element  bulks as prominently in the drama of Babylon's religious history as  does the prince of Denmark in the play of _Hamlet_. We are not  concerned with the plot alone. The characters must also receive  attention. Their aspirations and triumphs, their prejudices and  blunders, were the billowy forces which shaped the shoreland of the  story and made history.    Various aspects of Babylonian life and culture are dealt with  throughout this volume, and it is shown that the growth of science and  art was stimulated by unwholesome and crude superstitions. Many rank  weeds flourished beside the brightest blossoms of the human intellect  that wooed the sun in that fertile valley of rivers. As in Egypt,  civilization made progress when wealth was accumulated in sufficient  abundance to permit of a leisured class devoting time to study and  research. The endowed priests, who performed temple ceremonies, were  the teachers of the people and the patrons of culture. We may think  little of their religious beliefs, regarding which after all we have  only a superficial knowledge, for we have yet discovered little more  than the fragments of the shell which held the pearl, the faded petals  that were once a rose, but we must recognize that they provided  inspiration for the artists and sculptors whose achievements compel  our wonder and admiration, moved statesmen to inaugurate and  administer humanitarian laws, and exalted Right above Might.    These civilizations of the old world, among which the Mesopotamian and  the Nilotic were the earliest, were built on no unsound foundations.  They made possible \"the glory that was Greece and the grandeur that  was Rome\", and it is only within recent years that we have begun to  realize how incalculable is the debt which the modern world owes to  them.

Before the dawn of the historical period Ancient Babylonia was  divided into a number of independent city states similar to those  which existed in pre-Dynastic Egypt. Ultimately these were grouped  into loose confederacies. The northern cities were embraced in the  territory known as Akkad, and the southern in the land of Sumer, or  Shumer. This division had a racial as well as a geographical  significance. The Akkadians were \"late comers\" who had achieved  political ascendency in the north when the area they occupied was  called Uri, or Kiuri, and Sumer was known as Kengi. They were a people  of Semitic speech with pronounced Semitic affinities. From the  earliest times the sculptors depicted them with abundant locks, long  full beards, and the prominent distinctive noses and full lips, which  we usually associate with the characteristic Jewish type, and also  attired in long, flounced robes, suspended from their left shoulders,  and reaching down to their ankles. In contrast, the Sumerians had  clean-shaven faces and scalps, and noses of Egyptian and Grecian  rather than Semitic type, while they wore short, pleated kilts, and  went about with the upper part of their bodies quite bare like the  Egyptian noblemen of the Old Kingdom period. They spoke a non-Semitic  language, and were the oldest inhabitants of Babylonia of whom we have  any knowledge. Sumerian civilization was rooted in the agricultural  mode of life, and appears to have been well developed before the  Semites became numerous and influential in the land. Cities had been  built chiefly of sun-dried and fire-baked bricks; distinctive pottery  was manufactured with much skill; the people were governed by  humanitarian laws, which formed the nucleus of the Hammurabi code, and  had in use a system of cuneiform writing which was still in process of  development from earlier pictorial characters. The distinctive feature  of their agricultural methods was the engineering skill which was  displayed in extending the cultivatable area by the construction of  irrigating canals and ditches. There are also indications that they  possessed some knowledge of navigation and traded on the Persian Gulf.  According to one of their own traditions Eridu, originally a seaport,  was their racial cradle. The Semitic Akkadians adopted the distinctive  culture of these Sumerians after settlement, and exercised an  influence on its subsequent growth.    Much controversy has been waged regarding the original home of the  Sumerians and the particular racial type which"]]]
