Look at there, Jack Smith's hayfork  he left after him! He'll be wanting it. (_Calls_) Jack Smith! Jack  Smith!--He's gone through the crowd; hurry after him, Bartley,  he'll be wanting it.    BARTLEY. I'll do that. This is no safe place to be leaving it.  (_He takes up fork awkwardly and upsets the basket._) Look at that  now! If there is any basket in the fair upset, it must be our own  basket! (_He goes out to right._)    MRS. FALLON. Get out of that! It is your own fault, it is. Talk  of misfortunes and misfortunes will come. Glory be! Look at my  new egg-cups rolling in every part--and my two pound of sugar  with the paper broke--    MRS. TARPEY (_turning from stall_). God help us, Mrs. Fallon, what  happened your basket?    MRS. FALLON. It's himself that knocked it down, bad manners to  him. (_Putting things up_) My grand sugar that's destroyed, and  he'll not drink his tea without it. I had best go back to the  shop for more, much good may it do him!    (_Enter_ TIM CASEY.)    TIM CASEY. Where is Bartley Fallon, Mrs. Fallon? I want a word  with him before he'll leave the fair. I was afraid he might have  gone home by this, for he's a temperate man.    MRS. FALLON. I wish he did go home! It'd be best for me if he  went home straight from the fair green, or if he never came with  me at all! Where is he, is it? He's gone up the road (_jerks  elbow_) following Jack Smith with a hayfork.    (_She goes out to left._)    TIM CASEY. Following Jack Smith with a hayfork! Did ever anyone  hear the like of that. (_Shouts_) Did you hear that news, Mrs.  Tarpey?    MRS. TARPEY. I heard no news at all.    TIM CASEY. Some dispute I suppose it was that rose between Jack  Smith and Bartley Fallon, and it seems Jack made off, and Bartley  is following him with a hayfork!    MRS. TARPEY. Is he now? Well, that was quick work! It's not ten  minutes since the two of them were here, Bartley going home and  Jack going to the Five-Acre Meadow; and I had my apples to settle  up, that Jo Muldoon of the police had scattered, and when I  looked round again Jack Smith was gone, and Bartley Fallon was  gone, and Mrs. Fallon's basket upset, and all in it strewed upon  the ground--the tea here--the two pound of sugar there--the  egg-cups there. Look, now, what a great hardship the deafness  puts upon me, that I didn't hear the commincement of the fight!  Wait till I tell James Ryan that I see below; he is a neighbor of  Bartley's; it would be a pity if he wouldn't hear the news!    (_She goes out. Enter_ SHAWN EARLY _and_ MRS. TULLY.)    TIM CASEY. Listen, Shawn Early! Listen, Mrs. Tully, to the news!  Jack Smith and Bartley Fallon had a falling out, and Jack knocked  Mrs. Fallon's basket into the road, and Bartley made an attack on  him with a hayfork, and away with Jack, and Bartley after him.  Look at the sugar here yet on the road!    SHAWN EARLY. Do you tell me so? Well, that's a queer thing, and  Bartley Fallen so quiet a man!    MRS. TULLY. I wouldn't wonder at all. I would never think well of  a man that would have that sort of a moldering look. It's likely  he has overtaken Jack by this.    (_Enter_ JAMES RYAN _and_ MRS. TARPEY.)    JAMES RYAN. That is great news Mrs. Tarpey was telling me! I  suppose that's what brought the police and the magistrate up this  way. I was wondering to see them in it a while ago.    SHAWN EARLY. The police after them? Bartley Fallen must have  injured Jack so. They wouldn't meddle in a fight that was only  for show!    MRS. TULLY. Why wouldn't he injure him? There was many a man  killed with no more of a weapon than a hayfork.    JAMES RYAN. Wait till I run north as far as Kelly's bar to spread  the news!    (_He goes out._)    TIM CASEY. I'll go tell Jack Smith's first cousin that is  standing there south of the church after selling his lambs.    (_Goes out._)    MRS. TULLY. I'll go telling a few of the neighbors I see beyond  to the west.    (_Goes out._)    SHAWN EARLY. I'll give word of it beyond at the east of the  green.    (_Is going out when MRS. TARPEY seizes hold of him._)    MRS. TARPEY. Stop a minute, Shawn Early, and tell me did you see  red Jack Smith's wife, Kitty Keary, in any place?    SHAWN EARLY. I did. At her own house she was, drying clothes on  the hedge as I passed.    MRS. TARPEY. What did you say she was doing?    SHAWN EARLY (_breaking away_). Laying out a sheet on the hedge.    (_He goes._)    MRS. TARPEY. Laying out a sheet for the dead! The Lord have mercy  on us! Jack Smith dead, and his wife laying out a sheet for his  burying! (_Calls out_) Why didn't you tell me that before, Shawn  Early? Isn't the deafness the great hardship? Half the world  might be dead without me knowing of it or getting word of it at  all! (_She sits down and rocks herself._) O my poor Jack Smith! To  be going to his work so nice and so hearty, and to be left  stretched on the ground in the full light of the day!    (_Enter_ TIM CASEY.)    TIM CASEY. What is it, Mrs. Tarpey? What happened since?    MRS. TARPEY. O my poor Jack Smith!    TIM CASEY. Did Bartley overtake him?    MRS. TARPEY. O the poor man!    TIM CASEY. Is it killed he is?    MRS. TARPEY. Stretched in the Five-Acre Meadow!    TIM CASEY. The Lord have mercy on us! Is that a fact?    MRS. TARPEY. Without the rites of the Church or a ha'porth!    TIM CASEY. Who was telling you?    MRS. TARPEY. And the wife laying out a sheet for his corpse.  (_Sits up and wipes her eyes._) I suppose they'll wake him the same  as another?    (_Enter_ MRS. TULLY, SHAWN EARLY, _and_ JAMES RYAN.)    MRS. TULLY. There is great talk about this work in every quarter  of the fair.    MRS. TARPEY. Ochone! cold and dead. And myself maybe the last he  was speaking to!    JAMES RYAN. The Lord save us! Is it dead he is?    TIM CASEY. Dead surely, and the wife getting provision for the  wake.    SHAWN EARLY. Well, now, hadn't Bartley Fallon great venom in him?    MRS. TULLY. You may be sure he had some cause. Why would he have  made an end of him if he had not? (_To MRS. TARPEY, raising her  voice_) What was it rose the dispute at all, Mrs. Tarpey?    MRS. TARPEY. Not a one of me knows. The last I saw of them, Jack  Smith was standing there, and Bartley Fallon was standing there,  quiet and easy, and he listening to \"The Red-haired Man's Wife.\"    MRS. TULLY. Do you hear that, Tim Casey? Do you hear that, Shawn  Early and James Ryan? Bartley Fallon was here this morning  listening to red Jack Smith's wife, Kitty Keary that was!  Listening to her and whispering with her! It was she started the  fight so!    SHAWN EARLY. She must have followed him from her own house. It is  likely some person roused him.    TIM CASEY. I never knew, before, Bartley Fallon was great with  Jack Smith's wife.    MRS. TULLY. How would you know it? Sure it's not in the streets  they would be calling it. If Mrs. Fallon didn't know of it, and  if I that have the next house to them didn't know of it, and if  Jack Smith himself didn't know of it, it is not likely you would  know of it, Tim Casey.    SHAWN EARLY. Let Bartley Fallon take charge of her from this out  so, and let him provide for her. It is little pity she will get  from any person in this parish.    TIM CASEY. How can he take charge of her? Sure he has a wife of  his own. Sure you don't think he'd turn souper and marry her in a  Protestant church?    JAMES RYAN. It would be easy for him to marry her if he brought  her to America.    SHAWN EARLY. With or without Kitty Keary, believe me, it is for  America he's making at this minute. I saw the new magistrate and  Jo Muldoon of the police going into the post-office as I came  up--there was hurry on them--you may be sure it was to telegraph  they went, the way he'll be stopped in the docks at Queenstown!    MRS. TULLY. It's likely Kitty Keary is gone with him, and not  minding a sheet or a wake at all. The poor man, to be deserted by  his own wife, and the breath hardly gone out yet from his body  that is lying bloody in the field!    (_Enter_ MRS. FALLON.)    MRS. FALLON. What is it the whole of the town is talking about?  And what is it you yourselves are talking about? Is it about my  man Bartley Fallon you are talking? Is it lies about him you are  telling, saying that he went killing Jack Smith? My grief that  ever he came into this place at all!    JAMES RYAN. Be easy now, Mrs. Fallon. Sure there is no one at all  in the whole fair but is sorry for you!    MRS. FALLON. Sorry for me, is it? Why would anyone be sorry for  me? Let you be sorry for yourselves, and that there may be shame  on you forever and at the day of judgment, for the words you are  saying and the lies you are telling to take away the character of  my poor man, and to take the good name off of him, and to drive  him to destruction! That is what you are doing!    SHAWN EARLY. Take comfort now, Mrs. Fallon. The police are not so  smart as they think. Sure he might give them the slip yet, the  same as Lynchehaun.    MRS. TULLY. If they do get him, and if they do put a rope around  his neck, there is no one can say he does not deserve it!    MRS. FALLON. Is that what you are saying, Bridget Tully, and is  that what you think? I tell you it's too much talk you have,  making yourself out to be such a great one, and to be running  down every respectable person! A rope, is it? It isn't much of a  rope was needed to tie up your own furniture the day you came  into Martin Tully's house, and you never bringing as much as a  blanket, or a penny, or a suit of clothes with you, and I myself  bringing seventy pounds and two feather beds. And now you are  stiffer than a woman would have a hundred pounds! It is too much  talk the whole of you have. A rope is it? I tell you the whole of  this town is full of liars and schemers that would hang you up  for half a glass of whiskey (_turning to go_). People they are you  wouldn't believe as much as daylight from,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16441"],[0,"The Closet of Sir Kenelm Digby Knight Opened (#5)"],[1,"there.\" This latter house, which can be seen in  its eighteenth-century guise in Hogarth's print of \"Morning,\" in _The Four  Hours of the Day_ set, is now the quarters of the National Sporting Club.  There he worked and talked and entertained, made his metheglin and _aqua  vitae_ and other messes, till his last illness in 1665. Paris as ever  attracted him; and in France were good doctors for his disease, the stone.  He had himself borne on a litter to the coast; but feeling death's hand on  him, he turned his face homeward again, and died in Covent Garden, June 11,  1665. In his will he desired to be buried by his beautiful Venetia in  Christ Church, Newgate, and that no mention should be made of him on the  tomb, where he had engraved four Latin inscriptions to her memory. But  Ferrar wrote an epitaph for him:--        \"Under this tomb the matchless Digby lies,      Digby the great, the valiant, and the wise,\" etc.    The Great Fire destroyed the tomb, and scattered their ashes.    He had died poor; and his surviving son John, with whom he had been on bad  terms, declared that all the property that came to him was his father's  sumptuously compiled history of the Digby family. Apparently John regained  some part of the estates later, which perhaps had only been left away from  him to pay off debts. A great library of Sir Kenelm's was still in Paris;  and after his death it was claimed by the French king, and sold for 10,000  crowns. His kinsman, the second Earl of Bristol, bought it, and joined it  to his own; and the catalogue of the combined collection, sold in London in  1683, is an interesting and too little tapped source for Digby's mental  history. Of his five children, three were already dead. Kenelm, his eldest  son, had fallen at St. Neot's, in 1648, fighting for the King. It was his  remaining son John who sanctioned the publication of his father's receipts.           *       *       *       *       *    Sir Kenelm Digby has been recognised as the type of the great amateur, but  always with a shaking of the head. Why this scorn of accomplished amateurs?  Rather may their tribe increase, let us pray. Our world languisheth now for  lack of them. He was fitted by nature to play the role superbly, to force  his circumstances, never over pliant, to serve not his material interests,  but his fame, his craving for universal knowledge and attainments. Says  Wood: \"His person was handsome and gigantick, and nothing was wanting to  make him a compleat Cavalier. He had so graceful elocution and noble  address that had he been dropped out of the clouds into any part of the  world, he would have made himself respected; but the Jesuits who cared not  for him, spoke spitefully, and said it was true, but then he must not stay  there above six weeks. He had a great faculty, which proceeded from  abundance of wit and invention, of proposing and reporting matters to the  Virtuosi.\"    Women adored him; and he took great pains to please them--though in spite  of the importunities of Marie de Medicis, the long friendship with  Henrietta Maria, his early flirtation with the lovely Spaniard, his earnest  and impolitic championship of the notorious Lady Purbeck--Romish convert  and adventuress--Venetia, it seems, remained his only love. He was never  the mere gallant. He treated women as his intellectual equals, but as  equals who had to be splendidly entertained and amused. His conversation  was \"ingeniose and innocent.\" Lloyd speaks of \"the grace wherewith he could  relate _magnarum rerum minutias_, the little circumstances of great  matters.\" But men were at his feet as well; and on his tour among Italian  courts, one of the grandees said that, \"having no children, he was very  willing his wife should bring him a Prince by Sir Kenelme, whom he imagined  the just measure of perfection.\"    A first-rate swordsman, yet was he \"not apt in the least to give offence.\"  His strength was that of a giant. Bristol related that one day at Sherborne  he took up \"a midling man,\" chair and all, with one arm. But there was  nothing of the swashbuckler about him, and his endless vitality was matched  by his courtesy. True, he hustled a Pope; but he addressed the Short  Parliament in such reverential terms as no Roundhead could have found. One  who had been courtier, exile, naval commander, student, prisoner, and  diplomatist, who had associated with all sorts of persons, from kings to  alchemists and cooks, had learnt resourcefulness. But he was never too hard  put to it perhaps, seeing that \"if he had not fourpence, wherever he came  he would find respect and credit.\" \"No man knew better how to abound, and  to be abased, and either was indifferent to him.\"    He had his detractors. One who plays so many parts incites envy and  ridicule; and he laid himself particularly open to both. Fantasy was in the  Digby blood; and that agility of mind and nerve that turns now here, now  there, to satisfy an unquenchable curiosity, that exuberance of mental  spirits that forces to rapid and continuous expression, has ever been  suspect of the English mind. He was \"highly caressed in France.\" To Evelyn  Sir Kenelm was a \"teller of strange things,\" and again the Diarist called  him \"an errant mountebank\"--though Evelyn sought his society, and was  grateful for its stimulus. Lady Fanshawe, who met him at Calais, at the  Governor's table, says he \"enlarged somewhat more in extraordinary stories  than might be averred.... That was his infirmity, though otherwise a person  of most excellent parts, and a very fine bred gentleman.\" \"A certain  eccentricity and unsteadiness perhaps inseparable from a mind of such  vanity,\" is Lodge's criticism. \"The Pliny of our age for lying,\" quoth  Stubbes. But Digby's extraordinary stories were by no means all false. He  may have talked sometimes to _epater le bourgeois;_ but his serious  statements were often judged as were the wonders of evolution by country  audiences in the seventies.    His offence was he must always be talking. His ideas he must share,  expound, illustrate, whether or no they were ripe. It is the sign-manual of  the sincere amateur. His books are probably but the lees of his  conversation. He was not, in the first place, a literary person. His  _Memoirs_ are good reading for those with a touch of the fantastic in  themselves; but the average literary critic will dub them rhodomontade. His  scientific and controversial treatises, not at all unreadable, and full of  strange old lore, survive as curiosities never to be reprinted.  Nevertheless, his temper was distinctly scientific, and if his exact  discoveries be limited to observing the effect of oxygen on plant-life, and  his actual invention to a particular kind of glass bottle, yet he was an  eager student and populariser of the work of Bacon, Galileo, and Harvey;  and his laboratories were the nursing grounds of the new experimental  philosophy.    With a distinctly rationalistic temper, he was yet a faithful, if  independent, son of the Roman Church. He speaks sometimes as if he regarded  the Church as the great storehouse of necessary authority for the  intellectually feeble; but he accepted the main dogmas himself, being  satisfied of them by intuition and reason. Protestantism, he held, was not  for the ordinary person, considering \"the natural imbecility of man's wits  and understandings.\" His piety was a thing apart, a matter of heredity  perhaps, and of his poetic temperament. I have heard him called by that  abused name, \"mystic.\" He was nothing of the sort, and he said so in  memorable words. As an act of devotion he translated the _Adhering to God_  of Albertus Magnus. In the dedication to his mother he compares himself, as  the translator of this mystic treatise, to certain travellers who \"speak  upon hearsay of countries they were never in.\" \"The various course in the  world that I have runne myself out of breath in, hath afforded me little  means for solid recollection.\" Yet was he now and then upon the threshold.  With streaks of the quack and adventurer in him, he gave out deep notes.  Says Lloyd: \"His soul [was] one of those few souls that understand  themselves.\"    With an itch to use his pen as well as his tongue, he had none of the  patience, the hankering after perfection of form, of the professional man  of letters. His account of his Scanderoon exploit, a sea-log, a little  written-up later, was perhaps not meant for publication. It did not see the  light till 1868. His _Memoirs_ were written, he says, \"for my own  recreation, and then continued and since preserved only for my own private  content--to please myself in looking back upon my past and sweet errors.\"  He even begs those who may come upon the MS. \"to convert these blotted  sheets into a clear flame.\" His commentary on the _Faery Queen_ stanza was  thrown off in a hurry. \"The same Discourse I made upon it the first half  quarter of an hour that I saw it, I send you there, without having reduced  it to any better form, or added anything at all to it.\" And so for the  better-known and interesting _Observations on 'Religio Medici.'_ Browne  reproached him for his review of a pirated edition. Digby replied he had  never authorised its publication, written as it was in twenty-four hours,  which included his procuring and reading the book--a truly marvellous _tour  de force_; for the thing is still worth perusal. He was always the  improvisor--ready, brilliant, vivid, imperfect. He must give vent to the  ideas that came upon him in gusts. \"The impressions which creatures make  upon me,\" he says, \"are like boisterous winds.\" He fully recognised his own  limitations. \"I pretend not to learning,\" he declares, with exaggerated  modesty. Amateur and improviser of genius, let us praise him as such. The  spacious, generous minds that can find room for all the ideas and culture  of an epoch are never numerous enough. There is no one like such amateurs  for"]]]
