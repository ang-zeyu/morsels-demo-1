The    square was surrounded, but the mob had scattered in several directions,    and, the darkness of the neighborhood aiding them, not one was taken.      At the time the mob made the attack on the little house there were also    in it David Mabry, the sixty-two-year-old husband of the wounded woman;    her son, Harry Mabry; his wife, Fannie, and an infant child. The young    couple with their babe could not be found after the whole affair was    over, and they either escaped or were hustled off by the mob. A careful    search of the whole neighborhood was made, but no trace of them could be    found.      The little place occupied by the Mabry family is an old cottage on the    swamp side of Rousseau Street. It is furnished with slat shutters to    both doors and windows. These shutters had been pulled off by the mob    and the volleys fired through the glass doors. The younger Mabrys,    father, mother and child, were asleep in the first room at the time.    Hannah Mabry and her old husband were sleeping in the next room. The old    couple occupied the same bed, and it is miraculous that the old man did    not share the fate of his spouse.      Officer Bitterwolf, who was one of the first on the scene, said that he    was about a block and a half away with Officers Fordyce and Sweeney.    There were about twenty shots fired, and the trio raced to the cottage.    They saw twenty or thirty men running down Rousseau Street. Chase was    given and the crowd turned toward the river and scattered into several    vacant lots in the neighborhood.      The volunteer police stationed at the Sixth Precinct had about five    blocks to run before they arrived. They also moved on the reports of the    firing, and in a remarkably short time the square was surrounded, but no    one could be taken. As they ran to the scene they were assailed on every    hand with vile epithets and the accusation of \"Nigger lovers.\"      Rousseau Street, where the cottage is situated, is a particularly dark    spot, and no doubt the members of the mob were well acquainted with the    neighborhood, for the officers said that they seemed to sink into the    earth, so completely and quickly did they disappear after they had    completed their work, which was complete with the firing of the volley.      Hannah Mabry was taken to the Charity Hospital in the ambulance, where    it was found on examination that she had been shot through the right    lung, and that the wound was a particularly serious one.      Her old husband was found in the little wrecked home well nigh    distracted with fear and grief. It was he who informed the police that    at the time of the assault the younger Mabrys occupied the front room.    As he ran about the little home as well as his feeble condition would    permit he severely lacerated his feet on the glass broken from the    windows and door. He was escorted to the Sixth Precinct station, where    he was properly cared for. He could not realize why his little family    had been so murderously attacked, and was inconsolable when his wife was    driven off in the ambulance piteously moaning in her pain.      The search for the perpetrators of the outrage was thorough, but both    police and armed force of citizens had only their own efforts to rely    on. The residents of the neighborhood were aroused by the firing, but    they would give no help in the search and did not appear in the least    concerned over the affair. Groups were on almost every doorstep, and    some of them even jeered in a quiet way at the men who were voluntarily    attempting to capture the members of the mob. Absolutely no information    could be had from any of them, and the whole affair had the appearance    of being the work of roughs who either lived in the vicinity, or their    friends.      +DEATH OF CHARLES+    Friday witnessed the final act in the bloody drama begun by the three  police officers, Aucoin, Mora and Cantrelle. Betrayed into the hands of  the police, Charles, who had already sent two of his would-be murderers to  their death, made a last stand in a small building, 1210 Saratoga Street,  and, still defying his pursuers, fought a mob of twenty thousand people,  single-handed and alone, killing three more men, mortally wounding two  more and seriously wounding nine others. Unable to get to him in his  stronghold, the besiegers set fire to his house of refuge. While the  building was burning Charles was shooting, and every crack of his  death-dealing rifle added another victim to the price which he had placed  upon his own life. Finally, when fire and smoke became too much for flesh  and blood to stand, the long sought for fugitive appeared in the door,  rifle in hand, to charge the countless guns that were drawn upon him.  With a courage which was indescribable, he raised his gun to fire again,  but this time it failed, for a hundred shots riddled his body, and he fell  dead face fronting to the mob. This last scene in the terrible drama is  thus described in the _Times-Democrat_ of July 26:      Early yesterday afternoon, at 3 o'clock or thereabouts, Police Sergeant    Gabriel Porteus was instructed by Chief Gaster to go to a house at No.    1210 Saratoga Street, and search it for the fugitive murderer, Robert    Charles. A private \"tip\" had been received at the headquarters that the    fiend was hiding somewhere on the premises.      Sergeant Porteus took with him Corporal John R. Lally and Officers    Zeigel and Essey. The house to which they were directed is a small,    double frame cottage, standing flush with Saratoga Street, near the    corner of Clio. It has two street entrances and two rooms on each side,    one in front and one in the rear. It belongs to the type of cheap little    dwellings commonly tenanted by Negroes.      Sergeant Porteus left Ziegel and Essey to guard the outside and went    with Corporal Lally to the rear house, where he found Jackson and his    wife in the large room on the left. What immediately ensued is only    known by the Negroes. They say the sergeant began to question them about    their lodgers and finally asked them whether they knew anything about    Robert Charles. They strenuously denied all knowledge of his    whereabouts.      The Negroes lied. At that very moment the hunted and desperate murderer    lay concealed not a dozen feet away. Near the rear, left-hand corner of    the room is a closet or pantry, about three feet deep, and perhaps eight    feet long. The door was open and Charles was crouching, Winchester in    hand, in the dark further end.      Near the closet door was a bucket of water, and Jackson says that    Sergeant Porteous walked toward it to get a drink. At the next moment a    shot rang out and the brave officer fell dead. Lally was shot directly    afterward. Exactly how and where will never be known, but the    probabilities are that the black fiend sent a bullet into him before he    recovered from his surprise at the sudden onslaught. Then the murderer    dashed out of the back door and disappeared.      The neighborhood was already agog with the tragic events of the two    preceding days, and the sound of the shots was a signal for wild and    instant excitement. In a few moments a crowd had gathered and people    were pouring in by the hundred from every point of the compass. Jackson    and his wife had fled and at first nobody knew what had happened, but    the surmise that Charles had recommenced his bloody work was on every    tongue and soon some of the bolder found their way to the house in the    rear. There the bleeding forms of the two policemen told the story.      Lally was still breathing, and a priest was sent for to administer the    last rites. Father Fitzgerald responded, and while he was bending over    the dying man the outside throng was rushing wildly through the    surrounding yards and passageways searching for the murderer. \"Where is    he?\" \"What has become of him?\" were the questions on every lip.      Suddenly the answer came in a shot from the room directly overhead. It    was fired through a window facing Saratoga Street, and the bullet struck    down a young man named Alfred J. Bloomfield, who was standing in the    narrow passage-way between the two houses. He fell on his knees and a    second bullet stretched him dead.      When he fled from the closet Charles took refuge in the upper story of    the house. There are four windows on that floor, two facing toward    Saratoga Street and two toward Rampart. The murderer kicked several    breaches in the frail central partition, so he could rush from side to    side, and like a trapped beast, prepared to make his last stand.      Nobody had dreamed that he was still in the house, and when Bloomfield    was shot there was a headlong stampede. It was some minutes before the    exact situation was understood. Then rifles and pistols began to speak,    and a hail of bullets poured against the blind frontage of the old    house. Every one hunted some coign of vantage, and many climbed to    adjacent roofs. Soon the glass of the four upper windows was shattered    by flying lead. The fusillade sounded like a battle, and the excitement    upon the streets was indescribable.      Throughout all this hideous uproar Charles seems to have retained a    certain diabolical coolness. He kept himself mostly out of sight, but    now and then he thrust the gleaming barrel of his rifle through one of    the shattered window panes and fired at his besiegers. He worked the    weapon with incredible rapidity, discharging from three to five    cartridges each time before leaping back to a place of safety. These    replies came from all four windows indiscriminately, and showed that he    was keeping a close watch in every direction. His wonderful marksmanship    never failed him for a moment, and when he missed it was always by the  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14977"],[0,"The Red Record (#5)"],[1,"tizens, that  this matter was duly investigated, the criminals apprehended and the  punishment meted out to the murderers. But this is a mistake; nothing of  the kind was done or attempted. Six months after the publication, above  referred to, an investigator, writing to find out what had been done in  the matter, received the following reply:      OFFICE OF    S.S. GLOVER,    SHERIFF AND COLLECTOR,    LONOKE COUNTY.      Lonoke, Ark., 9-12-1892      Geo. Washington, Esq.,    Chicago, Ill.      DEAR SIR:--The parties who killed Hamp Briscoe February the ninth, have    never been arrested. The parties are still in the county. It was done by    some of the citizens, and those who know will not tell.      S.S. GLOVER, Sheriff    Thus acts the mob with the victim of its fury, conscious that it will  never be called to an account. Not only is this true, but the moral  support of those who are chosen by the people to execute the law, is  frequently given to the support of lawlessness and mob violence. The press  and even the pulpit, in the main either by silence or open apology, have  condoned and encouraged this state of anarchy.      TORTURED AND BURNED IN TEXAS    Never In the history of civilization has any Christian people stooped to  such shocking brutality and indescribable barbarism as that which  characterized the people of Paris, Texas, and adjacent communities on the  first of February, 1893. The cause of this awful outbreak of human passion  was the murder of a four-year-old child, daughter of a man named Vance.  This man, Vance, had been a police officer in Paris for years, and was  known to be a man of bad temper, overbearing manner and given to harshly  treating the prisoners under his care. He had arrested Smith and, it is  said, cruelly mistreated him. Whether or not the murder of his child was  an art of fiendish revenge, it has not been shown, but many persons who  know of the incident have suggested that the secret of the attack on the  child lay in a desire for revenge against its father.    In the same town there lived a Negro, named Henry Smith, a well-known  character, a kind of roustabout, who was generally considered a harmless,  weak-minded fellow, not capable of doing any important work, but  sufficiently able to do chores and odd jobs around the houses of the white  people who cared to employ him. A few days before the final tragedy, this  man, Smith, was accused of murdering Myrtle Vance. The crime of murder was  of itself bad enough, and to prove that against Smith would have been  amply sufficient in Texas to have committed him to the gallows, but the  finding of the child so exasperated the father and his friends, that they  at once shamefully exaggerated the facts and declared that the babe had  been ruthlessly assaulted and then killed. The truth was bad enough, but  the white people of the community made it a point to exaggerate every  detail of the awful affair, and to inflame the public mind so that nothing  less than immediate and violent death would satisfy the populace. As a  matter of fact, the child was not brutally assaulted as the world has been  told in excuse for the awful barbarism of that day. Persons who saw the  child after its death, have stated, under the most solemn pledge to truth,  that there was no evidence of such an assault as was published at that  time, only a slight abrasion and discoloration was noticeable and that  mostly about the neck. In spite of this fact, so eminent a man as Bishop  Haygood deliberately and, it must also appear, maliciously falsified the  fact by stating that the child was torn limb from limb, or to quote his  own words, \"First outraged with demoniacal cruelty and then taken by her  heels and torn asunder in the mad wantonness of gorilla ferocity.\"    Nothing is farther from the truth than that statement. It is a  coldblooded, deliberate, brutal falsehood which this Christian(?) Bishop  uses to bolster up the infamous plea that the people of Paris were driven  to insanity by learning that the little child had been viciously  assaulted, choked to death, and then torn to pieces by a demon in human  form. It was a brutal murder, but no more brutal than hundreds of murders  which occur in this country, and which have been equalled every year in  fiendishness and brutality, and for which the death penalty is prescribed  by law and inflicted only after the person has been legally adjudged  guilty of the crime. Those who knew Smith, believe that Vance had at some  time given him cause to seek revenge and that this fearful crime was the  outgrowth of his attempt to avenge himself of some real or fancied wrong.  That the murderer was known as an imbecile, had no effect whatever upon  the people who thirsted for his blood. They determined to make an example  of him and proceeded to carry out their purpose with unspeakably greater  ferocity than that which characterized the half-crazy object of their  revenge.    For a day or so after the child was found in the woods, Smith remained in  the vicinity as if nothing had happened, and when finally becoming aware  that he was suspected, he made an attempt to escape. He was apprehended,  however, not far from the scene of his crime and the news flashed across  the country that the white Christian people of Paris, Texas and the  communities thereabout had deliberately determined to lay aside all forms  of law and inaugurate an entirely new form of punishment for the murder.  They absolutely refused to make any inquiry as to the sanity or insanity  of their prisoner, but set the day and hour when in the presence of  assembled thousands they put their helpless victim to the stake, tortured  him, and then burned him to death for the delectation and satisfaction of  Christian people.    Lest it might be charged that any description of the deeds of that day are  exaggerated, a white man's description which was published in the white  journals of this country is used. The _New York Sun_ of February 2, 1893,  contains an account, from which we make the following excerpt:      PARIS, Tex., Feb. 1, 1893.--Henry Smith, the negro ravisher of    four-year-old Myrtle Vance, has expiated in part his awful crime by    death at the stake. Ever since the perpetration of his awful crime this    city and the entire surrounding country has been in a wild frenzy of    excitement. When the news came last night that he had been captured at    Hope, Ark., that he had been identified by B.B. Sturgeon, James T.    Hicks, and many other of the Paris searching party, the city was wild    with joy over the apprehension of the brute. Hundreds of people poured    into the city from the adjoining country and the word passed from lip    to lip that the punishment of the fiend should fit the crime that death    by fire was the penalty Smith should pay for the most atrocious murder    and terrible outrage in Texas history. Curious and sympathizing alike,    they came on train and wagons, on horse, and on foot to see if the frail    mind of a man could think of a way to sufficiently punish the    perpetrator of so terrible a crime. Whisky shops were closed, unruly    mobs were dispersed, schools were dismissed by a proclamation from the    mayor, and everything was done in a business-like manner.      MEETING OF CITIZENS    About 2 o'clock Friday a mass meeting was called at the courthouse and  captains appointed to search for the child. She was found mangled beyond  recognition, covered with leaves and brush as above mentioned. As soon as  it was learned upon the recovery of the body that the crime was so  atrocious the whole town turned out in the chase. The railroads put up  bulletins offering free transportation to all who would join in the  search. Posses went in every direction, and not a stone was left unturned.  Smith was tracked to Detroit on foot, where he jumped on a freight train  and left for his old home in Hempstead county, Arkansas. To this county he  was tracked and yesterday captured at Clow, a flag station on the Arkansas  & Louisiana railway about twenty miles north of Hope. Upon being  questioned the fiend denied everything, but upon being stripped for  examination his undergarments were seen to be spattered with blood and a  part of his shirt was torn off. He was kept under heavy guard at Hope last  night, and later on confessed the crime.    This morning he was brought through Texarkana, where 5,000 people awaited  the train, anxious to see a man who had received the fate of Ed. Coy. At  that place speeches were made by prominent Paris citizens, who asked that  the prisoner be not molested by Texarkana people, but that the guard be  allowed to deliver him up to the outraged and indignant citizens of Paris.  Along the road the train gathered strength from the various towns, the  people crowded upon the platforms and tops of coaches anxious to see the  lynching and the negro who was soon to be delivered to an infuriated mob.      BURNED AT THE STAKE    Arriving here at 12 o'clock the train was met by a surging mass of  humanity 10,000 strong. The negro was placed upon a carnival float in  mockery of a king upon his throne, and, followed by an immense crowd, was  escorted through the city so that all might see the most inhuman monster  known in current history. The line of march was up Main Street to the  square, around the square down Clarksville street to Church Street, thence  to the open prairies about 300 yards from the Texas & Pacific depot. Here  Smith was placed upon a scaffold, six feet square and ten feet high,  securely bound, within the view of all beholders. Here the victim was  tortured for fifty minutes by red-hot iron brands thrust against his  quivering body. Commencing at the feet the brands were placed against him  inch by inch until they were thrust against the face. Then, being  apparently dead, kerosene was poured upon him, cottonseed hulls placed  beneath him and set on fire. In less time"]]]
