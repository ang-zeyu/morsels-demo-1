To describe M. de Morgan's discovery as a \"happy guess,\" as has been  done, is therefore beside the mark.         * El-Kab. Egyptian Research Account, 1897, p. 11.         ** Diospolis Parva.

Randall-Maclver and Wilkin at el-'Amra. The imposing lion-headed  promontory of el-'Amra stands out into the plain on the west bank of the  Nile about five miles south of Abydos. At the foot of this hill M. de  Morgan found a very extensive prehistoric necropolis, which he examined,  but did not excavate to any great extent, and the work of thoroughly  excavating it was performed by Messrs. Randall-MacIver and Wilkin for  the Egypt Exploration Fund. The results have thrown very great light  upon the prehistoric culture of Egypt, and burials of all prehistoric  types, some of them previously unobserved, were found. Among the most  interesting are burials in pots, which have also been found by Mr.  Garstang in a predynastic necropolis at Ragagna, north of Abydos. One  of the more remarkable observations made at el-'Amra was the progressive  development of the tombs from the simplest pot-burial to a small brick  chamber, the embryo of the brick tombs of the Ist Dynasty. Among the  objects recovered from this site may be mentioned a pottery model of  oxen, a box in the shape of a model hut, and a slate \"palette\" with what  is perhaps the oldest Egyptian hieroglyph known, a representation of the  fetish-sign of the god Min, in relief. All these are preserved in the  British Museum. The skulls of the bodies found were carefully preserved  for craniometric examination.    In 1901 an extensive prehistoric cemetery was being excavated by Messrs.  Reisner and Lythgoe at Nag'ed-Der, opposite Girga, and at el-Ahaiwa,  further north, another prehistoric necropolis has been excavated by  these gentlemen, working for the University of California.    [Illustration: 027.jpg CAMP OF THE EXPEDITION OF THE UNIVERSITY OF  CALIFORNIA AT NAG' ED-DER, 1901.]    The cemetery of Nag'ed-Der is of the usual prehistoric type, with its  multitudes of small oval graves, excavated just a little way below the  surface. Graves of this kind are the most primitive of all. Those at  el-'Amra are usually more developed, often, as has been noted, rising to  the height of regular brick tombs. They are evidently later, nearer to  the time of the Ist Dynasty. The position of the Nag'ed-Der cemetery is  also characteristic. It lies on the usual low ridge at the entrance to a  desert _wadi_, which is itself one of the most picturesque in this  part of Egypt, with its chaos of great boulders and fallen rocks. An  illustration of the camp of Mr. Reisner's expedition at Nag'ed-Der is  given above. The excavations of the University of California are carried  out with the greatest possible care and are financed with the greatest  possible liberality. Mr. Reisner has therefore been able to keep an  absolutely complete photographic record of everything, even down to  the successive stages in the opening of a tomb, which will be of the  greatest use to science when published.    For a detailed study of the antiquities of the prehistoric period the  publications of Prof. Petrie, Mr. Quibell, and Mr. Randall-Maclver are  more useful than that of M. de Morgan, who does not give enough details.  Every atom of evidence is given in the publications of the British  explorers, whereas it is a characteristic of French work to give  brilliant conclusions, beautifully illustrated, without much of the  evidence on which the conclusions are based. This kind of work does not  appeal to the Anglo-Saxon mind, which takes nothing on trust, even  from the most renowned experts, and always wants to know the why and  wherefore. The complete publication of evidence which marks the British  work will no doubt be met with, if possible in even more complete  detail, in the American work of Messrs. Reisner, Lythgoe, and Mace (the  last-named is an Englishman) for the University of California, when  published. The question of speedy versus delayed publication is a very  vexing one. Prof. Petrie prefers to publish as speedily as possible; six  months after the season's work in Egypt is done, the full publication  with photographs of everything appears. Mr. Reisner and the French  explorers prefer to publish nothing until they have exhaustively studied  the whole of the evidence, and can extract nothing more from it. This  would be admirable if the French published their discoveries fully, but  they do not. Even M. de Morgan has not approached the fulness of  detail which characterizes British work and which will characterize Mr.  Reisner's publication when it appears. The only drawback to this method  is that general interest in the particular excavations described tends  to pass away before the full description appears.    Prof. Petrie has explored other prehistoric sites at Abadiya, and Mr.  Quibell at el-Kab. M. de Morgan and his assistants have examined a large  number of sites, ranging from the Delta to el-Kab. Further research has  shown that some of the sites identified by M. de Morgan as prehistoric  are in reality of much later date, for example, Kahun, where the late  flints of XIIth Dynasty date were found. He notes that \"large numbers  of Neolithic flint weapons are found in the desert on the borders of  the Fayyum, and at Helwan, south of Cairo,\" and that all the important  necropoles and kitchen-middens of the predynastic people are to be found  in the districts of Abydos and Thebes, from el-Kawamil in the North to  el-Kab in the South. It is of course too soon to assert with confidence  that there are no prehistoric remains in any other part of Egypt,  especially in the long tract between the Fayyum and the district of  Abydos, but up to the present time none have been found in this region.    This geographical distribution of the prehistoric remains fits in  curiously with the ancient legend concerning the origin of the ancestors  of the Egyptians in Upper Egypt, and supports the much discussed theory  that they came originally to the Nile valley from the shores of the Red  Sea by way of the Wadi Hammamat, which debouches on to the Nile in the  vicinity of Koptos and Kus, opposite Ballas and Tukh. The supposition  seems a very probable one, and it may well be that the earliest  Egyptians entered the valley of the Nile by the route suggested and  then spread northwards and southwards in the valley. The fact that their  remains are not found north of el-Kawamil nor south of el-Kab might  perhaps be explained by the supposition that, when they had extended  thus far north and south from their original place of arrival, they  passed from the primitive Neolithic condition to the more highly  developed copper-using culture of the period which immediately preceded  the establishment of the monarchy. The Neolithic weapons of the Fayyum  and Hel-wan would then be the remains of a different people, which  inhabited the Delta and Middle Egypt in very early times. This people  may have been of Mediterranean stock, akin to the primitive inhabitants  of Palestine, Greece, Italy, and Spain; and they no doubt were identical  with the inhabitants of Lower Egypt who were overthrown and conquered by  Kha-sekhem and the other Southern founders of the monarchy (who belonged  to the race which had come from the Red Sea by the Wadi Hammamat), and  so were the ancestors of the later natives of Lower Egypt. Whether the  Southerners, whose primitive remains we find from el-Kawamil to el-Kab,  were of the same race as the Northerners whom they conquered, cannot  be decided. The skull-form of the Southerners agrees with that of the  Mediterranean races. But we have no necropoles of the Northerners to  tell us much of their peculiarities. We have nothing but their flint  arrowheads.    But it should be observed that, in spite of the present absence of all  primitive remains (whether mere flints, or actual graves with bodies and  relics) of the primeval population between the Fayyum and el-Kawamil,  there is no proof that the primitive race of Upper Egypt was not  coterminous and identical with that of the lower country. It  might therefore be urged that the whole Neolithic population was  \"Mediterranean\" by its skull-form and body-structure, and specifically  \"Nilotic\" (indigenous Egyptian) in its culture-type. This is quite  possible, but we have again to account for the legends of distant origin  on the Red Sea coast, the probability that one element of the Egyptian  population was of extraneous origin and came from the east into the Nile  valley near Koptos, and finally the historical fact of an advance of the  early dynastic Egyptians from the South to the conquest of the North.  The latter fact might of course be explained as a civil war analogous  to that between Thebes and Asyut in the time of the IXth Dynasty, but  against this explanation is to be set the fact that the contemporary  monuments of the Southerners exhibit the men of the North as of foreign  and non-Egyptian ethnic type, resembling Libyans. It is possible that  they were akin to the Libyans; and this would square very well with the  first theory, but it may also be made to fit in with a development of  the second, which has been generally accepted.

[Illustration: 030.jpg DIFFERENT POSTURES FOR APPROACHING THE KING]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Insinger. The       picture represents Khamhait presenting the superintendents       of storehouses to Tutankhamon, of the XVIIIth dynasty.    While hoping that his fictitious claim to universal dominion would be  realized, the king adopted, in addition to the simple costume of the old  chiefs, the long or short petticoat, the jackal's tail, the turned-up  sandals, and the insignia of the supreme gods,--the ankh, the crook, the  flail, and the sceptre tipped with the head of a jerboa or a hare, which  we misname the cucupha-headed sceptre.* He put on the many-coloured  diadems of the gods, the head-dresses covered with feathers, the white  and the red crowns either separately or combined so as to form the  pshent. The viper or uraeus, in metal or gilded wood, which rose from  his forehead, was imbued with a mysterious life, which made it a means  of executing his vengeance and accomplishing his secret purposes. It was  supposed to vomit flames and to destroy those who should dare to attack  its master in battle. The supernatural virtues which it communicated to  the crown, made it an enchanted thing which no one could resist. Lastly,  Pharaoh had his temples where his enthroned statue, animated by one  of his doubles, received worship, prophesied, and fulfilled all the  functions of a Divine Being, both during his life, and after he had  rejoined in the tomb his ancestors the gods, who existed before him and  who now reposed impassively within the depths of their pyramids.**         * This identification, suggested by Champollion, is, from       force of custom, still adhered to, in nearly all works on       Egyptology. But we know from ancient evidence that the       cucupha was a bird, perhaps a hoopoe; the sceptre of the       gods, moreover, is really surmounted by the head of a       quadruped having a pointed snout and long retreating ears,       and belonging to the greyhound, jackal, or jerboa species.         ** This method of distinguishing deceased kings is met with       as far back as the \"Song of the Harpist,\" which the       Egyptians of the Ramesside period attributed to the founder       of the XIth dynasty. The first known instance of a temple       raised by an Egyptian king to his double is that of       Amenothes III.    Man, as far as his body was concerned, and god in virtue of his soul and  its attributes, the Pharaoh, in right of this double nature, acted as a  constant mediator between heaven and earth. He alone was fit to transmit  the prayers of men to his fathers and his brethren the gods. Just as the  head of a family was in his household the priest _par excellence_ of the  gods of that family,--just as the chief of a nome was in his nome the  priest _par excellence_ in regard to the gods of the nome,--so was  Pharaoh the priest _par excellence_ of the gods of all Egypt, who were  his special deities. He accompanied their images in solemn processions;  he poured out before them the wine and mystic milk, recited the formulas  in their hearing, seized the bull who was the victim with a lasso and  slaughtered it according to the rite consecrated by ancient tradition.  Private individuals had recourse to his intercession, when they asked  some favour from on high; as, however, it was impossible for every  sacrifice to pass actually through his hands, the celebrating priest  proclaimed at the beginning of each ceremony that it was the king who  made the offering--_Sutni di hotpu_--he and none other, to Osiris,  Phtah, and Ka-Harmakhis, so that they might grant to the faithful  who implored the object of their desires, and, the declaration being  accepted in lieu of the act, the king was thus regarded as really  officiating on every occasion for his subjects.*         *I do not agree with Prof. Ed. Meyer, or with Prof. Erman,       who imagine that this was the first instance of the       practice, and that it had been introduced into Nubia before       its adoption on Egyptian soil. Under the Ancient Empire we       meet with more than one functionary who styles himself, in       some cases during his master's lifetime, in others shortly       after his death, \"Prophet of Horus who lives in the palace,\"       or \"Prophet of Kheops,\" \"Prophet of Sondi,\" \"Prophet of       Kheops, of Mykerinos, of Usirkaf,\" or \"of other sovereigns.\"    He thus maintained daily intercourse with the gods, and they, on their  part, did not neglect any occasion of communicating with him. They  appeared to him in dreams to foretell his future, to command him to  restore a monument which was threatened with ruin, to advise him to set  out to war, to forbid him risking his life in the thick of the fight.*         * Among other examples, the texts mention the dream in which       Thutmosis IV., while still a royal prince, received from       Phra-Harmakhis orders to unearth the Great Sphinx, the dream       in which Phtah forbids Minephtah to take part in the battle       against the peoples of the sea, that by which Tonuatamon,       King of Napata, is persuaded to undertake the conquest of       Egypt. Herodotus had already made us familiar with the       dreams of Sabaco and of the high priest Sethos.    Communication by prophetic dreams was not, however, the method usually  selected by the gods: they employed as interpreters of their wishes  the priests and the statues in the temples. The king entered the chapel  where the statue was kept, and performed in its presence the invocatory  rites, and questioned it upon the subject which occupied his mind. The  priest replied under direct inspiration from on high, and the dialogue  thus entered upon might last a long time. Interminable discourses,  whose records cover the walls of the Theban temples, inform us what  the Pharaoh said on such occasions, and in what emphatic tones the  gods replied. Sometimes the animated statues raised their voices in  the darkness of the sanctuary and themselves announced their will; more  frequently they were content to indicate it by a gesture. When they were  consulted on some particular subject and returned no sign, it was their  way of signifying their disapprobation. If, on the other hand, they  significantly bowed their head, once or twice, the subject was an  acceptable one, and they approved it. No state affair was settled  without asking their advice, and without their giving it in one way or  another.    The monuments, which throw full light on the supernatural character  of the Pharaohs in general, tell us but little of the individual  disposition of any king in particular, or of their everyday life. When  by chance we come into closer intimacy for a moment with the sovereign,  he is revealed to us as being less divine and majestic than we might  have been led to believe, had we judged him only by his impassive  expression and by the pomp with which he was surrounded in public. Not  that he ever quite laid aside his grandeur; even in his home life,  in his chamber or his garden, during those hours when he felt himself  withdrawn from public gaze, those highest in rank might never forget  when they approached him that he was a god. He showed himself to be a  kind father, a good-natured husband,* ready to dally with his wives and  caress them on the cheek as they offered him a flower, or moved a piece  upon the draught-board.         * As a literary example of what the conduct of a king was       like in his family circle, we may quote the description of       King Minibphtah, in the story of Satni-Khamois. The pictures       of the tombs at Tel-el-Amarna show us the intimate terms on       which King Khuniaton lived with his wife and daughters, both       big and little.    He took an interest in those who waited on him, allowed them certain  breaches of etiquette when he was pleased with them, and was indulgent  to their little failings. If they had just returned from foreign lands,  a little countrified after a lengthy exile from the court, he would  break out into pleasantries over their embarrassment and their  unfashionable costume,--kingly pleasantries which excited the forced  mirth of the bystanders, but which soon fell flat and had no meaning for  those outside the palace. The Pharaoh was fond of laughing and drinking;  indeed, if we may believe evil tongues, he took so much at times as to  incapacitate him for business. The chase was not always a pleasure  to him, hunting in the desert, at least, where the lions evinced a  provoking tendency to show as little respect for the divinity of the  prince as for his mortal subjects; but, like the chiefs of old, he felt  it a duty to his people to destroy wild beasts, and he ended by counting  the slain in hundreds, however short his reign might be.*         *Amenothes III. had killed as many as a hundred and two       lions during the first ten years of his reign.    A considerable part of his time was taken up in war--in the east,  against the Libyans in the regions of the Oasis; in the Nile Valley to  the south of Aswan against the Nubians; on the Isthmus of Suez and in  the Sinaitic Peninsula against the Bedouin; frequently also in a civil  war against some ambitious noble or some turbulent member of his own  family. He travelled frequently from south to north, and from north to  south, leaving in every possible place marked traces of his visits--on  the rocks of Elephantine and of the first cataract, on those of Silsilis  or of El-Kab, and he appeared to his vassals as Tumu"]]]
